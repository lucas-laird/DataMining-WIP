Club sandwich okay bacon good but rest club sandwich rather plain boring   café Bellagio definitely doesn't live Bellagio standards  more cheap quick eats   wouldn't come expecting great food  <EOR> Great food service  breakfast brunch twice week  Everything ordered very good  <EOR> Sevice    service? wait seated sign without anyone front waited 10 minutes  called someone seated  Nobody showed next 10 minutes although busy   left     unnoticed! <EOR> After roaming strip breakfast spot ended Cafe Bellagio while perusing Botanical Gardens  short line but pretty quickly which good since tummy growling hunger    We seated near gardens beautiful view all pretty flowers such  waitress very attentive nice  food pretty tasty I lobster eggs benedict ice tea thirst quencher    The only drawback however prices  little bit pricier side prepared that  <EOR> Came late night birthday celebration  We'd drinking salmon burger other sandwiches satisfying  kind basic food but tastes good place open late overly expensive if order sandwich over entree  large group sat table overlooking open area aviary  decor servers really nice   Came back breakfast morning good coffee nice view sun streaming crab cake eggs benny quite good though slice ham unnecessary  menu says come Canadian bacon but just thick slice lunch meat ham  would better without that  bottom stacks hash browns burnt hardened though full enough point wanting any more hash browns  Again server really nice  meal $18  <EOR> Hey folks Bellagio Cafe Las Vegas Denny's Podunkville going expensive side but pay don't!  don't       ketchup dirty refilled bottles sticky maple syrup bottles paper napkins list on!

On last day guys trip Vegas made way Cafe Bellagio last Vegas breakfast!  decided weren't going another buffet b c lack time wasn't willing spend much money   One pure benefits being member mLife Gold Status fact there's no waiting line rather just front priority service!    Our waitress very friendly no mistakes made order   food came quite quickly breakfast quite delicious  the Denver omelet   coffee freshly brewed best all prices weren't bad!    Service quite prompt given fact Sunday mornings quite crowded many grabbing quick breakfast before checking heading back home   definite repeat re occur again !  Overall grade A <EOR> Our usual lunch when stay Bellagio quick meal coffee shop Cafe Bellagio   Usual fare breakfasts sandwiches burgers just good old comfort food   Good portions quick service won't leave hungry   I Bellagio Omelet   Chunks lobster cheddar cheese asparagus tomatoes   Hash browns little weak   Hubby club sandwich fries   YUM   always enjoy good club sandwich crispy crispy bacon piled it   Delish!  The next day usual favorite   plain Caesar salad order chicken tenders side   chicken tenders basically chicken breasts breaded fried they're huge!  Hubby chicken salad sandwich   Looked hella messy but he gobbled guess he really liked it  <EOR> A little pricey but open 24 hours  ate turkey club which delicious loaded bacon  cappuccino very good  gelato banana split AMAZING!! menu looked limited two Am but asked something menu made it  <EOR> Don't here! Overpriced overrated bad service    Environment I thought cafe would nice dining experience overlooking pools but tables close might well convo your neighbor  Noisy! Debbie Downer waitress never smiled saw only three times once take order another time deliver food final time deliver check  Um refills? She even messed drink order coffee  forget coffee during brunch?   Food I ordered lox bagel  Can't screw but say bagel small only gave three rings onion even full slice onion! lox bagel worth $15  cream cheese portion much   maybe tablespoon  tomato slice regular beef steak vine ripened tomato pill y  However lox good  bro ordered corned beef hash which good meaty hash browns tasty crunchy  meal came close $70   for breakfast    Why two stars? The service bad food  Avoid place hit buffet eat another hotel  Definitely overpriced service food environment worth price  <EOR> LOVE IT!   A Vegas tradition always least breakfast here    Breakfast shines ambiance PERFECT! beautiful view pool area olive trees gorgeous atrium    Service always perfect  use REAL SILVERware!   Reminds something European very cosmopolitan  phony real cafe real 5 star resort    <EOR> Only positive experience  Tuna salad amazing white Pino Gri decent  Prices average  service 5 stars! Would come again  <EOR> I ordered steak no flavor  very mediocre diner cafe  kind early catch La Reve 9 place pretty empty  <EOR> Sad story closing cafe canceling all culinary workers seniority even though restaurant 20 years since opening  Union isn't protecting?! Shame hotel owners mistreating hard working people loyally paid dues gave best place success  <EOR> For resort houses arguably best buffet Vegas some finest meals would think 24hr cafe would stand accolades location     Burger overcooked flavorless patty even fries dry less palatable     Their Cobb Caesar very plain doctored many overpriced Las Vegas dinner salads   If paying $13 rabbit food better ample contain all fluff! <EOR> This seriously terrible  know where Bellagio putting its money  actually ended eating because everywhere else busy  wish waited somewhere else  perhaps worse quality something you'd diner  Actually I'd rather eat diner  price ridiculous sub par diner food service awful  <EOR> I love Cafe Bellagio! eat every time visit Vegas  food good service   The price little higher most cafe's but Bellagio     Eat here! won't regret it! <EOR> OK  Located off conservatory Brellagio  OPen 24 7  place designed fuel people move them them back gambling    all relaxed je n'est sais quio ambiance  corporate food  Vegas  two lines plebes high rollers bit off setting  But all all OK  <EOR> This MUST visit when Las Vegas breakfast  Every time eggs Benedict  probably only thing ever order when back just because seriously best ever had!!

Grand LUX Cafe good but takes cake  must try all vegas locals tourists  <EOR> I very pleasant breakfast family boyfriend = Located Bellagio Conservatory Cafe great place breakfast brunch  However since legit line forms very quickly  line around 9 30 wait around 20 minutes before seated  wasn't bad but line much longer time left around 10 45 early if don't want wait!  When walk Cafe itself very large which great because allows seated more quickly but also disadvantage because waitresses cover greater number tables  waitress very nice but clear she overwhelmed took bit bring drinks other things requested   The food fabulous!! veggie omelette which came toast baked tomato hash browns  egg very fluffy yummy but way big person finish  usually fan hash browns but crispy outside nice soft inside!! toast great brought three mini containers jam choose used strawberry took rest home hehe = My dad ordered bowl fruit which nice selection strawberries melon kiwi berries pineapple  Both mom boyfriend eggs benedict which enjoyed mom actually liked hollandaise sauce which meant must good!!   All food tried fresh presented very beautiful classy manner  I'd definitely recommend breakfast brunch Cafe Bellagio!! <EOR> Came breakfast pretty good  long drive home satisfying enough hold all way back California  eat again <EOR> As far overpriced coffee guys ok    They also open late night snackages   Which why 3 stars  Because when late don't want call room service race down pj's stuff race back your room   Good thing being feeling locals used scurring Australian's pj's odd hours night scavanging food  <EOR> Writing Terrace Pointe Cafe Wynn made think place former leaving las vegas haunt  years couldn't leave strip without stopping shrimp artichoke salad lobster omelet  Unfortunately while restaurant still appears same restaurant knew loved its actually quite different least two favorite dishes were  omelet once perfect filled lobster asparagus couldn't take bite without getting some turned into watery mess only smidgen lobster something green suppose could asparagus tried cover lack lobster asparagus smothering cheese  omelet small pools water cheese oil floating around it  salad equally disappointing previous ones fresh cuts artichoke heart clearly replaced canned ones  former salad also loaded down shrimp fact sometimes thought much shrimp but grilled pesto sauce perfectly really could complain besides complains two much shrimp? bigger better newer salad 3 shrimp delicately placed bland crouton  thought maybe just put those three top decoration once removed over sized crouton would find usual bevy shrimp  wrong $18 00 bucks soggy arugula 3 shrimp bitter canned artichokes     We tried give place benefit doubt visit more time sincerely hoping just gone off day unfortunately case found ourselves paying breakfast didn't even want finish then driving home grumpy it  bad grandma inspired write strongly worded email decline quality  contacted manager spite offer buy breakfast made abundantly clear only standard food quality gone down management place also questionable  Even friendliness she blatantly unprofessional clearly no idea she talking distinct feeling talking somebodies girlfriend given job favor   Part whole dining experience pleasure walking through atrium Bellagio only reason gave extra star however honest remember thinking even atrium looks cheaper less thoughtful usual  say when Wynn opened Steve Wynn back Bellagio hire all former employees new place actually believe this  <EOR> I'm kind disappointing SUPER EXPENSIVE 3 eggs $13 bucks!! wow!! dennys ihop 2 plates eggs other stuff!!!

Yes restaurant totally full all three days Las Vegas week  food good consistent service excellent  known Julie Lito many years hear all apply new jobs  Why fix something broken? Maybe update restaurant but NY deli? cobb said hamburgers Steak omelets cinnamon roll french toast good  <EOR> This place better your average Grand Lux Cheesecake Factory    On scale alone think pretty good deal  prices higher but Vegas expect but think portions very good size  definitely finished meal food coma  chilean sea bass which good but wasn't fantastic  brother Rib Eye which thought cooked very very well  Atlantic Salmon alright  However think Bellini ? drink delicious! someone such low tolerance honestly say thought very tasty not good hardcore alcoholics impressed most place attention detail  ordered iced tea noticed ice cubes discolored  first thought GROSS dirty ice cubes but when told waiter he told ice cubes actually frozen ice tea cubes  did when your ice melts won't dilute your drink  Genius!!

She super helpful   Only reason why am giving 4 5 stars because hotel said would bring wine bottle table but never happened   Oh well   No harm done  wine somme gave fantastic   waiter professional warm  <EOR> Quite possibly worst service ever! Okay first off absolutely baffeled lack options 24 hour service Vegas Friday night Saturday morning    Yes 4 am Yes probably should bed but needed drunk food    So luck would ended Cafe Bellagio  service horrible almost walked out  never walked restaurant before but first  Luckily suppose food came gathering belongings almost hour wait seated    mean really hard grilled cheese sandwich quesadilla nachos  could managed better own kitchen It worked end considering only option presented but learned next night plan advance late night drunk food  <EOR> It's rather overpriced is   place nice because decent joint open 24 hours late night binge but other okay   friend raved over pancakes but just didn't see appeal   ordered cobb salad which very large portion though nothing exceptional opinion  <EOR> We starving search place breakfast decided find something Bellagio hotel    We kept following signs finally botanical gardens where distracted but quickly  saw restaurant while walking through Bellagio botanical gardens  checked menu Cafe Bellagio looked good choice breakfast!

Ambiance! All wonderful!   For starters ordered chips salsa  Chips fresh warm oven  Guacamole thick flavorful along salsa verde red sauce    For dinner ordered Bellagio's Penne Marinara creme penne  shrimp juicy plentiful  penne cooked al dente  sauce good similar taste call fat free if catch drift     Not same deep thick flavor Mama but regardless good    I also ordered Pomegranate Cherry Martini perfect mix sweet fruity flavor hint alcohol    Overall experience nice despite strange choice maintenance took having huge bobcat machine foyer Where garden separate cafe but right outside where hear see cleaning ceiling 11pm night     I rate food 4 stars drinks 4 5 decor ambiance service 5 stars    Thank Café Bellagio  <EOR> They no idea poach egg  eggs Benedict came nearly hard boiled eggs  Also terrible coffee  <EOR> There many things see way restaurant  Yes gets real crowded  botanical garden fight  through people taking pictures restaurant but love ambience there  Food OK nothing  spectacular   French onion  soup best vegas Thai salad bellagio spa breakfast also very good  <EOR> Good food but great service  Came work meeting company didn't treated very well  Just place order  People act didn't even see when literally no else waiting  Made feel bothering them chicken sandwich  If restaurant wasn't first ran into then would somewhere else  next time  also need more employees service being slow during downtime  <EOR> The service sucked  waitress took order never saw again  wave down another waiter see if could check he said waitress break   I waited tables years hell break when table?  The food okay service slow  <EOR> Great place brunch  Haven't gone dinner such but few times different trips ive gone brunch brrakfast good  Coffee delicious  Eggs bacon hashbrowns tasty filling fresher better any diner quality   Fruit platters ice cream salads also good  other words overall good  only downside thay gets bit pricey  if aren't trying spend much quick breakfast then place  Otherwise recommend wrote im sure ill find myself again whenever visit vegas future  <EOR> I must concur majority here     The setting's nice most certainly but 3 persons breakfast bill come $90 tax tip included better wowing your omelets Chef    didn't that    matter fact Classic Bellagio omelet lobster cheese only blah    lobster rubbery couldn't chew enough swallow    $16 gotta better that     Way better that!   Now wife's Spanish Chorizo breakfast better but I'd still only give 4 stars   They kickass coffee though laced something Cocaine Speed     wife bouncing off walls next 8 hours which quite entertaining actually!    Still I'd expected much higher food quality placed called Cafe Bellagio especially when ended costing $30 per person breakfast     Oh no no champagne there    all coffee OJ really doesn't explain high cost  <EOR> The chips salsa great! BLT fantastic! good service  must sat 35 40 minutes before even opportunity order  received bill before even received food  person came take order just shift change uniform look incredibly disorderly dirty  4 impressive place looks should far when help doesn't see should put value place good be  <EOR> We ate only because staying Bellagio couldn't second day buffet coffee  turns coffee worse Cafe service was    well no service  Over 15 min coffee point going super hard please fair warning  Another 15 min trip host counter someone take order then half hour cold food wasn't good buffet day before   Without might add single refill wretched coffee  worst experiences anywhere  buffet if must dine Bellagio hurry  Your best bet take tram over Aria all dining options fantastic  <EOR> If really enjoyed chill spot Bellagio right beside large garden  ate bar Monday morning lobster omlette    the cheese just right inside omlette lobster ok    I really just looking basic breakfast hashbrowns toast    and thats exactly got  Hashbrowns good   nothing greasy didn't feel bloated afterwards very peaceful little container honey your tea different jams  If just want basic breakfast isn't expensive defiantly come here  again if stay Bellagio  <EOR> Such beautiful place sit RELAX walking long strip Vegas  When your dogs killing sick fast food fancy nosh inhaled over budget sit nice change pace fresh salad sandwich   Right Bellagio Garden's nice stop late lunch relax veg out  seat overlooking gardens wait Sunday 20 min  Well worth if plan staying dine while  service okie doke but food fabulous  Elgant decor open seating allowing see within garden's  visual eye candy  Refreshing visually rewarding  <EOR> This restaurant just ok  very convenient hubby could walk right downstairs eat brunch  seated right away but way saw line wrapped around restaurant  Once seated given coffee water right away busser  waitress appeared 3 minutes later  ordered two steak egg meals medium rare  came perfectly cooked other came medium well sent back  Everything good but nothing wowed  restaurant looked well kept but fancy diner feel it  would say place perfect breakfast if looking leave resort grounds  most unique thing found restaurant give jam toast individual  mini jam jars keep  amazing but best part  However all all found pretty expensive quality  <EOR> The food wife ordered terrible  wife lobster bisque which salty practically inedible  seems soup heating all day probably burned off saltier end day  ordered southern fried chicken clear chicken re fried because wasn't crispy tender but rather dry soggy  Definitely isn't expected $26 dish  never coming back food  <EOR> We only place desserts coffee mid afternoon place awesome   It's really good big groups  round balconies overlooking botanical garden where usually some most spectacular displays  time easter display  Usually botanical garden crowded but balcony seating view garden without crowds surrounding you   Their desserts delicious especially fudge cake expensive $8 piece   Don't toffee pudding unless LOVE toffee coz good  But everything else tasty  made nice relaxed afternoon eat  Couple fountain show outside  <EOR> This place gets undeserved star because waiter nicest most professional met Las Vegas   Alfred class act      The food however dreadful  prix fixe    caprese salad featured icey flavorless tomatoes mozzarella seemed little dry    steak frite tolerable but served ketchup unknown brown sauce few cherry tomatoes inexplicably tossed top   steak done pretty well lone standout    Friends ordered mac cheese looked kraft some wings disgusting Buffalo Wild variety    Cocktails sweet but Las Vegas    If your tastes lean toward mass market chain restaurants bet you'll this   But Vegas competitive market higher expectations price point  <EOR> Having Vegas numerous work occassions come realize each hotel kind breakfast spot its guest   Cafe Bellagio seemed sit down breakfast dining feel definitely tell based line through garden wait   First hard find because Garden under construction but line should clued in   pretty early morning line there   Despite apparent hunger line pretty quickly though   let's say 20 30 minutes waiting   We promptly seated actually saw better table requested instead   host gracious enough accommodate split second decision   hostess nice guess point during service she done break scheduled she introduced new server would assist rest meal   It took while figure wanted because place couldn't just meal included bacon eggs pancakes formerly known Denny's Grand Slam breakfast    But once ready one omelet corn beef hash plate still wait server return   Sigh stomach growling   The food came all well hunger   particularly found toast perhaps most memorable part meal but did enjoy corn beef hash   Sadly overall experience Cafe Bellagio could better but wasn't   average waiting time actually place orders just pushed review little lower that   Another clincher lower score    2 orders orange juice that's 2 glasses equivalent price 1 entrees  <EOR> Pour le lunch nous cherchions un endroit près de l'hôtel  Finalement ce fut au Cafe de l'hôtel  Le sandwich Ruben etait excellent avec des frites croustillantes  Mes collègues ont aussi aimé leur sandwich au poulet  Le décor est superbe et le service fut très professionnel  Le restaurant est situé tout pres de la piscine  <EOR> I rather stupid here   ordered equivalent full English breakfast thought was   stupidity Vegas thought must dreaming down Old Kent Road  round bits reconstituted ham call Canadian Bacon oddly since its neither Canadian nor bacon furthermore quite possibly doesn't even come pig   Maybe Bellagio financed recently announced stem cell research where grew white meat add colouring tasting   All journo's hated it   The sausages anaemic looking white things waiter told mixture sausage meat turkey meat   menu called them bangers   Now any self respecting Brit knows banger certainly wasn't one   think might made scraps meat factory floor which course bangers but least they're right sort scraps   I chose fried eggs because then least see 3 separate eggs rather omelette made 100 gallon drum eggs which many industrial kitchens buy eggs BTW Michael Pollan told that    Unfortunately eggs under done could hardly eat them   From point things much better   waiter Anando saw forlorn expression offered change I'd done best eat little mother never let reject anything plate   swapped omelette which ok'ish but he also off serach numerous expressi machine down   fact Anando such charming guy he turned grumpy whinging pom bright cheerful chappie time left   Despite all efforts however can't bring myself give place more 1  <EOR> Breakfast service better lunch  food delicious both times  beautiful cafe more restaurant diner like menu  well situated atrium view pool  <EOR> Complete disappointment! given two stars simply view  ordered Cafe Benedict salty over cooked eggs bland hash browns  husband ordered eggs we're overdone salty  mimosas more oj sparkling considering bill came just over $62 including tax tip worst breakfast we'd Vegas  stick Hash House! <EOR> Went real late night meal around 3am wasn't crowded but guess didn't all tables open waited 15 mins finally seated  Service kinda slow food mediocre ordered quesadillas spicy chicken sandwich burger  All just average  can't complain much since meal free but probably would come if pay  <EOR> This place great option people neither want eat buffet nor drop ton $ lunch dinner  Very typical cafe fare  recommend spaghetti bolognaise  yummy surprise! tuna sandwich mehh  Fries terrific  server old gentleman nice helpful  <EOR> I'm sure what's all hotel cafe spots  food horrible service non existent   This spot 0 service serve didn't check once waited 40mins food   least food tasted decent   The servers some attitude issue which super annoying  <EOR> When your Vegas 24 hours its first time your parents meet parents your starving place works champaign brunch  eggs  she something else Mumm Napa flowed things well  Food pretty good too  <EOR> While staying hotel ate Cafe Bellagio number times  servers polite service prompt  menu selection quite limited but everything ordered delicious  <EOR> It's open 24 hours interior reasonably pretty   basically only thing keeping place business   The food bland indifferently prepared  similar Denny's flavor freshness  but waitstaff always cordial   We've eaten lot because lazy walk outside  only memorable part numerous visits creme brulee dessert  Prepared pretty curvy ramekins different flavors nicely caramelized top  <EOR> On recent stay Bellagio  March dined several times Cafe Bellagio  coming since opened 1998   usual  food excellent table service  always ask Lido server  He Bellagio since opened  Lido turned good dining experience into exceptional one   We Thursday special Fried Chicken golden crispy crust tender meat juicy all way through  meat full flavor just crust  Simple fried chicken done very well   came lighter air biscuits coleslaw gravy    secret wife discovered few

While price isn't cheap still great meal right next Conservatory! <EOR> We breakfast cafe   lobster omelette very good  Service fast wait staff friendly fun   Compared Bellagio Breakfast Buffet feel prices cafe little expensive  <EOR> During stay bellagio popped first night long drive  We all disappointed meals service ambience   A few things stood during meal It smelled strange carpet stinky filthy  smelled water cafeteria floor cleaning machine  Stinky  Over powering nauseating cigarette smell everywhere that's vegas   Our food all gray pale colourless along flavor  burger someone else pasta supposed pancetta   but gray  veggie sandwich served wet roll giant slimy  flavorless mushroom   couldn't finish it  French fries tasted exactly old cheapy mcdonalds fries  Blech! Our server nice but hardly ever available  It vegas prices but senior center flavorless food   Super diappointed  Don't eat even though easily accessible crowded  Its worth it  <EOR> If choose eat used call coffee shops you know 24 hour huge menu breakfast all day places then Cafe Bellagio nice come   It's luxurious sitting Cafe Bellagio peering into Conservatory having aromas flowers being able see all seasonal displays   If ask sit close Conservatory instead back restaurant where all see Keno screen   The service Cafe Bellagio great asked specifically watermelon fruit plate server made sure happened having someone run another kitchen aquire some      I would recommend Cafe Bellagio anyone wanting enjoy breakfast Conservatory anyone wants reasonably priced meal  <EOR> Since staying Bellagio ate twice  first meal steak mashed potatoes ok  But second time Grilled Salmon w Artichoke Hearts Kalamata Olives Mashed Potatoes Citrus Glaze   my oh my   that Salmon BEST Salmon dishes ever had  amazing  Other place could use some new carpeting but don't let stop you  food good  <EOR> Food lack luster  stayed Bellagio attending O show Bellagio 930 convenient place eat  Service friendly food didn't impress but convenient  <EOR> Me boyfriend came breakfast 2pm  ordered eggs Benedict Bellagio omelette cappuccino  Everything delicious didn't wait long all which wasn't problem because ambiance something special nice garden  <EOR> Out 4 dishes tried only above average  rest pretty average food premium prices  didn't matter portions massive because quality lacking    We ordered Reuben delicious! Just right amount meat sauerkraut buttery grilled bread  onion rings came fresh made delicious well   Bellagio's Classic Omelet omelet green peppers tomatoes lobster  barely any lobster when find rubbery tough  egg blah underseasoned  Hashbrowns ok though   Banana Foster waffle way sweet  eating mouthful sugar every bite      Smoked salmon w bagel smoked salmon OK but great   best quality teeny bit slimy  Came w cream cheese onions capers    Service OK  no need refills since huge coffee thermos filled placed right table  <EOR> Decided hit place friend quick lunch   place jam packed little bit line 1pm Monday   If opt sit counter don't wait line assuming there's room course   honest waitress wasn't all friendly friend high maintenance customers least bit   decided let bother wanted enjoy meal paid very little attention her   should rewarded bad disposition 15% tip instead 20% tip but hate being dick   The food excellent! sure why but really wasn't expecting much   Figured we'd average meal   everything Vegas portion sizes huge   friend ordered Turkey Club couldn't finish which good because needed bring lunch back husband   She wasn't fond cole slaw she said herb overpowering taste we think celery seed    ordered Tuscan Chicken Sandwich good!  Marinated grilled chicken lettuce tomatoes roasted yellow peppers pesto sauce all ciabatta bread   only thing missing good pickle!

Shocking dine Bellagio Cafe Denny's type experience    We hope management take reviews seriously changes food quality service ambiance  <EOR> I around 2pm no line! happy me!  Service excellent! server Susan sweet wish tipped more  start finish clean cut process  She tailoring every need  ordered braised short rib tiger shrimp cocktail The short rib good but sure would order again  shrimp comes 4 pieces  Unless feeling ballin day don't think again either All all food decent service beyond phenomenal! 5 stars Susan! <EOR> TERRIBLE DINING EXPERIENCE  Waiters lazy manager fails inform long wait split check bill  turn cost 39 extra minutes time because no would come table collect check  Poor management staff no time management   no respect your time  simple meal if want spend less hour having meal  Also poor quality food  <EOR> As stated other reviews place cheap but food decent setting relaxing because conservatory   breakfast would recommend guest staying Bellagio stayed little late night before  <EOR> They know cook basic good food  Came late night ordered some pasta dish could eat! spicy beyond belief! salad shrimp super cold chewy shrimp suppose warm horrible  ruin Cobb salad? can! No flavor bacon extremely hard tasted weird! took off pasta dish  should them taken everything off bill  back room ordered room service Vadara penthouse suite much much better  Never again cafe! Stay away! Any place else would've better! Bellagio lot money sure invest some good cooks! <EOR> Pros Seated quickly Sunday Brunch rush hour noon! Food great especially french fries  Ambiance beautiful restaurant overlooking courtyard Bellagio hotel   Cons Service terrible  ask diet cokes waters coffees multiple times before everyone party actually beverage place setting  Slow     took awhile food way but maybe because group 8? <EOR> Cafe Bellagio enjoyed pleasure business 4 am Friday Saturday weekend      On Friday Tryst brother shared chicken wrap french fries whole lot water  wrap pretty dry needed ketchup bearable  french fries salty yummy though! service fairly slow considering many other tables point evening  waiter willingly brought more little cups ketchup though when exhausted original supply   On Saturday Body English four waltzed very hungry  begged waiter please bring large food order asap deliver biggest glasses water available  yummy bread basket quickly appeared which definitely offered night before    sampled vegetarian omelet more frecnh fries chicken quesadillas french onion soup  french onion soup surprisingly perfect 4 morning snacking but omelet really dry boring    Cafe Bellagio gets late night eating job done but far good Planet Hollywood's 24 hour diner! also expensive chicken wrap $14 boring omelet $13 french onion soup $8 etc    <EOR> I'm sure if 5 stars count when you're wasted bottle service but surprised say disagree 3 stars  Then again maybe drunk critiquing   This review last trip Vegas last November lead close friend local accidentally wrong restaurant  many drinks too? server kind scary but really knowledgeable menu all gave great service  Since 3 morning chose pancakes friend Gena fettuccine Alfredo  forgot man two other guy friends but both mine Gena's food phenomenal!!!  The pancakes some fluffiest tastiest pancakes ever had! still dream them today next time try them sure am drunk because would hate opinion change  bite Gena's Alfredo well aaaaamaaazing! Love love love place  3am food doesn't any better then place trust gone many different places Vegas time looking food drinks    5 drunken stars! <EOR> I ate twice during course stay Bellagio   The first time line quite long once front waited felt eternity before sat spite quite few empty tables   But once sat down weren't disappointed   food wonderful   mom ordered best french onion soup ever tasted simply delicious club sandwich   asked chips but waiter brought french fries    glad he did because excellent usually don't fries   prices bit high especially mother's iced tea $4 50! but food good didn't feel ripped off   The second time no line all   ordered same thing except each french onion soup split club   soup wasn't quite good first time but still excellent   sure ask breadsticks they're free but won't bring them unless ask  <EOR> Blecch!  would mediocre food half price   But if you're feelin' good shelling $15 $20 humdrum corned beef hash tasteless omelet place you!  adding tasteless lobster omelet still doesn't justify price  plain mushroom chives omelet taste better serve here   Also butter use fry hash browns didn't smell quite right couldn't dodge smell no matter much shifted head around   They also seem understaffed   service while friendly really slow   You're better off hopping onto cab getting burgers N Out  <EOR> I came party 2 asked wait another group 3 came hostess them enter first    Disappointed service here  <EOR> Nothing special Cafe Bellagio  Expensive cafe offer    The gfs dish excellent  Shrimp rice some sort cream sauce  $26 plate well worth it   My homemade meatloaf just safe pick  Tasted any other meatloaf dish ever ate  Props presentation though  $17 should paid extra 9 gfs dish    Casual dining expensive price  <EOR> We graced Cafe Bellagio presence 4am Saturday night Tryst    sure thrilled    That being said well collected rather considering most 4am crowd  ordered late night fare promptly asked some water well    Then waited    And waited    And waited    And watched groups seated served  just decided walk It's something which NEVER done but lack service getting down right offensive when food came out  mediocre best except French Fries water  also very expensive! paid around $15 greasy bland chicken quesadilla  next night nixed cafe ordered pancakes room service instead much better same price! <EOR> Amazing food  service always great! Good all times day  boyfriend actually twice day  Once breakfast then again dinner  delicious both times  portions very generous price just right atmosphere taste dishes service  very short wait breakfast ended opting sit bar because open seating starving  fresh squeezed orange juice delicious  gotten omelet before great  time eggs Benedict which all very good! comes hash browns  liked didn't choose wanted egg  just cooked perfection runny inside but white cooked throughly which enjoy  hate when runny whites eggs Benedict  did perfectly! flavor great  proceeded day breakfast came back later dinner before seeing O Bellagio  looking restaurant hotel but nothing looked good going back Cafe Bellagio!! very good house blend coffee  actually coffee dinner because tired already show wasn't until 10pm  server Fernando F  excellent  wanted some mixed fruit salad dinner  ordered oriental chicken salad amazing!! also huge though boyfriend should shared it! He applewood cobb salad which also huge  He said good well  fruit going order fruit cup but when asked waiter big he said little small  He recommended fruit bowl which bigger bigger variety fruit it  Everything fresh ripe just perfection! just looking lighter dinner option  bring basket bread dinner  always ice water too  nice refreshing Vegas when 1000 degrees out! waiter said its open 24 7! definitely making 3rd trip vacation!! <EOR> My fiancé stopped very late dinner  Quite honestly very few places open beyond 11 PM within casino decided give try  seated promptly  drink orders taken  Soon waiter came take order  ordered veggie burger fiancé ordered French onion soup  food slow come out  looked around noticed other patrons seated already served  waiter Kong came table apologize long wait  He informed kitchen run veggie patty send someone room service area veggie patty  When food came veggie patty different ordered but okay  When Kong returned he informed would charged meal because long wait  He also offered dessert house  very appreciative excellent customer service  food average but customer service exceptional  didn't even complain but Kong recognized inconvenienced way right  <EOR> Want Steak Eggs cheap?  Don't come here   But if don't mind paying $15 00 Eggs Benedict great view garden then definitely place   way laid feels Fine Dining restaurant   Normally cafe looks regular average restaurant   look tops them all   tables laid long off white table clothes decorated gold silverware   even nice water glasses almost looks want serve wine it   lighting brightness but overpowering   Plus view garden romantic feel want date   But know really date place because Cafe's normally hangover joint   Since late ordered food finishing up   cousins friends already complaining service   guess lady didn't come back see if alright didn't take plates when done    big deal but guess everyone's different     My cousin never eaten Eggs Benedict loved tasting order   She ordered Tuna Salad Sandwich but wasn't impressed it   chicken salad looks mediocre nothing special looking it     So overall average Cafe masked look Fine Dining Restaurant   Food Service just any other Cafe average   But know what?  Just because view Garden restaurant would definitely take towners just ambiance  <EOR> We came eat cafe Bellagio around 10 pm during week July   bit line but food comp didn't wait   When seated however didn't see server quite while   drinks good food just decent slightly overpriced but very pretty view Bellagio gardens   food comp review would probably drop star  <EOR> Yeah overpriced chocolate flavored water = hot chocolate Bellagio Café     If you're looking hot chocolate best place found Coffee Bean inside Planet Hollywood    your cocoa then walk over fountains enjoy  <EOR> I gone place every time am looking good decent meal   guess am going good time every time later night because usually don't any issues getting table within 10 15 minutes even right away   food good better any fast food prices actually reasonable Bellagio     Service just OK comfortable seating  <EOR> If your staying Bellagio good brunchy place     Food Ok   Try Bellagio Omelet very good     would special trip another hotel eat here   convenience Bellagio  <EOR> Located Bellagio Hotel Las Vegas Cafe Bellagio   review over due can't remember if came lunch dinner   LOL  Anyhow good friend really enjoyed food   shared bacon cheddar burger braised short rib dip sandwich   Yum!!!  Good food good company clean restaurant friendly staff reasonable prices good service more ask for?  definitely back here  <EOR> My recent visit Vegas included many trips Cafe Bellagio  All trips delightful except where husband managed bum waiter didn't think big deal food hadn't shown 45 minutes ordering he hadn't even offered bread mean time  When mentioned manager she said unacceptable stormed off but didn't offer any form compensation nor did she update when food would arriving   That said all other visits sublime  Great service good food fancy pants hotel Bellagio pretty good prices  French toast delicious cobb salad pretty great omelet tasty   All all if you're Bellagio want pop say it! chances you'll weirdo waiter? <EOR> We coupon Café Bellagio located right off beautiful Bellagio gardens  brunch plans sidelined the Eiffel Tower restaurant result came little sad low expectations pleasantly surprised! Plus obviously much cheaper original choice   Their non alcoholic smoothies DELICIOUS crab eggs benedict excellent  really don't any bones pick meal except little sliced tomato side  merely because don't juicy raw tomatoes wish oven cured when wasn't  Otherwise place exceeded expectations  Even without coupon prices weren't terrible  I'd say great option if want nice little meal tide over rather extravagant one   I suppose if pick bone merely lacks pizzazz wow factor  But don't think hotel cafe even if Bellagio's  <EOR> By fourth visit Cafe Bellagio all comped thank God well prepared crappy meal  Circus Circus crappy but kind crappy feel when you've finished eating mediocre food remember you're Bellagio    Rather repeat past mistakes forewent is word? crab cakes meat sauce spaghetti ordered dish never tried restaurant before wiener schnitzel   Before think ordered chili cheese dog let say wiener schnitzel actually deep fried veal patty  Deep fried  Veal  could possibly wrong?  The first few bites fine until breading started come off    when witnessed horror  meat patty underneath golden crust looked shriveled gray skin alien cadaver   I grossed didn't even take picture  guy photographs own food poisonings     The price tag delicacy $28  If I'd paying own money I'd sent back but just stopped eating   Bumped star because free  <EOR> Nostalgia smoothies  admit sweet spot Cafe because first place ever ate Las Vegas first time now husband  first road trip    special  don't remember ate    But don't worry review experience 7 some odd years ago! eaten since then if catch good service job done  actually grilled vegetable sandwich vegetarians take note  Ultimately would probably never stand line dine here    Most recently however developed Cafe Bellagio smoothie habit  Yes $7 Strip robbery a close relative highway robbery but better decor but Tropical Mango smoothie delicious  may seem minor thing but other casino cafe smoothies flavorless only good leaving seeds your teeth  friend  If you're willing accept premium price bypass line march counter order smoothie to go  doesn't merit special trip but if you're Bellagio need smoothie here's answer! <EOR> Cafe Bellagio stereotypical American cafe big windows display beautiful gardens  When arrived around 1PM semi large line  don't understand why since more enough empty tables seat least half line maybe they're saved diamond members?   Anyway just observation moving forward      We seated friendly hostess  Immediately drink orders taken followed food orders  food took while arrive but fair portions quite large presentation both simple but elegant  ordered braised short rib dip  sandwich stuffed beef tomato caramelized onions cheese  side came fries au jus dip  could've more salty but just personal preference    The service overall slow though  Food took half hour arrive another ten minutes call waiter check  waiters waitresses kind but think only your waiter take your orders and or questions if ask other waiters waitresses ignored  But friendly if they're your server!  Food 4 5  Service 3 5  Overall 3 5 nothing special though  <EOR> This review drinks only    So walking down strip two hours feet needed extreme rest   Cafe Bellagio perfect choice quick pick up   Robusto which intresting cocktail made XO Cafe Patron   very tasty   service really nice suggest stopping by! <EOR> Great place dine eat almost anytime   enjoyed rib eye cooked perfectly side very fresh crispy green beans   also great amount bread help soak all vodka red bulls consumed throughout night    We ate 3a m  morning perfect time dinner Vegas   service fast staff nice best all food perfect  <EOR> Ambience nice food service much    I ordered live well omelet  egg whites fluffy but lobster nearly non existent  Every time thought saw piece turned tomato  Asparagus plentiful    The fruit comes cantaloupe only even tho description mixed fruit includes berries seasonal fruit  Cantaloupe literally only fruit don't I'm picky eater   When asked if different fruit answer honeydew cantaloupe ONLY  Then should say served melon fruit  waiter also accommodating when husband asked onions hash browns saying already come onions  didn't see any    On upside beautiful view gardens coffee good  better server could've changed experience  <EOR> Not wanting fight buffet line high prices other Bellagio restaurants recommended Cafe Bellagio  asked server light lunch wasn't salad recommended chicken tenders appetizer  some restaurants chicken tenders would meal  Cafe Bellagio 2 half chicken strips     10 dollars  exactly meal thinking would be  decided give deserts try  really cool three way creme brule hazelnut pistachio vanilla creme brule  great way desert because variety pretty good   If back might just desert  Great atmosphere though  Very comfortable  outside weak recommendation staff all nice attentive  <EOR> For breakfast brunch yourself favor skip coffee Garden bloody Mary bloody mary mix spiked celery carrot juice course pepper vodka   garnished perfect crispy pickle   die for   Nothing couple soothe your head morning after   To eat recommend Maine Lobster asparagus mozzarella omelet    16 50 didn't anticipate finding any meat but plenty  no shell deal which huge bonus     If you're mood pub food must try chicken tenders    if sort food ever 5 stars would taste these  <EOR> My group ate Friday holiday weekend night arrival all pretty hungry well past normal dinner time   great service minute arrived hostess seated two servers   ordered thai lettuce wrap greek salad both well seasoned fresh lettuce delicious chicken the lettuce wraps yummy sauces dressings   My oldest ordered filet added lobster half tail steak perfect medium much sauce good seasoning   Youngest ordered ham cheese omelette arrived wonderfully fluffy full ham     My daughter's boyfriend ordered bacon cheeseburger kid hardly ever see eat?  He polished entire thing off don't know if he just super hungry if he enjoyed much both   He's kinda quiet     Overall lovely experience would definitely return future if see myself staying Bellagio again  <EOR> As far prices strip cheaper options am using word lightly  quick stop breakfast lunch before hitting pool able sit 10 extremely quickly which much appreciated! Tuscan sandwich table split few carafes light refreshing sangria  Everything while nothing special meets expectations  wouldn't way but if staying big B then place hits spot casual meal  <EOR> This far best place eat Vegas  I say first hand eaten 10+ times food always great consistent  People complain wait line still seem think food good    GREAT food worth wait why cafe line   For food strip beats them all line indicator its popularity  <EOR> Had great experience Cafe Bellagio during business trip  set lunch client consisted 13 people  important table set properly specific types coffee fruits drinks  also imperative least few waiters stand all times during course lunch   Everything perfect time fast  lunch meeting proceeded waiters operated without disturbing meeting yet always there to take orders keep everything replenished  also someone restaurant entrance greeting late clients bringing them table taking orders way there    Great experience  <EOR> 5 girls hungry wanted bite before started journey back OC pulled over @ bellagio   after smelled lovely flowers saw line cafe bellagio   long but would do  LUCKILY stepped into line hostesss came around saying 5?? 5?? anybody party 5?? thats when jumped saying 5 here!!!!! seated QUICK  table ordered pulled pork sandwitch french toast sausage steak eggs caramelized grapefruit yogurt parfait penne pasta   our server really sweet lady she claimed pasta BEST CHOICE!!  the pasta was    alright   sauce wasnt world plus I SOME BAD LUCK PASTA! pasta tad overcooked  girls tasted confirmed wasnt crazy lil mushy   blah but edible  the brownsugar coated grapefruit yum parfait yummiest fruits granola!  everyones food looked alright  lady substituted friends toast steak eggs bread basket table which didnt rock nebodys world   it MEh bread   i expected more food  but service superb! btw iono whats goin but wen home saw did charged $70 debit now check today charge gone now im charged $12 cafe bellagio   wtheck? <EOR> Pricey very touristy but food drinks good  Old world hotel style but beautiful view pools nice weather  <EOR> Who possibly forget place chocolate fountain above your head various chocolates?

Maybe if didn't any choices eat late night if food beverage credit hotel then yes would option    Minus 2 stars menu pricing  <EOR> Best reuben sandwich ever had   nice table conservatory view  <EOR> I ordered crab cake egg benedict tasted decent  problem food tend put everything onto plate  dish ham well crab cake cheese eggs salads  Its just much onto plate dont compromise taste  basically its just big portion FOOD nothing say terms flavors  <EOR> Limited menu speedy service  Good breakfast options killer eggs Benedict try fresh crabmeat top  operational hours place very convenient never closing which plus  strawberry banana smoothie best ever had  Wish still keno though Bring back Vegas heavens sake!! <EOR> This first time staying Bellagio when late night munchies hit Cafe Bellagio best option  seated lovely hostess honored request big booth even though am alone  server friendly food fantastic! really enjoyed ambiance very comfortable love dim lighting  absolutely back!   5 stars all way! <EOR> We ate breakfast Cafe Bellagio nice time! ordered ham three eggs food BOMB! bread bread basket also individual jams  Even coffee amazing! definitely pricey side meal $16 coffee extra $5  But Vegas pricing sort expected cheaper other places Bellagio  <EOR> We staying Bellagio friends birthday weekend breakfast decided try cafe Bellagio  good choice!

Probably best eggs benedict awhile friend loved spaghetti she picky when comes spaghetti   The bad course price since strip lines!

Because just felt drinking some orange juice but then turned $7 50 without any refills  orange juice supposedly freshly squeezed which probably why charge much  However you're better off getting some orange soda free refills your moneys worth  being cheap but damn $7 50!

End story  <EOR> For all press Bellagio gets I'd think signature cafe' would great experience  wasn't  even close   The hostess rude referring rather disparagingly front entire crowd  She didn't clue handle crowd one place wasn't even busy    The service sub par food    meh    If ever back Bellagio stay we'll stay clear Cafe' until unless better staff  <EOR> I would give service star  twice stay both times took way long any type service   However would give 5 stars meal had! Perhaps fact starved perhaps alcohol but no exaggeration best meal ever entire life!  I only attest things personally ate  Half pound Angus burger amazing! ordered medium well wasn't very pink just way it came order fries  $15 price tag bit hefty but don't feel money wasted  Even ranch incredible!
