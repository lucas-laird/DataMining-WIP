Anyway Glutton fits perfectly vibe those other joints really good food drink boot  The inside semi industrial lots windows look empty lot haha growth future! there's lots pedestrians days too!!   We started off drinks friendly server informed happy hour 4 30 6 30 not sure days definitely Wednesdays 2 1 beers wines well drinks  Yay!

The steak served little bit creamy delicious mashed potatoes some avocado jalapeno topping  am big fan avocado but loved little salsa  added creamy spicy sweetness meat  Very good  Woodfired shrimp Good shrimp but kinda standard  Half chicken did try but dining companion stated excellent  Wish would tried pickled tomatoes!  For 5 adults 2 kids drinks $150  think  pretty reasonable   Added points having woman playing guitar singing Wednesday!  The only problem many great places downtown sure when back! <EOR> Boozy Brunch? Count in  Glutton excellent choice weekend cocktails grub  Located beautiful space corner Carson 6th which appears become hotspot eating downtown surprised weren't more people taking advantage recently launched weekend brunch promotion    Dyanna ate Glutton Saturday morning  part visit only customers there  could see group people waiting seated another eatery across street almost felt sorry them clearly no idea missing Glutton    The service received excellent would expect almost empty restaurant  started off Morningshade chilled coffee drink tequila cinnamon vanilla orange     Very reminiscent Mexican coffee couldn't taste any tequila all easy drink concoction    I love good waffle unable pass special day Peaches Cream waffle  Perfectly cooked topped delicately sliced delicious peaches mound whipped cream very generous drizzling bourbon syrup     I don't downtown often but delicious weekend brunch offered Glutton going hard stay away from  <EOR> Amazing!
