AYCE meat buffet unusual   oh yea salad bar <EOR> 1st time ever restaurant   meats cooked nicely seasoned right   Many BBQ Steakhouses easily under over cook meats usually under seasoned   My only gripe would selection should include brisket pork tenderloin crusted cheese  <EOR> Best food service ever experienced   sides amazing meats   WOW   chicken ribeye sirloin filet mignon   All cooked perfection full flavor   filet mignon felt heaven mouth   husband all above pork ribs which tender literally fell off bone  wait staff superb   Never empty glass even half empty   Also should meat server come he didn't wanted simply mentioned wanted within minutes back your request   price high but opinion well worth amount Quality food  pleased even left biggest tips ever given two person meal   continue visit when come yearly conferences   highly recommend everyone meet  <EOR> First time here  place awesome  food amazing!  little pricey but worth it  staff very friendly attentive  explained everything worked  constantly brought more meat drinks never empty  place classy owner checked twice sure everything fine  would definitely recommend restaurant  <EOR> Great place eat meat special occasions! Probably much if you're vegetarian vegan   Had shrimp cocktail beginning meal offered worth it? Eh  I'd probably save room meats   Tried several kinds meats think favorites garlic sirloin chicken leg    Unfortunately 'flip card meat served' system wasn't quite working least table  Perhaps location which seated but seemed non existent servers  same servers would come offering same meats but took bit time flag down others haven't tried  When did try some cuts sometimes no longer warm understandably since servers walking around them while    If your first visit haven't ever tried cheese puff bread tip DON'T  addicting little bastards reaching them another  prepared myself all day having small lunch going long run fill myself all meats  Unless know you're going able restrain yourself minimal amount puffs just say no magical cheesy balls puff    On more serious note service particular location quite disappointing  often overlooked effort meats served even glass water refilled  <EOR> I usually Texas de Brazil but thought would give Fogo de Chao try   husband ordered ice tea tasted terrible very bitter   He asked if he could exchange diet coke waiter came back told he would charge both ice tea that sip missing diet coke   opinion  just poor customer service   end meal okay   salad bar okay but impressive   opinion would rather Texas de Brazil   atmosphere food service better  <EOR> This exactly meathead wants dinner! Meat meat more meat! When you're Las Vegas large group would perfect high end atmosphere large tables groups friends family  high end Brazilian steak house serves all eat delivered your table simply turning over red green card indicate watchful eye servers want more meat delivered! come running! Houston Texas location also they're consistently awesome time time again  offer largest selection steaks such brisket top sirloin tenderloin filet mignon all included along lamb chicken pork  All meats slow cooked smoked Brazilian style  night 56 bucks person all handle steaks Vegas vibrant atmosphere located right off strip Flamingo its worth value  <EOR> I love place   it comes close Texas de Brazil only thing parking situation   Everything else great!  love fact give sides keep replenishing it!  price decent but during restaurant week am sure real price is   But some place would back again!  lamb ok but sirloin everyone's favorite!  coffee good desserts all yummy   Because group try almost everything   Papaya ice crea flan creme burlee chocolate molten cheesecake strawberries Everything really good sweet!  papaya ice cream very settle sweet but would let marinate your mouth recogonize flavors   would suggest put much raspberry sauce   cheesecake very rich but bad way texture smooth melts away your mouth   chocolate molton just enough chocolate without overwhelming your taste buds both flan creme burlee perfect!  texture righ amount sweetness!

I'd believe no way around long line but just nice know ahead time IMO  Preparing pre dinner cocktail  something    <EOR> The 13 caipirinhas drink menu kind  Made real fruit unlike some competitors use fruit concentrate flair  food typical brazilian over 15 types meats  salad bar fair best but when meat all you can eat cares? staff very friendly always stops good story joke  love going special occasion! <EOR> Great place try different cuts meat seasoned Brazilian style  experience sitting down start drinks buffet nice way dine but feels more attempt sell very marked wine  Some buffet items good apple salad basil sauce smoked salmon but best thing experience learning love filet minon tenderness  However realized then although tender very flavorful explains why use lot seasoning then wrap bacon  would say if meat lover want try different meats  Otherwise spend $50 nice cut butcher cook home  <EOR> I several Brazilian Steakhouses several states great chain  prices reasonable lunch kids love it   took relatives lunch impressed when home drove almost two hours dine closest Fogo   I favorite Brazilian steakhouse Chicago which consider 5 star  Fogo close favorite pretty close! really bad Braz Steakhouses where meat dry old  Fogo definitely meat always juicy choices amazing   The salad bar careful zone  good careful fill before meat sides come  guest mentioned she would happy just salad bar she impressed    Kids really love Brazilian steak houses  love watching meat choices being slid off big swords  eyes light when see servers walking around long swords meat  sure lot adults same thrill well    Fogo de Chao definitely carnivore's haven! <EOR> Meat lovers paradise  Service food wonderful    Salad  bar plentiful  many types meats prepared  perfectly   little pricey prepared  spend some money but worth every penny   Great wine selections  <EOR> This place joke  made reservation 7 when arrived seated right away  seated near entrance kitchen see meat coming out  Waiter told 66 different types meat  excited try them! night tried 6 different types meat  saw other types meats leave kitchen but never reached table     The side dishes bland gross  gave place star because least waiter nice helpful  tax tip  $70 waste money   And matters worse food poisoning place  stuck bathroom all night!

Absofruitly  <EOR> Great service great food great everything!  place beats big names strip far      Bring your taste buds appetite! <EOR> This going long story   So 1st Brazilian churrascaria Fogo de Chao Chicago back 2009   awesome   Probably greatest eating experiences ever had   Since then ventured many other churrascarias read Texas de Brazil review always compared them 1st time   Well delight when visiting Vegas saw Fogo de Chao finally opened location here   invited friend Angela eat here   she's never churrascaria pretty excited   I book reservations online opening dinner time 1700   really easy no issues booking   actually early sat bar   took look special menu caipirinhas asked bartender recommendations were   He pretty awesome because he actually told order certain drinks because he thought didn't mix well recommended premium caipirinha   decided order melon flavored one   both weren't bad but honestly didn't think amazing   If you've never give shot   Myself think pass future   We didn't sit long before told table ready   sat down 1st thing noticed dimly lit lights were   Almost strip club little strange   clearly see food eating   Well meat ensemble started in   16 different meats served tonight   Admittedly some meats really salty left thirsting water pretty bad afterwards but still pretty outstanding overall   Some meats definitely better others     You also served three sides table   Garlic mashed potatoes fried banana fried yucca think   They're pretty outstanding   yucca super crunchy potatoes garlicky banana really sweet   only problem sides you're focused eating meats sides tend cold definitely just don't taste good   So really start beginning me   think finally hit wall   39 years old now body's really starting fight back   mean?  ate ton food night massive amount meat   thought going die meat poisoning   meat really stuck hard mid section stomach? crazy heavy rest night   honestly just don't think anymore   Just done eating much meat   Yep over hill   Sigh   So what's solution?  Why even mention all this?  Because if you're carnivore invited come eat order just salad bar $20   great deal   If lived worked close would probably least 1 month   Maybe even lunch   salad bar awesome   Something 30+ selections bar   Bar 20 feet long different selections both sides   Really outstanding selections food all really good   even plate just fried bacon!  salad topping   Kinda crazy almost wanted grab entire plate looked good   Finally dessert ordere papaya cream flan   flan outstanding   Flan usually dense drippy really hard balance two perfect flan   it   Really just perfect   Amazing   papaya cream?  Wow almost eating ice cream except not   pretty awesome   Definitely give try   So finally end two $150   Oh give military discounts!  paid less that   Though actually messed discount   suppose 10% off bill $152 $147   Oh well     So if still haven't tried churrascaria yet live Vegas you've now two outstanding choices choose from   Texas de Brazil  <EOR> I group  little disappointed small selection meats brought did service each table equally  Then cycled through desert seemed annoyed when done eating requesting more meat  Even if group thing still all eat meat house! Unfortunately eaten other Brazilian meat restaurants town much better selections service  still gave 4 stars taste  <EOR> We large group 17 early dinner team Fogo de Chao nothing short amazing   couple small children accommodating     The food meaty delicious   salad food bar superb!

What's love that?  The meat quality good overall plenty it   loved brought plates pao de queijo mandioca fried yucca root fried plantain   fact served Antarctica guarana another plus   However negative points having two favorites churrascaria grilled pineapple chicken hearts   Overall good experience though definitely left full! <EOR> Great bananas!

Meats well seasoned simply delicious  salad bar many other items delicious well  loved Brazilian cheese bread lamb! normally don't eat lamb but actually most tasty meat night!

Then even charged cake didn't order? borderline fraud charging customer something DIDN'T ask for  If want give cake because birthday celebration should house  Don't just put tab charge us!! am giving Fogo bad rating because underhanded doing that  am willing change rating if correct this  <EOR> Great place eat friendly staff  lots meat cooked perfection clean much better pampas  <EOR> Love cheese bread! Meat great usual  expect say yelp? unlimited grilled steaks perfect seasoning  Well did large party when service bit slow stop somebody passing when needed stuff  flan delicious thought would be  pretty plain overwhelming caramel sauce <EOR> Protein  Sodium  More Protein  More Sodium  More more protein  some more sodium     But all enjoy salad bar which hope fill first prior eating lots lots very expensive protein served very large vertical 3 prong forks loaded lots sodium served cut tableside temperature your liking   I've done all dem chain churrascarias Fogo ranks near top far large chains go  selection seems consistently larger others protein upon various visits around 48 less sodium er    Their salad bar larger selection seafood cocktails cheeses antipasti crudites keep veggie folks happy   They solid 4 Yelps consistency being less sodiumey rest chains     But far Churrascarias Plataforma Manhattan heart  MMMMmmmmm chicken hearts   yes!
