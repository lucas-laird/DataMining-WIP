My husband stopped lunch large restaurant nearly empty  friendly server brought bowl salted corn kernels like naked Corn Nuts when told new customers she brought tablet show pictures various dishes  Although menu fairly descriptive images helped show differences between seafood preparations  For appetizers split papa la Huanciana boiled potatoes yellow pepper cream sauce palta relleña avocado stuffed potatoes mayonnaise chicken two traditional cold dishes seemed something you'd eat picnic  both great own but even better spicy garlic pepper sauce server provided   For entrees lomo saltado stir fried rib eye strips tomatoes peppers onions served sides french fries white rice   traditional Peruvian dish but didn't stand me almost felt Hawaii all starchy sides! husband fared much better tacu tacu con mariscos mixed seafood fish sauce served fried rice bean patty   We're usually big fans octopus squid but sauce fantastic side dish tasty addition   They don't serve alcohol Inca Kola which golden cream soda husband Kola Inglesa which tasted lot Big Red  both preferred Inca Kola while pretty sweet  something would try again   I read Peruvian food lots Asian influences certainly case soy sauce beef dish fish sauce seafood  Latin American flavors reminded more Cuban food traditional Mexican  Portions large but bit pricey lunch next time think stick appetizers and maybe split entree plenty options I'd love try   The restaurant cute yellow green logo appears sign business cards  bad interior building looks '50s diner red white chrome would look much better same theme inside    Although server friendly helpful service little slow  ask water several times took while bill  But if time leisurely meal want try something ordinary Lima Limon worth visit  <EOR> Lima Limon where all life? ceviche mixto perfect balance citrus seafood spices  Peruvian ceviche very different Mexican ceviche still raw come very open state mind  <EOR> i am New Jersey dying some peruvian food   this restaurant must  food delicious  service thumbs place clean  coming again <EOR> Delicious Peruvian food!

Inca Cola really good well  definitely return! <EOR> Got takeout dinner lomo saltado stuffed avocado  Called order 8PM told ten minutes arrived 15 still waited another 10  big deal gave time take décor   I'm sure why whoever opened restaurant sell Peruvian food didn't bother remodel he interior  Even just painting red portions walls trim yellow green match logo business cards would huge step more cohesive theme   Finally food headed home hoping lack Peruvian influence décor going repeated kitchen  But least partially surprised quality food lomo saltado plentiful portion thankfully pricetag $14 peppers onions steak strips over overwhelming portion fries served alongside white rice  rice actually very good  Despite appearing any seasoning flavorful moist without being wet   Loved using soak extra juices steak onion sauté  However agree other reviews say steak could more tender  The stuffed avocado perhaps most underwhelming Peruvian dish ever paid $7 for  avocado even ripe mashed potato chicken mayo mixture bland homogenous point where could find chicken dish  sure why highly recommended other reviews maybe just off day   Side note creamy looking red salsa sauce surprisingly flavorful   quite bit kick it! Definitely but use sparingly until figure if take heat   Edited add subtracting additional star because sick stomach shortly posting 10 minutes finishing meal continue feel queasy  <EOR> The food great  during lunch wasn't busy only few tables taken but waited 45 minutes food all entre two appetizers  would expected long wait if would packed  liked food though but could much better service  <EOR> Best ceviche since travelled Peru years ago  Very authentic great helpings lomo saltado anticuchios which delicious  Service very warm perhaps overly attentive! Decor authentic suppose p but doesn't compromise eating experience  <EOR> Went group 12 people dinner  large venue while few other tables 5 6 people plus few people booths service great  Server forget name recommended several items table let pa rouse Samsung Tablet all photos menu items  Loved corn nuts complimentary table  second round them came steaming hot even better 1st  diners born Peru he said real deal authentic Peruvian food  many items menu would try back try more  Ordered Seafood Platter not menu but picture menu $39 99 enough 2 people well Stuffed Avocado appetizer menu  all great  House green sauce great but more mild spicy  Excellent fried calamari yucca  back! <EOR> I've driven place YEARS just recently Ceviches 505 Miami looking something similar take back vacation  Let start off saying place GOOD  mean REALLY GOOD  food amazing wasn't single bite wouldn't recommend  Here's why gave 4 stars service SLOW slightly terrible  if hired family friends wait staff people literally no service experience very hospitable    I'd feel welcomed similar when most locals spots adding another table help such inconvenience  being said absolutely eat again just trying figure if should order possibly order ahead time  <EOR> I love shrimp Alfredo seafood soup here   very different delicious   would come again without hesitation   Great service well  <EOR> Food super delicious but waiter time isn't very good checking if doing ok if need something  example front restaurant ask anything extra may need napkins extra plate etc  <EOR> Ceviche delicious    Sweet corn drink also definitely coming back know new place but extra person front house helping waitress would improve service <EOR> Great food  But shit service  fact shitty ass waiter thought he deserved $33 tip hilarious  tip well all time but guy horrible  bad mood ask soda he didn't even give time order  Would just walk away  manager try feel guilty when she took tip away  didn't give shit cause he didn't deserve $33  Shitties service ever  won't coming back place service reason  1 guy ruined me  <EOR> Way expensive is  Ceviche fresh way much onion enough fish anticuchos smelled weird extremely hard  Leche de Tigre horrible  <EOR> Non existent service   sure food amazing but they're clearly under staffed don't seem care much  Ah well  do? <EOR> Very mediocre Peruvian food   place really funny smell which case prevents enjoying any meal    We ordered Bistec lo pobre meat good all   extra seasoned would taste better but didn't   plantains bad which found taste them   Rice good french fries     Peruvian food delicious upsetting don't decent Peruvian restaurant Las Vegas   Honeslty NONE  <EOR> #1 family owned Peruvian restaurant Las Vegas  Staff always welcoming open accommodating your meal your liking  bring girlfriend whenever craving peruvian cuisine  Definitely recommend Ceviche Mixto lomo saltado  try Inca Cola your meal   ultimate meal Seafood platter sufficient two  tried every peruvian restaurant LV favorite! owner very humble respectful  <EOR> Love love love !!!!! Best food Vegas must try ! Usually waiting 10 min seated but def worth food amazing <EOR> Let preface review saying never Peruvian food before unfortunately can't comment authenticity food    This restaurant recommended friend claiming best Peruvian food Vegas boyfriend decided would check out  location little unappealing although very easy quite deserted strip mall there's much activity happening otherwise  Once inside greeted friendly server Spanish immediately seated  arrived around 7 30 p m  2 3 other groups people dining time  interior resembled old 50s diner upgraded light fixtures  Also interestingly entertainment comprised Jackass MTV which felt tad bit inappropriate family dining establishment halfway through meal changed Love Man Comedy Central improvement but still questionable    The menu simple consisted appetizers entrees chicken beef seafood dessert beverages  maracuya a passion fruit drink which thought tasted guava guayaba chicha morada although corn drink thought tasted chai tea horchata really cinnamon overpowering flavor   drinks $2 cup no free refills otherwise regular fountain drinks available   Our order initially consisted palta rellena arroz chaufa pescado lo macho  Again never having Peruvian food no idea expect merely recommendations provided other reviews  server came back let know palta rellena recommended try tiradito de pescado appetizer instead  Although really looking forward palta rellena avocado stuffed cooked potatoes mayonnaise cooked chicken fish strips bathed yellow pepper lemon sauce surprisingly delightful something note fish sauce cold expecting would warm  arroz chaufa merely chicken fried rice slightly different flavor would expect any traditional Asian restaurant  menu description pescado lo macho fried fish topped Peruvian fish sauce served white rice some additional seafood items included fish sauce fried fish such calamari octopus oyster shrimp being said dish probably most delicious two entrees  end crema volteada which essentially flan but made milk therefore lot thicker substance    Overall thought server very friendly attentive food tasty but gave 4 star rating since atmosphere little off  would definitely come back try something else including palta rellena someday! <EOR> If could give 10 stars would! Incredible food amazing service! Huge portions fantastic flavors  Leche de Tigre menu separate item which seen any restaurants San Francisco LA San Diego  <EOR> Had Lomo Saltado Lo Pobre sliced beef served fries rice topped eggs! Palta Rellena avocado stuffed chicken salad   Lomo Saltado plate large enough two people stuffed take stuffed avocado home pardon pun  So recommendation split plates because portions positively huge! Food delicious though you'll happy Las Vegas outpost Peruvian food  Also few decent wines choose including Sauvignon Blanc enjoyed  Highly recommended those crave la comida Peruviana! <EOR> Lima Limon won heart over   Don't ask names ordered because cannot remember  But dish fish shrimp yellow sauce served rice  side salad also great because use tangy lime juice dressing top  husband ordered lomo saltado says great  Calamari also perfectly cooked  waiters always kind attentive   We definitely back   many times  <EOR> I thought food salty  pricey area  Cheaper places strip price  Service absolutely terrible didn't put ice cups brought ice bucket serve ourselves  Took 20 minutes seated another 15 drinks forgot plate table  <EOR> Felipe Juan both men amazing! first time establishment first visit worth trip home Henderson  decided look Peruvian place Vegas visit Miami FL  very surprised find number them home   The reception received Felipe guidance eat very effortless  He brought iPad showing photos available dishes tremendous help  Very smart them!

Around 9pm  food  arrives half table pre prepared  ceviche Half table starts eating      but  2 problems !!!! No drinks still even water !!! placed order 40 min earlier No silverware eat napkins!  Finally server arrives half places silverware dishwasher still wet! disgusting looked rinsed washed As half party starts eat remaining plates come 20 minutes apart each abother    We decide start sharing food everyone starving turn food into tapas style   Finally finish eating realize Birthday Girl yet food along another person party!!!! 3 hours later And all done eating    WTF???? They apologize said mistake   The whole night never water!! No did!  We able place drink order arrived 9pm    I immediatly placed another one   Did arrive until 10pm      I guess say food ok  not bad good flavor  But worth it  Ever  We spend over $500 feel robbed    any sushi Ayce better cheaper 5x more delicious   Only bring enemies foes eat would never want loved experience dinning experience   Thanks Review en español Este lugar no es restaurante es una fonda!! No tienen host busser o bartender  El mesero que tiened Amilcar aunque amable es un pesimo mesero    La comida esta buena pero el servicio fue el peor en toda mi vida  no estoy exagerando Si usted quiere esperar por 3 horas sin recibir algo de tomar este es su lugar   La cumpleañera nunca recibio su comida  despues de 3 horas y media    Se les olvido el plato de la cumpleñera y de otra persona aunque ya habian pasado mas de 3 horas!!!  Trajieron comida separada por mas de una hora  Aunque todos ordenamos al mismo tiempo   Decidimos compartir ya que llevavamos horas esperando comimos ceviche como si fuera tapas española ya que nadamas la mitad de gente tenia comida y nadie cubiertos   Cosas que nunca llegaron! Agua! Nadie por 3 horas nos dio agua  Pisco sour bueno este si llego pero tardo 2 horas  Nunca llegaron mas aunque pedimos mas immediatamente!!! Servilletas tuve que robar de otra mesa  Cubiertos bueno tambien llegaron pero mojados semi lavados y 10 minutos despues de la comida       en serio Por esas razones Amilcar es un pesimo mesero no se donde se escondia ya que no estaba muy lleno    Pagamos mas de $500 y siento estafado   Hagase un favor y escoja un restaurante si quiere salir comer no esta choza ya que lo va dejar con sabor amargo en la boca  No vale la pena la comida    Hay 1000s de lugares en Las Vegas con Mejor servicio y comida cualquier buffet seria mejor  Y mucho menos y sirven agua   Y nunca vaya este lugar con un grupo y mucho menos en occasion especiales!!!  Vaya nadamas cuando quiera sentirse menos preciado o con alguien que no le agrade  Este es su lugar   Gracias <EOR> Went Friday night  Good food but expect wait long time if ordering take out   such size establishment understaffed  <EOR> The Peruvian food delicious   Overall service poor    took over 10 minutes server approach drinks   meals brought 35 minutes order taken   matters worse 18 00% automatic tip added tab party six  <EOR> This place awesome! only thing would place better bread rolls awesome green sauce complimentary nuts amazing food fantastic ! seafood fresh ceviche mixto die saltado de mariscos amazing !
