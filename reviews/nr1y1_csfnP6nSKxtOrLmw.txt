She works she hates job  dining area dirty  mess everywhere  Totally recommending place dining  Drive thru should ok because won't deal sight dirty floor tables  <EOR> Sat drive through ordered  When reached window woman seemed nice enough took card ran it  Took few minutes bring back card  When she came back she giggling told sign drive thru menu stated taking cash only card services down  only no such sign but why world would she take card run if she already knew problem? Funny because first time coming back 12 years because hankering some fried okra  Maybe give them another chance 12 years so  <EOR> Have come location twice now happily surprised both times ordered chicken came fresh juicy biscuits die for  Most places dried chicken sitting under heat lamp while case here  Hopefully any future visits same results! <EOR>
