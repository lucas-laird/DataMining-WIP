Most sushi restaurants now mostly own Korean Mexican sushi chef although  necessarily bad all but just saying expecting something authentic Sawa    However extremely disappointed sushi  very tiny seemed poorly made  said because Las Vegas now there's AYCE sushi everywhere  If you're doing AYCE should provide higher quality quantity ingredients better presentation  paying wasn't satisfied sushi Sawa    I ordered 3 different sushi but made delivered 3 separate times  never place done unless sat sushi bar which felt little odd  just tiny sushi tiny fish top no presentation ever  fish good though very fresh   We also ordered hamachi kama  very very good  would recommend order instead sushi sure   Hot tea complimentary $2 25 per person  authentic good quality matcha    So if craving sushi If really hungry would somewhere AYCE  If just having little crave raw fish would Soho because they're always generous portion great quality  wouldn't come back sushi Sawa again  <EOR> One great personal waitress servicing table she reason why actually stayed taste rest food ordered since    Minus the sushi chefs rude accommodating requests taking skin off sashimi salmon should especially price $25 5 different types fish the albacore looked spoiled the yellow tail didn't look fresh  while looking over table whispering words shanking hands definitely made feel tho shouldn't done did such return food suppose served! DID MENTION they put fish back into fish area being table did know if didn't touch it? actually ate touched pieces GROSS!!!! Sorry am Japanese just returned Japan service impeccable along food!
