Today first time trying place out  Napa Valley sandwich delicious! bread soft yummy  Unfortunately tomato pesto didn't try real but opted tomatoes instead tasty anyways  tried homemade chips those die for! Overall cute spot decor fun  looking forward going back trying more food  Mostly sandwiches salads menu but also hamburgers  restaurant portion pretty small narrow don't know if good fit large groups  quite few tables but overall place very big  <EOR> I miss your good veggie sandwiches  last two times made no love    bread different being toasted? ? raved veggie sandwich forever disappointed last 2 times  bread  no bueno veggies would better if cut thinner opinion but  just opinion   Also if made love other times would favorite again  pickles those best! Hopefully back good ole days good homemade toasted focaccia bread thinner cut veggies love behind it  back craving again    Also if other vegan vegetarian options your menu would definitely awesome  <EOR> I ordered Napa valley sandwich Ubereats  very dry  Thank gosh mayonnaise mustard but even them still seemed dry first time trying them left disappointed  <EOR> I just picked order Buffalo Chicken loaded mushrooms   would probably great if supposed mushrooms which unfortunately not     Luckily allergic them just hate way taste feel   spending 5 min taking apart sandwich trying separate melted cheese slimy mushroom mostly enjoying sandwich fries pretty good well   same sandwich few weeks ago great bit disappointing type error happen  <EOR> This reliable go to lunch place coworker over last couple months definitely recommend it   I also give shout out manager Jessica Jennifer name believe  issue ubereats driver recently she extra mile accommodate even during highest point lunch busyness  Thanks again truly appreciated it! <EOR> Coming L A business deal right across place found yelp when looked chicken wings  rave reviews yelp expected little more wasnt bad any means but fell short anything memorable spectacular  First its literally corporate office's bottom corner next disgusting smoke filled pool hall whenever door opens blows shitload smoke into restaurant   The decor very simple opening 11am   Son ordered chick wings ok nothing special  Fries good  I ordered woodchopper sandwich loved marbled rye bread but put very little russian dressing couldnt even taste corned beef so so best nothing special all  all very edible meal but nothing worth coming back for  each own just nothing came even close blowing away  chips very oily thick potato chips fan again just whatever  Portions large least ordered  I'd say medium slighlty less than  Paid 26 bucks 2 plates fast food 1 drink  <EOR> I ordered Texas Turkey sandwich recommendation cashier waitress french fries another recommendation simply good  think could made sandwich better mention coworker chips much better fries  don't know if showed bad day but chef cook waitress bickering back forth  4 people ordered food including 3 them weren't correct? Fluke? <EOR> Ordered 2 chicken philly sandwiches $10 piece  more bread anything else if guess 1 4 chicken breast per sandwich  Hardly any veggies  Very disappointed portion size especially pay $10 philly    Go Jersey Mikes double food price  <EOR> The New American Sandwich Co  attached bar corner Grier Pilot however own entrance smoky inside   sandwich burger salad menu many choices service friendly although little slow given only partons   I ordered Philly cheesesteak Amoroso roll fries friend ordered American Hero house made chips   shared both found cheesesteak chips winners   Amoroso roll soft cheesesteak chips delicious   Hero fries just okay   Unlike other places portions overwhelming  am interested trying other options see if good cheesesteak   Side note buy 10 free stamp card  <EOR> I don't know if came bad day but only came lunch because read reviews all great  some fellow coworkers lunch came round 12  5 busy all  all ordered sandwiches but some ended eating because some orders took long really no choice  orders  simple but waitress looked overwhelmed  ended taking 45 minutes all 5 orders  waitress very apologetic just think weren't enough people working    The sandwiches however great  ordered turjey sandwich loved it   Everyone did say loved sandwiches well! Love chips when hot  Some coworkers chips stale cold but ones hot delicious   If service faster would given them 4 stars!! <EOR> Finally local alternative usual purveyors overpriced over processed underwhelming corporate lunch meat  NASC impressive selection well prepared creative delicious lunch fare  offer excellent salads homemade chips inspired sandwiches would put against anyone's town including Earl himself    personally recommend chopped asparagus salad Cuban sandwich which loaded grilled ham juicy tender pulled pork    The only problem may joint finding it   wedged next Paradise Pub tightly share external door bit confusing  good news now sign see street  bad news once word gets great food going waiting line  <EOR> New American Sandwich Co always good preferred go to team lunches  large menu there's something everyone  atmosphere casual good conversation staff super friendly  Back food co workers tried pretty much everything menu  All solid choices  only items haven't huge fan Chicken Philly a little dry taste earlier reviews noted bulgogi salty  Regarding fries vs  house made chips prefer fries  But chips pretty freaking good too  <EOR> I stopped quick lunch friend very satisfied  staff attentive food good  Napa Valley sandwich full flavor  must tell chips  don't know why anyone would pay more fries when chips awesome  Made fresh dusted seasoning salt yum!

Real meat processed fake meat  Solid bread homemade chips  Great choice  <EOR> I bulgogi sandwich since friend told she liked much she 3 days row  wasn't favorite meat salty taste wasn't enough onions mushrooms sandwich  barely drink water then eating but drank more cup because dry salty  cheese little dry someone said earlier  fries just okay  also Italian chips didn't order those but stole friend  home made better fries sure   It wasn't crowded when came 15 minute wait hot sandwiches wasn't bad  service good   They also offer catering lunch  waitress told she delivers food different companies everyday  menu different everyday  She said very quick couldn't note down  <EOR> Love place! right workplace only super convent but great atmosphere  Fried Green Tomato BLT delicious!
