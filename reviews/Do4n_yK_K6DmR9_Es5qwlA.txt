The only bad part experience place wasn't food but service  cashier server really annoyed help friend myself  really don't know problem but isn't part job description help customer little bit courtesy  But would still come back quick bite eat     <EOR> Loved suite Encore did love meal Cafe   ordered chicken portobello sandwich fruit cup passion tea lemonade 24$   found sandwich very boring bland  chicken dry tasteless even mayo slathered all over it   fruit cup typical   passion fruit tea lemonade bad but Starbuck's version better   Definitely worth price paid  definitely would elsewhere   Maybe try Society if looking another cafe same hotel  <EOR> A nice change Starbucks   Comparable national chains less burn y flavored coffee all four people party enjoyed coffee tea pastries  pastries particular well portioned fresh without being overly heavy  carrot cake raspberry coffee cake mango coconut layered cake    The only down side place REALLY loud  first place eat coming  Encore Wynn theaters  Across way far larger busier Allegro  Between two gaming floor opens up  yeah noisy!  The only other plus LITERALLY less 5 minutes walk entrance Level 2 self park parking garage  <EOR> If your staying Wynn Encore place very convenient breakfast quick snack lunch   sell coffee tea breakfast items sandwiches desserts etc  price range per person $10 $15 but then again your eating fast food place Vegas seems norm    The food itself pretty good think constantly making fresh   packed when Sam M 11AM   planning Hoover dam tour wanted grab something quick eat   Sam M ordered cinnamon bun warm gooey very good   ordered tuna salad sandwich croissant very prepared well  food came timely manner enough time eat before way   Good sitting well inside Drugstore cafe  <EOR> This review just tomato bisque soup must say favorite! big tomato soups but absolutely enjoyed especially rainy cold day  <EOR> Great Cafe Americano  Quiche Lorraine really good hearty  Other bakery goods look delicious well  <EOR> This place epitome Las Vegas expensive   But opened 24 hours when you're drunk hungry fling your money something here   came breakfast lunch before headed home Vegas   few choices sandwiches pastries   ordered brie turkey sandwich pretzel bread   wasn't big idea pretzel bread asked if could put different bread   silly should know premade all heat up   no eat pretzel bread   sandwich consisted turkey brie bread   also honey mustard sauce side   sad $7 50 sandwich   wash down ordered large orange juice which cost same sandwich   WTF!  shouldn't expected much   didn't   Onto next one  <EOR> Everything freshly made tasted great!

First night breakfast bagel bagel chewy egg dry bacon semi raw  second night pepperoni panini quesadilla called panini but looked quesadilla  dough raw sweet pepperoni almost raw non existent pizza sauce served cold  Each above set back over $10   The Wynn needs another 24 hour place open when crowded  would think Mr Wynn would thought that  Also place table service should option   I UNDERSTAND why Wynn high ratings  <EOR> Solid spot 4 a m  baked Mac cheese way salty but starving  also juice can't remember kind very disappointed  $6 size Starbucks water cup wasn't even freshly made! She poured plastic bottle!   Go Zoozacrackers around corner instead if you're looking quick bite  <EOR> I ordered Italian Sub $11 25 delicious   also Coconut Mango Mouse $6 which yummy   enjoyed every bite   prefer over buffet Wynn   service great even long lines  <EOR> Breakfast items overpriced ehh best but convenient location justifies it  Don't come high expectations   Decent selection overpriced pastries  almond croissant tasty but apple turnover lacking crispiness  Note If want your pastry warmed must ask it  Depending traffic may put microwave instead oven  apple turnover popped microwave may explain its depressed demeanor    The fruit granola yogurt cup actually decent  granola seems made in house included pumpkin seeds yum   No option Greek yogurt now    The line extend door  located across Wynn's box office if need  show tickets pair friend tag team tickets breakfast pick up  <EOR> 3 5 Stars  Went breakfast to go morning place bustling  really good steel cut oatmeal $5 95  expensive oatmeal but considering amount give enough feed two pretty good value  your choice dried fruits brown sugar  really filling too  oatmeal just way thick point being gummy soupy point looking came Quaker Instant  also expensive Forte teas here  love Forte tea they're quality brand but paying more $3 00 hot water tea bag fish myself 4 minutes pocketbook wince  two items paid $10 00  If ever back Wynn would come back oatmeal  hard eat healthy Vegas might well least meal day right  <EOR> Before heading Hoover dam stopped pick things eat bus ride   We two coffees mango jar grilled cheese sandwich egg white burrito   Everything tasty fresh!

Anyhow line pretty long but wait time wasn't bad  ordered small smoothie very pricey  top ended throwing away finishing 1 4 cup because way sweet artificial tasting  wouldn't extra trip back  Maybe other items menu better? <EOR> This only affordable non sit down place eat Wynn which frustrated hell since place didn't meet high expectations should Wynn    first meal ham cheese panini which served cold middle cheese wasn't even melted  When took back reheated STILL cold middle  just gave because 3 00AM partially drunk hunover just couldn't care enough stink   I breakfast snacks throughout stay I'd say favorite things eat steel cut oatmeal bran muffin  Pastries pretty decent   All other stuff just worth inflated Vegas prices  <EOR> Post XS grubbin'  I tried Mac Cheese w Chicken quite possibly best Mac Cheese ever had    but unfortunately came looking late lunch meal  serving TINY  portion least 1 4th portion give restaurant    I then came again leaving XS tried tomato soup w cheese sticks  cheese sticks super delicious hot fresh tasty  soup good portion just right    The decor cafe really cute!

Heads thought almost everything pre made! prices pretty high meal just heat up   4 stars because service just okay! <EOR> I can't believe few people mention croissants place?  good those Paris plus 5 times size   Drugstore Cafe's best kept secret   guess don't always them display ask them evening outside breakfast hours   We're Utah anytime pass through Vegas way SoCal stop just pick few! and then again way home Please people if know another amazing croissant place western I'd know   But doubt anything Wynn's excellent croissants   other pastries average best   yes pay 5 6$ per croissant but cares when its perfect huge  perfectly flaky outside airy moist inside   Melt your mouth perfection   Thank Steve Wynn  <EOR> Ordered Wynn coffee almond croissant raspberry coffee cake    Have say   pastry really worth its prices   almond croissant comes slightly bigger hand tastes very good   I'd back every morning afternoon try others if watch weight     The raspberry coffee cake big enough 2   sweet sour at same time only small portion coffee course   but some people may is     Lastly coffee tasted okay nice   Maybe little pricy strong morning   But personally strong taste wakes up!   Definitely returning salad sandwich look real yummy! <EOR> Stopped quick dessert before watching Le Reve    Bought three frozen yogurts parents extremely disappointed  $5+ each terrible buy  dad said vanilla tasted plastic  chocolate tasted more ice dairy    Waste money cafe <EOR> If your staying Wynn need coffee fix run across  street Starbucks  Wynn own cafe spot casino level    I'm iced coffee guy but didn't much offer flavor selection just basics caramel vanilla  Iced Cafe Mocha  bad tasted chocolatey but much buzz    What's really worth getting chocolate chip cookie  thick delicious last crumb  may freshly baked but once unwrap you'll munching Cookie Monster    We around 10 p m  place everyone's central perk lot people hanging here  also see pastries display which didn't look all appealing me    If your staying Encore would walk some distance place since Wynn connected here  <EOR> Very pricey but enjoyed got  cinnamon bun tasty tasted stick butter it  Yum!  The cheesecake tastes its made mostly cream cheese which like <EOR> My sisters hungry grab something quick before show  ended ordering chicken sandwich phili steak Caesar salad  sandwiches good but tad bit cold even though popped oven  found premade all sandwiches morning which didn't all  really sandwiches made fresh   The Caesar salad okay 2 stars because dressing horrible awkward taste it    Pricing wasn't bad around $12 per item  <EOR> Had tomato soup cheese sticks  Hot delicious great value money  Great vegetarian option  <EOR> Nachos 3am sounded great idea actually quite tasty  wasn't tasty waiting line 45 minutes hour rest crowd swaying many drinks  How's upping staff? <EOR> We ate few times while staying Wynn  ate variety items  Overall food great  Downsides service ALWAYS extremely slow always line  really need more people working however staff friendly seem hustling  during New Years holiday  three registers typically only working sometimes two  The prices high example $11 00 cold cut Italian sub  meals several times seems don't give full portion carry out  place Ok eat if staying Wynn but wouldn't special trip  Typical wait 20 30 minutes carry food already prepared just needs heating up  <EOR> You've just partying 12hrs straight  6am morning  You're hungover hungry need little pick me up   Head over little cafe nestled Wynn  open 24hrs  other reviewers say its little pricey but Vegas    isn't everything?  The pre made sandwiches pretty tasty though especially  breakfast bagel which favorite  staff could smiling bit more but guess having put drunken arses wasn't easiest tasks  <EOR> I really love cafe  Yes expensive but come on  Vegas  expect? came cafe late night showing Le Reve  looking place quick meal before heading upstairs room  decided turkey sandwich fondue platter thing http www yelp com biz_photos Do4n_yK_K6DmR9_Es5qwlA?select=B1QFcByJi2lpQGAGsdv5HA  The sandwich really good  bread really fresh  liked much brought another plane ride home  fondue thing cute  tasted okay  <EOR> 2 stars  Stopped lunch gf could some coffee dessert  Ordered mocha w only pump chocolate chocolate tart   The lady behind counter really needs enroll som ESL classes  She didn't just mess girls name     but she messed alphabet   we spelled name she only every letter wrong but double letters even though paid credit card    The chocolate tart ok gf liked it coffee way sweet i liked because tasted hot chocolate      looks used full 3 pumps maybe extra    regardless taste wasn't she ordered  No seats available took w us     I recommend using notepad your room writing your order if sense communication problem   I don't care nice person someone if job requires communication lack ability           it's wrong job them  HR should ashamed  <EOR> Turkey sandwich = delicious  However $10 50 little steep sandwich taste  Would rather sandwich fix Earl's PH! However hard complain when isn't food court area Wynn   Chicken noodle soup definitely amazing cure any rough night   Skip tomato soup cheese sticks  cheese sticks good but soup tastes more marinara sauce soup   4 stars food minus star priciness! <EOR> This cafe convenient because location but always SUPER busy   gotten food coffee based drinks several times everytime takes least fifteen minutes through line pay another five ten actually receive item   That being said prices reasonable think expensive Starbucks menu enough options satisfy just anyone adults kids if you're hurry solid option grab bite eat decent caffeine fix     Cheers! <EOR> No joke when lived vegas would Wynn specifically intent going coffee shop   Best pastries vegas   Fantastic coffee hot drinks   you're Wynn much worse places could spend snacking relaxing! <EOR> My husband stopped quick breakfast although really no quick Vegas due lines moved relatively quick since early   If you're late riser good luck finding cup coffee anywhere strip without standing line   grabbed toasted bagel cream cheese husband croissant coffee   Both nothing spectacular   Mine came cut little philadelphia cream cheese container   Service shy bagel shop where actually put cream cheese into bagel you   Minimal work done staff might well call cafeteria rather cafe  <EOR> 3   really?
