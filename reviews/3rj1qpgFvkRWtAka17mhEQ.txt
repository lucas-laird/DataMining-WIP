I love place  Until found green bug oysters! Made sick    still lose lunch when send emails  <EOR> I ordered French toast plate   came egg bacon fruit   Everything decent   Nothing spectacular   Didn't taste any different Denny's  <EOR> This used favorite place eat but lately not so much  portions getting smaller service even worse! Did change management????     Tonight at  6 05 pm found parking spot front because wasn't terribly crowded  all downhill there  coupon buy ordered chicken dinner go   took forever house meal come when did told last chicken asked if wanted menu order something different take meal  took another long while menu  She dropped off menu finished tea dinner before she ever came back! thirsty! No refills! She finally came back order  asked if could refill tea  wait forever that  order came she asked coupon number which gave when she took initial order  She said she lost it   through emails trash tried locate it  Finally order came asked bill   took another 20 minutes  bill asked where second drink you purchase two drinks entree   another 15 minutes    Normally wouldn't bothered but $3 29!  All all over two hours!!!  first time 60 years earth did leave tip!! may back if anyone asks certainly don't give recommendation  <EOR> Used love Mimi's but fan new menu least  new items but totally re create menu leave classic favorites seems silly  Disappointed <EOR> The food just ok  calls itself French restaurant maybe New Orleans French ? Disneyland French but think French people know would giggle best sneer worst suggestion Mimi's French  breads start more cake  main courses Americanized versions French cuisine   pretty stodgy fare   The desserts good but still American    I haven't back breakfast try baked goods yet   some reviews tout Mimi's forte  Well hope are   otherwise restaurant won't able hold interest    <EOR> The nicest way say reservations challenge people  waiting hour half table made reservation 3 weeks advance watching numerous parties same size seated ahead without reservations came conclusion people don't understand process reservations  Standing waiting area 3 small children under age 5 all well behaved could possibly age ready leave if pregnant sister really wanted eat here  least manager enough sense cover cost meal party 9 however took hour half realize wait ridiculous   If server worked 20+ years Monte Carlo used dealing upset customers ready give review 1 star because Yelp allow 0 star review  least amble leave restaurant without being upset service however long time before return here    If greatest patience would recommend finding different restaurant  <EOR> Great food nice atmosphere server Belinda very friendly fast even busy station father's day most definitely WI come back again <EOR> We several times  First time everything great  seems more often worse service is  pretty sure going back  Bussers busy trying talk hostess instead bussing dirty tables before even arrived  Waiter listening order because he busy looking around <EOR> I don't Mimi's over year come back Denny's breakfast?  So Mimi's many times breakfast past   certainly gourmet meal but always good place waffles side potatoes   Plus fresh squeezed orange juice would always want but then scoff price decide against   I hadn't back Mimi's quite some time   sure why   But when came back couldn't believe different food was   still looked pretty much same but guess quality gone downhill   The eggs bland waffle bland potatoes used love awful   soft guess bland   Plus orange juice carton but good news lowered price   My husband both left half food plates   highly unusual   Sorry Mimi's but don't think back quite some time again  <EOR> $4 99 KID MEALS won over  Im family four two kids  finding place gives kids something eat cheap great! many options choose from  good place breakfast lunch Dinner dates Hubby   cheap wines more I wish closer <EOR> This favorite spots eat actually ate lunch dinner yesterday! Lunch great Chicken mac cheese  wasn't creamy usual but still delicious  Then dinner couple friends ordered take out  called picked time back home two minutes away store food all completely cold  Kinda bummer since usually good  called manager comped meal which really nice  back course maybe just more dine in! <EOR> Worst service meal ever  Food took forever   Asked salad without olives extra olives delivered   also piece plastic found middle salad   bad experience year ago but family wanted give another try   never again   Wish could give negative stars   only provided highlights experience  <EOR> There much say place  inconsistent  Some days good food some days bad  coupons joke  adding 2 overpriced soft drinks could just paid 2 entrees  last visit doozy however thought would share   Armed buy coupon must purchase drinks into Mimi's some steak eggs  Pretty easy both entrees same  order both steaks medium  eggs over medium again easy   The entrees come steak still mooing blood running all over eggs  ask waitress please cooked bit more  She takes steak leaving eggs returns kitchen  Steak eggs meant eaten together wait   Steak comes back bit browner top proceed take bite  First bite better however cut into middle steak cold clearly rare side  manager passed asked if he could please steak cooked ordered  He took entire plate eggs potatoes steak headed back kitchen   About 5 mins later he reappeared hockey puck saucer proceeded place front me  steak hard rock  asked where eggs potatoes he taken away which he responded Oh wanted those?     After sawing through joke steak manager returned 2 eggs saucer sunny side ordered no potatoes  stated steak inedible just wanted cancel order he keep eggs well   The lovely waitress comes over places bill 23 00 table  explained waitress unacceptable buy coupon bill same if both eaten meal  said don't mind paying coffees maybe 1 2 entrée eaten however pay same amount if both eaten seemed unfair   She puts bill back table says Well manager did now use coupon again next time   if golden coupon  if coupon exclusive! Google Mimi's coupons see readily available   I ask speak said manager  explain situation he looks puzzled however ends favor comping entire bill  Wow Thanks   Get together Mimi's  <EOR> I've many times never disappointed   Good food interesting menu nice portion size great prices   come back every time am area   love mussels Mac n cheese burgers particular  <EOR> The food cold  Also breakfast only 2 kinds muffins  waitress told other flavors advertised menu made  good  Also can't stand when waitress just tops coffee off without asking  coffee sugared creamed way before she came along ruined it  table didn't enough cream fix coffee  never eat again  awful expensive  <EOR> While wait service always quite good unevenness good prep keeps them being stand out   Luckily visit reason visit salmon frites entree   occasion portion salmon both moist perfectly cooked  salmon prep while always perfect remained more consistent BJ's Brewhouse down street  hoped only thing missing Mimi's could provide malt vinegar side available option   brought own remedy that   3 years ago Mimis ceased offering salmon w citrus salad good offering instead less successful spinach salad mix nearly good   would nice if returned menu       other entree steak frites  steak cooked ordered but most tender had  wasn't lot flavor despite dollop flavored butter top some additional salt just dash A 1 which normally don't use needed   Still meal overall reasonable rendered better use Buy one free coupon armed with    also took home 4 pk blueberry Muffins next day's breakfast those muffins unfailingly great treat    We'll back Mimi's again but likely stay away steak  steak house sometimes forget account that   several savory items board menu fill something else say Mimi's    we always leave full  <EOR> Worst place where eat!!! ordered Eggs Benedict Salmon  never seen such bad looking Eggs Benedict top egg shells them  Completely disappointed  never eat again  <EOR> Love love love Mimi's Cafe breakfast! food always comes exactly want I'm those custom that always HOT! Everything always tastes fresh  Scrambled eggs aren't all runny  Bacon isn't all fatty  Oatmeal yummy filling  serving staff great always top needs  only bad thing say don't use real butter but  deal breaker me  <EOR> Decent servers nice quick most part  Don't ask details menu items because few them won't know  breakfast once found plastic pancakes but other nice little French style restaurant  give loads food price  If but alert use though suggest tell them right away because give bread nuts appetizer  Overall if you're mood something hardy would dinner  <EOR> I'm very disappointed Mimi's Cafe  came girl's brunch seated area literally no heat  Actually coldest day December a c on  When friend said something assured heat going turned on  Meanwhile guests being seated heated side  ordering drinks food apparent heat never coming numerous guests leaving complaining  runny nose frozen hands oh cold food now finally made way front asked moved  even carried own food drinks new table  Horrible! No offer discount  No complimentary drink  No nothing  last thing    Mimi's why don't think cleaning your booths  #blacklight <EOR> I Mimi's least once week cannot enough mac cheese although salads also delicious  portions  large come delicious fresh muffin always left overs dinner  Highly recommend place staff super nice quick service  <EOR> Went Friday Thanksgiving dinner Las Vegas relatives   Since still stuffed day before two course meal corn soup fabulous chicken fried steak     two palm sized pieces gob mashed potatoes spoonful boiled carrots cauliflower   tad salty palate but reasonably priced meal value   Nice homey feel attentive service   Would again   $13 99 3 course meals seem real bargain but dessert back house to  <EOR> Nice place but food lacking  tried Santa Fe omelet found very spicy  service good again because close where live  However would little more flavor    <EOR> This place nice calm  grill cheese tomato soup  good but better  prefer Panera Bread's tomato soup better  But cousin grilled chicken fries delish! <EOR> Good food service good dinning area kept clean  restrooms bit messy but good food it! Try devil egg appetizer! Delicious! <EOR> Horrible experience  Hostess sat dirty table  Asked clean she said she would  Next she came back napkins silverware placed them dirty table  Again asked if table could cleaned hostess said should over soon clean she asked them take care it  Minutes pass    table still dirty  Finally waitress shows up  Starts greeting interrupt ask if table could please cleaned informed asked hostess done  She left water man came cleaned table  Waitress returned placed order  daughter both ordered turkey club no tomatoes  mom ordered tuna melt  When food arrived table all could see tomatoes sandwiches!!! made comment seeing tomatoes waitress grabbed plates said she'd take care it    uh seriously??? already knew meant meant she'd take back tomatoes would removed then would brought right back us  Sure enough few minutes later waitress returned disheveled sandwiches manhandled remove tomatoes  TAKING CARE IT!!! don't tomatoes period!!! Therefore want tomato juice seeds left behind sandwich!!! paying service would food made order specifications  asking anything special difficult  Simply leave off tomatoes!!! Heck even saving money  still paying same menu price item  Overall horrible experience  Waitress seemed oblivious irritated was  mom actually loves restaurant surprised poor service received! <EOR> Great atmosphere holiday music nice server Kearney fantastic!! definitely back! <EOR> My husband come every weekend Sunday brunch  Love sourdough bread  <EOR> BEWARE!  Possibility Salmonella here!!  looking forward having nice breakfast disgusted being given raw eggs   TWICE!!  Ordered Sante Fe wrap flavorless soggy gritty runny due eggs being scrambled properly   service slowest ever 20 minutes order 30 minutes bad food   waitress accommodating but great least replaced wrap scrambled eggs bacon potatoes   But again eggs raw!!  could clearly see area runny raw egg whites both different orders   clear just some cook off street versus actual chef   If wanted street cook food would gone cheaper place expecting bad food   dare Mimi's consider themselves restaurant   Overall experience eating worst life   Another table also returned food wasn't just me   Expecting scaled version fast food worst   never place if stuck looking place eat area    I next door Burger King first! <EOR> Had lunch girlfriend here  nice day sat outside nice little patio area  sandwich ok friend says great breakfasts   Ill come back try again  <EOR> Our server Frederick he beyond amazing  know good service when see because am server myself  He above beyond  ordered mussels although husband didn't feel though taking long he kept apologizing think something wrong kitchen where taking longer then should  He super attentive let manger know appetizer she took off even though didn't feel necessary  use work Mimi's Cafe wanted try food again see changed  husband loved open faced turkey sandwich mussels  felt food okay  horrible but horrible  still give stars purely fact such amazing server such attentive service  FREDERICK AMAZINGGGGGGG! <EOR> Very disappointing  husband excited dinner rude surprise very inattentive waitress couldn't even track down named Gabrielle she took 15 20 minutes around taking order when wasn't busy any means other waiters other few tables definitely back forth customers  Then when food steak bad literally didn't even swallow single bite because couldn't even chew guess dogs going eat good tonight but handful fries now just spent $40 dinner when something else after  husband chicken entree good  only reason why give any stars  thought we'd try new place dinner just said disappointing night wasted 40 bucks which would over 50 if didn't coupon which why there  would tried food fixed maybe gotten something else but could even find waitress talk lucky finally checked long sitting waiting  literally made Yelp account just nobody else through this <EOR> The food great service really bad especially if little kids   don't know why back even though right street us   Maybe hope some day we'll waitress gives darn stop leading believe you'll actually decent service   They greet promptly but yesterday's service where plates pretty much thrown never again   Maybe think poor tipper because instead ordering two kids meals order one?  Maybe because more occupied making sure kids ok rather being super smiley waitresses there?  Maybe just need 70 years old order cup coffeee slice whole wheat toast give them $10 tip?  other Mimi's area but seriously they're only slight notch IHOP deal attitudes    We'll see Mimi's corporate respond email sent them too  <EOR> We returned winter stay Las Vegas remembered Mimi's favorite places Sunday breakfast   Usually quite satisfied everything   early 9 00 am all crowded  service great coffee cups kept full  atmosphere usual charming   Both wife steak eggs if she writing probably would tacked another star   steak fine but mine tough shot through gristle   accept breakfast steaks aren't prime cut   But price believe could paid more attention tenderness and or maybe marinated tenderized them little bit more  <EOR> Brought mom day early mothers day  Thinking would good idea since figured would extremely busy next day  Boy wrong  Walked 7 30 am seated right away which nice  waitress really sweet took order submitted it  30 minutes later still waiting meal  She brings meal cinnamon roll french toast  disgusting hard rock  told um can't eat this  She returned no problem  mom's comes just regular pancakes all doughy middle  She returns those  jokingly said maybe need new cook she laughs he's new  Um wow!!! say just give pancakes  No problem 2nd attempt came ok  Eggs all runny cold  Just terrible cooking experience joked around said should just gone buffet  Ugh  But manager did comp whole meal abd gave gift card but felt bad bc wanted take mom mothers day breakfast  <EOR> As regular customers off experience thought would share  Entered restaurant 8pm Friday night greeted seated right away hostess great  Once sat down person acknowledged over 10 minutes  Multiple servers employees manager walked past without saying word couple even made eye contact me   menus closed tables near being cleaned just overlooked  12 minutes left restaurant then back into share employee let them know anybody trouble but just let them know disappointed hopefully help them fix process    When back inside once again greeted quickly door shared experience   server talked polite apologetic offered free muffins   didn't want muffins just wanted let them know situation denied them employee    We return hopes better service future mean really muffins  <EOR> We took some guests visiting Europe last night   experience past very good   Last night however very bad   When arrived several tables within sight cluttered remains previous diners   told would 15 20 minute wait table   seated before time expired    But then waited 10 minutes before being offered water other beverages    acceptable especially when busy   also short two table settings ask them server   When he bought them he simply put silverware pile center table didn't bring any additional napkins   ask another server bring those   ask replacement small plates used bread dirty   ordered steak frites wife French Onion soup guests ordered pot roast   steak upon arrival tepid best frites died waiting pass microwaved   case inedible sent them back   Neither servings pot roast hot plate mashed potatoes downright cold   won't write off Mimi's just yet any place off night previous experiences good   However cautious next visit most certainly include guests  <EOR> I am fan Mimi's way back   think first restaurant Anaheim where grew up   sorry find Mimi's Centennial disaster   pretty sure management's fault LACK effective management   Sometimes service isn't bad but 2 visits just awful   think under staffed   don't enough glassware silverware sometimes just run out!  location also doesn't any alcohol just beer wine   food quality ok service bad here   many fabulous restaurants Vegas there's no reason ever visit Mimi's again!

Regardless MIA bread meal came pretty quick which expected because when practically empty    The tomato soup pretty good but can't say impressed steak served  cooked way asked also sure wasn't even real meat  Tasted more soybeans earthworms    The mash potatoes also lacking any sort flavor other sand  Maybe little hint salt but could leftover oily residue tongue fake a steak   Our waiter seemed less enthused around people but regardless he attentive refilled drinks frequently  He probably hurry hell before started complaining him   All all lot other eateries area probably won't opt again  <EOR> Thanksgiving Dinner Mimi's Special 3 course meal  All except salad corn soup SUCKED! terrible meal    The veggies  carrots broccoli  inedible  microwave bagged crap  1st serving almost raw replacement hot hard dry  Cardboard would taste better!
