Lots items available buffet reasonable price less $10   restaurant big but number seats tables  little warm inside but fans blowing    The quality food okay think quantity variety over quality here  better AYCE Filipino buffet food California but also cost more there   I also ordered halo halo dessert which came huge bowl but good did evaporated milk fruit little crunchy cereal things just some ice cream jellies   <EOR> We visiting Los angeles stumbled philipino rest yelp  Turns delicious! cheap $6 99 buffet really good filipino food   lechon soft crunchy yummy   salmon soup delicious fresh   Thank way go  people very nice well <EOR> Hey! lady na nag post sa kine claim nyang change  She's very stupid  Saan ka nkakita na day bago nya naalala na may sukli pala sya lol nkakatawa ano  Kaya d dapat paniwalaan   Wag syang manira dahil sya ang sira  <EOR> The food excellent     keep food trays fresh full  Filipino style food cooking very good A+ cook  place kept orderly clesn  serve all foods 6am midnight recommend back when Vegas <EOR> Masarap!  I never heard Joy's Filipino Restaurant Buffet until another place near work Manila's Best closed which left looking another place nearby   Glad found her!  Located close Charleston Maryland some would call 'unsavory' part town Joy's down home Filipino cooking would find your Nanay Tatay's house   Dang authentic!  If pork things soup if bowls white rice won't any issue's Joy's!  Sure could order items ala carte but easy just buffet!  Eat all it!  We wandered into Joy's around start lunch   Joy's open long hours 6 00 AM almost midnight read depending day   since brunching hour some breakfast items available lunch!  feast some morning goodies basically favorite Filipino breakfast hot rice sweet longanisa scrambled eggs tomato onion!  yummy!  But didn't forget some lunch too!  More hot rice pancit tarong eggplant lechon kawali bowl chicken papaya soup!  many other things available day kare kare guisadong pusit sautéed squid dinuguan pork pork blood aka 'chocolate meat' fried chicken sinigang much more!  just full try everything   But quality food fresh tasting close used eating when kid   Foods kept hot most things weren't sitting long some breakfast items because weren't going refilled since lunch buffet line kept very clean     OK food good but don't judge based environment   Joy's buffet looks DATED   way grandpa grandpa decorated house back 80's   similar green paint used walls too!  does look bit unkempt rickety when look around restaurant   And   the bathroom no real joy either   Then again restaurant housed strip mall seems old anyway   But does vaguely resemble pics relatives houses back Philippines!  Don't focus just food   Eat merry!  Food well priced boot   All you can eat buffet only $6 99 per person!  Cheapie!  But can't remember if cash only if use credit debit card   Oh more tip   If you're rich look rich drive luxury car resemble anything hipster   do wander into area where Joy's late into night!  Dress down please!  No need gather yourself unwanted attention because lighting around very suspect   gonna judge homeless hang around the offered food gracious but just aware your surroundings   Late night robberies can't fun!  AGAIN   masarap! <EOR> Delivery took little while but happy offer delivery  Food prices affordable good  baby loves sinigang she ate lot   Thanks! <EOR> Stay away!!! Horrible dirty  Bad service  numerous filipino restaurants within 2 miles   go there  JOYS  <EOR> This place fucking disgusting  Zero stars me  Food just GROSS  can't believe people would rate place much write good reviews  Owner bitch saying all have  FUCK ? your restaurant obligated food look good  Never going again  <EOR> Everything flavorful very reasonable   You cannot wrong $6 99 buffet all day  We back    <EOR> They always serve cold food  food warmer no good  wants eat cold filipino food? No one  <EOR> Not happy ordered   Ordered lechon skinny dry    wasted money   <EOR> This place bittersweet restaurant but don't like  pay food isn't sanitary you'd expect restaurant  But food very delicious you're kind stuck middle where your health matters satisfaction food does  past two visits chosen satisfaction food instantly regret it  stomach would sore first visit during second visit seen many flies chillin adobo pancit rice seen customers just scoop food area without employee's coming stop them change food  Filipino buffet concept but wish more sanitary aware bugs landing food even crawling tables  <EOR> The food fresh tasty little further usual place but definitely worth drive  service friendly  all favorite foods even fried chicken skin lumpia! Yummy! Even dessert good <EOR> We stumble onto place several years back glad did  If Filipino food buffets place you  small place owners serves wide variety dishes surprisingly tasty  price really more reasonable  continued sure stop Vegas never miss  <EOR> I walked Restaurant Buffet dad  strangest customer experiences ever had  wasn't bad but definitely strange   When walked greeted family sitting down table  all eating thought customers  But then told pay finish eating plates food against wall  nice but very professional  didn't see fountain machine asked if any drinks pointed fridge told take wanted  didn't any ice cups brought cups ice in bowl bendy straws then sat down finish eating  Once finished lady table walked register could pay  very inexpensive trouble bringing change she just took $20 bill gave even bill $22 dollars  nice but weird bit unprofessional but bad way   The food itself good  didn't any signs food didn't know eating  But some rice some sort meat veggies  tasted good but spectacular  soups meats rice much else  food selection very scarce  literally bar different foods  did second helping because did taste good but didn't know eating  father friend didn't much enjoy food but don't Asian food much anyways   Overall would say strange experience  don't know if would come back a little laid back liking but if don't mind good but unprofessional guest service would recommend it  inexpensive alright  <EOR> foods really great environment neat organize  server very friendly approachable  nilaga best me! come back sure! <EOR>
