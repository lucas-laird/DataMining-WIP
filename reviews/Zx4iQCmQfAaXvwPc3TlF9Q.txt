Starting previous review don't know smoking laws Vegas but  no sense applied place  take window only thing non smoking  said think smoking laws kinda silly didn't bother me  Everything else place did     The food nothing special bordered horrible  Garlic cheese bread soggy some places while overbaked around corners  Chicken tenders clearly just reheated frozen bag which could alright since come flavored dipped except give 4 most pathetic looking pieces $8 sauces sucked  If you're looking good bar food 1000x better elsewhere Vegas if you're looking crap then guess you've discovered right place   Bar food hit miss else going Tap House? $3 50 on tap Hoegaarden wasn't bad but rather small glass given other area sports bars  beer selection average nothing special    Finally brought place  advertise themselves home Cleveland's sports teams being Cleveland sports nut decided Game 5 Eastern Conference Finals  Bad call  Half crowd wasn't paying any attention which while place's fault probably wasn't helped fact half TVs other things replays old Dodger games trivial pursuit reruns   Adding insult injury? placemat proclaims love Cavs SPELLS CAVALIERS INCORRECTLY see picture uploaded   Seriously guys?  inexcusable    So recap don't come food worth coming drinks definitely actual Cleveland sports bar  leaves no real reason come all  Good riddance  <EOR> By outside would think tavern held wealth entertainment local artists live band Monday nights except over flowing parking lot  Enter front door you'll see normal tavern few customers eating booths drinking bar some even taking couple slot rounds  However mosey down hall enter world 50 plus crowd where drinks plenty food hearty entertainment delight  LIVE music Frank WIllie Neil Charlie Connie more tribute artists stop give taste local shows mention wonderful band under direction Ned Mills  small dance floor doesn't seem inhibit locals packing brim having wonderful night town  Surprise!

Sort she said   So this?  Tap House openly defies state law enacted voters but insists inexplicable restriction standing bar   They're neighborhood institution sure they'll fine without me   If enjoy typical smoke filled dive place you  <EOR> I come all time  usually order cajun wings  But today recommended waitress ordered Philly cheese steak  peppers cheese bits bacon   What?
