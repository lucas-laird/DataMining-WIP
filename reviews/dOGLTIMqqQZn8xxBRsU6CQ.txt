Oh Thai iced tea really really good   Perhaps best had!  Very original taste just right level sweetness   The tom kha chicken excellent   think beats even versions Komol Prommares gets close Thai Grill   Thai Grill's broth fuller more sour but great tom kha gai Kung Fu super tender chicken chunks   must slow cook chicken somehow because simply melts your mouth   amazing   If only could chicken Thai Grill broth!    The panang beef good too   definite peanut flavor first bite two but flavor quickly blended away kept eating   added chili powder curry balance slight sweetness   pairing chili powder taste curry simply perfection   wouldn't say panang especially unique style but style nearly good panang Komol which best dish Komol    beef also very well prepared tender   read see meat things Kung Fu does exceptionally well   On Rad Na! Rad Na few versions actually would order alone when order Rad Na itself must damn good!  Prommares still best Rad Na town but close tie Thai Grill second   noodles fresh sauce lightly sweet flavorful   lots bright green thick Chinese broccoli stems leaves   Very fresh very good   pork again incredibly tender   Very high quality meats Kung Fu    Kung Fu's Thai food very strong authentic   Every time come large families groups Thai people eating   People don't know Thai food might realize eating believe negative reviews reflection this   tell though if Thai food lover am place some fine Thai food     On other hand food bit heavier food Thai Grill and probably TSNH original recipes favorite Thai restaurant   think Thai Grill uniquely healthy compared Kung Fu and most other Thai restaurants    Between two restaurants though thoroughly satisfy craving Thai food   can't wait try more Thai dishes Kung Fu Thai Chinese especially desserts     Update Losing star couple reasons   curry however still doesn't unique flavor am looking for   well done but little bit generic style   Secondly Thai menu dwarfed Chinese menu   understand where Kung Fu probably gets most its business but means Kung Fu can't offer many Thai dishes should   find myself wanting back because nothing new try     Disclaimer review prior Thai food only  <EOR> Love Kung Fu!  Such good food  only ordered delivery but spot when didn't around cooking dinner  Open late delivery   Also big portions fast delivery  Yum! <EOR> Me friends call last stop before leaving Vegas  orange chicken Mongolian beef absolute favorites  Best hangover food other steak eggs  <EOR> Am giving 5 star because food truly authentic thai cuisine service quiet fast bathroom very clean  <EOR> I 2x last year  When come Vegas ALWAYS need eat noodle soup few times  find China town once day during visits  favorite beef ball noodle soup  both times visiting always shocked see tiny bowl soup comes out  little bowl nothing see Bay area California  But Las Vegas suppose do   The first time still hungry when left but time all ordered crab papaya salad well  noodle soup left happy content  soup little sweet side which am accustomed favor   I ordered soup without bean sprouts came bean sprouts also asked extra cilantro didn't give any    If sure craving   definitely lost menu  thing 10 pages long ranging Thai curries soups Chinese fried rices more dishes!

Sesame chicken trimmed correctly small bones tissue completely ruined it  Thai soup only so so fried rice barley passable  Other dishes past also fallen short   Thai food delivery worth many other options town Chinese food consistently below par  Really wanted place reasonably priced delivery always quick but alas cannot   Sorry Kung Fu Plaza  <EOR> Kung Fu Thai Chinese Thai Chinese restaurant located Spring Mountain Rd  party four restaurant Sunday January 3 around 11am  style service family style but entrees serving available well   Atmosphere Vibrant Organized The decor restaurant seems based around Thai decor  Upon entering restaurant decor vermillion colored  Nothing flashy but pictures statues seem Thai themed  Nothing obnoxious flashy but just enough decor around restaurant catch your eye   Service Good!  Upon entering restaurant seated immediately booth  When seated however instead waiter asking wanted drink he just gave all ice water  able ask hot tea which wanted later upon request  table where seated plenty space sit  took time finishing dishes when needed cleared cleared efficiency  only thing did enjoy would busser stacking dishes table  He should brought cart tray case something might splashed us   Food Well prepared delicious memorable We ordered crab ragoons only appetizer  crispy outside creamy filling  Six served bed shredded cabbage side horseradish sauce sweet sour sauce both which complimented ragoons very well  liked service when ordered ragoons would when waiter told if order wontons would plain if order ragoons would filling  very considerate him   The two soups order wonton soup tom yom big rice noodles  wonton soup came shrimp pork carrots baby bok choy scallions pork wontons  wonton soup decent but needed some salt pepper  tom yum order medium spiciness came fish balls imitation crab some ground pork bean sprouts scallions fried wonton top garnish  tom yum incredible full flavor little savory complimentary kick spiciness   The dishes order chicken pad thai Hon Sui Tofu beef broccoli oyster sauce  Chicken pad thai came purple cabbage parsley side  pad thai good amount chicken seasoning  Hon Sui great juiciness tofu great flavor meat totally delicious savory  Beef Broccoli probably favorite dish beef's smokiness seasoning absoutely amazing  Beef Broccoli oyster sauce must try!

I'm sure back whenever hit Vegas we're buffet  LOL  <EOR> I really place  When first moved looked Thai place couldn't believe many here! And most them within city block another  So naturally try each one  And all pretty good  But place better  The Tom Yum Gai chicken lemongrass soup best far  If two person portion enough three four  After soup wife done but plate Thai Bok Choy Chinese cabbage cooked Thai style   Very fresh flavor really shines  The fact combine Thai Chinese foods menu really smart  I've gone lunch early dinner late dinner Christmas Eve Christmas day they're always almost full but never wait table  It's pretty sizable place  I don't drink but can't miss huge bar right side dining room  Service good prices reasonable  I'm getting hungry just thinking it! <EOR> I hate being lied to   The food good any better any Thai place town little worse Komol Lotus Siam but OK   The service sub standard but glaringly so   The wait times food unusually long perhaps because trying drink more   But lie   First off never ever ever order order pick up   wait show begin making cheat them no show   lie when say almost done immediately run card then wait between 30 40 minutes food   If call them promise waiting hot still lie say will   not   This happened 4 times before gave them closest Thai place home therefor logical choice if want quick dinner   Then deliveries home them only Thai place could find delivered   guy came several times paid good tip no issues then blue person answered phone told could deliver area far  When pointed them delivered several times before person phone informed categorically never delivered area accused lying   shrugged figured someone new crazy ordered someplace else moved on   few weeks later tried order again different person answered phone again categorically informed never delivered area where home located   A change policy because far away       fine   But doesn't sit well easy enthusiastically lie   Their food ain't bad but worth putting service lying  <EOR> play safe stick some tom yum soup pad see ew    tom yum soup delicious bring hot pot thing your table help yourself   my friend pad see ew w shrimp ate more food own  give generous amount large shrimp well thick flat noodles egg garlic y sauce    i rice dish   rice spicy deep fried cat fish fillets   mess unidentifiable pieces fish smothered brown sauce top rice  NO BUENO  mean BUSINESs when ask spicy want your food scale 1 10  LOVE spicy asked 8 borderline i cant enjoy my food stage me    service great friend ordered garlic chili beef dish asked spicy level 8  she dying must admit though delicious don't think enjoy eating entire meal that  she told server way spicy couldn't eat happily made another order less spicy  thought super nice them because i'd probably tell person bad since should know order own risk!   Moral story even if love some kick your food think handle really spicy food order lower level   you always add them add more spice if suitable! <EOR> This place great food decent service   But deaaaaaaad 9pm Friday   medium sized restaurant maybe 20 30 tables? 60% tables unoccupied     I'm sorry but when restaurant empty can't help but wonder whether made good choice even if food tastes wonderful   Maybe just picked off day  <EOR> Just tried food amazing!
