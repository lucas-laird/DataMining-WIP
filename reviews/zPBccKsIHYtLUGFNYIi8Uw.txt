Kirin anwser  sushi decent considering lunch buffet under $8  Lo Mein Chow Mein both excellent well each meat dishes tried  <EOR> Horrible service no ac super hot all clie ts where asking ac she saying because door open when asked move she mad before good experience but today wont back bad experience good enough  come back <EOR> Ok decided bring daughter Chinese food her favorite food  When walk in  pay  believe neighborhood questionable   But would recommend come back again <EOR> First all fan AYCE Asian buffets because more quality over quantity kind of person  haven't agreed family eat asian buffet while until today since heard cheaper here  note expected them subpar but NO! proved wrong  Even affordable buffet places actually offer great quality food  Their food just right when comes seasonings texture control  Most buffets' food would salty soggy dry since making lot food thus don't enough time quality control  place other hand actually cares small details food  only food great tasting even texture point  haven't tasted anything salty tongue very sensitive saltiness  Out all dishes tried only disliked 2 them  But  just way can't perfect   Even service great   They also offer free tea <EOR> I eat fairly regularly  Maybe couple times month  food decent  However recently changed some things  changed price $7 50 beverage separate   result low price they've eliminated some better buffet items  What's left still okay but selection matches $7 50 price point  <EOR> Tried place during normal weekday lunch  Typical Chinese buffet  pretty cheap price good amount variety hot foods semi fresh foods bad presentation  Very limited sushi nothing raw but least sushi rice tasted better most other buffet places! Place pretty clean service good  buffet tables weird fishy seafood smell  almost made lose appetite  Also buffet quality ice cream included during lunch service! May come dinner service try out  <EOR> I happily surprised buffet  Normally if would've heard sushi buffet all eat would've grossed but decided limb try place happy did  crab legs oysters mussels which things planned seeing unless paid arm leg however dinner two only $27  food good sushi good only downside wasn't good variety desserts  <EOR> It's very affordable here  tastes good but bit far away  since Chinatown almost 20 minutes  big space clean going come again Thanks??? <EOR> Great food  Cheap prices Good customer service  Pretty quiet place We'll coming more often here!!! <EOR> Incredible value very reasonable price   Tons various dishes many seafood offerings sushi large size rolls oysters sashimi crab teriyaki chicken chicken skewers beef broccoli orange chicken + tons more servers nice tvs throughout place comfortable large booths everywhere    Awesome place     definitely regular deal    ate ton still didn't even try least 8 dishes wanted try  many good dishes want eat everything but can't and refilling dishes very fast keep them full which great awesome service    good amount people when walked kept getting more crowded    ate ton raw fish feel healthy walking which great feeling buffet     Love place!!!!!!! <EOR> This place pretty good    what mean pay for food good overall but place seemed little dirty  wasn't fancy buffet strip but way less money strip <EOR> You pay for  Wouldn't back  Cheap food  Meat tough dry variety meh  Cheap though  <EOR> Food pretty good although should more workers cleaning food section because did look little messy  good amount options during dinner although thought bit pricy  servers need more attentive just standing around talking never soda refill til flagged girls down  need better customer service if want people keep returning  <EOR> This buffet tricks people   didnt tell eat diner item until u already paid lunch    Then also start taking away all linch items   basically paid lunch eating much less items then lunch  <EOR> Great buffet lots seafood options! Reasonable price Las Vegas  Def recommended! pretty new restaurant but lots potential <EOR> Cons Limited food choice compared other Asian buffet good food quality taste service   Pros Price includes sodas tea  Suggestions servers let all customers know drinks included don't try charge some customers come 2 40pm dinner price because dinner start 3 30pm but some customers walk 3 25pm    different standards there? <EOR> I remember place when Vegas buffet but now Kirin Buffet nothing new Special it  Actually $1  worth   They boil fish next beef broccoli Ewww   The sushi looks okay but going chance it <EOR> Very good food amazing sushi  Friendly service great selection  price can't beat  highly recommend new Asian Buffett  <EOR> There lot upgrades made since changed being Vegas buffet   interior now nice pink color  food Average impressed wilted salads Kim Chee having refrigerator taste  but can't wrong paying only $8 88 lunch if really hungry Lol <EOR> I give buffet five stars because food fresh   did lunchtime when only open 30 minutes however other buffets where food looked sat hours just opening lunch    food variety mainly would find Oriental buffet although did see few things seen before plenty sushi offerings next desert table   Service fast seating area clean comfortable   Only $8 88 lunch weekday includes drinks refills  <EOR>
