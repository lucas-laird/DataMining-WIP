<EOR> First all I'd say husband must say loyal frequent customers since opened 2013 especially past year  even several months when would dine average twice week  toddler often work long hours cooking home during week while practically impossible plate specials became economical dining option small family ate often practicality's sake  husband even joke Full House extension kitchen  rooted raved them recommended family friends   Our long term positive experience them came abrupt halt past Saturday when ordered catering trays them  separate catering menu displayed prices half  full trays  would first time ordered catering trays them counting $120 $150 Christmas party tray packages ordered last year  half trays' prices range $35 $40 full trays $65 $70 depending type meat dish giving impression prices competitive those other Filipino restaurants town  even $230 package stated approx  40 persons included five 5 half trays main entrees plus half tray pansit rice  All all ended ordering three 3 full trays oxtail tripe kare kare grilled liempo chicken inasal 80 pcs lumpia eight 8 half trays variety other entrees  would ordered more dishes but kept mind some relatives pledged bring additional home cooked dishes party  order's total came $550+ incl  tax  husband repeatedly candidly emphasized Ms  Jocelyn expecting 100 guests extra special occasion she said NOTHING potentially having enough servings 100 people except she would throw free dessert because size order  On day event husband picked food himself while stayed home doing last minute preps housewarming bday bash  When husband arrived carried food trays into house approx 15 mins prior start event instantly noticed thin trays small food portions were  Think 1 5 deep aluminum trays used kakanins desserts  Those used ALL entrees! fact full trays liempo chicken inasal literally layer slices each tray only padded banana leaves shredded cabbage underneath  turned livid freaked soon realized basically gave half portions thought ordered sufficiently feed 100 guests  couldn't help but send text message Ms  Jocelyn inform upset wish she properly disclosed catering trays thinner depth standard catering trays used Filipino even non Filipino restaurants  And husband throw 3 4 relatively big parties year! ordered D'Pinoy Joint DT's Fiesta Filipina Kusina ni Lorraine Ito'y Sariling Atin  VERY reasonable knowledge expectation standard catering tray's dimensions  Trying best let ruin day since guests starting arrive already didn't bother waiting Ms  Jocelyn's reply  Luckily relatives pledged bring extra dishes brought much bigger servings expected  Still indeed 3 full trays 8 half trays food Full House practically evaporated time first 50 guests served themselves  EMBARRASSING  Some guests even asked where ordered catered food candidly made comments shallow trays because could barely fully dip serving spoons into trays when scooping food  Yes obvious! top oxtail tripe kare kare only 1 3 oxtail tripe rest neck bones yup $70 full tray neck bones kare kare   The next day found Ms  Jocelyn's only reply text Hi Sheila  Ganyan talaga ang size ng trays namin  Yun nag order ka nung December ganyan din yun  replied long text explaining why strongly felt catering tray menu misleading deceiving  also TRUE used same tray sizes when ordered December because photo holiday lunch table spread 2 5 deep trays  almost 48 hours since sent complaint text no reached even simple apology minimum misleading menu if truly just honest misunderstanding can't help but think intentionally skimped cheated servings thinking idiotic enough notice just extra $ off LOYAL FREQUENT CUSTOMERS  insulting shameless  <EOR> Finally very good Filipino restaurant Silverado Ranch area! must try! come back again try other dishes! Great job Chef Alex!!! <EOR> 18% Gratuity? Really? don't think so      We ordered Lechon Crispy pata Sisig chicken boneless BBQ Beef Bulgogi Flaming Halo halo   flaming effect cool way  total check around $75   First off foods    BEST  service great too       Why 3 stars? don't when being forced tip 18%    why would give 18% tip when myself put left overs box?  Like said foods service GREAT     still gave guy $10 tip   Don't ask 18% gratuity    leaves bad taste mouth  think twice back    <EOR> Seafood City Henderson opened tried Noodle Street  Ordered Miami chicken noodle soup paid $8 60 very small no taste Full Hous BBQ still best mani chicken noodle soup town <EOR> I driven place many times never really noticed it  lot advertising side few months ago noticed decided try out  Talk finding real treasure desert!

Surprisingly use small cheap shrimp Palabok most Filipino eateries which think projects skimpiness degrades place's image ! seems more snack place understandable ! Lastly store name confuses other people ! Full House BBQ sounds traditional ribs briskets small Manila cuisine underneath logo! While dining some white folks learned they're expecting ! Lol ! <EOR> The pork sisig amazing  Serving huge price charge  come whenever crae filipino food <EOR> Highly recommended Filipino food restaurant! Food good fresh  Family owned cook very friendly  <EOR> went 2nd time coz first time really liked food   maybe just Hungry  experience same second time drove over area order some food  20 min drive  far something eat  food inihaw na pork belly Java garlic rice salty pork rubbery   lips burning saltiness did finish all  then pork sisig  first when tried pretty good  second heart attack eating it  all pork fat! mean 90% meat fat   top mayo sunny side pretty sure ur cholesterol up ! hardly any meat any other ingridients sisig    just nice looking color peppers but flavor quality poor!!! very poor   then ordered lechon kawali pork bellywith Java garlic rice again rice salty pork meat crispy all skin!!!  Lechon kawali! supposed crispy  course bathing oil even though asked them drain well    skin pork thin crispy crunchy!!! more hard bite skin    sauce ok  rice very salty again  go  u decide if u still want try food  hope consistent quality flavor because if resto last long time I'd give couple more months if continues this  am coming back? anymore  just disappointed just dnt want trip wasted  if just food problem should ok  but all 3 them scores 1 10 me! hope review helps U decide! <EOR> Being restaurant owner myself am always support anyone willing leap into crazy industry  Since right down street house thought would give Full House try  Well    also happen love BBQ   Went order little lunch pleasantly surprised look place  Clean nicely decked some cool murals wall  owners made effect create nice ambiance guests   Without really looking prices my bad ordered St Louis rib combo beans cornbread comes drink well  sweet n tangy sauce   Had wait short time while prepared no biggy know going fresh  owner brought shortly pay   Here where south   $17 half rack side cornbread n drink   for lunch? Sticker shock!!  Now   I must say when home tasted food somewhat relieved  ribs rocked nicely smoked much sauce overkill  beans meaty chunks shredded pork jalapeños cornbread quite tasty    Unfortunately still can't over pricing thus 3 Star rating   Hey  if ya bank all means check em won't disappointed food  But me   just can't justify repeat!!! <EOR> I WANT love place truly  minute house and   simply love homemade Filipino food   Unfortunately  case here  food lacks depth flavor seems commercialized  Ordered Pork Sisig Lumpia Shanghai  Both lacked flavor   period  never met Lumpia didn't LOVE but unfortunately today day   How?!!   The Sisig chopped FAR thick meaning those delicious crispy bits no where found   lots lots LOTS bell pepper  While love some pepper need some jalapeños add scrumptious heat dish  always appeasing masses but keeping your cuisine authentic  almost guarantee toned down version serve own homes but   want THAT!
