Everyone friendly service always point! sushi delicious definitely recommend place! <EOR> I saw place Yelp  good ratings all eat family decided give try  must good because when wait lot people taking out    When seated helped right away  server took drink orders then food order when ready  food came reasonable time    The only reason knocked off star rating fish rice portion all eat  normally sushi nigiri more fish less rice  nigiri more rice fish  Another thing all eat place half orders rolls which gives chance try more rolls! But octopus sushi nigiri very tough hard eat    Rating other food family said beef teriyaki very tender chicken teriyaki very flavorful  portion size combos just right  <EOR> Great sushi spot great neighborhood   Staff very friendly aytentive  Great food prices  <EOR> Sushi type food most comfortably say frequent most   almost seems am always trying find best sushi spots Vegas find they're all about   Plus usually always target AYCE sushi joints because am big guy big appetite   being said whenever prod anyone come eat sushi always hear name Sushi Twister mentioned   While lot people rave place never quite same boat are   Don't wrong   ambiance great staff friendly location awesome 15 minutes house 2 minutes away job but sushi doesn't cut me   few good rolls Freddy vs  Jason Boulder Crunchy Ecstasy roll but majority rolls didn't really find appealing   fact low sodium soy sauce good prices Sake giant screen projection movie sporting event but going few times I'd rather stick usual hangouts   side note chefs pretty funny just tad bit obnoxious times but only added appeal Sushi Twister environment   bad IMO but enough coax back another AYCE encounter Twister   <EOR> This review mainly customer service  Dined some friends Friday night  Unfortunately close 11 coming late evening left hour eat  When seated waitress seemed little annoyed which just really upsetting  She stressed kitchen would closing 45 minutes she would just rather acye ers place all orders once  did just that  She made frequent visits table occasionally threw comments such Anything else? all want home know  No table seemed take offense but however found very disrespectful  restaurant yet closing just hate life take poor innocent customers just rude     It's unfortunate because food pretty good  just can't over fact server such foul attitude whole evening  like Relax smile little  Everything's going OK  set such low standards customer service can't bring myself rate them more three stars  Regardless good food was  Meh  Sorry sorry  <EOR> Me husband first experience few weeks ago now can't stop  tried quite few different roll all exceeded expectations  new favorite sushi spot  wish more mixed drink options  drink try white peach Jpop contains alcohol pleasantly surprised it  <EOR> Never ate restaurant  takeout but love everything had  am try new rolls  great sauces specialty rolls  <EOR> Only giving 4 stars because if didn't order All Eat its pulling teeth order in  Other food very good especially beef tataki which very hard find  All all good place  Price wasn't bad either  Would again <EOR> Our alll time FAVORITE place eat sushi!

Btw he suggests Angry Ninja <EOR> Pros 1  staff friendly attentive  2  portions just right considering cost each item    3  atmosphere upbeat restaurant clean   Cons 1  chicken beef teriyaki options absolutely drowning teriyaki sauce   would better and cheaper business if chef would hold back sauce bit allow patron ask more sauce if necessary  2  all you can eat AYCE option priced little high Lunch $23 Dinner $27 especially when consider Bellagio buffet only couple dollars more   lunch price should probably closer $17 $19 dinner option somewhere around $23 $25 at most      Summary The AYCE menu additional rules need know such time limit excess food charges   Since rules change won't waste time writing them all but before order aware rules   Also may need adjust your ordering strategy if necessary such ordering lot food right away because there's time limit since your items freshly prepared don't want waste time waiting your food arrive     This place isn't cheap but quality taste almost match price   convinced place special enough warrant far commute but if you're immediate area recommend visit  <EOR> Had going sushi mon while    Last experience good  hearing sushi twister  Food great!

NEVER seen before  But according workers AYCE TORO random promotion  Some days when show but most days won't it  coming AYCE TORO special gambling    The Tuna nigiri highest quality Tuna seen years  wasn't even Toro but fatty marbling  fish shinny light reflected off shard glass  Tuna literally just instantly melts inside your mouth    The Eel Sauce Unagi very strong  don't know sauce certain kind deepness    I love places own tempura sauce  Places use generic bottled stuff suck  SUSHI TWISTER possibly best Tempura sauce ever had    They best Sushi Rice face earth  seasoned perfectly! Many people don't sophistication notice small details but because am awesome can   My personal favorite Ichiro Mashita roll Dead Dragon  should try it!   I also want point only AYCE Sushi place ever puts wasabi nigri  Other AYCE Sushi places don't because market restaurant towards westerners     I am actually really happy came today  very entertaining conversation chef named Hiro  all workers really great me    When comes AYCE Sushi Goyemon can't touch place  Also rather come small independent places SUSHI TWISTER SUSHI RAINBOW any day over Martin Kollefs multi million dollar bankrolled hipster douchebag sushi orgy places   UPDATE OCT lowered rating 5 stars 4 because sushi chefs accused being HOOTO   When told didn't know he began describe person  Eventually figured he meant Hootie B     like f*cking joking? look middle aged man Korean wife? Apparently he thought Hooto because told most people Yelp want kill me  Don't wrong  am big fan Hooto reviews Sysco comments always rolling floor laughing but hell confuse him? <EOR> My boyfriend trying expand sushi wings explore new sushi places  read bunch positive reviews Sushi Twister Yelp figured worth try  isn't anywhere near house but figured good sushi worth drive   and was!
