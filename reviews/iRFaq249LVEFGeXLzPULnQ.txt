Going China Town Spring Mountain nice  neighborhood looks nice shops nice  prices ok  Sometimes service attitude lacking staff servers  rarely see smiles any conversation there  very dry    This place that  woman served each time gone presume she owner related extremely hospitable friendly  lucky I think gone times where very busy  Maybe because hidden place? Anyway plenty great times converted few friends into coming here    The food tasty prices low! amount quality food would easily pay 50% more elsewhere! checked often every time always some bring home us  fanciest places compared nicer looking places Spring Mountain but food service easily blows those places away me  <EOR> Just realized coming since Janae born 15 years ago   lot Chinese food    lol <EOR> If want inexpensive Chinese Chinatown meal may place you   There no ambiance but amount food give huge full carb rice    There little no flavoring all dishes  foods spoiled but freshness strong points    Lunch specials less $5 95 soup inclusive   Most dinner entrees less $10 00    One visit more enough  hidden gem!! <EOR> Come food   authentic good portions  Service attentive stopping frequently   Try salt pepper pork your mouth happy  <EOR> I would give 0 stars if possible  whole 34 years life never EVER anything remotely bad stuff place tried pass off food  attached pictures  First all order wasn't even close being accurate  Second all food did ROCK HARD literally hard chipped fucking tooth  If threw piece sweet sour pork wall would hole  am joking am absolutely serious  Whomever made food should food handler card instantly revoked  bit care put into this  am still shock could actually put box send someone when knew completely inedible  am very offended would serve personal  <EOR> One friends work introduced random hole wall Chinese restaurant behind Fashion Show Mall could happier! place ambiance  essentially attached dive bar which accessed via hallway connects two establishments  But definitely diamond rough no pun intended!
