Second offense pad see ew beef noodles also stuck together bricks dried hard  Also why did only flavor taste oil extra black pepper? Did run oyster sauce sweet soy sauce sugar fish sauce all traditional ingredients into dish? could handle eating oil flavored noodles extreme black pepper  Into trash goes    Third offense green curry beef consistency tom yum soup  don't understand curry watery! did taste any deep flavors would typically find curry no lemongrass no richness no sweetness except spicy  Spicy water would best explain dish  add insult injury offered minimal amount chewy beef pieces loaded undercooked hard vegetables  Cutting costs much?

Let's happen!  opportunity use Yelp's Eat 24 few times   Mainly pick orders     But time Pan Asian requested delivery   worry wart brain activated wondered hot food would still hopefully time delivered   Especially cuz gated complex where people sometimes wait gate   Twiddled thumbs     Food delivered within 25 minutes ordering which bad considering cooking time little over 2 miles away delivery   expected such quality   can't assume 4 5 star standing rating only dining in   But because following really happy pumpkin curry rice included dish ordered food delicious they're close pricing comparable average local Thai Yelp Eat 24 DELIVERY which arrived edible hot delicious food  How good still?  fried noodle stuffed egg rolls crispy    good   Pumpkin curry yum   think handle medium spice next time   rice however some hard pieces kind stuck molars   It's 4 75**** try dine next meal when more time  <EOR> I don't remember being disappointed restaurant   because food experience bad   but because all reviews positive   Perhaps expectations high???  Let start positive   Service very personal very attentive   Prices very reasonable     The food mediocre best     Chicken Satay very flavorful   peanut sauce looked came bottle   The Ravioli app okay   wrap good presentation great but filling over processed flavorless   The Duck Curry good   curry bit runny     The ribs probably best thing ordered   XO sauce really good but felt ribs overcooked     The beef salad really bad   Poor slices beef   some cut grain tough chew   salad looked regular spring mix pick market     The basil fried rice especially bad   dish all Thai restaurants entree use compare restaurants   Theirs heavy soy sauce very deep flavors   We might try lunch specials but unlikely would return dinner  <EOR> This 4th time food still consistently good    Always tiger shrimp mango salad crispy duck curry  crispy duck curry savory thai curry shimmered sweet pineapple grapes sometimes lycee balance spiciness while duck fried super crispy  Its such great dish  Although really watch spicy level  When ask your spicy level keep mind thai standard spicy amrrican standard  level 3 if want mild medium level 5 its burning inside out  But am still swallowing more food sweat  mango salad slightly cooked salad which love   I would say avoid tom yum soup alright serve bowls then pot  tried pork rib favourable but meaty me    Overall very good thai place desert even better those town  off strip but really worth going away crowds lines  <EOR> Best place ever love pad Thai clear noodles!!

Quick wait time when picking up  pho favorite  Watch spicy levels though  <EOR> I've meaning come long while now    did! TWICE even before decided write review!  Pan Asian quite quaint place  huge establishment  actually quite tiny  5 6 tables only if gets busy it'll real busy    The first time decided stir fried linguini which asparagus tomatoes bell peppers garlic chili basil your choice meat  decided choose chicken it  guess could say something  thai dish!  What?! thai restaurant eat non thai dish?! Psh  Don't hater  say     bad decision all order dish    You also choose your level spiciness your dish  range 1 10  yelp tip Roger spicy home  guess did? chose level 10  No didn't challenge fun  mean does fun anyways? Let's set fire intestines laugh while happening  personally love spicy food therefore gotta spicy why am even there?! server nice enough warn me  She asked if ever eaten level 10 really really spicy  back down! scare me! still level 10  Then little bit later cook himself warned spiciness level 10  love guys! But give spicyass food!!   The linguini    delicious! very interesting different flavor it  believe he uses satay sauce stir fry noodles spiciness peppers delicious  just love huge chunk pepper flakes bowl  lot other thai places tell lower level spice if isn't enough could add pepper flakes myself  Gee just means thing  use pepper flakes cook your food instead using actual peppers    My friends other hand ordered curry pad see ew  curry didn't really catch attention when tried it  pad see ew really good though  Very good aroma  Though pad see ew would probably suggest making spicy  doesn't really much good    As second time thoroughly surprised server remembered me  decided try tiger prawn shrimp salad server spicy level want? 10?! surprised but laughed  She remembered me! guess lot people order level 10 there  But eventually settled level 5 spiciness  know   know   LEVEL 5 ONLY?! What! Why didn't level 10 !!?? Well salads completely different story when comes spiciness level  almost doubled     plus sharing dish friends  I'd rather send them hospital fiery intestines    The dish however delicious  level 5 perfect amount spice  gets fire your mouth going  prawns used also did taste frozen shrimps  tasted pretty fresh way lightly grilled them side really good  Really yummy dish think it'd perfect summer!  As entree decided pad thai level 10  opted peanuts carrots cause don't care pieces peanuts noodles just hate carrots  dish very good but don't think better linguini opinion  nothing sets apart  tinge sweetness think because sweetness spicy could be  Though progression heat heat hotter gets  best kind spice D !!!   The only things keeping giving Pan Asian five stars because thoroughly confused  When reading menu     kind question yourself Thai place? Vietnamese place? Chinese place? etc etc  dish two different Asian cuisines  even hainan chicken! the??   The second thing thai tea  WAY sweet  no tea flavor  No go!
