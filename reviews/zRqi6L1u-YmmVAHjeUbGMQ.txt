As drive past front door see store pretty busy but single soul line!  pretty infuriating put mildly  consider going inside while still hold getting line place order tell them seems faster drive 15 min order person instead calling order! Ultimately decide just leave wouldn't even enjoy meal today    As pull plaza hang Clarissa comes back phone thank holding your name order? say no thanks! pretty long hold  just drove your store wasn't single person line!  pretty upsetting  which she replies must some mix order phone calls  Seems more likely forgotten hold cuz many phone calls mixed ahead 15 minutes???  I end hanging drive home hungry upset  sure if ever going back SkinnyFATS  <EOR> First last time husband raving place talking good reviews all found very costar phobic ! He ordered Ahi tacos ordered Cranburky  turkey burger over done dry ordered side fruit came 1st glance melon old  soggy asked fresher girl told   all if if something else Yum hummus wasn't good overall place just sucked <EOR> I really want love place but something want award them 5 stars   few times now more hits misses   Food quality good   ahi tacos   skinny fat    actually thought skinny better   highlighted freshness ingredients rather masking heavy sauces   I love decor glad kinda force sit share tables   really respect that   I would recommend place  <EOR> Ist time eating definitely last  many great unique menu items choose from     you need more visit! decor alone talking all diversity wrapped Skinny Fats  Perfect name concept one of a kind experience! <EOR> Really cool spot hang really innovative concept menu  right side menu all comfort fattening foods while left side healthier options! fun!  The food also good  only tried some sandwiches yet disappointed  only downside little expensive portion size comparison other restaurants but back extensive menu quality food <EOR> I split between Holsteins Shakes Buns SkinnyFATS Sunday dinner  friend came town decided tried SkinnyFATS  both never dine places  didn't matter which place but pics SkinnyFATS Yelp   enticing!   We came line just starting busy around 6pm  ordered Chix Broadway side truffle fries  order came timely manner  first impressed chicken bread ratio pretty darn good! breaded chicken breast huge normal  also very moist    However taste there  breaded chicken bland  toppings came Chix Broadway BLT cheddar red onion lemon herb aioli  All toppings didn't help chicken being bland  Also prefer bacon cooked crispy  don't know if cook bacon crispy all time  Hey but easy fix! Ask cook crispy then?  I chose truffle fries side came meal  fries served barely warm fries best had  Overall try SkinnyFATS again second visit  hope come when busy  staff friendly helpful  Till then hope update better review choose other creative selections menu <EOR> What gem Vegas!!! SkinnyFats AMAZING!!! food diversity quality hard top being said complimented top notch staff  energy friendliness!!! Whether your being simple having burger being bold having chicken waffles place RULES!!! only downside tad pricey but if you're willing pay great quality great service look no further! <EOR> Great lively interior design store  soon walked workers asked if ever before walked through whole menu  Food delicious definitely worth price  back again try different dishes! <EOR> So visiting SkinnyFATS third time feel write review experienced view now    Firstly place gets PACKED  yet come experience wait table  waits all short but wait wait    Secondly ordered everything else side just time because healthy side delicious! switched sides Chicken Waffles which if you're wondering worth it!  I ordered Cranburkey burger healthy side first time stopped during visit  wanted try something else but something perfectly cooked cranberry turkey patty called back  did opt truffle fries instead sweet potato fries though   so meal wasn't 100% healthy  washed meal down glass more awesome reusable cup fresh strawberry lemonade    I back  Many times  SkinnyFATS GOOD  <EOR> Love food love soda love condiments love people work here! many times even though live all way other side town  <EOR> This place super good  location packed when but food worth it  healthy fatty version menu both really good  recommend buffalo cauliflower  <EOR> Great food great environment  However first experience wasn't pleasant due cashier Kelly being extremely rude  When asked how's food answers short didn't seem interested  talking item  okay  alright   Really upset fiancé  Other food great servers great environment good  Tortilla soup must  <EOR> My fav place eat!

First off thank always fulfilling inner fat kid  almost always order happy menu the more unhealthy menu   no ragrets  even single letter   But more serious note  food always point  Depending time day come place usually packed busy  outside seating nice during spring summer   I would suggest ordering any kind burger happy menu  Medium rare  throw extra fried egg if burger doesn't already it  You're welcome   Also  serve alcohol! Try cocktails  They're usually fusion something incredibly healthy if  you're looking for  But drinks taste pretty good   The wait may take little longer expected but  because food made fresh there's usually ton people here  Which definitely good business   The staff always kind greeted right away upon entering leaving    SkinnyFATS dangerously located 5 mins away gives even more reason frequent place hanger not hunger   <EOR> 3 7 stars    I concept but employees def need some training what's food   I asked citrus dressing cashier he said idk citrus?    Okay obviously there's citrus citrus dressing  he asked another employee next what's citrus dressing  She ya know citrus taste citrus it  Wow couldn't help but burst laughing    She's what? good enough you? mean no good enough  doesn't give enough info your dressing  just awkward    Anyways menu pretty big lots options  ordered ahi tuna sandwich pretty good  def did feel skinny since butter bread being drenched teriyaki sauce  balsamic vinaigrette tasted trader joes    The French fries good especially jalapeño ketchup! <EOR> super friendly employees awesome jams playing wonderful atmosphere  food      amazing  husband something happy menu ordered healthy menu  everything fresh super tasty  worth pricy menu  hummus fresh but lacked some flavor  but new favorite spot! <EOR> This place good  gotten Tu Nuts club sandwich ahi tacos three egg scramble but whole egg instead whites   Love restaurant cater both healthy streaks when want splurge!

  Toni decided Bomb Diggity applewood bacon lettuce tomato lemon herb aioli sourdough sandwich  came some delicious sweet potato fries side  sure if due being hungry sandwich just being good but only complaint bread little rough  sourdough meant little rough around edges bread's fault    I decided Hot Chix salad bowl  Chopped buffalo chicken bleu cheese pico avocado fried jalapeno strips over romaine tossed buffalo ranch  Clearly winner healthy choices  only did awesome taste some well cooked seasoned boneless buffalo chicken nuggets tossed greens but blend ranch avocado presented such way inviting just clearly tossing salad apologies   far condiments own signature sauces which flavorful delicious specific plates but give them props including rare green habanero hot sauce  Though food

Wife Smoke Bowl   Healthy me   Ahi Shrimp tacos   Great flavors combinations   Its bit pricey but food exceptional   need Henderson which counter girl said opening  <EOR> There food absolutely amazing  first time tried SkinnyFATS Dean Martin location  Yesterday decided try Warm Springs location  First let start off saying busy   always good sign book  ordered Cherry Popper burger  amazing  $12 bit pricey burger but included side  boyfriend ordered off breakfast menu Smotherload think  yummy well  little sister classic burger  can't remember if  called though    but anyways  She ate entire thing fries  there's no way she could gotten something kids menu  Haha  bill came $40 three us  would complain prices if burgers didn't include fries    but did    My only complaint LONG wait order  Seriously  line forever ! 2 registers but only person taking orders filling various drink orders etc  took absolutely FOREVER order  back order drink later on  2 people front register  line additional 16 minutes  16 minutes order drink !   But anyways besides busy rush hour experience great  Th only reason docking star because long ordering process  should someone else taking orders  bare minimum someone help filling behind the counter drink orders hot water coffee strawberry lemonade etc   <EOR> Always greeted upon entry  Every single time  Super friendly staff  Food POINT  bit pricey but hey pay wait for! Wouldn't really change thing place except maybe larger dessert menu <EOR> Have wanting try place over year now finally made it! glad did  fast service type place where place your order take number table  Service perfectly friendly bussers come quickly often clear tables    Food I Smoke Bowl smokin bowl ? which good flavorful  boyfriend cranburkey burger sweet potato fries  burger little dry but some delicious jalapeno ketchup very good  Both items came healthy side menu but don't think them really healthy  think future probably just give happy side    It's little pricey but portions well sized tastes good  <EOR> Love service food environment  pick healthy side menu happy side menu  dont soda but offer fresh juices but its kidna pricey  only negative experienced when wife eating patio guy cleaning floor infront thought kinda rude because dust flying around  If being healthy recommend eating here  <EOR> My favorite SkinnyFats location Las Vegas   Plenty table space seating   Friendly staff more helpful   food always top notch any locations but far space just right here   Highly suggest trying spot if your mood great food  <EOR> This place amazing  Flavors dishes tried world  can't wait back  <EOR> When you're Skinny Fats you've entered ultimate temptation  Your mind telling Skinny but same time you're tempted choose Fats  stand ideally looking menu hoping narrow down least two entrees but difficult  near cashier you're really pressured select ultimate meal highlights your night   exactly found myself being love chicken waffles    Uhm yes  succumbed dark side chicken waffles syrup synchronized together into perfect bite  huge fan while while since last visited am also tempted purchase smoothie go  pretty much everything offer  Seriously just give them all me    The service always friendly  remember going 4 20 offering cookies  if need more reason them right? just keeps getting better     Also girlfriend big fan burgers  She can't enough delicious are  often fun because she always says she'll bowl but right when she gets counter she immediately changes mind though getting something other burger sin  But mean can't blame her  pretty damn delicious    One other thing place vegetarian friendly  love few meals menu vegetable loving friends also something too!
