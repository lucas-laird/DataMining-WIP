Then top off servers all kept attention tables near guessing they're all friends coworkers because constant talking hanging out  Hanging all good dandy but gotta top your work!   By end meal let servers know done  She said ok  time she still hasn't returned check  same 3 servers rotate through section finally attention she finishes conversation friends again ask check since telling other girl done did nothing   busy 3 parties section!  Management need talk your serving staff service attention customers  would love talk place right now friends n family but  sad  place could great  <EOR> For your paying for place deserves 3 star variety hot pot food selection  worth $35?

Probably  First impressions walking huge clean restaurant comfortable booths  Wow  Induction cooktops every table huge ying yang pots top  Basically pot 2 chambers two different broths cook your food in If you've never hot pot before basically pick your proteins vegetables etc throw them pot broth  boiling  your typical Chinese fare don't expect bowl rice anything stir fried your food literally boiled cooked soup base  meats generally sliced thin cooks almost instantly when dunk broth  meat seafood variety place huge wish could tried everything but just possible   You then dip your cooked food into sauce yourself  There's plethora sauces ingredients separate area yourself personally use mix soy sauce satay   Towards end meal if need carb fix throw some udon ramen noodles I'm usually full time it'll soak all amazing flavors cooking broth   Quality selection ingredients excellent but understand may some items sit long time may want observe yourself freshness   Dessert? Um   pretty non existent  couple fruits few almond cookies but  literally it  Don't set your expeditions high area    Service? basically sit down set your first round drinks   don't really see anyone come anymore  But serve yourself mostly anyway  Don't afraid flag them down if need plates cleared drinks refilled  Basically those places where if don't speak they're going assume you're doing ok  <EOR> This best places Vegas hot pot  love self serving buffet style selections meats seafood vegetables dipping sauces  restaurant clean happy service here  broths well seasoned come variety different types spicy non spicy  also plenty parking spaces surrounding establishment  highly recommend hot pot spot visit again next time Vegas  <EOR> MUST READ WORTH READ!!! EAT HERE!!! family debating if coming worth it  lot mixed reviews  But decided give try  But now regret it  First found fly noodles  mean fly it  Sometimes bugs into things  But later FOUND MOLD FOOD some sort tofu   just little mold mold looks growing food sitting same place WEEKS  2 INCHES HIGH!!! wish exaggerating! wasn't just piece once started looking through tray multiple pieces that  Made wonder long all food sitting out!! wish would've taken picture proof but honestly family grossed out    We complained waitress few minutes later another waitress came over stated asked check you    if no wanted discuss concerns comfortable  addition asked speak manager professionally address situation but told didn't anyone currently there  left discounted bill fight hungry disgusted  really complain mission write bad reviews  sorry if harsh but really happened  Simply put don't waste your time money  Poor customer service moldy food! <EOR> I'm torn place  hand food good price fair $28 20% promotion service super attentive  Pick broth take food buffet style cook pot your table  place doesn't ponzu sauce but made myself using soy sauce ice water lemons  There's seafood meats vegetables fresh fruits desserts    On other hand rushed ER hospitalized overnight severe reaction bad blue crab photo attached   Upon telling them indifferent   I wouldn't eat again because breathing  <EOR> I love place! many variety choices put your hot pot  love seafood plenty seafood eat  Customer service great fast  Definitely coming back! <EOR> Every now then would pass place every time family would say need try out  food bad but could better  least if did little grilling just soup  customer service ok except sat down never came back check see if needed anything else  wave down waiter water refilled couple times only refilled soup pot more broth only when noticed burning smell  But other whole experience ok  <EOR> Amazing! Randomly saw billboard way restaurant decided give try  Everyone party happy decision  brand new restaurant inside looks very clean bright  price usually $35pp dinner but running promotion 20% off  pleasant surprise   You choose 2 broths large divided pot every 2 people  spicy non spicy flavors  sauce bar well stocked more enough choices everything wanted  several types meats arranged nicely pre packaged plates large fridge which easy just pick take back table  ton different seafood meat options including crab crawfish lobster squid octopus shrimp fish balls many more options  also vegetable options plenty choose from  All types food past along more hadn't tried hot pot before   The broth flavors tasted great  control temperature table  waiter add more hot water when water level low  He good clearing away dirty dishes quickly  All food well stocked most part  only wasn't lobster which understandable very high demand  soon brought new plate would gone within seconds  There's also fruit dessert which wasn't well stocked  But brought fresh watermelon just tasted great  definitely stuffed myself max  certainly come back again next time  <EOR> This place different  past hot pot experience but sure really liked experience     All past places always extra extra taro but looks fried taro cubes  before hand freeze them  ruined original taste me    Back east coast use Asian bar b que sauce call satay sauce? confused since thought satay spicy sauce but since no ponzu sauce improvised     further deviating tastebuds away norm    My final thought liked idea getting pick own portions    but choices didn't look great fresh  <EOR> I really enjoy eating hot pot especially winters  always eaten home but family decided try Chinese hot pot outside home once    You given two choices sauce cute little yin yang style pot  ended getting seaweed white herbal spice red   herbal spice ended being spicy almost everyone   The Red Pot AYCE grab yourself style restaurant  all kinds food  frozen course keep chilled cook it    You even your own dipping sauce which awesome! offer many things really your creative juices flowing  First time don't know where start? Try recipe sesame sauce pinch red tofu sauce pinch greenish sauce next didnt see name bit sesame oil  Then over other side added cilantro green onion dash soy sauce wee bit garlic  Mix together thoroughly taste  found salty taste added some water  also helped texture become less pasty    Other here's thoughts Lobster rolls YUMM! Corn mediocre    bland sweet tasted old? Scallop yum! Masaigo balls YUMMMM!!! Imitation crab yum shrimp yum  I some other fish balls cant remember name but didn't particularly it   It extremely slow there  think maybe 3 other tables restaurant staff all very attentive refilling waters changing plates   When end back look fruits  watermelon lychee oranges pineapples but seemed sitting all day didn't touch it   The price wasn't worth IMHO  $35 before 20% winter discount applied which opinion expensive despite AYCE concept  Basically would much rather buy own food local market  now hot pot home! <EOR> The food good soup ordered fine spicy plane  seemed run some food lobster crab finally came more  very busy held service while better people leaving  Lamb great beef ok did chicken pork  price dinner $35 00 per person seems little high but all eat come hungry  <EOR> I gave place 1 star #1 because could give any less well open 2 am all  could just does Hot Pot no matter what?  Vegas arrived late when visit other places always look dining options don't home husband hungry yelp started looking Chow Fun 12 15 Chin Chin right across street decided walk well barely made before close all serving Sushi back yelp decided try Red Pot when arrived  @ 2 am nearly EVERY table place littered wasted food waiter the only employee ever saw asked if knew menu worked said no he responded pretty much all understood picked 2 soup flavors all eat $49 per person drinks included  said but hot soup husband guessed 2 flavors grabbed couple things sure going brought them back those things beef obviously uncooked husband put boiling pot table said lol ever eaten boiled beef? Apparently he didn t think but pretty much guarantee he won't doing again anytime soon  husband ate piece corn said really good corn  So seafood dumpling kind thing hoping cooked enough sunk teeth into bit hint flavor removed teeth thing placed back plate done husband drank sodas left worst waste $100 ever spent  certainly somewhere should pop search Chow Fun yes stuff appears rice noodles but never seen rice noodles look clear rubber air bubbles basically same texture  did bring hardly any stuff table try begin tables around least 3x food left them customers already ate left  really should only charged drinks very most 1 person but full price both us? Seriously?? waited tables many years lifetime know works generally but am complain stink though dumbfounded left bed hungry   Honestly Hot Pot something NEVER heard highly suspect trying again EVER highly doubt would no matter made judging reviews place considered pretty good must me  well actually husband   I highly suspect particular part Asia originates Korea though could wrong love Chinese Japanese food but Korean different story spices STRONG very different  anything else experience usually strong odor WOW odor alone much near did smell but when bit into dumpling all hit tasting those spices cause odor usually my son get's some kind Korean Ramen stuff now then just can't believe he eats anything smells that So anyway if Hot Pot give try guess if don't Hot Pot don't think place going life changing experience if don't know if hot pot suggest  spending $50 person figure unless $50 easy blow piece corn glass soda feeling your money's worth <EOR> The husband always search best hot pot around Vegas  Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot standard trying find broth flavorful meat great theirs  Red Pot comes closest regards broth  restaurant gorgeous modern well ventilated clean   What Red Pot edge over Little Sheep hugeeee variety seafood veggies noodles soups sauces! usually meats hot pot place Red Pot lacks different cuts meat  guess lack meat other food choices  think only 3 choices meat  meat does taste high quality Little Sheep but still tastes great broth nonetheless    The sauce bar huge! sauce bar actually back back  go to sauce always satay sauce cilantro but kind lacked flavor  herbal soup good but little mild flavor great  also tea eggs YUMMM!!! also loaded quail eggs too  husband loaded seafood section    Our waitress great  never empty waters dishes always cleared off table  also broth refilled when she saw getting low   The Red Pot most authentic tasting hot pot probably find Vegas comparison others  $35 person but 20% off brings $28  Try least once! <EOR> The decorations restaurant nice but all  starters AYCE dinner $35 per person plus another $3 drinks  Adding tax tip nearly $50 single person  thought price would worth because large selection seafood  However upon inspecting all foods closely noticed huge problem  only foods labeled meats! None vegetables labels nor did any seafood  selection meats very limited guess which fish balls getting because none them labeled  Secondly ordered spicy soup base only thing spicy bit spicy oil soup! Lastly but biggest problem food poisoning eating here  talked some friends least three other groups people ate diarrhea  Now love eating hot pot eat more three times week  enough experience know when meat cooked  left restaurant feeling severely overpaid dinner even sick !
