Maybe throw down order fries every now then? Half time wings much sauce dripping box when home other half time there's barely enough sauce coat wing  <EOR> Wings delicious lemon pepper favorite reasonably priced fast  Fried pickels bomb Only problem kids working kind dont care attitude but older employees good <EOR> Spot ! consistently awesome far greater  buffalo douche wings and wing stop  <EOR> I say hands down best wings Vegas date  am pretty fussy wings hit home run! Wings meaty well cooked nice crispy  Boneless wings some best ever had  Good amount all white meat chicken ton breading    We lemon pepper which real good  VooDoo sauce which very unique spicier side hint teriyaki  Bomb sauce which plenty hot very Louisiana Tabasco hot flavor  Ranch good little thicker am used to    I included pic sidewinder fries because no idea meant  wasn't crazy them but weren't particularly bad    The fried pickles outstanding! Great breading  Very southern    Oh ordered through yelp app picked drive thru  Very convenient   Definitely highly recommend place!! <EOR> I'm partially blame two three star review    I ordered mango habanero wings    And ended eating six Buffalo wings being p o'd fact    As soon ate first thought flavor off but cooked well crispy without being dry apparently really mood wings ate them all    So really glad Yelp doesn't comments section where people can't roast faulty logic behind three star review    Anyway just check everything your order before leave building  experience every other place should made that  But didn't  now salty  <EOR> We love place  regulars point  best buffalo wings fries  mild sauce husband likes BBQ garlic sauce  would highly recommend it  Only downside if want drink sweet tea counter refills believe ice machine soda tap doesn't work ask ice well  way food worth trouble  <EOR> Never coming again  wings taste water seasoning just gross  Same price Wingstop if you're getting 24 wings  won't veggies though you'll small dressing  <EOR> Their sauces no joke only does bomb bring heat but nice amount flavor  wasn't challenge today but soon  Chose voodoo sauce sample decent heat but packed deliciousness  update review another visit two but far impressed food service  <EOR> Again Sam crew top game   I just love place crew   hope guys great success just weekly 'fix'  <EOR> We finally decided try place other day  smell chicken frying side  Which wife happy because love chicken wings but walking wasn't great  smell oil front door right like old stale oil when walk in  wanted something could eat thru day cause just wanted lazy lounge all day ordered go  wait wasn't long which always happy    We ordered total 30 wings all day long Netflix binge watching session  medium hot buffalo style hot wings made franks hot sauce brand  lemon pepper chicken wings  extra ranch    Once home opened wings transferred wings into bowls disappointed much oil bottom each box  lemon pepper did taste lemon pepper all maybe oil took flavor away don't know but basically waste money  best flavor buffalo hot wings medium greasy just mixed them buffalo hot    All all give place three five stars  IF ever tried place again would definitely ask no excessive oil check boxes before leaving  <EOR> BEST WINGS EVER!

OMG! Try place  won't disappointed  <EOR> half lemon pepper half hot w side fries tall cook Tasia really does stuff when she's kitchen  definitely place should check if chicken <EOR> Maybe because Vegas flooded subpar chains B dubs Wing Stop but if ask hard find consistently good wings city  when saw VooDoo Wings opening only 10 minutes away hit top bookmark list pretty quick  now couple times mixed feelings     First all location hit miss  If you've area before you've probably seen particular spot through few business changes  most recent Guthrie's didn't last long all  Aside looks fresh coat paint some new wall décor place hasn't changed much  nice see kept drive thru though since there's definitely very few places wings one  biggest gripe much businesses before VooDoo seems having issues keeping place clean  both visits walked into nearly empty restaurant several tables visibly dirty  considering amount staff behind counter each time don't quite happens   As far menu obviously just mainly wings sides  wings offered guess call personal size orders 6 9 12  Then also large orders 24 48 75 100  There's also 10 sauces choose handful sides available  pricing pretty dang reasonable just over $2 even smaller wing orders combo includes both side drink  also VooDoo includes both celery carrots dipping sauce advertised price    So now couple times able try couple different sauces  While most them pretty standard offer couple sort unique flavors  first Voodoo sauce which describe mix Sriracha soy sauce  ended ordering flavor both visits sadly tasted different each time  first time way sweet second mostly just heat even though love Sriracha just wasn't right flavor  also Sweet Heat flavor which bit similar BWW's Asian Zing name suggests good balance both sweet spicy flavors  But biggest problem VooDoo all sauces just put way much them  Every time finish eating there's still pool sauce sitting bottom boat  flavors good sauces but just enough where want feel drinking when eat wings   I've also noticed both visits few wings seem undercooked  Each time least 1 2 wings orders stage where probably safely edible but just tasty edible  meat still kind gooey limp  ended having throw them away because just hard eat  Aside those though rest wings very decent  just ordering mine well done now on  fast food style joint sides pretty solid  no complaints any things tried fried pickles french fries coleslaw    Overall VooDoo definitely welcome addition what's available town  food decent priced right always nice another choice wings  definitely returning some point but aren't doing anything well enough stop search consistently good wings Vegas  <EOR> This place amazing!
