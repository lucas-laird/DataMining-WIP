Gross!  server I cannot remember name pleasant but she slow   waited 20 minutes drinks   then charged almost $10 some lemonade!!  bread good   you should never wrong there   but service crap   Mom ordered soup server said two cups   no way possible  don't even serve bread bowl    the positive mgr comp'd meal   but didn't stop being hungry    she said cook wanted eagerly serve us    with raw fish??!!  really??!!  The second location across Caesar's palace   our server Kat   major improvement other spot  She courteous good server   She tended needs didn't ask anything which nice I would come back location VS other one     <EOR> There far better steak options strip   You're probably coming because want something familiar someone else suggested it   We June 2015   Waiter good enough guy service decent   I ordered cobb salad which listed mixed greens iceberg lettuce   Should've known better   Probably least exciting salad long time   realize isn't speciality but know    hard salad appealing especially if followed own directions used mixed greens instead iceberg   I'm complain free food ate salad coworkers wouldn't meal disrupted   all seemed enjoy more did   Do yourself favor try Gordon Ramsay's Steak over Paris   Much better presentation food just much better every way much classier but unfortunately lot more expensive   Even if don't Ramsay's tv shows he very wealthy well known chef reasons beyond personality  <EOR> I lunch day because all restaurants near Sands Expo super crowded  smaller side upstairs  shrimp appetizer grilled shrimp coconut shrimp  also side steamed veggies  shrimp pretty good heavy  veggies soft flavorful  I could taste butter! Overall fine lunch good service  if don't want wait  <EOR> Great service enjoyed food but just ribeye ordered little dry liking medium well steak  <EOR> I probably said previous reviews location but Outback hidden above Casino Royale Strip  always eat bar area since there's usually only two us  larger filet mignon split ordering baked potato salad honey mustard dressing  Then just order second salad we're set  think they've raised prices since last time $39 95 larger filet but mentioned other posts Vegas guess fell people extra money  connected Casino Royale use your comp dollars towards your bill   Worth shot if you're Harrahs Casino Royale feel having great steak  Enjoy! <EOR> This restaurant great service food   Scott outstanding server very attentive customer service   cooks restaurant best Outback offer any location at   food Scott goo stopped second time but told he working   Keep good work! <EOR> We prime rib lobster tail ribeye wings everything very tasty  waitress Cynthia she very good  She very attentive  Food served very quickly  <EOR> One better restaurant experience trip  While hotel rates dropping food not   While revel number choices Strip offers spiraling economy always think tourist trap   unfortunate experience not named but reviewed Japanese restaurant earlier week   business trip while fellow colleagues visited rather posh restaurants    family and no did expense meals! demanded least nice dinner during trade show week   I mood decent steak place anticipated paying little more but trying keep tab under $100 three   complaints Outback $$$    deserved   But corporate franchise name convenient location many patrons spending own money   Welcome Las Vegas     Walking inside Casino Royale finding somewhat secret elevator found creaky floor lobby Outback   wait but terribly long   given table near bar ordered rare cocktail   server offered pleasant suggestion extra $1 extra shot dizzy juice   long day stuffed monkey suit its good advice   bread did resist ordering appetizer   Wanting experiment Prime grade fillet while wife Choice   mood splurge ordered lobster tail     Prime versus Choice prime more tender choice but unsure if its noticeable worth extra dollars      The Lobster Tail incredibly good!  daughter side table meal   didn't need any butter   Desert Giant brownie cake ice cream top   Though no cake *under* ice cream form cheating enough three     The Service very pleased relieved treated well   Though busy night server found time sure okay water glasses empty     The Damage tip came near $120   wanted treat myself did  <EOR> Other being nearly impossible fact pretty much drive strip Outback awesome   Inside Casino Royale but upstairs middle slot action Outback stays open late   party 7 showed 10pm Thursday night seated pretty quickly   Food all really good   fact Outback special friend tastier any Outback special any other location lot Outback's day   Mahi Mahi which really good quality but somewhat flavorless   Definitely great option when big party all want steaks without going broke!

Queensland Shrimp Chicken Pasta  pasta little kick it  Ordered wings came ranch + blue cheese dressings  Service great! <EOR> Questa catena di ristoranti è un punto di riferimento per chi viaggia  Il menù è ricco e piatti sono abbondanti e buonissimi  Il loro antipasto classico è la cipolla gigante fritta o bloomin onion e merita sicuramente un assaggio  Il filetto è semplicemente spettacolare! 11oz di carne morbida e succulenta servita con purè di patate o patatine fritte accompagnate magari da una buona birra Sam Adams e Blue Moon le mie favorite   Il personale è cordiale e sempre attento  <EOR> Went mom dinner  rib steak bone good  sides basic  Food gets 3 stars but service provided Cynthia amazing!! <EOR> Walked around Strip hungry  feet killing me  Decided try place since nearby thought why not?

However prices slightly higher other Outbacks  didn't even know legal franchise  But guess anything Vegas eh?

SERIOUSLY disappointing   This location meant busiest Outback world  cannot even beging believe considering weekend evening seated straight away and lot empty tables    So good experience  Oh Nothing    Firstly because location strip prices suddenly increased  steaks much more expensive any other Outback ever to  instead hubby pork chops burger  started onion bloom   No bread given us guessing because decided steak werent seen worthy it  Whatever   The onion greasy very greasy am sure oil used old  also didnt taste great    My burger ok fries meh  food? ok  but then he always ok food  must picky   Whilst place quiet wait ages bill  service great place didnt seem clean  wont even into state restroom place needs refresh completely  Its wonder quiet  <EOR> The food great server Lloyd awesome perfect dinner end trip Vegas! <EOR> Went few friends blown away awesome service was  Specifically completely due waiter Robert  guy amazing  Very attentive awesome demeanor just great guy all aspects  If must ask Robert  Amazing food well per usual  <EOR> 3 words NO NO NO!! coming avid Outback lover!
