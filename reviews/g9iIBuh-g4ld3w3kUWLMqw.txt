When waitress came back let know happened  She super apologetic some slices replace lost but time didn't even want anymore  On plus side legit beer bar would back strictly that  A new bar opened back patio which really want visit but don't open til 8 eating early night  Next time  <EOR> I pizza granted closing 10p Thur night only serving slices   thought pizza well few drinks around downtown   ordered slice mushroom managed finish order another slice before kitchen officially closed   ordered another mushroom time tell kinda half assed making cheese pizza putting mushrooms top cooked   way good buzz couldn't tell difference   wouldn't mind trying place again sober! <EOR> Great pizza amazing beer selection very reasonable prices  great find highly recommend when visiting Freemont Street just end across Heart Attack Grill <EOR> They've really gone downhill new location  More money less quality  downtown location twice wont mistake trying 3rd time   This past time ordered chicken fingers garlic parm fries received burnt chicken pieces sweet potato fries  server wasn't aware normal fries  She ended comping chicken fingers   Pizza greasy lacked flavor    Upside better selection beers even when first opened shop downtown  But other places good beer ill there   Two stars because least waitress friendly  <EOR> My friend decided try place show right across street   walked quarter 2am so   asked if still open if still pizza slice   said yes walked counter   younger girl register absolutely rude   She phone also cursed entire time stood waiting pizza  She completely unprofessional   finally pizza   friend finished pretty quickly   quarter left mine   when started turn lights   Which fine when turned down main light   But then everyone two 'servers' cooks started waiting door continued turn off all rest lights even though still dirty tables clean   wasn't trash napkins found   finally fed obvious kicking out  walked pizza hand 2 08am   If norm service won't back   pizza ok but there's definitely other pizza joints Fremont much better service much better pizza   beer also overpriced  <EOR> Very good service  Food awesome!

We originally came watch Women's FIFA final one girlfriend's soccer fanatic took seat bar  bartender working greeted right away offered water menus  asked if would put soccer game male worker possibly server manager? tried game TVs without any luck  5 minutes he let know having technical difficulties wouldn't able play game apologized  thanked trying headed search another bar since friend determined watch game   We heading towards Fremont just passed Park when guy working TVs came running let know able game on! still debating where indecisive happily back Radio City Pizzeria   The bartender welcomed back ordered some drinks  stuck house white wine friends beers house red  ordered build your own pizza which GINORMOUS! 19 pizza more enough feed 4 us  many toppings choose although ran mushrooms all agreed small variety meat veggies  taste pizza slightly above average but when see come freshly baked can't complain!   The bartender very attentive ensured always full alcoholic beverage ice water front us  She super sweet engaged throughout entire game  didn't name but she big long wavy red hair  She definitely added pleasant experience pizzeria    Drinks pretty average priced around $6 $10 per draft beer glass wine  If craving pizza downtown I'd still prefer Pizza Rock    I'd give place 5 stars service 3 food! would give overall 3 5 if possible  <EOR> Pizza GOOD!!! Customer service UGH   My friend saw place opening months ago very excited try it  always happy hour downtown Vanguard figured would perfect place grab bite pizza drinking  assumed they'd offer pizza slice because pretty much every pizza joint Downtown does   Upon entering noted hostess stand outside but no hostess walked in  space SMALL  soon walked already pizza place  no area stand around look fool if don't know where you're going  Luckily hostess would turn into waitress arrived   She asked if two said yes she seated restaurant section which basically right next bar section    decor nicely set except fact overload televisions  every single them basketball  friend came conclusion space over Tivoli Village must bigger just weren't willing give all those flat screens hey just put 'em everywhere  Seriously guys lose some TVs  Your customers miss them   The night offering limited menu upfront which nice  least didn't through full menu decide something did have  BUT disappointed see menu offered no option just ordering slice  over decided order 18 Viva Las Vegas which pepperoni meat can't remember right now onions yellow peppers white sauce  All specialty pizzas sound really good would back try more  Sometimes places specialty pizzas you're WTF?
