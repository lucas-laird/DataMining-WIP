Laughing dancing all   Decent place party  smaller side around 100 people    But food just average nothing could find special all   appetizers bland   Chicken fingers ranch breaded calamari marinara?  greatest because definitely frozen scratch   Soggy bits everywhere   The party buffet spread some Giuseppe's offerings   say though none really all spectacular   definitely rang 'bar food' me   but great bar food find other spots watering holes   just unimpressive Giuseppe's   Their Italian Chopped Salad romaine salami capocolla zucchini gorgonzola tomato roasted peppers red onion tossed hour Italian dressing   ok par would find lots Italian joints   did soggy though buffet line passed since tossed dressing ahead time    On buffet line also roasted potatoes fresh mixed vegetables penne pasta wtih Giuseppe's tomato sauce  breaded chicken breast peppers mushrooms wine glaze   All average nothing couldn't made yourself your own kitchen   Although say tomato sauce isn't bad hoping use high quality San Marzano tomatoes sauce but knows!  Chicken moist tender but lacking flavor department nothing robust   I think best thing buffet line probably pizza Giuseppe's put out   suckers huge sheets!  New York Style   know loves some NY style pizza!  slices actually squares cheese pepperoni   Pretty good!  Crust thin but crispy sauce tangy sweet cheese gooey pepperoni salty oily   better pizza but bit Godsend because rest food inviting   Giuseppe's open 24 hours day going meal anytime isn't problem   think problem might getting repeat customers if food isn't par   offer lot Italian specialties menu but don't think going way near future meal here   Most would probably order pizza takeout! <EOR> First visit last night dinner  I asked staff suggestions   Cavatelli which featured items menu  It prepared commercially compose frozen meatballs  disappointment! If wanted frozen food reheated could've eaten home freezer  <EOR> The food definitely 4 5 star especially considering price  However agree previous reviews regarding service  Slow molasses main entree delivered before appetizers didn't receive glass water until end meal  think settle take place  <EOR> I keep trying place once year never learn lesson  good Italian food  Just sandwich burger  Tonight 10 7 13 server poor  Prices gone too  Why???  Again just sandwich  <EOR> I absolutely love food! best french dip sandwich pizzas loaded toppings  Really nice staff pretty quick service  <EOR> This review West Horizon Ridge location  Blch Blch   ordered spaghetti  time  but served giant dog dish used call left over spaghetti  throw sauce cover spaghetti stir pot spaghetti  its goolosh   serve when poor   now pound left over spaghetti white dog dish  tasted bland  no taste  picked  told them put box  took home thru some Ragu over  edible  Thanks Ragu    ever happened white spaghetti rich tomato sauce over it  ?????  I said would give place second try  ordered flat bread pizza  well looked good  but first crust 2 inches hard rock  If tried eat crust would broken tooth  ate  luke warm centers paid bill left     Forget place  Chef Ramsey would closed place down long time ago    They seem disorganized no quality control business  name  but  all place  <EOR> A great lunch spot! couple coworkers frequent establishment often  Maybe because darn close office but mostly because its pretty reasonable pretty darn good   They great food most part great service  Only couple times run into some extremely slow service while eating bar area  Haven't run into bad food yet knock wood!   Normally try catch two appetizers Tuesdays but such big selection can't resist other days  most recent selection cran feta chicken salad added own touch blue cheese  marriage sweet vinaigrette tangy blue cheese just outstanding me  serious cravings those two flavors combined  salad also contained dried cranberries walnuts chicken  presentation nice chicken perfectly chopped  gigantic oversized slices tend find  portion little over top  Maybe if bf he would able finish salad size but literally forced myself eat much could left miserably full  probably favorite salad moment    Other items pleasure include buffalo sliders Joey d sliders open face sandwich cheese ravioli Alfredo which btw tasted if ravioli hand frozen   best cheese ravioli but again ran into portion size being large me  eat bird am pretty well built girl normally feel oink out  just can't seem finish plate guess  Maybe because don't Deegan share me  Whatever end wasting bit food    One thing forgot mention house made potato chips  all literally obsessed single those waste table  Sometimes ladies order go    If you're smoker would suggest eating bar area unless don't mind smoke  Both ladies eat smoke normally ruled eating dining area  being ex smoker but never enjoyed smoking eating same time  Disgusting! <EOR> Watch large party 18% gratuity found charge sales tax gratuity according nevada tax law yes did call nevada tax department confirm if give gratuity employees cannot charge sales tax gratuity case means just give gratuity state why want support such restaurant give all gratuity state rather own employees? what's point service charge then? but when talked manager she mentioned did give gratuity employees but when talked another manager next day he just simply argue  system set can't anything it   top food ok think overpriced if sensitive smoke place bar within restaurant where people smoke even though all covered still smell it   back because being shady charging sales tax gratuity  <EOR> I ordered delivery pizza wings years ago since near house just ok  always heard pasta great  finally chance eat going order go to pasta which Fettuccine Chicken Alfredo but since cousin wanted same decided order wekend special which Chicken Scampi  really liked although wasn't traditional scampi before  2 slices chicken breasts which lot based serving pasta plate  sauce red green bell peppers trhe consistency creamy little tanginess  actually liked lot  Now bites alfredo well great  actually ordered few days delivered place because good  <EOR> I eat regular basis business networking group meets say look forward food time time again  Everything tried full flavor cooked perfectly pork chops burger  Great atmosphere even met owners  <EOR> It says lot when walk customer telling waitress Heather you're amazing    We came enjoy some sports cold brews  didn't lot selection draft but your average beers available  food good above average any other bar food would typically find   We enjoy beers food but especially service  Heather actually amazing   It also restaurant area if want sit bar   P S  bread give before your food yummy !!! <EOR> Located way off Las Vegas Strip locals hangout lot fun  food great staff very nice  mention drinks very good well  place clean cannot say same every locals bar grill plenty room move around  should also mention bar area where smoking allowed closed off smoke doesn't permeate rest joint trust big deal  Live Las Vegas cryin' loud! <EOR> As towner cousin suggested place lunch which going some time now fans of   hear even homemade cannolis!

After things little frenzied primarily because ordered more items needed able flesh more comprehensive review restaurant's offerings  Since no veal available only sometimes few specials day opted Spaghetti Meat Sauce plus meatball mushrooms which came cup soup day salad  discussed waiter whether order two meatballs he suggested because meat sauce  Since also several small meatballs order Wedding Soup boy he ever right! am sucker Italian Wedding Soup next Onion Soup Gratinee favorite soup  when saw menu just could pass by  because soup day interesting sounding Stuffed Green Pepper Soup love stuffed peppers ordered too  Plus since regular Dinner Salad Caesar Salad came wife's order Chicken Parmigiana she doesn't eat any vegetables other potatoes also going consumed me  which caused traffic control problems table    After empty Calamari plate cleared Stuffed Green Pepper Soup Caesar Salad delivered table next  which fine along very good Italian bread offered vinegar oil  But ask butter twice before came wait awhile replenishment glass Sprite second soup  When Wedding Soup did finally arrive giant bowl could comfortably serve four  Yet all mine  quickly downed Stuffed Green Pepper Soup which simply superb  dish featured ground beef well cooked pieces carrot celery flavorful broth tasted exactly stuffed green pepper  except soup contained small torpedo shaped dissolini noodles instead rice  then took awhile eat fresh tasting LARGE Caesar Salad its crispy romaine lettuce croutons fresh Parmesan Cheese shavings finished very nice smooth creamy Caesar dressing while second soup waiting  only discordant note involving salad finding small piece inedible bottom head lettuce mixed greens  least saw before tried eat it!   I halfway through second soup entrees arrived  But can't really fault restaurant pileup food table  once tasted Wedding Soup obvious just made scratch kitchen  Therefore probably took long construct soup spaghetti meat sauce meatball mushrooms  dining companions right fed without waiting finish off all several ordered preliminary dishes    With tasty meatballs large leaves spinach floating very tasty broth second soup also excellent   But course much it!  Even wasn't going let any waste devoured all  Surprisingly pasta dish still piping hot when began tackle it  its immense size laden meat sauce imposing entree looked meatball topped volcano spaghetti recently erupted discharged dark brown lava meat sauce down its sides  only dish night which thrilled first brush sauce tasted more bitter sweet  Real Parmesan Cheese grated onto friendly server dish still good  just sweet sauce prefer  But home next day lunch pleased any trace bitterness microwaved meat sauce all gone    Since everything homemade just couldn't resist all tempting items presented large dessert cart  glad didn't  slice Lemon Meringue Pie fresh very lemony delicious just supple hunks Fried Dough sprinkled sugar    This very pleasant satisfying dining experience  <EOR> I grew going Chicago spend summers grandparents   my grandfather introduced love Italian beef sandwiches     So now grown at least think am live far away can't favorite sandwich Portillo's which way best ever tasted but anyway   I fix when Temecula drink wine because lucky opened franchise way   yet digress     Last week stopped Giuseppe's dinner noticed Italian Beef sandwiches menu   so asked bartender hey any good? mean really any good?
