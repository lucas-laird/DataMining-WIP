Yes if happen area needed some spice burn various toxins Strip  <EOR> So two times both times left somewhat numb tongue but perfectly ok that   If don't spicy mild dishes but spicy place great   really cold bar change somewhat every now then   also probably some most reasonably priced food place $4 50 plate 3 choices   When comes hot food really love lamb dishes   Yes little oily but think flavor spot on   letting sit rice bit cools rice picks flavor   Also place very traditional serve offal   tripe pleasantly surprised it   wasn't very chewy didn't gamey flavor used tripe   On whole would definitely come back if don't want traditional Chinese food restaurant experience although those dishes non adventuresome eaters  <EOR> Excellent Szechuan  personal favorite Las Vegas   We Boiled Fish Hot Sauce crayfish hot sauce finally Szechuan flavored noodles  fish excellent  dish order every time come Szechuan place expected tender fish flavorful hot oil perfect hit spiciness  crayfish great well  expected overwhelm its spice but very flavorful  rich spicy salty tad sweet  Very great complex flavors there  also fresh server explained cooking them beforehand  Lastly Szechuan noodles perfect finishing touch  weren't hot which perfect everything beforehand was  Instead great tang vinegar slight sesame oil taste them  Everything great    The service great  waitress spoke English well enough even able explain items us  She prompt service very nice towards end meal when restaurant suddenly swamped service she never lost beat  interior really nice well  Modern traditional touches very clean    Do yourself favor come instead going others Las Vegas  Great service flavorful food decent prices  Can't wait come back try some other dishes  <EOR> Don't restaurant! sell higher price menu when call check!!! also waitress ask tips no matter bad service food asked least 15% purchase tips told  America's law  starting scared would call police if don't pay tips pay less 15%? Lol     <EOR> This place disaster! Waitresses very busy dining enviroment bad  hubby waited over hour served  food tasts just so  worst part price pay  different shown menu  If ask tell price raw material increased ask whatever price want?! Ridiculous!!! <EOR> ?????? <EOR> I came family couple weeks ago lunch  picked place because always used come Szechuan food fix  When only two other tables customers even though only 12 30pm   We started off two plates cold dishes which always used favorite  If you're fan cold spicy dishes recommend ???? basically Chinese cold cuts   family also ordered ???? Boiled Fish Sliced Hot Sauce ??? Chicken Chilies ????? One Choy Garlic White Sauce ???? Cumin Lamb ???? Sliced Pork Spicy Garlic Sauce   Flavor wise everything good but spice level all  weak family usually sweaty snotty verge tears when rest family just eating away  While food flavorful definitely spicy  dishes ordered would probably recommend Cumin Lamb just because most authentic opinion   Service mediocre best  food took while come even though only table ordered food point the other tables already almost done eating time ordered   also forgot Sliced Pork Spicy Garlic Sauce  although  cold dish came last  also playing some sort religious program really loudly TV which little distracting   At end meal asked if we'd willing pay cash instead credit which fine with  think little bit discount but unfortunately don't remember much  Anyway little disappointed all all  very satisfying meal family  <EOR> I think take review spoon soy sauce if if reviewer slams Chinese restaurant prefers eat place called BBQ King  Tom Coliccio's Crafsteak MGM getting bad review someone prefers eat Denny's   This place pretty good   give some flexibility credit first reviewer she probably wasn't accustomed eating Szechuan cuisine probably did know expect   cold appetizers good choose three per plate   Szechuan style lamb but substituted beef ma po tofu which spicier Jennifer Lopez before music career tanked      This place definitely bland heart   The Americanized inexperienced Chinese food eater should avoid place those Chinese food places sell lottery tickets egg fu yung   Those want spicier take authentic Chinese food should check place     For good spicy Szechuan place gets 4 stars! <EOR> One favorite place ! Never bad meal  everyone  authentic south western China cuisine very very spicy! <EOR> We came busy time treated if buffet customers only no food ready chase owner order meal  When did order only avalaible entrees ones easy cook expensive  quick meal became 3 course dinner each entree came already finished last rice came finished everything   After paid owner asked Why no tip? Ha! worst dining experience ever   Oh last thing wife cook better  <EOR> Great tasting food all great price  language barrier but just point menu      Worth it  <EOR> Terrible authentic Szechuan taste all charge white rice soft drinks especially expensive two plates costs $43 total even enough great meal any steak road house other Chinese restaurant  <EOR> Don't all wonder why restaurant few  customers because new management suck good  place eat trust disappointment when come food tastes really bad don't come place service terrible recommended don't fool your customers restaurant funky smell bad cold dish buffet notice bad food day day very old kitchen floor very dirty all veg all old stale rip customers off yourself favor don't tell all your friends family all meat spoiled <EOR> cold plate seemed little old but overall taste okay  Waitress pretty friendly  <EOR> Not only hotpots even accommodate takeout order! under $20 feed two full size adults spicy seafood laden meal  Would suggest extra side rice though   The crawfish cucumber ? can't remember actual name but easily over pound crawfish  They're season small freshest but dish itself good combination chilis seafood veggies sauce addictively spicy delicious   Would back popular lamb dishes but would choose dine in  Though takeout best way experience cuisine  But hey if you're crunch    <EOR> Our first visit 3 years ago only mildly impressed  became huge fans Yunan Garden instead  But Yunan Garden recently become very mild also expensive  When order item Boiled Fish hot sauce want least feel little burn  Maybe some tourists still find spicy but its just authentic  long story short revisited J J last week blown away  Boiled Fish spot eyes watering! Oh authentic Szechuan missed much!! mushroom hot pot great side dish very impressed  back!  great service time unexpected well I'd even call tourist friendly! <EOR> The sour soup fish menu shows using live fish  reality frozen fillet  Huge disappointment  hope picture menu least somehow reflect would get  rice raw too  <EOR> Sometimes best meals hole wall joints   Certainly case J J   Just aware cab back strip might require calling one    Amercanized Chinese  <EOR> I eat spicy food much possible  dish  suits appetite  <EOR> The service terrible  even want charge 15% tip kind terrible service  food just soso  never place again  <EOR> It's tough find authentic szechuan food but definitely getting more popular   J J authentic szechuan but just good szechuan   We ordered 4 different dishes boiled lamb hot pot pork intestines hot peppers pork blood bean sprouts hot pot cold dish beef tripe   The boiled lamb cold dish best dishes both decently done but spectacular  flavor okay quality lamb beef good portion right   would expect quality szechuan place   The pork intestines hot peppers bad dish   intestines properly cooked but ZERO flavor dish   if intestines just deep fried then thrown top hot peppers even stir fried rest ingredients   The pork blood bean sprouts hot pot just all over place   flavro fine but pork blood good   low quality overcooked   Then also within dish slices bologna   BOLOGNA   YES   WTF?!?!  Why earth would anyone put bologna dish filler?  no clue         plus wasn't mentioned menu   All all place actually isn't terrible but definitely would call good  service actually good waitress quite accommodating   However szechuan food really don't care service decor much food   Really should 2 5 stars but can't give 3     Do yourself favor Yunnan Garden place  much better  <EOR> False advertisement dishes  prices seem reasonable but actually isn't worth because don't enough content price  Very disappointed  Bad service also  coming back  authentic SzeChuan food either  <EOR> 1  authentic all let alone food quality bad   2  say 5% discount cash  But refuse issue receipt  same time still charging full amount tax handwritten   figure  <EOR> We absolutely LOVE place  neighborhood pretty authentic  Shredded Pork Bean curd hot pot salt pepper ribs  Excellent!  also love service!

To add insult injury or injury insult? wonder which worst friend found random string knows Lamb Hot Pot   should taken picture first   Because when showed waitress she dismissed just piece noodle It right table  Try eating it!   Then she said string noodle package just picked without offering apology  Yeah only smart thing she did  rid evidence!  So inconsistency served even if secret off menu item already big red flag never return again  But fact foreign object found food customer received No F Given attitude when confronted just final nail coffin   So yeah even Asian Chinese restaurant standards place crap service subpar food   Thus probability return less 0 1%   But event zombie apocalypse bookmark place since still low other people's list places scavenge food    1 star because half stars supported Yelp  <EOR> The spicy boiled fish excellent spicy fried chicken but stir fries vegetables very below par  won't deter returning though! eat vegetables eat super spicy Szechuan food definitely place that! <EOR> Worst Szechuan food ever tried    Food ingredient fresh all water boiled fish beef    Cold appetizer also fresh   Don't fool your customers  <EOR>
