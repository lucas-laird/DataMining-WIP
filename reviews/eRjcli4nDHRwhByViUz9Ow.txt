 Nope   ordered calzone which basically pizza folded half toppings stuffings       when write a pizza folded half toppings stuffings  exactly mean   ordering Spinach Calzone only finishing little less half counter girl told Rosati's calzones made MEDIUM SIZED PIZZA DOUGH stuffed accordingly   write criticize but warn you're going getting expected which sanely portioned calzone would satisfy person wasn't entering eating competition   arrived huger plate pizza sauce side garnish probably stuffed least three pounds cheese   am joking   really think three pounds cheese    far taste I'd rate calzone way salty truly enjoyable   favorite part closure part dough which only part didn't salty crust into salty cheese heck did happen? salty spinach   huge fan doughy things which most calzones supply very well but only featured cute braided looking closure      But did stop eating half monstrously sized calzone?  No did not   Yes ate pound half cheese some dough some saline spinach   enjoyed cheese dough  the spinach threw its brackishness   aggressively salted dough plus salty cheese needed some sort plain foil neutralize pungency   pizza sauce didn't help matters   Though little sweet course also salty rather unfortunately reminded something jar before grocery stores offered pasta pizza sauces actually something  you'd want your pizza pasta    If making sound awful really wasn't   wouldn't eaten much plus taken rest home eaten large part remnants breakfast   Plus somehow remain convinced if I'd gotten combo pizza calzone would tasted better   thing much less surface dough looking needs seasoning since most pizza crust covered sauce toppings   almost wonder if cooks thought Well looks bare   have?  Salt!  tastes good everything! [And came home today thought would taco but turned glorified quesadilla local Mexican place also giving definite 2 stars   Oy   don't know if ever want eat cheese again!]   wish could give place 3 stars friendly service nice ambiance but saline spinach knocked down least half point   there're no 2 1 2 star ratings Yelp   But if ever lost hungry Summerlin again might try pizza just see if right hunch if agree palates readers Las Vegas Weekly  <EOR> I starving stopped shopping center looking Slim's Sub Shop   disappointed see Slim's closed   time crunch saw Rosati's   I ordered 2 slices Cheese Pizza wanted bottle Water    the girl working register told bottled Water Strike 1     The pizza came few minutes   slices huge!  almost size small Pizza!  thought Pizza awful sauce tasted canned sauce Cheese flavorless thought crust undercooked rubbery Strikes 2 3 4   Since starving ate anyway except didn't eat crust    which rare always eat crust    it bad   I know place chain sure ever try again    not type place   prefer better quality pizza   Will return?
