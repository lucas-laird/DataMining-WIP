She rang everything    I looking eat meal just wanted check pastries  3 kinds Beef pastry looking forward trying hoping would somewhat similar tried different Cuban bakery Sahara something  Unfortunately fell short  wasn't enough beef inside it actually didn't even look beef inside    meat salty  couldn't finish whole thing    Cheese roll actually wasn't bad  sweet just right  would've loved see more cheese inside tho  barely anything inside    Guava pastry favorite three  However kept eating sweeter sweeter  sure supposed sweet but would've liked little less side  Really good tho!   I think place just opened couple months ago but hope able some changes food  sure everyone's made comparison porto's just can't compete  don't think would way place but if around area might give another shot  <EOR> Love place!!!

Sadly such bakeries few far between eagerly anticipating reopening Roly's now Sugar Corner   am assuming staff changed because food take out order such disappointment  mention many menu items now more expensive something didn't notice enthusiasm until ordered   pan con bistec steak sandwich used $8 Roly's wonderful sandwich nicely sized marinated steak fresh Cuban bread   time $15 ! ranchero steak sandwich tasteless frankly inedible  bread hard seemingly stale point throw away two bites  Cuban mother sad no longer guava cheese pastelitos but she said guava pastry she dry anyway  picadillo meat filling usually favorite pastry spicy side peppery taste Cuban although pastelito itself flaky enough  bakery used worth trip Summerlin but am sure still case  Yes place looks great but I'd rather older decor better food prices  <EOR> I craving Porto's guava pastries cheese rolls stumbled across Cuban bakery restaurant  took look menu but late afternoon just wanted take home few goodies  don't call place Sugar Corner nothing! Surely cut corners when comes sugar  thought pastries sweet taste but still edible    Items tried Guava turnover Coconut turnover Cheese roll  I liked guava turnover best  guava cream cheese inside flaky goodness outside  coconut turnover okay really me  did care version cheese rolls  did satisfy craving  needed more cheese inside less sugar outside    My initial frustrations confusion started 3 doors  Which entrance? lucky guess  Next seat myself just order counter? far counters looked 3 different areas obviously alcoholic drinks another closest pastries  wouldn't hurt place overhead sign order here  enough workers but did feel welcoming  ended seating myself since no menus wall counter  waiting couple minutes thought standing counter might some attention  Finally menu handed me  Maybe some time if am ever mood Cuban sandwich stop again    *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 35 100 <EOR> First all don't let reviews all doors scare you  only 3 try   entrance marked 'entrance'   easy enough  closest Trop   On important part    food drink!!
