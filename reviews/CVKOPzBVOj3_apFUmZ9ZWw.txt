Unlike most people frequented GR's fish chip shop did fish but instead plumped sausage hoping British style sausage  Again sadly disappointed  First sausage battered which personally cannot abide think totally unnecessary secondly sausage supplied anyway British style sausage but some hybrid texture British sausage but flavour some poncy high fallutin' lump sausage meat which messed no doubt someone somewhere thought recipe improved sausage but fact made sweetly flavoured which anyone know British sausages knows right  also just add insult injury two sausages two inches long served impaled wooden sticks  Although twee proper sausage should served  To sum then British fish chips British sausages hugely overpriced worth generally  Would bother going again  Thank you  <EOR> I came first time family knowing expect but server Scott's great recommendations all satisfied dinners  Thank Scott your fantastic service taking such great care us  coming back! <EOR> I am being hyperbolic but simply profound meal  ordered classic combo fish chips  truly amazed  very good fish chips such North Sea Bloomsbury when lived London but version Linq most outstanding all  batter perfect flaky fish inside  chips also perfectly cooked sauces remarkable  expecting but eating each bite thought myself best meals any sort experienced  know fish chips place fast casual but felt time  realize culinary experiences subjective  <EOR> This absolutely best fish chips had  small line around 6 30 Saturday but through line quickly  food AMAZING! making trip back craving food  writing this  <EOR> Came Tuesday lunch very disappointed  expected authenticity Gordon Ramsay  fish OK but 3 pieces just bigger thumb  The chips terrible metallic taste them  am sure type potatoes used but bad    I born parents Birmingham England  call myself expert but England couple dozen times  Besides Balti first thing usually doner meat chips know chips  If Gordon served chips England he would business no time   am big fan Gordon Ramsay expected much more  stick local chippy Alhambra CA   think best states  <EOR> Had fish chips $15  good Crown Anchor Tropicana  20 minutes line order 10 minutes wait food  $5 small glass Peach Ginger drink  Very bland worth it  <EOR> I visited Monday 11 21 2016 say highly disappointed  eating burgr planet Hollywood Gordon Ramsey Steak Paris hotel which both experiences excellent anywhere near Gordon's standards  ordered fish chips  Fair price food get  batter tasted good but fish itself no flavor!!

Ah well guess walk around looking blowfish rest time Vegas  recommend  <EOR> Little pricey but food dang good!  think guy Gordan Ramsey a hole but food dessert keep coming back unfortunately lol  Sticky toffee pudding!!! <EOR> Worst fish chips ever  Fish no flavor more batter then fish chips      mess fries   should've out <EOR> I town CES decided try place  small hole in the wall joint limited seating  couple big screen TVs atmosphere really casual  walk cashier order your food then call your number when your order ready   I standard fish chips combo  pick two dipping sauces  tried curry mango European mayo to dip fries Belgium Netherlands   must say Gordon Ramsay did great job place  fish light flaky dense greasy all loved curry mango sauce  Next time I'd probably just curry mango sauce both sauce choices   If you're looking inexpensive celebrity chef experience Vegas sure check place  <EOR> If appreciate good fish chips dish then place MUST your foodie bucket list!  Especially if visiting Las Vegas trying narrow down your choices dining establishments should your list    The  Best  Fish Chips  ever had  PERIOD   chips dirty mix #2 which truffle parmesan chives chips  Other seasoning choices include jalapeno chipotle chorizo flavor calcinatory spice basil    The fish fresh flaky batter just perfect amount crispiness fries fresh hot   loved variety dipping sauces choose too!  tried curry mango Gordon's tarter sauce   Both did disappoint!  Yum!    I highly recommend place if 1 big fan Gordon Ramsay 2 fish chips enthusiast 3 appreciate excellent tasting fresh food 4 and or don't want disappointed when leaving restaurant   This place pretty casual small if weather suits few seats outside   location right off main walkway opportunity good people watching if sit outside if you're into sort thing    Staff friendly establishment clean   serve Pepsi products but those cool flavor machines which more fun!  more could ask for?  two days since Gordon's fish chips kids just saying we'd wish could more already!  We love Chef Ramsay! <EOR> I surprised good was   smaller thought but certainly beats other fast food places   fish sauces great! <EOR> I decided check place because recommended friend  Also big Gordon Ramsay fan years try something inspired him! eaten huge brunch morning weren't really mood big meal perfect  decided box share which 15 bucks came drink  box consisted three pieces fish fries which really delicious   I wasn't expecting much going but totally exceeded expectations  fish flaky inside crispy outside  totally recommend putting lemon more flavor  fries delicious crispy well  curry ranch sauce complemented everything well   There aren't many places sit inside wouldn't come expecting sit down restaurant  Check if you're craving quick bite strip! <EOR> GR done again! another great restaurant!   First time here  I saw sign he another restaurant just opened just try it  It's located LINQ shopping area  It hard miss because nice ambiance restaurant    Went 5 more people just excited try place but highly recommended big groups because less 20 chairs inside restaurant  Yes place tiny  6 chairs outside eat but place new crowded   Menu small kinda confusing first but Alex kind friendly enough help he explained well us  Service fast    So far place is small could crowded confusing menu but only just service great also FOOD!!!!   I ordered shrimp chips combo which includes drink  came 5 jumpo huge deep fried delicious juicy shrimps thick well seasoned fries 2 great sauces choice tartar sauce good mayo alright but tried someone's mango curry sauce die drink peach ginger lemonade which refreshing other vanilla orange lemonade which tried small taste   also good but could only pick one   I tried fish also WOW! battered deep fried perfectly great taste fish fresh melts mouth   this place best quick bites take your hotel if restaurant already packed     I don't really place fish chips Vegas yeah now! <EOR> Wish could tried it  Rude woman door said closed technical difficulties  She definately Ray sunshine! Lol <EOR> The fish chips great!   fish house sauce Dijon mayo sauce  just plain fries  A little pricy   Best early   Lines very long  very good back again  <EOR> Fish chips done right    I 3 pieces fish chips chorizo jalapeños    I highly highly recommend place    If line don't worry moves fast    I don't want forget mention back twice during trip  <EOR> Really enjoyed fish chips!  The combo comes 3 pieces fish chips drink   Tip upgrade your fries dirty dirty # 2 yummy!  Sauces unique tasty tried curry tartar he siracha mayo tartar all great!  The place gets really busy 1pm limited seating little earlier seat   pepsi machine refill your drink well which nice   Perfect portion size fast service line fast   If can't seat walk little further towards high roller sit fountain  <EOR> The Linq Promenade offers many choices but quick tasty treat suggest Gordon Ramsay's Fish Chips   Two last night chose basic three pieces cod chips   would more options chips maybe something green   But overall value meal drink included OK   dipping sauces unique liked Ranch Curry Mango better Sriracha Aioli Tartar Sauce   fish itself perfectly cooked tender inside lightest batter ever eaten   usually pull stuff off but crisp brown complimented texture fish   chips so so  Do expect large comfortable place tiny crowded but definitely convenient fast   sat outside enjoyed watching  people passing by   All around fun experience! <EOR> Very good fish chips delicious options fries  3 pieces fresh fish fried perfection crisp tender fries  Comes regular soda too!  Also choice different sauces dips fish  Favorite house tartar sauce  Next time try shrimp chips  <EOR> Good place grab quick meal  Usual fish chip fare combo came 3 pieces fried cod crispy fries plus soft drink $15  order pay then call your number  Limited seating inside few tables bar eat outside  Several different dipping sauces including Gordon's tartar sauce which mayo w dill  drenched mine malt vinegar salt  Limited menu no mushy peas etc  Just basics well  know sounds pricey 3 pieces fish  think drink included lessened blow  Vegas where water cost $5  <EOR> I'm just gonna say Gordan Ramsay might just most overrated celebrity chef is    Walked excited fish chips  menu pretty confusing first part menu shows fries chips 5 99 something wow pretty good price fish chips but really $5 99 fries  middle page shows fish chips shrimp sausage fishwich chicken  price varies 13 99 15 99 depending protein want    I 14 99 fish chips + extra $ changing regular chips truffle fries chips  Really none worth all  fish way oily fish itself lack lot seasoning  suppose suppose use sauces but sauces pretty underwhelming well  Gordon's tartar sauce just taste any other tartar sauce  curry mango okay   I'm sure if really match fish chips  kinda end using ketchup dip fish some point would switch upon 3 kinda prefer using ketchup     The truffle chips fries wasn't anything great either  mentioned before fish oily if fish layered top oil just kinda made chips fries soggy  No bueno  more personal thing but much rather small fries chips med size fries chips    At end day just thought overpriced much gave but everything just lackluster terms taste quantity  back  <EOR> Was just looking light snack some friends stopped shared 3 piece combo  each piece fish upgraded fries dirty number 1 which includes chorizo jalapenos aioli some other delicious things   good news   the bad news main dish    entree unfortunately major let down really looking forward trying love fish but again major disappointment   fish extremely bland no seasoning flavorless if fries side dish better main course something's wrong   While place gets many stars place definitely packed unsure all hype is   Best sellers include upgraded fries house lemonade ginger different dipping sauces visit enough me  <EOR> Should called fish sticks fries cos definitely isn't proper fish n chips  no mushy peas either! Tastes ok but just nowhere near authentic  Shame Gordon Ramsay making look sound proper British fish n chip shop actually just another poor American version  If you're going something right     <EOR> Hello ello ello ello       what here????? Nudge Nudge     SAY NO MORE!!!!!  My Nana made great Perch fish fry during cottage years  She long gone but safely say Gordon Ramsey done again!!!! Mancrush Guy!!!  If your highly recommend fish chips anything Fish  ordered Fish Chip Combo    You your choices 3 dirty seasonings fries  Dirty #1 chipotle jalapeño crisp chorizo   The fish portions incredible served Superhot!!! Fish comes sauces well  srirachi aioli  Delish  Fish Right deep fry  batter clean frickin crisp  amazing crunch sound while devouring fish     AMAZING  DEAFENING!!!!! I recommend ordering Peach Ginger Lemonade wash down   That stuff could bottled sold $$ So refreshing   My companion Fishwich   Looked good he enjoyed tremendously   Wait time bit long depending time day  waited 20 minutes which found well worth it  Food reasonably priced  Very small space limited seating     no problem tho   plenty people watch outside doors off strip!!! <EOR> GR opened fourth Vegas restaurant specializing England's classic dish stick namesake menu item best results  Though every article announcing opening emphasizes small grab and go style spot wasn't tiny able snag seating outdoor bar area  repurposed phone booth entrance fun touch service friendly    The fish chips 3 piece $12 large portion two dipping sauces sriracha aioli good but GR's Tartar sauce great wish I'd tried curry mango sauce too  Chips saltier expected but fish large flaky pieces    I guy fish wich which surprisingly served pita  didn't really work breaded fish wrapped thick dough but guess flavors okay if you're into carbs carbs carbs  shishito pepper unexpected didn't really work either  took few bites tossed it   Despite restaurant name also shrimp chicken sausage available  back try version Sticky Toffee Pudding since ones Steak BurGR great! <EOR> Simply satisfying   I managed convince boyfriend leave air conditioned abode walk 10 minutes fish chips spot which nicely nestled alleyway food libations  food served quickly though place would benefited more cashier  There's handful indoor outdoor seats but might need wait open seats   We each fish chips combo which non advertised $11 99 without fountain drink $14 99 fountain drink  Upgrade your fountain drink lemonades $1 more upgrade fries natural dirty $2 more  Each combo comes 3 pieces lightly battered unsalted cod atop handful thick cut fries your choice 2 sauces  boyfriend curry mango sauce sriracha aioli Gordon's tartar sauce between us  tartar sauce refreshing both sriracha curry mango sauces slightly spicy  liked all 3! fish juicy batter oily  fried cod salty its own sauces important  fries nothing spectacular  peach ginger lemonade fantastic!  Overall fishy meal un fishy prices! <EOR> Best fish chips! tried once decided Vegas must eat us  menu pretty small but just fish chips you'll probabably want anyway  3 pieces fish combo they're pretty decently sized   They're fried fresh perfectly nice crispy You 2 sauces your order highly recommend curry mango sauce! Neither flavor overly strong pairs fish well    The combo comes plain fries drink  upgrade fries $2 3 different flavors seasoning   parmesan truffle chives best   meals also come drink but upgrade lemonade peach ginger orange vanilla which both pretty good    There's small seating area indoors might difficult find place sit eat esp if large group   But hasn't issue usually find seats people leaving  <EOR> Disappointing   The gf visiting Vegas thought we'd check place out  fish chips truffle fries  Fries Felt overcooked  don't know if  they're supposed hence name chips but would wished just little less crunch  Also bland  If wasn't truffles would tasted nothing  Fish Bland  quality fish seemed decent  batter good  But why bland? really could used salt pepper  don't think used any all  Coming restaurant Gordon Ramsay's name disappointing say least  Price Way overpriced  3 pieces fish some fries $15    Never again  Maybe unlucky but going trying place again  <EOR> I chance try place out  layout eatery made heavy take orders because tables size place crowded really quickly  However service fast friendly  ordered Shrimp Chips Curry Mango European Mayonnaise sauces  curry mango favorite due slight heat while euro mayo just light tasting general me  shrimp nicely done well chips fries also ordered Peach Ginger Lemonade which very good only downside meal price but guess because novelty Gordon Ramsay name fact Las Vegas strip made more expensive then would normally be  Overall nice place  <EOR> Fish Chips good! Just bit pricey opinion  but food top notch sauce options awesome! <EOR> I really excited try place high expectations but just average    This review only fries  ordered truffle Parmesan chives fries which comes your choice 2 dipping sauces  sriracha aioli curry mango  sauces exotic sure may everyone but grew me  fries crispy but didn't much else going them  lacked flavor toppings evenly distributed e g  huge chunk chives corner box most fries left more less bare   felt definitely could've executed better considering almost $8 small serving fries Gordon Ramsey restaurant but hey    I did enjoy British vibe all around almost reminded being back Europe  don't think would back just fries again but definitely better fries n night before   It's located between Linq Flamingo next frozen daiquiri bar  lots other restaurants nearby well  <EOR> Not worth hype  kitchen line slow molasses screwed two orders row  Best things lemonade tartar sauce  <EOR> Fish crispy outside delicious tender inside  Fries hot crispy  loved it! Thought price perfect meal beer Vegas  <EOR> I highly disappointed place  wait long line which understandable place this  But food good  First all half fish pieces wasn't even covered batter person serving dropped another piece counter front then put back box  Also hated taste batter  tasted burnt oil  previously disappointed Chef Ramsay's other restaurants  honestly don't think he would eat plate served us! <EOR> How cool Gordon Ramsay's Fish Chips directly outside hotel staying while Vegas! excitement through roof  When saw come Strip bookmarked eagerly waiting chance in   I believe fish chips more average person but found both super tasty better other places! even better though choice sauce came fish chips! husband ordered just box Gordon's Tartar Sauce Sriracha Aioli  box 3 pieces fish large enough two share  Normally when share husband eats more but time stealing many bites could! course if really wanted could probably eaten whole thing myself and really full but resisted   Overall felt price fair due quantity  did pay extra Orange Vanilla Lemonade lieu pop   probably only thing wouldn't next time since lemonade way tart fancy pop machine variety flavors!

Worth checking quick bite sure! <EOR> Thought would great choice during stay Ceasars  Thought wrong  Wife both ordered 14oz Rib Eye cooked medium  raw she send back  Mine edible but left probably third chewed plate  tough grisly both fully chew up  disappointment because looking forward eating there  No ever came asked food anything else food delivered  thinking Ramsey maybe should sure place purchasing good grade beef  Pretty crappy presentation $50 steak  Most definitely worth it  won't back  <EOR> If you've never fish chips before then don't start because everything else won't satisfy  rarely ever good fish chips but GR never seems fail please palate  servings pretty generous shared plate girl saved other plate later fish still crispy flavorful  fan most sauces but can't wrong tartar sauce ketchup right? Sadly didn't try shrimp any other menu item but plenty happy fish  only real down side lack seating because place gets packed could used sticky toffee pudding dessert other restaurants have  <EOR> I am big fan fish chips am picky well  ordered fish chips regular fries  1 order fish chips cheap $15 per order  hoping fish chips worse money spent    The fish well cooked dry all  outer layer very crispy! came 2 dressings  chose tar tar sauce curry mango took risk curry mango   curry mango surprisingly refreshing little bit spicy flavor!   The chips toward crispy side which like! Love meal here   Sittings limited both indoor outdoor   Line could long during lunch time  <EOR> Decor 4 5 Limited seating inside even out  noticed strangers sharing bench eat  sat down curb eat fish chips  Service 4 5 Expect wait if come during prime time  would recommend coming around 3pm when lunch rush dies down Once food ordered wait 5 minutes which isn't bad  Food 4 5 5 The fish legit  three pieces fragile come apart when dip into sauce  batter flaky fish moist  would recommend sharing entree unless want into food coma The chips mediocre nothing good say them <EOR> It all right  Based recommendations elevated meal lobster shrimp  lobster absolutely destroyed trunk size cork inside batter  say batter pretty tasty but fried food just OK  enjoyed other restaurants much more  Once place your order stand around common area waiting your order called  time ordered time food 22 minutes  way long some french fries fried shrimp fried lobster tail  Also if want drink if squeeze into very tight area again crowded people waiting food  <EOR> I shrimp chips combo friend chicken chips combo   both delicious   also fries dirty truffle herbs parmesan which 3 different options for   However charge $2 combo even though only $1 if only fries   All food delicious though   much seating busy very quickly early  <EOR> Amazing fish chips!

Two things quite excited quick service restaurant  space nicely themed British influences inside storefront  menu fish chips some other options case you're interested something else   The last time friend shared two combos which include fries drink  +FISH CHIPS fish soft flakey perfectly crisp outside   *SHRIMP CHIPS shrimp overcooked nice contrast fried batter  There's also herbs which nice addition  I personally preferred fish chips but friend said she liked better  The chips crispy well sauces choose  Each combo comes two preferences tartar sauce southwest ranch  curry seems popular but wasn't me  Honestly combo quite lot fried food feel heavy but definitely delicious  drinks come combo give cup refill soda machines where choose varying flavors sodas teas     The space itself little weirdly designed  order all way into back restaurant which seems designed more takeaway  very little seating which front gets crowded really quickly  People also tend scout seats awkward especially since spacing between seating isn't great  While meant takeout isn't much space sit eat outside restaurant where located   All all fish chips fan food crispy tasty but layout ideal  <EOR> I wish could quote Gordon Ramsay but most them insults would applicable haha  much line when $15 16 fish chips truffle Parmesan style   fancy which glad for  simple crispy outside soft inside fish just squirt some lemon BOOM tastes amazing  much fish chips guy but simple yet complex enough where could enjoy flavors ease  Would recommend if you're looking quick meal! <EOR>
