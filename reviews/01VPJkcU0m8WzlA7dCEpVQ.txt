First off love name new boba spot  know isn't super relevant but thought ought know   Apparently only open ten days  parking much more convenient other similar spots Spring Mountain cough Tea Station cough   House Milk tea boba because when try place first time want try think them noteworthy  Although looking over menu little more most unique flavor sell probably Kumquat  next time!  When walked young man greeted enthusiastically  really appreciated that! He seemed genuinely excited business alone convinced order regular size tea instead small  Customer service everything nowadays place seems it!   The best part drink boba hot! sounds weird but first drink consisted ice cold drink hot boba  AWESOME  Obviously boba cooled sat iced drink but if any test freshness think would it  didn't ice melt any faster just fun because hadn't experience before boba tea  drink tasted stronger some other places where tried milk tea but liked more that  crushed ice front using blender which felt unique  small place but seating if want chill while    All all ended being five dollars some change which fair amount tea regular  didn't even end finishing it! cups aren't super cute sealed plastic other places but didn't mind that  excited back check more offer  <EOR> Maybe came off day but Tea Space completely empty when walked in  girl behind counter very friendly helpful when deciding type drink get    The House Green Jasmine Milk Tea top ten menu also came highly recommended Yelp decided give try  took sip didn't taste good thought maybe adding more sweetener would trick  Another sip adjustment wasn't any better but felt bad being bothersome just took I also wasn't sure fix beyond just having remade   think actually much milk tea because tasted almost water  strong tea flavor but creamy consistency either  boba good though honey flavored right amount chew    My boyfriend mango green tea better mine  However bitter aftertaste  am fan strong tea but tasted steeped long    Stars good customer service but unfortunately drinks miss visit  <EOR> Best pop corn chick found!!

When walk you'll notice place cat themed  many cute drawings wall cute plushies seats!   We order popcorn chicken medium spicy  decided lychee black tea while husband almond milk tea  ordered tea half sweet less ice since don't teas sweet  waiter warned since half sweet also means half flavor  If don't light always add it    But honestly don't think would help add sweetness because it'll just lychee drink  drink tasted really watered down barely any tea flavor  quite disappointing  husband's almond milk tea drink also tasted watered down    The popcorn chicken however pretty good  medium spicy may bit spicy people can't eat much spice  pieces pretty big    but first bite piece fat haha!  Decent place snack  probably wouldn't tea again though  Haha  <EOR> the taro tea slush wasn't tasty thought but still good don't wrong   15 min wait two those which tad bit long other space small but very comfortable work studying very kind staff <EOR> I usually don't boba Vegas but afterwards small bowl pho decided stop slightly sight tea shop  clean quality drinks similar boba tea shops SoCal  tried just milk tea sweet but sweet boba hot chewy  craving snack popcorn chicken but don't kitchen open yet which unfortunate  Would stop again  <EOR> Nice cozy boba tea house great customer service use liquid brown sugar sweetener adjust taste telling them sweet want it  also sell food fried rice fried finger foods  <EOR> My favorite boba place!
