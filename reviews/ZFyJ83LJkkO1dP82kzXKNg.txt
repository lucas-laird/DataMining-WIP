The only reason knock off star because service  Although did food timely manner seemed very unhappy  understand everyone happy job may just having bad day but being polite never hurts    <EOR> I don't think ever wrong when Raising Cane's  Each location including consistently solid quality flavor chicken tenders  Crispy breading warm soft chicken meat   I'm drooling just thinking it  Plus deliciously gooey dipping sauce still no idea probably don't ever want know because can't imagine being anything other artery clogging mixture very heavy sauces dressings unlike anything elsewhere    The fries texas toast also very tasty work well sides but nothing beats Cane's chicken tenders    Not much said regards service cleanliness  pretty much you'd expect any typical fast food restaurant  Then again don't come food served front silver platter  come pig indulge some best comfort food ever known man  <EOR> For only selling chicken fingers place good gets! gonna lie when first moved Vegas wasn't super impressed didn't understand hype but now living while honestly say LOVE them   They're heavily breaded oily sauce simply delicious! mention crazy good texas toast! yum! If you've never please go! go! go!  I've heard lot people compare chick fil a which still think kind weird since chick fil a sells things other chicken fingers but guess most fact they're both chicken places  any case Raising Cane's hands down  <EOR> Raising Kanes   staff = 5 the ladies front made day chicken tenders = 3 5 lightly battered moist meat needs more flavor texas toast = 4 5 say soft delicious hit spot fries = 3 fries fries sweet tea = 2 tastes sugar water overall don't think anything die but wouldn't oppose going if someone brought up  <EOR> My husband tried when moved into area excited looked similar Zaxby's nearby    Unfortunately wasn't much talk about  Everything basically flavorless limp  Chicken dry  sauces weren't anything brag either   The service slow particularly memorable    We haven't gone back probably won't  plethora other fast casual food establishments half mile radius  <EOR> One day n family just Vegas night sister recommended Raising Cane's fried chicken  almost closed but starving ask them if okay order meal  said okay   That's first time eat take lil time decide which best way share each other meal  Since mom only speak Chinese using Chinese conversation mom  done order  saw staff's face kinda showing he didn't want server us    While enjoying meal there's strange loud man voice yelled STUPID ASIAN! really fcking angry moment   NEVER RAISING CANE's EVER!

Chicken tenders soft inside crispy outside but without much batter oil  I loved bread!!!  Their ice tea tastes simple yet delicious! The staff friendly courteous    Only comment cleanliness  But guess because much people eat there  But gladly obliged request clean area before food served  <EOR> Good Canes location only problem its kinda victim its own success during prime meal times hard table when opens gotta grab before cleaned sit someone else's chicken crumbs grease    Here's secret Canes tho Breakfast Chicken! lot Canes including one open 9 AM figure chicken basket isn't far off chicken waffles breakfast its pretty much same thing without syrup   There's hardly anyone until 10 30 plus early day sure you're getting strips fresh fryer which them twice good    Listed hours till 1 AM every night but note dining room actually closes midnight  stay until 1 if already ordered but lock doors new orders midnight its drive thru only final hour  <EOR> Really good   Chicken juicy   Batter crisp but thick perfectly seasoned   far chicken fingers really good  <EOR> every time lunch its alway point its best chicken Vegas   <EOR> I hungry late night wanted see good around neighborhood checked Yelp came across Raising Cane's  experience Raising Cane's realize living Las  Vegas month now only discovered place just now?  Anyway the box combo seeing most popular choice guess see why  briefly sum really liked chicken fingers which amazing when Cane sauce  fries pretty good weren't overly salty greasy compared others had  Coleslaw didn't care much lastly Texas Toast nice touch meal  <EOR> Fast easy DT  associate took order time window gave food  Quick! <EOR> Simply amazing  work parking lot store located  dangerous because want constantly  Fast service open very late food always extremely fresh  Very much recommend giving try! <EOR> Not sure what's going here  going awhile everything good  Recently maybe last 3 times going instantly sick  really sick  Something right  Won't going back again  3 strikes out   can't wait chick fil a come Henderson because garbage now <EOR> After $10 taxi ride there   they aren't strip   their lobby closed!!!! should state different lobby drive through hours <EOR> I'm only upset because first spot decided stop mind since began road trip morning California   wanted extra cane sauce which payed didn't receieve  Now canes chicken no canes sauce  Wtf ___ <EOR> Raising Cane's does thing does right  chicken fingers cane's sauce can't beat  eat regular basis  staff dealt friendly service fast   location little tricky depending direction coming going but worth it     This places gets really busy during lunch hour gets loud sometimes tricky find seat  <EOR> Umm EXCUSE ME! missing LIFE! place bomb lunch break lose mind    Lol GOOD!

Anyway nothing comforts soul quite fried chicken strips carbs sweet tea  <EOR> You just finished suicide trip Vegas you're tired hungry just downright dead   Well came right place!  Raising Cane's must when you're heading Vegas  or both! only pretty large portions but food divine  chicken tenders bread coleslaw   and sauce  Everything perfectly compliments everything else plate  no item made into perfection  finish delicious greasy meal wash down some nice sweet iced tea  definitely revive your crazy Vegas trip    The thing bit trouble price sauce  give certain amount sauce per order   but once try sauce know why you'll need more  seriously drench everything sauce  But if want more they're going charge you  Unfortunate but understandable    tl dr would drive Vegas just Raising Cane's   that's good is  <EOR> WHERE Flamingo Maryland Parkway right UNLV WHY strong gut feeling may best Cane's location Las Vegas chain!

Fast food restaurant city limits nope   While chaos customers except guys work UNLV athletics behind line employees calm friendly door fast!  My small lunch comprised two chicken fingers piece Texas toast sauce  first time I'd ever seen dipping sauce menu additional price but obviously signature items zesty flavor  Texas toast also tasty but found chicken fingers kind average size flavor own without sauce   My fast food needs going forward likely satisfied other options certainly walking into particular Raising Cane's again decent chicken locked bathroom  <EOR> 5 stars fast food joint? Yes Raising Cane's actually deserves 4 stars but since involved community getting 5 stars me! support The Rebellion which UNLV student section  Since am alumni could support business giving back Alma mater especially since Cane's south particular connection university other being located across street  also give free kids meals crowd members watched mountain west basketball football game just long rebels WON  Just sure save your ticket game   When location first opened did understand hype actually thought pricey  Gave Canes second chance now love it   batter thick most chicken finger places could tell freshly made frozen  Just everyone else Texas toast because its soft buttery  Nice touch crinkle cut fries Cane's sauce which delish  also community university vibe place especially basketball game  also give 10% discount but ask student ID  <EOR> I give Raising Cane's 5 stars because food yummy service always constantly point    The box combo favorite sweet tea amazing    The sauce bomb com <EOR> Out 5 RCCF's around Las Vegas location best   staff always friendlier other ones   chicken fingers good any     Be Caniac Maniac!!! <EOR> Came lunch 7 9 15  chicken strips yummy better Chic fil a I don't eat anymore   enjoyed Texas toast fries Sweet tea perfect flavor sweetness  service quick friendly  spots when Vegas! <EOR> Confused asked extra crispy chicken twice yet chicken crispy  may wanna talk your night crew  Besides 1 incident Canes love  Canes life  <EOR> No complaints   All friendly service fresh food!! Only downfall bums hang around there     <EOR> Based other reviews am confused  Maybe fluke someting but am California grew Texas yet better chicken strips McDonalds  bland didn't much favor all   fries ok but reminded cafeteria fries   dipping sause really good but everything else just good  Plus large group teenagers being way loud annoying  <EOR> This definitely list post vegas spots before heading city  more chicken wing buffalo wing kind person but chicken tenders really good! They're moist overly battered paired sauce satisfying meal  3 finger combo comes 3 chicken tenders texas toast fries drink all under $7  fries toast delicious sides surprised many reviews gave them negative notes   but fries weren't soaked grease but crispy toast top knotch! stuffed meal but if hefty appetite might want opt larger combo  Overall fan !! <EOR> I don't know place such good rating  Came  fast snack first day town because afew hours before dinner  chicken fingers taste nasty only two sauces cane sauce basically Thousand Island dressing mix something taste nasty forgot other sauce but wasn't ranch  won't back anytime soon  <EOR> We've always greeted smile order always taken quickly brought table quickly  best food oh chicken fingers cainiac sauce amazing would hesitate eat anytime day night  <EOR> My 2nd time here  still think chick fil a 100x better  place item menu  Chicken fingers and sandwich don't feel trying   only Cane's sauce a tangy chipotle mayo mix didn't like Louisiana hot cause  fries ruffled ones soggy Texas toast isn't good all soggy well needs garlic something taste better   All all chicken pretty solid  great any means pass going forward unless am craving chicken no nuggets chick fil a around  <EOR> Simply put Cane's Chick fil A Zaxby's all other competitors look total trash   Let tell story  kind long   Long before wife moved Vegas came Chicago tourists many times  very first visit stopped Atomic Testing Museum  Afterwards looking cheap lunch couldn't back home checked original iPhone before everyone one looked nearby options   We ended In n Out Maryland over UNLV  horribly overrated  way over though drove past Raising Cane's exclaimed A restaurant devoted only chicken fingers! there  didn't back until next trip meal then changed life   After point Cane's wherever could find which often since weren't and still aren't any around Chicago  When visited Minneapolis found Cane's university closed Memorial Day   so drove suburbs it  Afterwards bought 32oz cup sauce drove back Chicago  Every time came back Vegas we'd lunch least once usually twice   As might imagine when moved nuts  haven't gotten any fatter but did Caniac Club card racked something 40 visits year  simply isn't any other fast food fresh flavorful  When want cheap delicious meal there's only option box combo double toast bbs no slaw extra sauce   And sauce indeed boss  Totally fucking boss  <EOR> One favorite spots while going UNLV!  Neither good nor bad but always reliable   usually box gallon lemonade if could would replace coleslaw another bread     It's cool when eating peers but sometimes occasional indigent would come just sit wait outside hassle   Don't wrong but help next person just let spend money first then ask some way out  <EOR> For those read last review Rio buffet knows Vegas last week   while driving around town Vegas passed noticed huge Cane's sign   sure moment back room decided look them up   realized Cane's but Raising Cane's Chicken Finger Restaurant   being curious foodie am    point check them before heading back good ol LA   My initial reaction    chicken finger restaurant?  the?  really see it   Upon arrival 10 50am 3 people getting some food front me   location right Flamingo near Maryland Pkwy which can't miss super clean! Sorry sidetrack but focus now! So interior squeaky clean me!

Solid chicken pieces freshly prepared but slightly small would liked price which minute    Crinkle fries pretty good    I don't complain much fries favorite but don't steak fries much because eating entire potato Cane sauce decent pretty much hybrid mayo based sauce mixed chili some sort   salty which great little kick it   Texas toast thick piece loaf very little garlic butter cole slaw cole slaw    nothing ordinary mediocre best   also came drink though    They southern sweet tea which pretty sweet!  LOL! The total meal came just under $9    little steep but experience very positive   Again chicken tender pieces could bigger could substituted more pieces considering paying $9 bucks but say quality chicken very good definitely visit them again near future when back Vegas   So history guy writing business plan opening chicken finger only restaurant but shot down professors countless bankers eventually worked hard day job saved enough money he dream come true    Very inspiring if ask me!  maybe review may funny others but remember long put your heart doing love work hard give eventually rewarded! <EOR> So glad introduced place   perfect spot when craving something quick don't feel splurging near Vegas strip  opted 3 finger combo includes 3 strips chicken tenders crinkled cut fries Texas toast medium drink    menu very simple consists chicken fingers chicken sandwiches selections very similar another but just different sizes  Chicken strips perfectly battered salty crispy cooked just right them freshly made  comes signature cane sauce Texas toast warm buttery good   wish location closer home then would favorite fast food! <EOR> Went location won't ever back  Rude management cashiers don't know ring someone Mother's Day promotion    unless card present    horrible    glad Chik Fil town now  <EOR> I Cane's  delicious reasonably priced quality fingers lemonade sauce toast   only bummer multiple issues order accuracy  Which surprising considering order repeatedly read back  Today's example box combo which ordered read back no slaw no fries extra extra toast   boss brought lunch into office no toast no slaw extra extra fries  isn't huge deal order very incorrect  would even less big deal if order correct  probably wouldn't wrote review  likes reviewing fast food places? Since we're though some free feedback feel could benefit Raising Cane's  fries suck take back public school cafeterias  slaw mediocre shouldn't packaged same container hot fingers fries toast  Styrofoam less mediocre isn't great hot food either  it  <EOR> Great chicken tenders service very friendly lemonade very good french fries also really good <EOR> I would love see some side options happen here   some mac n cheese sweet corn corn bread  Ya know? quite frank coleslaw sucks!
