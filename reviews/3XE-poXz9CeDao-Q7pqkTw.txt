The chosen wine pairings each course very well done nicely food   Desert warm lemon cake served some nice berries very nice lemon sorbet   perfect way end very good meal   add restaurant long list favorites MGM  <EOR> If want more food handle tasting menu Seablue way sure  know Vegas known buffets but amount food give tasting menu just crazy! mom brother came no where near finishing all food gave here!  The tasting menu around $65 per person but Vegas steal multicourse menu  start salad create yourself 10 toppings alone hard choice  Then brought some breads different types olives dips roasted pepper sauces such then series different types kabobs  lamb kabobs must even pack hint spice them which always like  brother big fan kabobs too! then if aren't full yet bring seafood paella dish big enough feed four people yet alone three people already eating ton! paella pretty tasty too  Various types shellfish but chorizo favorite part dish  kept eating more but needed able still fit into dress wearing club night stopped   eventually    And did mention wine pairings too? Yup  live Vegas! But word wise  If trying show MGM would eat way earlier think need eat somewhere else since service little slow tasting menu just takes while  high tail heels time all food wine marathon heels last thing want! <EOR> Dinner # 2 last week's vegas trip      wasn't hot space felt could eating chain restaurant   There also zero talent place   Vegas even during guy dominated convention simply inexcusable and don't forget AVNers showing around then   <EOR> Great food  Very attentive service   portions good sized also   Try lobster corn dogs   favorite part menu design your own salad   Choose ten ingredients ranging types greens fruits meats cheeses nuts etc  throw them all together you   Awesome  <EOR> The food delicious would've given Seablue 4 stars however kitchen forgot side dishes server kept forgetting refill water glasses she offered asked     A friend surf turf special which $60 per person porterhouse half lobster king crab legs   lobster tad overcooked but everything else delicious   also lobster poptart yum!  But anything puff pastry yum   The rest table oysters tuna carpaccio clam chowder fondue which salty onion rings not worth $10 fish chips burger   also ordered two sides truffled mac cheese but those never came out   kind good didn't them because surf turf special really filling  <EOR> Awesome!!!!! Great quality good drinks sexy atmosphere forces 5 star outta me! also very convenient staying MGM  Walked right Sunday evening wad seated right away  did salads drinks then fish spinach dinner  <EOR> 2 5 stars    We Seablue late lunch watch Superbowl  restaurant empty but bar area several people it  decided sit booths table    Our schedule really f'ed Vegas  woke 1pm starving time Seablue  bad wasn't very impressive  decor pretty old school blue basic    The food ordered included Lobster corn dogs  bad sound    Chicken skewer app  good flavor chicken little under done    Naan bread various dips  best part meal! bread hot fresh dips yummy!   Filet Mignon  Cooked right but meat best  Lots fat which filet mignons should have  Mashed potatoes good just basic   Hubby jasmine rice chickpeas which actually really good    Overall overpriced food great  would again  <EOR> We lame experience   server rather rude inattentive half empty restaurant   don't ask much when dine just remember take order check back when food   Hopefully server moved on   More importantly food little underwhelming   don't know maybe joint little built wife   Overall pretty standard seafood restaurant   don't think worth price  <EOR> This favorite restaurant vs  Puck's Craftsteak recent trip  Paella insanely tasty  semi unruly group service great  expensive place but seafood wasn't offended prices  <EOR> Great Service Bar but ended Food Poisoning!

Without name would noticed Seablue fine dining wonder probably not   Arcadia fits fine dining bill but doesn't exceed maybe testament fast rising expansion restaurants didn't provide enough time creativity show expect Mina's menus should give little more  <EOR> I really love food here  always wonderful  servers kind professional  am always trip Seablue  <EOR> Every September thousands rowdy hockey fans invade MGM Grand Hotel Casino take part watching beloved Stanley Cup less LA Kings kick crap Colorado Avalanche but everyone knows would safely assume yearly trip that happens fall during birthday would complete without visiting Sea Blue   Last year Lady friend took stab Chilean Sea Bass wrapped bacon    year just same  GOOD! Perfectly cooked fish flaked away ever delicately  bacon well seemed least year more infused around sea bass rather well just around it  Loved it! fish top bed white beans clams perfect compliment dish  clams    don't even really care clams  Sea Blue's clams slight seasoning them    shall say    IRRESISTIBLE!  We also decided add Alaskan crab legs sea bass I added wanted Lobster better half wanted crab legs   Let say loooooooove crab legs  much humanely possible  When SF crab legs while standing wharf frosty Heineken  When seafood crab legs  Sea Blue's crab legs   ? ish  slighty steamed come nice hot none cold BS  Now butter sauce prepare    WOW  Absolutely perfect  Though crab could stand without any sauce long eat them asap sauce DIE FOR!  The appetizers entrees dinner party got    year last year whenever    didn't care it  all sea bass + crab!  See next September Sea Blue!!! <EOR> A great place come happy hour  oysters shrimp fries all hit spot  great place stop day pool tables  <EOR> 2 words Happy Hour!

Besides lobster corn dogs other item tried salt pepper calamari which very good well   Bottom Line coming back more happy Happy Hour! <EOR> Let start off review saying huge seafood fan  doesn't always blow away when eat some seafood everyone else seems enjoying  steak potatoes guy if need anything more spoon knife fork eat food loses its charm  Despite usually order fish seafood plates when nicer restaurant hopefully train palate something because don't eat quite often enough   We restaurant when already slightly buzzed didn't give crap ate long wasn't fast food long looked good NOW!!!!  Started off couple drinks while waiting table  greeter very courteous arranged bar seating while waited sought when table ready   For appetizers arranged manila clams scallop ceviche something else couldn't remember  Now never tasted crack before but swore laced bread it  bread little oily but man oh man good even itself  Even better when dipped manila clam juice! addicted but time move main course   The naan bread delicious though wasn't quite crack  three different dips hummus feta cheese something else all them really good   I ordered Loup De Mer Spanish Sea Bass recommendation waiter really pleasant  When plates came started eating      eating  eating     just did stop  bass just delicious every bite full flavor seasoned just right slightly fatty taste when mixed juices  Wasn't dry oversaturated just right  something expected restaurant caliber suppose but no bones all  always plus someone doesn't struggle food actually food   Even before meal told neighbors plate looked delicious affirmed suspicions  ribeye if you're curious  also tried bit scallops part paella? chicken both tasted great also   It expensive but well worth it  ended charging room  very very very very few times when dine love every single aspect dining institution  decor interesting lighting bit dark but far gloomy  Service great everyone came contact every  single  food  item  was  incredible   A solid 5 stars  <EOR> I excited try place because haven't any Michael Mina restaurants before but all honesty food bit letdown   Don't wrong food good but expecting great because Mina's name attached restaurant   Overall say place nothing special  only special thing restaurant starter pita breads came 3 dipping sauces   ordered surf turf $59 expecting something great   decent filet mignon OK side lobster   waitress also didn't ask if steak cooked correctly right temperature which assumed just standard question ask high end restaurants   ordered side truffled mac cheese which good but caesar salad again nothing special   Overall good but boring meal  <EOR> I am updating because informed corn dogs made lobster fresh seafood   even bigger disappointment know don't contain fillers considering nothing tasted fresh them   would explained why tasted more bologna rather seafood  <EOR> So sea blue ditched happy hour  Use 5 30 7 1 dollar oyster jumbo shrimp decided 5 30 closing 2 dollar oyster jumbo shrimp which use regular menu price  But overall service friendly think still kinda cheap special oyster shrimp  Would come back? probably but wish still dollar deal! <EOR> This review strictly regards waitress service naan   dined restaurant birthday previously loved it   time much  fish options limited!!  The average time drink waitress 50% empty restaurant 15 mins   She seemed bothered anything table 10 when she gets guaranteed 18% tip   people table asked ranch dressing   waitress flip said ok never coming back table 15 min   But when manager came over pick waitress' slack she said but would find some her   manager above beyond everyone table deserved tip   waitress should stayed home where presume she would happier   Naan side note serve naan little hummus smear feta spread another dip   When 10 people table 2 servings naan  would think could refill   $4 refill    I pass Seablue next time head Wolfgang Bar Grill  <EOR> Overpriced   We appetizers salads drinks but wow your dollar definitely stretch far here     I guess way see if am going spend $$$$$ high end restaurant Vegas want wowed   Especially if carry Michael Mina name such   rather spend money Nobu Bouchon any day over this! <EOR> Hubby wanted really GOOD meal Vegas when there   also wanted place could walk since stayed Signature first looked all MGM restaurants   suggested CraftSteak   Even though crush Tom Collechio don't think justifies $120 per person dinner   liked varied menu Seablue more made reservation   I say moment walked service impeccable   don't know if  Michael Mina thing MGM thing but duly noted   decor ambiance Seablue really impressed well   sat against beautiful aqua wall fountain quite serene relaxing   dining room also wasn't loud which impressive   So start off bread  noted several reviews delicious flatbread three types dips hummus egg plant feta spread    Delicious   I didn't need appetizer   Also build your  own salad option which exercised baby lettuce beets fresh bufala mozz cherry tomatoes   YUM!  Neither hubby big fans oysters can't tell if good but many types choose from   We moved own version surf turf   filet hubby two pounds king crab legs split them between two us   see?  made own surf turf isn't great?  We're smart     We both two glass wine well bill $170 terrible but definitely splurge   recommend Seablue lovely dining experience   food very good service amazing away ding ding ding slot machines  <EOR> Bread butter?  Forget stuff   Instead Seablue offers naan baba gahnoush hummus feta cheese    double cream feta actually tastes would happen if butter feta kid together   For starters build your own salad where literally check off ingredients menu at least 40 items choose pencil chef accordingly   still sure if English cucumber chestnut tasted bit    well    weird sorry can't any more technical that    We then shared raw marinated fish trio which Asian Middle Eastern fusion dish   liked middle tuna fish best accompanied marinated sweet shitake mushroom slices   also raw tuna disguised falafel served slice pita bread   While looked sort porcupine made want laugh tasted unique good way especially its crunchy falafel y outer layer   For main course decided split surf turf   steak lobster both perfectly done but mindblowingly awesome   fact mashed potatoes shitake mushrooms side stole show     once didn't even mind mashed potatoes = fat + carbs   By dessert time ready cry mercy nothing menu seemed gentle enough protesting bellies   matter fact words chocolate cake dessert menu elicited gag reflex   waiter perfectly attentive entire time came rescue   He asked trust why heck still haven't tipped guy yet disappeared into kitchen   Ten minutes later he reappeared something off menu   Three pieces pear poached 3 different ways glop pear whatever sorbetto all served sugar cookie thingy   light refreshing perfect ending best meals Vegas  <EOR> Wonderful food wonderful service! husband shared scallop fritters which bacon wrapped scallops deep fried served w butter lettuce wrap lime creme fraiche  GOOD heavy!  server also ended giving free appetizer duck fat fries served w homemade ketchup baconniase   Oh gosh salivating just thinking them    AMAZING  Even naan served beginning meal delicious! LOVE naan think all restaurants should serve naan dipping sauces rather plain white sourdough bread   Entrees ahi tuna very rare European sea bass  ordered side foie gras too  Everything incredibly indulgent seafood fresh!  foie gras seared perfectly melted your mouth     Last but least ordered profiteroles dessert which mini rocky road ice cream cookie sandwiches but much more refined  Perfect ending!  We'd definitely come back again when we're Vegas! <EOR> Yay! fan     yellowtail      They BEST yellowtail EVER!

Well let fix rating = I would definitely recommend place HH if it   Otherwise if money spend   come =D  $1 oysters JUMBO shrimp amazing =d  But even better EXCEPTIONAL service   I blown away friendly attentive everyone was   scared would forgotten because friend sitting near entrance away bar crowd   But only meant good things   we waitress 2 hostesses taking care =D  Also warning   count your food people!  They're rushed might slip sometimes!  ordered dozen those yummy Willapa bay oysters only 11 came out   hostess nice enough give baker's dozen mistake = Also don't think lobster corn dogs calamari off

causes Jenny's judgment bit off =d  I must try steak next time Vegas   oh yah   and sorry 3 stars before = <EOR> Chef Mina made rotten experience Arcadia meal Seablue   Remember more casual Mina empire even though service presentation impeccable any restaurants   open kitchen fun watch large mirrors near ceiling reflecting red lamps give interior even more spacious feeling   We didn't want fill soup didn't want feel unsatisfied small portions crudo tasting trio   ordered full portions all crudo selections!  yellowtail shiitake mushrooms beet ponzu awesome tuna salmon focal point other two    also ordered plate favorite oyster Kumamoto managed clean off entrees steak lobster gent seared tuna lady    Both came very rich heavy mashed potatoes grilled broccoli rabe   lobster very fresh sweet tender   no room dessert but needed warm several cups hot chamomile tea honey   I think bill came around $300 including tip bottled water several Stella Artois'   pay much leave unhappy meal crime   Luckily Seablue put MM back good side  <EOR> Amazing! experience could better  Both times THE SHORT VERSION 5 stars service 5 stars seafood 5 stars decor 4 5 stars price 4 stars upbeat modern music being played little loud bar   If going something other fish   go craftsteak down hallway  Go early $1 oysters 1 2 price appetizers but sit bar area  finish cash back Host stand dinner table amazing service   Don't let hotel location tourists fool excellent seafood    IN DETAIL I am very price sensitive when critiquing every restaurant  always compare them apples apples review SeaBlue based against other seafood restaurants prime locations  isn't being judged against water front fish house key west  obviously supposed very expensive due location Inside MGM notoriety a Michael Mina restaurant quality ingredients flown regularly   However am rounding 5 stars 4 5  based 2 times eaten here  still think some room menu add some seafood options lower price point Chef Mina Executive Chef Stephen Hopcraft create couple entrees $25 range let see lesser quality fish  Of course sea bass great   it's sea bass but cod whitefish catfish  meal $73 tax before tip without wine appetizer   However said feel meal incredible when considering am middle desert  We both opted fish entree  Loup de Mar which Mediterranean Sea bass served over rice grapefruit garnish  date Bacon wrapped Sea Bass served butter beans steamed clams white broth can't recall  Both flaky tender perfectly crisp outer skin  loup de mar great oily taste which just melted together crisp skin perfect use salt light squeeze grapefruit    Each entree $34  Which reasonable considering above mentioned factors assorted bread basket which came pre meal baked crispy pita bread accompanied dipping trio hummus garlic red pepper guessing green pesto   However 70% time eaten fine dining strip restaurants received some sort amuse bouche during salad portion  guess now just somewhat expect when average entree tops $30 mark   Our server amazing both 20's table near group 6 40's pairing wine each course  theory each guest should treated same   I disagree  He acclimated himself each table  introducing himself server immediately started asking questions  attending show evening taking your time dinner?  familiar terms see menu if tell about? feeling he saw laid back only simple but quality pre show dinner  point he attended such  Friendly personable but brief point  took suggestion Loup de Mar which most inexpensive entree  mentioned oysters but let know used gulf oysters   rather hard selling he told return next day if wanted try them because happy hour 5 30 7 every day $1 oysters other discounted appetizers  lead second visit  no time did feel second class because weren't expense account   I back next day suggestion dozen oysters while date lobster corndogs good but gimicky would never order them except 1 2 price happy hour   truly gem find locals don't want pay $14 $20 oysters could $10 dozen elsewhere country  <EOR> Was Vegas again past weekend back Seablue   seabass again different last time but incredible   also now serve Indian naan bread hummus some spicy pine nut sauce world   Even though stuffed ended getting lemon cake desert OK    But seabass naan bread place 5 stars  <EOR> *Photos shot  As far Vegas celebrity chefs' restaurants your dollar does far Seablue  Among three soup tasting trio fried crusted appetizer trio 3 entrees bottled water the best date glass Dr  Loosen Mosel Riesling 2 iced teas bill came $200    I'm generally hard please when comes service but staff Seablue described impeccable  swooped just time replace your drinks sturdy way gently placed your glasses plates down enough feel royalty  know being picky but did say am VERY particular where service concerned   The complimentary pita dips heavenly  slightly buttery pita appetizer itself  3 dips feta yogurt clamoring more   I highly recommend tasting trios appetizers  portions measley made fantastic amuse bouche what's come  expecting shot glasses soups  Instead arrived full bowls  each favorite  overwhelming favorite white corn grilled scallop truffle  roasted garlic spinach Maine lobster cumin oil tasted really organic healthy  am only fan table   I Tagine meal Bacon wrapped Chilean Sea Bass Toasted Garlic Jus Cannellini Beans Manila Clams  OMG  freshness  best bit surprise toasted garlic  3 teeny ones enough each table  simply melts one's mouth    The sil Ahi Tuna rare  great call was  Bright pink middle tuna betrays fresh catch restaurant brags about    The husband Kurobuta Pork Chop which wonderfully seared  olive oil mashed potatoes broccolini sides done perfection too    We also best sparkling water ever sweetest smoothest Riesling   I'd remissed if don't mention did sweetened tea right Seablue  Having lived South while never could find decent sweet tea outside South  But Seablue brought tiny bottle sugar syrup sweeten tea  way handle sweet tea  your sugar packets never seem dissolve   We wish room dessert  But chef kindly gave 3 samples dessert take meringue some nutty concoction macaroon  yelpers service its prime  <EOR> The Food portions Big  Which great price your paying  when b1g1 Locals  entree good but appetizers just OK  Didn't fact pay bottle water which $8 00 large Fuji  <EOR> I great experience Seablue! thought quality freshness

Eventually decided just order dinner some kind tastings menu? remember chopped sashimi pine nuts vinegrette few other things  fantastic made mental note sure came back next time Vegas   Fast forward couple weeks ago  Back MGM Sig again date some friends  Back SeaBlue which unfortunately no longer doing tastings set  No big surely rest dinner menu would equal quality! ordered several appetizers four different ones recall  tiny a bite ish per appetizer maybe 4 plate terribly flavorful  includes mini lobster things    When dinner came some kind fish stew served over rice which mediocre best  buddy  Charlie steak looked okay wife some kind Firecracker Lobster looked pretty good?   When comes down just wasn't worth money spent far better restaurants Vegas  did nice variety oysters suppose I'd recommend chill bar some oysters beer but don't bother meals    If want sushi sashimi would recommend Social House but new location Aria  absolutely glorious when still housed Treasure Island  <EOR> We decided use 2nd free seasonal tasting dinner 2 having such great dinner American Fish   Both owned Michael Mina really good too   Again thanks teammates taking down Yelpmazing race once again thanks Misti MGM such awesome hook up!  Assuming tasting would kinda Fiamma where would set thing   the server informed didn't seasonal menu anymore   could pick any 2 tapas split Seablue salad filet mignon sea bass entrees then would figure dessert later   Sounded a ok us!!  The naan came red pepper hummus spicy hummus feta dip welcome surprise over traditional bread butter bowl   really hard tear ourselves away realizing pace ourselves if didn't want just box entrees without taking bite it     If they're letting choose tapas   OFCOURSE we're picking most expensive ones!!  prawn cocktail a la minute 5 perfect shrimp poached ocean water bed seaweed ice   poaching gave real nice tenderness prawns normally don't cocktail    Next appetizer lobster fritter   3 kinda corndoggy kaboby deep fried pieces lobster bacon upscale mayonnaise type sauce lettuce   could've eaten least 10 more   good   Really!!
