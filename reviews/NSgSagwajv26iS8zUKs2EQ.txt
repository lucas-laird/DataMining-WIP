So tried Cantina Beef Nachos Cheddar cheese chips spicy beef refried  beans jalapeños pico de gallo guacamole admit much better your typical cheap nachos  cheese plentiful while spicy beef other toppings generously peppered throughout  dish maybe quite heavy nachos might've liked would often wipe entire plate less five minutes but just can't wrong $6 99 price tag   We also tried Cantina Chicken Nachos Monterey Jack cheese chips grilled  chicken refried beans jalapeños pico de gallo guacamole quite tasty although sure well Monterey Jack cheese worked  Cheddar seems better option  The service admittedly best would take while waitress presence known which frustrating when waiting order another cheap beer but overall I'd say decent joint I'd visit quite often if lived Vegas  <EOR> I hamburger    typical Mexican dish but craving one   actually very good!  location past pool Golden Nugget atmosphere casual lade back sports bar feel   relax watch world buzz past you   Great price margs $4 00   Waitress very sweet  <EOR> Excellent place drinks! sell $19 pitchers give liter margaritas  bartender white man took care us  excellent gentleman! such amazing time  back! <EOR> Great food great service fun environment inside Golden Nugget  long wait sat waitress always step ahead  Would come back sure! <EOR> I normally don't reviews because well    just lazy     however far best food Vegas yet! husband visiting weekend Texas sooo fairly picky Mexican food   husband tacos el carbon beef enchiladas lunch both great!
