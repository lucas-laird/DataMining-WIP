This probably going fairly popular those want don unique stylish clothing   may found new place procure surprises sartorially minded men life! <EOR> I enjoyed Spicy Honey Chicken Salad lunch did some unexpected shopping before left   difficult time finding clothes fit but Frankie took lot time help me   think clothing lines nice prices comparable similar stores   experience very positive every respect  <EOR> My first impression new spot Downtown Summerlin kinda weird  cafe retail establishment? Eurostyle sandwiches Eurostyle shirts? Huh? kinda works though   We enjoy some illy coffee relax bit before appointment nearby  Cool tunes blasting rafters NCAAF big screen  ended adding crepe coffee then few beers because happy hour  Why not?  It seemed other patrons relaxing having drinks while folks shopped store  sense   Servers really friendly made feel very comfortable  <EOR> YUCK!! Bad customer service     think consumers better buying $100 t shirt treated badly   If some deep fetish where treated crap pay tons money then store YOU!! <EOR> I wouldn't shop anywhere else finely made men's clothing clothing made using most luxurious fabrics  <EOR> The service slow  nice environment roast illy coffee beans high hopes but took 30 minutes two lattes coffee probably short shot expresso  <EOR> Staff attentive store both great presentation products   also pleased find place little cafe tablet station first floor   This great store gifts general shopping definitely deserves stars customer service clothing  <EOR> I really little cafe tucked off side within Lindbergh Mens Store  perfect place plop down super comfy totally cool chair mid afternoon coffee thing  thing mean Latte Cappuccino Americano whatever!  All new shops buzz really start kick Downtown Summerlin awesome sometimes shopping delightfully exhausting  Nothing better little caffeine oasis middle urban retail mecca! Perfect recharging your batteries before heading back tooling around fabulous new outdoor mega mall! <EOR> So ordered nova lox never more disappointed nova lox bagel all life  Now usually Einstein's bagels order nova lox sandwich there  Everyone knows comes tomatoes cream cheese capers salmon sometimes request onions  nova lox came two slabs cream cheese two slabs tomatoes ripped piece salmon please refer pictures proof I don't know back making nova lox bagel takes almost 15 minutes comes came just really sad  also paid $8 95 two slabs cream cheese two slabs tomatoes ripped piece salmon  No thank never again <EOR> Wish could give place 5 stars but can't because inconsistency  Depending working may most amazing latte you've ever could foam covered coffee  food exactly same way  Customer service pretty awful too! Management really needs train waitresses decent customer service   I gave them 4 stars because great food coffee sometimes potential great if only some training  Also atmosphere pretty relaxed which down town summerlin all about  <EOR> Store looks nice   dig motorcycle  display even though its high quality doesn't match cheap manufacturing clothes    Don't shop here     Bought jacket XL rack   Fit fine   sizes run small   know since Europeans just    smaller   picked another XL off rack purchased it   Finally wore two weeks later jacket didn't fit   sewn label incorrect   Now bought clothes before   least pretty sure have   am grown adult even though wife contend large child   Never ever seen clothes   Anyway   no biggie   back tell VERY SAME salesperson sold told she KNOWS sizes VERY WELL implied jacket simply snug   idiot!

Waste time mine   took store credit   Maybe trade cigar   Writing review worth it   Yelp rules!!!  #alllivesmatter#  #EuroGap# <EOR> I am updating review Lindbergh only because Brooke Monika did everything bad experience good one   above beyond fix issue lack customer service previously received   communicated Brooke via text she very apologetic happened assured jacket would store waiting me   She also offered ten percent discount    When arrived store Monika very very sweet apologized everything   little nervous going but she made feel very comfortable     Whoever owns store should appreciate two ladies very much   true professionals jobs because them husband wearing VERY COOL jacket many more clothes your store future! <EOR> Just ordered Nova Lox Jade sorry but good Einstein Bagels if better!

Doggy friendly pretty cool hanging out  <EOR> I came across country specifically visit store  saw little sign outside said store 50% off ready shipping spree! Well     nobody greeted picking few outfits nobody available could try them on  employee entire second floor   20 min frustration walked buying nothing  sad cause nice selection clothes  <EOR> I love different place baristas always fun come talk jasmin stajae day all time <EOR> This place clothing store but cafe inside it  neat! clothing Mildly expensive but good quality  store reminds big designer store rodeo drive Los Angeles  <EOR> I luv place HH beers  food good  r dog friendly   But don't buy anything clothing store  return policy ridiculous   No refunds  Only store credit  now drink cost shirt didn't fit right  <EOR> Love love love here!! amazing rib eye lox breakfast best experience owner! love u must if meet Marco please do  love him  <EOR> Nice quiet great place dine coffee business meetings  <EOR> First all absolute worst place ever to  expect? prepared sticky hands the best cleanliness your double dose rude manager most nauseating coffee  Where start?let's talk cleaniness place oh wait isn't any considering there's leftover egg yolk counter where coffee being prepared looked left hours  Oh love feeling sticky tables   Oh let's forget best part all aside cleaniness managers just laughable completely rude she came off because said coffee does taste right  You'd think if your manager would very hospitable behavior   overall you'd think place would such great service clothing store wine bar coffee shop   I did y'all favor don't come here  shut down  Spend your money elsewhere   P S  20 year old hand me downs seem Versace cheap clothes are  <EOR> Me wife absolutely love store  shopping hard able hang cafe which completely great should try green matcha late crepes! love all staf servants care clients very polite  Highly recommended <EOR> Beautiful place quiet staff very friendly   Relly good illy coffee proper cup   Only bad ruch bill if dineing in  <EOR> This place zero sense  cafe  Downtown Summerlin since opened prime location next Apple store yet even 15 reviews Yelp years later?! I'm review 14  tell why nobody realizes there's cafe through clothing shop here   They full service menu even prime rib market price menu  don't know when could possibly serve any food because many times try use Entertainment Book coupons kitchen closed due having dedicated full time kitchen staff  If nobody cooking they're folding clothes    Because lack kitchen staff even when open most things aren't available menu  Both times eaten only crepes only specific flavors available  Because lack staff seen people try table then just walk out    Why even cafe? If separate entrance cafe actual signage cafe dedicated kitchen staff think place would busy    Having cafe inside really expensive menswear store just doesn't equate great place grab food  The crepes really good but overall place all over the place rarely open warrant more 2 stars  <EOR> My husband live LA but Sumerlin over Xmas glad found gem  delicious coca flouless cake  Its very chill vibe even better great jazz player there  <EOR> This store partners B Young mall  don't sign says no returns quality clothes no where near prices them  brought item back Rose B Young said yes should sign says no returns hmmm  employees should also say when ringing clients up  employee rang eager tell other stores however failed mention no returns  Macy's Dillard's if looking quality clothing good customer relations  place isn't place  Any store doesn't offer returns non clearance items <EOR> I love place    know constant 50% sale kind weird but prices decent just sickest jacket   look rockstar   Maybe am rockstar???    hmmmm     Its $475 50% discount because im man additional discount  Its lamb skin leather jacket  Damn looks good  just look good??
