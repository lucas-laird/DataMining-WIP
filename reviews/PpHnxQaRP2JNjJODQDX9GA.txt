Once ordered food usually comes quicker wait between waiter's first eventual second visit where took order  Orders accurate food warm enough eating food usually quickest stage restaurant experience  Waiting bill more often another lengthy process but if you're assertive just walk front counter you're more likely noticed there   Thanks IHOP making those nights just little more manageable  <EOR> I meet some friends LA earlier today    and suggested all eat  friend's boyfriend apparently demanding IHOP   couldn't more annoyed confused  But    didn't want difficult just it   Sure enough old people's home dusty dirty dingy vibe hit door  Shockingly very crowded but seated right away probably biggest booths  plus  even going started number unappetizing things saw before even ordered    can't complain when IHOP I?   Anyways   I start looking menu seeing grilled tilapia some salads chicken fried steak dishes     started thinking complete jerks actually IHOP order tilapia  reminded those times always told don't hotdog stand order sushi   knew then stop looking 30 page menu stick PANCAKES!! ordered stack pancakes raspberries white chocolate chips w cream cheese frosting two pieces crispy bacon    Definitely 'specialty stacks'   My girlfriend ordered 2X2X2    boyfriend the IHOP sympathizer ordered eggs bacon two pancakes     I very glad ordered did when all meals came    eggs literally looked hard shiny plastic mustard yellow scrambled kids' kitchen toy food  Holy schmokes those 'eggs' could literally Fear Factor    IHOP eggs really eggs' way McDonald's chicken Nuggets really 'chicken'    My food good    going demote OK reflect them while writing this  weren't terrible any means   But weren't evenly cooked   very cold now think it    am pissed didn't say something ask them heated  literally thought nothing eating cold pancakes   honest   probably wouldn't considered handing back open plate food IHOP only because many germs must floating around any given time  squeeze many people time into dining area    literally feels cafeteria packed full every portly senior citizen west strip  Back cold pancakes even white chocolate chip raspberry pancakes   and considering international house pancakes subpar    I feel all wonderful mom pop shops   Going places should cardinal sin am now prepared lose friends next time suggests IHOP delicious Saturday breakfast  Come think if any friends frequent IHOP   We're close  don't say stuck up    all     I LOVE good hole wall if food superb place authentic ran passion    But IHOP where food die where geriatrics find dates and friends   atmosphere energy restaurant honestly remind eating smoky dining hall inside hospice care center middle Nebraska  Did mention atmosphere terrible?!?!  But again did expect?? keep bringing review back fact expectations seem set unrealistically high trip IHOP  But shouldn't expectations always high when eat out?? mean keep giving IHOP any slack   Hell they're around long NONE mistakes should ever happening!!  If rating service alone place would 4 5 5 5  Only reason possible 4 5 hostess very nice didn't look clean bathed  hair pulled back messily very greasy w noticeable dandruff everywhere   clothes filthy   Stains everywhere  black    sure if should help hurt facts   Regardless aren't good things see when you're trying build appetite  And    never around trying judge if someone showered but restaurant hostess MUST look clean presentsentable    In summation Bacon which ordered crispy 2 10  White chocolate pancakes raspberries cream cheese frosting    4 10  Atmosphere 0 10  Service 9 10    The only thing learned eating against ALWAYS speak veto trip IHOP     In case anyone location cares think    give tip  #dowhateverdennysisdoing  <EOR> Great service always! great menu items  pancake fan wife loves chicken waffles! <EOR> This far worst IHOP ever!!!
