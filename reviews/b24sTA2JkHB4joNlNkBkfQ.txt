Ate before heading club definitely good choice soak all alcohol carbs! ordered grilled chicken panini shared half gf ordered mozzarella basil panini  Both good came big portions! substituted french fries side assorted fruits  Tab came $12+ no complaints paninis but fruit salad sour tasted soggy    But overall service alright took them 10 minutes more cook food  Would come back? Probably if stayed Venetian needed fast food decent quality  just glad food court didn't your typical McDonald's Burger King crud  = <EOR> Food terrible bland  staff just wants money without delivering quality product  Potatoes dry don't offer butter your toast doesn't offer butter toast ? highly recommend patronizing place if want FOOD    <EOR> This spot really good! down strip trying different spots far burgers around top spots  Its $10 burger fries which pretty good since even Wendy's $10 strip  put thousand island burgers which tastes pretty good  Its located Venetian Food Court  place because fresh burger don't sit down burger joint it  saving $15 tax tip extra $15 craps table! <EOR> Warning Food Poisoning Here  My wife stopped late night burger fries  took order ate back hotel room  fries very soggy burger average best  happened next morning though painful certainly worth late night meal    You've warned  <EOR> YUM!

Everytime we're Vegas husband must eat here  usually split Chicken Caesar Mozzarella Panini  heavenly!!! Everything taste fresh! bread perfect crunch outside soft texture inside  chicken always moist  mozzarella compliments whole sandwich  top all deliciousness off fries BEST DANG FRIES EVER!   You disappointed  few REALLY GOOD places eat Vegas  <EOR> Very long wait  Food never came   Manager shift June 22 2013 around 11 pm said he lost order   asked refund didn't even comp water say sorry   He blamed whole ordeal  manager night wasn't wearing name badge wouldn't give name  customer service royally sucks  ZERO STARS  <EOR> This place always pricey but food solid!  Last trip Vegas stopped chicken sandwich   When order chicken half size bun tough   Gave second shot next day thinking might only time thing but wasn't!!  If pay 13 bucks chicken breast sandwich chicken should bigger chicken strip  <EOR> They forgot cheese breakfast sandwich  repeat order 3 times once first lady counter then again register then asked again if asked sausage bacon  organization terrible  Also ordered coffee walk all way around back where first ordered cream sugar and silverware   Pretty disappointing Venetian standards  Never again  <EOR> Good late night breakfast  little pricey but vegas  Perfect post club food  <EOR> Avoid salmon patty sandwich unless lead stomach  hubby ate first night sick entire stay food poisoning  wanting believe came place ate same thing 2 nights later since killer french fries but paid next morning  pretty much ruin whole vacation  <EOR> We way Venetian heading Earl's Chipotle but decided stop eat since wouldn't way  service fine cashier nice  bf ordered Philly Cheesesteak Chicken Caesar Panini both cheese fries  only drink bottle water total came $33  could much better meal much cheaper elsewhere even inside Venetian  rosemary bread panini thick pungent  overpowered thin slices chicken  Nice pieces grilled chicken would much preferred 2 pale bland slices received  lettuce wilted think mayo bread  Why need mayo when already Caesar dressing? fries little soggy but cheese sauce good  Cheesesteak wasn't bad but definitely worth price  If you're looking cheap meal skip place better value elsewhere  <EOR> Below average option Venetian food court bunch sandwiches   Had Philly Cheese Steak salad instead fries $14    The food OK but expected more flavor better quality  did fill between all Vegas madness no long waits many restaurants  <EOR> I only ate last resort  needed something belly before gorging myself all sorts alcohol   For $13 Cheeseburger would think could afford add more flavor patty  But alas nothing spectacular meal just your average cheeseburger  Fries also bit soggy all grease   The Chicken Tenders surprisingly good though  nicely breaded dry all  crispy bread shell broke apart reveal hot moist white chicken breast meat inside    After quick meal stomach full bread meat grease ready start binge drinking  Let bottle poppin begin! <EOR> The food below average prices  ordered chicken strips fries feel way short impressive  just looking quick casual lunch eat myself while waiting some friends    The chicken strips came $14 4 strips fries  should just gotten burger Love Burgers upstairs  really disappointed chicken strips felt way jipped because barely chicken strips looked more thick chicken fries!! would better if actual strips! 4 chicken strips probably equated NORMAL sized strip! if paid $5 then wouldn't upset but $14 worth it!   When friend arrived she chicken strips food court upstairs shopping    half price more food tasted better! If can't simple chicken strips correct don't want try anything else! <EOR> Within Venetian cheaper spots  But certainly some better values strip   San Gennaro always serves purpose because totally dig philly cheesesteaks chicken tenders here  drink comes $15 but steak sandwich super juicy always hits spot when trying sober trying pad stomach upcoming night mayhem   The chicken tenders hand battered actually give very generous sized portion protein  Chicken tenders favorite cheat meal when am dieting eat them alot ones favorite   The thing skip breakfast  seriously $10 generic plate reheated stuff  better then Venetian! bisuits gravy sausage reminded free stuff complimentary breakfast holiday inn!  Really 3 1 2 but stay Venetian alot love philly cheesesteak sandwiches gets round 4! <EOR> Located Venetian food court        grab quick bite before hitting Club Tao needed some stomach filler prepare alcohol pounding occur Tao       nothing much say place    just plain sucks ass    ate $12 burger but think $6 Carl's Jr  burger takes out        Stay away place try Italian deli next door  <EOR> San Gennaro Grill probably last places you'd expect burger Strip much less late night   just stumbled upon place because late night craving burger Venetian time needed something absorb big pomegranite martini earlier   Venetian food court open really late   little turned off cost $11 50 mushroom swiss burger but expect anything Strip   burger surprisingly good though satisfied craving night   Thinking fluke night came back again next night ordered same thing   still good just good some upscale burger joints strip   Would back again?  Maybe only if Venetian don't feel going Grand Lux Cafe late night  <EOR> My husband authentic Philly cheesesteak said alright  fries little over cooked but mozzarella sweet basil Italian ham very good although second time unbalanced far cooking goes  Very expensive sandwich  but convenient Venetian strip  pretty good 12 00 meal without drink  <EOR> This place over priced mediocre food  Granted strip expected  fries pretty tasty until cold  burgers tiny patties big bun  place wouldn't stand chance located anywhere else  opinion keep walking  <EOR> I must admit having tried cheesesteak sandwich Philadelphia pretty good  place doesn't look much because just another food court location but really your value's worth  chicken cheesesteak which came generous portion mushrooms chicken onions Swiss cheese  only but size sandwich enough two people  If hungry budget because spent your last hundred craps then head over something fill your stomach your near empty wallet  <EOR> What? Compared Carl's Jr? Nooooo  place awesome     Anyway eat when can  pricey burger but when steak burger melts your mouth such heavenly way forget forked over 12 bucks it  well then see your credit card bill freak out but place great  fries aren't greasy either  should probably order other items but burger itsself keeps coming back more  <EOR> One thing Venetian food court sure looks part   San Gennaro Grill Venetian's food courts  cafe pizza stop gelato San Gennaro Grill   choice simple nothing red meat pork   ended Chicken Philly Cheese Steak   Even though Steak name meal isn't any steak   meal came fries $12   fries  okay but wouldn't know because killed it   chicken philly totally hit spot   Melted cheese mushrooms green peppers covered chicken   thought also seasoned well   only issue green peppers  love green peppers but should requested them side since much over powered taste chicken mushrooms     The food does take little time take little time cook it   When first arrived all saw bunch people sitting tables doing nothing  originally thought just taking valuable space people actually eating use  Then realized just waiting food just me   Yes salad even take over 10 minutes here   Know coming in   pizza next door might faster   But food pretty good wait worth it  <EOR> Fries extremely greasy soggy! chicken panini bit bland but prefer bland food opposed saucy foods knock off star if prefer stronger taste!   bit pricey employees don't look happy but helpful  $3 45 small fountain soda still pretty pricey but fortunately hardly drink soda  menu also quite small  only ate half panini kept leftovers late night munchies  didn't work well since disgusted sight leftovers later night tossed it  usually pretty good devouring leftovers but definitely wasn't worth it   Definitely pass because pricey mediocre food  However great location close Venezia Tower where stayed wasn't disgusted extremely unhappy food  Thank god didn't eat while intoxicated oily food alchies don't mix well stomach! <EOR> Huge panini but mostly bread did lot chicken   ok kind greasy   fries decent   Its made order came relatively quickly  14 bucks huge but mostly bread panini fries great bargain but could worse cost flavor elsewhere  <EOR> Late night err umm more early morning eating  Around 3 am  much dining choices ate before but first time eating breakfast  Ordered pancakes then added whipped cream strawberries then side bacon course something drink          $16 later     beware adds fast!  Gotta admit though damn good pancakes even without whipped cream strawberries  Bacon tasty too  <EOR> Reasonably priced Las Vegas resort   fries good  <EOR> I ordered chicken Philly cheese steak came works but lacking taste   am still trying figure could made sandwich better   fries hand cut plus some people but me  I prefer Steak Fries    Everything made fresh order potential being great spot Venetian hotel but just wasn't impressed overpriced sandwich no salt fries  <EOR> So before crazy crunk suite need some grub fuel    With BF shared salmon sandwich proscuitto mozzarella basil panini  Both come fries    The salmon salmon burger patty lettuce tomato honey mustard  Pretty good moist  proscuitto foccacia bread wasn't much pressed toasted all together but alright sandwich  Fries okay   a bit salted much  Some theirs cheese fries which constituted cheese sauce shredded cheese top     employees special half price  half bad all  mean its nothing fantastic but good heavy sandwiches  If you're looking quick sandwich isn't bad option $12 around all big hitters but personally full price I'd upgrade $19 Bouchon Monte Cristo knocks socks  <EOR> We came long morning if walking around strip  hot tired just wanted sandwich keep good until dinner    The sandwiches pretty good   good size filling   would come back these  <EOR> It so  horrible but definitely great  ordered mozzarella tomato basil panini  tomatoes pink mealy  Seems if you're going sandwich where main ingredient tomato should sure quality vine ripened produce  Fries decent  guess good thing sandwich fries would enough food split between 2 people cheap meal Vegas standards  Personally would next door slice pizza pizzeria  <EOR> This good place catch snack night gambling drinking  <EOR> We ate quick meal non buffet restaurant  selection food various places pretty good but seemed little expensive but Vegas  ate burger place paid $11 bucks burger  seemed little pricey but burger cooked specification bread tasted felt home made  fries cooked well done which also completed without hitch  You'd surprised many places won't cook your fries crispy even if ask it   Other then prices food pretty good  quite 4 stars but worth stop if mood something fast tasty good casino  <EOR> $10 76 panini little expensive if may say   I expecting sandwich blow taste buds price The wait receive sandwich pretty long   figured since prepping order ideal them take while yet long does take grill some vegetables pressed them inside sandwich cheese? wait 10 minutes + price $10 76 + flavor tart due improper preparation cooking eggplant + seasoning bland + no spread dry = = did equate price value purchased for  recommend heading over another location grab some grub  If you're going spend around $10 might well restaurant head over Earl Sandwiches if truly mood some delicious sandwiches  <EOR> Went breakfast  Food tasted fresh although most sat warming trays  cheese omelet made fresh when ordered though  Two express breakfasts two OJ's cost $27  If you're looking something light tasty quick stop Venetian food court right off casino floor  <EOR> Excellent Panini better chicken parmagiana sanwiches  Melted just right incredible fries too  Possibly best meal 5 days Vegas   It's part 1st floor food court area Venetian little spendy food court food would $30 two w o ACG coupon but <EOR>
