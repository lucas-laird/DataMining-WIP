Delicious food highly recommended! waitress Valintine very friendly helpful! <EOR> This first ayce conveyer belt sushi Las Vegas  did disappoint me! only concern place fish rice ratio  much rice taste  However did stop friends eating 100 plates  really mean all eat  Furthermore entrees pretty good  garlic shrimp korean ribs which loved!   They promotion time ate meal pretty affordable $16  also included dessert! Korean ice cream sandwich basically tasted ice cream cone! <EOR> Another revolving sushi? Yes! They're limited menu but food delicious  things place usual la carte but also ayce  husband opted ayce    only because eat some food!! Another great thing place crab menu which also available ayce   Korean ribs yes heard correctly    Korean ribs! food delicious customer service outstanding  felt waitress ours alone  She made sure never drinks checked constantly  <EOR> We keep coming restaurant because delicious food great service Jay Valentine very nice servers!! favorite place now <EOR> This place just ok  decided try saw advertisement fb new revolving type sushi place grand opening specials awesome AYCE  really idea having both revolving sushi AYCE unlike Sapporo   However sushi kind boring  lunch maybe  why? But did roll can't stop thinking about  can't remember name but lemon salmon top  good  far service staff friendly but only asked once if wanted anything off menu  Water filled few times which great  also ordered green tea ice cream but never it  misunderstood waiter when he asked thought he asked if ordered   said yes  But he really actually asked if because he brought check right that  But no big deal didn't need ice cream  Just weird he forgot quickly bring ordered it  never place added gratuity automatically into bill just 2 people  so didn't feel needed leave cash tip too  Also atmosphere very boring place small  Would back? If price stayed grand opening prices yes  would encourage someone reading reviews just try yourself then judge did! <EOR> All eat sushi conveyor belt  during soft opening week actually impressed seated quickly  order some hot foods staff member grab your sushi off conveyor belt  hot foods came little train  15 month old entertained every time came by  Overall fun experience  <EOR> My husband found them Facebook  style sushi place before just Vegas  First off daughter vegetarian wouldn't allow ala cart AYCE  Which understand reasoning but come she's 10 yr old vegetarian  would totally board if she adult but child! She ate 3 things  She didn't even eat enough justify price AYCE  Sushi quality ok best but definitely nothing near worst  place very clean staff friendly  Efficiency staff ok  did ask couple items twice weren't busy but everyone off days there    Where TOTALLY lost food issue daughter but solely because bill  menu says 18% gratuity automatically added parties 6 more  Well just 3 still added bill  really can't stand when restaurants sneaky shit that  only imagine many people don't notice still leave extra tip  respect business more when least front but knowledge saw no postings stating regardless party size automatically add gratuity  reason alone probably never return nor recommend place  <EOR> Good place    I sushi crab  Service very nice fast   Belt sushi place good experience coming back again  <EOR> Best lettuce wraps sushi really good tell made every morning service really good new restaurant staff really good trained love food recommend 100 % <EOR> We great time  Sushi fresh great!

Took forever seated when finally ordered portions way small quality unimpressive    definitely returning!!! <EOR> New conveyor belt sushi delivery system eat all can  Place new nice airy doesn't feel claustrophobic  Typical sushi place conveyor belt     difference between other eat all places place limited sushi  no tobico masago Ikura which some favorites  No uni sweet shrimp either  Although 2 beef sushi dishes  kalbi miss roe side sushi uni sweet shrimp  fish slices kind small  come back just see if there's improvement  Pricing similar those other places    <EOR> Didn't pay attention reviews freshness ended extremely disappointed it  Picked couple things belt looked ok but everything tasted subpar extremely dry  Plates indeed 'oily' dirty other people mentioned  Most items color should been belt far longer should very fresh initially  Tuna gray white part octopus turning brown even beef appetizer strange purplish color  Only picked maybe 3 plates before couldn't find anything looked appetizing anymore  Didn't eat remotely enough cost  never disappointed sushi  actually over other conveyor belt sushi place Sapporo afterward just 'cleanse palates' few plates amazing delicious sushi  If want experience conveyor belt sushi Sapporo   you're completely different experience  coming back already hoping don't end sick  only time tell  <EOR> LOVE place  came lunch family during grand opening special  Instead paying $21 per person lunch pricing paid $15 +18% gratuity    Service great  food quality excellent! lot place sushi doesn't come humongous rice full most AYCE places  All raw fish today really fresh yellowtail just delicious    To surprise also lot tasty appetizers entrees included price Korean short ribs kimchi fried rice garlic fried wings fried shrimp sew mai oysters amazing fried prawns must try     The conveyor belt fun concept usual but coolest part little machine delivers food right your table top conveyor belt first time seeing really exciting dining experience me  looks little sushi express train rolling kitchen!   For dessert Melona bars other fun Korean ice creams  Don't forget grab stamp card end your meal loyalty program free meal 10 lunch dinner purchases    I also learned conveyor belt etiquette means reach food other side just case anyone else didn't know    sorry being fat just clueless hungry  back <EOR> Waited over hour wait when seated barely any food rotating quality ok  Would rather regular AYCE without niche revolving sushi doing absolutely nothing taste buds  <EOR> Sushi good! don't very many sushi roll options though  specialty items worth if wanna try everything   But think opt regular AYCE menu instead  service might bit much   great didn't wait anything but having servers check every 50 seconds bit bothersome  <EOR> This excellent place take your family  We'll coming back soon! staff friendly manager accommodating  food awesome  <EOR> Can't believe waited long try place!

Ponzu ponzu seems added sugar  main course fish poor quality fresh yuck since ayce conveyor didn't provide menu just watch fish swim through conveyor hoping find good slice konbea but sorry  wont back matter keeping conveyor sushi where its finest yes Hawaii Japan  <EOR> I'm 100% sure but think 6 types nigiri 6 different rolls  Compare dozens most ayce places conveyor belt just becomes gimmick doesn't work  boring  Service fine food ok  Nothing special  need work desperately variety what's conveyor belt  Otherwise just worth money when many other place much more variety  <EOR> To fair AYCE sushi thing town anymore since would rather pay more quality quantity   rare occasion try Konbea during soft opening week   Soft opening week meant $20 95 dinner     Their first issue having host hostess dedicated filling empty seats keeping wait guests minimum   When walked Sunday evening told first employee saw party 2  He brought register desk pointed sign in sheet   rather confusing because could plainly see plenty seats along sushi bar versus 6 booths lots people waiting   added name list proceeded wait   very apparent many other customers waiting irritated long wait when seats available   asked numerous times if could sit empty seats told Just second   Give moment  etc  final attempt waiter explained he only allowed sit customers section   made lot sense understood completely why disorganized   asked which staff member charge seats inquired he pointed me  asked if could sit down two empty seats that empty good while also told next list well   She agreed   solved waiting issue     The waitress came take drink orders explain little menu   Overall sushi okay nothing special spectacular it   standard sushi rolls   rice fish ratio okay too   exceptionally bad piece sushi uni   really awful tasted ammonia   truly horrific would probably cause if toilet later  The oyster half shell could also culprit well just bit milky eaten raw   squid also bit chewy end swallowing whole since doesn't break down  also never received Time Blue Fin Tuna order   Okay few negative points   For any hot appetizers need order directly wait staff   little robot thing bring down your seat above revolving belt   Husband really enjoyed salt pepper chicken wings though quite hot when saw them coming down belt     Our waitress great refilling water never ask   along clean staff pretty quick clearing empty dishes  never issue    The dessert menu indicated items Time written next each assumed meant allowed each kind dessert total   disappointed when tried order second dessert told could not  needs clear menu dessert only   They also add 18% gratuity because promotion but tell upfront   discover when bill   Again things need clear customer   Suggestions owners Hire dedicated host hostess greeting customers ensuring parties seated quickly efficiently  only 6 booths noticed least three families needed high chairs seated bar seats   heard staff member ask each party if bar seat okay all agree only because waiting long   struggle each families while attempted eat   parties could easily seated booth always available around same time seated  Example party four seated booth right section right before party 4 plus high chair seated bar interior left section  wait staff being only responsible sections cannot oversee accommodate parties more efficient  host hostess do   I initially going give place three star but writing review move down 2   Even if fix host hostess situation questionable sushi returning                   Regular prices $25 99 pp Children 3 7 Half price Children 3 under share additional $3 <EOR> Man   As grand opening wish sign said all eat   Because although server must've said it  lady more focused food place did look fresh  good   I tried salmon sashimi rice hard  try piece before asked kind all eat wanted  didn't want that  told we'd just pay leave   It took awhile approved just pay 2 plates leave   If food good ok   But wasn't   I'm sorry  high hopes another revolving sushi place  Back Sapporo!

Creamy sweet artificially flavored yet enjoyable lol   am looking buy box next time am right store!  Red Bean Cake good but trust melon bar   yum!  The conveyor belt itself loses its mesmerizing effect shortly into dinner however clearly see lack variety bit boring set safe choices made staff pacify hungry mob   No sushi dressed any soy wasabi yuzu ponzu like   imagine less adventurous eaters taking dislike aforementioned but handicaps sushi being elevated   Also inconsistent fish cuts found throughout most likely due less experienced sushi chefs   Most cuts good but some textures very unappealing   something haven't experienced quite some time   And lastly crab bit disappointing   Good flavor crab but temperature luke warm meat overcooked   Most likely cooked once then reheated order   Still bad way spend $6 just best reason visit   also found chore eat along sushi   had clean hands multiple times during meal   Have fun! <EOR> I 5 friends around dinner time seated right away  new lot but really excited it! server made sure all understood menu answered all questions  no time confused hungry! started pulling food off belt didn't stop 30 minutes! times where waiting your favorite sushi come back around few minutes but something new would catch your eyes right your stomach  time your favorite came back around stuffed lol  end all wonder many rolls you've had  no keeping count  Servers always around collecting dirty plates refilling drinks  Everyone super nice  No complaints!

I back time bringing gf  <EOR> Visited once return again  restaurant crew very rude family I  service left awe  took forever bring water let alone order  cleanliness restaurant definitely worst  bathrooms barely cleaned tables leftover crumbs stains previous customers  serving sizes did satisfy appetite even help little  place left family hungry unhappy  <EOR> Sitting convert belt grabbing sushi right off felt weird first  point hoped doing right lol Overall food good but couldn't fast enough   However bill charge already gratuity 18% just friend eating  just caution others sure read bill before paying  <EOR> All eat conveyor belt sushi? Brand new place? crab?

FOURTY FIVE MINUTES?!  Don't rush when paying customer  Not I'd want stay longer 45 minutes place experience  I enjoy meal especially if first time  Thank you    The Fried Rice taste frozen TV dinner   The Dungeness Crab tasted cooked days just waiting someone eat it  meat really stuck shell hard eat   Sushi There's lot options looked good me   The prices aren't worth me    A Y C E  PRICES Lunch $21 95 Dinner 25 99 Upgrade $6 Dungeness Crab Not worth it The only thing good ice cream  Wanna know why? Because didn't it! just store freezer! <EOR> My family soft opening very busy hope bodes well new restaurant   The prices par other AYCE sushi places   $21 95 lunch $25 95 dinner   add $6 AYCE dungeness crab   didn't see stamp card offer   Items come conveyor belt if piggy family mine you'll want seat right restaurant first pick items  Entrees well sushi all conveyor belt   Rolls come 4 peices nigiri 2  Entrees really just hot items come kitchen   serving sizes rather small most other AYCE places call appetizers   But tasty   tried Shrimp fried rice tasty but something I'd normally AYCE place   But dad prefers cooked stuff Pot stickers very good meat fillind Lettuce wrap primarily mushrooms but really tasty   Just wish weren't much fried shrimp cracker type stuff inside Dungeness crab black bean sauce favorite two crab preparations but some over cooked hard meat out Dungeness crab salt pepper jalapenos bit salty Prawns really good though little over cooked Kalbi nice flavor but little tough garlic beef very tough  They few items order only  Blue fin tuna stock fatty tuna perfect! ama ebi really good but no heads  tobiko wasabi tobiko which quite kick red tobiko which prefered oysters very plump well cleaned  I don't think anything tried didn't like   Servers friendly efficient especially such crazy crowd   Only downsides think bathrooms singles lot parking lot tables seats big parties problems here  <EOR> I came celebrate birthday family  mom big eaters first worry might end last time Sapporo 2 people ended $100 still HUNGRY  But time please Konbea offers AYCE only $21  much which totally worth price  Loved large selections  2 young ladies servers very nice keep checking very often sure want   We definitely come back next month! <EOR> Conveyor belt sushi? AYCE? Sounds combination but fell extremely short   The sushi itself subpar  conveyor belt idea great interesting however when seated barely any plates belt  took them good 10 minutes everything set even then wasn't great  conveyor belt sushi including rolls nigri condensation top lids meaning fish heated  sushi itself room temperature warm didn't taste fresh which then followed bland texture unsatisfying aftertaste   rolls upon rolls barely any nigiri  isn't option specifically order plate    As grand opening two months straight you'd assume prices would fair  5 dollars off original price lunch roughly $17 dinner roughly $20 sounds great deal however real annoying part charge gratuity 18%   No mentioned gratuity grand opening included 2 people $52 dinner time   staff nor store owner mentioned this  Even menu states only parties 6+ people charged this    They wanted charge extra which regular price some extra food did enjoy  grand opening 6 weeks charge extra disrespectful  If want good customer loyalty communicate them price  business good business practice comes fact acknowledge customer rather hiding when check comes    As new business attempting establish itself lot potential  Customer service okay best place clean seated quickly  But came food  food bland followed extra charge?   No  Don't disrespect your customers  If want revolving sushi  Sapporo  <EOR> Great service sushi fresh would def recomend friends try place  Desserts good especially green tea ice cream  <EOR> A lot variety food sushi service very attentive! grab all crab stick want! <EOR> We absolutely LOVED place!
