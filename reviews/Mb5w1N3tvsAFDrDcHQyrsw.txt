Other then food staff friendly food quickly  just need educated cook prepare food better  Fill subs more items consistently same every time sure your fries crispy  <EOR> I always order buffalo chicken philly know traditional philly steak but favorite! kind reminds subway where add your own toppings there's isn't many  lettuce tomato banana peppers jalapeños mayo pickles options add  lettuce jalapeños pickles   The meat choose cooked right front very hot same French fries  fries all seasoning add them yourself highly recommend because don't think put salt fries all seasoning doesn't over it  usually lemonade well but very sweet if mall eat first carry around otherwise just fountain drink   This place probably your best option eat mall but would't just eat if wasn't mall lol  why gave 4 stars  <EOR> I really liked place  food good strawberry lemonade even better  sweet put real strawberries bottom  <EOR> always good order peppers tomato grill  <EOR> Expensive give u water shits service ok but never place   <EOR> I don't come Charley's very often but enjoy subs since mall shopping decided come lunch  mall just opened many people eating yet didn't wait put order  ordered medium Bacon 3 cheese steak sub meal upgraded fries cheese bacon gourmet fries  Paid around $12  good amount food but location seems really skimpy food portions  Very thin slices meat but plenty fill ins lettuce  fries weren't good all  fries soggy hardly any cheese bacon them  Paid $2 extra wasn't worth it! taste sub pretty good tho  Don't expect anything gourmet but if want something quick simple might place come to  <EOR> Hmmm     Mall food court always cheesesteak place  stopped Cheese Fries   son cheese fries bacon he ate them all   just Cheese Fries  added salt but still very little flavor   size very small paid  Blueberry Lemonade good but made kind Blueberry compote  thick sludgy almost over poked boba  grandson shared every time he blueberry he gagged   Chicken Finger kids meal  fingers over cooked dry tasted vaguely freezer burn  finger meal comes NO dipping sauce  asked ranch said its extra but then gave free   won't going back  Meh best  <EOR> Visited place May 27th Derrick provided excellent customer service need people restore faith  fast food environment thank Derrick see when come back <EOR> We decided eat Charley'due fantastic smell! However product did equal advertising  Plenty bread hardly any meat  All slathered mayo  When tried talk employee soon said unhappy he said nice day turned back me  <EOR> 2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 62 100  My tip Dec 10 2016 Watch them cook your food place plate  During visit girl serving food put piece meat fell counter into sandwich  Reviewer 20 days ago saw them cook plastic w meat didn't remove till customer stated it  Doubt eat again    I Meadows Mall last Saturday looking place eat caught eye  Philly cheese steaks!   Looking menu Philly cheese steak everything upgraded Ultimate Fries  ordered when noticed review customer seeing them cook piece plastic cheese steak didn't remove till customer stated it  watched them hawk while cooked food    The cheese steak fries okay definitely tasted chain fast food quality  I'd rather Pop's down street  Service great just quality cooking food safety standards worry me    If keep eye them while cook food place would eat again  Please train employees cook food difficult  <EOR> I philly steak sandwich sucks big time tried chili cheese fries noon time chili  If want very good philly cheese sandwich down street Decatur Alta because POPS philly steaks 1000 times better then place any day week  <EOR> Manager took order customer service exactly should expect manager!! He super friendly seemed happy help even explained whole menu when told hadn't before    Now why 5 stars? Well    portion meat sandwich left something desired especially when meal comes $11 change don't give trays unless there's table available close juggling act carry everything  Other food fresh tasted good  <EOR>
