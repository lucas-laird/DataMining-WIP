Don't wrong love WingStop   Back when lived Texas everywhere   don't love online ordering system location   Less month ago placed order pick off work   pick right time   and wait   35 minutes   What's point ordering online ahead time?  Fast forward today when placed order pick during lunch break   arrive tell them ordered online gave them name    response? only online order open did order under name Caroline? show them e mail proving ordered pick location   the cashier just kind stared offering nothing but 20 minute wait time fry batch wings     TL DR Don't order online they'll screw all up  <EOR> We absolutely love place! Food consistently good service always par   One time waited around hour order  brought receipt ask if something wrong staff very apologetic gave order free  Some sort technical issue   Much better Buffalo Wild wings  great value your money <EOR> Maybe should little bit common sense when dealing great customers  False accusations fast way lose business  <EOR> Have only Wing Stop time not location but pleasantly surprised  $8 99 meal good value   6 wings basket fries 20 oz drink  Even better pick two different flavors! Louisiana Rub REALLY good  would definitely order again  also tried new Spicy Korean  good too  Reminiscent Asian Zing other wing place shall remain nameless  Only complaint took 25 wings  Wouldn't again lunch time but definitely return  <EOR> What say place   ?

Kind funny thought  give them few months work kinks hopefully food comes better  sure order wings since wings always better boneless anyway  plus side service good other Yelpers mentioned  <EOR> The lemon pepper wings favorite  location set really good watch sports game  still think very over priced fires little soggy   The soda machine best machine ever! <EOR> This location larger then most service better too  10 TVs bar  Good spot watch Monday night football  <EOR> Delivery nightmare!!!! Wingstop definitely preferred over B Dubs Hooters book but location some issues! ordered lunch office 8 using delivery service  Little did know delivery through nightmare Uber eats! entire order supposed arrive 12 15  Two orders arrived 12 20 little no labels  follow call placed 12 30 only 2 orders delivered no details 2! employee appeared shocked said would follow Uber driver  several fails latest update due busy line placed hold finally 1 o'clock  state they're remaking food no detail what's missing!! estimate arrival asked employee? shouts long then replies 8 minutes 15 minutes later remainder order arrived again little no labels  remainder order given delivery driver driver brought back! way ton room improvement delivery service  suggest better channel communication starters considering your outsourcing  Also don't lie say your remaking when don't know delivered! Food just sat somewhere over hour  Ridiculous!!!! <EOR> Yes Wing Stop lunch   Yes am reviewing place    Located near UNLV same parking lot Seafood City Wing Stop those places where they're known just wings sports bar type feel   lunch because wanted something quick didn't want drive far Seafood City needed some protein  There's protein chicken right?  ended sharing 12 pieces boneless Garlic Parmesan chicken   Taste wise okay realizing should opted plain boneless chicken   Service wasn't bad but food did take little longer expected   restaurant spacious enough TV's playing ESPN   biggest issue immediate turn off smell mop water upon walking in   clean towel wipe down tables would nice just saying  <EOR> As fan wings fries place pretty good spot eat at  definitely better wings but also worse  Nothing really great different food would stick compared other places but still it  Very close house located same parking lot Seafood City Supermarket    Pros 1  Customer Service great every time there  2  Clean tables  3  Drink station always filled  whenever gotten drink  4  Food came timely matter   Cons 1  Several times location ladies room dirty stocked toilet paper     I always traditional wings fries  fries really good  Wings time seem small hardly no meat them  big fan season flavor wings  cooked them then just threw flavor end  wings cooked flavor  Also wings super greasy especially Parmesan ones    Not big fan sports but place lots TVs sports playing all time all fans there  also bar which never used  Actually never any beer wing place!! Overall pretty good place! <EOR> This place isn't great  Gotten wings twice reached conclusion   The establishment itself nice enough  Seems big  touts itself being place watch sports but doesn't seem enough TVs space really that  cashiers always nice enough  place nice enough   The wings  place called wingstop really don't many flavors wings  8  even hard pick wasn't great 8  if fan dry rub am guess luck  Your choices drop down 4    The flavors left lot desires  Garlic Parmesan would think would nice cheese garlic rub   but really just slathered sauce sprinkled Parmesan cheese  just seemed weird  could buy container Parmesan cheese sprinkle them wet wings  Original hot barely spice wings dry  Hickory Smoked BBQ slathered BBQ but then much  BBQ bland again wings dry  Hawaiian though decent nice pineapple flavor being overpowering  Side note Spicy Chipotle sauce worth dipping sauce  Feels more cheese dip anything else    The wings just sub par debate between bone in boneless but place where boneless definitely way go  more meat meat juicier  Usually boneless wings bigger anyway but most places bone wings juicier taste better  place just doesn't that   Fries also very dry apparently sugar sprinkled over fries  Pretty much everything dry  Might need spritz some water everything could use moisture   I would suggest B Dubs if wanted wings skip place  <EOR> I haven't Wingstop years   decided try lunch combo which 5 boneless wings side drink   bad $5 99   The wings however soaked grease very salty   little pool oil bottom basket   Funny thing wings dry if never coated oily mess   Also side fried corn wasn't greatest thing   overcooked again oily salty  <EOR> I just recently found place am happy finally gave Wingstop try   prices reasonable portions big   even $5 lunch special every day 11a 2p  chicken tasty sauces yummy   tried most them far really enjoy Louisiana Rub Garlic Parmesan flavors       It also nice place grab quick bite eat   pretty quickly when need be   If sports always seems something TVs   sporty vibe but isn't shoved down your throat either   fun place eat   They email club join website coupons emails pretty regularly well   love good coupon! <EOR> Haven't wings yet post review shortly however just place carry order must say gentleman phone great! Very polite perfect customer service! Excited finally try wings! <EOR> Tried wings first time  enjoyed them back again  Tried four different flavors  garlic Parmesan favorite Louisiana rub close behind   enough heat mild but good flavor if don't spicy  lemon pepper would again wasn't strong enough  Just tasted chicken finger  ranch sauce very good   The restaurant nice sports all TV's but freezing cold  little loud talking but great watching games  <EOR> I realized minute since wings  place close knew would fast  Besides friendly service all say fast friendly service    Dry bone in wings  tried 4 sauces none them hit being something would return for  sauces hot enough me    If boneless more juicy  prefer traditional bone in overall because am fan breading but boneless ton breading only palatable option  <EOR> I've Wingstop fan quite some time now   friends would Green Valley Ranch location once week until closed down   Then started going Tropicana location although frequently due location    recently found particular location Maryland wanted give try   The manager DJ transferred Tropicana location   He remembers names even though only couple times month days always welcoming friendly   This location bit different most Wingstop locations   bar area   more seating normal   walls lined TVs showing sports   all things   other Wingstop locations would feel cramped would want leave soon finishing meal   The wings trip exceptionally large   never problem wing size Wingstop even bigger usual   typically hot sauce which decent amount kick   wings never undercooked overcooked quite tender juicy   I love ranch sauce   thin without being watery   Hard explain but perfect going hot wings   They TWO coke machines touchscreens   love those touchscreens but people slow figuring them out   two them hardly saw line waiting them   The only negative Wingstop price   small soda dozen wings ranch cost over $12  <EOR> I realize Wing Stop chain those familiar brand highly unlikely take customer reviews via Yelp into consideration before placing order here  However feel responsible informing anyone happens glance business location absolute worst customer services ever experienced  ordered take out couple weeks ago only come pick food told associate forgot place order  OOPS! No compensation offered time lost inconvenience cup water while boyfriend forced wait which also left waiting job picked additional thirty minutes  Giving second try evening experienced same epically shitty service before  tried ordering same special offered couple weeks ago told oh want special? don't that  Really? No suggestions other specials we're more willing purchase?  With being said Wing Stop off Nellis Stewart amazing service associates seem very happy they're getting paid might add no matter time day you're ordering  very clear whoever employing indignant robots location cares even less workers providing quality service  true tarnish Wing Stop's reputation  <EOR> I only wish place closer me! Fast service  sport bar concept Wing Stop  negative pay extra dips Ranch  <EOR> I've loved Wingstop since first Chicago  location really busy  Food still just good u remember back home  <EOR> I ordered 8 piece boneless meal  3 Cajun 5 hot Togo  4 Cajun 4 mild which also incredibly dry  happy all  <EOR> I pretty disappointed service here  messed order last time ate manager Maria swore down she'd put 'red book' which appears list credits dissatisfied customers   it's several pages   She neglected mention only keep records 30 days pretended remember serving when came today  Kinda sucks being screwed over twice same place  two wing stops Maryland guess know where take business future  <EOR> My very first visit Wingstop week must gotten lil lucky based some reviews read   around 9pm food service top notch actually surprised busy throughout night   Wings very good along fries cheese sticks   Will def back some RunninRebels away games  <EOR> Only reviewing bar area   came meet friend catch little March Madness   Clean facility wasn't busy plenty televisions catch sport event want watch    Staff very friendly helpful but maybe little bit much?  lot employees working actual customers being checked little much   might little quick clear table you   Just minor correction could work on     Its full bar fact asked kind liquor he responded Margarita's Beer   Ok duh think could looked bar realize that  LOL   So yes its truly just Margarita's Beer few available tap   Oh FYI if kind tip your bartender paying Credit Card don't gratuity line receipt   if Just right amount good service bring cash tip them  <EOR> So every just want solid chicken wing without paying true restaurant pricing   say Lemon Pepper wings bone in Wingstop among best chicken wings whether restaurant not   dressings dipping sauces also all top notch   Preferably blue cheese ranch they're both killer   Many locations all over town t easy convenient find location near you! <EOR> Horrible service dining room dirty soda machine almost empty  hundreds options think 3 available  Won't back  <EOR> First foremost huge fan Wing Stop excited when came across restaurant  Okay when entered restaurant they're 4 people already ordered seated  took 35 minutes food come all which FREEZING COLD!
