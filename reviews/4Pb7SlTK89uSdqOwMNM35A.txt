Wow   After spouse over paying $6 stale thick cold chips bland salsas Mexican restaurant mahi tacos chorizo burger arrived  3 stars food but lack attentiveness customer's experience really detracted whole experience    Of note menu dual pricing without Total Rewards card  TR card holder told weren't honoring Total Rewards discount any longer   but menu still states dual pricing applicable? Why??  Maybe cross white out prevent advertising error misinformation customers   or honor your posted prices!  The leftover burger took back hotel room still good cold   wish could say we'd back but won't  3rd visit date aside going middle night $2 tacos can't say worth many other dining options  <EOR> Went grab quick bite work few days ago definitely back! Drinks food great server brenda awesome made some really good food recommendations laughing whole time  <EOR> I staying inside Ballys realized needed some food before going endure night drinking  checked menu entrance looked pretty good deal  Grabbed seat bar just some MLP playoff games going no brainer  Josh working behind bar he gave tips should select menu  Mahi tacos an order 3 $11 which delight he said would be  Nice flavor slight kick spice going it   not bad  hoping could mix match 3 $11 deal but unfortunately told could only flavor deal   Since Mexican establishment only right partake some tequila  hard sitting right front shelf fully dedicated all different types tequila  Don Julio Silver smooth purposes    God spot grab quick bite night awesomeness  <EOR> Brenda very nice  Nachos very tasty  I definitely come back next time Vegas!!!! <EOR> The only reason two stars awesome bartender Archie! He made visit great awesome service! met told couldn't table hostess Roxana  I'm 7 Star but myself didn't bother flash card  shouldn't matter  place wasn't booked bizarre  However she also told hamburger came choice beef but she no idea meant  know meant USDA choice  She may just need training  Archie super nice took great care me  would only return because him  Churros also bomb! Loved chocolate raspberry sauce came with! <EOR> These guys took advantage because knew couldn't sit down restaurant since rush EDC  ordered to go skimped food made super plain  If sat down eat would complained them order correctly  don't substitute anything tipped very well before even food  only super pricey smallest portions Mexican restaurant but food also took forever screwed over every way  Taste price time orders made incorrectly  bean soup literally just beans water  description said bean soup sour cream tortilla chips cheese avocado etc only good thing happened willing steal money give subpar food  coming back ever suggest staff ownership fix place run  Bad business!! Yuck <EOR> I ended Tequila Taqueria while attending event Bally's   meeting couple friends dinner hankering Tex Mex   Tequila Taqueria conveniently located near ballroom convention area   They're right next Buca seem share some facilities glasses actually Buca logo it   Unfortunately location only things going it   food underwhelming   Nachos came small mountain looked pretty cool but pretty average   chicken tacos pretty dry didn't any accompaniments though seasoning them nice   Service wasn't best   wasn't crowded all but waitress seemed disappear taking orders missing long periods time   Adequate if really need some Tex Mex but probably better options around  <EOR> Tried sit order tacos 1030  told could accommodate because half restaurant closing    Even though supposedly don't close until 12  stay Balley's all time only never eat but may affect whether stay Ballys future because shocked treated  When advertise open until midnight may actually want abide that    Just thought  <EOR> Great place eat  Three shared nachos still leftovers  But waitress Shay awesome  She helped picking best drinks suggested yummy guacamole  give 5 stars  <EOR> The food tasted fine but vouchers free shots tequila staff claimed could only shot entire table  Also quesadillas complete rip off  $17 bite sized pieces  Definitely worth price  If anything nachos <EOR> Oh sweet baby Jesus!! appetizer Nachos AWESOME! chorizo burger quesadilla burger cooked perfectly  fries came burgers delicious  If you're hungry come but prepared walk off  <EOR> Simply put wife says best nachos she ever eaten  agree come close best  Huge portion could serve six  Hat only thing had  server polite didn't take long  Next time Vegas plan nachos again  <EOR> It wasn't actively bad  far good    They first did accept vertical IDs drinking which absurd  managed support entirely legal IDs secondary ones which absurd even question    The margaritas almost entirely mix left questioning if any alcohol all them  pitchers each filled three glasses  very small  all during happy hour paid $7 each glass margarita mix    Chips guac fine but also great  Would recommend  <EOR> Great food   awesome tacos excellent service   ordered taco plate outstanding   like mama's home cooking   rice beans home made well   know where dine Mexican when visiting Las Vegas  <EOR> EXCELLENT !!! time Happy Hour yet ? Well if isn't place offers great food great drinks   The chicken nachos feed family  $2 tacos full sized very tasty    The beers ??? $20 gets bucket also drafts   So if need quick munch break stop in  eat every time stay Ballys    See !!! <EOR> Stopped yesterday recommendations glad did  Great food  Adorable little place  server Eileen amazing  Really made night  10 10 come back  <EOR> I don't give lot star reviews yelp but wow place managed worst dining experience ever Vegas and visit city frequently enough   First menu accurate  Romaine lettuce salads? Try iceberg few sprinklings canned corn beans  I'd wager you'd find more nutrients old shoe   One friends vegan  She ordered salad without meat ensure would no meat products  Surprise! Pieces CHICKEN buried beneath all watery iceberg  fuck? She also ordered side guacamole  waitress seemed confused initially but then nodded said she could happen  appeared next small side cup chopped avocado pieces  same avocado pieces came slice form salad  So   when someone orders side guac just take avocado already comes salad chop into tinier pieces put side cup? Fuck that  girlfriend mash those pieces fork add available salt pepper table fish pieces tomato salad take wedge lime side another friend's plate OWN GUACAMOLE  Unacceptable   PS cilantro lime dressing oil based  thick buttermilk ranch cilantro flavoring  Another surprise   My other friends ordered tacos which greasy everyone felt bloated legitimate stomach ache required pepto bismol consumption  girl ordered shredded beef but instead saying didn't shredded beef just came back carnitas  Um   what if she couldn't eat pork medical religious reasons? can't just substitute meat without telling anyone until bite into discover ordered   Then fucked bill once but THREE times  poor friend dealing unsettled stomach all fucking grease while trying math third time  can't imagine worst feeling  shit pants yell server try add all numbers again? Maybe all three  Sigh   Disgusting food poor service perpetual parade fuck ups  If could summarize entire dining experience phrase it'd ho don't it  <EOR> Was staying Bally's decided check place out  Waited 20 minutes table which fine however told short staffed day  2 servers hustling all tables  ordered taco platter which comes rice beans  found really good  dining partner ordered burger satisfied well  nachos ginormous could feed crowd  Service slightly slow but expected no complaints  only disappointment being charged chips salsa  But guess nothing free Vegas! <EOR> Terrible service Husband active duty military father disabled vet  Upon arrival asked if military discount manager informed he would check but never came back  When waitress came table tried again decided ask her  She says she check manager let no    again no response  When check came AGAIN asked informing she manager forgotten  time she says she ask manager  short time she comes back says sorry he said no   Then proceeds take bills charges wrong bill wrong card  When explained wrong she blew off Sorry! nice day   When decided address fact manager didn't eggs come table tell didn't anything military he says oh gonna but time he couldn't anything because bill already paid couldn't refund anything  husband doesn't expect discounts anywhere however doesn't feel very well when someone serves doesn't even respect face face No instead send your staff whom even admitted he told tell because he didn't want to  $100 wasted BS Mexican  Chicken enchiladas no flavor salsa verde simply tasted lime some sort other weird grass taste  Only thing good fries  never return would've walked already ate appetizer <EOR> We waited more hour half just food  horrible service   the first manager female no customer service skills said kitchen forgot order told would drinks took another 15 minutes asked different manager    Choung manager handle wrong doing way take care customers Kenzi also great  <EOR> Steak taco platter better carnitas taco platter  much cilantro red onion other   Chicken quesadilla good  Black beans bland green rice is     huh  Overall just happy fed   Waitress spilled drink shot tequila kid  She forgot request lemon  Luckily meal came w lemon   We only saw few times  <EOR> Service terrible! told wait 10 minutes  gave menu look over while waited  way no waiting area chairs nearby  looking menu ten food items 15 minutes finally seated given same menu look again  20 minutes lady seated noticed waitress still hadn't shown she came took drink order  Waitress brought drinks left without taking order  almost finishing drink getting ready walk waitress shows up  She apologizes wait takes order finally  order carnitas tacos girlfriend gets shrimp tacos  then wait again  Food finally comes server ask carnitas  raise hand he puts plate halfway table just looks he wants grab it  awkward pause finally grab nice hot plate put front me  Really? couldn't put table warn plate hot?

Typical Vegas price range  again crowd right before dinner crowd came in    But overall great experience <EOR> Thought being Strip Bally's Casino would great   Very disappointing!  Food cold     Service poor  After sent food back server didn t check back see was! only saving grace Marguerites   recommend eat before Marguerita only! <EOR> I never experienced food sub par  Unbelievable  24 hour joint located inside Ballys Las Vegas  alive earth 35 years  live southern California  am Mexican  But know Mexican food  place served worst Mexican food ever eaten  Good part? Open 24hours  Full bar  Full bar going need swallow garbage  ordered fish tacos  Quite possibly saltiest nastiest morsels ever created gremlins  am going call kitchen staff cooks  Because means know prepare food  creatures create worst things ever known man  Might seem exaggerating  If dont believe ahead  dare eat trash  Also ordered nachos  Supposedly meant 3 4 people  spill bag tortilla chips spray random acts chicken crema bean residue expect pay 15 bux it  people no business serving dog food  star full bar show  food lot laughs  Harsh review think?

Overall food great waitress  <EOR> Great spot lunch dinner menu very limited but food tastes great actually came lunch decided come back dinner plenty choices tequila drinks <EOR> Cindy gave beyond great service  She made feel living Mexican dream tequila bar  She only made dining experience fun exciting but service point! coming back Cindy     Bring back ground beef tacos   See soon Cindy! Best waitress EVER <EOR> We stopped bite eat when first flew in  Vegas everything overpriced  kind sad didn't used years years ago  really nachos really feeling really good  said drinks food overpriced  waiter perfect  Fairly easy to  other selections nearby  <EOR> Shitty service waited almost 30 min 3 tacos happy hour weren't even super busy waitress clueless <EOR> I really food come often some servers very good some attentive  hostess named Kenzi very helpful getting more salsa utensils when asking twice no avail  Kenzi more happy help smile <EOR> I ate few days ago while passing through town  late tired staying hotel take out  wings side fries husband quesadilla burger fries  back room only see order fries missing  When tried call order made again phone just kept ringing ringing  husband back downstairs  pain but did fix issue  Besides experience wonderful  wings delicious husband enjoyed burger  fries     wanted more! incredibly delicious  Crispy outside flakey inside seasoned well chipotle aioli side amazing!!! I'd eat again but I'd eat restaurant next time  <EOR> Don't waste your time good very expensive basically ripoff  $10 half cup guacamole? Steak tacos no flavor Margs good but weak small $11 free chips salsa? Nope $5  $200 dinner four sucked <EOR> We stayed Bally's easy spot quick grub  NACHOS! Some best nachos and lot     We twice restaurant  First time sat bar no complaints service  second time mid day hostess said would 10 minute wait even though half tables empty because short staffed  really just wanted sit down the night before long night water  could wait order   but wasn't option  thought really odd   Other weird interaction hostess overall experience good happy! <EOR> I craving nachos ordered nachos two  sat bar bartender correctly advised going much food but did anyway  nachos piled high covered lots great toppings tasted delicious but unfortunately weren't layered turned big pile chips  Somewhat depressing atmosphere unconvincing location  Bartender nice guy   Terrible value $25 tip nachos <EOR> Happy hour = $2 tacos $20 margarita pitchers! don't much more say except tacos delightful margaritas savory  midday snack ate 3 tacos each but easily could've doubled that  Give place try good eats friendly service! <EOR> The staff very courteous willing accommodate party 11 such short notice   Food great! Definitely back again! <EOR> Located inside Bally's hotel beside Buca de Bepo restaurant  Saturday night when strip empty place packed    The food portions huge  at least nachos table next ordered  food over priced 3 carne asada tacos $14?! No chips salsa guacamole included  If want platter which 3 tacos rice beans $19  flavor tacos okay but if you're CA eat real Mexican food don't bother coming expecting same taste    The happy hour seems more reasonable   $2 taco Sunday Thursday 10pm 12am    Not sure back anything but they're tequila selection huge if love tequila  <EOR> First time eating establishment never return  service horrible waited over 45 minutes food  once during looong wait did waitress ask if would refill drinks  ask myself    sad  food great horrible but great  ordered asada tacos    the meat very dry  top all off chips salsa complementary  guess when fake Mexican restaurant  definitely BAR food afterthought  <EOR> Loved it! Food really good service exceptional  easy table good Mexican food  wrong  <EOR> Notorious mahi mahi fish tacos   Gross  Small  Flavorless worth time  told server did them he gave measly sorry  Wouldn't recommend anyone  Ambiance nice though  Modelo draft special awesome but food less mediocre  wanted try lobster tacos but price crazy based tasted don't think lobster would any better  <EOR> Ridiculous Burger Mexican restaurant thanks waitress Shay made all recommendations dinner  definitely back again soon  <EOR> Below average food  came happy hour we're given any menu any rundown staff happy hour even occurring  Extremely overpriced  13 dollars flavorless melted cheese queso fundito   fun 10 cents worth meat 13 dollar meal  Absolutely won't back  <EOR> Im sure why world place only 3 stars !!! freaking delicious ! quesedilla burger just most wonderful flavors   also bartenders Brian Ricardo really amazing made feel much better flight cancelled   keep them around lol am totally french fry person but french fry swirls die !!! <EOR> Lousy slow service chicken tacos dry disgusting!!! Avoid place all costs <EOR> very disappointing rules corporate established   hard imagine would serve 21 year old because California DL vertical horizontal   wtf <EOR> My brother law wanted tacos yelp tacos found place  Omg place restricts your availability tacos  Only chicken pork fish tacos  Majority people whites asians only hispanics service bad food terrible  Only bright side chef came greet she such sweetheart she's only reason gave place 2 stars <EOR> Ended bad service another place  late weeknight  Food surprisingly good  Queso flameado great wings which generally would never Mexican place but really good great portion  giant nachos looked REALLY good  Would back try  Hostess could more accommodating nice  <EOR> The food awesome  Happy hour $2 tacos deal can't pass they're delicious! margaritas ok  margarita saint Rita south border margarita which pretty good  But $2 tacos Mexican corn delicious!! Squeeze some lime those suckers oh boy! service lacks little bit busy times but manager very nice top everything  happy hour sunday through Thursday 3 5pm 10pm midnight  Stop  $2 tacos won't disappointed  second time definitely returning  <EOR> Chicken tacos terrible meat small tasted sour jerk chicken  Pricey $4 taco  during happy hour but didn't honor happy hour price cause Father's day  place empty though  <EOR> WORST DINING EXPERIENCE place doesn't even deserve 1 star   So came because really hungry needed something eat right away boy regret ever coming here  First all service sucked although once voiced disappointment manager waitress suddenly become attentive! seated waited 5 minutes and yes 5 minutes problem when starving place completely empty before receiving menu while hostess chatted away waitress someone  actually seat walked ask menu  Once menu looked prices everything menu ridiculously expensive but thought would enjoy food anyways because love Mexican  ordered Guacamole chips actually awful  guac price slap face  guac no onions lemon taste tomatoes anything real guac brings except avocado  Literally guac just smashed avocado  literally asked cup onions tomatoes fresh lemon made own table  seriously?!?!  I could already tell place sucked should left right then but stayed gave restaurant benefit doubt    ordered enchilada  date ordered burger  enchilada absolutely DISGUSTING  Actually worst enchiladaI ever life  First all food arrived cold yes enchilada cold  looked extremely sad  sell enchilada having salsa verde onions avocado but those things only GARNISHES  RIP OFF!! Three pieces onions three sad pieces avocado  Even writing review pissing off again  called manager right away voiced disgusting food right away comforted manager trying best embarrassed  thought would order quesadilla restaurant could redeem itself  manager kept telling food would right away  but don't want FAST FOOD TAKE YOUR TIME making food  want under cooked rushed anyway  rather wait little while really GOOD food fast below average     The quesadilla OK but only because trying hard couldn't even finish entire thing because anxiety over whole ordeal  Everything place SUCKED really hope review stops anyone coming until new chef new staff change menu around completely    Total waste $$$ <EOR> We came late around 11 00 PM night  Attentive friendly service decent seating atmosphere   The food Overpriced  You forced into buying combos  cannot buy 1 2 tacos but forced buy 3  If you're mix match person you  Quality decent  Chips Salsa Sauce spicy don't anything mild   The worst part When order second appetizer decided just settle chips salsa overheard waiter say under breath yeah well  only thing   REALLY? thought LAS VEGAS? AM BARSTOW? <EOR> I recommend place! food bad  tacos good over priced  If really mood tacos Mexican food would recommend finding taco truck going off strip real Mexican restaurant  <EOR> HAPPY HOUR REVIEW You'd hard pressed find better happy hour deal late night food drink specials Strip service excellent   Sunday Thursday 3pm 5pm 10pm 12am $2 00 chicken pork tacos $20 00 margarita pitchers  The tacos hearty size delicious especially price   margarita pitchers large strong but should ask them cut some soda cut sour mix if don't want heartburn next morning   12am 6am also 3 taco plate deal $11 99 choice chicken pork mahi steak   Items would also recommend trying cucumber margarita really refreshing strong especially hot day nachos which huge mountain enough 4 hungry people table side guacamole which surprisingly perfect!

HORRIBLE service! ALL staff rude seemed though bothering them being restaurant  Food mediocre but EXTREMELY over priced  Tacos little meat dry  asked some sauce salsa tacos told pay extra $2 salsa  would think paying $14 3 little tacos little meat no rice no beans also extra would come salsa  Happy hour starts 10pm 10pm when asked happy hour tacos waiter said no happy hour today  No reason just no happy hour today even though posted all over signage menu  think Ballys Hotel should ashamed having such restaurant staff hotel!  Only giving star because order write review  place deserves negative star  <EOR> Would recommend  First food before ever margarita probably ready earlier but remind waitress  Second drink ordered very good  Food ok service good  eat again <EOR> We saw ridiculously overpriced food drinks well decided share nachos  tax total came $20! chips honestly tasted bagged chips poured some yellow canned cheese here  shredded chicken tasted good but limited  barely any beans all mainly half nachos just chips  Didn't come Guacamole waters keep cost down  waitresses nice though  <EOR> I very hungry last night sort late mom decided eat Mexican food spot inside hotel Bally's  When saw prices charged immediately disbelief because charges $7 99 chips salsa  However late hungry ordered 3 fish tacos $20 99 only thing could really eat  food comes fish tacos size street tacos cold  forced self eat first taco drowning Tapatio  couldn't bring myself even try eat others  let waitress Brenda know food cold would able eat it  She gets manager takes additional 10 minutes come back explain issue  He apologizes says he them tacos fresh should take 3 minutes  He graciously brings some chips salsa inconvenience  pretty nice but sat table adding seasoning salsa because hard eat no flavoring  3 minutes tacos took another 10 minutes come out  Meanwhile waitress Brenda kept checking making laugh each time she came by  Finally tacos came made way originally requested but least hot time  managed eat taco then removed batter other two just ate fish inside  realized hard eat cold tacos because batter did good seasoned flavoring  think if going charge $20+ some Street tacos should edible better quality  back here  quality quantity food worth price  Quality really matters dining experience  only reason gave them two because Brenda waitress top notch! She increased rating 1 Star originally gave them  <EOR> Not worth 1 star  Service horrible completely screwed  order never came back table  Waited over hour someone come refill drinks  Finally someone come over excuse really busy but food coming people over waiting even longer had  Finally food Manger said house  took cause tired waiting only back room @ Bally's LV completely ruined food tasted horrible  free but even free good enough should paid us  This place owned same owner Buca Di Peppo next @ Bally's don't even started place  visit Bally's alot never step foot back into joint ever! <EOR> Service horrible go  Walked no clean tables   asked waitress said employee called which why dirty      Sat down high table only find rickety  Eventually waitress cleaned off table which sat down upon ordering strawberry margarita waitress just gave rocks the time wanted blended   Order shrimp tacos shrimp super tiny tacos pretty cold   Oh! missed happy hour 2 minutes which time spent scanning table then being seated table   Super disappointing  Crappy service  great food  <EOR> First all fantastic waitress!
