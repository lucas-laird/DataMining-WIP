The other two party chicken waffles grilled skirt steak sandwich  did note try but liked both dishes  <EOR> I typically try only post positive reviews  However place  celebrate birthday daughter's good friend  8 us  tip automatically added  thought going Restaurant Week breakfast brunch based menus read online  However told available noon  reservation noon    Then overwhelmed denial thought going ordered full brunch everyone which HUGE mistake  $40 per person  assortment things delivered often cold uncoordinated just sync next item  item good  The Jumbo Lump Crabcake Benedict Creole Hollandaise  Unfortunately however time served all already stuffed other things delivered  If ordered enjoyed only would 4 star rating except service     The staff untrained seemed unknowing uncaring  asked Ramos Fizz cocktail said well tell see if know it  did want run risk bartender did know ordered Bellini instead    When check whether could anything special 19th birthday waitress said ohhh um   do mean candles? Um don't that  said fine    Our group included 3 adults over 21 5 teens aged 15 16 18 18 19  adults cocktails brunch  Then near end brunch when brought assorted desserts included brunch even though already served 7  courses everyone stuffed plate only chocolate dipped strawberries put down teenagers  Then brought plate several other interesting looking cooked deserts puddings  waitress then said desserts  included alcohol could consumed minors  dined very often Las Vegas never seen heard anyone say before   Since adults stuffed strawberries quickly passed other desserts down teenagers no driving  tried them all enjoyed them    I would normally done but 1 all disappointed weird brunch 2 felt should explained when ordered if more half table could enjoy dessert paying advance    Then while enjoyed desserts dining staff acted normal no mentioned word desserts being eaten teenagers    Then even though brunch ended costing over $500  8 left disappointed odd unorganized uncaring wait staff was  whole thing odd disappointing  If eat  do order brunch  <EOR> I wore jeans 80 degrees there    asked them turn air conditioning said right next best spot air conditioning haha    Bloody Mary's excellent well mimosas  Food ok  <EOR> This tucked away gem sits next pool area 4th floor  big but serving really quality eats extremely reasonable prices being Strip! grilled mahi mahi herb chimmichurri mango salsa spectacular only $20! Great brunch cocktails very chill ambiance being pool patio  Lots classic brunch dishes burgers fish tacos salads more    I would given 5 stars but hostesses slipped bit  came restaurant told 15 min wait took phone number notify us  told them going head bar  20+ mins passed saw other tables seated came back them ask situation was  said called left voicemail only hold tables 5 mins  Unfortunately didn't call phone hand entire time taking pictures videos no voicemail  insisted called but no record anything  word wise sure your correct number down since imagine took down wrong number  <EOR> The Overlook restaurant adjacent excellent pool area Cosmopolitan Hotel seemed ideal spot lunch sunny afternoon  Service friendly fairly efficient  waitress suggested ceviche appetizer which appealed but ended disappointing all us  mystery fish looked pink chicken pieces tasteless  Squeezing lime over preparation gave hint citrus but marinade bland otherwise pieces fish actually frightening when examined closely  Truly mystery meat!  I ordered Caesar Salad which turned very expensive bowl romaine pieces stale croutons tossed bitter dressing tasted nothing Caesar creative substitute  husband's fried clams tasted almost good Mrs  Swanson's frozen variety friend's sandwich stale  All items ordered difficult botch but place succeeded brilliantly that   It would easy Overlook provide tasty simple food  But offerings tasteless best overpriced  happy pay well good food but items tried very disappointing  Try pizza second floor any other dining choices Cosmopolitan but avoid Overlook!  I suspect good reviews Yelp came folks enjoying pool scene attractive waitresses cocktails  <EOR> I came quick bite eat since overlooked pool hotel assumed would relaxing watch all alcoholics while eating  wrong  didn't even sit anywhere overlook anything  sat inside wasn't complaining though  hungover whatever  For when seated ordered everything confusing  thought hostess hostess then later seemed she waitress then later waitress came didn't know even tipping   I ordered fish tacos which seemed only appetizing thing menu wrong again  presentation nice fish breaded but horrible  Especially price! friend ordered sandwich much better tasting cheaper ordered  Our hostess great never know server food bad  won't back  Henry's instead  <EOR> We party six made reservations few days advance lunch Sunday  seated promptly waitress cheerful attentive  Great selection menu choices well drinks  huevos rancheros which included chicken  wife fish tacos  monkey bread good starter  Adjacent pool bright airy spot  <EOR> Turkey burger came undercooked but made new wasn't bad  definitely pool cafe though  really place come unless convenient  Fish tacos weren't bad  Also ware no breakfast all day   Service bad slow never refill your water  <EOR> Delicious breakfast great natural sunlight  husband both omelettes quinoa salad side freshly table side made guacamole  Everything delicious service bonus  fresh green juice MUST! <EOR> After days heavy eating cocktails needed something fresh found Overlook Grill  Airy space good vibe added pleasurable late breakfast early lunch  waiter Gustavo could more pleasant appropriately attentive    I ate simply fresh fruit platter chopped salad hit spot!  wished cocktail bottomless bubbly mimosa looked great  breakfast food going looked great plentiful    The restaurant little hard find three escalators but more worth it  <EOR> We looking full breakfast but didn't want travel far hotel it  gave concierge call recommendation once ones highly recommended breakfast  Unfortunately stayed West tower Overlook Grill located East Tower poolside bit walk  However when finally reached restaurant pleasantly surprised casual ambiance decor nice view pool area  indoor outdoor seating nice morning most people opted outdoor seating  chose sit inside where less crowded felt very homey  Service good friendly but breakfast really impressed me   I ordered Eggs Your Way which made 3 eggs any style choice Breakfast Sausage Chicken Apple Sausage Hobbs Bacon signature house potatoes choice toast  ordered egg white scramble Chicken Apple Sausage toasted sourdough really enjoyed it  friends ordered Overlook Omelette enjoyed very much  portions quite large you'd better hungry  only complaint friends didn't seem enjoy coffees ordered very much  However enjoyed whole breakfast hot tea    and all very reasonable price   Looking outside outdoor patio area noticed table enjoying basket pastries large bottle champagne orange juice     we wanted try mimosa but figured enough alcohol night before but would definitely come back try perhaps next morning  Nice breakfast good friendly service pleasantly quiet casual atmosphere made very enjoyable breakfast experience  <EOR> Food delicious  Only gripe weren't many options least breakfast  Atmosphere good breakfast brunch setting   Don't see myself planning back anytime soon because lack options but if someone asked because they'd want try I'd knowing whatever order good  <EOR> The chicken comes chicken waffles disgusting couldn't even finish it  Monkey bread completely burned hard brick  Turkey burger Asian inspired taste?
