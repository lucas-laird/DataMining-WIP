Well if Sushi Trop short walk cab ride away  where you'll end up    why place exists  <EOR> Wow unassuming joint outside  just show Las Vegas pays investigate things which look might dives   I actually thought place way better Yama Sushi told chef  because sushi chef am sad say didn't name constant habit saying 'And then?' every order  first found tad off putting because totally used forcing every AYCE sushi chef give more sushi    because AYCE sushi pansies  Then realized fucking genius service mode into good rhythm   The waitresses okay  developed plate pile point two different waitresses appetizer because sushi chef called over help but she kept water   At 24 bucks comparatively priced came appetizer  tempura squid which very hot pretty good  wanted octopus salad but available ? Though ended really enjoying tempura squid    Sush Nigirii pieces came lot rice thick seaweed  Tako pretty good still titch chewy but again octopus pretty chewy  want it  mackerel yellowtail tasted very fresh distinct each fish  didn't care urchin which um very very sea urchin  salmon roe massive eggs  Inari tasty didn't care crab meat all but those two choices friend dining far less adventurous raw fish   Rolls Large selection choose here  Final Destination 2 first selection spicy softshell crab inside four fish outside  Well actually recall ending sweet shrimp but yeah  really good  Love Tender second call rolls which crab eel inside eel outside  Delicious  far more adventurous ports call roll list I'd back try them  friend's Philadelphia rolls okay if you're into but say should just eat bagel if want cream cheese fish   Dessert ice cream  red bean say thought Yama better red bean ice cream? only real disappointment evening    well aside watching Governor Gibbons blather television  sort depressing hour really need AYCE sushi save  <EOR> I looking new sushi place try somewhat close UNLV spend lunch break today  reading Yelp reviews decided give place try  Upon coming reservations pretty empty lunch hour look outside don't know expect definite hole wall     I sat bar began perusing menu  menu very organized baked rolls fresh fish tempura rolls etc  which nice when know kind roll you're mood for  fan Loco Mexicano because spicy love spicy rolls  some nigiri another roll can't remember name because obviously wasn't something write home about  All all pretty good wouldn't say great   The waitress nice friendly  sushi chef's name Mike he very nice helpful  He offered special spicy roll but point full couldn't fathom trying tasty creations  He did some salmon nigiri which creations which delish  wish wider nigiri option though some nigiri isn't even available unless dinner which think bit ridiculous  also put sauces lot rolls which unaware enjoy simple rolls where actually taste fish  Next time know request no sauce    All all they're nice friendly helpful creative  Lunch price approx $20 AYCE dinner think around $24  definitely worth price you're paying  definitely back  <EOR> I several times friends food always great servers nice portions good  <EOR> Went wife other day  first thing notice staff they're all *very* friendly fun no qualms engaging guests  A lot sushi places give feeling you're intruding them  Immediately feel welcome  seats comfortable all cramped  another plus    I love spicy sushi chefs made custom roll attempt see limits spice tolerance were  pleased say he banged right against limit  nice surprise!  also Philly roll hand roll first time normally cut roll     may never another ice cream cone again just back more Philly hand rolls  spectacular    The only downside place seems almost everything menu mayo it  Since mayo disgusting  kind limiting factor  <EOR> I say place pretty good sushi decent price   especially place desert coast  names rolls pretty ridiculous but nonetheless sushi pretty good! server kind  came Sunday late lunch  Only half group but still kindly seated even allowed order some food without imposing 1 hour time limit us! pay little more dinner price during lunch order off dinner menu  However don't only allowed order some seafood thing probably oysters can't remember per person    Something really weird made sushi but let only eat fish without eating rice? mean    already said didn't want rice yet still give rice but let eat rice? starving kids Africa  Please don't waste rice  only reason would come back if friends wanted to    also gave many free bottles sake  <EOR> We tried place first time  Being Japanese descent having family owned Japanese restaurants past Cali tried order favorites but most menu but no longer available    no tofu dishes no curry no tropicana combo dinners   ordered miso soup appetizer  hungry but son husband  ordered meals   Nice friendly but    sons teriyaki chicken grilled chicken teri sauce didn't cover all chicken californial roll just okay salad plate italian dressing miso soup weak literally tiny square tofu it husbands two green tea weak never brought meal   When waitress finally came over table guys almost done when husband told meal never came she said oh am sorry    it  isn't authentic Japanese owners Japanese  won't back  <EOR> Eating around dinner time seems way go  Menu availability kinda sucks around lunch time only 45 mins service tends bit poor experiences  also  surprise bank statement which $10 more paid last visit extra $10 top 15% tip bill even checked over receipt just watch crooked servers pay entire meal cash if possible  If wanted shell much extra would gone dinner menu  <EOR> I love place! sushi amazing especially deep fried tempura spider rolls  Just thinking hungry!! service bit slow when busy but food amazing  If during daytime tends bit slower service point  sure stamp card all eat sushi eating free full card stamps best!! <EOR> All eat sushi?

Next time am going specify little no extra sauce  still feel salty several days later  The service kind hyper none waitresses table side more 5 seconds  table few people sushi bar group 10 back area  guess many people bit much crew handle? waitress extra hyper dropped off order jumped away! kind funny watch actually  <EOR> The sushi warm   I didn't order baked sushi tempura sushi either    I ask dish mix wasabi soy sauce     Oh yeah ended sick over night into morning meal very unhappy stomach     I wish could say better things place because before years ago date review good   But if expectation now warm sushi going sick no no thank you  <EOR> I coming 3 years now never problem food  always everything fresh even surprise chef specials because eat often  service very hit miss  waitress your butt removing your plate search restaurant water  But regardless if sit bar rest assure sushi always flow your plate sushi lovers love  All eat great plus too <EOR> Worst service ever  server kicked 60 minutes  wouldn't mind if didn't take 30 minutes food  only ordered twice because service slow  full off water  chefs waiters demeaning rude talked smack FRONT FACE  Which really don't understand because weren't acting rude  weren't mean give them attitude when rude   They charged gratuity even though only 5 us  Which fine because usually really good tipper  Your lost guys    influential person college social community  Don't expect recommendation  If want quality AYCE sushi just sushi mon oishi  Even though far worth money  WORST 32 dollars spent life  would rather give money starving kids africa back here  <EOR> Great Service pretty good sushi sure if because looked professional but gave free appetizer free dessert  Highly recommend it  <EOR> Aesthetically Sushi Trop easy eyes inside but doesn't represent food  All rolls seemed mash color green orange white  Seems just business making money no passion towards work output    The Pros Organized using menu sheet Server repeats orders Wasabi between fish rice nigiri Tons rolls Free beer Bud lite miller lite sake  The Cons Missed orders several times Definite corner cutting i e  Kalbi appetizer 3 pieces cut short rib seems big waste onions Inconsistent i e  some big rolls small rolls different size cuts same fish Small nigiri selection I'm sure if small if just spoiled Goyemon Fish quality uncertainty  Overall so so if eat rolls involve yum yum sauce ponzu garlic whatever but if you're more nigiri person then pass! <EOR> Love love LOVE Sushi Tropicana!!

If chefs weren't busy taking multiple sake bombs maybe wouldn't issue  told server if each roll would take long don't even want waste time she assured everything its way   After some more waiting server brings 6 dishes  3 6 dishes dishes appetizers which complimentary chef compensate wait  further angered because 1 clearly saw food menu didn't order reason 2 obviously using tactic fill 3 point neglected everything else ordered thought we'd satisfied that!  Trying calm myself hoped food worth wait took bite sushi Kiss Ass!! MOST DISGUSTING PUTRID TASTE THATS EVER MOUTH!!!
