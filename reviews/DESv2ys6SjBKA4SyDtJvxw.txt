Meh  felt Olive Garden steroids  Less kitschy Italian homeware replicas but still sort faux interior facade  Good wow date special occasions but  it  <EOR> Delicious food! great serve food late decent prices too! Totally saved late night flight into Vegas <EOR> I came company's dime dinner execs sales people during weekend tradeshow   When heard Ferraro's off Strip rejoiced because nice getting scene same time thought wtf going???  When pulled into strip mall spied massage parlor again thought wtf going?  However soon walked concerns put rest   The atmosphere cozy romantic darkly lit small trio playing music   small large Goldilocks said just right   staff Ferraro's great being party 25 8PM Friday which nightmare restaurant you're expecting much but everyone quite gracious  servers took time tailor suggestions everyone looking whether more information particular wine suggestions appetizers     Food wine delicious well saw heard fellow diners   didn't taste everyone else's plates cuz um yea going ask CEO if try osso bucco but food delicious   took different direction co workers ribeye cooked medium rapini   When plate came table everyone else lil bug eyed because really quite large   hunger best though being 12 hours tradeshow inhaled steak which perfectly cooked warm reddish pink center charred outside just it   Rapini bit bitter could used more garlic but hey cares delicious steak   I no idea much dinner would but if come Vegas again wanted change pace find strip I'd definitely come again  <EOR> The food amazing   Francesco chef did phenomenal work lemon Sauce salmon And pasta best Ive ate Vegas    Tate waiter definitely very helpful knowledgable  all around amazing experience thank again!! recommend anyone know back soon  <EOR> A First Class Restuarant!

He experience over top! Ferraro's true gem city  Can't wait back April  <EOR> If know difference between authentic Italian Americanized Italian only place Las Vegas go  Having grown Italian family only restaurant Las Vegas serves kind homemade dishes parents grandparents made dinner especially Sundays  pasta homemade all sauces made scratch  vibe entire staff obvious Ferraro's family run business minute walk through door end dinner  casinos where everything corporate robotic  opinion comes 25 years working restaurant business most which spent kitchen 100% Italian ancestry  <EOR> The wonderful neapolitan style pizzas gone down down hill  Overcooked dry almost inedible  shame! They used good   I suspect new pizzaiolo cuz something changed   The rest food made Mimmo still excellent but say bye bye pizzas  <EOR> Bumped back five stars  Service Happy Social Hour Menu Wine glass most extensive dessert dinner beverage list ever seen  Wonderful  <EOR> Given glowing reviews other diners looking forward trying place but found food grossly overpriced underwhelming flavor presentation   I used Yelp Check coupon free appetizer   Instead being allowed chose appetizer menu waiter brought small serve spaghetti bolognese ravioli share   food tasted bland   I ordered scallop dish which comprised only 4 scallops $29 00 some crunchy bits tiny chopped veges underneath   The highlight meal salad insalata mimmo which very flavorful but didn't come salad!  Because restaurant less half full holiday weekend wait staff circled table relentlessly flies looking crumbs   totally lacked sense acuity intrusive which took away dining experience   By way small parking lot full but able find parking spot without much trouble   Needless say returning restaurant when many other great restaurants Las Vegas choose from  <EOR> Thank yelpers steering 17th wedding anniversary   great dining experience   Patrick server offered excellent suggestions if back Vegas would definitely way dine here     Risotto balls delicious but much 2 people definitely taste truffle oil if big mushroom fan probably good choice   really enjoyed them   chopped salad best ever had     Main entrees osso bucco didn't disappoint   Risotto lobster bit heavy also features truffle oil    but perfectly cooked good amount lobster meat   wine glass prices pricey but bottle prices seemed reasonable   Armed restaurant com certificate didn't hesitate splurge anniversary dinner worth every penny! <EOR> Absolutely BEST Italian food Las Vegas PERIOD!  I've several times last time being Valentines Day   When arrived manager gives ladies rose really nice touch   end dinner gave complimentary desert share fabulous   Every dish tastes individually made sauce die for   spaghetti sogleti sko leo chuck full calamari lobster clams shrimp      But best thing restaurant service   Hands down best service Las Vegas     You reserve table online   extensive wine list!  Ambiance fabulous  <EOR> Their food awful  ordered chicken marsala dry tasteless  disappointed    expecting wowed  <EOR> I travel Las Vegas frequently business always stay off strip preferably Embassy Siites just behind Ferraro's Swenson   mood light dinner headed strip mall where Ferraro's located   entered immediately floored prices   realize filthy strip mall sharing space Piercing Emporium shady looking massage parlor? I myself although tables dining room hostess clearly wanted sit bar followed there   She asked if needed wine list but did not then sat SIX minutes no menu no drink no food no bread nothing   Doesn't sound such long time but when hungry seems FOREVER   Maybe hoping would leave?? I eventually placed order bread basket came   server courteous but semed little distracted subtly implying she bigger better tables to   She helpful menu choices placed order   bread basket arrived fairly quickly salad arrived   chopped salad which delicious blend iceberg lettuce black olives Italian meats light oil vinegar based dressing very good!  Unfortunately stumbled next order see several items pasta pizzetes etc both Italian sausage BEANS them  server explained due chef's Tuscan influence  When ordered pizzete she recommended white pizza blend garlic cheeses but Pizzete Toscani aforementioned sausage beans   Bad choice   neither tasty nor appetizing   Food 2 5 service 4 5 3 5 stars overall  <EOR> We just returned Las Vegas where daughter married   Ferraros Italian restaurant served party 25 open bar including appetizers followed beautiful supper including multiple entree selections wine directed sommelier   evening wonderful wishes only met but exceeded   would recommend restaurant meal event without reservation   compliments all Ferraros! <EOR> Angelo maxing made husband's birthday dinner good friends dinner absolutely amazing!

Served over garbanzo beans believe was? skin small sea bass crispy side meat juicy tender  easy eat too  Bones only found tail think deboned most before cooking    Seafood pappardelle very seafoody   sauce tangy flavor blended well lobster scallop there  thinly sliced asparagus provided good crunch balance soft scallop noodles al dente!

On brighter note three people party Seafood Pasta absolutely raved dishes  four others party neither complained  nor expressed anything positive meals    Finally Ferraro's does allow any outside wine  if special bottle special occasion plan going somewhere else!
