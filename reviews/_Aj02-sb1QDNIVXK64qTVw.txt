I heading Starbucks always  Saw sign decided give them try  Drove thru latte jolly flavor  glad didn't join Starbucks long line really don't know why did many years  Way better drinks very friendly staff better price  Almost no waiting time drink    Jolly beans new spot drinks sure  <EOR> This very healthy menu people work very kind friendly used French bakery but new owners turned into something much more inviting little little sparse decor but definitely worth trying <EOR> The baristas ultra friendly when stepped into store two iced lattes really good full aroma smooth milk  seating spacious but could tell fast food restaurant setting turning into cafe well doesn't bother me  environment quiet some music would bring book laptop sit chill  <EOR> When found Jolly Beans Inspirada loved it only complaint location  Now they've brought coffee side town old Camille Manon location!   Location clean modern tons windows sunshine  Drinks include iced hot coffees teas well smoothies mango favorite! boba  Currently lunch wraps salads available but rumor they're bringing vegan menu now just keep eating buffalo chicken salad    Interior lot seating service fast friendly  drive thru if you're hurry offer happy hour drink discounts  Hoping more fresh pastries settle location seems larger kitchen   TIP Take advantage buy one one 25% off discount soft opening through July 6   <EOR> First star jolly personality drive thru presenting to go order boxed baggy handles  Second star half coffee portion menu    Mocha frappe great flavor sweet caffeinated  coffees 'may' only thing bring back   Buffalo chicken wrap no stars per tastebuds strange gurgles per stomach  Buffalo flavor sour preference  left lingering distasteful blah tongue  Didn't finish it   No further comments  <EOR> I walked into Jolly Beans   saw location turned French Bistro recent months more recognizable name   Coffee selection immense!  Many syrups styles choose from   Candy toppings well coffee   stuck vanilla latte cashier's suggestion experience coffee bit more   prices bit cheaper Seattle based competition next street over   Friendly staff   brought food drink over see picture below   Breakfast burrito egg cheese bell pepper mainly yellow onion Spinach Tortilla   Pretty tasty   Overall menu selection limited food wise but should find something if hungry   also couple vegan options few more if vegetarian   Repainted decorated lobby   Modern rustic definitely attempted well here   Music easy going pop   electronic outlets bar those wanting it   Overall clean kept place seat 50 though other only foot traffic     It'll interesting see more people  <EOR> Been place few times now  Haven't tried food yet  mocha ad shot today Americano ad shot usual  Mocha bit sweet taste just tastes very sugary  Americano ordered today actually pretty watery considering extra shot  back guy working remade perfect  He actually made iced coffee espresso Red eye but rich taste which great  reminded Americano still other places   still think coffee needs work opening next starbucks maybe wasn't best idea But hey maybe huge success  Good service especially today back try some food Red eye again  <EOR> I made conscience effort way drop Jolly Beans due Yelp e mail  wanted give new small bussiness chance    coffee good but food little underwhelming  Bagel sandwich store bought bagel didn't 'wow' me  If neighborhood again might stop coffee supporting mermaid Seattle coffee place  <EOR>
