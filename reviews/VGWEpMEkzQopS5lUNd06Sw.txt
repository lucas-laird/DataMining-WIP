Cool spot lunch lunch specials great priced  food awesome! server's friendly great spot watch sports  <EOR> We decided try Alehouse some friends new time give chance  somewhat brief wait since 7 PM expected anyplace Town Square sat down first drinks  side group beers which priced little high opinion but typical any Vegas restaurant  husband other couple double vodka tonic which wished ordered since only $5 decent price    After started ordering food which all decided split would all able try some different thing  started off Calamari appetizer which fairly typical but splashed fairly lively sweet chili sauce actually pretty good  pass around main courses ordered Mini Burgers Fish Chips full rack Baby Back Ribs  burgers cooked little bit long really nothing memorable them all  Fish Chips crisp all way much fishy taste them indicating perhaps sitting around long  little odd since place hasn't open long enough anything really sitting around long  pretty horrible end couldn't possible recommend them  Ribs made far rib per person before all concurred just horrible sent them back  Ribs them self obviously all same completely dependent sauce rub bring them life  stretcher being covered sheet  sauce odd taste couldn't even identify would think sense taste    Obviously manager came over sent ribs back fairly quickly offered free dessert taking them off bill  decided Brownie Sundae which opinion good but wife liked she far better judge am fan brownie sundaes  would gone another direction but women usually want    I realize place some standalone single owned restaurant but rather location chain thing can't expect change menu  Knowing chain bugs should worked menu now things should little better were    I can't say all negative things place though  manager very quickly responsive dislike ribs rather making sit bit wondering status was  cannot fault staff all since restaurant part larger machine just going through motions doing jobs  lot TVs distract yourself some sport hope don't notice food tastes    The restaurant winds being end many chain restaurants  No soul no meaning  couldn't even figure theme supposed be  saw someone say place better Yardhouse but must written someone doesn't beer  Alehouse 15 beers tap which slightly different Yardhouse  Plus food Yardhouse seems much better eaten there    My final recommendation if you're going eat Miller's Alehouse somewhere else  probably work more your favor  Let place patronized people just going drink don't care they're eating  <EOR> Had dinner St Patty's weekend bunch friends  Good service  Good food reasonable price  Parking available everywhere  More upscale PTs fancy Yard House  <EOR> LOVE LOVE LOVE Miller's Ale House   management personnel Paul Summer Eric John Steve awesome bartenders Tim Alex Kimmie Steve Clay Jennel Ann Amber Reese Dominique treated special   soon walk door TV's put favorite sports teams drinks bar before even sit down   chair stool back brought bar because don't sitting backless stools   food delicious reasonable prices daily specials exactly special especially Monday rack ribs YUMMMMM!!!!

Ridiculous! <EOR> Amazing staff attentive managers great food price  Cannot say enough wonderful things place  <EOR> This place nothing special but ok job basics  place huge fair amount tv's nd decent sized bar  <EOR> I cannot bring myself love place really wanted to   brand new great menu but lacks awesome flavor category   try real hard but felt if something missing all dishes   We came right when opened wasn't crowded which nice   server nice guy very quiet enthusiastic host but he checked made sure drinks   decided try appetizer never heard before cup soup 2 different entrees   Here's breakdown experience When intially ordering gave server 1 appetizer 2 entrees he immediately left table without finishing order   wanted 2 mushroom soups but assume he thought ordered enough food large people    opinion situation   Usually when server leaves without waiting say  assume personally feel enough order  Crab mozzarella deep fried balls mozzarella crab jalapeno it   Pretty good serve sauce sweet creamy   bit watery but still tasted nice  Mushroom morel soup bad   tasted Cheesecake factory's soup which assume use same company order food  Miller's steak sandwich big chunky sloppy   flavors typical steak sandwich mushrooms onions   liked it   fries typical restaurant fries  Baked seafood combo stuffed shrimp piece mahi clams scallops   husband ate but tried mahi crab stuffed shrimp   First use imitation crab stuffing shrimp so so   Secondly mahi lacked proper seasoning   Salt pepper long way despite using paprika sprinkling need use basics too   The Nutty Brother Dessert   ice cream cake slice two layers vanilla nutter butter cookie base chocolate peanut butter sauce   quite yummy   Overall service average food   would back eat crab mozzarella appetizer but agree others worth long drive for   wouldn't crave place over over again  Still okay hope gets better  <EOR> We walked out!  Never chance try food because over hour wait Saturday afternoon   UFC fight didn't know watch fight dinner per hostesses   2 empty large areas manager walking around shaking head   first time TRYING HERE   BUT DEFINITELY LAST !! <EOR> A co worker told check place skeptical because Yardhouse nearby which know always good   Risked telling myself try something new  Very disappointed   ordered Filet when came flashed back elementary school cafeteria   Food came small plastic plate cheap silverware  know bar ale house whatever but verge being upscale     and then fails  Start looking your Yelp reviews guys! SOMETHING WRONG YOUR CHOICE CHEFS MANAGEMENT  Sorry but maybe should dinner drinks Yardhouse see your niche really done well  Next time trust gut  <EOR> Food really good cooked perfection generous portions  waiter really good! Love place wish back home! <EOR> Order burgers medium  When showed almost raw  remake which took another 20 mins  Never again   Maybe should teach your management deal customers better  way don't bad review   Handled very poorly  <EOR> Being Orlando place just happy   sheer consistency atmosphere food pricing drinks always puts smile face   Watching 7 y o house twin lobster tail special other night rather impressive also   Prime rib fantastic  Definitely better casual places eat Town Square  <EOR> Came tonight some friends always everything great  tasty ribeye friend Cajun chicken pasta which very popular other friend seafood mac cheese which looks really good  general manager John even stopped  table say hello  Mariah server she awesome! Great place meet friends good drinks food casual environment! <EOR> They close midnight  Maybe should update business hours both online posted  <EOR> I seriously can't praise place more  three times every time better last  Victor Rachel best servers ever  Highly attentive detail oriented  food awesome big portions price  manager amazing well  only met compliment servers ended getting convo college football  Just overall amazing place  Thank Miller's! <EOR> We watch game disappointed   far best place game!  server George fantastic   He really made experience enjoyable   manager came over think name Jerry see doing which thought very good customer service   We'll definitely back!  Great burgers too! <EOR> One favorite places town  But its awhile since in   After reading some reviews still sure why doesn't better rating  prices some best town!!! games always no matter want put up  outside bar area might 30+ tvs inside probably more  there's always some eye candy  place huge staff friendly food great price drinks more great  never HH but 24 7 $7 pitchers miller products can't drink cheaper anywhere else if light beer  blackened prime rib sandwich fries 9 95 enormous amount food  before always forget big sandwich when sit down  Two pitchers mgd 64 between buddy bill $21 including tip huge sandwich fries pitcher myself  HA! Good luck getting price anywhere else town while still having much fun watching sports  Most pitchers domestic beer strip anywhere between $15 40 if you're lucky  For $$$ best town <EOR> surprised would honor email offer $25 00 per person   always thought good place     <EOR> Saturday lunch disappointed  food dry bland nachos wife burger   thought we'd least some decent beer choose but again disappointed  large selection very average beers no option anything larger pint  Top all off unfriendly service Dominique don't think we'll back  <EOR> Ok maybe based previous reviews expected much   very disappointed food service Miller's  Seems took forever take order   somewhat disappointing selection ales   Nothing local! We Scampi grilled cobia   Both bland   Scampi needed garlic salt cheese I never add salt    cobia did seem fresh bit fishier normal grilled sans any seasoning  All all did live expectations  <EOR> REVIEW STRICTLY BASED 2013 SUPERBOWL PARTY group 20 family friends come Las Vegas annually big game parties  attended Casa Di Amore's annual shindig last 3 Superbowl's but couldn't stomach $175 fee per person year's party  did little research came across Miller's $75 per person real food buffet including fresh seafood prime rib all drink figured couldn't wrong  place packed gills seating very tight which only reason didn't give 5 stars  For future parties might want consider cutting down capacity tad even if price $100 per person  would still beating competition hands down no other Vegas parties category going under $175 per person  food better average everything assorted salads hot dogs wings subs jambalaya poached fish filets sushi crab legs shrimp oysters prime rib carved order  drank entry fee alcohol alone everything assorted bottled beers large selection beers tap wine mixed drinks  only thing included shots but put little ice your Jack Daniel's or Captain Morgan whatever voila! mixed drink! servers attentive point  never less 2 3 drinks front each time  only complaint would other crowdedness is word lol! Patron Margarita   it more super sweet citrusy mix actual alcohol definitely top shelf margarita used to  bloody mary started good sex beach cocktail had  Just stay away margaritas lol! Overall Miller's gained group new fans definitely returning Superbowl 2014! <EOR> This place ok  came friends Friday night packed  But good thing only wait 15 minutes seated  looking over menu two friends decided share Chicken Nachos Appetizers  Chicken Nachos described menu Word   ENORMOUS! Shredded Lettuce Sour Cream Salsa Jalapeno Side  Miller's Alehouse isn't kidding size nachos  portion size definitely large plenty three people share  However size side shredded lettuce sour cream salsa jalapeno did match size nachos leaving want more side less nacho  nachos weren't anything special just corn tortilla chips smothered large chunks salsa covered shredded chicken lots cheese  friend thought nachos would better guacamole add $0 99 chili    If just nachos probably would given Miller's Alehouse 2 5 stars however extra star comes decadent desserts   I tried Capt'n Jacks Buried Treasure Delicious Homemade Ice Cream Cake Oreo Cookie Crust Caramel Chocolate Fudge Heath Bar Crunch  first delicious but then became sugar overload could no longer handle  Thankfully Brownie Hot Fudge Sundae huge chewy walnut brownie swimming sea hot fudge topped two huge scoops vanilla ice cream swirl whipped cream switch up  brownie perfect combination chewy soft mixed hot fudge cold ice cream each bite heaven mouth  desserts plus good service brought place 2 star 3 star rating  <EOR> I've coming Las Vegas years never knew here!!! love Ale House time Florida super excited learn Zingers LV!! Foods great drinks reasonable service good  Nice setup large parties watching games!!! <EOR> Located Town Square next Fry's Staples   This follow review eaten drank drunk Millers many many times probably 40 visits   The food started really good consistently  But over last 3 4 months slowly deteriorated quality  always serve very good sized portions but doesn't bland taste mediocre service   Someone management thinking its good hire guys look unemployed house husbands uhhh bad plan   I met owner when he town they're looking opening another here  If replicate now don't bother  If previous year plus things great   The bar solid great variety good prices  Great social spot plenty things do   This all works but see slipping   I hope tighten crew slipping away  <EOR> I wanted fun lunch colleague heard people talking place being fun    When arrived place packed thought good sign   I ordered burger he ordered cheese steak since going bar food   far worst food ever seen presented  bun burger cold dry patty looked grey come freezer  taste bad presentation   cheese steak looked ugly just slapped together     The best equate cafeteria food  server ok   giving them two stars feel being quite generous  <EOR> Place hang while enjoying beer appetizers enjoy meals  think consistently good  drink specials very good  can't pitcher beer  host Alabama football games  Roll tide! <EOR> I Sunday afternoon promply greeted door friendly server  Looking around noticed place wasn't very crowded but expected Sunday lunchtime  No sooner sat down server came over took drink order  just ordered diet soda which 20oz  well carbonated!   The decor very interesting wall wood panel various mounted fish televisions but ceiling just commercial tile  seemed really strange combination  guess  why noticed it!  For lunch ordered Thai calamari grouper sandwich which special  appetizer came short order pretty good  Thai sauce gave kick overpowered heavy breading which good thing! Soon finishing appetizer grouper sandwich showed up  grilled little fishy smelling  Obviously frozen quite some time because color varied bright white pale transparent cream but still edible  wouldn't order again    All all would probably back but would later evening could down few drinks attempt average food taste better! <EOR> I wanted try something new thought would take wife lunch  hostess seated horrible crappy attitude  waiter wearing dirty shirt looked he just hit pipe  World Famous Zingers!! All say nasty nasty nasty!!!!!! may worst restaurant eaten Las Vegas  lived twenty years cant believe places around  eat place!! should Yardhouse!!! <EOR> Ok first off know am least 8 years older average patron but whatever dude  cheap beer food isn't bad college style bar  outdoor area patio favorite spot just case wanna find <EOR> I've few times lunch well work drinks once company Christmas party   Every time come forget cheap things are   Miller Lite always cold cheap   Food good cheap   always think Miller's Ale House pricey but when look menu reminded inexpensive things are   Especially lunch specials especially meatloaf delicious   would say best deal Town Square!!  Miller's Ale House sold option lunch drinks parties   never disappointed any food   large selection menu items surely something everyone  <EOR> Wow say great food service top off free UFC fight tonight     No cover       Love place       <EOR> Spoiler alert    food amazing  top even take time know you  If you're used being treated well suggest stay away  coming short amount time already feel part team  Very accommodating fun staff  Highly recommend  <EOR> We tried Millers first time pleasantly impressed   food prices similar places chilis but funner variety foods  <EOR> I used come watch game cheap drinks food wouldn't give stray dog streets Seriously really bad food   honestly say never come back place again kicked using curse word bar   Nice way chase away customers letting kids run place  <EOR> Love zingers!!

Oreo's Ice Cream Caramel Sauce      Yummy!  Bottom line Miller's lot would find Las Vegas sport's bar      cheap drinks decent food lot's tv's    Take home message Save room dessert!!! <EOR> A friend decided stop before movie quick dinner  appears Miller's hotspot alot Greek life UNLV  place pretty loud crowded college kids all over bar  didn't mind people but noise pretty obnoxious point  crowd wasn't issue service food   I think server came table total 4 times  Drink orders Food orders Bring food check  fact wave down other servers refills condiments  Usually am forgiving bad service  figure restaurant server maybe having off day things could bad kitchen on  While bad service sucks usually doesn't mean don't back   Bad food other hand totally different story  ordered philly cheesesteak fries  Usually pretty safe bet mean mess philly? Well should asked cook because he did some how  fries soggy microwaved  sandwich itself tasted mushy  bread should crispier meat should juicy  Instead all tasted someone threw together heated real quick  friend burger where center portion beef under cooked actually still cold send back  doubt regular routine Miller's probably because if would shut down violating health codes meat cooking but really hard come back experience   I back drinks which relatively cheap compared rest Town Square but am staying away food  <EOR> Decent food $  Always packed  Great place if really hungry wanna some drinks  Full people never boring  35 shrimp Scampi trick  If bang buck  <EOR> As far am concerned   Miller ale House brand fan no matter location am only diner  Food great portions add value here   Personal favorites Blackened Cajun Chicken pasta Chicken Noodle Soup Pepperoni Flatbread well      <EOR> Great spot catch sports big screen tvs everywhere sit watch!  dinner very busy Friday evening   Service OK server took orders brought food timely fashion but didn't refill drinks quickly   food good ordered fish chips which nice portion size enough share two   Overall atmosphere nice hangout would back happy hour try other food! <EOR> I bar is  Usually friendly service ok food drink specials  Also show ppv ufc fights $10 cover   The crab legs pretty good deal  I haven't tried much else food  prime Rib sandwich ok   They pretty great drink specials  <EOR> I visited establishment several times past usually fairly busy lunch time understand taking few extra minutes your food  However last 3 times times only food slow but service even slower  food best OK when first opened seemed really good over sized portions great prices  Now just seems all getting mediocre food lot's very quickly    I ordered cup soup specialty Zinger Salad waiting 20 plus minutes overheard table next ask server killing lettuce back there? She no just fryers backed making Zingers  5 minutes later stopped server inquired food she gave same answer but she talking another server brought food  did inquire soup she told no worries she'll take off bill thought very generous charge food never received  manager supposed come over table but never happened  never say never going back restaurant but considering dining options Vegas area won't rushing back anytime soon either  <EOR> Mixed feelings place  lobster bisque Friday's only very tasty but sometimes extra thick gravy like  grilled fish usually always good  Thier zingers superb  Better average chicken finger  Drinks cheap  chicken nachos most bland nachos ever eaten  Salads usually fresh crisp  Sometimes patrons loud obnoxious since close touristy areas rather drunk sports bar  Unless order seafood zingers food hit miss  Good but excellent any means  <EOR> Ummmm     cheese burger   wasn't very good   Chunks hard fat tendon inside    Guacamole tasted processed      mom chicken sandwich  She pulled big chunk fat   Ya'll should trim your meat before serving it    Gross   Even cook well    If wasn't ice cream cake would star    ice cream cake pretty good <EOR> I dined several days week past 9 months colleagues daily specials  Food ok service mediocre times  Today waitress accidentally spilled entire glass water me  manager offered pay dry cleaning but comp $5 meal because only water  sure rationale dry cleaning more meal  Certainly treat regular group customers going back  <EOR> Came other night service terrible food just ok  Bartenders don't rather phone talking each other sure your drink filled up  Then expect tip  <EOR> If accept place oughta satisfied  If expecting quality food sadly disappointed    This place where casual beer small meal order watch game  Honestly if aren't watch game can't imagine why anyone right mind would come come here  service mediocre   just enough keep there  mean weren't rude anything just busy  I'd annoyed if deal bunch loud intoxicated people yelling television screens   The steak sandwich generously sized but hardly memorable  bit dry overly salted  fries were  fries  Salty reasonably tasty but nothing special  beer selection somehwat decent    For pay I'd say bad choice  could much worse plenty televisions around enjoy game your choice  fun time  <EOR> Consistently wonderful! Great menu includes lunch dinner specials  Great  large group gathering just meal friend  Clay man's back bar most attentive bartenders  Never glass gone dry without clay checking us  always need keep some room Miller's Captain Jack's Buried Treasure amazing dessert! <EOR> The food good most time is  typical bar typical drinks typical service typical food  Nothing sticks being special although used enjoy 2 $3 PBR deal  decent drink specials  love outdoor patio when let watch game want  Zingers awesome   My biggest complaint something mentioned above   they don't care if you're only person sitting patio area let watch game s want  could 4 other groups would rather watch another game TV but Manager does accomodate group  He would rather say Ohh game case someone wants see it  Well there's no wants see it  understand you're saying but let's take vote something   Everyone patio asking another game   accomodate people   that your first job Manager  spend good money when come your bar  main reason choose elsewhere where turn game want on  <EOR> Nice place drink watch sports  ideal if want quality food  Ribs bone dry barely edible  Crab legs decent plenty them  Prices aren't bad  <EOR> I fact specific vegetarian menu  few times mainly watch UFC it freakishly crowded fights   vegetarian menu ok wrap veggie quesadilla veggie fajitas  Why if food just ok?

Wall wall people thought okay since arrived late could stand front those already seated watch fight caring if blocking someone's view  Unbelievably rude people  am sure if fire marshal ever showed during fights Miller's would fined no way many people should shoved into amount space  Needless say next fight we'll find somewhere else watch comfort own home  <EOR> Only second time both times food excellent  permanent stops while Las Vegas until tired just everything menu  drinks best size portions your bucks  <EOR> I honest keep open mind cause saw yelp average 3 stars  But food ordered tasted good should first foremost  Experience good well  Burgers tasted great wife said shrimp scampi delicious  Despite busy Sat lunch hour service excellent prompt  <EOR> Been coming since moved Vegas 4 years ago  Always great place watch games fights lots tv screens  Pretty sure management changed few times across years staff always changing  new girl called Alexis other day really friendly more attentive other servers experienced recently  back sure!

Yes  <EOR> I really enjoyed service food  seated immediately server extremely nice gave wonderful selections since first time food came fairly quickly hot  checked periodically ensure enjoyed food  awesome beginning end!

On first visit sashimi tuna salad well bowl lobster bisque  salad very disappointing  cucumber wasabi dressing no wasabi bite greens boring sesame seed encrusted tuna just encrusted liking  I similar but far FAR tastier salad Yard House Town Square  The soup good least  Good but great   On second visit decided more simple route basic dinner salad bowl clam chowder  soup best ever couple spoonfuls little gritty but wasn't bad  enjoyed meal much more then first experience    But said simple  would certainly preferred enjoy more expensive salad more      Overall wouldn't back lunch if option  Town Square many other places I'd prefer eat  Perhaps Miller's Alehouse better suited beer drinking sports watching evenings? <EOR> I say   I am fan Miller's Alehouse   But only fan since great place catch game there's enough selection everyone menu   When most places watch game you're stuck your usual bar type food   Miller's all fried foods burgers nachos if  your thing   However Miller's also other options fajitas soups salads steak   Even though known super sized nachos didn't partake any during most recent visit   before pretty damn good   They're perfect share group if you're counting your calories  ended bowl chili steak chicken fajita combo   Both meals decent nothing spectacular   But still giving Miller's Alehouse 4 stars because see myself coming back day watch game     YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 499 500 <EOR> Food solid service speedy   Drinks come right away which want when hit bar   occasional work spot some work Town Square love convenience   haven't lunch yet I'd tempted order 20 oz  beer which wouldn't wise afternoon work ahead but hear specials really good deal maybe test willpower days try Noon   Always busy here  <EOR> Probably more 3 5 stars   friend Thursday night grab drink catch up   split combo appetizer which fried crab mozzarella fried mozzarella fried conch fritters noticing theme? spinach artichoke dip   Everything pretty standard nothing very exciting exception crab mozzarella   thought really good     We some really strong Vodka sodas which server kindly persuaded doubles better deal   service really good whole place just nice vibe   nice change Blue Martini which where normally end up   Blue Martini having some sort private party whomever hosting party not anyone worked BM don't think incredibly rude!  gave business spot   If you're looking good chill sports bar would recommend place  <EOR> After more year curiosity tried place first time last week  big playoff game figured good time any  If sports great place watch game! While restaurant sports bar atmosphere SMOKY ALL NO SMOKING ALLOWED inside  saw lots families dining a ok place bring kids if 'em   I did love atmosphere here  servers all wear team jerseys least day visit  football but when watching live game surrounded hoards cheering fans hard into spirit things  husband other hand super happy able keep eyes glued game  place tons televisions everywhere look everybody great view  There's even live coverage speakers restrooms  if someone your party loves sports take them because if don't sports still eat drink fun time   Unfortunately sports bar atmosphere only thing place going it  chicken zingers  chicken zingers really fresh tasty worth $10 price tag  very thin breast meat chicken strips breaded fried before being tossed your choice inventive sauces  give Miller's Ale House things good    The service food abysmal  awkward server just well BIZARRE  told first time he started almost arguing saying he knew he seen before  Um okay dude swear first time here  He also hovered around booth point where started uncomfortable silences  some questions menu he answered them gave way much information down point where he said don't many complaints but stay away fish sick mushrooms etc  WTF?  After tremendous vote confidence decided something safe sports bar style restaurant  bacon cheeseburger  Hubby did same  Wow way off! burgers terrible! took bite said bad version Carl's Jr 's six dollar burger  More meatloaf overdone piece ground beef just plain bad  Both burgers overcooked flavorless obviously comprised very poor quality ingredients  opted veggies side instead fries brought ho hum frozen green beans  obvious afterthought flavorless  Hubby side salad snuck bite  both agreed good  If ever dine again think I'd order salad topped chicken zingers   We wait forever refills check  place packed but even when empty server bad  restaurant itself huge ample seating both indoors outside  nice outdoor patio fire pits  bar area huge but some tables long tall you'll sit stool share strangers  dining area nice big wooden booths but there's no padding which means massive amount butt hurt if sit more hour    I'm really fan place  might decide give another try future but any hurry return  <EOR> I visiting town  Watched UFC last night absolutely packed   should charged cover but didn't   stood first few fights when private patio opened manager let first choice seats couch last three fights    Despite crowd waitress security very professional kept drinks flowing   Despite way over capacity waitresses kept smiling whole night  seriously think bouncers joint hardest scariest job Vegas night  lot very big scary looking dudes bar night but bouncers kept smiling made sure all good safe   Nothing spectacular abut bar really 3 star bar but professionalism staff such crazy nigh made 4 star  <EOR> We large group stopped here  some appetizers good but burger ordered well done while asked medium  most disappointing things service  Once finally appetizers hour before flagged down waitress asked if could order meals  She seemed surprised wanted order something  Overall 2 hour 15 minute meal  addition several drink orders wrong   Again realize large group 18 us but lack attentiveness mistakes orders hard overlook  <EOR> Very clean lot's TV's great service during May Pac Fight! <EOR> Very surprised! gigantic restaurant usually large restaurants hand hand slow service mediocre food but restaurant different! food excellent service great tons beer tap atmosphere nice   back sure  <EOR> Plenty good time here  Miller Ale House situated Town Centre shopping entertainment complex   This place tight sports bar great food lunch dinner boot  Ale house all your draft bottle needs decent range 50 90 beers time   I recommend wings while watching some hockey basketball  use moose drool beer which jam but unfortunately took off menu   The service always decent beer cold  don't any real complaints other location kinda caters tourist market if opened Summerlin somewhere would awesome local hang spot sure <EOR> This place great kids Tuesday kids eat free!
