She adorable demeanor candid personality set ease  lucky she took jump  Everyone encountered checking paying getting harnessed into world most unflattering jumpsuit jump itself amazing   I think would more scared jump personalities customer service staff sub par  set ease made feel safe   It great experience would back again next visit  defiantly glad did night though because cannot imagine hot would suit little cage room area top level where jump    Avoid heat night  Besides lights jump whole lot easier stomach! <EOR> Ended staying Stratosphere first glance jumpers looked quite insane  When you're ground jump platform looks tiny rectangle ridiculously high air  people barely visible when first jump    After watching them both outside TV all weekend figured hell what's 855 foot jump off 108th floor right? paid fee suited up  Everyone very professional through whole process harness checked several times multiple different people  Really scariest part whole thing think waiting top line enter glass fishbowl room connected jump platform  number people bar asking if you're scared while others just kind shaking heads if say yikes    Like other reviews already said walk edge put your toes over ledge grab rails hook up  really notice hot wind blowing around standing for feels eternity   then asked lean forward bit which easy because line connected some tension pulling the staff help hold place   followed super fast 321 countdown let then let go   A split second release oh sh*t did just moment  matters because you're pretty much committed point  initial moment its smooth sailing all way down over way fast  touchdown pad very soft springy   I did 1am jump skyline hot summer breeze really nice  Next time may try during day  would say overall am terrified heights but Im really excited them either  much easier if don't look down when platform just look strip when count down don't think just do   If you're town think way when hell ever going chance something again? really nice adrenaline rush its very exciting especially if never done something before    Would recommend others absolutely! Would ride again bet! Will buy any extras besides jump next time naw <EOR> Some people Vegas sin others food first visit opted straight adrenaline!!  I've pretty much all over country best rollercoasters attractions   rides top Stratosphere tower always bit mystery allure them because height view       When stumbled across new addition tower knew least give serious consideration    am all guy wont walk talk cute girl don't know but  somehow muster courage step off 3 ft  ledge nearly 900 feet high sky!!    Almost 85 percent $100 dollars pay thrill happens completely your mind     moment arrive Stratosphere attraction viewable front tower all way down South view strip     ultra high tower taunts squint barely making confetti sized blue deck step off almost 900 feet high sky     If wait around long enough watch other jumpers descent few times talk yourself doing attraction   Earlier day took ride Paris Hotel Eiffel tower its observation deck which mere 500 feet high     Knowing heading toward Sky Jump freaked when realized nearly 400 feet higher    Damn 500 feet those cars look giant army ants   What's view going when toes hanging over edge only way ground down?  Whats extra 300 400 feet? Eventually scheduled time mental torture came time suit up    suit space located just inside where actual jumpers finish descent land While psyching yourself jump least slightly relieved see everyone comes back alive big grin face     friend photographer document whole experience pale ghost    just wondering if would freak when placed ledge nearly 900 feet off ground   Once take ride still give but your getting your money back time man just it      actually watch riders harnesses checked rechecked rechecked again   led launch deck strapped harness then once wires rewind given chance enjoy view quick minute instructed countdown step off lean forward   inside viewing deck see them fall off then disappear side rapidly       At point just whatever no time back now   happily volunteered among three flight buddies rode first       ready fly baby!!    view ledge freaking spectacular    jump just sun disappearing behind horizon completely unobstructed view Las Vegas no photo match place experience    operators basically place half your feet off ledge lean forward while holding railing sides behind you   very awkward feeling     3 2 1 leaned forward let off    wind face ground way down below won mental battle    Due way harness holds recommend once jumping try  pitch yourself forward while falling fall more flat until start slow down    simulates feel actual base jump little bit more closely       As others pointed its actual freefall but somewhere between base jump controlled stunt jump   real ride happens your head all way just right point stepping off ledge   would again free would definitely pay if allowed freefall  along wire bit skycoaster experience   If your looking something unique catch view Vegas very many people experience definitely consider Sky Jump attraction       purchased dvd but skipped photos    which major ripoff    dvd could also sound if really wanted worth pay attraction   just silent video while camera follows off ledge down adjacent wires       I am definitely happy did did back down   would regretted coming back Miami having conquered mental fear tiny ledge step away toward your blissful descent   top notch unique experience all way around!!  Highly Recommended!!! <EOR> Went Vegas bachelor party! excited bachelor jump off stratosphere took cab strat check out  Upon arrival asked where sky jump could buy tickets directed lounge free trip top  top directed back bottom buy tickets  being told reservation only made reservation hour later  bar kill some time  reservation neared back sky jump offices  waited waited waited  40 minutes reservation time asked staff member named Ocean holdup running 40 minutes behind when made reservation less 2 hours previous! She looked eye told nothing she could she didn't care because she quitting right away  really attitude want staff trusting lives with   I spoke lady identified herself manager asked refund explaining staff disrespectful rude downright dangerous environment  refund left  never back would caution anyone considers riding sky jump whether comfortable putting life hands kids really don't care  <EOR> Really great customer service Once lifetime experience  Surreal through worth all It's leap faith when standing edge thinking yourself doing yourself being bravest be   Many people compare zip lining extremely inaccurate! Getting yellow ling top right edge having momentum jump off realize nothing compare  When first jump off instantly feel shocked did surreal life changing!  If compare would much close bungee jumping skydiving airplane    **Would awesome shirt included all packages pro since most expensive would great accessory!  Cons 1  allowed take photos others your group top tower before jump off  2  Feel rushed when land enough time between take photos take everything all in <EOR>
