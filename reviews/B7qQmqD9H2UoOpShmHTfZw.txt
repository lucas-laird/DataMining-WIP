First off didn't open close sign hesitant car first but then decided pull door find indeed opened  first steps into restaurant pretty awkward no working behind counter while someone seems owner manager finally came over helped me  Eventually workers came help me  But things awkward again owner manager stood yelling worker whole time    I just don't understand why can't behind closed doors least customer leaves   Customer service aside food worth it  poke bowls preset create your own  offer fresh toppings your poke  pretty great  What's greatest quality fish which most important component poke bowl  addition stingy portion  small medium large all seem same amount regardless say made same size bowl  definitely place great grab poke but if you're looking quality authentic poke I'd try somewhere else  <EOR> This place really excellent  only tried poke twice before tell quantity quality fish give exceptional  medium Passion Soul Bowl both ahi poke salmon flavorful fresh delicious  interior restaurant cute clean workers super friendly helpful  back sure! <EOR> This place promising   but  Pros Fish actually fresh delicious chose own bowl toppings  know bowl great but friend preset bowls she didn't all  Hmm   Cons expensive portions small  Quite stingy fish  I'm little uncomfortable fish just sitting containers without even lid ice   The guy serving didn't gloves just didn't seem hygienic  mean raw fish want upmost cleanliness appetite door!  Side note  bowls called Buddha Bowl  Really?

Why both? Soba healthier alternative  Lower sugar content compared  starchy white rice noodles  Seriously GF trend hand   They rid other toppings well  Thing signage posted  wall website changed  sure if employees feeding BS   If known would've steered friends another place  primarily cause wanted soba noodles base  Consumers warned  <EOR> Came when first opened used groupon just ok  Came couple other times without groupon felt price isn't worth paying amount they pay extra poke bowl basics i e  Seaweed salad masago   Also fish doesn't taste fresh other poke places  would drive See Roll Rainbow  Trust me! <EOR> I cannot wait until open two other forthcoming locations poke place pretty far settle weekly visits  Prices good fish fresh everything customizable healthy indulgent want   The menu handful set bowls Passion Buddha bowl options solid $11 ea option DIY preference being greens quinoa base mix ahi salmon protein mix add ons but always include avocado no extra charge!   spicy garlic sauce bright green color but doesn't wasabi flavor thankfully   If could suggestion would reorder line select your fish mixed sauces veggies onion cucumber etc marinate minute while base bowl being assembled  better flavor places CA way such Poke Bowl San Jose  now just ask extra soy sauce add bowls bit dry    Service fairly good if you're group keep eye your bowl doesn't mixed someone else's accident  medium size $10 perfect portion  Location same plaza Crepe Expectations Gluten Zero bakery signage bit difficult spot street  <EOR> This place waste money time    Came once lunch yoga practice never again  asked employee if should small medium poke bowl he told if super hungry but want something fill small but if really hungry medium  sizes small medium large according many scoops protein small scoop medium two scoops fish    I pretty hungry love poke lot chose medium  agree other reviewers skimp fish toppings  guy literally gave less ten pieces ahi tuna  don't understand medium size more extra small me  fish quality isn't good compared Island Flavor down street Soho SushiBurrito Sahara I 15  toppings ask guy three times decent amount seaweed salad bowl   The only things DON'T skimp rice sauces  hate places where give mostly rice drown sauce  When finished all small amount ahi tuna guy gave throw rest bowl away because couldn't stand just eating rice drenched sauce  Forgot mention when paying cash register employee told feel free ask any more sauce there's no extra charge sauce  Why would want more sauce if filled whole bowl mostly rice sauce ??  An hour meal still hungry spent over 10$ + tax meal left dissatisfied ended eating more food anyways when home  tiny don't know medium even large even satisfy average person  Didn't even take photo poke bowl post because wouldn't look good Yelp account aesthetic  Friendly service but food portion price pay definitely worth it  <EOR> Great new poke joint neighborhood  twice already exceptional experience both visits  employees friendly helpful navigating build your own bowl concept menu  If you're looking healthy fresh fish options recommend stopping into Soulfish especially refreshing lunch during hot Vegas summer days  <EOR> Clean fresh lot choices add ins  simply irresistible good deal  <EOR> Fresh fish driven Santa Monica every day amazing friendly people  Highly recommended! <EOR> This place amazing!!! love poke waiting place this  Finally healthy poke spot  quick easy  read smaller portions but just raised protein portions now bowls very filling! back everyday! <EOR> Well food filled didn't kill but  it  wanted place but just can't many better options around  fish fresh but think must previously frozen something mean all fish sent frozen some degree but was   let's say sushi grade  sauce toppings okay but nothing write home about  Portions good!

Food poke itself meh difficult compete when island sushi right poke fresh flavorful  wouldn't even call poke because just squares raw fish no type seasoning  quite few toppings choose sound good individually but when combined didn't give any wow factor  sauce creamy wasabi which ok but needed flavor decent squirt sriracha  bowl looked tasted quite ordinary    Service guy behind counter bit overzealous unclear when asked process ordering  When sat down different guy taken over welcomed customers Welcome Soul food 3 times lmao     kinda sad   Overall can't see myself coming back when Poke express great poke AYCE sushi places all around sushi burritos taking over Vegas  <EOR> I ordered two small bowls plenty  girl gave plenty fish which nice  loved all sauces  liked variety toppings well  tasty worth try  <EOR> Been several times which would've given 5 stars all those times  Today much  Several things marked off menu because they're stock   including noodles  only guy working both food register  waiting yes writing line behind four women obviously new concept   intersection light turn 5 rounds without turning green  Bottom line if come today Wednesday December 28 don't come if pressed time expecting soba salmon    Food always good just today normal  <EOR> Love concept hate food  twice choked down really bland 'zen' bowl  second time fish warm cut into huge chunks  couldn't even stomach it  Warm fish??? <EOR> The lady behind counter executive chef chain   Rather mumble off ingredients bowls she let give paper made bowls to order   definitely back! <EOR> Very cool concept  Lots choices  Healthy great addition part town  sushi bowl yum! <EOR> This first time ordering soulfish  did create your own bowl  ordered spicy tuna white rice assorted toppings spicy mayo sauce  Overall good  nice quality fish fresh veggies  thing would say downer portions  example ordered cucumber seaweed few piece cucumber but felt heap seaweed almost overwhelming  just ended pulling off some seaweed wasn't much but overall enjoyed bowl sauce just enough spice  <EOR> After going another poke place didn't meet standards Soulfish Poke did easily  menu ordering clear simple    MENU For base offer carbs rice soba noodles a plus salad  protein offer yellowfin salmon octopus tuna couple more options  sauce great variety  then toppings   FOOD QUALITY I ordered soba noodles three scoops two salmon yellowfin big scoops!! mixed soul garlic sauce which yum  topped off some green onions avocado seaweed jalapeños  Everything tasted amazing together fish tastes fresh    PRICE Small 8 50 medium 10 00 large 11 50  groupon deal paid $3    ENVIRONMENT great lunch spot to go    Overall I'd come back can't wait location Warm Springs open up  <EOR> This place yummy!
