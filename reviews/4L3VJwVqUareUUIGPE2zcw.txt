Followed some Masala Tea cap off  MMMMMM nothing better Vegas   The prices very reasonable  can't wait back more  <EOR> This probably worse experience ever Pakistani Indian restaurant  person running front  He didn't speak English  lost hour call three more times because just did understand word he said  only picked 'food maxx' two different ones until found it   Ordering any easier  just werent able communicate properly  food wasn't bad but defiantly could better  no complementary chutney tea anything  asked some brought then when receiving reciept realized charged literally everything  guy even miscounted tea charged more had  asked some water  guy told ourselves  sister told he's waiter he's supposed bring water  He laughed inside brought water  guy gave hard time everything asked until just ourselves things such napkins  even items menu didn't have It just bad experience all together  Definitely don't recommend anyone  <EOR> I lean more toward 3 5 5 but  option   The food very tasty here  three times goat curry lamb entree chicken tikka masala  first two excellent but chicken masala bit dry  meats lean tasty sauces seem composed particular care  feel somehow authentic rather generic    Both rice naan also very good rice particular generously portioned    Prices $2 less standard Indian food quality  I'm comparing Shalimar only Indian rather Pakistani restaurants because little experience latter    The big downside decor which terrible  starts outside most inelegant marquee style sign remember seeing outside good restaurant  interior uniformly dull cheap tables plastic tablecloths bland Western landscape art walls no relation ethnicity cuisine  reminded dentist's office upscale one  Another reviewer compared laundromat   lack style even extends menus themselves   The restaurant operated family seem quite appreciative friendly toward customers unlike most Indian restaurants where service rather chilly    I think thorough interior remodel Shalimar would equivalent fairly upscale Indian restaurant  <EOR> I'm giving place five stars food!  truly excellent Pakistani cuisine   prices great for example several $5 95 veg entrees    party four ordered chicken tikka masala spicy thick gravy cleaned up!  dal masala differently made ever lentils whole instead pureed   made very nice texture plus flavor gooood!   also ordered eggplant mixed veg dish both hearty chunks vegetable nicely spiced   Oh garlic naan hard stop eating!   think family owned place but didn't feel much love anyone    decor place really simple drab but clean    But if just close your eyes concentrate food think you'll masala heaven!

only complaint EVERYTHING ala carte and seems new standard practice Indian restaurants WTF?! ! Even portions still well worth price  usually Chicken Tikka Masala basmati rice garlic naan which comes just little over $15 perfect amount two people  Oh five types naan bread mostly $2 50 range  <EOR> Sketchy place Sketchy food over charge food sure check your bills! ! When order chicken sure chicken because you'll find random bones owners don't own actions  Instead sorry bullshit tell chicken when isn't its bones God knows kind meat   won't coming again supporting people clearly don't know wtf customer service don't own actions  <EOR> Delicious Indian Pakistani food!

Suggestion serve water bottles ice bucket sell bucket refills half price  You already made money back 24 pack next door sold first two bottles right? keep them same price just least keep them cold keep them coming   The naan soft sort usually gaga over but both enjoyed it  found pleasantly chewy without chewiness going beyond reason   Rice does come dishes choose want separately  shared Shalimar Chawal $2 50  Mike liked but thought tasted plain rice no smell even basic and heavenly Basmati fragrance  pile though   After ordered realized weren't asked would dishes mild medium hot  paneer masala medium heat which luckily but sauce lacked subtlety  felt chilis little harsh against other spices instead layers tastes just general sense tomatoes + unspecified spice + heat  price maybe  okay  Then again still seemed little below par buffet sauces   The paneer itself nice  keep riding quibble horse think should pieces little smaller  Sure just chop them your fork but then don't all those nice cooked edges taste little dry  And then fancy math figure if okay ration sip Kroger water  My husband's review mentions condiments served papad came squeeze bottles  also uploaded photo this  He couldn't identify white ish but think watered down raita  definitely whiff cucumber it  bad shirt washer moment I'd give another sniff  Yes both brown ish stuff other bottle probably tamarind? very watery  gave trying little well plate tried squeezing onto papad dressing hot dog  now know why doing laundry Saturday night  D'oh!  Pros Slightly cheaper prices other places nice people   Cons Largely unremarkable food slightly sad and slightly smelly atmosphere warmish water woes   To go boxes available but decided leave leftovers even naan  Perhaps Shalimar some stand out dish sets them apart but since those two dollars didn't spend second round water think next time we'll pay little more better experience elsewhere  <EOR> Amazing Pakistani food  Best chicken kabob ever eaten life! careful its spicy  <EOR> Really good food delicious lamb buryani best authentic pakistani food las vegas affordable menu tried mango lassi different definetly back again  <EOR> Had goat biryani chicken tikka karahi  say both tasteless  Both seemed old taken refrigerator warmed microwave  Serving portions small  customers waiting more 35 mins food   Not recommended   <EOR> I keep trying convince myself place appealing because sometimes food great  But current environs grimy crusty damn bathroom kind gross  Just good dining experience  your food if choose eat it  energy place depressing contractor grade fluorescent lights only accentuate details night   Some dishes excellent still Eggplant Masala Mili Juli Mixed Vegetable Curry Yellow Dal Chicken Tikka Masala  <EOR> For authenticity flavor value place can't beat  atmosphere very plain but if want treat your taste buds eat here  Very sparse ambiance but food worth it  <EOR> My Indian friend insisted taking mutual friend some authentic Indian food dinner night     He ordered everything us goat biryani goat karahi chicken tikka masala naan mango lassi x3    personally enjoy eating goat because find tough times gamey wasn't looking forward meal!
