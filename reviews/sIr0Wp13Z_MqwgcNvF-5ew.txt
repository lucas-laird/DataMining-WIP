Those people smoking crack  Nobody uses living social groupon deserves food good those reviewers seriously need step game too  left 20% tip should you  <EOR> Save your dough mention time somewhere else  place wasn't even quarter full waited least 30 minutes over cooked over priced burgers  chomping some antacids write cause $40 burger giving indigestion sad  <EOR> I star menu kobe burger brioche bun truffle aioli seared foie gras frizzled onion watercress cherry tomatoes fried quail egg  Despite all those toppings brought burger completely flavorless sadly disappointing  meat its own no seasoning all just lost burger  patty formed well size bun way narrow thick  also quite dry despite mess grease formed plate early on  maybe  where all moisture went? also cooked more medium rare ordered which heard many times prior meal consistent problem here  brioche bun also dry actually cold touch when brought out  foie gras non existent except maybe two bites quail egg wasn't noticed any point  cherry tomatoes only stand flavor travesty when girlfriend accidentally dropped when handed burger sample its dryness  quite sure frizzled onion weren't noticeable either    The fries even more horrible raw soggy cold taste raw potatoes  fat fries actually fairly hot upon arrival even cooked bit more skinny fries but still nearly enough them edible  skinny fries parmesan literally just fries huge clump shredded parmesan piled on  Also neither accompanying aioli brought initially only small cup ketchup  ask items supposed come fries issue also saw couple times comment book handed bill  garlic aioli a redundant statement tasted more ranch anything truffle aioli decent enough mask raw potato flavor but still wasn't great   If meal couldn't any worse let tell Groupon deal which total scheme part restaurant  deal $49 supposedly $100 worth food includes two burgers sides shared dessert bottle wine  Once meal done Groupon scanned still brought check $25 84 which instantly confusing  check list $99 not $100 Groupon meal sales tax full $99 amount 18% !!! gratuity bringing total $124 84  then subtract $99 value Groupon not $100 expect $25 84 complete meal  First all doing some research found some specific tax laws such as if restaurant offers patron upon presentation coupon two meals usual price price free meal excluded meal's tax  tax due only actual amount restaurant charges patron  Meaning they've charged more tax they're legally allowed to! Second all no problem tipping waiter entire value meal opposed Groupon price but forcing pay 18% minimum two people regardless experience absolutely absurd  gratuity 100% optional all meals sure would total dick move tip waiter especially if they've great but mandatory portion bill absolutely infuriating  without any choice own $49 Groupon default $74 84 clever way restaurant another $25 each Groupon deal  knows much 18% actually waiter   With all being said even sum up? Forgetting Groupon minute if paid full price $100 meal would horribly disappointed would walked until both burgers fries replaced absolutely perfect versions ordered if possible achieving   If paid just $49 plus tip deemed appropriate would still completely disappointed meal such claimed gourmet restaurant should spot every time clearly wasn't  But now factor some questionable charges bill all ingredients very low score  Horribly overpriced overcooked inconsistent burgers almost raw inedible fries served without proper sides leave no choice but give extremely low score highest recommendation stay far away place until maybe act together  If you're looking good night Summerlin some fun food better atmosphere best burgers Vegas View Wine Bar down street  <EOR> Soggy bun Overcooked patty Frozen fries Terrible service   probably worst lunch ever had   Seriously better burger McDonalds  <EOR> Giving star star many  horrible place  Food ok but clearly over priced  Walked sat long bench table which very uncomfortable  Observed owners kids chefs kids running kitchen area while food being prepared  Pretty sure health code violation  pay dinner told credit debit machine working  waiter told could pay next time come in    really type service think coming back  chance  Clearly should read others posted before attempting place   Zero atmosphere     considering glass advertisement said hip cool waiters   Guess all quit!
