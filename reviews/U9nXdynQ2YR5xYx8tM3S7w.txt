Outside very friendly staff generally clean establishment  ordered nachos ok  Nothing brag any means  Just ok  I'd probably visit location again whim but  it  Overall good experience  <EOR> Nice place  bit slow service  server very friendly  ordered BBQ boneless wings 12 25 those average amount time come which good ordered because rest food gonna pretty slow come  took while even take drinks     Ordered Wingmans burger  Which myself but told meat kind burnt outside  Excessively burnt  Still she enjoyed wings but said cream waaay salty    I ordered BBQ bacon burger  Which also bit burnt but don't think much wingman  enjoyed good though  remembered late wanted cheddar cheese  Lol okay    The manager however helping servers some them very attentive  But next time ill send burnt something back  <EOR> I surprised when saw tgif bad rating  see staff always vey kind here   times wait couple long minutes food but only when short staffed  manager great  She always asking everybody food was  many times see passing plates herself  Great job!
