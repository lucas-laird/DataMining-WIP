Last time came free show three homeles people fighting front  Also few cockroaches  But place always open   there's that  <EOR> The food great place  many other Roberto's but best one  Food always tastes good fresh  keep eating location <EOR> As recent mover LV very happy Robertos just San Diego  Breakfast burrito great expected  little pricier San Diego but same good food!! <EOR> Recently moved California safe say love Mexican food place right around corner house decided try around midnight long night work wasn't disappointed fast we'll priced definitely repeat customer <EOR> This place only considered good because bad you  wouldn't eat due fact all restaurants use lard EVERYTHING  all extremely greasy occasion food would would overdone salty  Its very cheap place food experience reflected that  Every time eat run toilet  much better mexican food doesn't use lard  actually tastes its cooked perfectly  only good thing place price  maybe carne asada fries  <EOR> THIS PLACE GOOD  definitely coming back  OVER OVER   It's each ingredient your order great its own  Then when combine them into your food BOMB  Try out  All reviews aren't getting wrong!  But caveat Although franchise issue should fix gentleman counter said true problem CONSISTENCY   That all Roberto's Taco Shops foods made same  SPECIFIC location's food good different way all others  prepare food differently location location   This Roberto's GREAT! Five Stars! <EOR> This Roberto's many but mine!!! many Roberto's yea menu same but far best!! feel welcomed but just order eat leave but lush humor hospitality!! tweak order if ask half chicken half carneasada chimichanga!! Don't small inside but guessing old ones  Only downfall bad area city connected PT's  Wouldn't recommend late night visit!! But if suns see if better your local Roberto's!!! <EOR> Had tacos couple times during stay Vegas  location super convenient base  tacos aren't best Vegas but pretty damned good  service nice lady even remembered couple days later probably something white boy ordering tongue  would definitely give place any o locations chance if your hungry some good authentic Mexican grub  <EOR> Tasty very reasonably priced Mexican food  Just back 3yr tour UK sure without saying   you can't find any decent Mexican food there! finding Roberto's great! only done takeout always friendly quick  <EOR>
