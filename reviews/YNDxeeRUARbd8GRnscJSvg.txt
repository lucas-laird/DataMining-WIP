Water filled but rather infrequently several times left without water least 15 minutes  Empty plates picked time? What? Why would pick only run back kitchen? Waiting them complete bill transaction took seemed decade  Perhaps fact big group total bill being over $600 meant getting big tip regardless but nonetheless disappointing    Onto food! Food prices may seem reasonable classy Italian restaurant but portions represent no value  Four cheese ravioli came FOUR ravioli good lord even satisfied FOUR pieces ravioli especially $26  Maybe if caused orgasms your mouth then could justified but did not  Shrimp Scallop Risotto $29 better value just enough protein but unfortunately shrimp overcooked oh well  least served free Italian bread oil vinaigrette    Will probably pass Panevino future sorry  <EOR> Panevino Deli good place quick bite casual lunch  cute cafe style Deli free wifi  offer 22 different varieties fresh salads 21 different varieties sandwiches  order salads sandwiches half portion  also daily special hot dishes deserts    I enjoyed both meaty prosciutto + salami + capiolla caprese sandwiches  However mixed berry cake bit sour me  small plastic bottle S  Pellegrino water selling $4  sounded bit higher when saw $5 per half portion sandwich receipt latte only selling $4 50 here!?
