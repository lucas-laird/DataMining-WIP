Classy restaurant  <EOR> Food good  movies  Last minute idea  Didn't smell smoke casino dinning room  Nice dining room old school feel  server very polite   Food good  expecting but lot flavor  Ordered roasted chicken seafood pasta  <EOR> I Salvatore's quite frequently enjoy restaurant including ambience piano player background  Chicken Parmigiana best Las Vegas opinion However recently celebrate relative's birthday  brought cake celebrate birthday  Salvatore's charged $3 75 per person serve cake  regular customer deeply offended think ridiculous Yelp diners should aware charge  restaurant but won't going celebrate family event  <EOR> Went tonight celebrate sister's birthday  Party four some food very good but some below par  really ruined evening though terrible service  ask everything least twice  Asked more butter didn't come ask again  Same thing ice tea  supposed bring complimentary desert sister's birthday never happened! Wanted some leftovers boxed box but other ask probably already put meatball trash!! left decent 20% tip now sorry did  Don't people realize ruin special occasion? Its sad! <EOR> Fabulous place Valentines Day  Table 8 everyone loved entree  Big shout Billy waiter  He handled difficult group ease great service humor  Altogether memorable experience  <EOR> My wife every other week  pricing reasonable casino food good  service always great  pianist most nights adds atmosphere  Some just sit piano drink  old school Italian feel  Added bonus Wine half price Wednesdays  <EOR> This place alway good  Service always fantastic very helpful friendly! Talk old school Italian vibe  far best Italian restaurant inside casino not  Also don't charge arm leg meal actually full off of  usual bring own wine no problem  Small cork fee    This last visit Father's Day no different  fresh bread table always tasty before during meal  caprese salad classic fresh ingredients great cheese    Calamari delicious cooked perfect  lobster bisque looked good told best he ever had  sea bass special most perfectly cooked pieces fish eaten restaurant  wife's surf n turf cooked perfect tasted great  always back when feel eating Italian food taste good  cheesecake best ever had  Salvatore's cafe !! <EOR> We gone movie Sun Coast  plan dinner movie  However because rained hard earlier yes really does rain Vegas decided stay hotel dinner  Based some good reviews Yelp decided give Salvatore's try  Walking distinct feeling old school Italian restaurant  pianist playing Sinatra tune when walked in  servers all wearing white shirts black vests  server Lisa came table immediately take drink orders  She also quite helpful answering questions menu  elected spaghetti sausage  spaghetti came very tasty red sauce  portion quite generous  Overall dish good although great  wife chose ribeye special  cooked exactly she ordered  However quite chewy she put Heimlich material  While service 4 star food rating brought down 3 star rating  $30 head think try other restaurants hotel before going back Salvatore's  <EOR> This Fav Italian restaurant town  Starting aps all way through dessert! First off start cozy bar  Tami best before dinner drink always served friendly smile feel happy Salvatores  I've coming very beginning always very pleased friendly efficient service fantastic mouth watering food! Don't forget end your amazing meal creme brule' espresso!! Just best <EOR> We recently moved close Sun Coast trying all food venues   arrived Salvatores opening asked if reservation   told them no made wait must waited 15 minutes place empty   finally seated middle restaurant older guy waiter think he italian   eventually water ask bread eventually able place order   order Fettuccine Toscano salad   salad half covered dressing ask more pasta just ok   half way through fetticcine found small band aid food   alerted waiter he immediately pulled flashlight pocket grabbed fork started sifting through dish   He then said ill give free desert   told didnt want desert   He then took off plate   He brought bill told he took glasses wine off bill   offered something else eat even apology   wont eating again thats sure   other restaurants when something happens chef comes along restaurant manager left hands discretion waiter  <EOR> Better average  but tad over priced got   rediculously priced but somewhat inflated   Overall another classic 3 5 stars if review   I say place does supposed casino   isn't cafe   isn't bad even mundane   bit more upscale live piano bar going wasn't pretentious place   grilled halibut pretty darn good   No oily taste cooked perfectly thoroughly without being tough   delivered but didn't necessarily blow away  <EOR> Might worst Italian food ever!  Seafood obviously frozen tastes pond smells summer  Don't waste your money  Overpriced less average food  Way little balsamic bruschetta way much vinegar salad dressing  casino should just comp meals drunk customers don't care! <EOR> This place best lobster  bisque   try     bread nice fresh  Good service tiramisu nice light  great flavor reasonable  prices <EOR> Dont know why place getting such bad reviews ive going years say place phenomenal favorite italian restaurants summerlin bread always soft delicious servers nice friendly! even started food! chicken parm die for! atmosphere beautiful dim lighting live music really class joint <EOR> I dinner Wednesday nite 11 9 11   place very nice but casual   dining area nice enough but pretty small crappy looking bar area   Really bad opinion nice restaurant   food mediocre best   three dinner companions agreed me   seafood special another person pasta special osso bucco which another special night   followers post know osso bucco all time favorite meal whenever see menu where am dining it   must tell good but outstanding   served over fettuccine noodles which way but sauce gravy very flavorful meat dry   portion nice size but shank sauce mediocre best      I took two bottles $130 wines drink since looked wine list ahead time did any decent wines  another deficiency if ask me   nice higher end Italian restaurant decent wines select from?  did any decent scotches  either   wanted scotch before dinner but only mediocre standard scotches no higher end aged scotches   Again WTF???  when waiter noticed displeasure crappy selection scotches he asked looking for   told any high end stuff least single malt minimum age level 18 years preferably 25 years   He said he something very special if wanted try it   ASSUMING A HOLE knew he talking said sure bring me   he brings shot neat big wide stemless Cabernet glass   start drink nice but did taste scotch   moment mind tells cognac call idiot waiter over he agrees   Before start chastise host casino boss interrupts tells forget he handle problem later   Now think kind problem significant only customer service perspective but also economic perspective  both customer's casino's point view   Especially since shot Louis XIII cognac $160 shot   Lucky paying because would super pissed if was   So although snafu part displeasure establishment rating primarily based upon mediocre food crappy bar area crappy selection cocktails  <EOR> Another Suncoast staple frequent rotation repertoire folks pals since Via Veneto years ago  Italian food pretty good usually fish special always satisfied    Service great Maitre D seems know everyone wait staff friendly courteous bus staff clear plates keep waters filled timely fashion  Just pleasant experience reasonable price point    It gets busy early Sun City crowd reservations aren't bad idea  There's crooning piano player quite entertaining bar nice Dirty Belvedere Martini wine selection good Mayors Carolyn Oscar Goodman frequently spotted and applauded dining here    They aren't breaking any new culinary ground but aren't breaking bank either  definitely fans <EOR> We Thanksgiving dinner  extremely disappointed  Food mediocre best  Service par either  asked waitress extra dressing salad she rolled eyes look annoyance  waiter asked if wanted another glass wine totally ignored son's empty glass    turkey tasted pressed turkey  Yams over cooked tasteless  Dressing virtually void any flavor   Without doubt worst Holiday dinner ever had  Won't back Thanksgiving dinner again  <EOR> This perhaps best Italian restaurant found over two years living dining Las Vegas includes many fancy Strip restaurants   Salvatore's really good food comfortable setting   I started crab tower towering indeed both size flavor   wife started favorite Caprese salad met high expectations   second course Pasta e Fagioli which pretty good   still haven't found Pasta e Fagioli Las Vegas good favorite version Los Angeles at Il Moro if you're wondering but better most   wife lobster bisque which good but great   entree pasta dish sausage cheese it off menu special can't recall name sorry    excellent plentiful   wife Linguine Clams which also very good   All all meal comfort food vibe Italian rather striving trendy high end fare crept into many Italian places   look forward trying Veal Parm next time   The ambiance good old fashioned Vegas   No faux old Italy checkered table cloths nor modern hipster decor find say Giada's Strip   No just comfortable room wood paneling low lighting perfect romantic evening quiet conversation   piano player Italian crooner bar stuck Sinatra standards including Great American Songbook stuff love   The service prompt although bit chaotic times   wait staff brought soup course before finished salads which bit awkward   But waiter both helpful visible enough service does detract five star rating   really seals deal five star rating price   worse Italian food cost twice much high end Strip restaurants  See reviews Rao's Lupo example  drinks generous over priced   very satisfying affordable meal   Give try  <EOR> This quirky Italian restaurant casino   Quirky because mostly sea regular silver haired diners enjoy throwback style restaurant very tasty food  There's piano player own certain style   and sometimes guest singers  Classic favorites 50's 70's requests   My favs are The italian chopped salad Beans greens Parmesan encrusted sole Clams mussels and     OMG broth must sponged bread You'll occasionally see noteworthy local politician newscaster celebrity dining there  No paparazzi tho we're just classy crowd that  nice place enjoy dinner catch your day people like  <EOR> This very disappointing experience  Came Christmas Eve family enjoy nice dinner which second reservation because made reservation online which when called confirm told where open Christmas reservation valid because forgot take themselves off opentable com arrive sat

decide bottle wine  response see biggest eye roll ever seen  Which response bye!!!! left telling management problem  If could give zero stars would  <EOR> We last night party 11   HORRIBLE service   can't say strongly enough   took 2 hours eat waiter never ever came back check us   Every time wanted something flag down   food OK but very pricey!!!!   $29 piece salmon   would expected pay Flemings but casino restaurant one   restaurant lot empty tables no reason poor service   When check he added 18% tip himself he used price including tax price food which you're supposed it    We spoke manager   She offered buy free drink bar but it   I never again  <EOR> My parents lived Las Vegas many years Salvatore's favorite restaurant   only food always good but staff friendly made them feel very special   them numerous times always impressed food service   piano player also wonderful   Look forward going every time Las Vegas!! <EOR> The servers great feel very special  hostess younger girl
