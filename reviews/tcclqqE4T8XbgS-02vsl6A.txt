 My friend first walked along look all food offerings   vendors under canopy opposite performing stage amphitheater   first set come all food vendors second set all clothing jewelry assorted services

comfortable going sitdown just try something different    I ticket two fer livingsocial came buddy Yelper Melissa G  amphitheter limited park bench style seating but plenty grass bring blanket grass some fold chairs  busy but overly crowded can't find space wait more 5 minutes busier booth    The way food don't hand them money but little money value cards  prepaid coupons when tickets purchase  more inside too  told buy whatever value needed looked menu see offerings each stall cost started off $20 since gonna cover more few dishes  most expensive $10 full plates while street food style offerings $3 6  included pictures years menu give folks idea   This try Melissas first pick Masala Dosa made Mint   havent while solid far dosas go  grabbed buffet plate India Palace which gave rice naan 3 dishes some chicken makhani veggie korma saag paneer  liked saag paneer did Melissa  thought makhani korma solid    We try more things  Melissa Aloo Tikki Chana same booth Rabri Mal Poora which made Origin India  aright but better  liked Rabri dessert which fried dough soaked syrup topped creamy sauce   Then some lassi which also Mint Indian  She mango really liked it  spiced buttermilk which made think it'll spices desserts sounded good   but bit savory spicy salty more drinking yogurt sauce    After exhaust some left over tickets chaat papri which made India Palace  thought filling refreshing  Then back strawberry lassi because savory wasnt doing me    We watched some performances but started rain took cover under some trees while decided which came good time then started pour down crazy    There non food items too  Plenty jewelry accessories clothing lots scarves sashes all beautiful Indian textile array but didn't really peruse heavily cant comment prices   Overall fun  low pressure festival  No crazy long lines pretty organized made no frustration moments  <EOR> I such amazing time festival invited several friends which made event even more fun me  entrance fee very cheap $5  event very organized over all  purchased meal tickets instead giving vendors cash liked that  Each station number given program listed where each meal also picture each entree  performances scheduled list each group  hosts program excellent  explained going english well punjabi  special shout white guy accapella group singing Punjabi we very impressed  All performances excellent  food drink also very good lasi aloo tiki amazing  great event  weather perfect until 4pm started pour  When left still performing dedication  Ill back next year im looking forward it!! <EOR> I spent two years India quite refreshing see lot familiar things  never use thing India though always people vocally want including being little pushy asking more food vendors   Being American Asian don't always that  portions very disappointing unless $10 buffet  Most photos posted misleading food drinks look bigger life  If India would spending half we're paying price same amount food event which still very authentic quality BTW  more taste test sample all restaurants town  <EOR>
