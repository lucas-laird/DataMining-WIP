The strange thing place bathrooms  Why pay close attention bathrooms places never know  But place stalls set separate pods alien like  they're individual stalls TVs playing music videos etc  very oddly set up  None less very nice but just very odd  <EOR> This bit enigma  purport feature plate sharing main focus menu however portions extremely small sure you're supposed share something barely enough person  example ordered spicy beef scallion dumplings came 4 tiny  OK fine  Next?

My favorites be Crackling Calamari Salad part trio salads included Spicy Beef Scallion Dumplings Grilled Szechuan Beef cooked perfectly sauce delicious Crispy Spinach usually fan spinach but made seasoned seaweed  Wasabi Mashed Potatoes perfect amount wasabi over powering  and last but least for dessert Cheesecake Pot Stickers MUST TRY! sound odd but dipping little golden triangles goodness trio sauces first bite heaven! <EOR> After eating buffet lunch looking lighter meal   weren't consciously looking anything expensive but happened end Mandalay Bay very tired 3 year old   menu China Grill caught eye because provided half plates food looked interesting   decided ordering appetizer entree share wouldn't expensive ducked in   Despite place being really nice bring 3 year old actually worked out   sippy cup juice low lighting quiet restaurant worked charm he light allowing eat very nice meal peace   ordered pork belly appetizer duck two ways   never pork belly before delicious although don't think order another few years!    came two salads watermelon avocado  Delicious   duck two ways obviously inspired Peking duck supplied delicious little crepes roll duck in   Very very good   Loved chocolate orange sauce  also shared cucumber mojito which very refreshing drink   All all very pleasantly surprised food   only problem price   Half orders appetizer menu item cocktail juice came $60!  little expensive but food memorable  <EOR> First off Saturday night only restaurant entire hotel didn't wait  starving decided try place  seating inside pretty awkward tables 2 going circle booths outer ring  seated table 2 very close proximity other tables not very comfortable all   Minus star  ceiling pretty cool hostess said place formerly club    lighting really dim struggling read menu  Note bring flashlight! menus really awkward well! big circle menu laminated tacky    I should've known would bad experience since Asian fusion Chinese Japanese = disaster  also received dirty plate which hard tell when dim lighting  sake menu pretty lame prices outrageous! starving ordered lot food    We started assortment rolls spicy tuna roll philadelphia roll crunchy roll california roll  ok sauces bit strange though  Philadelphia roll came pesto sauce which did match all  Then chicken salad  small portion huge! good but wish used stronger vinaigrette since bland  sesame oil did help perk dish  side portion duck fried rice pretty good but duck very dry beef jerky! ate fried rice took pieces duck out  ordered large entree barbequed salmon  salmon dry very fishy overcooked  did all  vegetables tasty though    Service pretty slow  party two sat ordered food before left before us! pissed off  dinner took 2 hours! wanted cancel food just could there  coming back  Food mediocre overpriced low quality  Service bad  <EOR> I happy chose eat dinner few weeks ago  Since catch show 8pm came around 6 time fixed menu which between 5 7pm  five $39 per person 2 apps 3 entrees 3 desserts  thought wouldn't enough food all but surprisingly portions large couldn't even finish off dessert! All dishes good esp  cesar salad which done asian flair  only negative dark could hardly see food! <EOR> $40 6 spicy beef dumplings two Sapporo's!  During Happy Hour!  Insane     We did enjoy though Vegas first vacation together years splurging   dumplings decent size R absolutely loved them   thought alright but almost more fond salad served with   think better dumplings before   guess ease sticker shock your meal receive two pork vegetable potstickers compliments chef place your order   delicious   Sapporos good too!    It definitely cool spot but thrifty   bartender nice attentive guy   thought community table cool idea basically share enormous table 14 16 strangers rather seated individal table   ambiance style restaurant cool sexy place romantic evening   I'd try place dinner if some extra cash burning hole pocket    <EOR> Start off positive  Food good  service terrible  Everything slow  waiter pushed into fixed course meal  assuming meal timely manner  Even fixed menu always waiting next course  wine arrived finished meal  Lots excuses waiter when really very crowded  many options around would say take pass  <EOR> We decided venture over China Grill hearing offer happy hour 4 7 bar lounge   The restaurant beautiful   waterfalls behind velvety booths set lovely mood   service excellent throughout   That said happy hour sham!  offer sushi rolls $5 $9 50   Unfortunately half sized! crock   $9 50 4 pieces sushi roll doesn't exactly qualify enticing happy hour   Furthermore beers $7   Um      how much normally???  happy hour price     There rum drink vodka lemonade red white wine hot sake $5   skip food enjoy afformentioned reasonably priced beverages enjoy atmosphere  <EOR> Saturday night girls night going concert Mandalay Bay Event Center decided start night dinner China Grill  rolled into China Grill hour reservation but hostess still able accommodate which nice    The decor China Grill modern sexy darker side    trying figure could sneak awesome lamps    Our server friendly he explained China Grill serves food meant shared    Asian tapas    should expect order come one one  decided lobster pancakes more crepe then your grandma's pancakes server explained starter while decided some sushi  drinks decided skip $12 15 special drinks couple rounds hot sake Sapporo sake bombs    The lobster pancakes came fairly quickly point decided order 2 full rolls Philly Spicy Tuna well half roll Dragon   sushi very slow come out   slow order another round drinks    Thankfully allowed 2 5 hours dinner even lateness sushi chef's slowness made concert right time   The Philly roll favorite night  Salmon top instead inside some places seem more fish way always plus  fish also tasted very fresh  Spicy Tuna roll spiciest think ever no need extra wasabi these! Dragon roll good but shrimp crab am used Dragon rolls being eel  fault reading menu more carefully    I no idea bill came sneaky girlfriends snagged check before could split costs  Strip though if expect spend $40 50 dollars per person preparty if dropping $15 drink your cup tea  <EOR> I meeting Bay afterward starved   Rather back hotel decided check Chinese restaurants Bay     first choice Shanghai Lilly closed walked across hall China Grill   very good   But also very expensive portion sizes didn't much either   Overall won't back but if you're bad option  <EOR> The food 2 3 stars    Environment 5 stars    I love environment  However would never tried if wasn't boss treating group dinner conference  very relaxed layed back happy hour afternoon where appetizers cheap drinks 50% off  Vegas inside Mandalay Bay price going cheap    Now food  very unique fusion Chinese Japanese American Style  don't think would survive if wasn't located such touristy area  However definitely worth trying if extra cash Vegas    It romantic casual whatever special occasion be  Just don't give high expectation food being authentic  Don't wrong tasty just authentic! <EOR> I've eaten China Grill several times   always enjoy food service   food modern Chinese flare  portions perfect flavors wonderful   always steak dish onion rings I forget name dish    would highly recommend if Vegas area   Food pricey but worth it   The bathroom also pretty cool  <EOR> Sushi drinks quite tasty but disproportionately expensive even happy hour   think common Mandalay Bay restaurants but bit shocking coming San Francisco even other hotels Las Vegas   Service ambiance excellent definitely price somewhat especially snacks during happy hour meal if you've just won big casino just want act have  <EOR> I don't it    I think China Grill suppose exotic dining destination Panda Express crowd fine dining PF Chang's Bistro followers but itself another problem     The first clue should when spied sushi menu restaurant named China Grill um China Japan however since food categorized Asian fusion several drive by's Miami Beach location where always appears hopping decided give Las Vegas location try    Overall very uneventful boring meal which consisted beef dumplings starters green salad which no hints Asian spice flavor entree sliced beef which tasted no more grilled beef soy sauce    Given outrageous prices charged all menu items which would issue if each appetizers entrees prepared more creativity think most guests would better off going actual Chinese Asian food restaurant over unimaginative restaurant  <EOR> Had large group dinner China Grill party Red Square   expense account evening extravagance order day   eight ate LOT  Appetizers tempura sashimi lamb ribs crab cakes dumplings  All quite tasty fast   entrees each ordered entree but insisted serving family style   so everyone sampling each others dinner  A bit snafu when came order   asked butterfish miso sauce but told out   then ordered salmon   waited waited   and no salmon   finally flagged waiter he check   Then he sheepishly came back told salmon   NOT butterfish   butterfish all  much chagrin mates also wanted butterfish settled vegetarian foodfest   Service good   ambiance okay   loudest group Las Vegas next table   shouting laughing loud couldn't hear conversation  One final word bathrooms   Check them out    you through beaded curtain then find five white pyramids     each contains bathroom   Strange   So decent meal solid Asian fusion cuisine   Good group very tasty  <EOR> We tix Mamma Mia Mandalay just looking quick bite before meal such gem find  menu creative service terrific waiter looked Prince Harry no joke food seriously good    It just sister could only try three dishes but hit homerun choices spicy  meat dumplings chicken salad garlic prawn over squid ink pasta  ate every drip   And when told Prince Harry waiter going show he made sure all food quickly kept checking even remind moving  If time would definitely dessert sat around awhile  Very beautiful place eat felt very lucky find it  <EOR> The food delicious usually hesitant Asian Fusion food  might converted me  Tasting Menu which good choice because literally try everything  Usually experience nicer restaurants smaller portions but case  enough leftover food could fed another meal so    I absolutely loved crackling calamari salad crispy spinach because reminded Korean seaweed snack grilled szechuan beef cheesecake potsticker dessert   surprisingly liked wasabi mashed potatoes   Our waiter Lars attentive very helpful  could tell he cared food since he seemed awfully concerned when looked no going eat last cheesecake potsticker    The bathrooms little odd because reminded high end porta potties  also mini tv screens playing music videos next toilet  Awkward  <EOR> Dropped dinner long flight Hawaii   ate bar orders some appetizers fish   food appetizing all portions very small   ambiance service great but found food sub par such restaurant   may try place again  <EOR> So cause staying Mandalay Bay RE MAX Convention   advertised $5 drinks sushi bar area went   order special menu order price assure sushi $5   Service creeping along     took forever glass wine   actually $5 but Grey Goose Grapefruit friends ordered not   My friend some sort crab roll tasted bad     she doubled over pain end night   Philadelphia roll o kay   ordered Volcano Roll Spicy Tuna roll both which good   free edamame because lame service    Overall     less average dining experience  <EOR> This first time eating place  Heck first time eaten fancy restaurant Fancy meaning EXPENSIVE   first wanted eat buffet but always eat buffet every time Vegas  wanted try something different buffet period    Service Hostess great seating right away  Waiter pretty cool well  Food serve all same time but did notified begin wouldn't  Because food being prepared ordered them   Food break down came   Appetizer Crab cakes  Now understand tried crab cakes before local restaurant near but none compare one  melted mouth  Big flavor portion right price    Salad Peking duck Salad Then Peking duck salad  Bold flavor portion pretty huge start half   Entree First came Char siu baby back pork ribs  son loved rice  came jicama slaw dried apple slices  okay  better ribs   Second came grilled garlic shrimp black fettuccine red curry coconut sauce  absolute favorite  Now if your think cause says curry might spicy all  great    Last came grilled szechuan beef  pretty great too  five vegetable fried rice plain steam rice    No dessert cause full  <EOR> Perfect place dine family style big group   group 8 ordered practically half menu!  Portions adequate though some like Kobe Beef Tartar favorite table could've just bit bigger   2 standouts Lobster Pancakes Grilled Garlic Shrimp     Service excellent very attentive just right doses   Everything specialty cocktail menu looked divine   opted Lychee Mojito   To   Die   For  <EOR> Because friends came right before night town forced order light being far tight dress all  sheer necessity ordered salad    Usually girl does order salads why ask? Well because waste money throw vegetables together home fraction price same dish would cost restaurant  when eat order hearty ensure money's worth    That POV until tried China Girll's Cracking Calamari Salad  no words describe excellent salad tasted  superb absolute best salad ever pleasure eating    It good taste salad member party returned previous order subsequently ordered same thing   I can't even describe may put salad but all know next time every other time am Vegas found sitting blissfully content China Grill eating Calamari Salad  <EOR> 1 food garlic shrimp schezwan beef didnt taste anything garlic shrimp beef dry  1 price 100 two you'd expect great things    1 mediocre service asking refills shouldn't necessary when your paying much  1 misrepresentation there's nothing chinese grill   Sorry but chinese food Studio B buffet better lol  <EOR> stopped happy hour before show  Found nice spot bar ordered $5 drinks HH menu  some kind rum punch  very good! 3 them nice buzz when left  I decided try some food ordered spicy tuna roll cucumber salad  It hit spot just right  just wanted light snack thats was  The bartenders awesome  Bringing water soy etc  I would come back again happy hour  <EOR> This place letdown  all places Vegas eat enjoy sushi thought would better but wrong  took 15 minutes help seated waiter complete ass  He even far telling hurry order when choosing appetizers    The service slow drinks meh food nothing write home about    Spend your money elsewhere  <EOR> Amazingly place vegan vegetarian menu   Unfortunately China Grill vegetarian equals bland    The only item truly enjoyed baby lettuce salad dressing good anything heart palm artichoke usually fav  <EOR> Revisited China Grill last weekend during trip Las Vegas   tried 'new Sampling Menu   little pricey $72 00 per person but worth it   food again comes family style servings   Way much food eat total six dishes     The sampling menu gave opportunity try different dishes normally end ordering same thing most times   Cesar Salad rocked   cashews crisp won tons instead croutons   new favorite salad going next time entertain!
