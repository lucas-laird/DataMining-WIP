Driving down Trop Ave noticed banner hanging front proudly mentioning Best Las Vegas award albeit 2010    but would standards change short time?  Maybe raised expectations   I arrived bout 11 30am given lunch specials menu insert but decided would try some breakfast since still late morning   Selection sorta limited   there two choices   Chorizo eggs Hueveos Rancheros   OK many choices but granted don't open til 11am demand break probably minimal   Got Huevos Ranch   Just two small med sized eggs tortilla   would break bank ownership put large XL eggs dish costs 10 bucks w tax?  And side Wait It! some beans refried Rice? no  Sour Cream? no  Some cheese sprinkled pintos? no   Maybe lettuce tomato garnish side? no   maybe pipe dream real ranchera sauce stead lame canned salsa?  I told waitress needed some rice she obliged   but kinda crunchy   Ok guess cook hadn't chance cook some fresh stuff day just grabbed left night before albeit dried enough could hurt your teeth  Even though she didn't charge brittle rice bill came nearly 30 bucks w tax tip huevos guacamole 3 coffee 3 albondigas soup Carrots? no  Sprig celery? no  Mex chayote squash? pipe dream  Granted cook didn't total aversion vegetables   the soup bowl equivalent onion ring it   Not there's anything wrong w dropping 30 breakfast one well maybe but  different discussion but shouldn't minimal garnishments burnt tasting coffee supposed culinary capitals country  <EOR> I don't often good mexican food anymore now live Canada every time Vegas always head Macayo's   On first visit last week ordered all time favourite Chili Relleno  wasn't tasty last year now rice beans extra cost  don't know different other just wasn't good usual  Relleno sauce seemed different couldn't taste chili much should   On second visit during same trip ordered shredded beef chimichanga  heaven! chimi huge beef very flavourful beans perfect heaven!
