Caesar's salad tastes cheep    Added chicken enough large salad! Disappointed!!! Waiting pasta     But holding breath!!!! <EOR> Vast amounts poorly prepared food presented raucous atmosphere dragooned waiter waitress choruses special restaurant birthday song   If don't screaming infant need bring restaurant don't go     The Veal Parmesan howling mess   Italian restaurant don't even serve capellini  <EOR> Today's experience just awful plain simple  don't even know where begin but goes    Came hubby late lunch before he needed back work   He ordered lunch chicken parm server said comes side pasta pick another side  hubby both looked each other what? Because just week before came side pasta being choice  asked waitress if she sure she said yes  he ordered potatoes thinking he getting chicken parm side spaghetti marinara also potatoes  But when plate comes just chicken parm potatoes  asked where pasta she said  side ordered  crazy weird mix there    Then ordered dinner size small spaghetti marinara knowing would leftovers take home  But when waitress read back order she said large spaghetti marinara  correct wanted small dinner size   When came bowl fairly small usual size supposed then top off marinara runny non existent thick marinara usually plenty liquid bottom  Just gross   asked waitress why size smaller usual she says  size is  disagreed that  But she long gone going missing side pasta husband    So since waitress hadn't come back yet looking manager time schedule time running out  found waitress behind bar area when asked manager she pointed lady other end bar where were  know manager heard ask manager but did move toward me   walk over ask if she manager she said yes proceeded tell needed leave food all messed did time them fix needed go  She did come table saw spaghetti did agree marinara being runny she did agree size wrong should larger  time waitress come back husband's side spaghetti marinara  marinara looked better mine thicker top but still liquid bottom  wonder if cooks understand need STRAIN pasta before pour sauce top SMH  manager did see agreed liquid needed strained off pasta she took kitchen    Right time when husband tells chicken parm tastes awful very hard unplatable  When manager brought back side pasta told chicken said just needed go  don't want anything all just mess  She did give side pasta take  We just left shaking heads thinking world just happened here?   Our last visit week before perfect  came 9 pm sat bar area waitress attentive friendly service perfect food yummy we ordered exact same thing today    reason craving again  time disaster wonder if ever come back  Sad because love food  <EOR> We terrific dinner service  waitress attentive  food delish!!! <EOR> This only second time location since corporate  Not very impressive honestly   Since corporate food portions DEFINITELY gotten smaller large would feed 3 normal people still pretty decent x Pasta bit rubbery but actually put decent amount sauce now!  We around 9pm server started off loaf bread  The bread actually main reasons even come here! We told asking refill baking some oven eagerly waited  That around 9 30pm  We asked check 10 15pm  And  when server realized he still gotten bread refilled   It's almost hour point pretty sure bread doesn't take long bake irritated but husband calmed down told he probably just busy forgotten   But honestly? It busy all   Most employees already putting away tables seemed everyone already rush home even though didn't close another hour   Our waiter came back told just simply run bread! asked once again mind you  He did even decency tell soon he found out Well  mean just bread   So really would big deal all if told beginning but just infuriating feel you're paying good money barely decent service   Like honestly? I bet bread baking he forgot because younger couple time he realized MAYBE did run bread but definitely some left when first asked OR since ask third time paying MAYBE he forgot once again lazy couldn't bothered grab some???  My husband feeling very good we celebrating valentines early hate crowds he kept going leaving good tip he's extra generous when he's happy We left 10% tip end because understand most money servers through tips we don't fck anyone over something petty but just felt very offended even given BASIC customer service Also just say because just seems ridiculous stop baking bread 9 30pm??? When close 11pm???  That's very strange   We only 1 refill we ask ice tea during hour long visit so much ice literally 3 sips like??? It took longer then 10min server collect payment   We didn't even bag  My husband carried container hand even walked PERSON offered bag  just seems thing employee dedicated providing excellent customer service no? EDIT Also way he talked end beyond infuriating   As collected check ASK ONCE AGAIN what's happening bread that god damn bread man WHY could he just say something sorry seems run bread  sorry inconvenience Then could like Nah cool  just bread I literally feel pulling hair out He just oh yeah man  there's no bread ran something And husband just confused asked why he told baking some more if weren't  He's just yeah don't know man  guess not  actual hell??? It actually kind insulting he talking us   His tone voice suggested he tired just wanted away   Sorry  tried nice when wrote last night but damn man  It's kind hard write nice review someone made your blood boil   Honestly wish didn't tip all   Oh  might only 2 check ins but coming semi regularly location since 2012 1 2x every other month just say new woman manager or whatever she is also rude hell x  There situation happened last visit few calls corporate manager apologized  I'm sure she forced because she sure hell wasn't very nice when she apologizing mother in law   I originally gave 3 star rating because first date spot didn't want sully memory place used special us but wow   Sorry but forget that   BEING getting HORRID customer service really ruins place nostalgia   Taking down 1 star because sure hell won't coming back  <EOR> Well return visit choice very surprised food much better waitstaff pleasant food much better however did stay away certain selections lol good job Bucci return choice <EOR> We love come place all birthday celebrations    always share all ginormous platters bring out  amazing server Jessica tonight     she great even through crazy large parties restaurant tonight being Mothers Day weekend beginning graduation season  only bad thing say wait while drinks bar appetizers didn't come but said crazy huge parties    party 15 people!

Came some real Italian lasagna something less adequate  Such nice appointments all around place very home like warm feel good waitstaff  But food    goodness    The bread cold uneventfully tasteless  Lasagna breaking down ingredients  Tomato sauce excitingly visual but way sweet Cheeses mediocre unappealing  Pasta equally bland something large grocery store  The meat something popular chain taco fast food joint   Overall horribly disappointing <EOR> There comes time nearly every chain restaurant when something wrong  tell good restaurant bad way handle it   experienced first hand few weeks ago   ordered Bucatini Ala Enzo Pancetta Prosciutto button mushrooms peas pasta   Well while eating discovered wax paper still prosciutto   informed waitress apologized find was   While she gone found several more pieces    manager came apologized explained offered replacement entree comped meal   well handled mess   love Buca portions worth prices value amount food usually quality above average especially chain   handled situation very well left satisfied would safe come back again   Till next time    <EOR> Amazing over top attention  catered needs demanding toddler grandchildren  Good remarkable service top notch  poor experience managers asks up  Boy did they! best part great service started BEFORE knew were  Amelia server!
