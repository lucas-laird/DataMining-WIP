Now during football only $5 <EOR> The first time ate wasn't bad   Tonight however couldn't eat food   ordered corned beef sandwich which came rye jack cheese   also ordered small green dinner salad   disappointed salad seemed only leftover type lettuce found inside iceberg lettuce near core   Worse corned beef   no flavor definitely salty should be   told waiter meat tasted sitting water 2 weeks   He did apologize but said he would tell chef    No came apologize nothing taken off bill   sandwich bad only ate 1 3 left rest   Service pretty slow  <EOR> My hubby came late night snack during stay hotel  no entertainment while quiet warm atmosphere  ordered potato skins pretzels cheese Irish but very tasty hit spot  service bit slow but weren't hurry didn't bother us  Overall lovely experience <EOR> Decided lunch Saint Patrick's Day  took awhile drink order being seated wasn't busy  ordered 3 Green Beers Corned Beef Cabbage   some unknown reason playing loud hip hop music Irish Pub  asked waitress why wasn't any Irish music playing  She stated don't know just work here  thought odd because St  Patrick's Day   meal brought before Green Beers   Corned Beef Cabbage meal amazing! Green Beer finally arrived Plastic Corona cup  Really??? Isn't Irish Pub??? Overall very good experience  <EOR> Still looks cool pub but management knack ruining menu   First took potato croquets    probably most popular appetizer type item they've switched bangers mash new bangers aren't good don't soda bread anymore now rid Franziskaner Hefe which favorite back going YardHouse it   used come place few bets mon  night football game watch game some Franz irish food    but now going find somewhere else hang out  <EOR> Love place  Friday nights live music smithwicks beer get  Great authentic feel very friendly staff  <EOR> Fun!

She asks Did want potato skins appetizer ? course little puzzled responded Yes   server says keep your meal warm      huh   what? appetizer served warmed meal which surprisingly     dried heat lamp  Subsequently probably won't return  <EOR> Your typical Irish Pub Wooloughan's located inside Rampart Casino JC Marriott Hotel far west side town Summerlin Pkwy Rampart     We arrived 8pm Friday evening place seemed fairly busy   waited door hostess serve but several minutes no acknowledgement existence walked attention server she sat station   She very friendly seemed good spirits   always nice server happy disposition!  We both started cup roasted corn chowder bacon thick flavorful very satisfying  entree grilled vegetable salad added grilled salmon $3 which bargain because good sized filet 6 oz    server said salad really good but am going say just good   While salmon cooked perfectly vegetables just OK  Some rather bland lemon caper dressing little boring too  Salt pepper helped but couldn't uninspired salad   while menu lists asparagus first ingredient only 3 very skinny spears which bit disappointing   My date chose shephard's pie which bit let down too   tasted canned chili mashed potatoes top  shepard's pie before usually beef stew flavor beef chili flavor   Oh well   He ate all anyway   Our dessert actually quite good     shared apple crisp generous serving Granny Smith apples baked cinnamon sugar topped pastry crumbles served scoop vanilla ice cream   Very tasty apples cooked just right   Overall A OK place would eat again if area but don't think would special trip food  <EOR> Alex bar created exceptional experience  He's very professional point! Always checking if customers need anything  IPAs which sample before committing  salmon which very good not exceptional   But then again bar  Price quality salmon fair  Finished off Frangelico decaf back  Sweet!! Nice evening Vegas!
