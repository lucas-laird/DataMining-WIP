played   2 piano players started then swapped 1 player another duplicated song which struck odd since they'd only playing 45 minutes   They decent fun but don't if want talk socialize because can't

When first heard Pub hoping experience sorts  place where knowledgeable bartender would able tell something beers available introduce something unique confident recommendation based your likes dislikes  did expect them cicerone a beer sommelier duty but did hope see staffers proud working might take interest grandiose selection beer   So while enjoyed most beers  many  service Pub impact initial impressions   Maybe isn't right place self proclaimed beer geek  certainly don't want feel embarrassed asking questions might come across haughty pretentious but would hope many different beers available someone working would equally geeky would want share contagious excitement them  Instead staff dealt always seemed disinterested maybe bit overwhelmed might more comfortable dropping bucket Bud Light Limes your table  <EOR> If don't want wait lines deal d bags hos just listen music good time eat some freakin happy hour specials Vegas place be! loved here!

A nice little bonus during warm months Pub directly next pool via outdoor patio  being able people watch while having some lunch nice cold beverage fun that's creepy anything    right?   <EOR> They totally replaced restaurant  No more beer towers no more delicious pizzas  BOO  <EOR> What awful experience  First off didn't high chair couple withs baby  didn't see any other babies place using them all up  private event 8 knew hurry order  Plus show 7  house margarita pineapple orange juice it?! kidding me  did replace but still couldnt taste tequila  know brew pub but if cocktail list least know cocktail  waitress really friendly seemed rushed  Other staff helpful  Food came wrong  asked no onions onions  offered take back but hurry  Quesadilla salty very greasy  Huge disappointment  all choices passerby  <EOR> Very convenient during last day stay Monte Carlo its open breakfast! Great beer selection worldwide  <EOR> Service terrible waitress looked mad she serve large group  apparently stone age POS system because couldn't split check write check split names amount due  remedial server knowledge use position numbers keep track bills  Lazy no excuse! <EOR> I really enjoy beer selection pub best bartender Vegas  bad food selection poor quality worse  service bad bar but much worse ar tables  Management seems understand simply does nothing   This could such good place <EOR> I've few beefs place   They hundreds beers but beer menu AFU  person wrote obviously isn't beer geek  Way many errors list  $9 friggin Guinness draft?!

Maybe sold out? sure waitress wasn't aware either  Each time ordered she left beer came back say would choose another  disappointing  Otherwise great place  <EOR> This worst experiences EVER restaurant   arrived told would 10 15 minute wait   45 minutes later nothing   did see anyone seated while waiting nothing said all stood right it if ceased exist    hostesses look confused majority time but just kept adding names list giving times certainly unrealistic    A couple bar seats opened main dining room bar made beeline them supposed serve full menu and first come first served    sat down waited bartender walked back forth front 5 times without even acknowledgement   He finally asked he could waiting 10 minutes asked food menu   He grabbed menu set front us   drink menu    no food   He said he leaving would probably food drink other bar walked away   thought surely restaurant would replace 15 20 people still bar when he said he leaving it 7pm busy    so am dumbfounded manager would let bar unattended prime time hours many people waiting currently served because ever growing list front    He left bar area saw talking looked manager     he 15 more minutes   still no food no drink no menu NO SERVICE all now over hour into nightmare    OH    and never took name off list front    and still never called table  We before service wasn't great then either   but least able sit eat       We finally decided just leave pick something way home  think lack service TWICE now BAD would never back again    AND locals!!! <EOR> We dinner wasn't good all  selection dinner options seriously lacking  worst meals ever had!

Ok free drink well drinks but hell cares   it's free drinks! Oh bartender helping very friendly super nice   Next time Vegas definitely going Pub only its happy hour but also cool vibe  <EOR> Met some friends Saturday night few drinks appetizers  When walked must sat table good 10 15 minutes before waitress finally came over        first drink sat another while before waitress came over finally offered another round  say because friends gotten before ordering drinks between off        Before getting third beer sat ANOTHER long while  Finally over wasn't going order anything else  friend asked if done drinking  told no choice waitress sucks ass specially since bar half empty!!        DUELING PIANOS only good thing pub  During dueling pianos also take karaoke requests  yourself sing white dude think worked great country voice  <EOR> Three stars beer selection  also tasting flights which wonderful option when much choose from  only little actual food during visit cannot provide much feedback but soup day tomato basil actually very good   Where lost stars having bizarre wait table  place half empty but actually queue six deep wait runner sit super quick process  Perhaps short handed Tuesday evening there? Even table service absolutely no complaint person serving table but he seemed pulled many directions timely   Bottom line if going enjoy pick large selection beers think might find better options elsewhere  <EOR> I excited check place because beer selection however very disappointed atmosphere bar   A large group stopped grab few drinks start night  pianos playing lame music piano players trying hard funny     but just seemed off  bartender efficient friendly but it    round soon left find something more fun do  <EOR> Slow rude servers  brought wrong drink didn't even apologize  love margaritas theirs good best skip it  came eat  watch race left drink  Very disappointing  <EOR> The Pub nice open space   long bar near front restaurant  showcases beers tap a BIG selection    lucky enough locals card which entitles happy hour specials anytime   includes $1 sliders $1 wings well 2 1 domestic beers well drinks   am real light beer drinker stuck couple IPA's   wings delicious   chili garlic sauce really good   Just right combo spicy sweet kinda me!    fairly busy since few big football games going on   plenty tvs seating patio heaters smokers   9pm Fri Sat dueling pianos   left time because became really loud impossible continue any conversation   But seems fun atmosphere  <EOR> If you're looking great selection beer place  If you're looking great meal place  pretzel appetizer large good  burger called Kobe burger but then lists different meat under it  Food average no raving reviews party  However wait staff friendly  <EOR> The Pub no longer four foot tall beer towers  food good everyone group liked burgers but its bit spendy $10 every burger menu   nice big place lot space easy bar even when its crowded  <EOR> After seeing only 3 star place expecting little underwhelmed place ended being pleasantly surprised instead   friends essentially walking through Casinos watching Chicago Blackhawks vs  L A  Kings NHL game decided drop watch part it  Saturday evening place wasn't very busy finding seating pretty easy   This place pretty big  long bar lots seating several tables several televisions   decor kind cool well tons beer company logos lining wall bar   bad setup   The beer menu massive  Huge selection beers tap bottled pricing fair exception few bit overpriced   Vegas though gotta pay bills renting space somehow suppose   bar food least tried pretty good too   group tried some sliders Happy Hour price $1 chili nachos   nachos just mountain chips chili cheese guacamole deliciousness   sliders were   sliders  pretty but don't expect getting juicy Kobe beef patties   way satisfied   The bartender pretty nice actually pretty mellow but he squared away can't complain   food took few minutes but nothing agonizing  watching some old guy manning pizza oven cooking slinging flatbread pizzas left right made want one   Like said pleasantly surprised place   can't vouch when busy but guess arrived during ideal conditions worked pretty well   doesn't take much keep happy place did  <EOR> I able catch game while still being close pool! waitstaff friendly attentive helpful  If into healthy eating order Anton!!! wish could every restaurant serve EXACT meal grilled chicken patty topped egg  any style served salad lettuce tomatoes cheese avocado   also serve Lindeman's Framboise here   pricey but must those seeking alternative standard flavor beer  place great watching games all day attracts serious fans! felt right home would definitely go to spot catching games and good food vegas  <EOR> I rated 3 based two visits    The first visit Sunday evening 9pm just some drinks  place quieted down since all football over day  sat bar ordered Pyramid Haywire Hefeweizen something can't tap back Denver but favorite beer husband ordered Blue Moon  both  second choice Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat  it  3rd Widmer Hefeweizen  Finally beer had  But 3rd choice  realize Sunday evening busy day football but when boast many beers tap really should them    Our bartender very nice super social apologetic lack beer   The next night dinner during Monday night football game  meals excellent  husband Hangover Burger said almost much burger but delicious  Fry Sampler which two types french fries sweet potato fries plus accompanying dipping sauces  All 3 awesome    However    Again ordered Pyramid Hefeweizen  Monday thinking beer likely delivered day since Sunday  Nope  Still no Pyramid  did 2nd choice least    The bartender very attentive  He 7 people area bar spent whole time conversing couple far end bar  He nice enough when he came serve but took while it   Would back again? Probably not  food definitely good but if paying $8 beer I'd rather chance want  Yes ladies drink free 9 10 maybe I'd but otherwise check something else  <EOR> The Pub fantastic look feel would loved drink some many awesome beers but came lunch early still recovery night before  But plan going back having least couple dozen 300 beers some point   Service great barely let drinks dry before bringing another which always list good things   I burger which cooked just way burned!   bacon which came little weird  just bunch bacon crumbles meat  turned tasting excellent but sometimes just want chew strip bacon!  Definitely back! <EOR> The food drinks pretty good however little pricier worth opinion  happy hour offers 2 1 drinks little more worth it  reason giving 2 stars however several different reasons  first time came place half full 15 minutes no coming over take order tired waiting just left  second time came football day wait table over hour just left again  most recent time came actually ordered asking happy hour  noticed when checking hotel signs said happy hour included $1 sliders $1 chicken wings  asked server he no idea talking about  He said he would ask manager then when he came back never brought up  ended splitting some chicken nachos having beer each which wasn't bad all  finally check waiter told us manager said there's communication problems between marketing dept  restaurant advertising but haven't started offering yet  He pretty sneaky wait until done eating bring because if heard before ordered definitely would wanted speak manager myself  think ridiculous ads all over hotel $1 sliders but restaurant honoring this  If knew information before ordered probably would gotten left place third time row  location amount tvs quality food would expect more 3 star average yelp place but because TERRIBLE SERVICE definitely see why ranks low  coming back but next time demand honor ads rather considering possibility just mistaken  Good menu BAD EMPLOYEES  <EOR> Came some friends try several 200+ beers offer  early sat bar  Walking place pretty dang big many bar top seating's many table seating's well stage area live music sitting area  also many TV's located very corner!  At bar quickly greeted asked order but since first time asked beer menu more beer book! many beers all over world which pretty cool  Bartender came back took order quickly   Once friends arrived moved table seating where party 7 received drinks orders quickly well soon off ordering food  sever little slow uptake but overall did great job getting things correct without problems    I standard Pub Burger which thought pretty tasty but nothing special just good overall burger  Sweet Potato fries never wrong  ordered couple different beers quick appear table  see other reviews stating poor service which certainly happen any give time but experience service pretty point Saturday night 8pm   There band playing different cover songs loud couldn't conversation table which good but entertaining overall   I certainly return some beer drinking probably try some more food  <EOR> Interesting architecture but  all interesting place  Very college pub atmosphere whole lot interesting beer   <EOR> Before last trip Pub would given establishment 5 stars  sister town decided watch Italy England game there  made way down bit late weren't many seats  put names looked around bar seat meantime  seats when guy came not Pub employee told few seats farther down  some reason followed seats stuck odd spot where harder watch game  sister sat down stood watch game he talking bit lot though  ordered beer pretzels bartender great  beer selection great pretzel excellent  game started chatting few England fans we watch Italy   didn't think anything until guy led great seats started saying things sister thought guys would more grateful seats making comments talking other guys  Fine whatever  Then he tries guys kicked and almost succeeds takes sister's seat stand up  Again really childish but whatever lot jerks there  Then he starts loudly telling friend stupid going on  looked said know hear right which point he told point  furious  said something hostess  told which guy he saw speak someone why give Pub 2 stars and probably never back principle     No did anything  patron essentially belittling two women your establishment NOTHING because your buddies bartender  really want known? couldn't believe it  Then he almost guys chatting kicked again  Apparently if local overlooked  Absolutely ridiculous  worst part didn't even kick guy just would nice if would word show cared he treating customers pieces garbage   Doubt back shame beer menu but plenty other places appreciate patronage more Vegas  <EOR> Ozzie WORST BARTENDER ever encountered! He's rude  really looking forward coming place huge tab selection honestly say whole experience ruined  He made supposed nice evening bar awkward unwelcoming  way bar busy no reason such crappy mood  suggestion next door Diablos  Service amazing there  <EOR> Lots beer waiter staff mediocre  Prices ok slider dry  <EOR> They tons beers tap flat bread pretty good  dueling piano kareokee making more interactive customers quite fun! <EOR> Went back place return trip vegas its changed alot  Its completely overpriced ridiculous prices food drink  wanted 20 bucks 3 tasting brewed beer 10 bucks most drafts    The hot wings 13 dollars order ill never back sorry brought group here    I know its Vegas but man happened place  <EOR> I only drinks bar   beers pretty good   husband local stout top he said tasted chocolate    summer ale tap which more hefenweizen   Unfortunately no longer brew own beer don't fooled large brewery equipment windows   lots smaller teles along bar HUGE television enter left side restaurant   probably awesome place watch some NCAA madness down couple brews  <EOR> Very good food great beer selection   Only reason its 5 star review price   burger $18   being said would back order again   burger pulled pork sliders excellent   definitely going back next time Vegas   Gonna save some comp points though! <EOR> This place changed dramatically recent years   Now more beer bar 70 taps among highest strip    able enjoy pint Goose Island Matilda but then didn't enjoy $10 53 price it   Oddly enough lot beers but actually few beers   mean don't large selection people really into interesting craft beers   if every mass produced domestic gateway craft beer tap very few Matilda like offerings  <EOR> This first meal Vegas great! Though bit pricey portions big very tasty  Service very attentive incredibly quick but 2pm Sunday can't say always is  Also huge selection beers isn't much more ask pub Strip! <EOR> Great beer selection but good spot if mood something else  <EOR> Came since gf wanted something munch arriving vegas   and since hotel    why not?  We hangover burger which topped fried egg  good but nothing spectacular  also chicken nachos   Yummy but equally forgettable   All all just ok  I'd only come back if find myself staying Monte Carlo again   Our waitress nice but she wasn't very attentive  Took forever just pay there  <EOR> BF brunch  seated pretty quickly waitress came took order  loved she very honest gave great suggestions    The place looked pretty busy weren't sure long food going take  Luckily wasn't long  food you'd expect cafe  3 stars food but extra star great service waitress gave us  <EOR> This first time EVER shAring review but feel if should help people when decide eat here  food actually decent but service HORRIBLE  <EOR> We came lunch Monday   met some friends staying hotel   seated immediately told server really busy he would soon he can   looking around looked large group sitting upstairs     When Tim did arrive table he took time answered any questions had   placed drink orders root beer draft   root beer served beer type glass no ice   some best root beer ever tasted     I ordered Lil Boy Blue burger   burger perfectly cooked medium   toppings fresh two types onions caramelized raw   also lettuce tomato course Blue Cheese    different options buns choose whole wheat one   fresh tasted great! fries delicious hot just right amount salt!
