Have enjoyed all experiences location    personally don't use delivery fact live down street but going picking order always good  <EOR> Furious service given Pizza Hut  ordered half black olive half plain cheese pizza online discovered upon arriving back home entire pizza covered olives   My companion cannot stand olives called hold almost 3 minutes  Finally unpleasant employee answered phone explained situation  She immediately offered deliver new pizza but once gave address quite literally five minutes away she informed deliver address would budged  pizza would take least half hour before could picked up   In precious food service job taught bend over backwards customers wronged  Pizza Hut failed miserably doing so  <EOR> 2 hours delivery ice cold when smashed side box  $30? just order dominos papa John's <EOR> It smelled bad  Really bad! old dirty socks  But service pleasant food even better!
