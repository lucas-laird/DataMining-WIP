Food typical BWW good   Sounds crazy but temperature bar area way cold  might 115 outside but way cold inside  <EOR> I'm big Buffalo Wild Wings fan being east coast prefer Quaker Steak Lube  But particular location give four stars  wings great service awesome  late night going away party manager attentive polite fun  see myself going back location again  <EOR> Food always good tried new flavor cherry sting good  plenty TV's watch 'the game' servers very attentive but tonight way much 'attention'!  We've seen captains before going around introducing themselves asking if anything making sure having good time etc       But ste times when just want eat wings watch game without all goodhearted interuptions!  Not only server eager share visit back home Thanksgiving holiday reunion military boyfriend but she stopped dozen times asking if 'you guys ok' plus two captains made rounds well manager? couple just wanted wings watch ULNV ASC game interupted way much!  So expect lot attention when go  Food good service good games good when you're interupted! Maybe should consider 'no bother' sign flip when service isn't needed! <EOR> I'm giving 0 stars!!! Don't if you're minority part lgbt community both  Waited forever patiently couldn't even water  bartender complete asshole rude disrespectful  45 min wait decided leave since didn't even drinks saw others came getting serviced  bartender upset because leaving while waiting food  When tried explain didn't even drinks he said he other customers service  Never going back place again!! unprofessional    understand places busy but he apologetic partially attentive group  <EOR> Ambiance open 24 hours spacious inside large rounded rectangle shape bar table mini slot machines side tables  Service only server entire place late night very slow  Food standard taste   Onion Rings *** average taste   Spicy Garlic *** very spicy   Mango Habanero **** sweet spicy   Buffalo **** medium   Bourbon Honey Mustard *** sweet  Price large portions decent prices $15 $20 each <EOR> Honestly star only given because server very caring  keep Matt! food other hand pretty    nah reaaally upsetting  fries only super dry but hard rock hopes tenders being juicy per usual also ridiculously dry  bummed this  If weren't being super hungry having sympathy over Matt serving numerous guests being alone would honestly said something  only warn people if experience similar situation PLEASE say something won't home sore jaw myself    Also just future reference take off expiration sticker lids your ranch before serving them  happy knowing 2 different ranches given 4 days apart 1 being almost week old   which quite obvious sour taste  <EOR> We came Buffalo Wings late dinner   seated right away waitress arrived table shortly after    She very friendly   atmosphere great wasn't busy   restaurant clean  ordered garlic parmesan wings  wings nice plumped well seasoned delicious!!

He literally said guys allowed sit ever! told when didn't play! money! can't tell sit but sit ever again any games ever IF $20+ EACH SPENT ONLY 1 HOUR including generous tip considering less mediocre service DIDN'T COUNT SHIT! He pretty much said he didn't care business even though 3 other friends  REGULARS they every week!!! Then he directed yelling boyfriend even sitting machine way whom he only interacted when 1 measly drink! totally honest most bars unless super busy don't care if sit bar you're gambling  If busy players want play politely ask scoot over table move NONE people working bar did even mention ALSO most people sitting along bar playing either! know fact because made sure observe because POLITELY asked scoot another seat before bars but looking every else thought would fine  obviously many people  sitting games   playing either! Including couple observed just chit chatting whole time  stepped outside through side exit 15 minutes then came back seats front machines still wide open available we're take  ANYONE looking gamble  way STILL paying customers fair square! whole way asshole Doug approached incredibly unprofessional rude  Shitty customer service customer interaction  know what's funniest?! Prior review others who've complained too!
