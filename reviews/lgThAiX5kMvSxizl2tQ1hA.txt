Now all find your way ONO! ***   BUT boy say although place hasn't gotten much attention Yelp certainly gotten enough attention stay open 15 years! short but friendly conversation older man works there  I'm sure he's probably owners SOMETHING thought cute he shirt slippahz shorts! closed Mondays which odd day but least available Sunday church goers! menu extensive pictures almost everything serve walls along some interesting pictures few local articles   The food amazing portions generous! Local Hawaiian style food hole in the wall mom pop sort place don't expect wonderful presentation anything but taste definitely there  fact some best mac salad tried    WAAAAY better L L's hands down! twice chance eat Sweet Sour Spare Ribs FALL RIGHT OFF BONE! taste just home    MMM second time Beef Sukiyaki! much bigger most Japanese restaurants would serve came rice  boyfriend Combo Adobo first time  He preferred chicken Adobo over pork second time he special came Lomi Lomi Salmon Kalua Pig Lau Lau  EVERYTHING GREAT! Also both times large families come dined well  talking 15 20 people all once! also taken care well considering cook server  Amazing handle themselves!  If lived closer I'd definitely getting take more often    but I'd say worth drive regardless    If you're looking some local kine grindz spot hit  flavors right same time offer friendly casual service   OH shave ice!!! REAL SHAVE ICE! snow cones only $1 75 3 flavors if remembering correctly  even add ice cream small extra charge  Talk feeling you're back da 'aina  Thank goodness Hawaiian Hale  <EOR> Love it!
