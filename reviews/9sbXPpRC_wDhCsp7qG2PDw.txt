Ok maybe ordered little much both us  But honestly didn't expect portions generous! Next time item possibly appetizer soup would more enough    Here's ordered General Chow's chicken $7 50 flavor rating 4 5 Hong Kong style crispy noodles $7 50 flavor rating 3 5 Eggplant garlic sauce pot $7 50 flavor rating 3 5 Veggie egg rolls $5 50 flavor rating 2 5 Out everything ordered General Chow's chicken most flavorful  rest dishes we're sort lacking seasoning flavor  excellent disgusting would say average  value amount food give reason keep coming back!   mentioned love city? <EOR> I twice last year when visited Vegas  say best Cantonese food ever! Good service! <EOR> This place just horrible! Upon entering restaurant tub full garbage just sitting around middle room don't eating while there's tub full garbage gazing right me   To start off only given menu    party 4  know we're economic crisis right now but really menu? Anyways proceeded catch waiter waitress could order dishes waiters waitresses just wandering around restaurant if clueless ordered Half chicken Garlic Baby Bok Choy Salt Pepper Pork Chops Tofu dish We asked server kind ingredients tofu dish he stated tofu GEE thanks! would've never guessed! Once order taken if your bill exceeds think 40 dollars free side obviously bill exceeded 40 dollars but nope stingy restaurant didn't even mention free side always free side every time went   When Salt Pepper Pork Chops Half chicken Garlic Baby Bok Choy knew something missing  forgot complementary soup! Every Asian Restaurant comes bowl complementary soup! Every table soup but us! Note place wasn't even busy service just lazy    Onto dishes half chicken came first  very rough chewy  chicken obviously sitting around couple hours if days   Our next dish Garlic Baby Bok Choy  ordered dish many times various places rather simple yet satisfying vegetable dish  When Bok Choy came    just horrific  eating family members found bits pieces shrimp lurking within center dish  If remember correctly ordered garlic baby bok choy bok choy special surprise center   Moving Salt Pepper Pork Chops arrived  extremely greasy very chewy some pieces mostly just fried pieces fat   Now you're probably questioning why didn't review tofu dish simply fact canceled order came us  family always try something different menu but when asked waiter ingredients tofu dish all he stated tofu bit shady  actually glad canceled dish because when came all soup two colossal chunks tofu drifting center   To top all off excited dessert! Oh wait waiters waitresses forgot just forgot free side soup    My family restaurant numerous times understand occasional accidents we're only human  When stuff happens sure piss family off especially when tip around 20%   Obviously won't back  <EOR> Pretty good value tasty food but service really poor  forgot give napkins gave wrong dish  <EOR> I waited past 6 months good Chinese food  Well worth wait  may Chinese food again  another six months don't care cause tonight completely sated  Vegas nirvana  slot machines hear  <EOR> This place terrible!

I came tougher critic believe Mom Sunday evening  No else good sign   @ Soup Included meal  good par stuff HK Star   @ Shrimp Tofu tofu good  saw shrimp but couldn't really taste shrimp all since overpowered tofu  Just regular tofu next time   @ Sizzling Beef came sizzling plate  While good item sauced fairly heavy little more salty side  Food Express dish right   @ Bi Fung Tong Seabass favorite dish HK Star  Even though HK Star uses frozen seabass dish place doesn't taste fresh them  just lacks spicy kick HK Star offers  bad dish overall but could lot better   @ Roast Duck duck bad recommend going Sam Woo your ducks recommend against going Sam Woo entirely past! all fairness HK Star fairly bad reviews duck well  lacked nice crispy skin firm meat duck unhealthy eat but oh good   @ Thai Ice Tea whatever  tasted much better stuff before    @ Carrot Desert carrot dessert soup  full opted it  included meal    Lobster $10 pound $1 12 more HK Star  Across board everything same couple bucks more HK Star but nothing terribly expensive  also $5 $6 lunch special menu HK Star    This place seems wide selection ChaoZhou dishes  Upon further research type cuisine tends healthier seafood veggie dishes other Chinese cuisine  tend less flavoring letting ingredients speak themselves  similar philosophy Japanese food  Whether place actually follows philosophy can't confirm   This place fairly new having 5 months  place related HK Star anyway despite similar menu name  inside feels cheap all fans there  But best chinese restaurants notorious looking nice inside!  Service really iffy  terms getting food they're fast HK Star  Since its only couple mintues slower its still reasonable dishes  waitress speaks mainly Chinese very little English may language barriers those only speak English    They 2 promotions where  if spend $38+ free vermicilli dish if spend $55+ free 1 5lb crab  cool all but waitress could just answered question much needed spend $38  She asking if wanted soda thai ice tea implying free  charged it  When asked she says oh its $38 free item  Just tell need $3 more pick own item  Uncool sneaky way that  able duck instead vermicilli dish little social engineering     I only came because food whore check other options despite HK Star being very good me  guess put head shame walk back into HK Star ask forgiveness   You would only come if factor HK Star wanted ChaoZhou dishes  HK Star better place every way price taste service  only thing over HK Star its more tourist East side friendly since its closer strip open till 3am late night eaters    Not Chinese Mom approved  <EOR> One best place lunch  lot good items $5 50 $7 50 each  Good portion well  wonder why still spend lunch money somewhere else  thanks Yelp now know also late night special  <EOR> I notice everyone star very pleased loved food till bad experience had  Why complain bad experience if u horrible experiences every time but didn't  Anywho place actually pretty darn good close 6am  beef chow fun pork blood leek  yummy!!!!

Pretty ridiculous  food came decent time but waiting service pretty much done  least food good may back but much better places good food good service we'll see  <EOR> Definitely 3 stars place because everything seems just average no disappointment great impression whatsoever   Foods alright nothing spectacular   Service just A OK typical Chinatown style which should expect much   Decors? hmmm    very minimal   enjoyed lot appetizer platter Teochow appetizers including slow cooked pork intestine tofu peanuts etc  made authentic yummy! special marinate soy sauce tasty! <EOR> Service place hit miss sometimes they'll really accommodating other times when restaurant really busy they'll come take your order bring food won't see them again till ask your check lol now if past food actually good  family love having lunch dinner since its cheap always good  usually fried flounder crispy house noodles chicken dried fish fried rice  think those all must try there! tried other places sometimes tastes much msg doesn't food isn't greasy  quite sure time think around 10pm price back being lunch price great cheap spot late night well  <EOR> I shall preface saying vegetarian which reason such poor star rating  If you're meat eater disregard review  might think jerk giving bad review place word seafood name because lack veggie options  But reasons   We hit spot desperation looking early morning Chinese  Props being open 24 hours day  Your tea fine your rice well cooked but  all positivity force business   The majority Chinese restaurants gone all over country able competently accommodate vegetarians  only options limited but waiter genuinely seemed want offer alternatives   You don't veggie egg rolls? can't veggie egg rolls?  You can't conjure some fried wonton shells?  You don't offer fried rice without egg?  We asked if number simple accommodations could made waiter replied no no before we'd even finished asking questions  He just seemed pretty anti vegetarian   On flip side friends really enjoyed beef dish spicy chicken rice  But sure hell won't back  <EOR> This spot lunch specials late night specials  didn't catch until when lunch special offered but night let order lunch specials 10pm  menu quite large all under $7 50    I've never doesnt really stand outside shopping center  easy drive know there  came group friends late night eats going 2nd Chance Prom    We ordered family style Crispy noodles seafood noodles veggies good but found calamari bit fishy   Eggplant tofu garlic sauce hot pot great flavor liked tofu surface soaked sauce quite bit General Chicken actually really tasty  prepared way reminds more sweet pungent most places Tso's nice light crisp it   Salt Pepper Shrimp cooked crisp where eat shell all  eat lot these   Greens steamed garlic simple but good  Gotta some veggies    It fed 5 people well under $50 bad! did appreciate items weren't greasy some other Chinese spots open late    It's no frills quick cheap food  pretty decent  If you're looking cheap lunch late night meal then try spot  back! <EOR> We coming since remember writing review reminding unhealthy chinese food but man when want crispy noodles place  Served big pieces chicken breast chinese brocoli deep fried noodles smothered gravy sauce   Yes please !
