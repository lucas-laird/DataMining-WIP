HUGE portions suggest share your food if typically can't finish things order  Most food burgers fries but different options steaks fish chips lobster rolls etc  Also unique touches burgers sandwiches peanut butter crunch burger  bacon cheeseburger absolutely amazing  saltiness bacon nicely balanced perfectly seasoned meat patty  wasn't salty seasoned  also Mac Cheese side burger creamy delicious! Loved it! Before stuffed devil's eggs appetizers  light creamy but only wish gave more! dessert F A V O R I T E part  ordered chocolate cake lemon sponge cake both amazing! Each cake rather each dessert came little mini milk shake complimented whatever dessert chocolate cake came chocolate shake lemon sponge cake came light lemon y shake  thought absolutely cute unique price think worth it  If you're chocolate heavy sweet addict recommend chocolate cake! The prices weren't bad casual restaurant strip hotel  price range $8 $47 $47 being highest menu   burgers entrees ranged $15 $32  steaks most expensive ranging $32 $47 but said portion sizes huge share    As service PERFECT  friend different experience but think she just overreacted things  mean pretty busy when came very demanding  asked napkins straws ranch dressing separate spoons desserts etc  kept ordering things different times but staff amazing  friendly everything asked for  very attentive needs    The reason rated down star because wished would've asked wanted burger  thought it'd come rare usually does but came medium rare wished would've asked before ordered it  Also each friends different types fries instance hand regular french fries another potato wedges another something totally different  wished would've asked kind fries wanted least indicted type fries entrees came menu  last thing fish chips cost $24 but only 3 pieces fish whole basket full potatoes bit disappointing but other whole experience fantastic    This great restaurant if want hang friends relax grab burger chill! recommendations would definitely try desserts Mac Cheese side! <EOR> At first glance 1842 nice 'old' pub style its interior but upon closer inspection feels much better glorified Applebee's  some neat light fixtures but lots hard surfaces mostly oversized booths really odd back bar strange replacement classy interior Nobhill  restaurant located middle restaurant row picks huge crowds convention center MGM Grand Arena plan accordingly if you're during peak period  weekday noon able seat right away but just 10 minutes later some convention broke lunch line door  way many items list menu but many them sound great  Now gotten burger way head back fried homemade pickles lobster corn dogs minimum   Out several burgers offer sounded most interesting peanut butter crunch burger bacon jam potato chips  Upon first bite hit fantastic beef char flavor instantly brought back Nobhill burger enjoyed much but things changed bit there  Don't wrong really enjoyed burger but some flaws if going nit picking self  bun bit thick dry which didn't help burger peanut butter its main toppings  said meat excellent flavor cooked well but juicy patty all  bacon jam great flavor really paired well potato chips even though can't taste them well mix  Overall assembly just naturally very moist loses something me  two people lunch both ordered bacon cheeseburger theirs looked much juicier mine  I'd love come back sample both 1842 burger near future  All right flavors know most likely still produce something fantastic   Unfortunately fries seemed somewhat generic frozen variety weren't quite good before but good rosemary flavor cooked well  really wished something little more original when paired something odd burger bacon jam peanut butter potato chips it  price $17 seems way steep burger couple them $18 menu  understand convention centric dining spot strategy but still bit hard cough kind money burger  Plus if consider last restaurant which arguably fancier more intimate served possibly better burger $15 bit more troubling  Regardless Pub 1842 seems quite good menu seems offer several really good burgers if you're MGM Grand probably won't find better offering  <EOR> A must eat place MGM!

SO why 20 dollar cheeseburger yes even though Vegas balls charge 20 bucks cheeseburger isn't half good local bar's 9 dollar one? any category    The meat tasteless dry even though did cook medium rare  bacon jam awful overpowering could still taste scraping off    This just confirms theory famous chefs anything Vegas restaurants best help design menu slap name cash checks until closes  <EOR> I pleased Mina's other restaurant RN74 wanted try Pub 1842  Servers really friendly seated right away dinner    Wait times during sporting events probably longer  noticed some tables beer draft machine  server explained table pays certain amount fill own pay go  great idea! only downside only 2 types beer each tables all serve different kinds beer    I tried 1842 burger which pretty tasty  moist flavorful  However asian salad disappointment  nothing spectacular some weird chipotle flavor    I able redeem Yelp check in offer  Buy 1 1 free beer  Great deal! <EOR> While staying MGM tried place first time glad stopped   burger BBQ brew pub place   server Pen suggested tried award winning bacon burger ranks right best tasting burgers had   also huge! served large side fries   prices place little higher end burgers etc but everything Vegas seems little overpriced point    Anyway still recommend place great tasting burger! <EOR> One best Jems Las Vegas   stumbled across while avoiding rain  nachos huge affordable delicious   burger delicious amazing secret sauce   Service amazing   split food without asking   ordered drink specials $8 we're disappointed amount alcohol included   Highly recommend trying place when Vegas  <EOR> Peanut butter crunch burger bomb  Doesn't soggy right amount sweet savory filling  <EOR> We found Pub 1842 walking thru District having read some reviews here   did disappoint!!

Not sure but wasn't really feelin' vibe   For main entree tried well acclaimed 1842 Burger $18 whereas significant tried Double Smoked Bacon Burger $19    One main reason why chose 1842 Burger because aioli however when finally bit into seemed well crafted burger saddened fact didn't quite taste good appeared  WOMP WOMP! aioli supposed enriched hints mushroom it  Instead super dense creamy all texture experienced many times other venues  Moreover tasted pretty darn bland  Huge disappointment especially since meal cost $18!  In all honestly Double Smoked Bacon Burger seemed much more appetizing 1842 Burger    Only downside?    It big! Yes burgers big point where someone no longer enjoy because they're unable bite into all layers    I better off just eating season fries came along entrée  perfectly topped cajun herb seasoning  Finished them matter 10 minutes   Since all second chances look forward trying 1842 next time visit Vegas  consider trying all starters available hopes won't need order burger fill up    With all said give venue solid 3 stars mainly quick friendly service clean subtle rustic themed venue   + Happy Hour every Thursday Monday between 2 00 PM 5 00 PM  + Group Dining Available parties 14 more  <EOR> A good place enjoy couple drinks well dinner or both did recently    Relaxed atmosphere friendly staff      They good tap beer selection a couple dozen could see and having Deschutes brew must try     Food wise wedge salad good the balsamic drizzle along lightly creamy but chunky bleu cheese dressing perfect    Shrimp grits good blackened shrimp and grits just right texture wise    slice Andouille made every better   wife filet which came tangy chimichuri sauce sweet spicy bbq sauce side    street corn good side share   Everything good nacho plate looked awfully good   next time sure! <EOR> Absolutely great survive food!
