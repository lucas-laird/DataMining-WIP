Let start saying loved restaurant since Barbary coast   locals Las Vegas considered favorite restaurants  Last weekend took two best friends visiting town eat Michaels   excited them join us   immediately seated when sitting down 5 minutes when maître d' came friend holland told stop staring girl boyfriend husband sitting behind us   First all two couples sitting behind didn't know which he even talking about   Secondly just stunned!  friend embarrassed didn't know much less which girl he taking about   considered leaving but decided just ignore good time  In meantime head waiter kept ignoring running over table couple if done something wrong  We embarrassed frankly shocked didn't know say    Let say dressed nicely regulars restaurant between 4 spent $875   drinking much rowdy being problem all  Michaels needs understand tons other really nice restaurants choose rest until friend gets formal apology owner staff   talked some other restaurant owners know never heard anything happening   never back! <EOR> Amazing experience  Beautiful wine list  Perfect servers  Food very best  know you're getting into when no prices menu but totally worth money  rock crab perfectly rare steak  All kinds extras come your table well pickle tray amuse bouche chocolate covered things  Would reccomend  <EOR> My advice nice restaurant Strip you'll better more fun experience pay much less same quality food   Let's start beginning      My husband both heard such great things Michael's thought we'd try out  moment walked awkwardly silent welcoming all  People literally looked crazy and apparently going there  waited bar 20 minutes finally seated then sat another 15 minutes before anyone even came say hi take order  Finally when server arrived he dropped off platter vegetables yes giant platter two baskets hard bread   Once received menu another 20 minutes later waiter didn't over tell experience would like  just order entrées hoped best way prices twice much best steak houses Strip   entrées came 20 minutes ordered time completely full platter veggies  food definitely great but some best restaurants Strip twice price pay Michael's same quality food if better    After dinner asked if wanted dessert  Although declined because incredibly full pack half entrées still insisted see dessert cart  caved ordered dessert  time literally explode then kid brought entire fruit basket not fruit bowl platter basket platter full chocolate covered fruit  Don't think waiter would mentioned bring entire fruit basket chocolate cover fruit platter end dinner when said did want order dessert because full? eat much???  So effort try meal worth price did best eat fruit but impossible  concluding dinner left uncomfortably full complete utter buyer's remorse once received far expensive bill  Meh  <EOR> The food fabulous but few things need know  First very expensive resturant even when compare other high end steak houses strip which why gave 4 stars instead 5 stars   Dinnner 2 cost least around $300 does include if order drinks it also does include tip your final bill could actually around $400 $500   decor atmosphere very elegant     but also dated    it looks high end steak house looked 1950's 1960's all dark red colors dark wood chandeliers     however know many people really nostalgic look can't really fault them decor  stated before food great portions tremendous so much able 2 more meals leftovers brought home   also some additional niceties very few places such bringing complimentary big vegitable platter big bowl fruit  But because enormous portions main meal suggestion would skip items  final suggestion eaten few times desert cart looks great    but always full order anything    but if still want something sweet your dinner coffee then give great complimentary dessert chocolate covered fruit platter     also save little money having order dessert  <EOR> Excellent Service Awesome Food Great Atmosphere although pricy its perfect Birthday dinner  Highly recommended   If afraid cost stay away but if live your life add your Vegas bucket list  <EOR> This classic old school Vegas gourmet room experience  Almost exact clone original Barbary Coast location Michael's trip back time circa 1975 over the top service lots table side preparation amazing Caesar salad flambé cherries jubilee etc  classic entrees   really Vegas fine dining used right down menus handed ladies no prices listed   If want cutting edge cuisine celebrity chef's name over door elsewhere   However if want authentic trip Vegas past place go   Just sure bring plenty dough $200 per head pretty easy hit does even include wine  <EOR> We ALWAYS point enjoy extraordinary evening Michaels' while Vegas   place type place 'quick bite'   must savor every bite every course      scleanse between sorbet fruit whatever provide   amazing experience   cannot even explain much love restaurant  <EOR> My wife celebrated 31st Wedding Anniversary last night 6 14 17 Michael's finest meals ever had   start waiter Vincent everything could possibly want   He very efficient wonderful personalty very pleasant with    Kudos Vincent   initial vegetable plate meal itself   Caesar's Salad made table side wonderful followed pallet cleanser which included Dom champagne   adult beverages choice Charles Krug Chadonnay wife Tangueray me   Both substantial pours   ordered medium rare Chateaubriand which literally melted your mouth   servings large  brought home enough two more meals   Yes pricey but worth every penny   next time want Special Place Special Occasion give try   If enjoy finer things life give Michael's try   Very satisfied customers Jerry Sandy LaFavor <EOR> We town little under dressed since planning bowl upstairs friend hungry entered restaurant  manager Jose Martel profiled when asked if fine dinning  He said defensive irritated tone course would see menu!
