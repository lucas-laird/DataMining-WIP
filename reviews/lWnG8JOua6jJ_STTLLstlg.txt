Interestingly made order    Steps rolled ice are 1  Put ingredients cold plate 35deg F 2  Pulverize ingredients paddles 3  Spread ingredients thin freeze  4  Roll ice cream into tubes paddles   For only ingredients aren't good rolled ice nuts because odd texture once being pulverized    Otherwise they're all great!  We shared Wu Tang rolled ice cream  vanilla based ice cream Oreo cookies good!  liked lot    I location because there's no line!  waited 25 min competitors  Also convenient if you're Boca park area    What disliked seem lack focus product  brand themselves rolled ice cream restaurant which they're great at but giant freezer full gelato front register  gelato section takes more floor space 3 cold plates   <EOR> Rolled ice cream rolled into Boca Park former Vivido Gelato space!  Came during soft opening torn between Smores coffee flavored specialty options  Helpful staff suggested DeathB4Decaf option made coffee base added toasted mashmallow other choice which just hit spot!   The order pretty quick liked rolls held shape very well didn't melt  flavor ice cream itself more pronounced elsewhere coffee flavor really distinct  Looking forward coming back try Thai tea version soon!  They still gelato available those unwilling wait if there's line  3 ice tables long trained staff working should able keep getting orders fast  Props having vegan options gelato only right now coffee available too   EDIT Returned BOGO grand opening weekend special tried Gold Digger Thai tea lychee WuTang's Cookies Cream self explanatory   Both pretty solid tons cookies lychee toppings  Even switching different base first visit flavors still strong! <EOR> Use gelato place  Located Boca park  Shorter line Rolled Ice Cream  good  Nice addition boca park  still sell gelato well  board games use play  <EOR> ICE LAND AMAZING  love key lime roll positive energy  also board games which always fun while enjoying something sweet ! <EOR> Came grand opening since doing BOGO  sure mention deal because won't tell you    If you're new concept 13 signature rolled ice creams $5 99 each $6 99 each unlimited topping pick from  option BYO build your own same price   I ended picking gold digger because really Thai tea  wait didn't take long all  see entire process them making ice cream  Let just say topping game weak! When signature ice creams LA good amount topping but place stingy   The ice cream itself pretty good but bit sweeter preference   Overall probably only if close area  isn't worth 23 minute drive where live  <EOR> Ice cream very unique coffee flavor tastes strong fresh bean! No complaints super cold ice cream  watch them kind treat  But going gooey sundae ever disappointed! cookie insignificant size n flavor caramel barely discernible kit Kay topping wimpy  Come guys 6 bucks some toppings those bad boys!!!! Probably going back that   sorry say  <EOR> Love place   Rolled ice cream absolutely delicious unique Comcept   Definitely recommend <EOR> Having recently returned trip Italy craving gelato  gelato truly good although miss fresh made waffle cones did Italy  ambience great lot outdoor sitting   But gelato excellent!  also seem give generous size scoops  <EOR> Their rolled ice cream delicious!!

<EOR> Well least two local places better Rolled Ice Cream  Ice Land Vegas third ever subgenre ice cream which tried but second chronologically three local businesses offer lower case rolled ice cream treat modern Thai street food dessert entertainment value preparation  upper case place pioneer Vegas scene but its lower case product lacked both flavor texture   The location otherwise nondescript gigantic plaza northeast corner Rampart Charleston  found without much trouble due bright sign night  walking inside noticing seating area totally empty oddity late nights dessert shops experience browsed rolled ice cream menu blackboards located exterior wall   There only portion size $5 99 cup  Unlimited toppings available +$1 upgrade if you're into sort thing  Ultimately settled limited premade combo off signature menu assuming should reasonably good offerings realizing generally take long decide especially considering variety choices base mix in topping sauce  choice Gold Digger Thai tea base lychee mix in lychee topping condensed milk   After placed order employee said they'll watch  He prepared cream grabbed mix in poured those onto three super cold surfaces which instantly started freeze foreign invaders  employee quickly chopped mix in then started mix everything then flatten again final rectangular setup rolling  Five scrapes later five spiral cylinders dessert ready toppings sauce sauce rear station   In terms texture thickness lower case did bear uncanny unsettling resemblance not so creamy overly spoon resistant product upper case competitor  only really soft enough just before started melt  However give props variety flavors add ons especially real lychee fruit found doubly dessert  familiar anyone eaten fresh canned versions it  said Thai tea flavor does seem somewhat muted which guessing side effect cream which use all bases  Still more interesting something mundane vanilla chocolate   Ice Land does offer gelato coffee which seemingly holdovers old inhabitant space named Vivido Gelato but seems unlikely those particular offerings would worth visit  hope return occasionally but easier Henderson resident drive another lower case spot which prefer overall  very rarely find myself particular neighborhood other reasons read restaurants seems unlikely change  <EOR> If you've never rolled ice cream must try it!
