Went first time few weeks ago friend before  usually won't try small Italian joints I'm Olive Garden kind guy but once complimentary garlic bread hit mouth knew gonna alright  pretty awesome! ordered baked ziti alfredo sauce topped grilled chicken which wasn't new menu but server hooked   Everything excellent  Service phenomenal  felt only people restaurant! Needless say back  <EOR> First off say saddened own rating    wonder if place changed hands new owners something    because eaten numerous times over past 6 7 years used pretty good    just never bothered yelp until year   hadn't visited quite some time partly because burnt calzone partly just because just didn't think many times    but decided again time    wasn't good experience all! First off used love garlic bread used ask extra basket    but last visit UGH!!  bread wasn't even toasted used be    mushy soggy    just because puddles butter it  Usually lightly toasted top great light crispy golden brown    wasn't toasted all if picked piece turned over butter POURED off it   each took bite stopped eating left whole basket practically untouched! We ordered ordered MANY times past    wanted SHARE calzone which exactly ordered said We're sharing pepperoni calzone  When brought surprised cut split onto two plates thought nice them  calzone wasn't burnt least last time reason long since last visit   but wasn't great either    sauce tasted totally different just didn't taste good    good but great   wasn't 'bad' per se but disappointed    first time restaurant wouldn't back ordered again   But used great which why came back occasionally  But really angered final straw    when check charged $4 extra SPLIT calzone half   asked server barely seemed speak understand English btw she just said sorry  thought demanding manager    but then thought why bother won't back lousy $4 must desperate it   But way male server seemed see frustration face told charge    he said she should told if kitchen cuts charge if cut don't  said she never said anything never ASKED cut usually cut ourselves would happy today    wasn't great anyway  He apologized said he hopes we'd give them chance us   said no won't back  If he really wanted FIX he would refunded ridiculous overcharge right then!!  Plus sad charge $4 kitchen slice calzone us   also based tip off amount without $4 charge    tip food drink amounts unnecessary charges! You would think would happy ANY business charge people something which people less likely dine again   place used mobbed all time some years back wait tables    but practically empty last nite deserted many other times when drive by   But now understand why   Honestly think must changed owners something chefs because didn't recognize anyone used see all time food quality flavors changed service gone downhill   shame  <EOR> I tried Strings again bad experience 1st time some years ago  visit disaster too  poorly groomed waiter enough leave he dropped off menu  No server should ever call customer Buddy  placed order     waited     waited waited    The luke warm poor excuse minestrone kept busy few min  Finally pasta dish arrived    wrong dish  server did even hear ordered brought completely different dish  He reordered when arrived wrong sauce  Maybe 5 oz pasta dish $10  Needless say  worst restaurants Las Vegas  Don't even think wasting your hard earned money here  Oh forgot the garlic bread pretty bad too    LOL! <EOR> I'm probably more 2 1 2 stars one  used come more often then gap where wasn't way  food used bit better last visit  service friendly everything quick come kitchen  eggplant parmigiana fettuccine alfredo okay  marinara odd taste something reminded more enchilada sauce marinara  alfredo good soupy which hate but slightly more beigey ecru tinge instead being more white  any event isn't wouldn't back but don't think would special trip  <EOR> My husband meet parents least 3 times month love everything it  favorite server Chris she's best! only serving time she remembered all little quarks extra raisins salad fact brewed iced tea kind gun  Now sure only when she's working    As always overstuff complimentary garlic bread  but food overall wonderful  recommend Veal Marsala Meat Ravioli  <EOR> Not very impressed  Italian family owns upscale Italian restaurant Houston TX    I expecting more  SHouldn't listened AroundMe App  Food really blah interior pretty cheap looking  would happier Olive Garden which sad  <EOR> Some best italian food ever had   Excellent waiter wine atmosphere lighting decor quiet where actually conversation people you're food no less splendid   lasagna squid shrimp alfredo some kind reduction wine sauce knock your socks off bread great deserve every star   sure hell casa di amore down street! <EOR> In town full good Italian restaurants Strings delivers value money without Olive Garden style slick service Tuscan Culinary Institute inspired dishes all likelihood menu because focus grouped reviews food stylists marketing department creates Italian sounding words almost will    So if sort thing gotten transitioning Olive Garden lifestyle Strings easy some its set familiar  all you can eat salad served almost same bowl tong combination OG but better quality  soup alternative option also home cooked taste etc  bread also higher quality  where Strings first wins over OG its locally owned attention every course standard Olive Garden experience cannot match    Strings' lunch menu smaller portioned size dinner menu reasonably priced specials let's just dinner items  settled Tortellini Alla Panna favorite perfectly cooked sauce neither weakly disappoints nor overpowers  course standards lasagna various spaghetti fettucine dishes also quite good if really hungry triple combination lasagna tortellini stuffed mushrooms take care well  marinara sauce sometimes hit miss but never fear if mention your server another plate bowl appear improved sauce matter minutes   I've business lunches casual evenings dates even Christmas Eve dinner no matter occasion food worth price right  helps place locally owned giving hometown familiar flair    The only reason cannot give five stars because once every 3rd 4th time visited service spotty  mean long wait times between courses no explanation and sometimes avoided eye contact over attentiveness because line eager guests subtly encouraged pasta it  rare though food certainly worth occasional service glitch  <EOR> If want try some delicious authentic Italian food then need try Strings Italian Cafe   All Entrees come delicious salad soup   Mondays order bottle wine 1 2 price   food came hot sauce fantastic   service great definitely back again  <EOR> Went lunch   tried spagetthi marinara sauce which good  cafe salad garlic bread both excellent  very fresh  <EOR> I love Strings  Great quick affordable lunch off strip  fettuccine alfredo linguine clams favorites but girl friend swears Carribean salad  If need pick me four layer cappucino way go  down easy keeps hours!
