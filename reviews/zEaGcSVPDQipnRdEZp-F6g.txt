Demarco's really takes crust seriously! order pizza taste just pizza New York Di Fara's Brooklyn use all same ingredients   waiter said even bring water New York recipes  shows much dedicated food   proof pizza! <EOR> I invited Dom DeMarco's some friends pizza connoisseurs   told place BEST pizza Vegas  Naturally skeptical  First all everyone thinks pizza place best one  Secondly when anyone tells place best anything   I am extra critical because  very lofty claim make   So   our group seated patio which thought pretty cool  weren't huge group but still gave whole patio ourselves  huge fireplace which obviously wasn't lit because summer but imagine would really pretty winter months   Our service great  All drinks refilled without having ask  Everything brought smile very timely manner   So   was best pizza Vegas?!?!  I would say   YES  Awesome crust  Fresh toppings well balanced  Great service   Amongst group ordered 4 different pizzas try     1 Bianca which white pizza ricotta garlic basil   and just OUSTANDING  could easily eat everyday!! thick crust which phenominal   2 Margherita which very basil y   so LOVED it  would also back just pizza   3 Big Apple which sort answer meat lovers   ham pepperoni sausage think meatball  didn't really eat but did try piece pepperoni itself which great none left over obviously good   4 White Truffle  truffle oil mushrooms garlic   I am mushroom truffle oil fan skipped one   I also cannoli go  fantastic   This place probably new pizza place   and probably start telling people best pizza Vegas   You should definitely check them out  <EOR> This place jumping early Saturday evening! sat bar could watch NFL playoff game  server did great job getting drinks pizza order quickly  Peroni draft served icy glasses  Ordered Big Apple  we large two because really hungry wanted some take home  Pizza came reasonable amount time it  Outstanding NY style pizza! server recommended cannoli dessert  house made delicious  split which just enough few bites each  All all great food service even busy Saturday night  Five stars! <EOR> Came check place mom cousin hearing franchise place voted 3rd best pizza NYC  We'll see  very impressed place far since still soft opening phase write this  Service excellent waiter Juan Carlos way many occasions see needs met drinks always filled  level attention above beyond many fine steak houses to  three shared Dom's Fries 15th St BLT salad White Truffle Pizza w meatballs  fries crispy dipping aioli sauce great only drawback serving kinda small  salad very good cause can't wrong bacon! Finally pizza excellent lots flavor garlic truffles  cousin loved crust crisp  little pricey even higher Grimaldi's think but attention details it  bad its far away but certain try place again  Another awesome NYC pizza place invades Las Vegas! <EOR> We other side town all say is    well worth trip   Great food fine wine upbeat atmosphere   back =  <EOR> I really wanted place  atmosphere great sat outside twinkle lights set such great mood absolutely lovely! waiter attentive informative  The wine good        Then food        So disappointing       We meatballs appetizer  pretty good  Calamari not!  The Di Faro Pizza all hoping for  Just absolute disappointment   I love pasta!!! mean love!!! Pasta!!!! I Pappardelle meat sauce looking forward dish! I ate bite didn't take home left overs  <EOR> Wow! awesome dinner! Bot only did excellent service Ariel rock! but food great portions big!  We Mediterranean salad Baked Ziti favorite   Eggplant Pizzete! Wish room dessert   Because in house made cannoli sounds yummy     Give them try   glad did  Everything made in house   taste fresh! <EOR> One new favorite places eat NY style pizza within 2 miles other 2 favorite NY style joints! sets DeMarco's apart other two decor ambiance still other two when don't want sit down only grab some quick slices   spared no expense remodeling space formerly occupied Atlanta Bread Company very nice!   We ordered large sausage mushrooms spinach along Mediterranean salad  Loved he salad  But really enjoyed crust thin slightly chewy  told waitress used distilled water drinking making dough  Perhaps secret just Grimaldi's does it? Speaking Grimaldi's which wife likes more prefer chewy crust unlike Grimaldi's thin cracker like crust  Plus Grimaldi's decor nowhere nice DeMarco's  <EOR> I've tried Dom Demarcos PIZZA twice now am ready give  opinion  First time ordered large square Pizza Sicilian Style sausage  Pizza excellent taste great sauce  Could touch more sauce lot more cheese thickness dough  also could little less olive oil dough kind greasy  ordered sausage half pie  sausage good authentic taste but hardly any pieces approximately 2 3 small turd style pieces per slice just teaser I also ordered 2 Cannoli  $6 00 Ea tasted if made  store bought flavored mix fresh ricotta cheese lemon sugar almost no chocolate chips dried fruit real New York version  If you're going charge $6 00 pop cannoli real ones!  My second try Dom Demarcos thought 'd try traditional Neapolitan round  ordered 18in  Meatballs pickup Calzone sliced Ham  The pizza looked smelled Great! thing missing! ordered MEATBALLS MUSHROOMS pizza! If used maybe 3 whole mushrooms entire pizza would lot standards! The pizza towards center rolled thin tortilla maybe because weren't any Italians working kitchen  The calzone good but again dough rolled thin tortilla finger touch center poked hole thrrough it  The bottom line if you're going charge premium prices PIZZA use premium ingredients premium quantities your product! I recommend owner should shop competitors METRO PIZZA Biaggios such see offer similar prices!  You New York taste down but put more stuff your pizza! BTW way born raised Astoria New York Grandparents Naples  also 10 year culinary background Saucier Sous Chef  I KNOW GOOD NEW YORK ITALIAN FOOD!  With little improvement place top pizza joints Vegas! <EOR> From New York good gets Vegas   square cut best Sicilian ever life just order well done middle doesn't cooked properly   Service hit miss but generally good   Outside seats nice touch   no longer late night happy hour though   Still worth trip <EOR> I remember reading DeMarco's last fall Serious Eats  article Slice section website following construction restaurant which set open sometime soon  article lit fire inside me  scoured deepest reaches internet weeks not really pouring over hundreds nope articles reviews Di Fara original and famous pizzeria opened DeMarco Sr  New York  try pizza! SE article didn't say when DeMarco's would open but knew would ready! wasn't    I forgot  never heard Di Fara before reading article since don't live in visit New York wasn't top food priority list  Also didn't know exactly when supposed open couldn't mark calendar  Fast forward January  Somehow reminded DeMarco's instantly thought needed try it  bit mad myself forgetting but soon over it  Now ready!  They two styles pizza New York style thin crust square cut thick crust pizza  small serves two people  first time girlfriend tried Di Fara Special which original  see all fuss about  right? liked it  pepperoni AMAZING  more thin crust person but thick crust great texture flavors  size large more enough two it only comes size some tasty leftovers next day!   I've also tried thin crust just pepperoni two specialty pizzas Big Apple White Truffle  thin crust great  Nice foldable exactly it  White Truffle bit oily side but pizza good   haven't anything didn't enjoy  atmosphere great even charge your dying phone bar!  I don't pretend pizza expert anything that  don't know real New York pizza supposed but know like  pizza DeMarco's  don't know if favorite pizza place but definitely top list  <EOR> I recently ordered take order Dom DeMarco's Amazon restaurants since $5 coupon use  Every time PetSmart next door smell deliciousness thought why give try    My boyfriend ended sharing Calamari Mushroom White Truffle pizza without arugula   thought calamari great  little bit soggy but blame delivery person that  really liked marinara sauce came it  4 5 pizza thought tasty but wish would something classic red sauce instead  ended being little dry me  2 5 I would love give place another try but think next time just stop being lazy dine in  <EOR> All right must preface saying never Di Fara's which am ashamed   brother claims best pizza he ever had   perhaps next best thing   If staying Red Rock Resort area piece cake to   If staying strip bit drive but think worth it     The service outstanding    huge inside area well great large patio   bit windy but other all right   We missed Happy Hour which hear great but deal some free apps    delicious Golden Calamari Gram's Meatballs    Mmmm     We spilt whole bunch salads    all delicious    then    bum ba bum    pizza    Aaahhh     The White Truffle must    rich oozing flavor    still good next morning      And course cheese Margherita   Delish!!!  is New York?  No    still don't know why     But damn good    hell yes! <EOR> The pizza good  I'd say solid 3 stars  However manager Frank very rude disrespectful wife because she let know pizza burnt  He made experience very unpleasant  eaten several times however afraid back  managers job treat customers certain level dignity civility respect  He unfortunately displayed none those traits  Local business survives word mouth loyal locals  demeanor led only seek another restaurant but also speak ill place business  <EOR> Garlic Knots Check in? Check  they're really good  Nice couple sauces play Olive Oil based Marinara   way much if you're also getting bread maybe pizza? course  Should stop you? course not    We pretty simple did just great  Yes Cheese Pizza table  pretty much your classic New York Style  super thin but plenty easy fold over if  roll   kitchen seems enjoy making food pizza tasted effortlessly good    I Caesar Salad adding Chicken   totally hit spot  Naw didn't really pick anchovy dressing but still liked lot  Romaine perfectly crisp nice ratio green light colored leaves  much dressing  chicken plentiful good charred nicely grill  chicken wasn't hot seemed prepped ahead time  Still good solid breast meat  Someone table Caesar satisfied  Caprese Salad looked really good report other end table 'YUM'  ya it   Thought trying cannoli but really happy comfortably full  Good service  waiter handled just great friendly confidence everything Dom's  Smallish wine glass selection nothing terribly unusual Hess et al   But very good reasonably priced  Bring family bring honey  <EOR> This place amazing food! twice everything always fantastic  servers all very friendly  <EOR> I held 15 person birthday dinner very impressed! making reservation till leaving service point   Vincent took reservation phone server Joe!

Half Sicilian Cheese pizza fared little bit better but even then nothing compared original Brooklyn   pizza incredibly light airy but little bit oily   wasn't big fan texture crust either   1000000 times better thin but even then something little bit off    ate 2 slices didn't want eat anymore   did reheat next day slightly better but nothing write home about   Disappointed too   The only saving grace meal server   She super nice friendly top everything   wife mentioned birthday passing waitress said did free cannolis your birthday asked if wanted some    Yes yes maam!   cannolis far best part meal!  serve 2 little cannolis which stuffed rich filing accompanied couple raspberries   delicious!
