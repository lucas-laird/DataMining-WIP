Best sushi ever! service great  chefs wait staff friendly courteous  Sushi rolls creative delicious  fish very fresh  favorite sushi fever #3   highly recommend place  often can  Love it! <EOR> How likely following thought would ever run through your head Man could eating AYCE right now ? If your answer moderately highly likely then probably won't fever sushi joint    The attraction AYCE option  don't happy hour specials either  People come creative rolls made ingredients other spicy tuna crab fried shrimp  example several rolls include scallops  rolls average $12  receive complimentary edamame cucumber salad but don't expect any refills those little treats! husband pleading sweet talk into some more edamame but before could even courage waitress came whisked away bowl  No more edamame us!  The atmosphere might phenomenal but actually think sushi bar quite comfortable  Plus sushi chefs particularly friendly helpful  could tell chef concerned culinary experience  He eager find liked he could suggestions  Little did he know when comes sushi we're rather simplistic interested fancy stuff  Although did order roll made cucumber wraps place rice  interesting pretty tasty  other rolls appeared little sloppy but overall fresh flavorful   Side note forever perplexed why restaurants use fake crab especially when charging $12 $15 roll  way telling should order crab?  My conclusion If someone really enjoys creative sushi rolls doesn't mind paying premium over AYCE then might appreciate Sushi Fever  However if think creativity overrated just want stuff your hole rolls should probably take pass  <EOR> This place best sushi restaurants Vegas years years  Every time come food top notch consistently amazing  sushi chefs blast yell hello when come if sit sushi bar chat pretty funny they're always drinking beers sake even early afternoons haha! does crowded sometimes but wait worth it  usuals the Screaming orgasm  Spicy edamame  Rollie rice Literally any sushi roll amazing flavor combinations many choices  <EOR> Service seriously lacking    took 35 minutes lunch negi toro roll philadelphia roll and weren't busy!

Healthy refreshing   NOTE ENDS PORTION REVIEW WHERE DINING EXPERIENCE CONSIDERED NORMAL   Thank you   Upon finishing appetizers friends expected receive entrees within roughly 5 10 minutes  Strangely enough Sushi Fever seemed grounded practice bringing entrees one  Poor Nick chicken teriyaki almost twenty minutes before any other entrees served must've strange nibble twin chicken breasts bit bit rest suppressed appetites  sampled bit miso salad teriyaki came the dish also comes miso soup salad relatively tasty but anything write home about    Ryan next table receive dinner he attempted slow down eating while waiting rest entrees served  gap between arrival entree arrival next two dishes ten minutes did note restaurant appeared picking pace rapidly dinner customers arriving larger parties  Still shouldn't establishments prepared stuff this?  Nevertheless food finally arrived  Crunch Roll somewhat strange presentation almost seemed though roll organized sort jumbled fashion plate sushi positioned shallow plate sweet sauce not quite teriyaki sweet but still sweet nonetheless     Now inevitably you're probably wondering Sushi Fever earned three stars or any stars all rating due almost entirely INSANE FLAVOR SOOSH! all restaurant's shortcomings cannot deny sixteen dollars certainly far way food itself funky presentation Snorlax esque service couldn't upset fact Crunch Roll unforgettable contrast texture Honey Roll offered mellow rich refreshing flavor jolted tastebuds same way Swedish House Mafia's drops jolted eyes into back head around 1 AM Sunday morning  Pure bliss  portion size Honey Roll did leave bit desired however   Our meal took turn Beyond Wonderland however once friend Scott received Chef's Special   entirely sure roll's contents but dish resembled regular sushi roll transplanted hat crabmeat glued top  Looks weren't deceiving day Scott took bite sushi promptly proceeded gag again again HAHAHA   He washed piece sushi down some lemonade friends decided Man Vs  Food moment own sampling choke inducing dish   Oh my   Strange stuff suppose being Filipino really saved today companions each began put most grotesque faces upon sampling Chef's Special  tongue specifically greeted relatively normal sushi flavors undesirable gut punch bitterness not sharp heat wasabi nor unmistakable flavor ginger mind but some awful bitterness   Never again    In any case Sushi Fever hit or miss experience  Kinda Russian Roulette  just gotta know order  <EOR> Sushi Fever favorite sushi place  located right off West Sahara between Buffalo Dr  Cimarron Rd  dining ten years  know sushi consistent taste enjoy casual atmosphere  always sit sushi bar where easy strike conversation strangers  always see others order hear opinions which spurs try something new  When larger parties sit table but same  enjoy interacting sushi chefs often treat them beer sake Kumpai!
