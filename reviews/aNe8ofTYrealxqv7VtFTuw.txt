Clearly didn't miss order much nibbled host provided food   Overall good time I'd certainly return   I'd even reserve space myself future event   Closing bill bit long but likely because server didn't use bar register 10ft away but instead trucked across restaurant sight  <EOR> While still solid place grab drink step typical Nevada bar Sierra Gold used great value decent food lots choices drinks no longer   Unfortunately PTs the parent company seems changed image towards trying upscale bar restaurant rather great locals value made popular  now feels Yard House less choice specials   Whether Sierra Gold PTs Gold whichever happy hour seems no longer cover any better beers pushing local brew domestics  no more half priced Blue Moons me   Additionally fewer fewer options food happy hour  football specials basically dropped all good specials  used double cheeseburger 5 6 dollars  used favorite place watching game no longer even option us   Additionally service generally pretty slow there's very little reason come anymore  <EOR> My first visit Sierra Gold saw loss $40 $20 friend poker machines before anyone ever stopped say hello take order wasn't even busy  certain would take angelic intervention back   While did see some angels second visit none them flying    It Friday happy hour place hoppin' although due large part college reunion group having great time passing happiness rest bar   I ordered half price HH special sausage pepperoni pizza  angel behind bar asked if wanted basil top refreshing suggestion    The pizza crust good crispy but very bland  sauce topping good but would great if just little more sauce  Much chagrin HH special half price pizza actually $10 plus $1 every topping yep charged buck basil   Total damage $15 before tip  crispy thin crust pizza  special rip off    At point foursome having great time angels tended bar some others making way through crowd   place let's say maybe 4 star rating despite some miserable happy hours prices   Then disaster struck happy hour ended angels behind bar replaced pissy young men little sense humor even less personality     The place took dramatic change moods just matter moments all of a sudden couldn't wait out    I leave review shaky 3 star rating some very strong suggestions management reconsider your HH prices rid those depressing boys  Seriously all such pissy mood could literally see happiness evaporating faces patrons all around bar  <EOR> I recently turned 21 couple friends brought first bar happy hour experience  Wooo!
