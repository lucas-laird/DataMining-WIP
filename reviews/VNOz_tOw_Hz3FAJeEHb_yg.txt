Then back   place near movie theater new no sign yet   Find it   it disapoint! <EOR> This very tough review write  trip Pyaar good thing say restaurant owners some nicest most accommodating people could hope meet  Unfortunately really didn't meal here   It should also noted review ONLY dinner buffet possible ala carte menu ordering produce different experience   Anyway when wife discovered new Indian restaurant opening town pleased but news would feature Indian DINNER buffet over moon  night owls nature during vacation times weekends aren't always ready time lunch buffet chance dinner option Indian buffet sounded perfect   Tonight no expectations  $9 99 per person dinner seemed good deal although surprised Naan purchased separately it's usually included buffet first time seen extra    The selection small ran into immediate problems  sure if synonymous particular cuisine Pyaar aims claim The only North South Mogul Indian restaurant Vegas but surprised presence couple beef dishes lack any real main dish vegetarians nothing all nice sauces come expect Indian food    No Paneer dish no Chicken Tikka Masala Chicken Makhani no samosas no pakora no kofta any sort   ended only two tandoori chicken drumsticks some very wet chilli beef some vegetable curry lot rice   The tandoori chicken fine if unspectacular I'd OK eat write off notch belt but somewhere wanted visit again but unfortunately rest tandoori thighs which don't like  chilli beef tasted generic beef stew bit chilli powder added potatoes OK ish but bit hard vegetable curry   My vegetarian wife fared even worse ending some chick peas bit potato top bed basmati rice   By time Naan which tasted flour tortilla arrived realised nothing mop no dish featuring any delicious gravies come associate Indian food   Around 3 minutes into meal wife pretended receive urgent phone call apologised asked check  owners felt bad extremely nice offering let fill boxes buffet waived cost Naan    Now perhaps different type Indian cuisine just personal taste but really didn't buffet all  feel bad having pan place harshly because really liked owners but hope if read review consider some changes buffet because right now uninspired bordering inedible  <EOR> Best priced Indian Food Vegas  only open week having some trouble oven naan wasn't great  food way salty but otherwise great first week    Their chef used work Gaylord Indian Rio surprised dishes tasted very different Gaylord    bad different just different   Harold owner great person chat service outstanding   I give them another chance few days see if kinks worked out  see giving more stars next time  <EOR> A true Vintage Vegas spectacle    Go Friday Saturday nights 7 Indian food live jazz trio belly dancing occasional impromptu performances Al  singing chef    He's only chef but also owner  he does KILLER Louis Armstrong impersonation  true MUST SEE     Food pretty good  lunch buffet small but liked everything tried  Nan extra  which made lunch buffet $9  bad  ESPECIALLY considering entertainment  <EOR> Very strange dining experience   coupon not Groupon sent owner off into tizzy problems he company   think $25 off coupon purchased but according supposed $25 off $50   He claimed company's fault but think maybe he misunderstood concept Groupon like sites   He did honor but felt bad guy using it   The food pretty good though   But all bit overpriced without coupon doubt stopping back there  <EOR> This restaurant just opened 3 days ago some glitches service bit shaky because two people trying serve tables orders mixed bit   both lunch dinner buffets   Lunch $7 99 dinner $9 99   weekend buffet $11 99 don't know if anything different weekends more expensive   I buffet wife Saag Chicken   dish very good   She asked spicy all   some spiciness but she could live good she growing tastes   buffet good except major glitch which soon smoothed out   Something happened heated water under steamers some food cooled somewhat before back piping hot   won't remember all dishes but vegetable samosa spicy lentil dish chana masala aloo palak jeera rice chicken korma tandoori chicken chili beef gulab jamon   Except temperature issue buffet food quite good   tried some dishes never all good   gulab jamon outstanding first time dessert   One issue order garlic nan   no garlic   mixup orders   He deleted amount bill   We returning close home take too     The brochure syas live music karaoke Thursday through Sunday   owner promised play something but he busy helping out   small suite Village Square Plaza few doors east Regal Cinemas next door Coldstone Creamery store   Capacity rated 65 people small place   If website download menu Excel spreadsheet  <EOR> First off   the set beautiful  Great atmosphere even good 3 piece jazz band playing when walked in   expecting something great newly opened Indian restaurant but when miss placed order 2 items ordered food mundane   Although extremely disappointed service quality food since staff extremely apologetic setting impressive thinking may give place second chance  Maybe  <EOR> I excited Indian place close try it! menu many things choose     they even Chinese food Indian twist  really tempted try but thought should stick Indian dishes first  started off Blueberry Lassi which really delicious compared Bollywood's Mango Lassi  liked better because could tell made fresh blueberries texture  friend Sharr ordered different items sample more dishes  ordered Beef Biriyani Tandoori Chicken sizzler Garlic Naan  Beef Biriyani good inside where all beef spices but outside white rice  used having spices spread throughout   would say Bollywood's Briyani better because spices spread through  whole dish curry sauce serve side it  impressed Tandoori Chicken sizzler    anything sizzles plate gets instantly excited  never Tandoori before nothing compare but thought tasty! Garlic Naan flavorful pre cut before served  thought service very thoughtful  lady took order knew sharing chicken she split into two plates  I'd love come back when live entertainment sample other items menu  <EOR> I came Pyaar roundabout way  see asked hotel desk clerk if he menu Thai restaurant around corner Archi's   He said he did but changed name something else  He fussed around drawer not drawers would weird said handed menu Pyaar   I knew right away Indian cuisine Thai cuisine   funny way   While enjoyed being curried away both food distinctly different   Anyone even slight foodie going confuse Thai food Indian food   So decided check them both out  decided Indian instead Thai   I only restaurant  tried ordering several things struck assortment We're  He only during day Hint don't put dinner menu    I opted order several small things  started veggie samosa followed some gobi paratha go   rasmalai   I really liked samosa   gobi paratha pretty good nice robust grainy bread   The rasmalai dessert was   interesting   Very sweet   Overall pretty solid Indian nice people reasonable prices   And Sanford Son tube when left   Too old school me  <EOR> Harold greeted helped navigate extensive menu  He very charming funny intent showing good time  ordered chicken tikka masala Chana daal rice aloo paratha  food excellent very reasonable  Harold sang Frank Sinatra Louie Armstrong tune  fun  restaurant large strip mall off street  Worth search! <EOR> I tried dine 11 15 Tuesday but weren't open yet even though hours posted claimed opened 11 00 am  <EOR>
