Better some other waits Starbucks Coffee Bean   The bagel itself all right  lot flavor but still edible  cheese equally distributed throughout sandwich but oh well  grabbed some mustard mayo packets way add sandwich which I'd recommend if condiments  <EOR> I didn't expect much airport bagel shop but bagels truly awful  Vegas Sunshine Lox bagel  bagels soggy even going through toaster  bland lox bagel mountain tasteless cream cheese spread literally more cream cheese bagel  man making bagels wasn't nicest either  <EOR>
