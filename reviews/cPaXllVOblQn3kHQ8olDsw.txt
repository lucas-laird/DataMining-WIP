We came I95 Stratosphere since couldn't criss Las Vegas Blvd due marathon   Passed since expecting lit sign but luckily partner really good eye sight  signage 4 foot banner    Place looked closed but sign flashing open   Once stepped older Thai gentleman approached greeted us  He also turned set lights   very busy place  Now know why!   My partner ordered two Thai teas boba! Came back no boba gentleman did mention wasn't any more boba when he served drink  Now firm believer if items menu need steady supply establishment  tall glass bad sweet!  I ordered combination shrimp chicken pad Thai no onions since partner allergic  Flavor portion size just right price  creamier most pad Thai ever though   Soyp salad never made table  Then chicken wings came  ordered sweet chili sauce partner spicy sweet basil  heat level seven  Chicken wings dry  double dip mine sauce just swallow meat jerky  partners wings flavoured perfectly but still dry side   7 wing sections tossed sauce sweet chili drunken chili sweet basil cup rice  Thr flier given garlic pepper another sauce didn't see store menu  Ten minutes sat another 3 finally older gentleman came handed check!  What? asked if another order thinking all eat! Boy shocked when said flier expired  pretty much paid $9 95 7 wings cup rice? $7 95 store menu but add $2 more tofu chicken $3 more shrimp  does that? if I'd pay $7 95 would served cup rice sauce top shredded cabbage? If would known I'd just hamburger hut! live North Vegas wouldn't any inconvenience  would 10 wings $8 99 half container full fries soaked sauce juicy  Guess  why trying support local businesses!  Never trust restaurant no customers!  If weren't older Thai gentleman I'd gave place 1 star!  Someone mentioned shrimp pad Thai jumbo size let's fool anyone else only 31 40 peeled deveined tail on  Jumbo would considered langostine size would cost more $15 dish $7 95! Just saying!
