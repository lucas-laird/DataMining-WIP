The decor modern contemporary flair which really nice  also Panda Tea Bar serves drinks just boba tea shop    I gave try usual which Almond Milk Green Tea Honey Boba  Boba made perfectly! Soft chewy  drink however really sweet!! good but way sweet  need take easy sugar  <EOR> Downtown Summerland location  dinner around 5 30pm Tuesday Did hardly any food available  food case old dried out  A mostly empty case should full ready sell  left regular location  <EOR> I've several Panda Express' through years all them expect Panda Express  craving Panda decided while Downtown Summerlin  first time location quite pleased see long tables could seat groups 8 10 people    I ordered usual steamed veggies Beijing beef    With scoop left steamed veggies sitting serving pan automatically made fresh batch instead adding last scoop plate  didn't ask if wanted last scoop They just told would fresh batch would 5 minute wait  I'd rather some freshly cooked veggies really really appreciated that! read mind    The service women creating plates definitely better other Panda Express to  crowd rolled right ordered least 10 people behind me  great keeping line moving    When cashier usually ask water  But noticed Panda Tea Bar menu! location tea bar! first time seen Panda Tea Bar decided try it  scanned menu noticed variety milk teas fruit teas lemonades shakes smoothies Vietnamese coffee sea salt cream lot more choose from! There's also options choose your sweetness level toppings type tea  ordered Thai Tea boba 25% sweetness  bad! amount boba added good amount  happy it    I wait few more minutes steamed veggies but didn't mind because girl helping updated every few minutes  quite pleased customer service  most Pandas service always okay  But kicked notch while busy  quite impressed that    When finally tasted veggies Beijing beef delicious  happy it   This no where near where live but all amazing service restaurants shops Downtown Summerlin considering moving area  definitely back Panda Express  <EOR> Love location  food always seems much more fresh here  Other locations sometimes end end batch  sitting but food consistent  Service fast friendly restaurant bathrooms very clean  mall employee end popping often  also few tables outside which nice when weathers hot  <EOR> Monday night pretty packed which surprised because weekday  Panda Express short staffed but employee name Aleks made it  Though little wait some other customers didn't patience Aleks kept smile face good attitude  When he charged food he apologized wait gave 10% discount waiting  expected wait saw busy unbothered but Aleks kept all customers mind moved sense urgency lot more patience customers though he doing most work  only picture hard would shoes  Thank much Aleks! <EOR> When eats Panda does expect food taste anything more Panda  fast food its core should never graded anything more like local business per se   being said grade fast food based quality service specific Panda Express location definitely stepped plate    Upon entering presents himself entirely different atmosphere compared other Panda locations  building itself clean  Very clean  Every time someone left even if place empty would hurriedly duty wipe empty table clean case next customer wanted perhaps sit there    The interior design  Sleek modern neutral colors everywhere black brown white single eye popping red ascertain one's eyes menu  personally choice chandeliers all spherical round avoid making everything look blocky    But enough interior decor let's talk service    When entered shop greeted nice confident young woman patiently let sample almost every single dish menu before choosing choice 3 sides  due fact long since companions visited Panda generally forgot what's good good  being case women did even look least bit annoyed! If she she didn't show it  Haha  Very patient understanding!  As ordered food served plentiful  don't remember Panda food before but remember sizes portions stingy especially when comes shrimp! However lady served much food platter looked overflowing  She even brought food waited seat    One cool addition Panda Tea Bar  don't know if every location maybe if just outdated but never knew Panda Express made boba! course shouldn't order expecting boba pearls completely fresh milk tea taste anything original but is  nice alternative those don't want normal fountain drinks others don't always want water cups    4 stars Panda! <EOR> This updated review   At night food service mediocre best but daytime crew tall handsome guy bangin ' !!   The food much better day time  love little Boba bar well    Now manager reached however never reached back restaurant  again own accord since neighborhood bank right well     My kid loves Panda does chef brother     I haven't back night but day time crew going on!      1st Review        I am sick going into location late night employees distributing inedible dry disgusting food keeping because 10 15 closing soon ?
