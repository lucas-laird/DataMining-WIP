You Panda Express RIGHT ACROSS STREET 3X more pay less  Seriously chow mein $12 comes little to go box?! HIGHWAY ROBBERY! didn't even taste GREAT!  I home realized didn't even pack utensils napkin  Miffed      I should known when took look menu  <EOR> Generic food horrible service  Within 40 minutes once did water refill any sort service  Food generic  Probably won't back ever  <EOR> Horrible service  came late dinner last night  When walked waiter opened menus laid them counter said take time asked if we'd some water  told we'd sit down sit down restaurant no intention getting food go  ordered while waiting another elderly couple came immediately seated normal  received food before offered drinks besides water but  even complaint  40 minutes waiter brought food boxes! Never once did say meal think pretty obvious wanted sit eat! absolutely obnoxious really don't understand why treated way  said food very good  But never returning because poor service  <EOR> Love restaurant! two favorite Chinese restaurants Las Vegas area! Everything very good  especially love shredded chicken salad  world! wonderful dressing seasoning never anywhere else before  definitely recommend place!! <EOR> Great food great prices love place  old fashion everything super fresh hand made  <EOR> This old school Vegas  Hadn't very long time because actually just forgotten still when moved surrounding area   You 5 star quality side table service    The Mai Tai good  Didn't realize much alcohol put until crept later    Food fresh really tasty    Shrimp Won Tons most places serve imitation crab normally can't find place serve good quality won tons anymore  crunchy delicious  greasy most places   Chicken Salad peanuts good but whole meal would last list reorder  Peanuts all could taste    Chicken Lettuce wraps overpowered sauce crunchy but again would probably put item second last    The Strawberry chicken brought back good memories  Just remember childhood  still crisp outside even smothered strawberry sauce  fork going through didn't turn mush good job balancing crisp outside while still plenty sauce    All time favorite Am Lee Beef!!! Can't describe words good    My first time eating Generals Chicken wasn't disappointed    Ambiance more old school feeling  Doesn't seem modernized but least nostalgia feeling old times when in  falling apart just old vibe it  <EOR> Simply best Chinese restaurant Las Vegas  coming almost 20 years never disappoints  favorite dishes lettuce wraps bbq pork dumplings ruby beef spicy chicken sweet spicy shrimp       A+++++++ <EOR> Even Am Lee around long time but authentic  real Chinese cuisine Itis more American version Chinese food  Even though restaurant uses quality meat dishes food taste terrible I am disappointed  Apart food expensive  mind paying food long good   If place see many Asian person eat only American no offence love place  <EOR> One best Chinese restaurants Henderson  Modest decor great service best food  also full bar   Just Scallops Snow peas entree authentic Peking Duck  Both superlative   The Scallops some best ever eaten period  Pea pods prepared just right  Light sauce   Peking Duck Crispy exterior tender meaty ample 1 2 Duck  Pork bun rolls perfectly steamed served fresh greens Plum sauce   Amlee keeper  <EOR> Wow!  First time coming locals   Very friendly service very clean food delicious!  recommend locals try Amlee Chinese Cuisine   5 stars!  Thank Amlee Chinese Cuisine  <EOR> I finally found place great Chinese food  noticed some other reviews mentioned place being pricey  don't does say gourmet sign front  Sure inside completely dated but still class owner herself comes table serve each plate  She even prepared salad ordered fresh front us  food isn't greasy anyway which id w hat find most places too  portion food price very good  would suggest because if portion sizes plan sharing your table taking leftovers home  Nothing cold Chinese food lunch next day!   I ordered Szechuan Beef could easily eaten whole dish if weren't sharing others because good  meat tender very good  rarely eat rabbit food but did think cool prepared right front us  vegetable fried rice tasted perfect  wife thought could use more flavor but she also likes soy sauce whatever  service really awesome left full satisfied  Coming back sure  Call ahead order take if don't want dine inside  <EOR> EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Recommended  Food high quality venue some ambiance prices bit off putting   I hit venue late shift weekday open until 10pm  meaning try place since first noticed when patronizing smoke shop next door   This call 'wok u ' take out joint bone fide sit down restaurant  space nicely appointed  breath taking upscale but quite nice entirely date worthy  Wax white butcher paper over white tablecloth  My thinking if Chinese restaurant white tablecloths doesn't want change them every meal then should clear plexiglass top   easy clean tablecloth still display   check pictures others posted verify attractiveness venue if wish   As mentioned other Yelpers greeter server natural knack enhancing experience soft spoken kindness thoughtfulness    The space almost entirely empty during visit  guess even though quality meal very high prices interfering dinner traffic  Sweet sour pork steamed rice dinner entrée $16 95  Upgrade fried rice $6  Egg rolls $6 95  Soups $4 $6  starter drink tip $35 per person here  therein one star ding   But beef meal extraordinarily tender     both entrée soup seasoned quite tasty indeed  quality certainly bears much pricing  Service higher end entrée rolled cart server placed initial portion plate me  Don't see many Chinese restaurants any more!  The place certainly quiet enough afford dinner conversation over your table meal  quite surprised but no complaint soft ambient music     well described Top disco hits 1978  Haven't yet but looks though lunch best bet $8 $10 add buck seafood options includes soup egg roll fried rice    CONCLUSIONS again recommended  Good food fawning service attractive venue  Lunch     dinner lovely lady companion     appear best fit dining here  am sure return  <EOR> Great service delicious food  Cannot come BBQ pork  lean fresh made house! Ask your server  <EOR> Affordable prices tend associated Chinese food however case Amlee Chinese Cuisine  If weren't ridiculously expensive prices would definitely come more often because find quite challenging find delicious Chinese food Las Vegas area   They put twist some dishes  Some menu items beyond traditional Chinese food items  instance duck isn't prepared roasted peking style breaded  sauce comes duck good sweet tangy hoisen sauce which made great compliment dish  kind feel food leans toward more Americanized palate rather OG Chinese which don't wrong isn't bad  sure specialties leaned more toward since very knowledgeable difference between cantonese mandarin dishes but quality superb    Everytime opportunity dine hasn't busy  don't want place business because few Chinese places valley would dine at  Maybe location prices deter people coming but hope service food least food outweigh prices   Great place dine least isn't most expensive Chinese food joint similar quality flair pleasure dining it  <EOR> Great lunch specials excellent service!  Our friends love place all met nice lunch! just say service phenomenal   moment walking door until check paid everyone polite friendly   several ladies kept close eye table which all great!   I tried Kung Pao Prawns lunch special   Great portion size delicious! Spicy but overpowering spice   loved it   lunches come soup white fried rice egg roll     The dining area clean plenty seating   great lunch great friends! <EOR> Met friends dinner  Quiet quaint shopping center  Looks deceiving   in  Had pupu appetizers  Everything great  greasy   Full bar but warm sake   Snap peas beef cooked perfection  Crunchy peas melt your mouth beef  Strawberry chicken different take orange chicken     think  But pungent more smooth  liked it  Singapore noodles favorite did disappoint! Service perfect!  I back! located Hendersen but worth drive  <EOR> I think somewhat decent person   completely horrifying experience Amlee decided give another shot   figured maybe having bad day workers having bad day wasn't fair judge them solely bad experience   inspired someone's posting picture Amlee's general chicken which looked absolutely delicious   So decided order lunch special disguising voice over phone wouldn't recognized asshole didn't tip last time thereby prompting them spit food    When arrived pick Asian owner there   She much nicer all smiles she even offered extra rice without asking !!!    Which think maybe she saw earlier review     which case sorry called bitch   The general chicken pretty good  much better strawberry chicken  tried last time   decided bump review 3   See happens when you're nice your customers? <EOR> Prices higher compared other Chinese places even moreso quality being its just simple Chinese restaurant   I ordered Half Peking duck = $19 Cup egg drop soup = $5  The pecking duck came steamed buns my favorite! but weren't good enough coming back   did love took all bones off duck though able eat hearts content   egg drop soup was    Ehhh   could've made better home   This place convenient during visit but could better value elsewhere   soft spot underdog but prices just didn't seem reasonable  <EOR> PF Cares    We really enjoyed food experience    read several complaints price just want bring old adage pay obvious quality ingredients use high quality   don't know possible beef tender literally  melts your mouth   flavor great!  service top notch water never even close being empty server Denise very pleasant attentive      family 6 4 adults 2 teenagers ordered several entrees shared family style   serving sizes good every item ordered spot on   loved unlike other Chinese restaurants Amlee's cuisine isn't greasy  Anyway     all enjoyed all would recommend it  <EOR> The food forgettable  Kung pao chicken togo food very bland  prices ok lunch specials but dinner way expensive quality getting  would suggest trying if lunch first if find something menu but definitely pricey dinner  <EOR> The food good all  good service  tossed chicken salad horrible  Iceberg lettuce little bits cilantro fried shredded chicken pieces some crunchy things  dressing made lot oil maybe some mustard   family also chow mein made panada express look dam good  also almond chicken came some brown gravy  all never back  Chinese group didn't even eat Chinese food steak  <EOR> The creamy shrimp soup absolute must have   Everything else good but little expensive your average Chinese restaurant   Staff always friendly  <EOR> This place never lets down  Great food impeccable service   We Amlee beef prawns lobster sauce pork fried rice   And best Mai Tais course  <EOR> They delicious selection food  Try strawberry chicken sounds unusual but yet find someone dislikes it  <EOR> After 15 years living Las Vegas having tried insane number Chinese restaurants given hope finding old favorite Almond Chicken  recently thought dish once again    decided give another search  BEHOLD!
