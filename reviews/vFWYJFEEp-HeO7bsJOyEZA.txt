Lol  Now let's talk food   wasn't impressed   First round * Stuffed Dates never seen such huge dates which wasn't good thing situation! much blue cheese where  all tasted!! * Mango Chicken dish grilled chicken some type mango salsa  Bland no special flavor some type kick it  * Crab Cake liked dish three! look weird because looked hamburger party but crab chunky sauce paired really well! Although much better crab cakes good!  Second ordered Buffalo Chicken Wings  They good but fried chicken added buffalo sauce   CAN'T mess up! 5 decent sized wings much buffalo sauce side ranch!   Lastly we blame alcohol having order more food ordered Meatball Sliders Shrimp Ceviche  * Meatballs tasted something those frozen ones  Plus really small size bun chose  meatballs waaay bigger made real ground beef! * ceviche came Tostitos nacho chips  good amounts shrimp  say least ok    OVERALL Food mediocre bland   Drinks drinks nothing special    bartender really friendly funny attentive! ¯\_ ? _ ¯ <EOR> Great pub just east strip   Megan best bartenders Las Vegas she take great care you   Stop visit enjoy great food drinks service   Loose slots bar actually pay off  <EOR> My girl because groupon while visiting over weekend   yelped gave try   The vibe suggests place locals preferred bar as off strip which kinda weird because everyone vegas  transplant decendent but digress     The fellow patrons seemed older regulars weren't happy smoke drink play video poker constantly   We greeted but didn't feel good bartender talked phone waited order  tried find table sit outside difficulty finding table didn't wobble bad if hit table your beer would surely fall over  also few tables broken point where could really hurt  back inside 2 tries finally found table didn't wobble bad   I returned bar order second round then ordered bacon wrapped dates  When dish brought bartender seemed made pleasuring attempt interacting us  He told bar food seemed personality  he even mentioned he Midwest   We then ordered garlic fries  angus cheeseburger sliders      They good  recommend them   the bacon wrapped dates  not much   They 13 flat screens while patronizing happened catch Michael Jackson Hollogram thingy   Two other female visitors arrived dressed non locals said fuck shit   lets distressed non greeting come your own drinks greet attitude bartender  understood!!!
