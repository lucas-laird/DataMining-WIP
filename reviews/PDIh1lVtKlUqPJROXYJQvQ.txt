<EOR> It's most wonderful time year  No Christmas but  good too  restaurant week Las Vegas  year restaurant week two weeks summer  say prefer when week spring week fall  Even yelper trouble many expensive rich meals two week period   But gonna take team many restaurants can   started fix Bellagio main casino    thing restaurant very awkwardly set up  There's lot space move around surroundings very     small   thought initially service would good   But when finally decided wine restaurant week meal server took absolutely ever bottle conundrum    tuna appetizer excellent  Certainly best thing meal   Now appetizer would normally cost $21  Because part restaurant week three course meal only three pieces but quite satisfied it  served crispy rice very good   steak excellent always ask medium rare right served bed creamy potatoes   Dessert brown butter cake quite good  only choice dessert restaurant week menu   If something didn't something complain but really did dessert   All all good start restaurant week but if going back when wasn't restaurant week would likely think little pricey  <EOR> My boyfriend recently came promotion dinner celebration  located far back into casino Bellagio right near Yellowtail  location quaint but cute  sort upscale trendy feel without being over top   After reading through menu online really excited try place but most food just kinda meh me  start shared tuna app  very good loved plating dish  balances hot cold interesting tasty way   For entree kale salad which pretty disappointed with  flavor very bland wasn't nearly enough dressing  boyfriend's steak other hand very tasty  loved blue cheese topping sauces came it  also shared mac n cheese bites seeing other rave reviews them  honestly did impress all wish bit more spice zing them  flavor sauce paired bites themselves just kind washed each other out    Of course treated ourselves dessert well  s'mores jar which pretty tasty but necessarily anything unique special   Overall glad checked place but don't think we'd come back unless some  new exciting changes menu  <EOR> I cannot say enough good things food here  surf turf exceptional cocktails die for!
