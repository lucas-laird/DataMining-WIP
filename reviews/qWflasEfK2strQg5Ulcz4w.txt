When first moved Vegas all wanted place find some familiar faces  boyfriend started playing pool few days week  bartenders learned names drinks made sure pool table open us   The people gave little spot feel home moving across country everyone know   The changes management shaky not sure what's going but love Dan but everyone continues remember show kindness won't leaving any time ! <EOR> First time visit no expectations but pleasantly surprised  menu small but your basic bar food selection's  draft craft beers which plus book! Wings go to's Wing Queen try hot wings  made them extra wet per request very pleased heat level portion size wings fries seasoned well  boyfriend Fried Chicken slider's which he liked however needed some sort sauce compliment bit dry  Nevertheless back! <EOR> While bartenders usually great owner's policies HORRIBLE  gambling over $170 having four shots which now served thimble club soda handed tab two four $13  Forget Stewart done your crappy customer service  would rather bars where bartenders actually allowed real gaming bartenders  Another point Stewart if staff turn over your locations consistently HIGH new every three weeks maybe time owner reevaluate your policies  <EOR> Worst service ever received  bartender drunk no idea any drinks shots wanted  He look them phone still tasted nothing supposed to  bartenders waitresses ignored pretty much entire night  When finally took order told ran pitchers  sorry what? You're bar ran pitchers? Wow!! Never again return bar give local bars bad name  <EOR> The bartenders friendly atmosphere very local friendly  nice able spot very little no drama <EOR> This review stems sampling food Bite Las Vegas take worth  They offered sliders tent Jameson glazed burger slider w onions Philly slider  came fresh VERY tasty  quality good def interested going full dining experience  Def worth checking food! <EOR> Wow   I won't waste time EVER AGAIN   plenty places actually appreciate your business   wish could give ZERO stars   They pushed away last spring when hung kickball   it poorly run staff horrible   think drank lot but didn't gamble!

I frequented bar 05 07 when living area    The bar gone down hill over years! There's never more 10 customers place    Just judging experience tonight won't return while!   To begin 5 00pm    3 beers which came almost $20 000   several bars area run $3 00 happy hour deal  Within 5 miles   When first walked bar tender busy doing shots customers guy seemed manager come order  new person felt very un welcomed!
