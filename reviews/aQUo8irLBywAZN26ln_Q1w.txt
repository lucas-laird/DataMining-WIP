Love place! Everyone should experience Wild if haven't already! Great food drinks sure ask Sarah behind bar she always takes good care <EOR> I thought would better but decor best part place   Its clean trendy inside   ordered veggie pizza portion crust perfect but zero flavor   No flavor sauce no flavor anywhere except lemonade   Service friendly but didn't check enough  <EOR> The vibe pretty nice but say food quality less average   I've never thought flatbread Prosciutto marinara basil wrong this  won't waste time describing details but simply wasn't tasty  Also pasta only greasy but pasta overcooked   It typical tastes worse looks kind experience   What bummer  <EOR> I only give reviews two reasons  happens good reason!! place little hidden gem   Amazing!! Everything staff the wild wall thoughtful questions coasters  food amazing   and top off its organic gluten free!! I'll back! <EOR> They think pretty highly themselves  Lots gluten free stuff which ok  But kinda overpriced IMO  Paying location atmosphere vs  originality sustenance  tried but  probably far go   Note staff very friendly accommodating but very forgetful  <EOR> This place amazing  good perfect gluten free dough pasta light  perfectly full don't feel disgusting eating Italian food  Also bartenders very friendly  Sarah best customer service made sure happy entire time  She even remembered face order when returned  recommend asking Sarah if sit bar area  <EOR> Superb totally gluten free place Vegas!

The only reason gave 3 star because when twice forgot order wait twice long which already dimmed mood eat  Service really important me  understand happens but twice same reason? <EOR> Very sad owners Wild taking restaurant different direction    don't believe struggling location problem menu   food great some nice vegan options enjoy    the problem seemed marketing signage  Time tell if plant based eating friends family  able continue enjoy restaurant not  really hope don't turn into another subpar bar food restaurant  <EOR> Yes please!

Great vibe decor great food great service  If lived Vegas would back often! But alas    <EOR> I really wanted Wild but 3 visits over past month just cannot commit anything other two stars   surface love restaurant's decor   Digging deeper into service food both which matters most something just isn't right here   All three times dined sat bar as often do while service decent pleasant almost seems if winging it   of which would expect given first venture into restaurant bar world   would think service processes would better dialed time open your third establishment   Case point visits placed order entree later told selection sold    deciding upon something else later told initial dish available detriment person ordered prior me   What!?!  While appreciate offer seems odd would accept someones order then take away give someone else   Maybe seemed more important maybe more needy nevertheless awkward position both sides equation   On food menu opinion quite limited   essentially few flatbreads few pasta dishes choose from all which seemingly gluten free   Here's issue population requires gluten free what? 1 5% depending upon which study reference?  feel happening owner s choosing offer enjoy while sacrificing wants larger demographic could dining location    good business model feel need change menu more offerings else shuttering business immanent  just don't see targeted demographic supporting venture long term   last meal pasta dish name escapes me pasta very overcooked  While ingredients seemed high quality flavorful ruined overcooked pasta   If pasta two dishes offer ought able prepare properly   The ambiance way decorated place levels natural wood steel soft indirect lighting   that all fits style   disapprove arguably most uncomfortable bar stools posterior ever on   Logic and business acumen dictates more comfortable guest longer stick around eat drink   well  just cards chairs stools   friend both work long hours came meal few beers cocktails closing shop evening   Well unfortunately plan overruled uncomfortableness encountered   ended eating meals door immediately find more comfortable accommodations unwind at shame both your bottom line   Other musings Low quality bar towels sufficient substitute napkin   First low quality bar towels very lint ridden second coarse third cheapen experience   Invest proper napkins both white black   if need know why close doors now   Bar towels staff clean your patron's lap wipe face hands with   I may give Wild another chance six months but surely won't rushing back anytime soon  <EOR> When eat normally avoid healthy places but when friend really wanted stick diet figured perfect place downtown   WILD situated inside Ogden high rise off Ogden Not Las Vegas Blvd    There wide variety pizza but attracted Chicken Tikka Masala Pasta   few reviews complained blandness which something scared of   While pasta didn't noticeable sauce well seasoned chicken full flavor   would guessed gluten free   I hoping try smoothies juices but waiter said unavailable on Sat night??      The atmosphere great very hipster expect downtown rough wooden tables neat light fixtures   floor ceiling windows great people watching people walk El Cortez Gold Spike     I recommend health freaks don't want drive Greens Proteins over Eastern 215! <EOR> Absolutely delicious! two friends while hanging downtown Saturday night  No wait compared 1 hour wait Le Thai   geez My friends both Green Giant not sure exact name cocktail gin kale juice surprisingly super yummy  Short but nice beer list  soup special carrot ginger thick tasted just fresh carrot tasty  quinoa salad nicely plated good well  Tikka Masala pizza   I recommend enough frickin good! personal pizza but could easily share it  Wild White pizza really good herb mushroom pasta didn't even taste gluten free   Our server Amanda really nice super attentive too  <EOR> Staying downtown area July 4th weekend  Decided try Wild glad did  Really good food they also bar   fig salad ahi tuna burger very delicious healthy  Atmosphere nice  Service attentive nice too  Menu limited but site check out  forewarned think only street parking oven roasted chicken menu only available 5p   This place worth try  check if area! Definitely would again  <EOR> With successful locations NYC Williamsburg expected best pizza side Mississippi but unfortunately dealt arguably worst meal LV past 4 5 months  minute takeout order brought kitchen knew trouble  Here's rundown eats     Chicken Tikka Masala Pasta $16 Take away creamy goodness masala sauce take away any resemblance chicken imagine yourself eating dry leftover spaghetti few days before  Voilá! made dish your mind  Tamest masala side Bombay  Nothing against pasta itself hating lack gluten hating lack chicken sauce flavor    Chana Masala Personal Pizza $13 Take generic flatbread buy Walgreens add box frozen chana masala TJ's minus most flavor bit tomato sauce some mozz cheese then cook toaster but take few minutes before ready  Voilá! again made dish your mind! Seriously isn't 'dough' 'homemade specialty' house? When pizza thin isn't supposed crunchy? Why does taste someone made Home Ec class    C ?   And yes ordered two Indian style dishes American pizza place  But large menu  expecting fresh sushi diner  area way better your money    While waiting food overheard some people wondering why place empty most time  'It's side street!' said  No friends  all above    Why 2 stars instead 1? place looks pretty slick  Would def brew bar  <EOR> I came into WILD gym dinner bar  salad ordered came fairly quickly while pizza took half hour  liked smoked tofu salad but dressing sour  ingredients pizza worked really well together but much lemon vinaigrette top which overpowered goat cheese caramelized onions  <EOR> Newly gluten free person    I literally clapping hands jumping down 5 year old when friend told place!
