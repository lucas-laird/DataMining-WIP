But then again wasn't taking car bombs guys other side bar  Very professional  down street Pts instead  seem value customers bit more  <EOR> Use great bar  Still great bartenders but new management really drove good locals  Machines now tight food comps gone wish Old Lodge <EOR> Place used fun good food  depressing crap food news flash maybey change grease fryer once year your fries don't taste fishy usually less 3 people spot still take 15 min per drink  sucks becouse its walking distance home  <EOR> Food great staff great but really should clean chandeliers above bar <EOR> Ok food toilet homeless leftover   actually asked throw burger fries away decided take me   wings cold someone back decided pour ton salt top them    beer stail  But    Stewart      the owner     needs ass whooped   he use quality establishments across valley    must say Bryan awsome   best bartender   he's wasting talents morgue sad ass place  <EOR> The menu on line NOTHING restaurant's menu  food good diner food  Service little slow past lunch but before dinner  Able accommodations ordered items without drama  <EOR> First time location crowd kinda weird but attentive friendly bartender!

He made sure drinks perfect THANKS AGAIn! <EOR> Oh boy! health code nightmare   If doesn't bother then food good     Three lunch   only table dining room   bartender server standing bar eating sandwich   She would come over table practically still chewing when shot look way   People smoking isn't division between dining bar????  cook brought food quite while   never saw anyone wash hands   bartender would stop eating serve someone drink back leaning bar eating sandwich   other bartender bust getting cigarettes vending machine   Yowsa!  All aside food good your average bar food   Good fries     If think all laugh into kind extreme casual atmosphere then would bar   lots advertised specials free mimosas sunday brunch $1 taco nights  <EOR> This sucks because usually never write reviews let alone negative ones  But first everything  sure everyone own experience but would challenge manager anyone contact regarding simplistic issue   I'm very familiar chain visit often am Vegas local same industry  11 35am Dec 15th order steak eggs meal special request cheese mixed inside eggs just layed top  made request several locations other then every restaurant general matter just Lodge  bartender places order but once comes explains cook said he only lay top because he doesn't want burn pans cheese  LOL I couldn't I then asked bartender cook come explain because statement just doesnt sense me  mention should've stated before bringing food offering another option  She then back comes says he probably wont come but he said he only 1 pan left doesn't want take risk ruining it  Once again couldn't if tried! then stated mixing cheese eggs would never ruin pan! Common sense Although she the bartender comped meal looking sum delicious cheese eggs free meal! end day wouldn't return location but still others Absurd disrespectful would few ways describe experience    Btw bartender great could tell she felt bad kitchens decisions but hands tied  <EOR> Former F B Director San Diego Las Vegas  Friendly staff   Bill Bartender Tammy server incredibly efficient friendly  Other service staff come across very courteous   definitely hired right people  Keep good work  Doug <EOR> I found stellar jalapeno burger here! burger meaty juicy   comes salsa but chose left off  husband same burger salsa super messy! can't stand messy burgers  always salsa side but thought burger spicy enough without it  <EOR> I've couple Lodge's town great  impromptu dinner request hang friend recently moved back into town Lodge Hualapai choice  came sat down bartender waitress super sweet patient  bar itself sort busy crazy but nice   Our party couldn't stop talking catching took second put order she no problem checking getting drinks awesome attitude    We ended ordering Lodge burger w cheese $8 plus another $1 cheese Pastrami Reuben sandwich $10 Patty Melt sandwich sourdough $10 Grilled cheese sandwich tomato bisque $7   order came relativity quickly although told Grilled Cheese luke warm almost cold Patty Melt good but lot onion Reuben good well but also slightly cold burger good no issues there   Our waitress informed she getting off shift new bartender would take tab when finished  then proceeded pool tables  tables clean no issues couple hours later paid bill left new bartender very polite no problems  Overall good experience good food price awesome employees!
