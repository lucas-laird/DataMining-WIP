Thats $10 per piece sushi!  Bleh no thx! <EOR> As see other reviews serious problem sushi restaurants without real Japanese roots  restaurant perfect example that  no Japanese wait staff when looking menu options cannot believe any self respecting Japanese restaurant would serve fake sushi items  understand clientele going mostly hard core sushi experts but when pay $150 sushi dinner expect much more rolls sticky sashimi  nigiri poorly made couldn't see sushi chefs cannot speak authenticity but rice hard fish tasted sticky  sign bad fish  Yes middle desert what's big deal? restaurant should know factors working against them  Opening sushi restaurant middle desert not good idea provide fresh fish even worse idea   other hand visited other Japanese restaurants outside strip which amazingly good know good fresh sushi doable even Vegas  busy evening but waited over 40 minutes meal arrive doing? Catching fish sand something? Yes did pay $150 dinner even brought menu home just share ridiculous prices family friends   I probably frame put wall shame most ridiculous Japanese restaurants to  <EOR> Ok you're Mandalay Bay trying figure eat tonight   Plenty choices but j pop few didn't looked packed reason why!  While sushi good but service slow seating limited prices well pricey!    Let's face you're going shell some dough Las Vegas but pretty sure better sushi options area   maybe if you're staying Mandalay Bay but can't really recommend if need trip! <EOR> After going Shark Reef Aquarium mood some sushi  Saw J pop walking back tried satisfy craving raw fishies  Nice open feel center hotel    You mark your order menu  Kinda cool wrote some order custom rolls  Such Unagi hand roll add some topiko avocado  California roll some spicy sauce mayonnaise actually hit    I recommend try Cucumber salad  some type vinegar which made taste sour but yet tart  Also try Screaming Orgasm seared tuna miso dressing  Sauce made scream orgasm each bite took   Sushi pretty good nice fresh  Salmon Yellow tail melts your mouth  Kinda disappointed when didnt Toro    bit pricey but your Vegas  Everything always more expensive inside Vegas hotels  <EOR> For uninitiated bar patterned off Japanese 'cosplay' subculture where ordinary folk dress Japanese anime oriented costumes cocktails dining traditional socializing even cuddle parties   Except J Pop lacks any actual CosPlay costumes authenticity any real Japanese food any actual enjoyable socializing anything resembling cuddle party  much less anyone I'd actually interested cuddling matter IT'S RAININ' MEN! Because ultimately place SAUSAGEFEST 2009  Yep  Kielbasa City   basically nothing more drive pitstop guys leaving conferences being held Mandalay Bay convention center   Christ seen more guys holding deal negotiations over cocktail tables damned Rhino   surprising being J Pop all allure excitement United Airlines Red Carpet Club   OKAY  SCENE BLOWS   SUSHI? I'd hack Mandalay's web site rename J Pop California Rock  Roll Mayo Avocado Spicy Tuna Philidelphia Crème Cheese Roll Bar because far being authentic doesn't even deserve right use letter 'J' its name   kept finding myself looking all you can eat deal suspected advertised during 'happy hour' along 2 for 1 sake bombs   Looking chef's technique clearly Junior Varsity team   wouldn't surprised if served better Kim Chee Bulgogi sushi     WHAT SERVICE? I tipped waitress $10 saying hurry because I'd once before knew past experience J Pop slower banana slug service thought I'd accelerate things   Wellllll sure showed me   turns $10 doesn't jacksh t service speed J Pop leading believe slow service aspect having inexperienced sushi chefs less wait staff   AND COMES  But all aside blows away prices relative quality   Highway robbery doesn't even begin describe must assume think Mandalay Bay patrons all effing idiots  well meanwhile all 4 Star reviews sort prove most jackasses visiting J Pop willing consume sub par sushi still willing bend over take butt when check arrives     I mean only joint Las Vegas  failed EVERY BASIC SUSHI TASTE TEST threw them Toro Bricks   Each piece = SOLID   Yet $25   FAIL  Uni Bitter barely solid   Usually sign old   FAIL  Mirugai Tough   Nearly shoe leather   FAIL  Yellowtail Fishy need serious chewing   Astounding considering much Yellowtail most restaurants serve   FAIL  Tamago Didn't any day   Big surprise   FAIL   For record twice try different days during week event fish deliveries made only once week   didn't even remotely matter  even going over utterly pathetic selection sake   Anyone buys rotgut deserves whatever bill get   WERE PRICES REALLY BAD? How $4 $7 1 piece?  Look really don't give damn if meal $800 2 people   signed credit slips more times remember Vegas LA NY Seattle   No principle If someone served Holy Grail of Lobster pay them Jeezus Christ Mother of God prices   But when some tool serves McDonalds hamburger Bradley Ogden's gotdamned Folgers Crystals coffee taste test switch just see if notice then audacity ask turn over 401k pay meal y'damn right gonna speak up   CONCLUSION I really want know where all other reviewers ate allowed them liberally give place 4 Stars   isn't even 3 Star sushi   Pile horrifically slow service you've yourself weakest sushi restaurants Las Vegas   1 Star                WHY?  WHY 4 STARS? Is anyone else getting puzzled am reviews stamp place J Pop inflated celebratory OMGTHISPLACEISAWESOMEWEGOTSODRUNK! reviews only because obviously better neighborhood Spicy Sushi Sake Bombs Sapporos R' old standby thus inflating J Pop's summary rating?  almost think people ought list where believe best sushi just establish baseline reviewer's experience tastes     Otherwise there's some folks apparently eat whatever food fills stomach long serve booze meal doesn't give them food poisoning hey 5 STARS ALL NIGHT LONG BABY! They remind those guys eBay reply thoughtless feedback reads Great Communication A++++!!! <EOR> I drinks couple long long hours   Each drink set back $15   total douche factory   End story  <EOR> Say what? $14 99 bento box lunch special? Ok   give try   Was worth it? Meh much    It took 5 days food waitress just seemed own world  WTF?  My friend ordered $5 cucumber salad smallest salad ever seen  size half rice bowl both looked WTF   My bento box came 4 pieces california roll 4 pieces spicy tuna roll 1 piece tuna sushi 1 piece salmon sushi 1 pice shrimp sushi seaweed salad edamame    It alright  stuffed  But really wait made just ridiculous    And $5 small ass cucumber salad also insane  Blah  <EOR> This place some great live entertainment   girls singing guys rapping pole dancers background  Awesome !
