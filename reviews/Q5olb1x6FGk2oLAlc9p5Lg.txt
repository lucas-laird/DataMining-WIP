Great job  wife Love bonefish again  <EOR> Bonefish Grill usually consistent favorite ours consistent food quality service no matter which Bonefish Grill although dinner tonight would think again    First off server Rachel awesome even hands full training new person  She did everything within capabilities remedy dinner experience  If rate barely 1 star   Main issues 1  Bang Bang Shrimp flavor still but   bed lettuce seemed slightly brown edges but brushed off because it may sauce batter shrimp slipping off  Definitely good start   2  Fish n Chips portion sized SIGNIFICANTLY smaller batter fish! inquired told could result inconsistent cuts  2 additional peices then brought issue   3  Shrimp Pad Thai dish before good now no longer  tasted over sweet drenched sweet chili sauce noodles stuck together clumps shrimp added afterthought instead part dish ZERO taste rubbery  Now don't expect same real Thai restaurant but dish menu awhile    4  Ice tea refill watered down being attention real stuff  5  Overheard tables around also having issues i e  sides listed menu available because given old menu food cooked expected etc     We hope just off night Bonefish Grill but safe wait bit before next visit if dare return  <EOR> My Rip Eye wood grilled Steak okay  ordered Steak Potatoes Au Gratin Béarnaise  <EOR> Well unfortunately wasn't impressed  friend suggested place took look @ menu line already knew wanted before even there  friend already seated  waters table start  young waitress cane over introduced herself forgot name asked drinks apps  tell couldn't hear her  She very soft voice place busy nosey   Our cocktails took some time but really pretty tasted yes yummy! see pictures   pineapple martini    made rum vodka  asked if bread came meal since saw some table next told yes  bread delicious tasted homemade but oil herb dip wasn't good  odd taste it  hungry ate anyways though would better if some butter!

Right middle dinner rush hour   whatever   So order Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer fish tacos Salmon Caesar salad   appetizer shows very quickly   and pretty good   breaded deep fried shrimp some type good sauce   ten minutes pass and   the main courses arrive   casually mention salad never came please sure charged it   Still improving   The tacos good served hot   Salmon okay served hot   Frankly fresh fish house really expecting salmon better than   say   any random cafe   not   lower side average   kind small dry   The saving grace place expensive   complimentary card appetizer bill tip exactly $50   think literally dozen other places $50 gets two people better experience food   Considering eat every dinner around lot   assure Bonefish off list   Maybe forget all year three try again then  <EOR> When left restaurant eating husband asked I'd rate YELP said GOIR STARS because delicious    Chicken moist salmon seared cooked perfection paired wonderfully extra avocado    But reason why review missing star because wish Salmon portion bigger service pretty slow    initially supposed quick bite turned into least 45 minutes hour  Despite though glad ate Bonefish Grill because always curious! <EOR> I thought place good money very affordable compared rest vegas!

Why earth call Asian sauce? know any Asian cuisine cook delicate fish sweet sour sauce carrots   The second problem outer surface fish steak burnt  understand fish probably seared pan first then baked grilled  But apparently temperature pan high  fish surface slightly crispy golden brown but bitter burnt  think executed well    Thirdly menu says dish comes side seasonal vegetable turns Garbanzo beans  would consider them seasonal when think vegetables generally think Garbanzo beans either  tastes ok  But if would fresh vegetables i e  broccoli zucchini asparagus etc  please ask waiter seasonal vegetable actually is  no assumptions    Lastly bathroom towel paper no hand drying equipment either  think negligence management    With all above being said waitress attentive friendly  ambience comfortable trendy  If very concerned food taste would rather choose familiarity chains i e  food ambiance think may still good place  <EOR> Went first time   Everything good  Now alternative place eat fish during Lenten season other sushi  <EOR> What great experience Bonefish today  came Mother's Day brunch  Even though reservations 2 15pm sat early even honored brunch menu which ended 2pm  waiter great  She accommodating attentive friendly  food delicious  surf turf egg benedict which highly recommended  bottomless brunch cocktails also point  Looking forward eating again    To staff Bonefish thank making Mother's Day dinning experience awesome! guys rock  <EOR> This 6th visit Bonefish Grill   5 previous visits 5 star rating us   sure happened time but very disappointed many things time    1 showed Saturday without reservation expecting wait some cocktails bar first   told 20 25 mins  bad all  reality 55 minutes later finally seated   UGH!!!

Overall back  paid $40 nonbottomless brunch brunch burger mediocre best  <EOR> More great food beyond Strip   I came few friends visiting Vegas  service divine as always anywhere remotely near Strip starting bread pesto refilled frequently enough effort save room main course   I seared tuna paired pinot noir  Definitely good if better thought was  friends similar success daily specials ahiahi dishes   My only complaint as lot restaurants really dim inside  Ah well save little electric bill guess  <EOR> The variety wonderful fish dishes drinks outstanding  found hard believe chain incredibly fresh! <EOR> Located Town Plaza  Place looks classy upscale    Food Fresh fish day forgot name fish but delicious  only part missing lemon  mango salsa but lacks citrus flavor  particularly want fish some lime lemon  Overall flaky soft good   Service Service okay  wasn't blown away   I'll again if to  Town Plaza many restaurants choose from  <EOR> I haven't any Bonefish Grill location excited try new eatery Town Square  visit last August pleasant just minor hiccups  spoke well them planned returning  Six months later dining experience just okay  bad but nothing spectacular   By no surprise really taken Bang Bang Shrimp $10 90  fried shrimp tossed deliciously creamy spicy sauce  signature dish complete trademarked name there's reason build all marketing around it  appetizer however wasn't good second time around  sure if just preparation evening if  just served now  also offer prized shrimp tacos $5 Bang Wednesdays 4pm closing    Other appetizers Twisted Edamame Hummus $5 50  topped roasted tomatoes pepitas served crispy flatbread chips Wagyu Beef Ginger Dumplings $9 30  pan seared crispy onions Thai peppers soy sauce  hummus all right but dumplings pretty good   During first visit opted Chilean Sea Bass $29 90 Chimichurri sauce no longer offered two sides Chorizo Edamame Corn Slaw Red Quinoa Salad  entrees come seasonal vegetable additional choice side however requested another side lieu vegetables paid extra dollar  fish exquisite  All fish grilled over wood delicious  really nice size price well  Chimichurri wasn't very good though  really liked slaw topping but quinoa salad flavorless    Ruben shared Baja Fish Tacos $14 10 during most recent visit  made grilled Tilapia flour tortillas mango salsa lime crema shredded lettuce served housemade chips  fish good but didn't enjoy anything else  fan use flour tortillas tacos didn't care mango salsa lime crema didn't add enough pizzazz  housemade chips okay but no flavor   For beverages friend shared bottle Sauvignon Blanc Attitude Pascal Jolivet France $36 also tried Signature Pomegranate Mango Red Sangria $5 50   Both really great selections  also white sparkling sangria but server suggested red   Desserts recommendation server tried Jamaican Coconut Pie Rum Sauce no longer available   warm coconut pie well ours improperly reheated very strong rum sauce  very good  also tried Crème Brûlée featuring Madagascan vanilla custard served fresh seasonal berries whipped cream $7 30 Chocolate Crème Brûlée decadent creamy chocolate custard made hint Grand Marnier housemade whipped cream $7 30   Crème Brûlées definitely good  really used Madagascan Vanilla since more robust flavor Chocolate version delicious! splash Grand Marnier really made it   Service odd  Both times servers really nice but there's disconnect between servers kitchen something  servers would disappear long periods time but otherwise would very attentive  friends didn't receive pre dinner course prior entrees but server nice enough remove bill  still difficult enjoy though  Also absolutely no timing between appetizers entrees  complimentary bread delicious but wasn't offered first time   I ambiance decor but seems identity issues  decor menu prices portray nice date night dining establishment whereas butcher paper vinyl tablecloths heavily fried menu feel your typical casual dine in restaurant without benefit cheap prices   most part food quality seems slightly better but sure if worth it  <EOR> I took group Bonefish lunch  called reservation 2 days before arrived  When arrived did reservation gave private room which nice without charge might add   food delicious service little slow but really considering probably prepared since did write down reservation wait staff did well  also want thank manager did take care mistake treated well  Many lunch group members before said would again   A very pleasant experience  would also again  only other complaint clam chowder  am always surprised when Bonefish tell that  only corn chowder  only restaurant serves fish does any clam chowder Las Vegas  Oh well  <EOR> Holy fried seafood Batman   Between Singapore Calamari Bang Bang Shrimp Fish Chips think fill fried food while     We started Singapore Calamari Bang Bang Shrimp appetizers   calamari generic much breading tastes   does come some fried peppers which nice treat   Bang Bang Shrimp most popular appetizer consisted crunchy breaded shrimp very mild sauce   Both calamari shrimp supposed spicy sauce but scale 1 10 both probably 0 5   positive portion sizes very generous if you're sharing could entree one   I opted Sir Will's Fish Chips because description said tempura style because fish tilapia instead usual cod   fish itself really good nice juicy again generous portions   Sadly batter less tempura style more Long John Silver's style giant block fried batter encased filet fish   Crunchy thick didn't anything fish   I don't think Bonefish Grill would ever first choice if Town Square but also wouldn't dismiss if someone else wanted try it   Based tilapia fish chips I'd want try grilled fish entrees  <EOR> I dinner tonight some friends place never disappoints  all ate until stuffed drinks tasty average all two cocktails each    I highly recommend place anyone loves great atmosphere good food cocktails  <EOR> The food very fresh flavorful  crab shrimp stuffed tilapia entrée bang bang shrimp cup chowder  only thing wish could change amount spicy sauce shrimp  way much smothered them  Next time we'll sauce side because shrimp fried w seasoning already  server very knowledgeable menu offered great suggestions  husband major garlic lovers chef willing accommodate request adding garlic fish  Magnificent!
