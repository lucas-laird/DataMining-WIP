Outside seating  truly different!  As only Vegas few nights wanted sure experience much possible including dining  doing usual hunt Yelp decided try Spago great suggestion   When arrived waiter asked if wanted sit inside opted outside best choice! honest thought blue ceiling tacky first but while really started trick outside!  The food awesome as expected but service waiters top notch well  Highly recommend  <EOR> Dinner outstanding service top quality food 4 stars great place meal <EOR> 5 stars yumminess but minus 1 star snootiness!  I've twice both times seated patio area  Why seated crowded patio area when empty seats inside main area?     why did greeting fool look bf down gestured patio? Why Spago why snooty?!    The food really yummy but don't understand why waitors waitresses greeters act if better paying customers? Why? Tell why??? <EOR> They started off wrong foot when return glass 2 knives because  dirty  couldn't even wipe crud thumbprint off napkin  acted normal however  If eating roadside diner maybe but  acceptable when dress prices they're charging  If dishwasher doesn't catch then waiter should when he sets table  gf tasting menu $100 but when indicated wanted peruse menu waiter really pushed tasting menu  don't sashimi lamb wasn't going taste them but sense he wanted same menu 1 made life easier bring same dishes same time isn't waiter's job bring food order? 2 more expensive anything else menu  ended ordering crab cakes appetizer duck breast  ok but ok's you're supposed posh restaurant  Even though ate half gf's dishes other sashimi lamb ended going Johnny Rockets later evening  enjoyed meal much more 1 6 price  <EOR> *AMAZING*  For 30th birthday ventured into Spago fantastic night amazing experience   Finding great restaurant Vegas hand's down pretty easy   fantastic gourmet different   face easy task   Our food fresh wine poured all night service welcoming engaging   salmon others table sea bass tuna filet special   Everyone clean plate   also seafood platter full fresh oysters shrimp crab lobster   If special don't pass up!  Of course treated special Happy Birthday platter sparkling candle which way doesn't blow out   fine classy way end dinner  <EOR> Fantastic!  portions small but flavors perfect   coworkers while working Las Vegas   happened Ceasars Forum Shops stopped dinner   place near empty Wednesday night treated impeccable service   chef even came say hello few times   honestly dont' remember all ordered but EVERYTHING better good   Trust your server's recommedations never steered wrong   Even drinks nailed it   seasonal pumpkin martini good all asked recipe   chef hand wrote delivered table!  Even though Spago no longer trendy spot still it  <EOR> I chopped veggie salad   veggies fresh peas frozen   you could tell freshly plucked pod   bread pita cracker basket excellent   chocolate souffle dessert    order twenty minutes ahead especially you   Tried ginger lime spritzer drink no alcohol perfect   husband turkey avocado sandwich he ate every bite good sandwich gets <EOR> We very solid experience Spago   Business dinner staff very professional good selection wine   Everyone enjoyed meals   started seafood appetizer tray party 6   wife said oysters excellent no dirt sweet   Short Rib very good  <EOR> Food 3 5 Service 3 5 5 Cleanliness 4 5 Price $$$  You find restaurant within minutes entering Forum Shops Caesars Palace casino entrance  restaurant relatively easy spot because bright neon sign says Wolfgang Puck's Spago  arrived restaurant no reservation around 3pm late lunch    We seated casual cafe dining area because lunch time  dining room only open dinner starting 5 30pm  also nice bar available casual drinks throughout entire day starting 11 30am   All dining tables very clean comfortable seats crisp linen table cloths napkins  seated immediately upon arriving because restaurant wasn't busy time hour  When seated waiters welcomed menus served water choice   We ordered three things ourselves 1 Truffled potato chips maytag blue cheese fondue 2 Garlic Herb marinated roasted free range chicken hubby 3 Housemade bucatini carbonara parmesan crispy prosciutto    Our appetizer arrived sometime later ordered first weren't excited potato chips tasted  didn't WOW but both agreed getting addicting ate through plate chips  blue cheese fondue delicious but couldn't really taste truffle chips  Topped some fresh parsley top appetizer worth trying but something we'd order again  try something else next time!  Hubby's roasted chicken delicious  no extra side served chicken which hubby actually appreciated because he wanted eat little more healthy ie  no carbs? lunch day  chicken full flavour well marinated marinade itself quite tasty! sweet tangy savoury all same time making reach seconds thirds  Hubby loved dish enjoyed well when tried it dish well balanced terms flavour! I'd order side though along chicken   It first time trying bucatini thick pasta noodle hole running through its centre  portion carbonara smaller expected but together potato chips actually made full wasn't able order any dessert  D Overall carbonara good but great  prosciutto its own salty taste but balanced when eaten together bucatini  pasta some bland without prosciutto well  Maybe because lot blue cheese fondue appetizer but ended really feeling carbonara  When ordered excited but few bites carbonara wasn't content dish hubby chicken  finished pasta because don't leaving food behind but carbonara wasn't anything memorable opinion   All all lunch Spago café great but nothing incredible  Then again Spago more well known its dining room dinner service anything else may give restaurant another try day its dinner  Another reason visit Las Vegas west coast again! D  The restaurant casually recommended but must go opinion far  may change point when grab dinner dining room day  If you're looking casual place eat lunch though Spago would great fit overall  provide good food great service enough energy going shopping spree! <EOR> Liked Caesar salad fresh anchovy thin crust pizzas OK but considering such well known spot expected much better food  Several things lacked salt just overall flavor such fettuccini shortrib w gnocci  <EOR> I would come back just bread!  Came large group girls the bread man quickly became new best friend!  favorites parmesan lavosh bacon cheddar buns     The butternut squash soup extra creamy salmon tender inside crisp skin   friends also raving short ribs!

Complementary Bread Spago serves variety breads playing different textures flavors 3 different items dip bread sea salt butter olive oil   olive oil possibly favorite 3 dips because infused few herb leaves I know rosemary thyme but can't remember   liked none breads overpowering flavor filling point where couldn't enjoy appetizers entrees  never restaurant serve style before loved having selection variety textures dips mix taste together!  Parsley Cauliflower Soup This twist typical cream broccoli soup left boyfriend wanting more  wasn't hot couldn't eat immediately but stayed warm throughout meal until could devour all  consistency soup just perfect thick but thick point clumpiness  enough vegetables filling but overwhelm your appetite  might only seasonal soup but if still around when visit must try!  Crab Cakes This only dish where I'd say closer standard crab cakes find other upscale restaurants but would nevertheless recommend trying if crave it  truly crab cakes done right thin crunchy crust fresh crab inside bed bright tasty greens drizzled light vinaigrette  lovely classic  perfect starter your meal   Turkey French Dip I've only roast beef french dips past being big beef eater ecstatic see meat love dish  already getting somewhat full eating bread soup crab cakes but minute took bite sandwich couldn't stop eating it! amazing dish made hungry eat more just bite! turkey meat cooked perfectly wasn't dry cut very thin little no fat  couldn't believe incredibly tender juicy was only more amazing conjunction french dip  can't emphasize enough dish must try!  Mushroom Pizza This pizza no tomato sauce which appreciated because wish pizzas would always come way  very thin only cheese 1 mushroom each slice but wow mushroom cooked perfection  tender juicy harmonized beautifully rest cheese pizza  wasn't entree only 1 slice but wish enough stomach space eaten more! <EOR> I am fan all Wolfgang's restaurants Vegas  found quality preparation ingredients consistent across board  whether Postrio MGM Bar Grill Spago its never going disappoint    When talking Spago itself several things enjoy decoration music suit tastes very well nice si down dinner  bar solid love being able walk without reservation sit down order great pizza dish mussels very fair price   Great people watching Vegas brings every type person every type country  good show anything paid see!

Rigatoni served hot licked bowl   liked pepperiness olive oil served bread   Service excellent  <EOR> Let's honest  The name restaurant  = expectations  Wolfgang Puck    did disappoint   I without much expectation  actually expected little overrated  Boy wrong   I start service  As soon walked manager greeted made small talk  At such big name restaurant unexpected   Then led table smack middle restaurant the manager said best seat house   maybe he exaggerating but made feel loved!!! lol wine selection choices entree appreciated variety    Here list foods tried ratings  Blue crab salad fresh refreshing hongkong style salmon little salty but fish dry at all  ahi tuna cooked perfection! short ribs tender gnocchi comes it mmmnomnom! filet mignon melts your mouth  <EOR> The customer service supreme  food      much   ordered shrimp scampi lunch   shrimp over cooked pasta under cooked   pasta aldente but still crunchy  flavor great but food hard eat   Thick crunchy pasta rubbery prawns expected well established resturant  ate shrimp left pasta   did remove meal bill again good customer service  <EOR> My friends all six course tasting menu $100 which included following courses Appetizer pasta dish sashimi dish pasta dish fish seafood dish beef dish dessert   Mind within most dishes finish within 2 4 bites but since rich full really fast   food incredibly tasty unique portions tasting size    friends struggling finish   Also menu changes everyday every time tasting menu should always different some way    I honestly say think overall value six course meal should really neighborhood $60 $75 $100 expecting better    fish beef courses wasn't anything sing home thought both overcooked both instances   beef wasn't even if high grade shoulder round      However service incredible   People friendly polite    would try place again but tasting menu  <EOR> Wow!

Thanks yelpers <EOR> We walking around found place eat not really planned    bread really delicious!!  Thank underestimating importance bread plays meal   YUM   made note myself bread   read butter salt pepper oil   four choices   no idea meant but figured I'd pass    Try cheesy Margarita flat bread if hungry don't think fill before dinner   Boy love bread   I tuna main entree cooked perfectly   Nothing world but fantastic meal     The wine list really pricey but guess should expect Vegas   found Italian wine list $70 which rare most way more expensive   good though! <EOR> Lunch cafe menu MEH  Good bread basket but Kobe Burger fries  average cooked specification salad salty fresh caprese sandwich special just OK  Service polite but slightly lackadaisical place looks quite dated  saving grace Vegas very reasonable wallet  <EOR> Food yummy  Service good  Atmosphere nice  Overall good time! <EOR> I've walked place many times over past 5 years lived Las Vegas last night first time actually chance dine there  say DELICIOUS!!! menu site very different then presented table I'm thinking maybe because summer time menu selections change depending season chef?   Speaking Chefs Erik the chef evening came offered special dish few people table  ordered fabulous medium rare meat dish prepared brick oven  looked almost prime rib without bone   ordered flank steak wonderful butter garlic sauce over it  Everything grilled fish pasta dish looked very appetizing! started calamari appetizer sashimi other prosciutto dish creamy white cheese spread very similar melted mozzarella  great dining experience very pleasantly surprised food service  definitely returning recommending place friends family come visit! <EOR> I love place  really service ambiance almost always visited when town   Valet your car mall take elevator front entrance   Convenience small plus compared always delightful menu selections   We loaded some appetizers all sounded good   Soup day delicious perhaps because loaded cream   wifes salad great too   crabcakes well prepared loaded tasty crab     I kobe beef sliders kids more well done would done quality beef   Pretty good none less based tiny bite able trade them for   This trip pizza   Spago's style pizza enjoy   woodfired pizza fresh tasty ingredients great mix flavors   Perhaps over ordered because boxed some pizza wifes entree being full enjoy more  <EOR> I must say pleasantly surprised great everything was service portions price made sense taste   We ordered Asian Chicken Salad has dif name but cant think moment meatloaf 2 desserts   All portions big enough split among 2 maybe even 3 depending your appetite   The salad didn't much dressing crunch always enjoy salad great start   As meatloaf normally don't even consider eating meatloaf for personal reasons but aunt recommended see why  Very well balanced probably best but then again haven't much so    As dessert ordered Key Lime light yet satisfying    Definitely recommend!  PS  review extremely late just noticed never clicked submit <EOR> What say reason why Wolfgang reputation  expected crew both front back house point extremely helpful  complimentary corn soup delicious  also octopus salad tartare which barely taste  buddies devoured it  Guess lol arugula salad  Everything very tasty  Then main course beautifully  cooked rare lamb chops  Accompanied amazing Pino Burgundy  All all awesome experience  even back see kitchen shake Chef Eric Kleins hand take pic  Next time return sure going tasting menu  Unfortunately everyone party wanted o well next time <EOR> I though peach drink excellent if bit small   The pasta option ordered dinner well done damn tasty   I don't think give five stars without tasting few more dishes but price reasonable Vegas felt service very good   Worth second run  <EOR> Don't know if crazy 5 star review which see lot but Spago fine  definitely ate more casual less expensive cafe menu perhaps experience would different if selected other menu  say items featured looked really good maybe should come back days try eat full dinner  But just pizza fuel while trying find birthday gift mom   The pizza good mild sliced Italian sausage good cheese nice crisp crust etc  But wasn't truly remarkable  Would eat again? Oh yeah absolutely  Would place above all other thing crust wood coal oven pizzas elsewhere   no  fact see review Grimaldi's even best wood coal over pizza given Vegas weekend  But  insult it  Just say EPIC  <EOR> Dunno why never reviewed Mr  Puck's lovely oasis desert before    but goes  solid place nicely prepared food middle tacky but fun Caesars Palace Forum   always opt patio inside under fake blue sky   only vegas cuz  love watch wandering herds tourists when might pause food service  Love peeping tom perch diversion  digress  Service pretty consistant just right amount attentiveness  Food VERY consistant  last visit spousal unit schnitzel fabulous  Truly feast eyes tummy  All other entrees table enjoyed bread basket huge hit  Dunno    just consistency nicely prepared predictable Puck fare  Nothing flashy cutting edge  Just nice tasty decent price great location people watch  hope never changes               <EOR> I heard place really good excited try it  seated promptly but took them 20 minutes bring menu asked if any time constraints which did  food itself tasted good but lacked innovation overpriced  guess should've looked more carefully menu  Service left lot desired  waiter took away party's when he stood use restroom never gave another one  still don't understand why he took it    Another waiter said dishes came potatoes he would bring promptly  guess promptly means never them never them  sad part weren't even busy knows what's happening there   They did bring dessert mistakes plus one  similar price points much better restaurants Vegas  <EOR> High points Good starters cauliflower soup A+  Tuna symphony great  Great salad  Great pizza  I kosher person way help accommodate     Low points Wine selection overall very good but glass skimpy   don't why can't open those fancy ass bottles gauge per glass   I'd it  Main courses ok   example lamb chops crusted pistachios under seasoned though lamb quality high   Details details   Overall I'd back but would probably panoply appetizers  <EOR> Walking around Caesars Palace really having any idea where eat also few free drinks already hand decided Spago looked pretty good outside prices reasonable enough considering much everything costs Vegas   I don't think I'd ever Wolfgang Puck restaurant before generally pretty cynical anyone putting name multiple places big tourist stops but stuff good   ordered calamari appetizer margherita pizza share  Both wonderful calamari coming delicious sweet spicy sauce    Also give assortment bread before your meal comes just wimpy little bread butter crap  some fancy shiz  three different types own sauces including sweet bread raisins cranberry baked into topped butter  Also different type topped olive oil etc  Good stuff   The pizza delicious well nice sharp cheeses plenty around  crust wasn't amazing but far complaining   Somehow managed $35 bucks    I would give 5 stars but didnt' try enough dishes said pizza wasn't exactly perfect but seriously doubt could much better Caesars price   giftcard another Wolfgang Puck restaurant following day we didn't mean two places but  worked out wasn't nearly good cost twice much  <EOR> I've never Spago before only heard legendary Spago LA started gourmet pizza revolution  few Wolfgang Puck Express locations never remembered bad experience  say first fine dining excursion celebrity chef   I'll skip right food  complimentary amuse bouche potato cauliflower soup in teeny cup nice touch start things off  selection complimentary bread great  provided some olive oil salt pepper dipping too   Grilled octopus salad 4 stars chunks octopus incredibly tender  little bit citrus preserved lemon really brought flavors  white bean ragout provided nice starchy contrast protein octopus   New England diver sea scallops 3 stars three big sized scallops all nicely cooked  topped foam barely any flavor  menu said white corn mascarpone emulsion basil oil  downer dish  wife ate last scallop really awful tasting charred aftertaste  probably burnt part pan reusing dirty pan instead clean one  palette destroyed one   Red wine braised short ribs 3 stars nice presentation all ingredients put together  short ribs tender melt in your mouth full flavor  Overall thought flavors bit monotone  Plus desperately needed some crunchy texture dish  Between ricotta gnocchi meat sort eating baby food  just really expensive baby food   Service slow indifferent throughout night  apparent didn't place high priority service  amount money charge  unacceptable  told them bad scallop manager nice enough take entire scallop entree off bill  almost $40  did earn brownie points but overall don't see returning many other Vegas restaurants bookmark list  <EOR> Great spot grab brunch long night Vegas ing   Oddly enough couldn't find brunch menu online but remember getting frittata  good but liked crab cakes benedict better    The prices reasonable portion sizes manageable  left full but stuffed which always appreciated   Would back try dinner  <EOR> These type reviews hate write  Striking balance between food service often challenge  When fine restaurant however certain basic expectations   Tonight group seven dined here  duck salads pastas soups pizzas  commend kitchen staff very good quality food  Everything tasted wonderful     The service however absolutely ruined meal us  server all attentive   Drinks unrefreshed dessert never offered waited 20 minutes check even then took complaining manager it  When manager brought check rather simply say he sorry poor service he said if don't service don't tip   No kidding genius!!!  Check reviews people  am very reasonable generous stars  place requires leadership change if attitude deliver  <EOR> Hey Spago remember me?

Keep mind generally don't write reviews unless am really compelled hence only second review here   Before drive Vegas 15 friends contemplated where should eat  know strip no shortage restaurants honest always food hunting Vegas two notions mind any decent restaurant pricey food greatest  all middle desert right?  A friend highly recommended Spago decided give them call reservation  Upon arrival literally stepped foot into restaurant headed straight seats  wouldn't big deal normally but restaurant packed normally wait forever Vegas  table immaculate servers very quick ask beverages would like  Alcohol course easy rocks   They bring around bread tray select four different types breads all very soft flavorful along plate four spread dipping options  Very nice attention detail  ordered some appetizers begin oysters fabulous sweet fig flat bread wow!  Now main courses  entree menu every palette  If slow cooked beef melts your mouth Red Wine Braised Boneless Short Rib Beef  Filet Mignon also looked hearty tasty  Being Wolfgang restaurant buddy mine couldn't help but order sausage plate which he killed cleared plate  also offer spaghetti some asian fusion dishes which tried bean curd noodles money!   The servers very attentive food came nice hot time  General Manager Michael Schwarz came made sure needs all met which case did hesitate thank such great time  He really place running smooth won't hesitate back recommend place all friends    Thank Michael crew! <EOR> I think 4 star average restaurant gets well founded  food really good but no WOW factor   provide great casual meal decent price  specials work every now then service always very good  Recommend place everyone!

I always start fried calamari  love it!! delicious  sweet chili sauce comes delicious cucumber salad comes delicious!! Though every time thing would change it  would use seasoned breadcrumbs!! If breadcrumbs use seasoned really cannot tell all  know sauce supposed provide flavor but calamari just needs little kick    Other items tried very good black truffle fettucine roasted organic chicken spaghetti chicken parm sandwich asian chicken salad all good would recommend any those items!!  And favorite thing olive oil give addition sea salt butter bread bowl  olive oil amazing!! very potent intense flavor can't really describe but end dipping chicken french fries calamari potatoes put olive oil anything!!!  The ambiance place average  considered high end dining but find extremely casual  boyfriend hat sneakers don't mind  though great food stuffy place all  servers always really cool too!! <EOR> This place sucks!  might want eat before go    nothing more huge tourist trap!  portions very small price very high!  would suggest trying Carmine's instead   tourist trap but leave full save lot money    Spago total ripoff! <EOR> Pricyyyyyyyy But service excellent waiters around constantly making sure all right cups filled! only ever gone lunch which pretty good decent prices but dinner Seafood appetizer special Very pricy   there four everything oysters jumbo shrimp cocktail spoonful crab salad   worth $ opinion but food indeed fresh quite delish   Hong Kong style salmon Being hong kong descent didn't really taste Hong Kong me   had weird twang soy sauce  Salmon very soft cooked just right though  Vegetables same weird twang but still edible   Sea bass Yum! mine gluten free yes gluten allergy sucks! waiter reassured terrified little brain dealt allergies all kinds all time would sure keep gluten allergy mind  meal bit different usual   it really consisted excellently cooked sea bass bunch buttery chopped greens bottom  Pretty good   Diver scallops Came cool foam top  Scallops felt could cooked more golden tone but still good  kept biting some sand something though   The meals way pricey amount but guess classier restaurants  just way is! Presentation amazing everything cooked perfection  Employees very professional friendly   I'd come again but maybe lunch wallet won't implode  <EOR> Let just say Spago experience LA Vegas before   pleased   when Absinthe ended past Sunday night hungry pizza and knowing Trump shuttle where staying shows right below Spago stopped pizza   very clear Hostess all wanted admirably didn't feel discriminated upon only wanting such small Spago experience   led table two back   ordered $9 Cabernet husband ordered tea   agreed pizza which described such ITALIAN SAUSAGE Roasted Fennel Tuscan Black Olives Reggiano Cheese Thyme     brought divided dish olive oil butter salt pepper   baskets brought around foccacia sourdough flatbread   Nice but only much bread ya know?  Then came pizza sadly disappointing!  Honestly both agreed tasted crust pre frozen    better pizza Wicked Spoon buffet next day   Toppings nice but crust very disappointing       bad   But wasn't imho experienced via Wolfgang past  nobody planet could bigger fan butternut squash soup would and have killed for time only say  better   But appreciative experience  <EOR> Pizza's great love shisito peppers app  favorite homemade spaghetti bolegnase ?? Roma tomatoes etc    Always great food year year   <EOR> Wow  Flank steak  Hubby sea bass  split mushroom fettuccine  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

Loved beef tar tar appetizer  Then home made spaghettini w truffles raviolo both 5 stars  short ribs perfectly tender rack lamb beautiful presentation equally appetizing med rare  only disappointment restraint seemed very empty 7 30pm Saturday night but entire meal service spot on!! <EOR> We dinner tonight  party three reservations 730p booth  seated right away server Alex attendant Reggie  Both wonderful   started beef tartare risotto black truffle  both very good  dinner prime ny steak served rare finger ing potatoes  Spinach w bacon   friend filet other salmon  All three very good  dessert asked buckwheat but didn't it  exchanged chocolate bar dessert  delicious  chef Eric Klein came say hello asked enjoyed meal  advised terrific  He France speaks German well delightful exchange German  cool   would eat again would try tasting menu would nice  Price point high but quality <EOR> Really regret coming dinner last night  made reservation 10 15pm calling in  ONCE did woman phone mention would ordering off standard menu main kitchen closed already ONCE!    when looking forward Spago experience but only then told ordering off regular menu possible  Thanks letting know then    time late elsewhere believe checked hungry    Our waiter very nice informed main kitchen still turning dishes he asked manager if could order off menus  answer no!
