Almost every table filled only two people taking orders bus person  All three just kept promising bring asked but never apologized  think would really help place couple extra servers weekend nights  Every other table around equally having flag people down walk bar just someone's attention    It's sad because place decent weeknights  other owners works he's always very nice attentive a little bit longer hair always wears button shirt jeans Nitzan?   But working Saturday night short hair usually wears t shirt rarely came table unless spent time waiting serve someone else then flagging down  Nitzan amazing server always provides best service but other guy while polite very attentive all    In end bill $90 three people  hookah wasn't bad while still coals drinks okay  service really killed evening  really couldn't even leave when frustrated service because took another 45 minutes just check them run through register    Disclaimer many times weekends usually repeat themselves  feel know differentiate between bad service busy restaurant  beyond above that  basically ignored even going finding someone 5 6 different times  usually pretty forgiving any kind server but servers owners really need just hire couple people weekends  still tipped 20%  <EOR> Hands down best hookah lounge las vegas sure very biased statement but can't wrong Laylas!

I didn't try Shakshuka when Israel lot recipes it but don't lot cooking thrilled see menu try first time  listed under Breakfast heading but didn't matter  decided share along Sabih sandwich  waiter patiently explained veggie combinations big sandwich sounded differently delicious  both items just that smoky tomato based vegetables perfect base eggs nestled top  already craving again  sandwich unusual but good way little messy but he noticed quick bring more napkins  We're vegetarians but Iuvvv vegetables both items ordered beyond excellent   Though generation started all can't say didn't inhale really wasn't familiar mechanics hookah  remedied when waiter sat down gave full lesson!
