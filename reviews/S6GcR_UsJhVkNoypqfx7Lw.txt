Ok thats good      Now bad    ordering system total joke no idea going servers serving line  give 1 card per table take line each person orders food add card then bring back table server totals brings bill  Sounds easy right? Wrong would help if anyone serving line spoke english everone confused cant seperate checks confused frustrated seems give them attitude line  management really needs grip something help rediculousness   The BBQ itsself just OK ita TX style dry rub which cool but unfortunately just didnt taste good  Oh someone needs teach guys serving line cut meat grain??c'mon  jalapeno sausage weak no jalapenos mine corn cob side dripping w butter side dry leather other    Like mentioned earlier ice cream great however bread pudding just ok  wasnt bad but wasnt great any means  then beer glass smelled bleach  <EOR> Honestly ate last weekend because staying Excalibur least busy restaurant  kind whole rocker vibe but nothing noteworthy place  novelty name band affiliation does restaurant   food typical bbq could anywhere served cafeteria style  yawn  prices give break! Even Vegas overpriced underwhelming  1 2 chicken 2 sides partner pork chop 2 sides which came over $40!! know its Strip but its fancy restaurant     As seeing any actual members band sure if actually stop but did see Vinnie Paul drummer Pantera there   rock n' roll gets  <EOR> I've going Las Vegas 20 years now L S  BBQ simply WORST MEAL ever EVER had  Avoid place TOTALLY!  Why?  1  BBQ pork sandwich pork taste pretty good but comes between two sloppy pieces white bread  dare ANYBODY able pick sandwich eat without making huge mess  joke    pulled pork bbq soaks right into bread falls apart   2  Service Simply put ISN T ANY SERVICE! sit down your own sandwich return your table eat without anybody EVER asking how's everything  anything   Everybody works 20 years old ditzy obviously never worked another restaurant life   3  receptionist Equally ditzy doesn't understand english  asked if during happy hour if side dish sandwich she answered yes course   Then seated told sandwich $5  all get   4  LS BBQ kinda expect hear LS music  NO NO NO  basketball game tube played loudly couldn't possibly carry conversation person right accross table you  Geez if wanted watch basketball I'd gone sports bar   Please yourself everybody favor avoid L S  BBQ  truly AWFUL! <EOR> yeah    I'm HUGE Skynyrd fan when saw check out  disappointment  sat table between stage main bar  15 minutes did 2 waitresses numerous times without even glancing way  Wait   is bar? peiople sitting waiting order $7 beers?
