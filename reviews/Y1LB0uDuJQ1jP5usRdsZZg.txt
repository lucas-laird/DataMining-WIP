Forget it  mention ramen noodles tad over cooked  Would recommend getting dish   The wagyu beef burger little underwhelming  First all burger medium well emphasis well which kind defeats purpose using wagyu beef  portion beef overwhelmed large bun butter lettuce  served some parmesan fries which rather pedestrian   I really wanted love place because love Japanese cuisine hope business succeeds  However given level cuisine today cannot highly recommend place lunch time   being said depending dinner menu might encouraged return  3 starred review  <EOR> One word  Incredible! Chef Omae provides wonderful dining experience   When first entering restaurant please don't judge place its decor   Unfortunately did  forget all when first course arrives   Attention turned great meal fall head over heals   $150 course brought own sake   working liquor license   brought couple different kinds sake dry lightly sweet did know expect   menu changes week week difficult plan ahead   Definitely heading back! <EOR> If guy two Michelin stars cooking then award obviously quality food  ate lunch most dissatisfying experiences ever  example guy baked half onion sprinkled some miso powder top it    WHOAH IMPRESSED! burger average fries grease city  Does chef Omae really cook here? some mediocre chef using name scam customers? Oh! if extra $30 000 your wallet buy fish place  Chef Omae proudly displays Sale signs ridiculously priced coys right next booth where eat  can't really see fish but sure see signs much money they're worth  reminded little boy showing off much money he has  done! <EOR> Reservation only  Lunch only  glad dressed because everyone else was  However friend's soda did come plastic bottle  Also seems everyone ask different menu  day had Three Layer Cold Soup Surprisingly good  waiter encouraged mix up  served cup like bowl kind soup spoon ate cereal kid  sure dig bottom layer when mix because flavor strong its own  Also circle crunchies!
