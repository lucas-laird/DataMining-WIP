Why bother filet minion then? caught off guard he came off that  head thought why does matter? He should just cooked way requested  felt he complaining because he impatient didn't wanna keep standing just cook mine  shouldn't matter likes steak   just cook it  wanted complain manager but didn't wanna big deal it    So sorry if encounter douchebag chef but most them really nice  Just hope doesn't offset ruin your night    Praying y'all decent chef next time  <EOR> The first time ate did hibachi which lot fun   especially if big group kids you   Tonight sushi really good  spider roll crab meat course paired perfectly soft shelled crab but never prepared way   The highlight sushi rolled called Captain more delightful rolls ever had  crispy fried onion rings top spicy tuna some kind garlic sauce  Serious yum kudos sushi chef came idea!
