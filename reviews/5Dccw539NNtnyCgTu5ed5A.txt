Yummy! Yummy! Over 10 years ago lived Los Angeles  Thai restaurants almost everywhere food prices very competitive! stumbled upon place closest thing Los Angeles thai restuarant    Everything ordered far amazing! yet disappointed!   The only reason why giving 5 stars because personally am fan music entertainment  bad just when you're dining friends type setting almost always feel compete musician singer    I usually pad thai ask combination   could eat whole thing myself!!! <EOR> A couple years back Vegas cousin partied butts off 3days  when time back home headed off main strip aka strip here  Goodness treat some best 'real' Thai when say real mean spicy  Which love when back town returning here! <EOR> when hubby mood some Thai food spot always to   introduced place friend mines going many years   never disappointed any dishes   But honestly always seem same  things chicken pad Thai fried chicken green curry fried rice which seems staple Thai food   my parents short vacation also loved it! mind first time trying Thai food  <EOR> I love here   moved area past summer found thai house few months ago   food always tasted fresh delicious   ordered yellow curry three times it favorite always tastes wonderful   keep myself licking bowl   Others party ordered kung pau mongollian beef sweet sour chicken lemon chicken Chicken fried rice   Everyone loved food   gotten same waitress she very sweet really tries sure pleased   She does everything sure kids happy which means alot me   realy continue back  <EOR> True authentic Thai food     when say level 10 spicy really level 10 unlike lot other places  <EOR> Despite being housed mall nice ambience very good food reasonable prices  <EOR> They best lunch special vegas!!

Well let's just say even if severe neurosis germs scrubbed Purell every 30 minutes would still offer lick sauce Panang Curry sweet peanut based curry off floor       yeah seriously Off  The  Floor   good   Given over dramatic love Panang Curry why only 4 stars?  Well customer service because servers very friendly    some Chinese dishes serve which just average   bad but amazing   also slightly screwed few orders   They're pretty bad following through requests add tofu vegetables dishes   But if don't want tweak Thai recipes special requests great dinner  <EOR> Thai House off bit rough start when delivery half hour late tummy grumbling but other little forgivable mishap am glad ordered here    The Cashew Chicken great! didn't skimp cashews most places weren't soggy often when ordering delivery  Cashew Chicken colorful consisted baby corn chunky bell peppers both red green onions carrots water chestnuts  would definitely order Cashew Chicken again    A side note careful spice when order! ordered extra spicy dish hot hell! loved but don't think many could handle level spiciness  borderline spicy when comes spice tolerance certifiably insane! I'd say scales hotness track where should be  never know some places  some restaurants order something extra spicy order EXTRA extra spicy thought worth taking stab deciphering restaurant's spicy scale all other spice whores there   My only disappointment Tom Kha soup because little sweeter would liked  still good though  just probably wouldn't order again   I'd say Thai House deserving little higher current 3 5 star rating going round 4 stars give them that  liked dinner enough keep them mind when ordering Thai future  <EOR> I suppose should clear first fess review based delivery experience  yet actually dine restaurant itself   Super excited fact actually deliver very small reasonable fee  order online major bonus world   The food delivered just over 30 minutes  packaging great  No dripping leaking  Plenty chopsticks silverware packets sauces fortune cookies  two free crunchy egg rolls!  The egg rolls very delicious  Easily some best egg rolls ever had   The two entrees ordered rather unadventurous but solidly delicious  spicy garlic pepper beef pretty much just would expect  sweet chili chicken big winner excellent batter extremely delicious sauce    And bonus points getting spicy levels just right  drop down menu online ordering where choose spicy want each dish order  Overall very solid delivery experience  day may into actual restaurant  Perhaps karaoke Friday Saturday nights? <EOR> 5 star overall dining experience  just drove few miles Vegas strip  never thought would find favorite Thai restaurant here  almost eat everyday  love Thai food  <EOR> I used love pad thai but place LA forget name! water   theirs still pretty good though   chicken satay still fav though    moist flavorful   peanut dipping sauce tasty course   service great packaged all leftovers us  <EOR> Ordered twice establishment via Eat24 hoping best  Originally order came enjoyed food however when ordering exact same items second time received different items when delivered  Ok while very disappointed simply asked refund item different  Instead apology told wrong no refund would issued  Def worth hassle food good but if going different every order  <EOR> I love place!
