Can't say enough place! <EOR> Ok Vegas where everything super overpriced but $17 3 street tacos just thrown together few broken tortilla chips came straight bag underneath     just ridiculous  super hungry only thing sounded good menu  confused server because two different people tried taking order asked same questions but overall service alright  said wasnt drinking weren't very interested me    never asked food was  place maybe 10 customers but staff still wasn't very attentive  few similar restaurants Vegas which more going better food wouldn't rush back anytime soon! <EOR> Great interior decor  two hostesses entrance engaged conversation seemed bit annoyed stop greet us  seem bothered two questions asked menu  No eye contact made when greeting when seating us  weren't many patrons inside time but wait menus drink orders quite long  figured maybe shift change just enough staff fine waiting  When received menu bit disappointed beer list  place looked really promising thought would great list craft beers but wasn't case  Food point! Excellent! only ordered beer since just took long checked on  also twice own flatware plates  really hoping off day  Remind staff if front your job greet bring customers  pretty face only lasts 2 seconds if your attitude poor  <EOR> It pretty good very pricey but double charged card did lounge too   means call rectify this    good company would offer something return time fustrations   Stay tuned  <EOR> Really expensive  food     I ordered half salad 15 bucks small The chicken very nasty did even eat  But say staff nice <EOR> Great tacos! fish lobster tacos excellent draft beers very nice well  only issue ordering food place drinks another  reconciling receipts little tricky but well worth it! <EOR> Amazing place!
