When home food still hot fresh  portion size pretty big couldn't finish whole bowl  chicken good somewhat crunchy outside nice hot inside  sure kind sauce bowl assuming some sort Kung Pao sauce? thought alright appreciated wasn't spicy although did kick it    Overall wasn't impressed but please keep mind am picky eater  think only fusion dishes Sushi restaurants  Glad try place but think just prefer Mochiko Chicken bed Furikake rice plain rice matter LOL  If fusion restaurants definitely check place out! <EOR> Tried place today lunch delicious  tried three bowls chicken fish beef  all really good  Chicken still juicy great flavor  bowl fish nice crunchy fish flaky wasn't oily all!
