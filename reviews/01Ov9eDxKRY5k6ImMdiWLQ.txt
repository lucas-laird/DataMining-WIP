 coming 2 3 times month usually middle night when easy seat   restaurant better value version Sam Woo   I normally order rice dish noodle dish tab comes around $13   Because portions generous there'd lots leftovers next day   food value excellent   What value doubly excellent free soup   However unsure soup policy because once time when visited afternoon wasn't offered soup   Perhaps order certain amount available only certain hours   Maybe should post soup policy  <EOR> Took mom lunch wanted try new place  #failed spent pretty penny completely disappointed  $125 steamed live fish crap  many Chinese food places Chinatown  Don't waste ur appetite  <EOR> I am sick place absolute crap service  food good give priced well  enough warrant coming back ridiculously horrible service time time again  anymore   I don't know but service gotten worse since last review  two ladies always night really need go  No matter good your food is  and mind food only good nothing incredibly special  your restaurant SUCKS when your service s     Seriously many times ask water bracing myself your eye rolls side mouth scowl before your job?! all food before ask different server drinks two sprites two waters hard only soda  feel bad young guys actually nice deal those women all time    Honestly I'd rather somewhere else pay more money possibly less satisfying food rather place again    If want eat order go  <EOR> We ate lunch today  food good but service terrible  think different levels service  If Chinese speak language service better noticed  same case if gwai lo white skinned  good experience  ask water brought food 10 minutes apart when ordered same time  good  <EOR> I love place! just wish didn't live far  Overall establishment Diamond Chinese behind Fashion Show Mall Industrial some best Chinese food Las Vegas   Although confirmed carnivore recommend ordering Buddha's Feast #1 favorite  All tofu vegetables rich sauce but some tastiest savory dishes ever had  really eat just rice 100% happy   Secondly ginger chicken the cold chicken display + sauce incredibly tasty  Simple food!  Lastly service okay it's busy Chinese place expect? but overall tell servers especially female short hair glasses sorry bad names try good impression aside being slammed customers  I'd suggest going late night weekend odd hour  Really happy food overall! <EOR> Authentic Chinese cuisine  only person Asian usually  always eat giant clam which prepared cilantro some kind sauce  Always freshly prepared well  snails black bean sauce little spicy tastes smells great tho  Crab meat fish maw soup usually start with  hot pot bunch times  really big variety veggies meats broths choose from  poached chicken ginger sauce along roster duck some things eat regularly  <EOR> We've going restaurant 8 years now during lunch special hours never disappoints  Fast service consistent food taste ever since affordable price if dine between 11am 4pm between 9pm till closing time 6am   I give 4 stars because ambience restaurant good didn't notice any improvements interiors  But  something prevent keep coming back place  authentic Chinese food after   I definitely recommend place excellent tasting dishes  <EOR> Chinese food legit here   You know how?  If mom says rice good then means know doing here! all rice    What separate occasions Roast Duck Roast Pork combo plate really liked roast pork because basically roasted pork belly sliced thin crispy skin  duck meaty tasty but did some pieces meaty  guess all can't meaty  Green beans scallops XO sauce flavors good but would need ask spicier next time  Salt Pepper Pork did enjoy because found most pieces mainly fat  50% meat 50% fat  Stone Crab porridge menu need talk server specialties  think may just made up? incredible because eat yummies shell!
