I would eat again  Oh! also weird bartender walking around smoking cigarette  didn't care really just didn't seem professional    Food good though! Seriously eat here  <EOR> A group friends come night heavy drinking  used come all time when SuperMex  guess chef also changed along name change because food pretty bad night  When first arrived sat section right next bar  took 10 15 minutes waters when no else restaurant  ten minutes seemed FOREVER since all pretty slizzard  When ordered food waitress seemed alright  boyfriend wanted guacamole instead refried beans  waitress kept saying wasn't possible can't that  boyfriend tried telling he'll pay extra if just give guacamole side instead beans but she still said no  But wait   when wanted extra side guac later gotten food ok? ok  whatever  ordering literally took 40 45 minutes food  no else restaurant just took stinkin long  When finally did food anyone ordered carne asada style ended really tough burnt meat  food service all around bad  really saddened good friend because hes coming since forever now find somewhere else <EOR> I don't know why place never busy  pretty decent food  quick  Salsa awesome! <EOR> Two words Happy Hour!

Note chips salsa included well!  When guacamole left wondering if cook forgot mash avocado  Now don't mind big chucks but guacamole really just diced avocados pico de gallo    Unfortunately new Tacos Tijuana nothing used be  Instead three generous street tacos before two reduced size carne asada tacos some rice beans  tacos fell victim 'soggy tortilla syndrome' where contents escaped all over plate  really wish didn't change street tacos delicious great meal themselves   Now Mexican Pizza pleasant surprise  tacos whatever reason happy hour special only covered chicken toppings  pizza good portion plenty chicken mushrooms cheese thin but crispy toastada base  Definitely great new edition menu   Our server terrible put nicely  He took ten minutes come seemed annoyed when asked repeat list 8 happy hour options they really should just print list   He never brought utensils flag down over over refills  Maybe he just having bad day but he just seemed hurried uninterested weren't even many people bar area    I give kudos management changing menu trying new things but really wish didn't downsize some better dishes  used come twice month when Supermex but now wondering if ever back  <EOR> LOVE  May repeat LOVE food here  Great portions amazing salsa food always keeps coming back more!
