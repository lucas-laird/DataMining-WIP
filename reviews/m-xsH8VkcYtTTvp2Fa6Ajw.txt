Big mistake Pancho's! know no other restaurant such ridiculous policy  margaritas okay liked chips salsa  Bar waitress fabulous fun  did notice Tiffany style chandeliers I don't know fit Mexican theme over bar afterthought run exposed electrical conduit which perplexed building just constructed    We called dining area approximately 45 minutes but 5 6 hostesses ready seat clue waited more 5 minutes hostess stand while figured out   Upon entering dining room literally felt if walked into jungle  place filled extreme almost obnoxious amount artificial plants trees  Clearly concept less more lost designers  lighting very bright might want heavily consider dimming evenings no background music playing weren't impressive atmosphere  waiter very good attentive which made pleasant dining experience  lobster enchiladas really delicious! husband chicken chimichanga he liked but didn't knock socks off   didn't stick around another drink desert because atmosphere inviting  husband commented walk car he probably wouldn't back unfortunately I'd agree him  <EOR> This place far most favorite Mexican restaurant   Everything chips salsa enchiladas tacos tastes delicious authentic!!!!  used Lindo because Ricardo's gone Macayos far house but thrilled find place!!!  Yes prices slightly higher Macayos Ricardo's but Downtown Summerlin   real estate significant premium attached it   excellent happy hour if you're budget! <EOR> Since when appropriate wait staff taking shots job?  Two very large shots within 20 minutes  time left she very obviously feeling tipsy   see drunk waitress Huge liability but maybe  just me   All while myself others around sat neglected empty beverage glasses?  Food ok but worth price any means    service ridiculous  <EOR> We tried Pancho's because received BOGO coupon  Overall food good but disappointed did serve beans chips salsa no soup entrees no horchata any traditional Mexican drinks they margaritas beer   came short compared long time favorite Mexican restaurant but would eat again if BOGO coupons keep coming plus free dessert checking thru Yelp <EOR> This favorite Mexican restaurant town  top always Lindo Michocan    But came surpassed expectations  yet disappointed anything tried here  food awesome service fantastic  price may seem steep but they're large portions imo  come back many times again  <EOR> Wow  Just wow  Tinga Poblano must list!  manager great thanks bean dip!  definitely back  sure there's Naughty Maggie name it  Maybe 2 <EOR> Had lunch here  really liked it  cheese enchilada chili relleno  yummy!

She slow  Took 20 minutes just first drinks another 20 minutes some chips  Then worst part entire night BILL    cue horror music   bill took 2 hours again exaggerating finished eating 9pm until 11pm figuring damn bill   Why?

Let's start unfriendly borderline snarky hostess   didn't name but she dark brown hair   restaurant lit darkly tables barely see your food   Which probably intended can't see horrible presentation plates   ordered 2 cheese enchilada combo   enchiladas much cheese top them  all could taste   rice hard all any Mexican Spanish rice ever had   possibly serve awful Mexican rice Mexican restaurant?  meal under $20 which completely overpriced!  friend wasn't hungry she ordered side beans rice   serving she baby sized $6   daughter ordered kid's meal cheese quesadilla   kid's meal $10 tiny quesadilla hard rice   Let say she's better Taco Bell   tortillas hard rocks quesadilla   flan ordered dessert ok but drenched cinnamon   Mexican food many places even Mexico   taquerias amazing sad say I'd rather Taco Bell ever return place   price point place does match quality food service   waiter barely present until asked bus person if he could bring dessert   done plates while server never came back ask if ready dessert meal was   He did however bring check picking back he opened right front see much tip he received   completely rude unprofessional!  He jerk period   don't mind paying price good food good service but restaurant neither those things   NEVER return overpriced restaurant rude service disgusting food  <EOR> We walked saw stage know know screen set when some karaoke happen  Well know There's karaoke every Tuesday night  love Pancho 's <EOR> Making reservations Open Table snap  seated soon arrived early evening Saturday 6pm   decor ambiance very pleasant  sat upstairs nice view hacienda style layout  sound level upstairs moderate could easily conversation The wait staff attentive courteous  Salsa chips very good  meals arrived good pace well prepared quite tasty  enchilada Ramon wife quesadillas  Granted prices higher end but unexpected Downtown Summerlin location  If want cheap Mexican food always dine Rubios!

Happy 5 de Mayo! ll back! <EOR> This place gorgeous filled artifacts all over Mexico  Beautiful venue wedding party  food great too  highly recommend Birria Chef Ramon dish which phenomenal  flavors danced tongue Mexican songs lament servers great there's attached bar plays sports well live music weekends  Definitely great place check out  <EOR> One most incredible parts beautiful place knowing parking lot mere 6 months ago! interior space amazing! Truly transformative   I heard through local grapevine having some opening bumps decided wait bit let them work out  When recently invited meet friends dinner thought perfect timing   Right off bat greeted big smiles polite staff across board  Our waiter awesome  All perfect    So now asking    sounds great why only 3 stars? The reason 3 stars food really super mediocre   And wanted great! But sadly definitely not   On top being completely average very expensive compared other mexican places food caliber  enchilada chili relleno just shy $20  could easily list 10 places close 1 2 price better food  suspect why online menu does any pricing  Most people area know high  sentiment regarding food census table no thrilled   Don't wrong NO ISSUE $20 entree! If food amazing all need know! But food far amazing  Bummer because really beautiful space filled awesome staff! <EOR> We originally San Diego excellent Mexican food little difficult finding comparable Mexican cuisine Las Vegas   Ponchos pretty good margaritas very good   prices little steep pay real Mexican food San Diego  <EOR> There 5 women standing front when entered person greeted asked if needed anything  sat ourselves bar area bartender rude waitress seemed inconvenienced having serve when only table section  Food good but over priced definitely returning  <EOR> Wayyyyy expensive mediocre food  Didn't realize pricey was  Won't ever dine again  crazy prices charge I'd much rather Javier's!! <EOR> This PF Chang's Mexican food  don't mean compliment but also understand need such places  regular Mexican fair double price  Maybe necessary because expense DS location  Yes food good great but wasn't disappointed  salsa actually kick it  wasn't watered down  But $15 burrito no sides? tried argue could've gotten same burrito Cardenas Roberto's half easy  But then again Roberto's Cardenas market food court isn't exactly where Summerlinites would family meal date  it   Just look around you  many actual hispanic people see besides employees ? ZERO  Why would be? personally don't eat Korean restaurants where no Koreans eating no matter nice place looks  But still gave them benefit doubt because demographics Summerlin  But Vegas whole big enough Hispanic community would see least person eating busy Saturday afternoon if place really good  Michiochan restaurants full Hispanic families   The entire decor designed attract non Hispanic Summerlin crowd into thinking they're eating ethnic food without having drive down questionable parts town so  would rather eat Cardenas market similar quality half price  But yes viable option some people  Again it  must pay double atmosphere    But final punch gut paying $9 99 kids meal 1 3 frijoles 1 3 rice 1 enchilada or 1 taco but fish taco extra $   NO DRINKS included  guess live Summerlin afford pay right? Upper Middle Class people overpay EVERYTHING  <EOR> The service good bar nice but food worth cost  brought three flower wraps fajita dish wife sharing charged $3 dollars extra when asked couple more  Lindo's!!!! much better! <EOR> Went back second time today worst  1 1 2 hours later food came out  six 2 meals right other 4 all wrong  think price high food isn't worth it  $3 95 Coke give small glass  going back place <EOR> I'm giving Pancho's 4 star rating because did great experience  staff welcoming informative even management cake over offered money saving suggestion next time  Thanks Jimmy! My three littles each enchiladas  enjoyed them  No complaints   I ordered Enchiladas de Avocado y Artichoke  lovely  Everything could've hoped reading description  jalapeño margarita scored 7 10   Hubby enjoyed some steak tacos beer    In addition entrees also ordered large Guac table  $15! know Summerlin but JESUS!  Our check came $123  Roughly  Typically wouldn't budget dinner 5 over $80  Fortunately snagged coupon 1 free entree left $24 tip  $130 door   So break down you Expensive  Great service  Good quality fresh food  Don't expect authentic Mexican cuisine   The restaurant itself BEAUTIFUL    We probably avoid coming back littles stick happy hour bar areas just two us  Big savings over there  <EOR> I highly recommend dining here!

Just because place Downtown Summerlin think away charging outrageous  mean OUTRAGEOUS  prices simple Americanized Mexican food  Yes restaurant gorgeous inside colorful clay tiles fountain middle dining room but putting high cost primo real estate onto unsuspecting customers' backs    I love Mexican food Pancho's drew appealing menu  first sign going disappointing meal when waiter brought complimentary chips salsa table  judge place its chips pretty awful  cold salted all honestly tasted big bag  be  Ditto salsa runny bland just gross  Pass    Next queso fundido artichoke hearts  tasted more Paula Deen's artichoke dip Mexican queso don't order if just want tasty melted cheese  wasn't bad but wasn't good either  Wouldn't again    I dining two friends beef quesadilla margarita other fajitas  ordered Especial de Cabo  food ranged truly inedible mediocre all grossly overpriced see pattern ?

Extremely overpriced food ok sad part even waiter doesn't know anything food ask suggestion he says he no clue now they're sending two lol never ever restaurant good luck them!! <EOR> So many past debates coming into Panchos decided visit today National Margarita Day during happy hour  Since opening heard same reviews and Yelp reviews confirm rumors food yummy but very overpriced  heard best time during Happy Hour finally decided check them during Happy Hour  Quickly into visit immediately agreed prices very high including happy hour  ambiance awesome feel you're Vegas but prices remind haven't left city even happy hour prices   We sat bar service great bartender manager food runner but ugh doesn't compensate high menu prices  Mexican food affordably reasonable but $15 guacamole??? couldn't convince myself pay price  bf ordered Wahoos tacos $19 2 tacos rice beans but only meal day he splurged  He said yummy but expensive     Also menu very long  feel you're reading book when browsing through options which immediately turned off  Honestly took bit find guacamole b c scamming menu looking blended right into other menu items   Great ambiance but high prices pay it <EOR> Ambiance great but food falls short being authentic  Food very bland  Price high sub par food  Service okay  Disappointing reunion dinner friends  Won't going back  <EOR> The service nice but took while   friends regulars    said t unusual food takes long   Chips salsa kept coming yummy!

Add tip bill total over $92  definitely better food larger portions local taco shops spent less 1 3 entire family   Sorry Pancho's but listen your customers reviews  lot them saying exact same thing am  Even though most those reviewers may back protect future patrons  only very few people decide leave reviews  no idea many people decide write opinion decide come back because value  <EOR> Too expensive is!

Beautiful decorations spirit Christmas  last week returning week friends  food outstanding always fresh delicious  Definitely top Mexican restaurant Vegas Summerlin  service friendly attentive  <EOR> Let start initial impressions   Making reservation efficient friendly painless   building beautiful obvious well thought out   interior equally beautiful great looking theme    Unfortunately praise stops there    seated just under 9 minutes before server acknowledged existence took drink order   Upon return he two three incorrect   Upon second return he still them incorrect     After drinks merry go round ordered meals  While awaiting entrees munched away fresh made chips honestly shining star food offered here    server assistant wandered proceeded refill half empty glass Sprite water   pointed error he replaced fairly quickly     Our entrees arrived reasonable amount time but unfortunately only two them along partial order another table   third entree delivered manager couple minutes later   Part wishes never brought them us   uninspired boring quite frankly tasteless group entrees   chicken tacos some very flavorful meat tucked inside corn tortilla little else   refried beans appear rice bland   $18 00 entree!  The chicken burrito just downright awful   think more flavorful burrito Roberto's Cafe Rio    chili verde burrito some life it   pork properly cooked verde sauce flavorful presented nicely    served normally present beans rice which same chicken burrito    would think $17 00 would meal just burrito plate     I spoke manager length when he came sat down empty fourth seat   Nice enough fellow apologized service issues heard critique meal  don't think he took honesty heart      Overall say place some systemic issues close doors within year if don't correct them   service awful food mediocre best pricing way line comparable establishments Summerlin Mall   won't back surprised when name changes RANDOM_NAME Michoacan   waste money whomever opened place  <EOR> Really expensive frozen food quality   Also lack customer service baffling   told waiter celebrating birthday   He didn't even ask if wanted order dessert   dishes took forever too   seated upstairs where dark cave   Probably wouldn't able see food   enchiladas flavorless rice hard   gave star cute decor   don't recommend place   Taco Bell higher quality   bet rent expensive DT Summerlin but doesn't justify $70 2 TV dinners <EOR> Average food but great service  sure reservation place gets packed   as evident Thursday night every table full  hosted group clients everyone enjoyed themselves  Beautiful decor especially downstairs area fountain  <EOR> Had dinner last night  Food good but service spotty  waited while appetizers come out  finally did main courses came 3 minutes later  asked them bring them back kitchen bring them when finished appetizers  Duh!

All entrees approx $15+   Now it    Mexican food often marginalized placed cheap food category most Chinese restaurants outside Strip Chinatown   If you're looking really great fancy Mexican meal should probably charged it  But argue price does match food provided   ordered chicken mango salad $18   salad good but $18 good   salad portion boxed greens costco mango very ripe  Chicken juicy some great umami flavoring but overly impressed salad whole   friend ordered fish tacos which came cook fish shaped plate! Also $18 likewise worth price    Ultimately Pancho's fun festive restaurant but catering wrong crowd  If cartoon character wearing sombrero your sign prob shouldn't charging $20 meal   Just sayin'    Would def recommend fun date night bday   Service friendly but most efficient  <EOR> Surprised reviews here   Went happy hour bar Saturday afternoon plenty room pick seat quickly taken care of   The food happy hour menu good weekends even though menu says drinks only Saturday Sunday  waitress made sure aware  Started chips salsa really good    Ordered appetizer platter which amazing  good highly recommend  friend tortilla soup said delish  also ordered Queso tasted dish sour cream huge  waitress noticed weren't eating asked told wasn't favorite expected she said she would take off bill no problem  She also mentioned taking off menu     We also each two drinks  Bill split half $28  Could cheaper especially happy hour but good  <EOR> This re creation lavish Mexican hacienda serves beautifully presented dishes very ample portions  friend could shared entree appetizer however eager try some unusual main courses instead  ordered Especial de Cabo which combination shrimp real crab chicken breast topped melted queso succulent simmered pork dish   Tinga Poblano   sauces both dishes complex yet subtle  course ordered Tres leche cake dessert which arrived great birthday fanfare honor friend  Pancho's just restaurant experience  <EOR> I agree most everyone else way over priced!
