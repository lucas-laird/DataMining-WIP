Awesome food great flavor profiles    definitely back! <EOR> Ever since posted coming soon banners excited try Moo Woo   But now tried them going only visit   think take little extra time drive over Spring Mountain area other locations where Korean BBQ restaurants little more seasoned impressing retaining guests   My trial during quiet lunchtime   took while someone notice then even though said just still sat huge BBQ grill table   other smaller tables available nearby   gracious redeeming Yelp offer  wet towel pack facial   brought nice amount banchan fresh types kimchi   The lunch menu isn't huge but good variety  ordered Galbitrang $13 short rib soup which adequate amount boneless short ribs modest amount noodles  broth nondescript  mild salty undertones  which amp some kimchi  wasn't expecting rich simmered ramen broth but hoped something more umami   Service forgettable   Maybe better job actual Korean BBQ grills evenings but would hope any restaurant would set higher service standards no matter time day size group   such hopes experiencing place especially since area valley use more diversity   Unfortunately Moo Woo turned fairly average especially compared if you're willing take short drive elsewhere  <EOR> I can't believe haven't already left review place  already 3 times! consistency customer service incredible  They're always quick fast tend every need  food great    Woo Combo always get  kimchi soup good but think tofu soup even better! quality meat great  don't think pricy all  pay for! place great environment great food great service  <EOR> My favorite!!! #1 Korean Food Hawaii hands down!!!

Keep good work! <EOR> most meats marinated awesome marinade  waitresses very nice helpful  new cool spot definitely recommend! <EOR> Moo Woo good choice Korean BBQ no AYCE btw but unless live immediate area better options Spring Mountain  Nevertheless if decide Moo Woo then won't disappointed   First off love current check in deal  August 2017 receive wet towel facial mask  Sort different your plain 'ol free drink deal isn't it? Seriously +1 uniqueness!  The interior clean looks pretty cool  simple place looks without screaming kbbq much  Moo Woo located shopping district plenty parking spaces well very accessible   The meat choices pretty pricey but delicious nonetheless  variety choose portions decent  I'd say most choices fresh very filling  think favorite beef briskets but marinated chicken great well  banchan good especially kim chee   Overall experience Moo Woo enjoyable  good see Korean BBQ joint part town  think solid choice but say since à la carte expect high quality meats because paying premium  meat good but same quality even AYCE places such Gen BBQ Henderson  Moo Woo faaar where live probably won't back while but I'd recommend anyone around its vicinity  <EOR> Very clean pleasing atmosphere  Food decent but better  Gave 4 stars service ok food  <EOR> This place awesome! Totally hit spot Asian BBQ  start bringing bunch little appetizers cucumbers favorite  kimchi really good too! fried potstickers corn cheese appetizers both delicious  dinner marinated prime beef cooked hot grill table smelled good even better when ate it! Moo Woo best! <EOR> Another victim 4 5 star rated restaurant  literally worst kbbq experience restaurant away because no competition side town    I came Mother's Day family 3 first time based good reviews  sister ordered moo combo share mom bibimbap   The moo combo said feeds 2 3 people 53 bucks but surprised if even feed person  came 8 thin brisket 1 strip pork belly 1 strip pork neck 1 sirloin bulgogi spicy chicken smallest possible portion ever seen   Keep mind even quality meats usually lunch cheap price ayce places   Next service 2 guys helping Asian white guy  honestly think something wrong white guy because all he could say here's that  Everytime he would bring food he would only say here's that  When forgot steamed egg bulgogi 20 minutes asked guy brought just said here's when paid he gave check back all he said here's nothing else  He obviously new because he always asking Asian server but should train friendly teach manner words thank  sorry before teaching anything else    Next ventilation  place some serious ventilation issue compared all other kbbq places  mom couldn't breathe halfway through meal outside fresh air  also headache middle meal because terrible ventilation   Overall probably worst kbbq place Las Vegas  Hugely overpriced tiny portion horrible service ventilation issues  only kbbq place area know away it  people thinking dining don't same mistake drive little further better kbbq experience  <EOR> This place pretty legit! live close come two three times  all eat  portions good  ordered beef special  Everything tasted authentic  think docked star only because decor minimal  love Korean food much closer China town  priced average Korean food  fan! <EOR> Service good staff nice  brisket which very fatty chicken all dark meat good if  like  Would nice some white meat  Otherwise pleasant nice location  <EOR> It first time absolutely loved it!
