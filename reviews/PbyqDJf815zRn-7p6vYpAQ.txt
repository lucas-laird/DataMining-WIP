This location inside SLS quite large  only full service restaurant but also houses casinos sports book beer garden  There's quite bit seating throughout location but way set weird seems no real uniformity  Alongside seating indoor bar there's small tables high tops couches sports book  Then when walk outside you've more picnic table style seating another fairly large bar  good 50+ feet long  There's just lot going depending where sit may able order food just sit down enjoy drink while watching games  If coming strictly food though offer text notifications gamble whatever while waiting table   Looking online seems menu pretty much same other locations there's good amount options too  If you're feeling burger salads Un Beef sandwiches even sausages  sides pretty typical burger joint fries customized handful ways  There's 8 burgers choose Umami no different others infamous no substitution rule full effect  Although let request different cooking temperature meat  Standard cooking temp medium rare just ya know   We decided order fried pickles share opted Truffle Especiale burger  Oddly enough receiving order waitress told she wasn't huge fan fried pickles  couldn't disagree more definitely some better had  batter thick crunchy flavorful stuck pickle completely  never fell apart liked pickle inside wasn't hot couldn't eat it  Adding flavor nice side jalapeno ranch creamy just touch heat   Although bit small side burger equally impressive  If you're fan truffle Umami does disappoint!

I cannot speak other days but group 4 girls Sunday night take advantage 50% off bill locals  restaurant HUGE wasn't packed  believe understaffed because waiter took 20 minutes come table ask drinks  far longest waited water  ONLY 20 minutes because flagged waiter down while he serving customers two tables away    During those 20 minutes friend even left order use restroom maybe took number 2 bathroom far away returned shocked hadn't gotten waters yet  Actually hadn't spoken waiter yet when she sat back down    Despite slow start food came within 15 minutes ordering  sure if anything letting waiter know rush catch show    I don't blame waiter he trying best serve customers  Perhaps understaffed didn't system figured completely yet    As burger  I ve Umami L A  similar  burger good but world    Truffle fries don't when fries soggy  did gravy looking sauce all over fries flavor sauce meh    Onion rings VERY GOOD  come back another day try few other items  When rush good 2 hours kill  <EOR> Great burgers! sample plate 3 different types all good  servers very quick nice salad too  If SLS would check lunch  place bet sports book well  <EOR> This place always delicious  first time but first time trying truffle burger which would definitely recommend  Also waitress Mandy fantastic! She gives great recommendations attentive! great easy choice when Vegas  <EOR> Umami fans SoCal should know drill most part everyone else Umami decent burger place some unique little spins although menu doesn't seem really innovated all much many years past taste just okay      The restaurant primarily beer burger place some side options salads such   If you're staying SLS sure bring down coupon book case some interesting options food like free ice cream sandwiches      Burger wise tried Ahi Tuna burger   Presentation fine   taste simply okay   burger oddly didn't much flavor although ton ingredients it   friend said he enjoyed onion rings truffle fries along unique slightly spiced ketchup   ice cream sandwiches weren't bad but nothing special   Also beet salad side which surprisingly big   Didn't flavor very much go around some reason though   Prices vary $8 $15 per item     They regular beer bar menu sorta extensive beer list   Surprised beer flight limited just few core beers included such not so great examples Coor's Bud   specialty beers very least which worth checking if it   also bar area video poker     Decor wise you're looking very sports bar setting   seem beer garden back although when no around outer area stayed indoors which plenty seating tons TV's     I'm personally surprised closes 11PM being beer garden sports bar Vegas location   Perhaps lack crowd night but feel restaurant bar should open much later especially late munchies crowd     In end I'd give restaurant 3 1 2 stars   bad any means hasn't lost much transition Las Vegas   just doesn't seem evolved much its taste even lacks little bit wow taste factor  <EOR> When place first opened food amazing  Now honestly nasty waste money  Burgers dry used be  Also rid some best food items menu  <EOR> Spectacular burgers beer! truffle burger   off HOOK  banana beer dark chocolaty coffee beer YUMMY!

The outside bar closed because hot   Hmmm  thought SLS supposed cater locals    So sit gaming bar   I put $20 machine then bartender informs large beers r compted when u play   Isn't nice?  ordered    After said something she did fix issue smaller beer  However already done once again place    I guess only way c concert SLS early enjoy pop or two bring your own    That's b doing out  <EOR> Great service burgers  Would definitely come back again  Lots televisions well sporting events <EOR> I've looking forward trying Umami Burger ever since saw TV special them few years back  spike own burgers everything fish sauce marmite burger knew could appreciate   It exciting moment when finally wrapped hands around $12 95 Umami Burger consisting 6 ounce beef patty reportedly made American Wagyu beef seasoned soy sauce ground dried porcini mushrooms dried fish head dust  Toppings included roasted tomatoes tomatoes slow baked soy sauce shiitake mushrooms caramelized onions round parmesan cheese crisp referred frico  burger served Portuguese style roll   Imagine horror flavor burger tasted muddled going down almost burger made meat but instead mushrooms vegan ingredients  fair taste burger lingering mouth swallowed good quite beefy  but something off mile this   After another bite identified burger waaaay under seasoned despite whatever umami infusions happened meat  lack salt burger tragic  think drinking Coca Cola without sweetener sugar otherwise weird jarring would be  Salt nature's best most powerful flavor enhancer  bizarre restaurant focused achieving big umami flavor would eschew salt likely relying soy sauce salt rather seasoning meat manually   Another crucial element lacking best ways generate umami flavor invoke Maillard Reaction e g  browning reaction generating flavorful crust meat  Yet Umami Burger looked baked rather grilled did through process arguably most important flavor producing reaction within all cooking   Some toppings more effective others  roasted tomato confit good yay! flavor! but caramelized onions just barely discernable  burger needed cheese problem parmesan cheese crisp doesn't hug burger way melted slice cheese would seems very separate everything else when chewing all   On other hand thin Truffle Fries ordered very tasty  salty crisp smothered melted cheese well restrained amount truffle flavor  Best all they're free Yelp check in  If found myself SLS late night hungry may hit Umami Burger fries but probably would another burger   I'm interested knowing missing here  Somehow restaurant remains business known its burgers  am getting?  Food Décor Service 2 6 2 5 3 5 <EOR> Decided try place since we'd Bachi Burger last Vegas trip wanted try something similar but new   Well should gone Bachi Burger because place nowhere near good   food decent but nothing special   maple bacon fries probably better burger should tell something   I wouldn't come back again  <EOR> So excited umami burger Vegas!!

On separate note review your bill credit card bill carefully if choose eat here  don't know if its willful fraud just lots billing mistakes favor but overbilling problems multiple Umami burgers  previous experience Hermosa Beach location billed card twice two separate days same meal  took multiple calls Visa chargeback fix situation  During visit Umami Las Vegas tried split $170 bill tip included 3 credit cards  Each card charged $90  When complained manager he claimed typo waitress meant type $60 per person  signed left    but just clear $60 x 3 does equal $170   I concept restaurant branded sportsbook  just don't one  gonna spend time traditional sportsbooks where watch games free drinks rather overcharged already overpriced ones  <EOR> Best burger iv long while Umami burger but when opened single mushroom mean cmon its 14 dollar burger only spare one! read another comment said 3 guess getting cheaper  thin fries also kinda awkward eat ketchup tasted weird  <EOR> I'd eaten location San Francisco   location much nicer!

The Beer Garden outdoor patio facing Las Vegas Blvd  several televisions along walls showing multiple games  seating picnic tables very casual  There's also entrance exit street but can't just seat yourself  great atmosphere especially beautiful weather day  don't allow smoking patio but some patrons thought hanging arm off patio railing meant abiding  Yeah no  smoke bothersome off putting   Our server really nice supporting staff everyone relatively attentive needs  manager constantly walking around restaurant he approachable  issue where watching particular game switched abruptly however audio remained game spoke server manager resolved  First told server change channels anyone any reason Really?   Second told manager games switch automatically during Half Time however television did revert back game resumed second quarter  took approximately 15 minutes game FINALLY appear! No explanation occurred  can't imagine anyone being happy if happens often during big games   Truffled Beet Salad $7 truffled ricotta smoked almonds wild baby arugula truffle dressing  arugula fresh  truffle wasn't overpowering  Overall decent salad but nothing special  missing something didn't umami factor   Fried Pickles $6 artisan crafted pickles jalapeño ranch shaved Parmesan  pickles okay still bit crunch  batter light   Nothing remotely worthy repeat   Smushed Potatoes $4 roasted garlic aioli  good  potatoes nice soft inside while having some exterior texture  roasted garlic aioli great   Thin Fries $3 Nothing special but terrible   Umamify Your Fries Truffle 'Em $3 truffle cheese fondue truffle salt  definitely made boring fries much more exciting  Nothing I'd come back though   Hatch Burger $11 Roasted green chiles house American cheese roasted garlic  just okay  wasn't cooked medium rare requested  nothing exciting even good  barely recall its taste now   The Original $12 Parmesan frico shiitake mushroom roasted tomato caramelized onions Umami house ketchup  burger terrible  burger no flavor didn't anything remotely close umami experience it  Oh know says shiitake mushroom your burger?
