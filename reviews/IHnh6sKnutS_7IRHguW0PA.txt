Open 24 hours satisfy craving  <EOR> Good food tasted quite authentic  fish chicken pork taco finished them all pretty quickly  highlight definitely fish taco heaps avocado flaky white fish  Very nice planning back  <EOR> I've eaten many taquerias being Mexican all say Carne Asada burrito best ever had It least 1 1 2 lb  salsas all REALLY good If hole walls authentic Mexican suggest eating here <EOR> Was passing through way airport hotel saw little spot   Definitely ghetto shopping plaza some shady characters but could tell outside authentic Mexican  inside ordered two carnitas burritos flautas chicken    burritos enormous!! Don't understand all people complaining price  $6 45 loaded carnitas burrito weighed around 3lbs    The mistake made getting sauces   really need add sauces burrito else bit dry don't add any it    Overall sweet little find worth stop  <EOR> I've eating years   my review long over due  serve best Mexican food far Vegas  all well prepared presented well workers cheerful  course nice clean dining room  dumpy neighborhood but stands out  <EOR> Very great food  husband late night staff very friendly  ordered burrito torta  Very flavorful filling  portions fairly big definitely worth price  <EOR> For Tortas place visit! prices very affordable quality meat use good love steak torta favorite also love Habanero salsa unique town advise super hot if can't handle spices avoid salsa but if enjoy salsas wanna try  also past tried pork Torta also good <EOR> Another great find off beaten path   ordered two cabeza two carne asada two al pastor fish taco   Off all them al pastor best   cabeza great carne asada according dining partners pretty good  The fish taco turn grilled tilapia   partner expecting baja style deep fried   brought back counter asked if indeed offered variety fish taco   owner cook explained only deep fryer primarily french fries frying fish would taint oil   Perfectly understandable   But here's where gets good   He offered another taco any version wanted ahead keep fish offering   He understood partner didn't but insisted enjoy myself   admit wasn't style either   HA!  Minutes later only did he bring back replacement taco but two them!  Outstanding customer service   They self serve salsa bar better average selection salsas highlight being very unusual white based sauce very spicy   Cheers offering Oaxacan based very very rare salsa    Limes carrots also offered   May considered many Yelp 3 star but customer service absolutely bumps place 4 star   Buche birria other varieties tacos offered   Location may seem somewhat undesirable but is   back would recommend place anyone jonesing tj style tacos   1 5 miles strip  <EOR> I REALLY WANTED LOVE PLACE but just didn't   One evening driving around running errands just wanted classic divey street taco  Haven't found solid Mex place but Las Famosas looked perfect spot  tail end auto repair shop looked promising    Ordered two carnitas tacos verde sauce  Over $6  little pricey two small tacos  Oh well hoped amazing    They weren't  just weren't  lime which came taco literally no juice when squeezed  Dry   The carnitas meat tough obviously laying around quite some time  Dog gone it! threw all trash home first bite  Very frustrating when you're excited try something new just turns garbage    You should know better  know full well when meat lime matter fresh if should tossed  Very disappointing  <EOR>
