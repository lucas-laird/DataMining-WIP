Not favourite Gordon Biersch Restaurant for example prefer San Francisco but might since prefer San Francisco Las Vegas general but definitely worth considering  same good beer great burgers garlic fries  <EOR> Food always good  BUT SERVICE????? Arrived last night 9 45pm 20 patrons entire place  Wanted show place brother recently moved nearby  Waitress took order 9 55 helpful  ordered late nite happy hour menu sliders pizza beers fish stew  Beers then arrived time still waiting till 10 30 food asked waitress check she offered bread because delay  Checked food again 10 45  Food arrived 10 55  saw kitchen doing food rotation saw no sign manager all night  Waitress miscalculated bill last nite happy hour corrected apologized  Embarrassing! <EOR> My absolute favorite beer!! hefeweizen best!!

Overall good experience great service decent food selection  <EOR> Gordon Biersch ist eine Restaurant Kette mit eigener Brauerei  Die Auswahl unterschiedlichen Biersorten ist dementsprechend hoch   Die Speisekarte führt viele Fleischgerichte aber auch Salate Pasta und Fisch  Dazu gibt es auch Ausgefallenes wie Curry   Der Service ist schnell und freundlich  auch wenn die Frage nach schwarzem Tee verneint und daraufhin Earl Grey angeboten wurde  <EOR> Just giving updated review cause Winterbock menu now!!   Winterbock beer great carmel chocolate flavor but ours little flat cold enough me   Chili Impressive  very tasty hearty   cup wasn't small  shared husband   basic side salad ordered app basic  lol  spiced pecans tom cucumber cheddar cheese pepper jack cheese jalepeno ranch!!! YuM yUm!  California Cobb flatbread fresh greens tossed balsamic vinegrette dressing then put top completes taste flatbread   must try  loved didn't use blue cheese!  We back try some other items before take winter menu away <EOR> If you've lived Vegas any length time probably invited join group coworkers Happy Hour Gordon Biersch some point  countless times 9+ years lived going away parties just random group gatherings but never gave much thought quality food  when recently sent over during day another work related item suggestion arose take opportunity check burger  can't say anyone mentioned burger throughout time 'burger blogger' bit skeptical idea but gladly took challenge always do   There two Biersch locations town long standing Paradise near airport newer location Summerlin  actually haven't Summerlin because far better selections area if going bother eating around there  same could said Paradise location but probably cheaper touristy selections around there  exterior restaurant still pretty cool but interior's 'brewery' look starting seem bit dated  Whether you're lunch dinner place always fairly populated between close proximity convention halls hotels well adjacent office parks  plenty seats around bar lounge well booths tables both inside out  menu all over place appetizers pizzas sandwiches desserts name it  While may offer healthiest options decent Happy Hour few good snacks   While pondering which Knife Fork Burgers try waitress suggested off the menu but highly popular Swiss mushroom burger which also happens favorites jumped it  Served large knife skewered through massive burger looked great upon arrival  flaky gooey bun quite good very well proportioned meat  patty seemed pre formed but good quality char flavor present upon first few bites but little lost everything else once really into it  mushrooms great flavor Swiss melted well but incredibly present  Overall very juicy flavorful huge surprise   Their 'legendary' fries good but actually bit garlicky me  Also whole batch bit undercooked soggy weren't best example day  huge portion easily enough two people if you're looking share  $11 50 burger great deal considering its size quality large portion fries proximity convention oriented hotels  While hate spending $2 95 iced tea $15 62 still bad deal everything get  Swap beer you've yourself pretty good meal  <EOR> Bad service  bad mean slow unconcerned management  walk take 10 minutes server show up  35 minutes placing order looking manager enquire food   On being told period beyond restaurant waiting policy still charged dishes   And when food did arrive steak burned mussels even cooked  meant sending food back waiting cooked again   Never coming back place food maybe only beer  two star only beer  <EOR> Poor service  Took long even water No napkins silverware until asked   Garlic fries tasted really regular me Didn't live hype  Gorgonzola pear salad very splendid I highly suggest it  pecan crusted chicken top point Pears didnt seem fresh but everything else good <EOR> Went meet several associates dinner  While waiting rest party 4 sat bar  Worst service possible  Excuse really busy 5 30 Thursday 5 14   Waited 15 minutes past party being seated finally bill 4 bar drinks could join them  Food server better  great chopped salad split undercooked doughy pizza spouse food wash  McCormick Schmicks Bahama Breeze next time sure  Note manager Wake G B !

Best all VIP style experience reasonably priced under $100 pp including all taxes tips!   Would highly recommend Gordon Biersch anyone planning large group dinner las Vegas! <EOR> I ordered food take out few times while visiting Vegas but disappointed every time  quality presentation food bad  learned lesson never order food Gordon Biersch again  <EOR> Brought party 20 people last night  Arrangements made confirmed 1 12  arrived time completely unprepared us  server did great job attempting keep but impossible task person  Among some worst dishes rare ahi looked overcooked pork chop seafood dish salmon obligatory missed order fish tacos guests  Gordon Biersch many times around country pathetic  <EOR> I hate writing crappy reviews  know some people relish don't  Businesses trying hard  Owners staff managers trying hard    But food just wasn't NEAR Gordon Biersch quality used be    Calamari  Please don't serve this  Literally little chewy rubber bands bland breading  Zero stars    The famous garlic fries  Way over done nearly enough garlic! star    Southwestern rolls yummy  Spicy full flavor  Four stars    Flat bread pizza  Just complete miss  Nothing artisan quality even ho hum came out  tiny completely lacking any touch  Zero stars    The ONLY reason giving experience two stars because server doing best really really off food    This complete plea management  review food coming kitchen soon possible  Gordon Biersch quality all!!! <EOR> After having visited other location Las Vegas incredibly disappointed many levels    I come expect certain level service  don't mean speed alone realize visited Friday night would busy  But staff impersonal uninterested acted if getting paid $30 hr  no matter treated us    The food though don't know didn't even compare other location  signature garlic fries soggy rather crisp fresh parsley usually tops lot apparently wilted under heat lamp  Fresh chopped garlic seemingly afterthought on GARLIC fries? unsoftened spicy   The turkey burger looked tasted felt leftover meatloaf  leftover last night but maybe last week  fresh avocado only saving grace though steamed veggies side weren't hurting anything   I don't usually give restaurants hard time weekends but combined service flavor or lack both offensive  <EOR> Seriously Bacon Cheeseburger garlic fries ultimate meal   fries garlic Parmesan them but crispy outside   yourself favor skip lettuce tomato    My wife loves cedar plank salmon pecans   <EOR> Service good beer great  liked blue crab artichoke dip  ribeye less great quality  thick much flavor other gorgonzola top  ahi tuna salad very blend  remembered better food     <EOR> Pretty cool little brewery located off strip better menu its quality food  All meals ordered table rather small portions  kobe beef burger garlic fries wasn't terrible amazing lacked flavor could used some seasoning    I also hefeweizen which pretty good  Unfortunately did chance partake any other alcoholic beverages    I'd suggest place group looking cool place hang good beer but looking snag amazing meal  <EOR> I used frequent place many years ago when would live reggae   back then atmosphere AMAZING diverse   would never million years imagine different types people there   cowboys Rastafarians Hispanics African Americans Asian Americans mean name NEVER any bs nobody fighting fussing really cool see all different types people gathering place! moved away awhile moved back Vegas  i came other night very disappointed   everything changed   now know things can't stay same forever but honestly change worst   they rid Reggae night bartenders rude Condescending just over all sucked  i 1 beer then left  i won't coming back anytime soon    <EOR> I absolute loved beer  serviced sux though  farmhouse burger which really cheap large portion  husband Colby burger  way more expensive looked plain old back yard BBQ burger  <EOR> Met gf light meal right work Tuesday last night   sat high tables bar area during happy hour   Staff Waitress nice smiling polite  She along some witty banter lady spewing  She prompt checked often refiling free bevs each pass    Food OK maybe am Italian NY high expectations pizza however did Margarita flat bread happy hour menu figured worth try  Turns should held elsewhere  'flatbread' more crispy communion wafer then actual bread  ingredients top did any justice either  each harvest chicken salad not design hoping critique 2 dishes but exactly craving salad chicken pecans raisins apples etc   actually sizable portion ended taking some home  good but great  dressing lackluster but chicken really good  Felt maybe should found chicken dish its own tried that  Ambiance Actually good feel it  Plenty light space doesn't feel hole bar some places  Wasn't busy Tuesday early evening   But bar full time left around 730  Happy hours looks pretty decent deal some cheap food however cant comment quality only flatbread see above food   Tuesdays $2 50 beers just specialty bottled no cider $5 Overall feel just wasn't big food  But staff nice feel probably give another try something else menu <EOR> Much better expected chain brew pub  excellent service wasn't busy loud either  BBQ pork sandwich Marzen BBQ sauce delicious  love BBQ definitely there  only complaint came coleslaw menu didn't say did  Kinda annoying because scrape off  Overall very good checking CO location  <EOR> maybe giving bad review because ordered stir fry place clearly doesn't specialize stir fry however if your menu should standards everything else   The spicy chicken cashew stir fry was   1  spicy all 2  good chicken terriyaki made healthy choices buy frozen foods section grocery store   ok $5 healthy choices steamer but ok $15    I tried fries friends dish those ok   rumors expecting lot flavor didn't much   ate remainder because ok but mostly because stir fry small   As far burgers maybe they're good   I don't know   But won't returning because food mediocre best   cooked better stir fry home   The waiter great though! <EOR> I joined coworkers Happy Hour yesterday 3 30 6pm   Because work mile away probably 50th time HH but first post mostly because always much fun HH always good experience need review slips mind   But finally am reviewing place probably able pay electric bills tabs   Here's real deal   ONLY HAPPY HOUR!!  HH 3 6pm and 10pm close great food specials   Yesterday Baja Tacos $7 happy hour price best $7 spent years   4 fish tacos price delicious!  brews $1 off which isn't best deal town but HH food specials low beer discounts   can't wrong garlic fries southwest egg rolls ORDER THEM!!  space merging tables larger groups plenty TV's all sports watching   reviewer 50 times 5th star missing only because service mediocre most time sometimes because happy hour understaffed   But once beer food arrive definitely 4 star place! <EOR> Happy hour prices ridiculous  going years new menu change happy hour sucks  Never again <EOR> I stopped some friends dinner ended having sliders   great!  also something call Raspberry Ice Pick which pretty good plenty beer tap very nice atmosphere date just friends going out   Great Place! <EOR> The new menu happy hour offerings tp par  beer still good   The pizza worst don't mean metaphor slab ok pizza  crust ladle full maybe 6 tbsp sauce palty amount cheese 12 50! I actually better pizza cafeterias lot less I only hope that they see decrease revenue form new menu revert old happy hour menu  Till then drinks only if even that  <EOR> I would just say Ahi Tuna Steak good gets   never better   am little nervous ordering something rare even though steaks medium rare   afraid tuna might close raw   perfect   rare over cooked   Even vegetables served outstanding   wife's fish chips outstanding also   very light just right breading   prices bit high but if all meals good worth extra dollar two  <EOR> My husband brews own beer when realized restaurant just across street hotel try it   He said beers good food excellent service horrible   The waitress walked away table before finished ordering   Never returned refills check us   crowded   Only 20 customers   When asked manager he seemed care comments <EOR> I NEVER going location again  Upon arrival dinner dark parking lot car shocked see outline person standing outside door  second scared getting robbed but she ended giving some sob story asking money  embarrassing disgusting but thankfully all she doing but couldn't help but think if she allowed hang approach customers people less reputable actions mind? If more light security patrolling lot would help  really put horrible mark otherwise decent meal never return  If want safe place take your family date pick somewhere else  location safe!!! <EOR> I'm beer drinker but others party enjoyed flights the waitress even brought 2 extras each could sample seasonals well! ordered selection appetizers bar early mid afternoon share each more delicious last   Great service great food no issues all!

Mind boyfriend hungry perfect timing  Everything great until noticed manager suppose around every table sure everyone being taken cared of  sat far opening missing table impossible  She skipped table did acknowledge us  Maybe because look kids? am sure would hard fact she just did see because far opening  hope doesn't boil down picking choosing you'd check want just over speak with  Every little thing counts just thought wasn't nice her  Other food amazing   <EOR> Went Wednesday afternoon around happy hour although did any alcohol  always wanted try place pass all time travels  Located really nice Howard Hughes area near Paradise Flamingo    When comes burgers don't them fancy  able comment sauces specialty toppings but tell beer bread sure!

Roasted garlic mashed potatos Apple cider cole slaw sides  DELISH!!!  brother potato croquettes sides really really good!!  want side next time  LoL  early no wait  dined place busier busier maybe bit noisy side  Waiter attentive friendly  2 experiences GB definitely made fan place wish more often  Just sucks nearest where live nearly four hours away <EOR> I don't really Vegas   but GB brewery feels very homey me  many years ago just loved vibe beer selection  Solid pub food comfy vibe outside seating  cool evening great beer selection  Marzen favorite  come back next time LV   'cause doesn't feel LV  <EOR> This restaurant located Hughes Center office complex given its convenient location offices many business lunch location   food good they're good spot lunch unless convention going which case lot busier service tends slow down     Seating bar high tops around bar quick easy solution solo couple diners   several tvs going whatever big sport events time and or financial news if nothing else happening     My biggest problem Gordon Biersch something many people probably enjoy  they frequently change menu  at least once quarter if more   joke re read menu every time because changes often   reason don't some favorite dishes no longer menu   favorite meals Housemade Tacos     GB famous its garlic fries but those don't want garlic breath all day fries just good without garlic   Overall good place would recommend lunch dinner  <EOR> What huge huge disappointment   1 star excellent brewery beers  it   Everything else failure service portions menu can't decide if pub food burgers Tapas place should just stuck pub grub  First appetizers smallest undersized portions ever seen   Buffalo wings which tasty but 5   enough toast points crab dip mussels joke literally only 6 served 2 didn't even open plus under seasoned   bratwurst appetizer needed triple more bratwurst beer cheese infused dipping sauce instead marzen mustard   pretzel came very good garlic fries decent also   food overpriced undersized waiter ghost   Worst brewery pub ever too  <EOR> Eeeeh  What really say Gordon Biersch  Below expectations? Poor value?  First thing bartender say bro every couple seconds  Drove batty  Also no clue IBU tried steering away seasonal beer because comes smaller glass it 10%abv beer  course its served larger glass   looking cicerone level knowledge but come on    brewery restaurant    The beer I very underwhelmed  tried both standard IPA season IPA impressed  Ended ordering Pilsner hard mess pilsner   Also along side grabbed bloody mary  bloody nothing excited but wasn't expecting anything really it  However place brewery expected beers quite bit better  Nothing really write home very round bland  Also expected bartenders least SOME beer knowledge   Food The food actually really good! crab artichoke dip tenderloin sliders  Food temp great! Food quality great! would come back food over anything else   Value When visited Gordon Biersch came happy hour  two apps small plates beer bloody tab came $40  exactly happy hour pricing despite having ordered items supposed happy hour   Price point biggest let down all actually  $40 beer well vodka drink two apps dine some phenomenal restaurants Vegas  clearly them   The food its self good but price point much better  Because poor value would probably try place again  <EOR> A Friday Happy Hour Meetup group no less  place said NO separate checks many group left  Those stayed ended nice waitress  other waiter sat waiting customers during 2 hours he no customers   go figure! The appetizers during Happy Hour $8 99 3 small tacos 1 example  Great tasting but Happy Hour lowered prices  16 oz  Wit good tasting but again during Happy Hour 16 oz  could bit better price  I know now why other 2 locations permanently closed  Never again when many other brewery Happy Hour restaurants great town  <EOR> Fun place cold beer good casual food   closed trade show 9 00 pm great time   brew excellent selection beer   food good too  <EOR> Ok just say this  Don't fu^%ing offer Kobe beef hamburgers then willing cook them medium rare  then tell your waitress Nevada state law  tourist  fu*%ing LIVE here  any number restaurants Las Vegas medium rare hamburger  offering sushi grade tuna but only allowing breaded fried  Such waste  wasn't even order  friend's order  But more think angrier get  wouldn't normally even review chain restaurant because figure  going chain restaurant  But guess just wanted all know   Other food meh  good remembered  Crab artichoke dip good  Waitress nice attentive  just can't quite past kobe burger thing  can't  Oh apparently hostess thought proper form look bored walk away talking while seating us  Probably didn't help review seated someone feel you're inconveniencing them wanting sit down  Sorry bothering you?

PS event room    server constantly kept letting know haven't met minimum $$$ yet    really ?!!? <EOR> January 2011  Don't wrong love Gordon Biersch       happy hour pretty awesome but last  visit particular establishment sucked !  Pros * awesome happy hour menu w cheap eats * good selection brews including GB home brews * chill atmosphere outdoor patio area  Cons * bad service * slow service * would accommodate seating request * No reservations bar  even large groups!  Tips * if large group people sure bring cash * happy hour limited strictly bar area   Sit bar itself quicker service not surrounding tables bar area   * patio part bar area   sure take advantage it   * heat lamps available those colder Nevada nights  * Summerlin GBs way better service I'm just saying !

<EOR> Over hyped  all say place  food good but nothing great others ramble about  might wrong dishes but now feel little disappointed all  Expected way more flavor each dish  Some things bland  Next time give recommendations try ! <EOR> Just want qualify review before into it   1 don't really drink extensive fine beer wine other alcoholic beverages big draw me  2 coworker's birthday dinner large group   I arrived time Gordon Biersch only 1 couple time waiting rest group show  spoke hostesses very friendly   restaurant wasn't very crowded all Friday evening 7pm  already setup table large party    After debating order opted House Special Gorgonzola Bone In Ribeye Steak  18 oz steak topped Gorgonzola butter served garlic mashed potatoes vegetables $27 95   When served steak definitely huge cooked desired doneness medium rare  But flavor steak totally underwhelming question if even used least USDA Choice grade steak   Pretty disappointing considering grill mean steak home culinary school's kitchen    A friend ordered Vegetarian Pizza   looks good although hungry still managed finished all it   Definitely better sign    Anyway service okay   waitress kept coming back ask if ready order but since everyone arrived decided wait she come back several times   A+ patience dealing large party indecision when comes time order   But she lost some points neglecting mention additional 18% automatically added amount charged when credit card swiped   Even if amount charged already factored mandatory 18% tip   caught billing irregularity waitress would made way more 18%   D that    Also water served didn't taste good  am sure use some sort water filtration system but Las Vegas water still won served tasted more common tap water Lake Mead  lemon wedge would helped masked taste but none offered    Overall would only give Gordon Biersch 2 star rating   Food just good  am sure beer least decent $5 per glass seems good price   But food really major let down  chicken wings way sweet  Bone In Ribeye which most expensive menu item but Denny's taste     I definitely would recommend anyone come food alone   If need place hang some beer relax watch ESPN guess could come but way more better options around town  <EOR> We decided try place happy hour loved it!
