Delmonico located small restaurant row Venetian right another great burger spot although most people would come burger  interior nothing fancy bar area more traditional area back  did notice while sitting bar amazing bourbon selection but since during lunch break back some time when clock  lunch dinner menus bit different lunch menu featuring more sandwiches things maybe comment just made people coming burger wrong  way restaurant pretty fancy features quite number great sounding items aside came for   The Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes toasted brioche roll fries cheddar cheese bacon  meat excellent flavor first bite but noticed right away way overcooked dry  started off extremely juicy but faded way fast end very dry  cheese melted great flavor but bun tiny bit dry well little thick  heirloom tomatoes fantastic but maybe bit off putting first due green color  bacon also good flavor but tiny bit undercooked soggy parts  Overall still decent but could well beyond if meat cooked properly   Luckily fries great  Some them almost bit hard crunchy but very tasty welcome change 'typical' fries often around town  Something found quite funny when asked ketchup brought insanely large bowl more probably table full people could used   The online menu lists burger $15 little surprised see $18 listed menu when made order  think if cooked properly would still ok price given chef location etc but because price seriously frown fact couldn't cook burger properly  If you're willing risk inconsistency ok cost think good burger check potential really great but if you're Venetian craving guaranteed good burger similar cost suggest next door  <EOR> Started off Chimay Blue beer Gumbo progressed perfectly cooked ribeye steak garlic sautéed mushrooms  Very delicious   Especially Oscar style asparagus must   Highly recommend it  <EOR> I blame father inordinate love all things gourmet  Thankfully appreciate good burrito much appreciate good steak but definitely seize every opportunity dine style much can   Thanks family trip Vegas eat Emeril's once more partaking family's favorite pasttime eating  eaten original location New Orleans when lived top 5 dining experiences all time  definitely tied experience   As other people said if you're going eat steak some form when come you're wasting your time  steak truly peak experience meat lovers  all ate  steaks silence save OMG!

He must cared little customer would think decide serve this  LET TELL YOU  NO DIFFERENT SPITTING FACE   Paid 95 dollars bill  am feeling complete loser right now  Good thing least came alone  If brought GF she would think want break up  Michael next time happens just take 20 dollars off bill  guys never top notch restaurant  <EOR> Ordered bone ribeye medium rare   first steak came medium   nervous ask waiter redo but he gracious even acknowledged medium steak   replaced gorgeous medium rare steak less 5 mins   Great service good food excellent atmosphere  <EOR> Came Anniversary very enjoyable experience  Left food coma  <EOR> As restaurant under Emeril Lagasse's name expecting consistent quality meal   Instead left very disapointed restaurant   only highlight signature BBQ shrimp appetizer   butternut squash raviolis duck confit unexplainably dry   shredded duck top should slightly dry crispy but inside raviolis shouldn't be   don't know if could even say butternut squash pasty   dry bordering gritty      The truffle parmesan potato chips cut ultra thin tasty but dripping much oil   Instead tasting light airy felt weighed down goopy oil drops clung each chip     Then there's steak   ordered bone ribeye standard ribeye   Both cuts juicy marbled nicely cooked right levels except thing steak no taste   creates taste seasoning aging?  Well whatever only surface deep   outer portion steak seasoned but meat middle really no taste   Even butter scoop topped steak couldn't noticeable difference       Don't wrong meat quality good but if pay $50 steak expect flavor   felt eating $25 steak    almost wanted ask them bernaise sauce through it   Even though wait staff extremely helpful attentive couldn't save disappointing meal      In Vegas only other steakhouse N9ne Palms would recommend over Delmonico's heartbeat    don't think going back  <EOR> This great steakhouse Las Vegas    We started off caesar salad made table side  rib eye husband filet mignon  Both ordered medium both came perfectly medium mouthwateringly good! sides ok desserts fantastic!

 lot staff courteous knowledgable menu wine list     Let preface review food saying don't eat red meat   know steak speciality knowing order don't best   started shrimp cocktail which included 4 large shrimp cocktail sauce some garnish   shrimp cooked very well but regular shrimp cocktail   cajun marinade imparted little extra kick but nothing remarkable   Next snapper entree   Almost everyone else table ordered rib eye which enormous   Man vs  Food big   piece snapper looked tiny bowl next big steaks!  all honesty though regular portion   lentils great addition brussel sprouts   However fish seemed sitting while   top dry under heat lamps   understand tough coordinate peice fish when prepare 15+ rib eyes same set tables but snapper still cost $40   didn't dessert since brought cake but coffee end good   saying wouldn't return Delmonico but knowing many other steakhouses Vegas stronger reputation seafood if choice I'd probably choose elsewhere  <EOR> We celebrated sister's 40th Birthday she really enjoyed entire dining experience Delmonico's  She enjoyed food along friends well  also gave complementary slice cake    second time coming servers waiters awesome once again  ordered Bone in Ribeye time believe its 20oz wife ordered Seared Sea Scallops Herb Gnocchi  would say Bone Ribeye now FAVORITE steak now  ordered medium rare  juicy tender flavors galore all your mouth lol!

No all  just think being Vegas where surrounded plethora dining options same caliber need live your name  Sadly wasn't impressed dish compared other fellow Yelpers    My side choice CREAMED SPINACH  Now we're talking! tasted sensational silky feel butter cream  Finally Chef Emeril's true colors coming out  sweet note ended evening EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE  say WOW!? say best banana cream pie date  Hats off Chef! friends earned Delmonico Steakhouse 4 stars giving them    Would come back?

Very nice touch first impression  greeted main server followed assistants  server made good conversation awesome recommendations  never felt bugged rushed belittled since all look pretty young   Even huge wine list scratching heads server recommended VERY good syrah fitted within budget   Between 4 ordered bbq shrimp filet mignons lobster tail ordered rib eye  Seriously every bite WOW! Cooked exactly way ask!!! try yourself you'll understand WOW factor restaurant has!  While making reservations noted special dinner wife along friend wife anniversaries dating   lol   anyways when ask check staff came two bowls fresh strawberry sherbert sorbet candle followed words Happy Anniversary both Thank coming Delmonicos ! wanted stand applaud! hahahah server then take digital camera's take couple pics us   If you're looking restaurant WOW factor and love meat highly recommend visiting Delmonico's  <EOR> went bachelor party dinner oct 08   so amazing! service could any better  sides amazing but if rib eye  you wont need them  manager came party sure everything liked  very impressive  <EOR> What experience! I made reservations friend I  dinner around 6 30pm Sunday  seated right away    Three servers helping very attentive throughout night    Our meal started off complimentary bread  kind reminded yorkshire pudding  really light airy  liked because didn't full    Both ordered bone in rib eye cooked medium rare  cooked nicely nice flavors  didn't realize while eating but steak really salty  couldn't stop drinking water all night  also ordered wild mushroom side dish  definitely use less salt  end meal server gave birthday dessert blueberry sorbet  Because full ordered banana cream pie togo  boxed nicely able enjoy dessert later night  delicious but if don't bananas don't it    It overall pleasant dining experience  would definitely come back try other dishes  <EOR> We Delmonico's Palazzo Venetian pre theater dinner   While nothing bad wasn't four five star experience either   service competent restaurant decor definitely upscale     This Emeril restaurant some cajun creole items menu along steak seafood   started Ahi Salmon Tartare   nice starter served small cucumber salad but nothing extraordinary   lobster bisque arrived sitting pass awhile seemed already skin atop soup   nice bisque you'd expect steakhouse   petite iceberg wedge salad again pretty standard bacon blue cheese   finished Halibut served over call vegetable risotto   good maybe bit overcooked but enjoyed it     The rest table ordered appetizers steaks while said steaks good   no fireworks speak of   did try bit GF's ribeye actually bit surprised lacking flavor opinion   ribeye usually very flavorful but almost tasted filet tender but without any real steak pop just hint gaminess     Overall especially price thought food would bit more inspired but ended just OK   place I'd steer anyone away since menu diverse wine list very respectable but if you're looking something really special don't think really hits mark   certainly better steak seafood restaurants Vegas less bit more price point would much better     Interestingly enough despite restaurant's name   they no Delmonico steak menu   thought bit odd well  <EOR> Of all steakhouse experiences best  enjoyed many steaks Delmonico Steak house  Tonight perfect   I enjoyed New York strip served Piedmontese  steak cooked impeccably  Executive Sous Chef Ivan Rojas prepared meal wife truly appreciated   We customers 5 years now   I raised restaurant industry truly appreciate effort involved create meal  <EOR> I able sample many menu items first only visit Delmonico's date    things loved Parmesan chip appetizer caesar salad soft shell crab BBQ shrimp app   Caesar salad probably best ever had   chips thin cut perfectly crispy   BBQ shrimps cooked just right bbq sauce mild great shrimp   crab excellent perfectly cooked great flavor  also tried NY strip cooked correctly nice crust   best steak ever but tell done care quality   appetizers very good because each something made special   I would see steaks well   would say service most disappointed in   bad but just wasn't expect place caliber and price   <EOR> I dinner 2 7   last time over 10 years ago   last Vegas steakhouse eaten CUT comparing experience to  Service Very Good   least 3 4 servers taking care party 5 throughout night   Initially dinner party 4   However once seated buddy landed airport decided join us   informed head server thinking may able accommodate he immediately converted table seat 5 pulled stuff bottom round table    Water constantly filled table cleared off appropriate fashion  Food started off Caesar Salad Ahi Tuna Salmon tartare   thought salad just ok   tad much dressing   Same tartare   Nothing special pretty bland   Most group bone rib eye medium rare medium well    All cooked well   thought medium rare tasty pretty good   Nothing spectacular just good steak   rack lamb medium rare decent flavors   would take Carvino's lamb chops over any day   sides decent Potato gratin mushrooms corn    nice bottle wine Sommelier recommended price point $85   probably best tasting thing night  The verdict Delmonico's decent steakhouse reputation based its name more its food   would choose CUT over any day   more selection meat cuts quality   <EOR> This list while first choices Spring Restaurant Week year  came lunch during week fellow Yelpers took advantage $30 14 prie fixe menu Three Square $4 donation   also utilized Open Table reservation   The three started Vine Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad appetizer  fresh heirloom tomatoes 2 3 different types colors served dollop creamy Burrata cheese red onion extra virgin olive oil balsamic vinegar fresh local basil  Really crisp refreshing great start meal   For entrée selected Delmonico's Prime Hamburger served toasted brioche roll cheddar cheese crispy bacon usual fixings lettuce tomato onion   perfectly medium rare juices oozing every squeeze  burger great flavor seasoning made stand other burgers had  also extremely generous portion  could barely finish half and eat LOT   only complaint although burger started juicy delicious dried really quickly made almost difficult eat  sure attributed but odd  fries delicious! unique preparation crispiness   I also opportunity taste Butternut Squash Ravioli prepared sage brown butter toasted hazelnuts parmesan cheese Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon served sweet corn crab vinaigrette fresh basil  Both really delicious! salmon soft succulent rareness center filet  also really impressed large chunks crab meat whole kernels corn   For dessert opted White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Bread Pudding Vanilla Bean Crème Anglaise  glad someone else chose Emeril's Banana Cream Pie because tough decision both being favorite desserts   bread pudding moist warm very yummy  pecan caramel like sauce bit sweet but fortunately pudding not  banana cream pie topped caramel sauce chocolate shavings whipped cream  Yum  good but order future really good taste it   The restaurant nice dimly lit rooms spotlights each table  wasn't very busy during meal but sure would still nice quiet  service also phenomenal  extremely pleased offering Harney Sons tea transported most gorgeous wooden box display fact complimentary  Everyone prompt refill pot hot water course served fresh lemon honey  also stayed past lunch service kind allow loiter long  <EOR> Worth cost  The food amazing   ordered steaks shared lots pasta other appetizers   meal want before dying   We ended worse table location bc pretty late but still in   Also spot cold bc draft quickly fixed problem   Fun dinner friends   Staff exceptional  <EOR> Finally many visits Las Vegas made Delmonico Steakhouse Venetian loved dinner! Ordered both foie gras truffle Parmesan potato chips start  both brought table same time knew would need eat foie gras first which quite good  potato chips great since ordered wagyu ribeye $90 didn't want fill chips asked if could box chips take back room   No problem delicious next day! wagyu ribeye best beef ever had! Perfect med rare great flavor most tender beef ever! wagyu other steakhouses LV but blew away competition!  size perfect 6 8 ounces I forgot which   Since white truffle season chose white truffle ice cream vanilla ice cream stuffed lots small pieces truffle  served 3 balls which figured I'd eat two but addictive ate whole thing! Service very friendly attentive  Delmonico Steakhouse now favorite steakhouse! <EOR> I am pretty critical when comes steak   sinking teeth into first pricey steak years ago   instantly understood why people pay top dollar delicious cow   Great option if Venetian Palazzo   See didn't plan leaving hotel arrived   Had special night   ribeye chanterelle mushrooms foie gras   don't even aged steak   but amazing!

But please  won't regret it  <EOR> It's sad made place memorable mediocre    travel buddy into heated discussion while trying decide fault ended there  finally remembered happened Palazzo she wanted steak  wanted stop Cut but she wasn't big fan Wolfgang Puck  She likes Mario Batali glanced over Enoteca's menu but course didn't steak  If we'd known existence Carnevino probably would've ended there  don't know if steak would've better      but anyway Delmonico    By time ended front Delmonico's Steakhouse really famished  Emeril's steakhouse couldn't possibly awful               We ordered * BOTTLE RED * JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE [4 5 Good crab cakes best but definitely took first place over everything else had ] * GRILLED FILET MIGNON MEDALLIONS [3 5 alright  Average flavor tender ] * FILET MIGNON [2 5 She's huge steak fan but first overcooked steak then sent second steak which still much better little chewy ] <EOR> very disappointed  steak burnt wasn't great  <EOR> Not fond atmosphere but food service great   say bone rib eye years ago reigned many years champion very best steak ever entire life until last year when title taken Emeril Legasi Tom Colicchio restaurant Craft Steakhouse   Delmonico all time favorite steak joints  <EOR> Best meal EVER! also most expensive   but worth it    The food just unbelieveable  special gnocchi lump crab appetizer wedge salad filet ribeye roasted potatoes w garlic pecan pie dessert  Food coma! Everything absolutely perfect service excellent  Highly recommended special occasion  <EOR> World class service   Tasteful decor   2400 selection wine list   very best bananna cream pie ever made   While Bordeaux decanted artisinal cheese plate perfect appetizer grilled shrimp black truffle special     Lobster bisque grand   gumbo 100% authentic   crab stuffed lobster tail heavenly   bone in ribeye simply perfect   loved creamed corn gratin   And then time dessert   This dinner 4th time Emeril Lagasse property since first visit flagship restaurant New Orleans almost 20 years ago   all time telling Emeril's bananna cream pie while made cookbooks   But now she's real thing agrees really best she's ever tasted  comment kids said all least Dad tried  very special wine $800 two   return  <EOR> Wasn't able secure last minute reservation Craftsteak which love way while Vegas reluctantly w Delmonico   Service good expected but warm I'd like  you know feeling when joke around your server rapport never really clicked w service   Whatever case shouldn't matter because RIB EYE!!!  Disappointing    hardly marbled    flavorful yes but tough enough where couldn't enjoy every bite   pallet favors texture over flavor although wife felt steaks flavorful opinion toughness completely buries any goodness flavor   What really lowers score Delmonico sheer fact surrounded many other steak houses mean Vegas all!! Because don't see myself EVER coming back <EOR> Having eaten now handful times felt time finally leave review not need based stars  having said really hard wrong steak here! NY strip huge delicious experience cooked perfection  sides while pretty standard fare quite good  find creamed spinach mushrooms particularly noteworthy while asparagus uninspired  value reasonable spite fairly high price no complaints there  number great options Venetian Palazzo let alone Las Vegas its entirety hard stand but Delmonico Steakhouse manages so  <EOR> Steak Cesar salad absolutely delicious! steak two served sliced table side Cesar salad made table side  surprised end anniversary sorbet  <EOR> We very disappointed meal  waiter absolutely no knowledge wine selection therefore could provide any recommendations  steaks flavorless cocked requested  side broccoli lukewarm wine glasses dirty  best part meal caramel butter cake dessert Fisticuffs cabernet   steakhouses quite often Delmonico's ranks towards very bottom list  <EOR> Came celebration only reason chose place because am HUGE fan banana cream pie all reviews raving it  figured why not?!   Right away realize place trying something special  say trying because doesn't quite right  2 servers pay attention every little detail which great  mean only thinking needed another iced tea before could signal server ready me  Great!!!  However feeling everyone trying little hard could tell only because everyone nervous stumbling over words presentation food    Food wise food GREAT! steak literally falling apart didn't even use any force all cut filet  thick beef jerky if imagine that!!!
