Don't fooled though sides also favorites  fact mashed potatoes far best ever tasted! Mac cheese always fresh super creamy  veggies fruits always super fresh   I've coming place years now always same faces  employees ALL working because they're all quick efficient friendly hard tell manager because see much passion work hey do  Let's forget owners  always present always going above beyond sure only customers best service but employees also also happy support    My top 10 places food service all time! <EOR> It pains write review because love food but service sucks  last couple times wings  those times later evening maybe around 6 so  could understand them being since late day  But most recent visit 1 30 out  don't know if only x per day but becoming trend don't like!   Besides having favorite item available customer service pretty bad  last visit decent rush 10 people line only cashier  only but she would stop middle taking orders answer phone take order  Totally unprofessional rude! every time busy too  weird thing mention no trash cans people can't throw away garbage dishes trash left tables ridiculously long time  Also need pay more attention detail  ordered bunch food told them dining yet food packaged go  Also when specified tortillas food dinner rolls  all minor things but add big annoyance!  In summary your shit together NCC! am going boycott place because love food but probably only order to go now on  <EOR> The ribs chicken never cease amaze could eat every single day life if could  flavor ribs delicious chicken always juicy  always mashed potatoes gravy side because hooked them  place great food!!! <EOR> Chicken little dry but good nonetheless saffron rice good but ribs awful dry sauceless funky blend seasoning just didn't jive me   I'd eat again but both chicken ribs CJ's Texas BBQ street better probably cheaper I'd rather there  <EOR> It's ok   would describe place  stood front register good 5 mins before guy behind register acknowledge presence  understand he counting drawer but good customer service dictates least greet your customers thank them patience   This second time eaten here  chicken tastes good but dry  sides pretty good  Overall place ton potential however need work staff's morale well downsizing menu few quality selections versus big menu average selections  <EOR> For chicken café really don't chicken well   orders several times work whenever chicken rather bland   vegetables OK but called Nevada Vegetable Café   What sweet potatoes   just didn't taste right   I yet impressed place office 3 4 times now   Kind wish would put another restaurant rotation   The only reason give two stars spinach feta cheese pasta really good!

Fiance chicken  good no complaints  tried tomato mozerella chicken sandwich  cheese bread fixings great but chicken kinda *eh*  No clue if chicken use sandwiches reject meat what!   The sides where place really sucked  quite psyched generous size them but then disappointed when ended throwing mostly away  Fiance corn mac cheese  Corn ok mac cheese gross  really watery   basically mac sitting watery yellow sauce  stupid enough try spinach feta pasta  assumed green pasta meant pasta itself spinach pasta  HA  white pasta covered disgusting spinach sauce  basically tasted cold boiled spinach  EW    I'd try them again but I'd avoid mac cheese pasta next time! <EOR> Chicken best here!
