As name suggests KoMex Korean Mexican fusion restaurant little Chinese American thrown good measure  truly hidden gem although only few blocks house located nondescript strip mall behind gas station didn't even know until looked nearby restaurants Yelp  Now go to places takeout which heartily recommend because its small size might wait bit dine indoors    I agree other reviewers bulgogi fries fantastic but there's menu combination can't beat beef chow fettuccine pork kimchi fried rice  usually full order fettuccine half order rice portions big serve two hearty meals two hearty eaters   The beef chow fettuccine combines signature bulgogi beef red cabbage onions peppers carrots all served over thick noodles  Sounds weird but best thing menu IMHO   fried rice pork  although think any meat would fine  but add kimchi and its traditional fried egg partner give little extra spice  huge kimchi fan but works perfectly combination especially good when mix fried rice fettuccine together  DELISH!  This time also each ordered chicken lettuce wrap appetizer  Once again any meat combo would dish  tried bulgogi pork belly before but today chicken won out  Chopped chicken topped cabbage cilantro all wrapped iceberg lettuce leaf  also tacos corn flour tortillas but lettuce refreshing change otherwise carb heavy meal   Takeout service quick efficient counter help always friendly appreciative when arrive  can't bet price especially huge portions $23 two great meals two  Thanks food gods putting KoMex close home! <EOR> Bulgogi nachos BBQ pulled pork sliders wontons   Everything delicious can't wait back try everything else   Great service great people delicious food! <EOR> Really impressed place meat hardly tastes marinated service sucked   Server never offered water Its getting point going grab own box!!! <EOR> Yup worth every star!

Food 2 5 Ambiance 0 5   4 5 stars review fellow yelpers but food just wasn't par   Something's adding here    *note cook every dish needs black pepper less more sometimes! sure if tried your food lately but most your dishes missing something !! Korean Mex fusion here's clue add some creamy sauce your Mexican inspired dishes*  Now    Background    I'm California maybe fusion  just can't it  Most dishes seemed missing just little something    impressed  came Utah hiking all day  group 7 hungry ready chow down   I'll start best down list  ordered   Kim chi fried rice 5 5 I'm sucker kim chi fried rice some people some don't  love good kim chi fried rice  dish packs moist flavorful punch every bite  must order!  Bulgogi cheese steak 4 5 Docked star because need put sauce each bite taste fusion  bulgogi very seasoned  general good sandwich cheesesteak lovers   Bulgogi chimichanga 3 5 Hey meat? Totally just few scraps chimichanga  ? also needed much sauce each bite    why black pepper poured all over top? never black pepper chimichangas bulgogi!! Why did put ? totally threw off taste!!  Kimchi side dish 2 5 Hmmm flavor good but $3 kimchi   served warm mushy   Wttthhhhheck?? should cold only served cold    Spicy pork fusion nachos 2 5 Oh Koja kitchen you've ruined eveyone else  no white sauce nachos dish missing certain something    least no black pepper one  Also just few crumbs meat accompanied dish   Wonton 1 5 Don't order it  Wonton skins soft soggy meat filling dimensional dry lacking flavor  Again heavy handed chef black pepper overload soup but forgot season meat wonton   Bulgogi plate 1 5 Dry super plain bland presentation  Doesn't look Korean Mexican Chinese American     Don't order !!!  Burrito 1 5  didn't try but looked dry standard   Very plain    asked friend ate word  Meh Nothing special try folks!  I dropped fork waitress heard probably due empty restaurant cling fork falling broke sound crickets background she quickly came over replaced right away  Although rated 5 5 service suppose she earned 20% gratuity never informed of     Overall won't back  wondering experience food wise differ much other yelpers  Apparently another yelper pointed change ownership  would explain it   The restaurant empty during dinnertime new ownership should probably reading reviews stepping your game     Btw most people meat   little customers your trickling now days should probably give people more meat them happier your sub par food unoriginal menu dull flavors  Note hungry yelpers ballers budget   If hungry need cheap bite off strip don't need come here! Check all Asian restaurants off spring mountain  2 5 min drive strip find anything want there  <EOR> This interesting  Any way pack bulgogi into mexican container good me  Cheap fast heaping portions along fusion aspect worthwhile  little one trick pony ish long run but good stuff  Small locale fast friendly service  <EOR> This place off charts!

Oh bulgogi rice which delish but say did miss all side items usually accompany traditional Korean restaurant meals  <EOR> A dive good!   Seating very limited may wait table before eat  some chairs sit wait table   They 1 large table group which also screened off privacy  other side most seating half chairs booth style  cushions booth could use over foam padding kinda worn out  when tried place package cushions wouldn't stay put started slide off cushion   only reason suggest re doing padding  cushion fabric great shape!  Food wise Can't really complain! Very tasty! tot ordered Bulgogi fried rice very mild but good  taste buds would preferred little more moisture i e  sauce something but hubby child happy presented  Hubby ordered Torta spicy pork taco  two spicy pork tacos  tacos surprisingly small but LOADED brim overflowing goody morsels  surprisingly very filling understand small size  Hubby extremely happy spicy pork well he overloading torta  only part he wasn't fond torta pickled jalapenos  He kinda under impression jalapenos diced raw ones pickled ones he slightly disappointed that  But he picked them no probs   We'll back another day! try lettuce wrap tacos many others! D <EOR> Definitely try spicy pork tacos!  Better beef IMO   Pork belly tacos also winning choice! <EOR> Love food here!  Bulgogi fried rice bomb!  Here's tip if you're ordering take sure order phone   takes while if you're ordering waiting restaurant   but suppose its well worth wait! <EOR> Writing review Komex Express unlike most any review ever written  Generally post critique establishment Yelp only two visits but Komex different kind place deserved different approach      Komex opened quite while before ventured first time  location Komex occupies where favorite Mexican restaurants El Burrito Caf once stood  spot only few hundred yards house Komex signs merely reminders food spot literally grown Vegas  Could fusion restaurant compare family run Mexican joint fond of? No way!! Well maybe wrong time  Komex beyond incredible!! stumbling across bunch positive reviews Yelp decided check place no turning back!!    If haven't tried Korean Mexican fusion don't know you're missing  melding spices peppers used each type food mastered Yi family  Most items menu Komex tacos burritos etc  available carne pollo carnitas each equally delicious  tacos burritos all insanely delicious but tortas far favorite  made ample amount meat I prefer carne lettuce tomato avocado jalapeno fresh soft roll  bulgogi also can't miss option if want delve further into Korea side menu  bulgogi both burrito try little Kimchi its own  Both awesome! Yesterday decided try fusion cheese enchiladas which sure would least slight step down other fare Komex but guess what DELICIOUS!! BTW did mention prices??!! food Komex would bargain twice price eyes  Taste quality vs  cost puts Komex top any list restaurants Vegas sure  sure try unsweetened jasmine tea too     would also remiss if didn't mention great service is  staff always very friendly service prompt  Linda smiling face greets every customer walks she sees each patron well taken care of  continually tell all friends if aren't making short trip Komex you're missing real treat  Komex definitely short list regular stops great food!! <EOR> Honestly hype real  place great  start off chips salsa which books always plus  father both ordered bulgogi cheesesteaks tater tots heavenly  Lots cheese onions top bell peppers but definitely cheap meat  loaded bulgogi  Very good cannot wait come back try some other menu items! <EOR> I've heard much Korean Mexican fusion when saw restaurant Yelp try out  food ordered plan spending some time especially if busy  worth wait  ordered tostada bulgogi meat  meat tender marinade delicious  reminded mother's tapa Filipino except sliced thinner  served top rice patty patty some crispy rice outside  Topped cabbage salsa meal tasted fresh  can't wait back try other specialties! <EOR> YUMMY!!!! place awesome  reading reviews place longest time finally experience food all disappointed  tacos fusion tacos amazing great flavor  3 tacos really filled up  Great food customer service great well  gentleman behind counter very helpful  only complaint place close way early     Vegas  8 pm during week early  reasons took long eat here  Every time ready dinner wanted try place closed  don't usually eat dinner until 8 pm   But definable coming occasional lunch  <EOR> This review totally biased  love both Korean Mexican food but two together TERRIBLE  best dish solely just bulgogi steamed veggies  won't return  Service fine slow cook food  Don't come if your hurry  <EOR> Lives hype but don't know 5 stars   Great hole wall prices! <EOR> Why am reviewing establishment already well over 500 reviews?   Simply said because KoMex best hole wall establishments Vegas offer   The kitchen very small service slow  Call ahead if pressed time budget between 20 30 minutes just safe    However amazing food well transgression slower service   yet dish disappoints    The thing love most KoMex locally owned abandoned neighborhood even become little gritty side   work very close special spot heart part town     I guess could best describe restaurant El Seoul food  <EOR> I knew but hadn't tried new Decatur location   knew all well when owner came said Welcome back  we haven't seen almost 6 months  Bulgogi burrito son beef burrito   excellent usual   more say other back try more fusion items     <EOR> Wow!  A restaurant trifecta! Good service good food original idea   First service  waitress extremely nice very efficient  always appreciate friendly service good recommendations   Second enormous quantity tasty food  could ordered half much completely sated   Finally fusion trend new but when done right know it  spicy pork torta jalapenos lettuce tomato kimchi beef burrito kimchi side full flavor  <EOR> Overall great food   Very friendly staff   Fusion Bulgogi Nachos awesome really enjoyed Mexican soft drink bottle   only thing thought unnecessary fact wait seated waited waiter   Other can't wait till open next location Buffalo Flamingo Sept  <EOR> Definitely four half stars!! We ordered bulgogi burrito  only okay best    enough meat much rice  Bf felt meat over cooked well   We also ordered Korean wings  liked them bf did much  again he felt over cooked   fries which came frozen fries cooked no salt  very little recommend  Don't think we'll returning  <EOR> The Original KoMex Fusion! When think any kind fusion always creates plenty room thought taste  Mexican Korean top favorites foods eat when mix them together? betcha all it  both locations I'd say Flamingo Buffalo location favorite   My most recent experience past weekend while side town nephews track meet  all know track meets all day family decided would take break grab some quick lunch  Since really side town pause little bit think around eat ? Pulled Yelp saw KoMex 0 2 miles away sold! set kind weird location matter when want place take order  amount distance between person sitting table behind while ordering uncomfortable  Lunch order consisted of Spam Masubi 2 Bulgogi Sliders Bulgogi Quesadilla Chicken Fried Rice KimChi Fried Rice  Everything fantastic glad shown family another great place when your taste buds want two different types foods once! back very soon  <EOR> Love food feel place  well hiden  jewel tried 90percent menu all rocks! wait lunch but well worth flavors just dance your mouth great! <EOR> Cheap!

Eating tacos bulgogi elsewhere guess  just didn't occur could've both if only visited KoMex but better late never right?  numerous close photos Fusion Bulgogi Nachos alone enough persuasion visit  Unfortunately first visit also last   I ordered fish taco Fusion Bulgogi Taco friend ordered Fusion Bulgogi Enchilada  also requested half order bowl Fusion Bulgogi Nachos share  waitress kind enough warn full order might much half instead  She's right  chips enough share four people  Then again all depends everyone's hunger levels   Our waitress started off complimentary basket hot homemade tortilla chips side guacamole salsa  Very delicious greasy  They're thick resemble pita chips  fantastic start meal  far good   We both expecting nachos arrive first tide over waited arrival entrees  both fasted visit really hungry!  but didn't happen  Instead friend's enchiladas arrived first followed short awkward period waiting tacos order nachos come  entrees arrived warm instead hot made wonder if food sitting while before being delivered table    My fish tacos weren't bad but they're certainly best had  Here's fish tacos fish isn't tiny lightly fried  isn't slathered thick specialty sauces   The bulgogi tacos tasty enjoyed sweet flavor bulgogi meat  would've preferred flour tortilla over corn taco    Fusion Bulgogi Nachos mountain tortilla chips topped mozzarella cheese bulgogi jalapeos spicy sauce  Although delicious when arrived cheese cooled down began harden    The meal going well until noticed friend doing something unusual  first thought she playing string melted cheese hanging chips but she actually trying move something  She pointed small black bug crawling table near chips  both thought gnat but didn't fly away  couldn't spider because  antennae didn't crawl eight legs  Rather guessing where came stopped middle meals paid bill left nauseating feelings bellies   The cheap decent eats would've brought back another try but don't think stomach idea returning  <EOR> I came place watching video Buzzfeed hangover food Vegas  wasn't hungover when but food delicious nonetheless  chimichanga bulgogi kimchi stuffed inside  that thing kept full entire day  Super tasty  no idea place existed until year but glad went  definitely try fried rice next time  Cheers! <EOR> Whoa! new favorite hole wall  currently middle tiny carneceria but moving end year  sounded might planning becoming actual restaurant rather grocery counter food  Mexican Chinese Korean food  Huh!

Korean BBQ Mexican? Freakin GENIUS!!! Komex please your way San Diego!  Everything good  definitely new favorite places eat Vegas  <EOR> Pros tried almost every dish bulgogi burrito favorite studied board exams here   If decide last meal would KoMex Fusion because every dish perfect flavor profile   love Nachos too   also own parking spots    Cons none  small kitchen shorter staff but only 10 tables service perfect   However might need wait line if there's rush     This hole wall restaurant easily missed   would give restaurant 6 stars if could! I also lot take out orders place  <EOR> Great food great service low prices  else ask for  best places Vegas  Everything ordered tasted great even kids loved it  <EOR> Yelp hot spot sure actually lived expectations  atmosphere definitely best considering location run down shopping center  Oh well all food right? Although plus side did change tables chairs since first visit which last year  first time tried fusion burrito chicken pretty delicious must say wayy cheap $5ish  little spicy side but most chicken dishes Mexican typically spicy begin with  Most people heat but definitely drank all water before finishing burrito  second time came huge group 20+ during lunch Sunday  Fortunately area reserved don't know but obviously seat since no where else  service really good considering big group accommodated all having separate checks  bolgogi fries which high hopes good but missing fresh factor  don't think would order again stick basics next time come  <EOR> Tried first time friend visiting SF  There's bunch cheap places sf but he said he would love place again def hasn't tried anything it   I tried fusion chimichanga bulgolgi shared bulgolgi bachos  nachos point definitely worth price  chimichanga okay but think should just gotten burrito  kind oily think outside wasn't feeling    The service great  when opened definitely attentive  checked enough but much constantly interrupted conversation  would definitely recommend place some good cheap food! <EOR> This favorite place city last few years  different food options quality amazing  smaller venue sweet time between lunch dinner usually  <EOR> First time here  Nice service  Tasty delicious goodies  Chips salsa guacamole free  Very yum  bulgogi beef plate added Kim Che rice  Super good  Nice flavor sweetness beef flavorful taste kimchee fried rice delicious  girl fusion flautas   Bulgogi mozzarella inside fried tortilla amazing Korean hot sauced guacamole   Really flipping good  Good eats back  <EOR> Ok first dive  menu small simple  your fusion your Korean your mexican  try Fish lettuce wrap taco Calamari lettuce wrap taco both tasted really good  Also ordered Spam Kimchi  fried rice  1st but something crazy it  Still good finish whole plate  Service 5 star all time top you    2 interesting things place guess very well known Metro  felt court house break room something  Now when saw Health Dept  inspector eating there!  super plus business  We'll done we'll coming back  <EOR> What difference year make  honestly created Yelp account rave place  used amazing  However second location opened pretty recently extremely disappointing last time it   Being frequent customer past year did hesitate buy $40 worth food family  always tell friends place  Unfortunately something happened recently maybe new chef quality decreased significantly  Here's meal had Fusion Burrito Soggy  Extremely soggy  tasted somebody drenched greens inside water removed any semblance rice meat  could barely eat half it  used favorite mine!  Fusion Quesadilla spicy pork Also disgusting! don't know mess spicy pork cheese  little niece she barely two bites  thought something wrong tried too  Straight trash    quesadilla weird aftertaste?  Shrimp Taco shrimp definitely old  aged seafood smell spread strongly throughout house   We few more things adequate guess  aforementioned items worst   I'm disappointed  tempted leave star but put two respect restaurant once was  Maybe caught them bad day but received inexcusable  <EOR> I family trying find place bulgogi rivaled living Korea! good far closet since being states  only cons know way spicy other putting Texas Pete hot sauce table  also didn't Korean wings tasted soap hot grease ever sauce put them couldn't found taste buds!! did enjoy different ways used bulgogi burritos  I'd return only basic bulgogi rice!! <EOR> He craving tacos craving rice  Enter KoMex  surrounding area bit sketchy but anywhere some good food  Based reviews expecting truly outstanding meal    Bulgogi w white rice  far say quality meat top notch  piece fat sight  However meat didn't much flavor  Eating white rice didn't help cause either  sprinkle sesame seeds top  gives little color some lively texture but  it  oily all which plus   Their tacos come loaded your selected main ingredient pico de gallo  You'd think two measly little tacos wouldn't fill but surprisingly gets pretty satisfied    KoMex does trick when you're craving some Korean Mexican fusion food Vegas  However might think twice next time hold off cravings until LA  <EOR> Mmm think could eat everyday!  far tried torta sliders kimchi fried rice  All yummy!  Found bone sliver bulgogi once but won't ruin me   Go early prepare wait! Staff more busy friendly but once sit down order your food comes pretty quick did mention yummy? I'd give place more star if place could accommodate all people eat enough help didn't seem uptight all time   It's stressful wondering if you'll wait long seat every time come here  <EOR> Another fantastic lunch KoMex!  bulgolgi tacos KimChi chicken fettucine bulgolgi fusion burrito  Service prompt   watched waitress served everyone room made sure refill water before needed ask   Always worth star me!

Decatur just north 95 across Ford Jack Box nestled quiet strip mall  The other location buffalo just south flamingo also corner  may actually favorite spot Vegas considering big locations  I really enjoy beef chow fettuccine  ordered literally every time   Every time greeted perfect portion chips salsa   Very personable environment usually pleasantly calm  Perfect date night family night out   Both locations same vibe  mix mash bamboo wall screened windows tv usually background  Buffalo location usually holiday lights <EOR> This place reminded Yama Sushi being crowded limited privacy spacing  bad point father engaging other customers conversation! Luckily didnt mind though  Lol   Fusion Bulgogi Nachos 7 real tasty just didnt nachos made all  hard bite which made less enjoyable  Lets say more vigorous crunch nice crisp  Spicy Pork Plate 9 deliciously moist sweet tender perfect bite it! Comes whole pot rice not literally    Comfort wise just bathroom needs some work   Some needs but wont stop coming back try more different entrees  <EOR> Tofu enchiladas?! can't even find stuff LA!  KoMex gem  cheap fast unique most importantly TASTY! love concept fusion foods feel more American  P awesome see different cultures mix well together!   I came before leaving Las Vegas  no where near strip thank god   I growing quite weary obnoxiously drunk loud Jersey Shore rejects swarming streets     We ordered Chow Fettuccine Chow mein but italian fettucine noodles wok stir fried red onions cabbage korean bbq beef shrimp chicken  All $10!! Can't especially if lost all your dough Vegas   TOFU ENCHILADAS!! Sounds weird tastes awesome  plate comes rice beans tomato shredded lettuce red sauce  forgot much tho also complimentary chunky salsa guac chips free refills!   might say most delicious FUH REE guac salsa eva haaaaaaad!

The service more when friend's dinner party they're running around all crazy trying play host hostess    little chaotic sporadic but job done   Also very friendly!  The food great   chicken fusion taco hubs chicken fried rice split fusion bulgogi fries   also bring chips salsa snack while peruse menu   chicken bulgogi taco delicious btw wee tacos if want try different kinds could probably order 3 entree sized meal really enjoyed it   half order fries plenty 2 adults and both pretty good eaters    fried rice better your standard take out fried rice hubs didn't cover soy sauce he usually does     All all food great next time might just call order pick up   They also note menu menu truncated allow expansion      no indication where other location hope closer though! <EOR> Awesome food even more amazing prices  I vegas searched some good places try Komex came up  took parents drove over   We each ordered bulgogi burrito  also tried pork taco bulgogi taco  korean fusion before but even better  food does take while come but its worth wait   Oh while waiting your food they serve homemade chips  guac salsa delish!   totally worth drive strip  total meal 4 under $30 wtih tax  yay!  oh serve bottled water instead tap part your meal nice! Love Komex <EOR> I don't think going crazy  But KoMex just   ok?! longest time place #1 place yelp  gf decided trip because taco bender weeks  Plus Korean Mexican food fusion   I convinced would place no matter what   Welp   Although service top notch   food very underwhelming   I tried Steak chicken pork komex tacos along big heaping plate kimchi fried rice   Chicken Taco Lots meat but felt only eating texture sauces  Nothing all stood out   Steak Taco enjoyed eating but compared all other taco shops eating weakest steak tacos during run  can't put finger but something missing   Pork Taco Pretty good taco everything tasteful no real complaints  Heck if stop would definitely these   As Kimchi rice don't really know   it's mindfuck try figure why  subpar  No matter amount spices sauces would try add nothing brought any real flavor   I don't know if everyone suffering groupthink if becoming pseudo hipsteresque great places before cool even though never talked until fact nerd but many other places better this    I don't think way try place again  But wish $500 shirt them spill water yell DARE SPILL WATER ROCK's $500 SHIRT? everyone know hypothetically important am   #iloweredyourIQby50 <EOR> Went back    time tried fusion tacos   wonderful    taste Korean meets Mexican sauces ingredients    very unique wonderful union two great foods normally would expect combined     also fried rice    excellent    Usually its hard table during lunch time thus bit later no problem    service food both amazing  <EOR> Ohmygosh  bulgogi chimichanga??!

I roommate time Bulgogi Kimchi fried rice Bulgogi fried rice split Bulgogi nacho fries  nacho fries infused dish surprisingly delicious! lot different flavors but actually worked  Bulgogi cheese pico de gallo Korean gochujang sauce  Sounds lot going but would definitely order again!  The Bulgogi Kimchi fried rice wasn't anything special but bad tasting  think could whip better    Overall would give 4 5 awesome KoMex fries average Korean fried rice  <EOR> It first time last visit  don't know where place 4 5 stars yelpers  8 dined tonight  separate bill 20% tip added each bill    My friends ordered chimichanga burrito kimchi fried rice pork sliders  only ordered pan fried fish  asked if deep fried breaded  waitress told grilled fish  What? But adventurous food lover ahead gave chance anyway  disappointment! dish last came out  fish fillet cold bland soggy felt apart soon touched fork asked chopsticks instead  vegetables mostly broccoli few pieces onion green bell pepper also tasteless  couldn't tell if grilled pan fried  Standard Korean sticky rice came nothing special  barely eaten food  Most friends didn't finish neither    I going Calypso Lemonade but decided skip disappointed food was    My advice spend your money elsewhere  place doesn't worth drive North Las Vegas  <EOR> Let's short simple    walked young man door said no dine ins due big party coming  He said take only    agreed  other rude man said order counter but way he said demanding  He reminded C O prison    didn't even sit down eat because customer service horrible  said     Screw Komex fusion all rudeass employees! <EOR> I love place! best friend decided take lunch hour try KoMex  ordered quite few dishes pork torta Philly cheese steak kimchi fried rice calamari taco pork belly taco rice beans  Everything made quickly everything delicious! staff very friendly which always visit pleasant  definitely back! <EOR> Tasty unusual but far healthy decent way start   tiny restaurant combine Korean Chef Mexican Chef magically mix two cultures into interesting flavor combination   Everything tried far tasty but leaves feeling little greasy afterwards   Good lunch but early seat   Definitely worth try if your want something new interesting   Delicious food! <EOR> i ate year two ago   only meal vegas remember thats good was   love komex back ASAP next time Vegas! <EOR> I very disappointed last two times eat here  people came felt food bland nothing special  Wonder happened? food used pretty good here  heard opened new locations  Maybe chef new locations?

For meal both wontons beef pork chicken tacos  split beef tostada  While chicken pork both good beef star here  fantastic fusion tostada  tostada great fresh toppings but instead corn flour tortilla came something made rice  whole rice grains still visible  think any trip should include fusion tostada  Janet tried tofu taco since husband pescetarian she said quite good too   The only misfire mango passionfruit iced tea  don't flavors  Janet said she liked it  Service excellent  really hustling  just before lunch rush  I would love come back KoMex explore menu  <EOR> I am HUGE fan Mexican food  lived Mexico off three years  heard place was   unsure   but brother law absolutely raved figured would give try    All say WOW  party four ordered few appetizers all kind communally taste tested meals  didn't single thing wasn't fabulous    The restaurant itself didn't look much but place delivered delivered big  pretty far away where live otherwise I'd eat every week  back numerous times referred plenty people  all fusion food places haven't found beats KoMex  <EOR> This place saved vote  brother husband both wanted Mexican food wanted Asian food  solved delimma going Komex! place super packed waited 10 minutes     I KimChee fried rice which really good! nervous ordering because thought would salty   perfect amount spices though  portions big plenty left overs! <EOR> I really didn't know expect place  combination Korean Mexican didn't immediately appeal but reviews good figured should give try  street Meadows Mall corner strip mall  Which made even more leery   plus side pretty packed Wednesday night   a good sign right?

It sometimes busy 12 1 lunch crowd  But off hours best service if wait busy hours worth it   I ordered beef fusion tacos flour visit great  <EOR> Loved Bulgogi Tater Tots they're amazing also tried nachos very good also! usually order haven't any complaints! <EOR> This small but popular Korean Mexican restaurant located Decatur Blvd  staff very friendly offered take order while waited table   fried wontons 4 per serving costing mere $1 good but totally unnecessary since preceded complimentary housemade chips salsa guacamole   order 4 barbecue tacos 2 pork 1 chicken beef came cilantro lettuce onions kimchee latter being optional   Each very good excellent though next time would skip beef flavor sic pork chicken <EOR> This small mom pop place outside Vegas strip  Service great food even better  couples times now favorites still various fusion tacos  Mexican tacos Korean meats just well together  If you're ever tired eating endless buffets   try place! highly recommend guarantee won't disappointed  <EOR> Great food even better prices  what more say   new GOTO spot Vegas!!!! <EOR> I'm torn  high expectations obvious reasons rave reviews average 4 5 stars doesn't appreciate good fusion menu? want believe those expectations caused less awesome experience but nevertheless wasn't impressed   My friend big fan shared half order Bulgogi Nachos Fusion Flautas Fusion Tamal Bulgogi full order Kimchee Fried Rice Pork  heard buzz around fusion nachos most excited try them  Bulgogi tasty but rather sweet marinade nothing spectacular Korean marinated beef goes  chips okay  they're housemade but batch lacked crunch needed  pico de gallo fresh delicious  thought use Gochujang Korean red pepper paste sauce nice touch  Overall just shrug  could without it  liked crunch achieved fresh tortilla Flautas but again no sparks  guacamole gochujang sauce interesting! Tamal dry surprisingly flavorless my friend agreed   Lastly Kimchee Fried Rice flavorful spicy! Neither really cared but won't deny good    When don't something extremely popular find yourself having explain your reasoning great detail  food okay borderline good  may enjoyed more without high expectations dishes being amazing  certainly better superior Mexican counterparts I would choose carne asada nachos over bulgogi nachos every time Korean cuisine lacks  good stuff? portions generous price right! am willing give place another whirl though  doesn't believe second chances? <EOR> I would give place 4 star typically  decor needs work fusion food better Kogi Los Angeles  But chips guac salsa great food good  Cheap portions generous  Nice people too  would return  <EOR> This place bees knees!!

Nope   photos shows side burrito but didn't any   Thats fine   without kimchee   cant without flavorless meat         Bulgogi Burrito wimpy burrito rice bulgogi whats supposed bulgogi  People claiming burritos humongous   mine could bigger burrito Roberto's   Maybe small because didn't lettuce pico   Honestly wants lettuce burrito if food served warm lettuce would become soggy   good idea IMO   meat lacking flavor rice well mexcian rice simple nothing stand outish special all  even put sweet spicy red sauce burrito frankly  only thing saved   mention first bite gristle   hate gristle   Uhhhh !

Thank you!!! <EOR> What best way Asian eat Mexican food? fusion Korean  few years working Mexican then Southwestern restaurant Mexican usually lower list favorite cuisines    With Komex definitely change mindset  $2 taco stuffed full meat veggies ask kimchi  If trying lighter option lettuce wrap instead tortillas done  bulgogi favorite put into onto anything  Tacos    BULGOGI!    Nachos    BULGOGI! does matter bulgogi needs it  <EOR> I stop thinking place!  Instead trying relive experience just going give reasons why need go   1  Check deals 2  Free chips salsa guac 3  Food awesome Love tacos! 4  Cheap! 5  Veggie options 6  lady owns super nice <EOR> On whim decided try place because yelp tagged vegetarian friendly  First all GPS unable find place kept making destination somewhere Yale St  which super ghetto  Finally came senses just read address decided would right off Decatur   which is  even though its located vicinity ghetto its main drag its easy find   After using Yelp while find its most helpful finding Diamond rough restaurants would never gone if some random review really excited some random type food  best experiences ive some hole wall places great service great food  If experience looking then KoMex certainly your alley   For while actually wanted China Poblano Asian Mexican Fusion Cosmopolitan  Even though massively overpriced everyone says its worth because entire idea asian mexican fusion place just entirely ground breaking  Even some random food network talking head said so  While reading reviews China Poblano find same sentiment  Its great food wise but wow! great idea! KoMex believe everything China Poblano should been  KoMex cheap innovative most importantly food great! Vegetarian fusion stir fry burrito can't stop thinking when somehow work another trip North Decatur again   KoMex Fusion Express definitely keeper  <EOR> Alright place definite regular companions primarily two reasons 1 food deeeelicious 2 prices super duper reasonable    First order complimentary chips salsa guac which already hard like  Also while haven't tried everything menu  recently added more repertoire including pork belly spam musubi which really really tasty  pork belly just right amount stomach fat sorry if sounds unappetizing meat cooked slightly crispy edges but still able melt your mouth alongside bite full rice seaweed  Other to's usually fusion tacos fusion   anything usually spicy pork  bulgogi good but little sweet opt pork which just right amount heat  Also another fave mine add onto everything homemade chili sauce thing? sure is? But bits looks kimchi chili paste hits spot every time!   The only critique is     they don't serve alcohol LOL  avid drinker but sometimes it'd nice ice cold beer while eating Korean Mexican fusion tacos    Lastly   if myself drink water non sugary drinks camel recommend ordering regular ice tea  less $2 think glass way huger unlimited refills   and some reason refill faster! <EOR> Awesome overused however case wholly true    only rating food here    which totally deserves 5 stars the location bit dive but food TOTALLY made that! I double meat Bulgogi plate beef chicken no rice steamed veggies absolutely perfect slow carb lifestyle leading  Both beef chicken Bulgogi perfectly cooked i e  dry nasty moist tender FULL awesome flavor  veggies also perfectly al dente not mush raw tasting deliciously fresh just enough crunch satisfy    My friend Bulgogi beef burrito    and damn more little epic! Bulgogi stuffed inside flour tortilla rice cheese then topped salsa    Damn fine!   There selection Korean Mexican sauces salsas choose each them wonderful spicy but enough zip your your attention  All full bodied flavor did disappoint  I highly recommend establishment comfort food well low carb lifestylers   <EOR> Yes updating but keeping same rating    Man place really gotten busy since time opened!

My friends ordered fusion tacos beef pork everyone table highly please taste such cheap cheap price I believe $1 95 tacos where better deal other Taco Bell Del Taco?! While service slammed night able talk owners while very busy still showed awesome service even when many questions ask amongst busy was  Very nice owner willing explain everything down last ingredient  definitely return again new favorite fusion restaurant!

Because eat top layer left plain ole tortilla chips  fun good that? Think okay?  Kim chi  jarred? why chopped little? kimchi should some spicy heatness it  kimchi lacked serious flavor  swear jarred am thinking might able more flavor profile if your own  Think okay?  The fusion calamari taco  wasn't bad  don't much pick it  ate all  However don't know expected head but fusion just made think would different  just two long pieces deep fried calamari flour tortilla some lettuce toppings fusion tartar sauce  LIKED but didn't LOVE it   Bulgogi  Fried Rice  win portion amount  Hands down  big just nachos  But when first word Bulgolgi expect more bulgolgi  should caught when waitress kept correcting calling beef  just thought she being rude didn't way saying it  flavor profile fried rice decent  am self proclaimed fried rice snob honestly say didn't add anything taste better  just needed more meat  would gladly receive smaller portion bulgolgi fried rice  Think okay?   Spam Musubi  Oh yeah  your saving grace bit into sucker angels started singing me  But spam nori love?  So Komex am left with? Would return? Yes  did you  rush back? No  bit far just need some improvements    Sincerely Debra W  <EOR> Don't come looking gourmet experience  fast food very affordable dine in fusion food  close early way North Vegas   If you're looking delicious food though please stop here  Lunch perfect time go  stopped weekday empty  located strip mall easy miss   But food just straight delicious!
