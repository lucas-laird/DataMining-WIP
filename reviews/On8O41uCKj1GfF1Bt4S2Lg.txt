Came another time when half off drinks pretty disappointed slushy machine broken brother ordered Route 66 Cherry Limeade which wasn't delicious Strawberry Limeade which real chunks strawberries  <EOR> Sonic some interesting stuff menu  When think Sonic think people munchies because right state mind don't think would eat half stuff menu  usually feel overwhelmed all drink choices  Don't wrong   I've good food but next day never really sits well = sure eat Sonic again   and regret next morning  love hate relationship but  usually case comfort food  <EOR> Good food drinks   Wish town   Alawys good choice once you're tired eating buffets paying expensive meals  <EOR> As food service employee myself know frustrating customers be  However never encountered situation where necessary give customer attitude over something isn't even fault  Sandy gave rude service helpful slightest  other girl window apologized attempted situation better but Sandy's attitude ruined entire experience  heard berating other employees faults placed everyone  no excuse behavior ruined sonic me  <EOR> This definitely most incompetent Sonic ever encountering least 1 issue each time stop by  only reason continue frequent location because near Rachel S' work only places when visit during lunch breaks  Typical issues place include over under charging getting order wrong taking 15+ min order which usually only includes few chicken strips tots iced teas    If still decide come you've warned! stop Wednesday evenings though Wacky Pack Wednesdays where kid's meals aka wacky packs only $1 99! <EOR> This good Sonic  is  best food there's worse  hot except tots  lukewarm best  chili dog really good  burger also quite tasty  location bit sketchy others mentioned  great late night  <EOR> Yay sonic!!! busy location but always fun! <EOR> Terrible service woman drive thru rude literally kept waiting every time asked question   somewhere else especially if you're rush because can't order inside only wait hope your order taken car <EOR> Forgot half order burger dry AF  sonics really needs  straight  asked sauces didn't give them me  Drove away only realize forgot give cheesy tots drive back  recommend place  <EOR> Fast courteous service good value food  coming years  Basically pull hit button order swipe your card fast food comes smile few minutes later  Usually servers deliver food if you're parked stall via skates  skates idea different unique Sonic Drive In establishments  drive thru wait time somewhat desired ready wait few extra minutes before receiving your order  However if they're ball day they'll deliver simpler order your car even if two three back first then let go  also unique customer service feature some other Sonic Drive Ins  <EOR> Bad customer service  Food horrible! Employees seem care  treated customer before horribly  <EOR> Vegas complete without fix Sonic's  Those damn Chilli Dog Tater Tots coming back more  Try Chocolate Peanut Butter Shake! good   <EOR> If could give place 0 stars would! Horrible car service!!! took 45 minutes give food order wrong charged tater tots didn't even get  Also corn dogs burnt AF  well apparently rationing condiments because two ketchup packages 4 corn dogs  Overall awful experience!! could've flown back LA gotten food faster! Unacceptable service ain't 5 star restaurant! <EOR> So many good things say sonic location first would say great tasty burger thirst quenching cherry limeade anytime day  Second can't ever remember having bad service staff though young best customer service pleased help your experience best  I'm sure most know can't ever wrong when stopping feed craving just snacking  enjoy kind others yelp on! <EOR> It took many years finally Sonic restaurant because where am does Sonic  Good food service somewhat slow but worth it  <EOR> Came because friend's tradition sonics every time Las Vegas  food decent but nothing special  might give them another chance but hotdogs instead  <EOR> Great food ofcourse but location terrible service unorganized know own product  It's great open 24hrs nd directly across Palms Place <EOR> Okay KNOW writing review fast food place but COME Sonic  First all right across Palms open 24 hours  Dangerous amazing  Secondly drinks perfect mixing alcohol because they're essentially just club soda syrup  personal favorite diet cherry limeade vodka  Route 66 size add some vodka some tater tots Vegas style friends  <EOR> Prices cheap    food good  Happy hour 2 5pm drinks sodas lemonades slushies HALF OFF!!!   But best all    CHILI CHEESE TOTS ONIONS!!!!!

Boo!  When Vegas very excited few things Buffets Partying Tanning Sonic  This best food ever but enjoyed just everything tried Sonic   terms fast food really hit mark   If you've never before highly recommend getting Tater Tots Popcorn Chicken Breakfast Burrito salsa French Toast Sticks Slushies!! My faves Super Peach Ring Lemonberry Fruit Slush I order comforts air conditioned car   Then cute high school kid come rollerskating car all deliciously fried foods sugary goodness filled drinks   This obviously somewhere every day   But late night club drunchie fest?  Sonic Drive In perfecto  <EOR> We decided come night gambling   We're Hawaii all know place what's commercials   We pleasantly surprised  drive style set up   parking lot full speakers menus   best part    your order delivered guy gal roller skates   love it!  The food good   I chicken sandwich texas toast   YUM   Husband tater tots which he lalalalaloved   I would definitely back   if anything see food being delivered via rollerskates LOL  <EOR> Sausage egg cheese breakfast burritto peach lime aide  Thats talking breakfast champions   Also banana milkshake awesome! Made real bananas whip cream   don't eat fast food anywhere else  <EOR> I always wonder whyyyyy show some commercials LA County  Ruby Tuesday  Dunkin' Donuts  Cici's Pizza  Sonic  Angelinos sometimes don't know any better  see shit TV actors believable food looks yummy everything all rainbows flowers  Truth we're idiots library Clueless  gets worse once travel state come across 'As Seen TV' establishments    SONICCCCC! Ohhhhhhh U turn let's go!  conversation awry friends cruised through Vegas hot summer night  pulled parked looked over menu  Land Oz everything looked amazing! because amazing but because just don't Sonic LA  little carhop girls skating around  Between enticing menu roller skates all ADD kids knowing order where focus eyes  far Sonic cool!  Cool didn't last long once food arrived  1 word salty! swore thought going develop hypertension eating here  hot dog ok nothing special  But tater tots oh excited just littered salt  all thought just way salty enjoy  cherry slushy drink nice 'n sweet which meant might become diabetic also! overall meal made decent late night snack  Sadly Sonic list places stop when see them outside LA  Ruby Tuesday Cici please don't let down when come your town  <EOR> Bust    place is total bust   Seeing commercials Sonic but none within 50 mile radius stop when Sin City   service kind sloppy little slow attentive when asking ketchup   hungry dug into fries ketchupless   quite satisfying if America's favorite condiment accompanied fries   food pretty mediocre   Nothing really rave disappointment  <EOR> First time ever tried Sonic experience may probably also last  took approximately 45 minutes orders come only reason why even ever because asked where hell was  Turns completely forgotten because suddenly busy   busy referred drive thru line non existent normal length back non existent duration wait  Basically busy all rather just average less average sized fast food crowd set incompetent staff  Given lukewarm temperature food inferred orders promptly prepared but forgotten soon left cold  You'd think employee some rationale would run into eventually say Hey! order this? Why just sitting here? star granted mercy manager refunded meager compensation atrocious experience here  say considerable conviction greatest regrets life passing over In n Out time try sorry excuse fast food joint  <EOR> I am HUGE Sonic lover  Saddly closest house LEAST FAVORITE SONIC!!! service very slow 4 5 times grilled cheese order under cooked soggy  If craving some Sonic try avoid unless happy hour am going strictly Limeaide   One bonus location recognize coworkers    if drive thru packed park stall every now then food brought first  TOTALLY forgotten well     guess pretty hit miss here  <EOR> Came over 2year old took 20 minutes place order hour it! worst restaurant ever 57 years!! Unreal!!! Embarrassing if owner!! Hope don't sick! <EOR> LET KNOWN 4 STARS DRINKS FOOD   The burgers chicken bites all pretty generic  drove some friends even food poisoning though told breakfast burrito 5pm! Jack Box! Anyway food Sonics serves only something munch while partake some most glorious non alcoholic liquids ever created   2p 5p happy hour half off all drinks  friends missed but whatever  grabbed cranberry limeade slush orange flavoring just bees knees  drove all way LA drink almost sad when throw cup away   Sonics drinks just damn good made many combinations on top being customizable despite barely tolerable food still give 4 stars  <EOR> for years watched sonic commercials willing pay $50 burger slush  finally day came  and paid around $11 breakfast sandwich  fries  a burger 44oz slush  was good commercials depict be? No but hey big macs  the burgers better most fast food chains though  and slush did live hype though gave biggest brain freeze life!! going again because hey nothing beats hangover better sonics!! <EOR> This review based fact Vegas   group wanted lunch   wanted light lunch before buffet planning later day   Sonics agreed upon them  I hesitant Sonics when Vegas   could anywhere anytime why now?  But agreed needed light lunch why cheap while it   Unfortunately wasn't cheap   can't just $1 burgers cuz they're tiny you'll still starving afterwards   large chili cheese fries split also   The burgers    sucked   Even dollar sucked   Badly   chili cheese fries    WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY overly salty   tempted drench ketchup dilute salt   Horrible   Don't Vegas fast food if don't here   There's N few miles away    <EOR> No stars but Yelp made horrible service!! waited 45 mins shakes  shakes!!! Tuesday night only 4 other cars  Then manager apologizes gives chips 4 free limeades next visit? Really?? don't think want wait limeades future  thanks but no thanks! Server did great job though! <EOR> Reviewing backed other sonic experiences always come shakes! 1 2 off between 8pm midnight!   You whole lot Shake!!! really open 24hours at least drive through is   Very convenient late night cravings normal sonic prices since right strip  <EOR> Really can't wrong sonic treats slushies  really don't care food beside tots fries if tell them want freshly made  half price shakes 8 pm  <EOR> Seriously?! Such disappointment  remember having sonics when kid liking very much  But always seeing commercials would think maybe wrong need give another chance day   Well another chance given while vegas gosh right all along!! late night boppers hangin outside being rowdy noisy all over place just made worse  ordered speakers would keep screeeeechinggg making loud ugly noises  food totally just BLAH  dont even remember anyone ordered   even forgot until saw pictures friends camera guess memorable enough totally forgot even there   eating sonics all felt crap    = I think best thing cherry limeade drink  No joke   *sigh* <EOR> I eat quite bit  #7 Coney dog tots  cheap $6 69 serves its purpose  fast car hops generally pretty nice all time no bothers while eating   Always route 44 cherry slushy road <EOR> Across street Palms Place Sonic  NEVER visited one  always ask friends Where hell they?  Gilroy  Gilroy??   So anyway I bit blown whole setup  Fools ordered dude roller skates brought food super quickly  Eventually needed step decision    And      on menu      with big picture    Free Tots Cheeseburger purchase  Oh sheee it    Made decision even rocked whole Hook Cheese Chili tots   pay difference  straight    I looked little price window scanned Debit  touched many times  could see no numbers only squares    Not long recevied burg  sorta Wendy's but bigger  kinda loved it  tots good    Afterwards stomach ache while swimming off pool  Sonic food just sits ya    But I'd back just often  <EOR> Not good but bad    This location stones throw hotel room Palms Place came burgers 3 times    They bunch crackheads working but they're open 24 7 happy hour runs early afternoon early evening where burgers such 1 2 off    You 5 big ass Sonic burgers 12 bucks during happy hour    Fries decent drive thru service quick 2 outta 3 times    Even though staff high didn't screw no tomatoes no lettuce plans all    If your staying Palms Place right across street 50 bucks would cost full room service stumble across street 50 dollar bill could enough food serve your floor  <EOR> The only real reason keep coming because its very convenient only five minutes away  try keep order short because your average wait 35 45mins  noticed though no matter order always seems take long  ordered full meal two made orders just drink still manage take long! tried going during different times different days its always same thing  gotten order wrong few times half time food cold  only really when no other options if want drink milkshake because half priced  Other wouldn't going back   Oh definitely avoid Thursdays 9ish  parking lot gets full motorcyclists take whole place more half them don't buy anything just hang there  <EOR> Mmmmmm yummy write review am thinking tasty creamy cold banana shake just swirling around mouth!  My hubby made quick stop Sonic day work picked milkshakes sweet tooth  usually hot fudge chocolate shake malt however time mood try banana   Wow banana shake remember experience again sliced chunks fresh banana it! Unable drink shake straw every spoonful slice yummy real banana! Now shake really enjoyed nice fresh fruit chunks shake rather just flavoring   Sonic never let down keep great quality fast food keep coming over over! <EOR> I always come late night drinks  many options choose if 8pm half off shakes slushes! If need cheap large drinks don't want gas station then sonic way go  only give 3 stars because long takes sometimes order drive thru little crazy   They also really good hot dogs <EOR> LOVE LOVE LOVEEEEE Sonic! choose place over fancy restaurant ANY DAY  Ideal cheap date spot  burgers awesome cheap! its just shame bust mission find Sonic since none around home  Every time visit its such treat! ] <EOR> Apparently particular restaurant partnered Nevada state rehabilitation department staff facility mentally handicapped  fine  But when order frozen limeade hand plain limeade instead then your next visit order corn dogs chili dogs instead    well obviously people being properly supervised    I'm all providing work programs mentally handicapped  But also expect pay for  Sonic better job supervising am certain  Until though avoid Sonic Drive In 4260 West Flamingo Las Vegas  <EOR> I'm trying 'Pickle Slushie'   Totally doesn't taste anything flavored pickle super disappointed  <EOR> Great Sonic Blast  dont food because always screw but drinks awesome  <EOR> Want service smile? place  location number locations every person works extremely friendly kind  amazing  Food typical Sonic  <EOR>
