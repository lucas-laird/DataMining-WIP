Next started fries  also hit delicious but honest didn't want fill fries  star show  moved ribs   So ribs weren't exactly ribs used back North Carolina bbq country but judging them 'Las Vegas bbq' excellent  bbq sauce pan drippings  put box good  It  wasn't I'd call bbq sauce but great nonetheless   It probably much food but meant leftovers second half game!
