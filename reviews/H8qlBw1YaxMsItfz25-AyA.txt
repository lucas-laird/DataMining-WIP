The only single issue ever experienced time decided sit outside patio far left side restaurant   move could smell dumpster located parking lot due wind blowing between two buildings   relocated different table outside enjoyed fantastic meal  <EOR> If you're craving steak especially Sunday place must! heard good things JC over year ago but didn't wanna 40 minute drive Aliante  girlfriend agreed journey over weekend boy! worth drive!  On Sunday all steaks half off  offer three different varieties NY filet ribeye  both chose ribeye which normally $35  Typically steaks come fries salad but Sunday purchase sides separately  settled cheesy mashed potatoes skillet mac cheese which both $7   The steak incredible  Tender juicy packed ton flavor  mention huge 18 oz   definitely brought happy place   The sides described very well menu  When think cheesy mashed potatoes skillet mac cheese sounds you're real treat  much  cheesiness mashed potatoes come slice Kraft poorly melted top  Underneath bed mashed potatoes real potatoes but could use seasoning milk butter  mac cheesy nothing special  tasted better boxed mac cheese but $7 expect more   The service could use some work  ordered steak medium well crime know came close rare  put back grill bit longer came back well done most places  also ordered Bloody Mary specifically asked them spicy spicy  told waitress she did nothing  $10 down toilet   I'm definitely returning but probably just steak next around  <EOR> Great burgers Sunday night '1 2 off steaks' pretty sweet too! Don't miss glorious carrot cake best town! <EOR> Very mediocre    This place close house wish potential regular happy hour spot but sadly does not    I roughly 6 months ago hopefully some things changed    They no beer tap    really? Shocking  food decor average  prices reasonable    Until beer tap return  <EOR> Always good time enjoy fun vibe West side gin mill  Sexy staff good food good times always! <EOR> For convenient neighborhood restaurant need better food  servers friendly location good but food product below average   Dinner tonight two uninteresting wrap sandwiches overloaded lettuce Chinese chicken salad pile iceberg lettuce vague hint some dressing canned mandarin oranges some cold dry grilled chicken breast   Chinese chicken salad   You need better chef design menu  great simple tasty food prepared correctly served well  neighborhood restaurant succeed otherwise just bar  <EOR> 6 came table no time  greeted waitress right away orders drinks taken  menu typical small pub but told Surf turf special steak lobster tail  mind orders placed  Myself buddy ordered same meal both ordering steaks medium rare  20 25 minutes later meals 5 party brought out  wife didn't receive dinner steak potato  Mine buddies steak crisp over cooked dry stiff  Lobster tails extremely small 2oz straight cold rubbery  asked meals redone waitress finally sent them back  Meanwhile sit wait  10 minutes later receive plates back but no lobster  Just steak plate   WTH!! whole time wife NEVER meal brought table!

Whoever said food mind blowing needs more   food average decent bar food   Due servers' low aptitudes don't always things ordered which pain ass when order burger rare comes well done   order dressing side your salad arrives weighed down it  When food ordered delivered correctly OK   But damn if INCONSISTENT   Lunch your best bet followed Monday through Thursday EARLY dinner   If Friday night size food halved no manager ask it    other times helpings almost double large   And last but least why place actually getting yelp review me   the sacrilege Philly cheesesteak items sandwich fries    Philly native know am going more prone being offended things but frankly putting mushrooms into mix just sick wrong   love mushrooms but no place recipes   Onions yes but put little there   Peppers add them please   won't even into your cheese sauce off mark   But love all right world stop mushrooms already  <EOR> It's long don't even remember original review    Went last night buddy pleasantly surprised  Food good service great  don't drink  buddy beer  Only reason mention because sometimes type establishment find if you're really drinking don't treated great  case last night  waitress excellent  Always checking see if wanted soda refill if wanted water  she friendly  quite sure why many negative reviews    We didn't put penny machine drink but beer between 2 people some food  Food good  Service good  Wednesday night surprisingly crowded  <EOR> August 2 sat tatay what's receipt she awesome   multiple times service okay but time great   she never lets your drink low she's fast very sweet   Food always yummy <EOR> We thought would try something new  Thanks Groupon John Cutter choice  really liked atmosphere when walked in  Plus option sitting outside  Service friendly very relaxed setting  ordered cheesy Cajun chicken penne carne Asada tacos  food good  Nothing spectacular but good  sure we'll return  But glad tried once  <EOR> Let just say thing CHEESE STEAK FRIES !

Sunday half off great deal  wait shorter expected  place small but well worth because ribeye die for! Great music server awesome! definitely coming back  <EOR> Friday night hike Vegas heat suggested take refreshments John Cutter nearest bar Red Rock Canyon  driven many times but never tempted probably because location sleepy shopping area anchored Albertsons   It's quite cool inside high tables lots tvs nice moody lighting  fascinated staff vision interview process involves following conversation Q wear very tiny tank top? A looks very small      but ok  you're hired Yes Hooters 'burbs'  bad thing? Depends   Anyway pots beers wines food especially burgers huge Michelle Obama would seriously p $ ed  took chicken flatbread thing some feta cheese tomatoes pretty good  group took some Pot Stickers looked little deeply fried liking but she happy  Other guys took monster burgers satisfied   I don't know think      it ok but lucky live Vegas many choices Yelp app try again  <EOR> After finding loyalty club online stop join! known place quite some time never made here  bit off beaten path unless your path takes deep into Summerlin    The loyalty club includes gaming promos birthday freebie count in! bartender signed she told $10 play would available right away earning 20 points  sign above bar join text club did getting offer $20 match play  informed offer same $10 earning 20 points  She told she would put $10 card next time  shall return! would nice both offers cause confusing if same offer          ?????  It's small place big room dining gaming drinking etc  bar  Must nonsmoking believe  Outside seating also available  menu many different apps meals etc  choose Sunday steak special 50% off steaks  <EOR> The food decent but if actually service once seated if service comes lot bad attitude!  I'd recommend skipping place! <EOR> Went kids not ideal  If family woman single man group men mother two kids fit into neither latter forget it  owner saunters kids waitresses did see waiter chosen dimensions suddenly best behavior  waitress actually waiting table friends would come table shots serve TAKE friends group  service terrible food wasn't bad actually decent but service atmosphere just worth it  <EOR> The food good but  only redeeming quality  seating  is cramped always bumped into obnoxious regulars   waitresses never your order right unless just order fries even then she wrong kind beer  waitress more concerned getting trying sell dessert another round drinks  Don't bother bringing ANY kind coupons gift certificates staff argue accepting them don't bother telling didn't read conditions coupons did read totally understood cannot use coupons during happy hour ordered food happy hour coupons still accepted   lastly want add worked couple local bar restaurants currently work waitress major strip casino am very forgiving any wait staff come across already mentality the customer always wrong but staff horrible rude  Mark Riche's Chinese place next door WAY more friendly appreciative your business  <EOR> Rarely breakfast but mood today  disappointed all going John Cutters  JC Omelet hubby breakfast burrito shared pancakes  Everything delicious service excellent which always case when eat here  <EOR>
