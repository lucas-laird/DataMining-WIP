Okay no problem     when she finally engages takes order never came back check     but surely enough patron sitting next drink refilled four times 30 minute lapse then stops asked if want another   The saving grace Laker game gentleman works bar Monday night outstanding hence why came back location   Never again     Horrible service attitude! <EOR> Ice cold beer pretty bartenders    else ya need??

WHY?!   On July 3 7 3 11 drenched downpour work  wanted some hot food such crappy shift  texted coworker friend Matt see if he wanted grab some dinner  Unfortunately he didn't want Hawaiian Mexican few places showed Yelp being sort half way point between houses  GAWD   This third PT's eaten Las Vegas  must requirement PT's bartenders keep people waiting ignore them  bar asked menus handed menu  decided we'd split party bucket boneless chicken wings mild sauce  Why much food? Two individual dinners would run more $20 whereas bucket containing just chicken lot more would $18  Obvious choice  Right when ordered presented check split cost left tip  never restaurant only dine in pay tip before even your food    When wings weird crampy feeling stomach attributed sauce being crazy hot last time PT's  sauce wasn't even spicy hurting stomach  Clearly there's something else going on  wonder if use MSG soybean oil  No bueno both!  Asking water    geeze  irks when bar bartender pretending busy fiddling register nearly empty restaurant then walks off farthest part bar away me  sort customer service this? When already tipped least 15% prior even gettting meal expect stand bar fool until waiter decides come over take extra long making simple water  pretty sure because they're likely tip water refill but still customer service severly lacking ALL PT's   The next time somebody says want PT's answer resounding NO! <EOR> Eat elsewhere  Seriously  $11 99 three freaking chicken strips fries! thought other chicken strip places expensive where three sauces bread lot more fries 6 strips $9 50    The strips just your standard frozen mass produced cuts chicken pretty bland even worthy bar food   The bartender staff kitchen staff delivered food nice point  just tough give PT's any stars when prices damn high  <EOR> I love location! some many Pt's Vegas but way one  Its east side Vegas across street Wayne Newtons house Mr Las Vegas    Whenever am mood hot chicken fingers spot   There something sauce love  all years Vegas still love PT's chicken fingers   Its bit smokey bar area allows smoking but deal smoke good food!  Definitely recommend good bar food! <EOR> First time location  high expectations reading some recent reviews here   Draft beer selection OK happy hour half price all drinks jumbo sized brew bargain! bartender working which may standard Mondays ?? great service never felt abandoned  female bartender friendly easily joked around which great   I tend shove PTs bottom list because smoke factor but wasn't issue during visit  Luckily most customers weren't smoking but expected tavern!  I'm more PTs Gold Sierra Gold kinda gal but would return if area again  <EOR> Let start saying PTs regular all over town but location seriously lacking  came tonight mom bite eat  walk sit down table greeted bartender smile  She leans over bar direction table asks drink order  order water Diet Coke then since already knew wanted ordered pizza  Once served drinks checked until pizza came  No biggie but could used refills  Pizza comes just looking top tell its burnt  cheese bubbling top good way  slices black bottom crispy taste  again checked all until halfway through leaving burned chunks plate  bartender finally came over refills check but didn't ask food was  left final two pieces couldn't eat face down pan when bartender came back just asked done these? She clearly noticed burned crisp but didn't acknowledge  now sit home extremely upset stomach texting mom also suffering house  No plans visit location again  <EOR> This favorite PT's bartenders amazing being smaller location franchise very welcoming always enjoyed outing here <EOR>
