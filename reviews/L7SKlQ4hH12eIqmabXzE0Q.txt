The American quite good   egg whites overly greasy buttery hashbrowns perfect really crunchy outside super soft inside   know spam seems weird choice but never see menu he ordered actually very well prepared here   The eggs benedict great!   hate when drenched hollaindaise BUT put side love that!  Eggs perfectly poached dipped each bite hollandaise yum!  country potatoes thinly sliced potatoes cooked chives very good   fruit did mint taste hoping but did chop fruit into tiny bite size pieces which love   It good breakfast but problem ordered cranberry juice ice cost $7!!  Usually restaurant rule just order water but felt juice certainly paid price small cup juice should cost half price entree ridiculous!    Besides hefty juice price tag everything great   Food great would come again if stayed hotel  <EOR> Drinks horrible expensive here  Find another bar   Don't waste your time here  <EOR> This place perfect  Close strip but it  don't deal craziness  Valet fast  Rooms clean elegant  Pool nice! Hot tub soothing  heat outside desert heat  provide iced towel compresses  Complimentary sample slushies  Great food poolside  Nice drinks  Servers friendly accommodating  Just suggestion    sunblock provide which nice comes off pool making water whitish  see feel turnoff  Maybe provide waterproof lotion? Other very happy stay  flight leaving late night red eye check 10am  gave until noon $20 per person use spa shower before dinner flight  use steam room toiletries  Even snacks  Very convenient last day which spent poolside  <EOR> Before going show thought would stop check Trump hotel drink appetizers  We ordered 3 different appetizers wife ordered Trump wine all very good especially macaroni cheese Rand waiter he did excellent job he very knowledgeable menu wines ! Beautiful hotel ! bad didn't see Mr Trump though ! <EOR> An easy 5 Stars me! First  time atmosphere elegant yet comfortable enough casual wear  Staff very friendly attentive  ordered filet mignon absolutely succulent sliced ease melts your mouth recommend medium rare  husband rack lamb also medium rare amazingly delicious gamy salty others tried   Even house salad fresh refreshing bits cucumber add nice touch   Chaz server super friendly helpful recommending menu items   We definitely returning because experience wonderful   Can't wait dessert <EOR> Service excellent  awkward location lobby  couple friends  steak alright burger buddy supposedly good  definitely would  recommend restaurant definitely come back here  <EOR> Assuming other reviews correct place completely changed   no tasting menu   no soda list   no sommelier champagne cart   no sommelier period   also heard rumors caviar carts cognac carts dessert carts   Nope  anymore  place obviously designed fine dining restaurant excessive chandeliers all   But fine dining     But serve chicken wings quesadillas!  Looks trying typical 24 hour cafe any casino resort   Except don't casino probably ain't gonna work   If looking fine dining just decent food stay away   apparently did enough business decided cut serious corners  <EOR> Nice little lobby bar espresso martini great before breakfast drink <EOR> Excellent  Comfortable seating  3 course meal which fresh tasty creative which $30  also Osso bucco $40 which delicious  can't wait try happy hour  <EOR> After 11 hours driving through Colorado Utah tiny bit Arizona friend finally made Vegas    We exhausted chose just eat dinner hotel restaurant instead venturing strip  While don't regret decision really couldn't stand thought leaving wasn't completely sold DJT    I loved restaurant classy but still casual  server very sweet but she playing hostess too  other words she always MIA  Everything insanely slow here  time place order time waiting meals time waiting checks    quite frankly ridiculous    My friend both ordered small filet came fingerling potatoes sautéed kale  steaks cooked perfectly delicious  fingerlings all 2 them undercooked  sautéed kale vinegary super tasty    Last price  don't mind paying amazing food great experience    but on point  felt DJT good but worth steep price tag  many missed opportunities rate higher 3 stars  <EOR> Super expensive cocktails weren't well made  certainly wouldn't pay 34$ 2 normal sized poorly mixed drinks ever again  elsewhere drink  <EOR> I admit it    foodie    pay top dollar single ravioli    but stand 1 $14 ravioli come horrible service    Maybe waiter wanted home did arrive late around 9 30 but if don't want dine late should said closing     We asked wine comparable price taste bottle ordered earlier as ran wine he brought vintage   first bottle only $120 vintage $300   don't mind paying $300 bottle wine    if going long dining experience   but headed new club XS Wynn   thought pretty brazen that   way rest night debauchle   didn't lobster tail waiter less friendly some food came cold    warm    cold     The busboy fantastic    he catered everything needed noticing waiter didn't care anymore   food good but many dishes small   give fantastic thumbs rabbit gnocchi braised short ribs scallop risotto     As said before    its all service    especially Trump would expected more   Although say 1BR suite Trump wonderful! <EOR> Loved Butter Chardonnay  Also Fanny Bay oysters champagne pearls  Yummm <EOR> Service sucks  Waiter slow just nice  waitress feel welcomed case  But convenient hell  Plus bad service lowered overall expense since he sucked tip reflected that   Our food however excellent  <EOR> Ordered children food all came spicy    staying penthouse am impressed experience  I am supporting trump anyway during presidential election friends staying here   The service kind super super kind   Lovely service     Fix children's menu ensure zero spice   Thank you  <EOR> Hmm sounds restaurant changed quite bit!  wasn't tasting menu isn't 24 hour cafe other reviewer mentioned   But did simple dinner menu handful appetizers good selection salads entrees side dishes select from   My husband staying came dinner late Friday started off ravioli appetizer which GOOD cancelled dinner elsewhere next evening just eat ravioli again try some other food restaurant   In addition ravioli which 3 times total visit dragged other people me   really good artichoke ricotta mushroom cream sauce sun dried tomatoes sigh also curry squash soup cheesecake twice lamb chops ribeye steak roasted chicken hawaiian salad chocolate cake not great risotto asparagus    Their breakfasts also wonderful pricey but ate every morning during 5 night stay service outstanding Trump best hotels stayed at   paid lovely attention details don't casino isn't any second hand smoke worry about   all ravioli also sell Spanx lobby giftshop  <EOR> Breakfast review only Cold waffles mushy scrambled eggs average coffee uninspiring orange juice  $24 00 plus tax =

all   seafood although present overcooked flavors non detectable  Bagel Lox terrible many levels obviously DJT knows much bagels he does pizza   bagel itself doughy un bagel like   Gravlax oily inferior quality   red onion capers old dry lacking flavor obviously prepared days prior   When brought attention server no consideration given bill restaurant management   overall breakfast experience DJT overpriced horrible  <EOR> Recommend pulled pork sandwich panini most importantly waffle fries  <EOR> As restaurant directly across check in check out lobby area overall elegant nice design  However food dish offers leave much desired  breakfast overall ok nothing outstanding  wish more variety offer better taste  did enjoy coffee though  good  Customer service also decent  <EOR>

Suites credit restaurant  expected nothing less incredible fine dining experience but restaurant grossly underwhelming   We started 5 hour Kurobuta Braised Pork Belly  pork belly fine but blue corn meal pancakes mushy incredibly salty  much made entire dish impossible eat it integrated into entire dish   I ordered chestnut papperdelle texture which off putting all could bear pick small pieces pork plate  surface pasta dry hard but inside pasta all mushy   My mom miso braised black cod which just disintegrated when she pierced fork  Inedible hated texture  My brother chose rack lamb which though ordered rare served medium well  Curry flavor also strong   The list on     There just egregious flaw every item ordered  Though menu looked appealing execution each dish outright failure   Lastly bill totaled over $700 party 9 entirely much ended being completely sh*t meal  <EOR> Came Sunday noon lunch  Trump quiet  Definitely needed some time away loud rowdy casino scene strip  DJT only restaurant open time lunch   Place completely empty  Maybe came awkward time? Nevertheless seated immediately server Tony great very attentive   I lobster roll friends mahi tacos crab cake sandwich peach salad  All food ranged $15 20 per entree  food decent well justified price  Well portioned  <EOR> Did enjoy visit  yreated touist   drinks overpriced watered down  coming back BUYER BEWARE  <EOR> My husband college reunion friends   all stayed Trump Hotel Las Vegas  everyone arrived all met downstairs lobby bar some drinks chillaxin'   What great relaxing vibe LIVE MUSIC playing prompt service   Happy Hour 5 8 pm cocktails only $5 each  ordered light drink called Framboise Fizz raspberry flavor w some gin?

No   stayed wouldn't gone   But breakfast hotel pretty happy  <EOR> Great experience beautiful rooms great service look forward visiting another Trump Hotel future  <EOR> With many other great restaurants Las Vegas choose would suspect majority people eat guests hotel    guests certainly convenient   We breakfast morning    service quick we told hurry friendly   tried couple pastries which ok but nothing special    made in house I asked but them brought every morning   fruit also ok   husband said yogurt parfait very good  <EOR> I checked late night ordered room service     I ordered pizza steam vegetable life all balance right? Those steam vegetable just steamed fresh perfectly steamed  sounds easy but steam all perfectly isn't easy   Pizza perfect too!!! wasn't greasy just perfect   The hotel stay itself great  Staff helpful room very clean  Keeping politics hotel great  definitely stay again   even husband enjoyed veg  Seriously <EOR> On Vegas vacation boyfriend decided try DJT dinner wonderful! Reservations easy thru OpenTable seated immediately time 8 30  came Monday night few diners but very nice cozy   We both ended ordering Prix Fixe menu $29 cause such great deal  summer prix fixe menu started amuse bouche really nice light crab salad  main entrée orecchiette pasta pancetta ? tomato sauce  also very good! server raved new dessert homemade pineapple sorbet w candied pineapples toasted coconut  Unfortunately dessert way sweet couldn't finish but beautiful   All waiters servers very friendly attentive overall wonderful dining experience DJT! <EOR> Long wait waiter brought classic burgers instead turkey burgers  But ok that  Anyways tasty especially fries  cheesecake cappuccino perfect  Recommend  <EOR> If stay Trump know DJT well   ambience pretty service friendly food good   kind when only place hotel guests congregate  it easy meet lunch dinner drinks   wasn't best hamburger ever but wasn't worst definitely did trick   DJT back sure next time Trump nearby  <EOR> Had breakfast Trump Hotel $50 croissant egg sandwich 3 walnut pancakes!!   The pancakes horrible cold dry walnuts whole time taken cut them into smaller pieces!!  egg sandwich 2 whole pieces sausage pattys 2 sausage rolls cooked properly   What absolute waste money!  Grand Luxe breakfast buffet Venetian   fantastic! <EOR> Donald you're FIRED!!!!  We decided check new Trump Hotel Vegas since right across Wynn where staying weekend   found DJT only restaurant but since time very limited imminent departure airport figured we'd grab bite eat anyway   Let first say service impeccable waiter kind friendly despite fact only half party 6 even anything eat the other 3 breakfasted few hours earlier wife ordered pulled pork sandwich ordered panini    While suppose sandwich could qualify panini certainly  much better sandwiches pick Safeway    Worse still french fries simply fucking atrocious    don't know if fries way The Don likes them but plain simply fucking sucked    take microwaveable frozen aisle tater tots any day over repugnant pieces reconstituted potato sticks   I'm going stop before prolong torture    Let's just say won't eating ever again probably should avoid if palate    If other hand you're satisfied eating dirt shit off ground then you'll probably love place!
