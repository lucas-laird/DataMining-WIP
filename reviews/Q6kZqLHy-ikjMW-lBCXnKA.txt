First here  Second since am expert translating inanities obviously play Spanish expression ¡Olé! Funny enough though difference between Spanish language Spanish adjective referring nation Spain olé Spanish expression USED SPAIN    Not Mexico   Just clarify Mexico country North America whence come tacos while Spain country Europe whence came conquistadors created Mexico   Clear?  Obviously HMSHost family restaurants or tons other people outside restaurant industry fair tried fun cute play words relies having less understanding Mexican Things 101 Trump   I guess am surprised because when sat down ordered food hello CAN'T choose eat somewhere if vaguely edible celiac AIRPORT pete's sake waiter asked if wanted Mexican style American style?
