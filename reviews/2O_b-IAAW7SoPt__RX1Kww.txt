Restaurant insanely large  Looks nice inside very clean  seemed some sort buffet toward rear massive section dining rooms in    One worst pizzas ever had  slab floppy cardboard sheet plasticy cheese  Chewy crust flavorless sauce  certainly downed entire pie because 11 sheets wind but entire time trying wrap mind around why anyone would seek restaurant when Vegas  However beer special surprisingly good $3 Modelos though  Can't even buy beer liquor seller Strip much!  Service good  waiter very attentive friendly  Dig that Food also came fast thought restaurant nearly empty Sunday night  But even solid service can't dismal cuisine    <EOR> Ordinary breakfast buffet menu indifferent service worth bloated price   Yelp wants longer review add walked without ordering evening before when ignored wait staff  <EOR> Was morning breakfast! bit pricey  tip meal came over $18 all water two eggs over corned beef hash  slightly disappointed dish came room temperature poached eggs weren't even close runny  brother mother however $16 99 bagel lox platter weren't disappointed  Although bit much price did fair amount salmon  I'd try them again if prices lower  now nah  <EOR> The breakfast buffet isn't worth it  False advertising omelettes buffet consists  scrambled eggs fruit biscuits gravy fake bacon 15 99 Would never eat again <EOR> Great food great service   I new buca look next door tequila taco bar  upscale   Great place duck nice dinner chill@ Ballys <EOR> They received 2 stars poor service food good  But calamari     Patience necessary once bring your food no returns check your table see if need anything else  If service good would given them 4 stars  <EOR> This basic Italian restaurant good food   portions really good size each small dish feeds 2 4 people  money hotel hard would recommend it   Staff quick polite   Sorry pics everyone quick dig before could pics! <EOR> Service terrible food cold took 45 mins bring breakfast  going then change ask Lunch took long  come back food just terrible  <EOR> I'm probably being little generous four stars but stuffed mushrooms freaking delicious!
