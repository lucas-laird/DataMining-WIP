The food great very fast friendly service  ordered 5 taquitos salad  taquitos lots chicken  Great taste  <EOR> I visit place often only recall time waited almost 30 minutes food but believe short staffed thats reason 4 stars instead 5  Everything ive tried quesadillas tacos nachos shrimp cocktail consistent reasonably priced  Salsa bar always well kept its clean salsas Good   watered down Robertos usually does  Overall would say its great! <EOR> Alright place bomb reviews ain't no reason! came last night 5 minutes closing totally didn't check hours rushed slightest  order shredded beef wet burrito seriously 8 inches 4 inches least!!! Big burrito  great but unless also point flavor was! moved vegas year ago searching adequate Mexican food never really found until now  meat juicy put other stuff beans rice guacamole pico probably some other yumminess but can't remember  devoured two settings which resulted two equally large food comas! Yum yum yum!! No picture but looked good tasted  <EOR> Great carnitaa burrito!!!
