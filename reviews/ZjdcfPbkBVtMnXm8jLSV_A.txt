Good old fashioned greasy spoon comfort served all day long    Tiffany's Cafe adorable cozy  Note place nothing movie Breakfast Tiffany's if anything Tiffany lamps hanging over counter   This spot every time come Vegas  perfect late night away crowds craziness strip  Also best hangover food miles My friend Big John ate fill under $25 total! left stuffed delicious corned beef hash crispy bacon eggs cooked just way wanted old school home fries sourdough toast  <EOR> Greasy spoon Watching guy work grill watching ballet  lost art  <EOR> Don't watch them your food   Seriously   won't want eat afterwards   I ate friend recently made unfortunate decision sit counter   meant could watch them cook food   same server poured drinks cleared dirty tables wiped down countertops etc  same touched food sandwich components rolls vegetables etc  BARE hands   once did see wash hands   She placed dinner roll plate bare hands handling cash coins cash register then brought me   She started slicing cucumber quit briefly wipe dirty table rag then right back cucumber without washing hands   The main cook scrubbing down filthy stove bare hands all while flipping sandwiches burgers     I did see another customer wash hands he stepped right behind counter so   bad staff don't take cue him!  The food inedible   didn't expect much diner inside drugstore bad neighborhood near Strip but really awful   mashed potatoes instant gravy cold vegetables canned carrots overcooked fell through fork   friend didn't touch grilled cheese fries   It's cheap think   meal plus drink set back around $11 $12 including tax but tip   Considering won't able eat most you'll sick afterwards bargain   I don't think could drunk enough eat ever again   only people eat locals the kind ask if spare change food snobs read place Frommer's think they're getting something cheap authentic  <EOR> I preparing move away Las Vegas decided finally give place try since lived 14 years but still hadn't explored its offerings  kind landmark downtown area  Drug store diners aren't around much anymore which shame really   think real privately operated diner your local Walgreen's would big hit   But digress      Keeping things simple chili cheese fries iced tea    The chili cheese fries satisfying decadent plenty both chili cheese  Fries fine good average can't really remember   Just cool retro dining experience should missed   Go! Eat! Happy! <EOR> First off people work super friendly take good care if rating service alone I'd give them 5 but unfortunately greasy spoon just did live its reputation   Breakfast w wife two kids over $30 00 w tip wouldn't minded price if food better wasn't hot Hades inside place  kept simple Eggs over easy bacon toast order biscuits gravy coffee honest w whole experience letdown   My wife both agreed portion size decent but execution meal itself poor taste bland even found coffee bland  eggs runny bacon wife sausage overcooked just seemed lacking   don't doubt place might better offerings but sadly unless you're regular local can't see venturing your hotel place being worth it   I wanted Tiffany's lot old Vegas diner beyond Strip vibe but there's no getting around fact surrounding area leaves lot desired  sketchy say least plus surrounding drug store gone plastic sheets cover pretty dirty conditions once there   deliver which plus but does room service   Bottom line found meal pretty uneventful somewhat disappointing wouldn't way eat again  <EOR> Seems place down reviews  would say next two recent more line w experience  Forget story telling some bullet points Floor filthy  Nothing else place really looks clean either  One lady waited entire restaurant  Talk short staffed  Server fairly rude  don't mean 'not nice' mean condescending unhelpful generally void any hospitable qualities  It's hard mess breakfast food average  Potatoes plain sausage tasted funny maybe frozen? Eggs eggs  Buttered toast buttered toast  Room temperature liquid creamer packets  Ketchup plastic bottle tasted looked unusual    My GF decided just wait car she sat down look place  She's germ a phoebe  Me? eat half weird tasting sausage patty best can    Probably more appropriate place come drunk  cheap   <EOR> I breakfast four co workers  greasy spoon expectations weren't high  wasn't disappointed  liked atmosphere  exactly you'd expect greasy spoon  No frills  Spread instead butter definitely something avoid bland coffee   Portion sizes generous  ordered Spanish Omelet which boss stated tasted Italian Omelet but bad  Ham Steak Eggs which reported tasty girl ordered wasn't able finish it  Another girl ordered New York Steak Eggs medium rare she put Now don't want red but want little red  But don't burning steak don't want charred  take care steak now    last girl ordered pancakes  No complaints  ordered corn beef three eggs sunny side up  hash greasy spoon eggs bit raw side potatoes all agreed interesting taste  all able food down    In other words  greasy spoon prices reasonable let pay separate checks no trouble  great   What could better  floors could cleaner  Just because foods greasy doesn't mean floor be   Also waitress memorable only kindness but also strong odor very well masked strong perfume  no problem personally but some people might   Finally prices food reasonable but drinks pretty pricey  Three bucks coffee? Stick water Starbucks later     Therefore fun  Caveat Emptor  Enjoy  <EOR> And award official greasy spoon Vegas to Tiffany's downtown Vegas     Why?  Because hard find true greasy spoon diner Las Vegas   Sure places all over down put eggs griddle serve greasy burger but most tucked away strip mall few if any old time soda fountain counter patrons sit at   The waitstaff awesome attentive   burgers aren't greatest thing you'll ever taste but remember diner   diner serving quality burger just right ratio grease cheese blended into bun     If you've time some morning take seat counter simple great breakfast off griddle   eggs right some crispy bacon   Thumbs up   [Cash only] <EOR> We finally made Tiffany's breakfast   pretty much would expect  Classic greasy dive diner   while food wasn't greatest thing ever anything pretty damn good   chili omelet Spanish omelet both delicious   burgers looked amazing definitely back try those  <EOR> Went into place because other options carls jr Denny's  Saw four stars yelp decided check out  Place odd decor seems very unclean  Service friendly although very slow unorganized  food mediocre best  hash browns three eggs  Plenty if food but could tell hash browns homemade  Would recommend place if Vegas  However considering other options above did alright  <EOR> I heard diner lots Vegas history few movies filmed here     wanted check see all fuss about   small diner inside used supermarket   easy miss diner because doesn't look much outside   menu simple diner food everything pretty affordable   ended ordering Manhattan Burger which cheese burger sourdough bread bacon   average burger nothing excited about   friend ordered open faced turkey sandwich which also pretty standard   Bottom line is okay joint average food   worth trip just say you've but don't expect much  <EOR> Breakfast Tiffany's sounds chic but really just counter diner inside drug store kinda place   love though   Chill low key no douchebags when there   Food decent cheap apparently even featured movie  <EOR> Pay attention may end pharmacy   Still amazing breakfast amazing service   Very home y  Plus say breakfast Tiffany's <EOR> Eating experience say least    My friends around 10 night only customers there  sat counter greeted right away    First thing three notice? gloves  He's wearing gloves     but fingers cut off  Finger less playtex gloves  WHAT? He cooked gloves  He washed hands those gloves  Actually 'washed' wrong word  He didn't even that    he rinsed hands    He SMOKED those gloves  Yep  Keep mind sitting counter full view back kitchen  Right cook server done cooking food   he into back kitchen area lit cigarette along some other guy think delivery driver  WHAT?!? just smokes kitchen restaurant? Super unsanitary    Food wise bleh  chicken fried steak still mission find best Vegas  pretty tasteless chewy gravy wasn't bad though  friend hot pastrami  cook took little package freezer then proceeded microwave five minutes  Threw grill minute put between couple pieces bread  other friend burger  so  Nothing special nothing bad    Would come again? if same guy cooking  Smoking kitchen?

The worst part menu said sandwich came side potato   assumed meant potato chips but meant mashed potato salad home fries  opted mashed potatoes    I expecting small side mashed potatoes nice little single serving  Nope  gave full PINT mashed potatoes  Completely ridiculous    The service uninspiring food  specifically asked when placing order if take cards  told yes but when delivery driver showed he said he's only taking cash  told when ordered said we're paying card he repeated he only taking cash    Okay then  ordering again  <EOR> Everyone loves Dirty Dive Diner!

Yes hope so!
