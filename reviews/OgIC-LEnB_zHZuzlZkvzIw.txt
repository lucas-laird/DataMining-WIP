Fresh guacamole marinated tomatoes fresh herbs creamy cheese! Loved it! fresh squeezed orange juice fantastic! <EOR> Eating probably worst decision could downtown variety reasons   My wife weekday near lunch busy   quickly placed order sat down   ordered sandwich American Breakfast some chili   Oddly American Breakfast served almost immediately while sandwich took another 3 4 minutes come finally chili another 3 4 minutes that   restaurant brings food person other sit several more minutes food?  something restaurant should do   In any case amount food very small comparison pay   $11 American Breakfast comes extra large egg two small eggs   bacon very small super thin almost entirely fat  you'd better more bacon McDonald's breakfast sandwich   top all put tiny plate unceremoniously put your toast which unbuttered no butter served! top it   Want put jam your toast still your plate?  Nope!  See picture more details   $11 complete rip off   sandwiches tad cheaper $7 $8 but come without tater tots if added them $3 order 14 normal sized tots again overpriced   The chili came sour cream some reason neither would eat it   Pretty much everything else menu actually lists comes each item but chili some reason   cashier never asked if wanted onions cheese sour cream chili but least accept former two items standard additions   writing Google search chili shows 230m results while chili sour cream  gives 229m results   Yes let's list exact ingredients bacon egg cheese sandwich bacon scrambled eggs cheddar cheese but list major components chili which happens relatively rare   Seems good idea!  Although haven't all menu items cursory look other prices menu indicates tend way high   $3 50 soda $3 bag chips bought nearby casino gift shop meaning they're already overpriced less half price?  looking other reviews least 4th person 14 reviews say food overpriced some cases outrageously priced     Now Las Vegas Club closed Golden Gate lost Dupars Mermaid's gone Plaza more captive audience ever before when comes hungry patrons but place fills absolutely no niche   Everything menu cheaper better Hash House coffee shop Zaba's Subway McDonald's  all which less 60 second walk away inside Plaza well!  Even if want standard sitdown breakfast didn't want Hash House could walk over Binions Four Queens D Downtown Grand better food more food cheaper food here   I all food options Plaza aside Brightside   Given type food serve poor service poor quality poor value can't see place lasting long unless major changes made menu prices  <EOR> Love soon walked in  Cute small quick breakfast brunch place 50's soda stop  Steps away main lobby entrance  Fits vintage classic feel Plaza  gotta take advantage jukebox  <EOR> Just left Brightside Plaza Casino ham egg cheese breakfast sandwich cherry danish followed cup Gero Nero coffee ALL GOOD   the atmosphere nice music playing highlights news flashing screens friendly staff    very good experience   definitely return  <EOR> This spot pleasant surprise   quite big very clean   felt service quite good fact way made sure compliment them   food very good   Order onion rings!  don't know them but seriously best onion rings ever had   felt prices fair being casino restaurant   returning! <EOR> This getting 1 star because 0 option  9$ meager excuse burger? 16$ anemic sandwich? garnish looked picked trash  competition fierce neighborhood least try  <EOR> I stopped quick bite allover burger  $8 plus tax does come side extra  Vegas spending money expected though $8 deal  hamburger fantastic  Buttered soft brioche bun  burger decent size cooked perfection plenty juice flavor  Even bacon crispy but over done cheese ooey cheese sling which fantastic all cheese hamburgers should be! service also fast friendly being quick order joint  superbly surprised happy yummy burger! <EOR> I say place pretty good  Really good mushroom burger really good spam egg sandwich  Oreo shake amazing  french fries good crisp  place very clean people very nice  Most importantly price very reasonable  <EOR> Brightside is  Its nothing wow but bad all   burgers actually very delicious price honestly your bang your buck! Pastrami plain soft would better served toasted some sauce  Its literally just dry bread  ! tomatoes way thick burgers way  turkey sandwich amazing but again much turkey over powers taste  staff nice friendly hope place picks ! <EOR> I officially eaten 4 times am fan  better burgers elsewhere? Sure  Might cheaper? Maybe  need remember place located casino where many folks comped prices think reflect this  really rave couple items  first bacon egg cheese  Delicious  Something home  loved old school crinkle cut fries onion rings did indeed taste homemade  also want give small shout downtown chili  Very meaty satisfying  criticism could use some Oomph  least offer packets hot sauce sriracha  found most part staff efficient friendly  heard many times slow service while believe happens personally experienced it  think fairly solid choice when Plaza particularly if Fast Food doesn't sound great  Good shakes when done thick! <EOR> Not good  Paid almost $40 2 burgers no fries piece avocado toast fountain drink bottle water  Place practically empty when took solid 30 minutes order  other couple restaurant waiting manger refund money because weren't willing keep waiting  It's Vegas  wouldn't mind price gouging long wait if food great  really bland  don't think even seasoned meat salt pepper   only took few bites decided save appetite dinner   Staff nice enough  <EOR> I anytime burger amazing  can't wrong egg burger    Brightside tons televisions projectors which unique breakfast lunch spot play lot UFC fights sporting events great alternative places Buffalo Wild Wings watch event plus its downtown game fight hang around downtown take all fun around Fremont street    I'd recommend Brightside cafe quick bite eat fun place watch sporting event  <EOR> The worst food ever had! Burgers horrible no flavor stale buns plain ketchup mayo mustard packets side no seasoning lettuce wilted tomato tasteless bun massive no flavor  only thing tasted char flat top burger cooked on  Absolutely discusting  Threw away burger only bite returned other only bite  pickle served burger only thing good wasn't anything special  Overpriced worth penny  Horrible disgusting tasteless food!!! starving would eaten anything but I'd rather starve  <EOR> Food ok nothing call home about  Service improved greatly  wouldn't back  <EOR> Rude waitress bad food  fathers day brunch blonde older woman extremely rude took half parties order then second half  food waste  <EOR> My first time here  avocado toast onion rings!

The older blonde lady glasses working register did seem happy work all  Over all employees seemed annoyed having customers   We ordered two breakfast sandwiches two Philly cheesesteaks  breakfast sandwiches pretty good served yummy brioche bread  Philly Cheesesteaks other hand disaster  just shredded steak topped very plasticky nacho cheese   As received items just prior closing didn't chance taste sandwiches until back room  disgusting didn't eat them all but rather bed hungry   The next morning ask getting money back told able because same shift  same blonde lady working called manager see could done complaint  She seemed pretty annoyed having deal situation all  No even slightest bit apologetic didn't enjoy food  server even told she really liked food couldn't understand wasn't fan cheese    We given note which allowed two more sandwiches later time during visit  back club two Italians  Both Italian sandwiches little bit dry side club pretty good    The service second visit downright rude  guess something fact really annoyed having returned two inedible sandwiches   I hope see review before decide eat because if checked reviews would forewarned  waste your money barely edible overpriced food  <EOR> We ate restaurant morning  gotten smothered southern fried chicken  dad gotten same dish mom gotten burger cheese fries  food delicious definitely dining again  Fried chicken dish way larger thought going price definitely worth it  white gravy delicious  chicken cooked perfectly crust outside seasoned amazingly  recommend it  scrambled eggs bacon top great too  <EOR>
