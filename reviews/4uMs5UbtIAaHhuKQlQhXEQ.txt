But just chicken strips  wrap nachos bad but seemed take away deliciousness simple chicken  Another note holy hell took long time meal  definition fast food  <EOR> I LOVE place  Partly because use local ingredients whenever partly because mashed potatoes french fries delish    Also must try taco salad  mine without chicken but sure tastes good both ways  <EOR> Not only food great but service amazing also  just stopped daughter snack chicken tender meal  Two tenders ton fries drink $5  food sauces awesome  Hungry?

Pros * Located conveniently inside South Premium Outlets formerly Belz * awesome soda machine over 100 flavor combinations!  * Excellent customer service   * huge portions  * Grandma's Sauce bomb!  Cons * wait bit longer your typical fast food but its made order   Tips * Try Peach flavor Sprite    Yum !  * Don't forget Grandma's sauce   must!  * specials all time just look sign counter   Verdict idea similar Cane's but all together different taste   can't decide which better   Chicken Now Chicken tenders Chicken Taco Salad Wings even Chicken Mash potato bowl   Everything tried really good   love fries service far better your typical fast food place    5 stars   don't really any complaints   little pricey but comparison Cane's pretty much same  <EOR> On way back Vegas stopped outlet some holiday shopping needless say hungry  found place cafeteria unfortunately didn't look any reviews just thought wing it   The wait food rather long missed some items order glad kept receipt since show them rest order  rather unsettling since half party already ate other half still waiting   Food wise place mediocre best if worse didn't touch mashed potato looked alien  chicken sandwich thought pairing pickles fried chicken tenders didn't really go  bread gummy soggy   We also chicken wraps which better rest food got  lettuce dipped some sauce which made sandwich slippery wet  think improved    I would avoid place if possible  most likely going negative experience even worse feel sick road  prices weren't fair quality  <EOR> This place know some damn good food!! Good quality juicy chicken  Fries r nice crispy  <EOR> It's national chain locations all over US  location food court south premium outlets  nowhere near same level Raising Cane's  breading chicken tenders thick meat dry tender  Texas toast wasn't very good either  top off 4 piece tender box just shy $10 making more expensive Raising Cane's  <EOR> I 3 piece combo 2 sides Fries = $8 29   Pros * Fries tasted half regular fries half curly fries it really yummy * Serving size fries really generous * Spicy mama sauce good! wasn't spicy but good enough   Cons * received meal 10mins ordering  sure if  fast fast food   weren't busy! * chicken decent  bredding wasn't thick but way thin  Overall food good   but average  However good chicken fix shopping outlet  <EOR> Got munchies while checking shopping mall  Counter attendant lured free sample  Seeing didn't feel fast food Asian Mexican decided give shot   The fries very crispy chicken very tasty greasy all! would probably franchise if other locations if see it   Food served quite fast  order less 5 minutes   The Coke fountain machine empty half choices drinks  There no individual order items  combo   Prices high end fast food given portion sizes  <EOR> Very nice  Prices little high  also little slow but overall pretty good place <EOR> The chicken delicious!
