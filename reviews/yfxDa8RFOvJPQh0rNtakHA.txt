Overall restaurants waiters seems somewhat clean   Food pho sliced raw beef   broth very tasty   very much enjoyed it   say comparable pho NY   tasted just good but cleaner   sounds strange but if pho pho bang ny would know mean     Service waiter attentive quick   food friends   just airport security 5 hrs flight 1 hr car rental line just want quick good food!

Well great Pho when you're late Vegas night   If keep forefront your mind enjoy forget its faults    However if taking eating establishment whole am trying right now then its shortcomings become apparent   truth Vegas does ton Pho restaurants some better tasting Pho others better service   end call Pho Kim Long average room improvement would fair saying that    back again most defiantly but understanding   <EOR> Very nice decor when inside  say trying remodel every two years  can't wrong picking restaurant if you're craving Asian food can't pick between soup noodles stir fried  variety food  All good food but seems prices food every year  service isn't consistent  come maybe every other week lunch and or dinner  Sometimes service quick point  kind rush next group people sit down though  But if wait 15 20 minutes long least let sit down enjoy food long  Other times even if business slow service slow poor  Every time gone food always comes before drink surely  drink seems always come when half way done food whether order smoothie tea specialty drink coffee  <EOR> Probably favorite place Pho  especially love place open 24 7!   It busy different times during day but service always very good considering   I always order Pho Ga pure simplicity deliciousness tried other things menu well but dish gives warm fuzzies  Imagine consuming bowl hugs dish me   Anytime right time Pho! <EOR> Before concert boyfriend brought first pho time eater  located heart Chinatown spring mountain  Parking pain but managed not there's lot space Chinatown   Walked place pretty busy 10 minute wait bad   Once seated waiter took order  flank brisket pho order combination fried rice  Since never eaten pho before boyfriend made bowl me  came plate covered greens brighten dark brothed soup  did add everything also added few dashes chili sauce kick  goodness soup uh mazing  broth hot but lava stingy meat  bowl big enough boyfriend share rice  rice nice also plenty chicken shrimp order huge    The check both rice soup drinks also under $25 wrong  Left stuffed but satisfied  few times more because no other pho joint good  only reason took off star because service very slow sometimes call someone seat take your order  understand you're busy but need become more organized  <EOR> Food usually great service usually good well    My only two issues  1  give your bill brand new American Express trays but don't accept American Express  ?  2  When boyfriend tried order pan fried noodles she said he wouldn't them because we're Asian  ? he said okay asked if he could pan fried noodles chow fun waitress still said he wouldn't because he isn't Asian highly recommended chow in  Excuse me? Just because we're white doesn't mean don't good food  <EOR> Unlike other posts haven't experienced extremely bad service establishment   mean superb but take your order when flag them down bring your food drop off your bill before ask it   spots Vegas!

What's point asking much tip want give if still write down would give  Also heard lot restaurants doing but basically calculate suggested tips against total bill tax should subtotal usually don't really care pay attention but since adamant tip amount before even ringing decided calculate YUP tip calculated taxes  ended paying 25% tip which really don't mind if service exceptional but wasn't   can't say won't back cause pho kim long vegas!! but definitely pay more attention  <EOR> EAT HERE!!!!

Really ???? She should told before she took them table   unprofessional excuse ridiculous   Not recommended anything  I don't know why google showed top 10 best pho Vegas ! <EOR> Pho Kim Long actually grown me  first wasn't very impressed but trying few different things kind come around   First let say work overnights when off 5am options extremely limited  Pho Kim Long probably healthiest option if want eat out  place always clean but service lacking  Usually person takes your order another brings drink a lot time receiving food another brings food   The food always comes random order  Sometimes Pho comes first sometimes entrees  Sometimes takes forever sometimes its quick   Because least 20 times tried lot menu but everything the menu extensive     The combination pho good best but its consistently good  no complaints   The spring rolls fresh but small  lot smaller any other place been   Some entrees we're just mediocre including Kung pao chicken mongolian beef curry chicken walnut shrimp  weren't bad just nothing stood out   One dish did stand Honey garlic pork chops  don't know if Vietnamese Chinese but some best food asian restaurant  tasty!  All all exception slow service don't any major complaints Pho Kim Long  continue just usually late night because during day feel better options  <EOR> Food SALTY using MUCH    MSG    Service BAD also ask 3 waiter just needed  Sometimes PHO came good but sometimes taste nasty well because hardly taste soup  you'll wonder if put forgot put broth it   But HATE MOST service when ordered GO  manager say over phone 45 minutes so  But when 1 HOUR  manager say YET READY WAIT ANOTHER 20 minutes them soup  DON'T KNOW IF HE PURPOSE WHAT??? And third time already did this   voice phone tell he's looked order  MANAGER HIMSEL FRONT   NASTY ATTITUDE   that won't forget  Infac t sometimes when passes saw  in front just live decided eat just don't kind service  WASTE TIME       I would give 0 ZERO even negative 1 score but wasn't here  sure they're pretty busy but  excuse disrespect customer  <EOR> I ordered Bun Bo Hue tasty  meat used different used didn't provide pork blood but still tasty  broth lot flavor although left bit greasy residue feeling tongue afterwards  Service fast attentive lots servers if need flag down someone  lunch time heard place 24 hrs review during time  Overall good place anyone craving Vietnamese food Las Vegas area  <EOR> This place good food but pricey knowing other Pho Joints less cheaper   Customer service completely bad local coming place long time  all times would toss your food across table more sliding roughly caring customer  Employees seem job  Fingers touching food while serving you  Other food good way since place running 24 hours   1 star just horrible customer service   Hope place improves customer service   I'll back! <EOR> The broth perfectly balanced just enough cilantro thai basil lime   noodles fresh greasy   leave feeling comforted less hungover    OH PHO SURE best   However bathrooms basically hell Earth but   just hold wait back hotel     It's worth cab ride but getting back hard   so we're going take next time!! <EOR> This review based order while restaurant   SERVICE 1 2     EFFORT? FOOD 3  I excited try place since always see restaurant packed  guess those places where food decent but service lacking take time  friend walk counter greeted hostess  wanted order she took order said would take 15 20 minutes  Sure Sunday evening restaurant wasn't full but getting there  9 10pm    9 40pm rolls around  seen other people ordered orders fulfilled  walk counter further where register talk guy behind register clearly prepping orders picking phone orders  He says order isn't He can't find it  clarified hostess took down order over half hour ago he calls over she says something Vietnamese tone she admitted she totally forgot  STRIKE 1  He apologizes takes order  which repeated once friend second time just sure he it said would 10 15 minutes  Fine paid wait again    He walks over hand food himself again apologizing  feel better even though really hungry felt he knew deserved better service  then check food there's order missing missing side rice  Checked bag couldn't find order receipt  approach he says didn't order claim missing  He prints order receipt shows us  Clearly he didn't add them in  STRIKE 2  another payment   It really hard enjoy food dealing kind service but time hungry ate whole thing  Food decent but can't say great  effort give restaurant another chance hopefully follow more positive review Strike 3  Nonetheless very disappointing night  <EOR> Ate pho here   pho dac biet   it okay   flavorful pho other places   Big restaurant though good large groups  <EOR> Decent pho place always crowded but line moving fast   Good salt pepper chicken wings   Service wasn't great but then extremely busy can't fault them that   Best part open 24 7 <EOR> This place always super packed   place came recommended all local Asian Vietnamese people asked   wait looked lot worse actually seated within 15 minutes   Coming California where Pho aplenty think did great job   Although best pho life definitely above average book   also ordered grilled pork chop rice plate which decent would say pretty average   Overall good Vietnamese place if you're craving Las Vegas!   Also if haven't tried iced Vietnamese coffee favorites Vietnamese restaurant  <EOR> Pretty wonderful Vietnamese food   Place packed busy but service quick food very good   pho spring egg rolls pork chop rice vermicelli etc   Everything tasted great!  Coming back again if long trip Vegas crave something over hotel food  <EOR> nothing cures hangover good bowl pho! most definitely surprised find good pho vegas all places   fairly large party separated into two tables  group actually showed little later but accommodated quickly considering busy weekend lunch hour  also able seat fairly close   in addition pho also serve many other vietnamese rice noodle dishes  also ordered chicken wings appetizer  lucky portions super filling chicken wings ended great hours snack back hotel room   they also super size which seriously humongous!

breaking point but friends persuaded let them go    Other nuisances Some people table ate before  always pickled onions  time when asked them waiters claimed restaurant never them  Liars  cousin asked if different sizes said No  Later he found friend able order small  Liars   I reside Little Saigon California  All say food mediocre price offered around $6 8   delicious bowl pho could sell $4 large   As result mediocre food  little bit pricey compared other pho places disgraceful service just tops all being BLACKLISTED list Restaurants Aren't Worth It  <EOR> We used look forward having dinner when town but last night disappointing  All meals but brought don't know happened but when asked appears kitchen tried rush dish which ended being gooey under cooked seafood  food used good but everyone  group said food just good last night  <EOR> Food decent always come extremely timely manner  best part they're open 24 hours always satisfy your midnight drunk cravings    It gets 3 star because service usually attentive  business done attitude  Order want food gets brought pretty much all service get  <EOR> Huge fan chicken fried rice   Great service 24 hours  Should rated 6 stars  <EOR> No customer service just walked away didn't ask we'd drink  brown rice came friend finished first plate order  No refills water  bestfriend didn't leave any tip  guy took money order came back demanded tip    I no longer customer highly suggest everyone enjoy dinner else where  <EOR> The prices pho standard but other dishes twice much places Chinatown   pho broth wasn't shabby give average amount meat   also enjoyed shrimp spring rolls   shrimp fresh wrapper just right consistency peanut dipping sauce perfect   think Viet Noodle Bar slightly better pho also oxtail pho which hard find   would also try pho district little more flavorful lobster pho surf turf steak lobster pho  <EOR> This spot late night meals when rental car cruise over Spring Mountain   probably tried all here   Pho entrees congee   never bad experience    Love getting spring rolls w lettuce wraps   sure why more don't serve w o having ask   It's convenient open all time hits spot  <EOR> The service god awful  waiter rude ignored entire time there  When bill came waiter asked if wanted give 18% tip 20% tip  kind waiter asks especially horrible service  food decent add enough siracha you'll through meal ok  Needless say won't back  <EOR> This place SHIZ NIT!! open 24 hours those late night Pho cravings but also all types family style dishes roasted duck saute shrimp chicken rice plates etc   perfect spot satisfy those late night hunger probs long night clubbing Hakkasan Marquee Tao   EAT  SLEEP  RAVE  REPEAT <EOR> Aside interesting name isn't much else reason come here  food pretty average  comes quick service nice  Cheap food option outside strip  <EOR> Went last night couple friends first time while because craving pho   fairly busy early Saturday morning   sat pretty quickly which nice happy such quick turnover tables   The food consistently good every time come here   Today dish usually order pork chop w baked egg extra delicious!  special salt pepper eggplant pretty good well   The only reason took away star because forgot drink order when asked utensils also forgot bring some by   didn't check all food dropped off counter check   But all all still great late night place your Asian food fix night clubbing work! <EOR> Best Pho found Vegas far!  The broth superb although selection Pho isn't big most other places  usually Pho Dac Biet anywhere love tendon tripe but place only rare steak brisket flank  put lot meat which + book but noodles broth made me    Especially being Vegas might save  your life morning long night  leaving Pho Kim Long felt new ready take whatever vegas left throw me  back place again thats sure  <EOR> Starting wonder if there's anything place cant do    My cousin told crayfish place next kim long he wanted try out  Once parked car looked sign realized wasnt next kim long   it's kim long   we both split 3 pounds crayfish came two bowls guessing pound half each  Nicely spiced but HEAVY garlic which good thing guess  Some seasonings bit heavy side but swig corona fixes real nice    Only down side when served bowls weren't steaming hot just warm but could considered plus cause didn't burn ourselves    Just personal thing but i'd more sausage potato chunks bite into every once while there's enough bowl happy  <EOR> A few friends hung over decided try restaurant because name because good recommendation mutual friend   Service wasn't best  quality food alright  cleanliness little better average since most Asian restaurants pho restaurants aren't clean begin     There hit misses when came food  beef stew rice noodle made very well but two friends' foods looked tasted bad  waiter give suggestions think those usually most popular freshes specialty things restaurant known for  Order that   I heard place best late night hangover Pho fix  honest If traveling vacation looking good eats I'd rather fork over few extra dollars enjoy good buffet strip  <EOR> Came late night pho  Opened til 5am  pretty packed when group came  Server pretty accommodating fast  ordered ate paid timely manner  generous enough split check not sure if usually   Price around $8 Pho  called cab afterwards  <EOR> Great food though think servers should taught serving cleanliness    ! <EOR> The best pho vegas far tried 2 other spots before did live standards  However think everyone else knows those days clubbing when you're finally able roll bed your hunger finally outweighs your need lay bed think man need some pho best luck wait situation  If you're lucky happens short luck! But seen wait through 45 minutes before well  Longest 45 minutes if already barely state crawling bed  restaurant pretty big lots tables service fast just many ppl want some    PHO broth very well made pretty much defining difference between pho restaurants pho kim long near top list  don't when place don't rinse starch off noodles broth cloudy none here  Good portions noodle meat yes! Also no crazy obvious msg taste baby! Path recovering hard again!  I used take good pho granted but having experienced some bad ones lately really appreciate those stay true craft!   LOCATION If staying around wynn venetian side strip just right across spring mountain few blocks chinatown far drive some tasty vietnamese beef broth your system  <EOR> Terrible!  restaurant before wasn't ever bad service   We're Las Vegas when feel Vietnamese food thought would same thing time   Big mistake waste money! First off wait hour long which problem but young lady charge process overwhelmed doesn't seem organized   While she seats people new customers walking door just grabbing sign in sheet own writing name absolutely no organized fashion   People top each other  Next food took some time out   Second didn't refill water   Third when bill charged steamed rice $6! dishes should come rice  Why would charge extra rice if dishes come rice??  nickel dime ing everything   Fourth when gave credit card pay bill waiter asked much tip should add here? What??  does that??  Shouldn't tips optional customer much want add  AT DISCRETION???  feeling cornered said 15% fine   When credit card receipt back sign waiter rounded 15% into whole dollar   HE TOOK UPON HIMSELF WRITE TIP rounding up!  worse service ever feel want charge every little thing possible money   Needless say we're coming back   If zero star would put that  <EOR> The Pho fresh but sure would try extra hard return  little Cheesecake Factory Asian food because all menu choices Average food service   But very good side note  its open 24 HOURS!   I could see might work its way into being best drunk food all time  <EOR> If eating pho since before trendy spot  broth point noodles always perfect  always consistent service decent  never tried any dish except pho but why would you? pho resteraunt   Cruising Lee's sandwich way brings back Tully Road  If know am talking then eat here  <EOR> Ordered Drunken Noodles chicken delicious good peanut flavor could use little more basil flavor  Overall would order dish again!   Salt Pepper chicken wings sweet cinnamon flavor garlic good  would order again    Vietnamese Coffee delish but much ice wanted more much ice left 1 2 cup      Fresh coconut drink cold fresh      Overall well come back try additional menu items! <EOR> The only thing long night partying some good warm food!

One thing little disappointed added $1 meal because asked beef slices side  know some other places but doesn't mean cool so   Overall place really hit spot I'd back  <EOR> This used favorite pho spot Vegas   Some days tire endless buffets rich greasy foods just want some nice comfort food    Pho Kim Long yes name turns all into giggly 12 year olds place me     However recent visit noticed remodeled redecorated prices really inflated now   bowl pho used no more 7 dollars but now bowls noodles over 10 dollars   think trying reach into non asian market something trying more upscale   Bah!  Their food greatest compared LA standards but pretty darn good considering few choices select from     I would given 5 stats but took 1 away unconscionable pho prices  <EOR> A Las Vegas Standard Vientaminse cuisine!

First all spring rolls extremely small compared other Vietnamese restaurants rice paper hard difficult chew if sitting long time waiting served  spring rolls definitely weren't fresh  Second all broth pho wasn't very hot  just warm  Third all shrimp fried rice extremely bland  wasn't much flavor all  Somebody pass soy sauce!  As eating pho started remember why enjoyed previous visit here  came cousins 3 morning long day getting crazy Life Beautiful  course anything tastes good when you've your feet all day you're intoxicated half asleep right? Needless say food just okay really satisfactory  quality isn't there   Straight customer service terrible     being nice  servers aren't attentive took few tries waiter's attention  asked them some extra lime he walking away caught rolling eyes  course he never came back ask someone else  definitely understaffed amount customers had!

The three people pho said much MSG stomach felt funny afterwards   Auntie Bev pan fried noodles seafood she said dish didn't much flavor   The last few times came because only place opened 2 AM didn't set any expectation   How did named best restaurant Las Vegas?  would never know    <EOR> Honestly don't know if place actually good thought was   But!  night drunken debauchery Vegas coming finishing your night off bowl pho while struggle keep yourself wobbling off chair   it hits spot   remember drunk self thought pho pretty damn bomb  <EOR> I'm originally Washington but made trip Las Vegas celebrate 21st sister friend recommended Pho Kim Long @ 4 AM AMAZING  broth refreshing yummy! tried stop again before came back WA but packed!!

Can't them they're just delicious  customer six half years now probably visited restaurant more 80 times  Highly recommend springs rolls which bit over priced but tasty worth extra few dollars $$ fried egg rolls lettuce wraps combination pho! other selections aren't just Vietnamese cuisine but Chinese Thai Korean Japanese very little but still present    Their prices increased over years but taste still gives them huge reputation have  Sometimes visits vary bit them when comes service they're really awesome friendly they're lifeless non attentive  Asides suggest give place visit decide whether Pho Kim Long lives name  <EOR> Every time anyone party craving asian food Vegas head straight here! far best Asian restaurant Chinatown just automatically come now    The wait ALWAYS pain ass because always freakin' packed!! But wait's worth it  redecorated since last time looks mini jungle near windows  lol always very loud place    Service typical any busy Asian restaurant don't specific waiter ask anyone come service  haha   Their food delish  sweet sour soup which pineapples beansprouts catfish more  Yum  hainam chicken okay but big portion  stir fried veggies cooked just right  also something called  ca kho which catfish simmered some kind sauce    don't know world sauce made but addicting! Mix rice nom away    Their pho pretty good although forgot much was  lot places attempt pho but never succeed  Luckily place does does well    What didn't know charge each person rice  first kind miffed many place don't but realized very reasonable considering many people don't finish whole thing waste ton it    Wait line try it! such great representation Asian food must tempted now    Go! now 24 hours all night people P <EOR> The food best services any other Asian restaurant good any other restaurants too  man checked rude unprofessional when came check he did ask see if everything's ok only word he ask want add gratuity bill said no myself he gave nasty attitude   back there's plenty other VN restaurants around   <EOR> I ordered first time place     Big mistake!!! Fried rice raw pieces chicken    asked extra green onions no vegetables  frozen peas n carrots but no green onions  something orange don't know was  orange chicken worst ever tasted  Beef chow fun borderline blah    Omg  $55  crap!

My parents order Kim Long's more popular dishes  Canh chua sour soup ca kho do braised fish clay pot    The soup sour expected fish tasted fresh clean good The fish clay pot overly seasoned oyster sauce wasn't fan   Service mediocre  Basic viet service people weren't viet    ?  Overall disappointed Kim Long  Sorry  <EOR> The pho surprisingly more decent expected considering they're only 24 hour option could find  earned review star  Service crap sitting maybe 30 seconds before server asked if ready  Food VERY quick which great but worries same time if know mean  sip Thai tea immediately could tell old didn't bother rest  When mentioned tea thought server acknowledged said but bill suggested otherwise  those last resort options go figure 24 hour joint only come back if forced  <EOR> this prob best looking pho place ive ever to  driving asian side vegas notice HUGE banner being rated best pho ever whatever said  HONEST  hyped way much just didnt live behemoth banner   when walk into place notice waiting list right tells youre good enough but doesnt hype giant banner  lol  the pho okay broth didnt taste bad just wasnt best ive had  wasnt much noodle proportioned wrong  meat broth noodle ratio off left dissatisfied  bill cheap 7 people guess thats okay   this place really clean staff any other place no service all expect that  <EOR> Not recommended place    service suck food trash    stay away if want happy vacation  lot restaurants nice service good food why need come place bad attitude trash food suck people !

Yes   would just order Bun Bo Hue try Pho next trip  <EOR> Food good server lady friendly nice  But guy greeted rude very uncomfortable talk to  would give 4 5 stars if guy nice customers  Replace guy! <EOR> After long night only place think Pho Kim Long   The only thing think Pho    Its probably hangover but place really good location  first time having thought would ok  But would fix before heading back home crazy weekend  But besides place 24 hours service food expedite! Must check out! <EOR> My absolute favorite restaurant Vegas  tried everywhere else nothing comes close  <EOR> Came very late night long hours work  Four stars Pho which very good though flavor strong authentic places LA New York  star service  Server little rude took until almost end meal bring drinks  mango smoothie thinking would actual mango but no  sickly sweet very artificial tasting couldn't even drink but also couldn't find server send back ended paying even though didn't drink it  server disappeared hurriedly dropping off drinks 45 minutes done eating obviously waiting finally able flag down another server bring check  might back because Pho tasty open late but hopefully service better normal dinner hours  great first experience  <EOR> My friends ate two nights row long night clubs lol  love open 24 hours which main reason why ate here  sure other groups all night same reason  plenty seats didn't need wait long seated   Both nights came pho briskets it  think #15? double check  portion wasn't big more meat noodles first time came which fine but someone likes equal ratios meat noodles  pretty good but just general don't water Las Vegas which didn't best pho always feel queasy when drink water outside where live but did its job feeding me   Overall pretty good service food came fast dishes itself pretty good  would still come again next time Las Vegas  Hopefully won't feel bad drinking Vegas water next time  <EOR> The wait long wait staff not all rude   Food very flavorful vermicelli pork horrendous   pork chewy bland   wife ordered pho which broth good   Spring rolls nothing but noodles dipping sauce sour   Better places eat elsewhere!

Host doesn't notice won't seat unless you're larger group  He also extremely rude when pointed he's walked past several times stood front without even looking us  walk say Party 2 right face realize standing trying seated  middle night when wasn't very busy  party 5 front which he attentive and having nice long conversation all bathroom boyfriend only 2 standing there  Instead kindly apologizing realizing mistake trying experience better he extremely rude situation  Because walked door took business elsewhere    If you're going attentive people walking door you're going rude shouldn't working front where  first thing people see    I know past experiences don't just server your waiter anyone catch attention which isn't very easy unless you're part larger group  I think waiters waitresses all share tips them care service they're giving  <EOR> This fav place pho besides Pho Saigon 8! perfect here!

Traditionally dish always stronger herbs mix but still didn't break meal! I'd still recommend try if haven't before   3 stars but extra star quick service is  <EOR> I'm leaning more towards 3 Star rating but pho itself good deserves extra star  eating years steady decline customer service  hadn't visited several months because restaurant become popular wait times long  Last night Friday 7 pm more half tables available  Yet server kept rushing table without much eye contact  noticed all other servers treating other patrons same way   We ordered favorite app calamari  over breaded almost comical  lot bites took didn't even squid it   But onto main event  pho still best town  flavors broth deep intense  noodles comforting  rare steak brisket tender  enough keep coming back even though service great  <EOR> By far tastiest beef stew egg noodle among all pho places eaten at   summer roll average but bad  Quick service clean   looks kind hidden outside night because curtains drawn   Overall every good eats  <EOR> I food poisoning ordered some vegan pho feel better  pho broth flavorless but liked array vegetables pho  <EOR> this actually second time eaten each experience wonderful fast friendly service food comes very quickly very hot! chicken egg rolls which absolutely delicious shared small combo pho only thing missing sauces table but very friendly table next willing share very pleasant experience indeed  Very nice ambiance beautiful art work all around <EOR> This place open 24hrs!? came lunch  Superrr hungover  usual pho place randomly closed!

Rare Beef Pho eggrolls chicken fried rice    all delicious  prepfer spicey everything always sauces doctor your food with! Yum!

No greeting waiter just ready order?  No but hot tea water  ok back he comes backs felt needed ready point ordered food being served within minutes    plus fast food minus somewhat unregarded service   I very tame but oh good Charbroiled Pork Egg Roll Rice Vermicelli a cool salad perfect 112 degree weather evening boy having hot summer! pork perfectly done chared perfection egg rolls also perfectly done but can't really mess right salad fresh sauce good usual however noodles stuck together really hard apart eat mix into rest dish   think sad casualty really big really busy place point    I am totally ok hardcore asian waiters restaurants but place TONS young hip many races no longer excuse old school chinese restaurant    want your favorite places busy but busy lose touch them busy begin with     So am giving stars food taking away stuck together noodles taking away well kind crappy service front wait staff   back write next experience   hope place find happy medium making big bucks but remembering why making those big bucks from    <EOR> Yayy pho long weekend partying! don't think ever gone vegas come way back home  food good!

To sum up   it's pricey bland made tourist  would only come late nite 2am Pho craving   but then again other 24 hour pho places too  bells whistles nice but if don't taste food back just worth it    I saying restaurant name long slow though   tickles every time! <EOR> Come name stay pho   pleasently surprised FHL   I mean PKL   first refused come based solely name but girlfriend's cousin local swore down best Pho town relented     Surely better any Pho DC though curiously best pho ever home town Syracuse NY most cosmopolitan place know   Maybe am only rating high because totally all expectations maybe better places Vegas but say throughly recommend Pho Kim Long  <EOR> Terrible customers service audacity asked least 15% bill   good always mediocre waiters attentive all   when register pay cashier asked if leave any tips table yet? said no going leave tip here he said ok much want leave give option 15 18 21%  said can't just give amount feel service deserve?

Quick tip cell eating place super sub par! sad! chicken pho @ first glance lacked EVERYTHING  guess l spoiled living Orange County California quality fresh cheap authentic pho every corner   They skimped ALL veggies especially scallions culantro thai basil white onion  Broth below average  least option choose big rice noodles requested it  measly dry chicken BITS floating around murky water  other places when order chicken pho questions waiter would ask but place didn't bowl size? noodle size? White dark meat? Do want chicken skin your meat? Do want gizzards? Liver Coagulated blood heart eggs etc  HOISIN SAUCE!!! Watered down much? runny light brown extra salty like teriyaki sauce! even manage eff too? Wow     Opt elsewhere please  made mistake choosing place because later some driving around saw plenty other pho restaurants same street  Cheaper albeit  Darnit we originally supposed eat @ Kinh because supposedly better reviews    <EOR> Surprisingly Las Vegas many Pho restaurants few   But place Kim Long still favorite   restaurant located Chinatown area Spring Mountain   does very crowded busy during lunch hours parking tough sometimes   Expect wait when come during lunch hours   full menu dishes including rice bun chow fun   But always order pho every time come   broth tasty super hot just way it    service sometimes slow lacking because busy   take major credit cards including Mastercard Visa Discover but American Express   Anyways when Vegas need Pho fix place go  <EOR> Look idc anyone says  place cure when you're drunk lit AF coming back dayclub nightclubs want food your mouth asap  service could little better BUT them being 24hr restaurant they're  pretty good  take your order quickly if order pho within 5 10 minutes max within ordering  GREAAAAT! order mix things when go  calamari bomb esp since love garlic top off generous amount fried garlic  literally put leftover seasoning rice  Egg rolls decent but when you're drunk they're really bomb haha  Sometimes combo pho which pretty good feel some places broth greasy but theirs isn't pretty clear broth which perfect should be  say favorite dish charbroiled porkchops steamed rice  always ask no bones cause hate cutting meat when bone in  flavorful liiiiive shallots green onions put top cause seriously compliments meat  need soy sauce your rice talking people put soy sauce EVERYTHING since pork chops really well seasoned  Great place lunch dinner breakfast whatever! 24hrs your Vietnamese food fix anytime Welcome Vegas <EOR> Great pho!

Though time took them 20 minutes take order ready  meh <EOR> Best late night place eat night partying whatevers   Good food nuff said  <EOR> Just into Vegas lookimg grrat PHO  Found here  Great service great food  <EOR> You would think place would Mecca late night grubbing Chinatown but sadly place really isn't good  food quality isn't really best whole experience just subpar   The people working hostess waiter surly gave attitude when seating taking order  wasn't really busy inside because think everything little slower Vegas during time year people going back home vacations school year starting etc    feel any dining establishment staff should least try little friendly     case here   Anyway onto food  friend ordered crab rangoons shrimp udon dish shrimp fried rice   When crab rangoons came table initial thought THOSE?! because didn't look conventional flower shaped rangoons all mostly familiar with  looked made rush but least retained cheesy crab flavored filling  Fried golden brown good appetizer start off with   The shrimp udon dish basically filler loads green onions bean sprouts few sizeable shrimp  noodles which should main part dish lacking  presentation wasn't appealing either  literally looked stirred thrown onto plate table     The shrimp fried rice probably only thing really enjoyed everything ordered  shrimp seemed smaller dish compared shrimp udon even smaller sized shrimp still sparing  Sriracha sauce perfect thing drizzle top fried rice can't enough unique spiciness offers!  Anyway if we're talking food quality presentation then Pho Kim Long same league any average Asian take out place    which isn't saying much  Pho Kim Long misses mark many things friendly staff decent food presentation said food cleanliness etc    Overall did enjoyable experience  think maybe alright if you're hot mess express 3 AM want something eat late hours night early morning but even BIG maybe me    Save your appetite something better  <EOR> YUM!  Clean   Good   more ask when comes pho? <EOR> Have couple times when Vegas   Sure Pho best hangover food but personally think they're bit pricey side broth isn't special  offer lot more different kinds food other Vietnamese food though   However service HORRIBLE  People always say oh yeah shouldn't expect good services Asian restaurants oh yeah worse service better food is! No just no  ask them many times them bring waters came wrong food server very impatient when ordered when food came just quickly put food down anywhere table move food ourselves    Meh  Also there's always long line  Unless really want Pho can't wait till back LA probably won't come again  <EOR> This place 2 u've drinking dancing all nite long    glad they're open til wee hours! very clean place but food great! pho tai grilled porkchops rice  food always comes fast u're n quickly just time  <EOR> It's no secret pho best hangover food  doesn't crave it? when you're partying Las Vegas nice able short distance some pho  strip there's pho place TI but $15 good  isn't far strip pretty perfectly located   I wouldn't say best pho anything that  But pho $8 bowl  Sounds similar prices home San Francisco me    The place clean looks pretty modern style  Lots tables but wait during lunch time  But only waited 10 minutes Monday afternoon which isn't bad    By way say name Pho Kim Long fast see if name really <EOR> Great food!!!

Whoo Hoo! <EOR> I am pho natic! love steamy broth rice noodles scallions cilanto bean sprouts meat choices  being said tried other vietnamese food restaurants some broths overpowering   I happened upon Pho Kim Long driving Spring Mountain Chinatown area decided give try  We greeted usually immediately seated table given menus  floorspace open mix 4top tables larger round family size tables  quickly brought water while look menu  We normally order pho tai rare steak slices quickly cook hot broth pho tai nam rare steak well done flank along chinese broccoli garlic  averages taking 5 10 minutes soup few minutes more broccoli   Fruit smoothies tapioca available well fresh coconut drinks soda juices asian style beverages  menu extensive various dishes noodles rice beef seafood chicken vegetarian entrees  spring rolls fresh tasy! come often need branch menu! <EOR> i 9 30pm but seat 3 people 5 minutes  waiters very friendly  food came really quick  found pho pretty good but noodles little cooked but its fine  sister's pad thai amazing though tasted vietnamese style which like  <EOR> I'll start off saying love Pho Kim Long! you're probably thinking well your two star rating doesn't really indicate   doesn't  love pho food general  great! pho few other places just same  also love place open 24 hours maybe close some point but pretty sure ended past two a m chicken pad thai pretty freaking bad ass too!   So reason two star rating because pretty crappy customer service place  rate food establishments based few standards    quality food cleanliness customer service! Quality food gets A+ however other two categories fail miserably  plenty times which gives place lot chances improve customer service just don't!   One time wait forever which usually expect if you're going weekend anytime during dinner rush waiter just generally unpleasant  Nothing specific just bad attitude  most recent visit waitress brought over water said she'd give few minutes which happened maybe twenty minutes I'm indecisive but don't need twenty whole minutes choose dinner   water very tiny bug which really didn't think huge deal  don't grossed easily just asked another one  really kind thinking calm casually waiter reacted it  He just nonchalantly said Oh sorry  bring another quietly walked away bug infested water  worst part  While still enjoying pho chatting girlfriend asked TWICE if finished food almost plate taken away if didn't respond fast enough! deal breaker me  take time when eat especially if having good company good conversation  really irked me  felt rushed uncomfortable  wasn't asked if wanted box leftover food didn't really want but feel servers should always ask specially if there's lot food left plate   There's other occasions which just refuse accommodate simple request just show absolutely no enthusiasm  Lame!  So conclusion if want good pho shitty customer service  spot! <EOR> They're alright  Food kind pricy compared better Vietnamese restaurants better food quality  cheap but nearest spots Vietnamese food if you're Vegas  always packed  <EOR> There's always wait but its definitely worth it!!  Food comes almost immediately order  Service okay servers really don't stop by but food WOW !! <EOR> I'm sure Pad Thai Noodles normally comes but asked no meat instead just having noodles peanuts green onions bean sprouts most Thai restaurants Pad Thai few undesired surprises  spent next 10 minutes picking broccoli bamboo shoots bok choy noodles  much took more half plate  Again never Pad Thai Vietnamese restaurant don't know if normal but quite annoying  flavor overall meh  probably won't back  <EOR> Hubby 2am most amazing selection food  started Spicy Calamari which fresh flavorful  shared order Basil Clams Spring Rolls    unique presentation taste   Simply explosion yummy your mouth! finished meal w famous Pho Soup w Stake Shrimp highlight meal  tried house sake enjoyed both bottles All around great time excellent food!
