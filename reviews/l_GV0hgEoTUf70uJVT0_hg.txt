Also highly doubt hair plate waitress ignored writer  More likely writer disgruntled something food restaurant then plucked hair wrote crappy review     Most Americans consume food seasoned salt in many cases MSG pre made sauces fast food sugar  EAT  food fresh scratch which also some comments moot points me  example see review critique Hollandaise sauce bacon  Likely bold flavors she describes comes package fresh cream real bacon that hasn't treated ton nitrates   also comment banana bottom Mexican food goodness  likely writer mistook different Latin American inspired dish perhaps El Salvador where cuisine uses plantains Mexican food  Because duh all Americans know Mexican food but much else terms different Latin American national foods   If she would tasted said banana she might discovered delicious! And discovered new national cuisine   Many bad reviews proof there's lot food food anymore  suspect some readers don't recognize or don't palate for real food anymore  short take some reviews grain salt look website listen Bourdain's review  <EOR> Tried because all awesome reviews  right  place really really good  Nothing tried average bad just yummy    Careful if walk though walked past few folks partied hard before didn't home  Semi sketchy part town but Vegas so     <EOR> When heard place beignets completely sold  craving beignets long you'd think would more places serve them! Anyway came Friday morning parking difficult find  just street parking bring quarters meter  place wasn't busy plenty open tables but still waited close 10 min    Food wise beignets start  When came smaller expected  They're also denser but still quite good  reminded sugar doughnut hole  best part them seasonal jam vanilla scented mascarpone dipping sauces  put much those eating dipping sauces side beignet    For rest meal 2 others joining Two Eggs any style smashed potatoes while tried Chilaquiles  Two Eggs any style nothing write home about  exactly described two eggs any style slice bacon bread some potatoes  smashed potatoes just cubed potatoes some seasoning which bit lacking  all thought overpriced since nothing particularly outstanding  Chilaquiles pretty tasty essentially scrambled eggs tomatoes peppers over tortilla chips sort breakfast nachos  But chicken sausage sitting top bit sweet dish just stood much    The staff fairly friendly however waitress brought check exactly rude but she some attitude when holding check us  She didn't say anything but body language she looked annoyed no reason    Overall place alright  decent breakfast spot but don't think there's much actually crave  <EOR> So yummy chicken fried steak second none!

Its fantastic  Your waistline complain first but just tell hush because its worth it     For brunch truffled egg sandwich gf huevos motulenos  Both really good  banana huevos motulenos little weird first but couple bites sweetness banana balanced dish well  egg sandwich good but kinda plain  basically egg bacon mushroom most which isn't bad thing  thinking whole time eating could use some salt but wasn't until end sandwich taste feta  tang really made sandwich  guess someone just forgot put throughout because certainly chef intended taste   Pro tip coffee awesome nutty smooth Super pro tip towners street parking 7th street free sundays yet probably see sign tells pay accident   Solid food but blow away best gets solid 4 stars  <EOR> The food very good service great  Very busy lunch love atmosphere  Easy find street parking nearby right corner Carson 7th  <EOR> This place seemed recommended healthy spot downtown  Parking difficult felt creepy walking neighborhood people apartments eyeing me   The people very attentive nice even though lunch rush pretty crowded  Took order efficiently brought amount time said would take due parking rush doing takeout two sandwiches  veggie burger  burger good avocado top but oh couldn't find underneath all bread quite messy took most bread off  He roast beef he liked but again much meat salad components seemed  Gave potato salad he said wasn't mayo but sure was    Ranch based? He did potato chips   If put veggie burger thinner bread said wheat but didn't look wheat more meat would better  Glad tried would if group going breakfast options but somewhere would seek out  <EOR> Great little place brunch lunch  super busy weekends but good reason  Their grilled cheese tomato soup simple but die for  bread literally melts your mouth  also Huevos Motulenos which okay  Service always good  love see open kitchen seating area well  If going brunch aware serve alcohol mimosas morning option here  The owner chef Natalie Young fantastic opening another restaurant downtown  Can't wait! spot overseeing work kitchen just hanging bench outside  dining much more personal! <EOR> Cute place great service  Loved cinnamon biscuits! also breakfast sandwich but bit greasy liking  food fresh high quality vibe great  Looking forward going back  <EOR> Worst service ever! Walked 2 28 would even seat party 7  3 different hosts very rude explained close whenever even though time 3pm shown everywhere Friday  Very disappointed such waste time such rudeness 3 different members staff  local coming back ever again! <EOR> Very very disappointed    going eat ever since open food amazing service great place very clean   stop going six months ago mainly cause felt food quality nos good   ordered some pancakes which favorite dish but time tasted stale cold left very disappointed  Today stoped restaura again decided give more try     awful starters waiter very nice wife ordered milk kids she asked if chance warm Gary waiter look most outrageous ever ask over all demeanor just condescending very nice   ordered few things pancakes corn beef hash two eggs potatoes toast   corn beef hash average flavored pancakes burned   top off take son restroom very dirty   very disappointed returning place again   sad writing review mainly because really loved place represented what's going down town Las Vegas recommended many people place   bad  <EOR> We came party 11  over 100 degrees outside while waiting party walk requested round water ready table but girl cleaning told counter small bottles  sure why but okay    The menu small selection   tried cinnamon biscuits chicken fried steak corned beef hash killer grilled cheese argulla salad And more   But none outstanding me  all shared since first time  Food okay  would've given solid 3    However found piece hair food spoke front server she literally right next us but nope   totally did hear avoided us <EOR> New Vegas exploring Container Park when told local eat  We're beyond happy she did! Great feel environment restaurant  Best Iced Tea ever both loved lunches  Reuben wife grilled cheese tomato soup  If you're area     GO! <EOR> You want unique cuisine hip place Vegas come Eat  food honestly different am educated enough culinary arts describe it  However am pretty good guessing when some food strange many place  prepared fun place try some food may never before love it  Then step enjoy Downtown Las Vegas! <EOR> Great staff warm welcoming food fresh came quick   can't really complain   <EOR> Always fresh great   prepared wait all patrons your party present won't sat down  <EOR> Eat solid three star brunch joint  enjoyed meal here   mostly good spot   Anyone reading seeing 3 stars thinking bad review not! But several issues during meal made place miss 4 star level   One place excel pancake  thick fluffy while still being crispy outside  rarely order pancakes but two bites hooked   homemade tomato soup quite good large thin chunks parmesan floating top  Also coffee served excellent   We also tried truffled egg sandwich  seen other reviewers rave but something missing  bread wasn't good flavors ingredients didn't meld well together    The service lacking   seems focused turnover rather true customer interaction  server asked five times if ready order   Once finished three different people asked if wanted check   weren't checked single time while dining    Lastly name kind dumb Hey want eat?  Sure thinking?  eat?      I know place  No   the restaurant downtown called eat silly      Bottom Line fine brunch lunch spot certainly better lot other Las Vegas spot  serve brunch daily which really nice if visiting everyday seems Saturday   Maybe off day but place already good potential better  <EOR> Had breakfast again 9 17 16   Again delicious   time around corned beef hash eggs   different other corned beef had    but good   Still deviled eggs star place   Service fast efficient   favorite when town  <EOR> From 2 23 16 Came Eat some late breakfast some grease soak hangovers  second time coming wasn't able check though since phone died but loved first time around knew would disappoint   We ordered food grilled cheese sandwich tomatoes bacon  Let just say tomatoes soup freaking amazing! flavorful perfect consistency  grilled cheese sandwich colossal couldn't finish but delicious   The service good back next time downtown  <EOR> Great place!  daughter took lunch   Good food great service friendly staff! <EOR> Had breakfast Sunday while visiting Las Vegas  chef's special eggs Benedict which off menu  He said delicious although hollandaise just little bit lemony  ordered Huevos Montulenos  based Yelp reviews  really couldn't imagine caramelized bananas peas same egg dish but somehow works! works mean wow   Great house potatoes accompanied both dishes  coffee dark powerful atmosphere urban energetic  Great attentive wait staff too  <EOR> So happy Yelp here  Off Strip downtown Vegas  Great prompt service clean really cool vibe    Deviled eggs something new battered deep fried  could only finish one half bit still loved them    The truffle egg sandwich HUGE shareable  Truffle oil brushed bread tasty but otherwise filing inside nothing especially creative  <EOR> honestly think place all hype  WASN'T impressed all  service crap  server took order saying ready? didn't even greet introduce himself  even food he barely checked just casual good? when he walked by  he didn't even ask if ready check he just placed table if he ready leave    the food just alright nothing mind blowing  ordered cinnamon biscuits shrimp grits shrimp po boy    I don't think coming back any time soon sorry eat  <EOR> This place great   bit pricey but food very good   deviled eggs appetizer amazing   definitely visit again future trip  <EOR> The food absolutely incredible portion taste!!

Visited July 13 2016 1 30 2 30 pm  <EOR> had breakfast super cute space portions crazy big   Would again sure  <EOR> Now work downtown come new lunch options those options few far between downtown  But prefer support local businesses rarely want deal hassles casino especially lunch thought I'd give Eat try   It doesn't look much outside sketchy neighborhood but inside filled capacity downtown hipsters  Seating quite limited opted sit lunch counter  great choice because spent whole lunch impeding flow waitresses listening expediter shout orders  kept thinking should lend hand plate some food deep fry something   The food itself good  roast beef sandwich potato salad iced tea  quality ingredients above average seem take care presentation little added touches  But price stopped dead tracks  $16 50 plus tip sandwich side drink  Ouch! hadn't planned spending $20 lunch if would gone someplace better    gave them fair try but unless raise someone else buying won't back  leave $4 cup coffee hipsters  <EOR> Very bad service  Sat 4 parties told next   Which OK but no apology  Sat table 5 minutes before someone acknowledge us  She even checked table next twice  When finally came time order no decaf coffee no beignets  Very disappointing hearing such good things place  Won't back   Update  5 minutes order chicken fried steak tell that!!!

Well worth stop would absolutely again! <EOR> Was staying close past week some reason kept skipping place Big Mistake! Cinnamon Biscuits next last morning  Talked myself them because afraid would much many   Big Mistake Convenient excuse  Truffled Scrambled Egg Sandwich WHOA!! slightly disappointed myself ordering something so    safe   Heh perfection safe  nothing couldn't haven't prepared before myself BUT seriously delicious well balanced  spicier food interesting combinations but sandwich point  would again wholeheartedly recommend less adventurous friends  HOWEVER hash browns    I spent pretty much each bite trying determine why good mine delicious  spicy some places but very flavorful  Soft but crispy greasy many others  Thick but cooked through few onions perfectly cooked coincidence  lying South eaten cooked hash browns entire life but really perfect almost feel dork going them!  While contemplating egg sandwich hash browns couple next ordered received Cinnamon Biscuits  intimidating  afraid they'd huge nope normal size biscuits  Made plan right then return next morning checking hotel  Quick note coffee no fancy table presentation but just good well balanced cup joe  strong but bitter either  really good coffee choice  almost asked cup but thought I'd try nearby coffee shop Big Mistake!! other place crap coffee barely warm!!! Did finish should've taken back but such contented state eat  experience just dumped it   Next day Cinnamon Biscuit Day! Ran over hotel  spare details ordered biscuits minus powdered sugar compote side  feared sugary overload something which should stand alone  also side Chicken Apple Sausage  Alone Cinnamon Biscuits very very good  Delicious fact  pride myself traditional Southern biscuits which but tasteful alternative  NOW compote as designed SLAP MAMA!! good flavors don't clash totally compliment if reinforce  Fresh berries accompany  Great concept execution  Even better expected! wholeheartedly recommend Chicken Apple Sausage also  Split grilled greasy great sweet biscuits  Learning yesterday's mistake asked cup awesome coffee    Two times service both early morning before crowds exceptional especially Vegas  Seated quickly someone table moments seating drink order quick turn back recommendations helpful advice food order  Food turnaround both days super quick  town known ambivalent service best place gets it  recognized second day thanked returning  nice appreciated customer    Exceptional menu superior execution great service fair pricing   five me  <EOR> I working downtown when Eat opened its doors still go to places whenever looking place eat  If could give another half star probably would but few things consider Pros awesome coffee mornings nice atmosphere decor great homemade chips delicious grilled cheese sandwich freaking amazing tofu banh mi seriously   that favorite things    Cons spicy posole disappointingly bland palette perhaps off day? breakfast dish tortilla chips name which escaping apparently website down can't check tasty but ultimately muddled flavor   Probably most frustrating thing and still sticks craw day grabbed salad go  spinach salad aspragus almonds decided add some shrimp  saw shrimp add on kind spendy $4 ultimately salad cost $18  When office disappointed find tiny salad three tiny shrimp   more $1 shrimp!   So yeah   ultimately food favorites but can't round 4 stars just yet  When start working downtown again may change and definitely back but being away area taken shine off initial experiences  <EOR> We finally tried eat past weekend sorry say don't think experience matched expectations   We came brunch brunch menu different breakfast menu online truffled egg sandwich wanted order wasn't actually menu  Instead beignets which just ok  moist doughy light fluffy texture associate beignets  box Cafe du Monde beignet mix sitting shelf kitchen guess maybe use that? But texture unlike real thing even ones made same mix home  served really tasty jam greatly improved flavor though   I also found coffee bit weak which normally something would even bother mention but think important breakfast brunch spot great coffee   My husband chicken fried steak which did sample  did try all accompaniments though potatoes eggs especially toast all pretty delicious  Maybe savory food way here!  Our waitress pleasant if bit scattered did seated right away despite being basically peak breakfast time  am willing give eat another shot hear dog friendly patio works since live ridiculously close back pug tow weekday breakfast maybe lunch when opens up  <EOR> The first thing must know before eating come empty stomach  showed Sunday morning waited between 30 45 minutes table two  hosts friendly kept to date status table  Unfortunately when finally table server wasn't helpful  He zero sense urgency didn't good job remembering order  second half ordered another employee came back double check drink order which all wrong  food which good unceremoniously slammed down table moments later  ordered huevos motulenos great but good enough bad service  kept having ask things ketchup even though potatoes both plates  friend ask coffee refill twice  seem basics average IHOP waitress do  Why can't downtown's hippest breakfast place same?  What ultimately convinced back when check delivered  little note management included telling patrons Eat does split checks because they're busy  just don't think  good customer service think lie  probably don't want pay two credit card fees per check when pay one  Eat Las Vegas  Excellent customer service expected  Furthermore think Joel Robuchon? Your food good restaurant place would take out of town guests even back to  don't serve alcohol won't able wash down bitter taste bad customer service mimosa  Don't waste your time people  Brunch elsewhere  <EOR> Came lunch Thursday no wait group 6   Lots breakfast options though the Skinny Jenny salad pounded chicken breast beneath arugula served balsamic dressing + drizzle  tasty though nothing ordinary $12 cheap! Strawberry biscuits would probably skip next time hoping thicker fluffier more buttery biscuits but ended being bit sweet particularly special   Reasonably priced food hipstery relatively good service  <EOR> fantstic food gets pretty busy fast time <EOR> I found Eat while trying away Vegas scene boy did I! atmosphere refreshing welcoming good place even come yourself  Good coffee cinnamon perfectly your cup joe! truffle sandwich which light heavy  guy huevos moltulenos    swapped forks both torn over better  moltulenos experience  Each bite different taste bananas hidden under eggs give sweet surprise amongst Mexican flared beans chiles  Service friendly enthusiastic! If foody want some peace good grub Vegas check Eat! <EOR> Believe reviews food coming kitchen top notch  Sour dough bread best anywhere   wait staff friendly efficient  would give 5 but gets loud interior echoes sound but  most places seems consistently overlooked most restaurants  Just pet peeves don't let stop u going here  U won't disappointed if u do  <EOR> The only thing ruined experience 'eat' view seat some big guy showing off hairy ass crack  Along view not so attractive woman different  table showing off crack too  Despite horrid visuals around and slightly throwing mouth saw dude's ass food great  BLT good you'll find same said pancakes  slightly crispy edges fluffy texture easily billed better pancakes town  Syrup available but isn't needed  chicken apple sausage top great well  wasn't cheap breakfast but quality well worth it  brunch menu weekends fairly small much more usual breakfast lunch menu weekdays  plan your visit accordingly  <EOR> The cinnamon biscuits good but little more cinnamon sugar would put over top   I also ordered two Esha which tasty great bacon thick sour dough toast   Service ok   little long order sitting down just ok <EOR> Just perfectly good! Server simply AWESOME which made food experience much better! cinnamon bread brunch app just pure YUMMINESS!!! Chicken Fried Steak GREAT but gravy AMAZING! grits GREAT! <EOR> This popular new DT nook reminds trendy NYC brunch hangout  much food decor causes reminisce fact place limited seating excess patrons folks wait long time table even though other good restaurants within walking distance   If you're dining alone plant yourself counter almost immediately  If you're group  wait long 45 mins unlike Hash House a Go Go which also always long wait don't pager give can't just sashay bar while wait table   I tell guys really care customers   When received Downtown Benedict one signature dishes found poached eggs hard boiled   didn't even complain but manager noticed look disappoint face rushed dish re fired   The Benedict bad  picked slightly off putting vinegar flavor it   probably much vinegar poaching liquor   side skillet grilled potatoes pretty good fresh frozen   Hollandaise sauce smooth creamy texture  All ingredients tasted fresh plating presentation say pretty  would recommend Eat  may blow away but decent breakfast haven   Just aware wait noise  <EOR> 3 5 5  We came lunch weekday  Wasn't busy but service kinda slow    dwBLTa smoked bacon lettuce tomato avocado chipotle mayo toasted sourdough  Bread buttery soft bacon crisp thick but couldn't really taste chipotle mayo  Potato salad meh     Roast Beef blue cheese wild mushrooms picked red onions arugula mayo ciabatta  Roast beef tender moist  mushrooms great addition added nice sweetness  bread soft warm  Satisfying sandwich  fresh still warm potato chips fantastic  <EOR> Called see busy since its Mother's Day person answering phone said can't quote any wait times over phone which curios because called yesterday told 45 minute wait  said ok can't give wait time but could let know if busy she said No  Well if  kind service when call sure service if actually showed up  2 years ago loved food but don't think back next time we're Vegas  No matter good food little customer service long way  Oh well  Luckily many great places Vegas eat  <EOR> Breakfast mundane but when done thought flair really best start great day  Bravo Eat! returning customer anticipating next visit hopes try everything eventually  When visit Las Vegas 3 5 hour drive always stay downtown  missed hidden gem?

First all let's start location restaurant   Located downtown area within walking distance Fremont Experience   someone familiar area easily missed since literally below some apartments   Just remember corner Carson 7th   outside inside brings back home   establishment reminds historic North Park area San Diego where restaurants cafes stores sit below apartments     I met fellow Yelper Terri R breakfast both ready chow down   menu simple gets   No folding laminated menu just page sheet   Everything looked good but decided Smoked Salmon  Yes fish breakfast   Besides going eggs lunch    The Smoked Salmon served tomatoes cream cheese rye bread   admit best raw salmons while  Seasoned just right thinly cut fishy all     I thought staff good gets   attentive kept drinks filled   owner also around making rounds   But noticed she genuine sincere guests   biggest pet peeves when you're middle conversation waiter waitress interrupts you   waiter great timing around when he needed   Kudos Eat!!!  I definitely back because there's still more need try   only regret   I forgot try Beignets      TIP Bring some Quarters parking meters outside  <EOR> Looking something off strip breakfast  know most important meal day  Life short don't eat hurry food!

When asked staff if could push tables together manager overheard yelled NO! unprofessional that? rude  Luckily staff attentive polite  kept apologizing manager's unprofessional behavior  But seriously need fire Michael being such asshole guests! <EOR> The food decent but exceptional given price high praise  huevos ambitious attempt creative dish but fell flat  bananas contained conflicted flavors rest dish prompting pick them out  also truffle egg sandwich which ok but truly nothing rave seemed common hipster fare could find almost any big city  also side order pancakes which pretty thick but without addition syrup butter would dry unpleasant  <EOR> What great place eat hard night Vegas!!

Yet every aspect egg sandwich point  Crispy but soft bread yummy buttery scrambled eggs bacon mushrooms all individually good  making drool right now!

Lol  did still feeling chubby week ago   another review  Anyway hostess seats folks infront then seats us  Seating quick perfect  She wasn't rude nor she anything near good morning sunshine vibe spread  No biggie   We party 4 day  2 adults 2 minions  We sat down menu pages clipped clipboard    spiffy  scrolled through menu immediately should've done u turn because nothing genuinely appealed nothing something minions mouths could entertained by  Now note    MY minions  if kids they're into such selection don't talking review plenty kids  =P  It felt forever minutes through menu  must've flipped those 3 pages long takes watch Titanic  course joking but drift  going skip fine details inbetween but time waiter he seriously asked if needed more time  point told husband numerous times am feeling vibe ready exit prevent anymore disappointment  waiters didnt even look happy people staring cellphones they've sitting through Titanic movie 3rd time sitting   I immediately replied noooope ready  Waiter seriously didn't even look greeting form just connect  He seriously distracted something  He taking orders but looking around he jotting it  Imagine your waiter looking looking around looking behind back he being chased pretending waiter until assailants passed then he rip waiter uniform off merry way    The meal took long come considering ordered  husband half bowl posole stale piece tortilla chip  He said stale tortilla chip ruined vibe  side ordered chive potatoe scouts honor   a bowl burnt potatoes served  don't know if garlic pieces whatever   but burrrrrnt  Did say anything?

Well sounded pre meal free bread said yes  she really meant say would start appetizer called 'cinnamon biscuits warm strawberry compote'? money wasn't issue but trickery into ordering more menu  She might well started saying would start Dom Perignon? The staff very nice efficient  recommend checking joint if want some breakfast off strip  worth taking taxi here? No  really only because car  Albeit decent breakfast eatery  <EOR> Wait wasn't bad all   Eggs Benedict special delicious!

Otherwise never really acknowledged fudged up    All being said food pretty good  grilled cheese can't really mess grilled cheese note bread slices everything wicked thick     So 3 stars because food good but nothing special hostess apparently only somewhat competent    While would recommend brunch spot expect wait weekends your best enunciate your name party size hostess  <EOR> Hubby staying Fremont found place yelp walked over breakfast lunch   vibe inside much more Reno like Vegas    ie bare stark eclectic   We seated immediately waitress came right over   Two cups coffee great cups good coffee   opted pancake share big but nothing special   More Denny's even homemade   We also split deviled egg appetizer   take eggs remove yolk coat whites panko breadcrumbs fry them   They're served warm part ok then yellow part deviled top Sriracha sauce bacon which omitted due hubby being pescatarian maybe green onions   Very interesting texture standpoint but nothing amazing taste zone   Four halves = $8    too high   We each ordered Killer Grilled Cheese which billed aged cheddar sourdough served kick ass tomato soup   bread thicker Texas toast nice crispy buttery browned crust   almost translucent slice cheddar cheese which no discernsble flavor due overwhelming presence bread   tomato soup hint basil super runny base few chunks tomatoes   served beautiful large bowl if scant cup if that   duo certainly worth $9 price tag   All all two coffees two grilled cheese soup pancake two deviled eggs almost $50!
