May Shake Shack more juicy but taste wise just same rest burger places   wouldn't way look them if wanted eat burger but if come across happen mood then would give another shot! <EOR> Burger delicious although fries nothing write home about  Good but average  Staff super friendly atmosphere fun casual  Great cheap eat Strip burgers starting 5 bucks   I didn't shake but several party did  comment good Steak Shake  maybe skip fries shake just grab two burgers because they're awesome  <EOR> Being generous extra star     So came today some raving reviews friend mine  She likes place over In N Out super delicious blah blah blah   Came around 2pm short line outside spoke usher guy outside says he eats 4 things day brings then back home wife   so start thinking    big burgers?   He explains menu works all good stuff   Went inside waited second line looked over decor   I don't care   It's food  Just looked kinda hipster umami esq   No big deal   Ended getting single bacon peppers while gf single claim fame sorry forget names   opted single because couldn't myself spend 3 extra dollars 4oz meat patty  Chicago style hot dog instead try more menu fries topped off concrete kinda blizzard DQ strawberry waffle pieces  side fries bill came $28 bucks    whoo   that's   a lot   Got pager waited few   then food    First impressions looks good  Kinda small side burger wise  little smaller In N Out but bigger patties  Gf tomato piece lettuce mine good amount bacon peppers  Nice crinkle fries good looking concrete  Thought single scoop pretty small price  Chicago dog Nathan's small but looked part without nuclear green relish   Taste bacon good peppers little bite  No lettuce tomato this   Kinda disappointed  Tasted good but OMG best thing ever! Bread mix brioche hawaiian split but all way ended pocket thing  Gf's good but ordinary  Shack sauce kinda lacking  Nothing special  dog good  Split grilled  Good condiments but no casing no snap   fries great  Crinkle kept crunch  Although   for burger place tries exemplify organic no GMO specialty burger place would expected real potatoes   not some Sysco Ore Ida frozen potatoes fries  concrete good  liked that  waffle pieces crunchy tasty  strawberry good ice cream good  Note say ice cream   not custard advertise  frozen custard   and certain consistency smoothness taste   totally different froyo ice cream  but this   this ice cream   Final thoughts I'd come dessert  think burgers WAY overpriced  $9 small double cheese burger worth it  could gourmet gastro pub type burgers huge 1 2 1 3lb all kinds oddball toppings price  offer no combos help pricing  Taste mediocre  comparing major competitors In N Out more flavor but if even that   give more veggies $9 3 patties real hand cut fries drink  5 guys many toppings homestyle taste fresh cut fries drink well around same price    I lucky Vegas try place where spending money comes easy  If home I'd very angry  <EOR> I think comparing burger N N superior bun sauce but Shake Shack better meat patties def wayyy better fries  mean crinkle fries?

Can't wait them come LA WeHo district   <EOR> I SmokeShack burger awesome!  My son Cheeseburger bacon loved it!  Frozen custard great too!  Shakes just so!   My son said he wished Orange County CA <EOR> Before start review need something off chest  People compare every damn burger joint In N Out bunch crap! Stop! am In N Out fiend probably four five times month but comparing place Shake Shack In N Out fair comparison because they're two different style restaurants  If want closer comparison compare Five Guys    I stopped way back Calofornia Zion National Park  see while driving down strip  line door but seeing no locations around Southern California aware figured might only chance try Shake Shack while didn't know when next time I'd Vegas would be    The line long but moved pretty quick  menu very comprehensive serve all sorts great food drink items  even offer dog biscuits  When front line cashier very friendly    My food came shortly after  Presentation very nice  ordered Shack Burger creamsicle float   The bun burger spongy delicious  meat GREAT texture flavor  Cheese gooey  burger fantastic    The float equally good  Perfect hot weather  fries tried really crispy well executed    What didn't prices  Even though huge selection serve beer wine etc  prices high opinion  Just two things cost over $11  If ordered own fries would around $15 if recall  If order beer wine your bill could very easily top $20  thought Vegas treatment but told  all Shake Shacks   So food excellent but prices high  would definitely come back eat again just sparingly  Luckily don't Vegas often  <EOR> Incredibly overrated  many people compare place In N Out Burger but Shake Shack's small squishy burgers remind more something Rally's  Don't wrong  Sometimes coupla small squishy burgers hits late night fast food hangover cure jonesin' spot  if  you're craving head Rally's  least your wallet thank you  <EOR> I love Shake Shack always when NYC but happy find Vegas! always crazy busy but moves pretty quickly  <EOR> Don't see why place gets compared often  Two different types burgers   essentially distinctive    Sigh   for sake game  vote  in out  live both New York LA  Know two worlds  I'd say vote unbiased     Fries?

If they're going force wait 25 minutes EVERY order before yours least right sure somewhat fresh  staff freely admit ordering system works  Yeah more complicated order take longer  Guess what? When half staff standing around bored because they're caught staging sofas fries should hand damn food customers instead doing petty side work pre opening to go bags  Infuriating  <EOR> You want some really good burgers?  I've Steak N Shake Bachi Burger acc dint compare Shake Shack far best burgers had! staff great being first time going patient me  Check only shack when Vegas! <EOR> Shake Shack more 3 5 but rounded because filling quality  ordered Shack Burger Shack Sauce side fear burger being overwhelmed  sauce actually very delicious nice creamy consistency  sauce complemented burger well  also ordered French fries which nice crispy but little salty side  mom cheese fries which decent but amazing  burger itself looks pretty small finished rather quickly however fries meal left very stuffed which relieved walk Strip  Overall would return however won't running back just eat Shackburger  Next time hope try frozen custard which looked very promising  <EOR> Great shakes lot flavor  fries very good  Located next door New York New York  <EOR> Their Frozen Custard fantastic! back next time am Las Vegas! <EOR> I ordered triple cheeseburger off hook much bigger burgers thought  the corn dog good fair but cheese sauce fries killer  good job  small concrete tasty but skimpy red stuff when supped Vanilla   no worries gonna still give u 4 stars  <EOR> Best burger but can't stop getting peanut butter shake   Surprisingly quick trip through line   Sorry competitors but burger just tastes better say its beef used   Can't imagine getting burger sitting new park front NYNY   fries great prefer them cheese  <EOR> Good tasty affordable  more could want  Yes wait time might annoy few people but least means your food being prepared reasonably fresh  food excellent  never disappointed quality food received  <EOR> There lot hype Shake Shack  very excited because Shake Shack originally New York heard executives send secretaries wait line  course very eager try place but also hate going strip  finally tried place few days    I ordered shack stack which comes hamburger patty deep fried portobello mushroom cheese  When first bit into burger thought wow amazing  tastes great  patty flavorful  However way burger stuffed only bit into bun both same time  while just really really salty which great because could drink lemonade  Only stuffed cup ice only few sips lemonade  worth $2 75 appeared 12 oz cup    When first ordered ordered shake stack but charged double  don't eat much did refund  However confused me  should told reopened check voided amount  thought going refund then recharge very confused until friend explained me    I would consider maybe going again only if town guest wanted visit  pricey worth it  <EOR> That best juiciest burgers ever had! flavorful! <EOR> I two bites am love  beef fresh cooked perfect  veggies tasty chrisp  Buns melt your mouth!!!

Shake Shack provides solid burger  fries usually quite good  concretes divine  being said if you've experienced other Shake Shacks New York DC elsewhere comes off well trying hard   It's trying hard New York Las Vegas  Even point being attached gaudy New York New York  They've giant video wall seems play nothing but endless loops New York talks all local ingredients other Shake Shacks use but location   When 1 30pm weekday  restaurant packed but line manageable some stalking able seat  burger would expect Shake Shack which say quite good  However flummoxed trying order two different beers then root beer none which actually around  disappointing   If you've never Shake Shack nice well if discount usual Vegas clientele  But if you've experienced Shake Shack somewhere else you're better off trying another Vegas' many delicious burger restaurants  <EOR> Delicious best burgers had  Tasty beef salty all just enough lettuce tomato fresh soft bun perfectly melted cheese  cheese fries ordinary either  mix cheddar american yumminess  unique  Also best root beer floats sure kind soda used but bite compliments creamy ice cream most delicious way  Definitely fan  <EOR> A great burger joint definitely coming back next Vegas trip!

Overall happy camper!!!! <EOR> YO place definitely lives hype   Every time Vegas mission least try place days staying  eye pleasing modernized facility home best burgers entire life  don't know food but can't even compare food in n out because they're different levels  The first time came double burger Shack past time chicken shack both absolutely incredible  Also shakes to die for  always cinnamon dulce le leche shake  then dip crinkle cut fries into shake all world peace   Service kind slow times but can't even ask better burger because there's just nothing it  If you're new area contemplating coming spot suggest coming thru because can't wrong  <EOR> Okay first admit vegetarian going any burger place ideal  But last trip Vegas stopped grabbed some fries person behind counter super helpful when asked dedicated fryer trip figured we'd grab fries before leaving something bigger later   saw mushroom burger gluten free bun  excited but soon asked cooked food allergies knew bad experience   She acted big hassle answer questions   told allergies she rolled eyes asked 'what eat' very condescending tone  point said never mind I'd just fries but she weirdly tried sell chicken burger um opposite veg wheat free   kept insisting just getting fries she manager explained he confirmed wasn't anything else without wheat again said would just fries  don't know why hard comprehend but walk away woman ended putting sour note trip  <EOR> Amazingly refreshing fresh food nice strip view! would definitely recommend anyone listen! <EOR> First Shake Shack West Coast! having Shake Shack New York couldn't contain excitement when heard opening Vegas  course first people christen it  showed 1 5 hours before official grand opening literally first line haha  Instead having stand side cold staffers actually came greet then offered some seating patio under heaters  Great service even before doors opened!   As food go to Shack Stack red peppers cheeseburger topped deep fried cheese stuffed portobello mushroom  Heaven bun! also breathed sigh relief when heard crinkle cut fries stay instead natural cut fries    Let first welcome Shake Shack West Coast hopefully first many! <EOR> Best burger planet  Everything literally perfect melts your mouth  love place much words can't describe  <EOR> The burger good  Fries good remember order them la carte menu   Shake wasn't very impressive not much ice cream machine style <EOR> Sehr guter Burger nicht besonders groß aber mit doppelt Fleisch definitiv ausreichend  Draft Bier ist mit 6 7 USD normal teuer  Atmosphäre leider wie im Schnellrestaurant  P L gut Empfehlung Ja <EOR> A shake shack west coast?!? WHATTT?!!  I've tried back NY years back dreamt Shack Stack since then  Then found they've come good 'ol viva Las Vegas! Dream  Come  True   It's right end Brooklyn Bridge NY NY hotel  wait isn't bad  You'll shocked people waiting but line moves fast!   For those hasn't opportunity try back East Coast serve variety different cuisines burgers hot dogs custards adult drinks  far favorite thing Shack Stack  burger stacked fried stuffed cheese portobello mushroom inside  Freaking amazing  seriously best hangover cure ever  Order some custard shakes cheese fries freaking bomb   My only gripe compared N fresh made order  You'll notice there's bunch burgers pre made under heat lamp behind counter  freshness doesn't even come close burgers N Out  also secret sauce similar N called shack sauce but N Outs better    Definitely must try least once  then compare which coast better  West coast definitely best coast!! <EOR> Finally chance try place very disappointed   Food overpriced   Burgers mediocre nothing special   Fries greasy taste then    Expected more based hype   Felt totally tourist trap   Habit Burger n way better if n mood burger <EOR> OMG can't even  line outside door speaks volumes yum place is  burgers delicious but most people don't know all fuss because order wrong burger  Don't wrong taste quality ingredients but MUST order Shack Stack experience Shake Shack's fullest potential  complete experience crinkle cut fries shake must added even more satisfying!  The breaded mushroom filled cheese stuck inside burger absolute heaven  cheese oozes bite into it  combination what's inside compliments each other magically   The crinkle cut fries cooked perfect shakes thick creamy  person ahead recommended didn't share shake planned I wanted cut calories glad didn't  Once sip willingly committed drinking whole thing completion   Get line already! <EOR> I've fan place since tried New York happy opened west coast  located front New York New York hotel although packed inside no line  chicken sandwich 50 50 drink  sandwich delicious  Great quick snack when you're hungry walking strip  <EOR> This place incredible!! food delicious!! little wait alittle while cause line door but fast! IN competition if burger place comes CALI!! fries alittle normal just regular crinkle fries    But still good!!! <EOR> I Sunday before Memorial Day employee outside door tell ran beef! crazy! But compensate she gave $10 giftcard! ended ordering Chick'n Shack double down fries regular fries  Also because ordered Chick'n Shack given free frozen custards    I've West Hollywood location prior glad tried original Shackburger then Chick'n Shack location  delicious! comes lettuce pickles mayo  into pickles but good tell fresh is    Apparently also ran normal bowl whatever use double down fries ended 3 individual boats  double down fries alright  little bit cheesy  hate crinkle cut fries but actual fries amazing!! can't stress enough good crispy was! If area would definitely come back again just fries! <EOR> This place over rated even funny   Food isn't much better other burger places Vegas least other spots don't wait while your food   place should really look service team clue handle customers correctly I personally think Smashburger better place   <EOR> I join bandwagon try place minute Vegas  definitely didn't disappoint gone twice row  cheeseburger fries both times  love quality meat  could definitely taste fresh was! Mine cooked perfectly each time  sauce everything else great well  bread soft reminded Hawaiian Kings bun but sweet  fries first time them REALLY salty  sure if batch but second time around asked no salt perfect! quality fries par fry game  also tried concrete which famous custard blended topping  chocolate cookie dough topping  very sweet even but hit spot heat  pretty much drank took order haha  Still yummy would definitely try another next visit  flavors week  always nice twist things  only thing place pricey at least compared in n out other fast food joints but pay quality service hit miss gets super busy hype real  good spot try if you're south side strip NY NY! <EOR> I don't understand hype  Came because heard good was!   Portion sizes just SMALL! justifiable when you're playing $14 full meal aren't full! desserts really good  Just keep mind concretes McDonald's value size but you're playing $5 6 it    Also shakes  burger good paid $8 but size also McDonald's mc chicken size    Nothing wrong place except price    <EOR> Packed perfectly located Chicken Sandwich Burger before event TMobile   TMobile Arena believe excellent food way better Shake Shack  See pix under TMobile Arena    Chicken Sandwich looked super appetizing picture worthy only   ok nothing special     The PB Shake great!  Love shape plastic wine cup lol horrid wine wouldn't expect better fast food spot   Wonder if new Henderson District location serves alcohol?  really no purpose back find but FYI strip does serve alcohol  <EOR> Well   the shake good   all say good  shack burger very underwhelming felt very cheap  burger shake over $11 00  No fries either  shake actually cost more then shack burger  return when left felt just really crappy appetizer burger small!!! Don't waste your money In N Out Burger better quality more your money  <EOR> In n LIFE!!! Sorry sorry    I've seen Shake Shack pictures everywhere YEARS always wondered tasted boyfriend thrilled when saw building Vegas  ran over first night dinner excited    The line raps around door but moved pretty fast  also gives enough time decide want since menu pretty large  decided shake stack he smoke shack  shared order fries    Shake stack cheese stuffed deep fried mushroom stacked top burger patty lettuce tomato shack sauce  added white onions  very careful when eating because cheese ridiculously hot ooze out! mushroom pretty salty patty smaller expected  liked texture bun but wished toasted like n out   really sure sauce didn't much flavor  Animal spread better just sayinnnn    Smoke shack cheese burger bacon  Pretty standard self explanatory    The fries crinkle cut nice crispy    Their sodas self serve ask refill which kinda hassle especially since they're busy    Overall food decent but think expectations high  prices also high little food get! Come now fast food but you're paying restaurant price  Smh! still hungry Secret Pizza hahah   Now experienced probably wouldn't way return  I'd say if you've never want see hype but you'll probably disappointed    Sticking n out! West coast best coast! <EOR> I've heard lot great things place     but did cut me  guess burgers thick juicy  meet juicy aspect but thick  buns good but again didn't wow me  <EOR> We really liked Shake Shack! food great price real value  each burger fries shake bill only $16! crinkle cut fries crispy outside soft inside  burgers hot juicy shakes delicious! <EOR> I tried going Shake shack Maryland early year finding yelp when drove still being built  Ugh!

Everything inside modern new design wise looks pretty spectacular   There almost no line when came in  someone handing menus but since no line think fast! SmokeShack single burger peppers bacon  also side crinkle fries mango lemonade   This place many people kitchen  must've least 30 people back doing all kinds cooking assembly  wasn't busy didn't think going take long all those people but still took ten minutes which little odd  big deal but still worth mentioning  order to go dining room packed   The burger toppings bun delicious! bun nice soft bacon thick crispy  sauce peppers perfect combination flavors match patty  only thing portion tiny price  $7 burger its much bigger McDouble Mickey D's  Still quality excellent  worth forgiving   The fried aren't anything write home but nice crispy mango lemonade good but little sweet syrupy   Overall Shake Shack serves some pretty good food  plenty friendly people behind counter place nice clean  If overlook tiny portions relative price think you'd too! <EOR> Sooo tasty no wonder long line   burger bit smaller expected but way better N OUT!  Please open chains Bay Area CA <EOR> Is good burger ? Yes  I'd worth price regular eat? No  Should try ?

Half Kidding   Trying now consistent reviews break them down Cost Service Ambience Food Drink Random Thoughts   Cost $10 $20  Service lines  Wow  Now may saying gosh Mike obviously  most popular east coast burger chain just opened single busiest street world   I understand but guess when knew opening corner spot Strip figured would MORE FOUR CASHIERS  smallest Shake Shack NYC still 3 cashiers     Ambience fine  Seating hard find sometimes but seems patio open during summer which fun! also silly roulette themed lights which guess add décor but all honesty probably waste money    Food Burgers great charred super! Fries great especially cheese  thought hot dogs underwhelming lacking snap associate great hot dog  main selling point always Concretes  two Vegas ones great but anytime add cheesecake bites chocolate cookie dough whatever else into some delicious custard recipe hitting jackpot! HA! bad pun!   also C line cold items which really solid when temps hit 100   Random no casino entrance  thought may more efficient park Monte Carlo cross strip way parking NYNY walking through entire casino  Just food thought  <EOR> I love place      the food always good  don't eat beef don't chicken menu always mushroom burger cheese fries  mushroom burger cheese fries very tasty shakes compliments meal very well  Place always busy long lines often hard find seat but its worth waiting since food satisfactory  <EOR> I finally try place last trip Vegas luckily no line when went!

NOT   Sorry people  aight  gonna give them 2 star cause all hype  came expecting greatness  Person taking order couldn't give any recommendations personal favorites  wasn't busy could've made anything I'd it    I something simple single burger  Nothing special  Could've made home  Would've thought base stuff would least decent  Nope  whopper  something Wendy's would've better  small simple price  Its more nothing flashy  GOOD!? here    Had try shake  red velvet shake  bad  Good liked especially walking strip 100 degree kind day but nothing special  Taste red velvet shake anywhere else serves it  Small simple price once again  Strip price!? Maybe   The atmosphere pretty chill it  nice inside tvs mostly spacious dining  Tables lots elbow room but back back little tight depending sits next you  some seatings outside too   I'm sure place good probably only person come knowing nothing place but fault experience employee mine  Anyways might try them again but anytime soon unless hear something really try   Easily accessible when walking along strip but if your driving cause park nearest casino walk  <EOR> Not fan fries  Burger okay  grew In Out prefer burgers over Shake Shack  However did thoroughly enjoy milkshakes environment here <EOR> They say east coast's In N Out but being California girl am say NOTHING beats In N Out  can't help but reasoning  Maybe actual New York tastes better?   Okay shack stack  Try saying three times fast hah bet haven't heard before! LOL jk bet have! ANYWAYS shack stack regular burger patty lettuce tomato cheese buns but shack stack comes mushroom  just any mushroom though mushroom stuffed cheese breaded panko all over  burger $10  If just mushroom burger regular burger would five six dollars  technically paid extra five six dollars mushroom   It would fine if tasted amazing but did tickle taste buds way hoped  First off mushroom salty  usually don't think many things salty but could tell salty  rest burger good meat rest veggies  bun interesting though  sweet unlike most places   Glad tried Shake Shack but don't think would coming back seconds burgers  would try desserts though  <EOR> Had wait line 10 minutes but did enjoy shack burger!  There many friendly people very pleasant helpful   It might little pricey size sandwich but tasty worth money <EOR> After few hours gambling wife hungry  Pretty much everything close hotel NY NY closed  Shake Shack open  Burgers total disappointment dry tasteless  <EOR> it almost 7 years since last Shake Shack meal   time around realized really category own   fast food your full service restaurant   BUT   whatever category put them burgers exceptional   meat quality superior any fast food joint exists perhaps just good your 4 5 star rated full service restaurants better many plentiful there   we ordered DOUBLE SHACK BURGER CHICK'N SHACK FRIES SALTED CARAMEL SHAKE JACKPOT CONCRETE here's rolled the DOUBLE SHACKBURGER   mmmm   meat tender no doubt freshly ground   crumbled easily bite   flavorful   cheese   lusciously melted patty   bun eggy bite gave all flavors textures burger   other words tasted burger whole sum all its parts   each every part its components synonymous its bigger self ie  being BURGER   does any sense?  can't think any other way explain it   naturally melded together every luscious bite seamlessly glorious   SO   DARN   GOOOOOD    the CHICK'N SHACK   came no expectations   but life changing amazing   crispy greasy   ahhhh    J U U U U I C Y   blown away chick a dee  just perfection all around   yeah cliché but truth   sorry     just don't think ever want another Chick fil Who??  ever again   YEAH   GOOD   then some   some more   why oh why did hubby share??!

If freshly cooked perfectly greasy burgers place! shakes great only downside if place busy your shake sitting few minutes before your food little melted but  honestly only negative thing even begin say  <EOR> Yeay!! finally try Shake Shack!  Albeit NYC where saw wanted but lines absurd   Las Vegas built Shake Shack New York New York sense new addition central park area   heard 3 weeks opened lines similar NYC's lines but when line bad all   I ordered Smokestack burger cheese smoked bacon chopped smoked cherry peppers fries   Everything delicious   feel l Shake Shack better but need again sure before rule uncrowned best fast food burger  Definitely check place out!  trying NYC next sure quality standard! <EOR> As much love In N Out admit Shake Shack better all around  fries hamburger meat cheese frozen custard shake made quality ingredients deserve recognition  Price point higher very reason  addicted perfect fries! Cheese lovers order side cheese dip keep fries crisp  shackburger left wanting more  shroomburger chicken sandwich also amazing! <EOR> Not sure understand big deal place is  pretty expensive rather small burger fries nothing ordinary  they reminded krinkle cut fries served school's dining commons which really emphasize ordinary are  ordered smokeshack burger which very disappointing because peppers did well rest burger opinion  least line moved quickly even though fairly long  But overall wouldn't care spend much money burger again when better deal better taste N Out  <EOR> OMG!

Burger tasty coffee milk shake mediocre  <EOR> On Las Vegas Strip right between New York New York Monte Carlo Shake Shack  People confuse lot times Steak 'n' Shake  don't mistake  two places completely different   The burgers place don't come fries  they're much smaller  they're more expensive    Upon looking menu saw SmokeShack burger a cheeseburger bacon $7 single $9 50 double! figure burgers must fairly big justify such price  even Vegas   They weren't  ordered double but thing insultingly small  Oh when asked kind cheese put besides American lady said  all have  Really? basically even real cheese!  But despite all bites two surprisingly good  digging it  bun actually really fluffy buttery  meat  which pretty good quality  covered whole bun without any excess bread end  But more ate more fake cheesiness me  If wasn't bacon somewhat balance would much more miserable experience  for nearly $10  still hungry afterwards   My fiancee Shack cago Dog more reasonable price $4  actually really good too  your classic Chicago style hotdog nice peppery kick  Oh french fries addicting well   If don't know good burgers might place  But going other faster food burger places Fuddruckers Steak 'n' Shake place step above Five Guys step below In n Out although meat better   gotten pretty tired In n Out already  <EOR> Had single Shake Shack Shroom  Both juice flavorful   Crinkle cut fries also good Christmas Cookie Shake   We use eating Habit n   Didn't think would compare but I'd say better those 2   Service order pickup 5 minutes  Price good Strip location less Johnny Rockets most food court offerings far better quality  <EOR> Eh ok   Let elaborarate  good n out  Sorry   But way better white castle  Hubby craving fast meal didn't want back car again 3 hr drive into Vegas  Smoked Shack he Shackago Dog split some regular fries vanilla shake  Total $20  burger good although little small side actually preferred hubs' hot dog although he didn't because nothing dog he Wrigley's Field  Umm yeah thing beast dog Lil beast jr  Vanilla shake good kinda hard mess crinkle cut fries  all much money just ok food  Won't going back  <EOR> This first time Shake Shack location  may biased since LA but always choose N over Shake Shack  think over hyped food isn't great over priced   We came because friends never tried before  place already line outside 11 10 AM when opened 11 AM  menu isn't anything ordinary burgers fries shakes etc  usual Shake Shack order consists Shack Burger single patty cheese fries  really Shack Burger bun! slightly sweet unbelievably soft  burger simple lettuce tomato patty famous Shack sauce which reminds spread N Out  downside burger pretty small much more $$$ compared N Out's  burger isn't anything mind blowing     The fries crinkle cut fries which aren't favorite begin with  pile melted cheese top which good first but tiring towards end  lot cheese even love cheese lol  definitely share someone because lot cheese flavor    What really water  funky smell taste it     soda instead because hard time drinking water here  <EOR> I recently pleasure trying Shake Shack location first time last week  aware Shake Shack vs  In N Out Burger awhile but being North Carolina never able try both  must say Shake Shack definitely lived expectations  atmosphere restaurant pretty laid back packed seemed mix locals tourists  ordered standard burger but asked well done which perfectly right even putting well done sticker it  burger delicious fresh toppings fresh well bun buttery complimented burger nicely  also concrete which custard two mix ins chocolate toffee chocolate truffle cookie dough  Unfortunately cashier must've messed instead truffle cookie dough some unidentifiable pleasing topping instead  Despite mix vanilla custard could taste absolutely incredible best custard ever rich flavorful! return last night Vegas another time did order correct chocolate truffle cookie dough die for! wish Shake Shack NC! <EOR> Super excited try Shake Shack weekend  Smoke Shack roughly $6 single patty while burger bit small all flavors there!

Cheese fries okay nothing special  definitely back  <EOR> I've east coast couple times but never heard Shake Shack until last year so  short list places always wanted try along w Sonics Applebees 5 Guys Chick fil A etc because just don't Hawaii  pass something Applebees but when Yelp Hawaii CM tells visit Shake Shack your visit Vegas then it! SUCH good choice!  Where's at? It's corner outside New York New York hotel across street Hard Rock Cafe  indoor outdoor seating spending sunny day outside nom could nice! inside pretty modern there's lot seating   Don't scared line They stanchions set snake line before ordering counter line always fills whole area set it  Don't fear! line actually moves really quickly perfect time decide you're going order while wait  huge menu board set next stanchions  Once order give buzzer know when you're order ready   Food Drinks The burgers yummy! buns don't overtake fillings fillings good   like sure want bacon cheese peppers tomato lettuce extra sauce! Oh throw extra patty more cheese there? Uh   YES! D   They burgers fries but  they're known really  Shake Shack known shakes frozen custards! What's difference between regular run of the mill ice cream frozen custard? Frozen custard eggs cream made into thick custard first before being frozen regular ice cream just heavy cream flavoring generally frozen its liquid state  other words frozen custard MUCH richer it's because eggs   point MUST frozen custard! plain all mix ins which definitely way go!  FYI fast food burger joint also sells beer wine! Don't surprised Vegas lol  even beers tap! Obviously must 21+ order that  P  Conclusion I totally wish Hawaii   man would popular  <EOR> A friend told spot seeing Vegas husband decided try it  1st time line crazy long 105 Vegas hot waiting outside food  next time decided when 1st opened  food blah  Nothing special  burgers thin wasn't juicy all  can't see myself ever eating again  <EOR> First time shake shack think place overhyped  Don't wrong burgers delicious but value isn't great  single shackburger $5 29 double shackburger $8 09  feel if all burgers $1 29 cheaper price would perfect! higher quality burgers price i e  habit burger much better value! <EOR> What horrible experience  wait forever order then person gave food another complaining customer swore order even though she 3 people behind line!!

I ordered standard Shack Burger even though wanted Shack Stack but since class afterwards didn't want risk nausea worse throwing eating closely exercising   Since both did care N fries day before we already knew going in ended throwing away lot fries decided share order fries between here   fries MUCH BETTER   crispy crinkle cut style   Yum   fresh soggy sitting around all   still good idea share order though   quality burger really excellent kind picky stuff   Yum     My friend ordered Shack Stack looked amazing!!!!  She said super good but left couple bites uneaten because she full   She also ordered shake would explain it   liked sizes shakes floats very moderate outrageous   prefer quality over quantity   root beer float since wanted taste custard but whole shake again whole heavy foods right before exercising thing    would come again! <EOR> I only heard crazy wait NYC location  obviously there's huge hype  decided try Smoke Shack basically bacon burger fries strawberry shake  fries super crispy greasy  shake creamy perfect thickness  However burger ok  Tasted fine but nothing write home about  $7 really big  n almost same size burger half price  personally would upset if waited more hour eat burger  feel N still best burger  fries shake good but would come back  <EOR> I've various Shake Shacks New York D C  now Las Vegas  times where eaten Shack Stack burger cheese wasn't melted thoroughly inside portobello mushroom  forgiven them those times because food still legit  places people hype but think quality stands true ratings    I highly recommend following Shack Stack a cheeseburger includes crisp fried portobello mushroom melted muenster cheddar cheeses Cheese fries crinkle cut fries topped melted cheese Rootbeer   Many people compare Shake Shack N Out  While tried both think each them pluses Shake Shack solid Shack Stack burger actual crispy crinkle cut fries N customizable burgers fries signature sauce   Try Shake Shack if you're able to! <EOR> Oh Shake Shack you're only cheat In N Out  Being California maybe little biased because honestly In N Out literally right down street me  But Shake Shack special lovely mistress Las Vegas    New York New York hotel now charges parking although first hour free  You'll need more rest stumbling over hungover heat  seems always pretty busy snagging table excruciatingly depressing  someone scout table while someone else orders them    I always good old Shack Burger no need fancy toppings  bun fluffy but mushy patty perfectly soft  just looks kinda soggy underwhelming but taste perfect me  other options well such veggie burger portobello instead patty    I dislike fries fries crispier side  friend ordered cheese fries SUPER salty  Between five couldn't finish it  friend also ordered Oreo shake personally way sweet but I'd give shakes another chance    The great thing Shake Shack there's lot menu options alcoholic options well  Shake Shack stolen heart although food mediocre nothing beats burgers hangover cure  <EOR> I really don't hype  They're bad all but they're definitely nothing write home about  biggest plus good buns don't drown burger sauce  Expensive crap but maybe  just cause strip Vegas  Spend extra money Lyft other side freeway N Out  <EOR> Good burgers fries ok  Very busy seemed learning curve but very nice staff  <EOR> Perhaps spoiled amazingness In N Out but don't think Shake Shack lives hype  good burger?

Overall atmosphere restaurant hip fun now say eaten Shake Shack but probably won't return because just OK burger  <EOR> After trying figure going eat last night decided give place try  really impressed wait 3 mins until food  Only downfall loud music inside  I'd recommend place if looking good burger chicken sandwich  <EOR> The first time ever Shake Shack Chicago glad tried it  never heard before until watched Top 10 video YouTube best fast food burger places  surprise number spot Shake Shack  confused because never even heard restaurant before  quickly googled found very city living in! first taste Burger Shack sold   The Las Vegas Shake Shack no different any other location to  always packed  prepared stand long line depending time go  seen lines coil front door  Also prepare see some high prices fast food burgers  may look intimidating but personally think worth it   This Shake Shack very large dining area which great  packed but partner still able find seating  Every time gone workers very nice high energy even though dealing mobs people   Each time gotten burger fries sold separately shake  honest say ordered SmokeShack burger each time  love SmokeShack since don't visit Shake Shack lot always taste burger   The SmokeShack ShackSauce cherry peppers smoked bacon  Everything blends perfectly together  ShackSauce gives savory sweet flavor peppers add nice acidic bite bacon gives smoky need say it? bacon flavor  burger patties flattened but gives them crispy outer texture flavor meat delicious rich fatty beef flavor know most people looking burger  hamburger buns nice fresh which just adds experience  hamburger buns fresh which just adds experience    My gripe wish burger bigger  far fast food burgers burgers small  Even double isn't very big  sure if price burger matches size  quality does though   The fries delicious  crinkle cut when cooked well perfect crispiness  felt salted well match well burgers  shakes thing would say must if ice cream is   tried peanut butter mud pie pumpkin pie shakes  Each time shake very thick point where difficult drinking through straw I that each time shake exceeded expectations  truly taste ingredients except magnified  tasted eating ice cream pumpkin pie when shake  amazing restaurant definitely lives its name   If eat Shake Shack prepared spend more would other fast food restaurants  But also prepared very high quality fast food  rare find food where think quality outshines price quantity but Shake Shack pulls off  However don't think would enjoy much without getting whole meal  think collectively meal deserves 5  Definitely give try  <EOR> Fun place quick burger Strip  Seating little tight peak times which probably explains flat plywood bottom chairs but great place fast food  several notches above typical fast food Las Vegas  Don't forget order shake too! <EOR> Holy shit amazing  good  Amazing  Good enough want New York try there  Seriously stupid good   We all SmokeStack burgers drinks fries  cherry peppers burger gave them wonderful kick wasn't expecting  shared side fries between 3 people amazing  usually don't crinkle cut fries because always taste weird but fantastic  Crisp outside fluffy inside  mayo packets condiment bar!

But give location try worth trip  Sadly parking now devil strip  Ty MGM!! <EOR> Shack burger vanilla milkshake best! spacious interior location well  <EOR> I think place awesome   delicious prices aren't expensive     I don't eating fast food general but place  I approve   veggies burger seem fresh  doesn't even seem junk food like McDonalds whatever    The first time just simple burger Shack Burger   Even simple burger tasty   next time ordered Shack Stack amazing  fried mushroom thing oozes cheese when bite into it     My friends try always trip Shake Shack whenever Vegas  <EOR> Best burger ever had  Plain cheeseburger well done fries strawberry shake  burger amazing amazing amazing! AMAZING! <EOR> I really meat bun Shack burger  salted caramel milkshake also divine  However likely never order fries again  tried fries all way which crinkle cut topped cheese bacon bits red peppers rather underwhelming  enough cheese much chopped red peppers fries should crispier    Of burger chains tried far Shake Shack's burger more 5 Guys  very different n really can't say which those two better  Can't remember burgers Habit Burger might combo of long since Habit Burger unremarkable remain memory  <EOR> Just bumped place #1 burger place  Amazingly good!   The service little slow because all clients but time when your order ready  app where order ahead time skip huge line have  little slower but they're response good they're all really friendly <EOR> I love shake shack  Every time am city visit before leaving  location Strip Vegas while pretty busy long line quick taking people's orders served food reasonable speed  food delicious  ordered shackstack which regular cheeseburger fried cheese stuffed portabello mushroom acting second patty  burden way delicious juicy  absolutely love buttery bun well compliments flavors meat portabello mushroom  may more expensive but I'd choose shake shack over n heartbeat  <EOR> I Shake Shack another city last summer experience less stellar  Writing review should know Shake Shack sent gift card me  wasn't sure if would ever use gift card because isn't Shake Shack state  Behold though Vegas! used gift card last summer experience  gift card no way influenced review but thought best front that    I love Shake Shack number reasons 1 love close new park sit inside eat food 2 LOVE prices  much Vegas overpriced  Shake Shack could charge double triple normally charge Vegas but choose route integrity charge typical price 3 burgers just good 4 custard die 5 stay open late which means Shake Shack going give some overpriced places NY NY run money   That said fries just okay  ordered cheese fries little bland  sure if fry itself cheese but weren't great   The service amazing way restaurant hustles folks through line really good  see Shake Shack doing very well location Vegas  excited add list places visit when there  <EOR> I bit hung over other night already 1PM  deciding between Shake Shack Holstein's  Hubby wanted more traditional burger opted Shake Shack  Plus wanting try Shake Shack NYC excited see now open Vegas   We line almost door  probably waited 20 minutes place order  ordered ShackBurger cheese Chocolate Malted Shake  Hubby some special burger crispy onions special sauce i think? coffee shake  shared order cheese crinkle fries   The place filled large TVs hubby able watch sports while waited  Food came 15 20 minutes  took first bite thought really good   not sure if because around 2PM starving  But few more bites realized wasn't impressed  wasn't bad burger any means but wasn't great burger  shake lacking something well didn't taste creamy enough me  Hubby very disappointed burger well especially coffee shake  He did fries though but other hand wasn't feeling special cheese sauce  both agreed both N Five Guys much better    Maybe tastes better NYC? <EOR> Shake Shack even your prime better n Out  your soggy buns gloopy shakes consistently find ways disappoint me  both Shake Shack next Central Park Citi Field  probably worst  serviceable burger but nothing more that  burger right now only nostalgia purposes  Even shakes don't taste custard  When black white shake tastes slightly upgraded Oreo Mcflurry know isn't where want eating  There's Burger Bar honestly might grab White Castle slider if feeling remembering good times New York  Otherwise I'd head across way some delicious n Out  two best things mention place are water mister outside scenes New York panoramic display screen  if think them serving east coast beer good remember most east coast beers especially NY breweries aren't very good when compared western brethren  <EOR> Food Ordered smoke house burger cheese fries  No shake trip! actually enjoyed fries more burger  burger just okay   Service The line door but really quickly  guy took order very sweet  able find table quickly  Definitely need quick your toes score table since its first come first serve  <EOR> Came last Friday night stoked finally trying it  long line looking menu passes time yeah  ordered Shake Stack  FYI burger separate ordering criss cut fries can't meal  ALSO tell them want lettuce tomatoes otherwise doesn't come it  give light thing when your order ready if don't want order drink just want water there's water dispenser side   The wait wasn't long there's good amount seats inside outside   The verdict burger just aight  Idk hype but okay hella whatever  expected thick patty but hella whatever no specific taste made stick out  fries plain too  Let just say right when took bite into initial reaction N way better  Especially price burger being $6+ hella disappointed    It foreal just hype  <EOR> I visited location twice within past few months  personally love smoke shack good little spice too  husband ordered cheese fries which both thought disappointment    the regular fries much better  location busy weekends not surprising weekdays lot less traffic  <EOR> Wow  Love it  rumors true  BACK line seconds   burgers little smaller but taste great   day night boozing Vegas      it hit spot   didn't shake serve beer beer souvenir SHAKE SHACK glow dark cup   did notice don't stay open all night but didn't ahold hours were   trying close people kept coming in   Crinkle cut fries very good well   Its fine dining establishment but food fast     its greasy its good   def head back Shake Shack next time Vegas <EOR> This place severely inefficient  buzzer off food done when actually wasn't done  Then proceeded wait 15 minutes standing front counter  Turns even made food  waited another 15 minutes all while just standing front counter  friends came already done eating food wondering keeping food still wasn't done  manager gave refund but said he would still give food  walked out  no intention eating food all that  advice next door Tom's Urban  Much better service  <EOR> I Shake Shack again! last time Cirque du Soleil's O show time KA show really coincidence! lineup once again really long! wanted eat before show but would least 30 minutes late show  started lining but leave lineup because wasn't moving fast enough order wait food eat run MGM    I wanted order roadside burger family since haven't Shake Shack but ordered wrong burger    Roadside burger black billboard menu time couldn't remember boyfriend tried best ordered seems best burger menu smokeshack Cheeseburger topped all natural applewood smoked bacon chopped cherry pepper ShackSauce   also ordered strawberry milkshake cheese fries    Overall find smokeshack bit salty greasy roadside burger but didn't much  bacon salty but patty sauce really good  surprised find little bit quite spicy I must blind seeing contains chopped cherry pepper! Nevertheless decent burger but favorite still roadside burger! Next time would try 'Shroom Burger Crisp fried portobello mushroom filled melted muenster cheddar cheeses topped lettuce tomato ShackSauce Shack Stack Cheeseburger 'Shroom Burger topped lettuce tomato ShackSauce simply Shack Burger Cheeseburger topped lettuce tomato ShackSauce which seems most popular option   I find strawberry milkshake really average tasted strawberry expected  would order black white milkshake again but strawberry one   Their cheese fries Topped special blend cheddar American cheese sauce REALLY good! really melted cheese I'm picky cheese since don't unmelted ones! Yes texture big difference   don't know why but melted cheese taste much better unmelted cheese don't agree? cheese really flavorful but heavy well fries! would order again but next time would eat before colds down I don't when cheese becomes stiff when stretches ! <EOR> Shake Shack favorite burger!  few locations NYC location Vegas produces same quality food!  also very spacious unlike locations New York   order came fast hot when there       Everything burger good   meat cooked well great flavor   toppings fresh cheese melty   potato bun soft fluffy   love all   nothing special fries but good come hot   shakes die too   love black white shake which combination between vanilla chocolate   also highly recommend peanut butter chocolate shake well great peanut butter flavor   tried custard concrete location which super awesome too   very rich sweet though   couldn't finish whole myself   definitely think place worth try when craving burger strip  <EOR> I now tried Shake Shack twice once San Diego once Vegas  verdict? definitely worth price wait time if still one   really don't understand hype about  ordered fried chicken sandwich time just ok  cut chicken thick cooked well but definitely over flavored wayyyy salty   chicago style hotdog cooked dry bun soggy it broke before finished it   shake way sweet   If overpriced burgers may place you  But In n Out still way better  <EOR> I've waited moment forever! Shake Shack In Outs competition but say both amazing own ways  just cannot choose  Cheese Fries juicy burgers shakes     All food awesome  Even your dogs love it  <EOR> Meh    place ok  best burger fries had  N definitely way better  burgers small super packed    sure why considering burgers mediocre    Woukd recommend? guess but only if you're lazy drive N OUT  <EOR> I came dessert last night  ordered Concretes  ended being more cost efficient share double husband would order two separate singles   My only qualm mix frozen custard ratio  felt weren't many mix ins ends being basically plain frozen custard    As ordering even though line long moves quickly  people extremely friendly service efficient   As expected pretty busy noisy  being said still easy find somewhere sit    I haven't tried other food particular location but when lived east coast  think viable option if you're looking affordable food strip  Everywhere else going lot more expensive  <EOR> I love Shake Shack!  surprising trip Vegas looking forward place most! place gets 5 star order Shack Burger  located off strip near New York New York although lines ridiculously long they're worth it    The menu includes things shakes must crinkly fries all different types burgers  fat self ordered Shack Burger infamous Chick 'n Shack which comes nice chicken patty veggies pickles buttermilk herb mayo! best quick fast food fix that'll leave satisfied  I'd recommend those two hand spun vanilla shake! <EOR> I waiting try place long time  Maybe hype excitement built but actually wasn't all wowed experience Shake Shack  terrible however certainly hits misses  Shake Shack attached New York New York Hotel Casino but park NY NY walk through casino sidewalk LV Blvd enter Shake Shack  Walking inside saw lots heads actually glad getting order to go because seating inside limited  surprised amount customers eating inside line wasn't longer but only customer ahead us  placing order told stand off side near pick area where took reasonable amount time receive food employees helped nice helpful   Chick'n Shack $6 29 Crispy chicken lettuce pickles buttermilk herb mayo potato bun  chicken tasty really liked but shredded lettuce hot wilted didn't taste fresh reminded put McChicken McD's  I'd personally prefer nice crisp piece lettuce instead  recently tried Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken Downtown Summerlin also use shredded lettuce however crisp fresh taste unlike experience SS  buttermilk herb mayo could spread bit heavier because couldn't taste all love mayo chicken sandwiches  sandwich lacking tomato bacon department could even benefited slice cheese all things know now add customized next time if decide give them another try  Downtown Summerlin happens right across BRFC location which pass regularly I'd more likely try if chicken sandwich tweaked liking pay extra add ons way  Extra bacon currently $1 55 which isn't bad considering don't buy drinks just food only  add when buying full meals but usually own fountain drinks stop corner store get    Cheese Fries $3 99 cheese sauce thin hardly flavor  fries themselves just average tasting  personally wouldn't bother fries again   Hubby liked Double Shack Burger but felt wasn't anything special $8 09 wasn't enough bun amount burger  thought looked wrapped lettuce rather bun first glance  Hubby most likely return request but possibly give chicken sandwich try future  <EOR> Looking burger place found YELP! reviews good thought couldn't wrong! Burgers fabulous chicken sandwich delicious! fries fantastically crispy which all Fries should strive be !  Definitely again meal! <EOR> For second trip Las Vegas KNEW try Shake Shack rather typical In N Out everyone to  Conveniently outside New York New York hotel Strip  usually hear there's long line place but luckily didn't line when went! friends pool party birthday needed refuel energy  decided sit long table middle restaurant comfy chairs since ten people group   I ordered Shake Burger fries chocolate milkshake side  Honestly best burger ever tasted! meat cooked perfectly little bit pink juiciness which like  fries shake pretty good also though couldn't finish both them  fries nice crispy texture once take bite little bit salty flavor which like  shake probably rich taste buds which main reason why couldn't finish it   Overall happy ate here  bit pricey everything but would still come back next time Vegas    when visit New York  Whenever is  <EOR> The line door  But don't let stop you  line moves pretty smoothly  burgers pretty good but they're kinda small diameter wise looked sand dollar size thing  double patty burger helped  Fries good   Sadly did par take custards shakes which probably highlight menu  Maybe when feeling going massive sugar high will    So bad  great  If find myself loathing down Strip again wanting fancy burger back  <EOR> Hmm   I excited eat here! Especially try chicken shack  cheeseburger good but chicken didn't come hot cheese wasn't melted  crinkle fries really crispy but nothing special     Both cheeseburger chicken shack really small! definitely don't justify price  paid $21 chicken shack regular cheeseburger order fries large drink    I pretty hungry when came even tho tasted good impressed  Thankfully minimal line if large line like roped off would even more disappointed  already took while food come couldn't imagine waiting even longer  <EOR> Finally tried place hearing many good things but say feels just another burger joint above average prices  friends compared say wins because price taste quality    I ordered shack burger since figured seemed sensible try original burger  When picked looked regular burger no qualities would stand mind  Another thing didn't runny sauce cheese was  bun really soft squishy which weird because am used bread some sort stability  burger tasted alright  more charred taste kind burgers would bbq    The crinkle cut fries actually pretty good brought some redemption lol  crispy which really important because soggy fries just nasty  If going eat unhealthy right!  I didn't try shake time but might come back just check since place called Shake Shack haha  did SHACK A PALOOZA friends which pretty good! only downer pretty small looking price $15 95    Give place shot if near New York New York Hotel area craving some American fast food as if couldn't enough elsewhere   first time opened huge line door but Friday night hardly wait  <EOR> I heard place New York give try  burgers really good here! fries Krinkle cut which big fan but still good  little bit pricey but worth it  would recommend if anyone visiting Vegas try restaurant  <EOR> clean organized delicious pricey compared its comparative in n out  in n out still winner book but gotta try shake shack least once your life able say yourself  great system including vibrating remote let know when your order ready offer alcohol too  indoor outdoor seating available outdoor window if want order quick drink <EOR> Pretty fast many people are  Great food little greasy but pretty great quality  <EOR> Great food great price  relief paying all high strip prices  Very nice outdoor seating area  Only downside ticket system seems bit disorganized  lot incorrect orders  If could more efficient I'd give 5*  <EOR> Ok finally chance review this    trying find right words say because people going crazy over this  just needed time sort thoughts don't kill but must true myself     I prefer over Shake Shack  THERE! said it! much lifted off shoulders  PHEW!  Now let explain horrible place but if put gun head yeah said it    I pref out  major thing bun   feels taste Hawaiian roll   If you're into that then place you   other hand em soft but sweet   always buns extra toasty soft could imagine soggy  2 seconds  type bun would nooks crannies your teeth wouldn't even know but when turn your friends boo would white chewed bun pieces interproximal 6 more places    Fries crinkled reminded middle school  where gonna stay  cheese dried immediately made all them stick together  Flavorless    I'll just drive off strip stick but thanks 2nd meal looking mirror P <EOR> Chicken shack best chicken sandwich hands down  double burger okay  personally am huge burger fan anyway  Though better all other fast food chains  greasy me  love crinkle cut cheese fries  DONT double down fries the cherry peppers does compliment cheese fries but bacon good  Def worth $8 just another chicken shack  <EOR> Simple fresh downright DELICIOUS!!!  already eaten burgers Gordon Ramsey's burGR earlier trip didn't really want eat burgers again but brother highly recommended trying Shake Shack when brother highly recommends something take seriously because takes lot impress him   I hamburger everything juicy tasty all right textures  liked just right amount everything nothing dripping falling out   Everything just perfection greasy dry soggy   veggies use fresh nothing beats hot perfectly salted crinkle fries   husband portabello mushroom burger which interestingly batter fried portabello stuffed oozing cheddar cheese   Although vegetarian option healthy most vegetarian choices other establishments   add oozing portabello mushroom any burger menu   definitely different never seen anything before but bite enough me   very rich    If any room left devouring your tasty burger fries sure try frozen custard   ordered concrete share which peanut butter toffee chocolate bananas it   creamy smooth most importantly sinfully delicious!

Great place vegetarians!!! <EOR> WHACK SHACK  Sorry but place all hype  would rather White Castle better yet In n Out  Smokehouse burger which wasnt juicy all  Meat waaayy lacking flavor  Ordered fries cheese which wasnt bad  drink cold brew  idea iced coffee sounded amazing awful heat  When recieved refreshing beverage horribly disappointed fact dont provide any sort creamer  sure if thats over east coast but pretty unbearable  just sucked chugged chalk water  <EOR> Burgers burgers burgers all around   Heard Shake Shack various food lists decided stop during Vegas trip past weekend   burger delicious? Why yes is!  worth price? really  Perhaps once twice but definitely way pricey is burger fries shake   Which need ordered separately no combo deals    The black white shake supposedly most popular tried that  Wasn't really feeling but then again much shake person   The cheesy fries delicious  Then again cheese anything delicious!   One double burger cheesy fries shake $20   Donate $2 voucher redeem your next visit free shake   Located next New York New York  <EOR> I very looking forward try place  Only greeted very wired person  said hello twice she did responded all thought she muted  No facial reaction all! robot!

We ordered shack stack chicken burger cheese fries bacon  size burgers smaller thought  thought meat chicken bigger  But quite tasty just good expected form see all pictures yelp  cheese fries good but don't give enough cheese sauce cover whole fries  Bottom line worth try but don't expect much  <EOR> I'd only Vegas hour decided shake burger w onions fries Diet Coke served 4 5 minute wait which just fine w very hot delicious!!! little expensive tho fast food meal $12 something tax which drives crazy cus isn't sales tax Oregon but burger very good  never SS burger anywhere else guessing pay more being strip just everything else    <EOR> February 15 2015  First meal Valentine Getaway!  Reason boyfriend planned trip most beloved burger most beloved burger spot New York!   The Shack Burger best! cheese fries most delicious fries ever! also mango lemonade love!   I'm happy finally Shake Shack close California! Granted drive Vegas but close enough right?   FYI came twice before left Vegas last day immediately eating Excalibur Buffet drove right over Burgers GO  Yeah burgers take back California enjoy home  three made home safely without scarfing them down throats! took lot power fight temptations  <EOR> I bacon cheeseburger shack ago dog their rendition Chicago dog   also tried friends' frozen custards cheese fries  food itself quite good employees very friendly  restaurant clean everything pretty much should be  Four stars feel food quite good but excellent    Something missing couldn't put finger on   Regardless check out! <EOR> Maybe little biased Californian but Shake Shack did live its hype    Having eaten Burgr couple days before basic shack burger just good especially burger over 5 bucks  burger dry just great    Cheese fries executed well though  Crinkle fries surprisingly crispy outside but soft inside    Shake Shack's offerings pretty much except burgers little fancier shakes real ice cream   This location does ample seating great staff though  They'd walk collecting trays asking if everything okay  <EOR> 1st time disappointed order chick n shack must say very delicious chicken crispy best can't wait back try shack stack <EOR> I'm disappointed!!

Loved it!! <EOR> This another spot late night snack depending husband feeling eating  Also if kids probably place consider going to    I updated outside next Shake Shack  does look lot nicer since its right stadium now  But during day place gets packed pretty quick  bit difficult find seats when family  But later evenings bad aren't looking open table everyone else  actually prefer coming evening avoid hassle   Service always ok  bad but superb either  other shake shack off strip where extremely nice kids location just ok service    The food always good  always tastes fresh  But times feel burger comes bit sloppy  think husband likes most instead advertisements all locations tv now play games tv more entertaining him  Overall ok  bad great just ok   Yelp 2017 Review Challenge 93 100 <EOR> Delicious food  Try shack hot dog  awesome  wait bit long but overall good experience  <EOR> Dude! Shake Shack good  may sacrilegious say but Shake Shack almost good N Out    Definitely more expensive  sure but you're getting some real high quality burgers   I SmokeShack burger which jam packed bacon cherry peppers delicious Shake Shacksauce  yummy! perfectly satisfying size  However Double Down Fries which dressed exactly burger crinkle cut fries loaded w bacon cherry peppers etc  little underwhelming    know you're thinking  getting them anyway boyfriend's idea! Anyway wish some other crazy fries choose from  <EOR> I hate give Shake Shack anything less 5 stars love burgers shakes but hear out    I used mobile app place order 3 hours ahead time disaster  food wasn't ready until 10 minutes scheduled time even then forgotten shake which added another 3 4 minutes  seems disconnect between mobile app ordering process staff  asked where buzzer explained mobile order looked alien    When did food glorious always! double shack burger Cinnamon Dulce de Leche shake if angels above prepared special just me    I don't want bash beloved Shake Shack but advice steer clear online ordering through app now  It'll faster going through line no matter long is  <EOR> Shake Shack originates Madison Square Park NYC  Anyone familiar chain knows always line because serve great burgers cheese fries shakes  grew N but lived NYC 6 years while don't comparing two both different reasons  Yes Shake Shack more expensive compared N but different burger totally different fries more options shakes malts plus treats your pup     This location outside New York New York hotel same look all other Shake Shacks  There's express line outside drinks only full orders taken inside  There's lots seating inside TV screens all throughout interior  shack burger cheese fries any shakes  won't disappointed  <EOR> This place rage right now located new park area   always line move good speed   Gives time look menu figure want?  stupidly shared delish Shroom Burger fries 24 oz  Brooklyn beer   Why say dumb?  Well didn't know $7 50 Shroom burger would small?  freaking good but normal burger size usually is   Fries okay   did redeem place vanilla custard must try   tried dessert separate day happy did   Found local area opening Shake Shack Palo Alto   hoping prices lower enjoy cheesy veggie burger just melts your mouth  <EOR> As true Californian pains say but    delicious! Don't wrong    still hard core in n out lover but shake shack still very good  know rivalry between two chains but open mind loved it! definitely making trip new LA location when shake shack craving <EOR> Las hamburguesas bastante buenas sin embargo un poco caras para el producto  Lo mejor del restaurant son las malteadas en especial la All Shack tiene un sabor vainilla exquisito  Buena localización en medio del Hotel New York  <EOR> Tried place because see often Instagram feed  can't say much more its all hype  food okay nothing special  house beer though delicious  rather Five Guys Out  Totally worth wait money  shakes overly sweet me  sweet tooth but sweet couldn't drink it  pretty place but nothing rave about  Maybe need try New York? <EOR> All drinking gambling clubbing hungry  You're gonna want this    more when you're drunk  But still good when you're sober    Do dare say fries better N fries?!?! think just did  California's gonna hate me    Portion size just enough if shake hopefully brought friend or maybe even just met dance floor because those filling! coming back! <EOR> Food good  Ordered original cheeseburger smoke shack burger cheese fries beer float + peanut butter shake    Maybe just fatty but honestly       the portions SMALL here  burgers all around $5 7 but size palm could eat them 3 bites    I came experience though  wanted see hype all about  Maybe New York better??? taste very good though  just crowded portions small    BUT peanut butter shake good  wish came bigger cup!!! beer float just okay   my friend just ate custard mmmm! <EOR> Boom!   Great burgers good hot crinkle cut French Fries milk shakes!  place would 5 stars if menu items just little less expensive  I ordered shack burger fries regular size diet coke small shake almost $20  <EOR> Shake Shack seems more buzz its worth but if looking just good burger worth visit    I am fan burgers general hungry was  ordered ShackBurger cheese fries  awesome  patty practically melts your mouth  hardly put down just kept taking bite bite until devoured  krinkle fries also very good    This touristy area Park near T Mobile arena  vibe fun games front great people watching  Its slightly back street don't feel overly crowded    Getting line but moves quickly  Drinks self serve except beer wine take care of  order pager flashes buzzes your pick up  Pretty easy process actually but know want order time register because no menu over head most places  actually entrance line front door   Food good atmosphere fun open  would come back if staying NY NY hotels adjacent  <EOR> Great restaurant really nice seating ambiance just am really fan ordered    I shack stack which deep fried portobello mushroom  burger patty  much hype mind cause love mushroom burgers but didn't really appeal much cheese filling mushroom might little overwhelming    I ordered cheese fries didn't enjoy them much  guess cheese just wasn't really looking for  Higher quality cheese your average cheese fries but texture flavors weren't favorite    The strawberry shake most basic shakes but super amazing! Great shake they better right cause name! overly sweet texture point little pieces fruit    Great spot!!! lot seating available very modern design place cool place eat just really into burger cheese fries  <EOR> I looking forward trying place but pleasantly surprised    I smoke burger which awesome loved bacon cheese fries  While did appreciate selections beer available enjoyed most concrete frozen custard  good back second night late night snack   The only reason place 4 instead 5 tables dirty  But luckily wetnaps just wiped table ourselves  <EOR> I heard much hype amazing Shake Shack being California girl always felt left out  instant saw Shake Shack driving down Strip only thing could think about   I knew try chance!!!  Couple hours later line very happy veggie options portobello mushroom burger cheese fries  buzzer rang food immediately struck portions being definitely smaller side paid 10+ bucks thought let's see if taste sizes long story short left underwhelmed  The burger self decent flavor very cheesy portobello stuffed cheese but buns threw off looked very cheap dry veggies inside didn't seem fresh  cheese fries good covered velveeta like substance spectacular any way shape form but good passable would say word describe them  In summary place VERY overhyped eating loads  Super Duper Burgers   Shake Shack nothing esp  Super Duper Burgers  If want spend $10 burger meal 100% Super Duper Burgers if you're San Francisco Bay Area see real quality burger meal tastes garlic fries see cheesy fries should really taste  <EOR> I don't mind burgers small but mind paying much charge small burger  way quality SPECTACULAR  Everything fresh prepared neatly really good flavor  great selection menu love cheese fries shakes well! always fun dining in  <EOR> I hype here? Being NYC person now resides San Diego taste both Coasts fast food   This place hyped people only guess making McDonalds comparison  Habit just good if better  Actually Habit more offerings seams fresher   Fried hot dogs $4? Gray Papaya NYC 2 $2 blow away  loaded hot dog could barely eat soggy first bite toppings plate  tasty? guess but again nothing ground breaking here  simple hot dog   It fairly low cost Vegas but no way would way find place anywhere else   Hambergers? Nothing special all even toppings  Bacon cheese? Wendy's 20 years  Hot dogs? guess creating creative name Flat Top let's charge $4 it  Nothing more then hot dog    Fries? Remember those crinkle fries your Mom used instead getting ones wanted McDonalds? Well them   Concrete? poor replica Blizzard DQ 2xs price   People before claims something being best actually world some real world tasting    This 20 something new overgrown beard hasn't clue good food is  feeling place developed boardroom same bearded group nothing actually providing Best Burger     Good deal Vegas but then again burgers cost $17 other stores  <EOR> I see hype food place  average burgers kind small  meat thin does lot seasoning  enjoyed cheese fries but melted Kraft cheese top  Even cheese bacon burger sauce  Wisconsin cheddar cheese burger  However cheese melted slice  sauce fondue bottle even warm  Overall would come back unless N closed  <EOR> Burgers Fantastic!  While believe burgers generally fantastic Shake Shack nails quick serve fast food burger   double SmokeShack Fries wife double fries two 32oz beers in souvienier cups $53   Yes price bit high but talking Las Vegas Strip half price 64oz Dos Equis   wasn't much line when arrived but dining room packed   waited table able snag before food came people weren't lingering tables don't let crowded place scare away   If haven't tried Shake Shack thinking your typical fast food burger joint Inn n Dicks Seattle try its whole other level! <EOR> This first visit Shake Shack delish great flavor   Heads burgers cooked medium UNLESS requested moist flavorful pretty affordable being right strip   Would come again zero hesitation  <EOR> Shake Shack?

Overall Shack Shake somewhat comparable In n Out  However still love In n Out because lot cheaper still just good! <EOR> Tried shake shack London which didn't impress  Heard ones America much better just try while Vegas   After 2 days n would say burger shake shack more impressive juicier patties shack stack which ordered most succulent deep fried portobello mushroom ever had!  The shakes  ordered peanut butter shake which creamy fragrant having peanut butter right jar but smoother sweet  Definitely better milkshakes had   In comparison n overall would definitely choose shake shack anytime  enough burgers trip but glad ended off shake shack  still haven't found burger totally awed but close enough! <EOR> WHERE'S BEEF? After insipid unimpressive burger admitted Vegas friends dipped toe into phenomenon Shake Shack  man all panned place  burgers small bland! Much better options In N Out even Gordon Ramsey's   WHERE'S BEEF? The ordering process cumbersome  Unlike In N Out cashiers can't expedite huge lines because way many options many need explaining aren't enough POSs  Worse food and others sat cold 6 minutes serving manager handled customer complaint   and no fountain refills! <EOR> Finally eat here! first heard online seeing celebrities posting mouth watering pictures Instagram big fan N although lived 12 years easily say burger better N opinion   located right next Tom's Urban which lot more helpful follow saying Starbuck's   don't think location great locals live Las Vegas Blvd but quite strip think would stop coming often   Also although burger shake tasty fries nothing special   5 Guys fries better think place pricey   came friend both shakes burgers order fries came $26   If off strip may still again definitely disappointing  <EOR> this crap  people stupid think anything but decent  biggest let down stay east coast where flavor must resemble sewer water  <EOR> I excited finally try Shake Shack!

Highly recommend if burgers modern fast casual restaurants  usually super into crinkle fries but crispy delicious especially when dipped cheese! Shack Attack concrete also better expected  Those chocolate chunks like <EOR> Like few others also don't hype over Shake Shack considering west coast plethora restaurants offering delicious burgers varying price points flavor quality   I ordered double hamburger no bun tend find bun takes away flavor delicious burger  burger patties pretty small see photo requested extra tomatoes only received total 3 small slices  shacksauce wasn't memorable ended excluding burger  Sometimes think hmm maybe just didn't order right thing but then remind myself if plain hamburger lackluster then probably shouldn't menu  crinkle fries ordered well done tasty but still prefer thin cut fries especially shoestring!   skipped shakes didn't deem them worth extra calories friends didn't consuming them   Overall employees friendly there's plenty seating indoors well patio area  line appears long but moves fairly quickly actual turnaround time your meal less you'd expect  I'd still prefer In n Out SoCal SuperDuper Burgers SF because sauce delicious fries crispy flavorful burger meat stands out  <EOR> This great hamburger place strip!

I just might better then N Out  <EOR> We wandered over Shake Shack watching show across street NYNY hotel   restaurant located ground level   Luckily wasn't line 9 30 pm   menu quite large hard choose all goodies   ordered single ShackBurger small Abita root beer   paying handed pager secure table   only table available close entrance where cold wind would blow people came went    After short wait food ready pick counter   burger delicious   Each bite better last   ShackSauce savory umami note   Abita root beer really tasty   made Louisiana cane sugar spring water Louisiana   would try other items menu next time visit but since eaten earlier evening only wanted late night snack   Shake Shack real deal  <EOR> The best way experience Las Vegas food just small cheaper chains   You're better off saving your money spending expensive buffets     We came long day drinking pool parties   great way let loose   no means healthy but if you've left pool party no else left impress   Houston still yet first Shake Shack still crave used chase down N Out   always mushroom cheeseburger only way go   actually cookies cream shake disappointed   Hopdoddy reigns supreme that   far fries just plain fries don't superloaded ones ruined tiny cut peppers  <EOR> I wish Shake Shack neighborhood because best burger shake EVER had  staff super friendly restaurant clean well organized absolutely love! <EOR> If you've never Shake Shack you're definitely missing best cheeseburgers you'll ever have  most tasty juicy burger ever had  Highly recommend place EVERYONE  <EOR> It month since left Vegas still cannot stop talking Shake Shack  coming home returning In n Out down street home California WISH could replace Shake Shack instead    Although little pricey compared n Out quality ingredients taste worth it  knew simple burger fries could mouthwatering?  I came twice during vacation know going first stop when return Vegas  know some people obsessed eating Earl's Sandwiches? Well love Shake Shack similar but better  <EOR> So finally pleasure indulging coveted Shake Shack!  particular location very open plenty seating throughout   plenty menu choose your appetite should satisfied   did try hot dogs although did look tasty but smoke shack burger   cheeseburger applewood smoked bacon   also cherry peppers add depth flavor   sure type bun use but perfect it!  The only thing really didn't care shake sauce    I'd much prefer other popular burger place sauce     Ps   Did mention serve beer wine!!!! <EOR> I came Saturday around 1 00pm line wasn't crazy   came 8 girls stood line 20 minutes which fairly reasonable   order your food grab buzzer find seat   only problem place such high demand delicious burgers but hardly any seats since place always packed   Luckily scoping place found some seats right outside restaurant down stairs warm sun!  I wasn't hungry friend shared chicken sandwich which very crispy juicy tender   Lots good flavor   also tried bite shake stack delicious but never compare n Out   always number one   Im glad opened LA don't drive 4 hours burgers!  fries also delicious!  Ask sauce dip away!! <EOR> The burger very good flavor   crinkle cut fries nothing special   shake pretty good   All $16 just good value opinion   would first place think grab lunch  <EOR> This place kinda pricey just burger but don't problem spending $10 burger good  double BBQ burger da bomb! concrete shack attack wasn't best some flavor mint try something else next time but all all food pricey but good! <EOR> First time trying Shake Shack when Vegas worth it! SmokeShack cheese melted just right burger  different taste then other normal burger joints meat patty flavorful sweet bun  Also tried cheese fries   the crinkle cut fries ok but hot melted cheese top made better    Only downside busy day good luck trying find seat  Once order you're your own find seat table  took 15 minutes find table 3 share two other people  Let's hope your food comes find table  <EOR> A lot people try compare place N out  IMO shack shack good 1 day tired but N could eat several times week  place could really break bank    I spent around $27 00  smoke shack stack shack chocolate mint shake  always tounge twisted  burgers  stack shack fried portebello mushroom single burger  double smoke shack  smoke comes two burgers top delicous bacon  shake ok   Overall should check place out  also chiken burgers hot dogs cheese fries many different types shakes  If your vegas just swing because its worth it  <EOR> I love burgers  doesn't? Americans proud American staple rightly so  According statistics Americans eat 3 burgers week  total 50 billion burgers year   right fifty billion    Why Americans obsessed hamburger patty between two buns? Well don't far figure out  Just read through reviews yelp articles naming 10 best burger places  single common denominator no reason everyone own opinion why prefer burger    As share burgers  may eat average 3 burgers week but know similar billions burger consumers world    Which brings Shake Shack  Since New York burger joint gone public lot more buzz surrounding burgers  serve more just burgers such hot dogs but core business burgers  also some pretty good shakes hear made custard ice cream    Their only location west Las Vegas but hear plan expand into LA market 2016  Fortunately happen Vegas brother's wedding took opportunity see if burger would willing add burger diet    First thing noticed when walked into Shack many offerings menu  addition burger options section shakes custard ice cream well alcohol which included beer wine    I wasn't interested other distractions focused burgers  ordered double cheese  comes two decent size patties tomato leaf lettuce soft bun shack sauce  Onions included    The size patties caught off guard  bigger expected bit greasy  paper which burger wrapped soaked grease  patties nice outer crust  shack sauce nowhere found  couldn't tell whether liked because flavor missing  did soft bun but would preferred toasted  All all thought burger okay but bit pricey    The fries good  wrinkle shape crispiness  also cheese add option    I'm sure if offer refills drinks weren't any self serve drink stations    For burger fries small drink costs $14  definitely isn't something would eat regular basis given price point but something would eat occasionally  <EOR> I've Shake Shack once before Brooklyn   OK NOTHING compared n Out!   We decided stop quick bite eat Saturday night  located outside NYNY  Indoor outdoor seating   Inside somewhat clean  Pedestrian only access    Line somewhat long instead waiting line decided order online via Shake Shack app  ordered crispy chicken sandwich fries  app easy use   approximately 20 minutes received notification food ready    I walked pick area waited    and waited    and waited    and waited    and waited    and waited    for approximately 15 minutes until order finally called  lady working pick area kind rude could tell she little overwhelmed     My meal nothing special  hot taste just any ole fast food joint     No offense but probably never come back Shake Shack long don't to  <EOR> We ordered shack stack shack burger crinkle cut fries shack cago dog  most part everything amazing  Quality cleanliness quick lines  burgers moist melted cheese juicy patties  cago dog also amazing crinkle cut fries just right amount crispiness well  But only giving place 3 stars tiny portions high price pay  paid more $10 tiny burger Portobello mushroom wedged inside  feel more satisfied full $3 $4 In N Out burger food comes much quicker  food came decently quick but cago dog took long  shack burger quite wait most original thing order menu  Would come again? Sure! Would come again if In N Out nearby? Probably not  <EOR> Food 5 5 Service 5 5 Cleanliness 5 5 Decor Style 5 5  I really enjoy Vegas location more even New York location  Same great food Brooklyn Beer wait isn't freaking long Madison Square Park  Spacious fast service  <EOR> Food great! Probably best burger places to  I'd give 5 star but girl counter sending orders both rude unprofessional  messing order came back counter she accused trying play game her  She failed correct second time came back she rolled eyes said Can't see busy? NEVER disrespected someone serving especially since point always treat others way I'd treated  very disappointing see location employee representing establishment  Overall great food  Definitely don't miss it  Hopefully review help management take proactive action improving customer service  <EOR> First heard Shake Shack while New York 2 years ago finally try Vegas all places   Stopped just lunch hour Saturday   Place pretty busy football games playing all tvs   stand line place order   Line moved quickly able find seat communal tables   The burgers took bit longer typical fast food joint   give buzzer pick tray counter   Even though buzzer off still took additional few minutes tray     So thoughts ShackBurger?  Pretty damn good   Its pretty typical smaller cheeseburger w lettuce tomato then there's ShackSauce    burger   Don't know what's but could see myself craving it     Cheddar Bacon Fries Another standard favorite but fries crispy cheese bacon better quality   Glad couple LA because need repeat visit  <EOR> QUICK SUMMARY Overpriced Innout burgers worth price NYC locations but worth here  If you're already order Concrete    What happened Shake Shack? Vegas location all disappointment nothing past  trying Shake Shack NYC fell love  know high definition TV inside shows really glamorous images Shake Shacks around world? exactly felt NYC  restaurant elegant customers all beautiful everyone happy friendly  Vegas felt typical fast food hamburger joint nice attempt being more but nonetheless fell short  staff behind counter seemed annoyed indecisive customers amount time taking them place orders Yes know CES week sure none customers line Shake Shack before probably spoke English second language but no excuse rude    I don't know did deserve but hamburger came FLAT  wish taken picture the fact didn't take picture meant really Instagram worthy   if someone squished burger came together   The fries good crispy salt less side  A+ those   I hope new Summerlin location better because LV Blvd location needs some work  See NYC Shake Shack!

Because there's always line anytime during day  If special player's card separate line  Perks being baller guess   I've tried single shake burger chick'n stack fries  patties actually decent sized don't feel need double meat  burgers pretty simple lettuce tomato cheese sauce  If choose between burger chicken I'd definitely burger  chick'n stack $7 reminded Burger King's chicken sandwich  worth it  Stick burger fries  fries hit miss but if happen fresh batch they're really good!  Besides typical burgers much more options menu  Hotdogs cheese fries custards etc  Must room next time try infamous concretes  Can't way New York just yet but thank goodness LV but two locations now! <EOR> WOW!

Highly recommend! <EOR> I little hesitant try Shake Shack since heard many mixed reviews friends previously went  really can't pass place hyped just see myself  particular Shake Shack located New York New York  Although prices doesn't really justify everything connected Casino always little pricier normal  arrived 5 00pm Saturday  line pretty long but fairly quickly   Double Shack Burger $7 99 Double patty cheese lettuce tomatoes shack sauce  burger pretty good we also starving day club   nothing special but flavors different others tasted   Crinkle Cut Fries $2 95 heart lies in n out fries = am fan thicker cut french fries   Strawberry Milkshake $5 25 If there's thing Shake Shack knows right    strawberry milkshake!! Price steep but absolutely perfect shake! Right consistency sweetness level strawberries  strawberries didn't taste processed overly sweet compared In n out! If don't want burger least grab milkshake! +1 star itself yummy concoction  <EOR> Great food   good price! would better if offer complete meal menu  Burger fries drink purchased separately  all tasted good though! love when first tried New York  love Vegas too! <EOR> First time BOMB! meat cooked right cheese melts your mouth  doesn't come fries but worth it! shakes amazing! back another next time <EOR> Great food  Great prices for strip   Line long but moved fast  wait seat but eventually before food available pickup  around 8 30 pm Sunday night Labor Day weekend   Wife shared Shack Stack burger cheese fries  complementary water  Burger really great  Portobello loaded cheese popped when cut half  Meat cooked just right  Wife did cheese fries did  am happy Shack Shack coming Downtown Summerlin  <EOR> I've only tried shakes tasty service slower I'd wish but busy because popular  <EOR> Delicious burgers!  We ordered bacon other mushrooms bacon  Both really great flavorful juicy sauce tasty  <EOR> Yelp challenge 2017 5 100   So now know all hype about! feel secretly war everyone East Coast because In N Out but humbled  Once walking noticed large wall explains specialty burgers fries shakes  immediately eyes fell love shake shake stack burger nestled fried cheese party all burger fixins  Also then bacon cheese fries    We took seat waited creations surprisingly helped pretty fast considering Las Vegas location  burgers dropped off table side took look know going delicious  cheese fries crispy buried under cheesy fondue crispy salty pieces bacon  Along fries burger taste couldn't compare any perfectly charred burger under all loads fries melted cheese magical! <EOR> The food pretty good  Baja chicken sandwich really good  tots fries cold but when arrive ten min before closes <EOR> Always good come shake shack  missed burger since moved back Philadelphia 2013  burgers yummy always   <EOR> A New York burger joint New York New York? Rather creative if ask me  But worth hype? No all   After hearing Shake Shack opening Vegas practically begged cousins eat early dinner just see fuss all about   Shake Shack follows order and pickup routine  other words brace yourself long lines! new addition Strip certainly draw some crowds both locals tourists during peak season  During visit line pretty fast wasn't terribly long  However time left line already heading door   I ordered Shack Burger single   fairly average most part  Nothing really stood out  did buttery buns but other wouldn't recommend burger itself   We also shared orders cheese fries  personally enjoyed cheese fries  cheese sauce creamy tasty  did notice weren't given much cheese other pictures posted Yelp which may due shortage cheese sauce few unhappy customers complaining when leaving establishment but any more cheese would've overwhelming  fries itself mind blowing but compliment burger nonetheless   I also strawberry malted milkshake  Just burger fairly standard  No artificial strawberry flavor which nice  However definitely better milkshakes   Price wise quite expensive  single Shack Burger cheese fries strawberry milkshake past $10 mark which pricey quality portions get   In conclusion awesome they've opened NY burger joint Vegas New York New York keep tradition  But if don't know expect don't excite yourself  may disappointed end result   I most likely return  <EOR> Um someone say best burgers ever? think found new favorite burger joint but all way Las Vegas! There's nothing place California  burgers definitely better ones In N Out!  My husband shared burger fries salted caramel hot chocolate very pleased purchase! burger tasted super fresh gobbled matter seconds because good! fries equally delicious become husband's favorite fries!  Unfortunately did shake cannot comment shakes but highly recommend stop burger lunch meal! <EOR> The burgers fries pretty good definitely better your usual fast food burger  only knocking star because when visited several items menu which made ordering awkward event standing long line  <EOR> After long walk Vegas Strip stopped dinner knew needed try famous burgers before flying back home  wanted try variety items ordered ShackBurger SmokeShack Chick'n Shack Chocolate Milkshake Shack Attack    I enjoyed all items but favourites would Shack Attack chocolate y goodness! ShackBurger which original burger typically see social media  portions huge ingredients good quality fresh  Shack sauce which added each burger must try!

Brewed Brooklyn Brewing popped Untappd pale ale    uhhh no  didn't taste anything pale ale least we're more familiar west coast  tasted light lager  Boyfriend said reminded Dos Equis    Take will  Wouldn't order again   The line wraps around inside but when around 3pm Friday reached just front door  wait 15 minutes front counter where placed order  wait food maybe another 10 minutes   The service mess orders here  lot  table behind orders messed overheard messed order well  originally ordered 32oz Shackmeister ale share w bf    but server rang 16oz despite verbally repeating order again clarifying wanted 32 oz  What'd get? 16 oz  It's okay though  he actually ended saving bc beer wasn't good anyway   sure if intentional but also gave 2 cheese fries instead 1 ordered  making other 16oz beer didn't give us?

Ok     not your home but surely provide FLAVOR SATISFACTION!  dying try Shake Shack since fiance visited Las Vegas without few months ago glad finally squeeze some time stop recent visit   I ordered Shack Stack which combination vegan burger stuffed portobello mushroom top signature patty   Don't judge me    it first experience wanted BIG!  boo insisted ordering cheese fries know don't argue when comes cheese  *heart eye emoji*  For busy night strip didn't wait long   burgers ready 5 10 minutes   mean whole army behind counter cooking!  portobello mushroom fried nicely great crispy outer layer while still remaining moist inside   cheese filled center absolutely delicious!  Crinkle cut fries favorite   Cover creamy cheese sauce am happy girl!  Finally house made shandy perfect touch enjoying burgers hot Las Vegas heat!    The prices kind high but restaurant strip reasonable   Don't plan share portion sizes just enough  <EOR> I'm big fan Shake Shack  qualities burgers shakes offered fair price  excited Shake Shack closer west coast   I always order Shake Shack Stack  best both worlds burger patty mushroom patty nicely sandwiched between buttery bun   Be warn usually line establishment  <EOR> I'm sure if Postmates issue Shake Shack's but considering all Postmates pick drop off going lean towards SS   I ordered custom concrete fries Shack Stack  fries Shack Stack fine burger nice juice bread soft cheese gooey fries nice crisp  concrete though? Completely melted Shake Shack roughly 2 6 miles office  Even if driver delayed little bit shouldn't melt completely during 7 minute drive according Postmates   top melted literally only filled half cup  Shouldn't concrete last thing made preserve temperature? Well guess lucky forgot napkins utensils  ended having drink concrete   To clear wasn't much food but way food brought me  <EOR> what order shack double burger cheese fries tip ASK ONIONS!! love onions don't ask wasn't aware option   FINALLY! try infamous East coast version n Out    really good very tasty surprisingly filling but n heart  also really liked modern decor decorating! Very nice   Shake Shack much bigger menu would love try other items but simple double party cheeseburger  also cheese fries regular fries   The cheese fries good  boyfriend said cheesy taste but cheesy doesn't exist world   The double patty burger looks small but quite filling  love onions burger decided ask if any half way through surprisingly do! just don't ask if would your burger like n does Basically fancy fast food  Shake Shack good but can't eat often n Out  <EOR> Finally!!!!! able try burger everyone raving about  better place it? Las Vegas course   We ordered Shake Shack cheeseburger  Love way package orders    First bite says all  Its texture soft right away chewing knew burger good quality beef very good  bun excellent  However couldn't taste lettuce tomato couldn't tell if burger sauce spread  could taste overpowering salt  meat cheese caused saltiness?   All all good quality burger  loved bun soft warm texture bit pricey but it  Overall way better Five Guys yuck but still winner  Habit close second  IMO    I definitely try Shack Burger again Los Angeles  and give fries shake taste too!  Now try Wahlburgers       <EOR> Would say place comparable N Out? answer NO! Although place probably considered fast food quality  just good sit down restaurant   Shroom Burger vegetarian burger  meat replaced portobello mushroom  some added cheese entire thing then battered fried until crispy  Mmm Mmm GOOD! am sucker fried stuff place does right  outside mushroom super crispy but  super oily which slightly better health   If decide try BEWARE hot cheese when biting into burger because stuff seriously burns!  Fries I am sucker thin crunchy fries unfortunately shake shack's version crinkle fry which more potato  very impressed but case based personal preference    Frozen Custard I chance sample spoonful friend's frozen custard flavors  them vanilla pretty good definitely tasted better Wendy's freezie  Whereas another person S'more's flavor  just alright eyes because just all chocoate graham cracker crumbs top  Personally liked vanilla more two   Final Verdict first time eaten something Shroom Burger unless find better variation keep coming back! <EOR> We decided try establishment because saw some Facebook posts saying burgers worth long wait  But frankly don't understand hype all about  overpriced average tasting overcooked burgers may satiate appetite midget fashion model but 9 yr old daughter still hungry burger   what's krinkle cut fries? last time saw those school cafeteria served people wearing hair nets  kicks pants place hands down big fan either  <EOR> THANK AGAIN VEGAS FOOD GOD!  First gave Earl Sandwhich  now    Shake Shack!!!  Shake Shack New York's version California's kinda    considered fast food joint but burgers bit more gourmet the bun squishy soft noms    Shake Shack also bit more hefty wallet fast food place     I ate meal Shake Shack New York 2011 seriously daydreamin' eating again someday   Someday came when randomly 3 hour layover Vegas few weeks ago boom!  took cab which quadruple price meal roundtrip recreate love first bite   say love crazy things   If you're Vegas experience little bit New York order ShackBurger Cheese Fries STRAWBERRY custard shake  Don't tempted other flavors   strawberry!  if fall victim ordering something else don't say didn't warn you    Just heads up   this meal 1500 calories $23 00 ish     Fat belly skinny wallet   but worttttth it  <EOR> The perfect place guilty pleasures  nice classic burger fries delicious shake satisfies any craving  tasty classic treat! <EOR> Fabulous!  Burgers good!  bit wait food but  okay   Cheese fries good but soggy fast   Black white malt great!  someone offer refills sodas she took tray us   ate twice while town   going miss place when back home  <EOR> I'm originally East Coast   I should leaning more towards Shake Shack   but don't know!  In own respect Shake Shack good albeit little bit pricey side   I Single Shack Cheeseburger fries 50 50 aka Arnold Palmer    The fries   meh  Tasted freshly fried frozen fries  better   The Arnold Palmer probably worst thing ever had   The burger good  That bun tho  bun  For price paid wish little heftier  But meat really good veggies fresh   But gotta say In n Out wins over everything  <EOR> It's almost good New York   Crinkle Cuts Concretes!  I craving some comfort food team took narrow loss season ended headed Shake Shack  asked bunch people  directions nobody noted entrance outside casino but now you'll know suffer same misery walking circles 15 minutes   Once arrived saw medium size line nothing compared normal Madison Square Park line though could handle it  also noted C Line non hot food  differs B Line original et Shakes    Once ordered food similar level used MSP location  only weakness burger which tasted just little bit off but couldn't figure exactly why  Even day later still can't seem figure off burger  only finished 3 4 before moved Crinkle Cut fries which  just good recall happen favorite thing Shake Shack   Finally Shake Attack  concrete spot on  chocolate hazelnut custard special week subbed normal chocolate custard delicious   Now bad  Vegas priced seems more New York  Secondly staff though friendly just don't seem same order taking efficiency New York  Maybe fault since most people going location aren't regulars but definitely noticeable   Will back? Yes next time Vegas stop concrete crinkle cut fries    Is still worth original Madison Square Park location Flatiron? Yes because nothing beats Shake Shack park  <EOR> While Vegas stopped twice mushroom burger delicious  Fries good if I'd back probably wouldn't cheese fries  custard delicious Elvis custard forgot called but good  forks fries cute too  <EOR> East Coast versus West Coast  Pac versus Biggie   Gotham versus City Angels   now add onto list N versus Shake Shack   other comparisons no real winner   all really depends your mood   Shake Shack great because burgers cooked smashing patty onto griddle letting develop nice charred crust  meat star burger   toppings average   bun itself soft but could really use some extra toast borrowing N terminology    standout item am sure everyone knows Shake Stack     tremendous construction breaded cheesy mushroom patty stacked top regular meat patty   If really want gang busters add bacon nominal fee side note really don't give damn if thinks processed meats causes cancer   cheese fries worthy companion   I would remiss if did toss two cents regarding wins comparison between beloved N Shake Shack   Shack wins superior meat patty option add bacon glorious mushroom patty   N better quality  ingredients customization options e g  toasted buns grilled onions chopped peppers    Taking whole experience eating N burger really greater sum its parts   Where may lacking Shake Shack n Out's je ne sais quoi keeps equal footing   So where does leave you?

While menus seem similar burgers similar sizes size offerings quality taste both another level   As born raised SoCal girl heart forever love In N Out  There's nothing classic #3 hamburger protein style animal style fries chocolate shake  But desserts hold candle Shake Shack's epic frozen treats menu  Shake Shack admittedly more extensive menu prices compare In N Out's affordable menu    Overall head Shake Shack more menu options great flavor taste but if you're looking simple classic tasty options best value then In N Out way go  <EOR> Best burger place hands down!!!!  My entire family obsessed!!! haven't anything don't like  Cheese fries die for!! <EOR> What's all hype?  I watch lot CNBC  within context hearing lot Shake Shack recent months  hype curious  but am going travel CA East Coast hamburger   while Las Vegas made deliberate trip Shake Shack location Strip New York New York casino property   I visited Saturday night 11 00pm  place packed surprise  kitchen staff active staff constantly clean dining room accommodate turnover patrons   décor very nice modern bright very inviting  location both indoor outdoor seating  patio misting system cool outdoor dining area   Since knew nothing chain stuck basics ordered Double Shack Burger cheese standard fries vanilla milk shake   The vanilla shake very good vanilla milk shake  cannot say best ever but poor definitely better mediocre   The French fries offering French fries crinkle cut variety  When served French fries hotter warm  but piping hot  surprised  Based rate which kitchen turning orders would thought fries would freshly hot   warm flaky inside just slight crunch surface  disappointed  but impressed either   The Shack Burger am sure some story hamburger bun  first thing noticed upper lower halves conjoined clam shell  standard double burger two patties cheese lettuce tomato along signature sauce  hamburger nice hot  surprising since fries not  beef juicy flavorful   All all very good hamburger     But while eating Shack Burger flavor palate reminded another burger eaten  Then struck Shack Burger's tastes lot In and Out burger  flavors Shack Burger bit lighter strong but resemblance there   The total bill meal little over $17 00  If wanted same combo In and Out cost meal would $7 00  All said good hamburger  location very nice if already Strip seeking eating options  just don't understand all hype chain  <EOR> I born New York currently reside Las Vegas   can't imagine Shake Shack getting any review less 5 stars!  If allowed I'd give hundred stars location!  First off if Mlife platinum member don't wait long line luckily if show your card door you'll your own!  Then when counter greeted extremely nice personable cashier named Michael   Patient knowledgeable burgers hot dogs he kindly took order   truly wanted tip but every which way he refused accept it!  receiving order pick station selecting table nicely greeted Dorian whom believe busser perhaps   He extremely attentive all tables very observant towards everyone's needs!  He kept all tables really clean very sincere personable too   far excellent customer service overall!    Now food prefer double meat patties because really taste freshly grilled flavor meat   If your burger some kick options accommodate your taste   Also they're shakes really tasty too   If you're full yet which truly doubt must try extremely smooth frozen custard   really delicious yummy ending your experience there! <EOR> As disclaimer never NYC location  first time trying chain  just every major fast food hamburger fries  name In Out Fatburger FiveGuys Culvers SteaknShake Whataburger etc   I am giving experience fast food burger category 5 stars  service prompt  Shackburger double melted mouth  All ingredients complementary each other bun burger condiments Umami   strawberry shake right on plus love crispy crinkle fries  back! hope stand alone building near Eastern don't drive strip! <EOR> Can't place !! Burgers amazing cheese fries die for   If don't want cheeseburger try fried chicken sandwich equally amazing  <EOR> There wasn't anything special burgers sure shack sauce taste because pickled peppers burger over powered any other flavor spent most time spitting pepper seeds   cheese fries good  <EOR> I actually enjoyed cheeseburger  friend let try fries liked it  ended finishing fries  isn't favorite burger place but definitely beats johnny rockets  <EOR> Our first time eating shake shack delicious! think better n out! big fan crinkle fries! <EOR> Visiting Vegas EDC weekend group trying figure eat lunch  heard lot friends talk Shake Shack decided give try   The Shake Shack really nice contemporary vibe many seating areas inside out    I cheese burger bacon cheese fries bacon top   The burger really good  much flavor it  wanna say almost equally good In N Out Burgers  saying something   The reason loss star because ordered ice cream cone but given chocolate shake instead  Normally wouldn't problem but also ordered drink  basically two drinks   But overall great place eat especially if you're drunk recovering hangover night before  <EOR> Fresh delicious GMO free all great price point   My favorite Smoke Stack!!! Oh hello cherry peppers!!

Excuse while wipe away drool     And back     Customer Service good too! Those working counters aren't rude rushing take your order other establishments    The Shackmeister Ale also tasty which brewed Brooklyn Brewery    This review could much love Shake Shack brand but end hopefully convinced just much should fly your nearest Shake Shack believe SoCal nearest location Hawaii  coming further west let's hope Hawaii next destination list  <EOR> I'm big in and out fan everyone always compares to but definitely fan place well  wanted cheeseburger but also wanted mushroom burger guess what? called Shack Stack  Uhm  Score! FYI mushroom fried combination cheeseburger shack sauce amazing  burger really good but fried mushroom best part  Unfortunately ate before going day club but burgers aren't big that's actually unfortunate news    Overall fan! fries shakes really good well! <EOR> My friends told place all hype  burgers pretty small expensive  ordered double smoke shack pretty okay  don't think worth maybe just try  also jackpot custard pretty good well  bit busy crowded but able find seats   Cool place hype if you're visiting Vegas but idk if come back  <EOR> Came lunch morning sightseeing stroll friends  Right when walk receive menu look while wait line which better zoning staring large menu board while line moves you're still   just staring   I ordered Shack Stack which cheese burger Shroom burger top deep fried portabella mushroom filled muenster cheddar cheese lettuce tomato its Shacksauce  Plus order crinkle fries   It wasn't large circumference wise burger but packed thick  fried portabella very good especially two cheeses oozing out  But ate very very rich heavy when add flavorful juicy cheeseburger underneath  needed lot ketchup balance burger out  still very delicious though! best part burger bread because outside soft inside very crispy stayed way throughout which amazing sauce gooey cheese   Seeing crinkle fries hesitant automatically see them those store bought frozen kind where throw oven end result mushy fries super hard dry tasteless fries  sure frozen once but fries super good!

Plus fries nice crispy fresh friendly staff  bit busy when arrive but still managed awesome food  burgers looked delicious wished little more room squeeze taste  <EOR> The rivalry between Shake Shack N real! always heard place really good but now tried wow its pretty bomb!  Their menu larger more options but still simple easy navigate  ordered Smoke Shack Shack Stack which basically Cheeseburger fried stuffed portabello mushroom  Omg yassss both bomb! If want something spicy Smoke Shack but if want experience greatness Shack Stack to! course gotta crinkle cut fries  perfectly crispy love it!   Besides food tried shakes cold brew coffee yes would highly recommend all it! Obviously better ingredients comes steeper price which fair  best way describe place midway between gourmet burgers fast food  high quality ingredients yeah none ice berg lettuce garbage decent sized servings fair price  N food tastes just amazing because spread sauce use but budget  If you're willing spend $5 10 more meal I'd choose otherwise just can't taste price N Out! <EOR> Yum! Tried shack stack cheeseburger fried portabello  mushroom patty   cheesy nice texture changes tasty! Mushroom flavor strong  little sticker paper said caution hot   weren't lying  burned tongue fried portabello wait few minutes let cool  Cheesy fries ok  Cheese sauce guessing  Next time would just plain fries  Burger huge price bit high  But again we're Vegas strip New York New York  I'd burger again! <EOR> I couldn't decide whether give place two three stars but think dessert cheese fries account extra star  really excited try place friends because all really hungry waiting night  Simple menu delicious choices but just didn't live expectations  snackmeister burger 6 69  Kind pricey but probably novelty  burger itself just average  meat little dry salty but all toppings made it  friend hot dog just looked measly little meat stick  bit cold bit overpriced you're getting opinion  did however love cheese fries  Carbs galore say no that? dessert also really good  believe jackpot concrete but pretty sure wrong  custard sprinkles cake bits  CAKE BITS  definitely enough share between three girls glad it  If you're looking something quick filling probably satisfy craving  just don't see hype if take name though  <EOR> Finally made into shake shack recently interior very nice + modern  don't really comparison n while looking other reviews seems case    While n good don't think much compare      Both establishments decent plain burger    think shake shack patties little more flavor n outs    Also n fries taste cardboard idk anyone could those    Shake shack crinkly fries good guess  where comparisons end    opinion would rather hit shake shack then n out      But enough that     I single Shackburger which comes standard lettuce tomato shake sauce    also order fries meal good!   The size single Shackburger little small side said next time would Double    They're small but White Castle small     Next time hope try Double cheese fries shake     <EOR> A lot people compare Shake Shack In N Out  trying both both but different reasons  don't feel comparable  In N Out your typical burger  just made fresh high quality classic  Shack Shack feel more high end burger place see higher pricing  more variety types burgers menu including Shack Stack which ordered  cheeseburger 'shroom burger crisp fried portobello mushroom filled melted muenster cheddar cheeses put together  freakin' good  cheese just oozes mushroom when bite into amazing  usually fan mushrooms but made fan!  In addition crinkle cut fries  Shake Shack differs most burger places because crinkle cut fries instead just regular french fries  first hesitant some because really fan crinkle cut  feel they're soft potato y  However fries pretty good! fried level perfect crispness unlike most crinkle cut fries   Overall enjoyed meal Shake Shack  probably place would all time due slightly high prices simple burger fries  However definitely come back when feel indulging little  <EOR> This very first stop landing Vegas  handful time but just take first timer California compare Shake Shack vs  In N Out  made lunch around 1pm Thursday starving flight  Overall I'd give edge Shake Shack if willing spend little bit more but quality price I'd lean towards In N Out only Vegas location even might true against other locations   Definitely must if Vegas craving burger   Food 5 5 We tried regular shack burger crinkle cut fries course shake  burger simple but delicious  meat juicy tomatoes lettuce fresh bun super soft  enjoyed crinkle cut fries extra surface area more crispy goodness   Service 4 5 I bit surprised line short 5 people   basically through line ordered within few minutes  Maybe because hungry impatient felt food took forever but reality came reasonable amount time    Ambience 4 5 This particular location fills quickly seats big group more 4 challenging  did end getting noisy but still overall great spot come small group eat in  <EOR> I say place always look forward eating other Eggslut whenever Vegas  All other locations Manhattan closest us  While love In N Out Super Duper Burgers burger joint definitely top 5 fast food burger joints US    This Shake Shack located Las Vegas Blvd  Park outdoor area  says Yelp New York New York Hotel but actually outside connected hotel  There's also another inside T Mobile Arena which only accessible if open events    The reason location more original Manhattan super spacious  Maybe because original just shack? bring your whole family plus extended family PLUS close friends  There's also extra tables outside  usually early when just open avoid lunch rush  Even if time probably line door  But really wait short  expedite well well oiled machine!

Why people wait hours NYC?  Maybe tastes different don't know   hope does   But if waited 4 hours burger fries ate location would furious both situation myself allowing happen   First all Shake Shack inside NYNY put inside quotations because no way access casino   walk outside in   incredibly annoying can't remember another restaurant set this   could certainly wrong may exist but seen Strip   We ate Shake Shack around noon Thursday Pacquiao Mayweather fight weekend   wasn't much line although ordered took long time food   Far long given many people working back there   long don't know would call Shake Shack fast food  double smokestack cheese fries but told didn't cheese sauce   second annoyance     When food arrived hot   clearly made fresh which good given long took   fries crinkle cut just right amount crispy seasoned very well   Most places just give naked fries leave seasoning give Shake Shack seasoning properly   fries good but  it   earth shattering mind blowing revolutionary   They're good   prefer thinner fries N Out's better   But crispy tasty   The burger bit mess difficult eat without falling apart   veggies fresh particularly liked pickles   meat cooked all way through but retained some juiciness   couple crispy edges which favorite   But many   would patties little thinner   sauce good mayo based bit tang it   Tasted little dijon mustard but only little   other fast food special sauces which good thing   bacon needed cooked longer virtually no crisp it   Again prefer N Out   The place clean employees constantly asking if need help appreciated   Overall glad ate here   Maybe maybe am just missing something   But don't see being worth multi hour wait $13 50 wasn't cheap either   I'd eat location again but only if near didn't other plans   won't seek out  <EOR> Probably best burgers ever had! Idk why people argue Shake Shack vs  In n Out  There's no competition here    The Las Vegas location quite busy but long line quickly  Wait time food 15 minutes    I 'Shroom Burger hot crispy mushroom filled gooey cheese lettuce tomatoes sauce all nestled two delicious buns  Ughh drooling write this  also strawberry shake which good but nothing special  special shakes which periodically changes check special menu wall if wanna try something different! also few beers tap which nice    I'm surprised liked place much since usually big fan burgers  But gotta say definitely want come back more! <EOR> Great place grab quick inexpensive burger fries! inexpensive short walk MGM  burger fresh fries overly greasy  <EOR> The burger self delicious shakes delicious too  why 3 stars?

Nice little crunch breading well cheese  melted inside mushroom  would probably suggest getting mushroom its own instead shake stack  mushroom patty sort loses its shine when eaten beef  Most memorable part burger sauce  just right heavy innout's thousand island spread  Maybe cause more aioli  Lastly love buns because they're soft  personal preference  sure but reminds potato buns bread   Shake shake week mudpie  2 5 stars  don't chocolate all much but LOVE mudpie ice cream  Sadly tasted nothing it  very sweet completely lacked coffee flavor  expensive shake tasted milk chocolate milkshake reminded lot Nestle milk chocolate but thick milkshake form! bad? No just mudpie suppose taste like    Overall Thoughts If youre Vegas want good burger suggest spending extra 5 bucks 14 15$ Gordan Ramey's BURGR Planet Hollywood  Yes little more expensive but also bigger  But more importantly definitely taste difference flavor quality patty!! Many people compare innout don't think really compare two  But if choose pricing excluded strictly cheeseburger cheeseburger I'd pick innout  seasoning innout's patty just darn good more complex  feel shake shack burger emulated some quality ground beef some fresh cracked salt pepper natural beef taste  good but exciting  <EOR> Holy cow place good!

Yes  guess metric then equal   The double Smokeshack ate flavorful  could taste seasoning meat just cheese INO's  *Disclaimer I order burgers dry no spread  Also tried Shack cago dog  Pretty good    Everyone friendly except girl calling handing food  She sour look face especially attractive looking she was  only negative  Perhaps she having bad day give BOTD   Wish SS OC  Closest location Glendale Hollywood  Boohoo  <EOR> And begins war between In n Out Shake Shack west coast turf    I came Saturday afternoon surprisingly only few people front line! Talk some good timing  little more challenging finding place sit but managed snag table under 5 minutes  Person served super cool super nice even when handed wrong amount money embarrassing   say service pretty amazing considering being just fast food joint    The menu huge clean see once walk in  pretty simple person opted Shack burger which basic cheeseburger  burger pretty good but bit underwhelmed while eating it  wasn't anything special patty but definitely cooked well  won over cheese fries  love cheese love potatoes  usually fan crinkle cut fries but holy cow every ridge fries crunchy cheese oozed over made 100 times better! Also vanilla shake which delicious   Overall I'd come back again but definitely prefer in n out more  <EOR> A little underwhelming hearing all raves chain looking many Instagram photos people's meals here   came super hot day came escape heat grab quick bite eat   sure everyone trying same because pretty packed   line long took 10 minutes front   Finding table seat all 7 tough even though restaurant itself relatively large     I tried burger cheese fries black white milkshake   much prefer fries N Out   Thought cheese top crinkle fries would revolutionary but think actually prefer without cheese   fries just mehhh just prefer thinner fries guess!  burger good remember   But worth coming back sure milkshake! creamy indulgent   makes want back try all other flavors!! <EOR> Good burger Vegas prices  Tried first time compare In N Out would say Shake Shack comparable   definitely better fries  Basic burger good amount veggies meat  would 100% recommend getting crinkle cut fries basic but all places them perfectly crunchy outside fluffy potatoey inside  <EOR> Good burger if overpriced   Although tasty felt patty outs dropping grease   Novelty start wear off pretty quick   buns use   Overall bit overrated if ask me <EOR> Every time NY never able Shake Shack many good restaurants burgers last thing mind happy opened Vegas  actually Austin last week Shake Shack just opened couple days before line insane least 100 people deep decided go   Thankfully line wasn't bad Vegas   I'm sure if version authentic good ones NY but least try West Coast casino version lol   The shakes aight fries aren't bad but burgers very good   good In N Out?  Nah but wasn't far off   would say if Five Guys then more you   very Five Guys feel regarding grease meat   more Five Guys  there's bit more going more flavor   fries also pretty good better Five Guys perhaps In N Out    Overall I'd come back   Would trip it?  Probably not  <EOR> Shake Shack high list places Vegas  20 minutes ahead 11 AM opening no around wandered around park front arena came back 5 minutes before opened find long line! wait wasn't bad ordering counter pretty efficient  took some time food just starting day  Navigating crowd pick food bring table took some patience  finishing meal people hovering near waiting table  crowds kind annoying   We both double cheeseburgers shared order chili cheese fries order plain fries  burgers extremely good  beef patty full flavor hand ground texture marks excellent burger  bun toppings all very nice  plain crinkle cut fries nothing special  Similar Del Taco but flavor Del Taco's fries better  chili cheese brought fries another level very good chili but enough it  Despite crowd server came asked doing if needed anything  More chili? said David joking  But sure enough she returned minute later small serving chili  addition fries excellent  Top marks attentive service   Is best burger? Well right there  placed above Smashburger Habit Burger which both company such burger luminaries Umami Burger N Out  your own ranking  would back again but given crowds might just happy going other top spots  <EOR> So big question all Californians Better n out   Well totally comparable    Shake shack more expensive feels more restaurant fast food   comparison Shake shack Way better fries chicken sandwhich really good better chick filet more flavors shakes  In n out would say burger better price  thousand island sauce shake shack does offer grilled onions burger bun soggy shake shack <EOR> I wasn't blown away hoping SS would take imagination NYC where SS originates but no   Nothing  just OK!

I initially heard ShakeShack friends traveled NYC basically described classier Burger   haha which may may true   different menu options appeals me   Vegetarian thrilled SHROOMBURGER menu!!  nice able actual protein source instead just getting try fries milkshake other classic Burger Places   Also when ordered CONCRETE SHACK ATTACK chocolate custard chocolate truffle cookie dough chunks dark chocolate plenty chocolate sprinkles fudge sauce!!  naturally ordered crinkle Cut french fries accompany all yumminess!  My hubby opted pure Chocolate Milkshake classic baseline compare other places   He did think delicious but having few tastes Concrete think he wished he would opted specialties!  even design your own concrete pick toppings well always option if don't want try Signature Concretes   To fair Vegas shortage burger places such Gordon Ramsay White Castle Wahlburgers Burger Bar Fat Burger etc   haven't majority those honest can't really speak ShakeShack compares to   But just figured I'd trust New Yorker's    figured would know New York based fast Food Chain  vegetarian choices even extra bonus me!!! <EOR> Delicious burgers! can't wrong Shack Burger  would when ordering  soft hamburger bun sweet tastes good  Some other good burgers tried good Shroom Burger Shack Stack   Note shroom burger no meat  Don't forget order some fries compliment your Burger  fries crispy yummy too! Love Shake Shack only delicious food but because also serve alcohol! Shake Shacks burgers different compared N burgers because hamburgers taste but those wondering still prefer N over Shake Shack  <EOR> YES best fast food Vegas  really nice Shake Shack restaurant considering fairly new  line outside when but line moved really fast! Once ordered food food came 10 15min  fries perfectly chocolate shake  ordered chicken burger wasn't mood beef burgers but friends enjoyed burgers  only downside place lot people hogs tables before food making hard find somewhere eat your meal  <EOR> After buzzing order ready counter stood almost 10 minutes waiting meal  thought fast food  finally getting answer rude employee she told order wrong redo it  burger order fries  complicated  finally right she hands tray without any apologies thank waiting  Save your time skip place  burger fries mediocre anywhere  <EOR> Loved every single bite   Just craving long night Vegas   Wish opened earlier 11 00 am <EOR> Man why people comparing Shake Shack In N Out? Come now  Theyre different MANY WAYS  Let's just straight now  Come seriously  Even price range different tsk tsk   I'd tell Shake Shack NY 2 different locations also tried Korea but no didnt try Glendale CA Hollywood yet  no plans coming location but friend tried any SS past she really just wanted try it   We both Shack Stack? burger patty mushroom  big but juicy cheesy  eating burger vanilla shake infamous cheese fries burger little heavy some point  dont normally eat any condiments sauces but put some hot sauce burger because without probably wouldnt finished burger haha  Even aid hot sauce didnt finish burger  Oops   I register ask something guy register super funny nice but girl took order just OK  She looked mad stressed  She didnt really greet nothing which pretty unprofessional because she lacks customer service    This location pretty spacious clean since its pretty new anyway  wouldnt recommend come Shake Shack general but if really really want try then just come try it  dont think need come more once honestly  <EOR> Seriously branch better NY near times square When first tried shake shack first time NY wasn't really impressed  decided give another shot glad did  cant even put into words  AMAZING    It BOGO shake day in celebration valentine's day The only complaint service  asked shack stack no cheese cashier said he couldn't which fine because mushroom patty cheese it  asked if could regular burger no cheese he said no  don't understand logic because isn't just slice cheese burger    omit ?   Whatever place bomb let matter  back! glad made west coast! <EOR> Meal #4 2017 Las Vegas Trip  There's reason place called Shake Shack  don't meal  custard  Okay wait reasoning flawed since shake name  getting place should called Custard Shack least should related dairy desserts some way   I remembered burger being overhyped decided try classic hot dog instead  more disappointing  FRENCH'S mustard? fucking kidding me? then whole thing fell apart third way in  much moisture relish wetting bottom bun when should top  Also serving wrapper would helped   The manager table table check customers nice bring daughter new bun burger fell apart  I sense bun structural integrity problem  The crinkle cut fries really good  mentioned real reason Shake Shack frozen custard  think plain vanilla better taste frozen custard flavor  Shark Attack chocolate custard mix ins I don't remember which ones now   But Shake Shack chocolate really just tastes frozen yogurt everyone should know vanilla which New York fantastic    Our Las Vegas 2017 Trip  5 Stars Border Grill Mandalay Bay brunch Grimaldi's Palazzo Bouchon Bakery Venetian snack Eggslut Cosmopolitan snack 4 Stars Payard Caesars Palace Border Grill Caesars Palace SHAKE SHACK NEW YORK NEW YORK  3 Stars  Tournament Kings Excalibur Bruxie New York New York Therapy Downtown <EOR> Don't eat if care put your body  street looks those good food fast type places but just fast food  Since portobello mushroom burger comes Munster cheese figured could decent cheese cheeseburger but only American cheese which isn't actually cheese all  Absolutely everything fried soybean oil  Even burger without cheese oily gross  burger place inside New York New York Broadway Burger much better though little more expensive  <EOR> Based number orders screwing initially thought new location  Turns they've almost three years  Staff didn't seem care none soda any carbonation  eating half hour never bothered fix even customer customer complained  screwed shake order well  Multiple customers brought back screwed orders back didn't seem care   lot food waste  burgers fries good but having anything wash them down stunk  hope off night them  definitely try another location back home Arizona because food definitely delicious  sure I'd back since don't care because most customers probably state just visit  <EOR> Ever since eating locations  NY craved drug Shake Shack! Some best burgers love they're some monstrosity patty really allows enjoy flavor  Anyhow while Vegas location delish wasn't nearly good NY  <EOR> First timer  basic shakeshack burger cheese fries  tummy wallet left v happy  <EOR> I recommended place place Vegas  Eh  Long wait  Having run when find open table dirty not  Food ok but limited menu  Now say did it  No plans way though  Another chain burger joint  <EOR> Pretty small portions expensive get  very busy received some rave reviews but bit disappointed  Food good but really wasn't anything special  <EOR> Went around 9 Sunday night football game over  bad off wait 5 mins  Hubby ordered shack stack smoke stack cheese fries  burger really juicy cherry peppers gave slight spicy flavor! Hubby didn't burger   He said cheesy???!! guess if your fan Ooeeyy cheese don't order smoke shack! Fries Bonn! Till next time!! <EOR> Tried couple times new york  just goood here <EOR> I've heard lot place supposed staple East Coast but never part United states am only able judge experience here   I myself grown eating legendary In N Out burger but prefer judge establishment based its own merits   I ordered single stack smokehouse burger small order crinkle cut fries chocolate peanut butter chocolate shake   The burger very nice well cooked flavor but found size bit lacking   fries excellent crispy texture shake pretty good too!  Overall think if burger's little bigger they'd receiving 5 star rating instead three  <EOR> this probably only burger joint without feeling guilty  greasy you're done   little pricey  but worth quality meat  shakes perfect thin thick bursting flavor!   yeah its crowded lines long but eh  strip    locals may enough walk  wild side trek ever annoying strip crowds people  but if anyways might well  stop bite    everything la carte strip prices $11 15 meal  took kids wasn't bad  loud good family     not date night place lines breeze there's lots cashiers  food 20 minute depending craziness    the smoke shack double way bacon   duh cheese fries yum but plain also good    we've handful times don't mind coming Sunday weekday when crazy  things only reason lack star roadhouse burger carmelized onions way gooey totally smushed burger  shoulda stayed original smoke shack   <EOR> I've seen reviews pictures multiple social media sites friends place  happy finally visited enjoyed meal  Shake Shack delicious well presented  fries Oreo shake! table setup open all self served  electronic fob your order number wait buzz  buzz indicates your food ready! better run because tastes amazing!  Pros Good presentation delicious appealing decor wifi good location lots seating wait time minimal fast service  Cons little dirty high traffic flow small dining areas non cushioned seats tables  Overall I'd venture back if near strip again  <EOR> Shake Shack just burgers! fan chicken sandwiches try theirs  loaded fries looked good those too  Let say all food good  really did enjoy chicken sandwich but reason 3 stars because chicken bread bun ratio OK  chicken smaller bun tear off excess  Just being honest because $13 meal want chicken breast size bun  <EOR> Great place friends good burger  wait short  Worth if want something fast yet close in n out  <EOR> Ehhh     probably expectations way high    but ice cream sup par  PEANUT BUTTER which serious offense books  lady working rude acted annoyed world    Maybe came bad night?

Frozen Custard I read somewhere Shake Shack known custards since guess custards more East Coast thing? don't know  All know shakes Shake Shack pretty darn delicious! standard vanilla strawberry which good but if want extra kick sugar definitely try caramel because literally favorite three tried! Shake Shack shakes over N shakes ONLY because caramel flavor   Floats My sister opted all three floats not all same time course! favorite root beer found Purple Cow grape flavored soda Creamsicle orange flavored soda tasted artificial  Unfortunately didn't think stand item found much soda enough custard! N over Shake Shack floats even though N only 1 float secret menu   Things wish tried I wish tried other things menu Concretes Beer Floats course wine but time belly wouldn't allow it   For reference 7 people each ordering meal burger fries shake close $100  7 people ordering meal N around $40 which obviously fraction price!

I'd rather stick In N Out  still forever #1 terms flavor price! <EOR> Shake Shack decent burger place located outside New York New York  classic good burger can't really say anything bad but there's nothing special either  shackburger which regular cheeseburger  If choose between in out shake shack would probably choose in out  buns in out nicely toasted where Shake shacks buns soft  guess preference  shakes amazing! sampled friends all them thick creamy just great  also tried cheese fries which also pretty good well  crinkled cut fries artificial tasting nacho cheese melted all over  Overall decent meal environment cool too! watch games giant screen while enjoying burgers <EOR> What great burger  Incredible wish list meal birthday  yummy  patty perfect portion cooked just right buns awesome veggies all appetizing shape sauce divine  also munched crinkle fries which other places am fan but shake shack does them justice  <EOR> Review Tripadvisor posting                                               My first meal off plane place  waiting eat place again since first tried LA earlier year line already door despite being 4pm    The menu right front look decide all want while you're waiting line once you're counter menu board way behind you'll know your orders off top your head    As much loved Shake Shack first experience forgot pricey place could get  full meal cheese fries shack stack burger chocolate cookies cream shake which cost over 20USD compared In N Out lovers place definitely lot pricier    With long line means wait time equally long your food overall actually pretty disappointed second experience    The shack stack burger deep fried mushroom first experience came caution hot sticker since mushroom ooze juices when bite into but disappointing thing firstly didn't sticker most importantly mushroom pipping hot!   The cheese fries salty liking perhaps I'd suggest getting just fries itself cheese cools down hardens quite quickly    So unfortunately didn't mint cookies cream shake tried last time since seasonal thing tried another seasonal special which chocolate cookies cream  generally fan chocolate ice cream but I'd say best part meal definitely very good way Vegas heat!  Guess come back again cause   third time's charm right? <EOR> I Chick n' Shack delicious! husband Bacon cheddar burger said best burgers he's ever had! fries weren't anything write home but don't really care crinkle cut fries  <EOR> The saddest awesomeness thing happened      came vegas alone told cashier named Jarde bday comming couple minutes she super nice kid she back gave free Ice cream     Dude amazing costumer service!

Same great menu offering burgers dogs great frozen kustard which really softee    Great fries   also offer shakes beer wine   It's appropriate Shake Shack located New York New York hotel casino    Located outside Strip     If only Shake Shack San Francisco  <EOR> Those crinkle cut fries    Wow   can't think any fries burger chain good Shake Shack   Pretty good burger   Premium pricing good quality   double shack burger which standard double cheeseburger   Loved char meat which hard thin burger patty without overcooking it   bit small but overall solid burger   I dont understand n comparison since its comparing premium burger fast food   standard double cheeseburger still cant n double double! <EOR> I sort want give place 4 star but since first time reserving opinion until try again which    Shake Shack attached NYNY hotel casino   during Golden Knights playoffs which hadn't even known omg place insanely busy   Swarms people out!  being right near TMobile arena where game held imagine crazy there!  But hey  Vegas!    Anyway surviving huge onslaught people finally cheeseburger fries   Most burgers days pretty big assumed wrongly would fine share guest me   Nope!  small burger forewarned if want something  normal size small    also ain't cheap   But guess days esp  strip   The crinkle cut fries good too       The good news really liked burger   wasn't thrilled big piece lettuce put but meat burger itself really liked probably better any other fast food burger tried tried lot   bun cold but may just due huge rush crowd people there   knows?  crazy location!    I also tried frozen custard   Never having before didn't know expect   guest  numerous other places out state says  just okay she's better  good frozen custard should more eggy flavor which didn't have  in other words should actually taste custard  frozen     tasted very high quality homemade vanilla ice cream which certainly isn't bad thing!  enjoyed but probably wouldn't again   This Shake Shack indoor outdoor seating area   ate outside because inside madhouse!  ate around 4pm still fairly hot outside and wasn't even summer yet!    sure appealing outdoor area once summer really kicks in   I definitely am going try another burgers different location town just see goes   But may order two decent amount food cuz just small tastes! and big eater!

I tried Shack Burger Cheese Fries Chocolate Shake  Everything really good  start burger  Meat quality think better In N Out but lacks sauce unlike infamous spread In N Out   actually added some mustard bring some meat flavor  Moving onto cheese fries  Yes very good especially cheese drizzled top  Can't wrong especially if crinkle style fries  Having said In N Out fries thinner taste freshness  Again hard compare? shakes Shake Shack definitely beats shakes In N Out  First all actually drink shakes go versus having wait  some defrost action shakes In N Out  chocolate shake overly sweet cold enough decadent dessert drink  All all solid All American burger shop right LV strip  Plus decent selection draft beers  Must try Yelpers! <EOR> Great food extremely friendly staff! shack burger husband smoke shack burger  OMG we'll buying seconds thirds fourths on! bun cut all way through burger doesn't fall apart  bun meat secret sauce combination amazing  bun any regular hamburger bun either  don't know but complimented burger well! also cheese fries chocolate shake  Both amazing too!

Definitely won't first choice   We're mission try all burger joints see stack all time favorite   TMI little burp hour later feeling burger greasy taste   good feeling either  <EOR> I take Wendy's single over this   think original shake shake probably great but chain format just another ok burger crowded burger market   ordered double good but bun soggy because service horrible saw burger sit 3 5 minutes before me  <EOR> First time Shake Shack WOW  burger delicious  sucker crinkle cut fries  didn't really enjoy cheese sauce tho  vanilla shake tasty  gonna miss burger when back home  <EOR> Let start saying   better n ! Pretty good   Pickled peppers didn't really smoke shake burger  Bacon stringy   no crisp   just kind soggy minute  Fries ok taste frozen bag fries kind greasy  good note lemonade really good ! <EOR> Delicious shroom burger!!! Must order Black White shake  Waiting time little longer thought would but worth  must eats Vegas  <EOR> Delicious  Juicy  mine lettuce wrapped good too   Simple menu  Good efficient service   Nothing bad say  <EOR> I expecting great things place reading reviews but disappointed   shack burger cheese fries both just ok    Just under $10 bucks single burger fries case worth it  Great location busy place sure great but think would rather catch cab im rather eat here  <EOR> This place place when starving walking around Vegas  If you're lucky wait only 20 30 mins  group just arrived Vegas wandering around looking food  pretty close closing time wasn't much line    They pretty extensive menu  Everything sounded good  If money stomach I'd order everything menu  single shakeshack burger a cheese burger lettuce tomato shakeshack sauce   also cheese fries  friends all cheese burgers double fries    The food took 10 minutes  place reminded higher end n out  cheese burger delicious  cheese fries good but cheese separate container seemed nacho cheese side   Price food bit expensive but quality food outweighed that  atmosphere great! Would definitely come back burgers but would stick crinkle cut fries! <EOR> Good burgers fairly fast service given long lines  Ordered cheeseburger cheese fries didn't disappoint  Customer service great well  Staff attentive asks your food experience going  <EOR> For some reason when look pictures burgers Shake Shack look amazingly dry but lemme tell THEY'RE NOT  actually really soft loving your taste buds lol   I Smoke Shack course BACON but sure customize burgers whatever imagine  However Vegas you're still drunk day club 8 PM cannot process any self thought out combinations  The fries pretty good considering stayed crunchy but THOSE kind dry  Someone recommended friend peanut butter sauce something?? highly recommend like    melted peanut butter  just weird burger  I'm probably going try everything menu  heard lot cheese involved  <EOR> Super good! Definitely worth price  Awesome shakes cheese fries juicy hamburgers  <EOR> I never knew could anything better n' until tried place  far best fast food burger place ever entire life  always wanted try restaurant place hearing raving reviews New York but hadn't New York over 5 years afraid would never try NY's favorite burger spot comparable n' CA   also serve beer all kinds milkshakes  boyfriend came hangover partying Vegas  After eating felt much better but maybe because hadn't eaten over 17 hours  burgers juicy delicious  whatever fries because all fried potatoes generally taste same    Shack Stack Burger think  call   basically burger fried portabella mushroom cheese inside mushroom well  Food messier expected but plenty napkins didn't complain  forgot other burger boyfriend called but bacon  Both really good  Price reasonable fills pretty nicely  want say besides Earl's place favorite Vegas affordable food  <EOR> I'm west coast where all N Burger dying try east coast's best burger joint  might best coast but definitely one!  I Smokeshack burger side cheese fries  Everything burger straight down signature sauce delicious! burger juicy buns nice crisp  fan wavy fries but definitely changed mind!

We all creatures habit grew eating In'n'Out double double grilled onions always gold standard but Shake Shack definitely puts good fight  Smokeshack burger good  patty meaty good flavor overly greasy but didn't care much cherry peppers overall entirety burger underwhelming  burger also kinda   small? could probably similar burger myself home  Bun nice    Where Shake Shack In'n'Out shakes themselves  vanilla custard float AWESOME  custard creamy heavenly!! would come back just try more shakes custard flavors also offer wine beer which huge plus    I love location especially love outside seating view strip  usually long line but moves quickly   FYI new locations coming 2016     including West Hollywood! <EOR> Another Burger place? So Shake Shack different all rest?  In simple answer The Shack Stack burger   breaded fried portobello mushroom stuffed gooey cheese top juicy cheese burger    This separates shake shack everyone else  Although offer regular burgers cheese burgers well hotdogs uniqueness shack stack found SS burger place would keep coming back to    On downside price shack stack just under $10 00 nothing else but sandwich  may order  fries cheesy fries just thick custard based milk shake    I love East coast restaurants venturing  West coast keep them coming  <EOR> amazing! best cheese fries ive ever had! amazing burgers!!! love place <EOR> My experience top notch little fast food joint outskirts strip  big flashy letters Shake Shack can't missed!! cold even outside seating warmers!
