Service friendly typical snooty receive high priced Vegas steakhouses  30% discount $3 half off booths strip  <EOR> This Greatest steakhouse experience ever had! service exceptional food world  Juan Joseph made meal way better offering great recommendations    We table six everyone received steaks cooked perfection  Waygu filet most succulent piece meat ever don't let price deter having greatest piece meat Las Vegas  really wish could give establishment 1 000 stars  now mandatory every time come Vegas  <EOR> This second time going BLT Steak may end being last  Don't wrong place decent meal  But prices charge don't see value   Our trip Hawaii few years ago ended above average dinner BLT Steak  found STEAK most disappointing part meal server enhanced experience offers explanations different sauces try meats   On recent trip Vegas girlfriend wanted back she such great memories Hawaii  dinner nice but more same  seated quiet half empty restaurant immediately helped server  wanted look over wine list but found lot wine prices definitely high  Thus wanted wait until decided meal   The chef sent complimentary liver pate crostini which tasty appreciated  Being just two though felt bad eating much made room steak only steak   Then popovers came out  popovers delicious never disappointing  enjoy even share recipe take home brave few want try repeat such success  two monsteorus popovers shamefully ate 1 3 4 them   The meal nice though did some same options hawaii  settled Filet parm herb crusted veal chop truffle mash  girlfriend enjoyed filet very much suggesting better last steak Hawaii  But she also craved sauces but couldn't remember which was  She asked server brought peppercorn sauce  ended being she liked but point didn't matter   My veal chop nice but having first veal chop all expected  take responsibility just seemed very fatty not tender meat but fat   real drawback parm herb crust which thick strong didn't much flavor veal  cut chewed tore thing before finally gave up  Half parm herb crust ended scraped off   We both enjoyed truffle mash sharing perfect choice  whipped almost cream like state which little strange but such tremendous flavor   All all $170 check two entrees two glasses wine side taters $2 charge sauce didn't which caught off guard   menu two prices everything adjusting those player cards believe  Because all numbers different colors hard figure $200 ended dropping meal assure wasn't impressed money spent  girlfriend likely back but think turn last visit BLT Steak some time  <EOR> We came friend's bday celebration pretty disappointing  service slow when even many tables  Servers friendly enough but didn't really leave any impression  ordered 4 appetizer dishes taste presentation just average  Most deep fried items old oil taste dining Chinese restaurant  Steaks ordered medium rare but all turned straight raw red  lot better steak houses strip would never list return again  <EOR> This tough   all depends order   steak house if going steak I'd give 5 stars   First off am steak fan wife could really good steak    She ordered bone ribeye she thought great   Well worth price  She also drink side    ordered lobster although good really only worth half price   pretty small left hungry    Since don't steak wasn't option  I am value guy   don't mind spending money if value it   Well value half meal   just wasn't worth $275 price tag tip    Probably won't back  <EOR> We really enjoyed place  steak delicious cooked perfectly  sides also very tasty but sharing sizes other steakhouses  bread service wonderful cheese filled pop over really good  helpful tip 30 percent discount deals right outside main entrance ballys tix 4 less booth  place  Just good every other steakhouse strip better prices <EOR> Our experience BLT Steakhouse disappointing due waiter ordered short ribs wife ordered lobster salad entree waiter made comment all your going eat wife rather rude tone  felt comment uncalled judge ordered  He continued loud judgmental  food good but waiters comments uncalled for  Not good experience  <EOR> I literally best meal entire life restaurant   There isn't ounce hyperbole misuse 'literally' either   best meal ever put face   The service spectacular food simply amazing ambience nice clean hell even smelled nice   I would give place 6 stars if could   grilled smoked bacon start kobe beef steak   wife tuna tartare scottish salmon   all spectacular   A complimentary duck liver pate provided well   just fantastic   I suck writing descriptive reviews bit sad because food deserves better  <EOR> My colleague staying Paris Hotel over week March Madness  watching some tournament games Ballys sports book met brother walked BLT decided stop dinner before going out   Dinner started complimentary duck liver spread popovers which thought both terrific  then ordered asparagus cream soup which told somewhere between cup bowl table ordered few appetizers onion rings mashed potatoes creamed spinach main meal ordered chicken dish  colleague ordered different chicken dish brother ordered fish   The soup came nowhere near cup much bigger bowl   too much opinion but OK
