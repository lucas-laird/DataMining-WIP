Paying $40+ two bowls great   I asked server extra limes he came pointed limes table  Obviously seen limes other add ons soup front us  politely smiled made request loud sign language more limes he rolled eyes  He never came back check only drop off check  pho very bland  Over priced you're better off eating uncooked top ramen! <EOR> My Ratings Quantity 2 Enough two Quality 1 BLAND Price 1 overpriced quality Location 2 ok Parking 2 hotel parking Service 2 ok Speed 1 slow  Overall GOOD!

We started spring rolls $8 50   Um two weren't very good  Plus much smaller side  peanut sauce tasty  also Thai Iced Tea  $4 50? crazy pricing? wasn't sweet which would probably good thing don't super sweet drinks but Thai iced tea just proper  Oh well right?  The gay boyfriend shredded chicken pho which apparently good minus all bones it  beef stew pho  beansprouts basil came table bit wilted dried out  stew good but spicy all  least all proper condiments table  would glad know used all parts cow including tendon   Both bowls pho almost $10 each  There's something incredibly pricey considering Pho shop part coffee shop TI!

Just try definitely good break all oily fast food Strip  <EOR> When come Pho remember all relative   I say much confidence probably cleanest pho restaurant you'll ever venture into   Obviously being located glorified Las Vegas casino means superb cleanliness inflated prices   But surprisingly Pho still holds true some its typical Vietnamese restaurant roots those being * Sriracha hoisin sauce fish sauce found every table  * Chopsticks spoons sauce platters well stocked each table * Despite having only 20 items menu white lady server looked weird when called dish name proceeded ask item number instead  just Vietnamese restaurants!  Prices definitely atypical Vietnamese restaurants though   $10 bowls pho $4 50 Vietnamese coffee $9 banh mi!  beef pho bad all   broth light good clean taste   beef stew pho kho tasty but thick gravy like   soups weren't scalding hot prefer but made do   fairly decent meal Strip standards   There no other casual Vietnamese restaurant Strip   Pho all you've got   all convenience   Time money Vegas money should used gamble   not spent driving Chinatown wasting gas your precious time Strip traffic same average quality Vietnamese food     Like said all relative  <EOR> Kind hidden behind Treasure Island coffee shop  Very good food  Some better Pho tried  fancy but high quality great tasting food       UPDATE 1 27 13   Returned Pho last weekend must say quality gone way down!

Yes convenient Pho place hotel literally within walking distance elevator drunkards always crave soup broth long night drinking because think sober help feel better     Surprisingly broth wasn't bad some flavor but pricing just throws off guess pay convenience     NYE stumbled upon place since around corner elevator just wanted sip broth   BF hungry long night drinking since he taking care all night told I'd treat afterward     why bill $25 just 1 person eating??? dunno  $11 95 Pho Tai   added meatballs bumped easy $15 he spring rolls which came only 2!!! $9 95! man talk rip off!!! but guess  money because people ended right???  Again all convenience    same scenario next night   again stumbled upon pho place again many martinis but time 3 people just ordered 1 bowl shared because plentiful enough broth    <EOR> Pho authentic but $17 bucks bowl?? C'mon!! brisket gold  paid cuz didn't want look cheap date but now maybe she thinks stupid shelling $40 2 bowls Pho  <EOR> I because stayed T I  thus most convenient choice   I'd clear Vietnamese feel judge authenticity pho  far WORST pho ever had   Broth bland instant pho packages taste better had   $13 banh mi?  serious?  fois gras there?  No didn't order mustn't considering banh mi no more $3 50 anywhere   ethnic food leave strip   Unfortunately work time did permit such travel missed opportunity assess authentic ethnic food   sure when if back but oh well  <EOR> Hmm well really Pho excited place strip  However broth good topping good standard Pho restaurant  However Pho needs hot! just very warm  service bad gets  workers talking among themselves loudly slow service! No drink refills! chase down person check  might only come back just emergency strip Pho  But thats it  place ran dirty dive shows  Pretty sad place strip  Treasure Island!! place could great if look people working more closely  <EOR> Had lunch recommendation friend he spot on   Yes real Vietnamese   Yes expensive but you're eating Strip   sure could find something cheaper off strip but time pay cab just spent same money   Deal it   portions not counting pho itself pretty large when order bowl chicken curry dish comes same bigass bowl pho does   Add Strip tax portions you're doing bad think   Speaking curry?  pretty good   hot I'd but still pretty flavorful   namesake pho serve?  best pho ever but lot choose due living near sizable Viet population but certainly bad all   Given nature place doing just fine I'd still recommend it   few other things all which decent     That said       order Thai iced tea   horrible   Possibly worst $4 ever spent   Tea weak coconut milk tasted little off      just bad all around   should sent back     As service didn't any problems all   Sure little weird going Vietnamese place having family owners wait but then again weird see casino outside too   general though environment decently tucked good experience everything   I'd back says lot Vegas given many choices are   nice diversion most other strip options nice fresh option when you've eaten lot well crap often tasty crap but doesn't healthy elsewhere Strip   most authentic place ever you'll disappointed if think way going in   If take though which sort Chevy's Vietnamese you'll quite happy   Remember everyone LA Bay Area Portland Seattle NYC North Phoenix Washington DC did miss anywhere?    Besides being TI option grabbing dinner before seeing Mystere seeing Sirens   Scantily clad women Asian food   Ahhh love Vegas  EEE <EOR> If know good Vietnamese food order any Vietnamese food here  just sad  sad might want eat something else drunk feel better  did later    I stayed TI girlfriends wanted eat something before going Hakkasan  did much time decided eat since right lobby TI  I wanted something oily but American ordered egg roll Bun  looked good  egg rolls bad but    dipping cause no flavor    added Hoisin sauce Sriracha Bun edible but could save it    just ate egg rolls left everything else    basically paid $16+tax egg rolls    At least egg rolls gave enough energy dance all night  ? maybe even thanks alcohol   The next day drove back LA straight favorite Vietnamese restaurant  <EOR> The food seem lack choice isn't much selection  choose from  And quite pricey  stayed TI in room dining menu partly restaurant menu Vietnamese sandwich crazily over priced   EVeryone bay tell vietnamese sandwich would cost no more then 5 bucks  charged $15 very simple pork cumcumber sandwich  Which really ridiculous! Giving three stars already stetching it  <EOR> I really hungry girlfriends waited line seated 15 minutes so  Soon host tells just walk down follow some random lady front other end restaurant? hello you're host please your job seat properly since more host threw off both stood desk together  Once seated actual server awful didn't check all insane because couldn't even tell needed checks from  busers very kind checked friends realized should tip instead server only took order disappeared! Caesar salad side fries fries undercooked same chicken top salad  Bleh worth wait people! Spent 30 bucks two items  <EOR> So bad  tried Pho  tasty all even though really hungry time  couldn't finish half order <EOR> Not best pho but least pho  $12 much choose terms selection  used spending half price getting bowl twice big traditional pho places  There's only bowl size would considered small regular most pho places   This place seems half high end pho restaurant half diner  Service so so especially small crowd time  pho broth very disappointing  only somewhat bland but temperature wise lukewarm  only able finish pho quickly but because wasn't hot took long time pieces meat cook broth   Overall if want something different casino good option  But if want good pho drive Chinatown good stuff  <EOR> what pho'!? bones all your chicken soup service s l o w   i faster refills drinks playing slots    avoid place    there's little pizza shop over starbucks cheap fast  <EOR> Half coffee house half Vietnamese?

Nothing exciting nothing authentic course!   I correct  Overpriced pho $10 25 ! Wasn't surprise obviously  tasted bland too  only pick type meat which made suck even more   Oh! thai tea iced Vietnamese coffee $4 50 too!  I ordered bun sauteed beef $10 50 nice crispy shredded lemon grass it  Other bun bland    On top bland food utensils filthy! Ewww   I first some sort curry splatter inside water cup near top rim! Ewww   Then   I some brown sticky stain fork! Double EWWW   They need new dishwasher something     Never eat pho here   unless no other choice     Btw place located Treasure Island coffee shop    <EOR> I no idea why love place much but yet vegetarian vermicelli it    The first time ate Vietnamese place located Treasure Island staying didn't feel Denny's yes take it   open really late because pass 1am sure    The first time really liked but figured would anything because much alcohol consumed    So again when buzzed still good!  I ordered both times wait back area where no there   Its pretty fast your food lot but yes its pricey well    Something would fun 8 bucks tax tip any place Cali but instead paid 14 bucks it    The vermicelli fried tofu grilled onions lots veggies noodles   also fish sauce super hot chili paste srirachra over it   Mouth fire!  Hate say but most likely come back if staying going nearby  haha  <EOR> I can't believe craving pho Vegas  pho decent overly expensive Vegas food $9 75 bowl   However offer very many choices just chicken noodle soup raw meat pho   those kinds things   The service good though situated very convenient location  would come again if am craving Pho Vegas though!  Note serve thai iced tea $4 50 but only 1 refill   pretty funny  <EOR> My feelings very down place  definitely cheaper places eat time boyfriend stayed Treasure Island good place eat when hungry gambling wanted quick bite  Dishes somewhere between 10 18 think which expensive pho but cheap Vegas  If check reviews love Pho  am probably spoiled pho south bay  Overall concerns food much service  When hostess helping waitress put some plates  understandable  She said she would second  But second  several minutes point where manager came out  She definitely did know she doing  embarrassing  She finally around seating us  around 5 really wasn't busy  waitress took over 10 minutes take order  When she took orders she forgot take menus away  busser forgot give soda  boyfriend did drink asked if waitress could take drink away  She refused then proceeded talk several  minutes yelling loudly across restaurant manager  pho received extra fatty  coming back  <EOR> These people definitely heard Westminster  guess because Westminster's California but still   The pho no taste  broth especially  Usually love drinking broth pho but if wasn't hungry doubt I'd desire drink more did  noodles all right but again seemed no flavor even though added sprouts basil jalapeno hoisin lime juice sriracha knock off   What's even worse pho more $10! Scratch $11! Total rip off when know great tasting pho exists $3! guess only way Treasure Island think appeasing Asians visit but sad substitution good ole Westminster pho   My mom order fried rice something that  rice tint orange pretty bad say  rice sticky! Sticky? Yes! Sushi rice sticky! definitely prepared rice supposed prepared thus didn't even want take another bite   Avoid place if you're picky your Vietnamese cuisine  fact just avoid all costs! Tasteless food overpriced definitely worth it! <EOR> Its cuisine course everybody should expect legit pho  pho clean tastes pretty good  twice friends long night clubbing  However I'd avoid place if car drive legit pho restaurants off Spring Mtn road  prices pretty high bowl pho think $10 bowl? lot seats inside but some reason made wait! understand  Pretty empty during lunch time clean restaurant  <EOR> Terrible lines horrible management  Love food but every time go we locals occasionally find ourselves TI Mystere there's tons tables rude staff though maybe no lines always wait 30min  Skip place Le Thai <EOR> Need your pho fix while Vegas? place go  ordered pho tai cafe sua dat sp? very pleased  pho arrived steaming hot broth really good flavorful served all traditional condiments side  much more expensive used paying Vietnamese restaurants closer home but kind expected since Vegas  server really nice but bit slow side which only reason didn't give 5 stars   Would come again recommend others? Pho sure! <EOR> I thought place pretty good  expensive  But place little small  When dinner where nobody line  asked table 3 hostess said might 15 minutes which fine  But kinda piss off she told move back someone's way  Huh?
