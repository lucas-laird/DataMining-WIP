Pizza calzone whata great combination! love them both! If your doubt don't new pizza place!! sauce bold right amount spices cheese! <EOR> Every time visit Las Vegas always stop Cugino's   people friendly atmosphere nice most importantly pizza great   However last time took mom she ordered Eggplant parmigiana don't think over   just didn't impress $12  usually large cheese pizza excellent   visited NYC NYE able try NY style pizza New York   ate pizza every day while there   place definitely comes close won't fly all way NYC great pies   wish Cugino's would some garlic onion powders could put pizza though addition Parmesan Cheese peppers   Also workers always friendly!  close closing 8pm welcomed open arms   also ordered order garlic knots 6pc order he brought extra order knots us! Granted close closing probably going throw away anyways but still made happy!  Definitely fan Cugino's! <EOR> While food always amazing service never consistent   standards aren't exactly high counter service pizza sandwich joint but smile thank apology when forget your slice pizza long way   won't disappointed food but don't  expect friendly family feel  <EOR> You must also try Donny's Special   menu but quite delicious! <EOR> Best pizza period  Best Reuben sanwich ever had  Calamari delicious   Couple small complaints Dining area kinda small little hot there  employees kinda grumpy But would hesitate back  <EOR> I'm originally Queens NY NY pizza idea good pizza all about  Cugino's achieves pizza greatness  The crust thin but manages crispy chewy all right ways sauce great tastes homemade cheese delicious  We order large cheese pizza take some back hotel couple slices  It's closest thing NY pizza me  live So  Cal there's two good places but Cugino's better  We start every Las Vegas trip stop Cugino's <EOR> I really don't understand reviews place  entire crew nine underwhelmed food ordered  Cuginos Special Sandwich  plenty prosciutti but saltiest prosciutto I'd ever had  bread balsamic dressing wasn't anything special mozzarella lacked creamy flavor love good mozzarella   good sandwich $9 00 top off customer service lacking    Try deli if want but definitely don't drag all your coworkers off hwy 15 based other yelp reviews  <EOR> My Eastside Familia place Pizza Subs Pasta cannoli's  Lots other good things try   Reuben  big usually split between under 10 dollars!  Consistently good food service <EOR> I ordered cheese pepperoni pizza place because saw quite few awesome reviews thought I'd try out  pizza absolutely amazing! think going new favorite spot know pepperoni pizza pretty hard mess but you'd surprised lol  local I'd say definitely better pizza places gone to! <EOR> This best pizza shops  eaten while visiting Las Vegas  food fresh made order  Even deserts delicious   But subtract 2 stars because offer Military Law Enforcement discounts  Also greet once enter restaurant  <EOR> I think should also mention Cugino's best item homemade Mozzarella   Many may wondering why Italian's love Mozzarella much average most places it   But once real Mozzarella immediately understand   Cugino's fresh everyday many times several times day   creamy salty perfect texture mozzarella   slice stuff eat raw finish within couple minutes   If you've never tried now! <EOR> We nicest time Vegas until tried leave    stuck night  found decent hotel short 25 minute walk Cugino's  both very happy did  garlic knots small but delicious! Salad good  ClamWin pizza amazing  side meatballs sauce yummy but lil bit cold   The food above average  service most pleasant part honeymoon trip  Very friendly faces  Thanks guys! <EOR> I love place! accidentally stumbled upon few years ago when met friend student UNLV lunch  didn't know where decided here   It great NYC style deli happy found  must items order every time stuffed peppers cannoli's  peppers stuffed bread stuffing soaked italian dressing  both die taste good!   I usually chicken parm sub but time split linguini tomato basil sauce mom  perfect portion split since both don't usually eat large portions  yummy but since huge fan cut tomatoes would preferred marinara sauce  would recommend trying chicken parm sub over pasta  best subs ever had   At deli also serve other hot cold subs pasta deli items  also buy boxed pasta other Italian food items  tried raviolis sold past really good!   They also sell italian rainbow cookies those amazing! little pricey though 12 99 lb    But worth every once while splurge!   If big Italian food fan need check Cuginos  disappointed! <EOR> Don't understand all hype  won't even waste more money second chance   I ordered first time hubby thought all gross  Cuginos special pizza soggy tasteless  Sauce bland  Fried gnocci tasted whatever fried oil before it  Large meat sauce would called size small everywhere else barely any meat it  Rice ball parmingiana only thing able eat dumped rest  didn't enjoy really more paid $40 am hungry thing  sauce isn't good killed rest  mushy couldn't tell rice ball really more mush ball   No thanks wouldn't eat again even if free  <EOR> Came family ordered fried zucchini 2 philly cheese steaks sausage peppers onions sandwich   All very good   also serve Pelligrino large bottle given few cups share   Located strip mall right across street UNLV   Fairly large large TV watch football while eating   steady stream customers out   Prices little steep just sandwich $8 99 but offer daily specials which didn't notice board until ordering   Solid choice though  <EOR> My husband very picky pizza sauce but he approves!
