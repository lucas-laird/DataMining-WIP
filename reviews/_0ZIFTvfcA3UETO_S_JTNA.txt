If could give place no stars would  morning through drive thru ordered food family along oatmeal 10 month old son  home sat down feed piece plastic oatmeal!!!

Every time through drive thru always something bad  all bad attitudes experienced just take cake  thru bf friend  heard say order once but THREE TIMES  ordered meal bf large drink friend  Very simple  First window course same old girl always snuffs gives attitude when give money  receipt check say she forgot add large drink  next window explained lady drink Mexican lady told she couldn't transaction because she no money register  looked seriously  ? said um ok well pay credit card no big deal  She refused payment well before handing bfs order   just confusing why would turn away customer no reason that    <EOR> I ordered two double cheeseburgers  When home found burger no cheese nor onions ketchup pickles  Confused looked back receipt said two double cheeseburgers no specifications charged full price! Never going again  <EOR> Ok understand management pregnant  No ever cleans place seen full cups soda just left all over floor  Kids here  Seen much uncleanness restrooms  put shiw ska wanba support them but just clean place up  don't argue if order wrong  <EOR> Worst mcdonalds!! Everytime never fails always forget something!! ALWAYS!! also very slow very friendly <EOR> If could give negative stars would because place worse McDonald's too  don't even try going through drive thru you'll just end having wait long while simple meal parking lot  Don't try calling them let them know your still waiting your meal because won't answer they're phone  when answer remind them 5 times you've ordered  So   just save yourself some time  Horrible service never coming again  <EOR> This clumsy McDonald's terrible terrible McDonalds!!! sad!!! screw orders all time  could probably just order small drink clumsy McDonald's would find way screw order  tried order plain hamburgers consistently put ketchup pickles them  time through drive thru told park wait parking spot  Yet still brought hamburger ketchup pickles it  spoken supervisors twice screw ups  am also offended sign drink machine says refill only  Soda expensive pay WAY MORE SODA WORTH!!! Although usually more refill only find sign VERY UNFRIENDLY!!! Today ordered Breakfast Burrito meal triple cheeseburger  nothing special order  would take world class klutz master incompetence mess order  However once again McDonald's rose challenge managed mess up  gave ketchup packets instead picante packets  also forgot put pickles Triple Cheeseburger SPECIAL ORDER! AM THROUGH MCDONALD'S! manager incompetent employees should terminated eligible rehire! should escorted off McDonald's property vehicles since unable job  McDonald's should just shut McDonald's location down! location worthless! no hope! <EOR> If possible give zero stars  location would receive  Listen McDonald's don't bother trying your locations technologically advanced think more efficient adding 2 ordering lanes 2 pickup windows 2 drive thru parking spots 2 mobile pickup parking spots  useless when staff bunch idiots don't even know what's menu   order completely wrong even having park wait someone bring correction  suggestion bypass location find another one! <EOR> This McDonald's nice location which its main problem  many guests  through drive through wait quite awhile ice cream cone  try keep line moving having those need wait park section allows other patrons depart but still takes lots time order reach payment food windows   The food same any other McDonalds employees seem kind but particularly nice probably because they're exhausted   <EOR> Hmmm New thought   Can fast food place five stars? It's expecting gourmet food   I hoping best mc'ds offer   I mean isn't fast food all About? Getting exactly franchise wants happy   I am happy    Although small language barrier me  communicated  My wife received exactly desired   A fresh hot neatly put together bfast sandwich   The hash brown slightly more oily think corporate might but solid b+  So yes   Fast food restaurants deserve 5 stars if marketed expected  usually don't Why can't all this     Ps   Owner keeps bathroom key under control  Nicest cleanest classiest customer bathroom EVER seen f food establishment    Great animal metal castings adorn grounds put your kid mini elephant     Great seat decorations  typical yellow orange designed leave     Good job franchisee If lived nearby id patronize ff more often just when rush va ca  <EOR> Don't unless cash because credit debit machine always seems broken  Otherwise you'll forced wait drive thru line nothing  happened multiple times  <EOR> Check your bag !! Before leave sure ordered never fails locations staff lazy burgers something missing give something else don't give period   drive back twice always location definitely return drive little further <EOR> An order 10 piece chicken nugget meal two extra 10 piece boxes  Simple order right? tried giving Big Mac window  When corrected them order took almost 10 minutes food  such hurry forgot check bag before left  No fries three sauces and kind asked for   Three sauces 30 nuggets? Seriously? people want $15 hr? order right might worth they're currently paying you! <EOR> this terrible place everyone goofing off ! took 10 minutes two small carmel frappes literally 10 minutes its even busy  !pay more attention your guests  jobs aren't goofing off especially job <EOR> I can't believe no mentioned African decor McDonald's   different wacky kind love it   Star!
