I love restaurant spacious clean modern  Love many sides give quality meat Hobak definitely best meat quality all Korean BBQ places decent pricing too    But annoyed being point where could conversation friend  4 different servers taking care us    would think awesome service should beyond expectations  but no    It first time needed time look over menu asked first server give some time then 2 other servers came wanting take order ask more time again    Then friend wanted pictures some dishes told servers cook meat ourselves she let but other servers kept coming asking if sure want ourselves  Then friend wanted cut pork belly before fully cooked cook more quickly but server came rudely asked cutting before its cooked? then he took over meat told Don't cut ok?!     Seriously?!? asked left alone    keep coming over acting don't know grill meat  same guy came back keep cooking meats putting meat did want onto plate he cook more meat   they kept coming over being faces stop conversation every time come by    I trying give good service trying cook meat its really nice them    But should let when ASKED multiple times  friend prefer cook own meat eat own pace    servers kept coming cooking meat continuously felt rushed eat them all before over cooked    They really should many people working same table clearly don't communicate each other since repeat ourselves multiple times  staff way aggressive   it if annoyed cooking your own meat!   I really enjoyed food best meat quality great variety side dishes  But when meal able talk friends eat own pace generally left alone could comfortably eat  place way aggressive serving style borderline rushing finish your meal being rude  <EOR> Excellent service very good cuts meat  beef platter added some prawns  Everything great  sides all good too  usually don't kimchi but didn't mind here  bit pricey but worth it  <EOR> First time glad came! friend marinated meat combo  Let tell you   the menu says good 2 people but more group 4  LOT meat  much ate rest lunch next day  all delicious too  sides came meal great well  bit pricey compared other Korean BBQ restaurants but taste quality food  waiter wonderful too  He always made sure water filled cleared off any plates weren't using table wouldn't become overcrowded  Overall would recommend place! <EOR> Goong best Ala Carte Korean BBQ's Las Vegas hands down come back again any day  quality meat outstanding compared other places! very hard back all eat Korean BBQ ate Goong! service amazing because always around if need anything  Once again can't wait come back soon!! <EOR> I placed bookmarked year now  Finally made in   Why 4 star being seated table   took good 5 mins before server noticed just sitting down patiently menu closed no drinks food yet   But server made during service rest night    Food tasty  Good selection   marinated Meats side order scallops   The meat quality close Hobak 8 oz but closed enough   serving more compared those two places cheaper too    I would back hope server more attentive when customer gets seated  FYI  cool sunken seats didn't seat there  <EOR> Excellent steak Black Tiger Shrimp plus amazing selection sides free unlimited free replenishment sides!  Kid friendly super service where cook super comfy booths  <EOR> Ok   because smell parking lot amazing!!!

won't regret it <EOR> I'm originally Los Angeles Koreatown moved Las Vegas 5 years ago  Good Korean food hard come Vegas wasn't until discovered Soyo Barstraunt spot Korean food fix  When heard owners Soyo starting Korean BBQ place excited! tried Goong yesterday disappointed  First off ambiance décor very trendy modern but traditional Korean twist  interior designer chose did very nice job  Looking menu initially overwhelmed meat choices but staff did great job explaining menu making recommendations  beef combination came steamed egg doenjang soup variety different cuts beef including Wagyu prime ribeye! most impressed Chadol baegi thin sliced brisket meat commonly bad Las Vegas  Most Korean BBQ places Vegas use very tough cut no fat tastes horrible  Goong used proper selection meat just you'd find Ktown LA  assortment side dishes Banchan came also all very good really par food would Ktown LA  amount food lot two price pretty reasonable considering upscale Korean BBQ spot some dirty dingy place serving low grade cuts meat  All all excellent dining experience would highly recommend place! definitely new favorite Korean BBQ restaurant Vegas! <EOR> Service awesome!!! meat fresh delicious!!! Ask HS Kim he super nice waiter  <EOR> I tried better known Korean restaurants NY LA SF Chicago never really impressed they all used much MSG other flavor enhancers mask skill insecurity only ate when Seoul better places during business trips  However unlikely may seem gem Korean restaurant highest culinary skills ingredients emerged all places Las Vegas  glad find place wrote friends abroad try place when visiting   Yes pricey relative other Korean places but actually would compare place American steak houses those serving Prime meats   Then price actually quite reasonable   The side dishes well made rendering innate flavors without being overpowered spices  meats high quality setting including decor elegant minimalist  restroom very clean too  service intrusive purpose think give customers some privacy   but respond quickly if needed   I happy Yelp reader viewer many years but restaurant truly motivated actually write first review  Highly recommended  <EOR> Had naengmyun  Very refreshing during hot weather  Good service food tastes good  Thanks Goong! <EOR> The best korean resturaunt ever  Really good service  helpful any questions help cook food  Love here  Try sit down area middle! <EOR> Read reviews online lives good reviews  Excellent service awesome banchan really flavorful meats  Reasonable price too     if want good K Town type food     come won't disappointed  <EOR> Best Banchan town place kills isn't even Spring Mountain!  Goong when feel splurging KBBQ don't want AYCE  only other non AYCE place ill even  Gangnam but quality far superior     That being said also most expensive KBBQ places town don't if want bargain but if want some great cuts meat amazing banchan! <EOR> I excited try place great reviews left extremely disappointed  ordered suggested Goong special which supposed feed 4 5 people  5 people table all left hungry  food good variety but extremely small portions  rib eye 8 chunks meat brought ONLY TWO Tiger shrimp table 5!!

Food weren't super hungry decided order la carte but party platters recommended size your group  ordered prime rib eye beef tongue x3 thinly sliced brisket x2   serve 14 banchans side dishes naming each its being served barley tea instead water light hint roasty flavor  would drink over water any day because refreshing! Your dipping choices green tea salt my favorite 3 super delicious paired meat regular salt pepper dark sauce  Some meat served black slate which adds unique touch  meat portion quite small price pricier side but seeing quality color cut meat definitely worth it!  Service Everyone super friendly attentive  servers patient cook all way through each meat which nice  Sometimes just prefer cook myself eat chat since having them cook between gets kind awkward  thing point don't serve individual plates  meat cooked move side grill no plates hold meat except eating off grill  also no napkins found  always checked except gradually slowed when dining area busier which understandable    Overall enjoyed experience Goong  nice place take friends family finer dining KBBQ experience typical places around Chinatown  come back order party platters next time try all different kinds meat offer! <EOR> We enjoyed dinner here   weren't expecting restaurant authentic   nice experience   ordered $65 Beef platter combo  Everything good except male server bit snooty  He would shove all serving plates bowl women's side table  <EOR> Clean nice restaurant  servers grill pretty much everything your grill don't really much   Prices aren't bad   No complaints  <EOR> Came see all hype about    delicious!!!
