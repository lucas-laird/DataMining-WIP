This place right office few stopped some snacks  chips guacamole super nachos pork tamales    The tamales nachos decent nothing special but wouldn't mind having again  wish gave some salsa sauce tamale though  food self does look appetizing didn't expect much because place seems fast food place but little more attention presentation would food more appealing    The Guac terrible    sure if mistake but runny very bland  Maybe gave green salsa whatever else mistake but literally tasted water green! Never ordering again! <EOR> I eaten Los Tapatios 3 times last three weeks  1 time ordered fish tacos 2nd time ordered rolled tacos day before yesterday chicken enchiladas  am remotely close being connesseur Mexican food but say food tasty came hot  <EOR> I driving noticed name change Dimas Los Tapatios    did u turn thought would give them try  quit Dimas around 3 4 years ago new owner change year two before that  When started going 8 yrs ago food consistently good  California style Mexican food Robertos enjoy  new owners came would eat every now again because closer Robertos before new one but wasn't always good  Hit miss     When saw new sign hoped find new good Mexican food place  looked menu good long time noticed looked same menu but higher price changes taped over old  Probably because Robertos prices thought could raise prices also   ordered plate hard shell beef taco enchilada rice beans   When ordering told woman take number 10 ? or whatever number was cheese enchilada  She looking handwritten cheat sheet see number 10 plate helped saying beef taco cheese enchilada  She then asked hard shell? answered yes   used card pay wrote $1 tip line  She ringing into card machine writing she literally asked Did want put tip it? hadn't handed reciept yet but written small tip but couldn't believe she asked  She owner  day owners never expect tips business let alone ask if want leave tip  normally tip 20% more restaurants food servers but order counter when ready type place   food first thing noticed taco shell most places  didnt look corn tortilla fried hard  looked premade shell put into deep fryer appear fresh fried hard shell  smaller  'beef' seasoned ground beef greasy salty  Meat always shredded beef when menu says beef hard shell taco didnt know wouldn't be  never even seen ground beef menu types Mexican restaurants  taco bell small taco  Then cut into cheese enchilada find also greasy ground beef!  ground beef enchiladas besides home American style? Even don't   Every place ever ordered enchiladas choices always cheese chicken beef which shredded chicken beef  Beans good rice ok but used Mexican rice tomatoes blended sauce which give orange color  white kind grey and mushy  did decent seasoning flavor but like  rice better  only ate two bites each taco enchilada most beans some rice all while comtemplating whether tell asked expected  decided tell brought food counter  Waited them notice 10 seconds then just said forget left food right left      If prices lower Robertos Gerardos which closer would try them again  Especially since sign saying fish tacos  99 Wednesdays  But don't want gamble when know good food somewhere else same price  <EOR>
