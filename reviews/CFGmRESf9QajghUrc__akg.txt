Last but least 3 piece pot sticker order only came 2 pieces  pot stickers pathetically small felt bad them  havent location years wont going back till business another restaurant takes over  Peace bro <EOR> So many great meals but tonight staff insisted upon sweeping rude mopping gross especially strong chemical smell   Truly DGAF if workers want wrap early  If you're open don't sweep mop pungent cleaning chemicals  know cliche customers tend leave bad reviews when things badly don't despite many good experiences but hoping persuade management review practices  <EOR> I asked veggies sauteed but just wasn't any flavor way more rice veggies  asked spicy wasn't all  Unfortunately pass place  <EOR> This place gone down hill bit recent years new management   However still find plenty enjoyable staff usually freindly never problems service  true take long time though some reason every time egg roll seems fifteen minute wait about? Lol basically stopped ordering egg roll meal because this  <EOR> Nommy nommy nom nom   I always $3 99 special just brócoli veggies    They charged  50 extra time but whatever's    The cabbage gives tummy ache carrots hard just musical fruit veggies    It's always good fresh  Hit miss attitude employees   They pleasant time though    Only lost star because charged brócoli because raw chicken just chillin bucket next grill  Cook cover shizz homies  <EOR> I would definitely recommend place those work need healthy meal refuel themselves those looking good healthy meal general!
