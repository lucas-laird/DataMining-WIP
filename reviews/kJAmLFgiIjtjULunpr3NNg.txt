You'd assume wouldn't appealing non buffet dinner option? WRONG    Blue Ribbon much potential but some point another drops ball New York New Year's Eve  only disappointed overall atmosphere restaurant food portioned small didn't much flavor including table's soy sauce which extremely salty  Even fried rice large disappointment  What's odd however sushi bar seemed rollin' rolls every turn ornate decorate garnishes delicious looking delights  Yet could never find where they'd disappear to?  Should've just gone Vegas instinct when doubt buffet is  <EOR> Strange may seem Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar Grill only couple pieces sushi   Instead ordering things could elsewhere asked server he enjoyed   He suggested Oxtail Fried Rice Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken   Interesting     I ordered he suggested awesome   fried chicken came wasabi honey sauce served side   Really quite interesting take fusion cuisine   I'd recommend anyone likes fried chicken something new really good chance catching on   fried rice something totally different altogether  top fried rice could only described thin egg omelet pouch filled liquid bone marrow goodness   instructed broke open pouch mixed together fried rice absolutely awesome!  While NO WAY healthy really really TASTY   The sushi priced bit high guess expected sushi place strip   did interesting offering   a spicy lobster roll   ordered pretty good but probably people expect small roll costs more 10 bucks   I'll definitely back try different things   found service attentive helpful would easily recommend anyone visiting Cosmopolitan Las Vegas general   If could I'd give Oxtail Fried Rice five star rating all itself! <EOR> Super cool fresh fish different kind salmon  We omakase 2 enought even try some fish  <EOR> The menu vast somewhat confusing  mushy roll opted 18 piece sashimi very good  Prices high sure others LV  asked lounge seating but moved quickly bar better atmosphere  Great beats audio  Chefs friendly took nosy gaijin questions  <EOR> I don't know when last time prior felt robbed restaurant    This place very well built ambiance   tables interior very cool looking   food excellent as excellent your local good sushi place your home town    However your home down rolls sushi three times less expensive   For example Spicy Tuna roll hometown best sushi place 7$ 8 pieces   Blue Ribbon? 18$ 6 pieces   That theme across whole menu while understand its Vegas markup    the markup come some flair   need give something sushi house back home doesn't offer nice ambiance enough    I highly discourage place cheaper equally good places around strip  <EOR> Definitely needs step game quality justify prices everything  7$ plain miso soup comes served hot bowl water miso paste mix yourself?? 1 piece nigiri sushi price 3? orders 1 piece sushi    no one  3 rolls 4 pieces nigiri soup total $115 left hungry  All all layout restaurant decore but didn't feel satisfied  <EOR> I absolutely loved place  husband sat bar tried almost everything  sushi chefs nice surprised great meal! especially loved kanpachi yellowtail  <EOR> Hummm thought reviewed place  All all ok  love fried rice fried chicken they're interesting but necessarily mind blowing  Great friendly staff greeted if they're happy see because supposed look they're happy see LOL  couple specialty drink which can't remember name ume other might ginger something another  Good ambiance  <EOR> Sashimi fresh but fried chicken dry   adore decoration place  <EOR> Wow  Coming Hawaii obviously don't expect great phenomenal sushi Vegas but hey didn't expect ORDINARY   Seriously  sushi chefs must teenagers because cuts sashimi inconsistent overall good cuts  spicy lobster roll hoso maki sized literally only filling spicy lobster  No vegetable  Super unsatisfying  Vegetable tempura soggy  just general very nasty  No flavor  Hate place  Would never come back  Waste $150 <EOR> Another remarkable dining experience Sunday  miss location once inevitable change happens  Enjoying until end  <EOR> Sushi very tasty  lobster sushi tiger roll Green tea martini drink very tasty  lot matcha green tea taste  Service excellent <EOR> I Vegas work because all craving sushi also staying Cosmopolitan  ordered rock shrimp assorted pickled veggies  rock shrimp awesome but pickled veggies little salty taste  Since Vegas decided order Blue Ribbon Special Platter  came long wooden platter beautifully arranged  no idea but everything simply amazing  remember Dragon Roll however since another order those  roll single best sushi roll ever had  really fresh delicious  Save some money then place  worth it!! <EOR> Awesome food  Great decor  Service top notch   You'll need open your wallet wide eat but well worth it  Surf Turf 10!! <EOR> They most beautiful combination between Arts Freshness Sashimi  place romantic service world class sake great expect more? <EOR> Best lychee martinis!

Our server left pretty early managers helped out   Except he terrible explaining everything just ended nodding even knowing ordered probably omakase      The presentation barely fit table while sashimi good agreed second plate rolls other sushis probably better   Nothing memorable other being quite full     I recognize place expensive every other review talks pricey is but coming someone didn't even pay meal shout wonderful friends! probably isn't worth little much pay wouldn't come back   Also dangit forgot try wings   if you're stuck Blue Ribbon right now reading reviews  you're supposed get   remembered reading but forgot then someone asked if when told where eaten   Oh well  <EOR> Make no mistake place pricey  Unless you're serious baller like Green Bay Packer players saw rolling you're going feel hurt when paying your bill  little detail way Blue Ribbon worth checking out   The place modern Japanese feel divided into three areas  When first enter there's small sushi bar right  Past spacious lounge bar area  Beyond main dining area larger U shaped sushi bar  tables main dining area rather intimate many booths lining walls tables separated thin wood dividers  if you're looking place where some personal space more 6 inches away nearest diner then place you   Service spotty  server nice enough he just didn't seem know menu couldn't recommend anything  Luckily managers came suggest few items  Although he casually dressed jeans polo shirt when he first came chat thought just some random dude wanting talk menu   Here's ended ordering Tuna sashimi  2 pieces  Pricey but deliciously fatty silky smooth  Possibly some best tuna sashimi city   Kanpachi Amberjack yuzu pepper  order came eight slices fish yuzu sauce poured tableside    Smoked pork belly kushi yaki pickled onions baby watercress  Two decent cuts pork nice amount fat added richness flavor   Negimaki broiled beef scallions enoki mushrooms  cute looking dish eight slices beef wrapped around scallions mushrooms  good savory dish hint sweetness its sauce but probably something would order again   Miso marinated black cod  Two sizable pieces fish per order  usually can't wrong miso black cod but better  piece slight fishy taste smell   Crab truffle fried rice  menu says $55 per order   ridiculous any type fried rice but since everyone seems rave Blue Ribbon's fried rice gave try  manager said could half order  Perfect! plenty chunks crab mushrooms slices truffle  Definitely best fried rice just don't tell mom sorry mom your fried rice bumped down number two   <EOR> Horrible  never paid much basic rolls  wasn't good  didn't settle well  Waitress rude  Horrible  Just horrible  <EOR> Very fresh tasty sushi   second time did disappointed  Octopus very fresh we started Edamme fried chicken which house specialty rolls amazing Spicy crab roll spicy lobster roll tako sumiso dynamite  Tuna very fresh  enjoyed wait staff ambiance  sat outside terrace enjoyed people watching almost midnight everyone way clubs coming shows  <EOR> I couple hours kill before catching flight Vegas remembered saw place did happy hour while back online  down concierge informed he didn't think still offered happy hour but could check  Sure enough happy hour go!

Yes yelling its good    every time loved EVERYTHING menu very accommodating don't even know where start   wish vegas didn't ton restaurants cause otherwise would every single meal here!! <EOR> The sushi great but quite expensive compared other high level sushi restaurants  ordered spicy tuna crispy rice without black caviar because hate caviar yes know still charged $36 which crazy because other restaurants would no more $20 dish  dont rave much restaurants strict substitutions should able eat way it  service good fast seated quickly  dont mind spending lot sushi but next time want spend amount I'd rather Nobu  <EOR> Since love staying cosmopolitan business pleasure three times now agree many other reviews expensive sushi!  waiter all three visits never suggested chicken oxtail rice everyone else seems rave about     bummed that next time won't order sushi try sides chicken friend sick evening must sashimi which don't see could fresh when you're desert! sushi rolls small average way pricey anyway! better places spend kind money! <EOR> Excellent quality taste atmosphere!

Hmmm     that's hard say but I'd rather spend $100 ate today $100 overpriced steak restaurant every other big casino strip   If next time would sit counter nigiri made time while talking chef    sushi should eaten  <EOR> Good Service although never return because ended getting food poisoning ruined whole Friday! <EOR> This restaurant really going!  Not only situated Cosmopolitan Hotel but created unique entrance really stand other restaurants surrounding it  variety seating arrangements dim classy feel but everyone super down earth playing Salsa music when arrived!

Hell Yes! <EOR> I'm going two stars  decor nice pretty dark but modern  Having lived Japan long time feel give fair estimate good Japanese food is  place wasn't it  Interesting charge ridiculous prices too  off strip some legit Japanese places advice  <EOR> Was much better expected   sushi actually very good composed cooked dishes weren't bastardized asian fusion cuisine   Great service   The fried chicken short rib lobster delicious     The sushi good any eaten Vegas   Still notch below best NYC LA though     If isn't back handed compliment don't know is  <EOR> I uploaded some menu  food extremely delicious tasty  far Fried octopus need marrow oxtail fried rice  food compliments each other without any over powering flavors  Super yummy  sauces lip smacking  Definitely great choice   pricey but well worth it  only down side bit dark here  wish light bit brighter  Other everything perfect   Anson waiter very patient took good care table full hyper girls  Very fast service however made reservations arrived right opening   Great service <EOR> I really enjoyed dishes very pricy portion 8$ miso but course everywhere Vegas everything ridiculously over priced  But least food tasted fresh good flavor  Service good even though chicken fried rice took nearly 45 minutes arrive  Sushi delicious  <EOR> I came because few nights vegas eating terrible food stomach crying some decent food   The atmosphere very nice servers friendly    I excited selection fish had  many sushi restaurants Isaki  Unfortunately them   I ordered shima aji hamachi sea urchin  all fresh tasted very good  only complaint sushi very narrow skimping fish price   I've eaten sushi Ginza Tokyo Otaru Hokkaido  If paid $10 piece sushi Japan give enough fish worthwhile  understand its Vegas but Ginza doesn't even that    I also ordered asian broccoli rice dish  thought fried rice some sort but just cooked broccoli bowl white rice $13    kinda ridiculous just cooked broccoli   My friends ordered tempura udon seared yellowtail collar  both seemed really it    All all felt could've gone other restaurants cosmopolitan $60 would've more food  great sushi but just didn't feel paid for  <EOR> The lobster roll good   friends ordered 4 plates it   also tried 2 plates fried chicken   alright bit dry but sauce supplied made better  <EOR> A quick look low reviews Blue Ribbon indicate first guests become violently ill result meal here   Quick note management salmonella fish   In perfect situation restaurant rather pricey   But when throwing costs seeking emergency medical attention must surely most expensive meal life   I've visited Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar Grill perhaps half dozen times many trips Las Vegas always excellent experiences   But learned recently there's scarily thin line between meal potentially awful   and meal might your last   Situated atop shopping area Cosmopolitan traditionally regarded Blue Ribbon better sushi places Las Vegas   and patronized restaurant both solo guests many times past nothing but praise pass along   Alas most recent one time many   Something else being passed along Blue Ribbon occasion   I'll try avoid gory details   Myself friend dined sushi bar itself rear restaurant during week between Christmas 2016 New Year's 2017     The exact date somewhat blur because within 24 hours both come down worst cases food poisoning ever had   say someone dubious honor getting food poisoning exotic locations Somalia Ecuador  Neither able leave hotel rooms Cosmopolitan next several days except seek medical attention   Given potential delays onset symptoms other variables involved always wary pointing fingers quickly when comes food poisoning     However friend converged different sides country different days dramatically different diets   culprit unfortunately simple pinpoint   The Blue Ribbon single sole meal snack common during brief stay symptoms hit both within 24 hours another     We both required medical attention several IV's fluids   Fortunately we're both reasonably young healthy simply memorable descent into bowels Hell pun intended    But puns aside food borne pathogens very very serious business     For younger older patrons those anything less hearty immune system   and your wellbeing quite literally risk     I'll again reiterate points common during short Las Vegas trip exceedingly limited *only* restaurant meal snack drink remotely common   Heck don't even same soft drinks potato chips chewing gum     The sole common shared item s food rolls particular restaurant   The only other potential explanation both happened acquire identical foodborne pathogen individually separately unrelated sources separate sides country prior arriving Las Vegas   both manifested within 24 hours another identical and very specific very unique symptoms   So while dislike calling restaurant name such dangerous issue alternate explanation coincidence statistically vanishingly small   that think particular instance more justifies doing so   Again dangerous stuff   instinct assume *must* very rare occurrence Blue Ribbon    Reading reviews more fully lead question just rare indeed is   One visits Vegas play odds games   and one's health  <EOR> Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar Grill really wooed ambiance mind blowing food  Yes admit pricey but hey deserve expensive dinners once while = Service great everyone attentive  restaurant itself spacious upscale vibe  walking bar front separate dinning area lounging area patrons enjoying laughter good company  Walking into separate room dinning area huge sushi bar right smacked middle    For starters SEA SCALLOPS SPICY TUNA Roll OOHHH fresh be?? umm fishing outside it! your typical sushi      TOFU SEAWEED  LEMON GINGER SOY Delish No complaints!! dressing very light   SMOKED PORK BELLY KUSHI YAKI  PICKLED ONIONS BABY WATERCRESS love swine!! any questions?

Bookmarked NYC locations!! <EOR> The Sushi other items little expensive  But hey pay more quality food  Otoro extremely fatty juicy  tried live sweet shrimp scallop great!!! also recommend any patrons wagyu beef tongue!! <EOR> Fried chicken Japanese restaurant!?! I'd heard rumors back New York but travels Las Vegas found delirious sweet juicy fried chicken between lips! started negari abacore octopus which above par then Japanese yardbird arrived  hard crust batter encased most delish chicken ever  Most undisclosed flavor can't even describe  overcome hosted sushi crew enjoy round Japanese beer!  So good ordered some go  <EOR> Yes place pricey  Nope good Nobu  being said tasty great option if you're staying Cosmo    Their specialty actually fried chicken  ordered appetizer which quite upsetting waiter   apparently messed rules should eaten last   don't wasabi couldn't enjoy wasabi honey give pour over but still very much appreciated well executed perfectly crisp fried chicken  most expensive fried chicken ever eaten   sure best but definitely worth getting if you're fried chicken person    The other highlight crab truffle fried rice   YUM  also enjoyed blue crab california roll although allegedly inside but fact inside sushi brat side bit disappointed this    We big group business dinner ended trying ever dessert menu  WOW sushi spot killer desserts!  I back try some sashimi give place more fair review   meantime Nobu remains favorite spot high dollar sushi but varied menu sure please sushi fans sushi phobic alike  nice option if staying City Center group wants variety  <EOR> I stayed  Cosmopolitan Las Vegas Hotel few times each time  came come eat sushi Blue Ribbon! fishes fresh service friendly  Most importantly chef Hisa phenomenal hebis key!

Then he ordered grilled mahi mahi coconut rice  really liked dish  sauce rice yummy  mistakenly ordered fried chicken  Why did order fried chicken sushi restaurant especially when huge fried chicken fan? Yelper posted best fried chicken she'd ever compelled me  expecting little pieces fried chicken ones another restaurant can't think of  But actual full breasts legs seasoned spicy concoction  wasn't terrible all  Just    really should ordered more sushi  Maybe  why left 'eh' feeling  wasn't anything wrong restaurant  Just wasn't much different any other sushi place to  <EOR> I ordered isaki white grunt yellowtail sashimi house salad hot green tea along vegetable roll tuna sashimi two other fish sashimi but can't remember now  thoroughly enjoyed isaki sashimi house salad along crunchy pickled vegetable roll  green tea wasn't anything spectacular neither yellowtail    Everything fresh but nothing made wow stuff freaking good! However might back try more items later   As side note would great place couples date  decor nice cozy dim lighting  really comfy chairs big couches  <EOR> I chance try well anticipated restaurant during opening   restaurant excellent atmosphere great music   Seatings very comfortable laid back   But sushi bar didn't rolls much filled way much rice   Nonetheless sashimi dishes fresh    I've heard fried chicken speciality but unfortunately all sold night   Overall probably won't return again unless group dinner reunion something  <EOR> I place least 10 times only order fried chicken !  Yes fried chicken sushi place  Best fried chicken earth honey wasabi dipping sauce   8 time ten if early seated right away short wait   Food drinks spectacular   Most nights service good but tell most staff cater towards higher end patron vs  regular joe such myself   <EOR> The first time only drinks bar  drinks Ume Mimosa Nashi Martini really good bartender awesome  coming back ever since  Sure pretty pricey but if you're good people all worth it  presentation always nice service great  Great ambiance  fish always great   The last time 2 bottles cold sake  Very smooth tasted fruit  wakame seaweed salad sesame duck potstickers fried whole fish assortment sashimi rolls  fried fish highlight me  eat whole thing including bones crispy delicious! came soy + rice wine vinegar dipping sauce   Some rolls good ordered 3 rounds same ones Sake Ikura Kyuri Special  disappointing though spicy rolls spicy lobster roll spicy tuna roll spicy all  <EOR> Service well food really good  bit expensive but total rip off ordered sushi deluxe cuts fish sushi pretty generous  sat right sushi bar bit show watch chefs cut prepare sushi  Its pretty cool  also giant clams which quite process prepare  Overall good dinner  <EOR> I sashimi paid way much it  hour later started  throwing having diarrhea    spent  vacation room sick    am sure fish served old     don't recommend  place all   Stay away <EOR> Awesome drinks wine dessert sake great service!

BOOM! restaurant just nailed  high priced sushi served mediocre BEST when compared eaten cheaper home  fact nerve pass crap then charge much unacceptable plain simple   Here's ordered 2x Chu Toro Nigiri 1 Spicy Tuna roll w Tempura Flakes Cucumber 1 Blue Ribbon  w 1 2 Lobster Shiso leaf Black Caviar 1 YellowFin Ahi Collar  FOOD QUALITY STRIKE 1 Chu Toro 2nd highest quality Bluefin Ahi there  should fatty full flavor  Chu Toro received  very little fat flavor  almost if previously frozen later defrosted  chefs should ashamed served crap those prices!  FOOD QUALITY STRIKE 2 The Blue Ribbon roll thick pieces lobster shiso leaves stuffed middle roll  Topped small amounts Black Caviar  $29 8+ pieces  no flavor lobster tough chew  Also when eat caviar there's some briny flavor saltiness? always present  caviar very little flavor all  $29 this?  FOOD QUALITY STRIKE 3 Yellowfin Ahi Collar served broiler but wasn't flavorful  GF said OK but spectacular thought she being generous  Let's just say wasn't horrible but flavor left lot desired   FOOD QUALITY Consolation Prize Believe spicy tuna roll bad  Spicy Tuna usually considered garbage higher end sushi establishments I snootily told don't serve here    forgettable sushi bar   But $14 Spicy Tuna Tempura Flakes roll wasn't bad  fact surprised more flavor flagship Blue Ribbon roll which twice expensive  only thing saved them 1 star food quality    SERVICE Service tough really took effort someone take your order  If looking around room empty table front wouldn't want see if needed order something? 15 minutes wait staff walking past table before waved down?

Great food great drinks great service  bf always know where take when told bf's friend just sat down blue ribbon he couldn't turn away  definately come back! <EOR> This place great! day 3 opened inside Cosmopolitan   love Blue Ribbon NYC recent Las Vegas addition keeps bar high   Fresh fish good selection knowledgeable attentive wait staff   would recommend making reservation opentable  very helpful   Overall great meal! Don't expect cheap dinner though over $50 person if buy wine couple rolls  <EOR> I love place  Menu top notch  Little pricey but all worth it  coming since opened all sushi spots Las Vegas far personal favorite  Staff always great  quality food really high  <EOR> I say only great thing place stays open until 2am  around midnight friends worked quite appetite  every restaurant Cosmopolitan everyone closed  very surprised isn't Vegas?!  So give Blue Ribbon props being only place open hotel  However food very pricey  Then again Vegas expected  ordered spicy tuna roll which just average  very small priced $14  severe allergic reaction which fun  never happen before when eaten sushi past  want say may perhaps mixed counters exposed shellfish? really sure but unfortunate  also skewered meatballs which tasted average  bit more cheaper $9 came quite decent portion size  would only recommend coming if need food late night! <EOR> I don't mind spending lots money food but if supposedly top notch food but does taste worth preeeetty unhappy    Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar Grill isn't blue ribbon y  think just hype  The oxtail fried rice so so  simple make   The sushi rolls basic one bite sized  WORTH IT!  The beef bone marrow mediocre  served bread  felt would instant heart attack if finished dish myself   Their fried chicken good!  All all found atmosphere restaurant lot more Japanese food  <EOR> Though seems sushi does rave reviews did sushi  shrimp tempura delicious scallops cut butter crazy good beef sliders! cohort steak very delicious  also Lychee Martini tasty though didn't finish because busy eating! <EOR> I've Cosmopolitan Hotel few times honestly did plan try Blue ribbon because seems cater more Americanized crowd  friend wanted try amazed good fresh sushi selection offer    I generally won't order sushi rolls because sauces usually mask taste not so fresh fish  However place legit! two rolls wasn't drenched sauce but very well balance rice fresh fish  rolls least $20 each but very enjoyable    Chef's selection Hokkaido style handroll UNI TORO IKURA wrapped shiso leaf  OMG $21 handroll best ever! enjoyed every bite it!   Wagyu nigiri hamachi nigiri very fresh delicious  wagyu seared melted mouth  Price tag per piece least $10 but enjoyed every bite it    Oxtail fried rice served hot claypot  tasty meaty but think bit oily  dont recommend ordering if there's only 2 people  portion quite generous    I would come back more chef's selection heard open quite late night! <EOR> Warning Hard core fresh sushi! Don't expect all American sushi  don't eat sushi only your puny Cali roll shrimp tempura roll  sushi Restaurants hubby he loves it  Staff awesome!
