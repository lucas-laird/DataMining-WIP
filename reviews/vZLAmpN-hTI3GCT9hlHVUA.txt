Everybody's nonna brings tray rigatoni pot lucks picnics  Nothing special Carbone's rigatoni would differentiate nonna's  Except price obviously  The wines priced little higher higher any other Vegas restaurant    The restaurant drops lot complimentary snacks table while wait      bad thing but everything heavy spicy while some main courses delicately flavored overpowered pizza bread salami chunks cheese pickled cauliflower    The captain didn't offer any limoncello but he probably figured wanted would stiff tip  did mess place entirely fault    The food way overpriced  Similar dishes other high end Italian restaurants  less muddled concepts  less expensive experiences never made want leave  <EOR> After hearing many great things Nyc location excited check Vegas outpost  Located inside Aria looks identical original very classy decor Intimate feel    Now food  Unfortunately average best did live expectations  split tortellini ragu spicy rigatoni vodka  Both good but flavorful  main bass oreganata  cooked well but little salty liking    Overall would've given place 4 however waiter complete prick  Considering price location expect excellent service  Several times he very rude gave laugh regarding menu questions  No reason pompous you're serving me  Towards end meal he mustve pulled whatever a** because he became lot friendlier  maybe he realized he screwed tip  <EOR> This restaurant really great food but wasn't super pleased service  two pasta dishes obviously priciest things menu but  felt time  waiter seemed treat differently ordered checking giving attention because weren't spending ton money    I know upscale restaurant but young vacation don't all money world spend dinner!

<EOR> Most magical place Vegas    I several times months never once left unhappy    Ask Louie meet nicest guy strip <EOR> Phenomenal culinary experience!  Italian food hard break any barriers because nature values old school tradition  However Carbone managed bring Italian dining into 21st century without disrespecting integrity it  Its hybrid dining experience  serving vessels themselves remind Grandma Nonnas but food reinvented served most high quality wait staff could ever dream some even being prepared table side almost conjures hibachi type dining experience   I've eaten three times now Deon Dion? most talented waiter ever life  passion food branding colleagues obvious translated talent executing very memorable dining experience    Order spicy rigatoni paired meatballs off menu item if want kick notch ask chili oil rigatoni MUCH BETTER IF THATS EVEN POSSIBLE!!   The wine list thoroughly divine well pricy but fantastic selection  <EOR> Worst dinner ever only good part bread  minestrone soup made everyone table gag squid ink pasta bad vodka pasta nothing special  place worth price please don't here!! <EOR> I joined six friends try new restaurant Aria   ordered Double order Caesar salad Assorted baked clams Foie gras Fettuccini con funghi Spicy rigatoni vodka Spaghetti Julien Meatballs Veal parmesan  Chicken Scarpariello Lasagna verde Bananas flambée Carrot cake  We started two types bread each piece parmigiano reggiano   given menus then waited   approximately 45 minutes sitting down getting menus until order taken   captain busy other tables other things just waited     After ordering long until first items came out   good items meal Caesar salad foie gras spaghetti Julien carrot cake   Julien very good mixture flavors interesting quite tasty   However pasta cooked anywhere near al dente   Everything overcooked something wouldn't expect neighborhood Italian restaurant let alone major Strip hotel   The poorest example dish lasagna verde $75   large container   cut served captain   dish however ruined burnt top   Evidently put under broiler brown top but someone blackened part top permeated every taste took share   soon tasted lasagna said doesn't taste good  When group doesn't finish everything every serving plate  and last piece lasagna finished  you know something wrong   finish dishes   burnt ones however   The room quite loud   very crowded noise conversations filled room   music great   era  basically 1955 1965     From 45 minute wait tell service little lacking   thing hit wrong beginning happened when captain going over specials   He held box two large white truffles he waved Carbone's rather large menus over truffles could rich smell truffles   thought very patronizing   Two side round table blast cold air coming down throughout meal   both wore jackets much meal     Having spent $100 including tip felt more bit disappointed   many very good Italian restaurants off Strip doing better cooking charging less   Fool once! <EOR> Food DELICIOUS!!!!  Started house salad  some bitter lettuce balances dressing  Angel hair pasta steak Diane shared  recommend adding Calabrian pepper oil pasta if spicy  Oh gosh good! Service just ok same last visit  could step part bit  Still giving five stars because food wine list  Dessert tray looks great but never there! <EOR> I say only downside otherwise stellar weekend Vegas older brother stay beautiful Aria which highly recommended another yelp review   average score because Carbone did some wonderful things gates being met waiter sommelier floor Captain all which very accommodating beginning  made recommendations which typically lean towards believe know also began bringing some fresh made salami parmesan cheese which complimentary delicious  brothers treat I night two Prime Bellagio he chose excellent bottle Italian red which must incredible split two don't judge!   Well started Captain's recommendation which caesar salad which made table side per words best Vegas  experience concur delicious  Next course also recommendation Captain rigatoni meatballs which again brother shared equally  again delicious  where unfortunately myself later both experience turned  seemed though may lost entree order busy shuffle many big tables rush new orders truthfully may noticed except fact Captain came once but three times over 30 minute span tell entrees coming right up   They eventually arrived brother having Veal Parmesan myself opting Captain's recommendation unbelievable Short Ribs entree special  must say am short rib aholic don't judge try them pretty much anywhere anytime recommended  Call sort pavlovian response hearing words spoken short rib ordering it  Well took first bite immediately knew something right  But thought maybe mealy chewy nature first bite may bad cut? Then second bite consistency mealy nature did away  flavor? Well brother taste them did without telling thought tasted he said pastrami? Insane right? brother paying over $50 bucks don't know exact cost brother paid pastrami  good pastrami mind bulk  shaved over toasted rye mustard may eaten but two bites quickly feeling appetite away able enjoy  Well 10 minutes Captain comes check doing brother almost finished veal parmesan full plate short ribs   yes know folks should spoken said dog food but waiting meal such anticipation didn't want wait further  Captain did ask if anything wrong meal which always taught service etiquette 101 rather business    A few minutes later come clear plates asking if wanted full plate short ribs packaged room I believe all must tasted them pre service meeting!   follow quickly dessert menus  order tiramisu share brother both order cappuccino  dessert cappuccinos arrive check put table immediately being told take whenever ready  thought odd dropped check A did ask B TGI Fridays Applebee's $$$$ Italian restaurant   In any event while brother acknowledged odd he placed check himself signaling he indeed paying  Within 15 seconds doing Captain came again asking if he could take check  bite dessert full cappuccino's! brother looked said Captain want pay now don't you?   Must another table waiting comment they easily 6 random tables open within view   Captain caught off guard apologized ran off  brother took credit card paid left finishing cappuccinos    So wrap am giving three because am hopeful issues long time tickets frequent reminders same well being given check rather institution waiting guest request same off deals never done again  hope  issue short ribs should happened  awful both flavor consistency believe all staff should opportunity try every meal being offered evening pre service opinions readily received without fear repercussions chef  brother gave lower score but he also paid $750 plus bill every right to  should better  <EOR> While horrible experience staying Aria  good experience restaurant Carbone  OMG bread pepperoni paramesan cheese begining AMAZING  even main course yet blown away!!!
