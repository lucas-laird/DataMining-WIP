Such bullshit  stayed since already ordered drinks but she continued time spent miserable  She talked cell phone ignored people bar unsure common pt drinks  wasn't even busy ALL   Then when person asked leave she put all drinks receipt  really confused when asked split it    I continue but now only late happy hour never when Bartender there  <EOR> Came Sunday night 8 28 16 place wasn't busy 10 people bar another 10 large pool table area   took seat bar while waiting YELP best friend Mimi bartender served IPA nothing normal yet    Once friend arrived thou service took turn worse bartender served earlier socializing didn't come over until 10 minutes Mimi sat down   She ordered beer choice Stella another IPA talked chatted roughly hour then pay tab  bartender oblivious working other side bar other bartender side phone   tried calling them over waved hands attention   Finally Mimi approached asked  bartender phone if could tab lady responded she wasn't served us    really??
