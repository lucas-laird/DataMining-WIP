Maybe they're just pleasantly surprised find semi ok place practically defunct mall? Maybe just off day chef? Maybe never know   Ambiance made place look pretty nice! almost forget you're mall   Service Definitely friendly enough timely enough except secondary server busboy wearing much cologne assumed he'd bathed expected give sales pitch it  literally  using word intended figurative way  stung nostrils every time he came refill waters   huge turnoff when people trying eat smell taste things  can't believe mangers let work that  actual waiter didn't same problem  Also just couple other Mexican places around town prepared multiple people try order guacamole  love guac but hate selling   Food free chips salsa beginning pretty decent  chips remind Mundo if ever there  salsa tad bitter fire roasted side if style you'll really dig it  very spicy st all  ordered calamari carne asada chile relleno  Calamari grilled FYI sure if just didn't see didn't say  good flavor but included way less money most similar offerings don't expect whole plate it  $10 maybe 8 10 small pieces some salad  chile relleno let down especially since listed fan favorite site  basically meat potatoes mushrooms rice beans large green chili red sauce bit cream  meat ok but flavorful expect carne asada be  biggest issue potatoes cooked all way through ended being able eat many them  red sauce bathed very odd way bitter smoky taste so take salsa which good turn bitterness smokiness until obnoxious  sauce seemed   could just though even though he usually really enjoys smoky sauces   NOTES should know happy hour just changed today apparently now 7 10pm instead 5 7  loss your gain! Also don't your hopes sangria cause at least currently menu   Though certainly appreciate friendly service doesn't outweigh taste your food and under cooked ness it especially when supposed house special sorts  plan come back try couple other things update review if those things warrant extra star  <EOR> Good food great happy hour its mall bad rep but more people need check place out! <EOR>
