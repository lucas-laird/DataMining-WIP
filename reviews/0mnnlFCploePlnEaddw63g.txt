Thin Crust Pepperoni $17 75 medium tax total $19 21 which outrageous 1 pizza size toppings  sauce sweet actually liked it  sauce only thing liked  cheese tasted spoiled which completely ruined pizza  pepperoni couldn't even picked off stuck spoiled tasting cheese wouldn't even stick crust  each first bite cheese pepperoni just slid right off all stuck together piece  somehow made through square half it's cut squares then throw rest plate out  taste spoiled cheese just much  Aurelio's Pizza might long loved pizza chain but nothing love wasn't worth money all  <EOR> Tried Super Six The Works pizza last Saturday  ingredients fresh but cheese tasted turned  $25 medium pizza would expect toppings spread around instead dumped place  didn't even slice criss cross cut into little squares  Why would that? <EOR> Being Chicago grew eating Aurelio's  always favorite thin crust pizza area! When family back Chicago last summer visit made sure Aurelio's  delicious usual   My parents retired Las Vegas all thrilled when Aurelio's opened there  would always pick pizza way visit them various Aurelio's locations  even picked over Thanksgiving sole surviving location  Last week first time sat restaurant eat pizza rather having take out   The best part experience last week very friendly attentive staff  also enjoyed looking Chicago memorabilia displayed walls  antipasto salad seemed much more generous when served site rather taking to go   But taste pizza somewhat disappointing  did taste pizza Aurelio's Chicago  really just ok  However imagine still stop again when coming through town nostalgia's sake  <EOR> One real original Chicago pizzerias  Franchises always little hit miss but far location hasn't let down  grew original Aurelio's since very early 80s place gets good right    This location new clean comfortable  Service just ok but when pizza done right couldn't care less!  Get Bosco sticks order your pizza light cheese extra sauce well done  <EOR> This place fantastic food! eaten many times everything tried amazing! definitely love having little gem neighborhood! <EOR> I really wish could give higher rating   but having food original location Homewood Illinois    This location just LACKS   it lacks reasonable pricing lacks taste freshness parent location offers     Hopefully some better deals other large pizza 16 wings 2 liter $40  <EOR> Aurelio's best pizza places ever had  Something cheese top kind bubbles just such unique flavor sauce pinch sweet flavor amazing!! <EOR> Finally Aurelio's Pizza Las Vegas doing right following rules!

Spicy Ravoloi Cheesey Garlic Sticks begin meal   pizza awesome   Service little slow but FOOD great  <EOR> This easy  No Strombolesies no calzones  Pizza way overpriced  Service staff knowledge product marginal best  refer menu answer questions  lots pizza places area survive  <EOR> This place took over dim sum failure last year  Looked forward good pizza place location  The staff very friendly courteous  4 30pm only ones there   We ordered medium thin crust pizza mushrooms olives onions side calamari   The calamari pre manufactured frozen variety freezer burned batter  Hoping pizza better well bite preferred calamari  I can't really explain flavor but worst ever have  First cut Chuck Cheese style square cut served wire grate which possibly only way shouldn't serve gooey pizza   The cheese bizarre blend grainy texture even melted  sauce very thin tomato sauce  mushrooms good !
