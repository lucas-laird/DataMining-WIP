CONS Everything high prices mediocre flavors best bad service  For being higher end fancy restaurant AquaKnox incredibly disappointing  appetizers seafood entrees mediocre best definitely worth prices menu  seasonings all dishes incredibly bland reminiscent bad diner food clashingly distasteful    The wait staff though seemingly professional quite rude  swiftly removed plates guests without waiting people finish made feel rushed almost if wanted door  cannot fathom some glowing reviews  Sure food restaurant may look pretty but entire package  restaurant sign outside showcasing all awards received past    but all them awarded more 2 years ago  Definitely would return  <EOR> This place really good    steak lobster tail bomb   Ive better better price which why give 4 stars  but def would come back again  <EOR> Filet cooked perfectly but nothing special  Lobster bisque overly salty crab cake texture poor  crab cake disappointing taste perspective  While Service kind took while order table    Enjoy  <EOR> The pokë decent   place overly crowded    most part all o sea food served over top some decadent manner ruining simple clean flavor sea food should like   ceviche horrible tasted steamed prawns strong vinegar pickle juice   Caesar salad best average decent black garlic sauce   steamed spinach just steamed spinach    Pinot Noir  ordered tasted cheap $7 bottle trader Joes   sad part best part meal smoked salmon muse brought table when first sat down   all sup par food prices paid twice more going Ruth Chris    Save your money your money expectations different restaurant  <EOR> I actually texted sister right meal raving dinner Aquaknox best while   Well  delirium does you   your judgment gets all clouded   first meal during long weekend Vegas absolutely starving day sun worshipping   restaurant around 10 ish Thursday night place pretty empty   Yet still made wait 25 minutes bar   Finally once ravenous tipsy decided seat booths   Very pretty decor btw   Aquaknox may deceived tipsy self into thinking great meal your fancy decor super nice attentive staff during night come think restaurant Vegas DOESN T super nice attentive staff?
