Worst customer service! <EOR> I ordered Pizza Hut when visiting friend friend mentioned preference   I tried pizza wings potato fries brownie desert  Each entrées extremely salty desert sub par say least   I did care taste any   I happily continue order Dominos  <EOR> Newer location extremely courteous staff  Ordered pizza carryout everything ready time promised   The only drawback toppings seemed bit sparse  Everything tasted delicious but noticeably less toppings expect Pizza Hut  <EOR> You guys seriously moved place old less 5 minutes away house?  Seriously?  happened did replace good pizza pie makers well?  same street!  pizza should stay same!  Horrible   Horrible!  On Friday night least once month family stay home order pizza watch movies   Save some money watch some flicks know?  But being Pizza Hut nearest home now moved way WAY street near 215 freeway now drive nearly 20 minutes each way fix   wouldn't mind if Pizza Hut kept same consistency pies!  You're chain should stay SAME!  So ordered online admit P I T A when order because when Pizza Hut runs special medium pizza $6 99 each unlimited toppings nuts   three house each different tastes   do?  Improvise toppings each 1 2 pizza!  figure if offered online then really shouldn't big deal   each 1 2 all want   done multiple times old Pizza Hut didn't skip beat   Nor pizza ever made bad   With order online all take long drive hill Cheyenne Ave  find new fandangled Pizza Hut   Turns same shopping center Neighborhood Walmart   park whaddaya know busy!  Friday night!  Just paid!  all probably near broke eating Pizza Hut   OK long pizza tasty!  Unfortunately first round pizzas not   some missing toppings pizzas other incorrect crust!  mention crusts looking way flat didn't enough time proof   taking those home manager came told he could two new pies but would take least 20 minutes since backed up   agreed waited   waited   Finally nearly 30 minutes stood asked gal behind counter if reorder done yet   sitting warmer!  Couldn't someone called back right when done?  Geez   Took look round pizzas crusts still looked flat   did order thin crust folks!  Then pizzas forgot crust seasonings well balsamic sauce 'drizzle'   managed fix but rather sloppily   Then other pizza crust did look pretzel all!  should darker brown along crust sea salt sprinkled top!  some weak @$$ pretzel crust telling you   But didn't want wait AGAIN another set pies left trek back home   At least time pizzas toppings weren't scarce shouldn't because ordered 5 toppings each 1 2!  But man guys need lesson placing spinach pizza   guys please please look bit more presentable?  Looks thrown Bryce Harper lob midfield   much power!  enough finesse   Pizzas OK usually enjoy movie night home   all ended CRUST   Toppings good fairly fresh cheese wasn't lacking   horrendous crust holding all together   thin some parts underbaked!  Ugh!  less crisp crunch much chew   could say because toppings but ordered lots toppings pizzas old Pizza Hut before never came back uncooked crusts   DOUGH   Wasn't pulled freezer long enough set proof could rise supposed before baking   know because used work Pizza Hut express back college proof crusts daily   going venture guess didn't enough crusts day because weren't expecting big crowd   some crusts pulled last minute didn't thaw enough yes Pizza Hut uses frozen dough    But come Friday night!  Stoners poor people alike want ordering pizza!  Sorry guys your new location killin' me   Won't back while until settle in   gonna other pizza place  less 5 minutes away   DOMINO'S   Get together folks! <EOR> It's Pizza Hut  when grew up  Hardly any cheese dough buttery fluffy used toppings sparse   take hour deliver when literally live 1 5 miles away  Overall big disappointment  <EOR> Everybody knows Pizza Hut  Pizza Hut don't  new location same pizza old location off Cheyenne Buffalo but think every Pizza Hut same pizza  new location less 5 minutes away house going LOT  always order online best deals always gotten order right  price Pizza Hut Pan Pizzas best pizzas area  Rosati's down street better but twice price gotten order wrong few times  location's service only treated very good no complaints service  never used Delivery Service can't comment that  delivery drivers speeding seen it  Although myself drive 10 MPH over speed limit maybe speeding legal sense speeding  sheer number times ordered pizza can't luck never issue location  really don't understand bad reviews low rating  guess Haters gonna hate hate hate? <EOR> Came way home karate son daughter   Arm inside nice environment greeted koko manager!
