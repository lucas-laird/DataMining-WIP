Poor guy!! Well when came microwaved more chewy crispy!! Double gross! Also pho came lukewarm meat even tho thinly sliced took awhile cook broth!! Speaking broth very tangy gosh really don't kno describe but par way used joked maybe really pissed them off well        bathroom full view dining two employees did before pho just saying!! friend tried adding soy sauce hoisen sauce everything but weird flavor didn't away finally gave ! He only maybe 1 5 if gave ate noodles beef but really couldn't into broth either! left it!! When paying told them didn't if wanted look table see left nothing taken off check no real apology given! think even payed first spring rolls waitress's mistake! 2 people over 35$ know ripped but angry different attitude turn lost customer !! u often every 6 7 weeks but last time definetly last !!

Definitely magic  element pretty much guarantees going good banh mi exactly have    I but absolutely love it  bread delightful should foot long! Alas sandwiches little small  offer tofu option which appreciate but tofu filling especially flavorful  tastes tofu necessarily bad but miraculous  could spice bean curd bit   As pho would describe good flavorless but also best  Plus aren't able serve vegetable filled pho which may know standard judging pho places   Lastly service always haphazard when visited  last time jalapenos  What? unclear if really waiter dining area no consistently checked took while food come out  Plus menu pricing charge doesn't seem same  confused bill both occasions  sure double check your bill if go!
