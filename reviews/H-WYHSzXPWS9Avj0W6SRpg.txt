buffet worth giving  bought five nights prepaid deal deal ends being deal all but we're stuck four more nights won't back Excalibur  <EOR> The customer service awesome but wish say same food   big selection   desert selection bad   fruits sweet   They cappuccino mocha latte etc machine  <EOR> The most disgusting food  I'd rather eat off taco truck then eat there  only thing good dessert  <EOR> they need hire more employees restaurants  all tables buffet full dirty dishes hostess clear table    to managers buffet probably trying save your yearly bonuses among other things hiring more employees but guess what? buffet excalibur looks crap! disorganized dirty dishes everywhere put some dirty dishes empty table next ours few employees looked overwhelmed amount work did even bother ask them coffee floors carpet dirty food quality fair   an absolute mess! last visit even drinks ourselves!    <EOR> The dinner buffet awful    Everything dry sitting long   orange juice didn't taste fresh   Don't even if free meal  <EOR> I Excaliber but lunch buffet basically sucks    Most casinos chip shot breakfast buffet it's hard mess fancy dinner buffet they save good stuff night time but lunch buffet more less throwaway the hotel guests town    For 20 DOLLARS ! expected more bland buffet     no taco shells Mexican station no gourmet meat dishes many sausage dishes etc  those buffets where search around looking something really want your plate just didn't much   Good points own drinks large dessert carousel spacious dining room  Still waaay waaay over priced  food good except some weird smelling beer battered fish but much more average $9 99 buffet  <EOR> Worst buffet Las Vegas  dinner  $25   Crawfish tastes rotten  almost threw front old lady picking plates  Sushi awful  rice hard probably made days ago left frig  only positive thing place dessert  Overall somewhere else  <EOR> There no perceived value buffet   enough different choices each station   nothing would bring back there  <EOR> I've read some very negative reviews Buffet Yelp yet visits positive  breakfast lunch dinner no problems    The food temperature wait staff attentive price reasonable  variety items vast each meal especially lunch dinner  well organized place pay your meal different ways kiosk cashier then quickly taken table  longest wait seated 2 minutes    You purchase All Day pass low price which covers your meals wristband simply walk in    It very clean place wait staff removes used plates efficiently never seen any food floor  Maybe issues past if appears exist no longer    The food tasty carving station custom made omelets crepes wide selection soft drinks juices choose from  area purchase alcoholic beverages though never did     recommend trying Buffet think most people it  <EOR> Very disappointing  Quality  par high school cafeteria  Other Las Vegas buffets within same price range offer much better food  <EOR> Went lunch fly day flight wasn't until 11 PM   space huge wasn't crowded  didn't wait line all  your standard casino buffet fare your Italian Section your Asian section your carved meats your salads your seafood  All food looked nice fresh warm stuff kept warm cold stuff kept cold  dessert area well stocked well  <EOR> Mediocre say least  purchased all day pass able eat lunch dinner   Lunch okay   stuck eating soup salad  served tortilla soup terrible   soup mushy very dissatifying  salad great but can't really mess salad   Everything else line way salty palate  Desserts okay   Just everything prepackaged  Made order crepes good   evening thoroughly enjoyed peal easy shrimp   earlier food felt salt but buffets usually higher sodium prepackaged foods   Carving station overall good    really felt eating cafeteria food   price more affordable most Vegas buffets but next time spend extra $10 better selection   Selection weak  <EOR> it wasn't bad all  sushi little dry  tortilla kind hard  salad horrible  But really liked omlette station roast beef station awesome omlette station guy made omelette huge   But price okay  going MGM but luckily did not  would spent much more dont think quality would much better reading reviews yelp   desert killer though  Really nicely done  chocolate cheese cake thing superb   bad didn't take picture  <EOR> Went Excalibur Buffet dinner past Friday night December 1st must say happy very disappointed indeed  many things change just matter few weeks  No more free draft beer wine during Friday lunch nor any dinner throughout week  Prices remain same even though complimentary alcoholic beverages thing past    They added Rock Crab buffet mixed Dungeness Crab  believe prove huge mistake before long impact those frequent particular buffet quality food  newly introduced Rock Crab Claws felt old stored properly previously frozen very grainy your mouth while eating meat solid plump such Dungeness Crab was  steamed clams also changed very salty time couldn't finish no more 3 clams entire cup    Sour cream continues watery indicating stored correctly warm line  Sour cream should NEVER EVER watery nor soupy consistency indicates risks bacteria unfortunate pleasant time later spent bathroom  no bread sticks asked told shipment just didn't come in  Even small tomatoes mozzarella cheese off flavor tried hard but just couldn't choke them down    There no veal short ribs no cold crab salad usual  Both dishes replaced low end seafood mixture not fresh over cooked some sort last minute thought ham salad creation  addition Chinese food cooked correctly just egg rolls which standard staple ANY Las Vegas Buffett incorrectly cooked over cooked double cooked again making them barely edible pleasant experience indeed  Many new low end dishes debuted improperly cooked dishes remind would normally found lower end Mandalay Bay Buffet    Not sure happened past Friday night but definitely rough Excalibur buffet December 1st 2017   give them another chance sure hope best but if buffet continues spiral downward no choice but research better dining opportunities Vegas  <EOR> Your typical standard middle class buffet  amazing customer service very friendly staff but sure isn't house made food  assuming prepackaged    Not terrible but great either  <EOR> Been several times child adult  used buffet royalty become buffet peasants    Though always huge quality food become similar Home Town Buffet lots seating shows age needing replaced   This buffet paired Luxor all option  Seems good deal but really isn't  lines used hour long wrapped around thunder down under  last time wasn't line feel people came before realized realized many moons ago  fan before used serve horchata but those days long gone    If happen staying hotel t want eat food court then you'll satisfied place  Eat away! <EOR> I'd experience better food options food court rather buffet  Sorry said but needed to  every food item kind liked another item hated  Everything wasn't fresh tell eating them  instance dough crepe good but used fruit may filling  Oh no especially tasted fresh crepes supposed taste ruined meal    The service small bar great  lady engaging informed choices would unlimited beer wine option type wine conversed soon married cousin myself  overall experience wouldn't come back when Vegas again  walk extra miles more food options better price  <EOR> Love buffet definitely best thing if your vegas all day buffet $35 dollars day food really good when first vegas didn't know any better ate italian place spend over $100 gross if your going vegas best place eat save money <EOR> 2 stars mainly because buffet didnt provide fresh food  Its honestly enjoyable bitting into stale bread  <EOR> Thanks ruining once favorite breakfast buffet  Double price half satisfaction

No wonder buffet isn't crowded anymore  word must gotten it  just cheaping showing nothing creative anymore  Such complete disappointment  back  <EOR> Buffets Las Vegas usually crazy expensive usually aren't good   boyfriend basic tastes don't want anything fancy   remodeled buffet changed menu if haven't year two might want try again   great lunch buffet   Only $18 person adults !  also add unlimited beer wine $10 more   selections pretty basic nothing fancy   your standard salad bar pizza pasta taco makings Chinese food carved meats some seafood   also dessert area lots yummy treats   price think great buffet would return again    The thing miss old buffet menu mini corn dogs  THOSE BEST!

If $20 spend buffet you're better off neighborhood local Chinese buffet!   It's bad enough pay parking days but when casino food terrible know hotel going downhill! <EOR> when comes buffets your basic ones  place definitely worth price  Still good food but feels your every day home town buffet  <EOR> Came late dinner around 830  cashier disorganized 3 different lines all jumbled together  food just ok mostly super hungry  Would better off fast food court down hall  even quite good family buffets Home Town Golden Coral  Sizzler puts salad bar shame  <EOR> An attempt made preparing some might refer food  attempt fell woefully flat  appears secret ingredient water   everything tastes boiled    in copious amounts water  favorite menu item dinner roll  Definitely worth 24 99! <EOR> An excellent service Angelica best waitress always respectful attitude feel home thanks Angelica  <EOR>
