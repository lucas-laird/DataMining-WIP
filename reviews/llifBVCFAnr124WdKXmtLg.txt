Lebanese food these!   My friend Nicole going lunch other day decided try Ali Baba Lebanese restaurant  Upon arrival waitress outside greeted friendly hello  entered restaurant couldn't help but take all decor   the Tiffany inspired chandlers paintings wall which turned wall paper pillars long tables dance floor stage set play bands  only group dinners restaurant wasn't any music playing which little unsettling  But decided forth see experience could bring us!  The menu quit detailed if your first time eating Lebanese food you'd know would getting into  all looked good me! ended ordering some hummus tabbouleh shawarma sandwich chicken taouk sandwich  decided would share everything! hummus tasty just should be  creamy smooth buttery taste  tabbouleh amazing finely minced parsley diced tomatoes onions cracked wheat mint extra virgin olive oil lemon juice! Very yummy   I could eat every day! shawarma sandwich good  sandwich usually marinated yogurt spices over night although sure places uses marinade  did come tahini sauce garlic lemon juice seasoned onions sliced tomato pickles  chicken taouk sandwich wasn't good but think  because garlic sauce put it  If dare eat sandwich sure don't close personal someone! chicken char grilled served garlic sauce tomatoes pickles  Both sandwiches came french fries which thought little odd  would preferred small side hummus babganoush instead   Over all stuffed ourselves leftovers! back when craving hummus calling! But would wait till later day when band belly dancers show up!  can't wait see them perform person!   http inapplesworld blogspot com <EOR> Dont't pay credi ATMt card  change tip line  think manager did too  <EOR> FALSE ADVERTISING BEWARE!!!

Outstanding service great kunefe! Definitely worth checking out! <EOR> Bad service!  I say if wasn't music singers on weekends only would never eat drink anything  Since automatic tip policy servers staff could care less if give any service whatsoever  dinner drinks new server waiting almost hour drink! asking several times drink she finally comes over instead getting close table set drink down she grabs tray far table spills all over me! she doesn't even apologize oops then walks off  appalled situation  Any other reputable establishment would comped off entire dinner least all drinks  place didn't even bother only took off 1 drink which she spilled did drank   place horrible  <EOR> Visited place because restuarant com coupon brother had    I printed myself knowing already group  Needless say still coupon  Dont really want again even 25 dollar gift certificate    The food ok best found stuff half price way better flavor texture quality    The shwarna didnt tatse came tradition spit could fried own beef lamb home way better    The chicken moist but bland    Damn miss Zankou chicken   <EOR> Mediterranean buffet? Yes please  $15 culinary treat happens only weekends stopped Sunday  surprised find restaurant pretty empty but never stopped noshing hummus!  The buffet offers approximately 8 hot dishes 4 cold dishes which thought generous offering  hot dishes included beef chicken options  surprised find many vegetarian entrees even eggplant grape leaves beef  terms flavor thought hot options good but perhaps little oily  chicken dishes tender beef all nicely seasoned  However only plate hot goods    For cold dishes hummus tabouleh baba ganoush romaine salad  thought all above average filled second plate these  Sadly pita my preferred serving utensil hummus baba ganoush homemade warmed properly  became hard quickly    When think forgot turn music awkward ambiance  wanted whisper! Service rather nonchalant    If several dollars cheaper may earn fourth star but price tastiness ratio isn't quite pita bread real disappointment  Still weekend gathering pals still good option! <EOR> I came three years ago worst service life  Today came back give last chance because friend only eat halal  only way food way better but server Monica most amazing server years  am bartender know expect good service is  She beyond amazing  would recommend all friends just because her  If lose they're trouble  Thank much Monica being amazing!! <EOR> Well starters if could give them zero stars would  gone many middle eastern restaurants great experiences  very high hopes restaurant but extremely let down  middle eastern background thought would best experience since know everything is  turns wrong extremely disappointed  When first walked door automatically felt unwelcomed  didn't think much sat down enjoy night  night owner manager didn't even care  ask experience but he ask other tables constantly  Then came music talked singer he more then happy when requested Armenian music  thought everyone would enjoy dance along since enjoying there's but wrong  Looks music also unpleasant  recommend restaurant especially Armenian community  only positive experience place server  over all felt unwelcomed am disappointed money spent there  Thank never back no matter what  <EOR> The Maza platter very good here  best   Baba ganoush ever   chicken kabob chicken perfectly flavored  Husband lentil soup taste very good! used best rice pudding but last few times made completely different used be  Much new cook  love place once month highly recommend if you're patient  service bit slow they're more relaxed nature  very nice though if know them  <EOR> I don't think back   Food slightly below average place kind dirty   still food whomever ate table last all over floor place needed vacuumed   Since lunch guess night before    I'd skip place <EOR> I haven't tried everything menu because am such fan mazza grand mezza platters!  much good food generous portions very reasonable price  <EOR> I dinner  almost empty weekday night went  Food good particularly salad  Service attentive though only waiter  Nice environment  Located mall difficult find  Prices reasonable  Good place Arabic food  <EOR> The food delicious atmosphere quite pleasant  only complaint server hovering while we're deciding order asking every 30 seconds kind hovering then nowhere found time food till finally flagged down checks   My experience server enough keep going back though <EOR> I really love food place  mezze combination enough feed 4 people easily delicious  standard stuff hummous babaganoush lebni but most interesting treats kibbe mindblowing bean concoction which intensely garlicky beans buttery melt your mouth also serve some pastries similar mini spanakopitas well chunks feta olives some fresh jalapeos could thing's forgotten mention sure  also some entrees sandwiches all them excellent  Definitely seek place out    One word warning live music Saturday's Fridays wacky Mediterranean music belly dancer walks around all tables nothing wrong except bit loud able sustain conversation over dinner  <EOR> I hate give sucky review but  just experience was  Rude service m shawarma way salty full garlic    Just horrible all around  top everything fork dirty ask another one  <EOR> I regret say dinner experience quite terrible here  food bad spinach pie off soup rancid    The service slow  left table waiting 30 minutes waiting check declined dessert    Not many vegetarian options  <EOR> Our first time here  food great but service excellent!
