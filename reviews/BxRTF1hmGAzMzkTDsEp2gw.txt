Jim Cramer CNBC talking stock price casually ask wifee heard Panera?

The staff pleasant accommodating but did see delivery team walking back past dirty tables stopping clear them maybe arent motivated keep things clean? worried clean kitchen maybe   If aren't hungry average food 4star prices place you! <EOR> The only reason star because to  Having worked food industry know okay big black bug someone's sandwich definitely okay  back ever again  Thanks but no thanks panera  <EOR> $40 two adults child eat lunch here? Charges extra when omitting substituting item such chicken bacon $0 75 gives crumble bacon? Staff friendly but floors full debris bathrooms stink horribly  No thanks! When manager Brian location great   new manager needs clue  Clean your establishment stop being skimpy your toppings because you'll loose customers long run!!
