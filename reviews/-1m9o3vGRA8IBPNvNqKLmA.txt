such unique dish flavors delicious    The table ordered petite filets rib eyes  Everyone's steaks cooked exactly requested melted your mouth  charr crust tasty  Whenever Truffle mac n cheese menu can't pass up  did disappoint! almost order seconds because fast    For desert ordered hot fudge sundae 4 spoons  presentation beautiful  many different toppings choose from  Everyone left satisfied    My only boo restaurant don't espresso machine  only French press coffee  Still super delicious tasty but really wanting espresso martini dinner  Oh well  <EOR> First let say charged $25 parking   The place very dark   like good luck reading menu dark   felt close neighbors well   couldn't see them much hear every word came mouths     Got baked crab cake start   Its weird    mild fishy flavor which very odd because crab doesn't very strong fish flavor  would certainly order again   Ordered 10 oz filet mignon   came cooked more liking   Asked medium came more medium well   Normally would complain such things small however when you're paying price then suddenly little bit more nitpicky   Now let's talk flavor   Bland tasted someone grocery store picked cut cooked it  No prep no spicing no additional flavoring any kind  did come some weird yellow stuff silver cup   oh piece parsley   did try yellow stuff   I think off top head least 10 different places including own kitchen better steaks place  top don't pay $25 parking any other places would rather to   So guess bottom line if looking someplace where able see hear all your neighbors conversations you'll pay exorbitant amount money parking you'll pay premium price some mediocre steak well then place you  <EOR> What GEM!
