Everything great but careful gill apps entree desserts tend best part entire menu  <EOR> Ugh  definitely disappointing experience  every meal five stars but price better edible several items not    Like poster previous say edamame absolute best ever eaten bread basket lives its reputation  But entrees absolute disaster well appetizers    The calamari spongy served inexplicably soy dipping sauce did nothing calamari  pizza flatbread could good but completely overloaded competing flavors    The meatloaf very tasty but nothing special other exactly you'd expect meatloaf    All all most expensive meal Las Vegas least 50% easily absolute worst  <EOR> This review based poor service   friend stopped Simon glass wine appetizer around 6 pm Saturday night   very few customers bartenders talking each other   finally came over said he would right then proceeded enter another order POS system   asked menu he said hold minute   opted borrow menu another customer bar   point decided just glass wine then leave   tried attention bill but no luck   walk opposite end bar hand credit card  <EOR> I don't often dine strip eat casino restaurants but fiance enjoy trying new places eat when found coupon place decided go    The restaurant lounge placed other tower Palms away casino other restaurants  initially difficult find but once found enjoyed laid back semi trendy atmosphere restaurant    When first arrived told because didn't reservation only seating available bar  little odd since only 20% tables diners them but whatever table bar fine    Overall food fantastic  spanish octopus little bit tough but sauce amazing  ahi tuna entree perfect fiance raved rigatoni  only dish didn't love truffled macaroni taste truffle oil over powering weren't able finish dish  Which disappointing because looked amazing would much better minus truffle oil all together    We also lemon ricotta cheese cake chocolate pudding cake dessert both which excellent  also offer cotton candy junk food platter which think little gross sure why anyone would order food county fair 7 11 nice restaurant but apparently really popular    Overall really nice dining experience  sure would way come back but if ever Palms again movie something if guests town staying hotel would recommend Simon  <EOR> Had brunch very good   Different style eat order buffet   Frosted flakes french toast best   toasted rice cali rolls also unique awesome!

Such creative idea    I would definitely recommend Simon anybody Vegas search great lunch happy hour dinner spot  Being poolside restaurant many options when comes your visit bar also impressive say least  visit completed running into only George Maloof hotel lobby! <EOR> Well if could give 2 4 would need understand am A OK it   read some good reveiws staying Hotel thought happy hour would great first stop night   Its food lacking okay   service inconsistant! bar tenders spot description food accurate mouthwatering  other couldn't find ass both hands he didn't seem nice just little lacking understanding slow uptake    We Big Eye Tuna fantastic grilled just right meaty well seasoned  Mac cheese utter disappointment  Hell Velvetta shells cheese step up     Drinks strong well made  But overall visit just below average left wanting more   stayed Hotel four days never back if tells anything   Oh yeah more thing left give little tip sticky plastic covered menus diners wanna chic bars   Take damp dishcloth wipe all surfaces menu clean them repeat all menus!  two disgusting  <EOR> We staying @ Hotel lunch   Loved crispy sesame rise must try   Very dis appointed salad   place loosing money young beautiful actually love mostly white stems instead actual romaine leaves    turkey Cobb complete disappointment much would venture Denny's serves better salad even head lettuce! Our server great ideas suggestions but much follow through     Perhaps dinners better  <EOR> For birthday year March22 decided instead doing traditional dinner would something little bit different  when decided Sunday brunch Simon's would perfect new experience! made reservations Open Table three weeks prior first time doing so   very easy   arrived Simon's right time 12 30 reservation told would few extra minutes until table ready  didn't mind because figured its pretty difficult facilitate reservation times all eat buffet  all party two ended staying 2 hours! finally sat ten minutes later hostess decked men's dress shirt high heels adorable!   really crowded bit loud  weather terrible day would imagine normally sliding doors wide open isn't loud   Our server pleasant and wearing PJ's showed menu could order off addition items buffet line  She took  drink order  decided all drink mimosas $16   little disappointed when she said Bellini's day  fiance ordered all drink bloody marys $7 bloody mary bar  drink arrived buffet chef cut huge plate mixed fresh juicy fruit me  Very fresh   enough two picked fruit plate entire meal  chef also made fresh fruit smoothie   so delicious! ordered menu french toast chicken waffles first  Loved french toast!! turned favorite thing ate day    so sweet   and encrusted corn flakes  waffles good fiance enjoyed chicken  fiance then panini buffet homemade panini made    good nothing crazy though  then ordered menu ribs white trash section menu   and margherita pizza we two hours OK! its buffet   you pig out! pizza very good  all said done    our dessert arrived    THE JUNK FOOD PLATTER!!

The whole experience awesome can't another special occasion back  oh yes   its pricey breakfast    $38 per person plus drinks worth it! Looking back many more things offered both buffet menu would try just didn't room all day! <EOR> I hosted Pole Expo Palms past two years used Simon Restaurant opening reception registration  minute signed agreement end expo all staff people behind scenes Simon simply incredible easy work very accommodating     Simon beautiful located sunset view strip food perfect  All 400 guests attended reception very impressed well  Living Las Vegas lot choices Pole Expo but know choose best place taking into account location food service hours flexibility catering needs    I am looking forward hosting 2014 Pole Expo Simon Palms  Thank Simon Restaurant! Until next time <EOR> I'm fan Kerry Simon's restaurants made priority come since closing next month  Clearly waited long food mediocre but more importantly staff already completely checked out   Manager present visible throughout visit walked past three dishes waiting sushi bar nearly 10 minutes but didn't even glance them let alone take them table  server polite when he around but twice prompt someone bring dishes ready waiting within eyesight   We spent $60 HH items but most them nothing but average sushi bland rolls rice heavy salmon sashimi cut paper thin for $10 no effort balance flavors all  chicken flatbread nicely crispy but basic calamari decent but overall quality did match restaurant's reputation prices   Considering thoroughly overstaffed 1 2 employee customer ratio service dismal  walked door four employees chatting hostess stand including manager  single them even looked walked past them door absorbed conversation  Good riddance  <EOR> Simon says eat brunch immediately   So good!  few things loved best a Fruit smoothie bar where bowl all fruit want exact proportions want  b Crepe panini bar mere notion which set hear aflutter   desperately need more varieties though   choices very limited  c fab sushi chef made excellent veggie rolls which somehow really well breakfast food  d order anything want off brunch menu too   some party meant chix waffles spare ribs but meant PERFECT FRENCH TOAST   Seriously frosted flake French toast might best ever except maybe mom's  d Drinks unlimited   may very tipsy shopping gambling karting whatever's next your agenda  e cap off dessert   DESSERT!  you've eaten your fruit crepe French toast still bring dessert!  still eat it!  I swear three days later still full happy   It's cheap brunch drink tip came $70 per person but worth it   They handled group 16 easily   Kerry Simon actually house when answering own phone host desk   Adorable  <EOR> Hands down worst restaurant experience ever Vegas  Which really shame because loved staying palms place front desk service phenomenal  When group restaurant hostess sat wasn't busy  20 min waiter came drink order walked off  overheard table behind talking poor service should leave  waiter then talks female co worker ten minutes before coming back re take order because he didn't write down thought he could remember it   apparently difficult  sit wait another 15 20 notice tables around looking irritable gets leaves  try wave waiter over he ignores it   we leave never even drinks hour there  recommend anyone  <EOR> Wow! brunch  really good  even saw holly madison there! crazy! Dinner fab well  <EOR> The setting sexy contemporary gets better sun sets  menu playful always enjoy that  zucchini bread complimentary great start fun meal   Appetizer fantastic always enjoy good sushi roll  $24 burger ok great  Definitely worth price tag  When noticed junk food dessert couldn't resist  When delivered table all eyes could focus hot pink Marie Antoinette cotton candy which fantastic! However all other goodies nasty  cookies stale rice crispy treats tasted few days old muffin looking things hard rock no dramatization when waiter came over hit against table he embarrassed  Unfortunately left taste mouths   It's beautiful spot but somebody paying attention details matter  When you're paying top $ dinner expect lot more rock hard muffins I disappointed  <EOR> The crispy creamy shrimp appetizer delicious  definitely worth getting  good split three people  15 20 small shrimp  exactly described fried but creamy sauce    I rainbow roll  okay  Nothing spectacular    My friends sat bar  Fabian Becky bar serving us  hostess claimed restaurant booked but hardly any people there  Fabian Becky nice attentive   The restaurant pretty small  windows face roof pool cabanas which also small  only restaurant Palm's Place  across Drift Spa    We only place because credit during stay  probably wouldn't back unless another credit  <EOR> Went brunch few weeks ago  saving could also unlimited mimosas best $20 ever spent  Definitely if ask Patrick won't disappointed   He knew right amount food very attentive kept drinks coming  Most food tried good didn't really care cinnamon rolls French toast sorry everyone thought gift palette   Oddly enough sushi really good which thought would hate 11am  love honeycomb baguette  Overall worth try experience but sure would pay $40 again food  <EOR> This restauarant odd location would never found if didnt friends happy hour    Food okay bad spectacular   Overpriced happy hour mac cheese okay    Service okay   waiters seemed little lost 5 different people come different times honestly no idea server was   friend ordered fried calamari server put order FIVE orders calamari   couldnt understand why he took order calamari walked away asked another server if could continue placing food order he said want more 5 calamari?  Wait what?  Thank god asked would butt load calamari delivered table    Nice place odd location un friendly servers arent bad just disorganized barely polite   Overpriced but am all more bang your buck  <EOR> Buckle going fun!

Hot damn good! such different twist such typical sushi roll  pleasantly surprised! Definitely stop tucked away gem  <EOR> I enjoying Kerry Simon's place Vegas since way back when Hard Rock nearly 10 years ago  Simon Palms Place great maintains some Kerry's foods fun twist but he managed old establisment opinion more variety much much better facility much better atmosphere always felt closet Hard Rock but Palms Place location stunning  Prices more fair quality quantity food  fallen love some flatbread selections highly recomend trying appitizer  eaten several times service always great last minute reservations usually managable  Service always excelent way should be  If staying Palms Palms Place highly recomend Simon but if staying the strip might little off beaten path some  <EOR> Service non existent  guy cleans tables needs smile once while   Our waitress just came once see us  food great  <EOR> I'm bumping 3 star review because food   Met few friends dinner last night  9 45 reservation but ended being seated 10 30  Theo General Manager very apologetic but girl working front desk major attitude problem   Oh well food ambiance service excellent  ordered Edamame Cucumber rolls appetizer  Edamame world  wok fry Edamame then toss some lime Tagorashi  Cucumber Rolls nothing special   I ordered thin crust Spinach pizza entree while friend Citrus braised short ribs  probably best thin crust pizza ever  crust light chewy just way pizza crust  don't eat meat but friend couldn't stop raving Short ribs    To compensate wait brought huge bowl cotton candy huge slice Banana chocolate pie share  big dessert's but friend devoured everything under 10 minutes  definitely see myself dining again  give try  <EOR> We breakfast because received $50 credit Simon Restaurant courtesy Palms Place   love decor place its very cute pool side   ordered french toast brioche side hash browns order OJ bf ordered steak eggs  brioche crusted frosted flakes really delicious   steak looked dry but wasn't     They also chic little herb garden display sushi bar   All very cute   would come back if credit again because place pricey     Oh don't know if matters but believe he worked Cat Cora Iron Chef America  <EOR> Do Simon if you 1  staying Palms already exhausted all other food choices    2  drunk already burned off all your tastebuds  3  going order Spicy Yellowtail Roll dessert    4  Don't listen server's drink recs Naia wine Spain horrid  5  Stay away Rainbow Roll Mackerel Nigiri Scallop Sashimi     Pool gorgeous night fall but restaurant fails many levels spotty food didn't help  <EOR> Took few family wife's b day brunch  She impressed  daughter liked sushi sushi chef very nice accommodating  view atmosphere much better food  food good but pricey quality  <EOR> We Sunday brunch place almost perfect unfortunately stuck worst server place we could tell because all tables around getting great service    setting ideal pool palms place bright tons windows   felt little oasis away strip   You could tell lot original thought into sunday brunch bunch things I'd never really encountered before buffet candy bar breakfast pizza pyjama attire junk food dessert white trash menu fresh smoothie bar etc etc    Refreshing days where every bar tends copy each other calling itself some derivation social house same decor same food same overpriced food same same   give something unique! Anyways getting off topic but all really need say simon Sunday brunch really worth checking best food establishments Vegas   Perfect setting delicious food unique concept   bit pricy $38 per person but think worth it   If want take advantage deluxe bloody Mary bar champagne bar extra $   A couple favourites meal simon roll sushi bar junk food platter sure use take out container carmel corn stock candy bar way out  freshly made smoothies tried couple liked berry best the chocolate protein least <EOR> Waitress forgot abou flag bar tender order food   When came pizza fries terrible hollow    Even getting terrible service continued ordered filet mignon   I'd think being snazzy resturant would take care patrons failed misserably   Pass place <EOR> This place wretched  1  maybe three other tables took FOREVER food  2  surf turf tacos good  Paprika no business taco  better canned salsa  3  made mistake ordering dessert peanut butter candy bar  Again bad  no peanut butter wasn't even really sweetness  Honestly am pretty easily pleased especially when peanut butter tacos involved! mess up?! <EOR> Food good service sucked no stars that! My parents town staying Palms Place met them Simon breakfast  ordered three coffees only receive two  fruit plate start only receive later entrees  wanted extra cream cheese lox bagel remind server three times before ever receiving it  When he came refill waters he only refilled three empty glasses even though pitcher full  ??? found odd  place almost entirely empty except three other tables  I'm service industry strip usually give other servers benefit doubt but pretty bad   The only consolation 10% off Palms Place Spa showing your receipt breakfast mom massages! <EOR> By far BEST edamame ever had!!!! No longer order anywhere else  promise never back steamed edamame again   disgusting comparison Simon's charred epic party mouth  <EOR> The Sunday pajama brunch continues greatest thing ever  All servers wear pajamas guests encouraged wear theirs and actual warm fuzzy pjs sexy Vegas lingerie     And bottomless beer and or mimosas and or bellinis and or make your own bloody marys  Personally fan bloody marys but love them here  enjoy playing around different vodkas salts veggies fruits hot sauces  Oh many hot sauces!  The actual food offerings great fun! buffet grab yourself offerings everything dirt cups sushi rolls crepes jumbo shrimp  menu items which made just brought your table everything breakfast pizza lobster brioche french toast M M pancakes  then course there's all junk food platter all candy bowls  just such fun place environment!  The restaurant itself floor ceiling windows sits right pool nice view  <EOR> Totally disappointed brunch omelette small still hungry eating toast  All fork stick fork jar jam put toast could cut toast eat whole no knife my friend burger plain ordinary burger worth price $4 00 ice tea just colored water no tea flavor all  restaurant very pretty food worth price busboy came table dirty white tennis shoes dirt all over black apron  such beautiful upscale restaurant would expect much more way comp would never pay food never back  <EOR> Let preface saying always willing spend good money good food  patient willing look past minor details most people would complain about  But even kind leniency all sake food Simon still disappointment   First waitress filled water glasses Fiji water without giving any other options busboy top off every sip which would normally good thing only later tell asked $9 bottle which bad thing   Second entrees okay  think prepartying expensive water tricked into thinking food better really was  curries weren't anything spectacular meatloaf meatloaf pasta okay  Third when asked boxes waitress paused few seconds while looking food said    sssuuurrreee    Even less sensational review few plusses 1 edamame best ever lightly grilled seasoned sea salt other spices 2 calamari turned standard appetizer into something tastier lime salt spices made perfectly fried calamari delicious 3 tiger roll pretty damn good  But good appetizers don't worthy restaurant experience  ambiance warm design modern view outdoor pool gorgeous trip trip itself  But other wasn't worth it  <EOR> This tell all    walking waiter returns sushi sushi chef because he made avocado suppose made without  chef visibly annoyed waiter said don't new just scrape off avocado HE DID! right manager alerted because if person eating allergic something! He pretty much just stared said nothing while telling then finished saying oh  good take care it  slowly walked see he would he did NOTHING!  The creamed spinach extremely salty sushi order made wrong first time when came back correct didn't eat because crab tasted fishy long without proper storage it spoiled just praying don't sick!!

AWFUL EXPERIENCE SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICES!! <EOR> Our visit nice romantic good service delicious food   meatloaf enjoyed it  wish gone brunch could junk food box  Maybe next time  <EOR> This review brunch experience past Sunday  w gf both dinner before but never brunched   First all love  pajama dress code wait staff  and all nice pajamas Wal Mart shoppers lol!

The age old debate settled once all Simon Restaurant   I think design because you'll traverse two buildings board two elevators ride two very long moving walkways called sky tubes through dark twisting turning hallways before finally locating place   You've just championed Darwin's theory survival fittest   Because no one sporting walker cataract glasses oxygen rig cane dare attempt long arduous journey fear untimely ending  Their fate? first floor lunch buffet    And yours?  Simon   What's old adage? victor spoils? Well your long walkabout unrewarded friend find yourself spoiled food service surroundings fine establishment   The decor its well appointed interior  The pool area showcased through floor ceiling glass walls   Fashionistas everywhere laughing sipping colored beverages adorned little parasols acting though nobody world matters but them   Businessmen Armani suits  And sun seekers  pool wearing swimsuits fashioned only small length colored thread    Then there's food  A pre meal bread basket pretzel zucchini bread  A french dip sandwich sumptuous both its imagery flavor linger hours  A tenderloin salad all usual accouterments neatly compartmentalized suit even most anal eating habits   You've found Mecca Las Vegas eateries  It's time your wife asks heard Simon   I suppose could lie explaining watched Iron Chef America episode where Kerry Simon unmercifully Cat Cora into submission but she'd know  bullshitting since only watch shows Pawn Stars Hillbilly Handfishin'  Just tell truth once   You bad directions mens room wound here  For once she'll appreciate your uncanny sense direction  <EOR> One favorite places Vegas!

Of course no meal complete without adult libation full service bar fully stocked create anything desire    I prefer Rum Ginger Tea Lemongrass Drop    Make sure save room dessert including Kerry's Big Bowl Cotton Candy  fun dish share others  But if adventurous side try Junk Food Platter bring back some great childhood memories    You might even Kerry himself stop your table check he does very often  <EOR> Sunday brunch must reason why 1 unlimited champers bloody Mary bar very reasonable 16 10 bucks 2 some best unlimited sushi jumbo prawns 3 great chefs 4 bring small dishes loveliness 5 hard weekend partying hard dressing PJ's being served Doctors nurses very welcome! <EOR> I read some other reviews expected much more   would never pay regular price food quality got   review Travelzoo menu $99 two which still seems bit overpriced but did include passes clubs Moon Ghostbar   The ambience casual side overlooks pool area   sushi bar regular bar inside   started evening peach bellini that tasted nothing peach watery sangria   Bleh   1 star drinks   Our amuse bouche crispy sushi rice   crispy but rather chewy  rice heavy well executed  2 stars  starting see why place crowded   Appetizers spicy tuna roll Caesar salad ok   nothing special dressing bit heavy salt  2 stars   Hubby's Chicken Curry decent little spicy fruity pineapple chutney  pan roasted sea bass  While fish itself cooked nicely presented skin top which crispy all  poor attempt pan roasting skin soft chewy   would better if left off  2 5 stars   Mac n cheese gratin good sized portion share but unfortunately neither wanted eat it  mac n cheese creamy cheesy disappointingly floury tasting  2 stars   Dessert!
