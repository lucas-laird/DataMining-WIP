My husband staying resort gave voucher towards dinner Mad Onion Hooters Casino   Although we'd never decided w open mind  Trying find something healthy menu near impossible  husband finally settled crab legs settled grilled fish  Unfortunately crab legs skinny couldn't any meat off them  waitress came even she admitted didn't look good brought new plate marginally better  Then waitress jokingly said suppose don't yours either?? Sheepishly said well now mention fish covered w a heavy flour  gravy w sugar which ruins taste fish  Plus good part reason ordering fish watch your calories  menu didn't indicate gravy  addition menu said fish came w garlic mashed potatoes  There's nothing garlic potatoes just scoop plain instant flavorless mashed potatoes  waitress said other patrons same complaint  Despite she didn't ask if I'd anything else instead  She just swooped plate away w even asking if okay told she would only charge 1 2  entree  husband looked each other dumbfounded hungry  spent entire rest meal watching husband eat  Luckily wine sip on! Then bill came husband noticed full price  he gently reminded she said she'd take 1 2 off meal  She told manager told she couldn't since eaten some it  Well would known wasn't expecting if hadn't tried it? she offered manager really young guy w 0 personality customer relations skills  He obviously trained because he kept insisting he wasn't going anything even though food clearly different menu described  If going pay full price entree waitress should left table could least eaten broccoli tried scrape gross gravy stuff off eat some fish  all more expensive things menu  said I'd never heard restaurant didn't offer something else if your food bad  He said he cuz people try take advantage them  Well very offended  because husband seasoned travelers stay all top resorts   never HOOTERS despite heard cheesy reputation woman convinced said Mad Onion wasn't typical Hooters  She's right that! worse! least normal Hooters wouldn't all casino smoke etc  We're used being treated badly! Horrible experience! <EOR> Walked 2 30am early Monday morning  only handful people restaurant  seated quickly very nice server named Karen  ordered All American  Home Fries awesome  There's lot bad reviews Yelp imagine comes when restaurant very busy  If Hooters restaurant packed then probably end eating place  able good breakfast meal under 10 bucks good service  would eat again  <EOR> The downfall restaurant food sub par possibly palatable   boyfriend took gamble $9 99 12 oz prime rib bad he barely touched then stared plate until offered some sandwich which certainly wasn't cat's meow either   When sat down dinner hadn't eaten over 12 hours   mozzarella sticks item might order again if bother coming bad which wouldn't   wait staff friendly no complaints there   restaurant nice enough looking but bench seating kind low table seemed wide spacing between benches   sort felt table infringing personal space   Bottom line skip place   feeling certainly would if hadn't convenient hotel's location  <EOR> They advertising 14oz NY Steak all over hotel $19 99  order 25 minutes T Bone  tell waiter ordered NY  He said don't want T bone? kidding me?
