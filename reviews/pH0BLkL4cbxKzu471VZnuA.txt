We stayed some dinner afterwards some unbelievable sushi! <EOR> I'm absolutely obsessed franchise  Having both locations NYC Miami Chicago numerous times finally made way Sushi Samba strip  Without doubt Vegas crème de la crème them all  combination food staff music hospitality above beyond  manager Rannah incredible most importantly genuinely cared service experience restaurant  She sweet enough give complimentary delicious mojito loyalty brand  LOVE!   The must haves seared beef tapas yellowtail taquitos seabass miso  might cried little bit  indulging all food ordered  good! Bottomline Sushi Samba across board phenomenal but Vegas Strip certainly wins gold medal  highlights during particular trip  suggest other Sushi Samba venues take notes Vegas operates  location wins gold medal point view continues earn loyalty    FYI Sushi Samba pretty pricey but worth service atmosphere! <EOR> This far best meal Vegas! Isabella amazing server!    She suggested taste menu did disappoint!  catered gluten free needs food amazing  Overall amazing food service!  Can't wait come back! <EOR> Amazing meal   Did chef's tasting   Wagu beef gyoza hot stone tops   Also loved pepper appetizer  <EOR> Way overpriced mediocre sushi  Two drinks two rolls $85     What! guess  Vegas you! <EOR> My boyfriend decided dinner seeing reviews yelp based fact walking distance hotel  atmosphere nice service decent sushi wasn't bad but wasn't anything spectacular write home about  aware everything around Vegas strip going pretty expensive but considering price greatly disappointed definitively worth money left feeling completely unsatisfied  <EOR> While celebrating 4th July Vegas craving sushi  buddy lunch SushiSamba came back hotel raving amazing was  asked if he'd down back dinner No Doubt!   girls front restaurant beautiful bubbly sincerely sweet  helped seated right away bar  head Chef named Herb came personally greet since buddies second time day  Chef Herb talked few minutes then sent some complimentary dishes show appreciation appreciation food  build loyalty business  sure your customers feel welcomed appreciated business bring you    The food amazing top restaurants such Nobu Naoe Zuma price difference between two would pick sushisamba hands down  ambiance decor awesome  server Japanese girl game taking care many tables once still took time chat us  Highly recommend spot! <EOR> Even though pricier side worth it  soul happy ate here  fact soul asked eat twice here  happily obliged  first time only quick snack drink but second time actually ate meal review second time    I should give caveat particularly familiar authentic Brazilian Japanese food  said found fusion restaurant both intriguing completely intoxicating    The waitress first time good but really remember second waiter Max  He very attentive gave fantastic recommendations but wasn't pushy it  Most importantly tell he's actually EXCITED food  made huge difference because seeing someone excited tell ingredients food prepared flavors going together really adds wonderful food experience opinion  waiter ended recommending $60 per person meal tasting menu sorts  sounds lot but given prices really very fair considering amount food got  such going talk every little thing but more highlights    The Peruvian Corn addicting  little closer hominy side corn spectrum but buttery just bit texture  If doesn't come side absolutely recommend trying separate side dish  DOES come side sea bass skewers which think single most favorite thing tried there  buttery delicious flavorful little bites  wish could describe better just flavorful but even sure describe delicious was  just say while eating hoped would never stop so inappropriate but can't help it she said     Hamachi tacos plate various sashimi incredible  liked sashimi just little more because bold flavors sauces surprisingly married well fish flavor without overpowering it    The most surprising part night sushi roll included melted mozzerella  Yes  Mozzerella salmon  skeptical took few tries used but once did warm blanket  If push aside weirdness good roll    Another piece fabulosity yellowtail seviche they spell   tangy but still let other flavors show items along sea bass absolutely order again next time am Vegas    Last but certainly least waiter concocted duck hot pot us  much exposure duck weary but buttery sauce lots mushrooms incredibly silky rich  Needless say all food STUFFED!!!

Unless you're glutton punishment suggest dine elsewhere  We dined since staying Palazzo but costly mistake  sashimi platter traces fish bone it!! We sipped cocktails TWO HOURS before entrees came out!! Perhaps servers strategy entice order more alcohol but food addict alcoholic  don't mind waiting good food but 2 hours im even counting when seated counting when finished appetizers entrees just ridiculous  5 courses churrasco extremely DRY don't bother trying dipping sauces accompanied unless control your gagging reflexes   The only good part meal kobe but then again kobe! mess kobe??? For better dining experience suggest try Yellowtail Bellagio instead many other countless fine dining restaurants strip  Why would want pay food poisoning?? don't DUH  why don't eat here  <EOR> SUSHISAMBA place if looking awesome meal middle Strip reasonable prices   staff professional friendly making enjoyable experience   dress code casual but sloppy attire  Reservations recommended however should choose walk find yourself having wait bar conveniently located next host booth   If looking ultimate dish then suggest Hot Rock   rock heated 700 degrees cook thinly sliced Kobe beef myriad sauces toppings   favorite sushi place Vegas now taken top spot!! <EOR> I eaten SushiSamba Dallas while back really enjoyed food looking forward Las Vegas location see if lived food memories   reservations 9 00PM Las Vegas Marathon runner friends could nice recovery meal wasn't heavy   wasn't far away hotel!

Quite lot food meal wanted light  The tacos decent I'd say 3 5 stars  Interesting try but wouldn't say I'd order them if return  skewers however 5 5  corn huge chewy while skewers well flavored cooked unbelievably tender  am immensely grateful manager suggested most unique dishes ever had  would recommend any customer well  I didn't try boyfriend's roll because don't shrimp sushi but roll pretty good  wanted Samba roll but settled Maine lobster roll  may difficult believe but thought little much lobster roll don't hurt !

He brought some amazing dishes the corn accompanies sea bass insanely good ahi tacos stellar though could probably done couple fewer dishes  left absolutely stuffed very impressed    I'm sure could kept under $100 not including drinks if order own we LOT food including few orders probably wouldn't agenda but if you're okay price range laid know stuff! All around good experience  would again but now tried quite few things would prefer place own order  <EOR> Second time Sushi Samba never let's down    The first time Sushi Samba bit worked over Vegas weekend decided order Berkshire Porkbelly Ramen OMG  all say  craving soup year come back    When ordered Ramen main course  everyone table making fun but last laugh when everyone crazy over soup!   The service slow but did wave corkage fee when ordered few bottles sake  <EOR> Everything delicious  Almost Minus star really having salmon belly  Hamachi belly real wasabi root definitely worth it  yellowtail tacos small but refreshingly great  Pork belly always awesome  sea bass miso very well flavored highly recommend  <EOR> The rudest hostesses any upscale restaurant addition most abnormally pathetically impolite bartender  Staying Palazzo walked enjoy cocktails small bite  empty restaurant bar told did any chairs if wanted eat could only eat while standing  ridiculous  profile people proud themselves  Hiring managers should check basic etiquette people hiring restaurant services business  SushiSamba failed all fronts  <EOR> Isabella did amazing job suggesting rolls drinks  awesome dinner friends bachelorette party  would absolutely come back special event nice dinner  <EOR> You can't any better place  Oh gosh  never sushi good  Everything DELICIOUS  came large group did $60 per person deal WOW   So much food  extremely satisfied  Definitely must visit radiant while Vegas  <EOR> Came quick snack while shopping  Service slow food took while even bar  some riceless hand rolls but fish just ok  better sushi Vegas  <EOR> Intrigued Japanese South American fusion going rather good Yelp reviews ended group late dinner Sunday night during recent trip Vegas  seated promptly reserved time   The service immediately kind odd  waiter did give menus other drinks but instead started talking if particular budget mind could send enough food fill budget  Butbutbut   I saw menu online! knew menu  wanted CONTROL!

Took forever order food pay  ask them beginning end meal split check still screwed likely because five different people waited three kitchens  Ridiculous  only paid attention when trying upsell something  suggestion? Take money your overpriced cutesy fusion menu sink into some lessons customer service  Worst dining experience ever had  <EOR> Every day since vacation Vegas come place  literally best next time come November sure come back AGAIN!

SUSHISAMBA made huge impression very first time visited 2011  Food service ambiance decor = always impressive amazing! Since then celebrated two birthdays always point visit each every time visiting Las Vegas    During first few visits I'd dine unique sushi rolls aji panca sauce made Peruvian chili peppers especially tiradito Peruvian style sashimi   would often order kanpachi tiradito yuzu sea salt black truffle oil yellowtail tiradito jalapeño lemongrass  both absolutely amazing unlike anything ever before! remember first time dined friend ordered tiradito  enjoyed sauce much each ordered second bowl rice just could finish sauce left over plate put top rice wouldn't waste!   But THEN!  I no longer order tiradito made such impression me  Now since 2014 absolute must visit favorite sushi chef SUSHISAMBA AMAZING Chef John Um creates most unbelievable OFF THE MENU omakase style plates edible sushi art and most likely ever seen! Chef John only takes pride selecting freshest quality fish sushi bar staff serve but man's work inspired art incredible plates sushi reflect perfectly  He also chooses fish never tried seen menu any other sushi bar to  sushi seems influenced Peruvian tiradito often creates unique sauces he adds onto canvas like plates dabbed onto each piece sashimi sushi which enhances flavor fish  sauces preferred used place soy sauce shoyu because fish fresh amazing alone IMO overpowering soy sauce only kills flavor fish!   I discovered Chef John's amazing edible art while browsing Instagram @chefjohn  should definitely check out! posted couple photos incredible sushi privilege order Chef John during few previous visits! During most recent visit September 2015 Chef John wasn't but other amazing sushi chefs created sashimi sampler plate me! posted too  Needless say presentation absolutely stunning well can't wait see create next time there!   *Also much props Bar Manager Allen always creates most unique amazing cocktails ever ANYWHERE posted photos much thanks excellent staff bartenders well! <EOR> This restaurant chain pretty good   Being girls weekend away home started off cocktail tree which $70 but totally worth it! Then ordered Otsumami which assortment edamame green bean tempura shishito which really good  aioli sauce hint truffles strong garlic taste but wasn't over powering made really good green bean tempura   After Rock Shrimp Tempura bibb lettuce tobanjan alioli black truffle vinaigrette opinion only average  entree Miso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass really really good  Very moist tender juicy fishy all  everything could wish your fish be  portion little small but oh good!! also Samba strip Roll which maine lobster mango tomato chive crispy rice soy paper peanut curry thought alright  But price much lobster gave really worth it   last thing Neo Tokyo roll yellowfin tuna tempura flake aji panca which also really good    My overall experience only 3 stars because said really busy night but didn't look way because least 5 empty tables front us sat corner waiter complete douche couldn't order right nor could he remember ordered came back several occasions reconfirm ordered  manager also dumb tried help only things worse because he asked wanted drink didn't even bring drinks completely forgot us    In end I'd come back cause food good but hopefully better service next time  <EOR> We came bachelorette group amaZing experience! food FANTASTIC drinks great server Isabella best!! She made such special fun night group! Best sushi and seabass skewers! Don't even started    moment had! <EOR> SS great mean GREAT happy hour  sit bar which requires going early getting lucky  Even weekday    I enjoyed great Mojito LOVED HH rolls can't even put into words unique tasty both corn shishito peppers are  purple potato mash good if passed heavy cream flavor tell yourself you're eating your veggies    Service ok despite grumpy bartender still gave quick efficient service    Can't wait back  Bill two= $110 but ate lot  lot mean LOT     Skip El topo roll  Cheese rice just wrong  <EOR> My party chose Sushi Samba because advertising but all cracked be    The food excellent!       But ambiance sucked   loud cramped difficult hear person sitting next me   service distasteful   waiter encourages let staff order giving them budget   weren't aware doing realized food didn't order coming table  Not taste far hospitality goes  <EOR> This fusion restaurant should be brilliant amalgamation best flavours Japanese Peruvian Brazilian cuisines cocktails wrapped into delightfully fun venue  I'd back Vegas Venetian another bite  sure!  I started off Chu Cumber cocktail Japan cocktails sec'n which made of shochu the OTHER Japanese distilled spirit aside sake  a pretty good alternative vodka if say myself Hendricks Gin elderflower liqueur freshly muddled cucumber  Refreshing light just tad sweet  Very good   We then tried bit everything    Peruvian corn love those giant kernels few small plates crispy yellowtail tacquitos  spicy aji panca sauce lime? yes please large plate a k a  entree  there's cool long bar area middle restaurant where perch yourself eat drink more casually    guys sitting next bar SushiSamba regulars highly recommended Chilean Sea Bass large plate selections  Because all echo suggestion  So  good  so  tasty  so  tender   I think great restaurant vibrant vibe delicious menu boot  already recommended once someone else ended going Vegas few weeks did loved too  Definitely bit pricey but expect when you're smack dab middle shops Palazzo? least quality matches price! <EOR> I agree reviews below did great job explaining menu more detail could   Gave place 4 stars originality food drinks atmosphere   dark bright artsy decor walls different pictures rotating projection screens NOT PG rated BTW saw breast two flash though nice scenic pics too  club lounge back restaurant which recommended Dior employee Caesars mall he said mix hip hop music some other music he Saturday   However weren't able since open Sundays   Me two other girlfriends mine late Sunday nite sat 10 pm? no wait   matters but added bonus waiter HOT!  hehe   Anyways menu lot things never heard before if you're used Brazilian Peruvian Japanese food then staff should able explain all before order   We ordered tuna ceviche shrimp ceviche appetizers see reviews below details dishes talk    Both excellent fresh decent sized portion cereal bowl full but pricey around $15 17 each   also ordered spicy tuna rolls which excellent the tuna practically melted mouths well BoBoBrazil roll which Mr  Hottie Waiter recommended slices Kobe Beef atop roll bunch good stuff didn't know sorry all food buffs!    think mix onions?  Both very good   As far cocktails would definitely recommend Chu Cucumber cocktail   think  name it   Again Mr  Hottie Waiter recommended which decided try even though didn't sound good first   surprisingly refreshing!  some sort Japanese liquor which supposedly lite Vodka flavor well Roseflower cucumber   ended having two they martini glass third having substituted original liquor Gin recommendation bartender which stronger alcohol taste it   friends tried Samba Juice cocktail which she said good tasted little sangria   Overall great atmosphere bit pricey but original food wouldn't find your regular sushi restaurant   would definitely try place least once trip Vegas!

Word advice chef owner Take trip Brazil learn pros done  <EOR> I came bachelor party keep mind drinking 9 am all day till dinner time and beyond    pretty blown away everything taste originality   sure why place doesn't higher rating but reading some lower reviews all seems service related which can't really judge accurately cause came middle service between meals hitting girls casino bar restaurant   But anyway back food various things blur memory but impression still remains   Tasting each dish each its elements thoroughly impressed everything   haven't impressed food while I'd definitely recommend place anyone asking Vegas suggestion  <EOR> SUSHISAMBA Japanese Brazilian Peruvian fusion restaurant located deep inside Grand Canal Shoppes inside Venetian Palazzo three additional locations Miami Beach New York City London   originally started New York City 1999 tell many restaurants offer such unique combination Asian South America fusion cuisine quite this   I came lunch without reservation restaurant pretty empty able seat sushi bar  reviewed menu most items pretty pricey  Special rolls range $10 $26 tonkotsu ramen $20 each small plate e g  taquito gyoza etc least $10 robata meats seafood vegetable antichuchos ranges $7 $19   ***  Sea Bass Antichucho miso Peruvian corn $17 bit much miso glaze tasted slightly salty but sea bass itself very good  Peruvian corn tasted pretty chewy pretty filling food  4 5 São Paulo scallop masago red onion tuna salmon shrimp whitefish avocado truffle hacho miso soy chimichurri $24 $24 sushi roll      enough money AYCE sushi! If ignore price then think better sushi rolls very long time  Fresh fish good flavors  4 5 5 ***  Great food quality but portions pretty small prices expensive  Without bring your friends family share food total cost control if decide dine alone  Just prepared leave slightly hungry unless going order more $40+ worth food  <EOR> Happy hour happy time   $6 selection appetizers drinks happy hour  Good deal!

Omakase option chefs choice where work your budget $ don't which great feature restaurant    I came back again last week remembering much enjoyed enjoyed food just much remember  However prices nearly good remember!  Last week came birthday 3 days belated but can't girl embrace birthday more just day? Made reservation 9pm Sunday night via OpenTable notes said birthday dinner  Upon arrival surprise still lot people when checked wih hostess she said needed wait extra 10 minutes fine! sat waiting area behind bar but sitting full view hostess area hear realize 5 minutes she began seating others didn't reservation same party size just 2 people came us! Rude right? asked asked again she smiled said yes table you  Then proceeded seat worst possible table  lot art designed modern way but above object literally couple inches head felt crouch down entire time    Now onto more important things FOOD! We going opt Omakase but realized would better just order few things actually wanted eat since knew specifics wanted    Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza $18 Rating 4 25 5 For 5 pieces tiny gyoza good but couldn't tell difference between regular beef A5 Wagyu bit disappointing  However still good would recommend order during happy hour!  Crispy Hokkaido Scallop $7 each 3 5 5 It's kinda lettuce wrap waiter recommended but just ok memorable  Uni Nigiri $9 each 4 75 5 So good! no fishy taste but wish bit more uni because seemed little skimped but really surprised good was    Japanese Wagyu Nigiri $12 each 3 5 5 It ok but definitely better  seared but actually kinda cold  texture wasn't melt in your mouth good  probably wouldn't again    Salmon Nigiri $5 each 4 25 5 It good texture good too! would order again    Sao Paulo Roll $24 each 3 5 5 roll lot items picked one  consists scallop masago red onion tuna salmon shrimp whitefish avocado truffle hacho miso soy chimichurri  version rainbow roll    Overall really place definitely back  sure reservations!
