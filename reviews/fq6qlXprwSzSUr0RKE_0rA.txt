The answer really bad    We picked poison Taco Maker  looked promising  veggie nachos veggie burrito  person making nachos barely put any cheese and first wanted cheese sauce thus disgustingly bland  veggie burrito looked promising but no taste especially course plentiful taste salt   0 2  left mall feeling disappointed unsatisfied course extremely gassy  really should rename Taco Maker Fart Maker  Steer clear  <EOR> This place seriously reminded taco bell  last thing want reminded another fast food experience  Uuuuggghhhh give benefit doubt might ordered beef burrito   But just can't see myself eating again knowing other places choose food court  paid wasn't worth quite honest probably would rather eat Taco Bell  <EOR> My 6 years old daughter loved $5 enchilada crispy taco plate   She said she wants back eat again next time return Vegas  <EOR>
