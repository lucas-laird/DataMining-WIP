MANAGER fucking ridiculous! Treasure Island needs find someone more suitable job! DONT EAT UNLESS WANT BAD SERVICE ask FREDRICK! Worse place! Don't go! Horrible!

Why pay much bowl pho when just downtown find cheaper bowl pho? But  just opinion  Open late good if you're drunk want something grub on  <EOR> I wasn't expecting much pho strip   knew would expensive bland tiny but didn't care   wasn't wanted but NEEDED it   big bowl different types meat   really wasn't bad   portions huge seemed nice   soup extra greasy side though but meats especially meat balls surprisingly good   best balls mouth    place sorta dirty utensils took 10 spoons find clean but would come again if other noodle places can't satisfy sista     Oh don't thai ice tea  <EOR> I love when saw this! But pho just wasn't craving time  ordered marinated half chicken fried rice fish sauce  very flavorful!!! Although should gotten white rice instead fried  wasn't thought be  more Mexican box rice  ? Husband burger great! Portion size great!! Enough full during sitting enough bring leftovers snacking while drinking hotel room late night!!! <EOR> We ate right before see Mystere Treasure Island  originally Bellagio buffet but 2 hour wait only hour eat show   We waited line while  looked multiple tables cleaned opened yet continued stand line  think enough servers night backed up  server's fault but definitely showed lack management  Saturday night lot people town multiple things restaurant should much more prepared   First waiter very nice  second very quiet seemed confused lot things  sure if he new but did see supervisor explaining lot things him  No big deal aren't picky but again city being busy restaurant should prepared it   Food pretty good  best Vegas but definitely good casual atmosphere casino  portions quite large drink specials very good   Good place quick bite eat especially before seeing show  prices very reasonable  <EOR> This place joke can't even answer phone correctly can't  even understand when tell your address  end 16 minutes   Just repeating address  switched phone 3 different people  together don't open restaurant  <EOR> First off service little slow here  seeing they're only around 2 servers whole place even though only taking order servers still seemed little confused if gotten orders taken already which already did  waited order looked around see some people eating looking around waitress  case figured place just under staffed    Now food self price ran $12 14 vegetable tofu pho which little pricey Pho but let issue pass since everything Vegas overpriced anyways  Now taste really threw off  First off didn't even smell pho  broth smelled more top ramen broth noodles thick slimy  Lucky starving point just ate anyways   Overall Would come back here?
