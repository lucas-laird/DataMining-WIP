You must try it!! =D <EOR> My boyfriend made comment when reviewing establishment always best check more once   very least twice   finally decided come back Bee Gee kitchen Yakitori Fusion Grill   last review gave them two stars   time gave four stars    This little quaint mom pop's type restaurant very cute inviting feeling simple decorations walls   service just fine attentiveness there   I ordered Chicken Heart Fish Ball Squid Ball Rice   biting food felt back home Philippines again   something street vendors would sell   Ratatouille when Anton Ego bit Ratatouille dish felt little 5 year old again markets mom biting fishball chilli sauce     It felt nostalgic only complaint time around didn't order Chicken Gizzard   first experience wasn't exciting but experience changed everything around   wouldn't mind going back another round  <EOR> Super cool dudes super promising eats  popped late night nibble  spot small casual only enough seating 20 30 people  menu small but if you're looking meat stick find need  majority menu dedicated yakitori although other items such udons meat veggie bowls  ordered veggie skewer sampler husband ordered scallop lamb salmon  meat selection wide everything chicken heart squid!   Our main concern little heavy handed seasonings  veggies salty scallop seasoning wasn't preference  scallops baby sized bit chewy which disappointing  wouldn't say serving size generous but then again neither price tag guess   Service kind  Young guys seemed concerned delivering good eats  definitely want back give tasty beverage selection sip  if you're adventurous meat eater would recommend stopping sample some more unique wares i e  chicken hearts! <EOR> Still fan but took curries however great addition Beef Yaki Udon become new favorite! <EOR> This restaurant awesome! They best employees   cashier very kind polite patient   My friends dinner yesterday order Chicken Heart Fishballs Chicken soft bone Shitake   and some drinks   all love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
