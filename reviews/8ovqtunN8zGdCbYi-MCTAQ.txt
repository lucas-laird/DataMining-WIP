Before location bit unsatisfactory when came bar scene because if person choose seated bar anybody walked behind would squeeze past literally brush against you  Weird right? Well all gone because high table tops allow more space now fit more people tables  also use couches which actually liked but whatever reason now removed those   Interesting      Our server probably coolest ever received!
