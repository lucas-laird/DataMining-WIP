I've living Sunrise neighborhood close ten years now  Until recently haven't lot food options besides fast food even then pickings slim all available mostly burger chains  Carl's Jr them  regular off throughout years  guess lucky ones considering all bad reviews    I've always received stellar service location whether dining using drive thru  food comes quick there's never any hiccups  even offered treat dog when pulled window once   I prefer Carl's over other burger chains area because company formula great burger down! Tastes came grill just way it  always repeat customer  <EOR> Our food fine but waited long few mixups all window  When inside told young guy behind counter he just given meals he didn't give receipt meals still incorrect  He kept telling just wait did  five minute later he walked over said oh yea well wait continued waiting  He looked over walked back over yelled don't know   When explained just left drive thru retold whole order when told person he almost forgotten give back debit card he more upset yelled again don't know could anyone without receipt   Well said he didn't give one  he walked away back drive thru window laughing staring walked accepting defeat  Well sister didn't give easily she back everything including card used explained missing items  He turned looked mean smirk laughed well but he pushed missing items into hand said here! walked away rudely  All happened within few minutes no clue why treated criminals trying scam when he just seen spoke moments before  understand mistakes all them however am swearing off RUDE businesses  never back never will  <EOR> Horrible customer services lady didn't even care all only did she cut off mid conversation but gave attitude no reason   also asked if order more she replied want rude way made want anything else  also order wrong tater tot's instead onion rings ordered   time 10 40am <EOR> They took 10 minutes just bring simple burger finally received bite into threw away  soggy sounded nasty when bit into it  Im done carls jr <EOR> Now when fast food chain restaurants pretty safe bet  location nothing different however person asleep floor restroom feet hanging stall luggage all over floor expect  Staff quick take care situation hand  But look he quite awhile  food delivered promptly expected  Just aware your surroundings around area town don't surprised treasures find  <EOR> This Carl's Jr  horrible! cashier didn't even acknowledge people line! know drive through bit busy but least she could said moment something! Instead she ignores 3 families line then when she ran said want? way would hope treated any place service  Food okay but felt didn't want people restaurant begin hated jobs <EOR> Food same usual dining room seemed clean young guy took order polite    But whatever DON'T USE RESTROOMS!!  smell horrible reminded way public bathrooms parks beaches smell  If didn't bad would've just walked right out! toilet bowl dirty sink DISGUSTING don't know supposed your hands clean it  manager? let because kind dirty doesn't just happen over night! <EOR> So just tried grilled chicken burrito but charged grilled steak burrito I didn't notice until home   tomatoes tasted spoiled! can't believe put there  really soggy wait until 10 30 could give 10  Very disappointed most likely again  <EOR> They items menu no longer available even though company website lists Nellis location Green Burrito can't order anything off Green Burrito menu 10pm????
