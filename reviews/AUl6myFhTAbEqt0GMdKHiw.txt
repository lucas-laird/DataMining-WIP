Dry cardboard healthy food gets bad name  <EOR> Honestly can't wrong  quality consistent across all chains reliable whatever may used to   I tip customers  made online order steak meat side  NEVER ORDER MEAT SIDE   I'm pregnant can't raw meat but love chipotle  didn't want pain figured I'd just order side cook well done home   I only TINY little plastic tub meat   I asked lady register meat side?? She almost looked ashamed said uhh yea   *there's photo reference   Needless say sure once eat undercooked meat again sure back  Just sorta sucked because pay much food you'd think they'd larger containers nearby  Plus know special request   Oh well   lesson learned  <EOR> I've location multiple times because near house always okay  Tonight completely left sour taste mouth wasn't mediocre burrito  When friend also works arrived staff looked extremely unhappy exhausted  friend tried small talk girl warms tortillas she exhausted mentioned busier normal when friend asked which understandable  girl working line seemed upset well  then noticed cashier Jalon whose name receipt which really convenient when employees don't wear name tags berating girl working line mistake she made being further pre closing checklist  friend said cut some slack interjected manager job never treated employees such disrespect  she immediately responded friend continued berate girl  Jalon rang incorrectly when corrected order she yelled girl working line said loudly and see trying defend her!   such uncomfortable situation noticed she continued rude abrasive   this pretty unacceptable place business contacting store directly inform them employees being treated    no wonder everyone working looked they'd rather hit bus working line such rude person  <EOR> If haven't Chipotle before seriously STOP reading now   The first thing must mention every time come location    music awesome  Whoever DJ Chipotle he\she amazing should parties   I used Chipotle  think because first few times really didn't know order felt intimidated just hurry stop holding line  But now pro!
