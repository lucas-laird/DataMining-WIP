Each time visit Vegas point atleast meal day here  quantity plentiful dishes well made spices well balanced  <EOR> Veggie Delight offers vegan menu options but all cost dollar extra vegetarian dishes  Why? all other Buddhist vegetarian restaurants visited most dishes already vegan virtue being prepared 'pure vegetarian' Buddhist style which eschews eggs dairy  seems mean frankly kind suspicious charging vegans extra every single dish just everything or majority menu vegan probably already charge everyone same damn price    The food did blow away while filling certainly nowhere near quantity expected special vegan price paid  would try again sometime but don't know if justify extra dollar something probably exact same dish higher price  <EOR> Awesome!  beef mushroom fried noodle B12 without beef  ordered spicy without oil great  <EOR> This first experience meatless meat must say very delicious   veggies crisp flavors vibrant  would highly recommend  offer both vegetarian vegan options  only problem combination rice dish little oily  totally going back! <EOR> The pork skin spring roll fish steak any sanwiches   just name few  Anytime Vegas visit little place  eaten more once day even  perhaps bit overload but want fix before leave  did bland soup once   okay though just mix something else give punch    A must when visit Vegas! <EOR> Easily best Asian vegetarian vegan spot Vegas  coming years now food never fails  dumplings would favorite dish simply because sauce accompanies tasty   Definitely must try! recommend coming during rush hour since Chinatown gets pretty claustrophobic especially particular area  <EOR> OMG place delicious!!

The service horrible   When walked woman behind counter immediately asked wanted   politely told would look menu briefly because first time there   actually bit confused because many meat options menu wasn't sure if dish actually served real meat if meat substitute   huge meat substitutes   find usually many additives sodium try opt something else   very curious however really wanted ask questions menu but woman concentrating balancing receipts never looked help me   literally stood counter waiting right front two minutes before she looked up   We ordered Lemon Grass Beef Tofu Mixed Vegetables   asked both entrees vegan which pay dollar extra for   life don't understand why pay dollar more Tofu Mixed Vegetables vegan   We also ordered Watermelon Lychee slushes  delicious slurped down way home   niece really liked Tofu vegetables   She thought tasted chicken     I'm actually very good creative cook but also love dining love see places offer  disappointed because really going Veggie Delight restaurant experience even though ordering out  anywhere else order people least smile ask if any questions menu! could made everything ordered myself     I'll back sure   but hopefully next time someone else working counter! <EOR> Yummy tummy!!! such awesome place!!!

Tiny place Chinatown neighborhood  Very inexpensive good service outstanding food  <EOR> We became vegan month ago started search vegan friendly restaurants Las Vegas  hit jackpot when found Veggie Delight  food amazing creative can't wait back try more dishes   The waitresses helpful great making suggestions One waitress could quite possibly nicest smile ever seen   The ambiance iis strip mall y flourescent lighting isn't ideal but over quickly very endearing soothing waterfall feature which covers wall    The chef hit night  He came every table handing non meat beef samples which unbelievably good  He also stopped again table see enjoying meal  wonderful conversation   Can't wait back! <EOR> I hardly write reviews certainly NEGATIVE ones very easy trash business negative well exception !  I used come very very frequently worked across street spend many Lunch breaks @ Veggie Delight ! owner then lovely petite Asian Lady sweetest person world she would most amazing Sandwiches favorite Spicy Chicken Sandwich bread superbly toasted paddies just right temperature herbs salad nicely arranged ! could tell dealing somebody loves she doing hard working person very proud she does well then ! Thursday back Chinatown moment melancholy brought back establishment oh boy regret setting foot ! must change ownership since last visit ! person behind counter rude ! When asked wet cloth order clean outside table chairs he started screaming since Chinese very bad could jest but really WTF ! am customer dude !!!! food even more disappointing then ordering ! spicy Chicken Sandwich f___ DISGRACE ! bread must gotten warmed MicroWave horrible ! felt eating lukewarm wet sponge VeggiePaddies still cold carrot salad looked tasted Throw !  Being Restaurant business hard call many Chefs Las Vegas friends ! know daily struggle challenges yet really doesn't matter but PRIDE don't all !  sad Veggie Delight become such ShitShow ! <EOR> It small 4 table joint  Family run only person speaks English   It clean bit uncomfortable eating here  did sick eating might adventure next time visit Vegas  The Thi ice tea sweet but mango slush bad used fresh mango but enough mango  Next time ask extra mango  For appitizers  1  Hand rolled spring roll pleasant mild flavor rice noodles some greens  sauce okey 2 Tofu strips just bock firm tofu cut into small cubes sprinkled some soy sauce would order again  For main dish had 1  Hawaiian fried rice well made right amount sauce vegetables  2  basil chicken soggy because sauce served with  sauce some funny goop something sauce did basil flavor just some basil leaves arranged side  much basil chicken   would avoid it  3 Vietnamese bean soup basically tasteless added some mushroom chicken its sauce  4  Mushroom Chicken  better basil chicken  Less goopy sauce  THe chicken dish texture taste almost  real chicken  THe rice served entree acceptable  <EOR> Vegan food pretty hard come Las Vegas or Dad calls Lost Wages   har har really want support those few options exist!  This place truly little hole in the wall bit challenging find  end long strip mall passes Chinatown Las Vegas which seems all different nationalities Asian restaurants businesses clumped together area    It's pretty lacking decor department fluorescent lights all did hear monotonous monks chanting soundtrack another Yelper mentioned  The ladies work very friendly helpful however food really other issues   I chicken mixed vegetables brown rice side  super fresh really delicious  brown rice probably best ever had  My husband peppered beef veggies which waaay heavy black pepper   you pretty much sneezed just looking but very tasty nonetheless  We shared chicken loaf appetizer bad name which good but sure if I'd again   We took home some leftovers even better next day weird way leftovers have   I think all flavors time meld together great result!  They huge menu next time Vegas sure back    So sum if place LA where live would all time  Get your food go! <EOR> If you're looking quick tasty vegan spot quick bite stop here   Veggie Delight probably smallest places but food delicious  very hole wall only 8 tables if time recommend calling ahead taking your order go  Other never disappointed food  Chinatown lot offer best!  My order always starts off Boba Fresh Coconut drink vegan spring rolls order soup bahn mi  favorite soups tomato lemongrass beef  usually big fan fake vegan meat since am rather picky when comes texture but Veggie Delight does right! favorite bahn mi vegan avocado  bread good fresh piece french bread topped pickled vegetables cilantro jalapeno tofu  also add extra sriracha mine but  just because love super spicy food  Yum!  This restaurant friendly kids  However   If plan bringing kids Remember kind place honestly depends your kids willing eat  example brought nephews many times 4 6 love it! They've also exposed eating healthier vegan friendly even exotic foods Thai Papaya Salad Sushi keep mind if you're bringing kid you  If your kid turns nose veggies extemely picky eater probably wont place much  If all else fails buy kid healthy but disguised dessert fruit slush call day   <EOR> Oh vegan food gods!  place well   Delightful!!  came bad experience Pura Vida see other review well Pura Vida could learn thing two Veggie Delight   place damn good actually came two days row   First day ordered some vegan Pork sweet sour vegan shrimp spring roll crunchy cucumber salad   Yum yum yum   vegan shrimp little bland but everything still good   think all food table 10 minutes!  next day ordered vegan beef spring roll vegan lemon grass beef sandwich vegan pork skin avocado sandwich crunchy spring rolls taro boba tea   Everything AMAZING!  favorites two days lemongrass beef sandwich sweet sour pork dish   There something magical cute place    Esthetically actually kindof hole wall but both times came all customers happy talking each other met locals everyone friendly little happy community   women work own place cute too   all smiles happy well just loved it     In way glad isn't Oakland because honestly believe would eating ALL TIME!!  Love Love love!! <EOR> My wife wanting try Veggie Delight ever since replaced Chicken Quick!    some reason waited more 5 months when did regret coming any sooner!  I grew Taiwan while am vegetarian enjoyed vegetarian dishes lot   Most people think vegetarian = salad but most Asian countries   One things missed most imitation meat products   know sounds questionable best but just really various soy based products sometimes mixed flour produce meat like texture   Take Vietnamese Vegetarian Lemon Grass Beef Rice Noodle example if weren't told there's no meat dish probably would notice beef eating actually made soy marinated lemon grass sauce   cold noodles dish definitely freshen hot desert weather   My wife liked Vegetarian Beef Noodle Soup Chinese style noodle soup both familiar she liked lot   soy based soup base tasted surprisingly flavorful complex without any meat it   Eating especially fun someone already familiar regular Asian cuisines see kind twists put each dish turn into completely vegetarian vegan dish if want vegan need tell them advance when order    such dish Vegetarian Basil Leaf Chicken commonly known Three Cup Chicken most Chinese restaurant menus   version dish other replacing chicken meat soy product which tastes just delicious opinion put bed spring mix   bold move surprisingly tasty   effectively turned into warm salad dish!  This very small restaurant capacity 10 people most time   Don't let Veggie portion scare away food definitely good eats   if into healthy too! But only care taste <EOR> The food does trick but nothing special   My crispy chicken wasn't expected basic chicken nuggets served next bed watery white lettuce sauce side  did taste pretty good but great   The pork skin hand rolls tasty hot sauce them but tasteless without  thought pork skins would more flavor   We'll probably start going Red Velvet instead  <EOR> we're talking hole wall here  if weren't specifically quest some irrefutably tasty goodness you'd miss it  but thanks dog with a bone attitude toward food mister ended lunch before heading home vegas last week    all happy eating sounds missing earlier gastronomical excursions over weekend? well let's just say came vengeance here  good thing long past being shy eat front mister full devour mode food fully warranted it    the mister ordered strawberry mango slushie veggie egg roll tofu spicy veggies whilst selected spicy cucumber appetizer vegan version tofu spicy veggies  soon plate lovely light green cucumber chunks came swimming gorgeously red intensely irresistibly hot sauce both knew treat  everything exceptional even brought more delectable sauce    all all huge delight and huge relief mister 20 minutes earlier almost lured faux chinese fast food lying ready made vats caesar's      thank woman behind counter ronald's donuts recommended veggie delight!   i cannot emphasize enough tasty everything was! if lived vegas would place  <EOR> We really enjoyed vegan meal  found new favorite place eat  O love meat replacements seasoning    recommend combination fried rice    Smoothies also very tasty  <EOR> We frequent quick veggie delights   My favorite dish Singapore Mai Fun    Their combo fried rice oily side but flavor amazing   The potstickers served catsup sauce bottom plate   A fav mine fresh crispy pork skin hand rolls  crispy think could trick someone really skin  first time tried freaked because tasted pork 10+ years seemed taste very similar!   Soooo many yummy choices great pick crispy chicken avocado Ban Mi sandwich  hard find veggie town  Sometimes breads egg only pile pile veggies inside    I Thai Tea because sweet always use nondairy    Their boba always looks good but sure if vegan because might use gelatin  always forget ask but never choose boba option anyway  prob tapioca    Great service  love owners always remember very kind <EOR> Closed nearly hour earlier posted business hours!

Many vegan options very tasty!! <EOR> The boba always good never remember damn name whatever food but portions always good especially soup which never finish   <EOR> Delicious Vegan Veggie options while dining several friends always pleasant experience despite small awkward location     The pork skin rolls must along Vegan almond boba slush   something more substantial spicy tofu vegetables request brown rice hearty compliments dish nicely     The service friendly except tight napkins drives crazy!   Another fun fact play same soothing chant repeat daily once dined without song playing!  decor hilarious yet charming   take before work but pork skin rolls best eaten fresh more crunch! <EOR> Came try something different Vegas  quaint little restaurant tucked Chinatown community    Food really awesome for being vegetarian vegan   would definitely come back   I Curry [non]Beef plate   Loved flavors  recommend light meal   The curry [non] beef soup also must try  big bowl way   Try hand spring rolls too  <EOR> Worst service ever!! am outside place right now called them 15 minutes ago check if open before getting uber ride here  person confirmed pay 9 $ uber closed  8 15 PM ridiculous  Wish could select less 1 star  <EOR> Portions quite big  Great off strip location close hotel Rio  Only 6 tables but excellent food!

Very fresh whole peanuts warm tofu really made difference    Over all defiantly great vegan meal  <EOR> Vegetarian vegan food hole wall outskirts Chinatown specifically same building Golden Tiki but side facing Wynn Yu Yu  hell time finding place missed more once   The menu fairly simple apps soups Chinese dishes bahn mi style sandwiches well boba all vegetarian vegan boba beverages made soy milk  Prices low service friendly only real downside cash only policy which always forget or else I'd more frequently    The crispy chicken avocado sandwich pretty solid heads heaped tons shredded carrot which overwhelm other flavors times  bread also freshest openly kept refrigerator front counter  But flavors inside sandwich? work way obviously betrays fake nature meat    Another fave Vietnamese handrolls pork skin version gets lot praise other reviews but stick beef which surprisingly believable texture even if roll itself bit heavy noodles lighter herbs veggies I'd like   Service quick  Park street  don't forget your cash  <EOR> I super excited try place result alas 2 stars  should say though am willing again give another try  possible item ordered Beef Curry simply weaknesses however looking over some other reviews seems problems food same problems others wrote so    basically problem food bland  mean supposed Indian Beef Curry wasn't even hint hot spiciness mention sauce wasn't particularly curryesque either    Judging stacks magazines reading material shelf door should noted primary clientele restaurant probably asian buddhist vegetarians  Just note response some other reviews primarily criticize service  need judging service proper context  place vacationers feet kissed while being served  <EOR> Being vegan livin Las Vegas very hard find good places eat out! Veggie delight far best my favorites! vegan vegetarian options everything menu! <EOR> I normally don't complain all veg vegan places  However food greasy EVERY TIME! fresh fruit slush amazing well tea  refuse order food only drinks   <EOR> I love vegetarian vegan restaurants  certainly aren't enough them Vegas  When heard Veggie Delight sounded just Vegetarian Wok LA couldn't more excited visit  very disappointed give restaurant just two stars but bad service easily rubs hospitality student wrong way   The food great  delicious attractive portion sizes good  However service totally sucks  door propped open spent lunch bundled coat it 50 degrees outside  and in  didn't wait very long order but did take while food arrive  ordered drinks entrees same time  person's entree drink drink arrived 15 minutes  Five minutes later third person's drink water! entree arrived  Five minutes entree arrived  don't know why didn't bring drinks first entrees together but fun person awkwardly eating oneself watching one's food cold avoid offending other people table still waiting   The paper takeout menu says sandwiches come chips but when asked told only during certain hours  noted anywhere menu believe refused spare fifty cent bag chips customer happy  entree supposed come fresh vegetable noted both paper in restaurant menus but did either  guess  only during certain hours too?  Overall food good but enough overcome lack service  <EOR> Don't let place fool you   this only place Vegan Vegetarian Chinese food love it! good!

Yeah nothing fancy lot seating order decide your best friends leave other suckers home   Their Cash Only sign LIES!!! end little meal friend freaked cause none cash day but took debit card sign LIES!!!  Food interesting Bamboo Duck soup tasted almost close real bamboo duck soup cept lacked body boiling duck bones rehydrated bamboo shoots    Kind ironic direct translation Vietnamese going vegetarian 'eating bland' where going back meat 'eating salty' bamboo duck coup exactly bland  personal taste everything must heavily seasoned bit high blood pressure inducing side soup five shades bland side  Now when say bland dont mean lacks flavor bit flavor bamboo but lacked salty savory punch only some fish sauce  Oh dont use fish sauce dont expect none     The bamboo shoots soup obviously canned little  mock duck meat taste duck but didnt last long texture okay also way little it  preserved pickled mustard but again little more tease then garnish addition dish  Personally wouldnt order again most likely wouldnt order any soups again   Why? Well Viet know dishes suppose taste point where try recreate something 75% accuracy if try home  Two most Viet broths need animal bones flavor body aroma soups kinds ingredients place obviously cant use  Three vegetarian nor am trying vegetarian just curious see skillful place mimicking tofu mushrooms resemble meat  Lastly Five backbone most Vietnamese dishes FISH SAUCE we'll power scooters feed babies if could  place doesnt use any could give alternative regardless close something taste meat always going lacking fish sauce   The tofu nuggets complete different  pretty much sliced tofu served sauce  suppose mimic fish sauce caramalization reduction  look color but wasnt thick flavor but good regardless  tofu also quite interesting  Between two commercially known types tofu talkin bout silken firm type never tried before firm yet tender little play it  close meat kind of  Sort vietnamese fish paste  fried oh gods miss fish paste isnt pre cooked formed into shape tube    Anyway If general area come back give something else try but very likely going way eat here  There's plenty alternatives omnivores there  <EOR> I am newly converted Vegan excited explore Las Vegas Vegan options    my non vegan yet husband tried Crispy Chicken sandwich Beef Steak entree along Thai tea w soy milk    WOW! disappointed thought staff very kind food delicious!  great first vegan restaurant taste experience   so glad good    we drove 35 minutes totally again!! <EOR> Excellent vegan food   Crispy Chicken sandwich delish! <EOR> I read through reviews see negative comments fall into few categories don't speak English don't take cash personally hate life want damn them boba tea wasn't perfect charge vegan tax should damned heck inconsistent experience   That said found Veggie Delight Delightful experience  vegan understand sometimes costs more use vegan products don't find unfair small business hard time taking credit cards passes consumer  people didn't read sign cards thankfully bank two seconds across street where could withdraw funds  Although language troubles did weird thing where pointed item menu brought me    It appears small mom pop type joint! little kid family some type playing game  probably very bored sit instead having fun  place small but clean  don't recall bathroom  service quick    I ordered Vietnamese beef wraps which faux beef spring rolls dumplings Vietnamese beef style noodle soup two faux sandwiches go  Spicy Beef which eating right now Chicken Avocado   Everything tasty enough  ask Sriracha Hoisin Sauce soup which none traditional accompaniments    Could better customer service? Absolutely some opportunities  food flavorful faux meats good texture  food came quickly responsive when needed  fair priced scare commodity takes good  laughed people California thought food overpriced  apparently comparing food McDonalds which doesn't any sense    I hope next time service consistent but isn't those experiences where life end if doesn't  Thanks being Veggie House <EOR> Meh food even worse service      Their sauces loaded tons sugar salt waitress insults if ask if dish no sugar monsanto soy    I recommend returning  <EOR> Although am vegetarian stopped lunch anyways  veggie places ate point ok best but veggie delight seems outshine them all    They serve standard Asian noodle rice dishes well sandwiches rolls  tried spring roll avocado crispy chicken sandwich  roll faux beef sandwich faux chicken course  While able detect actually meat pretty tasty anyways  sandwich rolls actually above average Asian places to   Another point spent twelve myself which bad compared other veggie places  cash only come prepared  <EOR> I came Easter Sunday dined alone  don't wifi network but password 'Flamingo Pizza' Flamingo Pizza's phone number able guess enjoy internet while ate   I asked hostess if any entrees she recommends she gave firm answers  third recommendation and seemed coming order leaning towards own sweet spicy tofu that  liked she really answered me   Often when myself take food go  But felt non awkward eat alone chose take seat  eat said   The food came perfect temperature right cusp where don't need manage burnt tongue  maintained its temperature ate  When cook Asian food myself way more binary hot cold only small window ideal range  real treat enjoy wider window   The dish completely delicious wanted eat 10 times    The drinking water perfect temperate  somewhere between room temp ice cold  don't water really cold don't need challenge me  inclined think strong attention detail here   For $11 84 tax before tip isn't bargain amount food   Their menu gives 'vegetarian' 'vegan' option each item which handy  don't ask everything cumbersome time ordering  But seems unfriendly vegan choice slightly higher price  your operating cost actually higher vegan version? Most food inherently vegan anyways once vegetarian  any conventional restaurant would leave egg whatever tweak without charging it  ah ha moment feel betrayed restaurant brands themselves vegetarian would ones charging veganize dish when everyone else would free    The value menu trick only blemish enough cost them star  eating experience itself near perfect  I'd see them offer vegan vegetarian versions same price then revisit this  <EOR> My boy friend salt lake city far favorite place Vegas eat! found few years ago every time stop in! just want say thanks amazing vegan vegetarian options delicious food!

In city many incredible vegan options elsewhere! <EOR> Closed Tuesdays decided come back another time    Most everything ordered vegan which plus all vegans! There's vegetarian options possible cross contamination could happen    It small quiet setting which nice Friday  menu isn't appealing look since no photos entice you  food takes decent amount time you    I ordered tofu bites which assumed going fried tofu  Instead baked tofu dressed sesame soy ginger sauce  actually pretty good  only thing question dish some tofu pieces cold some hot     My entree curry TVP brown rice  veggies fresh cooked perfectly well potato came it  love Asian curry heaven    The service little none waitress brought bill before requested Thai tea  $19 nice size entree app Thai tea w boba bad    Their credit debit card machine doesn't print option tip  don't carry cash felt bad leaving anything because wanted them being nice  But leave employees looked table assume see if left tip  She saw didn't gave lousy wave good bye    Overall enjoyed it  I'd come often when area  <EOR> This closest thing mom pop vegan restaurant find town  Always real nice u see family everything  Everything vegan haven't found single dish don't like!

I agree someone else Vegas strip worst Vegans Vegetarians  Sheesh! lot places didn't even veggie burger option  place great alternative  bit hole wall but hey vegan beggars can't choosers! <EOR> Veggie Delight just many food joints what's known Chinatown complex   Buddhist owners menu consists Asian vegetarian cuisine entrees quick snacks Vietnamese sandwiches pearl tea drinks   Most items made vegan usually extra cost     The language barrier made difficult any recommendations inquire menu items   Vegans even tougher time confirming isn't vegan   couple dining same time leave hospital because girl some sort food allergy reaction staff continually apologizing convinced may due communication problem    Only few tables set dine small establishment   chicken steak dish which brother promptly put order seeing good smelled looked   Fortunately taste just good   But dish came different presentation due extra vegetables   jealous   szechuan dumplings good well listed under noodles but turned more appetizer    Overall decent place veggies but lil inconsistent side language barrier being biggest hindrance  <EOR> As far food concerned looked tasted unhealthy  pepper steak chicken diced vegetables steamed dumplings  Everything fried except dumplings fake meats soft tasted cinammony  Very strange flavor  couldn't eat it  Waste money  I should known better**  The service good     I wont come back again  <EOR> If vegan you've pretty much removed any decent pho your life  Well places bring back  best vegan pho ever but certainly always noteworthy find place even does vegetarian all!  I Vietnamese beef noodle soup vegan omnivore cousin Taiwanese beef noodle soup vegetarian   surprised learn he LOVED vegetarian beef much he'd wished he'd gotten vegetarian beef hand roll instead pork skin hand roll  shrimp hand roll LOVE sauce give it  slightly spicy much better hoisin like sauce other places seem give when order something similar   The prices pretty decent top vegan boba! place easy miss when you're driving but worth finding  <EOR> Cute little vegan vegetarian restaurant tucked away Chinatown   nobody when showed didn't really understand why because prices good food excellent   didn't chance try slushes but next time hear they're excellent   beef steak dish delicious wife loved curry     With good vegan spots being fairly limited Vegas nice know places Veggie Delight really stand out  <EOR> Thank Veggie Delight giving non meat eaters another solid option Vegas! initially bit skeptical based picture filled menu sorry folks multiple bad resto experiences abroad taught stay away pic filled menus small cramped dining area 10 picnic tables tops but decided give place try based heavy endorsements veggie vegan friends town   Man am glad went!   Food comes quickly made disappointed if you're expecting traditional sit down   ordered spicy chicken sandwich fantastic basil chicken also delish pork skin summer roll while certainly good pork skin ratio rest innards lacking  would recommend more pork skin balance out ginger tea both cold hot  FANTASTIC!     Now know you're thinking fake chicken pork?? Does actually taste good?? answer resounding YES if made folks Veggie Delight  The best part all food above worked $10 pp!   If haven't experienced wonderful world faux meat yourself favor try Veggie Delight   won't disappointed! <EOR> 4 stars hole wall vegan restaurant  lot options Las Vegas vegan plant based community  recently convinced friend switch plant based diet  just came check place out  ordered dumplings beef mushroom lo mein noddle dish beef pho mushroom sandwich  quotations because no mushroom sand which  sandwhich all celery cabbage  would recommend dish  sign door says once food cooked served no refund  did mention wanted mushroom sandwhich believe waitress pay sandwhich  dumplings did enough stuffing did taste previously frozen  liked pho noodle dish  Next time would order beef because tastes soy  would order everything all veggie    BTW Cash only !! service isn't great but would least favorite vegan restaurant tried  <EOR> Judging Kelly K's review wonder if even ordered same sandwich  would quite pleased if gotten ANY lettuce  Instead two tiny patties faux tough chicken strip thin zucchini small sprinkling shredded carrots few springs cilantro  Seriously? VEGGIE chicken sandwich  Don't cheap!  We arrived around 2pm Saturday  packed inside tables customers waiting side wall orders  Everyone before no gotten food yet  Then became apparent why    owner taking orders register hysterical mess! could feel tension wanted cancel order  listened new customers came order    she frantic she kept running back forth kitchen fussing staff  Every time she would part order written down she would back reiterate order come back register ask customer repeat wanted  hell point taking down order begin with?! high school drop could handled task much less stress ciaos  hot hell inside  would ordered veggie pho but door open heat kitchen decided against it  Also half eaten plates food left next ENTIRE time seated still when left  When tables next FINALLY sandwiches asked where appetizer you know    thing comes BEFORE entree was  only side excursion see Teller of Penn Teller   Being vegan REALLY wanted place  Great concept severely poor execution  Never again  <EOR> Quiet little cafe type place maybe 6 tables?

I yesterday afternoon eat anything vegetarian while 2 2 day vacation Vegas Vegas worst places vegetarian vegan   I searched searched something nearby strip where staying fairly close You catch bus 203 Spring mountain  road it'll drop off Wynn Its located plaza buch other Chinese store You're China town located across street  Bank America   I bowl Chicken Pho Chocolate Boba Spicy Chicken Bhan Mi sandwich   The boba came first ill say ok but ive better quality boba L A It kind slushy  most chocolatly tasting You'll try understand mean!

The 3rd thing come Pho I specifically asked Chicken Pho opposed Beef Pho menu I dont taste fake beef broth The lady brought over decent not big size Chicken Pho fake beef broth it   sure but didnt taste vegetable chicken broth!  The chicken looked sickening Although knew vegetarian restaurant chicken looked real true It looked real chicken fat    I really didnt real chicken fat before became vegetarian didnt either I think messed Pho beef broth taste it   mention lady only gave small little plate brussel sprouts no onions  jalapenos regular sides normally Pho   Everything ok but best   always say Its vegetarian small Chinese Vietnamese NOT SURE restaurant Vegas  near strip  If come back Vegas again soon ill sure try some more menu items sure     This'll help someone two might experiencing same problems 2 days Although hate living  L A im glad live area great vegetarian options everyday people myself  many others me  <EOR> This place vegan banh mi! popular crispy chicken sandwich order  If you're into soy avocado sandwich very tasty  If crispy chicken avocado baby would best combo! Ask see if mix two  order both mix yourself did  I getting Thai iced tea  soy milk options!  I hope open more places LA    The ladies work speak English well sure repeat your order if possible  Although time misheard turned good mistake  ended trying something delicious would never ordered  <EOR> I've coming place 3yrs now  Food always very good nice size portions money spend because expensive considering usually spend around $50 $60 girl only entree each noodles rice order spring rolls  time visited same normal usually don't care but Customer Service sucks woman taking your order doesn't even speak just stares until contact would order now  times dine seems family just hanging back talking just watching eat which weird  why stopped dining in  anyway time order when home really disappointed see  barely any vegetables vegan meat meals rice noodles ordered barely even filled to go plates half way  called tell them barely gotten any food just spent $50 it  Then woman spoke if she didn't speak any English couldn't understand saying  She didn't any problems understanding giving order taking money when there  Needless say won't going back other Vegan places eat Vegas just kinda close Quality food good but now just spend less money somewhere else instead  <EOR> Amazing vegan good!! beef mushroom fried noodles best!! Fast great service! <EOR> The vegan meats pretty good  The fresh summer rolls A OK much noodles barely any veggies  $5 two rolls but pictures show three rolls  False advertising haha! The sauce clear vinegary sauce instead amazing peanut sauce most places give summer rolls   Cash only! The parking free big shared lot which nice  <EOR> I love place much! can't decide favorite thing order is  inexpensive order all! Spring rolls cold lemongrass noodles bahn mi <EOR> I gave Veggie Delight try tonight  restaurant tucked into side only assume Asian town district Spring Mountain Road Las Vegas given architecture other restaurants vicinity   To start ordered couple appetizers Chinese broccoli oyster sauce sweet sour soup  soup piping hot broccoli if ever you're looking shack cold dreary day Vegas  yeah know happens much right?  then place come   I must Chinese broccoli before because expecting something more along lines broccoli raab  Nonetheless good very fresh  would liked cooked little more tender but probably prepared traditional way   The sweet sour soup wasn't expecting but really quite nice flavor reminiscent sweet sour sauce yet less intense   For entree Vietnamese lemon grass beef noodles vegan style  Wow very well balanced dish subtle lemon grass aromatic basil  Unlike some Vietnamese noodle dishes moist just joy eat   Overall food out of the ordinary but really quite good  only complaint would its confused menu  Despite being vegetarian focused restaurant also offering vegan options nearly every dish many them jarringly meat centric names  almost wonder if actually vegetarian you're kind meat product mistakenly masqueraded vegetarian  mean beef pork skin that  bit much almost seems desperate apologist's approach vegetarian cooking  Plus really difference between imitation beef sandwich imitation beef steak sandwich? Also despite many dishes offered both vegetarian vegan variants most cases hard imagine practical difference between two  sum Veggie Delight odd menu would benefit greatly simplification but oh well definitely place worth trying  <EOR> I've actually frequenting place years when used train BJJ next door Sergio Penha's    would come over hugr group done training Boba drinks always without milk them    It therefore  weird come check place vegetarian vegan fare   ALthough turns veggie shrimp rolls love just that   VEGGIE!!!  So decided check place full lunch hear food buddy Ross   He's vegetarian but very open came try out    I course ordered strawberry Boba drink started meal fave veggie shrimp rolls   Ross impressed them knew he would be    I ordered veggie mushroom chicken he ordered veggie pork chop each sides rice  spite almost ruining lunch dumping glass water across table jumped into dishes tasting each arrived table   Of two mushroom chicken favorite  yummy  brown sauce poured over rice  liked fact pork chop last vegetables surrounding but lesser favorite two    Being am already fan place all more reason now sample more dishes    looking forward trying veggie lemon grass beef next time!!  if you're looking fancy upscale place lunch isn't it  but if want some good food hole wall feel you've found it!! <EOR> one best veggie restaurant ever been  came L A  where there's insane amount Chinese restaurant some vegetarian Chinese restaurant  among best!

Alternatively park street!   It's small intimate restaurant  five tables two two tables four probably accommodate around 18 20 people without much problem although think you'd take over whole restaurant why not!?  I wasn't sure expect far food but option making any Vegan well which ALWAYS awesome plus! any FOB Asian places you'll couple misspellings menu but easily understandable problem all! Just thought I'd throw there  many different choices noodles rice sandwiches etc it'll satisfy anything might want eat!

Leaves u wanting more because theyre smaller side  fruit smoothies delish too  Only thing took lil long order eventho no else but great food takes time guess lol <EOR> At first little scared place   wasn't because location decor whole wall atmosphere   because recently decide cut back eating meats didn't know hell doing    When first walked few earthy hippie type folks  No offense any earthy hippies there  Which something used to   thought ourselves really gonna this?  Yes yes did happy made decision   I've only twice now   both times ordered same thing tofu vegetable mix spicy sauce   place misrepresented spicy  dish F N hot!  But oh very very tasty   hooked   tofu wasn't your usual boring bland tofu but rather tofu minced vegetables it   vegetables sat mainly shredded cabbage I love cabbage green beans broccoli corn maybe some others   My hubby tried few other dishes   But course can't remember were   He liked them   I'll admit first visit service good   owner took care us   second visit slow somewhat unfriendly but none less still enjoyed food   bad pricey   $9 tofu vegetable plate?  Really?    Anyhoo place yummy pricey small very small bit awkward for us    But give shot see yourself   definitely venture back spicy tofu dish Thai Tea  <EOR> Ordered Hawaii style fried rice black pepper beef crunch fried spring roll Thai iced tea coffee iced tea   Service friendly food arrived shortly   Liked place because don't eat red meat could actually order ANYTHING menu  Very liberating!!
