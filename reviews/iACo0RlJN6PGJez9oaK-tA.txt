Great burger fries beer  come afternoon show some love good time <EOR> I actually really love food Timbers  usually Postmates restaurant everything always comes perfect  LOVE sandwiches wraps burgers  generous sizes delicious  once order takeout staff wasn't very attentive atmosphere isn't really vibe  However we'll definitely keep ordering food them when feel good burger  fast food  <EOR> First time Vegas trip  tried place first time  let down beginning thanks bartender Amanda  asked if hot sauce nachos she rudely says already given salsa  also asked fork minute later she laughed me  started getting concerned visit why bartender Amanda acting poor customer service skills  later asked if 3 different types alcohols which did not  Instead Amanda saying No  Sorry she replied We're only Timbers which gave impression she herself considers work under par   Another patron accidentally called different name then apologized when she corrected real name  She still snapped back stated would if called Peter? Finally found scotch asked it  She poured into shot glass Isaid Oh sorry rocks? she yelled telling sooner One dirty shot glass shouldn't big deal    finally bill  received 2 drinks bill which did order  Amanda refused take them off said she already helped enough she isn't breaking rules  didn't know other pay leave tip  horrible first Vegas experience  reccommend place anyone  girl needs fired however sure won't happen   The nachos decent    but customer satisfaction everything  <EOR> We arrived 2 55 am very long night   just wanted some breakfast   ordered water iced tea drink because 3am just wanted some food   server visibly irritated weren't ordering alcohol apparently assumed wouldn't tip   Bad guess since gf both work industry   always tip menu prices happy hours   She brought menus did return take order 15 20 minutes   ordered didn't food another half hour   Fifteen minutes earlier waitress told food almost done  When food arrived cold   food done when told almost done   place nearly empty no incompetent   She purposefully sandbagged order over hour punish drinking 3am  We didn't until 4 15 <EOR> So must preface am gambler party days behind but am happy report place isn't any less enjoyable if aren't coming gamble drink lots    Centennial lacks bars late night food options majorly but luckily Timbers comes rescue because Distill sucks!   Service good  Happy hour great  2 50 drinks food super cheap too  Each month summer months another menu item half off during happy hour July burgers!   Christin server when always come she honestly half reason keep coming back    She great attitude she's fast efficient she doesn't treat badly because don't drink when come  all food!   The rest staff seems friendly but no where near great Christin  definitely keep coming back long she's serving! <EOR> Slow service start  Once Christin took over table she great  GF shared Philly cheesesteak mozzarella sticks  2 drafts  mozzarella sticks really good but came cheesesteak  cheesesteak mediocre  fairly dry  Value wasn't bad especially coupon  try again see goes  <EOR> I usually despise chain bars Timbers PT's Pub   place really smoky!  This few places Vegas darts   so gets extra star just that     We stopped watch Oregon Duck game because called ahead said PAC 12 network   When said actually don't gave couple shots brighten mood!  manager bartender girls great  <EOR> First time great service  The second time couldn't find game tv  waitress forgot half order asked extra cranberry juice vodka she charged 2 bucks top drink charge   time left person table still didn't food ordered 2 hours later  I wont back  <EOR> Food great  waitress Lucia awesome though  If looking good food elsewhere  <EOR> Haven't visited Timbers awhile    fantastic night!

Beware! Also scream bartender 5 times before she stopped talking friend come check out    The setup great though  Seems friendly atmosphere  Wouldn't spend money again  <EOR> My roommate heated  over much bar just sucked ass phone opened Yelp account first time long time write review    My roommate both stopped bite eat  arrived around 2 45am sat bar  bartender Richard busy pouring beers group assuming birthday going cause kept hearing OMG happy birthday! Countless times over group he didn't greet 5 10 mins until he POS machine looked saying right guys   Meanwhile roommate decided ahead play some blackjack  He's pretty big gambler knew gonna lot    2 mins later he walked asked would drink roommate just wanted water classic burger $4 50 Monster energy probably $3 50 4 beef Philly $9 50  Food arrived 15 20 mins later Philly extremely dry even mayo asked could help it  fries good roommate said burger good  done eating food roommate gambling whole time already put $250+ machine needless say he also getting upset because machine just busting  bartender came gave bill surprise philly roommates $4 50 burger    My roommate heated  all years going bars never bartender give ticket $5 item gambled hundreds dollars  Most places don't charge cent because amount he gambles whenever gamble well  You just don't insulting guest especially when he lost ass off    My roommate then asked bartender if didn't comp food bartender then took ticket back changed real quick just philly it  okay paying because didn't gamble all but ONLY reason why tipped because he took monster off   Maybe because didn't order alcohol he assumed wouldn't know any better just thought thought only drinks could comped when gamble   Well BAD move part because he didn't know both roommate seasoned gambling bartenders years experience if he would just comped whole bill he would easy $20 tip headed way instead $3 gave him  Even better would came back    But now because horrible service won't coming back  take money elsewhere  Better use some Comps explain manager then explain guest lose guest  Especially gamblers!   The only reason why would consider coming back giving place 2 stars instead 1 star does deserve because night because happened stop other morning other roommate some breakfast beer morning bartender Jamie awesome! Fun talk comped beer food made sure happy entire time  If come back when she works  <EOR> Stopped mid morning Monday buzzed in  am all being security minded but little baffled buzzer during regular business hours broad daylight  breakfast continue quest ultimate chicken fried steak  CFS good accompanying pancake  However hash browns little undercooked served less lukewarm   service slower would expected only ones joint time  Overall just average experience but back long fan Timbers first visit location  <EOR> I frequenting bar over 10 years  Let say again ten whole years  am bias give praise acknowledgement when due  But over past ten years every time gone into establishment always taken care very well  food great service great too  read many reviews Yelp today sad because apparently some people think if bartender all over 24 7 giving everything want  bad service  don't every day many VIPS but still treat great  don't even gamble much great service  also put $10 machine expect 5 drinks free  They've always completely fair honest appreciate that  watched customers expect bartender give them everything world because don't think  bad service  just business $10 does bunch drinks free  also watch customers expect free food drink playing $20 but sitting 4 hours playing quarter every 10 minutes drinking buns off  Good grief people always expecting something nothing  then don't even tip  Timbers always great place hang nice time  still enjoy going 10 years  continue when opportunity because Jason Heather Robert all other servers great  doing something right keep going back all years am trainer customer service 20 years  Keep guys!!!!!!!! <EOR> Reading over other reviews noticing trend     terrible customer service  Wish could say review different buuuut nope  several times would say service mediocre best but time awful  actually currently sitting wondering if server ever come back  She sure looks she's having great time tonight chattin other employees but considering ONLY TABLE maybe she could stop once twice every hour check us  Guess don't want spend more money  Oh also pretty good empty beer glasses sitting front least 20 minutes brought them bar waited new ones  Genius bartender help something?
