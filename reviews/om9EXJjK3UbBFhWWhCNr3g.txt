Strip all   Tip #1 medium sized roast duck pieces perfectly cleaver chopped  However might difficult manage if you're used chopsticks  It'll helpful ask extra plate fork knife start   My choice Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodles time  tried before? Vegetarian Buddha's Delight Ma Po Tofu Beef Chow Fun Chicken Fried Rice  liked them all especially fried rice   The noodle dish looked smelled good but tad disappointed came table already cool touch  Regardless delicious  love noodles crisp yet soft parts covered sauce  Chicken breast pieces tender perfectly flavored  baby bok choy? Richly verdant  Fresh crunchy way cook home  also priced little high but happy meal cares?  Tip #2 Noodle Bar cuts its baby bok choy usual Chinese way  cut lengthwise into 2 or more pieces  If using chopsticks proves unwieldy ask extra plate fork knife   Overall 5 Star dining experience us  Attentive service adequate portions tasty food clean dining area  much impress us  remarkable Noodle Bar managed consistently good fast paced food hall setting  if you're into sports just look screens front you  No sound but plenty action   We'll back!
