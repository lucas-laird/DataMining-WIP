No thank you  definitely returning ever again  <EOR> Wow seems should've read reviews first! All food food court pretty unappealing gave shot  3 meats much all tasted same  Ended throwing most container   Best thing bottle water  <EOR> As others stated food court Excalibur potential especially when simply looking grab something fast   Unfortunately opinion really only decent lunch option pretty bad   I'd arrived Excalibur around 1 p m  simply wanted grab quick bite some things planning meet friends larger meal later night   came orange chicken fried rice soft drink    EVERYTHING pans display looked dried if cooked hours earlier sitting under warming lamps baking pans ever since  fried rice OK but portion orange chicken pretty tiny while most pieces fine 2 inch round ball breading undercooked piece chicken center   Needless say left plate     For small portion dried orange chicken fried rice Styrofoam container small soft drink paid more $10   Horrible  <EOR> We love Pick Stix back Orange County  Nothing mean nothing same   Food drowning grease cold   We felt sick hours!! <EOR> If could give negative stars would    three side plate 8 99 serving small all food beyond greasy salty  never knew green beans could horribly drenched oil salt!!! please please yourself favor come here    girls working most sour attitudes looked sounded hating life existence     better fast food options within walking tram taxi distance <EOR> Terrible! love chinese food Pick Stix don't love you  chowmein good fried rice good but chicken terrible  chow mein orange chicken bourbon chicken  Orange chicken bad couldn't even finish because bad  However bourbon chicken if decided try yourself actually probably only good option because delicious  boyfriend chow mein fried rice beef broccoli orange chicken  beef broccoli more leftover soysauce actual beef when he did find some beef tiny  hell?   The food good never come back restaurant  did enjoy potstickers but expensive those hurry come back those    Also weird service girl serving food doesn't give enough 1st 2nd options ex chickens chowmein rice   She hardly gave boyfriend anything girl serving drinks overfilled everyone's drink maybe should switch jobs    Pick Stix if reading suggestion better food keep your chow mein recipe keep your bourbon chicken fried rice but change orange chicken recipe killed offer different potstickers  Also sure your servers serving enough food those options because don't want just eating soysauce when we're supposed eat broccoli beef   recommend Schlotsky's even McDonald's over restaurant Excalibur food court  <EOR> This gave bubble gut hours runs could stop barfing  very very icky <EOR> Can someone re staff employees? young guy named Jetski gave husband worst costumer service ever gotten NY  Food decent but 2 meals 2 drinks came $38  asked 3 combo meal Jetski standing talking cool name when tell take firecracker chicken he said your talking me? said yes ordering food want chicken  Then he says don't think he's funny  HE'S right!
