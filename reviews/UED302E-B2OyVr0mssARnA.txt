Something less greasy? Tastier? talk full tummy course forgotten good hot crispy food anywhere made other people sounded hour before   I give particular Panda Express A OK rating though  interior always spotless  Two staff always friendly helpful  quick suggest cheapest way set your order they're patient slow orderers time wontons suggested wait few minutes something fresher already tray     Also close closing time  sounds obvious but if 30 minutes before closing food  Try some other fast food places area especially unnamed few doors down you'll told clean time  hours restaurant's door especially fast food place customer cleaning crew    something  particularly important when may only because all good places closed  <EOR> Poor customer service   better service east vegas  Food cold   lady rolled eyes 10 times cause said wanted fresh food hot  Sucks cause nice area such poor service   brother id gm panda Laughlin store #1 reason <EOR> Always good fresh! work OfficeMax area people fast friendly   <EOR> It's Panda Express!
