We visit numerous times finally decided write review   Atmosphere small family restaurant low key relaxed   family 3 usually 3 combo meal 2 orders spare ribs 1 order beef brisket 2 sides baked beans potato salad   Never fails spare ribs always soft easily fall off bone   meat tender flavorful perfect me   husband son love sauce usually add more barbecue hot sauce themselves  beef brisket always tender never chewy where can't down  usually fills if bigger appetite might order more beef brisket barbecue chicken   Sometimes special sides dirty rice which family love  usually visit Sundays some barbecue Ricky always help take care us  <EOR> Awesome food service  beef ribs great  Highly recommend place if your mood great barbecue over top service  <EOR> The food ok  son ordered child sliders  He suppose 2 only gave saying combined meat big one  thing small looked slider baby! wife ordered coffee which almost $3 00  When she half way done waiter asked if she would refill  thinking good service     When bill he charged 2 coffees  When asked told policy charge refills!! Ya right! didn't pay it  never again  Stay away unless want overcharged  <EOR> Tried place takeout once deemed half bad  Dined restaurant tonight take The restaurant atmosphere simple clean very relaxed  Almost order at the counter then seat yourself kind place  indeed table service albeit friendliest but also bad  BF decided share full rack baby backs plus two sides beans potato salad  Everything came speedy time maybe 3 other tables people warm but let tell place concerns themselves presentation  Everything served single use paper plastic containers sides even lids them! big deal but almost made wonder did ourselves into?   Aesthetics aside everything good  thought potato salad nice consistency balanced very complimentary BBQ  beans basic enjoyable  ribs came barely wet but extra sauce offered immediately  Once sauced liking dug very pleased  Great taste extremely meaty very tender  only complaint little bits bone gristle picked but  sort expected place this  cornbread came meal left much desired which kind surprising rib place  Overall price paid well fed rib craving satisfied  even took half rack home  Would definitely return recommend place friends    TIP used Yelp $10 $20 only ended paying $6 plus tip   tons specials listed 2 1 Tuesday lunches place even more bargain  <EOR> We found place when Groupon offered $14 credit $7   BBQ place pretty close home   Well service slow slow slow order wrong first few attempts two young servers apparently communicating each other when finally all overpriced food ordered mediocre bad   The final insult when 16 year old girl running place ripped off   She refused accept full amount $14 Groupon claiming because ordered daily specials she could only give $10 credit instead full $14 face amount   Apparently she well trained young age steal form customers because when objected tried explain she violating Groupon policy honoring full amount Groupon she claimed  she did all Groupon customers    guess first speak up   I asked talk owner but girl said she could reach him   took back $4 tip going leave broke even but left bad taste mouths both literally figuratively!  Our suggestion EVEN THINK EATING AWFUL PLACE!!!  Head Famous Dave's BBQ instead  cheaper much better food service atmosphere! <EOR> Went other night when walked family only two people there   Didn't think much service at beginning seemed top but once she placed food down never saw again! Everyones drink empty call different waitress bill     Let's talk food  pull pork sandwich sweet potato fries say good 8 99   husband brisket horrible! tasted lunch meat just smothered sour BBQ sauce    recommendation smoke your brisket 12 99 portion small  not worth it daughter two beef ribs didn't even enough meat spicy 6 yr old eat! tasted couldn't eat it  Why would put kids menu specify BBQ sauce spicy?!   We obviously couldn't tell concern waitress because never saw again! place ridiculous wouldn't recommend all!! <EOR> Second visit here    beef ribs both times     Tender good barbque sauce but enough when done eating waitress said she shoulda coulda brought extra sauce     First time really enjoyed myself   Second time felt gyped whole rack ribs hardly any meat them    waitress tried warn me   She said sometimes supplier brought ribs without much meat those days but figured little meat 8 ribs?  answer 4 ribs worth meat 8 ribs half each bone no meat all     what's plastic forks knives?  waitresses very nice helpful but didn't small portions  <EOR> Went last night theyve really gone down hill spent over 70 bucks 3 dinners worth all! 2 meat plate all spare ribs burnt old tasting asked extra side mac cheese didnt it    use really good place never complaint but really really gone down hill wont going anymore whats really sad took first timer lot hype place only disappointed but embarrassed to    <EOR> Awesome service great food affordable prices  Made feel comfortable welcome  can't wait back!!

Best deal give perfect amount food  sweet potato fries best! also love $1 desserts lunch  only reason why gave 4 stars because few times lunches took awhile table  Besides would given 5 stars  <EOR> 1 year ago moved Summerlin since then driven past TC's Rib Crib seen check list Yelp other sites   first thought someone's house but then saw real shop hopes rose love BBQ hole wall places usually best      Well finally family gave try   First   menu promising am kicking myself trying Catfish Fry Day special  Instead three meat combo daughter tried two rib kids meal    baked beans cornbread  excellent potato salad bad   barbecue sauce lot flavor spice   However way much sauce food even BBQ lovers   spare ribs tough chewy instead tender   pulled pork might well bowl sauce meat's only flavor came mass sauce   brisket unique almost greek gyro cut very thin bendable ribbon but also chewy overcooked   atmosphere nice but staff mostly seemed overworked resulting long time between drink refills   YELP coupon definitely made value buy $4 99 lunch specials kids prices bargain value conscious but if looking perfect BBQ disappointed   appears mixed reviews place may hit miss depending chef busy but won't main rotation   however give another shot day just see if caught bad day  <EOR> While staying area business pleasure visiting TC's twice within five days   Hey when you're mood BBQ search places out!  TC's didn't disappoint   pulled pork quite flavorful brisket   don't ok ahead started side dishes   green beans fried okra dirty rice   all three outstanding done perfection   The staff ultra friendly appreciative enjoyed conversation when there   The only thing keeping 5 star rating ribs   While weren't bad just weren't good other meats   If would consider removing underside membrane baby backs yes time consuming allow smoke permeate better bone side also smoke flavor would more obvious throughout little more pink would come through   But  only suggestion   Otherwise EVERYTHING else outstanding when return Vegas head right TC's again! <EOR> Great ribs cornbread  only come when coupons available groupon  Love food!!! <EOR> The food good but overpriced get  service good either  sat dirty table  When waitress came take order asked if she could clean table  She looked confused told she taught mess  showed last party's check still she still looked dazed  sure wrong waitress  Maybe supposed part theme  <EOR> This new fav place BBQ!!
