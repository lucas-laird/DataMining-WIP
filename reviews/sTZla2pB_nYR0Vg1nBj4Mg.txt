<EOR> I'm sure why place 5 star reviews  guess they're friends family owner desperate attempt stay business   Anyway food disappointing  bland  When Persian place expect flavors intense   or least present  food huge let down  liberally applying salt pepper food still no taste  let down  boyfriend's beef kabob also bland  could better home  food ordered some sort rice layered chicken dish looked made day before just reheated then served me    The interior also strange  Looks outdated mismatched  only two other parties besides us  Guess huge room tons tables set just gather dust  atmosphere bit weird uncomfortable    The only reason gave two star review instead because waitress very nice  <EOR> We just dinner food great chicken kabab ghormehsabzi   <EOR> Actually Thanksgiving dinner amazing! food seasoned just right powerful service IMPECCABLE!! meal owner came introduced himself made sure happy experience there  definitely stopping again! <EOR> The food really bad  made Arabic people cooking Persian food  very tasteless rice horrible don't come here <EOR> I high hopes place but unfortunately quite met  Interior fairly plain looks banquet hall but Persian territory map nice touch bakery next door  But felt food overpriced underwhelming   Beef Koobideh $10 good portion two skewers rice salad plentiful portion bread  Flavors good but rice bit soggy side salads fine  Overall think going Shish Kabob House block down better value  Other kabob dishes reach $17 20 which absurd considering offered SKH comparable quality   Gheimeh Bademjan $14 really thought traditional stews would best dishes here  described being tomato base yellow lentils beef roasted Japanese eggplants  However received mostly peas small piece beef no evidence eggplant  see being comforting peasant dish but didn't much flavor  Very disappointed   Service polite once acknowledged  two employees only ever approached I'd standing hostess stand good five minutes  Noticed another Persian customer enter receive immediate service warm welcome  <EOR> My fiancee stopped fly coming California  course every new restaurant there's always hesitation quality taste won't meet exceed your expectation but let tell ordered Koobideh Mast Moosir fantastic! quality taste beyond good  live music background baskets fresh bread house bakery kept coming!

The atmosphere restaurant weird  huge mismatching decor Saturday night basically empty only other table   no artist stage singing  fact server didn't turn music until few minutes sat down  quiet     Our table missing forks  server seemed surprised when asked some if asking extra flatware chicken teriyaki  don't know  Did step into culture doesn't use forks?  feeling reaction stirred me!  We ordered some yogurt onion appetizer shirazi salad beef chicken koobideh  koobideh came complimentary salad which could done without  don't find iceberg lettuce some cucumbers some tomatoes appealing  dressing sour   Everything else decent  portions quite large took everything home afterwards  <EOR>
