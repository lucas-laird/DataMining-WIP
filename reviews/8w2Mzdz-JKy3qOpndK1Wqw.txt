Updated review 4 stars 5  Today greeted Victoria Eric  ordered 6 tuna sandwich white bread  both apologized running white bread really busy earlier  did tell just made some but hot serve  opted wheat bread instead   no biggie  Victoria then advised just ran tuna offered fresh batch if didnt mind waiting  Again no biggie she nice enough offer fresh tuna vs forcing choose another option   Thank Victoria! Much appreciated     I thankful because really wanted tuna! While waiting Eric nice enough tell breakfast menu delivery using GrubHub  Victoria whipped sandwhich Eric suggested try honeymustard sandwich boy oh boy! even more yummy! Thank Victoria Eric going above beyond! Subway lucky both <EOR> I feel bad employees insanely understaffed rushing around trying sandwiches also run cash register  very friendly attentive but extremely stressed   Unfortunately when ate sandwich horrible! think bread main problem just kinda fell apart super crumbly  <EOR> WORST SANDWICH EVER EATEN!!!  Okay really picky eater but know order  When arrived only customer employee named Christopher baking breads  he cleaned little he came asked wanted  noticed he wearing same pair gloves he using when baking  asked usual Italian bmt wheat provolone cheese  He only put 2 3 meat usual sandwich  Before he put cheese he stopped bake breads he working prior arrival  Twisting knobs opening doors cabinets SAME GLOVES then continued sandwich  asked toasted came burnt I didn't notice till home   When came veggies same thing sandwich then twisting knobs open doors open cabinets back sandwich SAME GLOVES!! condiments honey mustard mayo  it  He hard time finding condiments because mayo honey mustard container he guess where honey mustard guessing color  When checking paid cash  Counting change handing receipt SAME DAMN GLOVES!! HE NEVER ONCE CHANGED GLOVES NOR EVEN WASHED HANDS PRIOR ORDER!!  Got home opened wrappings sandwich upside down no big deal kinda but still upsetting bread burnt where teeth hurting first half mess!! unwrapping salad!! I felt unsatisfied  If wasn't hungry would've just left gone another subway  Wouldn't recommend place even enemies  I'm picky eater  But still want good sandwich  Smh first last time coming here  <EOR> Well Subway  came because laundry next door Filipino Buffet further down stripmall wasn't looking hot either   I Cold Cut Combo good Subway sub gets  Bread soft meat pre packaged mustard wasn't watery    What more ask for? <EOR> This location does carry spinach brown mustard  Lol seemed odd when he told since never subway carried different add items all other subways  <EOR> This place could lot cleaner  vegetables  looked old very unappealing  Guacamole dark sitting all day  No public restrooms   tables dirty but staff did clean them while there  come back location  <EOR> It's hit miss location depending working  Today win! Excellent fast service including very tasty sandwich  <EOR> They say 24 hrs but just walked 1057 most definitely closed     Ghj  Bh <EOR> I am ONLY giving star because all always broccoli cheddar soup clean  However today ordered Ice Tea Lemonade brewed behind register  drinking realized old sitting  brought attention employee Shawntae she apologized offered new drink said she would check manager interjected said Oh yea its old Why would admit why MANAGER would KNOWINGLY let OLD TEA SIT OUT?! CALLING CORPORATE <EOR> Not first choice locations being don't need veritable mosh pit people yelling kids looking lost general inside vagrants hounding outside    Nestled odd plaza containing coin launders along eclectuc mix oddities such shoes under $5 furniture store housing knows what  IKEA eat your heart out! Though location clean contains standard Subway fare won't catching hanging killing time mp3 player surfing Yelp tablet  <EOR> Stopped tonight long hard day    no produce options    onion dry stale no olives avocados     peppers submerged goo breads where limited white wheat    basically if want scrape bottom trash bin outside your odds would improve variety freshness  Luckily own spinach avocado home Eat fresh TRASH subway way pay nothing  Never again  <EOR> This subway never soups main thing for  wouldn't recommend anyone  <EOR>
