Great food service ambiance!  won't regret it <EOR> We previously dined several times Chef Richard Solano's Mingo always enjoyed meals but gotten around eating Bomb Tacos until recent trip   surprised tiny restaurant much way seating   few people occupying tables while waiting takeout orders prepared   ordered quartet street tacos 2 carne asada 1 each chicken pastor   tiny kitchen backed very long wait further exacerbating shortage available tables   Another table occupied employee friend having lunch   did sample pickled carrots which fine but no better those found elsewhere salsas pretty ordinary well   receiving order could distinguish taco another except al pastor which topped pineapple because all meat diced fried into oblivion  <EOR> Moved California 3 months ago looking taco place frequent  checked place loved it! boyfriend super picky actually seconds! He agreed place would new taco place   two chicken two carne asada try ended ordering more devoured first order  Check place out! recommend it  Also Mexican Coca Cola glass bottles bonus points!!! D <EOR> This more 3 5 star rating but few cons really kind weighed big rating   I've heard lot hype behind Bomb Tacos  office DTLV just opened second location people raving  Since location house figured should check out   The service great  people very kind very patient because definitely trying order whole menu   There two items really stood fish tacos shrimp diablos! those two items alone phenomenal would definitely back those! fish tacos probably best fish tacos LV  fish battered perfectly literally did require any salsa  Same shrimp tacos  spicy but also very good   Now    really wanted love potato taco but really impressed it  much flavor just looking fulfill craving  also felt fried beef taco  Serious lack flavor pretty pricey  also carne asada pastor tacos both meh  Also impressed meat seemed little old little dry  guess bad day little overpriced  totally don't mind paying premium if going BOMB but just didn't experience that   Lastly ordered al pastor fries  Geez when looking them hyped!
