Upon sitting down looking menu taped notice over mimosa portion menu saying don't permit sell mimosas  don't know long open if once them but lose all integrity if don't item named for    The reason place could two stars because food decent  tried biscuits gravy  weren't favorite because spicy southwest taste them rather your traditional home style biscuits gravy  did but could see other people liking that  also tried eggs benedict country potatoes  eggs benedict unremarkable  country potatoes biscuits gravy little spicy more southwestern made bell peppers onions  opposed but should described menu better style expected  also did care much coffee  say pancakes amazing! Even though huge didn't much cake feel perfect crisp outside perfect consistency inside  Maybe food would tasted better mimosa? never know     The reason place doesn't anymore stars because ambiance wasn't amazing  decor sunflower yellow colored walls mediocre paintings flowers  service good servers nice but nothing stands out   There no line during weekend prime time breakfast hours  smaller sized restaurant but tables accommodate larger parties    But guys NO MIMOSAS! <EOR> There wait seated around 11am Sunday  menu selection very accommodating vegetarian diet   I've Benedict's they least 5 different ones delish    Fair warning portions HUGE example picture below half  Enjoy <EOR> Came first time Mother's Day really quick  place small but prompt service  enjoyed food only issue potatoes tasted heated over over again  coming again try giant mimosa  <EOR> Awesome huevos rancheros chunky potatoes! crave food but hard time finding restaurant decent dishes near Spring Valley West side matter  But really liked dish   I also Nutella waffle banana strawberries did disappoint  waffle really soft toppings point didn't even need syrup   The coffee also pretty good strong bold but exactly liquid crack  <EOR> It okay  probably won't back fairly pricey breakfast just okay  Service fine but great  <EOR> Tried place whim popped FB feed  chicken apple sausage pneapple mimosa  husband tried western scramble  portions huge service impeccable place did disappoint  <EOR> So delicious! chorizo skillet amazing salsa  Ordered eggs over medium  came  only downside southerner bread came isn't would call biscuit  Very doughy more really thick dinner roll  I'd still eat again though  <EOR> Well worth drive strip  Nice twist traditional dishes  mimosas something else Lychee favorite  Fun helpful servers  <EOR> I little apprehensive trying place first but once tried food must say great place breakfast lunch  BBLT quality food fantastic well great service  sure back  <EOR> We love find support mom pop restaurants   place great  seats need help did them second hand? but servings it   maybe  it   someone ate full meal    then sat back down!
