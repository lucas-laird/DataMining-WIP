Portions very large   Even sides huge   bone ham easily 6oz   three strips extremely thick cut crispy broiled bacon 4oz   Around $20 per person real bargain quality quantity  <EOR> I stopped since looked quiet comfortable even though prices bit high   thought would good choice since located near THEhotel    don't mind paying money good food but would agree another review comparing Cafe Dennys   sandwich actually processed turkey real turkey breast   prices expecting more    actually starving when left  <EOR> During last visit THEhotel opted stop last brunch   finally found place no wait quick service   bad last day!      The bacon tomato Brie cheese sandwich awesome   tomato soup bit sour side but still well sandwich   pancakes fluffy warm syrup added nice touch     I kinda fries   surprised TRUFFLE FRIES   rate some best had   Thin crunchy outside perfectly flavored plentiful    I would come back just them  <EOR> My party 5 impressed place  service main problem felt stuck corner little no attention  Sunday morning btw  When food came flag waitress down because still didn't any napkins silverware  over medium eggs basically hard boiled  Corned beef good  Toast GREAT but when friend asked jelly took another 15 mins  charge coffee which wasn't used to    every other place gave complimentary  All all bad experience going back  shame because big fan THEhotel  <EOR> For price we restaurant com certificate felt good deal but otherwise don't think I'd back   eggs w the hash hash carrots which found very odd    worst part weren't fully cooked very al dente which didn't well beef potatoes hash  Also asked no bread yet brought bread  Service okay  friend seemed enjoy breakfast  simple eggs w bacon toast perhaps need just stick simple dishes next time    if next time    The location ideal if staying Hotel just next lobby  <EOR> Beautiful morning last day Vegas woke feeling having another great breakfast before going back home  Walk restaurant smile faces positive attitude anticipation enjoying breakfast Cafe    1 hour later leaving disappointment    Why? Well couple things     a   understand mistakes happen dirty silverware land someone's table    but please don't attitude towards your customer  least say am sorry run fork kitchen table behind me    basic customer service!  b  When customer asks question coffee instead asking isn't ordered? just curious see if anything wrong it!   c  When customer orders steak thinks cut full meat just fat! 75% steak served breakfast left plate  practically no meat it   d  Crab Egg Benedict? Hmmm see egg but crab??? Ok ok flake crab count     So many things hour    and  only question leaving why last day through such bad experience     Ulyana <EOR> Fantastic breakfast divine potatoes hash browns luv smoked ham steak 2egg breakfast also custard pancakes amazzing!

And American Express booked hotel stay breakfast two free each day   Love that! <EOR> This probably more 3 5 star review mainly because prices offensively expensive   $4 glass iced tea yikes   Luckily restaurant com certificate $25 $50 brunch cost $25     Regardless sure if food warrants such high prices   burger $18 wasn't extraordinary but came truffle fries serve every sandwich   husband baked apple pancake huge plate sized apple fritter he overwhelmed by   thought good when tasted but don't really eat sugary things I love meat potatoes more    He thought didn't enough apples baked dough   I'm sure if again suppose if staying Hotel might but if don't restaurant com certificate  <EOR> I thank boyfriend finding place restaurant com  boyfriend bento box 20 dollars each  bill came 50 dollars which included 18% gratuity  restaurant com's $25 discount bill came 25 bucks!   The food great  tempura light flaky  salad delicious  chicken tender moist  salmon buttery  <EOR> All menu choices seemed incredible hard time deciding brunch  torn between blue crab benedict pancakes  decided tried true chicken waffles because both sweet salty element meals  chicken cooked perfectly  Even though just chicken breast still moist juicy  crust crunchy oily all  waffles  crispy outside fluffy inside exactly waffles should be  thought dish very well done  only thing bring maple syrup already poured over which would preferred myself but no big deal  boyfriend's steak eggs also very good  Steak dry aged cooked exactly he liked it  <EOR> Love there! staff nice  came bday friends The mimosas best  brioche French toast eggs shrimp grits egg white omelet  awesome! flavoring just right    The hostess willing take photo  don't usually everywhere! definitely come back  3 $71  <EOR> I signed just sure place understood bad experience was  party 8 came highly recommended yelp  sitting took over 10 minutes server come recommend food take order  50 minutes later food came out  Everyone's food completely cold  blue crab Benedict horrible  girlfriend ordered lobster panini fruit  She panini literally ha cheese harden being outside long instead fruit served fries  Rather having server address issue food taking long he avoided table  water wasn't refilled until check came complained service  No plans come again hotel matter  <EOR> This place amazing french fries  perfice size shape perfectly crispy!
