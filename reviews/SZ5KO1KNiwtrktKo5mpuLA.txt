Came place twice!   bad     restaurant looks kinda modern newish  many people come here    But should give shot  <EOR> This hands down single worst dining experience years   problems ran making reservations I transferred 3 times even though called # website service awful food  We restaurant week request menu wasn't offered   Once placed dinner order cocktail arrived promptly but took over 30 minutes first course!  only two did appear busy    I chicken corn chowder only took few bites   chicken broth thickened cornstarch weird viscous texture then no flavor   needed seasoned only bit corn looked maybe egg drop    My second course fish filet mignon mushrooms fried rice   fish very strange  looked though pan fried no real batter just perhaps light dusting flour such but fish itself coating absolutely greasy all tasted oil   strange because sea bass oily fish   fact am even sure cooked oily   found bone first bite  The mushrooms quite rubbery sauce tasted brown water fried rice greasy flavorless   filet mignon very tender but strange canned beef sort way    Neither ate hardly any course   fact quite bit food left plates   When server came he asked if weren't hungry   said no didn't it   He mumbled something walked away  Our dessert mango pudding mochi   mixture hard underripe mango very delicious mochi it looked brand buy Trader Joe's ha!   After each course would push plates way staff would walk look but keep walking   ask check  I would normally higher standards fine dining restaurants charge more food but even compared neighborhood Chinese take out far worse   am really just dumbfounded truly awful food through through  <EOR> Outdated decor    slow unfriendly service    paid $130 2 people no cocktails Chinese food equivalent average Chinese buffet  Save yourself money frustration eat Beijing No  9 <EOR> This place 100% awful  Bad service substandard food     lot pay lame Chinese if you're getting comped  come here  <EOR> My wife visited first time  service excellent  never refill own hot tea nor did any plate sit finished table   The decor aquarium inside add comfortable atmosphere    I ordered wok fried scallops loved it  XO sauce yummy   We back more no question  <EOR> I really liked won ton soup lemon chicken   place beautiful felt bit under dressed but hey 10 hour class training excuse hehe   waiters very nice  <EOR> Step 1 Gamble Step 2 Casino Comp Step 3 Empress Court Step 4 = Very delicious  Pricey  But want terms Chinese    400$ Fish fresh sea?
