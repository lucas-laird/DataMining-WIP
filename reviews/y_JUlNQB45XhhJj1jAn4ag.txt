Meat counter bakery looked barren  Maybe lucky turn place into another glaziers soon? Might come back few months see if still open because even parking lot empty  <EOR> High prices poor selection uninviting general  <EOR> I found myself store because looking specific product website said could found there   did  50 less Whole Foods but saying much   Having walked around little think prices extremely high selection certain items very good   never find pushing cart reason   But if money no object store you!  never frequented when Von's nothing compare far layout   employees encountered while browsing friendly cashiers but store ghost town every time more cashier open but really doesn't need be   don't imagine store survive long   3 stars friendliness employees having specialty item  <EOR> I stopped way home see like   Now won't back   very large supermarket should Wegmans     I looking three items check new store used Vons   found very over priced selection groceries   three items came for   deli section anemic best     As walked around saw 2 litre soda sale marked down $1 79 $1 97   dollar store same thing   Why Earth would take such sale?  Finally took more time check shoudl given very few customers store only register open   I see lease sign building now   Come west #Wegmans come west! <EOR> If best Haggen local neighborhood food market then big trouble   Came today see all grand opening hype extremely underwhelmed say least   I around store twice find Almond Breeze almond milk no such luck  noticed don't alternative health aisle those people eat gluten free dairy free items   I also noticed some organic vegetables moldy  Yikes!   Some prices speciality brand items Lara bar granola cereal way over priced sports drinks Zero Vitamin water priced $3 50 more would pay Target   I seriously recommend coming store even more unappealing cashiers don't seem happy working here  <EOR> Haggen reorganized produce section opinion flows much better seems greater selection produce now too   mention larger organic section choose well   spacing aisles much better     As far selection products quite bit still trying accustomed to   early tell if fan brand's stuff stick favorite product brands   selection meats seafood seems same if little bit more     The area seems bit bare time bakery section   definitely lot more roomy section but seems could use extra self standing self two common space   far selection breads stuff good amount but thing missing some pita bread   lady said look into old Vons used seems odd all different hummus yogurt dips etc  no fresh pita bread   As far staff seems lot same friendly Vons staff before   Checking still pretty smooth plenty open stands   staff mentioned few more upgrades coming months given seen far it'll exciting see else add bring regional chain into town! <EOR> My husband insisted going opening day around 10 p m  they opened 4 none opening day fanfare would expect  tough even locate employee  both underwhelmed nonplussed? Yes thanks Haggen    There lot empty space store  liked much better when Von's  Food MORE expensive Von's Albertson's which outrageous! Two bags groceries $90 00! protested then decided let deranged husband purchase could rub when he starving exceeding grocery budget  felt violated outrageous prices  colonoscopy hurt less    We shant darken door establishment ever again  Kiss cash goodbye suckas! going back Trader Joe's Sprouts if desperate something wee hours Fresh Easy  <EOR> This location used Vons Safeway which didn't mind least   When ventured last week first time since switch over everywhere seemed same Vons which chalked recent transition   seemed just slapped green shirts employees called good   review again if ever morph into something different more special Vons  <EOR> Worst rebrand recent memory increased prices worsened efficiency every department frozen food pharmacy   sure if increased organic section somehow meant compete Whole Foods but seems unlikely place still pushing fast food Chinese going lure granola crowd across street while other changes likely send others over Smith's Albertsons better prices less hassle  <EOR> I joined Yelp just could post review   If could give less 1 star would   opinion Haggen big miss   Unless pinch pharmaceutical item won't back   Today spent lunch $1 59 baked chicken leg $1 99 baked chicken breast $3 40 cucumber onion salad  seriously???  previous visit employee sitting aisle going through expired snacks opening bags sharing them co worker   Surreal   Whole Foods come lunch  permanently    <EOR> So unhappy changed Haggen   you need hand back Vons!!!!!
