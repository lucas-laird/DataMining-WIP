Ribs solid tender juicy flavorful tough   Brisket needs its mind if gonna lean fatty   Would prefer latter   Slaw odd vinaigrette  base opposed most creamy slaws see   2 meat combo plenty nice around $12   Quite full it     Best luck Ern Crew rest joints Container Park  <EOR> OMG good brisket beans  very good  Cant wait back  Big portions small prices  Love Love tip combo sandwich  meat different  <EOR> A lot potential lost details     Came last Saturday night line door  Took 30 mins place order which fine because Container Park just cool place people watch    We ordered pulled pork sandwich order BBQ potato salad mac cheese pork beans  Unfortunately time sat down BBQ cold  found dry bland  honestly think if eaten right away would've better  Hopefully chance revise review   Potato salad good made olives chunky  Mac cheese really odd  believe made real cheese oily instead creamy  Just different style suppose but didn't really care it    The pork beans world!
