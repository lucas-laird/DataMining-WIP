Este Mcdonald's no merece ni una estrella   Porque es el más sucio y puerco  de todo nevada  Siempre te dan la orden equivocada  Si llegas primero  Despachan al que llegó después de ti  Los empleados te quieren tratar como si fueras una basura  Hoy pedí un strawberry ice cream  Y lo dieron todo chorreado tirando sé por los lados y le dije ala manager  Que no estaba bien y se lo di para que dieran otro  De repente miro que la manager con unas toallitas le estaba sacando todo lo chorreado y ni siquiera se abia lavado las manos  Pues levante y le dije que eso no estaba bien que diera otro nuevo o mejor mi dinero  La mujer hizo una mala cara y dio otro  Y esto se mira seguido  <EOR> Slowest McDonalds ever need work customer service well waited nearly 10 min order placed lady  did know l run front register <EOR> The slowest service ever  !! 2 meal took 15 mins  !!
