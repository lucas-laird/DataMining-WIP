Ok don't fountain fanta fruit punch which strawberry accent Hawaii    but everything else  delicious   The service local flavor  the friendly kind  wanted try two things typically ordered together waitress super flexible it   Yes!  The teri beef delicious  and if salty  i only noticed meal  But most appreciated good char grill kitchen  Also cut meat tender itself skirt ny? but handled perfectly  both solid beefy taste slices meat going across grain each piece mouth tender  beautiful expert touch  teri sauce solid  not mainland style teriyaki  but local flavor  The sweet sour spareribs  also quite good  a tiny bit oily  big piece ginger turnips carrots  it good hearty  like you'd home   good teri beef though  ended finishing all teri beef taking SSS home  PS  it tasted great leftovers later night  mac salad solid Haupia cake  also world class  Reminiscent Napoleans Zippy's terms lightness cake   would surprised if owner's used run bakery someplace that  All cake only $5!    I'm full again  Two meals plate lunch and piece cake Clearly people know they're doing  really search give any suggestions all * possible slightly better rice?  Pressure cooker might rice stand too? steamed rice scoops pretty dense weakest part meal   * found myself waiting pay quite while register   It'd nice if wait staff took payment  but hey won't complain  <EOR> Best Hawaiian food Vegas   Hawaiian plate Friday only lau lau poke haupia mac salad rice under 10 bucks  Big portions!!

But other times dining myself other friends service slow even unfriendly  aloha spirit should every customer just people know  really way if know if you're regular but someone dines every now then customer service always best   For example looking forward dining today during lunch break but server's sassy attitude just killed me  Subpar service happened past but today worst far  walked no acknowledgement anyone  They'd look but then look down start talking other customers instead  even smile right you! remember used few years ago   After several minutes waiting sat but no menus grabbed them myself  server took orders stink face  Auntie if you're having bad day excuse yourself don't bring attitude customers! said thank when she set food down but didn't You're welcome  she literally just walked away  customer she knew walked few minutes later attitude changed  she immediately smiled talking peppy voice! friend even said Oh there's smile! Don't wrong probably still come back food but maybe delivery take out now on  some people noticed service gone down hill over years  sucks cause absolutely LOVE food but today's visit memorable wrong reasons  <EOR> Love place!! Great staff food!

When came two waitresses busy other customers told sit wherever  also own menus since hurry  used type service where pamper annoying asking many questions  complete opposite but waitresses super sweet can't complain! Plus since told them sharing brought extra plate  Some places remind specifically ask plate   The portions HUGE extremely filling! Teriyaki Beef I'm sure exactly name Chicken Katsu Moco Loco  came relatively quickly  Each plate came respective meats two scoops rice scoop macaroni salad    My mom shared Chicken Katsu plate which chicken deliciously crunchy well made came some sort BBQ sauce side  macaroni salad also good light good complement flavorful food  dad's Teriyaki beef good reminded Korean BBQ  slightly salty flavorful liking but if mixed rice much better    We saw some other people Korean short ribs which looked awesome if we're area we're definitely getting it!  The prices relatively cheap! around $9 12 plate meat rice macaroni salad  sure poke but listed three times menu each time ranging around $17 20 which deterred ordering it   Summary Good tasty food pretty good service Bad far strip visually appealing building <EOR> Good portions wonderful service staff  Furikake Shrimp Oxtail Soup fav  Ask Mark server he's super top sweet! <EOR> Went family during spring break  family enjoyed food portions huge! staff friendly appreciated must try list while vacation   Thumbs Korean Fried Chicken loved flavor would loved more if boneless white meat used instead wings Hawaii   Hawaiian roast pork point!

Honestly can't speak anything else menu because always when Island Flavor but worth trip delicious crispy local goodness Vegas   I'm sure many other delicious items menu but why bother something new when pretty much guaranteed you're going enjoy furikake chicken? attest par some best plate lunches chicken dishes back home Hawaii  Now  kind BIG deal considering when comes Hawaiian local food Vegas kind snob comparing real thing    Enough said think already said furikake chicken 10 times review already  yourself some! parking no problem here  staff pretty friendly experienced  also smaller 'Express' location off Eastern 215 if you're neck woods  <EOR> You can't wrong island food!  Dishes cost little more commercial Hawaiian food joints L L Ono's but love food it   portions!    I myself combo Hawaiian roasted pork w gravy chicken katsu   pork just right amount salt pepper although gravy added touch could probably just eat pork itself   Oh wait no rice   Gotta rice   chicken katsu crispy outside juicy inside   Sampled poke' fairly good   say fair because tasted better homemade poke'   really fan macaroni salad but macaroni salad level L L's     That day broke da mouth but probably also broke some skin gained another stretchmark     Hawaii always stopover when travel island home Guam   Island Flavors definitely going stopover everytime Vegas!! <EOR> I'm glad found place!

Each plate enough share two regular people   Service 4 5  Friendly service    Location long trek some considering location but think worth it   If visiting town unless your own transportation would suggest passing trying cab back Strip would hassle costly    Price 5 5  portion definitely worth it   Ambiance 4 5  Hawaiian inspired art works adorned walls but didn't pay much attention when saw plates food pick window   Easily solid 4 stars! <EOR> I love food here   Reminds being back home Big Island Hawaii   working way through menu tried almost everything including some specials   LOVE PLACE   isn't your normal main land Hawaii food place   If hawaii menus made just teriaki musubis katsu native Hawaiian food lau lau kalua pig etc  course not! roast beef hamburger steaks all kinds things around world   thing own way cooking them own flavor   Thats place all about!  takes foods different cultures Hawaii gives made Hawaii taste   misoyaki opakapaka korean chicken ox tail real Hawaii restaurant feel Big Island style anyways    best Hawaii food spot vegas eaten far   Aloha kitchen joke L L imitation Ross J's GREAT but place BEST!

Even brown rice lukewarm cooked much water! None servers refilled waters  happened??  So yeah     maybe its just luck depends working  giving them 3 stars because know food service really good  Sadly its only certain days  <EOR> One main reasons started proactive reviewing Yelp because place  Over year ago first visit pleased dining experience Island Flavor felt place deserved found about    I've now well over 30 times tried 90% menu  Everything remained consistent including food service  Only change now getting busier often hard seat!   My favorite dishes date kalua pig chicken katsu korean chicken Lau Lau oxtail soup poki great    Things personally come roast pork loco moco fried rice Portuguese sausage both little salty tastes but many other people seem enjoy them   Perhaps favorite part being regular restaurant overall family atmosphere which very welcoming relaxing  always treated own   If still haven't there's serious problem  <EOR> First off let say place exactly word Ono means!!! place legit! Bottom line! No where town going big island style Hawaiian food even ox tail soup seven days week?! No place town that?!? Everything teriyaki beef furikake chicken place  never ceases satisfy  lot Hawaiian places seem give normal low grade teriyaki beef but place teriyaki beef way should be! simple delicious hearty more importantly should represent flavor Islands  order didn't come very well because ordered last minute Saturday night  wasn't very edible because end day food called next day let them know wasnt satisfied made sure same meal waiting when down pick no additional cost  meaning customer service!!! love place would recommend anyone wants try Hawaiian food Las Vegas trip Island flavor! <EOR> Best local grinds Vegas Valley!
