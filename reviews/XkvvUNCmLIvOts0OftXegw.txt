My hardest dilemma breakfast always want try everything! Guess means need continue coming back! <EOR> I haven't Original Pancake House since lived Hawaii  years ago can't remember whether liked not  recently came Saturday morning  first thing thought when drove maybe bad idea  parking lot packed! even cars parked street  Seriously place good? walked many people waiting table  put name list told wait would 15 minutes  Surprisingly right did good job cleaning tables getting people seated quickly   Unfortunately wasn't impressed food  However 3 good things place 1  bacon!! Cut thick cooked very crispy just way it! Good bacon important   2  coffee  don't know but coffee great  prefer good amount sugar some cream but did add much both didn't taste bitter   3  sugar  love dispensers use because pouring sugar very easy compared usual small packets need torn open messy    Warning place loves onions!  First wanted order corned beef hash  asked waitress if could without onions but she said no because premixed  just short stack bacon pancakes  bit dry syrup watery  Isn't syrup supposed thicker side? Maybe being cheap diluted save money  Ewww  also ordered potatoes cheese side onions them  Big pieces too! *sigh* husband ordered bacon eggs  try strip bacon again good! Thick crispy tasty! comparison thin floppy ones other places  Try agree bacon right!   Service okay being extremely busy  Honestly don't see myself returning but if just order coffee side bacon! <EOR> Excellent food  Apple pancake die Benedict great! Def coming back again again! <EOR> Fine is   Greasy breakfast food   used groupon 12 20 00   glad did because food pricey   shared apple pancake really sweet eggy but just type pancake is   also order crispy bacon side eggs    shared everything   pay another 1 54 cents tax left tip   Reasonable overpriced if didn't groupon  <EOR> I really bad experience here    I dying try apple pancake heard many good things headed Original Pancake House  service terrible  server practically forgot table existed  wait long time anyone even approach table  When she finally did ordered coffee apple pancake  coffee came EW lipstick cup  Unfortunately didn't notice until waitress already wandered away table when finally able attention again took far long return fresh cup    When pancake arrived enormous  looked down fork preparation first bite apple y goodness appalled find fork dirty  again try waitress' attention replace fork which again took forever   Finally ready eat  flavor nothing spectacular became bored three bites in    I really don't many positive things say place can't say particularly motivated try again negative breakfast experience  <EOR> We love place   Dutch Babies awesome   also love crepes coffee servers!  Strawberry crepes only available when fresh strawberries season   concept! <EOR> Went Christmas Eve brunch  Very busy but professional staff obviously experienced keeping crowd happy   I ordered omelet spinach gouda cheese also Continental crepes  Omelet very good spinach plentiful fresh  cheese kind concentrated into area could spread little better  crepes very good tropical syrup but add syrup because only tiniest hint triple sec filling  course don't want overwhelm dish triple sec but only tasted three drops  fresh squeezed grapefruit juice good quite pulpy but $5 bit pricey  pancakes came omelet just pancakes well made but just pancakes  My daughter ordered corned beef hash braised ? eggs top believe Nutella crepe  hash dish very good  She did crepe wet  Side note lady walking through restaurant making balloon animals kids  No idea if regular thing but cool  <EOR>
