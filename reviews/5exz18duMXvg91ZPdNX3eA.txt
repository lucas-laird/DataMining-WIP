In any case end ordering 2 chicken strips $3 50 each breast $5 50 along chicken sandwich  total comes around $25! now takes another 20 minutes food  Mind chickens already all premade sitting right behind counter ready throw into bag right next huge tray now cold fries weren't allowed order while still hot! cashier continues telling people all order chicken   My number called food  tell guy supposed which he responds  ticket says ! Anyways    begin walking down strip pull strips munch while walking back hotel kid meal sized tiny! feel seen bigger strips when order nuggets other places!

Truth told could easily put away all 12 those strips last checked wasn't entire family! chicken sandwich wasnt great all  could tell chaos happening inside restaurant greatly affected sandwich rushed put together  soggy lacked flavor  Long story short    fried chicken good but experience never want back especially considering thousands other restaurant options all around one! <EOR> This spot located front of the ballys shopping eating area   Went quieter Monday evening still very fresh fried crispy juicy moist yes MOIST tasty signature sandwich  The bread perfectly chewy crispy same time chicken accompanied sassy pickles some fresh cabbage   ?

I'd say no but if craving hits just want something simple worth look  <EOR> My husband stopped late night meal watching show  Sunday night 11 pm quite few people here  ordered 4 whole wings meal which comes wings huge portion fries small side coleslaw  fried chicken only ok  definitely better fast food chains but best had  skin crispy but wasn't much flavor  also wish gave larger portion coleslaw balance oil chicken fries  only downside place literally no more sauces table sauce station lot empty bottles  Overall decent late night meal but probably would choose something else next time  <EOR> Okay sure if really hungry stroll down Vegas strip but fried chicken good!!

Service little slow prices okay  Fries also really tasty shoestring cut  coleslaw good but small portion size order go! really place but am only giving three stars extremely slow service  <EOR> By far hands down best chicken sandwiches chicken period matter ever entire life  prices extremely generous quality food serve  Seating limited however during lunch time during week no issue getting table outside cool breeze  Employees very friendly welcoming  yourself favor grab Firebird sandwich jump start your metabolism all alcohol consumption doing  <EOR> I don't give lot 5 star reviews but every bite better last BRFC  Unreal delicious  love fried chicken chicken tenders etc best best  Super juicy amazing flavor  look spicy hot but they're not they're just perfectly seasoned  won't crunch battered tender but instead almost crispy skin  fries good but if choose side opt smoked macaroni cheese  no idea kind cheese use but it'll life mission replicate this  O  M  G  10 10 would order again  husband Rancher raved it  Add your must visit list Vegas  <EOR> My new Fried Chicken FAVORITE!
