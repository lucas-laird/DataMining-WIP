When visiting food truck featuring foreign foods usually stuff you'd hard time finding USA in case would Arepas but Hot Dog looked good taste matched its appearance!  Although hot dogs common USA type isn't!  matter fact humble opinion if Chicago Hot Dog made Vienna brand meat won't it    but Venezuelan hot dogs GREAT!  I night couldn't see true color meat but wonderful flavor  almost Bavarian Weisswurst    load condiments sauces recommend adding green sauce  bottles tables   added something give little crunch slivers tortilla chips potato chips which all difference world   Really wonderful stuff!  The price includes canned soft drink traditional Venezuelan drink made sugar cane juice lime which opted glad did   tasted good quality limeade without having loads nasty chemicals artificial flavors   There's lots other interesting things menu all very reasonable prices    I'll back sure!!! <EOR>
