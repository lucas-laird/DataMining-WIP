My friends came late breakfast sadly disappointed breakfast selection 1pm Sunday Vegas all  friend ordered your own omelet only did mess order once but twice  complicated order either  top off took darn near 45mins food  waiter gave free bread screwing order    maybe compilation some    Needless say place waste time top off its VERY expensive food step above Denny's  least Denny's gets order right HOT! <EOR> I thought place pretty damn good  Especially 24 hour Vegas casino hotel diner  impression place probably influenced fact utterly famished when came late lunch  But sandwich very tasty huge portion   I ordered turkey avocado bacon sandwich wheat bread pile french fries side  sandwich enormous stuffed really good turkey perfectly ripened avocado crispy bacon  pile o' french fries really good! Shoestring crispy outside  Those fries better ones Bradley Ogden following night! No joke!  Pricey sandwich but said all Vegas restaurant reviews Vegas  hell expect? place actually great value because portion size overall good quality food  <EOR> Wouldn't Serve Royalty!  My goodness! $58 would expect decent meal  April 2011 ordered chicken sandwich potato salad husband Cuban black beans  Nothing fancy nothing hard cook just good solid food day walking strip   Honestly absolutely WORST chicken sandwich ever had  dry overcooked alfalfa not sprouts which bitter revolting  I never start taking apart sandwiches pick things off them but couldn't tolerate took green stems off  love chicken sandwiches but thing just did fit bill  also avocado which love but they'd failed add even touch salt them tasteless  should probably mention wasn't spec any kind sauce sandwich no mayo no mustard no salad dressing no honey mustard nothing! Which added overcooked dry meat effect  awful  potato salad made real mayo nice touch but greasy weird texture  Made wonder long it'd unrefrigerated  Didn't finish either   My husband non plussed sandwich too  He simply said better home   he didn't eat much beans which looked gross course black beans aren't most appetizing bean earth served all soupy white cup  Oh well   We could better more satisfying meal if we'd gone McDonalds    That being said service fine although being Caesar's Palace felt touch underclass dining here  end long day tired looking forward good meal  felt really screwed end dining experience  disappointment  <EOR> There certain disconnect between average food served five star prices charged   In essence glorified cafe  Nothing special far food quality quantity   My main complaint service prices  charged $52 Mexican salad two Cobb salads  god people   it's lettuce hard come restaurant  iced tea $5 00 plain even fancy tropical tea!
