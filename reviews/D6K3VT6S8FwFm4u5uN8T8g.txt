He made feel welcome ramen great  Hopefully next time room dessert <EOR> I've never left Yelp review we'll see goes   Food I ordered chashu ramen soft boiled egg +$1 00   ramen broth fine definitely tasty but would say far stretch exceptional   The noodles sub par  felt times if eating top ramen noodles more quality broth  price no matter relatively cheap compared other Vegas ramen bars unacceptable   Toppings very important ramen feel where Moko falls short most  only topping recieved 3 slices pork belly additional egg ordered  Granted could ordered more toppings but would quickly increased price  understand $8 50 bowl ramen cheaper most other ramen bars but if add several dollars worth toppings low starting price doesn't help   As taste toppings meat truly delicious  subtle char really set over edge  egg different story  didn't taste bad but creamy center egg noticeably cold  clear no way fresh   Overall food excellent but palatable   The nail Moko's coffin service   I wait least 45 minutes bowl ramen forgot even start order ended just canceling it  Water refills rare taste overall freshness food no way justified slow service especially considering only two other people eating time there   Overall food alright slow service unjustifiable  don't plan returning  <EOR> I based Yelp reviews found food absolutely delicious   portions small side but infused such tasteful ingredients perfectly prepared   during week no problem getting seat right away service very very friendly but professional  <EOR> Between going pho going ramen pho usually when comes noodle soups  However Moko Ramen changed attitude hurry  now frequented restaurant several times and friends' favorite places go    The restaurant itself smallish place bar around handful tables somewhat busy during dinner time however never wait table  simply decorated but very clean stylish looking  Servers friendly attentive  Music always good too!

Spicy prawns  The vibe hip modern  Very intimate setting perfect party  definitely want come back lunch! <EOR> Another great ramen place!  Conveniently located right across CSN   bad whole area across CSN didn't exist when going school there     There good crowd but plenty seating   Very clean there's huge TVs along wall behind bar     I ordered signature chaschu   size bowl perfect portion!  Comes 3 pieces chaschu thin noodles very flavorful milky broth     Interesting enough offer curry ramen   Basically just you'd expect japanese curry sprinkled load ramen noodles     I thought chaschu pieces thin didn't melt your mouth tenderness Monta does   Nonetheless still good     The noodles thinner used to   less used to   The broth very rich great hints garlic which awesome because love garlic!    Also moko bun   Moko bun comes but cut half if feel sharing   beef kimchi sweet steamed bun     If check yelp free scoop delicious green tea ice cream!  yes super delicious!  would say green tea ice cream tastes powdered white chocolate     Can check every time come free green tea ice cream? <EOR> Service slow day picked busy day them  waiter seemed overwhelmed attending each table  wished least another waiter help  Good thing though food good!!

Either way everything great  5 well deserved stars!!   I'll definitely come back next time we're coming through town  <EOR> My family found place yelp decided spend New Year's Eve whim couldn't happier decision  Coming Chicago plenty Korean fusion food before but Moko really stands terms unique take concept well pull off  flavor profiles dishes quite varied work really well stand outs included sea bass paired slaw mung beans carrots spicy sauce braised Korean short ribs paired potatoes gratin  Really though every dish good can't wrong anything menu    Ryan owner server provided exceptional service very friendly attentive while helping navigate food allergies giving recommendations even throwing complimentary dessert end  food very fairly priced quality several rounds drinks included bill came $40 person  atmosphere elegant but unfussy perfect all sorts occasions    Really can't recommend place enough  Sadly local region but definitely back if ever back Vegas  <EOR> Love place  Simple Ramen joint very basic menu but always delicious great service  Very reasonably priced small beautiful atmosphere  Definitely categorize neighborhood gem  <EOR> Review little more towards 4 5 stars Items sampled 30 Hour Sous Vide Berkshire Pork Belly Black Bean Sauce Noodle Beef Tataki Chicken Pottage Spicy Chicken Thigh order   Moko newest take Modern Asian Fusion though case twist Korean food  haven't sampled much fusion Korean but first foray some excellent flavors execution each dish spot on   My personal favorite Pork Belly tender but fat pork belly powerful some variations  While portion quite small 13 dollar price point tastes top notch  Korean scale HKII I'd say 5 10  Bonus points little roasted veggies underlying mung bean crepe  could served any high end restaurant far concerned   The Black Bean Noodle another excellent tasting dish though more line its roots  I'd say HKII 8 10  slurping all sauce afterwards too  little heartier some meat only dishes   Next followed Beef Tataki which some very tender moist slices high quality meat  wasn't particularly memorable some reason but everything tasted great presentation good too  HKII 6 10   The Chicken Thigh probably where most picky Don't wrong excellent piece chicken thigh cooked moist tender sauce quite tasty  just lacked some substance maybe breading if served tiny bit starch veggies even  sauce puts HKII 4 10   I enjoyed Chicken Pottage quite bit heartiest most filling dish evening some very good flavor it  Even porridge looked impressive visually  don't remember last time Samgyetang can't really judge Korean Is    But guess would 6 10    I would definitely tell person going expect traditional Korean food but modern take fusion  looking forward trying some more flavors lot them nuanced complex compared your typical Korean dishes   While felt meal very satisfying taste buds did feel wanted more now given sharing two other people could certainly tried some more but decided save next trip  If thing could suggest menu I'd some more heartier options almost filler! Moko Tapas bar Tapas often means always option paella such having shared bowl modern bibimbap something might fun twist idea   Price adds but much more typical tapas place very high quality  felt effort put into each dish plating pictures Yelp dolled all  Big props chef hope quality remains! <EOR> One best places eat Las Vegas   Great service food value   must if Korean food even slightest  <EOR> Amazing food! Great prices! owner Ryan super friendly customer oriented   Everything authentic made fresh  perfect little bistro conveniently located just across street street Charleston CSN campus  Everyone should eat here! <EOR> Ambiance great decor nice   weren't many people which thought odd but food great     love tapas beef short rib spicy chicken thigh beef tatki chliean sea bass veggies smoked mackerel pasta     everything great     just little pricey didn't happy hour prices   definitely again <EOR> I high hopes ramen place especially because just down street house highly rated fellow yelpers    The food place 5 5  Everything ordered including all sauces delicious  Some dishes ordered beef gyoza seaweed salad tofu salad stone bowl curry ramen all superb    The service place took off two stars  waited 40 minutes appetizers which ordered right sat down  Another 10 minutes rest food  dug quickly asked spoons three ramen but didn't end getting them until almost done soup  kimchee also came right very end   Even though service little rough server kind very apologetic pretty cut some slack being server myself all   Looking forward coming back food! Hopefully they'll service all straightened then  Btw don't forget your free green tea ice cream when check in  yum  <EOR> I frequent Moko during lunch hours review focused time frame  tried four different noodle plates all treat  personal favorite Jajangmyeon fire cracker noodle coming close second  good enough cheer long study session over CSN which Moko also includes discount students faculty  If your new Moko dont know order Ryan able steer right direction  Very friendly service delicious food great décor prices Moko #1 stop  believe also wifi students access when studies food must crammed together short time  If yet your missing out  Details dinner comming soon  <EOR> Slow service  Took 15 minuets lemonade   We ordered spicy ramen waiter asked which broth wanted choose vegetarian base yet found meat chunks food  When asked he said pork  guess said menu strange name think he would mention since asked vegetarian broth  He didn't offer remake without give discount  Waste money!! Rude unapologetic  <EOR> Consistently great ramen  Tastes super fresh salty other top places  Also style ramen combination Japanese Korean  <EOR> Great people service   Very high quality food   expecting better based stellar reviews but very enjoyable experience  <EOR> I food delivered group lunch order maybe delivery service's fault but bowl ramen wasn't impressive   broth came styrofoam container noodles chashu plastic bowl   Maybe delivery service took long but broth no longer very hot   noodles clumped rubbery consistency even added soaked broth while   chashu little tough even gave them long bath broth   But think main complaint broth seemed kind bland   just really no flavor it   hoping maybe flavoring drifted deeper undersurface layer but no matter stirred same bland broth   Like stated before didn't food restaurant time took service deliver may significantly degraded quality food   again if experience significantly different edit review <EOR> Food AMAZING! Staff super friendly helpful prices great too! no complaints all  definitely plan become regular ! <EOR> Service very nice food some hits misses   Came dinner night buddy mine ordered bunch stuff share  restaurant empty 6pm staff very nice seated right away took drink orders  pork belly $10 very tasty seasoned well sea bass overlooked fresh very chewy which unusual  short ribs very good also  ordered stone bowl bibimbap $12 good all ground beef very greasy rice soft didn't any crunch should flavor bit off too    Service very attentive prices rather high small portions  Floor very clean  Parking easy  <EOR> Some your Phos great! Waiting time tens long sometimes hard waiters' attention <EOR> This place understaffed making service bad  Although being busy least expected decent service  top bad service ramen over priced even good   Very sad expected lot place considering decent reviews  <EOR> I've rooting place since opened  Really sweet guy seemed trying accommodating etc food great  menu limited but menu great  I'd say they'd open month when first third visit last 8 9 months ago   I ordered shrimp fried rice shrimp small looked if bugs imbedded rice  actually never seen shrimp small  ordered coke which server brought poured me  last time see awhile she never checked back me   The place pretty small guess feel only need server lunch but  wrong since think lunch probably busy time  server would other tables drop things off then look down floor when she left table  never any time just catch eye passing  finally stared kitchen waiting come flagged down way   When finally able check asked box cup full coke  When she came back she brought boxed food reiterated needed cup  when she told didn't cups   Did mention sign front door says now deliver lunch    Clearly don't include drinks   I extremely disappointed visit Moku even though incredibly close long time before again  <EOR> Having Korean wife used eating lot Ramen   Let's just say typical Ramen used to  okay dolsot bibimbap very good   May given 4 stars but charge refills lemonade just okay costs $3 per glass  cool <EOR> I supposed meet friends lunch today ended getting lost  stumbled upon place thanks Yelp   First impressions coming noticed clean looks  Very trendy modern meets retro feel place   Good choice music compliment    Ordered Honey Chicken Teriyaki salad side   Definitely love presentation food taste good boot   $8 well spent!  owner Ryan extremely kind provided excellent service  Definitely recommend!
