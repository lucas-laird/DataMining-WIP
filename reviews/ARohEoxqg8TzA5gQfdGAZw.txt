We knew Benihana when located Hilton always treat dine there  also close Scottsdale all time   The meal Benihana strip highlight culinary disappointment expedition Las Vegas  thought reached rock bottom Maggiano's wanted leave good impression  Benihana always good us  Until today   Before he started cooking cook explained he personally prepared food kitchen before coming table   I ordered Chicken Teriyaki  chicken came no Teriyaki  Big chunky pieces unappetizing chicken  Gross!!! told cook he said oops forgot  He called waiter brought little container cold runny teriyaki sauce kitchen  same when cooked it!  My husband ordered Benihana excellence beef julienne which he loves shrimp  When he served piece steak came huge piece fat that cook jokingly called Las Vegas bacon husband said he ordered  He knows beef julienne looks he ordered many times before  We called waiter ask happened  He said splash meadow  ordered!!  He cut off saying well meat shrimp same thing what   Before leaving talked manager Mr Ralph Treszi basically did care  He offered another chicken teriyaki  What? when ready leave? interested  All he did give card tell call before Scottsdale next time he'll ask Scottsdale location something   care  wanted he assumes mistakes staff act beggar another location assume shortcoming  pathetic!  Our cook made obvious he loves tables people cheering clapping antics  Although enjoy having fun cheering screaming clapping people felt treated 3rd world customers  Behind large table people celebrating birthday he paid them more attention table    This location just plain greedy unfriendly  worse experience am going contact headquarters it  <EOR> Celebrated 43rd Birthday 9 29 16 only wind food poisoning!!!

Rice cools off fast white rice just enjoyable eat itself  Anwyay wasn't bad server nice  meat tender chef table told cook tender  tried home but course couldn't home meat still came kind dry  <EOR> What fantastic experience   Kyle Chef  preparation taste humor fantastic   Marco server he awesome   Great customer service   Very attentive always checking us   Kyle Marco Benihana Vegas thank much  guys rock <EOR> There plenty good Japanese steakhouses Vegas but most them off Strip  If Benihana Fashion Show your only option guess I'd recommend but if venture elsewhere should try Ohjah Osaka Valley's other options  unless PLENTY time eat!  I met friend lunch slow Wednesday during Restaurant Week  Can't $20 soup edamame grilled shrimp fried rice veggies green tea ice cream!

Don't think manager could done something new machine coffee carafe T Fal boil hot water meanwhile hot water machine being built China sent pony express restaurant? Maybe he could called Sparkletts order hot water dispenser unit 5 gallon hot water bottle top  Being manager he can't even manage water! This must scam restaurant pulling just won't provide free hot tea  would prefer PAY drink   The server brought some lemon wedges  requested  heaped top soggy paper bar napkin instead using small bowl  lemons looked slimy bent used  server delivered them hand without plate under lemons  didn't use any lemons because knew would sick  guest asked server plate lemons  She said don't plates  The family seated table extremely loud  bringing issues manager's attention he said harassing him! Rather deal fix small problems he immediately threatened kick out  told he didn't know word harass meant he should look dictionary  He called mall security officers remove restaurant  manager doesn't any public relations skills nor he respectful guests   The manager table where seated stood front family yelling loud family others restaurant said loud  Everybody stopped talking hear he say  He intended did embarrass us  shamed left restaurant every guest staring security officers escorted out  guest never spoke manager any reason thrown out! The security officer told manager kicked many guests past also said he nice person   There better restaurants Las Vegas where respectable service hot water need  Neither guest nor consume alcohol accused being kicked reason   I ever plan dining Benihana's again lost business family friends already told them happened   Benihana doesn't care if guest publicly shamed kicked doing nothing wrong  manager power trip  suspect he threatened employees say happened when if corporate investigates  don't want lose jobs but know manager bullies guests kicking them force  If want take chance being kicked come Fashion Show Benihana otherwise enjoy more peaceful restaurant  <EOR> Amazing food conveniently located across street Palazzo Venetian if your staying Wynn its right next located outside Las Vegas Fashion show mall <EOR> We came boyfriend's birthday dinner  made 6pm reservations little early  restaurant set into almost 2 different dinning experiences  side pretty basic dining other side  set several chefs tables where entertained chef possibly sitting complete strangers  It only 2 seated  hostess sat two more parties 2 people  Each table accommodates 8 guests total  The show fun chefs playing your food while cook everyone gets watch  ordered steak chicken shrimp chicken  Both entrees part 5 course dining including soup salad shrimp appetizer main course white rice vegetables hot tea finish  option substitute your rice fried rice highly recommend it! Best fried rice ever had!  At end dining all servers gathered around sang happy birthday Japanese then English  also offered small dessert too  The prices extremely reasonable service team really exceeded expectations  great way celebrate birthday any occasion  <EOR> I love Benihanas but location nasty couldn't even believe it  turned off Benihanas while    restaurant looks new cooks too  cook orders wrong switch plates people didn't know  drinks watered down  When chef cooking food food falling off grill onto table he would scoop back into grill ! didn't wanna hurt chef feelings due fact he look first job he just training    <EOR> Great food excellent service! chef Charlie made extra effort sure all entertained satisfied  several different Benihannas she made experience stand others  server Jana also very helpful attended regularly  would definitely recommend friends family! <EOR> Dined Benihana Vegas Strip lunch  seated immediately staff extremely accommodating  dined booth bar area restaurant    Items ordered Chili Shrimp Roll consisted crab cream cheese tempura shrimp in buffalo sauce garnished jalapeños cilantro item just okay would order again recommend Lunch Duet Hibachi Shrimp + Chicken Filet + Sea Scallops  Both lunch entrees fabulous!

Sally did come couple times check if needed any more hot water etc    I understand such slow day! Only 3 tables total  party 3  ladies behind us already done single lady nearly done well   There couple came 20 25 minutes sat across us  understand super slow  Sally just chilling back sushi bar guys  manager doesn't seem care much either  He having some cheddar fries hot fries in guests view just chilling   Shouldn't manager eat floor anyway? just looked unprofessional    There vendor person working something needed all employees's attention  Which guess fine    When finally ready pay needed change  bill $51 gave Sally $100  Sally then says need find $9 you  She gave back $40 only  She supposed give $49  does that  give half change back? dad didn't wanna wait any longer he just said keep $9  She probably didn't think going tip good  Oh well  probably best tip she going all day anyhow    I don't usually come often much used to  think staff needs new training serve drinks utilize trays  Managers should definitely send people home if super dead  called Labor control  staff fold napkins something doesn't require personal conversations  just doesn't look professional  Guess just don't give shit  Hostess needs trained retrained table numbers GuestBridge system   I wanted say something manager but don't think he would care  He busy eating cheddar fries  <EOR> Daniel absolutely fantastic!
