Plus $21 burger iced tea $9 more should pay even casino setting capitalizing desperate conventioneers  awful experience combined Burger Bar's drop off probably now claim no decent burger options south Tropicana along Strip until much more south away casinos  If you're Mandalay would still recommend Burger Bar over far better quality money but can't promise anything anymore  <EOR> Worst host told party 3 wait 15 minutes then proceeded seat other people complain manager disinterested making right <EOR> Best bloody Mary's town great service bar  believe name Raquel  <EOR> Horrible food even worse service  fact mandala bay should ashamed restaurant such scale inside hotel  COME HERE!

Not sure if good bad     service okay but second serving cappuccino took over 10 mins me   I custom omelette both mornings but due focus business interactions actually didn't remember if food good bad!       I casual setting atmosphere could facilitate discussion  <EOR> Stopped some hot chocolate came warm hot server very apathetic  maybe 30 minutes he never checked once  No plans ever return  <EOR> I ordered Caramel Macchiato cup 1 4 full   thinking really ????  back talked girl made she rude   She said Italian macchiato  don't care don't serve 1 4 cup shot foam  smaller cups if  going serve customer Texas  isn't disappointed   Secondly girl says u want? said this  want more coffee substance  Give Cappuccino  She handed cup without knowing said mine?

Wrong  worst salad ever tried  croutons extremely soggy chewy probably moisture all salads pre made sitting refrigerators  chicken breast also extremely dry inedible    The sandwich ordered okay but avocado real fresh cut avocados  some kind green mixed things avocado paste poor excuse avocado   There better options if keep walking thru casino I e  burger bar   Avoid place if can  <EOR> This probably most ok'est ok restaurants personally  boyfriend came dinner drink Friday night  no wait which nice server super friendly but food just really ok  felt pretty overpriced was   We started tempura shrimp appetizer  flavor good but only came 5 pieces wasn't anything special  entree Caesar salad  portion size large taste good but once again nothing special  Probably two most exciting things meal Bloody Mary giant carrot cake  Those only things could recommend   I'm sure I'd come back again unless really only option open around  <EOR> This place awesome!   We happened upon place while knocking bucket list item walking entire strip  waiter Joey friendly attentive  General Manager    think name Nick ? seated also extremely personable    Will definitely back when friends family come into town visit    Try Mac n' Cheese Carrot Cake! <EOR> We breakfast meeting during convention  bit loud even 9am but then again Vegas  Service very good  stuffed French toast banana Nutella which good but bit sweet side  know should expect when ordered it!

Could only handle 2 bites fan     3rd visit 11pm no idea happening but took them 20 minutes even acknowledge husband standing take counter! husband patience saint saw extremely understaffed but why hell does take manager 15 minutes espresso? poor dude ordered espresso just seemed amazed whole process but can't badger someone touching your food ya know? people just standing waiting pay canned soda only two employees behind counter just said take waived them off   more annoying thing? other workers restaurant meandering around take area! Come now help them out!   Anyways ready leave first 20 mins but husband really hungry again we're mercy being BFE Mandalay midnight  being over 30 minutes even having anything show forced husband leave bought banana some Dibs ice cream sundries store quiet stomach until could proper meal morning    Thank goodness checking next day well  <EOR> Citizens located within Mandalay Bay great place low key lunch laid back dinner  concept open indoor outdoor walking area hotel seating well to go options  Aesthetics could described classy American diner   When coworker landed night starving quickly decided Citizens  French Onion Soup side Mac Cheese  warned! French Onion Soup meant appetizer  comes very large bowl meal itself I'm sad say much wasted delicious was  mac cheese also quite good  also glass red wine which also came huge glass  Ok wine but worth price tag    Days later when husband enjoying pool looking food options decided Citizens take pool  opted chicken cheese quesadillas which came sides guacamole sour cream pico de gallo  portions large once again quesadillas excellent!   If you're staying within Mandalay MGM resort may charge your room along any other restaurants  <EOR> They Swiss cheese entire first round 2016 NCAA tournament when every grocery store Las Vegas could instantly replenish them   If want Mayonnaise salt pepper sandwich apply themselves instead give bread cheese meat force your own sandwich    said wasn't bad over priced ate few times  <EOR> Didn't liked experience   Waiting time long appetizer 30 min order it  Chicken strips moist inside but really hard outside  husband liked lasagna big testy  order meatloaf Didn't say anywhere menu spicy going be  When mentioned waiter response its probably green peppers chopped inside  couldn't eat few bites ate mushed potato  didn't offer change order take off bill even give discount  even sorry u home hungry  <EOR> I visited Citizens late dinner checking in  restaurant pretty big no wait seated  sat outdoor area which nice people watch least illusion being outside    We artichoke dip which among best served both homemade tortilla chips grilled pita  friend vegetarian ordered veggie sandwich off menu  Mahi Mahi fish tacos  sandwich huge loaded good veggies  barely able finish two three tacos portion also large plate   The service sort slow but server friendly  only bummer since mini frig room pre stocked full no way take leftovers us  Overall portions almost big but price still reasonable enjoyed view restaurant courtyard area  Citzens good stop quick simple meal  <EOR> I honestly don't know place place only couple stars! Over May 19th big group woman vegas soon sister laws bachelorette weekend    It Saturday night needed somewhere 11pm latest  Having 12 women getting table ANYWHERE nearly impossible without LEAST hour wait  just walking around trying find place take asked hostess menu asked wait time 12  Just then manager Matt walked told politely would probably hour wait  group wanting wait long said thank started give menus back    Just then he looked over closed lunch side Citizen stopped us  He says know ladies let set table guys! Dont anywhere watched over closed side set table 12 JUST US!! great server and feel horrible cant remember name She attentive took care us! EVERYONE extremely happy food  may seem steep pricing but portions pretty awesome!   To things better he constantly checking sure being taken care happy food  He even brought HUGE pieces cake ice cream bride and other half table  Thank Matt making visit your restaurant memorable being accommodating!   I cant wait eat again next visit Vegas! <EOR> I triple bacon burger which standard burger 3 strips bacon    something said truth advertising  hamhock mac n cheese  pasta bit over cooked taste  However smokieness hamhock  If pasta bit less overdone would favorite mac n cheese plates  burger juicy everything served side mayo lettuce tomato onion pickles side  add whatever want add it  <EOR> We heading Starbucks but decided check Citizens coffee since something new  disappointed! First off waited line almost 30 minutes  understand Vegas busy everyone wants coffee BUT line isn't long because place busy line long because service slow  think place offers coffee breakfast would better staffed morning  only girl working register to go cafe restaurant  She supper sweet wasn't fault wait long   finally turn   Yay! Right? Well waited very long time told mocha lattes  Wth?  Ugh  Starbucks! <EOR> Citizens Kitchen Bar would gotten just 2 stars but couple items able bump 3 stars   First all if opt dine dinner least couple times gone Sunday 10pm gets really LOUD because band plays just across way   Sometimes just want wind down some good conversation but can't really extremely loud music playing   If headache forget coming here!  When back recently opted just take food go   Anyway cozy ambiance place trendy sexy vibe Citizens neither   no problem dining time   On both visits service meh   hostess time dined started seat patio area closest live band  When requested quieter table inside she sat table right next patio making little difference noise level There's definitely no service smile Citizens least experience   As food definitely wasn't impressed first visit   wasn't hungry opted french onion soup taste dining companion's penne prosciutto   Again meh   Even though weren't impressed visit back Citizens recent trip Vegas since staying Four Seasons next door options limited late night dining   ordered to go counter chose cheese quesadilla time salted caramel parfait   quesadilla didn't care but did parfait   ended coming back few days later pick blondie   some toffee tasty overall did disappoint! I forgot take pics food picked go  Overall would recommend Citizens treats to go counter if late you're mood fast food no other options nearby   Otherwise wouldn't way meal here  <EOR> I don't know why place such bad rap  kale salad added chicken order fruit salad came $27 which way better pretty much anywhere else Vegas healthy! <EOR> Most restaurants strip come hefty price tag convenience no doubt! When friends family come Vegas stay Mandalay Bay recommend Citizens!  There's little bit something everyone! sandwiches salads vegetarian meat lover appetizer entre works everyone!   I love kale brown rice salad! add salmon another protein well done salmon spirit animal! you're solid! artichoke spinach dip isn't creamy packs perfect punch small bites everyone share    Their wine craft beer selection just right along having cocktails fit happy hour vibe   As most places strip service under par which reason rating place higher  server wasn't very attentive friendly time around but better service bar area  <EOR> First off disclaimer   would point experience happened while high acid  fact does any bearing specific rating food general follow    We entered restaurant  greeted bar man quite muscularity toned curly fancy mustache  He mildy creepy vibe but he nice  point figured would just order Reuben sandwich one favorite to's lately The food came though exterior only lukewarm interior sandwich seemed 600+ degrees nearly resulted 3rd degree oral burns  bit into sandwich consistency taste only imagine mixture elmers glue sawdust corned beef meat flavoring would taste like  fuck Reuben sandwich badly!?   felt  chewing sandpaper mouth  Remember now mouth already burned hot coals mysterious corned beef meat dust   Unfortunately all happening top loss overall perception time space  utterly horrible terrifying moment started replay over over head  Mere seconds felt hours   I work very very VERY hard eat through sandwich only shit but also very highly priced  proceeded eat because starving wasn't going able eat while  complaining food buddy also seeing fellow customer walked complained food onto venue  point suddenly felt nauseously ill proceeded bathroom vomit profusely watch piece shit sandwich enter toilet plasmatic form all while mentally transforming through different layers human existence universes head due trip  removed majority sandwich system realized little bit coke left previous day   did couple Trump bumps before exiting bathroom   Overall food atmosphere confidently rate restaurant 1 5    EDIT  just remembered forgotten shitty cold French fries were  5 5   zero math geeks there  <EOR> I staying Mandalay Bay conference tried many restaurants there  Citizens better ones  Firstly food very good  cob salad perfect  liked clean fresh decor    The service mixed  Depending working may may good experience  often walked see if Katie working bar  If she I'd definitely walk meal  need more Citizens  <EOR> Citizens Kitchen Bar located inside Mandalay Bay hotel  offer typical American fare  interesting thing place did know first actual restaurant also to go area where all salads sandwiches basically pre made ready sold  came twice most recent visit ate once restaurant also some food to go other time   When did eat restaurant service great  host very nice server  manager even stopped ask meal going  definitely take customer service seriously which good thing!  Food Chicken Cobb Salad Chicken cheese egg cucumber tomato bacon  salad pretty good refreshing  also give choice dressing want but stuck typical cobb salad dressing which bleu cheese  $18  Turkey Avocado Turkey cheese sprouts tomato lettuce avocado lemon aioli cranberry walnut bread  really good sandwich most part  tasted really healthy which good since always eat worst food while Vegas  $18  French Dip Steak Thin sliced prime rib caramelized onions provolone cheese au jus  Served cole slaw pickle  probably best tasting French dips had  Towards end started little salty side but overall thought delicious sandwich  $19  Typically would probably lower 3 stars since prices pretty high amount food but Vegas nothing Vegas cheap  spent over $10 lousy piece pizza before I'd rather spend $20+ delicious sandwich! would definitely recommend Citizens Kitchen Bar anyone Mandalay Bay looking your typical American food  <EOR> Came Citizen quick dinner family    At 7pm Thursday weren't super packed seated immediately  didn't drink however member party enjoyed lemon drop martini  waitress very attentive quick! I order Turkey Burger which massive added some pepper jack cheese seal deal  I quickly chowed down couldn't attempt even eat dessert  left happy fell into food coma less hour later  <EOR> Ate bar side 26th best service any restaurant ate all week  server Joyce awesome  drinks always full never sat dirty dishes even brought new napkins wings  recommended cousin hot wings wasn't disappointed  best wings long time  Also stir fry pretty good  Cant wait back next time Vegas  <EOR> food service amazing! little pricey but everything strip is   just comes territory  ordered eggs benedict signature breakfast potatoes full hours! super satisfied restaurant definitely recommend <EOR> 4 29 2018 2am review cashier glasses earrings very rude sassy attitude  waiting 30 mins line proceeded order sandwich rudely said don't serve sandwiches order certain menu  calmly asked why no sign stated  this  He rudely said he sign tried obnoxiously shake hand  guy obviously does know anything customer services  He should quit but sure since he working crap job he can't anything better  If can't simple minimal job life  Good luck  <EOR> Got eat coworkers finished walking MAGIC   We seated 15mins  Thought quite fast  all ordered appetizers since werent super hungry  ordered waffle fries came gravy bacon bits   yea If plan order dont    Why? Wholly cow heavy sodium  ones soaked gravy edible   other items ordered pretty generic chicken fingers basically just fried chicken strips cup veggies you know ones frozen aisle market? If crying over appetizers already imagine main course!! <EOR> I love place! Stopped today looking breakfast decor caught attention right away  server Chris very attentive made great reccomendations  food really good  recommend ultimate breakfast cause pancakes delicious  also iced coffee go  definitely back next time town! <EOR> This place overpriced meh service    ordered croissant BLT Turkey   dry just tasted boring compared others  expensive $17 sandwich   burger also dry  Service slow very enthusiastic  The two hosteses front friendly all  <EOR> So probably most affordable place eat inside Mandalay Bay   eatery indoor seating well patio seating   located next Lupo restaurant    I wanted low carb option breakfast stopped take look quick offerings   pastries salads coffees    I ordered Cobb salad which cost $11  lettuce cubes Swiss cheese bacon eggs scallions tomatoes   decent size nice cashier gave extra ranch dressing free   salad looked bit messy compared other ones saw display case but tasted pretty good nonetheless    The caffe latte $5 made order   delicious hot coffee made well    I'd stop again try breakfast items if stay hotel again   <EOR> I came group friends lunch overall would give 3 5 stars   your typical casual Las Vegas lunch spot American Food  Food Portions large price pretty good value    Teriyaki salmon bowl filling but salmon portion very small compared huge amount brown rice  BLT sandwich Tons bacon friend said very tasty  Fish Chips piece fish enormous friend really enjoyed dish  The fries delicious good wine beer list   Customer Service very friendly accommodating   easily able split checks us   Overall would way eat multiple restaurants all Las Vegas hotels very comparable   But if happen Mandalay Bay hotel want casual spot eat would good spot  <EOR> The food wasn't bad but wasn't particularly good either  Pair relatively high prices $9 breakfast burrito $9 smoothies etc particularly high value proposition    The smoothie Green    something? can't remember  But Kale Avocado wasn't bad  stomach wasn't feeling great heavy dinner night before soothing effect  However wan't best kale smoothy probably most expensive ever $9 ehhh      The breakfast burrito wasn't particularly good but hearty satisfying  pre made morning can't change anything them  while pre made need grilled order take quite some time  worst both worlds overall but still best option relatively quick hearty breakfast morning    Still stopped almost every morning staying Mandalay bay business conference really wasn't much competition quick morning eats vicinity    I would likely stop food if attending morning conference sessions Mandalay Bay conference center again but probably outside circumstance  <EOR> We ordered food cafe's counter  When sat down tables server came tell because didn't order directly server couldn't sit table  95% tables completely free  server then reiterated leave Save your money somewhere doesn't kick its customers  <EOR> Ate some friends whilst waiting show House Blues since parking Mandalay Bay involves coming little early grabbing spot next escalators parking garage coming time driving around thirty minutes scour every level monolithic parking structure trying find place only barely fit your compact car into because rented Hummers side straddling lines opted come early bite while waited  The service fairly good though iced tea ran few times during meal  wasn't hugely busy but waiter did several tables concurrently forgive oversight  He still friendly courteous  service sets most any restaurant Strip apart since food usually pretty decent but often over priced  The food quite good double burger  two grilled cheese sandwiches which say fiance wondered whether we'd show when ambulance called  survived some miracle came smile face half burger to go box could finish killing myself later NASA back calorie count calculation thing  Overall I'd probably come back here pretty friendly little place decent amount food money  Yes prices higher off strip restaurant but portions still good  <EOR> This basically counter style food place   Everything fairly fresh but all pre packaged  coffee selections oddly named but coffee decent   son did tuna salad all but scarfed down apple cinnamon muffin easily enough  Cobb salad chintzy good stuff used iceberg lettuce ack    It filled need but barely  <EOR> For food would've given them 3 stars  tuna salad sandwich  But service horrible  sitting inside daughter because just ordered sandwich she eating donut  drinking hot chocolate  gentlemen called name give order decided approach tell daughter sit outside!! Because wasn't dining in  Very unprofessional douche bag! Just because wasn't dining didn't give right treat way! Never again am even stepping into place!!!! <EOR> Great breakfast place although awfully pricey  solid California omelette that'll keep feeling well fed hours which great because if you're traveling work it'll also eat good chunk your per diem  ordered juice coffee also believe $25 before tip  <EOR> Like most people mentioned previously mediocre food Vegas price  convenient because open 24 7 don't need reservation but food just ok  crab cake benedict breakfast very good soups dinner super salty chicken noodle french onion point being inedible  Would eat if u choice? No  convenient? Yes  <EOR> I give kudos place because only eatery besides Subway open 24 hours Mandalay Bay Delano  Note evening menu does change doesn't provide lot options  ordered cheese quesadilla which yummy fresh but something could home    We ate dinner crispy shrimp On appetizer menu delicious! I'd back just order that  also Mac cheese which tasty but comparable other places  also spinach dip mashed potatoes which wouldn't order again  Tasteless spinach dip said artichoke but pieces small infrequent can't even consider artichoke    Service both times mediocre  opinion when all other options exhausted  thanks Citizens staying open drunk people! <EOR> Okay  Food pretty good  Seating efficient  Biggest issue customization your order  ask want your eggs but result doesn't match results  yesterday today  Yesterday ordered two poached eggs medium  received very easy very hard  Today both easy side  Lady next similarly complained he fried eggs under cooked she ordered  think gets lost desire turn over tables quic <EOR> Located inside Mandalay search good breakfast  place ayyyy ok but greatest  ordered corn beef hash skillet little disappointed salty greasy tasted  know corn beef hash but hoping little more pizzaz  The coffee though really good  am happy did stand long Starbucks line morning  Next time am sure if visit place again since memorable  <EOR> I surprised find only place open eat 1 30 am last visit Mandalay Bay   used hotel always thought more options   Anyways ended eating 2x within 4 hours     You sit down restaurant decent menu available order counter   latter better over priced smaller bites   former wider selection Vegas strip priced diner food   I wish more options   But 4 30 morning being all night still wasted place ain't bad     p s   pastries counter good  <EOR> My wife consider restaurant favorite Las Vegas  may find peculiar however $49 having prime rib  butter your mouth absolutely ridiculous  deal also comes glass wine Caesar salad well great waitstaff  also note fish chips equally awesome   Every time come into Las Vegas always ask Bailey serve table  She absolutely amazing highly recommend see if decide establishment  <EOR> I ate Citizens twice Vegas trip  Once late night once breakfast  Citizens open 24 7  Good breakfast lunch dinner late night etc    We never wait long table  Both visit's wait staff cool  Very attentive nice    The food isn't bad either  bit expensive but else expect restaurant inside hotel Mandalay Bay   Loco Moco good needed more gravy over beef patty though  Cheesecake awesome   check into Yelp free cheesecake your entree  Citizens' breakfast pancakes super good     Two good experiences here  Redeem your M Life card use your M Life points  <EOR> Attracted idea comfort food done upscale brought Citizens hoping find food akin some similar concepts around town   Although decor actually quite nice pastries look tasty we didn't sample them utterly underwhelmed delivery     Our server friendly honest very much appreciated responded requests suggestions very well but impression server sampled all offerings having real struggle recommending anything us     I started off drink called American Pie you guessed apple flavored which best thing all night right down ring cinnamon around martini glass   We shared spinach artichoke dip which sprinkle parmesan top   chips mixed bag tortilla chips pita chips   problem some chips soggy stale tasting some crisp fresh  pita mostly hard few soft bites   dip itself lacking flavor but tasted ok     For meal server's suggestion split entree due large portion size    delight split entree brought two separate plates   Some establishments separate thought nice touch   However blue cheese burger quite disappointing   bun boring burger dry over cooked blue cheese no distinguishable flavor goat cheese    mac cheese hamhock also lacked any identifiable cheese flavor only light hint mild cheddar   side fries soggy matchstick size fries   I expected more establishment Mandalay Bay   There few interesting menu items but when asked them server hesitated recommend them   They hangover brunch $25 bottomless mimosas  They also 24 burgers 24 minutes challenge $40 00 unless eat them all then free     I can't imagine back unless just sample dessert  <EOR> Some most overpriced bland food ever   breakfast platter called poached eggs terrible   Service just average  <EOR> Waiter really nice convenient because opened 24 hours  Ordered fish chips HUGE portion fries good fish decent  prices little pricey side but expected  <EOR> We ended going shark thingie Mandalay Bay  5 adults three kids aged between 10 months 3 years  Food overpriced subpar but surprise  friend asked if possible bolognese 10 months old  waitress didn't even blink tell don't   then asked another waiter then waitress came again she spoke chef he agreed time exception prepare small portion but $7  didn't care she could should said beginning  Then lifetime famous order came super spicy  10 month old  haven't touched but course charged paid $7  took home ended trash   Overall would give 2 stars food nothing special overpriced over cooked but edible 1 service  There's nothing more annoying getting any service when dining   Would eat again  <EOR> Vegas many many ways all wrong  motto should some sort city wide ziplock sealing tightly even vapors escape metaphorically alluded to municipality black hole   No  motto should more truthful perhaps more pithy  new motto which speak would something Nothing exceeds excess   And perhaps no place encapsulates better place  Want know what's dessert case? Well just walk or waddle yourself over look  dessert menu five things order any they're huge   dessert case probably 5X but damn if tell is  menu itself number things it  Order any them but appetizers come cookie sheet  only does wonders carefully crafted ambiance but adds flair mystery things  instance can't begin imagine food waste place must through but betting toss lot more anyone ever eats    Actually given flavor almost guarantee  almost hear smacking your lips right now? mean say bunch substandard word best grub served some very smarmy prick looks vaguely Fred Arminsen but far funny even amusing wait maybe Fred Arminsen! yet full tilt condescending attitude all but insists should grateful he deigned bother mere mortals  Maybe  it  Maybe wait staff elegantly laid pristine serene little oasis flood body odor stale cigarette smoke isn't but rather we're them  Now know why flew here  wonder if would insult if tipped 150%   I'm but back somehow   Then again great deal if lot right? may expensive but least mediocre! Expensive nature biz Vegas comes territory apparently does throwing any old thing front people   place clearly doesn't care patrons coming more jaded places seen  Maybe ought just throw all Citizen way old Soviet Union  thinking food line metal bowls plates  only thing served potato soup cabbage garlic along small roll may may moldy  Drink choices cheap vodka brackish water  If nothing else would least accurately mirror contempt customers place clearly seems have   Also everything else Vegas place loud  <EOR> Love place!
