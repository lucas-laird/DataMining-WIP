What's awesome steam pots then?  For starters steam pots NEVER overcook your precious cargo load seafood guys put into your dish  Seriously everytime ordered something amazed 1 quality seafood 2 portions seafood 3 perfectly tender succulent seafood cooked each time  other thing just watching guys cook creations using pots    it's cool!   We usually order combo pan roast which runs hefty $20    but if consider fact huge portions shrimp lobster big pieces lump crab   PLUS could easily feed 3 people servings get  Well bad deal right? What's also best just being able specify your specific heat level ANY dish  accommodate you  requested 4 fresh habaneros pan roast before   but usual scale 1 10 applies those accustomed H bomb refer it   If tomato cream based pan roast doesn't suit several other dishes made exclusively steam pots seafood bouillabaisse w crab legs mussels clams shrimp gumbo e g  crab only shrimp only combo pasta dishes vongole shrimp etc  well Alaskan chowder jambalaya red beans rice  never tried namesake oysters but heard good things   I'm just bit oyster snob if don't know source them Kumomotos Blue Points etc usually shy away eating them  But then again why bother? B c all need know STEAM POTS FTMFW!!!!  One final word advice packs line around dinner time waits long hour more depending party size only 18  seats bar   Since everything first come first serve don't expect any favoritism joking around skipping line  Dolly JJ Greg serious when comes line  Think soup nazi   If you're short time between lunch hour dinner time 1 5pm almost immediate service  Also if you're frequent gambler mailings Station casino rewards programs   you score some free eats e g  $45 coupons   If sign booth next door you'll see mean hopefully use your next visit   Also if you're shy eating whole $20 bowl food   just say you're sharing creations  They're totally okay that  yes beer wine ordered here  Last visit rid Gordon Biersch favor Kona Longboard awesome  Finally can't find place? Look line Asians here  Seriously   we know good seafood  'nuff said   Despite OJ debacle Palace Station Oyster Bar should overlooked your next off strip visit LV  wonder    if OJ ate here? Ask Dolly   she'll know  <EOR> This amazing!  ate late Thursday night waited 30 minutes   we lucky!  each combo Pan Roast which sight   seafood super fresh!  don't eat oysters but almost everyone sat down ordered them up   If oysters seems would your spot   Even if don't sure please crab shrimp lobster   Next time try Shrimp Lobster Fra Diavolo   Guy next looked great!

There no wait just walked bar  Ricardo chef cook buddy morning  He gave suggestion ordered Seafood Pan Roast along line Bisque but thicker Crab Lobster Shrimp   also ordered dozen Oysters Clams Mussels every single bite bomb    We've Oysters before hate when parts shell gets onto Oyster! But ones Oyster Bar just fresh clean! Ricardo quick open shell serve us  squeeze lemon shot Tobasco down smooth it'll leave wanting more  If didn't order other stuff probably would ordered another dozen   The clams mussels cooked own juices GR8! can't wrong order all! Jeff wanted just drink juice  much he liked it   As Pan Roast #1 heard few people say same thing  Good thing ordered it  good amount seafood which being cooked right front you  restaurants where cook back all contains lots soup base very little seafood meat  full just oysters order clams mussels but couldn't put down spoon because DEELLLIIICCCIIIOOOUUUSSSSS! didn't look touched bowl because take home rest portion   Service friendly great!

Okay probably still bummed u lost money but while you're eating   Oh Oyster Shooter also must try  definitely come back again bring friends    It may long wait since seats limited maybe less 20 literally strip bar but it'll worth it  <EOR> First off food poison place  Ive heard local saying place best gumbo pan roast not     well its just OKAY  place worth wait which just opposite some local people line  wife wait two hours 15 min  two seats 19 seats bar  system run business SUCKS! If enough seats your group dont skip your group would just wait until all available seats open you  service ladies kind rushing when order food bcuz its busy enough workers  chef only which very slow making your food which reason long wait lines  end every meal cooked washed pot wire brush green scotch brite pad right front bar foot front some point water splashed over counter pot broth use next even your drinks  dont know if food poison oyesters gumbo  Bottom line wasnt worth 2hr15 min wait  Its much cheaper going seafood restaurant   <EOR> Tried Bouillabaisse first time Oyster Bar trip amazing! might dish now on    Amazing oysters   so meaty clean  ended making trek twice!   Tip There's almost no wait when around 3pm  Any later line starts form  <EOR> Looooong line TINY oysters  $5 extra sharing?? We came some late night snack didn't wanna pay $5 just sharing bow entree just ordered oysters  But tiny very watery  waited line 30 plus minutes  worth come back   p s free bread gave tasted weird  <EOR> After reading all reviews decided head over oyster bar try combo pan roast   before lunch quickly seated twelve person bar   ordered combo pan roast really bisque cream brandy fish stock   lobster crab shrimp   All seafood de shelled   Being big bowl bisque pan roast really rich   accompanying rice really adds substantial meal   My friend chose  Bouillabaisse over Cioppino difference being former some lobster addition mussels clams fish Cioppino fish stock Bouillasbaisse very good seafood plentiful    My other friend gumbo colour dark brown   While seafood okra fine dish taste little unsual liking   Our recommendation bouillabaisse if want something lighter clean flavours pan roast something richer   Avoid gumbo  <EOR> Luckily showed right time didn't wait!  Sat down few beers watched made food which delicious  coming again soon  <EOR> I've hearing place finally decided check out  looking restaurant casino     Walking back forth just couldn't find it  Then realize omg full type restaurant   small little bar area middle if casino! There's limited seats maybe 15? hence long waiting wait    I tried raw oysters nothing special Pan Roast  wow pan roast yum!! Its big plate delicious sauce meats paired rice  big enough share bf!

Oysters Clam Chowder   * Don't forget ask your rice side  You'll thank later! <EOR> A friend ventured off strip restaurant she'd heard about  Curiously just little operation inside old school Palace Station casino  Although past 1am Monday morning 15 prized counter seats eyed greedily those sluggish queue  sloth chattiness those already eating did  auger well settled into file   There local ahead us she gossiped legendary meal which apparently eluded  yet beguiled  her many friends  anticipation justified restaurant's 'no sitting' policy hopefuls would observe wait service still going strong when finished meal hour ? later   Once seated each perused menu but opted star 'combo' dishes which pan fried seafood tomato sauce  then proceeded wait  and wait  absolutely knock staff  Just THREE men ran place    The Maitre D recorded served orders bussed dishes cashiered  Chef Derrick Brown whirlwind activity  oyster shucking sink grills pots full view customers clear workstation designed no motion wasted  shan't forget 'the other guy' kid dipped meager backroom doubtless contributing just much   And  as hungry were  we fascinated evident care and time involved cooking meal  treat watching Mr  Brown scrape first ingredient butter into row six roasting pot pans  Then he added unique mix proteins spice level each  When tomato cream finally added rich color oozed liquid's surface  knew then eat!  I 'palace combo' shrimp crab chicken andouille sausage  amazing dish ! point where almost overkill  Let explain  First all portion size some kind Vegas illusion we'd debated abandoned sharing single bowl  But meals seemed bottomless now understood why previous diners taken long  all else aside combos great value    Secondly amount meat and or fish ABSURD  didn't seem much while cooking but another magic trick right there  shrimp huge although both agreed weren't extraordinary otherwise  We'd recommend lobster crab andouille sausage shrimp in order     My friend perfectly happy heat level 4 but wished I'd gone notch lower  didn't want anything getting between delicious tomato broth wished slurp forever  sum don't shirk caveats review  MUST TASTE DISH  wonderful flavor simply exhaust you  <EOR> Come every time Vegas but last time  Since 24hrs its seems staff exhausted  used two cooks plus assistants running place now just cook assistant  means much longer wait times same food  last experience took 3 5hrs on Monday which involved 15min eating  No fault staff there's just enough them  ever running place decided focus profits instead customer satisfaction  place should expanded long time ago staff should increased decreased  Food still same but now former cooks opened own place more seating lots staff going instead waiting here  <EOR> Oyster Bar some best food Vegas  lobster pan roast AMAZING! serving sizes big  always leftovers  oysters fresh tasty but chef shucking them did shatter lot shell bits into meat     The only downside oyster bar wait during dinner  waited 1 5 hours seated just two us   would recommend going Oyster Bar more 3 people because seating very limited  However now OPEN 24 HOURS!!!! during off hours would assume seating would quicker  <EOR> We would probablu never come place Palace Station except reviews Yelp   great find!

must stop every time husband visit Las Vegas    If eat oysters clams try them half shell!!! <EOR> I talk pan roast when nowhere near Las Vegas    literally top five meal life   Palace Station way yes a 10 minute drive Strip while decent casino there's probably no other reason except pan roast   There wait most likely long   Even early afternoon hours post midnight most anytime day really 24 hour bar see full seating patrons   There's typically just two folks behind counter cook host cleans seats takes orders   Even though open seats occasion know when bandwidth take new people   stand tight just wait agonizing wait   Once seated enjoy sparse but tasty menu   There's lot interesting seafood stews gumbos jambalayas etoufee   Someday might try them   But quickly fall into same order dozen oysters combo pan roast shrimp crab lobster    oysters generally huge whet appetite   pan roast 0 10 heat 2 full seafood creamy rich which cut through scoop full rice side   warned comes piping mouth scalding hot   It always looks much food but can't bear see any part stew eaten   Then leave Vegas think next time again  <EOR> Food okay  used be  Service slow wait time 3 hours  <EOR> OMG! seriously best place anywhere  Las Vegas week ate 3 times  oysters superb everything else menu excellent   I only hope open near me  <EOR> This place only reason stop Palace over years  But no matter good chowder  no difference if seat order eat it   appears greedy owners only hire two people work entire operation  Over all rating poor based inability serve customers timely manner  Waiting line two hours something average person should do   employees try very hard work very hard but keep demand which clearly fault management greedy owners rule  <EOR> I give 4 5 stars almost 5  only knock wait no reservations  place highly coveted wait long  food still top knotch conversation best cajun style food Vegas  <EOR> Okay  really wanted love food place because of all wonderful raving reviews but just didn't  Waited line  for approximately hour before being seated bar but really wasn't bothered wait because majority reviews said the food worth it  Ordered half dozen oysters half shell thought just mediocre yes very meaty but missed the saltiness brine traditional east coast oysters  Ordered combo pan roast shrimp crab lobster just mediocre too   While found food just meh staff lovely and worked very hard please customers  Would come back to oyster bar again return visit vegas no but glad tried because would always wondered if I was missing otherwise  Now know missing out  Save your time money something else  <EOR> When Las Vegas stop don't miss!

I've back few times since first review  Each time disappointed  wait long but oh well sometimes life wonderful things worth waiting for   On recent trip Vegas arrived 930pm 7 people line  surveying situation very analytical friend stated he estimated wait 45 mins wasn't happy nor other 2 friends  told them worth convinced them give try  Little did know people ahead actually more people party wait hour   The lone cook same made meal previously but ordered he off duty Holloman took over  He passionate food btw  friend only didn't order combo ordered Shrimp Lobster Fra Di Ablo instead  Holloman explained he going put it basil tomatoes then told he going sexy dish  Ok little jealous   My other friend ordered ordered set spice level 5 since ordered 4  Telling he the man changed order 6 telling the man lol  Instead going 7 he copied me  Neither adventurous enough try 7    My friend's pasta very good good decided half share meal but caught mine ate almost everything before remembered share  Oh well next time    I can't say enough Holloman  He genuinely looked he passion cooking  enthusiasm pleasant watch  When he would put shrimp lobster pan roast he looked carefully chucked ones he didn't like  Despite being very busy he still personable engaging people counter  When he made something other pan roast he'd person ordered tell them he going put it  Thought nice touch   He making shrimp scampi according customer wanted indicated ticket  When he done he shook head said he wasn't happy but waiter told  customer wanted it  customer happened sitting next me  She's Hawaii btw now lives Vegas yea talk anyone lol  Anywho Holloman asked if he could some changes told he going do  She said sure when he placed dish front wished she friend could share  She thoroughly enjoyed told so    So yes even if read reviews talking long waits great oh well maybe off day  tell each every time food always very good never left disappointed  portions quite generous suggest sharing  couldn't finish all mine but did eat all seafood    Oh friends complained wait threatened better worth did admit worth it  it  Don't put off wait times  suggest going when Holloman there  He works 1030pm  <EOR> This worse oyster ever eaten Everything frozen unfresh Dont waste your money your time Your gonna disappointed  <EOR> It's good yes but worth 2 5 hours wait?  sure   pretty expensive get   bowl soup some seafood rice pasta   Servers sassy sarcastic you'll find they're because 18% 20% gratuity included automatically but may because party 7  <EOR> I started going Oyster Bar few years ago  Every time eat always rave OMG amazing friends family sure whoever also eaten does same    naturally place become exponentially popular few years ago! But its definitely worth wait! now its 24 hrs  I always #1  Alaskan Chowder The Alaskan Chowder New England clam chowder base lobster crab shrimp clams shell  Its basically clam chowder steroids!    probably sprinkle some crack too  addicting die for!  and #2  Pan Roast Combo The Combo Pan Roast only seafood no chicken sausage  think if meats changes flavor stew  consistency creamy rich full flavor  select your spicy level 1 10  don't dare past level 4  think most people spicy 5 its pretty spicy already   I always want order extra to go meal because just can't enough when town    but don't let you  Until next time Oyster Bar    see dreams! <EOR> 4 5  Let start off saying place LITERALLY bar 18 seats total MAYBE more if they're feeling generous  basically if you're coming group 5+ judging just kidding    but seriously     Despite size wait being off strip food AMAZING all little nuisances    We ordered clam chowder raw oysters combo pan roast lobster shrimp crab   clam chowder hearty did skimp clams potatoes all  Raw oysters good definitely tasted fresh  real winner however PAN ROAST  filling hearty! cup rice included pan roast but personally think tastes even better complimentary bread provide  bit pricey charge if you're sharing unless buy $18 worth appetizers but two even took believe worth price  also adjust spice level 1 10 even ask peppers side     Tip open 24 hours heard best time minimal wait around 8 9 a m  around 6 30 7 p m  wait 1 5 hours   If you're tired all buffets strip definitely tasty alternative! <EOR> chef Bob Master all Margie great feast   would describe delight all dishes amazing flavors but place personal secret    Couldn't more happy it  <EOR> Came again some awesome seafood stew! usual waiting 2 5 hours before food front us  want say worth wait but really hope add more seating more helpers maybe?

Probably but glad tried out  would come back if wait  <EOR> The food best sometimes hidden secret vegas would thought run down casino vegas such great food only maybe 15 20 seats only bar ! wait 2 3 hrs its peak but boy even if wait just taste heaven bowl    trust     I WILLLLL  But luckily today damn lucky only wait 15min! Unreal!

SHRIMP big good   Gumbo good hydrid good drank whole sauce    lol soup    Second item surprisingly good Bloody Mary !! don't even tomato juice lol but fallen love Bloody Mary lol <EOR> This place awesome every time in laws come into town wait line see order hottest meal  line sucks but food well worth it  food prepared right front only feed abut 10 people bar time depending long people take eat wait time determined  defiantly place should put your bucket list <EOR> I can't believe almost didn't try place    We gone Bacchanal night before more gotten oyster fix   We town watch Kings battle Avalanche MGM game ended going into shootout  Needless say pretty hungry point but didn't want eat anything would regret next morning  perused bookmarks boyfriend thought Oyster Bar most benign choice    First off place literally bar  maximum occupancy probably right 12 people  menu concise which helps efficiency turnover rate  third party line waited approximately 45 minutes  Let tell wait worthwhile  waited over 2 hours ciopino San Francisco cake walk    The bar really unique  2 chefs prepare everything front you  maybe 6 cooking stations big metal pots where cook dishes order  enjoy yummy smells all pots    The boyfriend started off half dozen raw oysters which shucked server  huge fresh according him  decided split ciopino  Split charges $5  serving size decent  could easily polished off own but late didn't want overstuff myself  option rice pasta? which thought little strange  politely declined both we also didn't see $5 split charge bill  may because skipped starch side? Once ciopino came understood why pasta option  soup portion hearty much pasta sauce  rich flavorful seafood cooked absolute perfection    I definitely back  I'd love try raw sampler platter stews  Those made tomato cream base smelled amazing when chef cooking front us  <EOR> Ordered Palace Pan cup clam chowder  Both delicious definitely worth wait line! <EOR> I'll learn read Yelp reviews before going foreign place  think buzzed that's reason sticking it person didn't really explain everything me  kinda did monkey see monkey thing   What pretty good it house gumbo shrimp crab lobster  option spicy you'd it scale 1 10  But creamy sauce think vodka pasta sauce  portion size LARGE two people could share it  ate could packe go  Only leave bus stop tired carrying around hoping someone less fortunate would come along eat it! Needless say later night wished I'd held it    I'm definitely going back gonna try mussles oysters hlaf shell bloody mary oyster shots! <EOR> Excellent food! dish rich spicy  service great  Meaning prompt friendly  lucked wait since only 5 6 groups front us  <EOR> This place worth wait    if handle standing ashtray over hour  <EOR> We abort first attempt eating Oyster Bar due line hungry wife  tried but line really moving quick  figured 10am Monday would better was  line shorter only 2 people ahead seated 5 10 minutes  pretty crazy line always but only 12 14 seats around bar type area  mentioned some renovations going done soon  Hopefully means expansion some more seating    We decided start off some raw oysters  probably biggest meatiest oysters ever had  think took guy 20 seconds open 12 oysters  Impressive! wife lobster allergy always little Russian roulette ordering seafood especially place where serve lobster  least cook everything front keep eye them  wife decides cioppino since no lobster  opted étouffée told guy leave lobster  No problem all dishes prepared order  spice levels wife chose 6 10 9 10  shy away 10 10 just case chef kicks extra notch  spice level mine just right plenty heat but no residual effects next day if know mean  Portion sizes generous if agree dish spice level could easily split any main bowl dishes  See pictures portion size    Great meal worth maybe 30 minute wait more might pushing it  guess line before hungry maybe your timing perfect your appetite peak seated  <EOR> Food amazing! Especially pan roast  specialty thats all order  other great dishes but nothing beats pan roast    Siting limited wait looooong depends time course  1 2 hours waiting time usual but if couple hours burn then worth wait  <EOR> Went tonight          Long Long wait almost 2 hours  Soup pan roast Great  bread terrible oysters just OK  would come back Pan Roast maybe try other things next time  <EOR> I come every time Vegas which quite often recommended many people  But really disappointed time  pan roast thick reminded very thick tomato bisque  friend ordered gumbo could mash potatoes tasted pure gravy  couple next very disappointed well  disappointment time  waited 2 hours hate say but returning  <EOR> LONG WAIT prepared!  Even Sunday night granted holiday weekend line 2 a m  finally left almost 7 a m !    Definitely order Combo Pan Roast Alaskan Clam Chowder those alone WORTH WAIT!  Ironically oysters okay succulent somewhat chewy but other dishes definitely compensated trip there     Would again?

Great chef Thanks EZ   Great Waitress good company next me! 945 only seat open!!! back Palace Station! <EOR> I almost didn't want write review place because don't want more people know but couldn't help myself  first time boyfriend very skeptical where he taking me  When bar handful people front us  didn't think much but 1 5 hours later finally sat down  point imagine little annoyed boyfriend making wait long starving but he assured worth wait   I don't say often but he right just kidding kinda ! started off dozen oysters telling chef long waited he probably hears lot he even threw couple extra oysters us! oysters huge! half size hand  tasted very fresh  no fishy taste   My boyfriend shared combo pan roast two sides rice  love first bite  first time trying pan roast didn't anything compare but terms just best dishes ever pretty there  comes generous amounts seafood  unless want take some home later big appetite think dish great sharing between two people  There's supposedly extra charge sharing but think since order oysters never see sharing fee show bill   This last time Sunday around 2 30 p m  well over 2 hour wait decided eat somewhere else  worth wait but when you're starving  back next day around 11 a m  only waited 30 minutes  noticed also same chef first time he hooked again! end meal he made oyster sandwich crackers which yummy  place wins food service!  I highly recommend going place next time you're Vegas want away all fancy restaurants strip  Warning must least 21 sit bar don't come large groups prepared wait line no matter time day  Once you're bar though order to go those couldn't  although anything else best when fresh  love Oyster Bar! <EOR> Just love place !

I counted 18 seats 21 over bar most likely you're going wait line maybe 20 30 min least  staff friendly food point    I always Combo Pan Roast  tasted Linguini Clams Jambalaya Bouill Roast    Definitely stop if you're headed Vegas  located Palace Station 24 hours!! said morning breakfast time around 9 10a when slow <EOR> The oysters good but cocktail sauce give just okay  oysters also slimy look feel it    The combo pan roast delicious though  highly recommend it  order split friend  <EOR> We waited almost hour sit famous bar around 2pm  light meal any means    felt blood pressure doubled salt cholesterol soared cream shellfish concoction gained 2 lbs just during lunch     Anyway said befor oysters aren't great    pj Clark's forum shops oyster fix during happy hour    We chowder which good   combo pan roast jambalaya  jambalaya salt fest woah!!  combo pan roast best but super heavy!! Maybe because familiar new Orleans cooking but don't understand why called pan roast when jambalaya seemed cooked same fashion but wasn't considered pan roast     The cooking contraption interesting  never seen anything that    Seems steam going through pipes cook food   chef busy guy!! <EOR> If choose dish last dish  Its would pan roast! place serves mean pan roast fresh oysters clams  haven't chance try everything menu  Every time am town always say order something different but waiting long lines then realize came pan roast  come vegas 4 times year  Which means enjoy pan roast 8 times year  Yes always try visit place twice when am town    Seating very limited 18 seats  open 24 hours  Don't bother sharing because charge sharing  place isn't best large groups its small dining area  <EOR> Worth 2 4 hr wait? Meh much   But tasty? sure!  Are best oysters town? really    Is all kinds different oysters menu? Nope  All offer oyster wise kind raw oyster  don't little forks lemon covers mignonette sauce  No oysters Rockefeller other items  definitely found little disappointing  But raw oysters most definitely fresh yum   They also offer raw clams cooked clams cooked mussels raw shrimp etc  also salads chowders various styles well various gumbos few other offerings   The main star actually pan roasts  large! Pro tip Don't say word share   charge $5 sharing  split plate charge but actual charge just trying share large item  But pan roasts unique yum  opted shrimp crab lobster  just lump crab actual good crab  But lobster good  flavor fabulous  choose spice level scale 1 10  love spicy things honestly couldn't handled more 5  rich full flavor  sure try these   The seating super limited  wait long  servers no hurry turnover seats even terms just clearing plates once someone left  cook fun friendly  other folks behind bar all   So sum pan roast some raw oysters  But wouldn't wait around hours eat again  Perhaps try some time middle night? <EOR> This place hidden gem   Every time Vegas point come by!  Very reasonable prices local legend well worth wait <EOR> If u come before 11 00am weekday most likely no waiting time  came 11 20 ended waiting half hour    Combo Pan Roast 5 5  best dish here  amazingly good hearty  Portions super big  U can't finish yourself suggest u share order another diff dish  BIG portions lobster shrimp crab      u need mix scoop rice else it'll salty itself  DELISH! $23 99 there's much seafood! No wonder place does incredibly well   Combo Gumbo Again big pieces seafood  also comes sausage okra  4 5  dish great itself but next pan roast only second best  Also $23 99  Totally worth it   Would come back?

YAY!  We ordered pan roast EACH suppose due frustration waiting just decided should order f*ckload because we're gonna doing very often  2 pan roasts 1 Alaskan chowder 1 gumbo  2 people   right   So obviously F**KING LOVED everything else wouldn't given 5 stars  pan roast AMAZING  ordered combo shrimp crab lobster 8 spicy scale which deliciously spicy  could've gone 9 10 probably would've bomb also  perfect rice  Damn seriously good            dunno else explain  Now why people wait damn long this   The Alaskan chowder       wow  No lie probably best chowder lol  filled just clams but SHRIMP LOBSTER CRAB?! mean come give other chowders chance! But no seriously blow them all water pun alert   tasty seriously loaded seafood    The gumbo also ridiculously tasty  personally LOVE gumbo might just new favorite  ordered 5 spicy scale wasn't spicy I'd but goood  definitely need rice also cos VERY    flavorful? lol  also filled much seafood lobster crab etc  sausages!  The best part dishes don't skimp seafood  little overwhelmed many FAT lobster pieces found! Totally worth they're charging   So obviously plenty leftovers eating them like    next 4 days think LOL  dude STILL extremely tasty  thought would sick but truly sad when no more left           <EOR> We lunch but 3 hour wait ended having early dinner ! never wait long anything ! worth though already thinking want order next time  Lol  Yes good  prices great amount seafood put you  If wait shorter would rate 5 stars sure  <EOR> Line sucks long even late night but pan roast worth it  <EOR> Still really good food  seems more people now going because other station Oyster bar closed renovation  Still worth wait  JJ Master Chef worked magic made exceptional Combo Pan Roast  always ate last drop  know place good when most people sit next locals  <EOR> I'm sure why place called oyster bar because oysters definitely highlight restaurant  serve type which bland just ok   advice     Skip oysters save your appetite soups   Because soups good! understand why people wait sometimes 3 hours favorite dish     I combo pan roast which consisted lots crab meat shrimp large chunks lobster  soup base best tomato bisque soups had  served scoop rice sourdough bread   spicy level 5 which perfect    I tasted gumbo which hubby ordered   Different flavor profile mine but packed lot strong flavors  He ate all said he would order again   My friend  bouillabaisse which loved except she ordered spicy level 8 which couldn't handle  She even regretted saying temperature heat spicy heat more she typically use to   My advice place 1 come least 2 hours before prime lunch dinner times start  Your wait might only hour hour half I arrived at10 30am seated 11 45am 2 try come large group 4 5 max because only few seats bar take while large group seated 3 careful order your soups more level 5 spice they use red cracked pepper habeneros spices 4 don't waste your time money oysters   Overall great food service  back next time Vegas! <EOR> The best combo pan roast ever!  Delicious oysters great clam chowder chefs all great   Worth hour more wait try avoid going 5pm when chefs switching wait longer   oysters bars other Station Casinos but tiny barstool venue place when crave spicy creamy goodness pan roast  <EOR> Really long wait  came Sunday night around 9 30 pm didn't seat till 10 50 pm come prepared something over hour    I Palace Pan Roast which delicious  Creamy hearty bowl came nice chunks seafood crab shrimp sausage which really hit spot  base stew just right combination tomato cream much either  Careful level spiciness though ordered 7 scale 1 10 even overpowered lot flavor   Don't bother caesar salad came overdressed although nice fat shrimp too   I did come once past midnight weekday able take seat immediately  linguine alla Vongole which lightly flavored pasta clams  good pick if don't want something seafoody  When wasn't busy found folks working behind bar polite attentive  <EOR> We late dinner really enjoyed oyster  <EOR> OMG loooove place  Every time am craving big bowl gumbo some  oysters  half shell gotta come place  practically line every time highly recommend getting early but food worth wait  consistent quality flavors always spot on  <EOR> The best oyster bar Vegas  eaten handful times never disappointed  always combination pan roast delicious  mouth watering just thinking it  If you're familiar pan roast its kind seafood stew buttery tomato sauce  never heard pan roast until tried let just say hooked first bite!  The only downfall place tiny bar seats 18 only means super long waits! last visit waited 45 minutes party 2 which isn't bad but sucks if you're hungry Let just say wait worth it  would wait hours just eat good  yourself favor try place! 5 stars sure! <EOR> Walked inside Palace Station did expect find restaurant merely consists bar situated right outside casino floor   Being such small establishment seating less 20 people time definitely see why everyone whines long wait   Fortunately opted nontraditional breakfast which turned great idea place completely empty around 7am   offer daily Moonlight Special 1am 9am $2 00 16oz Bud Light drafts $5 00 wines $8 99 1 2 dozen oysters wouldn't surprise if happened line early morning   thing don't understand why expand into bigger location considering big clientele is   least way focus customer service preserve such exceptional food quality   Speaking food everything quite tasty!!  ended ordering étouffée while she palace pan roast   Obviously seafood isn't fresh off boat morning but least actually cook front guests know serve hasn't simmering kitchen days   dish great Cajun flavors synonymous typical étouffée NoLa   seafood perfectly cooked rubbery all   also didn't skimp ingredients especially lobsters paying $22 bowl soup totally worth it!!  Overall Oyster Bar must visitors locals alike   Check place during off peak hours early mornings late nights avoid waiting long time just seated!!  Since they're open 24 7 would actually great ending long night debauchery especially Happy Hour being late  <EOR> Food 4 stars Service 3 stars Wait 1 star WARNING ONLY SEATINGS AVAILABLE BAR    ANYONE UNDER 21 ALLOWED   EVEN IF REQUESTING ALCHOL   We waited 1 1 2 9 30 pm Sunday night   place opens 24 hours between 1am 9am oysters $10 1 2 dozen  Ordered 1 2 dozen oysters $12 99   Clam chowder $4 99 Seafood gumbo  $24 99   determine level spiciness gumbo ranging  between 1 10   oysters freshly opened upon order watched open least 3 dozens within 15 minutes   super fresh chunky clam chowder creamy but overly buttery   filled clams   seafood gumbo enough amount heat level 5 did compromise freshness seafood herby spice Cajun taste gumbo   okra slimy crunch   show stopper watching chef prepares food right front your eyes   only draw back extensive wait  <EOR> Oyster Bar combo pan roast $24    discordant mish mash spiced odds ends 4 big shrimps thrown in    don't it?  What's great?  think costs 2 3 times should   Slightly odd slightly smirky server   Inside casino   thought slightly weird but then think whole Las Vegas scene weird  <EOR> Oh man love place! Oyster bar located palace station hotel  really odd times could potentially 2 3 hour wait  only 16 seats definitely recommend going clubbing super duper early morning   The pan roast amazing  Very creamy filling  order plus 2 scoops rice definitely serve 2 people  must order!  I would recommend skipping oysters  While good would save room pan roast shrimp lobster fra Diablo  <EOR> Really wanted love place according reviews     Once seated finally food total 2 hours   I pleased   Ordered Combo Pan Roast House Gumbo  flavor but both way salty!!  Might try again   but wouldn't way it  <EOR> This best Oyster Bar strip  nowhere else  Pan Roast Combo good option  everything  Size match price unlike SouthPoint Casino where amount small price pretty high  eat 2 good meal Palace Station location  Alaskan Clam Chowder second choice  Don't order regular clam chowder   Do Alaskan!  The 2 hours wait reason 4 stars lieu 5  need increase number seats  see 4 more  <EOR> 2 star experience Friday 2pm 10 people front party 2   1hr wait seats 17 chair bar 12ft slot machines  Really restaurant located casino floor next players club  Advice party more 4  Really just cook 1 waitress 6 pot cookers 17 people even seated 20 min wait until chow time  No menu during wait  Waiting middle casino floor carpet  Advise fooled short line 8 people  hour wait  !!!  Biggest advice   Pan combo excellent 5 star boullibaise tasty good sauce flavorful  Salad large portion dishes  Would return but really need carve 2 hours your day    Pluses open 24 hours but does slow down until 3am  No real specials except 1am 7am $10 oysters beer  Harrahs oyster bar real restaurant ample space nice decor good wait staff   cook doubles server provide good company service  Palace station would score higher favorite Harrahs but pathetic wait lack service borderline am busy would turn away 65% time if  craved good seafood  lack service limit small seating options cooking area   All shifts only cook best 2 waitresses      Kids under 21 allowed bar reads sign  <EOR> Oyster Bar bomb!! If any sort seafood Cajun style food MUST try place out    The line's usually long during peak hours hour+ wait anyone?? but worth it! bar very small only 18 seats wait everyone finish before seated  why wait long  open 24 7 would suggest coming random times 2am if want avoid line LOL  But keep mind need 21+ sit bar! no tables other seating basically 21+ even eat here  Unless to go   FOOD The fresh raw oysters HUGE!! never seen oysters big they're fresh too! pan roasts gumbo spiciness levels 1 10  Level 10 sweat balls only level includes habaneros  love spicy foods level 10 bit much me  definitely set your butthole fire afterwards guarantee that!

First off   I've 5 times last 6 months I might Vegas problem     only eaten 3 times during those 5 visits  Yes lines long hence why only 60% completion rate  But 60% time amazing every time  amazing   So let's skip food   the combo pan roast worthy praise  Seafood bisque serious attitude  Huge bowl goodness  spicy level 7 8 warm but nothing horrible  Adjust accordingly  also enjoyed oysters   huge delish   Truly amazing production team behind counter  Basically 2 folks  Maybe 3   bussing tables getting drinks  Getting apps  Then guy cooking 20 few stations all going full boil all times  keep track everything keep straight beyond me  Never down moment time   Only thing I'd change which some mentioned line system  no problem waiting seat  don't duped into waiting longer expected all parties should line  However  call only suggestion hallmark even better  try patient  amazing  <EOR> Although Palace Station little bit far strip several friends raved Oyster Bar inside casino  2 000+ yelp reviews just check out  Even 4am bar packed hungry patrons whole casino floor filled smell gumbo jambalaya  ordered mixed pan roast loved every bite it! $24 bowl I'd say best bang your buck long variety seafood  also ordered fresh oysters half shell which shipped Louisiana! very fresh delicious  definitely coming back next time town! 1 star because guy working rude friend gave extra bowl rice CHARGED $4 even though didn't order it! <EOR> 4 stars food  1 Star somewhat cringe worthy behavior chef    Advised tip weekday before between 6 am 10 am arrived 9 30 am Thursday  4 empty seats Oyster Bar which actually bar seat yourself at  waitress curt but prompt took care efficiency even if wasn't overly friendly    The fabled Combo Pan Roast did dissappoint    ordered mine crab lobster shrimp heat level 7   watch chef making your food special steel kettles prevent scorching stew  flavor would expect enormous amounts butter cream bucket shellfish infused Cajun spice   rich delicious satisfying  fact bowl probably enough two they charge fee if split bowl however      From understand anyone under 21 cannot seated because technically bar   leave kids home bring them takeout     Great seafood stew  Maybe best ever had   very rich though something eat frequently  imagine would very good if hungover  <EOR> Food great worth going off strip for  Only knocking star off because wait   Like many others said wait greatest  7 10 Tuesday night line 8 front wait hour roughly   Thankfully myself skip few others when seat open    Food combo pan roast level 5 spice   didn't taste spiciness all think people regularly eat spicy stuff higher   Food amazing  just wish more rice bread soak with   haha  Service waitstaff very friendly nothing but good things say  <EOR> With tons modern casinos hotels strip there's really no reason venture palace station  But within outdated casino wonderfully delightful seafood bar conveniently called oyster bar   I told quaint little location best friend before recent trip vegas even warned long lines waiting time  But say early possible because waiting time ridiculous  Here's example Monday night 1AM morning wasn't seated till 2 45AM  Yes Monday night  insane but worth wait  yelp reviews alone gives taste expect   So when wife finally seated shared dozen oysters  shucked oysters front eyes must say fresh delicious  just right amount horse radish hot sauce made perfect appetizers  then order what's clearly most popular dish pan roast  combination seafood appears very tomato bisque type soup definite taste Parmesan cheese  served scoop rice  presentation reminded gumbo  process alone tasty dish worth watching  chef entertains while cooking multiple dishes seems roasting stemming pot    With seating 10 12 people always wait but staff pleasant entertaining  feel home but definitely don't take shortcuts food  Since off strip place detour but telling g worth it  Despite being smoky outdated hotel oyster bar clearly shinning jewel location  guarantee always personal stop everytime Vegas  <EOR> Yes all above below reviews say all place mind blowing!

If could only pick or didn't want spend $50 both then would pan roast assuming  wasn't satisfy gumbo craving? Ok now address heat food! typically really spicy food but reviews made sound anything over 6 suicide! originally 7 but talking regular sitting next down 6 safe  6 barely noticed spicy think would fine going 7 higher  If type handle hot Indian heat Indian Thai restaurant handle hottest wings BWW then just fine  know fairly high tolerance heat but think even wife would fine 6 she typically much more mild do   So all all completely agree other reviews fact food service definitely warrant wait! Think way many waited over hour theme park 2 minute ride?!? least end line much more rewarding wait! <EOR> The pan roast amazing! accommodate spice level well 1 10 scale <EOR> This place amazing!!!!!

Take turns grab drink drink hand better buzzed least while waiting line because ain't going fun when sober when probably start complaining  Better drink buddies!  Ordered Seafood  bouillabaisse  gumbo enough share two wayyy good  Enjoyed watching them it  Fresh seafood cooked well seasoned well  ask spicy your food adjust your taste buds    Recommend oyster shooters raw oysters! Always ask kind because always different  Don't forget grab beer while it  cannot eat seafood without glass your favorite beer    Don't recommend group since just small bar area eat may wait longer  recommend coming middle night late night specials awesome! Clubbing late crave food more drinks? place but beware long lines  Cannot wait come back try late happy hour  <EOR> So dinner times even 2 3am  good 45 130 min  Always worth it  Let's over dishes    Keep mind gaint Pho bowl sizes  Easily share    Combo pan roast 9 10    Just great solid melody flavors  Seafood chowder 8 8 10   Just bomb seafood chowder  Never beating Irish tables seafood chowder back Oregon     Oysters 7 7 10  Just great oysters Louisiana  usually them most time order    Sausage Gumbo 5 10  Probably only bad thing menu  flavors just didnt simmer gumbo should  Now seafood might good  Never it  chefs really good here    Bouillabaisse 7 5 10 remember being really really amazing  When tried recently suace felt could diluted lil bit more  tomato flavor over powered lil bit  Still really delicious     Chowder 7 8 10  Solid chowder  Clams bit chewy  Meaning left pot long fresh  would guess first  But Alaskan Chowder pan roast options skipping chowder most time  <EOR> Maybe expecting much place when came    especially since yelp reviews indicate 4 5 stars!    but bit underwhelmed   Our wait only 25 minutes which great compared others experience we arrived 2 05 pm Friday afternoon chef bit grumpy never smiled never really talked anyone eating kept hearing sighing  haha   maybe he just needed break something   We ordered 1 Combo Pan Roast shrimp crab lobster fresh seafood sautéed Brandy Cream Tomato served steamed rice $21 99 I high hopes pan roast but OK overall  Flavors great soupy  Felt amount lobster shrimp very minimal though disappointed that  Maybe  Pan Roast? seafood content gumbo + diablo more pan roast sure why  We also ordered spice level 8 way hot lol  sweating bullets although husband enjoyed  spice level  Since shared entree gave 2 scoops rice separately in 2 separate bowls   I telling husband next time if come again wait long would order entree w more seafood content such shrimp lobster diablo! haha 2 Oysters half shell dozen $18 99 fresh good size but most amazingly fresh oysters had  shuck oysters right then place order  comes slices lemon cocktail sauce horseradish paste  served before your entrees come out  price perspective more worth buy dozen $18 99 instead half dozen $12 99   Service very limited just chef cooking everyone's meal waitress take orders bus bowls plates pour everyone's drinks etc  only 18 seats along bar too   Overall fun sit bar see cooking done but would probably only rate place 3 5 3 75 stars  thinking if tried shrimp lobster diablo next time may change mind upgrade stars  <EOR> One best comfort food !

Oops mean line? Crickets why? Because usually only there!   Don't expect 5pm blood rushing service  waiters usually tired may remind them if want water sometimes even let them know your food  done  Don't take personal    The oysters no means small! Even when asked whim tiny oysters   still heavyweights! If don't them big may face defeat! btw before 9am half dozen $10 Last pan roast still king! always take spice level 9 never fails perk sinuses! Nonetheless just delicious first time tried it! <EOR> This favorite oyster bar town   Good food service   just patience because there's usually 45 60 min wait <EOR> This place definitely lives hype WELL WORTH wait! Lines night usually 1 2 hour wait but if around 9 10 there's no line    Pan roast GOOD! creamy rich other places which good  They're skimpy toppings everything big! Shrimp crawfish   prefer getting linguini instead rice because feel rice porridge y  spice level 1 10 if you're into spicy suggest getting 8 because almost cried eating but still really good    Oysters darn fresh JUICY!!! see chef cut them fresh open right front your eyes  Half dozen $10! Best oysters ever had   Oyster bar definite must when visiting Vegas  Although wait might long promise well worth  eating places Ritters doesn't compare! <EOR> Planning trip Las Vegas?

Pan Roast very rich decadent   with all cream butter really tempered spice  fact thought Bouillabaisse tasted spicier Pan Roast  made own combination two since Pan Roast rich added some Bouillabaisse broth superb  enjoyed all assorted seafood rice came dishes  would definitely point come back if killer line  probably good thing live CA otherwise would broke gain 100# eating here   I am jelly DH back Vegas 2 weeks later without enjoying Cioppino time  mouth watering just thinking it  wonder if he'll bring home some Pan Roast take out   hmmm  <EOR> Open 24 7 except when show 11 30 they're closed nothing mentioned anywhere except sign right outside restaurant where late take $20 cab ride there   Thanks  <EOR> The only downside wait! waited 2 hours 12 people in front but crab pan roast very very delicious! also ordered gumbo spic level 4    heads pretty spicy!!!

Everyone works super friendly attentive  servers literally right front its easy attention when need something   Atmosphere  small restaurant  literally bar 12 seats casino  cook your order right front talk chef servers while watch them prepare your food  wait quite long because limited seating  party 4 waited 30 minutes seated  However  imagine rush hour wait really long  Definitely large parties   Food  food delicious  Especially if love seafood  thing Pan Roast  probably most popular thing eat  However since 3 other friends Pan Roast ordered Alaskan chowder clams cod crab served Manhattan Style You also New England   also able try Pan Roast friends  Both dishes great  Both generously filled seafood  Pan Roast nice creamy broth spicy kick  loved it! imagine would great food eat following night drinking    Oyster Bar delicious  good some friends returned second meal next day I ended Cut but definitely considered coming back well  Vegas just many good places eat! definitely back Oyster Bar next trip! <EOR> 5 star means REALLY REALLY good food  price service better pretty damn good too  big deal giving 5 stars but want explain  If want really good seafood going cost arm leg unless yourself  combo pan roast shrimp lobster crab really outstanding  even $5 sharing charge cares people!!! extra $2 pasta instead rice WELL WORTH money  probably something home but wont this  before consistent delicious  Substituting pasta instead rice THEE way go  completely transforms meal   The ceasar salad crisp cold very tasty   The wait  Oh boy  killer  first time waited little over hour  Despite LOVED pan roast  Instead being disappointed such long wait even better thought! Yesterdays' wait = 3 minutes!!! AWESOME! service Ok  table service  fine dining  ALL  But dont come that  dumpiest dump casino reeks clientele local drunks weirdos  But once take bite pan roast forget where are  savour every bite! <EOR> ** MUST GO list whenever am Vegas! **  PROS Best Pan Roast Las Vegas!  CONS Long Lines during peak dining hours  MY EXPERIENCE If read earlier review Buffet Bellagio might noticed stated while since AYCE location Las Vegas   OYSTER BAR located PALACE STATION reason why don't buffets anymore   same amount money something love cannot describe myself   try yourself   favorite chef Oyster Bar BOB   Remember    Oyster Bar only approximately 16 spots its counter   Don't Broiler the restaurant next it because doesn't serve same quality food Broiler   If during peak hours expect wait line 30 60 minutes   There plenty different dishes available Oyster Bar but always order following everytime visit 1 dozen raw Oyster Combo Pan Roast #7 shrimp crab meat lobster Bloody Mary Oyster Shooters  I tried House Gumbo before but think little salty me   Combo Roast tomato based sauce sweeter more liking     OVERALL I would literally drive Vegas just eat this   love Combo Roast!  If eat anything last meal earth definitely it! <EOR> The overall experience including 4 hour wait seats? gets 2 star me  certainly worth wait  Hardly anything if wait 4 hours long  don't why won't take names call when seat available  Isn't better if people chance wait blackjack table? just confuses me    having people line doesn't more money   Maybe ego thing     hey! all fools stand line 4 hours   Oh why put some chairs out?  The food 3 5 stars  Maybe pretty high standards oysters gumbos   Don't wrong food decent  But calling yourself the oyster bar when offering only 1 kind oyster and good kind sort calling your car dealership the car megastore when only selling kind car color    Corolla beige    Again Corolla bad car but just much more      mention sandy oysters?  So else did order? ordered Bouill Roast dirty chowder crab gumbo  three Bouill Roast wins hands down  tasty seafood fresh read between lines    shrimp frozen bag yes saw them dumping whole bags them into bowl   knows if lobster crabs also frozen?  When Vegas must better things waiting line 4 hours   case 10 30pm broke gambling table   glad finally tried place  But probably never again  <EOR> Is really worth all effort? really want wait 2+ hours some freaking expensive slightly above average Cajun food?  No seriously would recommend anyone come empty stomach 12 AM because probably die starvation while waiting line  Okay exaggeration but even tortoises move faster late night waiting line  Sure Oyster Bar stay open 24 7 but bar only hold approximate 18 customers time  left 30 minutes waiting because figured just come back again morning  There's Moonlight Specials 1 AM 9 AM pay $10 reg $13 99 1 2 dozen raw oysters   zzzzz sleeping time So good night sleep came back Palace Station Casino 9 AM guess no line all! Unfortunately only server taking everyone's orders food took more 45 minutes arrive  noticed almost everyone ordered pan roast only person ordered gumbo       ***  Cold Seafood Combination shrimp cocktail clams oysters $19 99 Good oysters but didn't red oysters much  High quality shrimps cocktail sauce contained horseradish [3 75 5]   House Gumbo creole soup made variety seafood okra andouille sausage served w steamed rice shrimp + crab + lobster $23 99 level 5 spiciness level just right  Good broth but worth trouble wait 1+ hour  [3 75 5]  ***  3 star mainly due lack staff long wait high price point  recommendation?  1 Come morning avoid dreadful waiting line  2 Consider getting pan roast instead gumbo   P S  $5 fee if want share plate   P P S  There's another Oyster Bar Harrah's Hotel Casino but open 24 7   P P P S Pike Place Chowder ranked 80th Yelp's Top 100 Places Eat 2016  <EOR> Off strip taxi there! Open 24 7 inside Palace Station Casino  recommend coming odd hours wait shorter  moonlight special which happy hour 1am 9am  $3 beer $5 wine $10 1 2 dozen oysters half shell    So 11 55pm Wednesday course all seats filled  Luckily second line behind group two girls  There's only 20 seats available bar style  took 10 minutes seated  also came last day  we woke 7am just before flight 10 45am  YES good! Luckily no line few open bar seats   Everyone knows wait long once reach bar you'll take your sweet time enjoying your meal  another factor why reallllly long wait!   Good thing place located inside casino even though old comparable Reno casinos   If more person your party person stay line while others gamble! p   So far tried    Combo Pan Roast $23 99 very fresh shrimp! Comes crab lobster scoop white rice    Lobster Pan Roast $21 99 my favorite lobster tender! Never lobster fresh  Comes scoop white rice    No joke smells AMAZING once sit down bar  smell fresh seafood creamy goodness kettles pan roast being cooked    They give warm sourdough bread roll snack while wait along bowl full butta! There's also whole tray different hot sauces pick from   You choose your level spiciness scale 1 10  tried level 8 10  Both kick but spicy  think only add more red pepper flakes  Add dashes Tabasco into your pan roast even more amazing!

Which awesome   What they're mainly known combo pan roast but Alaskan Clam Chowder  Though may sound truly basic but best chowder everrrrr! <EOR> i just 2 5 hour dinner 1 5 hr spent waiting crazy short but slow line! all because only 20 seats max  really size bar  usually when wait long line take ur time slowly enjoy your food talk chill afterwards ur waiting time worthwhile    I would've left because there's really nothing much around casino called Palace Station never heard before away strip super tiny place easily skip if don't see line  Good thing they're open 24 hrs now waiting 1 5 hrs wasn't bad cuz still see more people waiting another hr behind telling worth wait    i guess they're right dun think really die but think very good experience nice fresh food made order infront you  Service also very good worth wait    After debating wat order house gumbo combo pan roast which both very similar ingredients lobster crab shrimp   difference between all dishes sauce soup  pan roast much creamier sweeter  gumbo more salty strong taste cajun creole flavor  both served scoop white rice  both level 5 spiciness which medium spicy but didn't think spicy all should've 7 something    i personally liked house gumbo better even though most other reviews recommended pan roast  thought pan roast little creamy heavy almost made wanna throw up  despite food really good  see everything put pot u know exactly you're putting ur stomach  quality seafood really good shrimps big crab meat flooded soup actually see chunks lobster  if you're seafood lover you'll love place    I would definitely come back again but next time probably order cioppino  Overall everything good only if am health freak wouldn't eat because see everything put pot  eyes popped when saw BIG chuck gumbo base put each pot seriously bigger fist  But if just pretend u didn't see anything enjoy delicious food  <EOR> Went Oyster bar Tuesday 6pm  waited line 1 2 hour  The seating very limited  15 chairs Oyster Bar  I assume constantly line easily wait hour line  The night 1 cook 1 cashier  We ordered drink fresh oysters start  Oysters pretty good beer cold bread warm  About 30 minutes later food came  lobster roast plenty lobster good flavor other dish way much chicken enough seafood average  Normally would given them three but cook cashier really busting ass food shuck oysters serve drinks clean bar refills seat people  And doing smile  The supervisor  came around several times say them weeds kept going [What twit]  I think if another worker everything would excellent wouldn't rush everything constantly run ass off non stop  So many casinos really cutting back its really killing place  If employees slammed am right middle busting tail them  Not standing back some managers ignoring problem  <EOR> Oh goodness   i dozen clams half dozen oysters half shell  Oysters very fresh yummy  clams medium size cherry stone clams  very fresh sweet  also couple bites BF's gumbo  gumbo little salty taste but flavor good  definitely come back future when chance  <EOR> I believe three Oyster Bars Las Vegas right now   located Palace Station Casino   notorious long wait times because only 18 counter seats   finally chance dine 2 3 sisters mom!

They offer other selections such pasta traditional gumbo course oysters    Because limited seating gets very busy long line  arrived 10 00AM hoping avoid line no such luck  still waited 30 minutes  say only slow time 2AM 10AM plan accordingly    Check Oyster Bar Palace Station next time Las Vegas!

The server chef funny friendly  Loved food made hot fresh right before your eyes  given dinner rolls munch but told save dip food  ordered Palace Pan Roast Gumbo  favorite two pan roast packed shrimp chicken andouille sausage crab  gumbo good but good mama's place definitely hit spot  definitely return try étouffée  <EOR> Came Sunday Night knowing expect  boyfriend raving place wanted take dinner  Beware restaurant only seat 16 people might take while before seated  ended waiting 2 hours seated bar almost another hour food prepared cooked  if plan coming prepared endure long wait come odd hour avoid long line!  We ordered Raw Oysters Combo Pan Roast Lobster Crab Shrimp Seafood Gumbo  Raw Oysters delicious tasted really fresh  would say they're pretty comparable oysters Seattle  tasted fabulous fresh lemon juice marina sauce    The Pan Roast also DELICIOUS best yet  liked broth really creamy but didn't overpowering taste seafood  sauce addicting just couldn't enough  Good thing portions huge! also really generous seafood portions lobster cooked beautifully!  As Gumbo pass next time  gumbo just way salty ended getting tired few bites  didn't bother getting order because knew wasn't going able enjoy later    Overall food good but wouldn't say worth waiting 2 3 hours line for  would recommend trying place if you're able odd time  If you're trying during peak time then good luck sure wear some comfy shoes! <EOR> This great place great food but only come if lot time because wait long   Expect two hours wait time because only 10 seats   Food better expected  <EOR> I took girl first time luckily didn't long wait  ordering pan roast gumbo     her words were      SEX your mouth   Nuff said  <EOR> I hate despite rave reviews seafood Oyster Bar biggest talking point seems hours long wait  shown many times ready eat only frustrated long wait leaving myself  Well here's local tip recently discovered  If work night shifts myself bar work 6 am guaranteed spot counter  know sounds extreme but pan roast well worth even breakfast    If haven't yet combo pan roast try if love seafood  shrimp crab lobster  If you're more surf turf type person house pan roast more you  some reason scoop rice perfect addition seafood stew  If don't spicy don't anything above 5  highest level 10 actually tolerable good way but definitely won't scarfing down  Pass bread roll level staleness something even pan roast can't cover   Other reasons come during off hours include half dozen oysters $10 $3 beer until 9 am  If want enjoy benefits no wait you'll arrive before 8 am  time finished meal already line forming behind velvet ropes  <EOR> amazing food great local divey vibe   worth wait <EOR> Everyone ever Vegas told stop Oyster Bar try literally everyone  trip decided give try  small pretty much looks few tables counter other people waiting pretty massive line seat table    It took two hours reach seated  When did literally ordered entire world  just thought having come back maybe possibly getting full order just decided order lot different items    First oysters clams shrimp platter starters  variety which thought smart decision  Then ordered two different types meals pan roast all different seafood it  other called Alaskan chowder  Everything ordered your able change spicy level broth    Overall everything tasted good but sadly didn't finish soups  good though each boldness flavors plus texture good! would suggest eating just bowls adding possibly rice noodle your order    In end stuffed sure favorite meals Vegas  would say total experience worth wait waited in  <EOR> My group decided Vegas day early chose stay Palace Station because sister wanted introduce Oyster Bar   arrived Vegas around 3am starving then because skipped dinner would able eat   We able snag 4 seats right away   3am still people eating!  Because limited seating 15 seats hear wait 30 min hour long during lunch time peak hours   glad open 24 hours able avoid crowd   Food Clam Chowder Full fresh seafood great comfort food House Pan Roast Amazing flavors never tried before   Must have  Tip Portions huge   Share meal but don't ask them split there's extra charge splitting fee <EOR> Love pan roast! tried other dishes but pan roast best different kinds pan roast depending want type seafood meat etc would recommend trying combo pan roast palace pan roast  Pan roast also served rice    Also if 1am 9am 1 2 shell half dozen oysters $10! oysters good! miss sure order deal!   Service everyone super friendly efficient    Seating very limited roughly 15 seats lines long wait time  lucky past few visits waited less 20 minutes each time  However today holiday decided come 12 30am    didn't seated until 1 50am    Yes lines long BUT also      couple front suddenly four friends join them front line when reached front  understand all don't want waiting but wow really FOUR more people everyone waited over hour behind them? totally understand person saving spot TWO people but FOUR?

Nah    Line bit confusing bc there's some construction happening right hand side bar   so line swings left now  Tons ppl missed line tried jump into open seats when walking by  Repeatedly  bit awk once you're sat workers keep telling ppl wait line    Service standard  Nothing specular particularly bad    Food Shared dozen raw oysters another dozen raw clams  mere size oysters impressive but bit worried fishy they'd taste  pretty fishy      As clams fresher sweeter more bite them oysters  personal preference btw two  main seafood stew  Flavors point but seriously all seafood over cooked!! Whyyy  Esp shrimp  Pretty disappointing  Btw dish massive  Everyone looked ordering own but no finishing it  Totally shareable portions    Overall decent  shocked everyone giving such high reviews  glad tried but wouldn't come back  certainly wouldn't wait over hour! 3 stars <EOR> FINALLY   all years finally ventured try coveted Pan Roast   We came Friday night midnight so guess Saturday morning? around 13 people ahead line already   which actually became 18 because folks join later   wait ended being 2 hours   seated around 2am   I ordered bouill roast reading some reviews   stock full seafood!  much   husband friend each combo pan roast   Everything freaking delicious  Ricardo night   Dope dude   Pats fan   Since between 1am 9am half dozen oysters $10 share fresh     It good husband returned Sunday 10 45am   Once again around 13 15 line ahead which ended being closer 20   But came right when batch diners almost done time wait only   1hr45mins   My husband both opted same dishes   But time spicy level 7 versus 6 first time around    chef Bob Patriots hater    sure if just plain spicier bob more heavy handed but certainly more major kick other night   Nevertheless still delicious   The servers extremely nice courteous work very hard parties seated together if possible  manage work group seven patrons me!

When first Oyster Bar you'll probably suffer through hour long wait which spent trying see much food lucky bastards already seated left bowl then giving them stare death  But trust your patience rewarded!  A must order Pan Roast lobster  Its rich creamy tomato based dish full flavor chefs secret mix seasonings served spicy handle  dish should satisfy grown mans hunger split significant other lesser appetite  would order clam chowder good measure   I'm actually drafting review while line pass time avoid giving many dirty looks  yourself favor stop Palace Station your next Vegas trip!

Best place eat Vegas! <EOR> This total hole wall off radar random Oyster Bar Seafood eatery   However entertaining 'cooking show ' deliciously made to order dishes place good gets definitely some good eats! I'd thank boyfriend introducing place turn learned place buddy which word mouth chain further further back   multiple times since first visit enjoyed meals each time   Located inside Palace Station Hotel Casino thiis hotel off strip 15 North if you're coming strip exit Sahara left   You'll see hotel your left exit  classic example looks deceiving   hotel geared towards older more local crowd its very apparent take exterior building outdated small interior building outdated small     The times made plans eat gone super early    often first ones waiting line them open order guarantee large party seated without problem  During first visit group 8 since rest group know advised even before place opened  ****This eater set actual bar bar seating   Seating extremely limited no more 20 people being served   time ****   Once you're lucky enough grab coveted seat sit back enjoy show food   regards 'the show' chefs your dish right before your eyes isn't your typical 'boil some water throw some ingredients seasonings pot stove ' Instead unique contraptions all around bar I can't even begin explain set like    However its unique contraptions somehow transform simple ingredients into rustic meal both satisfying HUGE   Its quite show when chef s cooking away adding ingredients spices using all contraptions same time   roasts presented enormous white bowls large spoon dig right enjoy  Each time gone always think finish entire bowl but never quite ends happening   probably due side bread also give sop delicious stew     When boyfriend he orders shrimp roast combo roast includes lobster shrimp crab pasta  also shrimp combo roasts but rice I'm Filipino need daily fix rice! also tried house gumbo   already set eye trying cioppino bouillabaisse dishes future visits   Even if come large party server really good asking if we'd bill all tab split among different groups within party   dishes relatively cheap considering quality food undeniably fresh tasty    A definite 'must try' while Vegas! <EOR> After 1 5hr wait I'd say place overrated overpriced  $19 giant bowl person definitely can't finish  $5 split plate fee? C'mon     I ordered Combo Pan Roast while tasty mostly just giant bowl creamy thick tomato soup  Came scoop rice which definitely enough considering giant bowl soup  yourself favor ask another scoop rice  tried Domo's gumbo definitely preferred pan roast since more tangy flavor  Saw someone order ciaopinno made mental note order next time since looked more seafood came order pan roast  main gripe Combo pan roast supposed come shrimp crab lobster  shrimp but lobster crab harder spot since lobster came already shelled you'd dig around your bowl soup find lobster  first looked piece fish but when bit into seemed more lobster  crab comes shredded   so if don't finish your entire bowl thick ass soup end leaving precious morself crab   what waste!! want eat all crab!!!!!  Try come very EARLY very late because although counter seats 18 only 6 kettles cooking time which means other 12 people wait 20 miniutes before food even starts cooking  found hard way       On side note dealers Rio told South Point Casino also Oysters Bar lot more seating if ever decide back we'll check South Point's bar instead   PS While perusing menu asian fellow approached informed restaurant Boiler Chino HIlls offers similar kettle steamed gumbo fare  He mentioned he studied under executive Chef Oyster Bar  might good check if you're ever area    <EOR> The best must food destination when visit Las Vegas  Food great service staff best friendliest people Vegas  When visit its same routine   depending your group dozen oysters start seafood pan roast entree which highly recommend  When order ask spice level want 1 10 6 where money's some good heat right where enjoy your food sweating bullets  Anything above your own risk     One highly suggestion making your visit best some off hours your wait line short but when think 3 30 morning off hours wouldn't surprised if waited hour seated  when oyster bar usually breakfast! real breakfast! don't give damn! Food totally worth it! Hope enjoy  <EOR> Love love love food here!

The name place actually misleading because personally did enjoy raw oysters much did see many people ordering but crazy good food MORE made lackluster oysters!

Two words sum review PAN ROAST    Get pan roast  level 6 spicy which perfect   creamy flavorful packed full rich seafood ingredients  heavy delicious sleep sitting remainder night  also tried half dozen raw oysters which horrible but great suggest just skipping also cioppino which wasn't memorable either  seafood cioppino definitely fresh but overall bit heavy tomato base liking    thing liked cooked food right front could see all hard work sweat love seafood into your food    Beware wait though   took cab Palace Station around 11 30pm waited two hours seated  small place bar seating middle casino accommodates only 18 lucky folks time    which means put your time wait  time finished 3am delirious but deliriously stuffed pan roast    Conclusion Totally worth it  <EOR> love food   hit place every time vegas  unfortunately chef's older white dude bob crappy attitude    served twice he same nasty disposition each time just rude guy he should cook back leave hospitality those better attitudes  plus he's  pretty hard look top stank attitude  black chef Mr  Brown much more personable  <EOR> good food frush price fair <EOR> As local lives close Palace Station Oyster Bar once month and whenever town visitors     The food fantastic  tried nearly everything menu far best thing menu Combo Pan Roast  also almost always oysters half shell when visit  oysters always super fresh very reasonably priced  currently late night special where half dozen 8 99 full dozen 16 99 if remember correctly    The only negatives and they're big ones wait service  If during peak times weekend evenings expect wait hour line then another half hour your food getting seated  Basically place really popular 16 seats bar 2 overworked chefs often struggle keep orders    If during day Ricardo your chef you're treat  He's super friendly probably best oyster shucker ever seen  He definitely gets your food faster other chefs  <EOR> I used love restaurant but past experience never going back  wait long hour half which typical  But time cook had  NOPE! servers very nice  Everything pretty quick appetizers but watching main course being made    almost didn't eat it  But cost much waited long figured should suck up  cook EZ clean individual  He wiped hands apron LOT  Unlike servers he didn't use gloves when handling food  disgusting  standard? people okay this?

Why couldn't say when saw standing instead ignoring me  <EOR> I start off bad wait long line 1 2 hours lot seats  would say around 20 people   However place Palace Station would expect much  But awesome system 10 pots going once cleaning fast soup very very hot water   ordered boulibase took 20 minutes cook  stingy seafood lot crab fish scallops etc   raw oysters quite amazing clams too  Recommend getting both well   Understaffed long wait but definitely worth it  <EOR> SIMPLY INCREDIBLE! Worth wait  Great staff very personal  wife started dozen steamed clams which delicious   Then dozen raw oysters MMMMmmm  Then bouillabaisse wife Ciopinno   All prepared right before eyes   easily best meals some time   now when Vegas must visit Oyster Bar  <EOR> A holy cacophony flavors bursts every spoon full   big New England clam chowder but étouffée pan roast bouillabaisse gets 5 stars   Wait sux but worth experience   sure order extra go  The place needs bigger seating serving area  <EOR> Oh heavens! place such amazing little gem Las Vegas!

When finally sit down dozen still bar ready eat  Each pan roast dish made its own separate pot contraption linked gas source  did see main chef clean off below pots themselves which wondered because lots them boil over   The combo pan roast perfectly cooked white rice hey! Asian its important us shrimp crab lobster  u describe creamy tomatoey seafood goodness explodes your mouth? Part wait but majority taste! bite cousin could more pleased  Afterwards talked deliciousness long time   We share pan roast which normally $5 share price but also dozen oysters half shelf which waitress hostess explained would negate share price  oysters ok  chef character but good entertaining surely way  waitress awesome!

With three figure could all share   * Palace Pan Roast Served steamed white rice  $21 99 absolute favorite bunch   most flavor found myself hogging dish   Customers weren't kidding when said pan roast!  * House Gumbo A tasty Creole chowder made seafood gumbo file okra Andouille sausage   Served white rice  $19 49 gumbo pretty good chunky   But just craving flavors pan roast more    * Etouffee Shrimp crab lobster seasonings classic French Creole stew  $17 99 etouffe good well but compared others pan roast gumbo ranked higher   All all all good hearty fatty goodness!  Yes arrive large pho bowls large Vegas average size other places    think more generous person   technically didn't any leftovers because between three picked all good bits stuffed ourselves silly   Come appetite!

Next time ended   Little neck clam steamers $15 99 good but standard  Broth butter good though  Alaskan Chower $17 99 New England style crab lobster shrimp  very thick poured little clam broth made more preferred consistency me  If don't want gloopy some seafood broth into think garlic parsley butter enhanced it  Definitely favorites    We normally around same time night always Steve Ricardo take care good service every time  BF somehow magical timing last 3 times haven't wait all chair!!   Still favorite places we're planning try down all  menu  <EOR> The food amazing  gumbo loved it  Service could better waitress chef felt pretty cold  <EOR> Is over rated??? Maybe just bit but freshest Oysters!! Located inside Palace Station Casino  bar sits 12 15 people  No under 21 available  if kids sure send them room because along your wait time cooking eating food need minimum 1 1 2 2 hrs    Waiting line worst part!

Though put scoop rice pan roast prefer eating them side  always tell them want rice side  Its better think because rice soak all pan roast then gets thick nasty  also pasta noodles fettuccini its good also  But definitely prefer eating them rice over pasta  Oh know sharing fee $5 if share entree but sometimes see receipt sometimes not  dont know cross your fingers hope dont charge you? Haha  Another dish love place OYSTERS!! oysters fresh juicy big! arent fishy love eating them  probably eat 3 dozens myself!
