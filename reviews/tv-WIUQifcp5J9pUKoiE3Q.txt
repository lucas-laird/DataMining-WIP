If opportunity would recommend trying them  definitely dish would again but everyday else would heart attack and or wallet would empty because highly priced food trucks UNLV's campus    Also don't forget check Yelp because 20% off your order  <EOR> I groupon tried use today Said groupon expires tomorrow  told man window 'that should taken off while ago ' told didn't receive e mail informing groupon cancelled  He told 'well  groupon us ' responded 'well sucks ' No acknowledgement   really bad  food looks amazing I'd really try but based interaction  patronizing establishment  Sorry guys maybe should communicate your employees <EOR> It last day cousin's bachelorette weekend  Monday November 21 2016  just dropped off some friends airport wanted bite before 6 hour drive back home  looked place exactly craving  find course nothing there     I decide call number yelp guy answered saying closed  12pm Monday  First said Oh you're closed? But Yelp says open  Did your hours change? He answered rude tone open Mondays 11 10pm  thinking am wrong? Isn't 12pm?! replied but 12 Monday shouldn't open? He then said well closed early because having some issues  Again rude tone  So said ok hung up  upset! Also because hungry finally heart set place drove around looking way he spoke stupid didn't know hours he open  Also would've appreciated if he just apologized said something came he closed down  Then fine understand things happen but if you're going just state your hours when ask if you're open which should open rude tone then deserve horrible review    I never try recommend place because bad experience guy    Horrible customer service     REPLY CHRISTIAN G DRAGON GRILLE 1 31 2017 I checked before found truck which never did because wanted 20% ready but since never found unchecked it  wrote review decided check show did fact drive address listed Yelp    Also advise rely Yelp business hours but called your business phone number someone your business told SAME EXACT hours Yelp stated  wasn't only hours upset attitude assumption didn't understand hours operation  tell you're open Mondays 11am but time 12pm? Does sense? say business owners don't time update hours websites but obviously time reply so called fake review but still did update your hours    Your website says open @ 12 weekdays but 12  just time but rude person answered phone tone while answering customer's question  Even your tone horrible  clearly said did try your food  review based your horrible customer service accuracy business hours    I checked because address provided not  <EOR> Was really feeling white cream sauce rice bowl bulgogi Philly cheesesteak  Felt very fattening made feel sick  Wish told kind sauce when giving option  felt very rushed decision order  When asked substitute meats could it  don't see big deal  pricey quality food got  <EOR> Such good food  actually crave Korean Galbi Q Sauce use beef brisket  follow them wherever go  Wonderful people good food  Good combination! <EOR> I decided try to go dishes because don't see many food trucks around Vegas  tried Korean galbee absolutely delicious! custom sauce top galbee sauce just absolutely fantastic  going back ever since more  Definitely recommend  Also owners food trucks very lovely people    Howard <EOR> My chicken cooked all way  covered sauce didn't see it  thought myself weird texture pulled mouth  No should think while eating chicken  Uggggh! <EOR> Everything good awesome little place outside grand bazaar shops Great American Foodie pod <EOR> Kobe beef sliders super da danky dank!
