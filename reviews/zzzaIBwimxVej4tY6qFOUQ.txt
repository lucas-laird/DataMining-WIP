They're simply small enough bang your buck  place isn't bad all but much better alternative Canes  <EOR> The chicken fries excellent  Great special sauce   don't expect much fast food but know great service work service industry  service best EVER any drive through even compared finer dining establishments  absolutely no reason Guthries  <EOR> The chicken strip fries coleslaw ok  did sweet tea people working super friendly  really seemed care customers  would back just because that  <EOR> Guthrie's all main thing chicken strips  concise menu includes fried chicken strips grilled chicken strips sides toast fries cole slaw salad  chicken strip offerings include sandwich small large combo box varieties chicken strip buckets meals   I lunch had 1 Fried Chicken Strip Box $6 99 5 fried chicken strips 1 side crinkle cut fries 1 small cup cole slaw 1 small cup Guthrie's sauce 1 piece buttered toast  1 fried apple pie $0 99 1 medium fountain drink  Notes food cooked hot fresh ready to go heat rack  fried chicken strips lightly breaded crispy juicy  focus clearly chicken batter breading  toast surprisingly good thick cut crispy chewy buttery  found myself wishing more piece meal  crinkle cut fries cooked nicely crispy burnt soggy  cole slaw excellent although portion quite small  sauce pretty good almost variant spicy ranch type sauce  apple pie completely coated sugar cinnamon  good but very messy  amount cinnamon sugar coupled fried dough gave churro like flavor   Overall enjoyed quite bit  fond places focus doing thing really well Guthrie's kind place  don't know if salads grilled chicken strips any good but if you're mood staple chicken strips fries far worse Guthrie's  <EOR> Guthrie's great choice people fans service quality Raising Cane's!  practically everything Raising Cane's offer but cheaper price   pleasantly surprised quality chicken fingers sweet tea   should definitely check place out! <EOR> I'll start off great people service   Very friendly staff fast service   I found nothing meal rave about   chicken while good value bland coating crispy   Fries freshly cooked still limp   toast just don't ask   cole slaw taste but maybe vinegar more do   I tried Cane's but can't see going back Guthries again   food flavorful chicken fries which should some crispiness didn't  <EOR> Way overpriced $35 99 Family Meal tasteless grilled chicken fingers soft soggy fries bitter coleslaw said 4 servings but enough 2  Doesn't compare Cane's! Really even 1 Star  <EOR> Just Mary P  said its safe say if Raising Canes enjoy place  am sure bit whose style but 'em sure did because menus pretty much exact same   Chicken fingers except tons sauce options  Blue cheese buffalo spicy ranch wasabi cream  VERY unique options  Which why place tad better opinion  Fresh chicken  Sides decent  But else say?! amazing?

Service fast friendly     come back again    <EOR> It would safe say if Raisin' Cane's you'll Guthrie's  serve golden chicken fingers Guthrie sauce very similar Raisin' Cane's except its little bit thicker  similar combo deals come fries toast coleslaw   When pulled drive thru could tell person other end smile face  appreciate because uncommon pleasant person take your drive thru order fast food places  noticed no inside eating lobby assumed a order probably take while since they'll some fresh food b food come quickly because sitting around while taste fresh   It turned c none above  food came right away everything hot fresh  chicken fingers great themselves but offer variety sauces ranch buffalo along signature sauce  toast nice warm lots butter toasted side  theirs better Cane's  fries your standard crinkle cut varietal cole slaw just that  cole slaw  never found cole slaw anything spectacular anyhow  ordered Arnold Palmer drink good slightly floral taste it  think lemonade might made honey might explain something different taste  good unique  coming back more  <EOR> Very similar Canes   Sauce tastes same just bit stronger   Toast more slice bread buttered no tomorrow Fries way better Canes same crinkle cut style but dull Canes  Chicken nice juicy HOWEVER quite small liking may just box   Prices average around 7 8 bucks combo 5 fingers <EOR> Wonderful customer service! adored female cashier took order she extremely polite  prices good food! definitely back! <EOR> Last night run few errands passed Guthrie's   seeing decent reviews stopped some chicken   almost always check reviews before head into new restaurant   seen comparisons Rainin' Cane's which never but decided give try   ordered large chicken plate box course sweet tea   Being east coast hard turn down fried chicken sweet tea     The food all cooked order wait few minutes but food hot fresh when it   took food but couldn't resist eating drive home    Inside very clean girls taking orders running drive thru very friendly   best place compare Zaxby's  portion sizes generous plate enough leftovers today   Though unhealthy work extra hard gym today fried chicken french fries texas toast Guthrie's sauce worth every bite!  definitely back! <EOR> I fan fast food restaurant but last few months service very bad! charge everything chicken dipped  buffalo sauce dry extra lg drink asked sweat tea but regular tea! even ask nankins fork because don't anticipate needs  Wow! need look another place enjoy chicken finger! <EOR> Gutherie's ok  time time when am craving chicken strips because close house  food tastes ok quite similar Raising Cane's  sweet tea though reminds Grandmother's childhood  think amount chicken should more price  strips quite small  don't mind small but maybe add extra piece 2    Overall ok but nothing special  <EOR> Guthrie's recently replaced KFC near where live   first thought good bye good ridance KFC   really gone down hill lately   last night thought would try new place   anything KFC   necessarily good thing   really more Raising Canes   chicken fingers fries toast coleslaw   much else   fingers same Canes   sauce same Canes   fries salty making feel sick   brushing most salt off   coleslaw good   Perhaps best part meal coleslaw   toast good too   reminded toast used Sizzlers   prefer fluffy toast Canes though   Guthrie's bad place but wish price more reasonable   Almost $8 few fingers overly salted fries three bites coleslaw piece toast much   don't even sweet tea drink  <EOR> A coupon brought even though Pug groomed every week same center back since   Like Jade says original Cane's knock off    Comparing two Guthries gives more pieces money but thick Cane's   Both give crinkled fries but Cane's seems give little more your portion  Toast Cane's better  Guthrie's cole slaw seems better made home made better    I did service Guthrie's because served franchise owner's he wanted please    Guthrie's get's extra star because more varied menu consider healthier choices bring people diets health conscious    They really numbered Cane's need better job promoting themselves  attitude better Cane's  <EOR> I love salad fried chicken honey mustard dressing!  Not fan french fries cold slaw bread    chicken always fresh love sauce!! I more options Cane's     good salad good chicken sandwich  just fingers fries  <EOR> As driving back hote land noticed sign Guthrie's  Chicken sounded good stopped  no idea chain  Walking noticed big screen tv tuned ESPN nice touch  greeted cook few moments later order taken register lady  Food quickly  think Rasing Cane's fingers might smidge better but razor close  dipping sauce wonderful  hint garlic works chicken fries even Texas Toast  <EOR> I say place lot more Cane's BFG  chicken pretty juicy service pretty good  also nice unlike Cane's place actually sauces pick besides honey mustard disgusting thousand island sauce pepper paprika it    My only gripe place bathroom could used bit attention however manager owner not sure which took care restocking soon mentioned issue    I'm definitely going come back when town craving chicken  <EOR> The staff always very friendly! sweet tea amazing definitely favorite! food great! can't wrong if come <EOR> I really hoping able leave giving place 5 star rating but honestly LUCKY 3 stars  When entering greeted cashier didn't seem all thrilled there  Sadly  didn't catch name  When asked if kids meals he just replied back excited manner fact could choose between 5 piece box 3 piece box  decided two 5 piece boxes since two adults two kids  plate comes Strips Fries Coleslaw piece texas toast  price would say food alright  Personally chicken almost didn't even look white meat some strips batter very thin but does nice flavor its just tenders aren't all juicy  Cole Slaw tasted super gross but when walking back bathroom noticed Kraft Coleslaw containers  explained why fan hate Kraft Mayo lol cole slaw isn't much different  signature sauce   dip strips sauce almost close big mac type deal very strong pickle taste me   Mother did enjoy other hand but wasn't fan  charge  36 different sauces  ended having purchase another ranch visit helped  Alex she reason place bumped 3 stars because she friendly attentive seemed actually care experience   daughter apple pies didn't come order but once let Alex know she quick correct mistake gave big smile!  Overall still prefer Canes but if area looking some chicken place affordable offers way less wait then canes! <EOR> So Gutheries original since around since 1965 way before  Cane's more known locally but safe say if you'll probably this   The food almost identical but think Gutheries coleslaw better season fries I always order muddy water Arnold Palmer places them think theirs rather good  food hot when home indeed cooked order advertise   I see some reviews say other sauces house sauce but did see any menu? took off missed somehow  definitely something would better Canes if bored being able anything but house sauce    I'll probably back see those sauce choices  far though fast food bad since real food boxed premade stuff  <EOR>
