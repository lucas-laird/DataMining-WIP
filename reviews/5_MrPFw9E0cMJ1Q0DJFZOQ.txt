Then when she brought drinks she hit other guests while putting drink down did apologize  Then spilled someone else's drink all over lap purse again without apologizing now see personally am upset spilling accidents happen  But trick polite least some napkins   Then waited 30minutes food  said food wasn't bad  But when came time bills paid cash expecting change yes point expecting tip because again sometimes people just bad days she brings everyone else's change receipts  But does give mine when asked she mad rolled eyes stormed off brought back couple bills no recipt even right change amount  threw front me  point no leave good tip  kidding me?

Usually bartender would ask if want start tab close pay drink  don't know why annoyed but did  also literally watched cockroach scurry across floor which incredibly disturbing speaks volume cleanliness restaurant   I back  sure why even back first time  conveniently located if want bar hop LINQ but definitely think should find elsewhere  Try Yardhouse over high roller  <EOR> I actually love chain few multiple times Denver Phoenix stoked when found Vegas going open location  Unfortunately visit multiple times for delicious food which food still consistently good EVERY SINGLE TIME service INSANELY bad!! if waitresses servers never tried seriously  You'll sitting waiting them instead only them unfriendly careless  Don't tips pay bills? <EOR> I'm sure why place three stars because just first time fabulous time   Sara B server she absolutely wonderful    chicken tacos very tasty  There's ton TVs seems could great place watch game back <EOR> The chicken good  Staff attendant atmosphere exciting  Again very pretty waitresses  <EOR> This first time Tilted Kilt excited trying out  server very friendly   food took while come when did finally come only part table food   rest came 10 minutes later   food all right nothing special bit over priced   Several friends ordered spicy burgers wraps spicy all   don't know would back especially many other choices Vegas  <EOR> We arrived party 8 only wait 5 minutes busy night  servers did good job bringing drinks food also tasty   I would recommend remind your servers check ids before serving alcohol some looks 18  could believe server just asked old enough drink some looked 18    Maybe Vegas  <EOR> Good location but no outdoor patio area which would nice  Wanted Guinness burger but draft beer undrinkable Had metallic rusty aftertaste which might long lines running kegs which typically never cleaned serviced simply many beers tap which causes problems  any case ended having coke burger instead  Blue Cheese burger good hard burger?   would say skip run mill experience more interesting eateries Linq  <EOR> Love place watched college football food drinks  tv's every where girls school girl fits  easy eyes nice  Food really good well  <EOR> Unfortunately highly disappointed location  ordered chicken tender wrap go    sat bar 40 minutes waiting it  told would ready no time  Then when wrap finally missing togo silverware  wrap wrong when finally back room figure  <EOR> Located inside Linq Promenade  Great service  hostess nice server very attentive  came watch some March Madness game screen   The food good portions pretty big  Ordered some Blue Moon great conversation! <EOR> They place great service great looking girls  pretty much bar food everything tasted great drinks amazing   Enough screens keep everyone satisfied  <EOR> So just walked today   4 30pm   20 minutes ago came 4 girls door recommended bar since myself walked bar   sat 7 minutes only 5 other people bar two bartenders ignored   door asked seated table because bartender ignoring two other guys sat bar individually did    girl seated even though direct line sight three girls standing bar chatting each other ignored another eight minutes   three even walked around checked two tables vicinity drag already served but still ignored me   9 minutes being ignored table just left   4 30pm afternoon staff first floor outnumbered patrons yet couldn't even bothered acknowledge me   So across way Virgil's believe superior meal based past Kilt experiences Vegas! <EOR> Great service! girls friendly genuinely nice  food delicious  friends tried each appetizer menu absolute favorite boneless wings!

No thank you  barely any meat inside two flattened buns  just pulled plastic bag even care type any description   I throw steak skewers same category sliders  bad shouldn't waste time typing out  All need say beef bland way overcooked  Just awful   The fried mozzarella soft mushy crispy all  cheese already soft mushy having batter same way isn't very good   We ordered couple those Spring rolls which didn't eat but friends did so ever rip off well   The fries pretty good though  Nicely fried crisp well seasoned   The service okay  When server table she friendly helpful but  only when she table which often   Overall didn't care much food overpriced poorly portioned especially Happy Hour  service friendly but lacked attentiveness  don't plan return next visit  Sorry those short skirts crop tops push bras cleavage hanging won't come back  Plus gentlemen don't stare  <EOR> Wings ok great  Buddy said burger same goo great  Service mediocre best  waitress paid little attention ask extra napkins drinks several times  She more interested chatting co workers working table    ask bill twice  If going base your business average food eye candy then service better average food      It's hit miss going tilted kilt's various locations  miss back  <EOR> Cute spot watch game drink nachos wings other bar food    Plenty TV's around lots seating bar tables    Friendly service waitresses all dressed super cute  <EOR> I just ate horrible  bartender busy take order  husband call over  Finally drink but he forgot husbands drink  then ordered food  food burnt eat  bartender asked if wanted them replace but wasn't willing risk spit food  If such horrible food service spit your food  Don't eat drink there!
