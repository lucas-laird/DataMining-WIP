Thank you! <EOR> Reading over reviews submitted far Toros am baffled   Most yelpers rave wonderful food few exceptions thought food fine but pricey   couldn't disagree more camp   First food   fairly strict standard eating out Trader Joe's frozen entrees   Huh wha??  Lemme 'splain     while back discovered Trader Joe's offers remarkably good frozen food no good making everything scratch fresh ingredients but orders magnitude better any other frozen cuisine   sampling few dishes decided if restaurant wasn't noticeably better TJ's frozen just worth it    when decided never again eat likes Friday's Bennigan's Outback etc   Mind restaurant doesn't fancy   eat hot dog stand long serves really good dogs   Although Trader Joe's doesn't offer Spanish tapas pretty sure if did they'd helluva lot better menu Toros   Wow morass mediocrity   Started chicken saffron sauce braised oxtail   chicken no flavor just bland white meat chicken saffron sauce just tasted generic cream sauce straight some bottle   braised oxtail meat OK but sauce drowning off   If kept meat vegetables weird sauce OK   Then ordered bacon wrapped dates grilled asparagus seared salmon   bacon wrapped dates tasted awfully generic   don't know difference but b w dates Jaleo thousand times better   grilled asparagus aioli best dish night although  damning faint praise   seared salmon spinach garlic sauce nowhere nearly good whatever frozen salmon dish Trader Joe's   didn't realize garlic sauce until saw menu just now because tasted flavorless white cream sauce tasted same supposedly saffron cream sauce guessing Toros's saffron Yellow Dye #something    salmon overcooked therefore bit dry lacking flavor   spinach horribly salty   Finally dessert   Apparently Spanish version rice pudding rice pudding cinnamon sprinkled top   If you're craving rice pudding buy Costco Costco rice pudding worlds better stuff Toros   The atmosphere left somewhat annoyed   server bartender I ate bar very nice but bit annoying because instead asking things she kept asking Isn't everything just amazing?  Isn't food fantastic?  Don't just love it? No no HELL no   ordered glass sangria $6 cheap red wine mixed 7 lot ice   Toros also Nevada style pub which means video poker bar   most meal group playing machines quite raucous when celebrating every little win   criticizing them but prepared if eat here   The thing criticizing Toros prices   menu prices all very reasonable   50% off Groupon but even full price bill large quantity food ordered wouldn't come much   Also happy hour forget hours when lot items half price   If you're idea great steakhouse Outback great Italian Olive Garden then you'll probably love Toros   Me?  save money Jaleo   If opportunity eat 52 meals Toros same price 1 meal Jaleo I'd savor meal Jaleo enjoy heated Trader Joe's rest year  <EOR> Once again great night Toro's   bean dip tinga tacos chile reano sp amazing!

Wish Nashville! <EOR> So dinner   Having numerous tapas restaurants before knew expect basically small sharing portions   First FREEZING there   Half patrons still bundled wearing coats I being them    seated no where close door   Second music loud waiter missed some dishes guest table ordered   items ordered felt screaming repeat few times until clearly understood   Third waiter horrible and because he couldn't hear orders over music    When first entered fairly early dinner time   other folks sitting being waited on   us   Finally he arrived took drink orders   Then he disappeared   Drinks dropped off   Again he disappeared   Time passed he ran dropped off bread   Disappeared   time only table   20+ minutes he finally came food order   Disappeared   He only reappeared toss some food table   Finally able flag down ask more bread I wanted sop some yummy morsels left plate    Without asking he just grabbed plate told could clean one   whole point didn't want clean one   also pet peeve mine when waiter waitress touches plate without asking      point informed some food missing   longer wait at point place filling finally completed meal   Fourth Pricing   Again know tapas   But somehow prices did match all getting   Firstly located very family style community   another restaurant catty cornered one   understand concept although considered tavern constantly packed because family friendly prices atmosphere   Secondly personally don't think paying $8 'tempura artichoke hearts' when 3 pieces come plate barely mouthful each obviously used canned artichoke worth it   Overall despite pricing most food good  'sliced trio Chorizo' extremely greasy oily   'Bacon wrapped dates better   Bacon nearly burnt served over shredded lettuce made no sense no sauce  'Gambas con Arroz' price $8 worth it   only issue again canned mushrooms canned peas     At point think stick other tapas restaurants   feel much better value   dessert because couldn't take waiter anymore uncomfortable frozen music being loud couldn't conversation opted grocery store across parking lot  <EOR> Awesome staff food best!
