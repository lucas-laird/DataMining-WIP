Noticing rude gesture   20 minutes later another person brought dinners grandson received different dish he ordered explained he picked left table   Taking long time receive order he eating off plate busy day kids hungry   He received order 15 minutes three finished   Our drinks never filled never asked if everything okay   Shannon came table time all she said guess chef messed your order   asked check told coupon   She turned away rolling eyes again said sure never saw again   husband finally bar tender asked check   They busy again never asked refill if everything okay wanted dessert previously explained did   Being upset when home called Ron Manager store explain happened he said well things happen     literally speechless response   Did receive sorry anyone start finish  <EOR> I received $25 gift card Chili's  years since eaten why take family Sunday brunch? walked into Chili's 9501 W  Charleston today around 2 00 PM  wife 11 year old son 4 year old daughter  No greet but understood Sunday afternoon place jam packed more likely very busy  only ones waiting seated did seat comfortable booth within minutes wasn't really issue    We quickly noticed little tablets each table keep kids busy while food being prepared very impressed idea! 99¢ purchase unlimited usage during your visit which seemed fair  point everything seemed downhill  exaggerating but took 20 minutes anyone table  Again understand place busy but unacceptable  course four different employees pass classic someone minute  wanted another tablet both kids play when employee I did catch name passed stopped ask one  He said he'll bring over but ten minutes frustratedly grabbed another table myself!  The server finally arrived asked if ready order  nice apology waiting would sufficed frustration little bit but wasn't one  Regardless son ordered chicken quesadilla  beef enchiladas daughter wanted cheese quesadilla wife decided some southwestern chicken salad  Here's thing except some fish wife doesn't eat meat  She asked substitute chicken salmon instead  server said cannot that  asked why but she continued ask chef but don't think that  Both wife looked each other puzzled  eat very often once did issues having meat fish substitution anywhere  What's big deal? asked her  She said shrimp instead chicken but salmon  said thought said ask please that   my wife doesn't eat shrimp  also asked separate dish wife share salad daughter   The food arrived promptly original server but some arrogant guy wish would remembered name but didn't plan writing review  Guess what? substituted wife's dish requested  server or order taker made issue no reason whatsoever  no mistakes orders but did forget extra plate daughter  guy made facial gesture frustration which did appreciate  He returned very quickly small blue bowl completely dirty watermarks finger smudges! Disgusting! He left fast before say something before could ask refill refillable drinks  did catch original female server asked refills which she forgot bring until reminded while she passed table second time   Finally all food great  dishes tasted great except wife could barely eat salad since VERY SPICY let alone serve daughter! server knew intention ticked off both them failed say something! When wife guts complain guy server just stood quiet look yeah whatever didn't offer replacement even apology!
