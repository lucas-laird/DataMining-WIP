No eastern WS far    I decided Id Eastern Trop would cutoff   There use Super Burrito over its gone now learned hard way but still other Mexican joints around warranted sample   I decided Tacos Tizon dove in   This those places thats incredibly hard rate  it could fall between 2 4 stars depending your expectations your order   I Pastor tacos which weren't style all but some reason think order them again  Pastor done kinda Hawaiian style  flat long chunks meat which seasoned kinda pastily pastey? paste ish? paste sauce? which mediocre but somewhat saved thin slices pineapple  probably why order them again because little different  But end think its flavor thats really alley  need stay lane one  Just cook damn pork chop grill slap some flavor  Something tells none cooks theirs home paste pineapple combo   I also some Carne Asada tacos those come pinto beans  little better although needed some help salsa bar which while fully stocked came little shy hair your chest department    Soooo foodwise its average   But unfortunately theres more life just treating your tongue spice laughing fall Laker dynasty self inflicted food coma   Theres little thing called $$$$ which why place gets extra star me  board says tacos 1 28 which hell steal but some reason only charge 88 cents per  Which rediculous  always order six then charge 88 cent rate order two more  Im wierd that  1 28 taco Im just fine w 6 but 88 cents? feel Id losing money if didnt walk least 8   I dont know why charge amount nowhere board listed Monday first time happend wasnt Taco Tuesday madness anything that  40 cent Markdown Mondays ?
