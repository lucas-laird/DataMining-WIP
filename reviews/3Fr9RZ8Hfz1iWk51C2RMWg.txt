I'm sad give place low rating because pizza smelled really good  16 in  Boston Garden Pizza garlic knots  pizza well average best  Nothing special though   The garlic knots brought whole opinion place down  didn't look fresh  didn't taste fresh  ate chewy bad way    just appetizing all  Especially appetizer  Hehe! Yeah bad  Anyway definitely 25 dollars worth pizza  <EOR> Had Groupon large pizza wings garlic knots  Called pickup arrived restaurant 20 minutes later  told  place Ft  Apache Sahara Target shopping center but Ft Apache   walked wasn't greeted anyone asked two women hovering near cash register if worked there  replied yes but clocked in yet  Then more silence  told them pickup other woman apparently clocked but couldn't bother saying hello when walked in told pizza wasn't ready  took seat caught some basketball TV they few while waited    The guy making pizzas came over few minutes later handed order  He super friendly but some reason handing food freaked woman behind register  She hasn't paid! she yelled across room  Yeah hadn't  May something fact greeted silence when walked then again asked told food wasn't ready  Upon hearing yell some patrons nearby tables looked grab pizza run  wasn't  Seriously embarrassing    I walked over paid said thank pizza maker remained friendly then left    So far experience service horrible  far food wings tasty  breaded which didn't expect then fried then tossed sauce  Garlic knots slightly dry probably oven minute long  pizza half cheese half pepperoni huge  Big slices real east coast style  good  extraordinary    Will back? Highly unlikely  While pizza tasty wasn't exceptional definitely can't compensate poor service  If decide try place lets bring your own beer wine  <EOR> On East Coast idiotic race exists among pizza parlors advertise themselves having NY style pizza  hell does mean? Ever pizza NY? Most them greasy awful slivers dough crust minimal sauce much cheese cheese slides off mouth searing clumps  really something want mimic claim match   But West Las Vegas seem few pizza restaurants claiming pizza East Coast style  usually means thick doughy crust pizza handle eat thin doughy base pie  Add small layer sauce gooey cheese   So last night ordered large pie half plain half mushroom place called East Coast Pizza which claims Boston style pizza   Claims making specific East Coast city style pizza aside pizza pretty tasty  cheese wasn't slathered nasty clumps sauce plain but done well  All all bad pizza  unlike most East Coast pizza places mushrooms pizza fresh tasty instead nasty canned  <EOR>
