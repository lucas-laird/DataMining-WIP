Literally all soup chili last night tepid while Mac cheese downright cold   dined go   Yes could asked someone reheat but believe if your main dishes soup needs served hot first time quick stop home felt much effort   It's you   Goodbye  <EOR> This review delivery service  enjoy leaving office lunch but stay recently  decided use Panera app order online  online ordering system really easy use but need precise your order  first experience ordering online breeze received everything asked for  only downfall Mango smoothie ordered did taste completely blended  let moved on  then ordered online second time same exact order am sure happened but wasn't great  salad ordered loaded bacon bits which did order  Don't wrong time place bacon but am trying eat healthier having salad LOADED bacon bits wanted needed  second problem did receive Mango smoothie  Lost Star! called right away finally someone answered  explained happened woman told smoothie would way  Great!
