Everyone real nice food Bomb! fish tacos delicious even basic bean cheese burritos delicious   Thank Habaneros we'll see again soon! <EOR> To owner store your cashier alleges name Maria rudest people dealt with  placed $40 order Uber eats missed items ordered shrimp burrito  understand mistakes happen issue  issue comes worst customer service ever experienced someone when admired error  called asking solution she snapped telling want busy deal it  She did offer any solution but telling drive lazy asses store pick suck up  asked manager she told no! asked she treats customers ordered Uber eats convenience now entire meal messed member family missing out  response problem treat customers?!!!!! Another issue asked no beans several orders all came beans! <EOR> IT'S GOOD if you're looking slight upgrade Roberto's but anything amazing  Coming LA where Mexican food plenty delicious cheap always hard impartial I KNOW KNOW THOSE LA SNOBS AGAIN sorry sorry   wanted sample little bit menu ordered carne asada tacos rolled tacos carne asada fries  tacos good but hard mess street tacos 3 ingredients rolled tacos equal Roberto's fries just blah the toppings good but fries themselves tasted old     Would come back? If neighborhood wanted something quick  Would way? Probably not  If going way Mexican would Tacos el Gordo Frijoles Frescas  <EOR> This Mexican fast food should be  Good food good price  beats Roberto's tacos hands down    The restaurant setup think Wendy's but food think actual Mexican restaurant  very pleased visit here  back! <EOR> I won't back until stop frying all food Manteca Lard     tacos taste pig  unhealthy gross  <EOR> Back being delicious! 5 stars I'm literally addicted place  You've created monster lol <EOR> My lady taco fanatics always search great taco  place literally walking distance home decided give try leaving Home Depot  Unfortunately didn't chance order anything due staff even acknowledging upon walking in  two workers cutting tomatoes other occupied well  point communicated each other awkwardly stared brief moment but did serve us  really felt unwanted being lady interracial couple awkward just decided leave  see why place empty lol <EOR> I love place!  Maybe because right down street house because guys work always super friendly nice  But food always expect reasonably priced  Plus fact drive through freaking awesome <EOR> We seen place Yelp stopped dinner! ordered street chicken tacos beef tacos   food service awesome   He explained everything very helpful since first time there  salsa bar really good too  Try churros really fresh!  Definitely back! <EOR> I've eaten couple times now new overall favorite all fast quick casual Mexican places far best value however suspect raise prices once business picks up  $1 special tacos awesome deal! chicken soft taco just Del Taco's but way more chicken tastes fresher however prefer Del Taco's sauce over plain sour cream used one  chicken taco al carbon looked plain only onions no cilantro but once added some salsa salsa bar delicious! going back 2 tacos often  order taker thought also ordered ground beef soft taco  something would normally order but meat flavored well  only lettuce cheese it   My favorite Mexican dish chile relleno however hit miss  prepared very nicely! Normally fan red enchilada sauce them but pairs well! cheese enchilada #6 meal paired very good also  Rice beans standard    And lastly 5 rolled tacos w guacamole $3 75 deal! very similar Roberto's although Roberto's more generous w the toppings not Habaneros' skimpy may little tastier but definitely worth ordering  <EOR> What people talking about? adobada fries subpar tasted taco bell sauce  nevada burrito carne asada didnt taste all good  Service good fast though  Robertos better! <EOR> Congratulations Habaneros  decided take political stance against wash rag    Unfortunately others Robertos Tacos Las Mexicana open   I've issues few times orders which never corrected  Your solution pay again because language barrier  Now you're mixing business politics!  Bad business practices put companies business  <EOR> A great change pace typical taco spots town  sauces point along all go to menu items  Fresh authentic flavor win great price! <EOR> It's basically Roberto's few different menu items  Quality okay portions large prices pretty affordable  Unfortunately food somewhat lacking chile relleno lacked heat both pepper itself well sauce but liked wasn't overbattered ceviche tostada shrimp mixture seemed if hadn't marinated long enough but really fresh    One different menu item try #26 special  5 piece order rolled tacos topped lettuce tomato onion sour cream guac your choice meat  asada fries but taquitos instead fries  Definitely enough 2 3 people share   Drive thru service quick polite preferred green salsa red  menudo weekends  <EOR> Been couple times first time ordered 2 breakfast burritos good  lunch today ordered Carnitas chimichanga plate carne asada wet burrito  Very flavorful nice large portions costly  Food tastes home made beans light fluffy rice cooked perfectly  back! <EOR> Totally worth drive other side town come when want good Mexican food  twice am more satisfied  <EOR> I area needed grab quick lunch  ordered carne asada burrito plate horchata  carne asada good but cravable size smaller side price  rice bland beans mushy runny  wouldn't order rice beans again  <EOR> Love food prices! Staff friendly well! favorite part salsa bar!! If spicy Habanero salsa YUM! = <EOR> This perhaps best taco shop Vegas  Definitely come opposed other location Rainbow  portions huge staff extremely friendly  super burrito personal favorite adobada plate  <EOR> After few long hours shopping famished   Along way home husband pointed Habanero's  He said he wanted try off went    The establishment very clean when stepped foot inside cashier very helpful answered any questions had  Prices very reasonable portions big total meals three drinks only came $30  definitely step Roberto's    Item's ordered Fish burrito Carne asada burrito 2 carne asada tacos Chicken taquitos meal  The taquitos meal came side rice beans 5 taquitos which surprising because most establishments only include 3  topped off lettuce cheese guacamole  carne asada tacos served average sized tortilla instead typical small ones came topped tomatoes lettuce cilantro guacamole surprising well since most places charge extra guacamole  Carne asada burrito huge fish burrito  Downside use frozen fish sticks fish burrito  could taste them  only complaint  Overall everything good good flavor  good variety self serve salsa's well    Employees very nice came two small boys cashier put movie them watch meanwhile dined thank Habanero's! <EOR> So fan hole wall Mexican places but friend referred awful  made order wrong didn't it  Then another friend took hooked those shredded chicken tacos  am super picky only eat tacos if they're made certain way  Bryan nicest worker sure tacos always cooked right toppings like! probably won't able come anymore without Bryan  Thank making such great tacos awesome experience <EOR> I've driven past Habaneros hundreds times never given first second third thought but whim friend took lunch finally see all about  Habaneros pretty authentic Mexican fast food joint think more Roberto's Taco Bell     Nothing fancy crowded menu listed behind counter  sell all versions tacos burritos quesadillas everything between  Prices perhaps slightly higher Roberto's but meal 4 chicken tacos chicken quesadilla which comes guacamole sour cream around $15    I didn't sample tacos but quesadilla tasty didn't taste processed full meat enough left take home small snack later  guacamole wasn't good though runny tasteless  Eh can't win em all guess   I'd stop through if craving quick authentic Mexican meal doesn't break bank don't keep passing Habaneros by! <EOR> Amazing food amazing service amazing prices beats any other taco shop town   highly recommend Adobada fries! <EOR> I ordered 'Green Chile Pork' plate chili verde picture   chili verde  pork carnitas green sauce there's big difference  Fans slow cooked dish sorely disappointed    Oh let's talk green beans rice peas carrots brother law's burrito which actually advertised chili verde burrito  sorry    since when cool just sneak some mushy frozen dinner quality veg into chili verde?   The refried beans zero taste  Disappointing  paste   I few shrimp tacos side didn't suck but buy few more just seem dinner wasn't complete waste time    Now heading Del Taco churro shake because don't any interest seeing Habaneros Taco Grill ruins churros    I'm going stick going Roberto's  Should just tonight  Sad didn't  <EOR> I tried adobada fries carne asada taco al pastor taco  Comparing authentic taco stands even Tacos El Gordo  food poor  adobada al pastor wasn't good  tacos tasty  Maybe because high standards good taco  <EOR> Big fan 4 times just over month  superb value masterful in house habanero salsa fresh salsa bar truly food! packs heat but extreme amount  Easily best balanced habanero salsas tasted   Their proteins average but lean building appears ex TacoBell usually radio Telemundo Minions movie all same time but if handle all habanero salsa should win over  restaurant clean well kept  Service always friendly   Their everyday 3 $5 al carbon tacos deal reliable well $1 chicken tacos special  long you're down liberal dousings habanero salsa should enjoy place! <EOR> Actually fast food very good authentic   I've ate few times already enjoy much more Robertos  <EOR> I opted adobada fries everyday special under $7 some deliciously crisped fries topped guacamole cheese tender carne adobada  habanero salsa gave Mexican run money  pretty legit  definitely try again but now scored home run! <EOR> The best tacos long time  robertos Faustos taste taco bell <EOR> I love place  Food reminds being back San Diego    But five seven trips said no guac every time there    Aside enjoyed food  <EOR> I didn't food very much  guacamole very runny burritos nothing special  thought would good based reviews here  Roberto's waaaaay better  No contest  <EOR> If Taco Bell did everything better you'd get  more authentic Mexican soft drinks food comes larger portions noticeably better quality  No good Mexican restaurant complete solid condiment bar find pico spicy carrot radishes well few sauces ranging mild hot  get?
