Le restaurant se trouve dans le Mirage et comme c'est là que je logeais choisit la solution de facilité Les hamburger sont ultra bons il en existe de nombreux différents y compris un hamburger fallafel pour les végétariens où ceux qui font attention à leur ligne Le tout servi avec des frites en suffisance     La cuisine est en cercle au fond du resaurant à la vue de tout le monde  Trois quatre cuistots y sont en permanence et il y des grosses flammes qui s'échappent des cuisinières    Un show en soi !  Il est d'ailleurs possible de prendre plusieurs formules notamment avec boissons à volonté ou bien avec milkshake un peu lourd pour manger en même temps    L'endroit est souvent bien rempli et il y toujours une file d'attente devant la porte    Mais en y regardant mieux il y toujours des tables libres aussi    donc la bonne vieille technique de réduire l'offre pour augmenter la demande fonctionne toujours aussi bien    Sacré Steve Jobs <EOR> This place great burgers  Super juicy made order  bacon blue cheese onion burger each time  onion rings pretty tasty well  I'd stay away sweet potato fries    far better ones other places   They only receive three star due price  They're basically fast food joint    but expect pay more $20  good deal   Enjoy food enjoy raping your wallet  <EOR> I freakin' love place!

Reading reviews seeing many complaining wasn't romantic setting  burger place  course romantic   There little bit wait order seated   okay though when sat down waitress pretty attentive  She knowledgeable menu patient friend didn't want milkshake until he finished eating burger    The only downside pricey  burgers standard burgers then wind paying $20 drink fries burger  guess  happens when put burger place Mirage but still    Probably won't come back  next time Vegas place probably replaced something new  <EOR> Overrated boring overpriced   Other all awesome!

Price would expect strip  <EOR> I've twice now let down both times  burgers juicy you watch cooks press down burgers grill don't think could pull off medium rare save lives both times ended medium well Will give 3rd chance <EOR> Burgers galore menu certainly offer some tasty combos but end day expect more Vegas  Spending $14 burger norm apparently days but said Vegas burger should over top delicious indulgent  good amazing yet somewhat satisfying  wouldn't race back spot but definitely conveniently located hangover meal if you're staying Mirage  food average but service great! <EOR> The burgers decent portion size   very filling considering burgers range $11 13   really liked salmon burger fish wasn't dried out  well sweet potato fries   also variety milk shake options which tempted try but refrained it    Not bad place especially when just randomly stumbled upon it  Loved open kitchen! <EOR> This place bit surprise me  couldn't help but think ANOTHER burger bar Vegas  First off they've great beer mixed drink 'adult' shake selection  beer guy don't think there's much improve it  Boy wrong again  Blue Moon float orange ice cream  Anyone likes wheat beer knows great orange wedge it  Combining beer orange ice cream brilliant   The fries awesome here  skinny fat fries  fat fries KFC potato wedges old  Not sure if KFC still serves them because haven't solid decade  Crispy delicious  little thinner KFC  also offer multiple dipping sauces no extra charge  love condiments   Burgers course also very good  While cooked way would 100% prefer char broiled BBQ grilled still quite good  ordered mine medium rare done perfect  both BLT blue cheese burger two separate days  Both excellent    One day big hurry way out  appreciate that  Service friendly helpful both days  music little loud but huge fan music playing mostly classic rock yuck  But did little hard conversation restaurant  could understand bar  Prices reasonable although burgers include fries  Typical Vegas pricing say least  Anyway highly recommend place plan return  <EOR> I ordered some stuff go  Decided Kobe Burger trio appetizer Lamb burger Classic place seemed busy told food would ready 30 40 minutes  since am casino better way kill time play some Blackjack! Well thanks burger ended costing $200 haha  Oh well but least food tasted good  Would definitely suggest Kobe trio appetizer but lamb burger wasn't great sauce little funky unpleasing palate  <EOR> Lamb Burger = AWESOME!

BLT Burger may seem your typical burgers fries milkshake spot buuuuuut really isn't  burgers shakes pretty fancy schmancy yet reasonably priced different variations offered depending ingredients used   Seating plenty there's even bar where watch multiple TVs watch cooks cook build your burger   My favorite 'burger' Salmon $14 consisting Atlantic Salmon Avocado Red Onion Watercress Zesty Cayenne Tartar Sauce  Mine boyfriend's favorite milkshake Nut Job $7 hence boyfriend asking waitress Nut Job! made Vanilla Ice Cream Nutella Slivered Almonds  OMG all yummy goodness!  During weekend stay Vegas ate 3 times!!!  ordered different burger each time but aside Salmon can't remember other ones must've made much impression    fries burgers come fries boyfriend shared which good since burgers pretty hefty   skinny fat waffle fries preferred waffle fries    Needless say strung burgers fries 3rd time but still couldn't enough Nut Job  Before leaving Vegas boyfriend craving Nut Job took go   If happen come BLT Nut Job amazeballs! LOL  <EOR> Two words HAPPY HOUR  Vegas what's cure long night drinking clubbing? Greasy delicious cheap foods! stayed Mirage where place located two nights row clubbing heavy drinking friends stopped both days catch half off happy hour foods    First off staff friendly really accommodating especially some friends couldn't handle alcohol well 7 seated within few minutes waters already poured placed around table  less $30 both nights really large spread order nachos two boneless wings two brisket sliders order fries all under $30! yes enough feed all 7 us    Late night happy hour 11pm 3am there's other options such fried pickles popcorn shrimp but would say brisket sliders really tender filling really well cure alcohol systems  fries covered ranch bbq mix sauce could've tasted more amazing because most inebriated but simply just flavorful! wings alright nothing special hard chicken nuggets simply over bbq sauced    Overall great place stop post clubbing snack especially cheap prices! However only downside check paid ignored something felt little unprofessional friends buzzing still but weren't obnoxious point where you'd ignore requests water even possibility order more food  sorry but explains why good things say food but service also important factor restaurant business feel shouldn't ignored especially place Las Vegas  <EOR> I really enjoy BLT Steak DC just its steaks but also its seafood dishes I would've considered dining steakhouse purposely eating main course other steak blasphemous   until coerced into doing BLT night excited try group's burger offerings    Considering its location don't any gripes price $35 burger shake milkshake restaurant certainly provided great meal  service fast food delicious decor ambience appealing  Everything positive experience why and probably many others enjoy gourmet burgers   I took star off overly businesslike feel service but perhaps  harsh  all host waitstaff all pleasant professional but still everything felt little impersonal taste  4 5 stars! <EOR> my trip vegas slew different burgers    came having visited love burgers palazzo    blt burger alright book  menu seemed some appealing options but none could decide on  debated between lamb burger falafel burger  lamb burger came olives cucumbers being fan decided should just falafel    not mention waitress pretty unhelpful making suggestions  when both friend asked recommendation she would just say just depends like! well course does guess but we're asking least half assed fake most people order very least  meh    the falafel burger sure enough came very large falafel patty which couldn't finish all  HELLA falafel all saying  good falafel but LOTS falafel  almost overdose falafel  enjoyed but wished patty might thinner something    hm  perhaps  just me   also ordered sweet potato fries which good any sweet potato fries book  if back time might want try waffle fries just because haven't waffle fries long time    blt burger fine  don't think must have vegas but if crunch if mirage then also bad option  <EOR> This review solely experience milkshake = going just straight point!

We fourth meal around 11 PM during middle week   originally wanted California Pizza Kitchen which next door but closed   four although probably thought awesome sure obnoxious   kudos waiter being friendly attentive putting awesome jokes      We ordered waters shared Night Rider spiked shake   magical concoction Kahlua Chocolate Liqueur Oreos Chocolate Ice Cream   could easily sugar overload glad all shared it   also ordered fried pickles appetizer delicious   used fried pickles just having slight breading them but almost fluffy breading very tasty   ordered American Wagyu burger portabello spinach truffle aioli sweet potato fries  burger cooked perfectly but just underwhelming compared pickles fries shake    ended taking toppings off just eating bun patty   others ordered breakfast sandwiches kobe beef sliders which all enjoyed   think bill came just over $100 four people which isn't bad Vegas     They weren't busy late pretty good seats close bar wasn't loud all well except us   <EOR> So pricier N but did expect? Just look establishment know you're buy two cheeseburgers $1  menu right front restaurant should peep before your decision  If much burger then directly across street McDonald's   Our waiter ball  never ask refill soda  He would bring new glass before made funny noise through straw when there's no more drink left cup glass  He didn't just once but twice without saying word  He repeatedly checked us  example service Vegas should like  don't want send anyone home loser  Least stripping kid's college fund taking home's mortgage give them good service them feel somewhat better themselves   I tempted try kobe beef burger $17  However just combo soda classic burger fries which much less but did come soda fries  substituted regular fries sweet potato fries which problem all  sucker sweet potato fries  alright here    My classic burger made just right  Medium slight pink middle  Tender meat all condiments toppings complimenting another  All sided pickled cucumber which usually fan but together every burger bite  Wash down tasty beverage everything plays a perfect harmony   My cousins ordered chocolate milkshake share  shake looks 1000 calories drink massive no joke put picture soon   Between two girls even able finish it  Maybe sweet blood  more full dessert drink   Our tab three people came $40ish probably close $50 put down tip because thought waiter deserved it  Pricey but pretty darn good burger much burger person myself  Once while joint isn't bad idea  eating $15 burgers daily anyways  Besides you're Vegas live little   Throughout course meal lot classic 80's jams on  No complaints never tired musical selection   Last note believe close late because friends dined hitting clubs  <EOR> My husband wanted try place  going play safe know but end lamb burger wasn't disappointed   A messy burger always best messy deliciousness  waffle fries perfect greasy soggy but crispy perfectly seasoned  ended milk shake which also yummy!
