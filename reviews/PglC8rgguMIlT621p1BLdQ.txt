Trust should give try even though looked super big  Across states believe custard buns above 95 percentile  Don't scared huge size baked lava buns don't lose interest boring appearance steamed buns really really amazing!  The shrimps dumplings across all kinds okay guess just pick ones based stuffings like   The rice noodles super disappointing  least ones tried day fresh stuffing shrimp beef super small  few could confidently say don't all even though rice noodle person  It seems even if finish your meal 30 minutes won't even rush check if off peak hours  However kinda busy could wait anymore bar bill    <EOR> Yum Cha new go to dim sum spot   several dim sum restaurants around Vegas inside outside Chinatown place won over     I greeted owner he took time explain carts run 10 3 but also food counter order menu   outstanding food 3 different ways 2 ways 3PM when carts stop    All common dim sum goods gotten off carts but those items all also menu most rest friends think available menu counter     In addition owner service attentive friendly   cart runners made table every few minutes waiter checked regularly drinks other matters   food displayed counter show ask made order     Dim Sum tea staple circle friends many establishments serving type cuisine Las Vegas other major cities   Yum Cha any other place new cornerstone  <EOR> my Only place eat Dim Sum even week day! place modern very clean  love little suspended bird cages  reminds Singapore  Dim Sum Dim Sum right? only difference between others place modern spacious clean no stinky carpet   staff very pleasant friendly   i little mango coconut flan gello caramel sauce  very light both flavor <EOR> My friends always Rio Dim Sum fix usually hit miss  glad found Yum Cha serves Dim Sum pretty much whole day    We greeted hostess immediately when entered seated immediately group 11 no problem  given menus water tea all around  Looking around establishment clean well maintained  TV's all around displaying different channels large TV displaying Asian seafood show all mute wouldn't disruptive   Food We ordered ALOT food  server great  She remembered everything ordered except 1 dish without writing anything down    all ordered minimum 20 dishes   impressive    My party ordered typical dishes most Dim Sum spots see pictures video Everything pretty much delicious really no complaints any thing except jellyfish usually favorite   Jellyfish prepared very differently used being dry style compared being served sesame oil type base  probably speak rest party most dishes pretty good since didn't leave much left over jellyfish little piece taro     The only dish didn't come porridge  But time done meal didn't even want because full  bill asked if charged porridge said no didn't    End food review  The establishment very clean staff friendly attentive  Just nice Dim Sum restaurant near strip  <EOR> Last minute drive favorite Dim Sum Spot  brought son before he heads off college  Always great service!

Nothing spectacular traditional dim sum plates either  said mediocre best  Har gow har gow  just taste your mouth but prob won't hit your dim sum crave  baked bbq pork bun came two decent sized buns  gloss sticky little filling vs bun  Sad    Winner whole experience lava custard pineapple bun  closest thing found! bigger puff almost muffin looking but runny oozy custard totally point  Probably only reason would back place just dish    Overall disappointed  Three stars because food okay service good price little high  But back just those custard lava buns  If anyone knows where else try let know! <EOR> There aren't many options dim sum Vegas but place satisfies dim sum craving  Before coming read yelp reviews many people said place friendly  totally right service warm welcoming  Jack came dinner no carts being pushed around  just ordered things wanted brought over  dim sum good  fried egg plant pretty delicious hadn't anything before  fried pork bun which fav dim sum dishes  Good dim sum clean restaurant friendly people inexpensive great job <EOR> Food good but service sucks!!

Fresh very authentic Cantonese dim sum  definitely come back try rest menu  <EOR> I write because cannot stand unethical ways place conducts its business   force write favorable review Yelp before give good discount meal   KNOW cannot rely reviews see Yelp establishment   own experience extremely mediocre quality dim sum bordering really questioning people give such high praises food! However experience slightly better quality more recently but still believe second third fourth chances unfortunately still avoid going much possible     The positive things say place are 1   Nice setting relatively empty probably same reasons gave above own experience  2   Nice enough service dim sum joint anyway  3 Easy parking access   Negatives which most important factors 1 Quality food most 2 stars very generous day me  2   Prices any way reflect food provided   would much prefer Ping Pang Pong over even pricing! 3   just can't handle unethical business practice place exercises   I would propose Yelp all reviewers optional check box reviews denoting may receiving any financial gains posting reviews   Since owner manager sits stands while he awaits your posting know he see if posting negative review simply posting most review he's looking then end able check off box give reviewer comfort some redemption soul while posting positive review   Meanwhile let buyers beware  <EOR> Good selection dim sum  Flavors did pop though  bit disappointed lack seasoning  Food arrived hot  Service great  <EOR> Found place through Yelp although restaurant only opened less 3 weeks ago owner very friendly food well displayed   Coming New York set dim sum unorthodox because waiters don't serve food little carts instead display food behind glass customer see all possible options  Which better opinion  no labels above dim sum dishes if unfamiliar Chinese dishes displayed owner takes time explain which most delicious popular depending your preference all dishes if you're curious  adventurous diners she push try something new! prices each dish inexpensive  many wonderful entrées well if feeling Dim Sum mood  would recommend meat wrapped bean curd skin pork shrimp Shumai steamed sweet pork bun fried sweet pork bun sesame red bean balls  Everything full flavor  Please try it! friend definitely dine again near future  <EOR> Las Vegas some favorite eats world but stand said just can't dim sum right!  But when comparing other dim sum places Las Vegas Yum Cha okay  ordered variety typical standard fare  Most dishes bland but still palatable  squash pumpkin found black bean spare ribs but think using fillers give less meat  Food served hot steamers didn't appear reheated leftovers day before  big plus  Don't forget look heated bar holding some more food congee Chinese doughnuts liver tripe daikon   The staff very attentive place clean  Yum Cha cute name all decent place your dim sum eats if you're town but don't high expectations  <EOR> When going office stop quick bite  Service quick staff friendly  Usually only cart rolling around but order any type dim sum comes fast hot  best but better most  <EOR> Interesting place  food average IMHO   The great part food served hot   Though better versions almost everything ordered elsewhere wanna say enjoyed tripe shrimp hargow here    Service friendly quick but might struggle communication times    The prices $3 49 $3 99 etc  everything ordered fell into those two categories  <EOR> I Saturday night based yelp review  Place awesome  Great customer service  Great dim sum especially fried eggplant  definitely return  <EOR> This absolutely worst restaurants family dim sum! They don't even deserve star  I don't understand place 4 1 2 stars close 700 reviews! My family waited table 20 min before any server took food drink orders  Everything arrived slow   plates hot but food terribly cold  sent plates back never came back  carts never came around table ask it  We continuously waited entrees long periods time   None dishes came right serving utensils soup bowls soup spoons  complimented sauces never came any dishes traditional dim sum  When bill arrived father put credit card check presenter  When server came back bill no cc bill never charged  walked front someone another table said wasn't credit card  said thats father  charged wrong table  I explained bad service entire time he said sorry holiday weekend also said work service industry whether holiday service should terrible cashier asked if worked strip said yes he said     afford mistakes! kind restaurant gives answer! If you're off strip should show more excellence customer service avoid comments mistakes  I've never entire experience such terrible restaurant customer service food! <EOR> This almost seems bit ridiculous but always nervous highly rated Yelp dim sum places because find those rated lower tend more authentic  Despite previous experiences decided give place try  honestly wasn't impressed   I'm Cantonese tried dim sum all different sorts places  Personally find really speak culture authenticity taste dim sum should be  place it  Yes restaurant clean service good but Americanized    The dim sum expensive  taste dim sum itself subpar  Some foods old dry flavor itself lacking compared other places tried  only 1 cart being pushed around  remainder foods order but came cold unimpressive  Nice people overall but if you're truly looking authentic tasting dim sum would opt place  <EOR> This dim sum place pretty substandard  Came Saturday all three carts same 5 6 items  There's odd menu system where if don't see cart order but what's point dim sum?!? Shu mai pretty good everything else fair poor  Greasy dumplings heavy pork buns just fan  If people truly think best dim sum Vegas need LA SF Portland try really good dim sum  <EOR> Came Saturday noon  Food wasn't very good  food didnt seem fresh  worst part already ran Tofu ginger! Why oh why?! may give another though  Hopefully better second time around  <EOR> Damn some high expectations based upon 534 reviews  sadly disappointed came Saturday night around 8 15 pm shrimp dim sum  heck kind dim sum doesn't shrimp?! Ordered pork Belly pork katsu came out  Tripe ok tasted MSG  Beef noodle did flavor  Calamari salty veggie noodles bland  Save your money Orchids Garden  <EOR> This place never fails impress me  Great customer service great authentic dim sum  I usual tea  time ordered won ton soup  delicious  love dim sum always freshly cooked  <EOR> Ok dim sum  would way come back food  But service really good  <EOR> Chinese Dim Sum seem basic concept should all similar  Yum Cha quite few entrees most Dim Sum restaurants don't usually offer    The items ordered all really good tasty  quantity per order bit smaller compared others to  service needs some improvement well  Dim Sum restaurants where shoo them away because don't stop offering items   also annoying but when want more they're coming around worse    I would back next time Vegas looking Dim Sum  <EOR> Have 2 weeks ago dim sum great quality service   price reasonable   environment isn't transitional but all enjoyed dinner   Definitely come back soon  <EOR> I think new place dim sum    Everything inside updated  Modern decor great service good food   idea them coming your table just pin point want  Hahaha if there's dish wasn't familiar with fully inform best described dish  only thing wasn't fan there's other dishes counter but let them know bring your table  would better if small menu table convenience    Otherwise definitely come again  <EOR> This place super clean food really goos  highly recommend everyone wants try Chinese style dim sum  always service smile atmosphere super friendly  would definitely come back some more food! <EOR> Delicious food great service 10pm  Beats any fast food option long shot! Everything ordered tasted homemade fresh flavorful ingredients  loved hot sour soup! even made fresh baby bok choy not menu   back! <EOR> I time going gym    good food  took little while some fried dumpling tho sucked but most part good experience  <EOR>
