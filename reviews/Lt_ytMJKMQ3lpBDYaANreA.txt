Since largest child said does 13 inch look like  She said same tone carried on don't 13 inch  She said nothing further scanned board said Oh looking 13 dollars 2 foot guess 12 inch next smaller one? She said pointing gesturing its right front  said would take said wheat bread she picked cut said oh  no pickles  then she said Tell later when it  During time another customer walked regular way she spoke Desiree started cut meat cheese she chatting smiling making eye contact full attention regular customer  She even apologized regular customer process making mine ! if way exactly she projected  noticed turkey cheese almost shaved when she proceeded put toppings told no jalapenos then she reached them said again she took hand back didn't move rolled eyes if say well then want  rest toppings lettuce etc  scanty  sandwich looked flat  She continued disrespect until paid  waited side because don't scene wanted ask manager was  watched next customers food regular she asked double everything  sandwich huge she putting handfulls meat cheese etc    If mine doubled would even half size! Then another man  ordered sandwiches made much fuller mine well customer before me  finally left called store she said she manager told would talked person but since would say front others called then told she very rude nothing did merit that  She did act surprised say something like   did realize would never purpose     She said very monotone voice sorry won't again  Then asked why she did she repeated statement  telling she knew she called ended  buying sandwich child meeting only hour talk child eating well wanted  Port Subs protein other good veg  nothing sandwich almost just bread  could use time well speak child because shaken very bad experience which felt borderline abusive she bullying me   could thoughts together topic  continued anxiety later night because would seeing child again if anyone needed food did  feel she cheated child she really did  never experienced negative energy treatment ever any Port Subs  Desiree presented time welcoming environment Port Subs telling welcomed  Desiree  might manager but manage this  If received sandwich made 20 years ago anytime would never back Port Subs  would remembered back don't pay for  Desiree playing favorites customer using product she wished did wish giving whopping amounts food even excess handfuls meat cheese mine she did even put minimum required shaved it  Unlike Desiree former experience anyone else any Port Subs  All workers consistently dealt professional manner which put attention sure you're feeling good establishment food they're serving  always walked Port Subs feeling happy walked in  <EOR> Worst Port Subs ever! Slow service  things reasonable hour! cashier just dropped change counter  thought might mistake but then she did same thing receipt loyalty card  don't mean just placed items counter dropped them without care world  <EOR> Ehh location bit disappointing   food good but staff bit slow   the ice machine dirty black stuff which kinda grossed because ice room temperature water bottle payed for  love port but probably never return location  <EOR> This place getting 1 star review until business owner stops charging full price tap water  customer service excellent but charging $1 99 cup ice tap water ridiculous  <EOR> Just ordered through grub hub really happy it! work port subs Jones Badura seriously really good  grilled chicken Caesar wrap bacon really good  Props whoever working nice hot fresh  Thanks guys!! <EOR> Claud Tre two guys amazing!!!!

Thank Jaymie your resting B face definitely back  <EOR> Restrooms customers only means pay all your food before allow use restroom  ask if use restroom first lie say someone using then say paying customer    said    prefer bathroom wash hands first  your food hold while go  Really? clarified asking if pay food first before would allow use bathroom which said yes promptly left  walked Albertsons across parking lot used restroom deli returned car parked front Port Subs left  <EOR> I live nearby stopped coming while because last time manager employee two white guys arguing front everyone managers girlfriend came while which seemed picking then both started complaining employee  made daughter uncomfortable   Well fiancé came back today it's least year two employees a male female weren't paying attention while ordering food saying mam mam  bread asked asking male cut two foot long sub into thirds being problem  pretty sure paying food also sure eating people making it'd nice if listening didn't look crazy when asking cut sandwich   Although LOVE number 5 all Smokey cheddar deliciousness don't think returning port o subs any other location   I believe seriously need re train all your employees keep eye them because isn't first time probably last   This disappointing  <EOR> Love here  food delicious ! think id come everyday if kids didnt mind lol  number 1 best everything    course! dont forget chips! Cant sandwhich without chips  <EOR> Absolutely DISAPPOINTED!!!  WILL NEVER ORDER LOCATION!!  The owners @ location prepared run business sure!   I requested order 2 variety sandwich trays week advance daughters birthday   The day pick owners not employees figured didn't stock necessary products meats girls employees didn't enough ingredients finish order they 1 week advance notification now left missing whole orders roast beef pastrami sandwiches   The young lady apologetic situation poor girl constantly trying ahold owner sure he way meats but guess he way busy personal errands not caring business    He told employee let know it'll additional 30min wait besides 45 min already waited because he needed finish errands  OH NO! Mad point The young lady asked if ok rest order different ingredients   we no choice but keep basic due time crunch plus cake gonna down drain if didn't refrigerate time   Total chaos caused irresponsible business owner!  I RECOMMEND LOCATION  <EOR> All employees encountered all very nice  They're quick order never impatient waiting decide five family members want sandwiches  food tastes fresh looks fresh  them better Subway    place also smells fresh unlike Subway  If you're looking quick bite place fresh fast friendly service  <EOR> This food good  always sandwich way order prodcuts always fresh  think giving low stars because area  Scary people around here    <EOR> My initial impression when walking into Port Subs looked felt dirty   There line customers waiting place orders  three associates working hurried around trying best could  counter where sandwiches literally covered toppings lettuce spinach etc When turn associate took hand ran across counter wiping everything onto ground    I ordered veggie sandwich  sandwich itself ended being decent  Actually wasn't bad st all    My biggest concern associate ran back forth making sandwiches register  once did see wash hands  Gloves substitute hand washing! associate bounced back forth taking payments making sandwiches bunch times  <EOR> I love Port Subs just location!  I've never impressed location but last time cut meat thin falling apart!  capicola actually holes it!  Other Port Subs town much better   Yea dirty place dirty employees horrible restaurant  <EOR> This location always clean friendly fast! Everything would want restaurant be! 10 min till closing those 2 girls sweet letting take time recommending sandwiches  even turned grill back could toast sub  #5 delicious back again tomorrow night <EOR> I love Port Subs sandwiches  However nor recommend *this* particular location  experience   I decided give place another try previous customer service experience few weeks ago good  first time around ordered number couple other Port Subs locations town  asked #16  guy behind counter then started cutting meat different sandwich  When told asked #16 he became argumentative replied No asked #18  pretty sure asked #16 but did want argue him  He then said he could switch #16 but body language demeanor indicated he would happy  apologized miscommunication told finish making #18  He replied obligatory tone sure? replied You're good  Just finish making sandwich  Now gave benefit doubt dismissed 10 minutes closing time  He probably wasn't having best day just wanted sandwich go    This evening running little late work decided give place another try  pulled looked through store window noticed same person dealt last time behind counter  double checked sure place still open  15 minutes before closed 9 00pm  mumbled myself car Please no issues  soon walked door guy looks same look would when being caught between rock hard place said Uh       just cleaned everything       immediately did 180 turn walked without saying word   I work customer service also customer service manager  Therefore expectations people working customer service little higher some  also used work food service know when customers especially groups 3 more come during last few minutes just before closing time empathize workers normally try avoid being *that* customer  However particular situation party 15 minutes before closed   Unacceptable poor customer service  avoid particular location  <EOR> Very clean friendly efficient staff! If your looking semi healthy option little time   winner  No complaints <EOR> Corporate hold extremely apologetic day Port Subs  never someone reach before correct issue  apologized issued two $5 gift checks  also advised would deal employees  Thank Port Subs reaching going above beyond  shows care your reputation company  definitely visit again  <EOR>
