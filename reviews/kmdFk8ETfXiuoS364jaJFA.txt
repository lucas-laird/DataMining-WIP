Terrible place food subpar best overcooked dry  Nice hosting servers fantastic  Some random guy started fight over bashing food then proceed start yelling arguing us  took security over 30 minutes respond  could guy's ass left building before security responded  <EOR> The food delicious  American Mexican seafood  holiday weekends offer alcohol orange juice if comes during lunch time  price medium pricey  <EOR> There many better buffets Vegas why did family eat twice? Well really cheap breakfast  omelet bar good but lot food gross search something like  <EOR> I've many times say food recently gotten better!  Several years ago used dread coming eat come along because rest family used place default rally point   service back then bleh food good   This last Memorial Day weekend tried again actually impressed new selections   weekend brunch excellent tried crab legs oysters swordfish corned beef hash   Everything great surprise   Customer service slow removed star   waitress rarely came around take away used plates   But back next time  <EOR> This place really good especially eating country club buffet Prim Valley Resort  wine meal everything fresh pretty good selection foods although putting crab legs every station seafood night does count assortment   favorite foods raw oysters fried shrimp maple glazed salmon that might its exact name omg expresso gelato amazing!! pretty picky when comes coffee ice creams but surprised good tasted  wouldn't et Asian tuna quite dry oregano clams impressive but other clams good  didn't try red meats can't comment those  ciopino oddly sweet bad but amazing  I'd take chocolate chip cookie way out  Overall bad price  happy service foods picked any buffet eat your own risk  Enjoy! <EOR> When first visited before eventually moved brother took mimosa brunch  i loved it  come back now 4 yrs later back just remembered  Before players card because discount  waitress extremely nice made sure table cleared  Food good especially price  Its easy find kind food want every section labeled  Although asian section really feeling dessert made it  during lunch busy  welcome change chinese buffets usually frequent <EOR> You kidding me   Possibly worst food Vegas   only thing fresh salad horseradish   Brisket=Leather tough   Chicken= bla   Dessert sad  <EOR> This may worst place ever eaten  Some mentioned price 15 players card  could comped buffet given free room car service home would declined  food nasty look taste smell  clientele lines its some fabulous meal reality worthless  Don't eat here  <EOR> As far Vegas buffets far better choices then Garden Buffet South Point Hotel  However given fact hotel itself pretty far south Las Vegas Blvd  isolated plus discounts available if become Club member wasn't bad choice    We recently drove Vegas married stayed South Point Hotel few days before ceremony  took advantage free Club membership wanted utilize coupons discounts provided upon check in therefore dinner first night Garden Buffet    They various stations including Seafood Asian Italian BBQ etc  good variety food available every taste  unfortunate aspect wasn't very tasty  breakfast following morning although impressive better dinner night before    The final night decided give BBQ try sadly disappointed  opinion Seafood dinner far better tastier comparison    All all price convenience service reasons tried Garden Buffet but must say quality taste food very lacking  <EOR> We last friday because seafood night  brought kids 7 3 years old just want ice cream because dont seafood just chicken nuggets Mc Donald  Im just craving seafood happened just vicinity Southpoint knowing 7y o half price because just 2 months ago  But then when pay cashier seem she sure if she saying she charging 7 years old full price  think fair id other buffet city always charging kids half price consistent because said 2 months ago charged half price  cashier's  ignorance management's inconsideration overpricing made changes  Hope reviewed  pricing guidelines  its worth paying  30 dollars kids  orient cashier price   <EOR> This third time ate there   quality food good used to   fruits fresh meat dishes greasy   Well cannot complaint price which cheap dining area clean  <EOR> If overpriced less average food place you   weekends breakfast becomes  brunch $18 95 16 95 if club underwhelming meal  eggs Benedict terrible

before new year even starts    So what's LA disease you're probably wondering      It's term coined picked use whenever eat something ends giving runs  other words liquid ass  Some even call stomach flu  Whatever case line movie     stomach flu away target weight    Anyway Las Vegas family party 10 arrive surprisingly only wait 47 minutes seated  lot large parties front including party 20  bad staff shuffled empty tables around move blocks around Tetris    The wait staff pretty good too  Thus star  server didn't write drink orders down but remembered them correctly brought them quickly  She also clearing plates making some small talk  didn't ask name but she provided good service    But food     referring food   I plate  even full plate  wasn't wasn't hungry because always eat  scoop two different seafood dishes large slab rare Prime Rib few slices roasted turkey  could gotten sick off anything but point didn't dishes nor rest offered didn't grab anything else except slice Banana Cream Pie some Soft Serve    It first visit property likely last  stomach ailment pass just pass eating place ever again  <EOR> Not worth $29 95 price adults Kids most kids age 8 won't eat much food food   worse home town buffet pay extra $10 M worth price  <EOR> My husband dined Garden Buffet lunch several days while vacationing Vegas staying South Point hotel  found food hit and miss  Some options better others  husband tried several different foods each station including different types meat which always seemed fatty lacking any flavor  really enjoyed stir fry which tasted great every day but found pizza macaroni cheese potatoes no flavor  liked buffet price includes pop having hard time finding restaurants serve Pepsi products love offered Mountain Dew  buffet offers lots options choose large comfortable area sit but would say quality food could improved  <EOR> over all food 55 older people food bland no flavor <EOR> Food sad limp uninspired cold  Cleanliness line poor well  Chefs mailing in  Wait staff also slow  <EOR> I 2 times completely different experiences   first time came around 9  food ok   omelette station pretty quick   also scrambled egg whites   Veggies bit hard find  service great   Refill drinks brought right away   second time 10  sign said lunch 11  figured enough time  paid said sure all food want 10 30  time no attention fron server   No refills   Half food put away 10 15  only veggies available omelette station which happily gave some   food ok   obviously sitting while   left 10 50  8 servers area manager   Noone took plates table offered more drinks   second visit enjoyable but food worst ever  <EOR> Disappointing  All food cold seemed come straight can  Honestly wasn't appetizing lost when searching through selection  Some food would really good if wasn't cold  much selection pretty small Buffet  Sunday afternoon no line  Waiter really assertive friendly didn't even ask he already knew needed thank that  Two stars effort but don't think going again  <EOR> If you're looking inexpensive might place also away crazy strip traffic  lots choose terms different types cuisines  If come weekend Fri Sun seafood available  Staff friendly  <EOR> This mediocre buffet becomes fabulous meal deal when 2 for 1 coupon  already inexpensive but coupon such good offer impossible give go   This isn't worst buffet Vegas not long shot but also nothing fancy  during Saturday brunch where decent selection breakfast lunch items   The buffet arranged bit odd breakfast items sprinkled throughout including seafood section  stuck lunch items including peel and eat shrimp prime rib carving station super sweet watermelon pizza    Unfortunately full time noticed Mongolian BBQ section  also did leave room dessert    There good variety food mostly good quality  Nothing amazing nothing horrible  very basic    The decor everything South Point looks cruise ship 80's   I might return if coupon but would buffet would way visit  <EOR> Well

  Probably biased but everyone thought turkey good   Nothing memorable but price don't think it  <EOR> Breakfast buffet crazy good   Great value fresh food all sorts   Clean friendly   Free Bloody Mary's !  enjoyed everything  <EOR> We don't normally buffets food allergies contend with   Having said chef did come helped advise which foods stay clear of  Seemed decent buffet most part but having tried others especially Vegas hard rate   would give 3 star but selective choose   basics good eg prime rib spinach rice pilaf mashed potatoes   club price thought very reasonable especially compared other alternatives Canada   I'd read others reviews comparisons other Vegas buffets seem better appreciation else available  But seems no lineups reasonable food satisfy both adults kids decent price wins them 3  <EOR> Went lunch  Right when opened  selection minimal everything luke warm even though lunch service just begun  club card weekday lunch $9 95    you definitely pay for! <EOR> Though considered fancy buffet place quality food service  staff friendly tries ensure line long  good variety food say prime rib delicious actually back seconds  Definitely reasonable priced buffet! <EOR> No!!!! buffet come to???? Oh god favorite spots come crazy buffet walk gamble heart out  Great deals players   Unfortunately buffet stepped down BIG TIME  First off crab  looked liked legs shrunk when eat them hardly meat off shell but when taste wasn't bad  biggest gripe cocktail shrimp  lady would come often enjoy nice surf turf dinner  Prime rib some shrimp some squeezed lemon top all needed  now changed  There's no flavor when eat soft mushy no texture 10 shrimp CRAP VEIN still it!!!!!! HELLO SOUTHPOINT! No wants eat crap! Literally!

Ive worse though  Salad bar prime rib peel eat shrimp we're good  Everything else mediocre  huge selection items also but $15 dinner guess can't complain  probably won't back dinner again but try breakfast buffet  <EOR> I'll start off saying two things 1  Buffet food usually sub par compared individually prepared dishes 2  pay for   would crazy compare buffet likes buffets Ceasar's Bellagio where you'll pay $50 per person  Considering price don't any complaints regarding food   Did everything tried no  Did leave hungry absolutely not   Sunday afternoon lunch  decent crowd but staffed appropriately wasn't much wait any point   waitress did forget fiancés silverware when she brought drinks but able some another server quickky  prime rib delicious   little tough cut butter knife but flavor wellness prefect   SIDENOTE IF WANT MEAT COOKED MORE WELL DONE ASK CHEF THROW GRILL YOU! He enjoyed seafood options all them although he really hoping crab legs  dessert section decent   Honestly think dessert better Bellagio!   Conclusion if you're area looking decent meal low cost give shot  <EOR> I terrible experience here  cashiers really rude tried give club discount  Secondly tried prime rib LITERALLY give raw meat  Yes know prime rib supposed red  But literally raw made sick  All food terrible old some slimy seasoned whatsoever  But expect cheaper buffet Vegas? much  raw meat situation shocked though just appalled  Don't come else you'll sick  You're better off going McDonalds something   tragic food was  <EOR> Please don't eat here  Mediocre best even some deserts seem smart final rejects old dry    save your time money walk over stake shake  visit Vegas every year worst buffet ever to  buffet small seafood it  some options but all cold just gross   Skip all together <EOR> We ate never coming back  food terrible  very picky dude  But buffet   I spit everything bit into  only thing good hard boiled eggs spam  taking wife every time Vegas  <EOR> I'm really picky when comes buffets   long find few items enjoy leave satisfied   Today found just that   even found several enjoyable dessert items   should mention today's meal comp but even $10 wouldn't complain   As side note first time ate few years ago when casino still South Coast buffet item labeled Al's Gratin  Hilarious = <EOR> This buffet pretty delicious!!!! food always good however sometimes kind cold side! I'd definatley sunset buffet! <EOR> I ate last sunday afternoon all day weekend Brunch   $12 98 buffet rather above average tastes   buffet doesn't compare those Wynn Belliago any other high end place but still good price  remember dining some really nice prime rib better ones before Wynn Belliago just because seemed fresher much pre cooked   meat flavor also something decently good better those $7 99 prime rib specials find downtown buffalo bills    remember eating lot breakfast usuals eggs pancakes bacon sausage etc   saw lot people getting made fresh omeletes but didn't partake filling prime rib fried shrimp   lol   saw dessert section which looked okay things carrot cake cheesecake etc    didn't enough room try them but assuming probably average   Lastly thought fresh fruit section really good   pineapple honeydew freshly cut grapefruit sections!!    Overall around $13 bucks Garden Buffet good deal only if you're staying South Point Hotel    otherwise really worth drive since far main strip hotels   Here's tip saw few players getting comps when playing $25 more hand blackjack any other table game  <EOR> 2 1 2 stars  Wanting finish off Vegas trip buffet but huge price since spent weekend already came upon friend's recommendation being decent buffet   Coming building tell lot older most ones strip  under constuction putting really nice plushy carpet though   Anyways no wait when seated immediately  liked buffet different stations Mexican Asian Salad Seafood Carving station American     The food though mediocre  all edible but felt hard choose something actually liked back for  most part well seasoned cooked alright  But said nothing really worth going back for   The desserts uhhh    questionable  ths lime green pie cake looking thing fingers literally bounced back when poked it  floamy spongey piece dessert if even sense  Weird     Overall eh    price a little under $15 lunch think alirght but actually rather spend little more money better buffet  <EOR> After reading reviews reluctant eat but breakfast excellent! Very friendly service made order omelette  great!
