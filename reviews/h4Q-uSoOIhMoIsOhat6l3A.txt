Unfortunately last few times come service BAD took forever them even acknowledge there  Then last night tried sitting bar girl behind bar nice friendly all  When ask chips salsa order she just attitude  tried address manager owner lady when walking asking Juan trying tell bad girl behind bar but she just kept ignoring pretty much just said goodbye  why decided leave honest review because used truly enjoy coming but anymore  If owner manager would want know if any employees being friendly providing excellent service  When Juan he would above beyond welcome open arms  He knew used always order  noticed Juan all customers came in  Since haven't seen service dropped tremendously  more thing noticed chicken tacos used much more chicken then now  really hope some changes positive direction come back enjoy place friends family again  know only experiencing poor service either  used talk place all friends family all agreed service same anymore  <EOR> It heavy heart write first good review I pondered writing review while several reasons  First all swore myself would only write 5 star reviews because don't really saying negative things place  motivated positive experiences negative ones  Secondly didn't want review clouded negative feelings initially present still shocked service bill days later! Finally debated number stars give since never written review less 5  all nothing type person initial thought give 1 star but decided would wrong since able eat food finish drink    Just before posting asked daughter opinion she said 2 stars  She wanted walk 10 minutes but she kinda agro  She thought being generous giving 3 stars let's just say 2 1 2 stars!   I also hate writing really long reviews because start bore myself! However review probably needs long because much talk about  Ok go!   So daughter just moved Vegas asking locals if knew good Mexican restaurant  Everyone told Lindo Michoacan Casa Don Juan  when came visit decided come close where she lives    Ok already bored just point!
