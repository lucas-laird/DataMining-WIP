YES WANT VEGAN said LOUDLY while pointing vegan menu  O k  end thought properly communicated needed all vegan food sister  vegan menu vegan garlic fries which ordered  made CRYSTAL CLEAR needed VEGAN garlic fries regular ones  Seriously said SEVERAL times  Well sister gets sandwich fries starts eat  say what's stuff top your fries?

Walk through doors back eat your pizza next giant waterfall    The pizza ok big slices inexpensive  Even though Wynn known being vegetarian vegan friendly weren't many vegetarian vegan options    It fun sit next waterfall but wouldn't destination  <EOR> I did expect anything pizza place  hungry but much wanted splurge high profile restaurants  dropped place surprised   I slice pesto carne   carne just ok but pesto very good  3 stars   The service slow but outside tables side water falls very nice add another star  <EOR> Came fries used stellar  Ended getting grease logged potato sticks  Sent them back sent same fries just reheated microwave  disappointed  never return tell all friends once recommended place bad news  <EOR> I'm surprised good reviews others   ok pizza definitely true NY Style pizza   But big floppy slices worth $10   friend each slice that's plenty food BTW Coke   Total bill $22   thought crust little thin definitely oily   Yes NY Style pizza usually sop oil couple napkins some people think  part experience but having reminded  thing don't NY Style pizza   Maybe would better experience different dish  <EOR> Good place quick bite if stay Wynn Hotel   place your order cashier put your order number tag table waiter deliver your food your table   Relatively inexpensive when compared other restaurant inside hotel   Nice view man made water fall just outside   outdoors sittings great Spring Fall cold Winter hot Summer  <EOR> Si vous avez chaud et que vous n'est pas adepte de la climatisation dépêchez vous !!! Pour vous rafraichir près de la Cascade du Pizza Place  Mais soyez très rapide ou chanceux car les places en terrasse près de celle ci sont très très chères  Voir photo ci dessous Et pour ce qui est du déjeuner mon sandwich était parfaitement garni et très bon  Seul regret c'est les piments dans la garniture un peu trop en mon goût  La salade était très fraiche et bien assaisonnée  Le pain garlic Knots était hyper gras et 4EUR pour 3 petits morceaux ça frôle le vol  Voir photo ci dessous Voir photo ci dessous Ce qui est top c'est la boisson à volonté  <EOR> The first thing know going portions HUGE!

BUT pizza addicts bf stop we stayed Encore put two cents  Cheese pizza while totally underrated far best way judge pizza  can't mask flavor tomato sauce quality consistency melted cheese crisp thinness crust    With said cheese pizza quite impressive! Large thin slice just  right crisp texture  wouldve totally given 4 stars but pizza just way greasy  literally sweating which total turnoff me  pack lot flavor without over greasing slice  Anyhow come try when you're town even if just ate Wynn buffet like did!   <EOR> DELICIOUS FOOD!

Same Meatball pizza  Unless new style thin crusted Italian delicacy I'd recommend skipping it  still serve gelato Sugar Ice did but weather wasn't working favor taste sweet treat    If want comforting tasteful bite lunch without having break your bank definitely check place out   and sliders! They're amazing  Don't forget check gorgeous view patio  <EOR> Always stop when we're town  carne meal deal don't forget sangria  Only down side reserved signs all tables confusing  They're just keep non customers out  <EOR> One few places isn't ridiculously over priced Las Vegas!

Thin crust perfect amount cheese   Love it! <EOR> Steve Wynn himself threw down gauntlet in room TV service when he scoffed being compared New York style pizza said he setting better  When kind claim better back least respectable   Nope  Serving slice pizza big your head doesn't good  pizza reeked same old game try NY pizza but fail miserably it  infinitely more disappointing bad pizza shop does own way  But if you're doing imitate something least right    Anyway saving grace chicken wings actually good! Very good amount heat more expected least bit crispy something shocked me  become used sogfests try pass off crispy wings! <EOR> 4 Stars  I usually prefer thick crust pizza but best pizza's ever had   and new york style w thin crust! It took longer should food come salad slice pizza italian sandwich fries but when did come worth it        I would've skipped going club just back room w whole pizza if option    but gf would kill if did   The Italian sandwich fries salad all good    but pizza killed it!!!!!!! The only reason step foot Wynn again here  <EOR> Anywhere eat Wynn pretty expensive but prices aren't bad for Vegas   I'd rather eat other cafes Wynn    Good service good pizza salad pretty good garlic knots   though I'd opt garlic parmesan fries sit patio watch waterfall  There's also outlet outside if wanted use your laptop anything   8 95 large slice pizza your choice side $24 whole pie salad choice side  <EOR> I really liked place because decor ambiance  reminded real pizza places Europe everything Wynn Encore extremely beautiful   The pizza good good NYC despite Steve Wynn's declarations contrary but def good  Enjoyed icy cold Peroni frosted glass love attention detail   Place looks man made waterfall river which lovely relaxing  Also liked visit duck   Staff super friendly all staff encountered Wynn Encore  <EOR> Probably cheapest eateries Wynn Encore establishment  Sorry folks won't find Panda Express McDonald's but try $10 Circus Circus buffet down street if you're serious budget    From room watched hotel's food channel describes each dining options Steve Wynn's arsenal  When he talked Pizza Place located beginning Wynn's indoor shopping row he claimed brought NY style pizza Sin City    The pizza thin crust  if you're fan then should gain slight favor you  Although crust itself use some help  just doughy dry  slice meatball pizza  nice sized slice but only topped off two measly pieces meatballs  deal where some garlic fries $8  Fries quite oily  friend sandwich simple salad tomato soup   Top all almost $4 refillable fountain drink total came $30 something  Don't ask but just remember which hotel dining at  simple dinner didn't expect much  just knew going pricey eventually    Overall pizza decent  Nothing outstanding but just take quick fix  BTW place does packed especially Le Reve lets while ordering other should grab table  also take take whole box pizza pie well  <EOR> A pizza place Wynn   interesting idea   If need quick bite looking save some money good place eat   Ideal lunch   views water features outside great   The pizza good   quite authentic New York but its close going any where near west coast   tried carne pepperoni sausage ham   pretty good   crust super thin   I also tried garlic knots   just ok   lack strong garlic flavor  <EOR> Located Wynn Esplanade shopping area    Closest south entrance off strip near pedestrian bridges Palazzo Fashion Show Mall     It's nice place upscale cafe deli atmosphere   additional seating outside patio overlooking large waterfall   All flat screen TV's tuned into sports which nice if want catch game   Oh yeah free wi fi blazing fast!
