We'd lengthy road trip LA Vegas Grand Canyon into Page AZ then Zion back Vegas see where we'd bit hungry craving some actual real food   It came surprise when looked Lotus Siam noticed few reviews due new location but didn't throw off all  very excited finally try them  son loves most ethnic food knew he'd totally game Thai always favs   We didn't rezzie but did walk in short wait time  While some dressed nines looking very Vegas rolled car still totally fine fitting more casual diners  really everyone won't say any specific dress code  Looks most things go   Onto menu     We started dumplings wor wonton soup both very good shared pineapple fried rice yellow curry pad se ew    Everything filling tasty I'm sure I'd order pineapple fried rice again only because big fruit rice type person but still nice try it totally hit spot being road couple days  staying Vegas evening perfect option great off strip hotel meal   I'd definitely return short cab uber ride if flew into Vegas don't car you  <EOR> My first experience truly amazing   Maybe because came bachelor party gathering afterwards   not completely sure   just remember meal night took Thai cuisine whole new level excited come bday trip   We ordered Garlic Prawns Chilean Seabass Drunken Noodle Crispy Duck soft shelled crab   All choices Chef's Choice portion menu   All plates over $20 which pretty expensive but remembered all amazing should worth right?    The food came pretty quickly snapping pics food every angle wiped drool chest began dig in   big plate garlic prawns looked bit overwhelming but quickly learned only 1 2 contents edible because butterflied prawns then deep fried them wing meat other empty shell battered up   Dang  deceiving   The duck delicious curry gravy but only 5 slices which equates more $5 sliver   soft shelled crab bad but feel hard mess lol   most disappointing dish hands down Chilean Seabass    know thru research seabass common fish name used interchangeably but Chilean Seabass very specific variety seabass also known Patagonian Toothfish    fish different others because much higher fat content which gives extremely buttery tender texture separates itself other varieties     The fish definitely advertised     What tough much leaner tough rockcod texture   When called waiter over complained manager came apologized saying overcooked but beg differ   purposely overcooked Chilean Seabass home before to ensure thick slab cooked all way thru never tough rockcod   would think Lotus Siam high class establishment would never substitute higher grade meats cheaper variety but watching news recently restaurant being busted practice sure     Yes new location whole lot nicer but ambiance only third  equation wonderful dining experience   Service great gentleman server but great lady   most important element great meal course food which miss me  overpriced very small portions felt tricked Chilean Seabass even though removed bill   next amazing Thai meal Thailand now crossed Lotus Siam off list  <EOR> Much better location original   Lunch wait 10 mins   Food excellent fresh   try dinner need reservations expect same quality   waiter very friendly although familiar menu he should be  <EOR> This place kicks ! Came 15 years ago pretty good  Now just good better panang curry green papaya salad both 10  Could gotten salad 8 but curry right point  Tres délicieuse ! <EOR> Definitely best Thai food restaurant offered Vegas! would absolutely come back again next time am town! <EOR> Again thank Anthony Bourdain showing place  family came Sunday 6 pm packed  didn't reservation but seems probably would next time  waited hour seemed forever  place huge very beautiful  Probably most fanciest Thai restaurant ever too  plate portions small expensive but delicious  many different spices bite mouth watering  2 different rice plates believe basil crab  pork beef drunken noodle plates  Lastly favorite plate crispy duck asked sauce side but sure way would still good  total 5 plates 5 share say content super stuffed but hungry after  Oh don't forget Thai tea approve brother says Thai coffee 8 10  <EOR> I ordered boss check Lotus Siam while Vegas few weeks ago     Good thing listened   I LOVE Thai food but guys take new level   ordered Khao Soi simplicity dish belies delicious was   textbook example Thai food precisely balances sweet sour spicy salty  bit disappointed no wine pair food Boo liquor authority technicalities    but then again mere fact proudly offer multiple versions Gewurztraminer left smiling well left Vegas   Definitely worth going off Main Vegas Strip for!  Just sure plan well advance esp  if want dinner large parties! <EOR> I gave place 5 stars  should 4 5 stars  few little things off   But mostly amazing    First service     called reservations couple weeks advance because tried when company before couldn't it  wait 5 10 min reservation time which wasn't bad  seated booth pretty small 5 us  But turned ok because cleared off empty plates quickly  waiter knowledgeable but difficult time understanding times  end asked boxes  waiter very busy large party people next us  asked other server people walking by  He gave plastic coated boxes leftovers which included curry which would worked  then asked waiter again some plastic tubs  He said he usually packs leftover food put curry tubs  water filled constantly drinks refilled often before asked  service well oiled machine yet  thinking haven't new place long few kinks work out    About food ordered Koong Sarong prawn blanket appetizer  best tasting foods ordered  tasted bacon fried wonton wrapped shrimp but couldn't find bacon  just flavor bacon  good  also ordered garlic fried prawns because everyone talks it  When first brought cold  asked if supposed cold because sitting some cold chopped cabbage  said no brought another warmer plate  really good crunchy good flavor  glad tried but won't order again because very expensive get  ordered crab fried rice  large pieces egg crab other things large pieces cold cucumber tomato  made rice cold quickly  sure understand value using cold food warm dish food but friend said Thailand  Mmmm   flavor good but won't order again  green curry husband Musaman curry  flavors amazing  He ordered 3 hotness level ordered level 2  Mine much hotter his  think might difficult regulate hotness levels when some dishes fresh chili's peppers some not  any rate both curries excellent   better anywhere ever been  son ordered Crispy Duck Drunken Noodles  said excellent  guess difficult find duck prepared correctly  He very happy  daughter law ordered Beef Rama  She said amazing  daughter order Squid Garlic  She said ok but would try something else next time   definitely come back  quieter environment but really love food  I'd just date husband    Summary     excellent flavors sauces!

fried rice noodles more reasonably priced still little expensive side   We ordered duck curry spice level 7 crab fried rice   Duck curry great crispy skin good meat skin ratio  curry panang beautifully spicy  Level 7 perfect table   Crab fried rice okay  could see crab but really taste it  Also parts looked imitation crab vibrant red tint imitation crab does  large sliced tomatoes gave added layer would've missed without   The service weirdly spotty time came in  really good beginning then when ordered lull  waited 15min food arrive afterwards service stopped  ended grabbing own

party 4 parents uncle wait hour table around 1pm lunch  When seated took 15 more minutes someone interact take order another 10 minutes water served   Finally total hour half appetizers served which delicious fresh super flavorful almost made forget wait   The papaya salad fresh delicious spicy sweet flavor  larb salad minced pork also good but maybe tad bit salty me  also decided try pork 'Thai jerky' which yummy when dipped house made sauce  Rounding everything hefty shrimp salad nice spicy well rounded flavor overall   Once cleared plates another lull before entrees appeared shredded jackfruit pork dish  served without promised side rice waiting 10 minutes nothing else coming finished waiting rest food    After another 10 minutes other three entrees served  northern Thai dish Khao Soi noodles chicken which nice mild sweet  note when asked spicy wanted said medium spice grinds recommend ask high   My uncle Hor Mok Chilean Sea Bass which yummy steamed sea bass egg dish mixed cabbage coconut milk curry sauce  came cast iron beautifully presented 7 mini dishes    Our last entree another jackfruit dish Kang Ka Noon  dad slightly disappointed texture more watery would liked but flavor jackfruit curry undoubtedly delicious    We stuffed end meal but wanted cleanse palates some coconut ice cream  usually find ice creams bland boring but tasted fresh delicious while also super creamy    Overall wait service leaves something desired but if time food quite good find some unique dishes available many other Thai restaurants area  <EOR> They're still #1   If haven't eaten
