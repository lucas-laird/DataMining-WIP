Just imagine tasting buttery garlic lemony old bay seasoning sauce  <EOR> If hear wonderful place more time people knew going scream  decided come ordered half pound shrimp which very much hot juicy style baby spice which made nose run because spicy  three potatoes meal flavor good tons garlic beware bad date spot! Ordered side calamari table  around $12 came tiny basket thing sauce 12 pieces $1 piece horrible! left everyone still kind hungry wasn't lot food but cheap either  honestly think ton more places would rather eat! guess experience good but something adding top list any means  <EOR> Was visiting friend Henderson weekend headed Kabob Grill per recommendation lunch saw place excited  south love some crawfish shrimp fresh only course  when he said he meaning try place pointed headed asked important question  your crawfish fresh where      yes fresh part don't know origin  Normally only Louisiana crawfish preferably non farm raised    yes know snob but when grow catching your own learn thing two your catch  moved forward anyway  Since buddy never really crawfish fun show eat them  2lbs Hot Juicy Mild Crawfish 1lbs Hot Juicy Mild Shrimp Fried Catfish Basket good measure because buddy big eater he afraid just seafood would enough  Needless say table looked bone shell yard when done  Which always find amusing      Now am Cal am regular place called Boiling Crab which chain same concept one  fly seafood Louisiana daily typically large crawfish  sure where places supply comes but crawfish mostly really small medium there  everyone knows eating crawfish takes some labor  small ones process getting full lot harder  Also becuase small easy overcook them little which normally tail where all meat pop off  felt bad buddy because he kept grabbing ones head no tail  He spent later portion meal digging through bag try find all missing tails      flavor good good Boiling Crab  But worth trying  typically don't citrus crawfish shrimp Hot Juicy Special seasoning some citrus flavor it  if would Juicy Cajun Louisiana Style think sure because didn't try but sounds closer normally back here  spice levels little deceiving which typical places this  discussed waitress she acknowledged medium hot side on      mild enough kick without allowing taste meat  course if pepper head then all means    blow up!  The catfish different both buddy agreed  necessarily bad but just ok  could tell frozen maybe properly defrosted before fried  Cajun fries good better typical regular fries  All all good experience   Oh also if used eating lot butter oil which most people aren't place little heavy you  use alot butter sauces  if just use places treat time time  But hey if handle everyday carry carry on      <EOR> Like said check in love H J first time location  All food best ever  server Aubrey gave really attentive personable service  definitely come back next time Vegas! <EOR> Awsome food!  spicy kind guy server Jessica awesome!
