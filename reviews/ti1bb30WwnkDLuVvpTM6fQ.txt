Guacamole great perfectly michelada! Awesome meal   little pricey but still yummy  <EOR> Mixed reviews place since depends kind seafood you're used eating ask      I ordered Tostada De Camaron cosido Tostada De Ceviche de camaron However didn't eat ceviche since straight raw shrimp! Don't wrong love good shrimp ceviche but marinated lime juice aka cooked citrus But if you're ok raw shrimp you'll probably love it  presentation perfect red onions avocado    The actual cooked camaron tostada horrible!! No flavor whatsoever!! No salt no lime no salsa nothing!! simply taste just boiled shrimp water threw tostada chopped cucumbers tomatoes    must've added least 4 lemon slices half tsp salt still did nothing give tostada any flavor    Huge Disappointment!! <EOR> Oysters fresh  Between two ordered dozen partner only 2 each  afraid food poisoning    The Camarones con aguacate delicious but beware   they cost $28!!! Definitely worth price  <EOR> Good micheladas descent food but grossed all dead flies raid trap  Nasty am trying eat here  live band getting last nerve thou  lil quite time wouldn't hurt since friends wanted conversate bit  <EOR> The worst  place order took over hour  We asked more drinks since food taking long never came ask 3 time them   food still didn't arrive   worst came because recommended but service horrible  <EOR> service ok food amazing!!! would drive vegas just eat here!!! best oysters everrrrrrrrrr!!! <EOR> First time restaurant truly surprised iv craving oysters carne asada while defeneitly hit spot only customer service good but meat no joke give huge piece carne asada chewy easy tear apart didn't even use knife provided cut boyfriend ordered lengua en salsa verde left nothing plate if your fan lengua defenietly need try it  oysters preparados point mention nice performance live banda end night  <EOR> Crazy much menu prices increased throughout years but even said continue come back  north side town sketchy corner Pecos Washinton but place worth every penny!

The first good sign a PACKED parking Lot  We step inside hoping see abuelita upfront making tortillas mano fingers crossed YES! another good sign      Instead tables packed majority being Hispanics Go where locals right? two but THREE different bands going table table 2 Mariachi bands 1 Ranchero Band taking song requests dine   Service staff hustling kitchen all kinds seafood specialities trying orders guests ASAP    We finally sat tiny booth corner eager see menu   So decide mixed seafood Campechana seafood cocktail shrimp octopus oysters abalone plate Pulpitos sauteed baby octopus suggested waitress   I guess dissapointment set first bite  Both dishes looked better tasted    the octopus rubbery being overcooked   The Campechana tasted watered down lacked flavor even all seafood inside  kept having season condiments table  Even worse unadvertised addition imitation crab meat!  Did order wrong things? Kitchen off day?  Hard say but hard say if restaurant does Nayarit any justice   ALOHA!!! <EOR> Well beeb wanting try while 3 friends off work early   Im glad did!!
