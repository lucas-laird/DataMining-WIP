came say hi me  When left 625 ish all seats bar taken pool tourney possibly effect  Interesting joint! <EOR> This place most ghetto but cool place ever life well maybe but least lately  Every time far seriously degenerate issue comes up    The latest issue Mexican man approaching boyfriend very drunk just talking blue    That same day some weird cheesy looking guy Seattle obsessing nearby slot machine eager small talk me   A couple months prior woman passed drunk fell chair  she regained consciousness she asked waitress some free food offerred half late night breakfast which he carried restaurant chased down chef stealing dishes    I chef should say cook there  He very nice extremely friendly  pool tables darts cigarette machine jukebox  super dive some character but if street if boyfriend didn't pizza much would come here   I must admit though drama really funny am little bit attracted scenery   Plus PBR tap cheap house wine comped if put money slot machines  But careful slot machines old buttons sticky easy mistakes on  If drunk could easily lose lot money fast! <EOR> Went looking Eagle's bar found over East Las Vegas  Decided give try despite area being little run down  dive bar quite few people already  told pick any seats available  Found other side bar  Waiter guy friendly did best take order any new customers coming in    Menu straight point some East Coast staples scrapple crab fries  Scrapple meat loaf product made pork leftovers mixed garlic powder spices cornmeal and or buckwheat  usually shaped into loaf cut them into slices pan fry slices  Traditionally served mustard grape jelly  Seeing menu cool but learned personal food experience traditional foods unless place known probably best just stick basics  burger American cheese fries  significant other burger crab fries but no veggies burger  Note crab fries french fries Old Bay seasoning  Ordered diet soda water  diet soda came tasted terrible  sharp vinegar sourness  Just bad  Maybe syrup soda gun came questionable but take back bar  Barkeep gave regular soda didn't taste bad but fresh either  Water tasted fine though  Decided order beer bottle well  Burger came white American cheddar cheese  Pretty sure because look menu again but menu said American  Maybe just used American cheese being yellow unless otherwise indicated  took bite burger eating turned burger around because tomatoes lettuce slipping out  Sadly 2 bright green mold spots tomatoes  took all veggies inspected burger patty  meat bread looked ok  disappointed  actually ate most remaining burger but kept thinking everything red flag  sour tasting soda moldy tomatoes bar full people but lot people actually eating  Maybe loyal customers know better because only 3 people eating just fries    The patrons generally friendly cheering team scored  No rude waiter doing best given he working with  ask credit debit card open tab even though weren't drinking lot  thought kind weird but must policy because asked same couple came us  star guy waiter working hard  He didn't control over food he given customer  He even asked everything? just said ok  did ask close tab shortly food he quickly did so    I don't mind dive bars places trendy best neighborhoods because think should keep open mind  However don't when place actually lives into stereotype dive bar not clean iffy food no pride what's being served  experience good don't recommend  Maybe just ok watch game but much else  <EOR> We vacation Vegas needed place watch Eagles game  scoped Eagles themed bar day before decided come back game  ton drink specials game day including bloody Mary's car bombs beer buckets etc  serve variety food TastyKake buffet set during halftime  ordered wings grilled cheese onion rings scrapple lol  All food awesome!! server Bree adorable  great place watch game! **NOTE NEGATIVE REVIEWS SEVERAL YEARS AGO** <EOR>
