Comes 5 leaves lettuce  Salt Pepper Pork flavorful tender fried salt pepper pork fried garlic sliced jalapeno chili    Salt Pepper Squid unlike pork quite unflavored  Lots batter  friend used soy sauce wasabi sushi sashimi dipping sauce this  actually pretty good idea  used XD   Pork Jowl Meat Fresh Mushroom XO Sauce Various mushrooms oyster mushroom button mushroom cooked good amount pork jowl meat  Jowl essentially cheek  Very marbleized fatty piece meat very limited per animal  Flavorful dish    Ma Po Tofu Chinese Style Soft white tofu blocks mixed peas carrots brown sauce very mild dish almost borderline Americanized  Traditional Mapo tofu should spicy numbing  peas carrots  no spice  Tofu itself soft yummy though  Rest bit weird    Oxtail Pot Tender oxtail bathed sweet red wine bean curd sticks Very tender oxtail cooked sweet red wine sauce fried tofu bean curd sticks  Delicious dish  All meat essentially falling off bone  Great rice ! noodles !   Beef Brisket Pot similar sauce oxtail pot except brisket beef tendon  If only oxtail pot beef tendon    XD good ! Its boneless version oxtail    Green Beans XO Sauce first time good  second time its forgot use seasoning didn't use enough XO sauce  know XO kind pricey but don't put little dish bland  think green beans cooked twice either    Hot Tea Jasmine Green Oolong Always gotten Oolong  2 tea bags per pot  Surprisingly those tea bags gives good amount flavor  Don't know why drink much tea few times here  Friend starting hate having refill cup often !   Mochi Ice Cream Platter Mango Strawberry Green Tea Each platter comes 1 mochi each flavor cut half  Mochi soft mildly chewy  Yummy dessert end meal   I am pleasantly surprised good place is  always quite skeptical Asian restaurants casinos usually pretty bad especially smaller casinos  Especially those multiple specialties chinese japanese etc   High price point low quality  Price fairly moderate casino restaurant but least food good  <EOR> We ate evening  before show  Seated quickly Service very slow  Ordered scallops broccoli   But fish didn't taste  fresh even scallops any kind  Very disappointing <EOR> Service pretty good Chinese food best Vegas far living three years  looking favorite Chinese restaurant think found it  ordered kung pao Mongolian beef both excellent  lunch special which also included soup which average  meat both dishes extremely well seasoned sauce made Kung pao die for  <EOR> Save yourself some dough Panda Express food definitely better panda  Our food cold took hour   If happen awful place don't order General Tso chicken disgusting coated some sort jelly ! <EOR> Came vegan afternoon snack veggie lettuce wraps veggie sushi  Wrap 4pcs better sushi 6pcs   Good value $17 both tax  <EOR> Poor service uncaring staff turned otherwise four star experience two star disaster   even delicious food could compensate serving person table's meal 16 minutes other two   then told ready waiting served kitchen but the waiter backed inexcusable   Barely apology nothing compensate   Pitiful   Peter manager made excuses then dismissed experience clearly mattered nothing him  He clearly unqualified job   worthy patronage  back  <EOR> I eaten before food always excellent  sushi fresh prepared well   Last night ordered Salt Pepper Sea Bass  wonderful flavor fishy but because lightly tempura battered pretty greasy  would deter coming back would just order something else  <EOR> Found place accident pleasantly surprised  Excellent menu Japanese Chinese Korean  fun mix match between 3  Good staff decent prices! <EOR> From time party greeted hostess Monica waiter Deni Saturday night show dinner great experience  liked fact both traditional Japanese Chinese offerings vast menu  back! <EOR> Excellent Asian restaurant Orleans hotel  won ton duck noodle soups delicious especially cold wintery night  Service prompt attentive  decor nice well  return try other entrees  <EOR> Had Kung pao chicken lunch special $10  Quite deal great food  hot sour soup top notch! <EOR> Ondori offers plethora Japanese Chinese cuisine  give really big portions unbeatable price especially compared other casino restaurants  Service really good even though ordered seven dishes food came all once   The rainbow roll healthiest thing night  $15 pricier other sushi places  Presentation greatest but still tasted great  fish fresh rice perfect   A half order roasted duck $18 could feed two people  tasted very similar other Chinese duck dishes  Besides being oily can't complain flavor   The honey walnut shrimp $18 came plenty large shrimps fried batter sweet mayonnaise walnut drizzled top  favorite dish but can't over unhealthy mayonnaise was  would much preferred side instead top shrimp    The fried pork chops salt pepper $15 perfectly seasoned onions garlic  flavorful seasonings complemented tender pork chop which very easy chew tough all    The oxtail pot $21 came large pieces fatty oxtail meat  wasn't huge fan but tasted authentic   The kung pao scallops $19 came peppers onions peanuts slightly spicy sauce  scallops large but plentiful  enjoyed dish lot partly because most veggies all dishes    Would definitely recommend place large portions fresh food won't break bank! <EOR> This new Asian fusion restaurant opened few weeks ago    If think five star restaurant based three reviews please check again  Note all those reviews central theme indicating name servers well attended servers  little no mention food style quality   I place wife brother Sunday nite  arrived 6 pm but  told wait 15 minutes even though place pretty empty  Why?? enough servers??

WRONG  received everything once   another big pet peeve  food did take long arrive which SOUL reason 2 stars otherwise would given  5 stars if possible  server checked once asked spicy sauce    I never received another gentlemen brought 20 minutes later when done meal  currently waiting server show ask boxes  15 minutes counting said waiting    NEVER COMING BACK!
