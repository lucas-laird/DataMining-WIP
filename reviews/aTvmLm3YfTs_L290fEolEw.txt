Well apparently Zaba's bought stock when product under  Cardboard  basically salted cardboard  could forgive cheap disgusting chips if salsa any good but unfortunately fresh salsa sucked  tomatoes translucent looked frozen some point salsa verde flavorless disappointing  spending $30 burrito fish tacos two chips salsas two sodas took 6 bites I gave fair shot then next door Panda Express  If want good fresh Mexican food place  If want crappy knock off chipotle higher prices all means try Zaba's  <EOR> Very disappointed ! Very average! Poor choices very limited appealing eye  Cold chips sad salsa  <EOR> I love Zaba's! always quick nice here! All ladies wonderful!

I'll definitely come back try rest menu   So being said Happy Eatings! <EOR> Saw place opening recently talked couple people nearby bank it   both told similar Chipotle   definitely right   While think prefer quality Chipotle's ingredients options Zaba's more   Chipotle better rice barbacoa Zaba's shredded beef closest thing but Zaba's better chicken love potatoes well and they're good!    Zaba's spicy salsa really good too  cool thing if bowls but don't many ingredients give discount   think chicken bowl normally around $7 but since chicken rice cheese only only charged $5 it   Everyone told Zaba's larger portions Chipotle but didn't really sense bowls   Employees very cheery despite being very busy during big opening week   definitely heading back  <EOR> They best grilled shrimp tacos because build your own type place  love pick comes food   Try! never see long lines but really good think better place starts C  <EOR> This place rip off Chipotle except little more expensive tasty  also want charge extra everything including sour cream  <EOR> This place basically Qdoba knockoff   which basically Chipotle knockoff   which basically insult Mexican food  Also am basically insult Mexican food  Because all eat then write crappy reviews place nourished me   I actually liked but felt little expensive was  Don Tortaco just down street much better choice your wallet  Maybe your belt though  <EOR> very clean place eat ordered zaba half chicken half steak bowl also adrianna welcomed when arrived very pleasant karla manager offered tester best cucumber lime drink agua fresca ive ever tasted witch also serve sauza tequila another option deff would come back specially if same girls working here <EOR> Zabas most amazing burrito whole world  burritos size head veggies fresh  don't usually visit location but good too   Please notice all reviews meat eaters  only point because can't relate complaints  But if want slamming vegan burrito here    The veggie burrito $7 50 huge guac included  Besides cheap days?

Flavor wise delicious! ordered crunchy tacos when lady front putting rice beans meat she slopped over all 3 crunchy taco shells  Right away thought weird messy but didn't say anything thinking wasn't going affect them except maybe them being messy  left Togo order home which maybe 5 minutes away son situated  probably sat 10 minutes maybe 15  time ate them completely soggy soaked beans pork juice  couldn't even pick them up  lady put everything each individual shell wrapped them differently believe problem would eliminated  Super disappointing wanted crunch! <EOR> I place quick lunch  little Chipotle choose your ingredients down line  wish more vegetarian seafood options   Although say grilled shrimp delicious! <EOR> Depends most part but most staff location actually give good portions  all nice respectful also   But lately Rey singy   Just saw guy ask if he could more chips bag girl tried charge another bag      ridiculous barely any anyway  Just saying <EOR> I've driven before wondered if any good  Over weekend area looking something quick when decided stop in    On Sunday afternoon restaurant busy helped right away  took minute review board because quite few options  variety definitely better Chipotle  Pricing seemed reasonable options well  inside restaurant clean   I ordered bowl steak husband burrito  shared chips salsa Zalapeno balls  bowl good definitely tasted fresh but nothing overly special  husband same opinion burrito  chips salsa good  did really enjoy salsa  Zalapeno balls bland something would order again   Clean restaurant reasonable prices decent food  A OK option if area  <EOR> I've ate several times but today very disappointed  food cold ordered double chicken gave two very small scoops  rice old stuck together clumps  eating again  <EOR> I moved LV east coast year half ago  hometown awesome Southwest Mexican grill love just don't think Chipotle quite same  I'd searching something else caliber hometown grill finally found Zaba's  closest come! staff location generally kind food good enjoy atmosphere when eat in  think sometimes chicken little charred taste but over it  <EOR> Love place! food excellent staff well  Super friendly eager help  never disappoint! Zabas over Chipotle all day! <EOR> I'm glad opened place right me   Its basically Chipotle   few Chipotle locations Vegas quality going down yes admit Zaba's I'd say just good   pretty much all same options  sure some seasonings whatever might different but still basically same   however add potato option burritos guess whatever getting   burrito MASSIVE   Bigger Chipotle sure   still love Chipotle but none close its equal replacement  <EOR> I ordered tacos shredded beef meat cold would better off eating some leftovers fridge without reheating them never eat another Zaba's again  <EOR> Zabas only place now on   customer service great food delicious   love punch cards   Definitely place!  Double points Sunday love it!! <EOR> Zaba's Mexican Grill future husband's favorite place dine eat often  honest hugest fan  aren't many options wish he'd favorite another restaurant    The street tacos good  them every time! Street tacos come Corona which actually favorite beer  drink alcohol anymore would favorite thing Mexican Grill feels slap face   They specific self serve beverage bar coolest thing no joke serves probably 1000 soft drinks but eat Mexican food fill liquids  wish more food options more traditional Mexican beverage options other horchata    Also when step place order feel Mexican deli  reminds ordering Subway Pieology  <EOR> We came zabas receiving bogo coupon mail  enjoy Mexican food thought we'd give try  I'd eaten zabas inside  Plaza hotel before thought decent best  arrived 10 minutes 8pm turned away immediately rude fashion  kind fast food restaurant closes 8pm Las Vegas?!? wouldn't eat zabas when direct competition far better  Bad service bad hours mediocre food  <EOR> Late post but compliment amazing people catering  meeting clinic wanted Mexican!

Thanks would definitely recommend any catering most staff returned more food! <EOR> I've eating Zabas years! moved near zabas visit frequently  never really busy which love because out  rewards card every often meal FREE! worth signing if eat lot  Try chipotle ranch! <EOR> Amazing pesto lime shrimp tacos! deciding between chicken bowl because both looked amazing! definitely come again eat! <EOR> Such great food always fresh staff always friendly very knowledgeable definitely recommend back  <EOR> 2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 58 100  I've other locations throughout years but first time visiting one  chain mexican grill Chipotle  Service food decent    I carnitas bowl slow carb style 4 Hour Body  no rice black beans carnitas veggies  onions tomatoes few lime wedges    I love spicy handle heat but bad choice add both sauces spicy me! carnitas decent bad    Lots booth seating busy crowded  around 7pm Thursday night    Beers few alcoholic beverages served well  <EOR> If looking fresh food tasty delicious friendly staff visit Ori'Zaba's Maryland Silverado Ranch  Vegan options lots combinations  salsas every Day  <EOR> Good but overpriced  Burrito filled plenty  surf turf steak shrimp which fun don't see many other burrito spots  Burrito $12 which seemed little over priced  Also street cork which $4 change   Meal ended costing $25  Every guest came spoke Spanish maybe little more authentic?  Overall food good but overpriced  <EOR> The best Zabas too  Awesome service friendly staff clean environment  other zabas flamingo Pecos made ill  impressed all  <EOR> I'm sorry    place just does compare Chipotle  don't mean good just aren't comparable  way food just ok flavor wasn't really me  Maybe just ordered wrong thing but tried chicken bowl queso civeche corn  corn best part queso terrible civeche also just o k  $26 I'd rather something nicer  <EOR> 3 star average beloved Zaba's?  Say ain't so!   scan through all reviews myself prepared battle defend Zaba's honor but know know where most them coming from   location just opened April even most diehard Zaba's fans since visiting establishments since UNLV student over 15 years ago admit some shaky experiences early on    think few times month opened literally drove across town next nearest Zaba's fix     I'm happy report half year later everything fine well now!   shredded beef consistently seasoned liking a problem early on some newer staff members then little light handed portions since come around providing more bang buck     My usual order shredded beef salad corn green salsa but weekends splurge little burritos tacos    sour cream   cheese   chips   Okay always chips    find myself getting chicken location much used some other ones   tend when gets nice seasoned char more often doesn't look nice burnt exterior    charred chicken connoisseur    honest though find myself being upset chicken because deep down heart lies shredded beef anyway    Chipotle's Barbacoa but find Zaba's version usually superior especially when seasoned well which late been    Then green salsa better any Chipotle offers IMO      My only 2 disappointments follows 1 chips tasty but feel there's never enough salt them here  Finding salty chip bag sometimes difficult finding meaningful lyrics Justin Bieber song     2 Coca Cola Freestyle     PEOPLE!   2015    isn't thing anymore   But swear every 5 6 visits someone stares amazement portal Narnia    someone examine every option flavor Diet Coke Zero before settling Regular    Clearly Barqs Dr Pepper Cherry Coke only acceptable options anyhow      I've given praise before but let close review telling much love ZIP program here   every 10 entrees purchase free one    best part double point Sundays    if point come Sunday order say 2 entrees you're 40% way free entree    come much average free entree every week half    Another win common man  <EOR> We've just moved into neighborhood around Zabas coming East coast needed new Qdoba equivalent!

Service friendly nice when super chatty start lol   Atmosphere clean tables amenities customers  This regular spot <EOR> This absolutely favorite Zabas! Best food customer service! can't wait next Vegas trip eat favorite place  would truly recommend place anyone visiting Vegas <EOR> This fresher version Chipotle without food poisoning   opinion better locations such Henderson but food usually good quality    chicken bowl built your liking 11 bucks drink    The service location mediocre but incompetent   dining area small laid very weird   Zabas but least favorite location date  <EOR> Haven't gone Chipotle since tried Zaba's  Love quality freshness options  Only downside pricing bit high certain things shrimp salad  <EOR> I eating Zabas least 10 years now visiting Silverado ranch location once twice week since opened  am fan  really stepped game recently new management  Tons new options discounts quality seems improved  Also customer service top notch now if see someone  giving subpar service good chance won't see them your next visit   I used 50 50 Chipotle Zabas but recently Chipotle's meat bland 20 80 now  <EOR> Great food  Great Service  Lady Blue Hair Wonderful  Will come back  Store clean employees knowledgeable <EOR> I come lunch often   just down road work fast convenient delicious   never issue service cleanliness establishment  <EOR> Horrible customer service Karla cashier couldn't care less order ask large small queso continued move order behind asking something else very disappointed zabas know <EOR> All food looked fresh vibrant but tasted completely bland  steak burrito rice beans pico green sauce sour cream  salt shaker saved lunch but weird having salt burrito every few bites  <EOR>
