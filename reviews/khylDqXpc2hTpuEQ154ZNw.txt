She finally brings back realize still don't forks knives  Whatever hunt down bring back table  The pizza bottom pan crust actually tastes sort saltine cracker   Even looked little one   Weird but otherwise completely unremarkable crust  sauce tasted cheapo special junk grocery store  cheese good least used plenty it  peperoni mushrooms however weren't really good   Overall overpriced pizza mediocre quality  Next please! <EOR> Pizza good other round tables  Seemed cooked fast crust typically undercooked many fast food pizzas   want say guys working very friendly nice  Also salad bar pretty good   UPDATE 5 13 2011 appreciate comment Roy F  sign good customer service would return try restaurant again  problem live California  visited trip Vegas family  next review wait until return again    Thanks though Roy  best wishes! <EOR> Love place  Since Shakey's no longer exists Vegas become next best thing  crust perfect thin sauce perfect pie's always come those air bubbles crust      love it!
