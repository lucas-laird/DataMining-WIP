Sure lake view side beautiful but little puzzled place gets business if location nearly secretive everything else west side Vegas? Well location sort does seem cafe sort atmosphere would find California but really did wish location would more open area!  Compared east side area very cramped small once again California cafe esque type atmosphere   food just delicious Windmill quite extensive selection books location even more privatized area browse unlike Windmill cafe   staff seemed really good relations locals come since day seemed revolving door people knew each other most happy which made felt little more homey location     Same great menu location just real pain to! <EOR> my fav row cafe Las Vegas I usually salad green juice here  If its cold outside its nice eat outside  lake front restaurant enjoy view well  <EOR> Love place!  Its great such raw organic local place Vegas!  location perfect overlooking lake can't help but love food juice selection    The only reason 5 starts because juice way over priced skimp beets! = much more affordable juices home  <EOR> If enjoy raw vegan living cuisine then you     Personally enjoy raw vegan more cooked vegan vegetarian   more gourmet quality me     I've visited both store other store East side Las Vegas   all sorts dishes smoothies juices all tasty well presented satisfying     If you've never tasted raw vegan dishes then treat yourself   suspect you'll very pleasantly surprised   Your body certainly love it   Just don't expect $5 meal   Prepared raw at restaurant always found bit more pricey  expected fresh organic prep  <EOR> Love beet burger! texture also good!
