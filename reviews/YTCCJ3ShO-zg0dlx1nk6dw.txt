Thank Chef Morimoto!!! <EOR> Wow! Detta är min favoritrestaurang när det kommer till japansk mat  Kvalitén och känslan här inne är något alldeles extra och det osar lyx och trevligt  En perfekt upplevelse helt enkelt  Men kostsam!  Morimoto lyckades med sin extremt höga kvalité att konvertera en sällskapet som var tveksam till sushi och inte särskilt förtjust japansk mat till en Sushi älskare! Oerhört stort utbud av hög kvalité för alla smaker och preferenser  Det går inte att gå fel med deras sushimeny   Desserten ska inte vi inte ens prata om! Den kommer med en egen show form av brinnande effekter och smälter framför dig till din förvåning för att sedan stelna och bilda ett chokladlager blandat med likör  Oerhört god stekig och häftig var chokladbolldesserten   Nästa gång vi befinner oss Vegas kommer vi givetvis tillbaka hit  En upplevelse alla måste få vara med om  Missa bara inte den häftiga desserten som brinner! <EOR> I enjoyable dinner during trip Vegas CES  menu contains standard Morimoto fare modern Japanese fusion fare essentially clone Napa NYC locations  rock shrimp tempura solid selection nigiri ordered fairly high quality well fresh cuts although nothing ordinary   Service very friendly attentive wide variety wines beers sakes cocktails offer well  However did find myself wishing greater variety sushi somewhat disappointed omakase available  being said place definitely decent option if you're looking decent quality sushi upscale Japanese fare  <EOR> Hmmmm  following chef Morimoto since early Iron Chef days  very excited try food romantic dinner big mistake!!!  8 00 inside restaurant much noisier casino slot machines  When server brought appetizer she lean over table yell tell she brought!

Vegetables $12 noodles $12 steak hibachi forget it    bill wine charged $38!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yeah paid hightailed taking glass all did pay it   turnoff place charging outrageous prices am sure mediocre food    next store Craftsteak  <EOR> Amazing experience  food perfect! couldn't asked better more knowledgeable waitress Christine  setting comfortable lighting just right  ate lobster perfect  lobster day before Emeril's far no comparison flavor preparation Morimoto  would recommend restaurant anyone appreciate good quality food service  <EOR> Morimoto big disappointment  Besides service great everything else lacked  ordered 30 piece sashimi $150 honestly presentation nice but taste anything amazing  better fresher fish other places  steak $100 again big disappointment  nothing special ribeye lot fat  lot usually trim serve customers  Meat good but overall price would ever again  also yellowtail appetizer cut thick again chewy  dessert only thing would back for second menu mango something  super good   Overall besides dessert never again  Spending $650 dinner 4 people all leaving bitter taste mouths good sign  am giving 3 stars because service dessert  <EOR> Step apparent high end spot  group ordered set meal where try variety appetizers entrees  Overall food amazing should've since $120 per person  Definitely priciest meals had  service friendly but pretty slow  whole meal took 2 hours getting bill took very long time  <EOR> My previous review Morimoto No1DP appreciates Iron Chef Morimoto due fusion elements cuisine  Turns family eat without NYE 2017 enjoyed much everyone wanted back next visit  Because able back two reviews focus two core aspects restaurant  While first review focuses fusion elements restaurant review focuses social group dining element restaurant literally almost every dish serve small plates item   According waiter Nicole Morimoto best experienced three different ways small plates due emphasis hot cold appetizers sushi sashimi due separate menu entrees focus fusion elements but added steak option little example Vegas decadence  could've done omakase option significantly cheaper but liked having independence ordering whatever dishes wanted  Through suggestions waiter able partake all plates fairly   DRINK Thai Basil Smash Hendricks gin St  germain pineapple Thai basil hibiscus $17   sweet cocktail hides taste gin  Could taste pineapple but basil   TRUE APPETIZERS Cold Tuna pizza anchovy aioli olives jalapeno $23 Yellowtail 'pastrami' togarashi gin creme fraiche candied olive morimoto grapeseed oil $24 The emphasis quality fish  Instead ordering sushi sashimi pure fish incorporated into fusion cuisine appetizer  tuna pizza works great because aioli normally strong doesn't overpower fish  Same thing yellowtail togarashi creme fraiche  Only thing bad candied olive tough   Hot Kakuni x2 10 hour pork belly rice congee soy scallion jus $21 Rock shrimp tempura spicy kochujan sauce wasabi aioli $23 more filling cold appetizers  Pork belly very savory filling its own hence best separated into small parts  Congee helps digestion such rich meat  Tempura good but only if your party appreciates wasabi Korean pepper paste which very dominating spicy parts any food  Luckily parents made mild but would've appreciated something stronger   ENTREES SHARED PLATES Whole roasted lobster garam masala lemon creme fraiche $56   Garam masala worked addition vegetables  Wish creme fraiche came earlier would complement garam masala strong flavor itself  Crispy whole fish spicy tofu sauce papaya salad $43   help Nicole she split fish easier eat  Luckily lot bones fish soft flaky  Tofu sauce spicy  Japanese A 5 Wagyu $35 oz 3oz minimum   What's notable dish wagyu ordered three ways NY Strip cut ribeye cut filet cut  ribeye cut  high quality otoro meat literally dissolves your mouth eat due high marble  experienced any other wagyu even Japan hence gold standard wagyu  Ishi yaki buri bop yellowtail rice cooked tableside hot stone bowl $38   If you've eaten plenty Asian restaurants you'll realize literal description dish fatty yellowtail buri bibim bap served ishiyaki dolsot style  If you've read reviews love buri dolsot bibimbap right away fell dish  also appropriate closing dish due carb  Fried egg necessary  Chinese broccoli $10   Tough bit plain but necessary between strong umami flavors each mains   DESSERT Tutti fruiti toro guava pineapple gelee tropical fruit sorbets $16   Identical famous appetizer toro tartare gelee counterpart toro  also eaten identically appetizer combination gelee + sorbet much better together sum its parts  Chilled cheesecake souffle blood orange meringue strawberry red wine sorbet $16   souffle small five people  citrus meringue worked fluffy cheesecake   Even Vegas standards Morimoto certainly cheap meal  contribution including tax tip came almost $200 person  Ever since all parents' kids started working choices fine dining expanded family loves wagyu much pay money eat wagyu can't fly Japan often do  back because execution fusion cuisine best seen  Japanese fusion emphasis quality ingredients  <EOR> Attempted twice find closed lunch don't seat 10pm weeknights thrilled tonight  Supposably only reservation available yet many tables sat empty while there  sure behind that  Best attribute dining experience presentation food  All picture quality  Table next did 6 course fixed mela $140 while expensive dining experience looked exquisite  Edamame $14 really expensive but very fresh tasting  Made mistake asking spice sauce second order tasted horrible but didn't return since asked it  Presentation sashimi dinner  Salad ribs all picture worthy  Wasn't impressed service all  poured own champagne most night even thought bottle empty even thou turned over because every waiter just ignored refilling glasses  Waiter didn't entertain much flexibility  First answers no substitutes no   Asked plug cell phone waiter said they'd ask but never game back answer  won't eat less $100 pp food worth but service    <EOR> Slighty shocked amazing reviews restaurant then comparison actual reality  Maybe its because living westside LA completely spoils Japanese food elsewhere but all food felt merely adequate  easily beaten cheaper options LA Sugarfish sushi just okay those standards    What okay price  menu eyewateringly expensive thought Nobu pricier side  Frankly much better meal Nobu similar price felt worth it  left getting feeling id just mugged  <EOR> Best steak ever had  Hands down! No words describe feel place  know only trying vegetarian 2 weeks now but if take place might give in  only place I'd eat meat again  Damn Morimoto being great  Damn you     <EOR> The best food experience ever!!!! came dinner company 7 friends  didn't order food just left recommendations waiter  waiter awesome very professional! He knew every aspect menu restaurant!  And food! OMG!!! food orgasm! delicious! Everything he brought table unbelievably good! We definitely come back! <EOR> Service excellent  Drink selection impressive  oysters literally smallest I'd ever seen life  guess seems silly thing comment but disappointing  probably size quarter I'd embarrassed serve that  sushi good  Nothing particularly notable but good  Shishito peppers best had  didn't steak can't comment that  Overall pleasant experience but I'd try something else next time stay MGM  <EOR> I quick simple come sushi Iron chef caliber very disappointed thinly sliced ok tasting  Good entrees excellent dessert appetizers won't back  Excellent services but $$  expected! <EOR> @Chef_Morimoto opened Morimoto Las Vegas MGM Grand fantastic time recently BFF boyfriend love keep place spotless just opened yesterday    Beautiful layout high ceiling lounge bar when first walk then long sushi bar another dining room back perfect private event  Beef display case see through glass wine cellar 3 D status chef Morimoto nice wooden table gigantic photo arts work behind sushi bar floor ceiling impressive!

Wagyu A 5 just melts your mouth  Everything amazing appetizers sushi main course meals! people ranked less 4 stars know good food  Glad ate before left! Hats off Iron Chef Morimoto! <EOR> This best celebrity chef restaurants Las Vegas  Most them town often fell short expectation  Overall loved hot appetizers entrees sushi desserts   For appetizers wife ordered Oyster foie Gras combination oysters door gras uni amazing  first piece thinking need order few more these  Laksa noodle soup such comforting dish  egg flavorful curry soup well balanced wonderful curry flavor little kick but spicy   Pork belly congee piece pork tender  Entrees Braised black cod piece fish perfectly cooked chop sticks just slid into fish without any effort part  cod moist ginger soy reduction spot on  Seafood pot dish little spicy but  made dish great spicy but overpoweringly hot lobster broth made all seafood pot tasted better  We also order few pieces nigiri good but favorite sushi restaurant Las Vegas offer cheaper but better sushi  won't order them next time  For dessert ordered chocolate tarte soufflé tasted fine looked beautiful but just amazing  Good great  For next few days dinner morimot wife kept talking experience planning next visit  good  must try Las Vegas  <EOR> One tastiest meals Vegas  Iron Chef level flavors service match  Note although place plenty sushi options need experience cooked main dishes fully recognize place special  sea urchin foie gras oyster mind blowing white fish carpaccio  Table side bibimbap preparation also great filling enough 2 people  Rev all Vegas options place would definitely come back again  <EOR> The sushi extremely fresh just melts your mouth  Service fast waitress Katie knowledgeable!

When made reservation well advance host asked if celebrating special occasion  Yes! When fine dining restaurant asks special occasion means acknowledged some way complimentary drinks dessert sometimes even small gift  chose restaurant Morimoto special occasion just reason  Guess got? Bupkis  host said Happy Birthday checked it  No other acknowledgement special service  advance reservation awarded table just few feet away restroom entrance  floor show all evening people using facilities including green faced young woman running bathroom hand clapped over mouth sushi novice? We'll never know   The food mixed bag  started off wonderful appetizers tuna pizza Omakase tuna tartare both delicious  downhill overcooked lobster less fresh sushi worst off all dried large lump fake wasabi wasn't even blended properly  If given tiniest amount freshly ground wasabi difference would made! faux wasabi lump insult meal us   Our server personable enough but minimal service throughout meal definitely you'd expect $$$ restaurant  server did check back appetizers served then he chatted bit before bringing check  Since no warm towels offered use own hand wipes wrappers never cleared table  Once servers spilled little tea table never wiped up  many details huge difference dining experience  <EOR> You easily reservation through OpenTable app! recommend making reservations because full during certain nights  app says dress code business casual but looking around ate could away dressing little more casual  Located MGM Grand hotel hard miss restaurant because all beautiful lights surrounding it!  To start koshihikari echigo beer $15 favorite Japanese beers glad here! sister mango matcha punch $17 very delicious! alcohol subtle strong fruit tea taste  She said easily best cocktail she's ever had!  For appetizers entrees  Sticky ribs Each order comes 3 pieces added 2 extra pieces since 5 total became $37  expecting but ribs slid right off bone melted into mouths  Absolutely amazing definitely recommend dish! Kakuni $22 Pork belly over congee! sweet savory overall pleasant dish! never dish anywhere else while really dish  easy share lot people would recommend dish because flavor tender pork belly is  Ishi yaki chashu bop $39 Chashu pork over rice hot stone bowl  mix when bring table mix sesame soy sauce  Very yummy flavorful! Ishi yaki buri bop $38 Hamachi yellowtail fish over rice hot stone bowl  also mix your table opinion better chashu bop if fish! hamachi perfectly cooked! Duck duck goose $42 mix duck confit fried rice duck goose  Great if duck goose meat  If you're getting fried rice then I'd suggest duck confit rice side dish $13   also egg excellent flavor pretty much same size! Sushi combination $55 Chef's choice assorted nigiri! came 10 pieces nigiri 6 piece tuna roll  wish fish more fresh but sadly didn't wow me  Very typical standard fish  rice kept falling apart hard pick up  $55 portion bad but little disappointed  comparable omakase Japan even San Francisco    For dessert tried tofu mousse $15 cheesecake soufflé $16   Both delicious definitely liked cheesecake soufflé more!  Overall think kitchen food much better sushi  would recommend coming ordering those dishes!! Yes more pricey but you're Vegas high price tag also comes service also because Morimoto name  service excellent server Berto great orecommendations friendly!
