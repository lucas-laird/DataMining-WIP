Can't believe am writing review coming being extremely satisfied service quality employees quality food  coming years often people know recognize pretty much order without telling them want    Today changes sadly no longer able come back  walked into restaurant today cooks front getting drink  soon walked he looked yelled gringo back cooks  Everyone started laughing he couldn't keep smile off face  Instead reacting wanted ripping half toothless face off racist head just looked disbelief ordered food  guy usually running show didn't seem happy  Understandably  very unfortunate reputation company honostly owning marketing company could probably some damage but won't because sure owner company doesn't put sort nonsense    Hopefully something racist working them all racist thought funny  kinda weird racism would come some hispanics especially country way is  Guess just shitty ass people all walks life  bad  <EOR> This place inhuman size portions  salty  Much more authentic its competition  Very inexpensive well  family enjoyed food  service very quick   probably never Super Burrito again thanks Laurita's  <EOR> I LOVE PLACE!! This favorite burrito place  better Roberto's especially customer service  most amazing California burrito al pastor  Heck Roberto's no substitutions least Bermuda Cactus won't even if your willing pay extra  Don Tortaco look del taco way food top quality worth every penny!  carne Asada fries legit! won't sorry  <EOR> Been coming years  place definitely step above Roberto's but exactly best mexican food  Though area probably best bang your buck  husband San Diego he's tasted enough mexican fast food chains  He frequently said offers pretty good food easily rivals SD mexican fast food    We always nachos al pastor plate and or cali burrito  nachos always came pretty good  Sometimes put much cheese but least always put generous amount meats  <EOR> I love rice bowl! taste amazing! Its very affordable if taste surely come back again    Keep up! <EOR> We pass place all time finally checked out  When first walked hit smell incense very powerful cologne!! needless say did smell Mexican food almost walked due husband being able handle Asthma  Thats bad was  Needless say did place order  person counter nice kinda busy  ordered 3 rolled tacos guac  3 bean cheese burritos 1 bean rice cheese burrito 2 drinks  We sat down wait  could date fix area sit could clean Salsa bar  But waited more more people came in  I loved rolled tacos chicken guac  guac flavor great  husband loved burritos especially homemade flour tort  Im picky refried beans personally sure if theres! But try again decide  say green salsa really good <EOR> Straight bomb Mexican food! Everything bomb  chimichangas point  Laurtia burrito big your arm     street tacos ones TJ  prices even close Taco Bell why real deal  <EOR> Love place! Cheap good hell else could want? Best breakfast burritos anywhere  <EOR> I really wanted able give place better review but just can't   gave multiple visits   tried really did   But end there're two reasons where eventually came those being food nickle dime attitude   First regarding food some things place does well   example carne asada generally prepped well don't lot gristle carne de miscellaneous it    good thing   Also regular quesadilla very tasty reasonably priced get   Finally hot sauce salsa roja    other hand beans flavorless failure   carnitas ooze enough grease Exxon Valdez look Sierra Club member's kayak   fry off tacos oil wrong temperature tacos emerge having sucked much oil they're reminiscent something  fracked Bakken Shale   Worse though nickel dime approach which just insulting town Las Vegas   example only refill your soda which soda priced 50% above other similar places   further refills apparently buy whole new soda   Also if want any modifications your order prepared bleed them   example upcharge onions onions! item 60 cents   Thus while base price particular item might fine if want change anything add ons upcharges bear zero resemblance actual cost addition modification   end between hit or miss inconsistency food tacky bang the customer attitude sorry but two stars very best do  <EOR> I used love place until started close 12am  work late off work late try some food but they're closed  Yet they're signing front says 24 hours open  False advertisement  need take down stupid sign  <EOR> Fresh delicious every single time! Love rolled tacos chicken  <EOR> Identical Robertos    pay pretty damn cheap don't understand some complaints here   Great quick fix  really it     Wife usually orders fish tacos normally carne asada fries nachos   Both seem par $8 meal   If you're looking little more     suck drive Cafe Rio  <EOR> Use roberto's but now ae much cleaner food seems much better   Friendly people fast service  <EOR> The BEST Mexican food yet Las Vegas!  I tamale rolled tacos  The tamale came dressed sauce cheese tomato other goodies! Very yummy!  The rolled tacos also very delicious filling! Would totally come back again! <EOR> I taco Tuesday  $1 chicken potato tacos  chicken tacos ok     potato tacos tasty  But I'd rather pay more double shredded beef tacos  Those much better!  Their beans rice good   Service just another taco shop people hardly speak English walk counter fast food  Well  Mexican fast food  <EOR> This place terribly inconsistent hours     First all seems bad luck every time choose late night tacos advertised 24 7 taco shop happen closed    worst all am showing 4 am  currently 1 20am now am way Robertos  <EOR> After pondering whether Roberto's try Laurita's wife finally landed trying new hole wall  very happy results    If you've read Mexican Food reviews past know key heart through bean cheese burrito  Something simple often times bad  travesty really  wasn't sure expect Laurita's  establishment itself used Roberto's still sports some old Roberto's attire  Fortunately bean burrito isn't anything Roberto's    They numerous specials ridonkulously cheap prices  coke bean cheese burrito churro mere price $3 99  Holy guacamole cheap! beans very good burritto could used some extra cheese since did pay extra cheese   beans piping hot burrito massive  could barely finish it  Top off churro just notch below Disneyland churro now we're talking good meal  wife wet bean cheese burrito  She definitely liked personally didn't care enchilada sauce I prefer more cherry red colored sauce little darker but bad according her     The service surprisingly good  Can't say much good service Taco Shops but gentleman running register filling drinks providing refills exceptionally friendly  Much appreciated!   I'll definitely back burrito Laurita's  <EOR> So girl squad yes  ourselves lame know try come taco Tuesday every chance mainly because brings back much memories  Anyway enough sappy stuff  biggest fan environment itself sometimes there's enough enough tables booths could messy times but workers always quick clean everything once chance  does busy but just show go to place because convenient prices inexpensive just quick bite some yummy Mexican food! would recommend California burrito street tacos carne asada fries  but don't forget green sauce best stuff there!!   Tuesday special $1 00 hard shell potato chicken taco  They're both delicious! little greasy   but still good  Also heads up    24 7 sign advertises  <EOR> Best pescado taco town! prices fantastic quality ingredients portions  veggie bar carrots cucumbers fresh! homemade sauces super tasty  Very impressed  much better yucky Robertos  going back soon  <EOR> This place good chimichangas burritos but tacos great  staff quick but sometimes attentive special requests  several times where asked no guacamole still received it  <EOR> I always chicken chimichanga platter never disappointed  now go to place middle night instead Don tortaco which am sad say offered very wet soaked dribbling burritos last few times there  Cleanliness OK  Service pretty good  Doesn't take long food  <EOR> Love $1 chicken taco deal Tuesdays  tasty great deal  dining area small but serve em fast  keep coming back  <EOR> Its alright  Honestly its no different Robertos Filibertos any other bertos to    That being said fine food when you're craving filling food late hour    or any hour matter open 24 hours every day   It's right house twice past 2 weeks  time chicken burrito meat rather dry but next time carne asada freakin' tasty!
