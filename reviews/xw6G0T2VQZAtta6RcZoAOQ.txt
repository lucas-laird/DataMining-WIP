If applied then should know your getting yourselves into  if don't want deal people find different job!! <EOR> Cafe Rio chain  am going review food because good California Idaho Utah a comment franchise they're very strong keeping food tasting consistent quality high    This location always fairly busy  hit 1 00 PM Monday waited line 15 minutes  If there's long line does move fast but lightning fast patient  kind don't play your iPhone line hold things up  Know want order or sample when counter person behind doesn't contemplate smacking back head   The employees pretty great most part  There's few lemons bunch aren't always? but generally they're helpful positive willing let sample oh dear samples     Must do's if you're into whole wheat thing ask try those tortillas they're very good  Ask punch card keep buy 10 meals free somehow free meal just tastes even better it should taste worse considering you've spent $100 now Cafe Rio   where paycheck goes   <EOR> Compared Henderson locations slow dirty less friendly  Only writing more because Yelp requiring it  <EOR> Living Buffalo never eat anymore miss much! wish would open here!! All friends love it   The pork good dressing never fails  yummy tummy always whenever West but please open Buffalo NY!!!x <EOR> Never anything bad!  First choice tortilla soup    Perfectly filling high calories some other menu items   Second choice chx nachos aghhhh bad but oh good! Perfect share! said before everything amazing!  Pork awesome well perfectly sweet! Salads freshtastic depending actually healthy   Substitute dressing salsa fresca just delicious! If dining try strawberry lemonade   yummy   only thing say is    actually never dessert here   place! <EOR> If you're ever mood craving Mexican food highly suggest Cafe Rio! different specials change often but never wrong specials  Sometimes just bag tortilla chips salsa plus queso  item would highly HIGHLY suggest getting burrito enchilada style  Now heavy eater can't even tame beast  all Cafe Rio places Vegas all them seem packed around 11am 6pm but staff all work well team sure line moving! Only reason being four stars 2 empty tables filled trash having workers just leave aside can't wrong  If you're first timer would recommend getting burrito  burrito choose 12 Flour Tortilla Wheat tortilla then select your protein which range shredded chicken grilled chicken sweet pork barbacoa YUMMY roasted beef grilled salmon fire grille steak  Next choose if want black pinto means rice  sure enchilada style they pour your choice sauce top your burrito  ranges tomatillo mild green chile medium red chile sauce hot   Afterwards they'll put salad pico de gallo side  <EOR> Love place!
