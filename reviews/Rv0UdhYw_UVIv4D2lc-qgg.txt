Service good food stupendous!  Definitely recommend people come! Employees really good serving  restaurant Las Vegas  If your Korean there  Recommending it  <EOR> I very excited place when first opened but didn't chance go  Despite fact friend family bad experience place decided pay visit    The first time good guess hungry dying nothing complain about    The second time yesterday service terrible  Even though food actually bad say because waitress yes calling name out Sunny friend decided wouldn't come back again    At first ordered oxtail soup mini bosam everything fine  Then 2nd friend came ordered kalbi tang which beef short rib soup non spicy  waitress asked wether wanted soup bone boneless even though though weird since kalbi tang never came boneless said yes  came very fast soup red  asked them again before even touched soup said beef soup  Okay dived ate still very confused because thought broth should clear  half way tasted meat didn't taste beef all  friend couldn't eat pork very confused moment if kalbi tang ordered  waitress came again asked if any problems until moment she still nice us    However moment said wasn't correct ordered kalbi tang which whatever spicy soup eating she gave very bad attitude  no apology she started lecture us  no such thing proper customer service all  Nothing Let see  let ask manager help but instead she saying quote Just know your friend pointed picture why brought out! Well fact pointed picture but said something else she should clarified us!! Indeed confirmed wanted Kalbi tang she still brought something ordered  did ask again before touched letting know beef soup already lie    I really don't know say moment all wanted take soup item off check yet received nothing but bad service  She said she couldn't take item off machine because ate half way already because she stated fault  kind customer service that? No apology arguing customers? didn't want big deal didn't ask manager she even ended ringing check wrong even clearly explained divide it    I love place because most food very homemade Korean food kind your mom cook home  But service without doubt most definitely unacceptable   I don't usually write review typically just rate store but time experience bad type customer service cannot unheard of  <EOR> Best Korean restaurant town far  Flavorful ultra tender  order bossam sul lang tang let down slightest  won't going anywhere else anymore  <EOR> The food good but service poor   I've only twice but food seems worth dealing bad service  second time group 4 waited total 18 minutes server take order  A lone man seated table wasn't given water ten minutes  He eventually received water menu  another five minutes trying attention server he left  hungry felt lucky enough order food should stayed enjoy it  Unfortunately brought wrong dish member party wait even longer  please work your service? no sense urgency your staff  Most restaurants wait but Tangtangtang bit extreme! back we're hoping see improvement quality service  <EOR> I Vegas least twice year business trade show  Sometime sick buffet American foods typical found Strip looking good Korean restaurant  found one! little bit drive Strip but worth trip  Cleanliness service excellent   I come back when am back Vegas  <EOR> We eager excited try TangTangTang based glowing 5 star Yelp reviews  reality didn't meet expectations  extremely disappointed  typically don't write bad reviews except case where bad experience larger more established restaurant  However think need leave honest review help offset all suspicious 5 star reviews restaurant   The Good Some food items pretty good  Dumpling soup kimchi jap chae better your average Korean restaurant   The Bad Their signature dish bone broth noodles worst dish night  Maybe acquired taste but thought broth tasted unseasoned bone water  noodle protein portions also really small $10+  ordered both oxtail brisket just wasn't much there  Oh messed white rice  overcooked porridgey mess  Serving sub par rice Asian restaurant should huge red flag    The Ugly The service just awful  severely understaffed only 2 servers entire restaurant  Even empty tables took forever seat even longer order  servers would avoid eye contact because overworked  also large party 18% gratuity which fine except don't POS system properly set apply 18% math yourself  may proper policy but just crappy customer service  <EOR> I stumbled into restaurant while visiting Las Vegas   If looking authentic great quality Korean food place   Compared other Korean restaurants price quite reasonable given large portion side dishes   come again next time am Vegas  <EOR> Great fresh food excellent service! steamed pork along your ox tail soup! <EOR> Everything sollongtang gamjatang yookgaejang delicious!

Prices above average but Korean food generally cheap  Some soups come unlimited noodle refills   I few times thoroughly enjoyed all various soups stews!  If Korean food and or soup fan highly recommend checking place out! <EOR> Very interesting cuisine  skeptical first but meal delicious loved way heat creeps you  Atmosphere clean fresh  Service good pricing reasonable  would highly recommend place  <EOR> Selected place because rates highly Yelp! well deserved! If looking delicious authentic Korean something other boring BBQ then give place try    We stopped around 11 30 Saturday  strip malls China Town but plenty parking  large inside but open when arrived seated promptly    Kids mandu dumpling soup exceptional  mandu handmade kimchi inside  soup base delicious included strips beef  Wife Kam Ja Tang tasted unbelievably delicious    Easy access good service fair prices GREAT food highly recommend!! <EOR> I found it! Authentic Korean comfort food  Growing Korea food then coming America hard find good place same flavors  brisket seolongtang hot soup refreshing! served bowl rice vermicelli noodles also which filled much  Just Korea small container sea salt sprinkled some soup    My husband BBQ Pork Ribs delicious also  Good amount food ate family style sharing soup rice ribs     Banchan large variety but no worries good! japchae dry good flavor  radish kimchi favorite! Even though variety wasn't large good enough perfect combo any dishes ordered    The service good  friendly accommodating  give pitcher water Just Korea way good amount water  satisfied whenever craving soup immediately where think of  bit drive since live North West but hey maybe open there! But now occasional drive once WHILE    Give place try honestly if don't know eat ask best dish proper way enjoy little bummed  <EOR> Food great  tried below items Steam pork 5* Braised spicy beef rib 3* Beef brisket soup 3* Grill pork bulgogi 4* Beef short rib soup 3* Rice cake dumpling soup 2* Chilled buckwheat noodle 5* Pork back soup *3  Service 2*  Highly recommend steam pork chilled buckwheat noodle! serve three side dishes 2 kinds kimchi japchae  Which well made  frequently visited restaurant since opened but service gone down  Since restaurant busier older heavier server woman became rude attitude toward customers  She seemed really grumpy didn't seem want work  Made feel very uncomfortable  <EOR> The Kalbi Soup best town   servers all friendly   also remember last trip   am impressed  <EOR> With Kkulmat Korean Kitchen TangTangTang opening recent weeks Korean food Las Vegas taken turn better  While KBBQ all over place recently opened restaurants taken towards improving scene non BBQ restaurants hit miss most them lean towards being bars before restaurants   There few options around Las Vegas good Korean food but Kkulmat TangTangTang legitimately taste Korea cooking very little no lean towards fusion  When eat places think mom's best dishes eating Korea perhaps Koreatown LA   TangTangTang only open couple weeks but word seems getting Sulleongtang specialized place Chinatown  very professional wall signs made suspicious chain established base somewhere else couldn't help but ask learned locations Korea  probably isn't mom pop lot Korean restaurants but brings some history established menu   Sulleongtang an ox bone soup light flavor add your own salt green onions whatever kimchi radish you'd like Naengmyun Buckwheat noodles served spicy sauce ice cold broth Ddukguk rice cake soup optionally dumplings such Galbijjim a stew featuring braised short ribs rich thick broth veggies among dozen options featured menu varities almost all   also Bossam which isn't particularly common which steamed pork belly served along condiments traditionally eating wrapped lettuce though didn't wrapping lettuce when tried it  Additionally some BBQ plates LA Galbi   We haven't chance try everything and probably wouldn't ever try all but Sulleongtang solid  found broth little thinner lighter flavor ideal for best ever nothing competes Han Bat Los Angeles but when mixed all still creates marriage flavors very satisfying  Don't shy adding salt green onions throwing your rice kimchi  thing particularly nice brisket best type soup it's often afterthought compared other parts dish   Oh kimchi delicious strong garlic flavor satisfying sweetness it   My personal favorite far actually Kimchi Dumpling Dduk rice cake soup  ton flavor enhancing flavor Dduk Dumplings very satisfying  egg brisket complete dish well    The Bossam quite good though felt pork belly little overcooked  Instead being melt your mouth meat tad tough  When eating piece more fat meat little better   Lastly tried Gamjatang Hot Pot form shared  Pork neck bone stew personal favorite but pretty decent meat falling off bone plenty potatoes other veggies lots spices added  Still little much work eat!  Service quite adequate servers generally top things  However note first day Sulleongtang running Bossam smaller portion  place hasn't open long understandable if little frustrating  Still didn't take away experience able try more dishes way   Prices definitely reasonable Sulleongtang alone plenty feed person priced 9 99  Other dishes generally around same price little more expensive most individual portion sizes exceeding 11 99 while bigger share sized stews hitting almost 30 dollars Galbijjim which normally quite expensive nearly 40 dollars    I surprised place didn't much coverage but nearly every table occupied lunch Saturday think word getting there  I'd recommend place anyone looking some solid Korean food isn't fusion bar food BBQ along Kkulmat definitely upped quality available options Las Vegas  If haven't tried type Korean food you're definitely missing out!  Now just need some better Jajangmyun places! <EOR> Love love love!!! Best Korean pork bone soup! never Korea but think place authentic get! back next time I am Vegas  <EOR> This place AWESOME  Tang Korean means stew soup  Hence all soup options here  Originally came because thought served seafood tofu soup but don't even menu  ordered yookaejang spicy beef soup mool nengmyun cold noodles   cold noodles very good but dish tastes same everywhere order it  gave meat 4 5 years ago but boyfie enjoying spicy beef soup much few spoons it  REALLLLLY good  tasted much mom's thrilled!
