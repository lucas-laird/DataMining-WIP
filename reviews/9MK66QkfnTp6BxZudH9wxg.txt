Capriottis usually really good consistent food but shop very customer service friendly  the issue always service here  Today tired call place order lunch which 30 min long    I called place order she put hold 11 min hung called back called back 8 times called them EIGHT TIMES 11 30 afternoon Tuesday no answered phone going here? spent 20 min 30 min lunch just trying order food  some shameful shit capriottis together  <EOR> Best sandwich town trust  east coast thing  All ingredients used fresh! <EOR> Just absolutely never returning again!! shame because something different fun came Eastside  remember when locale opened    What shame come 20 mins closing told no more rolls  Uh huh! Yeah sure   person didn't count person car trouble right outside shop  decided stay help  watched same person told no more rolls sandwiches himself   would know that?? Because no else showed long past closing time  fact same man lied also ran talk ride while still wearing food service gloves   Then watched package sandwiches then he started cleaning front counter   Apparently location no longer interested making money keeping customers   am extremely pissed because he cheated children good dinner happened late night  Thanks much  <EOR> As good gets! Capastrami ultimate favorite  Super tasty pretty much best sandwich Vegas  <EOR> Normally love place but today might last time come location absolutely HORRIBLE service!! young girl Selena shirt doesn't greet busy talking boyfriends then actually making sandwiches  She rude shouldn't allowed work customer service  Two other people walked waited maybe 3 4mins before acknowledged  She didn't even charged she asked hardworking coworker charge me  When waiting other coworker asked long someone hold she just shrugged shoulders she genuinely doesn't care paying customers walking into sandwich shop wasn't wearing name tag of course   ended waiting 30mins 2 sandwich's no else place!
