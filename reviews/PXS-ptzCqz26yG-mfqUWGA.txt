 I really love Indian food   so recent trip Vegas searched cheap Indian place nearby  came across India Masala which oddly located food court inside Riviera  little difficult find inside but am very glad did   The wait wasn't long other reviewers stated  average  care long delicious food  butter chicken twice during weekend visit  just good!   They price bad  comparison those crazy inexpensive Indian lunch buffets yes bit more   but trust portion sizes really generous flavor much much more delicious   Ah   can't wait butter chicken next trip Vegas D <EOR> We found place Riviera say exceeded expectations   Just walking thru food court smelling spices made salivate   say some best indian food had   Masala Dosa say best Dosa ever had    few restaurants city Dosa but does measure dosa here   huge lots filling sambar soup served spicy but spicy   Vegas since May every time think dosa start drool   boyfriend Tandori combo he said extremely good    cannot wait back again   Tamba before while good offer Goat boyfriends favorite basic indian food cannot place   cant wait until next trip Vegas just another masala dosa if serve them 2am late night menu dont surprized find there  <EOR> One best always accessible restaurants LV strip close authentic taste  indian food   I would visit place again    <EOR> Based looks location place would never guess good is   two relatives visiting southern India all loved food!  dishes deliciously authentic portions very generous   tandoori chicken plate ordered cooked perfection   also recommend masala dosa   great little gem can't wait back next time Vegas! <EOR> Bad food ordered plain dosa veggie combo plain dosa hot came sambhar chutneys sambhar no salt watery chutneys watery cold think made few days ago  Veggie combo rice naan chole palak paneer curd dal  palak paneer hardly any paneer firm chole dal salt less  Curd thin sour think made few days ago  worth money   Just temporary way kill hunger   Review Indian! <EOR> Who knew place great would actually inside Riviera Casino's food court?!  those who've its other location Flamingo near UNLV isn't aesthetically pleasing   However something griminess surrounding area made experience much better   fact prefer somewhat feels more authentic   Unfortunately doesn't all eat lunch special unlike restaurant but hey open 24 7 guess just found new joint hit long night debauchery!!  I find quite amazing fast food stall food court offer such impressive array dishes most Indian restaurants don't   case menu comprises northern southern Indian specialties  some which never even heard before  thus it'll definitely take several visits try every single food place   thoroughly enjoyed vegetable samosa especially tamarind chutney   Another great choice tandoori combo which includes tandoori chicken garlic chicken chicken tikka chicken sheesh kabab side saag paneer naan   TIP Park lot next Peppermill enter front entrance avoid long confusing walk through old casino floor   Overall India Masala definitely great spot Indian food any time day   right say some greatest things found most unexpected places   case just surpass idea situated inside rundown food court   Enjoy!! <EOR> The downside relatively simple place Indian food  Seriously expect food court size? Everything authentic aimed right direction but same time everything falls just hair short likely would if standard restaurant  credit reduced menu even through middle night  blessing if you're stuck Riviera 2 am nobody wants walk down strip   It's kind place your way but if wind stuck Riviera Circus Circus need fill middle night your best picks  <EOR> Very good options tasty food  tried them first time love it  Only place found south Indian food without BUFFET   I am definitely going again did mention its 24 7 D <EOR> Easily some best Naan you'll ever taste    It's bad many folks ever find gem its hidden location Riviera  Riviera food court absolutely no ambience but if Indian food very good  <EOR> If came down nothing but taste would give India Masala five stars  Shari  food court  Riviera  Sharing kitchen burger joint  know know know but know what? only some best Indian food Las Vegas and far know left no tandoor untouched but kind tastes even better next day just homemade  Order big you'll glad leftovers later   After delicious first meal back spring 2010 we'd speak longingly returning but every time we'd think parking think navigating Riviera then think sitting food court while clean still old food court old casino we'd end somewhere else somewhere waiters easy parking   But then day coupon meal elsewhere Riviera alas meal pretty bad  bad decided push plates aside walk across casino some India Masala take home us   After no more excuses  down pat if drop off husband front door  The food court right through southern front door opening onto Strip  Then circle around few times pick Enormous Bag Fragrant Wonders within 20 minutes 15 if traffic right we're back home laying delicious Indian feast dining room table    Mike always gets chicken tikka masala which he described perfectly spiced good quality ingredients  You read review but think he pleased taste surprised such find take time much description  We both naan enormous fluffy  almost always shahi paneer creamy spicy sauce cheese made 7 10 per request  If your server doesn't ask hot want let them know   true any Indian restaurant  Otherwise if spicy food risk them playing safe  Unfortunately shahi paneer isn't late night menu   shame personally account some lost 1 a m  sales during summer break    In fact going take off star also because food court but  really unfair  If stick food court expectations 7 5  flavours layered subtle anywhere else town least order  In fact only place better shahi paneer opinion weird dive east side rotten service really top option  Service always friendly  although late night menu smaller more expensive regular menu available until 10 p m  same most restaurants    So yes ambience severely lacking but know what?
