Decided hit Grape service Cadillac Ranch little less stellar I am being kind    before tried hummus crab cakes caesar salad bruschetta  all quite enjoyable   really enjoy hummus  During previous visits VERY generous wine samples  most recent visit opportunity try white truffle mac cheese proscuitto on specials menu evening cambozola prosciutto fig pizza   scrumptious! Unfortunately wine friend ordered but made bringing two samples comparable wines choose from   ordered malbec enjoyed very much  <EOR> I into Grape friend ready spend some dough talked circumstance lack choices   We came jokingly asked two glasses milk bag cookies happened carrying us   Right asked see wine list inquired if any good Barolos   After barkeep try BS way through telling he knew Barolo he back actually poured two glasses milk   We took mistake sign opened bag cookies enjoyed some milk cookies which must say delicious   Bartender mistake aside did spend good amount time looking wine menu which uninteresting best    prices bad but just nothing interesting list place very stale vibe   I may stop again second around but now gotta say seeking vino elsewhere  <EOR> So regarding previous review think fair if give update  back Grape last night ironically same waiter forgot bottle wine 30 minutes last time  oh shit again but know what? He actually gave really good service last night  kill time before saw Iron Man 2 Rave walked into live jazz  squeal  good live jazz that  love jazz no idea live jazz experience started off good foot right there  glass Maso Canali split piece Creme Brulee cheesecake  died heaven cheesecake  perfectly sweet hints vanilla velvety smooth  served side whipped cream berry compote  presentation nice flavors point complimented eachother  Probably best pairing Maso Canali little dry dessert  but no complaints  chose wine probably should asked recommended pairing  spent hour relaxed headed into movie  Grape giving 5 stars again because service far improved  <EOR> Decent place came happy hour wine OK happy hour selection average   wine choice could more inspired favored full bodied sweet reds only choices liking fairly dry Pinot Noir   I Kobe beef sliders meh buddy talked them best shit earth but would preferred White Castle  <EOR> I love bar! love coming happy hour especially  6 9 wines choose $5 glass! deal  usually two them happy hour menu   I always order happy hour   bacon spinach dip pita chips the hummus mini burgers the mini quesadillas  I usually more serving bacon spinach dip  amazing  available weekends    They also live music certain nights well sell every wine available menu  prices bottles very comparable Lee Liquor Fine Wines Spirits  The venue intimate unless live music night also outdoor seating available  especially love bartenders there  very engaging start conversations if it     They high def  TVs also case glass wine enjoy your favorite sports team kick butt  great alternative very loud neighbor next door Yardhouse     Again alot other wine bars offer tasting flights    Great place especially friday work when just need unwind!
