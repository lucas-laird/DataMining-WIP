Nope! Placed order  45 minutes later call saying but would substitute  said ok   Waited another hour nothing arrived  Tried calling no answer    If can't deliver within 2 hours don't answer phone can't great    Next! <EOR> Cheap but shady spot  food wasn't exactly mom's quality but options good  <EOR> After reading several reviews chose proceed caution  Upon arrival met BBQ Master James  He shared secret great Q but sworn secrecy  ordered 3 meat combo Ribs Brisket Link Greens Mac sauce side  Everything delicious!! Perhaps best ribs touch lips  greens perfectly cooked Mac creamy deliciousness  shall return!! <EOR> Wow   one best small business restaurants LONG time  Kind small maybe seating 10 so but very well worth it  Everything mean EVERYTHING amazing! Completely unexpected  even told main chef color changing eyes LOL catering holiday meals even ship them dry ice if would like  restaurant top list Restaurants Visit Vegas <EOR> I ordered smothered oxtails three side macaroni cheese collard greens yams  Overall meal pretty good added hot sauce smothered oxtails greens both tasted better  There's still number items menu would try  customer service excellent lady front counter very friendly customer oriented  store very clean organized well kept  <EOR> After ordering 50 dollars food delivery call she says it'll 2 hours      Seriously   acceptable South  food folks <EOR> Excellent BBQ all food amazing  collards some hot sauce banana pudding  <EOR> This address incorrect wasted lot time gas trying find place  cashier misinformed over phone she said food already done  She wasn't much help once she ask cook everything  Besides she looked she drugs bad! Upon arrival several people waiting some just hanging there  waited almost hour food wasn't good  turkey bone dry deserts straight trash  macaroni missing real cheese  Total waste money  place very inconsistent isn't well organized  ran yams instead saying so gave 3 little pieces each order order least half way short  lot order wrong anyway  manager tried fix problem many but still wasn't quite right   Trying keep review short if listed every single problem probably wouldn't enough space  want recommend place chef Gordon Ramsay fix but probably way many issues! <EOR> I ordered delivery restaurant  told would take hour half two hours  Which extremely long  But hey wait busy no rush  But two hours later decide call say busy canceling order  issue waited two hours before deciding tell that  professional business figure way happen should let know could delivery time whatever reason but customer wait two hours canceled order ridiculous  <EOR> I hate give negative review some folks just trying earn living but few major problems restaurant need addressed if sure business drum up    They real problem honoring restaurants com coupon something signed for    The place just dingy kind dirty menu confusing pictures small just aren't helpful    I love good southern food but place just isn't great  = <EOR> I've come few times fiance because close house very first time amazing great ribs Cheesy Mac n cheese but first time started seriously decline would would constantly that  If your bbq shop run ribs brisket should always hand item  several occasions would add corn bread muffin ask bread would food separate occasions forget both them all together  understanding person know things happen but really twice row different weeks really? Especially when you're paying extra expect actually receive items paid for <EOR> This review EAST FLAMINGO PECOS location  First foremost food while ice cold arrival very tasty  But let's into more detail    I call Craig location help reach Flamingo location  weren't properly answering phone  Once them phone very helpful friendly    The food took FOREVER  live mere 2 miles  food took 75 minutes    Packaging nightmare  no lid tartar sauce packed rolls arrival rolls coated tartar sauce   hot fish hot yams cold potato salad all packaged together container nothing separate them  arrival fish covered juice yams melted potato salad  ate anyway because waited 75 minutes spent $39  other order brisket which really good hot link which son loved burger chili cheese fries which very cold but tasty   They NEED stop packing hot cold food together  need separated! Also thought tartar sauce open rolls container good idea?   We would never ever order delivery again but would walk hot fresh  food probably awesome when first left restaurant  sure where driver when he left restaurant but he took long way  sure  <EOR> I am going 3 stars simple reason SEASONING   portions small sides but everything cooked correctly seasoned   wouldn't order delivery them   food came little tossed around took long time but think more due GrubHub  <EOR> I cant over good Fried Catfish here  ever eaten restaurant then thought days later because good?  type experience Dots  Rib Poy Boy flavor deep smokey moist totally outstanding  Sweet Potato Pie best ever had  Food prepared fresh takes 10 15 minutes but worth wait  want try other items menu but cannot resist ordering Fried Catfish  OMG its good!! <EOR> Went late lunch early dinner today   Party 4   Not cleanest most attractive establishment world especially neon marker written windows advertise  99cent menu   Service staff pleasant quick   Seating felt someone's home backyard plastic food table chairs middle room   Orders Whiting dinner plate Mac cheese rice   Rice disgusting Totally inedible dry   Spit immediately   Mac cheese appeared baked excited ! but surmised actually only broiled or least just under baked because top lovely crust but underneath loose bound together traditionally bAked macaroni  Seasoned very well 3 5 5 taste maybe even four !!
