DAMN! flavorful quite tasty insane depth flavor   but HOT!! Couldn't stop eating it! saag just hot but oh fresh! Chunks tomato strands chive top  Could used little more salt think but little hot  Tongue numb which don't mind if food outstanding  Also rice garlic naan meal  would given 4 stars but spice level meal caused intestinal distress few days which usually experience eating Indian food  spice level food buffet far less when order off menu  Dining reminded first time Shalimar which thought some HOT Indian food  love Indian food but some reason gives intestinal distress  India Masala another great Indian restaurant 'hood Mint Ghandi India Palace which am truly grateful for! again lower spice levels  Extremely tasty food! Careful spice levels   10 must unedible! <EOR> My 2 stars pleasant demeanor person took order  The food below expectations  ordered bhindi masala which absolutely no salt yellow daal which wasn't good either  chicken Tikka masala eatable though  Also ordered laccha paratha hoping eat laccha paratha but looked tasted butter nan  Also service extremely slow   Overall disappointing experience  would definately recommend place anyone  <EOR> Awesome hospitality  Very clean  Joseph Nicole serving great hospitality  Being vegetarian indian know taste indian dishes  ordered papadi chaat idly sambar rasam uttpam  All taste excellent  note if love spicy real spicy need say 10 10  Try pista kulfi dessert  Sambar coconut chutney great but just Ok  Wasnt hungry much tried only appetizers  Did try any main course  Definitely come again  Awesome place    <EOR> Tried buffet today  Below par nicest way put it   The idli rock solid could used weapon  Sambar super watery contraption oil floating top   You need walk everything including bread lassi  next ? diners cook own food ?

Definitely top place now  <EOR> This review if dinner   Quick dirty notes Food quality tasting big BUT see full review below details BEWARE CHICKEN BONES! Service very slow biased    We come dinner TONIGHT upset am place We walked observed please wait seated sign obliged  took 5 minutes before staff noticed seated us  place pretty empty counted 4 tables back used  seated opposite end restaurant   The busser quickly sat brought some flat bread chutney  bartender quickly asked if wanted order cocktails  last interaction would next 20 minutes  noticed manager owner front desk tried eye contact show subtly ready order  silent ques unnoticed  don't understand it?!? waiters nowhere found?  Finally both waiters noticed rushed take orders  seemed obvious disconnect between staff tables responsible for  Nevertheless finally able place order    We ordered Samosas Pakora I wanted Aloo Tiki but 1 2 order Tandori Chicken Butter Chicken  Garlic Naan   The appetizers came very quickly!  The Pakora very large tasty  good mix vegetables just batter fried sliced veggies   The samosas very tasty fresh! peas them gushy potato mix nice consistency it  could tell made recently    The tandori chicken came hot tandori still moist  Probably better tandori chicken dishes had  marinated long chicken protein completely broken down yogurt  sure but meat still moist yet still nice red crust    That's where food compliments stop The tandori chicken came 10 minutes before curry rice naan  waited hoping other dishes would follow shortly but gave 5 minutes begun eat chicken  burns even more Indian family seated long food the same food before us  food came 3 minutes served  Discrimination just crappy service? judge  instantly infuriated ruined experience point on     10 minutes later finally rest order   The butter chicken sauce very creamy tasty  big complaint chicken curry  loaded seemed leftover tandori chicken bits not chunks cubes   usually expect but should pick shards bones curry  UNSAT UNSAFE! I unable enjoy curry lookout chicken bones     The food very good but misque butter chicken horrible service tainted could great dining experience  think food decent I'd dare say some better Vegas but need grip staff before I'd dare come back place  <EOR> The last Indian buffet much oil over aluminium containers F E M A  called take care spill  left over saag spinach previous nights overcooked point turned brown looked alien   The owners India Masala should proud calling themselves Indian since never Indian restaurant which impeccably clean classy  Buffet main attraction corner side show other Indian restaurants  Last time ate much find tree wind around  digest incredible food buffet  mention easy find tree desert    They also nice cozy bar red wine preferably chilled since wine sommeliers school higher learning student loans jauntily  come back tell bartenders serve red wine room temperature  Room temperature Las Vegas happens 120 degrees Fahrenheit  bartenders taught argue experts follow dictum tee  red wine chilled taste good even cheap wine taste good chilled most mere mortals drink cheap wine   Not digress red wine before during dinner which gives tremendous appetite unlike beer full mention gives Buddha belly  Buffet only sight sore eyes over Forty ! North South Indian items but feast palate say least  buffet freshly cooked unlike Chinese restaurants where serve left over previous week  secret good Indian food authentic cooks  found waiters Four North South Indian cooks  Most Indian restaurants no cooks but someone tourist visa paying off debts   The service superb ambiance embellishment feast  no way anyone kind food price charging happen Only Las Vegas Buffet Capitol World  India Masala Indian Buffet Capitol Las Vegas  would say Healthiest Buffet food Las Vegas anywhere    It time weekly visit Capitol  <EOR> I'm fan Indian but place good get!
