Try yourself  Best takeout pizza Suburban vegas area    Dr Bob <EOR> We really enjoy double dough pizza especially during first 3 4 times ordered   We've ordered dozens times but often inconsistent   cut pizza into squares when ask pie cut pizza often oozing much oil etc   When right definitely worth price   Plus beats ordering more mainstream chains     They've forgotten items ordered delivery couple times   driver quick retrieve missing items no biggie  really girl answers phones  unapologetic personality rock   We quickly learned start ordering online avoid speaking her   She rushes phone doesn't try solve issues positive manner i e  quick offer refund missing item when paid cash doesn't offer any apologies treats customers without any respect just plain unpleasant  never asked name because personal she obviously wasn't trained personable phone least offering name when answering calls   All all food somewhat above average but service much improved  <EOR> I don't care good food over hour late order when called girl answered said messed being made now  should hour ago just starting now? Horrible <EOR> I ordered first Chicago style pizza place disappointed  don't think much Rosati's fault just turns Chicago style pizza sucks  ridiculous concept needs cheese bottom sauce top? cheese fanatic first bite texture all wrong  couldn't even taste cheese all sauce  Ick! crust good overall taste just above average fairness order regular pizza them see if liking  Stay tuned review  <EOR> Best Pizza Vegas    not even close! breadsticks penne broccoli also awesome! <EOR> I ordered over phone delivery everything seemed smoothly   I ordered two pizzas first black olives pepperoni alfredo sauce instead pizza sauce decent  greatest ever but bad any means   The problem came second pizza  ordered Cheesy Beef pizza w hot peppers which supposed au jus gravy type sauce instead pizza sauce  ordered straight menu without changing anything all  pizza received cheese pizza green peppers it  no beef peppers wrong regular pizza sauce  checked receipt sure enough down properly Cheesy Beef pizza  cost $23 when pizza sold around $16 17 menu   I didn't bother calling them back fixed because don't feel delivery driver should pay cooks mistake wasting gas  never ordering Rosatis again because this  price pizza puts premium bracket yet service definitely lacking if can't even pizza correctly off own specialty menu  <EOR> After meaning try place 3 years finally them   WOW    great pizza   Crust cheese meat vegies all excellent   Try 'em new regular place   much better national chains its funny   cheap but ever pay for!  best   sausage pepporoni olive green pepper thin crust great   large large! <EOR> Great Chicago style pizza when Las Vegas   real deal   Also appetizers amazing   TOASTED RAVIOLI!!!!  Gotta try place if haven't gone  <EOR> The food decent nothing spectacular but bad  Garlic fry bread delicious  However quite possibly worst dining experience ever had  Service worse horrible basics plastic cups napkins  server no concern making things right  screwed pizza already taken over 30 minutes make  Overall horrible experience won't back  Totally bummer because place conveniently located rarely busy  No soap bathrooms wondering servers kitchen staff washing hands  <EOR> I guess should checked Yelp reviews before came opposed looking them while restaurant waiting pizza  First let say only place ever great Chicago style pizza actually Chicago  Chicago style pizza ok but definitely comparable Giordano's Lou Malnati's  pizza should recieve 3 stars breadsticks served before meal should 4 stars but service should really only 1 star  We walked 2 girls front didnt even say hi   ask if seat ourselves she then says no many?   She takes table then drops off menu walks away  don't think she rushing anywhere important only 1 other table eating inside   Once recieved pizza she didn't stop back until well into 3rd piece   I then asked box she dropped check off  She quick come back paid but only moment urgency entire meal  I don't think back location  takeout Silverado Ranch location can't dine in but carry out experience much more pleasant one    <EOR> A couple co workers decided stop because heard doing pizza buffet lunch location  arrived 25 minutes before lunch buffet going shut down  sat down assured waiter making more pizzas would enough  True word did eventually enough pizzas left fill    BUT enough overcome biggest gripes experience    1  When buffet type experience expect food buffet     Having fight other patrons over pizza slices fun thing  just sets unpleasant situation where your fighting every slice then whole pizza gone 60 seconds  really doesn't hate douche bag takes more slice situation   2  Rosati's known deep dish Chicago pizza but don't serve buffet   Wow asked said can't justify cost putting deep dish buffet  WHAT? Why even bother buffet if your going cheap it  If known before started eating would just ordered pie skipped buffet   price couple bucks per person put deep dishes would gladly pay it    3  buffet itself kinda sparse  probably would noticed except waiting pizza  salad only two types dressing some pasta sauces meatballs Italian sausages  huge menu just felt limited   Now food good service attentive but take advice order delivery until fix this  <EOR> Probably best experiences! monster pizza good! staff location super nice helpful know where gonna getting pizza game nights now! recommend SURE! <EOR> I location $5 special slice pizza soda  Rosati's carryout only  man behind desk put slice box  When home opened box found slice totally dried lukewarm The outside crust pretty brown but totally burnt  crust tasted cardboard Perhaps if slice fresh instead crispy dried cheese top heated might okay tasting  didn't think worth ride back return although two employees seemed pleasant   threw return again  <EOR> Was all time fave pizzas  coming New Yorker  Over last couple years there's decline quality consistency  Most glaring use canned mushrooms fresh       huge no no pizza     ruins moisture balance thin crust soggy even when well done  Breaded mushrooms fantastic though  <EOR> Tried 5 times now never better   Always soggy middle   Ordered pie cut hoping it'd better squares   Nope still wet soggy middle   Sad because taste just underdone wet soggy   Last time $70 2 pies no thx <EOR> Good food but don't buy dessert    cheesecake isn't worth over 4 bucks only two mouthfuls  Manager didn't even attempt right  <EOR> Not all Rosati's created equal  Some franchised others independently owned  franchise  Those tried before never fan  still sold thin crust  find bland  However best pizza isn't even menu  special order special keyword  Dine order stuffed pizza  45 minute wait but treat buttery crust gooey cheese galore   flavors packed pie bring back Chicago each bite  wonderful    We've tried delivery as pictured still mighty tasty but crust wasn't crisp  definitely recommend dining in  <EOR> This place really gone down hill   big fans sister property Macianos Grand Canyon Russell Rd but moved closer Rosati's began going here   last three times ordered pizza terrible  Yes give place three times fix it  before won't back    pizza cooked cheese hardly melted cold   crust thin other reviewer said cracker limp that   Spending $20 pizza cook when home because just don't right if take back attitude through hassle again just stupid   again   boss often orders pizza large department over 125 employees sure she does order anymore   Way expensive poor quality service   don't think place open much longer never anyone even during dinner rush   Sorry see started off great! <EOR> I've eaten over 40 pizza places town  think place best Chicago style pizza Vegas  People friendly price coupons unbelievable   Well eat again  <EOR> Uldate update changing star 4  owner venue contacted me  thanked feedback explained going use improve future  cool?!

If think only few pennies but imagine much would add when happens all time    Needless say did scene but congratulations Rosati's just made extra 50c but lost customer would came back over over  pizza good but when skimmed just leaves bitter taste your mouth  way very similar thin pizza same taste spices Costco! comes pack 4 just over $10    <EOR> SO TRICK called asked price 18 pizza lady asked if want deal just pizza? asked deal? She said $25 90 18 12 free  And asked did mean pizza only? she told 18 pizza only without deal $25 90! Ahh sound same why take deal right? WRONG!
