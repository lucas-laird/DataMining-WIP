Memphis BBQ good BBQ restaurants Vegas next Famous Dave's Lucille's   atmosphere relaxed casual staff friendly available food delish prices reasonable   would recommend place  <EOR> You know bad when food gives headache  used restaurant all time  Something changed  food whatever wasn't fat all tasted old  Even normally reliable warm buns hard corners  only redeeming quality remains Apple Blossom iced tea  Service fine just quality food gone down  oh god bathrooms disgusting! no towels dry your hands  floor stalls look hadn't cleaned quite some time  While possible unique occurrence never experienced anything them before  <EOR> Good BBQ Vegas but good we're used finding Midwest   Liked choices sides pork ribs good maybe early day just hadn't smoked enough?   <EOR> I eaten past really good  pulled through drive thru tonight when arrived home food hair chicken fingers  ended throwing whole meal away  actually fried obviously hair  fingers supposed cooked spicy sauce instead just put side container  Waste money food  never eat again  Very disappointed! <EOR> This place crazy  kind BBQ joint drive through window!! all awards see even president clinton took picture him  Everything pretty good  Ribs great good flavor pulled pork great  Bisckets hot fresh  beer good drink special each day  Service nice  give sauces mix match  sort thicker sauces but good little more vinegar side though  <EOR> I've several times over past few years even catered party once   food always very good   brisket always tender really enjoy all sides   vinegar based cole slaw instead mayo based slaw find some other places   don't think even without ordering fried pickles yum!  pulled pork sometimes little dry but sauce much enough ends food anyway   The star deduction sometimes spotty service   Yesterday server great other times well good  <EOR> We just returned home Indiana Vegas   Four us   ask least favorite thing did Vegas   all said Memphis Barbecue   sure writing some reviews but waste your money here! Sauce watered down but don't think would liked anyway   Cole slaw spoiling turning yellow magic dust great macaroni cheese onion rings good  Very disappointing especially all awards received thirteen years   Don't eat here! <EOR> Having fan 17th Street Murphysboro hopeful same taste Las Vegas   baby back ribs which standard order back Illinois close but good original   would still call best BBQ Las Vegas but could still better   Everyone else enjoyed food well including sides various BBQ meats   Overall would recommend place just quite good original  <EOR> Meh   I wasn't impressed any food ordered except ribs     The beef brisket decent but served damn near room temperature tad dry side   sauce really made taste good   The vegetables good but they're vegetables     The wings definitely tasty nothing special   Again sauce used made them shine   The ribs AMAZING  Juicy fall off the bone tender   know else made them good?  Sauce   I wouldn't hesitate buy sauces but don't see myself coming back here  <EOR> If BBQ then give bread water   Bland meats turkey dry desert outside  Red beans rice overly salty  cucumber salad decent though  <EOR> We Las Vegas weekend decided visit Memphis Championship Barbecue  While ratings MCB stellar seemed OK enough give try especially since nearby hotel  good choice   Growing Alabama eaten barbecue most six decades  know difference great smoked meats southern sides  items great   Service good  seated immediately server table within couple minutes  decided we'd order Deviled Eggs appetizer  server explained rather sweet because Miracle Whip  She right but tasted OK  did note plate wet usually indicating eggs while earlier stored cold refrigerator  old but certainly made when ordered   Our server brought some fresh rolls honey butter   honey butter may made in house but rolls food service bread heated  then placed orders pulled pork plate two meat plate consisting pulled pork brisket  Sides ordered collard greens fresh corn cob red beans rice  address each item starting sides   Collard Greens VERY overcooked to point being almost black mushy extremely sweet  only flavoring heavy spiciness flavor but heat  only way flavor them green pepper vinegar but overcooked sent them back choosing instead fried okra    Fresh Corn Cob corn fresh but while collards very overcooked corn nearly raw  raw wasn't even warm all way through  husk end corn still green white cooked corn is  When explained server corn cooked she told flash fried corn   ask she meant  Apparently put raw corn into fryer basket drop into deep fryer 1 1 1 2 minutes because don't want turn into popcorn   server apparently doesn't understand popcorn specific strain conn which dried  cold raw corn returned  replaced hush puppies  now two sides sent back    Red Beans Rice Apparently canned red beans just heated up  No special spices  kept them but weren't good   Fried Okra Hush puppies When okra arrived breading very uniform asked if house made frozen  Surprise   both fried okra hushpuppies frozen food service products  Now southerner am pretty appalled BBQ restaurant doesn't hushpuppies scratch  mean hard mix corn meal batter drop fryer?   Frankly best side frozen okra  wasn't overcooked hot    Sad   truly sad   The meats which should star just turned black hole flavor   While pulled pork nice bark smoke ring absolutely no flavor  hot dry but without bbq sauce bland  Original Sauce used much better  Only Sticky Red Sauce any flavor   The brisket tender but aside smoke ring no flavor either    They advertise Magic Dust seasoning apparently sprinkled everything  Unfortunately should rubbed into all meats prior smoking   But kicker piece baked plastic found pulled pork  While wanted believe everything reheated made rethink all    So whole meal extremely disappointing  Fortunately server who'd said she'd doing long time helpful apologetic  She came back table tell entire meal comped  While did eat but 25% entire meal did expect happen  everyone should tipped total whole meal   My suggestion restaurant start flavoring meat FRESH well cooked sides dump frozen food service prepped items  <EOR> Heard place won bunch awards try next time Vegas  lunch ribs  good but better elsewhere  Several side dishes choose from  potato salad beans rice mac cheese very good  Pass fries  Typical BBQ joint selections brisket pulled pork burnt ends chicken ribs  <EOR> Been eating Memphis BBQ since moved Valley early 90's  Certainly changed lot since then  always better  Still love though  miss original beef ribs but vendor changes can't helped  original location Craig LVB seems better but location does pretty good  influx other BBQ options Valley definitely damaged business opposed forcing them improve  food most important still stands test time  only issues inconsistenty far quality  Some days meat dryer then others based time come in  Some sides changed well quality hasn't always improved  probably 150 times coming never terrible meal  Sometimes hasn't good but never terrible  revolving door staff doesn't help overall experience either  Maybe just nostalgic feel sense loyalty establishment but seriously BBQ  eaten other places all over valley other states gauge other BBQ  Some better most worse  local business  providing great food Las Vegas lot years  long they're still around continue patronize establishment  suggest choice yourself don't let bunch cry babies don't eat red meat choice you  <EOR> Very disappointed ! baby back ribs dry rock hard did include any dipping sauce onion straws when called complain same old excuse everybody gives oh new employees must've made mistake don't think going back anymore   <EOR> Consistently good food day night least decade customer  Could ask more thank you! <EOR> I am visiting mom Las Vegas wanted some ribs leaving mall driving down warm springs happen see Memphis ribs decided eat there  The baby back ribs burnt ends very good !

Pulled pork    Decent  Also memorable   Brisket    Blah  Dry dry dry  Even when doused sauce  Let's just say part tomorrow's planned lunch dogs sitting   Will again? Probably some point when memory fades black again  Just because pure convenience proximity drive thru  If time sit down much  <EOR> This good BBQ place serves good brisket    usually sausage brisket while husband rib eater   grew Texas ribs must fall off bone find many places town meet criteria usually try his   This place also unique item appetizers fried pickles if haven't tried them before they're bad   Overall meats good smokey flavor ribs tender but just Texas perfect but close  sides cole slaw collard greens also very good   I recommend place overall bad BBQ  <EOR> Sadly most recent reviews seem indicate MCB decline   I used LOVE place   BBQ restaurant Vegas   When worked down street ate lunch 3 5 times month sometimes more   When closed near house looked forward trips across town chance sneak lunch MCB   No more  Likely never again   The burnt ends dry sugary  brisket tough  pork shoulder wet mess  mac cheese gummy dry  sweet rolls stale cold  fried pickles personal favorite burned greasy     The only things remembered apple sweet tea cinnamon sugar butter rolls   Making matters worse everything cost more portions smaller   might OK if quality but not   It sad day BBQ fans Vegas  <EOR> Meh    went Saturday afternoon   Slow service first all   Food ok nothing special ordered for work 2 orders corn muffins   brought them COLD!  doubt back any time soon    step your service!! <EOR> A family favorite  visit quite frequently when want whole group together because love atmosphere grandparents friendly many waiters  usually fried catfish meal often enough left entire plate next day! prices bad especially considering much food get  <EOR> Place really good BBQ probably best BBQ found Vegas which itself surprising   Service always spot place clean fireplace going when cold outside food comes really fast! great spot quick lunch   I typically roasted chicken baked potato and or collard greens  Depends hungry am but never finish it  typically only finish half take other half home   smoked turkey brisket both really good well   They don't many bbq sauces Famous Dave's which would prefer did but 2 pretty good   Lastly try apple flavored unsweetened tea mmmm mm good! <EOR> good competition que probably best competition realm ever had but authur bryants Gates any other bbq joints  I beef brisket judge all BBQ on and burnt ends both cover sauce end but still good taste <EOR> Damn some good BBQ!

Great food gets service great prices  Variety choices  brisket fave! prefer Sticky Red Sauce over Original Memphis brand BBQ sauce  Great atmosphere  Anytime visit Vegas stop down home BBQ! <EOR> This place great past but no more  waited 45 minutes food ordering only 3 other tables place        grilled chicken sandwich texture rubber much frozen chicken breast taste cooking quickly  addition covered seasoning didn't help taste     pulled chicken sandwich fine top but when getting further bun layer oil point bun saturated     Don't know happened but return  Looking reviews past year looks isolated issue <EOR> I used think Memphis Warm Springs finest BBQ LV  two most recent visits opinion changed  location going down hill  St  Louis ribs shouldn't tough  Didn't used be  website broken  Try downloading to go menu  Link broken  email address website black hole  Memphis asked to go menu  given catering menu instead  wasn't trying feed fifty  only four  Sadly given Memphis  now Famous Dave's far superior all aspects  <EOR> Highly over priced  Extremely poor food quality  place really bottomed out  ordered brisket guest ordered baby back ribs  Both dried bad  Memorial Day Monday  Food tated all cooked Friday anticipation big weekend left sit dryout  Awful  rolls flavorless  only thing good fried okra  because frozen bag drop fryer serve  Hard ruin  many years used favorites  Now horrible  $50 two people dinner  somewhere else  <EOR> I know everyone different favorite barbecue style   Typically most them   read reviews restaurant excited see why favorite   Unfortunately isn't mine  selected 2 item barbecue  Baby back ribs burnt ends  burnt ends very good   Very flavorful dried out   ribs however liking   dry side   Just didn't flavor all  2 sauces table   tried both them   Again just didn't enjoy flavors    know sauces award winning just liking  Some people read think crazy   Again all different favorite barbecue flavor profiles    French fries seasoning them  think might magic dust   ok  sure all fuss magic dust  also Mac cheese   great   service good attentive  <EOR> The baby backs pretty good  Sides weren't bad creamed cord more cream then corn  Beans nice blend pinto kidney Lima  think banana pudding can <EOR> Was getting oil change next door decided come stop see why champions apparently   It pretty slow sat quickly  Server nice talkative  ordered 2 meat 2 sides combo dry baby back ribs burnt ends Mac cheese red beans rice side   Food did come pretty quick which expected  ribs decent meat came off bone relatively easily  burnt ends great  overly sauced   The red beans rice rice little undercooked but wasn't terrible Mac cheese little runny but good taste   Overall average BBQ joint wasn't bad food but also wasn't anything overly exciting either  would come back  <EOR> I because barbecue fanatic  gone probably every other barbecue restaurant Las Vegas them rated  According company am expert  when heard Memphis championship barbecue bit excited come in   I came lunch although afternoon no door  walked bar sat down some small talk bartender place order  She overly enthused menu items but still ordered  First never put something plate eat kale go  Second don't put ramekins coleslaw etc  plate because they've touched  Third ribs ordered supposed St  Louis but incredibly thin reminiscent baby back's  asked take off bill because going eat it  Lastly beef brisket tasted brisket  other words fall apart no bark bit tough  All all fan  should over rolling smoke TC's rib crib bells move operation more progressive tasting <EOR> Meh came family wasn't all impressed  feel service slightly slow food nothing spectacular  took while drinks appetizers food come possibly because hour came    but say time spent waitress she definitely it she ranks higher food kept Kerr's mug filled brim!   Food wise started fried pickles    yes understand pickles   fried but toooooo salty soggy chewy  never them before nor ever fried pickles but now understand frying pickles may hard feat  marked sodium overload day   For dinner sandwich salad combo stuck chicken sandwich  dry ended just eating chicken without bun because wasn't fan bun  Still chicken dry didn't finish it   say croutons salad pretty good! dad pulled pork sandwich he said he liked it     but dad's taste buds aren't all par ]  So maybe barbecue isn't thing    maybe Memphis Barbecue isn't thing   <EOR> I ate couple weeks ago used excited eating BBQ joint but somehow quality gone downhill  food seemed better West Side location closed last September  tried ribs sausage pork shoulder did burnt ends which reason why restaurant  even ordered 2nd plate see if burnt ends ready not  eaten BBQ coast coast might give place more shot  staff definitely friendly accomodating but BBQ same! <EOR> The Waitress good  no complaints her  However food soda another story   they need clean soda machines because soda tasted old dirt funk  waitress knew but tried every machine restaurant all same nasty dirty taste  food Babybacks St Louis Chicken mac n cheese dull far flavor goes  Food cooked properly but seasoning left lot desired  Very dry  <EOR> I finally opportunity taste some fixins MCB delicious free catered Company event today   What try pulled chicken pulled pork sandwiches baked beans coleslaw   The baked beans very very good coleslaw sweet moist  liked lot am picky when comes coleslaw mine sweeter side!
