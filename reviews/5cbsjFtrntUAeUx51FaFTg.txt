But yes crispy soft!   Also Tampiquena Style steak tasty but little over seasoned salty?   Would pass steak next time more tacos another dish   We much full dessert but some tempting options     Service tad slow attentive I'd but also come unfortunately expect Vegas when few other diners outside  shaded area outside misleadingly cooler expected likely prompting other diners stay inside wish avoid Vegas heat   Our server did tell great sounding Happy Hour 4 6 30pm 10pm closing every day 25 cent tacos $1 mini Coronas  can say bucket beer? I'm confused why Agave isn't more hopping late night spots Summerlin maybe but word mouth slow?? since great atmosphere decent bar area great outdoor dining solid happy hour  I'd much rather hang some spots say Boca Park always seem bustling   The best part Agave?

Over all very enjoyable experience  <EOR> I Agave handful times thing restaurant always something   This time food great vegetarian stuffed poblano pepper much better ever before   ambiance bold fitting theme always   time asked bar area gets dark see your dining partners outer upper level learned last time    hostesses pleasant accommodating    The thing prompted full review time service   no law requiring business run groupon   no law requiring business run happy hour even Clark County suggestion should be    So   when business chooses and or both things need drop attitude when people actually decide take part promotions   Our server nice attentive she did call guys repeatedly which annoying but overall she adept getting happy hour drinks making sure vegetarian black beans instead non vegetarian pinto beans etc   She pretty great until end meal  However when check pay tried use groupon   Apparently Agave doesn't allow use groupons happy hour items despite being clear groupon text   groupon expire guarantee wasn't first she'd seen first time anyone dealt issue     Our server told she would ask manager process groupon because some happy hour drinks then regular food   genuinely whole ordeal   manager didn't bother come over speak he kind brushed off then saw watching avoiding eyeline across bar area   creepy   He computer knowledge separate checks then would only honor groupon food leaving $4 unused   That's fine would no problem if man jewels come over job say something Hey sorry promotions don't cross    Truly would chance gain future visits making problem all just processing entire thing   willing tussle over $4 $60 check?

Their Mango Margarita definitely point love it!  The prices cheap but during happy hour 10pm really good deals $2 tacos!  Great deal bad nights slot machines Red Rock Casino across street! <EOR> Let start off saying until last visit 02 22 12 wife LOVED place    We Groupon set expire taxes do  Since already side town rather refund Groupon figured would satisfy craving some delicious food Agave once finished filling mounds paperwork IRS   We arrived around 7 30pm surprise place hopping! usually good sign means a restaurant still good b economy coming back people afford eat Agave! hostess informed would ten minutes before could seated  problem looked busy sat down played some games phones    It close ten minutes later seated informed server would moment  Having penchant sitting sections absentee servers habit checking time when seated  where star gets knocked off five star potential    took over 8 minutes water chips delivered drink order taken    A couple minutes later drinks arrived along chips three flavors salsa  began munching those while wondering happened restaurant  new menu big piece paper  No more hefty very cool leather bound book menu  When asked when change occurred as last toward end summer appeared new bad reviews cropping recently thought maybe new menu something it no new menu new day  Supposedly only couple items taken off but appeared menu drastically changed  Another star removed old menu some very good food couldn't find menu   Our server gentleman can't remember name started doing am going show off smart am memorizing your order thing until started ordering food  Then he brought trusty notepad insure proper items ordered  Half star returned least he knows limitations   It didn't take long before food came delivered food runner dropped ran  She didn't stick around see if noticed anything wrong it  course was  asked certain items left off nachos low behold ALL OVER nachos  over $10 00 nachos portioned pretty small but otherwise OK aside additional ingredients asked included  tempted wait until server asked things another batch made later glad did not!  I demolished most nachos started chicken quesadilla  finished slice quesadilla while also eating nachos little masked  Once nachos done though solo bite quesadilla wondered just taken bite of  Asking wife if she would bite she gave knowing bad look yet trooper took bite anyway  face confirmed just being picky    The chicken quesadilla strange texture very off flavor it  can't quite place wrong just very unappealing pallet   Another star stolen away   During entire time eating never once drinks refilled  25 minutes between getting initial drinks before saw server again  why later glad did wait return nachos  more star gone    When server did finally grand re appearance table he asked if wanted box quesadilla  He didn't hear ignored when said No doesn't taste good all  no would anything else cooked all way nothing  asked if could drinks refilled water filled wife's water however only filled 2 3 way  25 minutes 2 3 refill? Seriously guy? Another star gone   As night lost more more respect restaurant used thoroughly enjoy eating just enjoying ambiance dining area  curved walls high ceiling decorative lamps round windows all add lot dining experience  If build custom home want living room based dining room  great building  Suppose where star leave them comes from   One last thing changed music more modern R B type selection volume turned way loud restaurant  felt raise voices heard across table  weren't eating club     If happen give place shot least use restrooms sinks very cool too! <EOR> I eaten 2 occasions  first year ago  service time good but very sparse enough staff place packed  food both occasions excellent! highly recommend seafood burrito  service recent visit top notch  waitress game wasn't busy water glasses always full  would definitely again based recent visit  <EOR> I dined Wednesday evening restaurant bar busy  sat bar could enjoy company video poker if mood struck   Shrimp crab enchiladas stack seafood should star dish but wasn't  think sauce didn't complement seafood well many tortillas  Overall so so  $19 95 expect better   Rock shrimp chile relleno appetizer delicious! bargain $11 95  Flavorful yummy sauce ample shrimp   Chocolate creme brulee almonds tasty but lacking whipped cream  Very rich   Dulce leche milk cake LOVED IT! Another bargain  I given free dessert because entree took long time  Kudos that! <EOR> very very let down  service super slow food garbage  duck quesadilla thinking going great because reviews everything but sadly mistaken  Perhaps should gotten crispy quesadilla instead large soft where wrong  But any case soft cut served covered sauce salad  eat knife fork  am guessing order done sitting while kitchen while finishing other plates because super super soggy absolutely no other texture  super salty very one note  maybe supposed order crispy small quesadilla maybe fluke part but am going back because it  <EOR>
