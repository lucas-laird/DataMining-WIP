RUDE!! <EOR> I meaning place really few vendors internet food court cafe but often gets passed better ambiance essentially extended cafeteria college crowd    The BF 16 wings Mango Slam Parmesan Garlic  mango slam nice jerk flavor some sweet fruitiness  parm came lot grated parmesan but flavor just OK  ended dipping them mango slam since more type flavor BF picked garlic parm  wings good sized crispy though    Fried pickles nice thin pickles fried chips  really liked  came some ranch type dip but probably would awesome some mustard based sauce  regular but basket rather generous portion    The fries came seasoned skin on  reminds fries places 5 Guys rather solid if those thick cut natural skin type fries   The check offer purchase free dessert  slice rum cake  good but maybe bit boozy since straight soaked rum If want buzzed dessert though you    So ambiance looks much but wings fried pickles hit spot would back during lunch when just want quick bite  would probably good to go place  spot big ole tray together  <EOR> Wing King never disappoints! New menu Pig Wings    kind rib tips but come different part pig  much more tender rib tips whole lot more meatier   fried no time prepared any flavors although any BBQ flavors would probably your best bet  <EOR> I hearing rumblings Wing King little while now  never even desire give shot because location Food Court building CSN  gotta say can't really judge book cover  Let set scene you   place order over phone walk 20 minutes later background music Gansta's Paradise  Automatically  bonus point I'd prefer enter most places Coolio singing real life soundtrack  Any place playing Gangsta's Paradise automatically loses star  Ok sorry getting sidetracked    Upon entering place little smokey but because Bob Marley posters all around if know saying  smokiness poorly ventilated fryers  wasn't overwhelming  worked kitchens before pretty mild used immediately  gentleman helped Brian nice polite guy  told hearing good things place wanted check out  check offer small dessert awesome  opted chocolate bundt cake because he said freshest  He also way pop everything open verify order correct  then he wrote cake container microwave 20 30 seconds  He said nice gooey brownie  cant begin say much tiny attention detail appreciated  love when food service establishment way customer service mainly because lot places tend part dead wrong    I tried bunch different stuff  french fries stole show  way front  awesome seasoning them  boneless traditional wings flavors Parmesan Garlic Spicy Parmesan Garlic Mango BBQ Mild  huge fan Parmesan Garlic most places  place wasn't particularly best though  just ok  enjoyed but better  spicy version tasted off  least favorite four  Mango BBQ solid  Sweet just small kick hot  Mild was    well Mild  safe bet didn't disappoint  Mac Cheese let down  expensive but some BFG level anything  I'd skip altogether next time favor bigger size fries  Did mention fries bomb? Because were  Mmm taste those seasonings now  Also cake pretty good  Nice fresh satisfying    If area craving wings definitely try place out  going back experience some more flavors course fries  pricing everything very reasonable should able find something you'll really like    Especially if order french fries  <EOR> Veeeerrryyyy sloooooooowwww service  Ordered 5 Wing special think saw them rubbing 2 sticks together start fire underneath fryer   Then touched food bare hands yes serious   told them eat themselves even though prepaid    $7 00 down drain  NEVER AGAIN  <EOR> First all cafeteria style eating setup   multiple food stands eat small area shared others   big deal but don't expect BWW other establishment   cool idea though more college kids think since right near CSN     Ordered fried pickles jalapeno bombers traditional wings course   Pickles good   it sauce them actually   pickles themselves didn't much but cajun mayo ranch whatever pretty solid well vinegary saltiness   Jalapeno bombers very good    pretty bland   would recommend   As wings saw them cook entire batch time   But somehow some them overcooked dry others absolutely perfect   some lot blood vessels whatever called mine broken bone marrow all around insides chunks bone pieces   yuck   must frozen transported via UPS freight jk   kind of       Tried parm garlic mango habenero I think carribean jerk bbq   garlic parm ok   the habenero basic hot me   both good but great   great carribean jerk   excellent spicy mixture bbq jerk'ness really really wish all others much thought love put into them   Since all other reviews seemed great must bad experience bad choices sauce least   If wings cooked right would made 4 star more solid choice flavor would bumped another outta me   guess stick chain restaurants solid consistent wings  <EOR> Okay saw many great reviews place kind made want write but second thought think only fair everyone tell is   sauce which wings okay nothing jump down Teriyaki Med  Hot also tried Dry Cool Ranch   wings over fried dry nice crunch but just dry small wings Wingstop much bigger wings   Mac Cheese tasteless Parm Garlic fries also pretty tasteless   may oil hot but should know better since Wing King   Waited half hour 24 wings sides     Went Sat  night around 7p m  3 5 food stalls closed business only Wing King Soul Food stall open   Maybe businesses geared CSN crowd??  Just wondering why many 5 Star reviews?? Did miss something?? <EOR> Although bookmarked place didn't realize would same building Kaba Curry finding when attended first Elite event double bonus amazing flavors night! gentlemen behind counter very welcoming attentive nice enough treat some chill parmesan fries amazing btw which enough curious wings   Once decided few wings try approached counter asked million dollar question your best seller? thought would standard pitch some random flavor but owner I didn't catch name let sample different sauces even tweaked sauce recipes just me! undoubtedly come back some dry rubbed wings which if amazing jamaican jerk ones should pretty amazing   Thanks guys your great service awesome wings  just became favorite wing spot town! <EOR> Thanks Tien introducing place  would've never known place  Always search good wings find great French fries same search phenomenal  owners Louisiana know good food friendly well   We sample some Slam sauces Sweet Chili fries garlic Parmesan fries fried pickle chips peach cobbler  ended ordering some Jerk Slam wings  Nice size wings cooked perfectly price great  don't skimp sauce either   I can't wait back try more many flavor wings fries  <EOR> How good when best thing menu peach cobbler??   definitely worth trying above anything else   might even worth buying whole tin it   would!!  I wasn't impressed rest it   12 wings   Half extra hot other garlic parmesan which recommended person working   ton grated sawdust parmesan top which pretty lame   wings just wings   Nothing special me   baked beans side really good potato salad decent but doesn't equal complete dinner   red velvet cake wasn't good before either   definitely dry no chocolate chips last time     Considering atmosphere dining area would ideal place illegal transactions down other things lacking clean tables fact Wing King doesn't best things drink wings BEER am takeout customer best     Call your order if don't waiting  <EOR> By far best wings eaten many flavors choose from  Once you're done your wings recommend try peach cobbler  Why may ask? Its good resist  Don't judge place where its located its food court  place beats Buffalo Wild Wings far  should really try place give try before judging it  <EOR> Best wings town!! Wish lived closer! Owners really friendly welcoming try cakes too! <EOR> Eck! Nasty wings no fries?????? Workers getting high  <EOR> Wing King   King Wings   way more flavors select 40 last count if want all detail oriented it some rather try without some significant payout part dare large glass ice cold milk   For main reason hit Wing King desserts   Red Velet Cake good but sinfully good when barely legal oven   If still eat teenager would totally eat 1 2 cake pint ice cream     Hidden gem dessert category  <EOR>
