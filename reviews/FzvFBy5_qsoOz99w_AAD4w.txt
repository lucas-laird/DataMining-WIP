<EOR> First time tried rare steak pho surpassed expectations   Second time ordered admittedly around 11 15 am maybe soup broth didn't enough time steep but very flavorless   Also tried red curry dish but few spoonfuls did try any more  watery red curry flavors Archi's Pin Kaow etc   A big plus would if offered delivery but moment dine pickup only  Friendly service over phone though   Good when you're mood some pho Mountain's Edge area but lazy drive far it  But if time strong craving pho probably worth elsewhere  <EOR> The wings bomb curry wonton best ever waiter being real help but seemed he rushing order ordered he wasn't eager anymore bugging  rare steak chicken breast die but waiter much appetizers almost left because he just pushy <EOR> I always said would stop since opened however never did until few nights ago   ordered BBQ Chick fried rice no egg   great very filling   staff nice informative   liked much back brought friend   found new place local serves great food    LeJon Jenkins <EOR> I eat all time   Everyone always friendly treat genuinely care having your business   only tofu pad thai but amazing   Very happy live just down street it  <EOR> Ok come realize place actually half Vietnamese food pho half Thai since diff flavors pho also Thai dishes such pad Thai papaya salad etc  ordered panang curry chicken usual Thai food little disappointed here  panang curry flavor right   kinda but made disappointing experience fact came soup!
