FAVORITE sushi joint EVER! happily drive Summerlin Yama every chance get!  prices very reasonable compared most sushi places!! At Yama son eat AYCE dinner just under $50 leaving plenty cash tips!  last place took cost $75 BEFORE tip   AYCE but most stuff wasn't included but you'll read review later  = *Now food ALWAYS fresh never fishy always customize your tastes! once every other month but chefs still remember keep Crazy red chili sauce themselves  speaks great service ensures food every time  Another reviewer mentioned Baked Green Mussels Those MUST every trip! best mussels EVER!  own way making sets theirs apart every where else  Also Man Whore Son Beach Harry Potter rolls die for!

Again AYCE rules total sense   *The service freaking awesome! see some people talking wait  must going 7pm Friday Saturday you'll experience long waits those times anywhere go  usually party 4 when ever usually seated within minutes   chefs remember choices even created special rolls just when in! if don't experiment made problem! aren't offended don't charge it  flag down any waitress aren't territorial any way  nor judgmental Sure giggle when 11 year old son orders every flavor mochi plus green tea plum ice cream but deliver none less!  all deal sugar high later right? lol  *Over All* great restaurant!

Again place small  why always suffer long wait times  top battling children hostesses then follow rude waitress    Everybody seems genius when comes knowing difference between good sushi bad sushi  Unfortunately everybody Yama seems hard time noticing difference between good service bad service obvious fact somewhere else cleaner BIGGER providing much smaller wait time still providing great sushi  Take warning good tip sushi lovers   In regards going Yama Sushi if still decide volunteer tribute may sushi forever your favor  Because everything else may be   Good luck! <EOR> Bad service bad food! soon walked noticed flies flying around throughout restaurant  waitress orders wrong! then when couldn't finish bad sushi she told eat it!! kidding?! am force fed bad sushi!!

Every time am craving sushi Yama spot to  sushi fresh very delicious  ready wait table because good    <EOR> First before comments place want say am very easy please food addict  see give most places 4 stars    So review whole group newly minted friends 14 people  place packed luckily someone group booked party room did wait  enough chairs corralled two extra chairs   This first time sushi place popular line hungry patrons waiting seated 745PM  Normally 745PM most restaurants pretty sparse   We all special all eat  During whole dinner waitress kept reminding many orders would pay left overs  Kind disturbing feeling did want more eat   okay understand financial reasons  asked review orders half way through adjusted accordingly some ordered more some deleted orders    I written experiences Sushi Avenue Las Vegas  compare Yama Sushi Sushi Avenue night day  Sushi Avenue outshines Yama Sushi light year  reason why food inferior Yama Sushi All sushi topped teriyaki sauce  Really!!   Every dish ordered stylish zig zag pattern squeeze bottle  all different sushi ordered tasted same = teriyaki! Sushi Avenue sauce each dish original unique  Sushi Avenue sushi unusual but very delicious world experience  Yama's sushi traditional fare found other sushi restaurants which bad  Except Yama dresses sushi teriyaki sauce  Why? sure but am thinking because many people sweat flavor teriyaki chicken?   For soft shell crab roll scraped off teriyaki sauce tasted delicious crunchy  Unfortunately sauce saturated nori bit teriyaki sauce flavor  Still could live it  soft shell crab roll started scraping off much could each plate  ordered 6 different plates myself every dish teriyaki sauce dripped them    Our wives complained food all night long  listened half table complaining half saying yummy was    The high point evening green tea ice cream dessert  good  But then green ice tea green ice team hope    Would back place?  Definitely not   Would recommend Yama Sushi?  No    Folks drive extra 15 minutes Sushi Avenue  screaming ectasy just tell waitress chef special  Any dish 100% better Yama's   By way no relation nor work Sushi Avenue  don't even know owners  Just fond all kinds good food  When Dad talk phone always food  1 hour call 50 minutes restaurants food since last talked  <EOR> They huge selection sushi! friends shared few different rolls everything tried awesome  am definitely going back $25 all eat try more  does busy most likely wait time but totally worth it! <EOR> The awesome part place great friendly chefs  chefs much better goyemon   cheerful encouraging try more sushi don't give Wierd looks when order act doing flavor  Similar great quality sushi   Would highly recommend AYCE sushi place  great quality fantastic value money   Sashimi salad just awesome! <EOR> Yama Sushi great AYCE! price lunch dinner both reasonable  quality fish quite good AYCE  give service friendly staff  menu selection awesome  only thing really bothered huge amount rice came nigiri sushi  fight urge climb over other side sushi bar snatch all huge balls rice away sushi chefs    The seafood salad great highly recommend it  If don't want fill rice start this  larger portion pieces fish mild spicy sauce  way better some pathetic little bowl poki salad 3 minuscule pieces tuna I'm looking Goyemon!     I menu also offers hamachi kama salmon kama but sadly when ran hamachi  salmon delicious  think nigiri sushi hit miss  most part good  love white tuna  Uni day wasn't good  Giant calm couldn't more ironic squint see it  Ika probably saddest looking thing super tiny huge bed rice    I'm more sashimi nigiri sushi type but did sample 2 specialty rolls  tried spicy sexy roll surprisingly ended eating half roll  really good indeed spicy  other tried Ellen roll  good but flavorful bit heavy me  Only good piece two    I staff incredibly friendly super attentive  never seen many people check often especially since place super packed  Whatever need brought super fast  Now good service  <EOR> This best AYCE sushi place hands down can't find comparison Cali maybe except Sudachi San Fran no AYCE though   <EOR> Excellent sushi selection good service!

Well thank Captain Obvious   else would brought them then quickly took empty plates away? Definitely sushi chef    Anyway sun beach roll very good end ended getting all rolls added extra star delayed effort  <EOR> I live LA but when Vegas always visit place  Great selection sushi clever names  best AYCE places to  place locals  Prices reasonable  usually during week but hear weekends long wait  seafood salad great if really spicy  <EOR> By far favorite sushi restaurant Las Vegas! striptease worth ordering twice! Love food almost everything menu  tried other places nothing compares yama  Any family members come town bring them yama experience best!

Great taste though course getting fresh Redondo better but Vegas best do  then giant clam! YUM! bf doesn't usually giant clam Chinese restaurants but he really enjoyed this  But limit 1 order per person uni giant clam and sweet shrimp but didn't order that  limit 1 order seafood salad per person  *picture provided*  And sushi rolls    tried many different ones can't remember them all  But did half orders instead don't stuff ourselves quickly  save room dessert!

Really friendly fast service   all eat option incredible! Great quality food! Thanks! back again sure  <EOR> Not exactly top five choices comes AYCE sushi  But am always willing try restaurant once open mind  friends visiting ones much yelpers yelpers but enjoy reading reviews notice four stars never wanted give try  Hell yay! Really all hanging family friends life    We early since holiday weekend plus friday night  friends arrived earlier since opposite town me  Talk making first impression let friends sit down before arrived  know some favorite sushi spots won't let sit down if whole party together  Once sat down looking menu really much different then any other AYCE  am much into speciality rolls more nigiri  Talk nice size portion fish nigiri  taste actually good thing sushi spots non them cut fish thick  understand people thinking more fish getting better deal looks better  thing found Yama bigger thicker cuts always mean better  felt quality fish just overall freshness very blah average best  sushi rice really sub par me  lacked any kind vinegar just felt plain rice  Since no idea fish cut thicker side ordered 12 orders nigiri start thinking good kick start  waitress yay lot  True cause no room try more menu more less any speciality rolls  did green tea ice cream  Good  Again better other sushi restaurants  Overall since such competitive market AYCE Yama opposite side town stick ones best   The service great definitely four stars comes never empty glass  Talk bringing sushi  surprise fast first round came between three ordering good round  <EOR> AYCE spot whatevs  felt quality fish pretty bad many rules AYCE  probably never good idea eat sushi desert would save your money treat yourself better place  <EOR> I've fan Yama Sushi couple years now eaten several times  2nd review   Knowing long wait times around 10pm  seated immediately but given menus until asked one  AYCE choice ordered Goyza Edamame seafood salad cucumber salad kick things off  Everything prepared fresh served quickly  rolls came next Rainbow No Name Dragon few others  All great  finished off meal some mochi ice cream  Overall place still favorite although success gone heads little hurry close rushed door end meal  speedy service freshness food come expect Yama though yet disappoint  *It appears if Yama expanding sign door said closed June 10 11  saw some guys laying tile strip mall store next door maybe Yama bit roomier next time go  <EOR> This place does even deserve half star  Came Thursday afternoon lunch then food poisoning  dead past two days  Things just gross there  AVOID  <EOR> From East Coast town work staying strip but armed rental car few days  AYCE but opted ordering four rolls all great stuff sitting amongst regular local folks nice feel home gouged because Las Vegas  Would recommend anyone comes town take rental car bus taxi place enjoy great meal!!! <EOR> This five stars AYCE la carte  $20 95 lunch   Came AYCE delicious! Some AYCE joints don't offer appetizers desserts menu but Yama does  Sat counter party four unless you're looking more privacy I'd recommend counter  order rolls straight chef rather through server    The seafood salad pretty much typical sashimi salad without abundance greens  Rather sat bed radish strings  Would recommend  Nigiri also menu AYCE hamachi pretty good  few items limit per customer such uni amaebi seafood salad   understandable    Some favorite rolls Mad Dragon although super eel sauced No Name  Note order HALF rolls some them   and if sit counter actually talk sushi chef if he talks first =] calls fun giggles  Pauw made rolls he pro awesomeness  lot rolls mayo cream cheese which isn't preference but if def place you  good moderation but definitely AYCE  course isn't ALL mayo cream cheese just saying more am used seeing menu    Finish off cucumber salad refreshing   then some ice cream which average mochi ice cream! <EOR> Before living Las Vegas lived Great Lakes region which means polluted waters dead fish smell everywhere  why never tried fish sushi shellfish etc because worried dead fish smell automatically associate any seafood it   When first met boyfriend he said he would take sushi frowned but he didn't understand why  He show fishy smell  Yama Sushi he absolutely right!  We ordered Sun Beach roll which shrimp tempura eel avocado in  salmon spicy mayo eel sauce  am kidding when say could drink spicy mayo  burning spicy all!  ordered another share he order tuna  tried well no fishy smell whatsoever  Let just reiterate senses fishy smell sensitive eat tuna fish cooked fish crab anything that!  Yama never disappoints now love eating sushi!  Thank Yama! <EOR> I Yama few times  honestly say impressed  Besides extremely small seating areas food good quality  Compared other sushi places town would consider yama even top 5  service horrible wait time horrible wait your actual food crazy! All times ive gone yama sat bar which no faster sitting table waiting outside matter  cup tea  <EOR> Tiny place often wait  Service best when finally attention tell them everything may ever want  Food comes quickly  Quality pretty good  Casual sit down place  Parking lot scary because weirdos  If think food alone would give place better rating  Good price too  <EOR> The food bad but great  service fast but forgot soups given plastic forks very dirty inside  But cheap pay for  But place compact very claustrophobic just good atmosphere    <EOR> Omfg!! where begin?!?!

Place always packed service FAST no matter order    AYCE under $30 open whole menu just sushi  only downside could take while seated when dinner hour but well worth wait! <EOR> I came some friends wait took forever  price doesn't match quality sushi service good all  employees very rude sushi mostly cucumber  If want nice clean service then don't come here  <EOR> Earlier today husband counting number trips taken Vegas five years together  Since very first time came he's telling best sushi restaurant ever  skeptical because sushi exactly fave  However! place so  freaking  good  Worth wait! did All Eat better believe stuffed face  only $24?? steal! Tried least 5 rolls including happy rainbow baby more time oh dam!! harry kiss ass no name  All delicious  favorites Hawaii Oh Dam!! Harry but DANG SPICY! Took helping mochi cool mouth down! Also missed seafood salad miso soup  Both top notch  only complaint stomach isn't bigger stop eating before exploded  Omg  am happy right now  <EOR> One best ayce sushis far  Great service waitress gave extra pitchers drinks napkins wasabi without asking  place isn't big but accommodated party 16 guys no problem  would definitely recommend spot  off strip little but only 5 10 minute drive <EOR> I may found all you can eat sushi place beats Midori Los Angeles    For $23 stuff your face every fish possible no dolphin though learned lesson Blue Fin     PROS GOOD FOOD  1 Only $10 corkage fee  Bring bottle Sake Lee's Liquor down street enjoy some sake shots your buddies   2 private room type place seats 8 10 people call ahead reserve it pretty cool    3 FISH FRESH! would think quality would terrible all you can eat price but actually very very fresh  party five devoured yellowtail salmon albacore spicy tuna sushi  great specialty rolls too no name roll literally party your mouth    4 Mochi ice cream included deal take advantage!   5 Unlike other places people your table opting all you can eat deal just buy a la carte  Convenient if someone's hungry!   CONS BAD SERVICE  1 ordered spicy scallop hand roll brought spicy imitation crab  told them wrong order she insisted albacore  tried called waiter again told definitely scallop she took back  Next came manager same hand roll told apparently mix scallop crab because don't lot scallop  tried scavenge thru roll find some scallop found NONE!!!!!! spicy scallop wherever tried lie me! told them no scallop she tried persuading its somehow mixed there     what did puree it?!  2 friend eats sushi lot he asked least three special orders waitress didn't know hell he talking about  She proceeded tell she Japanese but Korean  asked if she could ask sushi chef if she knew orders she said chefs all Korean too  Why would anyone ever use excuse uneducated food they're serving? Ridiculous    I feel complaints strong enough most three stars but price quality food great place grab dinner before hit overpriced crazy Vegas nightlife  <EOR> I ate Yama night two nights later ate Sakana    Yama won hands down  Larger portions fresher quality tv's work Match Madness accept Amex opposed Sakana  <EOR> So back Yama service horrible  wait staff attentive almost seemed inconveniencing them eating restaurant  cool  <EOR> I love place! All eat $20!!! won't able Las Vegas  Everytime am town hit place up  sushi fresh cheap california based rolls nasty rice  telling if sushi fall love place  offer all premium sushi well no extra charge  only place eat uni since normally pricey  fish nice consistency well  suggest trying seafood salad all sashimi spicy ponzu dipping sauce  also include dessert all eat price   The establishment extremely clean staff amazing! moment walk greeted seated almost immediately  soon seated waitress come take your orders beverages  always full beverages didn't sit around waiting someone come ask if ok  If want excellent service place impressive    I can't wait until birthday since next time eat some sushi there  Soemthing look forward otherwise expensive Las Vegas  <EOR> Went Sunday night around 6pm even though crowded wait seated less ten minutes  AYCE scan two menus one everything desserts appetizers hand rolls other pictured specialty rolls order few choices  delivered almost instantly! Devour those REPEAT! love system even though times confusing  place great even though its crowded know your neighbors! fun it  love waitresses urge try everything  dad's first time AYCE I'd say he liking it    Tips Bring pen mark tried! Drink green tea which included AYCE when feel you've eaten much yet still want on! D little secret  which isn't really secret known fact    Ask half rolls when just want try roll first time! Really saves your stomach  Don't skimp mochi ice cream dessert end!   or inbetween rolls D <EOR> This review based off second visit 2 3 weeks ago   Honestly first time tried place didn't think bad  felt lucky finding decent sushi place close UNLV good prices  However last visit take all back  nigiri mediocre best warm chilled supposed weirdly chewy  could barely stomach it  rolls aren't bad actually prefer cooked items raw ones  Anything fried covered sauce good they're gyoza also really good too  trying throw place under bus anything but just aware  really wanted order some ahi before left but few pieces warm unappetizing nigiri just dessert instead   Which btw recommend ice cream mochi green tea ice cream didn't strong green tea flavor kind made sad  hope review helps! <EOR> Service slow  2 hour limit but took them 10 minutes drinks 10 15 order every time  see but just slow react   Other ppl served ahead even though before them  Must busy night  buffet price worth rather ordering individually   finish all your food charge extra   downside when fish taste crap  renegotiate price? Another thing don't understand why some sushi already presoaked soy sauce  May chef's style  town better quality fish   tried all fish menu wasn't impressed any them even Uni let down  only recommendation would dumplings edema me  <EOR> It pretty good mostly packed throughout day   Firecracker roll other special rolls awesome   lot selections   Seafood salad spicy awesome   sushi bars numerous times   Would highly recommend   also Man Whore Roll fabulous! All sushi awesome all eat menu best town  <EOR> This perfect lunch laser tag   Ayce sushi   Totally hit spot made all friends happy   waitress super nice even recommended some stuff   reading some friends reviews said bad service well glad anyway cause awesome   I loved dessert included plum wine ice cream sweet!

Perhaps  Good sushi ? any stretch imagination  tried 8 rolls fell two categories bland sickly sweet  fish itself ok sushi chefs knocked rolls pretty fast generous give two stars  $70 bucks two drinks tax tip ? even remotely worth it  <EOR> Ask any sushi aficionado Las Vegas least week where best rolls may answer always Yama Sushi   Located city's lower class areas strip mall inhabitant does serve some best freshest most innovative fare genre   Another those AYCE places All Eat Yama offers its own take both traditional read Sea Urchin California Roll etc  new and or unconventional such rolls provocative name Happy Ending Minute Man   Crunch newest element pervade American sushi great supply Panko doing its best supply umami   With individual prices $16 95 per roll even finicky diner may almost eat couple hundred dollars worth good food lunch price $22 05 tax   enjoyed favorite Ikura a k a  Salmon Roe addition raw quail egg slithering atop   large ruby pearls burst refreshing brininess which complimented unctuousness tiny egg   Other winning rolls pretty much anything listed though palate leans toward spicy sauced versions   Special items allow per customer marked accordingly   include nicely fried soft shell crab Salmon Hama Cheek Salmon veritable slab barely cooked salmon meat which could nice small meal itself bowl salty Miso soup seaweed salad   Service bit roller coaster sometimes right target other times perfunctory   many Asian eateries country website put mildly disaster    But going restaurant web skills right?  As any AYCE locale sushi otherwise arrive hungry rush   Also pay attention menu's various disclaimers warnings including advising diners eat ALL rice lest charged ala carte dining   bit harsh but creations average buffet style chunks rice rumor fish   full bodied flavorful so    eat enjoy! <EOR> Pretty decent sure when lunch dinner time  kick if finished eating  don't think sitting talking let your food digest order more buffet  Overall food good  If don't eat all your food charge which good way cut down wastefulness  <EOR> Love place!

UNLIMITED UNI  I would happy even if uni bad   Luckily sea urchin lovers uni bad   It mediocre maybe even little better mediocre  YAY!  But really   only good thing    First foremost am very considerate when comes any kind AYCE restaurants   I lower standards appreciate fact stuff myself 'til loathe myself  Especially low lunch price $21! What  Uni too? WHAT   SERVICE Eh  Friendly first but started dwindle obviously getting annoyed us   We party 8 why bad start 40 50 pieces sushi?  Yeah read your rules  BTW order your server sushi list  Inconvenient especially AYCE And if you're going put order little time then least let know  Jeeeeez    FISH QUALITY Not there  Period  The tuna almost brown  da    Oh sushi rice? bland  Fish rice ratio? Idk but more rice fish sure    Actually did another thing  The menu huge variety even free dessert 1 per person But no green tea mochi ice cream? Weird   This place isn't bad if really want just sushi wasted just don't come big group expecting good food  <EOR> Finally made Yama Sushi years driving reading sign  dinner very surprised see people waiting in! put name list dinner 2 seated few minutes 15 minute wait estimated  guy taking names doing pretty good job getting people seated ASAP  place packed wall wall diners probably many UNLV few blocks away  saw some guys having looked seafood poke found called seafood salad  ordered each liked very much  ordered UNI but don't know why takes long prepared am thinking must frozen since something everyone eats stand eat  UNI order came probably 1 2 hour ordered just OK fresh flavor like  Other everything really good overly sauced up  Tasty Goyzas fried perfection! Seaweed salad good too  Hawaii roll great probably favorite  also ordered giant clam brought over red snapper but don't care really  Overall great place but far Henderson  Even back probably current #1 place sushi  Many other Sushi places lowered standards lost diners  <EOR> I *hated* Sushi until fateful night dragged Yama Sushi   I hadth seafood salad thought yummy  friend informed raw fish encouraged try Yama Crunch roll  Since then hooked sushi general  keeps coming back Yama Sushi GOOD rolls are!

The host kind seat quickly sushi bar server appeared soon sat down  Nice! ordered Kiss Ass roll mood something really spicy  well oversauced  Way much sauce  menu read hot pepper sauce tangy creamy very little spice needed little sweetness  shrimp inside Tender flavorful  Shrimp tempura spicy tuna hot pepper sauce sounded promising spice but creamy gag sauce all over place     A couple quick shots sake forget sauce server quick check it outta likely last time  service good but really couldn't stomach thought another roll  If ever find myself back I'd stick basics sashimi fish looked nice would order all sauces side  2 1 2 service tender flavorful shrimp  But really wouldn't venture way Yama  <EOR> Yama go to sushi spot  Dancing Sheets No Name must tries! rarely anywhere else because $21 $25 AYCE sushi depending whether lunchtime dinnertime such great deal   The place always packed but never disappointed service  Occasionally waiter forget roll but when you're ordering 5+ rolls time expect? They're quick new roll just few minutes    I would highly recommend place anyone looking yummy AYCE sushi spot  <EOR> There would more stars review but happy food  father did all eat  non sushi items bit bland really use suace rice sushi really mushy texture making bit unpleasent  <EOR> Amazing sushi disappointed don't let look location restaurant fool you! <EOR> Yama once awesome place but now turn crap  reason forgotten reason became very popular very awesome presentation quality sushi  Now its rush rush rush really doesn't matter some sushi chefs which some them shouldn't even there  Paul   couple them Great Awesome chefs Jun when first started going 13 years ago longer  Farewell <EOR> My first time here  great lunch place AYCE sushi  loved Mixed poke salad soft shell crabs pretty good   Finished off strawberry mango mochi balls very fulfilling lunch  Must visit Vegas  <EOR> My boyfriend going years  Unfortunately quality food drastically declined  waiters still attentive pleasant but actual sushi chefs could work attitude  While ordering food he cut off said good enough now moved next customer  rice roll hard  positive he aware well since would've impossible feel old hard rice while making roll  We're going back place  now Doh sushi  way bigger quality food way better Yama's  <EOR> Excellent food!   seafood salad amazing!

ended some ice cream delicious well   A few things note bill came $60 tax tip 2 people  bad quality sushi got  order anything menu some things only order per person Ellen no name rolls   could gotten three each those since three us but decided to  sure if restaurant employees strict policy but didn't try test it  restaurant no wasting rule  If example decide eat fish only your sushi rolls don't want eat rice then charged    Again sure if restaurant enforces but stated menu  only menu table  kind difficult try stare menu 2 year old being interested using menu toy well  guess norm because all other tables looked menu  gave check before done eating  wife wanted more ice cream asked handing over credit card  Needless say bad decision pay then ask more food  never ice cream waiting while writing tip signing just deciding leave   This place still gets 5 star review despite shortcoming ice cream  Perhaps doing favor because left stuffed! We'll probably back next time visit Las Vegas  thoroughly enjoyable  <EOR> I'd give 4 5 if could  third time here  see other 2 reviews happy report exceeded expectations  business lunch guest chose place  told good good experience but she willing take chance I  seated fast greeted timely manner  Drinks came fast  ordered ACE sushi three everything came timely manner  waitress did forget special order item guest ordered didn't explain if wasn't available not  She just didn't bring it  When guest reminded she stated she put order but maybe couldn't it  Rather try roll don't regularly guest opted something else came fast  sushi really good  seemed very fresh too  only reason didn't give 5 stars because favorite Sushi place other side town closer home  Overall all great lunch all left very full happy  <EOR> This hidden jewel Vegas  diamond rough  lot towner's don't know Yama because off Strip  Don't waste your money any other sushi spot Vegas  Eat Yama once you'll never wanna eat another sushi spot again! $25 all eat tons choices great staff  All your typical appetizers all your typical rolls sushi sashimi  But puts Yama above all others special rolls! Many tasty selections choose from  order half full roll most rolls rolled into seaweed cones request Son Beach hand roll!!!     Hands down Yama best sushi spot all Vegas  Don't anywhere else satisfy your sushi fix  You'll regret it!!! <EOR> A real disappointment  If know anything sashimi sushi quality food served here  high expectations walking based raving reviews yelp but oh goodness    really see anybody could rate place anything other star    Pros none no kidding    Cons Ambience cafeteria looking set small tables crammed into tiny space  Service grab waitress waiting 5 minutes all waiters waitresses passing table without paying any attention  Then placing first order find something else want order but waitress tells wait until first order comes out  Ummmmm     left 45 minutes sat down more half first order come out  done waiting     Food Sorry but unbearably horrible  spice everything even white tuna which very telling its freshness lack thereof   uni dark brown color tasted bitter sweet  Even salmon mushy   Rice way sticky way much    I travel lot internationally  many really many different restaurants some good some bad  would without hesitation call five worst restaurants ever last decade life    Vegas many awesome restaurants  Save yourself trip somewhere else  family dinner another place bit  <EOR> Ordered take initially forgot miso soup but caught that  Then leaving find forgot roll ordered top all sushi definitely below average  would come back recommend place I'd advise anyone orders take sure order complete  Update girlfriend now food poisoning  spent second half day vomiting unable anything  no idea why place many stars would advise anyone avoid place all cost  <EOR> What fun  Great sushi  Love selections  Harry Potter  Delicious  Double Salmon Really Good  <EOR> The 5 stars food quality   awesome neighborhood sushi bar much better some expensive places strip   atmosphere nice more family style setting   Great all eat option  <EOR> Great sushi great price all you can eat  Occasionally drink service slow tables  <EOR> It horrible service experience  food great am going completely honest  But service beyond horrible  took 30 minutes PIECE LEMON!!! ask three times lemon  third time when finally enough asked if ever going lemon  response snobby little care  also ordered two appetizers actually table two minutes before lemon  also seated before two couples next us  Both them received rolls ordered before us  ordered some same rolls them  couple arrived thirty minutes still received rolls before us  All ordered start off Wet Dream Son Beach  still took over thirty minutes them  servers seemed annoyed every time mentioned where rolls were  hands down worst service ever received any restaurant  beyond mad when left place  Extremely disappointed place!!!! <EOR> Yum!  birthday place PACKED   Good sign   seated right away because agreed eat bar server quickly brought drinks appetizer fried mussels   delicious    The chef making food attentive though he did seem forget husband most time!

Every sushi roll ordered FELL APART  rice fresh all fillings fish meat would fall down roll  Service also quite disorganized   I am genuinely surprised Yama Sushi received many rave reviews  If sushi immediately breaks apart it  But next time visit Vegas pass  <EOR> like any other all eat sushi roll joint  nice people working though  but since found goyemon which way more awesome  <EOR> I come often  often fact  tried around 5 all you can eat sushi places Vegas definitely best one    It gets busy during lunch time always come early just before end lunch service otherwise may wait 20 40 minutes    The only suggestion over cook beef teriyaki  Sometimes tough  Please let customers more portion Palm Job roll  love it! <EOR> BEST SUSHI EVER!  staff always friendly service great sushi menu excellent!  definitely most favorite sushi restaurant town because cheap all you can eat price fast service is!

For nigiri sushi sampled red snapper scallop halibut   Red snapper usually most favorite because usually citrusy sauce put but alas red snapper bone dry   and little warm  liking   fact felt all nigiri could little cooler   For rolls tried caterpillar double salmon deep fried mussels son beach   little disappointed rolls because caterpillar double salmon extremely dry deep fried mussels son beach way overly sauced   no middle ground Yama   However another plus place order half rolls try see if them   Like said   it OK would give them try again  <EOR> Best sushi vegas   Quality great sushi chefs reasonable prices hard find   Especially close vegas strips   Celebrated friend bday came sang made fish roll candle it  going Yama sushi over ten years never disappointed    If your fan rice   seafood salad   spicy mild creamy   Big recommendation  Try lifer me <EOR> Best all eat sushi Vegas  wait bit seat but good sushi made fast ton options  <EOR> A super popular all you can eat sushi experience lots easy flavors  There's something everyone prices very reasonable while having better average assembly line sushi  <EOR> I Yama twice both times sat sushi bar   packed sometimes hard attention chefs they serve bar directly   being said   it worth wait!

Yum <EOR> Yelp    Yelpers didn't let down suggestion   As watching show Fremont Street ok kinda cheesy but Vegas newbie decided sushi dinner   Many many places off strip choose but hungry! Love Nobu all but wanted some serious eating   Read reviews chose Yama   Close enough both Strip downtown Plenty parking  Crowded but seated right away All eat pretty simple $20 ?? lunch $23 ?? dinner Make sure eat everything no leaving rice nigiri no leftovers truly all u can eat! Fresh tasting assorted rolls nigiri noodles    All excellent! Our favorite Spicy Sexy Roll  spicy flavorful!

Those people obviously mid westerners teenagers something  Listen pushing 30 grew San Francisco recently moved vegas grew family owned restaurant 25 years  expect sushi very good yeah? cold food totally acceptable though probably won't sick  hot food definitely alright  buffet good   Anyway If end meal meaning dessert wasn't horribly disappointing would felt pretty good experience here   We dinner buffet  good hot food  being sit down buffet rolls sushi average buffet quality whole heck lot flavor   The amount time takes them come take your order time takes them deliver table space can't overeat point sickness    weekday dinner $24 pp not including tax tip includes hot green tea other drinks included    The desserts choices SUCK ice cream mochi thats it   green tea ice cream literally no green tea flavor it  Beware plum ice cream bubble gum ice cream frozen plums gross plum ice cream supposed taste like? Chocolate mochi good but you're only allowed mochi per person!!  Their desserts pissed off   If owner cares read which don't think since place obviously really busy probably no need change anything if dessert expensive guys least some creamy goji soup pudding just better quality ice cream please? Even cookies do!  If good desserts might 5 star sure solid 4  <EOR> It's pretty cheap all eat sushi lunch dinner $21 lunch 24 dinner rolls really good fish esp white tuna SUPER soft didn't day old fish taste  fish pretty darn fresh  desserts delicious too!  The restaurant itself really small feel pretty snug sitting inside but taste great! <EOR> This all eat sushi  definition AYCE order whatever roll would eat regardless time day  service bad mediocre always seem rushing people out  don't recommend place If more four people joining meal dining area very cramped always loud  Good food though  provide good tasting food compensate all cons eating here  <EOR> Worst service ever during lunch ! server totally dismissed contact other waitress check California roll took 30 40 minutes make  fck takes long California roll?! spent more time waiting food made half time playing soy sauce  never going back spring mountain Yama better service you'll food your table <EOR> Good Sushi comes amazingly fast  comes fast  baked rolls come  normal amount time they're baked! No Name Roll favorite but many excellent choices  am tempted take off point because Harry Potter roll worst roll still good! damn show some respect Boy Lived! Great Service   Bad place shoebox popular you're going wait  Also party discovered if take down 15 rolls between three people waitresses going talk it  Which probably healthy shame  Also place gave diabetes but think am partially blame  Also close enough table next feed each other   The Bizarre Mounds Sushi Seafood Salad Ice Cream full  hell going here?  Will return  <EOR> This go to place AYCE sushi Las Vegas   It isn't far strip decent selection choose from  There's decent parking since strip mall   I would recommend sashimi salad since lot fish uni bad both only 1 per customer    Also soft shell crab always good  I think just getting those 3 above gets your money back everything else order money well spent   There wait try before lunch dinner rush   As comparison 12 23 5pm only free seats bar  <EOR> So good !! Good service   times busy but worth wait!!  Try seafood salad sun beach   many others too    delicious yum yum <EOR> A sushi buffet vegas? account reads sushi buffets place business  check out   Most things good  mean basically sashimi poke amazing forgot called   Some baked rolls sort     odd  But all all good would come back  <EOR> FOOD We did AYCE during lunch $20 person   We tried good chunk menu especially specialty sushi   everything hit miss  lot rolls seemed kind dry bad quality?    sure but off   Some highlights Wet Dream Minute Man Yellowtail Halibut Green Mussel  AMBIANCE The restaurant kind weird layout where two rooms  also felt little cramped    SERVICE Servers very nice attentive but kept messing order  would give plates DIDN'T order would forget plates DID order  also don't don't give paper mark your order   tell them want every time    TIPS Definitely AYCE try variety dishes  <EOR> Best all eat hands down  Quality control excellent fish always fresh those know spot fresh fish know place legit  First review but eat several times over years  <EOR> Hands down best value AYCE sushi sashimi all Japanese themed eats  Great fresh quality seafood amazing selections just rolls  LOVE hamachi kama menu every place does don't skimp fixings    When town must stop satisfies cravings hits food coma spot!

Many reviewers must Las Vegas no idea fresh fish good sushi supposed be  Fail!   Everyone nice friendly would rated place 1 star  <EOR> When first moved Vegas came 118 degree day while in laws town discovered all you can eat sushi was  foolish because stuffed ourselves beyond capacity boiling hot day mother in law experiencing being drunk first time  MANY leftovers charged $18 overage fair enough    Since fateful June day 2013 eaten LOT AYCE sushi nearly every week   but only third time Yama  probably last visit    You count Yama being jam packed people any given moment much they've nearly doubled size since first visit    and doesn't feel any roomier  jam table wherever 'available' two foot square space  Mood lighting would describe brightness inside which isn't always good you'll see few people using flashlight smartphone read menu  Yikes    When arrived Friday friends already waiting approached table three waitresses serving night a bit overkill asked if knew wanted     I politely told Yes sit down look menu  totally thrown off  much never ordered usual order all ended things she just awkwardly suggested opposite taste preferences  Crazy    When comes palate can't spicy things theory overdid youngin' broke mouth  being said didn't try spicy tuna roll but three guys table normally shovel them down gullet returned ordered because 'it didn't taste right'   and good enough me    The nigiri good size any roll half roll exception those which only 5 6 pieces because size wise already half roll  seaweed salad point odd mention seaweed salad know but good!   Sometimes there's much dressing ? making slimy but just right  Also whatever chef's special brought over delicious    The sushi just okay here  phenomenal nor memorable but if you're okay being jammed pressured order squinting your dinner mates while sipping nasty tap water celebrating least 8 birthdays 60 minutes then place you  least bit cheaper only $23 per person    Oh! something great fantastic plum ice cream let everyone table mochi even if they've already ordered dessert     it's small things  <EOR> Been number times almost every time Vegas always left full good mood   back few weeks  <EOR> Awesome    wait time your order AYCE less minute  Very fresh innovative rolls  <EOR> Hands down best sushi Las Vegas !

Ps sun beach wet dream all time favs  Try place u love quality price only 21 buks Lunch  <EOR> They horrible customer service  said wait time 30 minutes ended waiting hour  seated took waiter 15 20 minutes notice take order  Once ordered food good but just wanted little side sauce ask 5 times them finally give me  also messed check once asked them then said they'll take care didn't anything complain once again  Customer service awful just seems don't care  probably never come back again  <EOR> Good cheap eats   my place AYCE Sushi when am Sin City   Food 5 5 Been couple times food quality pretty consistent   Interesting names sushi items censorship needed those not of age yet generous selection rolls sashimi non fish dishes   Really love sweet shrimp never comes fishy smelling salmon nigiri uni nigiri soft shell crab roll   the list on  think am going through withdrawal now am thinking food   also complimentary mochi ice cream could challenge because you'd probably sushi coma heaven time   But resist mochi ice cream ?  Service 4 5 Friendly efficient   Plates cleared when empty next round dishes come within minutes placing your order   busy service might slow but once server's attention things done filled quickly   Ambiance 3 5 A bit outdated but cares long food service both top notch   bit small type crowd generate during busy hours  seats bit uncomfortable perhaps enough cushion tushy? floors sticky but restrooms clean   They sushi bar manned 3 4 sushi chefs time  Behind sushi bar there's panel mosaic photos appear island backdrop?  located strip mall easily pass if don't pay attention sign   truly hidden gem   Final Verdict Yes frequent visitor when am town! <EOR> The sushi seriously amazing  fresh lot rolls choose from  even pictures show most rolls look like  Try sun beach crazy roll  Super good     The bad bad bad customer service  Wait times over hour group 4    CARMEN she's hostess but she didn't feel welcome all seated middle entire restaurant made some party  saw empty table corner she said oh  reserved party 8  nice tone either  Then saw party come seated their  Except party 4     Nice     Our server very nice tho tried shitty service Carmen gave us  he nice  <EOR> Previously wife living town Lancaster California while addicted all you can eat sushi bar called Big Tuna  Best place ever excellent sushi excellent service excellent ambiance  Since moving Vegas though searching searching place comes close matching while yet found such place both agree Yama Sushi comes decently close    The sushi well made comes fairly quickly  While some locations where sushi comes back room temperature ick sushi still nice cool  personal favorite garlic tuna while wife's favorite baked green mussels  rolls all pretty good yet find didn't really enjoy though suggest being careful anything cream cheese because overpowering  Oh! all eat desserts well! Love mochi? much like!  Downsides? hate when order soda give especially all you can eat place  generally just stick water then  Also sitting bar any real length time murder your butt but best place all you can eat sadly    All all best place sushi wife found Vegas far tried quite few  Don't towards closing hour should excellent experience!! <EOR> If you're local DON'T COME HERE  Sitting next local service way better  food came faster servers came them 10 15 more times then table  ordered short ribs short ribs two servings before ours  OMG  locals literally 2 feet away table  Food great  Philadelphia roll best  honored avocado allergy  <EOR> We love place  Its must stop when visiting  use live Las Vegas but now reside Portland Oregon where don't AYCE   say whhhaaaattt  know CRAZY  but visiting restaurant even better  visit Sunday night 7 other people  Full restaurant that  but service always great good time   couple dishes didn't order placed table  Then noticed table 20 minutes waitress took gave table behind us !!

Less busy little no wait   Also plus Desserts all eat  least servers always give me   Hmm put star back ] <EOR> I honestly think place little over hyped  feels sardines there  always super packed even close being enough space actually enjoy your meal without being constantly bumped into  Claustrophobics beware!  The sushi good enough but most rolls drowning cream cheese while am fan cheese creamed seriously much place   The only other thing say major factor three star rating customer service  Every working looked hated working hated people worked hated lives general    Probably stick Daisho Sushi since its close home everyone least pretends happy  <EOR> Four Yama Sushi last night very good experience   others said sushi seems fresher more flavorful other AYCE sushi places  lot unique rolls enjoyed all them  boyfriend especially liked shrimp lover's roll liked kiss ass   The thing really liked Yama service  feel lot AYCE places try slow down checking often  however usually ones ready reorder waiter kept coming around see if wanted more items  also very good refilling soda water  Despite fact always line never feel rushing appreciate that    I've heard many good things them but always busy didn't eat here  glad came few birthday celebrations say agree majority reviews say worth wait! <EOR> This place BEST!

Awesome half rolls so could try more sushi etc etc  Great staff especially waiter Lester friendly polite efficient ! We'll definitely come again great AYCE menu whenever we're town! <EOR> I'm writing 1hour experienced all hype   I expectations place all reviews friend reassuring its best town    if  best town its pretty slack standard     The service good  hostess prompt little unorganized confusing order names people waiting seated which could solved simply using numbers    Don't fire she's cute   Jokes aside lets down impressive   While getting seated ordered soft shell crab appetizer recommended fellow yelper  Disappointed heavily breaded overcooked wasn't nice golden brown but dark borderline singed brown sauce accompanied didn't compliment all  decided just hastily consume food down drink   I love spicy tuna its many variations but extremely disappointed flat tasted! No tang no kick no flavor just rice  Moving onto soft shell crab there's no prominence its taste crab lacked significant flavor say hey crab! tastes great! None that   Moving third fourth set came devil man rolls devil roll flat failed when touched palate why give such name if fails deliver  next roll faired little better its doesn't all way impress but stops short uncertainty  jalapeno sauce gives mild tinge attitude but its contents just doesn't hit mark   Man Whore  idea taking sushi coating cheese throwing oven most appealing  first roll down smoothly thought night going turn roll  Come second roll just abruptly ended wtf! suddenly found myself trying figure weird mound meat top roll wth exactly cutting corners cost using ground beef pork chicken? fish? Why does feel eating someone's leftovers     Last roll night  Before calling night grabbing disgusting check greeted final plate dubbed No Name person making sushi  Tuna Salmon wrapped green something    assuming lettuce coated jalapeno sauce God knows else  custom creation felt more character creativity involved well balanced morsel hint tang mild spike dash sweetness  Thank Mr Jun  In closing wth you're still reading this   go find another sushi place if you're looking something special something doesn't taste flat  <EOR> 3 5 stars  Yama say sure dang efficient! whip sushi its premade service attentive  Saturday night 5 30ish hoping dinner rush place already busy!  I can't really comment raw fish tasted cannot eat time BUT unagi pretty good  husband said he enjoyed scallop yellowtail uni etc  BTW when menu says spicy tuna spicy crab etc   it's pretty dang spicy! nigri bit overstuffed rice but other hubby said fresh  Another thing threw off huge stack salmon cooler precut   gross! Mussels miss but think overall everything else good    We probably back eventually when try fish! <EOR> Two years ago husband see iHeartRadio Festival Las Vegas stopped restaurant based recommendation best friend   loved AYCE there   time came 5 children  Shrimp Tempura Hamachi Kama No name roll seafood salads soft shell crabs Gyoza name few dishes ordered several times  They all loved foods ordered AYCE dinner menu children said best AYCE sushi ever too   agree  Can't wait eat again   Highly recommended  <EOR> First time coming but knew all eat worth it  came big group more 10 quickly seated because early right when opened    Most sushi comes roll which including sashimi rice together  pretty easy full  All portion pretty big well  ended ordered many fishes but still finished them  Lol all dishes pretty fresh warm  oyster fried shrimps    Overall pretty nice restaurant good environment especially all eat Vegas  If want all eat Vegas pretty much more expensive compare one  if Asian food definitely recommended  <EOR> Best Sushi town   All eat 20 bucks best deal u ever find  and includes almost everything menu just sushi  My record 48 piece Can that? <EOR> This place winner! all eat best deal ever invented    The Wet Dream roll good  seafood salad ordered TWO because yummy    I feel ordered everything menu everything yummy tasty  didn't dislike any things ordered    I am definitely going come back when back Vegas  <EOR> The food terrible  heard great things place but unfortunately worst sushie ever had  ordered Man whore roll Vegas roll tasted store bought sushi rice mushed together fish itself tasted fish didnt even eel sauce! extremely hungry when ate ended forcing myself finish roles   also asked extra ginger wasabi which did receive unfortunately returning  <EOR> Another mediocre sushi place   It pretty crowded when split into two parties seating easlier   Everything just    okay  didn't really expect anything great since pretty far inland Nevada desert   You da ma too! spicy tuna w salmon spicy mayo underwhelming Salmon nigiri fresh Alaskan salmon roll pretty skimpy  Points having unusual sometimes suggestive names special rolls  <EOR> This bitter sweet review  Talking place only more popular!

Just bit Yelping find brand new cheaper better tasting sushi joints around valley   Don't casual sushi goer getting your money taken   many other places dishes tried same price! <EOR> I've sushi craving while now all talk threads asking favorite sushi place decided try place out    We walked busy which thought good sign because then must good right?

Definitely not  <EOR> When hankering some sushi ultimately know going expensive experience  However some spots offer all eat AYCE experience runs gamut being good downright terrible  While service bit interesting ambiance somewhat confining well made sushi rolls more its shortcomings keep coming back more   The menu certainly offers your normal menu would expect along special rolls define sushi establishment  chef specials amusingly named certainly offer array flavors  man whore roll interesting spicy salmon spicy tuna cream cheese certainly good starting point  wet dream alright but essentially california roll while Son Beast certainly good offering sweet savory spicy mellow  fresh fish pretty good well cut while rice nicely rolled   Service reasonably attentive water glasses rarely empty while sushi arrived nice progression wait wasn't excessive  I'd suggest ordering more when roll left table  certainly loud little rambunctious but think part charm    Tables rather close together might overhearing table next you  Probably good idea discuss business merger chat insider stock tips got    Plan reservations otherwise might wait  waited 20 minutes table which wasn't excessive but didn't peak night either  You'll thank suggestion when wait 105 degree heat    All all definitely good value your money definitely better options affordable good sushi  <EOR> All ca eat sushi Good price Las Vegas Missing star cause Service should more improved  ordered cup water never came until called waiter 3 times  <EOR> A couple years ago friend mine told place best sushi freshest fish  Why heck did take long finally try it?  Simply put Yama Sushi awesome  wouldn't know outside  typical Vegas strip mall near corner Flamingo Maryland  Walk inside just automatically feels you're treat  decor seems very traditional Japanese  looked crowded but seated immediately   So how's sushi? Amazing  definitely lived expectations  tried crazy but think incurred some decent damage   * Miso Soup * Edamame * Seaweed Salad * Seafood Salad * Soft Shell Crab * Salmon Kama * Unagi * Ikura Quail Egg * Yama Roll * Roger Roger Roll * Soft Shell Crab Roll * Dancing Sheet Roll * Mochi Strawberry Mango Chocolate A definite must order Seafood Salad limit per person   basically plate sashimi stirring some mild spicy dressing  know no other AYCE menu offers sashimi  Pretty much everything ordered delicious  only thing won't order again Soft Shell Crab appetizer  Breaded Panko deep fried just little oily unnecessary  stick sushi salads next time   I'm sure if lucky but service incredibly fast  Since only hour closing time started marking things paper menu soon sat down  camera car soon back seemed items just kept coming rapid pace  Fortunately eat rapid pace!  By way $22 95 dinner cheaper AYCE sushi spots  much but worth mentioning   I've said before really picky when comes sushi  Lately holding back five star ratings  Yama Sushi deserves five  fast service delicious fresh offerings very competitive price just does AYCE thing right  <EOR> It's oldest AYCE restaurant town but still very popular  always packed every time go  Good price delicious food! Chefs very friendly also servers  Love rolls yummy sauce fresh fishes  <EOR> Best all eat <EOR> I thought bad sushi before but disgusting  fish quality definitely best  only thing decent seafood salad  friends sat bar  four people he only gave three plates wasabi  When asked another plate he rudely said he already gave us  waitress actually friendly comparison but food worth it  rather spend extra dollar long wait time eat Sakana even Kaya  returning   Update all ended stomachaches  afterwards <EOR> After having Oyishi sushi Wednesday decided truly compare two highly rated AYCE sushi joints    First all restaurant bit small crowded   try plan ahead reservations might stuck waiting line 30 min so   The food very fresh tasty   We started off soft shell crab agedashi tofu love salmon roll   softshell crab mediocre wasnt big fan type batter used fry crab   agedashi tofu small deep fried tofu normal agedashi broth mediocre well   ilove salmon roll pretty much philly roll but loaded excess amount cream cheese   Next ordered mountain nigiri salmon halibut garlic tuna uni sweet shrimp yellow tail many more   All very very fresh delicious   Comparing quality oyshi id say same level if better     There 2 key items made yama rise over oyshi 1  hamachi kama 2  unlimited mochi   hamachi kama grilled perfection lot flavor   Unlimited mochi speaks itself   Overall definitely recommend Yama if dont mind drive down flamingo maryland  <EOR> Excellent service great food! The all eat huge selection if want more 2 specialty rolls then more worth cost  <EOR> Without doubt best all eat sushi Vegas  actually AYCE sushi taste! menu shows favorite rolls well worth it  Service bit slow times  place always crowded but great! <EOR> We reservation Yama because party 9 people celebrate birthday  When arrived told would need wait 5 minutes table entire party present   ended waiting well over 15 20 minutes since no inside seating forced wait scathing Vegas heat    All but persons party ordered AYCE  say AYCE affordable limit 2 hours which nice  But never brought roll requested even reminding them when everyone else food but me  end meal still hadn't gotten forgotten roll but point ready head birthday drinks   Overall pretty meh  Nothing write home certainly worth standing 115 degree heat 20 minutes  <EOR> Excellent service!

Jackpot!! know where going every time hit Las Vegas now on!  Having recently become addicted sushi hopped Yelp arriving Las Vegas find where good sushi places around are   wasn't necessarily looking high class sushi bars hotels but just good sushi general even if off beaten path little bit   Well all good reviews Yama Sushi could try it!  drive wasn't far off strip enjoy seeing other areas Las Vegas  bonus me   Yama Sushi located shopping center small sushi dive lucky didn't wait table  And read hear rare occasion     usually wait Yama Sushi especially during peak sushi hours such lunch time evening time    Anyway greeted very friendly hostess sat down table   Having burned good AYCE deals before decided order couple rolls menu instead  Next time we'll probably AYCE   Our waiter very friendly funny see couple reviews complain service but don't any complaints department all     For starters ordered Sun beach eel tempura shrimp avocado inside salmon top drizzled eel sauce!! Hands down best rolls ever had   even started asking regular sushi place where live roll just love it!

Unfortunately didn't dessert but next time   definitely become must stop place every time visit Las Vegas!

That course unless warm sushi hot restaurant  <EOR> I honestly NO idea place highly rated  came husband  seafood sashimi salad everybody raves good all  quality fish low wonder if even standard sushi grade  ran hamachi kama which totally understandable but did even let husband know until 1 hour waiting it  didn't eat any rolls  scared  fish itself looks scary wonder anyone could ever treat body horribly eating fish here  husband's uni looked repulsive  literally actually felt vomitting  place crowded busy  husband ate couple rolls he picky eater but place exceeded tolerance non tasty food  never return  Even dessert bad  green tea ice cream 0 hints green tea mochi frozen could chew it  if left freezer without covering something  Just    no  Never again  <EOR> Terrible terrible terrible service  sat under speaker friend could barely hear each other  drinks 10 mins no coming take order someone love take order  When arrived only 4 tables  Should take long service  Some lady brought over 2 plates weren't ours  sushi attempted refill drink never happened  Placed order asked check took another 15 minutes seeing box sushi sitting counter  Server looked over table nodded someone else never brought over  counter check pay  Honestly worst service ever received  <EOR> Holy sushi Batman!!!   place awesome!! <EOR> Always gamble trying different AYCE sushi places   Since highly recommended friend decided give go!  As positive noticed service very fast efficient   food orders came quickly orders taken drinks refilled etc   But quality cuts very impressive   added very sweet ponzu lot nigiri   distracting actually   Perhaps hide quality fish?  The ahi tuna nigiri served actually embarrassing   I didn't even take photo LOL   Just really rough cut poor coloring did taste fresh even during fully packed night   The amaebi cut butterflied all others before bit chewy didn't melt your mouth   The uni also runny consistency   Besides sake salmon didn't really taste anything fresh opinion   I just wasn't impressed anything here    but found plenty underwhelmed    Good luck! <EOR> Guess Yelp    Back! chosen Yama Sushi first comeback post mainly because ate last night realized never wrote review it! There's many different factors play into 4 star rating decided give Yama    First off service particularly fast but does low points  multiple occasions put order never comes out  cancel remind staff before end getting yummy food  If read reviews you'll know service very big part decide ratings    Secondly two main reasons come Yama over other sushi places because smoked salmon nigiri wet dream roll  still remember first time tried smoked salmon nigiri   melted perfectly mouth  Thinking now making mouth water  wet dream also similar effect me  unique combinator flavors ingredients leaves fighting last piece  don't know many times contemplated ordering own    The last thing want talk quality food  Each time come Yama feel quality food different each time  some days looked put more emphasis presentation use ingredients while other days left disappointed  Last night particular wasn't impressed any food ordered besides wet dream    Yama great sushi place Vegas  If you've never tried any other sushi places Vegas sure try first  While would come again feel time move something new  <EOR> ALL EAT SUSHI?!  As sushi lover delighted hear during most recent trip Las Vegas going try place  during lunch hour did wait table 5 adults 2 three year old kids   We looked menu strategically decided which rolls order share between all us  All AYCE all eat even kids which pretty good deal since lunch AYCE price $20 if purchase two rolls would probably come same price  kids half price if anyone wondering   Anyway order first round sushi came within 10 minutes ordering  ordered double salmon roll baked man whore roll  thought all sushi rolls ordered man whore roll best   Unfortunately if want order soup other miso don't any  portions things under appetizers chicken beef pretty small but everything menu AYCE if want more  always option   There limits many times order certain things menu charged if leftovers table sure only order eat  lunch half hour time limit dinner believe two hours   The sushi fresh delicious  recommend coming earlier day rather later all late risers looking lunch area  left restaurant around quite few people waiting outside table  opinion worth wait! check all cool photos well see each roll looks other things menu well while waiting! <EOR> Amazing Sushi!

Moist tender did need dip sauce came neither did want squirt lemon also garnished over it  salmon skin roll exactly that    thankfully though salmon skin stale chewy because certainly share experiences happening    The garlic tuna great but wish chef didn't overboard sauce causing rice break leaving grains all over plate  spicy tuna least favorite normally order whenever try new spot because feel pretty basic  Easier judge  Probably 2nd worse spicy tuna eaten  Why?  While understand spicy tuna spicy    this overly spicy  All could taste spice lemon  never tasted lemon spicy tuna rolls  ordered 2 orders spice starting lemon juice they've squirted taking toll stomach taste buds  husband thought being little dramatic he started digging shall say helping conquer rolls he able realize wrong    Oh hubs  Pretty disappointed uni  if read reviews   the husband almost never disappointed food let alone uni!!! Speaks volume people volume   lol   We weren't able stay long normally but did opt dessert  can't tell green tea ice cream tasted because never came  waited waited   and just point wasn't going waste time asking nor wait any longer  mean clear idea green tea ice cream tastes wasn't big deal  Kind of    If staying living nearby I'd recommend them solid ayce  busy embrace yourself having wait especially if larger party  If local trust me   you aren't missing anything your go to sushi ayce can't you   I recommend bringing stroller  If need pray aren't busy plan another place sure accommodate your stroller s    Prices May 11 2017    Lunch 20 95 Dinner 23 95 2 6 years age half price  7+ full price   Hype meter   5 stars    Enjoy! <EOR> Pretty solid sushi place being middle desert   Expect wait if come group AYCE way go! love restaurant true AYCE order anything everything desserts appetizers included   Spicy tuna roll scallions mm yummy especially because special sauce just extra spicy mayo but no complaints there  Spicy seafood salad HUGE portion tasty dressing  Salmon nigiri unagi Both solid but heavy rice  Crunchy roll ever bad one?

BEST thing place its AYCE!!!!    few staples among them recommend Fire Cracker Roll Stuffed Jalepenos tempura fried spicy mayo if little spice! some spicier others   always two orders because four pieces just enough   Harry Potter Roll Wet dream also two favorites!   Just sure if AYCE fact EAT ALL because charge la carte prices leave behind shouldn't hard because its GOOD !   The only reason gave them four stars service mostly lacking  could wait won't open certain sections waiters aren't most attentive  Doesn't matter because food super star! SUPER STARRRRRR!!!! yes threw Mary Katherine Gallagher reference <EOR> Incredible establishment service food where phenomenal!! second time would definitely come back anytime!! <EOR> Still best sushi place Vegas  Dinner $24 99 ayce does very busy weekends plan wait 30 45 minutes  <EOR> Yama Sushi    Yama Yum Yum!  Thanks friends Greg Kiks Jules Karina    steered couple towners off strip turned onto local joint all eat sushi goodness   place fun   food keeps coming   sushi delish   Favorites fried softshell crabs firecracker sushi jalapenos Son Beach rolls    okay take back    enjoyed everything!  concur yelp advice order half orders maximize sampling extensive menu   nice meal winning few benjamins betting horsies bellagio    made last dinner Vegas just super   Although waitress training she did best    all ask   meal concluded some green tea ice cream mochi ice cream!  When Vegas hit place again most definitely! <EOR> What Yama serve full size appetizers when AYCE 6 gyoza 4 shrimp tempura etc  while most other places town half size appetizers  huge plus because always multiple orders most appetizers  flip side also there's half size options most rolls try lot things  server 5 interacted friendly attentive  She great! Price AYCE great I think $21 lunch $23 dinner    What dislike Yama other four 5 servers rude disregarded items ordered requests water napkins menus etc  Each request met no acknowledgment fake quick smile before server would take off never bring asked for  sushi chefs apparently amateurs because none rolls cut anywhere close evenly  piece could 0 5 thick while another same roll 1 5 thick  rice used sushi rolls really mushy where side roll didn't even look grains rice just smooth white surface  Rolls hard chew swallow because really really enjoyable eat  Flavor good but texture also important sushi!   If you're mood AYCE recommend few places far above Yama quality experience JJANGA Sakana Umiya Kaizen on Deer Springs Paradise isn't AYCE   <EOR> Overall pretty mediocre  Whoever says best AYCE sushi Vegas ignorant decent sushi just eats basic ass rolls basic ingredients  super hungry eating all day until 5pm still everything mediocre  seaweed used nigiri super soggy chewy soon hit table    Ikura really salty fishy aka fresh Hamachi fresh sour aftertaste it Uni low quality ocean animal dookie aftertaste it  Amaebi shitload overpowering sauce hiding mediocre flavor  Tuna poki way much sauce it  best thing ate shrimp tempura hamachi kama   My first time EVER ordering two rounds nigiri because disappointed quality  2 more bucks MUCH higher quality ayce sushi Sushi Goyemon Sushi twister   Sushi twister Boulder Hwy still best opinion worth drive  <EOR> Are kidding me?  freshest most delicious sushi experience life    Unsurpassed quality everything brought table   They start off Seafood Salad  there's no lettuce around just generous chunks salmon tuna deep fried shrimp spicy rice vinegar dressing top bed noodles  could've just blissful but then came rolls   rolls upon rolls!  So clarify something when think 'all you can eat' sushi don't think buffet because that roll roll order want but eat order  bigger group more try easier finish rolls    My family bunch foodies 2 chefs group boot all impressed quality dishes    This now mandatory stop Las Vegas if eat sushi anywhere else missing out  <EOR> This favorite AYCE sushi places Vegas   favorite twist 'sexy' versions nigiri which top normal piece thin slices lemon avocado jalapeno drop sriracha  <EOR> I really enjoyed pistachio ice cream service friendly  However sushi doesn't taste fresh hope  disappointed taste nigiri love Salmon roll  restaurant overall unpleasant smell well  Won't making way back stick driving Sushi Koma future  <EOR> After finally hearing all great things friend Gina raves Yama decided join few other friends late night dinner date Yama sushi  mad took long finally come here  Although 30 minute wait 10 pm Friday night still sit sushi bar worth wait!!!
