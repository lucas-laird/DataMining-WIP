First steak eggs dollar which don't mind if food decent  steak came watery eggs undercooked  When cutting steak water under if defrosting  eggs really slimey undercooked worried going sick  downhill really disappointed  stomach kind hurt throughout night  Raised prices but lowered standards  won't back again especially when other places way better steak eggs  <EOR> Four stars because service slow lines long way over priced two us  None staff smile face either  I gave 4 stars because mimosas excellent French toast bananas foster die for  Very filling but worth great way start good morning  <EOR> Here's low down definitely must Texas Station if you're night owl love steak hamburgers! serve breakfast all day every day   pastries reasonably priced tasty rather large money   Aside things you're better off going Denny's iHop Feast Buffet only few feet past Starbucks farther into casino area   say because portions plenty whatever food fills your plate! but breakfast received anything great     didn't take two long boyfriend table   blonde hostess polite but definitely very beat smile y    Being ex hostess myself realize important very happy enthusiastic charismatic really sets mood more would think  Nevertheless didn't feel very welcome again just blah    cafe big all could see time day arrived!  no wonder other Yelpers complain wait place actually pretty small   little disorienting because believe block off half restaurant early day some odd reason another only assume open place dinner nightlight dining      Anyway good bits Mercedes far best waitress entire restaurant!  She very sweet she took initiative strike small conversation between ordering waiting food once actual began eat   kind gesture made experience better definitely felt more comfortable initially waiting table if know mean     ended ordering coffee orange juice drinks boyfriend just getting water   three egg veggie omelette green bell pepper mushrooms spinach   comes hash browns which nice some reason comes plethora toast? FOUR slices plate   Mercedes asked if wanted cheese omelette course nodded assuming she wanted preference cheese told her   Little did know charged it!  two extra dollars added bill completely unnecessary  top all also side bacon terrible idea   asked much would Mercedes told would $3 49    right almost $4 FOUR slices bacon!  Once ordered ate once slice but then crumbled rest omelette   doing coincidence Mercedes comes table little later saying if she knew wanted she could added bacon omelette only $ 99!  Really people?!  feel wallet violated no apparent reason whatsoever   Don't already enough wallet when use blasted Slot machines?     boyfriend ended getting breakfast bowl   came scrambled eggs hash browns white gravy small biscuit top   omelette beautifully made but completely totally tasteless bland   put more four shakes salt pepper Tabasco sauce even taste semi desirable   boyfriend's meal okay he put it   didn't try bite but taking small taste biscuit dry   Apparently gravy used gave eggs hash browns taste but more likely case because sodium content it   actually reason why giving Grand Cafe two five stars breakfast food iffy may may even something tasty!      Remember said orange juice coffee?  mentioned reason   Because BOTH things cost extra $3 00 EACH   Yes heard right   three dollar cup Joe  Bottom line always ask waitress much extras sides cost expect cheap meal here   family next booth ordered hamburgers apparently heard them tell waitress phenomenal   bad didn't slice cloud 9 because when looked much owed all said done very disgruntled   Mercedes great waitress which why giving Cafe TWO STARS instead one     Visitors hotel guests Texas Station elsewhere food! <EOR> So thinking I'd quick breakfast bite eat family birthday came morning  Huge mistake!!

Waiting line buffet would definitely wiser choice  <EOR> This first experience Las Vegas food which kept hearing legit  Unfortunately bad initial impression    First all took over hour half table 4 food  waitress absent entire time when food finally came told chef popped poached eggs  First all update would nice brother getting married few hours chose restaurant based convenience first place  Second all unless chef run store new egg doesn't explain more 5 minutes delay  Heck could served both them popped wouldn't cared   The food also pretty bad  Eggs Benedict made broken based Hollandaise sauce very unpleasant chemically taste  say others table seemed reasonably satisfied  <EOR> I gotta hand Robert  He saved place 1 star rating  left big tip because great personality customer service   2 years ago first came here  waited 10 minutes seat even though first line  sat waited 15 minutes server come around  tried attention angry old blonde woman works behind cash register she practically told eat d*ck lost  When server finally showed he those  white dudes speaks Ebonics  couldn't understand word he trying tell me   food came around 30 minutes later server never came around refill drink    Last night came graveyard special  expected same bad service correct expectations  took 5 minutes host come over attempt seat me  host first took table still half eaten pancake it  She then tried seat another table person still sitting it  She then tried seat another table still 4 plates dirty napkins bottles beer it  Obviously something wrong host busers here  She then sat table which far off corner   Once again years past waited 15 minutes service  waiting service could see all other servers goofing off laughing horse playing  Two servers playing tag slapping each other legs while just sitting waiting someone least ask wanted drink  Something seeing workers playing children laughing loud enjoyment while customers miserable waiting service just FUBAR     same angry blond old lady cashier she once again gave dirty look practically told eat d*ck lost  She hasn't changed all last 2 years    Finally another 5 minutes series angry attacks other guests  guest starting screaming profanity loudly began hassling manager   man woman different table angry threw menu utensils floor stormed while giving servers royal finger   other hand angry because lived Las Vegas long time ALWAYS expect bad service  Bad service just normal aspect Las Vegas life  If don't bad service  when am usually most surprised  just endure bad service never leave  tip  But things began turn around  manager finally noticed whole restaurant riot ran into kitchen found worker did great job solving situation  server named Robert provided excellent customer service also manager comp meal  He even food extremely fast  really appreciate hard work    Will back? sure will  love graveyard specials am willing endure bad service  actually saves all money when bad service because don't tip  But more happy tip Robert 20 if server again  <EOR> Of course pay for  am big fan late night specials because just god darn cheap! When hungry 3 morning really doesn't matter eat point  $1 99 pancakes okay  just taste flour  If drench enough butter syrup tastes much better! lol $7 99 steak eggs  cooked perfectly but just tasted char  enough A1 salt pepper you'll just fine  hash browns crispy    The bloody mary other hand very good!   I can't complain service because only gal working 10 tables she actually very hardworking  should staff more servers Saturday nights  <EOR> So waited day post horribly awful #GrandCafe should closed!  ordered steak eggs there  When comes smell bad person sitting 3 down could smell rancid stinch   When say something crazy look waitress   She another waiter smell he looked crazy  sorry waitress cook should both fired  no way hell did smell steak bad  around rotten dead animals smelled worse that  Then ordered something different took 15 mins come out   No manager ever came over  2nd final bad experience there  never set foot restaurant again  <EOR> We decided grab late bite cafe  Host took table which still being cleaned asked if could sit booth clean available Ruben host pleased  He made comment under breath shrugged off but didn't appreciate sarcasm  <EOR>
