Located inside O'Aces Bar Grill no sign never would found place  free specialty burger check in offer peaked curiosity hubby baby Saturday lunch   We little concerned first because only customers  wasn't sure bringing baby bar! little bothered smoke permeated into restaurant bar but think only because door separating two areas open  restaurant itself pretty bare but don't let discourage you  first class food personalized family friendly service    We started Lobster Balls  Risotto balls chunks lobster artfully presented fancy restaurant made realize your typical pub food  chose burgers knew treat  taste buds sang devoured Pulp Fiction burger  taste everything juicy flavorful patty perfectly toasted bun handmade care  husband Mad Max burger short rib meat succulent abundant  burgers enormous came fries  both full take half burgers home!

Paparazzi Grill open 24 hours bet we'll try everything menu! <EOR> Tucked into bar which tucked into obscure location certainly slow foot traffic towards restaurant but definitely worth seeking out  reminded lot Carlos' Kitchen closed    now     Gourmet Food diner prices inside bar!  Me buddy the Haywire potatoes skillet fontina cheese bacon green onions maybe couple other things Mad Max Burger topped mushrooms fontina cheese short ribs    YES SHORT RIBS! Kalifornication sandwich Chicken Guac Jalapeno Aioli usual trimmings All really tasty enjoyable   A couple complaints would televisions restaurant outdated tiny though eat bar restaurant empty    guess most people eat bar  server simply acted very stoned little hard take seriously  But he everything right though   Combined 10 20 yelp deal bill only came 7 dollars thus costing around 17 before tip great  even if full price still would bargain   I'm really looking forward trying larger variety foods most ones mentioned already reviewed  update later!  Edit Updating couple more dishes tried tried Quesadillas spot delicious  Also tried Beef Sandwich name escapes me  good but same time very predictable special case  server better though am getting idea aren't waiters but just people work bar which explains more laid back style  <EOR> ** EDIT The Chef gone but Shortribs Speciality Burgers still available**  If haven't yet more day check Paparazzi Grill out    We ordered Croque Mad Ham Sourdough french toast black forest ham two eggs over easy bechamel really delicious!  We used Yelp Check In Free Speciality Burger purchase $10 and popular Mad Max Burger Braised shortrib cremini mushrooms angus beef patty pretzel roll  Burgers huge filling   So bummed closing shop January 21st monday heard lots great things other food items pictures look great too  but due lack business Yelpers last chance tomorrow Sunday January 20th try Las Vegas' short lived hidden gems    ALOHA!!!
