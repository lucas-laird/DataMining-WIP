Also he said sometimes Roast Beef comes medium well done pink sometimes very rare guess very rare which soaked bread turned pink leaving stringy parts really made horrible sandwich   fact owner knows strings meat doesn't remove them before putting meat sandwich right   Anyway both tummy aches kept repeating sandwich all night took tummy pill finally some relief   Terrible sandwich     Montague unless stringy raw roast beef wet bread soaked blood roast beef   Sorry Rae sandwiches way should SEEN THEM would agreed  <EOR> Fresh sandwiches great service quick $10 person perfect lunch spot    Only downfall lack inside seating besides 6 seater bar but team kind enough turn outdoor heaters us!

Creamy? Peppery? said would try Chipotle Chicken Avocado instead  Husband Original 1762  Mac Cheese side   Before sat down Rey kindly wiped dried counter  later watched observe sun rotate some umbrellas better shade tables  Good guy guy!  I thought sandwiches perfect size  could stopped half but didn't ended feeling quite full finishing  Sometimes restaurants confuse chipotle bbq but isn't case Earl  chipotle smoky flavor tastes little hot without actual spiciness if sense  Husband enjoyed horseradish kick found meat tender fatty cooked perfectly  mac cheese little lackluster missing perfect balance cream cheese  <EOR> Finally earl sandwich good prices! Priced much better strip  customer service AMAZING!
