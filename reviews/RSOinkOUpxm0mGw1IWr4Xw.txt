Remember awesome thought was? chic adult she looked?  reality quite different time reveals disastrous choice she made I mean really blue eyeshadow? Katsuya girl restaurant form she still hasn't figured just why people looking small smirk   Katsuya chose trendy over satisfying  just good enough  can't believe only people who've chosen dish only confronted meager selection food fake wasabi   very least picture rubes aren't used trendy food selections   Encourage your staff ask question ever ordered dish before?  You're getting chef's best selections but portions modest intended savored if appetite may want order some rolls  <EOR> We great food service    however place dirty floors dust above open ceiling bathrooms    chairs table kind falling apart  clean place could best  <EOR> Just over weekend first time  rolls chirashi  really good  legit sushi  Chef Stephen sushi chef he really friendly recommended coupe Hand rolls we're amazing! <EOR> Love love love  appetizer portions WEE bit bigger Brentwood  Loved mixed greens shishito peppers mochi ice cream  However fan lobster dynamite  Maybe just particular lobster  Loved ambiance too! <EOR> good spot sushi design decor  Food good cocktails good  little over priced but would expect hotel restaurant Vegas  Definitely worht try if down end town  <EOR> Went dinner Saturday night  patrons young hip  Ordered rock shrimp appetizer hamachi jalapeño crispy rice free coupon SLS Katsuya special roll salmon sashimi  toot own horn but feel ordered boss  Would change thing! order second salmon sashimi because melt your mouth amazing  Overall quality sushi food amazing  Five stars sure  service other hand lacking  claimed didn't reservation but seated two quickly anyways  waitress hardly ever came check no recommendations overall mediocre  easy only round drinks when only see your waitress once  She also forgot hamachi order then charged crispy rice gave coupon  conclusion 5 stars food 3 service 4 overall vibe  <EOR> Ask Chris!

Yes did take any rolls yet but bogeyed some wasabi ginger already   He should 1 left dish 2 taken back kitchen re plated thrown out   don't think group next saw he did but does excuse action   Our platter sashimi sushi brought 10 minutes later decent looking presentation   Assorted sushi sashimi wooden serving vessel similar some boats see offered Japanese restaurants   bit annoying though again different server waiter brought quite certain all components meal   the sushi itself nothing special no real outstanding components sashimi either   seen decent reviews place maybe expectations high? although should never excuse any restaurant    they should all strive best be   in any case actually just asked sushi chefs few different fishes served he quite bit more helpful   I think only thing kept meal enjoyable wonderful dining companion   Always nicer meal when pretty gal! It also nice enjoyed drinks offered D D event Katsuya bar since only few steps seats able few tasty Burning Mandarin's Katsuya Fresh drinks    like all drink option meal!  Our waiter finally showed bit bill really contemplating whether he even deserved tip all since other removal wrong dish only other time even saw during meal   only gave 15% because he did mention pretty gal when she restroom    I know pretty shallow but true nice him  Gave sushi chef tip directly he deserved it    he actually brought small dish tuna cheek believe really good!  I would give restaurant maybe 3 stars tops but shock waiter just moving mistaken dish group next bit much  not sure try place again maybe stop drinks though pretty tasty! <EOR> SLS Las Vegas lot live to  Katsuya restaurant Los Angeles unreal   am really glad ended Las Vegas when SLS opened up  high standards when decided take friends Katsuya wasn't let down  server Chris O very knowledgable great helping pick perfect meal  Katsuya roll amazing!!
