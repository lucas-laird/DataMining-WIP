Cool interior fun place hang out  Good families too! <EOR> I disappointed several times since into new distill location North Durango other two locations phenomenal but location just can't seem catch other two locations  bartenders slow rude   ordered nachos last night served plate stale chips half melted cheese when returned nachos bartender he  told chips crappy   Jokingly he told if returned nachos cook would spit food   Joke bad customer    I live close given distill multiple chances always disappointed service   am finally done distill won't returning  <EOR> Hubby driving past place months waiting open  heard many good reviews food other Distill locations area intrigued when learned would opening near us    We gave couple weeks opening before deciding give try dinner  planned Friday work around 4 30 pm thinking could dinner crowd  Boy wrong! Upon pulling into parking lot upper level could see right off bat virtually all parking spots taken  managed find open grabbed it  Once inside bar packed!!! pretty spacious inside though but seat bar area headed into smoke free restaurant area where 6 available tables    Seating seat yourself grabbed table  5 minutes sitting server came menus took drink order  ordered pretzel bites appetizer hubs ordered Santa Fe turkey sandwich Peach D'Lite ordered braised short ribs Distiller's Delight    The drinks bar little pricey but tasted great!   The pretzel bites came cheese dipping sauce mustard dipping sauce  could've just eaten those dinner    well kind did   more later! pretzels hot soft but outer portion just firm enough overly salted either  Loved them   My husband really liked sandwich but wish could said same liking braised ribs  Though plate looked just came kitchen upon tasting appeared sitting meat hadn't heated enough  When tasted mine meat just    room temperature  politely asked server checked if could reheat mine little more which she gladly apologetically did  Another server came back plate which am assuming microwaved because he another plate under original burned  He apologized dish well  Wasn't fault but tasted again though bumped warmth little just did me  really wanted because love braised short ribs but think reheating microwave actually toughened meat  Hence    I ended eating most pretzel bites dinner heading Taco Bell 2 taco Supremes    In summary might give place another chance maybe several months but if come back it'll just appetizers beer during Happy Hour  specialty cocktails though delicious bit pricey sure want shell money again failed entrée  maybe next time stick sandwich   not much chance those going wrong  least husband liked meal  servers great though too! Very friendly! <EOR> EXTREMELY impressed! just ordered delivery two 90's burgers two salads fruit mashed potatoes BIG side ranch!
