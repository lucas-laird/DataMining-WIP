Open late until 12AM which plus   <EOR> Ramen Misoya Tomi simply best place ramen Vegas  Everyone extremely friendly ramen top notch  even food delivered summerlin postmates  <EOR> Wow such high average review rating shocked utterly disappointed time left here  I learned lesson tonight don't average star ratings read details most current reviews!   First all place recommended friend admitted dirty parking lot gas station   fine hole in the wall establishments when quality service worth description didn't deter me  Walking wasn't expected   I'm sure which reviewer described feeling authentic but assure ambiance certainly doesn't reflect Japanese culture cuisine   basic banquet chairs tables odd lighting like old library? typical table setups cheap table settings for example plastic opposed ceramic seasonings    Still point ok many cheap ramen shops   but then look menu   town many good popular options ramen joints sora monta etc  price point actually higher most   When asked explanation menu woman tried explain but unfortunately didn't spiel down ask few more questions clarify   menu didn't look ones shown wish took photo you'd able see where confusion lies   way many photos minimum descriptions there's no good flow 1 pick your ramen base 2 pick your noodle 3 pick your topping combos etc  which would've super helpful since wasn't explained verbally    Essentially there's set items your ramen lot unusual toppings even most basic choices    things ground pork cabbage seaweed not nori corn etc  asked server happens if don't want most items if basic ramen start build since don't eat most toppings not ramen least! She pointed cheapest particular row said start that   told didn't want most those items but did want chashu pork  Then she points most expensive row 11+ said if wanted chashu needed that   point annoyed having order ask almost no toppings   after she left realized I'd better off cheapest add 1 piece chashu but then thought maybe best ramen ever had  Unfortunately average  wouldn't say bad just wasn't amazing certainly worth price  broth stronger slightly more oily most places  wish explained ramen being fired same time fried rice yet expedited served immediately fried rice presented much late meal one finished eating already   understand takes longer prepare but hard ask someone if they'd food come same time coursed out   hindsight think servers trying they certainly weren't rude all but frustrated many times kept coming back clarify order since took many items out    If needed clarification coming back once    but more often 1 dish   awkward unprofessional write down correctly start or simply clarify order when take originally before leaving table   Furthermore $3 50 don't expect much half order fried rice but certainly worth wait even price  oily bland rice overcooked   embarrassing came disappointed annoyed point asked to go container not we'll eat it because super awkward couldn't eat more bite before putting chopsticks down   If only ramen shop entire city   I'd given 3 stars but eaten instant ramen home  <EOR> This place mess when comes service   we waited 20min seated which saw bunch empty tables seated right way    and everything comes wrong order  ordered two lunch specials added side cha shu  order came but without cha shu mentioned server finally came when almost finished ramen  Also lunch specials comes fried rice karake which arrived towards end   What? Shouldn't appetizers come first?Plus heater way high which enjoy hot ramen     and finally bill charged extra stuff didn't order      one star service 2 stars food    give ramen joint second chances see if service improve next time     <EOR> Come Ramen Da Bomb   love stamp card here   Every time time come service amazing food  <EOR> This place only opened two weeks    With free wife store!!!

If your looking something isn't thick salty well you've found place  Im surprised place doesn't line front yet  Another great aspect restaurant service   self serve half great service wait staff other half  Its great grab n ramen joint provides quality broth! Yum! <EOR> I generally prefer tonkatsu broth because fattier love anything lots fat content but ramen better miso based broths other ramen locations   tried Kome Mame favor Mame broth flavor over Kome   some weird notes keep being 5 star rating Kome comes fried potato   which just french fries thrown into broth   expecting potato croquette something little more Japanese   Also terms greens   I much prefer green onions over spring mix tossed top   Soggy salad really doesn't taste appetizing   noticed pictures   other people green onions random spring mix   Perhaps time day    but willing give place another chance hope quite odd 2nd time around   However noodles favorite all ramen locations   thick chewy cooked al dente   chashu wish little more flavorful but good ratio meat fat   Mame favorite since came legit shrimp tempura broth seemed richer flavor Kome   also tried karaage but seemed little oily coating wasn't crispy like   end meal very good note given free yuzu sorbet   sorbet light refreshing    I would probably order if menu!  also stamp card if eat enough bowls free gyoza = <EOR> Best gyoza Vegas!  Hokkaido style ramen need try here!  sure miso egg extra topping   Great customer service friendly nice people   definitely come back again when we're Vegas   Thank Misoya! <EOR> I consider myself regular where some best ramen opinion  usually come during lunch break work often busy compared other ramen shops area  lady working sweetest  She's known since they've opened early before interior renovation well  tried most ramens they've all delicious  broth flavorful fresh hot should be  usually lunch special side gyoza which also think some best dumplings around town  They're very soft tender fried greasy leaving any unhealthy feeling afterwards  stamp card which fill 5 stamps free gyoza wait fill 10 stamps free ramen   which think best deal any ramen shop  probably gone through three stamp cards already   partially because earn stamp each guest your party  if come party 4 you'll earn 4 stamps   and just more free plate dumplings!

Keep mind Southern California if there's category food know surely ramen  second time wasn't impressed first time but given stellar reviews decided give another shot   This shop specializes miso ramen  There's no shio shoyu nor tonkotsu found  three miso styles range heavy light  Each bowl comes bean sprouts green onions corn sea weed bamboo shoots  Add egg $1 50  decor simple tables cheap wooden foldouts wouldn't pass Ikea test   +1 star nice waitress lady   As any good ramen lover knows separates men boys broth  Yeah talk toppings chashu noodles but without great broth might well microwave pack Cup O' Noodles   I ordered Kome which lightest broths  Here's breakdown 1 Broth way heavy way salty  soybean paste overpowering miso barely present  didn't finish broth  coming someone known consume unfinished broth friends table   2 Another important measure noodle broth ratio  leaned heavily favor much broth enough noodles  exaggerating when say finished all noodles 5 bites  noodles themselves acceptable  prepared al dente thick cut consistency texture did offend   3 chashu  Oh did wrong? provided plenty 3 hefty pieces but plenty garbage still garbage  dry cut much thickly  Why did dump pork chop bowl? Also no mouth melting another quality use evaluate ramen    4 toppings fine  Bamboo crunchy  Corn corny  Though some reason place sprouts cabbage  good trade which means toppings actually weren't fine   5 jars smashed garlic but no fresh garlic found  Strike five   Vegas why your ramen terrible? friends theory compared Cali Vegas Yelp handicap  Unless buffet Goodwich subtract 1 5 stars good representation actual caliber food  place no exception   Even most severe ramen cravings would enough entice return  <EOR> One few authentic Japanese Ramen places Vegas  Definitely rice miso broth because Sapporo  Super thick cut roasted pork meat lovers  <EOR> Bringing gf daughter son best miso ramen town!
