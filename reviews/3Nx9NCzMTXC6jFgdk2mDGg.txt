If hungry want decent food great price place fits bill  <EOR> The French toast cold everything isn't within arms reach  Lots breakfast items tough cold over prep big crowd what? <EOR> Great place people no taste buds no taste  ^ Service welcoming ordering drinks front strange most important feature all food   The selection sad food definitely fresh  think Costco's snack bar larger variety food buffet   don't know but room temperature colder food typically hot fresh doesn't sit right me  top food doesn't taste good begin with   It takes 20 minutes servers standing around edges notice calling them refill  If can't wait your drink refill just soft serve ice cream machine your liquids in ice cream ain't thick anyway   Don't even bother going desserts  Nothing sweet them    <EOR>
