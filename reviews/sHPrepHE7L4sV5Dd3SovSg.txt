Alright pizza terribly dry sub par garlic knots terrible customer service little pricey  don't recommend place anybody  2 stars good location  It'll feed your hunger but even close please you  If 3 hands I'd give place 3 thumbs down  <EOR> The pizza fresh   Felt if day before   Cheese sparse lacked real cheese flavors   Pizza better frozen food local supermarket!  Disappointed  <EOR> Being sales rep am vegas Mandalay Bay convention center more would like  food court close easily accessible  lines long but servers fast efficient don't really wait long   Bonanno's me  tried rest places but pizza food court best  pretty authentic NY slice Stromboli great too   One slice side salad $10 but enough food lunch  Two slices would much   Trade show people give place shot  better other options! Hotel guests better options away convention center hotel  <EOR> Not bad overpriced food court pizza but everything overpriced when you're casino anyway  pizza big edible I'd say ok  hungry enjoyed it  When you're eating casino food always lower your standard just little bit then won't upset     At least quick bite conference hall  <EOR> I'm conference place super busy everyone seems overworked  Perhaps why pizza isn't great? pizza seemed over salty sauce wasn't flavorful crust bit tough  New York style pizza place just doesn't me  sbaro thing reheat your pizza order maybe need heat bit longer too    If you're hungry near Mandalay Bay conference center yourself favor something else instead  <EOR> If wanna order whole pizza hr half before closing because won't accept orders 45minutes before close    SMH <EOR> Horrible customer service  Super overpriced staff rude  never shop again  <EOR> This evidently Vegas version Sbarro's located pretty much all food courts which hotels evidently lifted wholesale malls various hotels  particular Mandalay Bay more less Shark Reef thing  no reason suspect any others more different though perhaps food court area some other ones less crowded  never seen Mandalay Bay anything less full capacity ever even across multiple visits   Instead thicker slice ala Sbarro's sort attempt New York style pizza  throw authenticity nearest window since they're right realm unless you're measuring strictly foldability which slice did fine with  If want anything more and especially if you're New York you'll still wanting finish wiping grease off your hands maybe your mouth  very average pizza but because hotel also very pricey matching stadiums and or airports  <EOR> The breakfast FOOD Typical food court offerings quality  horrible but nothing special  decent option breakfast especially since only choice side resort other Subway   The SERVICE cashier helpful cheerful demeanor  server horrible! She displayed stereotypical don't give @ %#  attitude  She rude invested customers    I it  early probably believe you're better just slinging breakfast sandwiches all morning but don't lay your land broken dreams act your customers  expect more high end resort  7 13 15 am <EOR> I needed hit food court before concert pizza was! I slice Hawaiian slice Meat Lover's Delight  Hawaiian good but Meat Lover's better bacon!!! Definitely pricey $6 slice slices larger side   This standard food court stuff wasn't impressed  wanted order stuffed slice which menu  asked told don't any stuffed slices   If want overpriced beer too   The restaurant located food court which deep bowels convention center also near Shark Reef   It's easily missed  Signage food court doesn't exist until you're already almost convention center   It's almost secret food court  <EOR>
