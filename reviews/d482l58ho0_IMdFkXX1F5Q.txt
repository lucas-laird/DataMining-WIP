My scallops cooked perfectly! loved its texture well together mushroom sabayon  rich creaminess sauce wasn't favourite choice sauce but hubby loved dish! loved vegetables cooked but thought plating could little prettier  Aside all personal taste would definitely recommend seared scallops because they're superb! well thought dish various textures flavours satisfy you   I liked hubby's dish orecchiette the least French dish menu! better mine day even though loved scallops  just wasn't feeling French cuisine day suppose  rich bolognese sauce orecchiette won over more scallops really delicious! If you're feeling French cuisine try orecchiette   My waiter happy and relieved? find found dessert much more satisfying scallops  Though he provided recommendations opted strawberry profiteroles because favourite desserts  addition strawberry gelato something hadn't enjoyed months! Topped chocolate sauce top loved much would've gotten seconds if hubby hadn't stopped me  chantilly also very delicious wasn't over powering fact very balanced chocolate    As waiter put finished off strong note delicious dessert!

Service ok very pretentious accommodating all children unlike Bouchon   seemed waiters managers tried feel uncomfortable because baby dirty looks    Don't think going back going Bouchon instead! <EOR> Way overpriced  filet mignon pretty tasteless  friend's NY strip fantastic  other friend ordered steak no sauce  put anyway  When he sent back brought back way overcooked  Third time charm  <EOR> My wife ate night arrived Vegas   Since coming later dined 8 30 which 10 30 us didn't want full meal   DB Brasserie offers nice assortment smaller plates which perfect   end settled heirloom beets French Onion soup   Both perfect paired great red recommended waiter   wife grew Quebec really appreciate hearty delicious French Onion soup DB did disappoint   location great bit off casino floor requested table towards back nicely insulated hurly burly  We liked much stopped back night cap next evening  <EOR> Really enjoyable dinner here  few reservations based some reviews but thankfully experience really good  escargot scallops while wife goats cheese salad roast chicken  No complaints portions good food tasted great  Wait staff very attentive constantly checking refilling water  Cocktails good too   The only minor quibble place mainly empty still sat between two other occupied tables  <EOR> Saturday night 7 5 14 7 00PM   I never around eating Daniel Boulud's brasserie Wynn before closed excited try new restaurant Venetian   inviting open restaurant large bar area dark wood furnishings all around     We arrived before other guests sat down pre dinner drink bar   boulevardier $17 maitresse $13    brasserie's version boulevardier mixture Bulleit rye whiskey instead bourbon Aperol instead Campari sweet vermouth slice orange rind   really good pour no ice mask taste heavy cut crystal glass served nice touch   maitresse served martini glass sweet concoction rum lime coconut liqueur perhaps would good drink if sitting pool but didn't work well before dinner   When rest group arrived started Terrine foie gras $24 burrata $14 crab timbale $20    All three tasted ok but delicate crab flavor overwhelmed taste overlying fruit foie gras terrine didn't punch flavor seared version could upstairs Bouchon   For dinner Tunisian lamb merguez sausage $45 sea scallops $29 oven roasted halibut $40 swordfish $42    scallops good sear them served bed sweet corn shitake mushrooms   delicious  halibut also cooked just right moist flavorful  other hand swordfish dry side kind bland   Perhaps two different chefs cooking fish night?  lamb spicy sausage tasted fine its own but seemed heavy comparison first two seafood dishes   For desert standout night grand marnier soufflé vanilla anglaise sauce $15   don't know he light airy came fast but best ever had  Roy Yamaguchi could learn thing two cooking soufflé's place  also split pistachio cherry Sunday $14   tasted great while eating overlying flavorful pistachio ice cream but lost its charm when down sour cherry ice cream underneath   Overall good dining experience  place kind empty dinner time Saturday night but perhaps because still new  also notice trepidation some dish prices restaurant already dollar two higher advertised online menu  still kind early raising prices hope doesn't mean new restaurant already trouble   would recommend know would back especially more soufflé  <EOR> This review restaurant week menu  food excellent salmon rillettes which fantastic just enough acid pop spread over your toast  pea rigatoni bright fresh loved cherry semi freddo bomba dessert  Amazing value only 25 bucks drink   I dropped star super shaky service  Drink refill issues forgot bread until halfway through service took forever process check  food great clean classic  service needs bit help  <EOR> Amazing food amazing service  Paige fantastic very patient engaging accommodating  Great wine great ambiance  definitely come back again  <EOR> My dining experience much better expected  glut celebrity chef restos phone print money luring Food Network convention demographic expecting nice dinner inflated prices  meeting someone during hour dinner break poker tournament DB very close poker room  Decided would nice take advantage better dining options Venetian since Rio sorely lacking area   Our hostess very courteous when asked if table two available although walk although didn't show huffy entitled shitty attitude probably helped take note Yelpers    offered vacant table right away   We waited promptly told waitress time constraint  mostly worked well although wave down when time head but point quite few more diners arrived bill still settled time    I chose glass wine list looked thoughtful well curated  exceedingly rare occasion available selection quality wines offered glass    Our starters burrata escargots spaetzle  latter exceptional combination flavors textures  Mains halibut Tunisian lamb  Perfectly seasoned cooked elegant but simple presentation    I would far say definitely exceeds Bouchon few reasons service better overall ambiance more intimate Bouchon deafeningly loud crowd cocktails wine list appear better food much better overall  much simple French bistro fare DB but most dishes feature Boloud's signature Med touches yet remain unfussy despite lengthy menu descriptions some   I would compare dinner courses few one star Michelin restaurants even  highly recommend visit if you're staying Venetian even if you're worth coming another hotel dine here    We didn't time try dessert opportunity return but I'd love return next time Vegas  <EOR> Another great Boulud outpost serving expertly prepared updated French classics  Flawless service cozy but energetic atmosphere  <EOR> I looking forward eating Daniel Boulud restaurant very disappointed service   took 15 minutes time seated before server came greet provide menus us   10 minutes ask menus which then came 5 minutes later   No apology server given wait restaurant wasn't even busy opinion   fair amount empty tables around   addition when sat down party two dirty napkins table needed replaced when server took order she forgot person party   She walk away then speak let know she didn't order   addition friend ordered soda while rest party ordered cocktails   all cocktails normal amount time   soda took FOREVER   all annoyed point ready just cancel soda   Soda should take longer cocktails come out  Any those things alone may notable issue but all them combined definitely left feeling irritated     As food decent    some charcuterie plate cheese plate group ordered then French Onion Soup Brussels Sprouts side  also tried short rib pasta dish other friend had   Nothing write home just average   fair little put off service time food arrived didn't give food much thought   Nothing going save experience   should say though friend duck he inhaled which he told turned really well  <EOR> Went happy hour bar  Drinks food delicious definitely best Vegas price  Shout

The Venetian advertised new app which offers thousands deals coupons various things Strip really happy find free appetizer deal DB Brasserie for every 2 entrees order    and did ordered 4 entrees picked 2 appetizers free  when waiter started getting sour serving table    if don't want give free food then don't offer begin with! When appetizers started arriving table noticed food bland just plain terrible  When waiter asked doing straight complained but he just brushed off walked away plates   really?! The entrees eventually salvaged some part meal but whole experience just expected Venetian restaurant  couldn't wait there! <EOR> Another NYC coffee shop pretending something special  why playing rock music? No really  Why?

 start service lacking  French server didn't even bother greet us  He merely asked wanted eat  no talk cocktails specials day  ordered appetizers party share which never arrived  server later admitted he forgot  compensation he offered plate Madeleine's  Throughout brunch he rarely came check table seven people  Nor did manager busy talking hostess stand  only five tables restaurant he never touched one   As far food underwhelmed  ordered Duck Hash specialty burger Croque Madame  All which lacking originality flavor  instance Croque Madame such simple classic dish yet managed ruin overly think slices ham very little bechamel overdone egg bread barely slice into   We looking forward visit long time but greatly disappointed entirety experience  put damper holiday  Unfortunately returning DB Brasserie anytime soon nor would recommend anyone else  <EOR> This phenomenal meal all way thru   Huge fan Daniel Boulud french food general excited give DB Brasserie shot   beautiful

restaurant nothing would tipped off creation world famous celebrity chef   wife both started onion soup agreed tasted much better   light cheese kind one note broth bit bland onions   flat iron steak tender some flavor but truly memorable steaks many Las Vegas restaurants   wife's rib eye cap tough very good   side Lyonnaise potatoes good all   plate steaks large wedge salad which guess served side vegetable   Again very good left unwanted salads nearly untouched   split dessert trio eclairs   just plain bad   Dry flavorless   mentioned waiter he offered bring different dessert which declined   Well least coffee good   The service ambiance better food   waiters they switched mid meal took good care answered questions useful way   room very much brasserie if looked window seen Paris street scene instead casino would felt place   fact restaurant faces casino easy find which always case when comes restaurants labyrinth Venetian Palazzo complex   Prices some dishes menu pretty high end but less expensive alternatives available well   also prix fixe menu limited choices which pretty good deal although did try it   waiter told prix fixe menu changes weekly since listed web

advantage but only bar area  ended bottle sparkling pear cider  toast special occasion friend's impending marriage  First came water traditional = tap water vs bottled water then complementary bread herby focaccia type baguette type  Anyways just easier split bill between large group opted prix fixe menu  $48 three courses  tried variety different things could try little bit everything  first two

three pieces chicken really only ate half  just wasn't favorite  also tried some steak frites very flavorful tender  dessert black white fondant over molten chocolate cake verbena ice cream  cake warm
