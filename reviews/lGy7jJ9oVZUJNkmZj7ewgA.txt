If decide check Planet Dailies recommend trying onion soup   pretty tasty!

Perhaps  But then probably only worth because Vegas just expect everything priced above norm   Note If important place eat here   Service snail's pace  <EOR> I ordered BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger  actually pretty good  But when pay $15 burger kind expectation going best burgers you've had  sure if I'd come back simply because price get   No complaints service  <EOR> I've sampled lot late night food Vegas  opinion Planet Dailies FAR very best  happy comforted when staying Planet Hollywood because knew great food come home late night  then I'd feel better morning too     There 8 girls staying Planet Hollywood hotel couple nights 8 dined together Planet Dailies around 4 AM  other night still ate but only other friend who'd stayed late me    could miss fourth meal each Vegas day Planet Dailies!

On top all birthday everyone dealt the ladies front holding menus hostesses even lady brought water wished happy birthday      except WAITER!!! might seem small thing but you'd think person your dealing most during your dining experience your waiter would wish Happy Birthday when your wearing giant Happy Birthday pin!
