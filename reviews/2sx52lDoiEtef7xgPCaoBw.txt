MAIN DISHES The Downtown Tony made three veggies sliders mushroom taking place beef patty great order choice cautious veggie food eater  beef sliders dry bun lack sauce  bun seemed just tad stale which made tough bite through  menu states come aioli but almost non existent which made dry slider  ordered side house ketchup dipping seemed remedy dryness  mushroom inside cooked perfect veggies fresh  fresh bun extra sauce bomb beefless burger    The Ravioli plate needed some T L C  raviolis themselves cooked well great flavor but sauce almost flavorless  added little extra salt pepper which huge because almost never add salt anything  little seasoning plate made sauce ten times better  plate worth try but salt pepper side    My carrot vodka cocktail super refreshing but could used just bit more punch  em' strong  Great option if you're looking something both healthy different  give VegeNation four five broccoli bushels  <EOR> Love love love place ! nice sit down enjoy vegan meal without having ask if use any animal products !!

Definitely welcome new addition downtown Las Vegas! would've posted picture yummy food but eat quickly LOL <EOR> My partner roadtripping Western month VegeNation clear cut above rest terms deliciousness  stopped first night Vegas astonished every dish shared  astonished fact returned following two mornings row breakfast  Vegan otherwise if enjoy food tastes good love here    Highlights experienced include stuffed French toast waffles tira misu rainbow roll last but definitely least chicken pot pie gnocchi  daydreamed gnocchi remainder trip beyond  <EOR> My first impression VegeNation during initial stages construction pleased Carson Street's most recent renovation  branding looked terribly place cartoonish goofy signage disappointed decision give beautiful historic mid century modern storefronts lackluster facelift inconsistent architecture lovely neighborhood   If past sloppy branding would recommend stepping inside trying some vegan fair  Once inside decor much more trendy colorful great local vibe chilled ambience  South facing picture windows provide great people watching catching rays glorious Vegas sun  great atmosphere grabbing table alone catch reading writing well meeting friends lingering while   I'm quite pleased FINALLY vegan choices neighborhood  culture filled comfort food heavy eats meat biased menus VegeNation great departure Vegas standard  Well done Downtown! Flexitarians everywhere community rejoicing  <EOR> Not bad  seating outside back really small but worth if sitting outside  Some dishes weren't flavorful told would some staff suggestions  salad pretty bland also something could thrown together home quick bite  other vegan restaurants hit home flavor seasonings  part could better  But all food seemed fresh presentation excellent well service   why gave 4 stars  <EOR> This review very challenging because vegan REALLY want place  Las Vegas very vegan friendly city but when comes entirely vegan restaurants really miss mark  feel there's notion vegan community we're allowed criticize other vegans  Due accept mediocrity praise unjustly  honest review vegan community pleading vegan restaurants need much much better    Vegenation always hit miss 5 6 times  miss items completely inedible hit items just okay  find really troubling because feel whoever chef just doesn't care food they're presenting  food bland uninspired  really depressing because vegan food doesn't way! There's much it  refuse believe chef putting forth 100% efforts anything they're creating    I am baffled Vegenation audacity buy pre made frozen mock meat serve guests prices charge  understand omnivore restaurants using Gardein Beyond Meat because don't expect them know seitan  But vegenation all plant based restaurant! Why cutting corners making own mock meat? Making your own lentil beef homemade seitan easy incredibly inexpensive  Omnivore restaurants spend much time marinating prepping tenderizing etc  real meat dishes  vegenation doing all extra time kitchen? don't worry serving real meat  They're making own mock meat  spending all time cutting vegetables making sauces? just doesn't any sense me  dishes all glorified frozen food    Now where nit picky specific dishes tried  cauliflower wings horrible  Cauliflower wings should completely cooked soft stringy like     chicken! shocker Vegenation does many other restaurants when jump cauliflower bandwagon  don't understand properly cook then tastes crunchy raw cauliflower covered buffalo sauce  Maybe some people but don't understand  appealing all  meatball sandwich uses pre made frozen vegan meatballs  sauce cheese burn your mouth off while meatballs lukewarm  PLEASE some dang lentil meatballs already! chicken pot pie gnocchi essentially same  flavorless frozen pre made mock chicken pre made gnocchi  cut vegetables maybe sauce house  just don't think should good enough standard any restaurant  could other dishes but idea    Vegenation PLEASE set your standards higher  Las Vegas desperately needs better plant based restaurants  much potential here  always continue support vegan businesses check regularly see if things improve  But vegan another need encourage better standard community people Las Vegas  <EOR> The downtown tony sliders good  dont care much 4 5 fries side red ketchup dip  veggie burger great fills up  pineapple pizza also very delicious <EOR> I bbq jackfruit tacos berry smoothie brownie sundae  Everything delicious  jackfruit resembled pulled pork spices perfect  berry smoothie actually kale but couldn't taste all  brownie sundae some grilled fried bananas really added special taste  atmosphere good loved all vines growing back walls  Staff super friendly too! <EOR> 3 star service 4 stars food  came mother sister really excited try place first time  came very busy which good sign  However reason couldn't seated even when available seats because said backed up  15 min seated literally waited 20 mins appetizers 30 more min other main courses  2 30pm didn't finish until 4pm final meals  quality food awesome however worth hour half wait  try guys again few months know place new maybe some kinks need worked out  Definitely enjoyed vegan sushi curried beans quinoa!

Everything ordered good comforting ordering 100% vegan menu! <EOR> Sorry fellow Vegans but place HUGE THUMBS DOWN!  I'm actually AMAZED place many good reviews  Like   HOW?!? Could tourists distracted atmosphere? Could hipsters distracted all hype ? knows  But quite annoying restaurant all facade quality food  Perhaps just spoiled being chef all but god 10 year old cousin could've prepared tastier meal! can't even trust yelp reviews anymore cause people absolutely no idea good food is!! ? I ordered Food bombs bowl since sever said larger more flavorful burrito thought getting   bf ordered Stuffed French toast   Btw actually wanted order biscuits gravy waffles but apparently sold   Um seriously??? He disappointed before he even tasted because presentation  He thought kids meal  And yes VERY small price! fruit also fresh  He thought French toast mediocre  no stuffed menu says  just jam spread between two pieces bread   No offense but ihop Denny's WAY better looking French toast  AND NO EAT IHOP DENNY'S just giving accurate comparison! As mine bite knew couldn't finish rest  starters tortillas looked felt tasted stale  warm whatsoever!  comes black bean chili scrambled tofu spiced potatoes vegan cheese avocado chipotle cream  Sounds pretty effin' amazing right?!   WRONG!  Sadly only warm part meal potatoes very bottom  meal actually consisted 99% potatoes beans  totally TASTELESS! just think if you're going pay $11 meal very LEAST should fresh hot  ?  I REALLY wanted place! love ambience decor  love seeing vegan restaurants especially successful ones! However paying customer passionate foodie just don't appreciate getting ripped off  Luckily TONS traffic love hype no matter food tastes like  But if actually appreciate fresh hot filling savory meals getting PAY for   would skip one  <EOR> Great service! Amazing food!   Now your attention want start saying cousin immediately greeted friendly hostess did hesitate take table    Then moments met waitress I forgot name she wonderful gave details specials without even asking  She made feel very comfortable gave great suggestions even educated ingredients food   No judging      started buffalo cauliflower wings tamale tasty fresh  Next cousin pineapple picante pizza which good but could even better if crust weren't burnt  meatball grinder bread little hard around edges but let tell sauce cheeses meatballs perfect!!

Nice! table 3 started order Buffalo cauliflower wings superb   generally biggest fan cauliflower only eat them if they're prepared certain ways but dish certainly cut above any cauliflower dish ever before   cauliflower cooked 'til semi soft then charred some nice caramelized edges then tossed perfectly spicy buffalo wing sauce   dish served some celery sticks house made ranch dipping sauce   The three entrees ordered Masaman curry Sweet potato ravioli Russian standard which gluten free penne pasta vodka sauce   didn't taste other two dishes but Thai curry delicious   menu said comes sweet potato noodles but think mine rice noodles instead   some al dente vegetables thai yellow curry sauce   dish really flavorful portion perfect   My friends said dishes great well both numerous times know good place is     The place bit small side seating 50 maybe cool trendy vibe   definitely music playing which ranged Cure Ramones Jim Carrol Band Social D   Very cool   area downtown some really good restaurants opening place great part resurgence  <EOR> Adorable vegan all plant based restaurant downtown Las Vegas lots easy street parking  come every visit Vegas because consistently good variety dishes  time sushi roll veggie steamed dumplings devoured 30 seconds  Pamela Anderson raw tacos refreshing healthy  Love addition nuts texture  mini sliders also good however multigrain bun little dry which didn't mind all  made lasting impression 5 stars brownie sundae  amazing  They've brought new vendor supplies amazing almond milk based ice cream vanilla chocolate texture taste real ice cream  All flavor non guilt  Topped chocolate caramel drizzle nuts caramalized banana favorites all vegan dessert date  coming back just dessert  <EOR> If you're Vegan staying downtown there's only few choices eat at  there's ton choices strip either  Just happens both your main downtown options within block each other downtown   If love Veggie Grill type junk food then you'll thoroughly enjoy VegeNation offer  came breakfast lunch dinner three separate days during visit Vegas  could say bit fan  While everything menu isn't slam dunk most everything delicious sounds   We overwhelmed menu choices during first visit  ended going few most popular dishes   VegeNation Burger patty bit soft which normally would instant mood killer  However super foods burger kinda works  much flavor didn't even think soft burger until several bites deep  then didn't matter  good!

Ha   Coming LA little picky when comes vegan restaurants  Vegan restaurants outside LA tend lack flavor department replace everything soy   say no GMOs! When first came remember menu being very soy heavy  seems though changed menus better since then  now plenty soy free items array flavors    The good    Bao Wow could bias due distaste soy heavy items  ordered accident because waitress recommended didn't check menu inside  ended taking tofu just eating bun haha   Blueberry Cheesecake basically just tasted coconut oil nuts  Maybe would've better if colder? Maybe not    The okay    Hot Tamale If you're craving tamale I'd recommend this however won't ordering again  Nothing made stand flavor wise me   Vegenation Burger potato wedges come burger spiced very well sweet ketchup compliments them well  burger patty itself pretty bland  wasn't bad just tasted lot black beans mashed together   could use more seasoning  exaggerating when say burger fell apart 3 bites mouth isn't big   buns already soggy when came well  don't soggy bread without them  Does anyone soggy bread? Chocolate Tacos already know people going disagree but honestly just okay  just chocolate tacos Tacos Beer other night raised bar! know Tacos Beer vegan but wouldn't difficult replace ice cream vegan ice cream   just opinion    The yummy tummy recommendations    Picante Pineapple Pizza meat loving boyfriend orders every time absolutely loves this  tastes just regular pizza  would strongly recommend those new vegan scene anyone  just craving some pizza   Black Bean Chili Stuffed Sweet Potato yummy full flavor!

I'd personally love if could offer more beverage options Perhaps cola? grocery store purchase several well made delicious natural cola beverages would fit into VegeNation's model natural organic vegan food   If issue sugar fortunately enough know least cola sweetened agave  server forgot girlfriend's drink order same night tiny glass incident    Mistakes happen she made right but many little things place wonder if staff trained experienced food service  just leaves odd feeling discomfort when you're coming nice meal service    The service largely good  some others mentioned just odd insecurity over whether busboy wants take empty plate  Training issue experience both? Change think there's very good thing going VegeNation   served several different employees Erin seems strongest  She made right mistake she made night but she seems know she's doing more some others    The food VegeNation hit miss   girlfriend wants badly LOVE place   But seems every time there's just nagging little thing prevents being great experience   Overall food very nice  put together well presented nicely but terribly inconsistent  sushi excellent once   loved it  pizza good crust really good some reason  bow wow appetiser twice tonight just seemed sauce non existent tofu marinated   girlfriend let down based same food being excellent last time there  meatball grinder three times very consistently delicious vegan! Tonight however home see given mostly raw potatoes fries       Overall place  non vegan surprisingly impressed food VegeNation  just feel some big bugs still work inconsistencies smooth out  Every time hope experience flawless but sadly always something leaves bad taste mouth oppose delicious food  <EOR> Such friendly staff clean restaurant!
