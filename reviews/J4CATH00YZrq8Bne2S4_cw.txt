Melt your mouth good very rich flavor little salty but bad all  quality meat great even cheaper cuts serve which still aren't cheap   sister petite filet 8oz cooked same equally good slightly different flavor you could tell came totally different farm advertised   shared Brussels Mac cheese which both outstanding themselves  Brussels good don't single complaint problem  Mac cheese great also just little rich but customary those types cheeses  Dessert ordered usual Just don't understand someone could save room sweets but sister mentioned waitress birthday actually 3 days prior brought complimentary banana cream pie fancy happy birthday written chocolate syrup  never banana cream pie since dessert guy but entertained dish seeing brought free  Boy amazed!

Celebrated husbands birthday friends everyone still raving it  Ambiance modern food fantastic service great but expect pay it  Highly recommend if you're looking fantastic restaurant Vegas! <EOR> Delicious lucious American Wagyu CUT top three steaks all time   friend splurged American Wagyu might say best spent $90 epicurean life porterhouse two $180     We actually missed Friday reservation because flight delays but offered re schedule Saturday   only table lounge vs dining room which actually preferred   Very cool bar modern but comfortable lounge normal tables dining     We started bottle prosecco wonderful friend sent birthday gougeres several types bread nicely salt spiced butter  split butter lettuce salad which good start   side butternut squash which came roasted celery root leek just delicious   With steak addition two more friends ordered bottle red  challenge find recession friendly bottle among three four digit prices   skimped wine $50 bottle Malbec did job     Back Wagyu  bring entire sizzling skillet carve NY strip filet few each   Comes house steak sauce Bernaise though absolutely necessary   savory juices and frankly fat spread through your mouth each bite pure heaven     My wonderful friend also sent birthday dessert which swore all no space left body until first bite banana creme goodness proceeded devour rest   Meal culinary bliss two hours despite struggles corseted friend   Amazing meal   Total tax tip minus champagne dessert $173    <EOR> Amazing service    food perfectly made recommend eating all friends family return trip return  <EOR> In no way bad but just impressive which pretty disappointing price point    Had 35 day dry aged ribeye  Ordered medium rare came much closer medium  Char good pretty but just didn't much flavor it  added bone marrow which would definitely skip  Rather being piece bone side bunch chunks marrow appeared cooked separately put top steak  Lacked flavor unsatisfying chewy texture  also yuzu butter side  definitely helped overcooked steak but sad needed    Cocktail really good service  <EOR> Let's start review advise fan dined many off different Wolfgang Puck restaurants   Visited CUT 9 1 2010    greeted seated promptly immediately given extensive wine list   We're into wines but enjoyed  specialty alcoholic non alcoholic cocktails  offered many types house breads    Ordered Bone Marrow Flan appetizer which very smooth tasty but felt mushroom marmalade salty   order Nebraska 35 days Ribeye which some reason also appeared bit salty taste    many better steaks past less costs   wife Pan Roasted Maine Lobster which good    must say service excellent    many different staff tending table     reason can't provide higher rating high cost versus overall food taste  <EOR> Summary Food excellent Service beyond excellent  So wife flew last minute weekend no plans reservations anywhere Saturday night   staying Palazzo decided Cut   made call down restaurant able fit in  last available slot so receptionist says    When she wasn't kidding   last open table   Chris waiter he did outstanding job   Great people skills very attentive needs   sure other waiters just good but ask put Chris' area when check hostess   Warning place if you're squeamish bill be   You're  Vegas   Expect dish money   worth it  <EOR> I really liked CUT  understand going expensive but thought really good  service ridiculously good  Water glass filled constantly waiter coming check numerous times bread waiter came three times offer goods  bone rib eye cooked perfectly  bernaise sauce side great  Mac Cheese fantastic  nothing but positive things say would back again  <EOR> We Apple salad Lobster Shrimp salad starter   Apple salad different refreshing but bit sour vinegar based dressing   ribeye good but great   them soaked oliver oil oil covered whole plate   apple stuffed pumpkin donut dessert uneventful   petit fours best part meal   Poor selection wine glass   Service fine expected price   If place try it   don't think return given many other choices  <EOR> I've gone lot higher end steak houses Vegas least favorite  Service 5 stars sides dessert ordered really good however knock rating down two stars because star dinner wagyu filet wasn't good expected   little turned off when sever brought waxed examples different kinds beef explained differences between kobe wagyu marbling etc   felt trying upsell never seen before steak house only when place brings waxed trays displaying desserts   would've more okay if he asked if we'd dog pony show because already knew all differences already knew going order wagyu   When steak arrived completely crusted blend salt other seasonings now fantastic cut wagyu shouldn't covered salt seasonings meat should good need add very little it   When place salts much place did question quality meat   top wagyu filet being super salty brought three more little cups different salts   Holy saltiness couldn't even consider adding any more salt meat   wife's regular filet she ordered way less salty tasted better wagyu which made paying extra mine very sad tale   Most likely won't return because plenty competition Vegas indeed regret ordering wagyu  <EOR> Solid steak place although Japanese Wagyu ruined opinion because chefs over seasoned it  literally scrape off seasoning could enjoy chosen sauce  But cooking style quality meat all good service very good too  Sides all fine broccoli tasty  <EOR> CUT Wolfgang Puck   couple times always great experience   Customer service awesome!!    I always rib eye cooked rare side dishes mac cheese fav Mushrooms shishitto peppers ok  If share your plate more cooked other just request gladly you  <EOR> I Beverly Hills location once second time LV   Although food good did leave spectacular feeling time    We seated next vey loud table   realize Vegas but prices expect screen crowd     The pork belly tuna  starters delicious   Frankly starters better porterhouse two   fries disappointing time would them again   cream spinach delicious usual      Will back probably   However think may just stop cocktail nosh bar  <EOR> Came group 11 dinner  wasn't busy Tuesday night  Ambiance great wine selection great excited try food  The thing really annoyed server told order appetizer same time entree  We're hungry   what's big deal wanting try starters we're perusing over type steak sides wanted?  Besides service excellent  guys professionals attentive clearly passionate jobs   Ok now main spotlight! steak  ordered American Wagyu petite steak  Maybe little much hype? sure but all right  Personally didn't think anything stellar special it  read all reviews stating best steak ever think statement little overrated   Nevertheless say worth checking just least give try decide yourself  all just never know till give try  final note must try tuna tartar  Skip bone marrow flan  Pork belly salty side  If don't order anything else just trust me   and tuna tartar! <EOR> This best experience ever steakhouse  Stellar staffs!!!!!!!! Absolutely amazing service  Bone marrow favorite  Tasty greasy all  Love it  <EOR> Like most Mr  Puck's other restaurants place great   decided eat bar crostini kobi slider bone marrow flan   Absolutly great food   bar tenders extremely knowledgable food offeriengs gave some great recommendations   look forward coming back future having another great meal experience  <EOR> Came last February   No reservation just walked Saturday night   course no tables available but lucky love seat table bar area open   date seated there   ordered very simply    no wine no alcohol just appetizer pork belly side mushroom peppers bone in 39 ounce American Wagyu rib eye 2   Pork belly good mushroom peppers beyond excellent!

All best steakhouses past serve cocktails promptly patrons enjoy them while chatting looking through menu  While huge deal could already tell wasn't going great dining experience   My husband both ordered signature three steak tasting menu $130 each 10oz steak! ordered mine medium little char husband ordered rare regular char  When steaks came looked mixed steaks  Mine heavily charred outside while husband's very little char  asked server if steaks mixed brought manager  Things little chaotic he talked server two other people brought steaks  Finally manager talks tells he's pretty sure steaks correct reason more char steak because kitchen cook steak longer since asked medium  didn't any sense because charring happens afterwards broiler shouldn't affect steak cooked inside as explained server beginning evening   finally cut into steaks while all staff watches became very clear steaks switched  apologized switched plates but found very annoying patronizing manager tried explain mix making excuse why steaks cooked improperly first place  Again huge deal but top notch steakhouse really expect only two things 1 cook steaks properly 2 don't mix orders  But now all confusion left two cut steaks originally served wrong people   Finally biggest disaster father in law's order  He ordered bone in ribeye medium rare  When he cut into very clearly medium  He isn't complain but told if wasn't cooked perfectly he should return it  He eventually shows server agrees overcooked  take back steak father in law wait another 15 min while rest eating  When steak comes back very clearly rare  father in law even remarks middle still cold! He showed server again server admits obviously undercooked  He asks if he should take back throw back grill but point father in law hungry rest already finished eating three bites steak he just resigns himself eating cold raw steak  does world class steakhouse mess steak *twice* row?  This definitely low point Vegas trip afterwards couldn't stop thinking days much regretted going CUT especially when many other great restaurants Vegas  $600 meal expect impeccable service perfectly cooked food  Instead wait 30 min cocktails listen manager excuses instead admitting mistake watch father in law eat two wrongly cooked steaks while rest already finished meals  Overall terrible experience won't ever going back  <EOR> The snake river farms kobe style ribeye $85 good! But apps mediocre asparagus w poached egg beef sashimi    Sides good but small mushrooms n shiseido peppers mac n cheese pot purée All all think little pricey get    many other steakhouses town doubt come back one  <EOR> Extremely extremely over rated   Given price points quality meat expected based off reading reviews am very disappointed  found steaks lacking true flavor aside just salt  charge sauces which ridiculous   split rack lamb someone bone new york  new york tough all throughout cut full veins  tough time chewing through it  Maybe just bad cut but  good piece meat  rack lamb asked medium rare but came closer rare also bit chewy  Others party ordered ribeye seemed enjoy it  ordered variety side dishes none which thought anything special    Maybe just bad CUT but CUT didn't CUT me  <EOR> One best steakhouses ever to! service amazing    every staff member very friendly welcoming attentive  food world! husband both agree filets cooked perfectly liking melt your mouth good!
