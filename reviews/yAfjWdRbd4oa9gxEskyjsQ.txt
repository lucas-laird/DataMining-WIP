If love Mediterranean food eat Falafel crisp outside soft inside such great bold flavor  also tried Mango Curry dressing rice bowl best dressing ever Also owner manager inviting helpful nice guy  your way try place  you won't regret it <EOR> Lately craving good Mediterranean food luckily Zikiz opened near us  food very good  Now being vegetarian sometimes hard find GOOD veggie options  Now based off boyfriend told menu he ordered food us plenty vegetarian options  definitely returning myself trying more food  Other then delicious! <EOR> We stopped first time afternoon duly impressed   employees extremely attentive place SPOTLESS   ordered two traditional gyros wild salmon wrap   only meals delicious but portions generous took half home!

Plus seems family owned ran sort affair which love supporting! <EOR> The food amazing price good but service lackluster employees pretty vacant  Feel pretty ignored most people store  Bad communication ask parts order checking because weren't made    And manager owner   just kinda stares stands over shoulder workers  guy pretty uncomfortable  <EOR> The older balding guy goatee dickwad  Literally wanted leave because him  Wish name could mention him  Usually return somewhere if food mediocre  but service good but thanks guy think pass  Maybe if he nicer business wouldn't dead empty  mention hummus butthole  Try less tahini next time  <EOR> Good food large portions!  The owners often employees clean friendly    Coming Food Beverage Industry myself couldn't help but watch intently while associate prepared plates accepted payment  Every glove switch eased mind    After enjoying lunch next door Bakery Coffee shop associated Zikiz  pastries tempting but decided save another time grab coffee instead  back! <EOR> The only reason giving 4 instead 5 employees still learning since new service little slow still   3 times already   tried gyro chicken falafel wraps gyro falafel plates fried pickles sweet potato fries   All very tasty  enjoyed falafel   very flavorful  tzaziki sauce Ziki Dressing both yummy   wasn't fan tabouleh very heavy parsley prefer couscous wheat bulgar  <EOR> Had chicken kabob plate good  homemade hummus best far lots choices veggies sides  tell still ironing some keeps operationally but good customer service most part  <EOR> Omg!!! good must say doubts because many bad experiences before Greek American places but staff friendly food awesome  Order falafel spinach herb wrap oh no wrap  burrito good husband beef gyro loved order side hummus pita bread couse tried just delish side  <EOR> At time writing review Zikiz relatively new fast casual Greek Mediterranean restaurant opened Southwest part town  Think Chipotle but Gyros Salads    They follow Chipotle formula tee pick your dish wrap salad bowl your protein falafel chicken gyro salmon then add toppings dressing  Aside Zikiz also offers regular gyros gyro plates    Getting good stuff food really good! gyro meat tasty there's something tzaziki sauce find particularly addicting  also variety French fries range normal garlic herb    I excited try garlic herb fries but because place still relatively new trying everything squared away lack efficiency execution which resulted longer expected wait time order being partially incorrect I received regular fries instead garlic herb realizing until home     Overall food great nice Greek Mediterranean restaurant side town  think once they've open bit longer they'll workflow ironed much more smoothly creating better customer experience  But aside definitely worth visit! <EOR> I just first time can't wait back again food fresh love custom  staff friendly welcoming where most people rush during lunch hour  <EOR> Awesome modern Mediterranean place they're all quality fresh ingredients savory gyros wraps platters  Must try yourself  <EOR> First time ordered Bowl Gyro zikiz rice hummus spinach onions two times tomatoes asked zikiz dressing side  Let just say yelpers weren't kidding those said TASTY! bowl absolutely delicious! definitely back more!!! <EOR> Just happen stumble across place since starting staying side town place never really busy but don't let fool ya! boyfriend 4 times two weeks just good fresh  always bowl lamb humans other toppings he gets wrap form   price always exactly $20  bad considering eat bowl two meals  started reward program just give them your phone number points deals once week!

Think Chipotle Mediterranean spin   but all around better more options choose from! pick your meal bowl wrap salad plate your base your meat all toppings dressings sauces want  cook meat fresh right when order    I salad chicken hummus all toppings husband chicken wrap  also side hummus fantastic! <EOR> This place pretty delicious far  can't wait come back  torn between 4 5  would give solid 4 5  only complaint fries salted couldn't finish them    I wrap Spanish tortilla gyro meat rice humus spinach olive tomato tabouli however  spelled feta some delicious sauce  fat Mediterranean burrito!   For side garlic fries  just French fries garlic salt seasoning  mentioned before tasty but overly salted  half amount would still more McDonald's puts fries  Easy fix though just ask light seasoning   I didn't try falafel but definitely next time in! <EOR> Must try! Exactly Mts Edge needed! Yummy salads delish dressing zikiz fantastic fresh meat  pricing perfect portion sizes  <EOR> I gyros  ask meat tzatziki sauce first which traditional  usually put meat last falls out   I find prices little high  $8 gyro no sides drink   The tables usually cleared but wiped off experience 2 visits    There's really thin woman works saw wipe down all tables point  She also called name andasked if liked food later cleared tray  impressed wish gotten name    The manager or owner? doesn't natural customer service flair but he gets job down polite   I recommend place even minor concerns  <EOR> The menu very simple small but food great  Fresh ingredients lots veggie options  Falafel Wrap best ever had  Zikiz Dressing delicious! Also fried pickles amazing! definitely recommend restaurant quick healthy bite  <EOR> Great place   feel subway reinvented  Subway set but lot better food  Amazing selection!
