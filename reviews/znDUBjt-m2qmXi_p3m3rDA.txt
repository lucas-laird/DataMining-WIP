Horrible!!! OK perception Las Vegas buffets being outdated overall nothing but mediocre  being said place doesn't even live reputation   My girlfriend just looking something cheap easy while errands  saw Lee's knew just opened thought 'why not'? weren't expecting much but something half way decent reasonable price  didn't either  Everything luke warm pretty tasteless  Most cooked death  kept looking something decent never found it  didn't even dare try desserts  To top off server asked if liked food when told horrible he agreed  But didn't stop dropping $30 check  ripoff  I know there's another Chinese buffet only block away cheaper way better  My prediction place won't last long  Thank goodness! <EOR> Sunday dinner buffet  $12 99 per person   enter hostess very busy cell phone texting   almost disturbed coming in    very nice looking clean buffet   but       Nowhere near 150 items say have   The food looked good but labeled didn't know having   And didn't matter because all tasted same     5 PM maybe 15 18 others there   The spare ribs crab legs short ribs empty when came remained empty until almost ready leave   seafood soup no seafood hot room temperature   Same shark fin soup no fin it   fruit small dessert bar didn't look fresh either  Most trays 1 2 full best refilled   Actually only items liked mussels clams   In hour asked if needed drinks refilled but did clean table off timely manner   From table watched employees eating kitchen well   Sorry Lees  but coming back   way many buffets Vegas waste money here  <EOR>  HEATH DEPARTMENT NOTIFIED TODAY!! buffet just reopened  CLOSED heath deaprtment 4 times past year  Last night saw yet ANOTHER reason walk out  live action mongolian BBQ cooking station  choose your own raw meats vegetables hand cook cook front you  filled plate wet raw chicken he cooked put meal BACK PLATE where raw chicken just been!

Flag   Bored Chinese boy sitting table folding forks into napkins picking ear?  Flag   Hostess front door surprised see during should weekend lunch rush?  FLAG!  FLAG!  FLAG!  All could think WTH let's give shot   almost $9 each lunch should gone somewhere else   shiny new buffet mostly tarnished food   Lee's Buffet all typical offerings your local Chinese buffet all there   Beef Broccoli Sweet Sour Pork Fried Rice Tilapia 'Pizza' Orange Chicken some other Americanized versions 'Chinese' food is   All horribly mediocre   seriously would welcomed 3 Item combo Panda Express instead   standard Buffet @ Asia does all stuff much better believe  saying lot cheaper price!  Salad bar?  MEH   Soup bar?  Even though come those cute little round pots?  MEH   Dessert bar?  Dry MEH   Don't even started hand rolled sushi offerings   guessed it!
