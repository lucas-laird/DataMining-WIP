DETROIT STYLE?  All time thought gold standard pizza youth just skewed memory childhood  But if raised bar nothing being young naive everything being young naive    *Michigan*? Epiphany! Okay but 25 years since last saw Wolverine State back then suburban life Sterling Heights Romeo further away Detroit number miles map  Detroit style might nothing cushiony yet solid crusts those tender years spent swings Dodge Park swimming Stevenson High School pool   Still cautiously optimistic headed Northside Nathan's   Right away impressed decor  NN's isn't fine dining establishment but someone still put lot thought into celebrating spirit Motor City  no cheerleader country's big mitten said somehow haven't gotten around going back 25 years but looking around dining area still made smile  Note When looking menu online noticing Gangster's Choice pizza once and still suburbanite afraid might more Gangsta's Choice  mean    Detroit    know? If spent 1970s lower peninsula your mind might stray ghetto thoughts too  Thankfully just woefully stupid musical theatre  pizza names all homage Guys Dolls  Oh  Which once saw starring Lulu Oh smack head  Nice shopping center Flamingo Fort Apache easy parking casual yet attractive enough eat in interior young woman took order friendly could be  ordered large Adelaide's Special Supreme aka the works Mike large Sister Sarah's Very Veggie me  other words ordered way much pizza even week lunches mind but suppose  freezers for   The wait 20 pleasant minutes  family eating next table sharing looked good salad but then think all salads served metal bowl look good  The leaves staying cool dressing lightly coating never dripping    We also peeped other family's pizza  Mmmm  *Cross fingers*  My husband staggered little weight boxes when pizzas came up  Talk heft! reassuring staff didn't need dried red peppers Parmesan packets or plates napkins but nice them offer drove ten minutes back home  Hey what's plastic bag top pizzas?
