Excellent!! spicy eggplant amazing  spring rolls much flavor  Even green tea tasty  little busy server took little longer bring check but no complaints food!! definitely visit again next trip Vegas  <EOR> I referred Veggie House vegan friend boasts Veggie House favorite restaurants Las Vegas   can't say all choices food back Veggie House anytime soon     Although staff nice food bland lacked any amount spice   lunch soup tasted water even vegetables soup lacked any sort flavor    and add icing cake review GMO soy products flashing through memory   Soy largest GMO crops outside corn couldn't past every bite   Our food wasn't horrible edible   I left full   it clean   and everyone nice  <EOR> Where start?  If say healthy wouldn't call all deep fried tofu products healthy  dishes average taste portion presentation yet way over priced   even pricier then vegan places San Francisco Bay Area  <EOR> Delicious!  Loved Veggie Lemon Chicken!!! Good service good food  Quaint little place! <EOR> This place amazing  favorite chinese food restaurant Vegas  can't even leave positive enough review  just try it  Delicious! <EOR> We came group 12 traditional team dinner year's Punk Rock Bowling tournament  always tried different places each year but think may found go to place! staff owner welcoming friendly food beyond delicious portions huge  wasn't item out twenty ordered!!! sub par  Highlights would fried eggplant sesame chicken hot sour soup stir fried potato sticks  only wish lived Vegas could come back sooner  <EOR> This such great vegetarian restaurant  staff very nice taking time describe ingredients each dish asked them about   prices pretty good too   prefer gluten soy faux meats said everything tasted great!  I highly recommend crispy spicy eggplant though its really spicy all crispy SALT PEPPER mushrooms NOT thai crispy mushrooms!    Aside those 2 dishes everything very good too  <EOR> We tried place because groupon deal totally amazed entirely vegan  All dishes tried great! Spicy Kung chicken pan fried noodles fried won tons app  service during lunch little slow amount guests wait staff but still very friendly  going again    definitely lunch specials until 3 pm  dinner portions huge  shared two entrees between two still lots left overs  <EOR> Wir hatten grosse Erwartungen das Veggie House die dann leider nicht ganz erfüllt wurden  Das Essen war gut wir hatten BBQ Beef Wonton Suppe und fritierte Wonton als Vorspeise und dann Pinapple Duck und Chicken Sweet Sour als Hauptspeise aber der Geschmack der nachgeahmten Fleischprodukte vermochte nicht zu überzeugen  Ein echtes vegetarisches Gericht mit Tofu oder Bean Crud was das 'Veggie House' im Übrigen auch anbietet wären wohl die bessere Wahl gewesen  Das Personal war aufmerksam und freundlich das Essen war schnell auf dem Tisch und mit frischen Zutaten zubereitet  Wer ohnehin unterwegs ist und Lust auf Vegetarisches hat dem kann man das 'Veggie House' sicher empfehlen aber sich vom Strip ein Taxi nehmen um dort zu essen lohnt sich dann doch nicht  <EOR> For vegetarian Chinese food place nails it! little skeptical first but honestly everything ordered amazing Generals chicken kung pao chicken chow fun all surprisingly point! going back soon! <EOR> Searched vegan restaurants Las Vegas found Veggie House  excellent reminded Chinese food ate before awakening vegan life  Thank Veggie House preparing excellent food filled compassion! returning soon  <EOR> I love love love spinach salad!!! much vibrant flavor!

In addition no meat diary family also avoids oil  told waitress meal made w little oil possible  dish came back un edible  reason didn't give star rating because chef immediately scooped dish off table them another dish  second dish good except why all sauce? more soup dish noodle dish  recommendation would ask ALL sauces side  completely saturate dishes sauce its eating soup  bad     back nor would recommend unless ok fried oily sauce saturated meals    It also turn off see chef pull chair sit customers bragging himself  If regular know chef then definitely treated more special  If  town prepare stink eye treated annoyance  <EOR> I've quite few times every single time disappointed me  If you're starter trying all vegan vegetarian diet should probably food isn't bland tasteless most vegetarian vegan place  actual Chinese dishes but every single ingredient plate all vegetarian ESP meat  house crispy pan fried noodle very delicious maybe little oily but tastes almost exact non veggies  Tom yum soup pretty good alongside Buddha delight yum! Oh appetizer always order turmeric salad  first taste little strange but now used pretty addicting!! food always feel more energetic leave service always fast waiters waitresses very friendly  place totally worth try! If you're vegan vegetarian looking good place eat since there's many good vegetarian places around would DEFINITELY recommend veggie house try if haven't! Even if you're vegetarian want try some vegetarian food still try it! pretty bomb  won't regret it  <EOR> At point almost redundant give yet another 5 Star Review Veggie House but give credit where credit due  amazing restaurant truly kind  cannot enough Spicy Crispy Beef Orange Chicken  Chef Kenny miracle worker wait staff consistently cheerful professional  <EOR> My brother he's vegan and Las Vegas looking place where he could eat  found Veggie House line there  waitrees Ying best food better  service outstanding   definitely again next time town  <EOR> Delicious!

One friends actually issue texture pork dish     and know what?  tried honestly     the texture fake pork texture real pork same dish other chinese restaurants before   texture tended little chewy side Veggie House true form     they made fake pork supposed be!  crazy     crazy delicious!!  = On second trip     i crispy beef again     and did disappoint     it good!!  Loved it!

BUT curry little sweet side me   progressed ate more curry     the flavors did deepen able taste more nuances dish     but sweetness lasted througout kind made weird me   only dish 5 star dish     Ambiance      4 5 little weird inside reminds huts straw roofs     but most part ignore just focus great food   = Service     very prompt very cordial 5 5    Now if all vegan places tasted good Veggie House     I could vegan but until time enjoy vegan meals here     and enjoy real stuff elsewhere   = definitely back! <EOR> Welcome relief vegetarians traveling Chinatown area Las Vegas  pretty much only restaurant over half more its menu vegetarian options  tried Buddha delight land crispy fried eggplant  Both excellent  wood delight interesting noodle sauce mixed it  crispy fried eggplant whilst very tasteful high calorie but nothing restaurant  wait staff very accommodating modest modifications  <EOR> Happily surprised Groupon find! Chinatown many bad spots  Regardless place otherwise would known let alone gone come favorite green website   After extensively perusing reviews menu online finally order takeout wonton ramen soup spicy crispy eggplant brown rice green tea ice cream sticky rice   The spicy crispy eggplant world  amazing I'd come back just dish side brown rice wasn't even necessary  Delicious way eggplant despite being sticky almost sweet sauce did feel heavy meal    The won ton soup bit underwhelming  did appreciate noodles packed separately takeout order fall apart broth liked won tons themselves  But broth lacking  liked green taste oddly reminded green smoothie except broth form  could taste veggie vibrancy  But still somehow flat  Noodles also much thinner prefer seemed simply thin spaghetti rather ramen   The dessert underwhelming well  green tea ice cream melted very quickly also lacking flavor experienced varieties more chalky texture but stronger machta taste but version thin side rather creamy  Also struck odd sticy rice orange  <EOR> A few things should know restaurant   close between 3 30 4 30 employee breaks   I came earlier day told kitchen down would wait half hour   party 3 walking around mall area where located   However those little things   Lets face it   Its food service  The service really nice   am vegetarian its new staff knows those great introductory items which recommended   Fried Eggplant them chicken curry   The portions big took lot go   sure entree feed 2 3 people  <EOR> I tried dinner time just wasn't great  think venue much suited lunch  <EOR> I say wow! restaurant amazing!  Vegan Chinese food  doesn't taste vegan  Everything delicious waitress wonderful extremely attentive service perfect prices very reasonable  highly recommend going Veggie House  <EOR> As much place often find liking reduced handful dishes off lunch menu   First off food very light bit bland side  more often find myself wondering if could away asking some table salt some soy sauce but that'll defeat purpose eating wholesome healthy vegetarian food   Another reason Veggie house food doesnt exactly bloat unlike   well pretty much everything else  good feeling full without actually physically feeling you're gut going explode    Recommendations? Ice cream always good choice supplied Perfect Scoop expect yummy high quality hand made ice cream 100% time all time   The crispy spicy beef greatest items menu  judging based taste if taste game then rating would 5 stars 4  due texture faux beef  Other items such kung pow beef beef broccoli texture close tofu mushroom carries similar taste if wasn't sauces   So overall place definitely worth stop lunch but dont expect 100% accurate vegetarian replacement meat   As vegetarian alternatives fish   we'll see updated review     Yelp 100 034 100 <EOR> If could give place 10 stars would  good  Crispy Eggplant Rodi favorite  Only Vegas two days but might come back tomorrow  <EOR> So vegan restaurant tries its dishes taste animal replacing  More later   The owner charming gracious woman  dish oyster mushroom lemongrass sauce tasty  friend confirmed meat man liked soup spring rolls very much  fried oyster mushroom juicy interior all fried foods should but don't  big plus  guess most people would find Veggie House surprisingly good  However   the sodium fat added order accomplish transformation vegey  into meat taste anyway overpowering  Again think most find Veggie House surprisingly delicious vegetarian cuisine  <EOR> Yum!!!! last night finding groupon seeing all great reviews yelp  good!! ordered crispy spicy eggplant orange chicken hot sour soup  Everything amazing crispy spicy eggplant must have!

Cantonese fried fish nearly same taste favorite steamed rock cod flounder which always order whenever possible    Orange Chicken would know wasn't real chicken!

These just few examples experiences Veggie House  love bringing new people watching reactions  food does great job mimicking traditional non vegan dishes  believe  why place always busy    The cherry top owner Chef Kenny! If he's around he usually come chat each table bit  He extremely amicable always willing answer any questions guest might have  name any specific names but other restaurant owners around town complete opposite Chef Kenny hide guests fear confrontation  Chef Kenny genius deserves all success many restaurants bring him!  I would highly recommend Veggie House anyone everyone   vegan vegetarian omnivore   EVERYONE needs experience place! favorite dishes crispy spicy eggplant walnut shrimp flat noodles  Yum!!! <EOR> Helpful Tip Closed Daily 330 430PM  Of course arrived nearly 4pm afternoon starving  wasn't aware lunch closure plan accordingly   After short debate decided order Cajun Shrimp  Surprisingly delicious texture identical opinion  spice level perfect    Chef Kenny's special hot sauce spicy but tolerable  tore up!   If take guess sure place isn't healthy cuisine but all experience while exploring different food options  certain back some orange chicken minus cluck cluck course!!  $28 w two appetizers <EOR> Da ich solche Vegi Restaurants schon aus anderen amerikanischen Städten kenne hatte ich grosse erwartungen  Das Essen war aber leider nur mässig gut alles das gleiche Aroma und nicht authentisch    ich hätte mir die lange Suche nach dem Restaurant soaren können  <EOR> Great food great staff! Can't say anything bad place  Waitress even recommended use Groupon $20 discount  <EOR> Arrived Las Vegas hungry tired 1pm   Immediately drove Veggie House having looked YELP   treat!  Wonderful food wonderful service  Spinach Salad Spicy Beef Oyster Mushrooms   beef taste real?  mushrooms crispy covered chile sauce   salad simply huge! Just wish we'd eaten twice   Viva Vegan!!! <EOR> Gave restaurant 3 stars mostly because service    We ordered Spring Rolls average Crispy Egglplant AMAZING Kung Pao Chicken good average Chow Mein Vegetables good but very oily Fried Non Vegan Cherry Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Would recommend but ask flavor availability I came family four while establishment somewhat busy lunch  biggest issue only 2 waitresses both taking orders serving food which made service very slow  waitress took 10 minutes come around table forgot ask drinks wanted until mentioned it  addition took while waitress' attention when need ed napkins extra utensils  Lastly ordered Fried Ice Cream Mango Ice Cream however waitress failed mention only flavor ice cream  When told mistake she just curtly explained only flavor stock  just frustrating experience   Overall food good but service lacking  would come back eat Crispy Eggplant because GOOD  <EOR> Service excellent food great!
