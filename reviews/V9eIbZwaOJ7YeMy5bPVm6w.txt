As others said very reasonable choice light snack cheap meal without feeling gouged    Great place able save enough $$$ able save nice meal fine restaurants inside MGM     Other choices food court would almost costing much just walking over Monte Carlo getting brunch buffet there   The prices just slightly higher normal McDonalds would find outside strip      20 piece Chicken McNuggets only $6 normally $4 99 other McDonalds    The dollar menu pared down but still chicken sandwich $1     The best deal stated P T  2 apple pies $1  exact same price would pay any normal McDonalds great light snack should become very hungry your dinner reservation still hours away any restaurants there  <EOR> I haven't eaten McDonald's zillion years but morning upon exiting Hakkasan 4 40am McDonald's looked mirage barren desert  serving breakfast ordered egg mcmuffin no sausage hash browns  OMG! Yumm    The service fast friendly  felt sorry guy register person person including myself came ordered lunch item he explain breakfast only time  Well he did very patiently  Kudos being work hour having awesome attitude! Note only people line time morning partying all night club myself time bit delirious all appreciated patience us   DOS 8 29 214 <EOR> At 2 00 AM countless drinks wise eat before crashing  quick service reliable food limited discussion counts   The place huge line all hours hyper trendy new food court  Great vibe abundant people watching good lighting  CLEAN!  Enjoyed loaded crispy yard bird sandwich medium pomme frittes diet pop  Delicious!  Bonus making frisky friend! <EOR> If MGM food court most reasonably priced option  still usual dollar menu items which far away cheaper any other restaurant food court  mean live Nathan's hotdogs but $10 bucks dog ridiculous!!   I remember when Vegas used known inexpensive buffets way draw gamblers establishments  But those days long gone consumers ones suffer  Kudos McDonalds maintain everyday pricing gouging us!!   Food typical but always know your when eat Golden Arches  <EOR> I came 2 30am club no wasn't drunk  excited seeing breakfast items menu til 4   When order cashier lady RUDELY told didn't breakfast  pointed menu clearly read til 4 she RUDELY said generic menu participating location    This unacceptable  Getting many people's hopes order McDonalds breakfast middle night    It took long time receive small meal  When asked certain dipping sauces lady RUDELY answered every asked for  asked ketchup she told down front Nathan's ketchup  But right before saw give man ketchup packets  ketchup stand there's no cups   saw girl w cups she said lady McDonald's gave them her  completely outraged irritated w mcdonalds    I understand employees deal lot drunk people but  doesn't allow room rude customer service behaviors paying customers    They 2 stars bc food good  <EOR> The usual McDonald's food prices fast friendly service  morning coffee rather nearby Starbucks faster cheaper  $1 hot coffee around $2 iced coffee  leaves few more $ your pocket lose er use casino  <EOR> Typical McDonald's located food court MGM Grand     Prices reasonable no higher any free standing location open 24 hours   Cashiers reasonably friendly considering deal most times crazy control drunk people    offer employee discount MGM employees lot but better nothing   The only thing note breakfast available 24 hours like most McDonald's locations but starts 4am   It always seems food ready quicker anywhere else been   sure if good bad!  Basically if cheap dine other late night option Wolfgang Puck's good choice   Especially if just getting back club  <EOR> Much lower competition    Friendly customer service   We sweet chili chicken wrap $3 99 without meal 2 apple pies which sale $1   This best option food court   Everything else overpriced  <EOR>
