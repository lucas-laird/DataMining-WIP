NEVER business again  Beware place ask much everything before order it!! <EOR> Service appears better regulars occasonal patron  Typical Lodge bars  Bartender seems more into herself taking care everyone  She spends majority time locals corner when shes disapearing back smoking playing phone  sexy shirt no bra hot but worth lack service  Unless your regular then plenty time check goods  back bartender ask where she to  only stayed longer because happy hour prices which good  <EOR> One favorite places   machines decent food too   wouldn't way eat but if you're already bad bar food   bartenders fun    people Double D fun around    especially when hit!  last week 3 six spots hit within couple hours that's $1600 each!    seating just dining pool tables those inclined   whole thing decorated built lodge    thus name  <EOR> Horrible  7pm football Sunday literally no bar should first clue  Food marginal bartender Alecia flat rude  Asked question tab she started arguing us  Sorry won't ever back  Word street whole chain sold maybe staff left just doesn't care anymore  <EOR> We visited Monday around 11 30 a m  we're happy see quaint smoke free eating space   ordered  fried chicken sliders macaroni cheese it  Don't knock until try it   Wonderful   ordered Carne Fries    ordering nachos but very good thin fries instead chips   steak world very very tender  waitress Chelsey explained choices checked regularly pleasantly friendly   Lodge great place eat  <EOR> This place opens 24 7 which love it  just during tests final tests much possible between  Americano coffee pretty good price somewhat very reasonable  only reason am giving 4stars instead 5stars premises dark sunset which hard keep focusing studying but no choice since only coffeeshop where opens 24 7 besides decatur tropicana  Overall coffee foods decent  <EOR> I've bar twice  Great location okay food excellent service  Both times pleasure being served Jenna Alexis  Both times meeting clients  Both them very valuable employees establishment   Great smiles excellent service very attentive perfect employees!  The bar itself isn't much brag about  If wasn't service two young ladies I'd probably never back  4 old guys sitting machines  much excitement  The Nachos very good but may want ask them easy Jalapeños  The grilled cheese great but don't many soup options  French Fries  Can't really mess French Fries The only reason bar gets 4 Stars because Jenna Alexis  Both girls deserve promotion huge raise! <EOR> The happy hour food worth it  Buffalo sliders grilled chicken clearly frozen come fries  Also ordered version grilled cheese bacon burned black  Fries good  extensive menu  recommend  <EOR> Hubby happy hour 4p 7p   Overall SOLID! ate dining room the bar lounge area just way smoky   Seat yourself service very friendly quick attentive  sodas order hot tiaki wings garlic parm chicken tenders beef tacos cheese quesadilla   All appetizer menu total bill under $20!   The food good although hot tiaki wings tasted regular buffalo wings no terryiaki flavor   Everything came piping hot portions really big appetizers  box some things take home    The atmosphere your typical dark wood paneling dim lighting neighborhood lodge  close convenient house made nice pre movie dinner  We'll back! <EOR> I used live 89148 SW Summerlin border neighborhood  used pass establishment all time  finally balls try place even though live further now haha   Went couple friends decided hit place  Parking shady area or least friends thought so   next door some mexi food place work center women only    Walked inside OMG am mountains   in cabin?

Most places overcook steak when ordered way   Although he devoured sandwich he did note steak very bland tasted though no seasoning it   sandwich okay taste    assumed roast beef would fresh but greatly disappointed when looked sandwich noticed rainbow fish scale sheen outside meat the preservative used roast beef    some reason sight always made stomach turn ever since little only ate quarter sandwich finished fries which quite tasty      I'm sure if restaurant top picks future quick meal but service definitely par ambiance really feel you're holed lodge winter evening gambling basketball TV course   <EOR> These two stars basically ambiance fantastic food   Service average best pool free but only thing more broken pool sticks pool tables themselves   beer selection worst someone values good beer thank but if elite choice magic hat #9     Even being walking distance house choice gambling induced friends would never rarely do  <EOR> The bartender served tonight should fired years lived never such shitty customer service  Came family watch Warriors game sat corner part room told waitress sat bartender would over momentarily change channel  15+ minutes later during which bartender spent tons time gossiping thrown visible tantrum over uncle ordering beer happened run bartender told husband when he came politely remind request quiet  only person leave alone then told she couldn't game larger screen section sat we'd just deal     without even trying   She must stupid figure because she far being hot enough away kind attitude regular basis  planning drink eat dinner throughout game but quickly changed mind Hokaido down street   To bartender question am manager oversees large customer service team if anyone team treated any client way treated would fired spot  Your poor attitude work ethic cheated would large bill your location comparable tip  also advising company's event planning committee eliminate your location option hosting holiday party congrats losing all money To waitress appreciate your efforts trying loser happened stuck shift hope find better place work soon! <EOR> Fantastic service  Food great!
