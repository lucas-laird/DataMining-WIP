Came birthday celebration while Vegas let down   Got Saturday evening ready feast seated promptly waiting rest party arrive  hostess lead group table window seated given menus   The items menu seemed really good  knew wanted something sausage while rest group steaks spaghetti  first issue came when everyone decided wanted server took 20 minutes come back table take order  somewhat odd especially since when drink taken he overlooked order seriously!!!! ask another waiter helping another table grab drink  good   Next when waiter did eventually come over take orders he insisted orders rather giving recommendations hmmmm smooth! issue orders everyone's order taken except but member party could order because waiter walked away getting 5th order  Why would when another person table!!! Once again another waiter add another steak order because waiter unable first time!!  As food meal great  Everyone ordered steak loved food  However spaghetti informed bit sour! did try but told another member dinner party    Once finished food  wait another 20 minutes before could check  Getting check this  finally getting attention waiter two words asking check then he interrupted didn't let finish offer dessert  Seriously usually back forth communication but guy speak over confusing me!

I shared some calamari appetizer skipped salad save room main dish  ordered chicken rigatoni tomato based cream sauce  Omg delicious  tried eat all failed miserably  sauce really dish  probably won't room dessert but try chicken rigatoni leave happy! <EOR> Restaurant week lunch menu 2015 review   The Skinny maybe just don't but food okay great    Surprisingly dessert worst course cannot recommend  3 service good prompt 3 value okay Restaurant week special but would skip place regular prices    We came try restaurant week lunch menu which serves 3 course lunch $20 15    I Caesar salad grilled salmon over cucumber chickpea artichoke salad while hubs tomato basil soup spaghetti meatballs   Both came dessert course cannoli cookie selection    The tomato basil soup little bland needed more basil  texture good   I liked Caesar salad better albeit little heavy dressing needed more acidity  hubs thought little much anchovy dressing but kind that  polenta croutons great addition textural flavorful    Spaghetti meatballs really nothing special sauce bland really wasn't enough tomato flavour really dish stand out  meatballs under seasoned  spaghetti itself cooked bit beyond al dente which dish disappointing    My salmon dish fared better  grilled salmon done perfectly  However salad cucumber arugula chickpea artichokes bit underwhelming needed more acidity brightness bring flavors together    The worst course dessert  each came cannoli 3 cookies oatmeal chocolate chip sugar cookie  cinnamon cannoli okay albeit rich   there wasn't enough cinnamon really distinguish itself  cookies really bad did rich buttery taste them  sugar cookie especially tasted more shortening artificial flavors  think also skimp use cheap artificial vanilla extract   After finished lunch watching bakers Carlos bakery  Guess saw? half used package pre made manufactured Rice Krispies treats shiny blue foil packaging Kelloggs branded elves see pic   Seriously  bakery cannot rice krispie treats yourselves? Just FYI all need microwave marshmallows butter rice krispie cereal bowl spatula 10 minutes dessert   just bad form    At end day give dining experience 3 star okay but nothing would return for  Carlos bakery just cookies aforementioned shortcut saw enough stay far away  <EOR> So can't say love fact Buddy's feels very much its part mall  think due fact entranceway huge  open floor plan just restaurants main Dining area feel right middle mall  However despite minor flaw food authentic  waiter Naples true passion food he serving  apps delicious including Caesar salad calamari  meatballs top notch  dinner ordered mixed meats pasta  dish name but can't remember life called  lamb fatty though which why can't five stars  Plus dish missing component opinion  maybe some cheese vegetables  friends dishes all looked good  No seemed   blown away but definitely satisfied impressed cleanliness authentic Italian cuisine served  <EOR> Solid Italian dining option Venetian  staff all top notch food pretty good  sangria drink which good then really fresh delicious salad appetizer  entree chicken rigatoni alla vodka thought ok although better vodka pasta elsewhere  two friends rated entrees highly  Overall solid option probably won't dissapoint but did blow away  <EOR> Amazing place! terms prices its more affordable side Italian food Vegas but still runs $20 $30 plate worth every single penny! waiter most amazing person he very attentive personable charming made experience amazing experience was  style restaurant very charming cute well environment perfect night now while still being relaxing comfortable  proportions food well worth money ordered chicken parmesan which came two huge pieces chicken  three other people party ordered other chicken every single take home more half meal  Would highoy recommend anyone looking good meal best Vegas trip! <EOR> Excellent dining experience! reserved table through Open Table didn't wait all  nice booth near open kitchen  wait staff attentive nice  Both dishes chicken piccata chicken Marsala both amazing film flavor perfect portions  Definitely recommend  <EOR> Service A+  food ordered good but great though wouldn't mind returning trying some other dishes  <EOR> This place amazing! food delicious creme brulee die for!

I really don't traditional breakfast food Buddy V's Sunday brunch two egg dishes French toast dish buffet  Perfect!   The buffet divided into five stations starters charcuterie shrimp antipasto soup Caesar salad carving station props bacon spicy Italian sausage Kids corner Mac n cheese pizza candy entrees loved meatballs chicken Parmesan carbonara Mac n cheese DESSERTS! Delicious tiramisu mason jars cannoli zonuts favorite    The buffet $34 95  opted extra all you can drink mimosa deal $14 95 choose mimosa Bellini sangria beer wine  Bellini tasty but sangria tho! embarrassed say many glasses had    My fiancé Bloody Mary deal $18 95 which bring vodka craft your own Bloody Mary different station  He fun doing and adding shrimp appetizer station he also choose all drinks  He ended switching sangria well drank much did  He keep glass souvenir    We seated right away no wait even during March Madness weekend can't wait come back  Wish served every day! <EOR> Meh Buddy V's 3 5 stars but rounding down because slow service complicated bill _ I made reservation Buddy V's birthday  large party 15 seated pretty quickly once whole party arrived  know large party but just felt overall service very slooow     The older man maybe manager walked very l o w l y    to table seated just took long time utensils menus  around 4 45 when arrived restaurant didn't look crowded time   I am huuuge fan moscow mules point try restaurant's signature mule  Buddy V's Jalapeno Mule cocktail menu instantly intrigued pleasantly surprised upon tasting it  bright zesty but subtle kick jalapenos would kick afterwards  really overwhelming spice but rather quite refreshing  Highly recommend trying this!  And meal ordered linguini clams shared friend ordered sea scallops  Much disappointment linguini super salty extra garlicly  didn't mind garlic but salt just much found myself taking gulps water between bites  sea scallops other hand quite enjoyable  creamy bed polenta beneath beautifully seared scallops complemented well   The dessert probably highlight meal  Italian birthday cake delicious  big fan desserts because don't much sweet tooth but sweetness all different layers very overpowering this  loved chocolate mouse layer  dreamy      It time check here's where things unnecessarily complicated  Again service slow seemed waiting forever check come out  Prior even ordering asked if could split check into separate bills tables since large party  forgotten but no big deal asked them if could fix said would  wanted split bill put two separate cards  When brought back check took look confused  server literally split everything check half see photos which made 39247038x more difficult party figure needed pay back  clarified waiter wanted off he fix check  could possibly wrong? instead just ringing another two new bills he took looong time trying move halves two checks around  instead linguini clams bill said 1 2 linguini clams twice  He spent long time trying move things around but didn't move everything properly  think would've taken equally long just create two new bills where each meal half   So yeah frustrating deal with  Everyone getting grumpy because restaurant long because slow service ready leave two hours being there  But waiter did try   and he nice   just efficient  Overall good food nice interior! However expecting little more service since wasn't crowded but hey tried  <EOR> I came Wednesday night dinner mom dad brother  decor very nice just Italian restaurant  server very nice  appetizer started off fried calamari very crispy delicious  entree classic cheese pizza good  also margherita pizza but can't remember last time because going Vegas past 3 years  Can't wait return next vacation! <EOR> Buddy Vs actually right outside Palazzo parking garage  If park Venetian parking garage LONG way walk   Excellent service food just amazing  best Caesar Salad ever  however noise level off charts   is extremely loud restaurant 9pm wasn't even full but seated across someone yell heard   Overall great restaurant  <EOR> Great food!!

Italian food  ordered linguine clams sort wished would gone shrimp scampi did it  pasta good but sauce really brothy most sat bottom dish leaving less flavor pasta would liked  wait staff nice attentive prices reasonable given location  <EOR> So disappointed  hoping for  very first experience celebrity chef restaurant  high hopes  atmosphere nice homey touches nicely decorated cute touches whisks light figures  disappointment food  ordered chicken Marsala advice server   Unfortunately chicken properly trimmed large strip fat both pieces  addition chicken overcooked chewy  A patron next table chicken rigatoni felt chicken overcooked well   seemed chicken breasts cooked earlier day then reheated  Marsala sauce did sweet flavor usually taste Marsala tasted more simple brown sauce very little flavor  side pasta came Marsala well cooked well seasoned quite tasty  husband ordered lasagne specialty according server  lasagne fine although really any better other Italian restaurants tried  heavy veal heavily seasoned anise   If really anise definitely lasagne you  ordered famous lobster tail dessert   very small portion price $9 piece size very small pear did taste fresh  cream filling very good but pastry very chewy even hard cut through   plus side service very good focaccia before dinner also very good   just disappointed food better quality price  <EOR> We reservation few weeks ago seated right away   Service attentive at first  drinks straight entrée  server wasn't very present  chicken Marsala pretty good however pasta carbonara very rich  friend ordered felt overwhelmed two bites  Dessert wonderful we lobster tail decadent  Great flavor texture  pit night when waitress Kacey dropped bill told gratuity already added all pay total noted bottom     problem party 3  looked bill printed directly something along lines of No gratuity added your bill  your convenience some preset gratuity amounts just circle you'd apply  15% 18% 20% 22% Kacey circled 20% option wrote new total bottom because guess she thought she deserved  she dropped bill noticed she constantly circling table waiting provide method payment  party 3 even though young early 20s know tip  pretty insulting  work heart Vegas where many international visitors aren't aware customs  But doesn't mean assume everybody that  talking over amongst ourselves attention pointed receipt stated said if says then gratuity amount should really discretion  She tried cover all saying something Oh just suggested amount if big deal just take off  she ripped off bottom check     worked restaurant industry servers face heavy disciplinary action type behavior  still left tip but whole ordeal really just left bad taste mouths  <EOR> This second time visiting Buddy V's   first time came year ago several other couples adult trip   celebrated friend's birthday most amazing experience extremely attentive waiter   waiter completely took care flat rate per person unending amount food all which incredible   enjoyed much planning past year come back bring children could experience themselves   On Friday evening April 7 2017 opportunity bring children however experience fell short we'd long anticipating   town volleyball tournament first Vegas dinner Buddy V's   party 8 celebrating birthdays two girls group   Upon initially sitting down table placed purse back chair every restaurant   pulled chair sit down sat fell completely floor chair tipped over   purse heavy but rather chairs incredibly lightweight durable   waiter attempted help but made no offer ice notify management   He did ask if okay but due embarrassment humiliation falling down front other patrons quickly said yes even though elbow hurting   Leaving restaurant night right elbow hurt   Saturday morning noticed right elbow bruised addition another bruise back left arm   With regard meal daughters ordered off Dinner Prix Fixe menu where salad entree dessert $40   girls split meal   When bill came girls charged each item ordered according la carte menu pricing instead Dinner Prix Fixe menu added other party's ticket instead own   waiter also expressed displeasure having split bill table into two separate tickets which should shared us   We asked waiter toward end meal if could sing girls birthdays he notified don't sing   He offered instead bring each girls birthday cannoli   he failed mention however would additional charge   would minded he mentioned before bringing desserts but rather discovered additional charge when bill   Feeling dissatisfied overall experience decided Saturday evening write Yelp review but wanted all fairness first call restaurant speak General Manager let know experience   called approximately 6 30  not most ideal time call which acknowledged but felt needed addressed before anymore time passed   She told anytime customer falls restaurant she notified   She mentioned she Friday evening when fell no made mention fall her   She asked email address told next time Vegas just email she would take care everything   now Sunday 11 15 a m  received email phone call her   Incredibly disappointing especially all hype given Buddy V's anticipation

Also Caesar salad came sandwich warm soft croutons which added different but interesting taste it   Glad could check place off try list but experience really wasn't anything want come back again  <EOR> This place incredibly good buddy done amazing job making sure food real Italian food meat balls spaghetti must  Staff super bz but still good job  <EOR> Buddy V's Ristorante located within Venetian hotel  best friends parents treated lunch Saturday  wasn't crowded wasn't sure expect  seated promptly given reservation 10  looking menu few decided few different items eat family style   FOOD  Margherita Pizza sliced tomatoes basil fresh mozzarella  Simple light  medium sized crust crispy doughy  really enjoyed little grated parmesan crushed red pepper  4 5 5  Buddy's Favorite Pizza spiced sausage caramelized onions fennel four cheese  didn't care much  sausage blend cheese didn't well together  would definitely margherita pizza instead  2 5 5  Spaghetti Central Meatballs Your basic simple spaghetti five meatballs  simple but thoroughly enjoyed tomato sauce  thought excellent flavor  would definitely order again maybe try bolognese next time  4 5  Chicken Parm Provolone mozzarella spaghetti marinara  dish excellent sharing  would heavy if person just but great group  give two chicken breasts decent portion spaghetti side  chicken parm deliciously cheesy! 4 5  Overall extremely pleased service food Buddy V's Ristorante  definitely back more tomato sauce goodness  only thing possibly place any better if served some fresh break oil balsamic beginning  Just saying      ENJOY! <EOR> Came based reviews  Stayed fantastic service food  traveled far wide world rank high list great dining experiences   thanks Chris Tawny making feel right home   And kitchen incredible meal bone veal chop!
