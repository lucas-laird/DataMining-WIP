A keeper Korean BBQ place   think bit pricy above average but food very good    marinated Galbi but also seong? Galbi which marinated    Galbi available good Korean BBQ place taste real meat flavor    Well really wanted marinated time excellent choice     After 11pm deduct 20% average price really good dining think      The receptionist very attentive liked service   Table waitress ok    We paejyong? Pancake also   didn't took fancy but all small dishes especially Kimchi very good     I certainly would come back place tofu stew menu other choices     They semi private dining area group dining    use business dinner <EOR> Tofu soup good spicy all  employees pretty rude  Moreover tip amount checks wrong  check where signature required calculated tips based food price tax which mislead clients  other shows right amount based only food price  Beware business conduct  <EOR> Last year when eat family food absolutely delicious but year somehow same combination meat ordered caused whole family stomach aches  However waitress seemed unbelievably kind least rated place star  friends strongly recommended place brought enjoy food  end embarrassed ourselves because meat quality  <EOR> Worst place ever!! 30 minutes still haven't gotten appetizers yet  While tables next gets served meat tables cleaned when there's no line  see appetizers counter but no ones picking up  don't understand worst service  don't even want food anymore because put such bad mood  <EOR> DJK far best Korean BBQ visited Vegas   meat always really fresh fatty huge problem other Korean restaurants town    unlike EJay favorite pieces ones aren't marinated   dip cooked pieces into sesame oil salt pepper mix place lettuce leaf add some chili paste you're food heaven   But even better bbq amazing amazing kimchi chigae here!  tastes just Mom's!! ok no restaurant quite good Mom but    Seriously ridiculously good   Plus add few pieces dduk each serving a little strange but tasty!    Oh banchan great!  love Korean style potato salad includes small chucks crisp apples   sounds weird but really cuts mayo    Lastly DJK friendliest servers encountered any valley Korean restaurants  <EOR> Services okay won't judge food because only tofo soup but environment  <EOR> My place Kalbi tang short rib soup   love place because they're open 24 hours offer 20% discount 11pm nightly  free side dishes tasty refills gladly given  <EOR> I eaten twice say both times disappointment  first time ate bbq meat low quality bean paste very good all sides fresh  second time came ordered dolsut bimbimbap which usually favorite dishes  very good egg fresh sunny side should instead cold pre cooked wtf?   boyfriend ordered beef soondubu which spicy no beef ever again wtf?   Both times come service extremely slow even ignore more other tables if Korean  only upside restaurant if you're ever low some chop sticks free taking  <EOR> We party 7 grill  asked if could love table 2 grills since busy all  server said no since need 8 people  Fine  service received terrible  Pretty sure being ignored whole time very stingy giving orders even though right when order came would finish right away  Food good when actually it  would recommend place  Find another Korean BBQ  <EOR> My son girlfriend friend late night dinner  Ordered food where service sucked  order meat combo no came around check them see if needed anything else  waitress sat behind counter whole time  While place wasn't packed  end bill charge $85ish complained bad service waa food ok  took 20% off but demanded leave 15% tip! Which them tip wasn't worth it! First last time going place  never going there  going back Tofu hut instead amd worth it! Gave 1 star but wouldn't given any    If place waa better would written better review! Word mouth would bring business back  Just lot customers! <EOR> From outside looks regular Korean Restaurant  big Chinese newspaper report restaurant caught eye  walk looks better  many Korean movie stars visited restaurant  even saw Paris Hilton's signature there   The service great  ordered hot pot two person  Taste delicious  ate several restaurants Vegas hotels place relaxed less expensive  <EOR> This worst korean food ive yet! soup water few peppers sprinkled it   sides sad limp old service horrific  never eat again! <EOR> Food great  Prices aren't bad came 25 person full   used AYCE Korean bbq price but honestly same amount food would AYCE but same time if brother eats lot sure would enough    thing threw off came cook food never spot does that   mean did good job but  said threw off  lady did friend eye when she stirred some onion popped off grill hit but luckily no lasting damage  <EOR> Not much really say DJK  open 24 7 food decent! Especially place 24 7  Now going compare place places LA  comparing hamburger DJK Denny's Numerous LA Korean Restaurants In n Out  Both burgers both meat buns etc  But very distinctive taste being fresher tastier more personality i e  Know mean? With being said DJK does happy hour think starts @ 11pm assuming cater service industry folks there  dining room service bad kinda everything you'd want fast courteous   The food really bad  Since usually those Vegas locals just happen stumble every chance usually soon tofu bim bim bop both stone regular  Every time gone everything ban chan dishes very decent  Really no negatives however wish would noodles 9 pm  <EOR> My friends crave kalbitang crazy night lunch twice   Dinner late night couple times other occasions     On most recent visit service pretty shoddy though courteous noon hour   Took long while banchan  which proves quite average each visit   did udon broth sweet way much msg friends kalbitang manduk noodle soup   Usually waitresses scoop rice stone pot  instead came dropped off plastic pitcher hot water friends kalbitang   I feel prices tad high  $13 95 soups  probably because prefer cheaper and more delicious Chinatown eats over DJK Pho strip mall     Clean bathroom smelly at noon ample parking   24 hours plus! <EOR> Came all eat offered single diners  What??? eaten just every all eat Korean BBQ LA San Diego Orange County all over SOCAL never heard such thing  ready several Korean brewskis soju BBQ we're OB large Cass but managed large WARM Hite    just did well high tailed door going steakhouse beef fix!

LARGE menu entrance does state 2 more !!! <EOR> Chose reaturant authentic Korean feel very close sitting Korea  servers very attentive ribs bulgogi well marinated   little pricy side but style unlimited side dishes well worth favorite sesame broccoli! <EOR> I may Indian but since coming Vegas befriending Koreans class quickly become avid fan Korean bbq  bunch places Chinatown none which remember names   except one   and  because favorite!  Unless Korean foodie Korean yourself would suggest going Korean friends order cook meat table  Each table comes own stove sorts cook meat veggies it  usually chicken which cook kitchen because spice sauce just way it!  You also bunch appetizer dishes before your main course includes fish cakes my personal fave kimchi spicy pickled veggies seaweed bean sprouts etc etc  place also 24 hours though would never venture into Chinatown alone past 10 pm  p  If your first time trying Korean bbq   go place! <EOR> Great traditional Korean Foods acually hard find traditional Korean food restaurant since fusion foods popular nowdays  <EOR> Not bad but apparently best Las Vegas  Los Angeles great spot called Tahoe Galibi very tasty but comes pretty close    Ordered sirloin pork shrimp I never remember right names   Shrimp eh though pork sirloin good  sister big fan shrimp maybe just me  did hand fresh rice some relationship frozen yogurt place next door I recommend pomegranate   <EOR> We just ate lunch  Food good  Staff excellent  didn't bbq option  Just ordered off menu  Expect pay $10+ pp  <EOR> We came pretty late but great service  constantly being attended to  prices reasonable options great  Although beer recommended everything else great  <EOR> High prices but GREAT quality  You really pay here   We King bbq  yummy!

Oh well  <EOR> We stopped korean bbq 8pm  ordered King bbq beef platter surprise meat overbearing scent it  closet thing could compare to   scent associated pork? odd! All cuts scent some more others  felt brisket heaviest scent but sister thought sirloin most  sure if typical told local food west coast isn't good when compared east water quality     I'm sure if come back future visits   service great but meat thing threw off  Maybe spoiled usual korean barbeque philly? <EOR> Went last week few friends some late night grub  ordered tofu stew came lukewarm enough cook egg lacked pork! waitress only gave 5 sides also   wth!? Where rest them! Sigh  really craving tofu stew too   next day when back home some real tofu stew amazing  place sucks  only perk 11pm 20% off  <EOR> A little pricey but Korean food especially Las Vegas area isn't? give plenty side dishes service decent  Open 24 hours which convenient those late nights  fan tofu soup seafood casserole  But main thing more Korean BBQ  <EOR> The food good however don't think would eat again    1  portions give really small   2  Customer service sucked  asked more side lady started putting sides table attitude  friends scared ask things because that  <EOR> Came dad lunch search decent Korean food thought pretty well place because appearance but  pretty much it  only clean  took 10 min seated which did sense because only 4 other tables seated    just but guy seated very dull welcoming which would normally such big deal but definitely off putting unnecessary wait  Took 15 more minutes ask water even then he didn't ask if ready order either  placed water order WATER which requires literally no preparation see wandering off elsewhere distribute food orders   The lady serving seemed manager rather rude unaware everything well but table next us  cart she rolling around food she should gently park side away people dining if being used  Instead she pushes cart away assuming would stop but CRASHES into other person! could hear sound come over apologize!? God forbid something hot burned her    Aside same guy still taking forever just decided skip elsewhere  mean point? didn't even order anything yet     Would DEFINITELY recommend place unless you're desperate OK Korean food unless you're literally most patient person world  <EOR> A must when visit Las Vegas  food always good employees always nice attentive  always order kalbi type soup but can't remember name but know where menu when open up  always good when place packed asian people your only can't speak language  back again sure  <EOR> This 24 hour place pretty large menu which nice when everyone your party wants something different   just wanted try place Love which table grilled meal 2 $40   included veggies pork beef grilling salad tofu soup soybean based soup rice couple side orders day drinks although only provide 5 banchan PLENTY food    D J K  solid 3 5 stars definitely back!!!  also noodles rice dishes grilled items hot pot alot other stuff plan trying soon   restroom trippy because everything black except huge sinks   right next door Korean market which super convenient! <EOR> This second time visiting cuz first time good  took friends same  nice experience last time  ordered queen bbq combo  None drink today change soju into ordinary hot Tea pot  But didn't severed any kind tea  even iced water  rude  asked paid check all them saying soju  mean hell needed hot tea when eating  means don't care ur experience  whatever  unacceptable  Low score   Don't come ever ever again  <EOR> Suggested friends lives Las Vegas  Awesome very authentic! <EOR> I love Korean BBQ never dissatisfied meal until came across particular restuarant    Restaurant busy but service still pretty good   The banchan decent but exactly enough satisfy 4 people  Included sesame broccoli kimchi fermented cucumbers mashed potatoes salad steamed egg tofu bowl bean sprouts   We ordered Jack combo brisket pork rib beef short rib beef substituted beef tendon chicken   meat tough selection poor nothing marinated  I'd say chicken best which says lot Korean BBQ place beef supposed most impressive   Overall isn't I'd consider good Korean BBQ  decent best but personally worst  <EOR> Okay no  don't care restaurant needs throw away msg  bet sack msg more then sacks rice  Korean food    it's very uh  COME MAN EAT KOREAN EVERYDAY IF EAT KOREAN MEANS SOMETHING! place overpriced food thats   eh  really eh  EH!!!!!! <EOR> The worst experience life  Never felt insulted before  Food mediocre overpriced  never food ordered  cashier rude friends felt humiliated  What's worse she forced pay tip such terrible service insulting Korean  worst experience ever if owner any sense business pay more attention training your servers  DONT EVER THERE! <EOR> Worse food ever overpriced slow non organized service   Never come back  Please don't waste your time money here  <EOR> Okay SoCal know means   LOTS yummy Korean food choose from  say place rates right yummies SoCal   We visiting Vegas weekend hooked some cousins town  brought here  very surprised amount food came   and kept coming  only place open 24 hours order many servings side dishes shovel your tummy! Oh didn't cook own stuff either  Every few minutes someone came check meat turn then pile more until finished everything ordered!! meat cooked just right very full flavor  sides think must gone through 3 orders cucumber daikon 5 6 orders fish cakes!!   The parking lot strip mall very crowded park several store fronts away but restaurant family friendly at least during dinner plus  preschooler loved food staff didn't seem mind she dropped fork few times needed extra napkins those kids know meal time be   restrooms clean too  Another plus someone bladder size pea preschooler   If Vegas car definitely worth venture slightly off Strip visit DJK  since they're open 24 hours come late night snack partying gambling then head back Strip your gut replenished! Heck probably even worth cab ride! <EOR> It's greatest kbbq honestly wait staff sucks  grill but grill fast feel obligated eat faster they're kicking out  side dishes also repetitive which four different types kimchi  fan <EOR> Best late night bbq!  Try queen king menu's 11 pm 20% off Great quality meat! <EOR> It's way over priced  mean don't mind paying more if food better  But just ordinary  $20 japchae??? friend lunch bill $40+ did order? Japchae some kind soup  Um   yenno much stuff $40 Chinatown during lunch hours?! <EOR> It first time having Korean BBQ can't judge its authenticity but overall food tasted nice  prices seemed bit high amount food though  <EOR> I came other night because craving tofu soup  Mr  Tofu absolute favorite craving tofu soup long time! Alas close 5 Fridays  did arrive 4 46 but already closed    Anyways decided try place instead since same plaza  Pricing quite bit more  regular tofu soup $12  pork flavor level 8 10  soup no flavor wasn't even spicy flavor  extremely disappointed since soup tasted horrible didn't satisfy craving  Plus pricier    The ban chan pretty tasty  kimchi kimchi radish fish cake broccoli amongst other things  However would rather better tasting soup  expected guess since Korean BBQ restaurant    The service pretty great  gentleman check few times  Granted only other person dining  <EOR> After five visits DJK past month half returning again very long time  Perhaps never again all   The first visit great  service okay food delicious  ordered daechang large intestine traditional kalbi  daechang treat due its rarity especially Vegas  slightly marinated which nice touch adds slight sweetness its rich fatty flavor  liked much returned four more times   This where bad begins  second visit mostly okay but daechang wasn't marinated properly lacked flavor  If dish wasn't prepared properly servers should told wasn't available  could ordered something else  Instead served anyway  served food forgotten food ended getting bit burnt  still edible place fairly busy gave them pass    The third visit things really bad  servers burn food AGAIN  waited over 15 minutes more rice side dishes water   only having flag down being ignored quite some time  11 PM when less 4 tables being served 4 servers working  ask straws three times  Twice server never procured them third time someone wasn't even serving table *eventually* brought them us  annoyed but just chalked tired workers long day   The fourth fifth visits just sucked  Why did two more times shaky third visit? Probably due combination having much faith mankind hankering marinated daechang can't found elsewhere town  now faith gone craving sweet fatty dish all but withered up    So long DJK  <EOR> Terrible service  would recommend place anyone woman threw menus table asked want it  food wasn't good especially price  She later asked tip still ruffling through wallet before left  Never  coming again <EOR> Best Korean restaurant town   I use live vegas recently visited Vegas convention    I don't usually Korean restaurant since parents Korean korean food anytime want but co workers Korea wanted home food And loved it  quote very surprise find Quality Korean restaurant Vegas! First impression upon arriving location joint CLEAN!

Give some good side dishes some rice call dinner!    This place located strip mall ish looking area Spring Mountain   first hard time finding its address because couldn't find Dae Jang Keum    But guess all cool kids know DJK plus heck say Dae Jang Keum unless they're Korean?  look DJK sign you're there!  We ordered typical BBQ meats everything ate delicious   only reason why took star off because really flag people down service    bad thing   But end night getting tired trying laser beam eye contact employee walked past table scurried past head down     If you're Vegas want check Korean restaurant check place out   Oh did mention UNLIMITED side dishes? <EOR> The place Korean food Vegas!  definitely helps if know order some knowlege Korean dishes  combo deals great but general foods added Vegas premium   Don't expect top notch Korean food L A  Fort Lee NYC but pretty good enough satisfaction  <EOR> This restaurant just change AYCE last month  Love AYCE meat  Amazing price  Service great  Very Attentive  definitely back next week  <EOR> I've lived Vegas 10 years almost all Korean restaurants Vegas taste prefer DJK most  When come family we'll grill combos usually Jack ask substitute pork belly more brisket  good portion comparatively same others town except more side dishes  Hobak good but doesn't all sides DJK comes bean paste stew coddled steamed eggs  also don't drink sofa versus soju  I'm Korean grew Los Angeles looking authentic Korean taste DJK hits spot  lunch dinner several times month  Overall well  easy  Also few places Vegas where naengmyun scratch  If bibim naengmyun spicy great version although fan meat pieces naengmyun    Their kimchi always ripe starting Nov introduced new kimchi stew  really good  ask them add rice cakes dduk it  really tasty   Over years think they've gotten enough non Korean speakers service improved  Recently noticed serving staff doesn't speak Korean new   Their main problem facility around 20 years shiny  But terms food pretty good  don't think you'll disappointed  <EOR> Annyong ha seo? Being half Korean love enjoy good Korean meal time time  first couple times family came food good service fast left feeling satisfied  recent visit same  Service slow food good now automatically add tip meal even though family only party 4  Prices little highend too  meat selection still good well japchae noodles  sure if visit place often before but if you're area large party where don't mind tip being added automatically worth giving try  <EOR> Kind pricey food but bad place go   love thought decent  <EOR> Dont place 12    The service gets really really really bad  The ladies unfriendly rude unprofessional  point openinf late when u lack workers them give worst experience?

Highly recommend Kalbi lunch special soy bean paste soup spicy pork lunch special  restaurant itself clean comfortable seats nice bathrooms  Service good but only waiters    much older Korean women  Maybe she having bad day   Overall good place eat! Convenient parking too! <EOR> Ive good experience place once  came back friend very disappointed  hair side dishes  Service horrible place wasn't even packed  <EOR> great late night place grub!!!  happy hour discount 11pm!  5 minute ride strip really easy drive if car   food price decent far never crowded wait  <EOR> Saying place terrible understatement   wish could give 0 stars   mother sister visiting Las Vegas few days we Korean btw count know good Korean food supposed taste like    decided come late bite around 11 30pm Friday night   When walked entire restaurant COMPLETELY empty no background music playing making place look sad desolate   fact completely deserted Friday night definitely irked us    We seated woman seemed she manager owner   She seemed pretty off putting did put any effort welcoming especially when only customers entire place   When tried order food she told lot basic menu items wanted all buckwheat noodle nengmyun dishes all smaller beers etc unavailable 11pm giving excuse turn specific set cookers off which used nengmyun noodles   pure laziness   Because decided bibimbap order each us   She gave waters which tasted terrible tap water   first thought really weak Korean barley water but then realized serving tap water just tasted and smelled disgusting   didn't even touch water which sad seeing pretty hard mess WATER   Then brought side dishes banchan which tasted old poorly cooked   kimchi even edible  tasted very old sour 'carbonated' taste which only happens when old kimchi sits long fridge    bean sprouts kongnamul undercooked also inedible   blanched spinach side dish also tasted old soggy if leftover entire day restaurant   All other banchan mediocre say least   None tasted fresh bad even made lose appetite bit   Finally main bibimbap dishes came along small side anchovy soup each us   mom sister ordered stone pot bibimbap while ordered regular one   white rice came dishes overcooked soggy which made entire bibimbap dish inside stone pot wet mushy    bibimbap themselves pretty mediocre doubt any veggies them fresh just banchan gave us  anchovy soup also cold time reached table which barely touched   end couldn't finish any bibimbap food because un appetizing tasteless everything else was   red pepper paste kochujjang used dishes more flavorful actual veggies meat bibimbap itself     I couldn't finish most bibimbap decided rest to go effort maybe cook into something tastier   When asked to go box lady looked food then condescendingly says Korean if take to go food rice bloated won't taste good   Um excuse but didn't ask your two cents   lady gave check only small to go container asked if she could another one   She looked if made impossible request then comes back another container bag which she dropped left seat   After left restaurant couldn't stop talking terrible food was   Yes really bad   Maybe food BBQ better during day but if case then really shouldn't business open 24 7 if food can't consistent!  TL DR  don't Vegas seek amazing Korean food per se but even restaurant doesn't come close making map   Very disappointing place none food tasted fresh even decent   worst Korean places very long time   Terrible customer service   Very unfortunate many items food+alcohol menu unavailable certain time night seeing open 24 7   Highly advise elsewhere  <EOR> This place kind disappointment  average Thursday night  Wife bibimbop ordered galbi which refused let cook table since only BBQ order which fine  understand don't want clean more to  No even made any effort come check during meal refill water  Food average $35 mediocre galbi over priced IMO  service thumbs down  return   Might add pulled credit card wallet set down table showed bill before even hit table  All while managing avoid empty water glass purposely pushed 3mm edge table <EOR> We Labor Day Weekend assumed would very busy but fact table right away place crowded  why very surprised slow service  ordered very fast waited banchan waited little longer   and waited good 15 minutes ordering finally arrived loved dried fish algae thingy but immediately brought tofu soups kalbi little annoyed fortunately soup hot enough not hot other places serve it could wait but kalbi couldn't eat real fast  Since extraordinarily busy slow service dissapointment    As food  tofu soup best but spoiled LA Koreatown restaurants but bad edible just needed today   also pricier other korean restaurants other cities  Korean bbq seemed overly priced usually pay no more tnan $15 per person LA even Rowland Heights  Kalbi good small pieces cooked well    Probably would only come back night drinking 20% off 24 hr service which definitely plus them  try other place next time see where stand  far asian restaurants Las Vegas standards compared LA other cities known Asian neighborhoods  <EOR> If craving KBBQ Las Vegas places open 24 7!

All smiles  <EOR> For last meal together Vegas decided Korean BBQ  pretty excited tired hungry dancing partying all EDC weekend also because all preparing airport just few hours   We strolled into Dae Jang Keum thought hmmm smells pretty good    pleasant experience downhill there  deciding order wanted order smaller package bbq 3 then 3 apps since 3 girls 2 guys    typically Asian girls don't eat lot bbq could order more sides apps   weren't trying cheap just didn't want bbq buffet table when wanted try some appetizers  Well didn't sit well waitress    but also keep mind heading airport shortly    wants smell bbq 5 hour flight? Anyway ordering whatever asked afterwards    more tea clean plate utensils whatever name she would give dirty look just  plopped table  also uncomfortable ask when soju ordered coming   Overall food pretty decent  delicious price alright  However side sizes little small side most Korean restaurants replenish within reason  but mentioned earlier she wasn't thrilled this  food really did hit spot however service less stellar  <EOR> After long day trade show nearby hotel Rio ordered food go  ordered Kimchi Chigae Bulgoki  $47  In LA same order would $25 4 Star  The food needed eating dry hotel tradeshow food all day    The food ready since ordered phone  parking easy drive back room Rio less 5 minutes  Hot food delivery room all less 30 minutes   Good take orders    <EOR> This place below average several reasons   Usually Korean bbq places lavish loads panchan small appetizer dishes  Sometimes upwards 20 dishes really enjoy variety  place only served 6 small plates   The price kalbi $38!! Back chicago half that    The server also seemed more interested making small talk fellow regulars serving us   which slightly annoying  <EOR> To honest flavor Okay but food portion small comparing its price  came only because dinner time only place didn't need wait hours  <EOR> After inhabiting earth 27 years finally pleasure experiencing Korean BBQ first time ever Vegas all places   left $10 dollar beers behind @ XS decided time loosen belt buckles D J K   couple awesome Koreans guided through menu   ok  lie   they ordered but glad did!  must must try soju strong Korean liquor!  really enhances food   Also if you're 11pm 2am 20% off your bill! <EOR> First time being empty  funny thing food good  going lot AYCE Korean BBQ meats pretty much flavored same  sauces difference me  salad better some restaurants others  sauce better others some restaurants    As far cleanliness clean  parking hassle though since place all restaurants row  good thing don't wait long since packed  course favorites but when all other places packed because decent place eat  <EOR> Bad service over price unprofessional!!!! finish eating front paid w credit card didn't put tips card bcuz already put cash tips table     cashier ask if put tips table?
