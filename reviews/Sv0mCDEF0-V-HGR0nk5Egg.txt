Bartender John very friendly helpful! area away strip perfect place! ordered fries appetizer which turned perfect   Great place! glad decided migrate out! <EOR> DO GAMBLE HERE  starters odds lowest level allowable which means winning isn't likely  top graveyard bartender named Brian working   I gambled around $200 told would charged next beer   WOW  now don't blame Brian he explained ignorant owners when came gaming knowledge  Bottom line playing $200 then also pay beer   owners don't it  just another example someone shouldn't own bar gaming  Won't back  DON'T GAMBLE HERE!!! <EOR> Went punk rock show last night stages both inside great idea  However beer prices down right lame   Five bucks 12 0Z PBR? expect raped House Blues but neighborhood bar  wanted love place great kitchen friendly bartenders door guy sweetheart  Just need more reasonable those beer prices  Id rather few extra bucks buy some merch few cool bands! <EOR> Came last night Saturday Reggae Ska music few friends  place pretty dead but DJ playing rad music drinks cheap! $13 50 round drinks 3 friends?

The fellow took order refreshing!  When he asked preference cheese burger responded American fine which he responded Good Choice! LOL Back food watch lady squash every last bit juice patty flat top flipping patty @ 50 times LOL already dreading positive note asked burger Medium wasn't over done put tons lettuces pile red onion sliced most peculiar way hamburger    end strips? appeared tiny end slice tomato burger   No dressing present ask mayo fact more thing though odd put bun flat top toast but outside bun Not part should toasted! LOL serve generous portion Fresh cut fries which great if know cook them But slicer straight into hot oil moisture escapes potato all oil soaked Limp soaked oil kind burned cool pub back nice people but 0% technique simplest sandwich menu Almost dropped someone different Planet set them ingredients said classic American Sandwich! Oh next review them new BBQ menu running couple Oil Barrel BBQ's trailer front would tried first but afraid might critical! <EOR> I electronic scene some time  lived 20's Bay Area fell love both music its accompanying culture  entered musical desert early 30's took away genre  any case desert wander stumbled oasis known The Hard Hat Lounge  Music line night those interested checking music online see if venue plays stuff https www residentadvisor net events 1031838  By large pleased playing  Having said scene bit am going hold off trying categorize overall music  Terms Progressive House could well crucified music police there!   But THINK remember term sounded like    Acoustically REALLY good sound system  Both outside venue where some tables seats chill  Well if could stop dancing sec  Sometimes session just good!   Clientele wise demo graph based night early 20's  few outliers like   Which HOPE does mean find scene Las Vegas geared older partiers! But back topic see all classic stuff associated genre very cute women spinning twirling throwing led glowing hula hoops dudes other light emitting devices but both cases worth moment your time check out  Some performers quite skilled impressed   Interior expected very divey but certainly worst seen  Hell some people way though seedier better know? each own  important thing felt safe enough enjoy myself    I guess only negative evening food little kitchen  problem if want burger some similar bar food  But guess kinda bugged $12 Korean Bulgogi plate didn't come kimchi listed they ran out didn't come cucumber salad it lettuce salad some pickles didn't actually any bulgogi meat   hamburger meat see link bulgogi looks like https www google com search?q=bulgogi+meat spell=1 sa=X ved=0ahUKEwjb_4Ci9KfXAhUR0mMKHZK0ASQQvwUIJSgA biw=1296 bih=718  Which guess some might care I hungry didn't much   fine line between marketing lying know but felt compelled call BS one! Other bad venue  <EOR> I'm updating review say some bands actually pretty awesome reggae night rap fun night worth checking but giving star because always alcohol  Dirty  Roaches  friends worked never paid  Totally professional    I'm updating review again because new owner actually cares place  Things looking nice  employees nicer  <EOR> After night walking around first friday friends bumped into place  let tell you      This place impressed H E double hockey sticks me  Drinks pretty cheap crowd pretty friendly  girl kitchen some meaaaan food   Also live music happen school bus converted into stage dj booth  absolute coolest thing very unexpected small dive bar downtown    I later found hard hat managed same guy used run Bunkhouse  anyone knows bunkhouse place before    I recommend place anyone wants good time small budget  <EOR> Surprisingly clean Vegas dive bar! Smoking allowed inside but doors open most time smoke doesn't build bad  There's outdoor seating area if want step some fresh air  Fairly small inside stage live music  Open kitchen back currently Cody's BBQ good brisket! Signs everywhere say water $1 assume deter unsavory types overstaying welcome  <EOR> So coming over last 2 years seen changes historic locale   say they're definitely heading right direction become best dive bars area   weakest link which lack good food finally fixed   If you're into flavorful burgers look no further   menu little something every random craving such selection grilled cheeses several bar appetizers even dessert Carrot cake Funky Monkey         Add food hosting live local bands great djs you'll find yourself becoming regular no time!!! <EOR> Agreed Vegas dive bar but  bad thing  There's video poker keno food reasonably priced drinks  always hosting good edm nights  saw Machete spin few months ago good stuff  Only bad part cigarettes  smoke deep leave smelling wet ashtray  Total bummer especially if don't smoke  <EOR> Wouldn't back  cool spot all but expensive dive bar  Maybe show but felt overpriced spot really is  Bartender nice carded twice since don't security checking comes into place  <EOR> Not bad local joint  good bbq spot inside but since disappeared  Its still nice place stop drink long day work  Would def come again  <EOR> First trip slow sunday afternoon  Would most likely done but bartender friendly playing great mix classic rock stay few  little way but GPS worth stop  Listed dive bars but real clean seams fairly new because it  grill food also  <EOR> This tiny dive bar down street several strip clubs  very random spot  But clean nice despite being dive y  staff friendly  There's TVs gaming  There's also really good BBQ spot inside too  Beer offerings standard  There's decent outdoor patio area  worthy trip seek place out  <EOR> This place needs crowd because literally isn't one  Ever  ideal dive just need bring everyone know take plunge    The mural legendary say because all bartender's different legend   if your curious find where painted stage naked ladies may may hidden need drinkin'  !!

BUT   real star mural Frank Maverick Bowers 1963   mural evokes more feeling 1956 63 but maybe Maverick stuck painting ways   legend he painted mural pay off bar tab google name may find more mentions doing other areas Los Angeles   awesome mural bar proud of! <EOR> I came lounge see Bobby Yang work musical magic live   accompanied Unrivaled Players he did just appreciative Yelpers other lounge regulars   narrow small building barely fit all attendees but did just manage so   feed too!  My Montana Club ham turkey bacon chipotle mayo lettuce tomato onions sourdough bread large very tasty  except somewhat overpowered spicy chipotle which added big kick   saw skin on Fries freshly deep fried but tasted unseasoned rather dead      The two female bartenders friendly efficient mural painted site 1963 eye catching live sounds Bobby Yang Unrivaled Players well worth listening live enhanced interpretive dancing past Las Vegas Yelp CM now DJ Misti Y  excellent acoustics   This bar character!  5 stars Bobby Yang Unrivaled Players 4 stars Hard Hat Lounge overall <EOR>
