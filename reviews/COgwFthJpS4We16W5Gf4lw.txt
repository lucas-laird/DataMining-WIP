The other unique selling point basket crudites whole boiled eggs offer start meal  food traditional French  Tasty but maybe modern style even French food moving days  did enjoy meal but some dishes could perhaps lighter touch sauces creme brulee wasn't good version home   Worth look but maybe date 2 3 rather 1st date  <EOR> Came Valentine's Day fantastic time!   This place very romantic  Old school Vegas its finest  seated promptly though showed 20 minutes early reservation  menu four course prix fixe due holiday but choice appetizer entree    I tried Lobster Bisque very good  little lighter most which appreciated because really into super thick soups    Salad good but can't remember ingredients forgettable   Soft Shell Crab ordered realizing wave regret washed over when set down front me  am into eating whole bodies creatures  However spirit evening since did order tried it  very delicious!

worst part  food HORRENDOUS  Stuff would see kitchen nightmares  foie gras appetizer did even taste foie gras! expensive! ripoff  entrees horrendous  duck breast osso buco  Both sauces tasted disgusting congealed box gravy similar would school cafeteria  meat over cooked under seasoned  mushrooms osso buco RAW  duck confit duck confit  just over cooked duck leg  dessert soufflé just sugary scrambled eggs whipped cream  could but honestly no point because hopefully anyone reads save themselves expensive meal TERRIBLE service DISGUSTING food   Save your money real restaurant  <EOR> Many years ago used favorite places Las Vegas  anymore    We used come when lived area 20 years ago loved special occasions  very much looking forward sharing favorite places family visiting town  horribly disappointed whole experience    The restaurant itself changed bit last 20 years  same cozy French Country decor which leans towards ruffles cheery yellow flowered cloth lace  cheerful but feels sadly dated  very disconcerting except large group restaurant completely empty Saturday night  also stayed empty entire evening    We greeted very warmly seated right away water poured for charge drinks offered served  huge multi page menu presented very large wine menu  traditional large basket crudete placed table little ramekins dressing each place  veggies always nice work well nibble while reading though menu sipping glass wine  serve only wine beer  also given slices French bread which warm fresh  Off good start  Unfortunately all downhill there    We all ordered off Pix fixe menus some four courses some five  first course Crudete   Feuillete Wild Mushrooms second course  puff pastry light flaky but mushrooms little bit off flavor seemed very heavy  main course Chicken Cordon Bleu  looked tasted  Shwann's frozen Cordon Blue thick chunk dry chicken breast wrapped around small piece cheese product sliver tasteless meat  whole thing dry bland  Marsalla Mushroom Sauce tasted exactly odd tasting mushroom gravy appetizer  mixed wild rice dry tasteless  Dark Chocolate Mousse dessert best part meal but anywhere near light creamy rich chocolatey dessert hoping for    The service attentive familiar way intrusive  head waiter hovered intruded himself upon conversation  He told jokes continued call grown women party miss  young lady   something 60+ year old woman find condescending any way complimentary  designated driver told wine steward only pour small glass wine early dinner  He continued try refill glass asked if something wrong wine  repeat driving no did need any more wine    I am very sad see restaurant lost its luster  holdover Old Las Vegas  am afraid overstayed welcome needs retire  <EOR> Romantic French restaurant   Pamplemousse le Restaurant   Any time wife travel enjoy venturing new restaurants  Las Vegas no exception  try eat any high end chef sponsored spots because can't justify value quality  chefs endorse maybe invest some own cash

   I ordered Bouchee De Fruit De Mer second course  beautiful puff pastry filled langoustino tails scallops lobster bisque saffron sauce  HEAVEN MOUTH  Next sorbet cleanse palate    I ordered Veal Medallions La Plancha  Nope vegetarian anymore   tender  delicious     To finish off meal Grand Marnier soufflé  good all but tasted mouth full eggs  Since only options dessert chocolate top chocolate I'm chocolate girl soufflé only option restaurant week  probably wouldn't order again    My girls great time  service awesome although girls felt waiter deliberately skipping over wine glass during refills   would great place bring date since very cozy romantically lit  Well done Pamplemousse  back  <EOR> 3 5 stars  I really thought dinner would special but wasn't   first person restaurant 5 30   seated bus person corner table where content be   waiter French accent suggested might want better spot but happy where was   restaurant made small rooms intimate seating low lighting   would romantic place go   I Groupon $50 ordered off à la carte menu   brought  some slices wonderful baguette small dish butter   Then came basket very large crudités   Finally small plate olives both green ripe   dijon dipping sauce vegetables very tasty   only few pieces zucchini eat much before meal   The homemade terrine de foie gras bit disappointment   guess comparing other foie gras eaten came short   did presentation toast points separated dish salt pepper greens some dressing small amount cranberry relish plate   Next came filet au poivre   bit done me   asked rare somewhat rare but should ordered black blue   error theirs   cracked pepper great peppercorn sauce excellent!  pommes frites bit hard although weren't over browned   small broiled tomato slice steak   For dessert pre ordered chocolate lava cake homemade vanilla ice cream whipped cream   took waiter's suggestion because torn between Grand Marnier soufflé   dessert fantastic   waiter broke top cake would soufflé   Some molten chocolate came lathered sides cake   He then added scoop ice cream topped whipped cream   Summary Although first person didn't seem ready even though opened half hour before   bus person brew iced tea which took awhile   Since many diners wine maybe isn't priority them   bus person didn't bring sugar artificial sweetener even though he asked once if wanted said yes   10 minutes later he realized he forgotten he asked again   wasn't busy     While food good expected much more hype place   glad tried but sure I'd return  <EOR> We fabulous experience here  restaurant small cozy romantic  service well tailored yet friendly approachable  food well presented delicious  each ordered five course menu  enjoyed interesting presentation vegetable crudités basket  appetizer asparagus

private room another couple across no music    awkward say least but it    tape holding red velvet carpet together   place need makeover    liked low lighting pale pink walls definitely romantic feel     The house Sauvignon blanc terrible   cheap 2 buck chuck thought might skunked   started off cruditte which thought cute touch   mustard vinaigrette very potent but liked it   eat another bite lettuce then happened   found fly fork   know happens every restaurant world just let didn't finish salad     Onto main courses hanger steak filet mignon shrimp skewers   Both steaks average   Cooked appropriately but nothing rave about   shrimp favorite part meal   presentation pathetic fries Luke warm definitely burger king quality   supposed garlic mashed potatoes waiter brought them sayin oh right supposed come he didn't believe us   mashed potatoes gritty tasted instant     Needless say didn't stay desert  place needs overhaul just neighborhood in   disappointed because hoping find hole wall  <EOR> Very unprofessional staff  could hear them bickering fighting constantly  girlfriend ordered lamb half cooked medium other half medium rare  tried serve wine even said No different person
