From Restaurant Consultants Perspective  As most ramen diners know Las Vegas becoming pretty saturated ramen restaurants   true Spring Mountain Road there's Sora Ramen Monta just street   Then Hiromaru Fusion ramen opens few months ago   important when going Hiromaru understand fusion restaurant typical Japanese ramen restaurant   The location very good centrally located end cap center   feature did personally hyper lighting installed contemporary design   almost need sunglasses enter especially when entering evening   But design elements excellent colors vanilla Asian red   definitely no short cuts taken Hiromaru Unlike disappointing design Monta pleasantly surprised attention detail Hiromaru    The food service fine especially restaurant young terms age   ramen good well service   price points excellent   important thing always remember any restaurant question Would return food?  answer would yes especially since pretty good features already which include good food service atmosphere   The restaurant manager nice enough come table   explained lighting issue contemporary ottoman style seating   manager listened intently took mental notes   lighting issue he explained going switch Japanese style lighting which incorporates rice paper shades   ottoman style seating bit difficult move especially younger people women wearing dresses   no back rests chairs left struggling move them   manager quickly noted looking into sliders which would placed under each leg would sliding chairs much easier   Ultimately Hiromaru ramen successful   excellent opportunity player ramen market Las Vegas   important thing willing listen diners which can't said many Japanese restaurants!  Hopefully they'll lighting seating issue resolved next visit   meantime keep mind when first enter typical most ramen houses you'll very contemporary well   long understand issues you'll really good experience! <EOR> Last week second time coming here  all ramen menu both visits  say all them good they're traditional Japanese noodles   They're definitely fusion   something different loved it! all everything amazing! Staff great under tables place people put belongings when eat  cannot wait till open other side restaurant Izakaya! <EOR> Ramen good your typical ramen but very tasty  decor reminded A Clockwork Orange which cool but seats no backing old quick  <EOR> Short Good ramen might nice change pace interesting environment  There's better ramen shops area but bit unique   Long Came friend spotting drive home Monta Ramen  Looks rather odd outside but inside rather interesting  Kinda? looks rather modern inside feels bit uncomfortable me  I ordered Shiro Tonkotsu ramen just set standard review place from  typical tonkotsu ramen milk added  noodles toppings broth pretty close Monta ramen's but chashu bit firmer which made more flavorful but broth mix wasn't strong Monta ramen's  Service alright can't complain there   Go if want try something different  other tonkotsu miso shoryu else where other unique ramen spots though!   if something intrigues menu but sits unique spins good more traditional places  I'd choose Monta over place 9 10 times  <EOR> Yes must LV  Me buddy Carbonara thick noodles Shiroi Tonkotsu thin noodles  Not salty both rich flavor deepness soup  Thin noodles traditional style Tonkotsu noodles which it  Thick noodles very unique chewy  Both soup noodles great! <EOR> I shiroi tonkotsu dessert   The decor visually interesting but red square chairs heavy   Quick side note Considering color scheme red white why two color themed ramens kuroi black shiroi white ?  could develop tantanmen spicy ramen  call akai red lol   The service fine prompt seating placing order refilling drinks clearing table   opinion could learn explain promote menu items better    The shiroi tonkotsu fine nothing rant nothing rave about   liked generous amount bean sprouts add $1   did kikurage mushrooms being cold   press drown them broth order heat them up   What most impressed dessert  yellow cake layer pear fruit thick cream dolloped top   surrounded liquor based ? sauce dressed berries morsels chocolate   delicious find odd such fancy dessert served casual restaurant setting   taste buds complaining star meal     I might come back try izakaya side menu  <EOR> New Ramen place!! We tried Curry Karaage other Ramen  For Curry meat little fatty asked more rice they did charge They gave green salad desert compliments  A little pricy  <EOR> I love ramen guess only more tradition ramen because don't really place  2 different type ramen tried both pretty salty although unique concept but does salty?    The gyoza probably worst ever ever had   Maybe forgot wash frying pan cooking something else super starchy  just gyoza  gyoza came table only very shining oily but gelatin like coating   minute arrived table coating turned bit cold course full piece mystery starchy film came off right chopsticks  threw away course still eager try non gelatin gyoza anyway mediocre best  probably cheap frozen brand least tastes is   Don't recommend anyone order it    The karaage also very mediocre  much breading same gelatin feel   Don't understand screw simple gyoza fried chicken  But did    If you're true ramen fan stick know Monta Sora Tatsu  Forget place  <EOR> Cool place yummy food!   I am Monta fan especially since Henderson but Japanese fiance wanted try place instead pleasantly surprised  place clean interesting decor  ramen super tasty! He garlic which BOMB made wish ordered instead  carbonara which delicious own right but traditional ramen  shared dumplings which also great  only complaint parking SUCKS but fault really just prepared circle parking lot 10min before able catch someone leaving! <EOR> I really loved Black Garlic ramen   buns excellent too  Service fine        biggest negative lighting heavy chairs    It bright thought dentist office Walgreens  Decor could little warmer    least fill empty walls little    darker paint    I love Fukumimi Monta    restaurant offers different very yummy ramen    But if  bring friends east coast try ramen Vegas probably would nt take them because brightness    Yes food matters but personally would feel way better less office lighting setting   food part down    hang important well  <EOR> First time pleasant surprise  few ramen places open Vegas since Monta all minor differences  Apparently Japanese chain its first restaurant US   Started Hiromaru fried rice fluffy rice dish pork belly served over two fried eggs  Really enjoyed dish  Then Shiroi Tonkatsu ramen   Unbelievable flavor creamer broth thin noodle   group eleven don't think anyone anything but raves meal  Service management great getting large group seated getting food quickly  <EOR> This place lot potential   Atmosphere kind weird  felt claustrophobic  side joint nice bright other dark gloomy  Music waa very faint  ramen actually 2nd best town  Very flavorful many options  back again try something new  <EOR> I just ate thought better write review while its still fresh mind    Overall beautiful restaurant terrific place eat  come back recommend other people  Food service great!   We ate Thursday around 6 pm busy time  quickly seated friendly manager  waitress excellent graciously attentive    We ordered beers Karrage Carbonara ramen Black garlic ramen  Ice cold glasses filled fresh Asahi draft  Karaage hot delicious shared plate but should've ordered two  received complimentary edemame  soups beautiful tasty  Carbonara delicious but preferred black garlic   need come back dessert!  My critiques minor  think south wall restaurant could use some color more decoration  wall now just feels empty  red cube ottoman seats cumbersome  hard pull scoot in  should upholsterer add handles upper sides  ladies' room would appreciate seat protector liners small mirror  least mirror hallway   husband did say men's bathroom cool urinal!  There additional room being finished up  dark world cool ambiance  manager said would izakaya room    Thanks!  On side note When typed Hiro intoYyelp did find restaurant  type entire Hiromaru name  Poor coding Yelp's part  <EOR> First foremost come open mind because Fusion Ramen most likely won't you're used if regularly eat other ramen houses   The decor really nice simple which gives modern feel  can't say much service since husband take but limited interaction server she super friendly helpful    The noodles chashu done exceedingly well  noodles great fresh flavor loved could taste egg within noodle    I Shiroi Tonkotsu  whole flavors blend really well together  saltiness broth flavor noodle really offset fatty flavor chashu but drinking broth alone salty me  flavor just preferred dipping sauce noodles meat  menu states low salt option broth most likely try next time   Also if try thing off menu would suggest trying Hiromaru Buns  really good flavor just right amount spice   actually surprised because usually can't eat pork belly because fatty but loved buns  <EOR> Craving ramen decided try new place town headed Hiromaru fusion ramen   no very comfortable fusion word restaurants since firm believer original  better  Having said some instances when mixing two cuisines something wonderful created ahead ordered ramen carbonara quickly realized wasn't those instances  For ramen carbonara some version Olive Garden's carbonara complete waitress grinding fresh pepper into plate she asks tell when stop  soft melt mouth pork used ramen dishes nothing more plain bacon dish broth tasted very watery Alfredo sauce     Service good all employees very attentive try best feel comfortable although atmosphere dining room very  inviting lights very bright combination mostly white red accents room made feel eating middle target store commercial shooting  More earthy colors could place more welcoming dimmer lighting more relaxing   different note can't exactly recall playing but music awesome but music playing car way home wishing would've some real Japanese ramen    may come back again but next time order something more authentic menu now give place three stars  <EOR> Came 2nd soft opening day  LOT waiters waitresses waiting door greeted second door opened  Two friend's already arrived time friend gotten oops took long way apparently    XD rather slow way haha     First impressions LOTS people working  Probably used environment process  Decor  Very simple  Red White  First thought why does remind n Out    ? LOL anyway Design almost kept when Cafe de Japon existed  Bar area  More open now various table set ups  Chairs bit bottom heavy easy move    Each person served small salad bowl even before ordering  surprising Since still soft opening offering complete menu   Carbonara Ramen $10 95 Signature ramen noodle fusion inspired popular Italian Carbonara pasta  soup base original tonkotsu pork broth milk  Toppings included egg yolk bacon shiso fresh scallions  type noodle selected ramen flat thick noodles    First impression something new try  rendition popular italian dish japanese style  Soup base light due broth being mixed milk which dont think normal cow milk reminds soy milk maybe?   Noodles thick non traditional ramen noodles which don't see often but cooked nice al dente which gives nice bite ! =D egg yolk im pretty sure laid raw left broth cook slightly? gives nice rich flavor overall  Bacon gives nice flavor esp since lightly seared grill but fan bacon  shiso leaf actually look off guard  Gives something along lines maybe basil flavor? Overall ramen bad since its lighter shiroi tonkotsu ramen  favorite but noodles use    Shiroi Tonkotsu Ramen $7 95 The best salted ramen created salted sauce brown garlic oil  soup base original tonkotsu pork broth salted sauce  Toppings included chashu pork hard boiled egg fresh scallions kikurage  type noodle selected ramen thin noodle    Thin noodles  Overcooked opinion  Cooked bit long  Lost its bite   soup quite salty  Probably salted sauce     whatever could be  Very heavy garlic flavor mostly garlic oil  surprising did hard boiled eggs  I'd prefer soft boiled egg runny yolk  kikurage wood ear fungus quite normal japanese style ramen  thing nice chashu  comparison Monta fatty all  Majority meat thin line fat  nice touch seared grill  Adds nice flavor it  bad ramen though soup base salted sauce this?!? quite salty    During soft opening also few side orders available    Hiromaru Gyoza $5 50 Grilled pork dumpling  Hiromaru Buns $6 00 Two steamed buns filled butabara pork belly served Hiromaru original sauce  Karaage $5 00 Japanese fried chicken  Pretty good ! start off meat dark meat  top its marinated seasoned even inside meat flavorful  batter used thick nice crispy  Nice side !   HIromaru Japanese Curry $8 50 Japanese style curry rice chashu pork  To honest upon bring brought order first thing came mind overpriced   $8 50 amount small bowl rice pool curry sauce slice pork two short spears asparagus sliver red bell pepper  curry sauce      very UNDER whelming  Flavor wasn't there  Felt diluted  flavorful all some curry  Some said its would box curry grocery store  strong all  tasted sauce straight up  If ate rice id like    uhhh wheres curry? Aside slide pork? really? wow      Service wise very attentive  picked finished bowls quickly quick refill water  Hope attentive service last opening    On side note another room decorated differently next door  waitress told dinner service izakaya? well some private VIP rooms too  decor complete opposite original side    Overall bad soft opening new style  Would come back try different side dishes next time gyoza buns well other two ramen offer menu  price ramen i'd say should include more slide pork though  Seemed little skimped only 1 slice     <EOR> I ordered gyoza ramen black garlic oil    Gyoza crispy near edges lot softer center  loved texture gyoza towards edges but center bit soft soggy compared other gyozas    The ramen noodles hard which nice texture soup  soup base tasty but bit much flavor oiliness almost seemed overcome overall ramen  Towards end oil just much couldn't drink soup    I think overall ramen good but think restaurant tried hard ramen taste good oiliness extra flavors mixed took away general first impression  <EOR> Came try much hyped Carbonara ramen  Why fusion ramen place if don't try fusion dishes right?  Interior surprisingly modern despite more traditional exterior  Service polite sat right hand side red white decor couple more intimate left hand side sure difference seated there   Started Hiromaru buns appetizer quite nice doughy buns plentiful portions pork special sauce  quite liked almost barbecue like sauce pork cooked in   Carbonara ramen myself black garlic guy  I pleasantly surprised dish little apprehensive thinking broth would thicker create texture did not fan alfredo sauces but somehow worked being milky flavorful without being decadent overly rich though was   Did specify thick noodles initially would preferred but received thin appreciated similarity spaghetti carbonara added fusion feel dish overall  bacon fresh ground pepper really made dish adding just bit bite flavor meaty savory element balanced milky broth  even bacon fan!  My guy favored garlic ramen took few bites wasn't really flavors bold but seemed little off  He less ramen but proclaimed favorite bowl far which impressive  Egg bit overcooked but overall dish tasty but just slightly off almost felt incomplete something missing   I say despite giant bowls rich broths ramen did feel overwhelmingly heavy dinner perhaps choice thin noodles? big bowl ramen good comfort food but liked feeling sloshing belly full of dinner feeling afterward  Would come back try other milk broth ramen ham  <EOR> We Carbonara Shiroi Tonkotsu Kuroi Tonkotsu    The Carbonara rich creamy perfectly seasoned interesting wide noodle just really beautifully done   The Shiroi table favorite hands down  Slightly creamy but heavy Noodles cooked perfection overdone  perfect balance flavors    The Kuroi earthy meaty  Very enjoyable  think may wintertime favorite me    The atmosphere hip crisp clean  great service all ladies there  definitely going back again  can't wait try Tate Yama <EOR> Ramen fusion Carbonara Ramen creative take Ramen  tried Black Garlic Ramen taste ok definitely come back try carbonara Ramen  tried Fried Rice Chashu hot plate good  karaage really good  place well designed roomy  <EOR> Had called several days advance spoke staff having larger group come if could separate checks all  assured wasn't issue  Upon arrival thank goodness arrived 15 minutes ahead group staff knew nothing reservation made staff several days earlier  very frustrating good 1st impression place  talking Carlo manager did situation squared away group all able sit together enjoy great meal together  Carlo way sure well taken care throughout meal even gave all complimentary dessert chef  very generous impressive considering lot places days don't seem care customer service  group loved service food ambiance etc  Hiromaru showed us    With large group ordered almost all items menu everything excellent  need remember Fusion Ramen going different Monta Chaya Ramen Sora Monta etc  personally ordered Hiromaru Buns Shiro Tonkotsu both excellent  actually ever ordered pork buns any other ramen venue them all  am indeed fan ordering them again Hiromaru  definitely coming back Hiromaru again  <EOR> Ate Kuroi tonkotsu pretty good  bit kotteri taste but know trend Ramen shops Japan   This place added cyclic visits Ramen  <EOR> Loving here   Service superb food heavenly serving size plentiful ambience invitingly modern!  Just ordered Shiroi Tonkotsu Ramen $7 95 Fried Ramen $8 95 Gyoza $5 bucks serving 6  Lucky me! Just redeemed 50% off discount gyoza   just checking in!!!   This Ramen spot sick days  <EOR> I don't know rage place but ordered Gyoza shiro tonkastu carbonara ramen more disappointed  gyoza tasted last night's take order  reheated soup base both ramen dishes tasted instant soup mix  service ok atmosphere good  just wish food could taste less processed more    cooked scratch something  <EOR> I would given place 5 stars because enjoyed ramen but found dust water assuming because just leave cups table knows long  asked waitress another cup water because obvious dust particles floating inside  She pretty annoyed didn't bother asking change cup    I gyoza shiroi tonkatsu may say gyoza best tasted  also 50% off gyoza if check in  <EOR> Yikes!!  I started dinner off Bao buns which sauce overload   messy eat took away pork belly  curry bowl boring side salad comes it  chicken karaage lacked some flavor but wasn't bad   On ramen!!! kuro ZERO garlic flavor anywhere  even slight aroma it  nothing more exciting aroma meal front me  tonkatsu very weird VERY short amazing   Kind let down made wish Monta Sora instead  Which two days later because needed fix disappointment I mentioned did kuro kind enough remove bill   Sorry but won't returning  <EOR> Hiramaro VS Monta The broths flavored differently creating different product each restaurant  Pro Hiramaru SERVICE! find Monta no longer takes time take care customers properly  service poor but genuine  Hiramaru provides great dining experience highly due service provides! Another Pro temperature broth Hiramaru allows enjoy ramen right when receive it  find tongue doesn't burn taste flavors throughout meal  Monta's temperature can't really taste broth eating 10 minutes because just hot   However ramen just plain good both Hiramaru Monta shall eat no matter what!!! Lastly Hiramaru provides bigger menu therefore greater selection items grub on! prices tad bit more expensive  love food offer customers but also love simplicity Monta's menu    Overall Hiramaru good worthy! Haha  new still deserves learn grow just any new restaurant  Monta continue striving greatest through improvement service  <EOR> We way Ramen Sora saw sign thought nightclub well     The first thing impressed atmosphere  layout day night  room white brightly lit other dark    For lunch decided start gyoza fried chicken pork belly buns  all delicious  Although spiced gringo pallet     Our entrees both ramen  Shannon carbonara ramen yup Parmesan ramen egg yolk  black garlic noodles  Both good but good appetizers    Bottom line we'll definitely back  Probably more appetizers soup  <EOR> Very very happy service staff  soon walked greeted assume owner staff  Both genuinely happy restaurant  grander terms Las Vegas kind service hard find  white red interior along open kitchen leave little room any poor maintenance sloppy upkeep  Clean crisp nice change neighboring competitors  Las Vegas' edition China Town   The menu very normal size ramen restaurant but nice spin ingredients   if ramen clean restaurant doesn't great service pleasant staff appears some fine food coming superior service your place   Thanks staff made long day four six year old pleasant ending  <EOR> I really expecting place great  really fall short Ramen part   The noodles tasted pasta soup more italian   If love traditional Ramen your better off waiting line Monta   Oh if seafood ramen its just added powder no actual seafood used   They pricey get  <EOR> I've Ramen spots Hawaii Seattle very unique delicious  very attentive details perfect textures seasonings   just first bowl   excited try everything! <EOR> I heard new ramen place opened town friend checked last night   The restaurant fairly big probably biggest ramen place town  around 6 30p only party seated immediately food came real quick!  I ordered shiroi tonkotsu ramen which white pork based soup hint garlic  delicious! friend ordered tateyama ramen ramen full bean sprouts noodles thick filled she couldn't even finish it  But she said good!  Lots parking spots outside restaurant!  Came back second time time tried curry  good! little kick end each bite but  good  Sweet first but little spicy too! <EOR> Good ramen worthy obsession   Great ramen?   nearly orgasmic!  Poor ramen?   scorns taste buds  mercilessly ridiculing your incompetent decision   I started review thinking Hiromaru Fusion Ramen 2 5 3 star experience   as wrote recalled experience ended  feeling couldn't justify anything beyond 2 stars   I wasn't really fan all way around   two distinct dinning areas   bright clean   lots white   bright lights    accented strong vibrant red some natural wood   Did mention side bright?  Well is   pretty sure surgeons prefer less light during intricate operations   other side calm peacefully brought together muted browns blues like   lighting side pushes towards romantic feel would certainly try sit side if return   We tried Shiroi Tonkotsu Salted White Tonkotsu $7 95 signature fusion Carbonara Ramen $10 95   Neither ramen left wanting more   few distinct changes taken place based some early comments   Both noodles thin eggs executed well   Previous reviewers complained thick noodles   didn't those   I ahead complain thin noodles instead   bit more bite   isn't much tooth found overly thin noodles  Shiroi nice flavor front but lingered way didn't enjoy      wasn't even fan thin pork ramen while could put whole bowl down won't seeking anytime soon   Carbonara excited even less   didn't flavors texture broth   noodles same described previously only time nothing redeeming bowl   I didn't opportunity try any side dishes but probably won't unless hear something special since won't back ramen  <EOR> Not much variety   Some ramen dishes milk based very good   Nevertheless fried rice pork good  They dont serve beer wine   I did decour service friendly enough  <EOR> Maybe best kaarage town  fusion style ramen isn't typical but good  Gyoza great too  fried rice bit different but worth try well  <EOR> Based visit cant say fan place  Kuroi tonkotsu $8 95 odd mix tonkotsu ramen black garlic flavors fighting each other your attention  thin noodles dense somewhat gummy  place try shear novelty factor unique types ramen served but think prefer more traditional type ramen  If sit counter prepare bang your knees into ledge beneath counter  If try scoot  those seat heavy hard move  there's high chance hitting your knees more once  <EOR> I'm still 50 50 experience place      FOOD Hiromaru pork bun really good Salmon would say okay  Tate ramen was    Alright SERVICE The waitress very nice friendly     Overall nice experience place looks great! But kind warm inside  Please put AC lil cooler please <EOR> *This review based grand opening  sure back Hiromaru see if any changes review*  Saw Hiromaru opening location Vegas excited  gone Japanese festival tried ramen months ago  loved big news    I came grand opening greeted huge staff  all welcoming! interior pretty hip its red white decor    My boyfriend already knew carbonara ramen because tried festival  Carbonara ramen $10 95  Pretty pricey opinion  also chashu bowl almost $7  ordering given complimentary salads  salad refreshing dressing top    We chashu bowl first  chashu topped chopped greens sauce which don't know name all top rice  If you've monta nothing it  personally prefer fried chashu  pork seemed steamed because soft was  Don't wrong still tasted fine!   Now onto ramen  carbonara THICK noodles milky tonkatsu broth  comes bacon but switched chashu no charge  Lastly egg yolk your spoon it  broth thicker festival but still tasted great  If thinner it'd perfect  noodles huge  udon except harder  don't know feel noodles honest   The ramen tasted different japanese festival  kinda disappointing but ramen appetizing regardless  sure back try other ramen  <EOR> There some things life constant  the way ramen presented way ramen tastes but Hiromaru flips ramen its head takes new level   three things important ramen noodles broth taste   all know common ramen joints around cities deliver standard pork broth soy broth noodles topped egg few pieces meat mushrooms    Not Hiromaru   This restaurant new ramen experience fare such cabonara ramen black garlic tonkatsu ramen   menu short sweet   any great ramen place appetizers sides then main ramen dishes   Instead fifteen option Hiromaru 4  Shiroi which brown garlic oil broth Kuroi which black garlic oil broth Tate Yama which huge great pork fatty taste flat noodles Cabonara ramen which creamy ramen broth   We started few popular appetizers  pork bun karaage special fried rice   All them excellent   karaage arrived first   simple beautiful karaage gets   batter extremly light crispy did require any dipping sauce soy sauce   light squeeze lemon karaage perfect   also presented fried rice   I love playful food   break down rice mix egg everything together order eat   hot plate underneath fried rice stays nice hot all flavors pork salty egg sweet green onions divine   could eat whole order myself   The last appetizer arrive pork buns which different others sold around town   other apps minimalist food most beautiful tasty pork bun heaven mouth   Instead melty pork pieces other restaurants thick chewy but gorgeous every way   pork texture contrast soft sweet bun just heaven   slight crispy fresh note sauce greens something would come back time again   With appetizer round complete ramen arrived something unique eye am used to   black garlic oil provided dark tinge ramen broth which looked alien   began mix ramen milky pork broth became visible all flavors melded   noodles different Hiromasu   feel thinner but tastier more cling broth other ramen   milky black broth absolutely delicious   black garlic's smoky sweet flavor against pork broth umami amazing   sat face down bowl slurping sipping away quietly trying figure other flavors layered broth   every chopstick full noodles appreciated every ounce flavor within universe bowl   broth lovely made contemplate ramen filled life   drank every last drop leaving nothing but dry ramen bowl taken me     I sat quietly entire meal kindly paid check walked bit stunned excellent food place provides  Given service lacking but food worth return time again  Hiromasu brings more simple ramen city  you taste experience love beauty ramen should always be  <EOR> A ramen spot didn't quite hit spot   interesting group food critics  What's worse fear taking father places because reactions  would say place met expectations but fell short  still working opening feel could much better but first impressions everything   Service great can't complain really nice looking plAce looking forward izakaya side!

Good lighting selfie guess lol  FOOD Carbonara ramen didn't really thick noodle but may just personal preference  Enjoyed first two bites then regretted fact mixed egg yolk soup  Soup kind oily couldn't keep eating halfway  very unique but didn't anything it   Kuroi tonkotsu my mom ordered according little bitter  She enjoyed thin noodles   Tateyama ramen lots bean sprouts  dad ordered he liked broth  He didn't enjoyed thick noodles   STAFF I felt really uncomfortable because stood table watched eat O_O  When dad finished taking last bite lady quickly came took away bowl  He going enjoy broth but guess  part good service ? CONCLUSION Not coming back <EOR> There no doubt Hiromaru hottest new business anyone attended followed Aki Matsuri festival ramen ramen fans general  didn't attend festival but am aware Hiromaru presented very popular offering made known planning outpost Vegas  Fast forward half year tip friend finally ready open  couple issues over weekend pushed back opening just little but just thankful  lucky enough eaten three times now  welcomed soft opening #1 through expressing keen interest them in person phone subsequently soft opening #2 last night grand opening day today   I over items sound much story event review  deliberately waited until opening day post am judging mainly food quality service being work progress price food being non existent first two visits   House salad complimentary little bowl greens oil present every customer upon arrival  found some purple leaves little bitter but nice fresh start welcome  Hiromaru Buns butabara pork belly white bun some sort house made mayo  enjoyed it  told good Fat Choy which still haven't tried but very least competent offering  [UPDATE 3 12 tried Fat Choy's pork belly bao which utterly blows water but  mainly testament good Fat Choy is ]  Karaage your typical ball ish fried chicken slice lemon little lettuce  wasn't crunchy first day but second day  If karaage your thing try it   Hiromaru Japanese Curry rice typical yellow curry chashu pork belly  spicy  could myself enough  tastes fine but just wouldn't order knowing Japanese Curry Zen just down street   Shiroi Tonkotsu basic ramen chashu pork half hard boiled egg scallions kikurage mushrooms  tried first night wasn't impressed overall  sesame heavy broth really really threw loop  also didn't hard boiled egg stylistic choice vs  soft boiled but thought noodles decent maybe al dente chashu pork belly nice because meaty much more fatty  Maybe try again future but grade would Incomplete this   Carbonara Ramen want seeing you're going place fusion ramen its name  lot more carbonara pasta does typical ramen  thick noodles al dente egg lends nice flavor broth thick cut bacon while predominantly chewy completes experience  Couldn't taste sesame some reason was milk helpful? enjoyed shiso accented broth  Because fusion ramen would directly call better worse favorites Fukumimi Sora but mainly different   Kuroi Tonkotsu basically Shiroi plus black garlic oil  chose today because Carbonara Tate Yama supplies time whatever reason  am very glad tried because 1 now know shiroi flavor first night wasn't fluke 2 more accustomed sesame flavor enough enjoy ramen today  would still pick ramen over Fukumimi Sora but think would rank above Monta which really impressed late   This very promising ramen shop dedicated management team should know they're still ironing kinks first week  But if took ten minutes give check? can't hold against them point  Give them try some time see think! <EOR> My wife shopping Saturday custom looking new interesting lunch spot   She spotted Hiromaru Fusion Ramen said  it!    The simple yet colorful decor bright refreshing compared some ramen houses in   waitress quick bring drinks explain some menu items wife   I ordered TATE YAMA RAMEN which truly mountain vegetables sprouts delicious ramen   wife ordered TONKOTSU CURRY TSUKEMEN looked smelled delicious   Both dishes beautifully prepared presented   We only ramen dishes listed but saw many other interesting meals being served fellow diners   visit again try other menu items!  Highly recommend Hiromaru Fusion Ramen great meal little twist  <EOR> We first came place alternative Monta Ramen  ordered kuroi ramen garlic oil shiroi ramen  chashu pork belly tough but broths rich creamy  included egg  shiroi broth bit salty taste  Overall ramen okay  service efficient but seemed unenthusiastic  didn't even greeting door  worth giving another try future  <EOR> I black garlic sauce ramen carbonara  The black garlic awesome!! perfect taste! the carbonara taste pasta but ramen noodle extra sauce   I black garlic better would back this!  Dont forget check 50% off gyoza karage! <EOR> Cozy comfortable but whiteness place might shock begin with   The broth could use little more kick  <EOR> I loved decor! red white walls modern chairs other side room  playing old school music boyz II men n'snyc Tamia Usher etc  when which really liked because gives break all edm radio' music   I loved Gyoza deep fried boneless chicken crunchy outside very flavorful!  The ramen noodle OK  many different flavor mixed into bowl  Carbonara Ramen milky sweet salty    just unexplainable taste  Kuroi ramen said seafood broth but all salt overpowered everything else  <EOR> I ordered mentai mayo ramen fantastic! broth full massago gives creamy milky broth appealing flavor  waitress described ramen being slightly fishy would disagree quite enjoyable meal    Checking its perks top satisfying food  <EOR> Not your typical ramen place  nice change  various fusion ramen also izakaya menu night time  shrimp ramen really good  decor nice modern inside  <EOR> Located Cathay Hills plaza near Lindell Road signage easy spot  restaurant clean modern design  White red wood fixtures furniture  also second dining area booths beautiful lighting  definitely more spacious most ramen joints  Lots light very welcoming   I really looking forward trying Cabonara Tate Yama Ramen but weren't serving today the soft openings possibly depleted thick noodle supply   ordered only other two ramen choices available Shiroi Kuroi   Shiroi Tonkotsu $7 95 Pork broth salted sauce brown garlic oil served thin noodles topped chashu pork hard boiled egg fresh scallions kikurage  broth really nice creaminess almost milky  garlic oil surprisingly light  great depth flavor  noodles good pork wasn't fatty   Kuroi Tonkotsu $8 95 Completely identical Shiroi Tonkotsu except made ma yu black garlic oil instead brown garlic oil  flavors similar but black garlic bit more robust  Both broths both delicious own way   We also shared two side dishes Karaage $5 Hiromaru Special Fried Rice $6 50 made egg chashu pork scallions  Karaage light batter good flavor  loved squeeze fresh lemon chicken too  fried rice very tasty! chashu pork scallions flavored nicely   The service friendly surprised find Mr  Kawai kitchen since he six locations Toyama Japan  Anyway making way back next week try thick noodle ramens! <EOR> Place nice  Food service good  However every time ramen felt full but satisfy  whatever reason feel ramen menus missing something  Um        would still back but first option ramen place <EOR> 05 04 14 DINNER  So write first Yelp quite long time mostly due time constraints  Sheesh should even bother LAST Yelp review generated first ever hate mail via Yelp's compliment app! NICE! I'm gonna into deeply actually knowing probably will! but REALLY liked place lot  first Japanese chain's restaurants entire United States  Having dined feel privileged   And dining last minute decision  way elsewhere dear friend's Cinco de Mayo bar extravaganza but unfortunately parking lot completely full very beginning absolutely NO street parking miles gave that  Sorry C! Love man! It's fair review standard ramen itself didn't typical ramen but want return try compare other ramen places tried Vegas  HINT absolute FAVE ramen place remains Ramen Sora particularly miso ramen but haven't quite while  First off order Asahi draft under $4 order same beer edamame thrown same price! opted little extra  edamame OK nothing special no garlic coarse salt  But free complain! all 3 wanted beer lots edamame   Next if check in via Yelp purchase appetizer half off  party 3 but only 2 smartphones opted karaage gyoza    The karaage Japanese boneless fried chicken reason place didn't 5 stars very disappointing  threw purchased frozen nuggets fryer  worst thing world but greasy crispy never again    BUT THOSE GYOZA! WOW! could've ordered tons those! Wonderful!  Lastly spouse ordered same entree carbonara ramen  guess signature dish chain  literally lightly japanese take carbonara pasta Italy  rocked  heavy cream sauce most american restaurants mistakenly but light broth using same broth ramens cream added  waitress asked if wanted thick thin noodles opted choose she chose thick great this  Now dish loaded pork belly slices other ramens past but instead contains some chopped pork belly fat which similar pancetta you'd if ordered Italy  $10 95 great deal said terrific  Best carbonara ANYWHERE quite long time  Oh long day visiting barely english speaking Claudio home made pasta carbonara made apt Sherman Oaks CA!
