First time definitely returning   Ramiro server did brilliant job <EOR> This your grandmother's Denny's    fact COOLEST Denny's ever visited life    They full bar    I guess anything possible Vegas    Sit outdoor tables right middle downtown Vegas   which unlike Strip cool unique way   I love it! <EOR> Denny's quel merveilleux souvenir gustatif !  Nous avions débarqué à deux vers 22h avec une envie de burger pour ma part et de salade pour la part de ma maman   Après avoir attendu 2 3 Minutes nous avons été installé et les festivités ont pu avoir lieu    Personnel très compétent attentionné et naturellement gentil  Après avoir dégusté nos limonades en attendant nos plats environ une dizaine de Minutes nous nous sommes régalés !   J'ai mangé mon meilleur burger aux USA chez eux   J'ai pris le SlamBurger et ce fut un réel délice !!!  Gros burger servi avec des frites maison un régale !!!   Quand à la salade qu'à prit ma mère celle ci était très imposante et très bonne !   Que du positif pour ce repas cette chaîne et son personnel au petit soin !  Et pour finir ceci n'est pas très cher !   Je recommande à 100% !!!!! <EOR> I'm exactly sure when location first opened but some co workers recently headed over check Denny's Neonopolis  reality big fan Denny's but thought it'd fun kitschy   The Good  It nicest cleanest Denny's ever in  full bar which seems interesting Denny's but then again Fremont Street sense  can't comment bar because lunch during work week  'Nuff said  The restaurant photo booth  Vegas themed NEAT kind where there's outline your head stand take picture you'll come Elvis hair whatnot  But camera kinda high if you're scrimp 5' 1 shorter camera high  Sadly head didn't reach outline no stool anything that   We all french toast special which cheap $6 7 decent or least french toast was sausage        well won't talk that   waitress told they're opening wedding chapel or already did celebrity wedding already lined February  At least we're already Vegas betting purposes  The Bad  My group seated booth adjacent another booth some artsy geometric bars separator head up  paying bill another co worker turned around booth noticed dude's head literally peering over shoulders through bars  Apparently he looking see if done food  Kinda caught off guard bit      The Ugly  It's still Denny's food  Okay decent but great any means  general group consensus Denny's place end up   Overall  So why four stars? Location location location! Denny's Fremont worth checking reason alone  Also restaurant outside patio which fun spot people watch summertime offers uncommon Denny's menu items flatbread  <EOR> First off love Dennys 4th visit gotten bad food before but cooks bad days but 4 times  The eggs under cooked pancakes tasted old dry rest plate puddle grease I think only thing good toast coffee  All other Dennys good food good service think its time new cooks new servers cause keep dennys name wont save place <EOR> Nov 23 2015_9 am denny's amazing staff friendly food great waiter great he kept checking sure food liking coffee cup always full  also first time seen full bar denny's  <EOR> Raw pancakes onions eggs having move another table because am under 21 seater wasn't bright enough catch when walked in  great way start vacation    <EOR> Worst Dennys southwest! food smothered grease pancakes left over char past cooked food!

Worth drive <EOR> Denny's always drunken guilty pleasure  There's just something greasy diner food hits spot location Fremont Street perfect!  I stumbled upon Denny's while looking spot grab late night bite eat immediately sold  asked order to go told hostess 15 minutes before needed back limo ride back Strip  She assured she would tell kitchen put rush order sure enough ready plenty time    As looking menu noticed infamous seasoned fries missing  Instead choice regular fries sweet potato fries  But asked hostess she confirmed kitchen still carry seasoned fries  sure why they're listed menu but really hope Denny's never gets rid them  favorite!   The seasoned fries paired perfectly bacon less Super Bird hostess even threw two containers ranch score!   Super Bird tasted incredible busy trying recreate home lunch all week  Definitely favorite sandwiches! <EOR> I wanted alcoholic drink only Denny's know bar  waited service 15 minutes  single waitress acknowledged all  busy  understand more tips group people ordering food but would think if want more business would least say hi may help everyone walks into your restaurant  don't Denny's food any location definitely don't recommend location anything  <EOR> BUY MIMOSAS MUST!  usually sit bar since pretty packed house  Servers bar including lady manager think name Janet Jessica super amazing !

HA   Finally nicer hostess points says listed name  right? And other RUDE WOMAN to put nicely NERVE say paying customers Lets ready five minutes ago!    walks table slams down silverware doesn't say another word walks away   Like excuse effing kidding me?! If hadn't friends trying good time could [explicative]'s job handed because took lot self restraint say anything   Because fact stepped right outside door because crowded called right away giving wrong time fault don't your s%?# together?!  This first impression management Denny's corporation wants customer see huh?  I never expect exceptional service Denny's  But just crossing line left such bad taste mouth sitting even contemplating calling someone [explicative]  can't honestly expect give customers attitude keep your job    absolutely ridiculous  If don't working then hell out   just way goes   That all being said server great  She kind attentive could genuinely tell she cared job  If could give zero stars I'd still give star nice server  Unfortunately couldn't really enjoy meal experience doomed go food just mediocre  feel sorry those work actually care work such trashy people abound according many prior reviews   One nail time build coffin ultimately dooming Denny's location  <EOR> This Denny's beautiful lol love decor there's just something it    Came 10pm father both ordered steak medium rare OH GOD  definitely best steak both ever had  believe lol! fatty all! very decent size price!
