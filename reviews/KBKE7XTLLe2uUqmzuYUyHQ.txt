Seafood options limited re heated bulk store offerings  calling order manager taking order put hold several minutes just answer question where clams originated   The website specifies delivery North Las Vegas only despite restaurant being located Centennial  Phoning back address issues directly manager duty July 2 2014 treated disrespectfully hung on  Very poor experience  <EOR> Horrible descent service   Margaritas pizza simply cheese pizza dried oregano spaghetti bland   only thing enjoyed Pinot <EOR> Pretty disappointing  only people restaurant save food still made correctly listed done blandly  <EOR> So place work tried ordering large order staff appreciation day  guy phone told special  large 1 topping 11 bucks  Once ordered he gave total didn't equal thought  According place cheese counts topping there  Then when retold special he gave he extremely rude over phone  Saying he told cheese counts topping  world does cheese count topping?? He proceeded angry treat stupid  Don't order here  <EOR> I absolutely LOVE place  I work dealership close always very friendly  my coworkers live off lunch menu portions huge  I yet try something menu does taste fabulous  <EOR> Everything menu looked delicious!! Although very picky eater pescetarian  asked servers recommendation  He ordered Linguini Pescatore Chicken Fingers fries son  son doesn't drink soda server Ryan whipped most delicious lemonade son ever had  His words exactly 4 glasses later believed him! food prompt most amazing quite while!! even snagged few fries son good!! don't even fries!!

Verdi far favorite restaurant!  never disappointed food service!  chefs also owner clear she cares she does!  EVERTHING MENU OUTSTANDING!!!  Chicken beef fish pasta pizza   I've tried all keep coming back more!  prices more reasonable well!  Oh bread   you hard pressed find bread Verdi has!  Bottom line Italy place good better anything there!  place should packed people but not   so service very personal! <EOR> So     grabbing free sandwich Capriottis but mood chicken fingers fries     good ones   Verdi right next door   walked in   looked through menu noticed fingers $9 five fingers including fries     which good bit more anywhere else especially without fries   hostess let know cannot sit inside eat unless purchase minimum $10 per person     which itself ridiculous   puts minimum order dine in?  Apparently only place   also noticed dine in menu 10 cheese pizza $9 but same pizza $6 go   lady said They're good all white meat  don't know any place isn't all white meat     walked out       But wasn't over   sat car moment decided while may well fingers because now driving someplace else would waste time gas   back in     hoping fingers good   told lady joking manner decided give them try fingers better good!  She told two people dining room only two regulars chicken fingers garlic fries   decided give shot   $9 fingers   $3 50 garlic fries   $6 to go pizza friend   While chat two regulars see food friend heard hostess say attitude God they're just fingers fries  Yeah   are   Fingers fries want pay $12 50 for   no    they're just fingers fries when charge more anybody city them  She also caught saying Well they're better McDonald's  would freaking hope so!!!!  You're kidding right now!!!  She gives receipt sign   places x next tip line total line   If think they're getting tips when forcing take another thing coming   So food eat outside since ordered pizza off menu     $6 instead $9    making impossible dine in   Even though spent $20 2 people   If wanted pizza would immediately $3 more just sit restaurant   The fingers   five   Two them tiny wanna be fingers   little bigger only two good sized   while tasted decently identical other fingers elsewhere Metro Pizza Winchell's charge much less serve them fries veggies instead having buy order fries side  Metro pizza $10 tax same fingers fries veggies extra ranch    Winchell's $7 99 chicken fingers  six them  with veggies  and $1 extra AMAZING fries    didn't warrant pay $9 them   fries    call garlic fries   butt ton those fries terrible crispy orange seasoning them like curly fries texture terrible    maybe small sprinkle garlic them   MAYBE clove over entire to go box stuffed fries   Hardly garlic fries   great   If going call something garlic fries EVERY FRY should garlic taste   ten fries hundred   should tossed olive oil covered roasted garlic    The pizza eh   sauce evenly distributed friend said only piece actually good   So     because ridiculousness place     won't going back   If want completely over pay food bad McDonald's but much better     where want eat  <EOR> This restaurant gem   salmon medium rare   done perfectly   white balsamic vinaigrette salad delightful   best fingerling potatoes prices steal! <EOR> Amazing place family dinner wine girlfriends! restaurant very homey feel it  food AMAZING CREAMY JUICY deliciousness   Yup comes mind when hear Verdi because pasta flavorful amazing  might see owner sometimes shes also cooks very pretty hardworking  When read some bad reviews just wanted tell them    guys seem just having bad day  lol prices good you? Then don't duh!  Anyway would definitely LOT  because all juicy flavorful party happens mouth worth every penny! <EOR> Went daughter since Bambini's closed   thought food delicious service target   build your own pasta dinner very happy it   All ingredients fresh full Italian goodness   daughter homemade lasagna just way she liked lots cheese meat   Anyway price convenience would definitely recommend visit  <EOR> So try keep short sweet  coworkers decided try place flyer left door  ordered some Caesar salad lunch specials as watching delicate figures food AWESOME! delivery took no time all    So you're probably wondering why am only giving them star  due events followed first visit   The next time ordered them took almost hour food told hook driver fat tip  Ummm    excuse ??  Sad say because said delivery driver did receive said fat tip  vowing would never EVER back again really hungry restaurants walking distance just weren't satisfying enough particular moment  broke vow decided give guys more shot  Instead getting delivered decided drive around corner pick up  Granted should called then gone picked but two hungry hormonal women cant always wits end  walk hardly expected  completely empty rather large dining area very comfortable black leather couch  woman took order quite attitude just gave off really nasty vibe  waited twenty minutes food then graciously walked those doors surely last time    As walking back car noticed capriotti's next door price just paid lunch should just gone gotten sandwiches sure going good    This place very good its beginning sadly gone down hill aspects good food fabulous service  would recommend anyone waste time money here  <EOR> First good   Verdi some best New York style pizza ever tasted and New York   pizza well balanced ingredients cheese sauce dough all delicious  really really good   Now good   almost every time place order place some issue  time ordered two cheese pies  When them home realized pepperoni it   Another time specifically asked them sprinkle oregano garnish pie my young son doesn't it when oregano sprinkled causing wait 15 minutes them new one    Two weeks ago ordered cheese pie told would ready 20 minutes  When 20 minutes later wait another 15 minutes   I don't know kind math use but every time order pizza total order differs  tell price phone slightly higher slightly lower when there  very strange kind running joke family   guessing actual total be   Related math issue   one time total came $18 64  gave guy $20 bill he gave $1 25 back  didn't mention 11 cents he owed because only 11 cents but kind surprised he didn't realize math off didn't think 11 cents big deal   One time dined dining room service incredibly slow and only customers   only thing saved experience food  delicious always   The staff most part friendly courteous  mean well always willing fix any errors part  don't know if understaffed what  incredibly delicious food serve could easily highly desirable eatery   So Verdi kind mixed bag  food AWESOME but expect some frustration leading eating it   I'm always vowing never order food them again but always back   LOL least prices reasonable   if don't factor frustration  <EOR>
