Let start saying HATE complaining   definitely don't writing bad review   Think Yelp should people wanting find GOOD places praise locations employees   But also seeing which locations should avoided if possible   those reviews   I usually own food home but occasionally husband just grab take once while   love Wendy's chili chicken sandwich baked potato quick easy late night bite   star Wendy's   location   Specifically later night     We given location several chances each time disappointed   take out line takes forever   people hard deal rude sometimes   food come cold even when claim take extra five minutes item   run potatoes quite often   Twice when chili cup watery beans large chunks hamburger patty!!!!  couldn't eat it  The dog quite pleased  used ask cheese chili which charge which understand but only put small pinch   really worth it   Maybe wine talking but really think people should know take line should avoided late night   Even though Wendy's sounds delicious sometimes might worth travel little further next location   doing now on   Wendy's enjoy your food pinch but location needs some attention   just I know am just old fogie should asleep late night shouldn't affect but everyone needs Wendy's late night  <EOR> We came pretty early really any other people around  burger cold  wrapped into aluminum wrappings keep food warm guess burger lying around lonely already while  let husband taste just sure am overrating temperature he said same thing burger cold  Won't come back sorry sorry <EOR> One worst if worst Wendy's  First filled endless trashy people all time located such crappy area  would surprised if crimes take place near all time  normal working professionals during lunch hours but  it  Even employees act same seemingly never stop act trashy smoking near entrances where customers out  Food okay but  it  Yuck! <EOR> Worst Wendy's ever being close strip Wendy's sucks ass wait fresh fries once order fried soaked oil burger far beyond well done  Discussing never going back even bother complain if whole store!!

Service other hand  vary depending time visit particular location    When off normal Vegas shift roughly 11 1130 pm mood Wendy's service standard no waiting time no rude service etc  late graveyard shift workers exceptional job  Around midnight friend ordered medium lemonade drink small soda drink  Instead guy took order ended accommodating two medium sized drinks charged medium small  I think he hitting friend but knows? Now days morning exercise near brunch hour gone Wendy's particular location gotten opposite service! staff during shift tend talk more gossip among themselves front customers which witnessed seeing orders mistaken due miscommunication end which included mine  don't know many times hear disgruntled employee murmur under breath walking by  understand minimum wage job but front customers? Really? don't know many times hear same employees gossip another front ordering confuse order!
