Totally worth money  <EOR> Nice surprise Pretty good food knowledgeable waiters  Started salami anti pasto overall pretty good rubbery ! lost crap over followed quail a little over cooked best described paillard two very thin filets very tasty massive serving mushroom side which excellent   4 stars mainly because conference town row row 10 seater tables pack 'em in  VERY loud nothing soft walls all   Oh also lunch spaghetti frutti di mare excellent lot quieter  <EOR> The food good but excellent  flavors original  service good but exceptional  decor amazing  Tried place twice but still prefer Julien Serrano Spanish tapas original namesake restaurant   Food 40 50 Service 20 30 Décor 18 20  Total 78 100 <EOR> We staying Bellagio just wanted eat somewhere decent lunch came across Lago  reviews photos looked pretty good through Yelp made appointment really quickly the morning maybe hour earlier lunch   The decor appealing for but couldn't judge much most Vegas restaurants same caliber design  great thing gave seats along windows which overlooks Bellagio's famous fountain  restaurant full all customers least some kind view water show!  The customer service good nothing bad nor absolutely amazing  But food just okay nothing really delicious  Agnolotti di Vitello veal ricotta stuffing Ravioli al Gamberi shrimp both mediocre  agnolotti least interesting but didn't really fancy taste much though eating dark sauce definitely helped  ravioli really just underwhelming simple tomato sauce just super basic tomato sauce bland didn't much character taste   All all just okay restaurant everything's overpriced Vegas necessarily looking down pasta prices because just bit over average we'd pay LA agnolotti being $17 ravioli being $18    The customers next pizza looked pretty good though pizza tough mess up! <EOR> My wife ate anniversary before seeing Cirque du Soleil O Bellagio  Great food patio overlooking Bellagio fountains    Lago serves small plates sharing think Spanish tapas except Italian  some main course meals which may sense if eating alone but part great appeal Lago wife being able order selection wonderfully prepared dishes without stuffing ourselves    When made reservation asked patio seat  turned coldest days Las Vegas  asked hostess if should sit inside near windows instead she said heated patio suggested take look first  Glad did  heaters comfortable  Some other folks light coats but just come Minneapolis perhaps tolerance cool weather higher I highly recommend sitting patio  Being able watch fountain eat really adds experience  Actually would only want sit patio next large windows overlooking fountains  early reservation no issues having seating requests accommodated though also request when making reservation     The seating front part restaurant might okay if kids but would avoid any more intimate dinners  <EOR> Amazing restaurant best strip if say myself  Small plates but flavor well emphasized every bite <EOR> I Lago weekend brunch amazing!! <EOR> Brought wife B Day dinner she loved it   First request table window patio see Water Show   amazing view since celebrating birthday gave wife cannolis house   food very good both cheese salami platter two tapas   bill under $100 keep mind didn't drink any alcohol  <EOR> Dear Chef Serrano Congratulations thank contributed Las Vegas countless food lovers   Your dishes continues true form   Based time proven classic cuisine delivered flair   On behalf all those trained during years say well   My meal spectacular   service

extremely disappointing   served family style servers did even give serving implements   food mediocre best   return  <EOR> Amazing all aspects food decor service    fruits infused Wasabi awesome <EOR> While trying reservation another Bellaggio restaurant person spoke recommended one   made reservation because time fit into show seeing     When arrived restaurant said couldn't seat table view fountains another 90 minutes restaurant really bright inside   said would try somewhere else   back confirm something time magically able seat table view   REALLY irritating   However must say wait bus staff excellent   plenty people around server particularly visible helpful available   Because tapas restaurant KEY   Some highlights were Crostini chicekn liver  Scallops orange pistachio meatballs Risotto tripe mushrooms I never tripe before but good dish The crostini salami gorgonzola just ok baramundi Presentation lacking almost all dishes but still working kinks   All all would back again would recommend give try  <EOR> It pricy side but food cocktails disappoint  Kobe Beef asparagus potatoes delicious  Every bite perfectly seasoned  would reservations since place gets busy weekends  cocktails unique strong would recommend trying ones aligned liquor accustomed because strong  note nothing wrong strong drinks personally prefer them way  great experience eating hear when stay Bellagio again definitely making reservation  <EOR> This such terrific dining experience  wait might long if just walk but worth it  service prompt attentive  view fountains nice bonus but star show food  Everything expertly cooked perfectly seasoned just right temperature    The little 4 oz filet divine  duck artichoke crab branzino tuna crudo also favorites  <EOR> We dinner service Christmas day disappointment  reason 2 stars way manager handled things food deserves 0 stars restaurant NEEDS new chef urgently  ordered 2 margherita pizzas $15 each RAVIOLI AI GAMBERI RISOTTO AL VINO ROSSO LINGUINE AL PESTO CANNELLONI  First pizza less 8 super skinny flavorless Celeste's frozen pizzas more flavor  canneloni supposed PULLED short ribs received disgusting dark paste inside two cannelonis flavorless definitely fresh  linguine extra hard no flavor ravioli tasted COSTCO frozen shrimp ravioli  Honestly nothing worth price they're asking for  There's no creativity plates  best thing environment  it  We complaint returned dishes spoke manager  She covered only two things eaten which pizza kids  Honestly upscale restaurant Las Vegas dinner service should made impress total disappointment  <EOR> Just don't   staff rude menu did deliver over priced   many other better places eat Vegas waste your time energy here   Stop cocktail drink design beautiful spot   bartenders professional kind   But eat elsewhere anywhere elsewhere  <EOR> We stumbled accident  Everything ordered amazing  sat bar bartender very attentive us  food absolutely delicious  pizza awesome fussili lamb ragu amazing osso bucco the meat incredibly tender full flavor   husband nearly licking plates  <EOR> One only places open lunch bellagio  Food good but service really slow  would recommend getting ahi tuna crudo charcuterie plate  <EOR> Wonderful creative Italian small plates beautifully presented  staff charming gracious  drinks imaginative  decor atmosphere lovely  beautiful view fountains outside  prices bad Vegas  Kobe beef which terrific some chopped liver toast  food came olive bread some mouth watering basil infused olive oil balsamic vinegar olive oil  great place eat share small plates  <EOR> I don't understand many good reviews restaurant  actually would give 4 stars patio location  nice view overlooking fountain  But food extremely disappointing  crostini chicken liver  overly salty didn't lot taste  also shared salmone which actually ok but also very little taste which means salmon wasn't great first place  Quality salmon should melt your mouth rich flavor  Next tasted gnocchi lobster then shrimp stuffed squid  gnocchi appeared cooked then broiled which know done but shouldn't be  tasted cooked gnocchi earlier day then reheated bit crunch   Good gnocchi should light tasty  chewy  lobster tasted nothing  shrimp stuffed squid worst dish evening  squid super chewy eating rubber band  Very unpleasant  dish also very little flavor  If use good food then elsewhere  If Olive Garden then probably ok eating here  <EOR> Great atmosphere beautiful interior design colors  Food cocktails spectacular  Love small plate concept which try different dishes  definitely come back again recommend Lago friends  <EOR> Had great dinner last night! pork ribs chicken pate crostini highlights  tried few other dishes folks recommended 7x7 Caesar salad

 As food best dish Grilled Octopus squid ink couscous  Definitely masterpiece char griled tender octopus savory briny couscous gave both black lipgloss but totally worth it   7x7 7 gnocchi 7 lobster knuckles also good nice buttery broth   The other two dishes mediocre   Chittara clams cooked al dente but seemed tad salty side   Branzino nice flavor seasoning tomatoes but fish itself bit under seasoned     Our waitress very nice but she forgot crab farro salad then didn't give pen when asked check   busboys great refilling waters clearing plates probably deserve best praise respect service   The manager did discount bill which honorable welcome gesture   Still fierce competition Vegas restaurants its doubtful return  <EOR> We came friends special occasion dinner  arrived 6 15 7 PM reservation requesting patio window table  called 6 40 window table available  No patio table would open another hour  took window table  Ambiance decorating dramatic say least  moment pass hostess stand until reach floor ceiling glass wall facing fountains each area restaurant striking  Definitely 5 stars ambiance except noise level  Some people high energy high noise dining experience  me  Food server recommended 3 4 small plates per person  opted two small plates main course per couple  Good choice  Way more enough food  started pizza fusillioro mushrooms 7 7 appetizers  pizza excellent despite fact served just slightly warmer room temperature  Fusillioro corkscrew pasta dish lamb ragu spuma di ricotta  favorite dish night! 7 7 potato gnocchi lobster knuckles  Another excellent dish  mushroom dish only disappointment night  Bland flavorless  main course chose Pesce Intero  whole boneless white fish served generous portion vegetables  really outstanding dish very high presentation quality  Yumm! Service only major disappointment evening  server table fairly quickly  But then disappeared long stretches  asked pizza served first  Instead all 4 appetizers appeared once considering pizza just room temperature suspect ready much earlier   all 4 appetizers being presented once fairly small table became very crowded hard navigate  water glasses spent most evening near empty  just tackle passing busboy them refilled once  sat empty rest night that  Value presentation taste food really memorable but noise level mediocre service worth $75 head cost  coming back  <EOR> Lago definitely solid choice anyone coming Vegas staying Bellagio   View fantastic food really good   wish could give 4 5 stars just 4 but pricing little high opinion but guess chalk just being Vegas   Service always decent but gripe servers seem always pushing order more rather asking   Guess nit picking bit but little things differentiate opinion 5 star establishment   Still would suggest people stop always satisfied here! <EOR> Lago chic restaurant space modern decor some excellent view seating but wait time overall arrogant service disappointing which explains star review    I called ahead made reservation 24 hours advance birthday celebration dinner  Based open table plenty reservation times available during peak off peak dinner hours Friday night  also advertised open table restaurant good large groups celebrations    When called concierge book appointment he asked many questions such any specific dietary restrictions celebrating anything would seat view fountain etc  mentioned yes vegetarian celebrating birthday yes would love view fountain  concierge stated vegetarian options he would note celebrating birthday should arrive 15minutes before reservation time seat view fountain  Making reservation painless based all Q felt Lago would enjoyable experience   Our entire party arrived restaurant 8 45pm 9pm reservation  actually wait maitre d stand several groups front time checked 8 55pm  believe owner host night based yelp pictures restaurant owner  He welcoming all he women staff around did smile acknowledge greeting  most uncomfortable standoffish restaurant check ever experienced    The host owner mentioned could seated immediately wait 20minutes seat view  agreed wait view seating since would part dining experience Lago  He said ok you're checked but did give any information would contacted  ask know when table ready? He mentioned he would let know should stay around area  Most restaurants kind traffic updated technology give beeper text when your table ready  might something restaurant take into consideration since popular foodie destination   There no waiting area sat slot machine chair directly front maitre d stand candid view host  9 15pm friends restless annoyed waiting table even advanced reservation  approached maitre d stand host owner very nonchalant demeanor stated oh your table ready your entire party here? Wow!! sitting directly front maitre d stand 15minutes he never bothered inform table ready  led table great view lago fountain show but probably even table set party 9  Another party must tired waiting left before getting seated   The food hit miss some vegetarian dishes tasty executed well but bistecca tough chewy good quality piece meat high end restaurant  also ordered lobster gnocchi based all positive reviews but didn't impress    Consistent service host owner server aloof unwelcoming  birthday celebration put candle dessert ordered off menu pay for  execution dessert presentation untimely unorganized didn't even ask birthday brought lit dessert placed front friend ordered birthday person actually restroom time    If you're willing overlook awful service wait time hit miss food may enjoy view decor restaurant  consistently disappointing never dine again even free M life rewards  <EOR> We brunch here  food did justify price  duck polenta which server recommended over other choice  really salty should returned it  overly rich  2nd course chose eggplant benedict  really didn't much flavor eggplant soggy even though fried ask marinara sauce taste better  would absolutely come again!! WOULD recommend little patisserie place Bellagio where yummy nutella crepes hit spot  They also savory crepes just didn't try them <EOR> The review can't wait until leave  5 stars simply won't cut it  just best steak life  Service impeccable tailored needs  booked 30 min advance but able fountain view table  Come if enjoy excellent food atmosphere service! <EOR> If going Vegas want nice Italian dinner almost no children then place go! Since located Bellagio hotel set overlook water show great view Paris Eiffel Tower  pesto fantastic! Caprese appetizer also tasty but little much Basil dish  portions small but shareable wine selection only semi diverse  waiters good knowledge wine drink pairings if overwhelmed drinks menu  Overall nice experience stunning view! <EOR> The view enjoy LAGO very beautiful  Usually show every 10 minutes?so see lease 3 show  Better window seat?The food good too  <EOR> I enjoyed unique view ambiance Lago Saturday night but found few vegetarian options choose from  margarita pizza which bit over done  claim tapas style but friend own meals  noted friend's birthday coming server kind enough bring desert house  Overall service good    I would return but likely food just drinks  conveniently next Hyde if plan your way promoters refuse leave alone way Lago  <EOR> Ordered salmon salad $18 fairly small plate but delicious   Ordered garlic bread $5 but more 4 skinny flat pieces toast    Beautiful view great service  Beer $9 glass   Pretty pricey lunch <EOR> Great service great food great ambiance! place great way end trip thanks Lagos great time  server also phenomenal <EOR> Very disappointed restaurant   Service mediocre but  acceptable given short time open  However food especially price extremely underwhelming  Portions tiny even tapas  discussing restaurant Bellagio staff said heard similar feedback   surprised reviews  mostly positive  Desert enjoyable best part meal   Note servers $15 $20 cocktail don't come grab patrons' drinks without asking  unfinished drinks grabbed without asking if done  <EOR> Arrived hour early asked if could accommodate early let right gave best seat house gave amazing view water show!!

timing food delivery off no plates long periods times then everything once  end meal felt rushed them turning off music putting lights bright taking bill table while still finishing rude!

Ultimately would ordered more food drinks throughout meal if service faster but sick waiting  <EOR> Lago most romantic restaurants to  Both food environment exceeded expectations  came lunch sit next large glass window which faces water fountain front bellagio  able watch 2 water shows which great because didn't watch outside Las Vegas heat  interior restaurant modern clean    Lago serves Italian tapa dishes  usually order few dishes share your table  Everything ordered something unique which haven't tried before  4 dishes boyfriend which more enough  ended having leftovers   I think great place if you're celebrating any special occasion anniversaries birthdays  <EOR> I came Lago during birthday weekend 10 other guests  Right off bat open refreshing atmosphere really experience environment wonderful socializing being happy! Lago located Bellagio sits center overlooking large pond water show outside clear view strip  Similar its Spanish sister restaurant Julian Serrano which ate night before Lago serves small plates few options larger individual portions   Wether large small group small plates really way go  only try maximum amount food but food comes all different times throughout night really facilitates social eating experience   Because pure amount food ordered try everything but ill give run down did try     Baked Ricotta balsamic rocket probably most disappointing dish night  ricotta bland tiny amount balsamic really didn't liven up  hoping would some sort burrata menu but don't    $9 Bruschetta pretty basic nothing extraordinary but solid btw come two plate but doubled which why photo 4 $7 Margherita Zucchine pizzas small individual sized pizzas come 4 slices piece  Best part crust great fluffy texture prepared well $14 $11 Insalate Sarda guess play caprese     white red green tomatoes stacked cucumbers topped again kinda bland ricotta cheese  refreshing dish nothing crazy flavor but good  $14 Gnocchi Alla Romana I'd say favorite dish night soft pillowy gnocchi topped gorgonzola creme sauce  menu little deterring because says topped blue cheese instead gorgonzola  easy tell good gnocchi bad stuff good $14 Paccheri Al Telefono essentially lasagna  sure why name telephone refrence but hey pretty darn good simple lasagna $15 Polletto half roasted chicken  bed roasted eggplant  larger plates prepared well chicken juicy flavorful $28 Costa Di Manzo braised short ribs fall apart tender great reduction sauce highly reccomend! $19 Cucumber Mist Cocktail good refreshing fruity vodka drink plus comes some fresh cucumber blueberries feel healthy $17 more dishes table much full try but overall great dining experience here  even brought birthday dessert!

I Lago least 10 times throughout years staying Bellagio enjoyed dining quick meal date night BF   While Lago primarily Italian restaurant Chef Julian Serrano's creative twist iconic Italian dishes surprise u   Over years tried numerous dishes Lago instead trying squeeze every single dish into review review 2 favorites Lasagna  4 5 stars    I love lasagna!!  Since kid meal asked everyday! Garfield hero because he enjoy lasagna all time!!  On recent stay Bellagio friends joined Sunday Brunch Lago   The first thing saw Lasagna!!  Not having any clue twist Chef Serrano would give classic dish just blindly ordered prayed best!  What stunning colorful dish which didn't look terribly familiar me   When found poached eggs served lasagna started regret decision    until took bite into lasagna   This where looks deceiving apropos!!  This lasagna best had   Why?! Because spinach lasagna light cooked al dente savory meat sauce  poached eggs richness classiness dish didn't expect!!??  The outer crust creates nice textural difference help contrast creamy silky lasagna   Wow blown away simplicity but depth flavors!! Extremely light but just good original!!  There's very little cheese dish but didn't even miss it!  The only thing wish could some type familiar protein i e  shrimp sausage    But truly respect Chef Serrano's genius still say LOVED lasagna!!  I'll definitely order again   Antipasto Misto  4 stars    WARNING NONE OLIVES PITTED!!!  I absolutely adore olives cured meats!!  Who cares may take 5 10 years off life?! rather live happy then miserable   Having said appetizer spectacular    well exception   The cracker served appetizer EXTREMELY THIN  While isn't bad thing itself barely holds weight piece cured meat let alone cheese olives   When try spread cheese cracker completely falls apart then poor olive rolls off plate onto floor  lost many poor olive tragic demise     Very aggravating heartbreaking someone ADORES flavors dish!!!  Perhaps uneducated simpleton self doesn't know construct dish any better but still worth aggravation perfect bite BF devour   Note appetizer very messy construct  bell peppers oils cheese very slippery virtually impossible put together fork given  don't allow BF touch dish construct everything  Aren't just sweet!? *Angelic smile*   I'm foodie  true meaning foodie person gourmet connoisseur!! just love food except fast food !!

Because look underage? because dining myself? gave them benefit doubt since bar seating open seating  Fine  5 minutes later another woman walked definitely more mature looking was  She definitely greeted same host  host walked bar seat actually pulled chair her  scramble pull chair far enough climb myself able pull in  Nice way discriminate Mr  host  Furthermore saw some guys printed t shirts still treated better me  what's great dining alone? drafting review happens  Any check ins anyone?

We stuck traditional favorites entrees lasagna not sure every night pappardelle did disappoint   Both filling could really taste fresh pasta was   would recommend if going multi course meal because even all food still room try gelato maybe extra martini two    Overall beautiful atmosphere view Fountains probably enough back Lago again it truly most romantic restaurants awhile Vegas! but fact food fresh delicious want recommend restaurant others new favorites Vegas   Cheers! <EOR> Good yummy!!! scallop pistachio salmon duck Pesto linguine   View fountain isn't perfect there's tall enough rail front windows can't see most water light show effect  without music accompanying show definitely don't effect close intended  But good awesome  <EOR> Came anniversary dinner amazing experience! sat outside patio right water we're able watch big fountain show while ate  Super nice  some shrimp appetizer world  mushroom risotto meal loved it  even free dessert anniversary!

Everything ate outstanding  am sure why people complaining food     cook yourself would ask? Where eating getting type food cheaper $38 person? side bacon Chicago $5  yea     sure why anyone would complaining  also $28 bottomless mimosas which also works Bellini's Bloody's  Most places let cross order between drink types if bottomless deal going impressed could order all three drink types or more! $28 price  Personally think also great deal especially Vegas where spent $19 cranberry vodka Encore Beach Club  FANCIEST mimosa ever seen  gold dusted raspberry it! wasn't short booze all!

Twice other tables opened but when requested move waiter would respond taken    how taken supposedly can't reservation outside? Food weird trying hard unique but doesn't even taste good! know tapas meant share but literally pizza smaller kids personal pizza! When order food immediately comes if all prepared felt tho being rushed through entire dinner when trying enjoy anniversary dinner! Waiter friendly no help when asked questions things menu! Only thing place going them view fountains lucky enough decent seat   not little corner table! Plenty better dining choices vegas don't bother coming here! <EOR> Great location  View Bellagio fountain great if table near window    I surprised easy reservation  Read find why      As most Vegas establishments none staff seemed very interested being there  No genuine smiles  hostess could care less  waiter rude  asked pic he turned down time promised before left  He never offered remind when check came  But time dark restaurant crowded didn't good picture  Sad since town celebrate big milestone birthday which waiter aware of   As food only 3 5 dishes good  Don't bother oysters Washington State really muddy tasteless seafood  Stick pasta dishes  Veal gnocchi delicious  also brought drinks late   after done second dish  Someone else also mentioned pushed food them pretty fast  they're trying rush outta there   Was meal experience worth $200? Big fat no  won't going back  <EOR> We locals sat bar Regina server host  Food yummie  Came 2 nights row because impressed wanted try items eaten night prior  Can't wait try more! <EOR> I brought girl friend birthday great view just right window where see fountain   We ordered yummy passion fruit mojito cocktails came real passion fruit  Great drink  more entree! ordered short rib entree seafood risotto  portions very small if came light dinner before night perfect spot that  also ordered two desserts which pretty big portions very delicious  <EOR> When friend saw photo took table she said you're Paris?! Jokingly said course! conference mother lovely dinner date night  made reservations requested table patio unobstructed views fountains they space heaters won't cold outside but only two tables we'd wait while  Honestly came ambiance food knowing could better Italian somewhere else  guess slight disappointment face showed because gentleman front desk took minute study screen ask server put table #x  He said even better because won't cold direct middle view  disappointed  posted photo it  Just wonderful    The service dining room somewhat lacking  waiter kept kicking bag floor close chair multiple times without saying sorry offering move it  He also came back every two seconds ask wanted even though just sat down    Ah food  No bread basket  What?! Italian restaurant? told everything menu tapas style meaning two people should order least 4 dishes  Okay  But Spaghetti di fruti di mare consists two small bites 105 lb mother $38?  Okay  good  great  All all $130 two people experience worth first time food while French laundry fine  You're Vegas all  <EOR> Food delish gorgeous outdoor seating  However spoke restaurant when made reservation again 5 minutes prior arrival remind them wanted receive priceless menu my guest   described guest wearing avoid any confusion  arrive and   my guest given menu prices  ruined meal she concerned prices took away pleasure evening both! only two gave excellent reminders notifications but restaurant still managed screw up  Shameful  <EOR> Great view could enjoy fountain!!

We ordered drinks which unique delicious some best food ever tasted   The only reason can't give 5 stars because made clear waiter boyfriends birthday while several other people restaurant recognized having birthdays he wasn't which disappointing  Also really disappointed dishes the asparagus when told waiter he didn't even apologize take off bill  Considering amount spent felt service could better   Overall great time delicious meal  We'll come back but hopefully different waiter  <EOR> Wonderful food views!!
