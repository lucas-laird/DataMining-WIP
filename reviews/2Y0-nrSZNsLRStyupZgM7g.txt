The salad so so   basically you'd expect side salad tomato lettuce croutons etc    Nothing write home about   My boyfriend prime rib but instead salad opted chili along chocolate ice cream   chili fairly ok chocolate ice cream basically chocolate ice cream   also some rolls served entrees which also pretty good   The prime rib entrees however different story   Each cooked according specifications   size prime rib approximately 8 oz  each   definitely monster sized portions definitely didn't end cleaning plates   The prime rib dips sandwiches served seasoned french roll garlic butter   Heavenly   only meat cooked well but garlic butter mixed bread perfect touch   addition fries quite crispy not soggy seasoned     The chocolate cake generous piece but definitely moist delicious   ended eating entire thing myself   Overall great experience  portions huge service pretty good   Although kept waiting anxiously anticipation entree definitely well pleased choice   definitely coming back another prime rib dinner prime rib dip   prices why not? <EOR> I've Courtyard Café many times tourist less resident   met friends staying orleans dinner last night chose Café   Cobb salad wrap Cajun fries   Wonderful!  wife chicken cutlet she liked it   two friends pleased meals happy table   For dessert two chocolate brownie dream   good size brownie scoop vanilla ice cream some whipped cream   Perfect ending meal   This place merits 4th star Cajun fries alone!  certainly kicks everything notch! <EOR> This just average 24 hour casino cafe serving all sorts breakfast lunch dinner entrees   large selection really much say it   I ordered fish chips favorite comfort foods   order 3 smallish peices processed prebattered fish think Gorton's    all very greasy fries seasoned also came side salad soup corn cob   tartar sauce bit rich lacking any real flavor   using ketchep first peice fish   meal didn't sick edible but if really craving fish chips would better just across street McMullen's     Service good waitress really hustled drink server topped off ice frequently enough   reason gave only two stars however because policy cafe no take orders   never heard anything strange can't figure life why would something that     I wanted order tuna fish sandwich but couldn't wouldn't allow it   asked customers when can't finish well boxes   Okay well order then request box?  No   Really?  WTF?!  some more bewildered discussion manager said could order request box but eat some order   CRAZY!  Anyway tuna salad large chunks dry albacore lemon mayonaise good though   side cole slaw came creamy rich lacking any flavor  <EOR> We order room service Courtyard Cafe couple times during each 4 day stays Orleans  Everything pretty good except eggs convinced no hotel knows cooks non watery eggs see review French Market Buffet   only problem room service time your food gets lost lot heat  Other those two issues food service good! usually some great specials going too! <EOR> I came Courtyard Cafe Orleans Saturday absolutely packed   meeting some family breakfast before headed home California   very busy day   stood line while before finally being seated   Apparently big convention being held weekend   Because place busy took while food come out   planned 9 30 breakfast   ate closer 10 30     Across table various food items ordered   aunt California Benedict seemed enjoy it   grandma cousin both scambled egg toast   seemed perfectly average boring meal should be   ordered Philly Cheese Steak   alright   lot cheese which appreciate   meat perhaps bit dry liking but sandwich elevated over all onions mushrooms bell pepper   especially enjoyed mushrooms   many places don't serve mushrooms cheese steaks love mushrooms   side ordered potato salad   fine picnic style   Nothing remarkable   A coupon used end meal order dessert   slice carrot cake   good carrot cake too   could see fresh carrots throughout   spice level spot on   good helping chopped walnuts both cake frosting   frosting did tast much cream cheese but fine   whole thing topped drizzle caramel sauce   Oh did mention huge slice cake?

I'd back sample Hawaiian menu  <EOR> Decent American food average price  omelet 11 30 night half bad  Service little slow first but soon kept drinks full good recovery  Disappointing thing graveyard specials only Mon Thurs start midnight vs  when college few years back 11pm  also serve Chinese food night but last time tried total weaksauce  <EOR> Holy bejeez  wtf cheap bastard complaints $2 00 increase graveyard specials? can't even effin' value meal $3 99 Mickey D's let alone big honkin' steak eggs   This place great service fantastic food  don't come treated royalty come satisfy your hunger stretch your dollars  But obviously they're still expensive some el cheapos there  Whining measly $2 00 extra steak!   It's best breakfast  that's all had  Sandwiches tend dry burgers over done  Steaks hit miss but if you're paying graveyard prices  does really matter?
