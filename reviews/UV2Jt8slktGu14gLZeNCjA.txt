Take look before choose said waiter he pointed table 20 beer bottles on  did  came back pint bottle Belgian lager  Very nice mango chicken   Try place  didn't try buffet  All all portions good colleague shared curry rice paratha each  beer bill $38 incl tip  decor isn't nice Nepalese place Pasadena CA but pleasant enough    Our taxi driver didn't know name place but he'd seen it  But considering Vegas isn't necessarily place culture no bad thing if Himalayan little obscure off beaten track  <EOR> I love place lunch! Never big crowd quickly  But if you're hurry want sit check emails play your phone they're cool too  Service quick food amazing  only ever lunch buffet but top Indian good had  Must try's lentil soup garlic naan  Both best ever had  <EOR> Auuuggghhh! don't want give five stars anymore! reviews positive  many five star reviews changed way rate places  more critical now establishment way above beyond expectations best its category  Unfortunately Mint Indian Bistro best Indian food EVER period!
