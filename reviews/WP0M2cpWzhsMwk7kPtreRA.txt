I love complimentary bean dip serve chips salsa always free plate fried jalapenos onions not thing but coworkers devour them     This isn't cheapest place town taco nor most authentic Mexican food Las Vegas  However service top notch margaritas strong ambiance pleasant  <EOR> As Mexican food taco's okay but rice beans below average  The prices way high $50 lunch 3 even Yelp check in coupon expensive Salsa extra charge which ridiculous  prices mediocre food probably keep returning <EOR> Visited Viva lunch few co workers ok two parts experience appreciated 1 salsa excellent perfect amount 'hot' fresh chunky! 2 server Omar he very VERY conscientious quick!
