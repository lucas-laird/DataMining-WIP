The food cheap   very cheap actually  think 2 item combos $6 selection plentiful  knew chose Lechon Kawali Sisig Adobo   The Lechon Kawali good meaty version here   not nearly much fat other place but flavor isn't good here   the benefit all fat! catch 22   The Sisig   a little different had  bit more soupy bottom versus more dried consistency  Good though   just prefer dried more fried version myself   And course Chicken Adobo   very tasty flavorful but tiny little splinters bone distracted loving dish  need sharpen Butcher's knife! fall off bone tender though strong soy sauce flavor   I'd skip personally   So bang your buck good food money! BUT I hit restroom way saw DEAD BUGS ground   GROSS! told myself least dead   the pesticides must working right? But now am worried start looking around ground   noticed live walkin around middle day  Bleh   at least ate because sure hell didn't appetite that   It only till visit noticed other Yelper posted pics bug FOOD   If would saw chances would ate here      Good luck! <EOR> Food always delicious! every Filipino food favorites turon lechon kawali tocilog dinuguan more! tinderas always nice!
