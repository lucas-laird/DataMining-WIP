Love it! <EOR> We ate midday because Lago didn't full menu available   also fond memories place when kid   consider experience lesson choosing restaurants due lack nearby options nostalgia     We ordered Hainan chicken ate some white meat then noticed dark meat color seen chicken before  muddy gray  pointed waitress she offered replace chicken but point thought kind risky  She gave mango pudding ice tea which nice but still worth $20 plus dollars paid dish    The oxtail soup kind joke   soup standard dark broth when ordering beef brisket noodle soup     The pork lo mein overly drenched sauce   There lot options Las Vegas feel wasted money opportunity eat somewhere else  <EOR> After several hours casino arrived Noodles drinks hands   Without question seated keep drinks plus    It perfect spot lunch if don't want leave your amazing hotel   spicy dish perfect pick take dinner   I cannot wait back  <EOR> After crazy fun night Vegas felt completely obligated something painfully blistered feet trust leads reason came Noodles    headed closest nail spa hotel where seemingly crazy woman swore 80 dollar treatment she give distressed footsies going walking shoes night 10 times easier only she insisted she needed add another 20 bucks treatment because feet just effed up!  So few minutes ultimate feet pampering dont know why but felt need ask crazy woman where good place lunch strip without having send burger joint   she suggested Noodles @ Bellagio   first thing think     Bellgio?

Disappointing money   Waiter mediocre   Wouldn't back  <EOR> This place serves mildly authentic mediocre food  little pricey but Vegas hotel restaurant  Still worth visiting satisfy certain cravings   Service always fast friendly side   My mom came twice we staying Bellagio   first visit ordered mandarin beef noodle soup  While beef tendons well cooked tasty did soup much more marinade braising sauce beef broth  Some may argue common beef noodle soup but being Taiwan a place where beef noodle soup extremely popular huge fan type soup  All in all still enjoyed dish beef chunks tendons nice   The seafood pho mom ordered also plain although mom liked it    On second visit Dan Dan noodles while mother ordered Hainanese chicken rice side Shu Mai  While expert main dishes quite enjoyed Dan Dan noodles reminded tasty dry noodles sauce used kid living Taipei  would preferred if more soup noodles really taking small bowl sucking most soup    chicken rice other hand good  rice itself dry everything else dish mediocre  Shu Mai dry average tasting well   Still Noodles isn't all bad quick bite Asian food gets job done   Taking into consideration type food Noodles serves knowledge quite rare Vegas might deserve 3 5  <EOR> Delicious piping hot food made care servers kind attentive  Maybe because spoke chinese lol  again  also Malaysian thin pancake  Oh gosh good  Pricy course but isn't las Vegas <EOR> Nice space good lighting  All ate 2 side orders picked cucumbers  But super tasty clearly because 2nd order  <EOR> So good great food service  Price great being Vegas  Portions good sized did family style meal shared lots different things  Can't wait come back <EOR> I hardly leave any reviews but place far worst noodle place ever to  Overpriced bland dishes tasted water  <EOR> Noodles favorite places eat Las Vegas Blvd located inside Bellagio hotel    decor welcoming tasteful but space limited   usually wait regardless time day is    On weekends restaurant offers dim sum around lunch time through mid afternoon   very good greasy heavy some dim sum places to   price dim sum regular dishes seem higher average Chinese restaurant but everything tastes great nice presentation decent size portions     My personal favorites    Thai noodles beef chow fun  <EOR> We twice during stay hotel 3 different types noodles wonton soup noodles beef noodles tun yon all very good  orders came quickly bills came even faster  if flight catch restaurant  If want linger little longer forget it  noodles pricey if order drink your noodles talking $30 per person which most expensive noodle restaurant ever been  enjoy noodles very much 65 year old tasted noodles all over planet earth  restaurant noodles which rival best best  if bellagio give try  <EOR> We Bellagio see Chinese New Year display thought we'd try Noodles restaurant  standing line lengthy time finally ushered into restaurant given table open entire time stood waiting actually asked why no given table  Food excessively slow arriving meal brought time major gap between meals delivered  Worst offense member party 4 NEVER brought meal  waiter NEVER came table check meal  When finally flagged someone down check missing meal waiter appeared said somehow overlooked  Within 5 minutes meal appeared miraculously  Total time dinner once seated inside restaurant 2 hours  Totally ridiculous definitely worth time trouble  boot dish ordered no spice delivered spicy  waste your time mediocre food  somewhere else  <EOR> 3 5 food 0 5 alone good service   After half hour reading Yelp reviews deliberating over whether wanted pay higher LA prices Asian cuisine sucked decided give Noodles try     Decor ambience all pretentious   Moderate Asian influence minimalist decor comfortable atmosphere   Seating away gaming floor forget casino   Food sweet spicy noodle Mandarin beef stew   Flavors good meat flavorful tender   place known its wonton soup but mood evening   Looking around other tables classic dishes fried rices BBQ pork looked excellent   menu fusion Thai Vietnamese Chinese flavors dishes   Service excellent arrived hungry ready over order   surprise environment where expect upsold waiter extremely helpful deciding much order flat said No when wanted third dish Lol   huge service because being vacation would no where keep leftovers   All staff courteous very accommodating well   Portion size relative   Contrary many reviews Yelp found portions adequate   Granted don't eat used college but two entrees enough two average sized bellies leave feeling slightly uncomfortably full  <EOR> We bit lighter dinner nearly two weeks eating vacation already Bellagio while waiting doors open O   quick scan restaurant offerings seemed suggest Noodles would hit spot   We ordered pair specialty cocktails steamed dumplings Szechuan Dan Dan noodle soup Spicy Thai Shrimp Noodle Soup   high hopes given decor restaurant emphasis Authentic regional dishes all over Asia      Food snob warning fond memories Dan Dan Noodle Soup visiting Szechuan province there's restaurant near home does pretty accurate version   also pretty well myself   hard   What served Noodles compares only name flavor broth extremely muted no measurable amount heat dish   needed chili oil tried some Szechuan chili oil server could fix but no she said kitchen doesn't it   Which seems odd being Szechuan chili oil key ingredient dish   I'd liken serving pho without having Sriracha hoisin sauce dip meat in   edible but would missing expected set flavors   After little prodding server did bring dish house chili oil which chopped green red jalapenos garlic vegetable oil   helped little but doesn't exactly replace complex flavors numbing sensation Szechuan peppercorns   The wife's Spicy Thai shrimp noodle soup similarly bland would benefited some additional fish sauce Thai chili pepper   She wasn't very happy but she doesn't feel need off tirade it    turf   Authentic?  bit  Palatable average American?  Sure   I did pay more 50 times bowl Dan Dan noodle soup costs streets Chengdu almost twice costs home  going least  I should pulled car valet driven Chubby Cattle instead   Oh well  <EOR> Seeing hotel restaurant wern't expecting best noodle dishes but surprised dishes tasted  something  you'd crappy dive asian restaurant    Arrived Monday 8pm happy wait only few  minutes considering bad food   Tables pretty tight together   Servers pretty quick greet offer drinks     2 dishes tried were 1 Hor Fun Beef Shrimp Oyster Sauce     types noodles normally crispy shoggy spaghetti    If asked rate i'd give dish 1 5 scale 2 Singapore Curry Rice Vermicelli Shrimp Shredded Pork    day dish saltiest even had   Appear may dropped bottle salt dish    only compliment give 3 shrimp pieces dish jumbo size tiny shrimps normally gets    Giving dish also 1 5   both dishes above 1 beer came $ 45 without tip  <EOR> Authentic laksa   spicy Singapore Malaysia but other legit   Chinese beef noodle authentic very tasty    lived China Malaysia speak experience  <EOR> Loved authentic Hong Kong style Chinese food  Had good dinner whole family back some late night snacks wife   The seafood porridge particularly good late night cravings  <EOR> Have eaten bunch times used play poker Bellagio few times week   really sure why people complaining price pretty standard strip   If want pay $7 meal panda   two your probably $75   Noodles solid usually some pork   Service attentive   would say same level Beijing Noodle #9 Caesars  <EOR> Just ate past weekend  group thought food ok  waiter recommended Pad Thai thought lack taste  <EOR> Pretty decent food here  your typical 'americanized' Asian food  Cantonese Sezchuan Vietnamese probably other    I Seafood Pho which overpriced $17 worst pho ever had  broth crystal clear seafood balls spongy  noodles okay portion size decent    My wife sweet sour shrimp which decent par chain Pei Wei  great $26    All all $50 meal very disappointing  imagine would pretty good if drunk  Definitely would come back  <EOR> Some amazing dim sum Noodle  hit Sunday brunch carts rolling 11 00 am  Authentic flavors small but well informed ala cart menu good service  Do miss Shanghai Dumplings!!!! <EOR> very yummy!!!!!  could eat every single day never tire it   little spensy side but very large portions   suggest maybe splitting entree but definitely fill appetizers!  minus star no free refills!!!  hell about?

Aside all really craving Asian noodle soup specifically Tom yum saw menu since same hotel staying decided come try it  shared bowl spicy Thai shrimp noodle soup which pretty much tom yum soup rice noodles it  flavor soup actually really good  just perfect amount spicy sour  came 4 pretty good sized shrimps well  bill came $24 tax tip just bowl noodles  would back try other noodles dishes if only prices cheaper  <EOR> Well Definitely satisfying noodles but price $19 plate  know anything strip casino usually pricey  But didn't anticipate paying $19 noodles  forgot which but pad kee Mao chicken  bit spicy very flavorful greasy  perfect drunk food ESP long night partying  <EOR> Located conveniently Bellagio restaurant doesn't disappoint   Good quality Asian food reasonable price   Dim sum weekend   Service efficient  <EOR> I love place  more often last month  Service great quality dishes wonderful  noodle soups fantastic  tried spicy shrimp noodle soup wonton noodle soup  Both thumbs up  spice shrimp noodle dish really spicy just mindful when ordering dish! shu mai great addition any meal dumplings  huge fan  nigori genshu sake favorite cloudy unfiltered sweet aftertaste  restaurant well lit first come first serve no reservations taken which difficult weekend  wall tapestries made long hay grass twisted hanging  Overall pleasing look but wouldn't consider romantic  Just great place eat enjoy company another  <EOR> Two words    stay away   unless don't care 15 congee small bowl  9 dim sum taste crap   All previously frozen   Must worst dim sum ever tasted   But good service all Asian    2 stars   Take cab spring mountain better dim sum  <EOR> fast service good food wonton beef stew soup siu mao 4 pcs char siu bbq pork steamed buns thai iced tea highly recommended a good place night owls  <EOR> I feel place probably most authentic Chinese restaurant Strip  chefs actually Asian servers also I saw very own eyes !  We ordered traditional Chinese beef noodle soup jook century egg pork   extremely generous meat both dishes  beef noodle soup gigantic piece tendon cartilage AWESOME!! along other pieces beef  obvious stewing long time since meat very tender soft fell apart each bite  soup considered quite precise traditional taste but definitely milder spiciness which sense since also need appeal non Asian customers  jook good tasted close am accustomed to  super generous century egg ! though slightly less pork   Prices bit high but expected  service top notch super friendly! food most definitely better taste texture Noodle Asia Venetian  very happy discovered place! <EOR> OK before beef noodle soup but actually think place even though expensive does hit spot asian food if around Bellagio    I ordered BBQ Pork Wonton Hor Fun noodle soup but gave egg noodles accident  told them came back extra heaping BBQ Pork  Grateful delighted  also soup very hot  Pricey but expect when you're strip Vegas? <EOR> Pricey Chinese food but  Bellagio no surprise   Plus they're open till 2am you're paying convenience too   I always order same thing but good combination can't seem stray it   Edamame nothing special but $7 50 probably most expensive edamames there   Spicy Cucumber really really good too   more Korean kimchee style don't cucumber consistantly  crunchy sweet spicy but again expensive    think $7 $8 SIDE DISH      My favorite all time dish braised beef tendon soup egg noodles   meat cook well very tender egg noodles thin delicate really good combination but broth little soy saucey     Good food incredibly high prices place chinese food late hours  <EOR> Probably best Asian food Vegas far but only day 2 very authentic when comes Chinese food  thought food little bland but remember  older chinese people like  may add some salt pepper but thought better since healthier   I extremely hungry casino floor wasn't much open but remembered friend telling Noodles pretty good  came few hours ago but wait 45 minutes  Around 12am probably only waited around 20 minutes  Once sat down server came relatively quickly take order food came soon after  ordered kimchi hot spicy cucumber roast duck roast pork bokchoy garlic sauce 2 congee century egg pork  Everything very good but said earlier little bland  Although pork congee very flavorful  Definitely satisfied craving Chinese food!   My only complaint would pretty pricey but then again casino food expected  probably going back since friends back poker    Tip if your friends play high stakes room back food free  doing next time <EOR> An excellent Chinese restaurant beautiful casino Vegas  bit pricier your usual Chinese restaurant but you're strip casino expect pay bit more!  Plus waitresses actually greet provide some decent customer service!   The menu pretty extensive offering variety dim sum items soups seafood rice dishes  ordered won ton soup lap cherng chinese sausage fried rice curry chicken all dishes tasty!   The decor beautiful well jars ingredients laid walls  friendly restaurant friendly staff  would totally recommend check place! <EOR> Get Duck Fried Rice  Rice? noodle joint? Just won't regret it! Everyone party six except licked plates clean  duck meat juicy tender flavorful   Otherwise food seems mediocre  Wonton Noodle Soup just okay  cuisine does lean more towards Hong Kong style may why prefer Taiwanese food more  did want Xiao Long Bao but stop serving 3pm  If want XLBs any dim sum come before then   Service great  Great restaurant but wouldn't way unless friend wants happen already Bellagio  <EOR> Eh food ok nothing write home about   bland barely average   reviews all poor prior coming but conveniently located why chose it   Over priced sub par food  <EOR> When you're Vegas craving some Asian noodles better place come place Bellagio called NOODLES? Well first let tell definitely satisfied craving noodles  just wanted some ho phun thick white rice noodles noodles exactly that! EXCEPT 15 dollars small little bowl noodles which definitely HUGE rip off   but hey its Vegas huge craving some asian noodles!   Decor nice looks more high end most noodle places  Service bit snooty maybe because all Fat Tuesdays table??   But anyways if craving noodles satisfy your craving    but you'll hungry 2 hours later   <EOR> Noodles  3 5 stars A lot reviews say service horrible but all times BF nothing but nice us   Lobstah salt pepper chilis garlic onions   4 stars LOBSTAH deep fried quite tasty although just bit salty me  Good size portion although market price  think next time just try different version   Shrimp dumplings  4 stars favorite much ordered twice! shrimps steamed perfectly mushy lot other places   The wrapper steamed perfectly sticky   XO Crabmeat Vermicelli  4 stars If love crab very tasty dish  definitely see crab star!!  The vermicelli lighter version noodles which helped due fact order lot just try variety   I would order again! Especially since Noodles original!!  Kung Pao Shrimp  3 stars I want spicy!! unfortunately not   The shrimps pretty big but more sweet sour shrimp me  BF liked it   Pork Vegetable Dumplings  2 stars My least favorite am dumpling lover!!  The inside just mushed unidentifiable meat no sign veggies  Very disappointing   I would order again   Noodles In House Special Spicy Sauce  5 stars sauce awesome definitely kick it!!

It wasn't asking whole dinner comp'd but put something couldn't eat such nice resort egregious     The quality food service if could would 5 Star hotel management should take look personnel management because well      they Bellagio look bad! <EOR> I am walking right now feel compelled write review now because experience had   First take reservations  called # listed Yelp listing which took Bellagio reservations  then transferred Noodles said just come even though called reservation bc party 5 didn't want stand line long   Noodles maybe influx people suddenly craved hodgepodge Asian selections but long line  Sad face  Understandable thought because tried move line fast could   Unfortunately service mediocre somewhat rude  did water tea until close 15 minutes server took order  then ask condiments usually accompany dishes sriracha hoisin pho red vinegar wonton noodle soup     I can't speak other dishes but wonton noodle soup overcooked flavorless    Also understand casino food outlet but would expected better service little more tasteless soup  <EOR> My first Vegas review! admit difficult rate your dining experience casino  hustle bustle eclectic crowd mix vary widely greatly affect meal ambiance  Very little into research selection quick lunch grab however place offered some warm tea hot dumpling noodle soup such in!  The food probably 4 5 its own merit  very authentic feel flavor  Really good noodles dumplings! menu seemed South East Asian influence suits tastes well  Also tea unexpectedly delicious unfortunately didn't ask specifics apologies! definitely some if partake meal here    The setting very bright felt well suited business meal which fine town business however does give bit impersonal vibe proximity tables around only compounds that  service succinct but rushed due suspect volume business running through casino    Overall solid 3 stars ideally I'd come back solidify evaluation but unlikely able return trip  food but don't plan having your signature meal Vegas here likely more fantastical experiences around city  <EOR> The boyfriend Vegas decided stuff ourselves buffet once   Bellagio saw Noodles decided give try   weren't hungry only appetizer Satay entree Pad Thai   dishes mediocre tasting somewhat expensive oh well Vegas right?  Little did know stepped began walking Planet Hollywood would start feel little uneasy stomach   quickly looked restroom dashed set eyes I leave rest your imagination happens Vegas stays Vegas    hehe    Before unexpected turn events thought Noodles average worst but wards said myself never set butt ever again    mistake eating realized indeed best bet Vegas buffet   Even though eating most buffets stomach lining always feels verge tearing pain worth since still better Noodles  <EOR> Dinner visit  bit wait but worth wait   Reasonably priced for venue good food money   fried calamari appetizer unremarkable  hard time finishing main course which laden tender chicken great noodles very savory broth very filling  Good selection sake   Service attentive without making feel rushed  <EOR> Best Hangover Remedy Ever   The wait isnt bad morning only took 5 10 minutes seated  pho which big expensive when compare pho place back home but guess isnt bad Vegas  Beef noodle soup egg noodle fulfilling stingy noodles meat    I say though service wasn't all great  good forever glass water ad pay bill  asked check gave 20 minutes later    It's worth trying especially if you're craving pho  <EOR> Did even eat because hostess pushy annoying   But turned best because decided another restaurant while waiting table gf played slot machine won $100 right before table FIX   Thanks <EOR> XO Crab Noodles  Come spot Bellagio thing only those XO crab noodles die for! Lines long eating off hour definitely helps  <EOR> You know when you're eat Bellagio first thing comes mind gonna fatter but wallet skinnier   Noodles probably cheaper venues Bellagio but still overpriced ordered  Paying $4+ shrimp dumplings hao gaw absurd but hey Vegas  shared $15 bowl beef noodle soup friend plentiful  noodles were   well   noodles only piece beef chuck rest tendons soup nice kick hits spot nasty hangover   good place visit if Chinese food your comfort food but wouldn't sad if never came again  say give try time if you're staying strip but no need your way  <EOR> 1 star service  waitress attentive nice  She gave pretty much everything asked timely manner    0 star food  dining Vegas prices higher where am from  expected expensive however food tasted terrible  Penang fried noodles way salty very little meat  presentation looked bad  cousin also ordered same dish did  looked chef only made dish split into two plates  parents ordered varieties meat veggies  Everything tasted salted bland  portion way small yes very expensive    Please everyone don't waste your time money coming here  If craving Chinese food Vegas please someone where else  Drive Chinatown area which minutes away strip better food cheaper  <EOR> The first time ate loving everything ate  When came back parents experience wasn't nearly same  potstickers still delicious authentic flavors existed but food just wasn't good  paid $50 lobster tail size tiny palm which waiter forgot order first place  guess expect higher prices Bellagio but $18 basic fried rice isn't exactly ally  Still willing give more chance before cross off list  <EOR> Grosssssssssssssssssss!

There's still plenty menu would want try yes  <EOR> I live Las Vegas but if stay marooned Strip would eat Noodles  slightly more expensive find street Chinatown however food exceptional  least 20 meals same quality each time  Very few restaurants manage consistency  highly recommend pad thai they wide rice noodles green tea ice cream desert  best green tea ice cream strip throughout chinatown  understand homemade just something container  <EOR> Things order Jasmine tea Dumplings pepper shrimp mango pudding dessert  <EOR> 3 5 noodles  Maybe 4 but just kind tired now  Noodles best when first started going but now its just ok  always ordered oriental fried rice spareribs course all noodle options good  food pretty expensive but aren't all restaurants hotels? worth try if you're already why not? <EOR> Really poor service really long waits incredibly average food pretty absurd price  No free refills soft drinks always something irks well  <EOR> Decent food relatively reasonable prices Vegas $15 20 range most entrees    Good selection traditional style Asian dishes  Sweet spicy noodles particularly delicious  Main complaint service  Dishes arrived different times which acceptable   But 15 minute delay between arrival different plates bit much   Also fairly long line seating   However both could possibly attributed Saturday night rush  Overall worth visit  <EOR> Honestly expected way more restaurant Bellagio  1st off wait's extremely long  waited 1+ hour overpriced bellow average Chinese food  much supposedly famous chef China      Wonton Noodle $15 25 Sure taste somewhat authentic but flavor isn't good  noodle soup broth just ok nothing special  wonton's actually decently good but given pretty small portion expensive price definitely worth it   BBQ Noodle Soup $15 25 wouldn't again    BBQ isn't good all guys're better off wonton   In conclusion place isn't worth visiting for  Yeah sure all food Vegas're overpriced but least some them taste decently good  I'd rather spend 15 bucks eating McDonald here  only taste pretty bad I'd give 2 stars expensive portion's also pretty small sandwiches right after    <EOR> Good food good service reasonably priced compared other Belagio restaurants  fried rice barbecue pork very good  Also tempura shrimp which liked well  easily without reservation Thursday night  would back  <EOR> This favorite spots Vegas  food amazing  Having China say food legit! <EOR> Diverse menu selection something everyone  broths great  bbq pork soup  great light lunch  <EOR> Came meet wife's cousins   Seating decor nice   pretty small    tried pad thai Spicy Shrimp dish   liked both      but just warning aren't same way see normal restaurants     wife didn't much    appetizers we're really tasty   wouldn't minded just eating appetizers  <EOR> Ha ha just no price real Korean restaurant eat real Koreans making food more servings 25 00 per person China Town no Thank your Americanized fusion foods! prefer made real deal!

<EOR> Cute place decent service but food meh    We arrived late last night wanted some noodle soup dinner  eaten lunch before little over year ago wait pretty long then  time much later no line    Anyway can't really remember thought food last time but now refreshed memory    Meh   We party 3 ordered har gow shrimp dumplings dim sum wonton noodle soup noodle soup poached chicken plain wonton soup  har gow skin bit mushy tough filling noodles obviously rehydrated variety wonton filling also very tough soup lacked flavor  enjoyed most poached chicken soup  tender flavorful compared everything else tough flavorless   All all bit disappointed having wasted belly space mediocre meal  <EOR> I've ordered sweet spicy noodles chicken  dish pretty decent noodles good blended sweet sauce sure spicy part? maybe wasn't spicy enough but hey wiped plate  Along order bottle Sapporo beer which ok kinda bitter side didn't accommodate noodles thats sure   We friendly service didn't wait seats well duh 11 47pm night  see jars jars uncooked noodles display  Hmmmm    I wonder if use those create own noodles? <EOR> I really really wanted love Noodles but came away meal just thinking ok   In all fairness didn't study menu very well tired hungry just ordered stuff would order home  ordered shrimp chow mein bbq pork duck plate  chow mein fairly good but thought lacking some flavor  only 4 shrimp which disappointing  pork duck plate really good  pork very tender dry all  duck greasy might expect  Unlike chow mein both lot flavor   We both ordered drinks too  White Tiger martini bf Zombie drink  Now if order drink server advises big drink ok she he doesn't mean its just bigger say martini  She he means could probably share another person comes bowl flame middle  Craziness   The bill just under 115 tip  expensive side but knew going in  Its defintely must eat place but might back try another noodle dish sometime  <EOR> My friends dropped Noodles lunch  your standard Vegas restaurant serving overpriced Americanized oriental fare   We all ordered Roast Duck rice Chinese broccoli $16 75 which definitely hits spot  rice service piping hot duck pretty flavorful albeit bit fatty expected  Portions average size more personal size which may may fill if you're hangry   Service quick seated quickly food also came quickly  Any special requests most likely honored don't set your expectations high   Overall everything pretty average but bad per se  hard stomach prices enjoyed delicious beef stew noodles LA 1 3 price beef stew noodles menu $18 95 R U SRS BRAH?!   <EOR> I eaten twice  Both times crab fried rice  first time minus silverfish but last time with  delicious dish prefer silverfish  However now done more research silverfish sure again  veggie spring rolls passable but way better lower end places  If again crab fried rice minus silverfish again  But really great place eat  Also servers customer service really very good  <EOR> Noodles open late [2am?] came show Saturday night  stood line while  didn't seem host hostess seating people but said wait waited    The decor very brown tan bland  needed some little pop color red bright green there  wall noodles nicely done  Strangely Noodles pretty brightly lit time night sort small intimate feel place almost had    My group comprised three couples  Couple ordered some white chicken broccoli noodle dish really liked  Boyfriend I the 2nd couple potstickers miso pad Thai off Pre Fixe menu  All tasty! loved miso flavor  the saltiness perfect  postickers okay sure if sausage but meat kinda pink  Pad Thai great  they used wide noodles dish change but liked   The table kind cool looking first  it low tube backing  Downside all three side slammed knees into table leg getting out! big ol' bruise now  <EOR> We Vegas stayed Bellagio   wandering around stumbled upon Noodles which presents itself hole armpit Bellagio   getting sick evening  Sore throat cough congestion really just wanted back room   ended eating Noodles absolute joy serve Taiwanese beef Noodle soup ultimate comfort food me   If menu no matter weather personal food craving ALWAYS order it   happened very much mood BNS overjoyed meal brought me  hit spot every way possible bowl noodle soup when you're middle desert   would five stars but husband wasn't quite overjoyed meal   good but awe inspiring way mine was  We're planning trip Vegas soon fully intend going back another bowl noodles   name true word look forward eating again soon   As always strongly recommend mainstream dishes when visit authentic type Asian restaurants  <EOR> I know why place 3 star  food ok bad  But portion tiny  expect paying $20 bowl noodle fulled but case!! ended doing $40 meal thinking noodle expensive  <EOR> I must preface saying only ate because starving everything else hotel closed prepare dinner     When walked thought place looked promising seeing decanters dried noodles which ok follows decor but then realized dried noodles probably leave decanters actually plates!  really but thought name called noodles would taste well homemade   Boy mistaken   We started meal off potstickers   better Ling's myself $15 bad   Then started sipping $4 ice tea   $4 tasted used bathwater   Yuck then choked down sweet spicy noodles which dressing some soy sauce more hot sauce didn't taste bad   But $50 lunch say Overratted  <EOR> Dim sum option nice surprise  Very tasty filling but times food little cold time us  Carts slow come around but gave chance rest more space  <EOR> When hungry late night some hard work gambling stumble over noodles late night dinner  waited 7 minutes seated restaurant packed Asians know somewhat authentic    We looked over menu quite honestly know vegas BUt price point dishes bit absurd  only ordered house recommended dishes there's symbol next dishes    We wonton noodle soup broth clear consume pretty flavorless doused mine some chili sauce  shrimp wontons nicely seasoned salt seasame oil  But 16 medium size bowl soup expected way more  We also tried shrimp chow mein 18 00 when am used paying price home made noodles   For noodle house biggest let down noodles home made     Would return there? Still debate  The ladies super nice speak Cantonese! <EOR> We ate quick lunch  vegetable dish three flavors dish pork duck chicken oriental fried rice  flavors all point authentic Cantonese food  3 dishes two ice teas tip cost $91  expensive? Yes  But restaurant Bellagio comes territory  Also service great would say even par other fancier restaurants ate Bellagio   Don't come expecting quick cheap meal but come if you're looking tasty quick meal  Overall if hankering some Chinese food money cause just won some want some friendly folks serve food would recommend place  <EOR> My place every time Vegas dinner late night dinner  Couple appetizers must try roti sauce amazing + vegetable tempura  busy having M Life  vip card helps being seated bypassing line  Enjoy ! <EOR> This most expensive place ever traditional Chinese food  3 4x price food Chinatown  food tastes really good if really wanted blow your money food cheaply else where Chinatown?

Hainanese Chicken Rice So so   better   chicken correct Hainanese taste does rice but think chicken could more moist   Also chili sauce comes platter correct Hainanese chili   ginger sauce ok  Penang Char Kway Teow Shrimp just ok me   enough sweet black sauce   So overall I'd come back Laksa sure  <EOR> For being Bellagio dishes very sub par   I live Bay Area speak bias easily find same quality dish half price within walking distance apartment Berkeley    Some dishes bland  Overall food mediocre   The price reasonable Vegas  <EOR> I recommend Thai soup congee   yellow noodle duck wonton soup pretty bland  mix soy sauce hot sauce give more flavor  Service very rude sometimes  recommend phoning your order picking your order avoid line eating your room  <EOR> Do yourself small favor today  tomorrow  But no later  Noodles  Order  crab fried rice  Die knowing your life full one  end  <EOR> We did high expectations place just looking place late night meal  They open until 2am  Given name thought place just noodles bar but more that  offering wide selection Chinese dishes    The food quality pretty good  fried rice beef noodles wonton noodles good any Asia  service friendly patient  <EOR> Highly disappointed restaurant  food below average service awful  seemed smiling frowned upon because didn't smile whole time all waiters waitresses  4 person didn't food because forgot  didn't apologize being 30 Min rest food neither compensated meal inconvenience  head host unfazed anything almost didn't care whether customer not  Definitely run business!

Bellagio manager owner should look into restaurant business practice  Consider Bellagio rated top 100 hotels U S  rated 5 Star  restaurant doesn't deserve Bellagio hence average rating yelp validate any negative claims  Nothing should average Bellagio  <EOR> I came randomly family before watching O surprisingly tasty  ordered asahi shiu mai chinese broccoli hong kong style egg noodles four my family eats very very little   Everything excellent!

<EOR> My wife end Vegas 3 4 times year   Even if we're staying Bellagio which rare still try over lunch   Good consistent quality excellent service which rare value Vegas   most traditional but while trying please tastebuds masses still remain very true Asian flavors normally only found downtowns your local big city   Worth try sure! <EOR> My wife came when staying Bellagio wedding honeymoon week 4 22 4 26 12   both tired Tue night plans fancy steakhouse next night wanted play mellow  came no reservations only 15 minute wait  tend picky eater wife little worried finding something menu  ended going noodle soup soya chicken   When came table little bland but adding hot sauce soy sauce soup REALLY good  waitress nice very attentive  Overall good experience nice dressed down evening  <EOR> Well fiddlesticks inconsistency never good thing restaurant   why people not but some eat P F  Chang's  know they're getting    After most recent delicious plate snow peas decided return time snow peas missing addictive flavor  weren't sweet nor seasoned wok iness  ate them but wasn't compelled eat them faster husband ensure more which did last time!

So update say depending kitchen may 3 star meal 4 star meal but still think key going cheaper stuff! <EOR> First thing noticed walking restaurant nice line seated   Next thing noticed expensive menu   $20 bowl pho   Where $5 $10 max wherever been   Pretty ridiculous pricing if ask me   pho wasn't even great tasted plain   friend cucumber salad   When waitress brought looked side order extra stuff cilantro you'd put your food   Plate hella small portion   cost $8   glad didn't opt salad time   would've super disappointed pissed   ordered fried rice which cost $15 16 bucks   happy order compared rest   tasted decent bigger portion LOL  did add lot hot sauce peppers   When friend wanted beer she asked waitress   waitress told she order bar!  Lolololol course should've expected this   Asian customer service mostly always terrible   Luckily waitress changed mind her   Overall restaurant nice looking customer service little less decent but terrible food mostly plain expensive if ever eat again if friends drag would opt fried rice again  <EOR> Bellagio such great place LV but noodles disgusting food service <EOR> I just remembered eating last day Vegas few months ago thought I'd write review   The bf ended realizing time crunch gigantic wait times all others restaurants inside Bellagio   It okay great but okay  Kind pricey but then again eating restaurant inside Bellagio Vegas expect    The bf beef chow fun which he said pretty good BBQ pork noodle soup my comfort food night hehe   BBQ pork noodle soup wasn't spectacular I didn't particularly charsiu because thought flavor little off but definitely nice option eating without leaving strip  dim sum looked legit but sneaking suspicion doesn't taste legit  would suggest sticking dishes hard mess i e  chow mein chow fun   My summary place would be convenient fairly decent Chinese food when a hungover b craving Chinese food c staying Bellagio d all above  But know you're paying convenience  <EOR> Make sure 10 15 minutes early standing line dinner because lines kind long wait time could hours  When came restaurant family took 30 minutes before seated  First impression place nice  Seats unique comfortable spice jar decor beautiful    Service bit off took while drinks long time order in  point where drank all waters before ordering top didn't refill until server took order  ordered food mostly family style plates noodles duck beef dishes  dessert ordered mango pudding  food good any other local Chinese cuisine restaurant  mango pudding best eaten far  probably just come back that  bill 4 mango puddings 3 dishes bill came $85 tax  very pricey  price did match quantity give quality food tasted your local Chinese restaurant cuisine    Noodles good experience but won't ever dine again because monies weren't worth service taste food got  mango pudding only good thing place! <EOR> It's real deal!

The servers nice but lacked knowledge took forever between table visits   When ours finally came back asked if individual family style serving he didn't know meant   *sigh*  turned family style each dish could serve 3 4 easily    ordered thai noodle tom yum soup while broth arromatic all lacked flavor   pull veggies shrimp slice them could eat them without choking   cilantro great touch but braided together threw bowl could only huge chunks all once   love some cilantro but ridiculous     Overall can't say would return Noodles   smoke casino wafted regular basis seeing absolutely NO separation between two capping off negative experience  <EOR> UGH!!
