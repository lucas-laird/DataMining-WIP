I five friends past Tuesday night just terrible experience start finish   We walked into restaurant around 7 pm entire place empty save group   waitress literally table see to   terrible sore throat asked hot tea brought immediately  placed orders asked Diet Coke brought meal   FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER finally served     Diet Coke   No tea sight   FIFTEEN MINUTES   still nobody else entire restaurant   I ordered minestrone soup did two friends   Only two bowls brought   asked where mine waitress said Oh want some too? Really?  Because hadn't written down three orders soup?  Oh when friends actually took sip soups both said completely inedible filled pepper way hot   Nobody could take another bite   Another friend ordered stuffed mushroom   Nowhere menu did say fried but arrived fried   She sent them back asked baked mushrooms instead   never arrived   I shared pizza friend two other friends ordered pizza share well   Mine brought fifteen minutes Diet Coke brought remember asked brought meal?  Yeah right     friend actually completely finished pizza time other two friends even received theirs   sit around waiting theirs while ate then sit around waiting them eat we'd already finished ours!
