Dessert chocolate mousse fresh berries served same soup bowl ! Lol but none strawberries stemmed which kind defeats purpose having fancy presentation when u spit stems Becuz no knife presented dessert ! service most servers regular restaurant definetly seem lost higher end environment most seem clueless menu presentations special dishes ! bussers  most part vigilant kept tables clean water filled but really clueless higher end service when asked question said server would soon ! Maybe give them job wiping wine glasses first lipstick water stain both ? But nice pour price 7$ ? All all slightly above average experience but definetly worth doubling price food prepared same kitchen servers regular restaurant walk in thru service doors usual most don't look working ! Maybe future when menu Items definite departure regular fare service fine tuned nice alternative hotel ! But save your money less fancier versions next store !! <EOR> WORST SERVICE EVER! start let just say busy night there  seated table nice lady took drink orders said waiter would over shortly  20 30 mins later no waiter  stop ask someone grab him  He comes over takes order order veggie burger cheese then he total ghost us  Didn't see floor all  60 mins no waiter no food  Luckily manager stops table say hi ask if he check food  Few moments later waiter appears food literally drops plates table walks away saying anything  start cut burger half notice veggie burger BACON it  Really? bacon veggie burger?
