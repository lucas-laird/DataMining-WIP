nothing unbearable   The $7 buffet definitely bargain very convenient quick bite option   Food quality good restaurant also pretty clean   pool wasn't much highlight   2 pools both located guessing older part hotel   pool areas both pretty decent appeared well maintained   But if you're going chic Vegas spa pool scene probably won't satisfied location     I enjoyed stay overall would stay again if bargain clean comfortable hotel looking next Vegas trip  <EOR> My husband stayed Palace Station Las Vegas Feb 21 Feb 24 2013   stayed once before 5 years ago   pleased experience then which why

Station letterhead seminar schedule I'd imagine management well aware room would used for   fact front desk person able tell another seminar scheduled next morning well same room    There absolutely no reason paying customer should disturbed business function occurring adjoining room   Business functions should occur business facilities conference rooms banquet areas separate customer rooms   In addition incredibly displeased service received Grand Cafe   before leaving next morning asking couple minutes decide order did see server again over 15 minutes when found someone else find her

Parking easy Palace Station isn't popular destination tourists   If seafood Cajun style food check Oyster Bar! line's usually long during peak hours hour+ wait anyone?? but worth it! bar very small only 18 seats wait everyone finish before seated  Many people know come Palace Station just Oyster Bar! definitely become pit stop all Vegas trips  <EOR> I recommend come bingo  Worst mistake made  9am session payout only $50 per game  also jackpot worth over $60k    The cashier helped rude mean time finished back seat honestly didn't want play   This back April came back late May someone else cashier stand 100% better   Overall casino pretty big off strip  probably would stick playing Bingo Gold Coast Silver Seven Sam's Town  <EOR> You pay for  stayed over Labor Day weekend because obviously cheaper staying strip  When walked first thing did bathroom use but found pubic hair toilet then bed blonde hairs black hairs all over it  only good thing hotel itself wild hotels strip little more family friendly <EOR> Stayed few months ago  Didn't high expectations  really paid here  Rooms small kinda dirty    Tip if your room south tower drive past parking structure park right next your room  also 711 right next door if want quick beer run  <EOR> For 5 nights checked Tues night checked Sun paid $163 23 initially included amount stay night plus tax then check paid resort fee which $16 79 day x 5 days = $83 95 total $247 18 which roughly $50 night including everything    You forewarned  place charges resort fee $16 79 day prices subject change  Also check in place $100 deposit your credit card case something broken damaged  sure give $100 deposit back check out   We stayed courtyard rooms  rooms behind hotel main tower look worse more condemned Motel 6  When saw staying felt uneasy  If could avoid courtyard rooms please so  Inside room meh  dirty musty old carpet TV no fridge small desk stand only shower probably wouldn't accommodate someone over 6 feet small sink mirror situated awkwardly high hair dryer no coffee machine clean toilet clean sheets clean towels  beds ok  able sleep  AC kind loud thermostat wall     We preferred maid service even though included resort fee  just don't people walking where things are  Each day when would leave would put disturb sign door knob  2 5 days disturb signs missing rooms ended being cleaned  sure if some prank if maids took off could clean rooms therefore tip? Anyways good feeling   As wifi room  kind confusing  says wifi included resort fee however log wifi daily through screen accept $5 99 charge every 24 hours typing your name room number  nervous because would accept $5 99 each time thinking would somehow appear check out slip but ended being bill  future reference shouldn't charged wifi even though says so  If want clarification reassurance call front desk operator   To sum Pros not much The Oyster Bar main casino floor FANTASTIC! If you're seafood fan try place  security guards bikes roaming around parking garage hotel grounds even courtyard area all hours  plenty lighting courtyard parking lot even though does look sketchy  Had no problems service  Everyone interacted cordial   Cons It's old hotel some amenities older dirtier could use update  It's mandatory key walk hallway courtyard rooms parking lot but first 3 days door broken so anybody could walk area which room was   It's kind nerve wracking feeling unsafe leaving your car courtyard parking lot  Not best neighborhood kind ghetto area   If stay again would sure book tower room  <EOR> Purchased Courtyard Deal Groupon  boyfriend just needed quick cheap Hotel crash BUT regretted EVERY penny ONCE walked in  There's resort fee EACH NIGHT WHAT? Room separated everything else! DIRTY ROOM NO ELEVATORS Good luck heavy luggage because you'll walking circles FOOD TERRIBLE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE Thin walls heard Neighbors argue morning  Pay EXTRA stay elsewhere  place rut!!!!!!! pay <EOR> Great place play drink cheap   Play Tie Bet Black Jack some money!!!  haven't stayed but comp rooms food easy  <EOR> Smoky mess questionable towels pillow cases  many things list but just head LaQuinta non smoking atmosphere  Non smoking rooms enough tower  Asthma sufferers   go someplace else  Way old just    much name  <EOR> Despite fact hotel Vegas BLVD  nice place stay  standing buffet great steak house  only thing extremely glamorous  But price great service extremely clean  <EOR> My family stayed vacation November 2015 fairly inexpensive option far hotels go  Overall liked hotel few things thought could even better thicker blankets better lighting larger showers microwaves mini fridges all rooms would've made stay much better but overall couldn't complain much  chose hotel stay but I'd stay again  If you're into staying strip good place stay especially because easy interstate access kind centrally located nice  <EOR> This place most kick ass buffet seriously everything delicious ton options  free preferred card breakfast $6 50  weekends only Brunch around $9 50 plus free drink  booze all sorts specials  Definitely kick ass buffet price  <EOR> This place sucks    booked room Courtyard week Expedia   paid usual Visa card   Upon checking registration desk printed hotel contract then explained additional $16 95 day amenities fee   Looking amenity shuttle airport shuttle shopping wifi phone calls   told clerk didn't need any those things because drove 550 miles own transportation   clerk advised mandatory fee   small print dont read Expedia mean really small print   having chat registration manager fee reduced 50%   Still happy   Courtyard room   roadside motel  type room   chair thats all   A C very loud almost intolerable   Beaware small print look another spot stay   Trust going do  <EOR> It wasn't good sign going buffet thug life surrounding exterior building but couldn't say no free buffet two won myvegas slots   The 3 hostess' took sweet time waiting 11 people line  1 them busy mixing frozen Margarita cash counter 1 them counting cash drawer 3rd directing people food floor   The food selection lunch good  All dry meat could ask for turkey ham pork pork loin   also salad bar taco bar rubbery chicken contest meat slop   Pros prepackaged desserts appeared sanitary   Cons found parasite mussel placed into mouth   Tips people considering place wear bullet proof vest protection bring ipecac induce vomiting avoid any food poisoning  <EOR> Me Man came Vegas Sema Show time Every time come Vegas Must Palace Station Oyster Bar Shit  Love It     Pan Roast Soup Plate all time twice Man treated twice funny first time some dude stole food leftovers playing but Man said long thief ate kool  <EOR> I would give hotel 2 5 stars if could  rooms bad given price pay for  However place just far everything else  visited over Fourth July weekend 100+ degrees every day  Since Palace Station Strip can't take bus hotel  There's no public transportation you'd take cab every time town  free shuttle service shopping center still Strip you'll switch bus but doesn't run very often  learned lesson now know 1 pick vacation destination consideration local weather aka perhaps July best time visit Vegas particularly if stay hotel  far everything else 2 choose accommodation only based price if far your daily activities sometimes end paying even more transportation costs if just pay slightly costlier hotel  more centrally located where walk where you'll during day   Plus cab fare Vegas ridiculously high and saying coming DC where cost living generally high   definitely worth frugal hotel then wind spending more cab fares not mention time wasted   Once decided save money and spend $50 every day taxis walk back night thought heat wouldn't bad then hotel intersection boulevard West Sahara Avenue  avid walker normally likes walk walk itself only took no more 30 minutes  However even though past 9pm temperature still uncomfortably high almost fainted way because heat dehydration  Thankfully made Landry's the seafood restaurant across Palace Station shortly began feel lightheaded  believe Palace Station caters more Vegas locals not tourists usually stay enclave Strip probably made wrong decision staying when ignored every factor other price learned lesson take more holistic view next time when planning trips   Nonetheless location still thing bugged most it fault choosing stay hotel's could've should've done research better prior arriving   When checked Friday night receptionist took debit card number told $16 79 service charge per night if used room services  careful use any service didn't even use wifi watch TV hesitated take shuttle until last day   Still when checked Monday early morning card charged $50 37 room service fee  noticed bill but didn't time inquire right spot because taxi waiting outside take airport  thought it'd easy just call ask later  When back home called them transferred account department  Even though during business hours no answered phone left voicemail detailing question asking them call number gave  never received call back refund  pretty sure said would charged only if used services which didn't  just annoying and hate companies having pay some nitty extra fees already included your booking  addition all along ambiguous service charge left alone wishing gone different place  <EOR> Courtyard room means trailerpark Don't fall ropadope  rooms disgusting  Needs step into century  complain upgrade more suitable room  Did want sleep place  philosophy OMG   Just disgusting <EOR> I hate hotel!! beds sleeping straight springs only two tiny pillows blanket super thin might well top sheet  elevator no where sight  room non smoking yet reeks cigarette smoke! staff clear where find room ended laundry room  Needless say am coming back here!!! all just within first hour being may more add but stayed long enough figure anything else  FYI pregnant happy! <EOR> Stayed King courtyard rooms  room really nice very large king size bed   All employees encountered really friendly helpful   looks hotel when going Vegas  food also awesome didn't need visit any other hotels meals  <EOR> The only plus oyster bar which tasted amazing writing separate review for   The rooms definitely cheap looking fridge leaking unplugged when there  Maybe defrosting? Hah sure   But didn't end using it   shower water temp flippant expect due toilet flushing other rooms etc  would hot cold warm never hot again   Internet wifi free   There's no elevators   Everything courtyard rooms need brought stairs   rooms some distance entrance   Walking through casino rooms passed bingo hall looked walking into mirrors end   Very trippy     Being north end still far strip even stratosphere riviera   would paid extra bucks stay strip since taking taxi cost just much     They offer shuttles fashion show mall airport but never figured where drop off pick station since told off corner outside   Vegas winter time doesn't offer time kindly round corners find right one    Nahhhhh  <EOR> I stayed Palace Station husband friends two days  Because surgery scooter accommodated handicap room  told Lana manager front desk because through Expedia guaranteed handicap room  although called prior stay notify front desk handicap  also notified front desk would coming difficult time would need room handicap  When front desk told no more handicap available  When called spoke Lana she told because handicapped didn't matter would accommodate me  Lana very rude very condescending belittling  speaking husband accommodations handicap he told front desk told no handicap available  When spoke Lana she told  front desk vocabulary she does believe anyone front desk would say that  Again condescending belittling  don't personally recommend stay Palace Station if your disabled handicapped physically challenged  God bless take care <EOR> It's tough disappointed someplace where price damn cheap but much tried still was   Booked two rooms Courtyard 1511 1516 Feb 22 25th 2016 three others  All ever wanted hotel Las Vegas bed shower place store crap because really spends much time there? bed springy but able sleep without issue give plus  shower however gets three minuses because laughably bad  head topped 5ft height nozzles old rusted water pressure barely trickle  Regulating temperature also juggling act  safe place store stuff guess plus because didn't broken into robbed   Gaming okay lot older some newer machines well $3 craps boatload asian themed table games   The buffet absolute garbage am generally very picky  other food choices untried although Charcoal Room looked smelled good   All in all barely passable Guy's Vegas Trip but wouldn't take significant other under any circumstances  <EOR> I usually comp'd Tower room which pretty decent  time comp'd Courtyard room which more prison! no elevators ramps drag your luggage stairs if your room isn't first floor  aren't even any directional signs tell which many hallways should take  Instead there's map entrance memorize venture into labrynth rooms   When did finally room expected see few things 1 roaches scattering across floor when turned light 2 opening armoir having dead body fall 3 security banging door saying lights out! Thankfully seen none but still hasn't eased comfort level ridiculous Courtyard room  actually did effort remodel rooms I'm assuming few modern bathroom fixtures tiling but there's even bathtub!!

Those know know would choose eat buffet  However when your child tells he would really breakfast buffet before leave Vegas try comply    So 10am called around see which places still serving breakfast buffet  wasn't gonna Bellagio because only eat few items hardly worth spend $20 $30 bucks eat bacon sausage peel eat shrimp maybe 2 pieces toast   I told place serving brunch even driving hearing 'I dinner buffet once when wasted thought sucked   Everything body should've told STOP but anyway   The brunch buffet weekends $10 99 adults $8 99 kids between 4 10 years age  If players card $2 less  did  players card ended paying $8 99 adult $6 99 kid   I wasn't hopeful all  fact such low expectations actually pleasantly surprised! buffet clean laid spaciously  place just looked neat tidy unlike Orleans' French Market Buffet which now knock down star coming    The sausages very tasty unlike those Orleans bacon cooked perfectly  young man started that  egg station where omelettes fried eggs cooked order  When ventured further really happy see peel eat shrimp well far better fresher! Orleans  cocktail sauce also hell lot tastier!  I ended trying bratwurst sauerkraut  really good even though didn't look good tasted  even tried menudo  bleh tasted water no flavor all  liked both grits cream wheat although grits clumpy thick taste    There ham carving station Mexican food comprising beans rice tortillas toppings killer spicy grilled jalapenos hash browns nicely cooked  crunchy top soft under  food regularly replaced didn't messed look them  biggest issue buffets when trays food look they'd tampered with    I highly impressed lifted trays food cleaned sides replaced trays  did often enough everything looked really clean   By time done firing grill hamburgers which made order! bad full try one  also desserts ice cream but no didn't try any either   The weekend brunch also offers champagne but I'd bit wary drinking champagne brunch costs less $10  However if you're don't really dig myriad items lay high end buffets then perhaps right place you! know next time raise nose air look down upon cheap buffets because really exceeded expectations  But then again considering only foods eat buffets maybe really having expectations all!  For price thought pretty damn good! don't upset giving them 4 stars  comparing place your high end buffets! its own class buffets I'd say pretty good! Far better Orleans buffet lunch which $7 50  but shrimp wasn't fresh cocktail sauce nowhere near good Palace Station! <EOR> Began long arduous trek Los Angeles Wisconsin late day Monday 27th   no idea where when would stop but found self exiting I15 Sahara last second decision lay down old haunts Palace Station   called phone soon pulled into parking lot sure rooms left day walked front desk without reservation  checked into tower room within twenty five minutes   Unfortunately saddened find Palace Station lost its mojo same place used stay play regularly since tower first opened early '90's through last stay couple years ago   I need into multiple issues hotel Tower room but hitting four most annoying highlights 1   Safe locked no power  2   lavatory bathroom sink strong sewer ish odor coming literally made bathroom stink  3   WIFI down  4  shower head barely allowed thin spray water made bathing time consuming tedious effort   I made multiple attempts notify front desk way room phone using Front Desk button but instead going front desk calls hotel operator automated answering system put hold several minutes   OK   tried several other service buttons phone try live person but same thing calls hotel operator automated answering system   Enough said   Sorry Palace Station   Note management U guys really need step your game fix problems! <EOR> This review ARCADE   My girlfriend job interview Palace Station thought would kill time arcade while she doing thing  learned important lesson place DOES CARE ARCADE MACHINES   I popped two tokens Police Trainer machine  Ate tokens   I play House Dead  Gun aiming horribly off center and shooter real life can't attributed own incompetence  I play Star Wars Trilogy  JOYSTICK BROKEN cursor stuck right side screen    And then play crane machine  controls sluggish hardly responsive all    Not mention every game TWO token cost exception few cost little more  arcade only quarter size those other Station Casinos  Granted nice area but few games choose little doesn't work right    Save your money before play any games here  If you're 21 older just stick slot machine  gamble whether any machine even work right!

But literally pay couple extra 10's stay luxury tower  bed extremely springy room pretty cramped oh roach room  lol gross    The hotel overall pretty decent exactly find most hotels but many reward benefits ** BUT huge plus side restaurant downstairs specials hotel guests which amazing deal 1 99 skillets 2 eggs 2 pieces toast 2 hashbrowns oh also quarter pound burger fries also 1 99  night drinking would come back eat your sorrows away such cheap price    The other pros consistent overall cheap buffet pretty nice variety selections guy subway a middle eastern fellow extremely friendly willing microwave some leftover food us! also some cheap drinks $1 margaritas extremely nice bus service takes strip    overall would give place around 3 3 stars so  some nice benefits but hotel's standards primarily held rooms amenities would recommend but only luxury tower  <EOR> Review Casino Food areas only   cannot speak hotel   Whenever visit LV often come Palace Station because popular casino locals I relatives live area    quite honest admit am crazy place   Firstly casino area incredibly dark little dirty weird dank smell it   just gross   big into gambling here   Drinks food Drinks incredibly inexpensive   only buffet upstairs which offers great value but food just OK time wrong labels or no labels all next offerings   Because ended pouring cocktail sauce all over tostadas thinking red salsa   Also Chinese food offerings just plain unbeautiful   orange chicken discoloured flavourless fried rice just   not fried all   best tasting meal bunch chicken parm   Dessert section pretty decent great variety cakes pastries plus ice cream bar   only unfortunate part if you're glutton such myself won't room dessert and no can't take you      So there's that    <EOR> I don't think ever written bad review but warrants it  paid $290 three nights place when room scene worst nightmares  only heard bad hotel experiences never wildest dreams life ever experience such bad hotel room let say this  am very very flexible person  uppity all  cool staying st motel 6 long clean good condition  Let list problems  Walk courtyard section hotel rooms which told oldest area hotel  wreaks vanilla all walkways cover odor  pleasant vanilla but overbearing one  room carpet stained heavily just stain mean every main traffic area room stained  carpet old  furniture old varnish falling off just piece furniture but all them nightstand desk armoire entertainment piece  started taking photos came across sock nightstand  partner saw sock while ground just decided lift bed skirt garbage dirt dust underneath  mean real garbage WTF   walls damage paint coming off  Carpet corner coming up  Cigarette stains burns wood furniture  Bed creaked sat could feel springs your hands just underneath bedding  could hear full conversations next door room  shock  front desk offered upgrade $20 per night stay tower which bit better but still just worth it  stayed west gate room $10 less night no joke 100 times better even its age westgate great condition  photos videos experience post them soon  <EOR> This casino isn't favorites  just little off strip does $5 paigow table  usually just sit enjoy playing few hands while enjoying nice cold corona  Thing if $5 table full much really but sit around wait  casino doesn't paigow insurance usually play hands always bad   Anyways casino also bit small but OK looking  Still seems bit old fashioned much fan old fashioned looking casinos  did come few times no disappointment me  Besides them taking money which all casinos do still pleasurable experience  But I'd much rather play another casino  can't really rate nice clean rooms never even stayed but just based few times only deserves OK rating  <EOR> i am shocked see low stars bad reviews! this place great! i really bad taking time review places but am putting end now i never stayed older courtyard rooms understand them kind icky old BUT stayed several times luxury tower rooms  the rooms tower VERY clean VERY modern  these rooms beyond great value! i NEVER issue cleanliness hotel   ever  housekeeping great very accommodating  the gals front desk extremely kind very helpful   the staff general extremely impressive aside person  the breakfast buffet absolutely delicious tremendous deal  my husband likes stay specifically reason he wake stumble down favorite breakfast buffet lol  with players card pay $4 99 buffet often received complimentary buffet breakfast room price  the new cafe delicious another tremendous value! again am sure why other reviews awful but place amazing  we always stay first night longer stay vegas other larger resort type hotels  we always stay luxury resort hotels strip vacations 3 4 times per year but ALWAYS stay first night palace station because just love it  if hotel larger property more activities other gambling would consider staying through entire trip  this says lot considering caliber hotels used staying at  i highly recommend anyone stay if book luxury tower suite  the luxury tower suite runs average $28 00 per night when book advance which opinion ridiculously great deal! <EOR> The room great tower room  added security use your room card elevator anywhere which like  room itself great view very clean air conditioning which helpful hot weather  I would give more stars but far slots games Palace Station giving any money back even put 200 00   Next Time if opportunity stay just sleep take shuttle strip walk across street Wynn where alot more luck  <EOR> The rating given hotel doesn't seem fair me  Cheap food short lines amiable staff POKER room onsite   sooooo happy picked Hotel!
