You MUST trip VooDoo! second trip Vegas most favorite experience FAR!!! I would also recommend having dinner first Boozio's located Casino then heading VooDoo dinner cocktails   this perfect evening! <EOR> This club okay  Just okay  made last minute decision clubbing Saturday night ended because price cheap  Door staff seemed friendly view awesome  crowd mostly adult wide age range going there  Very few youngsters Saturday night  Pricey drinks everywhere else Vegas lack seating dance floor space looses 2 stars  many tables empty but don't even think unless you've paid table bottle service  ended leaving earlier wanted because nowhere sit give feet rest  return <EOR> Two words low budget   Sad  used really cool club great view  need work upping clientele  If you're nicely dressed classy female need find another place hang weekend  <EOR> Came dinner drink check view   ride elevator amazing enough but view outside outstanding literally see everything Vegas     Only drawback Rio obviously very far strip   Hint took free shuttle Harrah's which near enough hotel which took five minutes cost nothing     Worth checking those witchdoctors sure looked good! <EOR> Great music great view diverse crowd excellent flair bartenders!  more want?  today's standards absolute bargain! <EOR> This nightclub great view but all  If you're guy expect pay $30 just take elevator trip top  thought gender based pricing illegal America  didn't pay free night staying hotel thank God that    I around midnight many already wasted $20 drinks  dancing lame best  exceedingly crampt outside drunk zombies walking dancing around  many old guys lurking corners   Not type crowd all  gone under 20mins  horrible waste time  <EOR> The drink choice witch doctor   drink 64onces drops dry ice it   witch dr side effects   best friend ended dance'n girls bigger madeout ladie 50 years old   Good drinks nice view but bit off strip   Older bar its jam packed lax rain  <EOR> My experiences all two them VooDoo Lounge great! first time large work function never saw price tag anything which great cause eat whatever wanted   always someone willing buy rounds  really part remember  decor really fun  Oh wait!

Seriously doesn't better that!   I lot fun here    I back  <EOR> Voodoo sky deck nightclub nice  Promoter Chippendale's area gave ladies free pass plus free drink but would hook fiance ladies only   fiance paid $30 Saturday night  Drinks expensive  indoor space 2 outdoor spaces  Both outdoor spaces nice awesome views Strip  think club waaaay better Playboy Moon both  Palms  <EOR> This favorite place eat Vegas   cannot view   it definitely prettiest opinion   yes even better Top World Strat!

There's steak!  I all lounge part but since missed steak give 3 stars until give go   So friends stumble into Rio last Saturday night try new theater nightclub Crown   the only saving grace place hired pole dancer actually did more shake booty   she did some pole tricks  left meat market stumbled onto something more intriguing    The VooDoo lounge     mysterious check dark check on roof top overlooking strip check non meat market vibe check good tunes good people check  This place definitely made night  good mix people more laid back vibe which better experience  view killer weather perfect  I'd definitely want spend another Vegas night here    or least end here  dance outside 2 dancefloors tunes just right  stairs bit challenge heels next time try wear something more forgiving feet    I'd even more impressed find steaks killer here! Now only if could include Steak each Lounge experience! <EOR> Voodoo Lounge might possibly easiest club into Las Vegas   good thing easily bad thing   good thing place very chill spot doesn't overwhelmed hordes people staff relatively friendly door bar   best thing course undeniably only reason some folks may come fantastic view Las Vegas   The bad little more overwhelming good   start place dated decor uber cheesy looks super cheap result   crowd closer middle age'd generation anything under 35   Music vary depending night but its nothing good enough lounge exciting enough bust move   Prices suspect depending type drink bottle service recommended all   should able free passes printed website why chance risk purchasing bottle group? <EOR> I two words classy looking great view great culinary spot DRESS CODE Came wifey birthdays coinciding national unemployment weekend holiday September  Place nice dim lit comfy booths  Food terrific  Yes expensive but thats get  Free access club upstairs which sucks ass but great 51st floor outdoor view  Yes early club but 20 year old mashed hip hop even some R+B crap made wanna puke  fellow yelpers insist witch doctor didnt wanna pay $30 per person drink find when very nice glass red wine $13  We ordered wedge salad cold seafood platter surf turf shrimp  Portions arent gonna fill anyone hearty appetite but quality borderline spectacular  waiter very attentive adrian?

Voodoo hasn't changed much past 5 years except going cheap drinks over packing club VIP sections unused which totally annoying if you're trying see view without bunch drunk asses running into you     The DJs consistently good very very mixed crowd  However only keep coming back view doesn't compare anything else  Ghost Bar nothing place    Also over years award winning flair bartending leveled off I think saw bottle throw whole time nearly show used which really disappointing  If ever chance catch episode Three Sheets Spike where Zane Vegas you'll see mean  show filmed several years ago even see Witch Doctor flair way better now    For newcomers think great place least see once just because view amazing  However those going back over over again turning into huge disappointment    For Restaurant dined several times price wise runs same any other high end steak house you'd find strip  Mostly ate convenience since selection Rio isn't greatest food  service reasonably decent food good however if dinner going cost around $100 person want wowed  whole experience didn't seem 5 star dining when Strip House wow! way   servers friendly but only slightly knowledgeable wine list seemed wasn't enough coverage tables which made dinner take forever  don't really remember much more which disappointing because wish more memorable price paid  done that won't back Voodoo Steak when there's many better options same price  <EOR> Inside Club ok  outside nightclub roof awesome! Cool old school music view amazing  Even though 29f outside very nice heaters which worked pretty good  don't think anyone cold because drunk  great time  <EOR> This review Voodoo Steak night club  wagyu rib eye amazing cooked perfectly seasoned perfection  If want your steak cooked anything more medium rare Sizzler no executive chef going kill $60 steak cooking hour  <EOR> Note Inside Rio Hotel   I am frequent Night club visitor any means but Las Vegas industry awards dinner did win award course celebrate party peers   no idea view amazing rooftop bar   blew mind beautiful   drinks very tasty   bottle service table inside it little chilly even Reno girl stay outside long unless outside dancing large group treated well staff    They photographer take your photo then purchase if like   She great shot something could show bosses without any embarrassment later too   Better any could take    The place crowded sure hard keep floors restrooms clean but would only minus weren't bad all   Go view!! <EOR> Rooftop view amazing lounge live music great  Quick elevator ride going down  no dress code  21 over  You'll notice locals tourists around world here  There's $10 00 cover charge if Rio guest but well worth amazing view fun atmosphere  <EOR> I love outdoor scene interior design standard well done club corporate setting aka let anyone conventioneers locals your mom etc  hippest most beautiful crowd  Also people just freakin love those cigars vibe laid back enough talk cigars but really turns off  might cigar haven others  Kinda square vibe great music but safe place party clients if they're staying Rio  <EOR> The view AMAZING! Worth if only snap selfie overlooking whole strip  Wasn't fan music   average   great twenties age range   drinks pricy but outside seating overlooking strip made everything! <EOR> i LOVE place! why low stars people?   however would only drinks BEFORE starting night vegas  dont think i'd ever past 8pm   it's kinda far away all way across freeway Rio  but totally worth it  beautiful view  there's nobody early sortof take over lounge  bartenders super friendly easy talk to   TIP order witch doctor  delicious give nice buzz carry over into dinner your first drink hte club  share 3 4 people  basically giant bubbling cauldron delicious rum  yum rum    and danielle sunday night open bar pass sounds GREAT deal! <EOR> VEGAS MISS YOU!!!
