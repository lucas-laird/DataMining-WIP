As food itself    I've never Honduran fare before can't speak authentic was  food good though outstanding  Although well seasoned pork very dry tostones needed some dipping sauce flavor  <EOR> I died bay heaven El Rincon Honduereño  kid remember eating real Pastelitos call them Empanadas don't believe them Pastelitos ones made shrimp kid just simply delicious here  Pollo Fritos true Catracho interpretation tajaditas  All all price low quality high  Very tasty all around  must visit your Las Vegas trip next time  <EOR> My favorite place popusas Honduran specialties baliadas south American tamales  Cheap eats but cheap taste ever  service feels home music little loud but hey it! culture happy loud top off now karaoke nights  Great open minded people looking try great cultural food  <EOR> Central America may small but diversity food superb! restaurant offers different Central American dishes such great taste! Everything breakfast dishes lunch large dinner dishes!   You never wrong some Salvadorian Pupusas favorite cheese Pupusas if want try some Honduran food highly recommend Pollo con tajadas which means Chicken Banana Chips! far most juiciest tastiest most colorful delicious dish ever taste consists chicken course Fried banana chips Covered cabbage red onion special sauce!   For breakfast never wrong Salvadorian Casamiento rice mixed red beans scrambled eggs veggies side sour cream cheese some fried Bananas!   The restaurant itself very well kept Karaoke weekends dance floor!   The only downside take good while bring your food order then again all Central American restaurants same  Won't stop coming back  <EOR> I craving Latin food but am very disappointed  chicken soup ok but veggies tasted they're bad  also ordered Honduran plate steak  meat cheap bad  Very overseasoned  Plantains sweet seemed they've fried more once  back  $25 food  <EOR> A must Las Vegas  place closed while quick remodel glad its back opened    even improved food presentation   Highly recommend place group friends enjoy awesome dinner  <EOR> SE PASAN los fines de semana con los precios  $9 por un trago de ron con Coca Cola  Platos básicos típicos más de $20 cada uno que entre semana cuestan mitad de precio  El lugar no se presta para baile aunque la radio que toca en vivo la hace parecer como que fuera un lugar grande con ambiente  Todo lo conftrario es un lugar exageradamente pequeño completamente lo contrario que se representa en la radio    Way expensive weekends get  $9 rum coke  Simple basic plates doubled price weekends  Entire restaurant small  radio station overly hypes location  Music radio FAR better location itself  simply some hole wall  Food descent however  Don't mind paying good money really good place atmosphere  Sadly place charges way much is  <EOR> I'd rate 4 5 stars but YELP won't let me  came breakfast morning around 10ish really good    When walked allowed pick seating server quick give menus offer drinks  whipped crappy Spanish he didn't seem bothered which nice some people offended when try speak language fail   whoops     I ordered coffee fiance ordered tamarindo  time drinks ready order  coffee tiny! looked served tea set something kinda cute  Then noticed other patrons beside also ordered coffee two regular sized cups   what?  Our food came relatively fast homemade food  both scrambled eggs tomatoes onions fresh sliced avocado fried plantains  fiance's food came refried beans crema cream while mine came casamientos whole beans rice mixed together   Both really delicious  also brought some tortillas hecho mano hand made which delicous perfectly cooked  Mine also came chorizo Mexican sausage but tiny little piece significant enough price jump between two dishes    Downside? tiny cup coffee finished well before halfway done food  didn't come check while time did really thirsty  fresh pot coffee understandable mornings but then guy spilled all over table saucer cup then left    wtf? Thought kinda funny seeing would offered napkin new saucer wiped up      Overall food coffee drank delicious  Would liked them check bit more regarding refills I drank half fiance's tamarindo while waiting more coffee never gave anymore offered water didn't give opportunity ask coffee incident   waiting check few minutes finished stacked plates piled mess restroom etc  never came  waited until saw another guest walk register decided head front though its bit odd sit down restaurant    Would come again food but prepared ask refills advance specify want I thought sausage would different should asked shame   recommend food  usually can't bear eat eggs because taste smell funny but great  Job well done  <EOR> Este lugar no sirve  No gaste su dinero  No saben cocinar comida hondurena  Es mas comida salvadorena y mexicana    Q verguensa  Local es sucio  Nunca jamas vuelvo venir <EOR> This place looks taco shop outside but sit down place waitress service  When walked immediately realized only white guy joint which always good sign   The chips fantastalicious mexi cheese salsa already them when hit table  Cool! ordered two asada tacos phenomenal street food type along sides rice beans  All along Diet Coke set back less $9  Smokin' deal!
