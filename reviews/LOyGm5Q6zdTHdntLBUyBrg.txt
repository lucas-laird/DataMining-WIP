Extremely rude woman works drive thru   She rude car behind said Oh GD No! left   Someone decent took over handled rest order but returning   orders usually wrong having deal rude staff member just much   There multiple food eateries road would recommend friends choose any other well known chains over location   reason no line empty parking lot     <EOR> I asked all food fresh all food cold cheese didn't even melt  French fries soggy nuggets cold  Gave barbecue when all said ranch  customer service shitty unwelcoming  fix ketchup pump  Trays left tables napkins everywhere  <EOR> Worst location besides Charleston rainbow     every     SINGLE     TIME     cold stale food absolutely ZERO personality when taking order   There's always issue never fixed! They've given half full fries worst Version taco salad ever seen     I'd say 80 times maybe 5 decent  Wendy's itself some good deals tasty food though TRULY miss old fries  softer Wendy's fries  Yummmmm  <EOR> I'm sure other bad reviews but never problem here  Wendy's only fast food burger place eat location best  burgers fries taste better McDonald's Burger King  Every time eaten cashiers friendly never made mistake order  Food good  Tables kept clean   all need! <EOR> Don't eat unless stomach receipt salad  Terrible quality control  <EOR> I haven't months came cause wanted great burger  mother law did too  service great beginning end especially because taking while deciding wanted  food fast fresh  Why did ever stop coming here!

No okay   ! Coming specifically taco salad having tortilla chips unacceptable! gonna dump chili into salad bowl add salsa? No okay    The restaurants should inventory hand especially when introducing new menu item     sad your inventory only thru lunch rush    'dinner time' menu items unavailable   known certainly would visited    This location continues fall short customer satisfaction     smh <EOR> The staff way nicer then year ago but husband same sandwich could obviously tell sandwich fresh other old  Now staff updated friendly weird creepy now update service  crew friendly but then forgot drinks then gave old chicken sandwich expired salad only four people smiled  would willing back but if food isn't fresh don't serve it  <EOR> My experience stared 1 star because tables where dirty did order order wrong but nice manager named Keisha sad she sorry made right please clean your tables looks nasty inside just might order next time walk burger king least know tables clean <EOR> Tuesday May 9th 2017 5 30 PM  I seen commercial million times limited time chicken Mozzarella salad   finally tried definitely worth $6 50    chunks chicken mozzarella   basil pesto great touch loved most!    croutons sea salt garlic pepper   vingarette Okay    wished more basil pesto    I ordered salad take location around corner  Easier leave back around back side Albertsons but live West Flamingo  <EOR> The food fresh F$ @!

Needless say NEVER return back AGAIN    Sad give them star still but if could deserve negative star  <EOR> Let teach proper drive thru etiquette order 2 combos don't just give total probably should ask anything else just tell total tell attendant wasn't finished then completed order window attendant arguing someone reassembled manager making more dishes witch worries because ever change trays utensils then pick window given some greeting passed bag attendant walks away doesn't say anything check bags see missing sit he comes back still waiting finally comes back 2 minutes final bag no time just looks idiot doesn't ask if need condiments doesn't say anything along lines great night no just looks particularly didn't 2 plain clothes people behind counter managers owners ill never know if allow service while they're  pretty pathetic <EOR> The service fine  fact cashier actually pretty friendly  But if thing cause never back is     When order something specific all way home find wrong  into trash    8 bucks down drain    yourself bowl cereal   Now all talk folks working fast food think should making $15 hr exactly why don't   instruction hold mayo failed  <EOR> The cashier appeared 15 years old  Seemed lost  sick new BBQ pulled pork sandwich burped all day  Everyone guests acted drugs  left freaked disgusted  huge Wendy's fan too  won't location very long time if ever back  Also junior bacon cheese burgers use $1 39 raised price $1 99   rude loyal customers can't called value meanie anymore either!!!!! upset!

Definitely felt little cheated Wendy's combos little more pricey then its competitors being said all food enjoyable still  <EOR> Ordered two medium frostys two small  rarely ever eat burgers hungry probably won't ever hungry again one  Awful location  <EOR> My husband ate dining room area today  clean nice view strip  would especially thank Maggie excellent service! some coupons use some allergies order bit more complicated  She double checked order accuracy remained calm friendly even though lady behind line starting stomp foot impatience  food came moment done ordering  Hot fresh which great because starving! Thanks Maggie Wendy's team fast excellent service! <EOR> First off love Wendy's kills review store such negative light    It apparent upon standing line behind two people cashier new just little uncomfortable working register herself need much more training before being left alone    It took over 15 minutes process two orders which single senior citizen only wanted single cheese cup coffee   I other hand ordered $35 worth value meals salad Bacon Cheddar baked potato  value meals OK but gave wrong type potato wrong type salad  did check right quantity but didn't check foe small details part fault but all it   With all those value meals managers she wearing red shirt comparison regular grunts asked if wanted drink carrier? heck she expecting guy carry all food drinks himself?   When Fiancée called complain male answered phone saying he manager  When middle aged lady white shirt walking around even came give senior citizen discount  Don't know why phone wasn't handed real manager but sure he going tell manager co workers screwed large order  Yeah right he tell sure back IE never! <EOR> Same famous hamburgers fries all other Wendy's  Clean fast affordable  <EOR>
