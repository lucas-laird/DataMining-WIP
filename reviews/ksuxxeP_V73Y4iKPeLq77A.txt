Like said price wise breakfast awesome  Under 7 bucks just everything good portions  Lunch dinner definitely more expensive but bad compared other strip restaurants  If you're staying Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile shops come good breakfast deal  If vicinity   somewhere else    But all being said    come just every day every vegas trip  <EOR> If looking pseudo Mexican place one  live California expect two things any authentic Mexican restaurant 1 Free chips salsa 2 good home made salsa  neither  charge chips when asked special salsa offered Cholula come Mexican place without home made salsa? should change marketing stop deceiving patrons! <EOR> I sick food  I should read yelp reviews before deciding lunch here   My girlfriend fish tacos asked no cheese lactose intolerant   brought dish cheese  apologized let them know she allergic cheese needed dish remade  server said ok we'll new dish A few minutes later brought dish out  sliver cheese messy sauce top  just removed cheese instead making new dish!!  So notified manager  If she just didn't cheese couldn't silly reason would let pass  But she cannot slightest bit dairy    took seriously    I don't recommmend place  Auntie Anne's pretzel instead <EOR> The food absolutely disgusting! Extremely salty horrible service  took 2 bites food told them didn't want it  didn't even offer if wanted anything else if food okay  still pay which kinda disappointing since barely even touched it  ate lunch but hear breakfast good  Anyways definitely never eat restaurant again  am highly disappointed service quality food  <EOR> La Salsa Cantina buried back Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops but great breakfast specials before noon  $3 99 2 eggs potatoes choice meat 2 tortillas $0 99 bloody marys  food simple but hearty bloody mary fine it only 8 ounces but prices few    We able seat open area front restaurant which offers good views people passing sport's bar across walkway small fountain choreographed music  atmosphere loud   since right walkway but very good people watching   Our service fine  very quick busy when asked spicy bloody he brought extra hot sauce   I wish would discovered place earlier visit Las Vegas   a great place start day save some cash  <EOR> After walking another restaurant Miracle Mile we're seated drinks within 5 minutes   Hurray good service   shrimp tacos good but some edges tortillas sort dry hard stale   why didn't give 5 stars  <EOR> My coworkers really wanted Mexican food never would stepped foot place   It's hard find jammed back corner Caesars Uber pickup area  only six tables four waitstaff  would think ratio would good service but some reason would vaporize soon needed them  ask check four times before someone actually brought it  Between food drop off asking check saw waiter once behind bar   The margarita tasty hence 2 stars but barely any alcohol it  nachos decent but whole experience just really meh   Las Vegas cannot meh  <EOR> Here why La Salsa Cantina should your breakfast destination CHEAP  $5 eggs potato meat tortilla deal  $5!!!! full plate!!!!

You'd margarita? You'd happy hour margarita? Oh only if frozen    Wait what? only 'happy hour' priced margarita if frozen if exact same drink rocks $6 extra? Wtf  Just cheat alcohol?

Isn't anything else sir? cloying attitude made feel strip mall theme restaurant but else expect description Mexican fare  Indeed  exactly you'll far below cuisine just short food  <EOR> The food decent  Service decent  Cockroaches extra  Disgusting  Never again! <EOR> Good Mexican place Planet Hollywood shops   Food quite good    bit odd charged extra some more salsa   Would eat again  <EOR> Came breakfast    waitress very nice attentive  chilequiles little salty beans horrible but overall good experience  <EOR> We came breakfast  Understaffed which left much desired terms if service but warned upon entry behind  Great food but plate came warm hot  Great chilaquiles Mexican scramble despite temp  Amazing breakfast drinks boozy coffee Hot Tamale Maria  Would come back breakfast if plenty time spare  last addition great photographer coming around offering free photo  Ours turned great free thumb size purchased 4x6 $20  <EOR> I breakfast special price can't wrong  Plus margaritas VERY good! Everyone table ordered standard breakfast items nothing special review but everything cooked well tasted good  Again don't expect gastronomic meal if you're paying $5 10     place for  <EOR> Well safe say majority reviewers right when said authentic Mexican food  usually see things myself since deal dinner show chose place Vegas show which must see!   Anyway made reservation because going come during dinner rush 6 45 figured they'd packed it'd plenty time 9 00 show  around 6 45 6 50 place barely anyone seated quickly  Once told them deal waitress quickly snatched menus gave limited menu  wanted anyway but didn't appreciate she snatched menus that  food came pretty quickly but food smoking hot but plate which little odd  ordered chicken enchiladas fianc ordered grande steak burrito  No chips came meal 1st issue  #2  food hot  #3  made homemade enchiladas before clearly used La Preferida red enchilada sauce can  Major disappointment  Why hell would come pay food pulled can?
