Because always seem rip off  only service slow  Prices high below average taste  portions extremely small price  also surprising many people still frequent Filipino restaurants Bay Area Filipino realize things just mentioned  Perhaps blinded skewed fact supporting local Filipino business maybe because can't cook Filipino food  must latter because Filipinos take much pride cooking those know cook dishes won't think twice criticize same dish made someone else theirs always better  Am right? guess your quick fix Filipino food plenty choices Bay Area but suffer previously mentioned  If Filipino chains mostly buying Birthday cake other pastries  ship buying regular entrees long sailed  thankful parents other relatives cook authentic Filipino dishes  ashame future generation Filipinos don't even know speak Tagalog think good Filipino food price  If price lower portions grander sure no problem  But portions small most if all food seems just heated hell  they no shame showing just microwave them  add insult injury Goldilocks I'm sure if still practice weigh food la carte dishes palabok  Now why Filipino owned businesses chains wonder why only Filipinos stores restaurants?
