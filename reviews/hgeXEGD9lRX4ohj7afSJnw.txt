To management owner take note customer service MEANS something  you've lost customer and anyone tell   <EOR> This far best Thai place Vegas eaten far especially price quantity ratio  pad Thai ordered today very generous plate other Thai places would consider dinner price would charge $10+ for  Thai Style Noodle House only charges $6 95! Shrimp only 7 95   Noodles perfect spice level perfect texture tagged delicious  big fan Thai food spicy food large portions would definitely recommend place! Additionally service quick plenty variety menu  Two reasonably large dishes would only put your bill around $15 00 $20 00 easily double value most restaurants nowadays  <EOR> Nice clean restaurant  Very good service nice people  first Thai food tried since coming back visiting Thailand  food least good better any food Thailand  Everything tasted great  all very fresh  duck fried rice pad thai orange chicken sweet sticky rice ice cream  definitely place come again  Can't wait try more dishes  excellent job  <EOR> First impressions immediately noticed peculiar Barney color purple paint grey tufted booth seating  Along far left wall three more booths offer more privacy  kind having your own VIP section  regal wooden paneling envelops side restaurant dotted white tufted single chairs  know they're trying look modern but comes off disjointed more beauty salon look    but hey least clean!   Food course bf ordered chicken yellow curry  review dish skimped chicken used sweet potatoes instead regular ones  Fair enough  pad see ewe tofu  give option soft fried latter  Let just say probably best pad see ewes had! Yeah really! just right portion sprinkle some type fried garlic top  Price wise they're little bit cheaper comparable Thai places quite surprised    Service good  could better considering literally only other table besides but workers seem own breaks? sure but I'd definitely wouldn't rule them out  We'll back!
