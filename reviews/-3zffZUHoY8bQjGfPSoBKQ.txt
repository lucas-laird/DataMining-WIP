restaurant located beautiful floral atrium almost next most impressive chocolate fountain ever seen  But  besides point  eats   At $175 for chef's menu price point young easily impressed now know better see JR review   But arrogant menu does include beautiful hardcover autographed book $60 value  worth $115 chef's tasting menu roughly food alone   The amuse bouche clam chowder without any clams visible  Vegetables yes clams no    The tuna tartare tasty however wasn't anything special hadn't before  famous lobster pot pie let down because pastry pot pie should flaky puff pastry  thick gumminess biscuit coating big turnoff  American Kobe Beef 3 ways kind obnoxious when there's only three rather thin slices beef your plate    The best dish night black cod miso broth cod buttery done

better price point  reason 3 stars  <EOR> Delicious Food Expensive Bad service Ok atmosphere   The negatives drop rating 5 stars 3 stars   delicious creative food what's carrying 3 star rating  <EOR> Classy top notch restaurant despite hustle bustle casino just outside doors     Tuna tar tar fantastic nicely seasoned little spice seranos  Touch class finishing preparation table   Salmon buttery also well seasoned sat top light creamy vegetable medley    Wanted dessert but pace myself unlike atm visits blackjack tables  <EOR> I ordered chef's tasting menu food great clear lot thought into each dish  kind thoughtfulness  rare even fine dining days  ratio main components sides sauces perfect  wasn't thrilled few things  steak wasn't served hot enough its accompanying sauce sitting formed skin  waiter although nice friendly enough spent most time chatting next table   So ate Ahi Tuna Tartar Delicious  Each component tuna bell peppers bosc pears portioned sliced perfection  Flavor well balanced excellent didn't even need accompanying slices bread   Lobster pot pie little misleading call pot pie since essentially lobster soup bowl thin puff pastry cover  Nonetheless delicious  Good sized chunks lobster rich wine y broth divine   Kobe steak fingerling potatoes crispy shallots cheese sauce Incredibly tender juicy seared perfect medium rare  I'd liked see more crispy shallots but since essentially garnish ok only few strings it  said steak wasn't quite served hot enough cheese sauce skin top  But still ate still yummy   Dessert pecan fudge pecan choc chip cookies marshmallow dipped chocolate graham cracker crumbs vanilla mousse stuffed wafers root beer float highlight meal much more savory foods dessert foods person  small portions several kinds dessert all big plate  mini root beer float perfect touch whimsy really refreshing when paired chocolatey items  <EOR> As far tasting menus Las Vegas would say does rank high honest opinion  dined Michael Minna San Francisco much better meal did considering Vegas Bellagio hoping more   Everyone group decided tasting menu which price expensive 4 courses $98 wine pairing another $55   However upgraded tasting menu

satisfying comforting    far lobster pot pie goes   True cooking lobster pot 18 20 minutes may slightly rubbery but lobster texture far more any other crustacean anyway   the flavors amazing   Definitely heavy dish which why shared husband's just ordered couple sides which great   You're going spend lot money anyway   so additional charge lobster pot pie well worth it   Cocktails wonderful    Superb food service LOVED waiter ambiance  <EOR> To honest personally might made effort try one star Michelin rated Michael Mina tucked away corner Bellagio Conservatory Botanical Gardens if sizable gambling winnings Las Vegas Restaurant Week   Fortunately unfortunately  ? latter case   For being such fancy schmancy dining establishment quite bit noise hustle bustle going here   kitchen line

<EOR> While service Michael Mina top notch something dishes left feeling experience just so so   My friends came Vegas planning see Absinthe across street decided Michael Mina based high reviews relative distance show   Given excellent variety comes tasting menu decent price $115 all decided Seasonal Signature Tasting Menu     I personally chose Signature Tasting Menu which lot great sounding options but ultimately left slightly disappointed   menu thoughts Domestic Caviar Parfait Delicately plated much parfait layer salmon caviar potato cake dish pretty knockout way start meal   inherent richness salmon saltiness caviar balanced well against potato cake creamy creme fraiche    Tartare Ahi Tuna solid blocks ahi tuna mixed tableside sesame seed oil dish seemed little note me   helped pieces pear pine nuts add different flavor notes but sesame oil seemed little heavy handed overwhelming taste experienced   Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass really enjoyed dish!

Some entrees came cold over seasoned cooked wrong wine pairings disappointing desserts uninspired  All all would say many other great places dine Vegas waste time money there  scene isn't even worthwhile   The only tasty thing Miso glazed black cod but would hardly think  redeeming factor  <EOR> Can't recommend it  4 star food 2 star service but better $100+ per head    We party 8 four couples Saturday night  server really indifferent right go  No smiling no personality  Borderline unfriendly unpleasant  didn't better meal on  slammed huge crowd either  Other table attendants water bread super pleasant game though  Service slow  slow take drink orders slow deliver them slow take dinner orders slow bring meals slow bring dessert menus slow bring check    steaks really good friends raved Lobster Pot Pie everyone ordered Chilean Sea Bass loved it  Sides beets truffled polenta 3rd [kale?] already forgotten were    forgettable   Again good meal but great subpar service place where you're paying 5 star service  disappointing experience great visit American Fish BLT Steak Scottsdale   Too bad  <EOR> We Vegas locals Michael Mina favorites   Tuna Tartar lobster pot pie amazing   only criticism service last night's dinner   help kept saying no problem  uh huh thanked them water more bread whatever was   First all your job know problem   frankly because your job am interested hearing problem  saying uh huh is   lazy indifferent   just suggestion management   your staff terms no problem  uh huh vocabulary  <EOR> 2nd trip came down 4 star  richness portion size bit control  foie gras table companion noted looked wheeled MIchael Jackson's coffin   1 5 pounds just much didn't tell table meant table 8  lobster pot pie still kicks ass  sturgeon good great  <EOR> A MUST VISIT!!!!

Most meal thoroughly enjoyed   trying figure favorite but sadly wasn't   merely picking which didn't suck most   Amuse bouche only thing enjoyed caviar potatoes served shot belvedere vodka  Tuna Tartare  Three Seas bad tuna rubbery scallops edible sea bass served 2 TEASPOONs rice   Mary's Chicken pink   Veal just don't    Chef Dessert Tasting Menu only thing enjoyed sampler tiny chocolate chip cookies    Banana Tarte Tatin deserves wtf   Horrible   Candy bar slightly above average   Peach Melba warm vanilla cake much more along lines crunchy toasted warm muffin bread    Utter waste SHOULD extraordinary meal  <EOR> We decided host event 30+ people during Thanksgiving weekend unfortunate say didn't end getting wow factor wanted considering amount $$$$ put into place food champagne wine   Reservation made 5 30pm though people did show until 6pm latest server kept pouring $8 bottle water $130 bottle champagne two hours until complained waited bit long food them stop pouring champagne glass full top people obviously drinking   When food came tell each bite dishes sitting kitchen quite some time  may worked ahi tuna tar tar appetizer salad but definitely didn't work favor when came entrees  meat came cold looking lumpy red fish came tough dry even when covered white sauce  also long delay between plates brought out  also lobster pot pie but all honestly only remembered going through pictures  says lot dish   Bright side though each cold dish still ended being quite tasty  Similarly frequent Glendale flavors definitely spot on    Deserts ended being main attraction because everyone commemorated root beer float ice cream really? side soft cookie     really?    Now question arises whether overall experience place worth $250 per person including drinks if you're telling only thing people liked place DESERT then obvious answer no   Aside initial 2 hour delay main server not any girls guy suit only restaurant friendly everyone during entire time also quite attentive needs   If all over again would booked Picasso instead  <EOR> Michael Mina everything expected then some  walking through Bellagio garden you'll find calm chic restaurant  chose order tasting menu accompanied wine pairing  service superb food dream come true but highlight evening house sommelier Ben Spicer  Ben's knowledge storyline each wine took through journey around world enhanced each dish experience Michael Mina  visiting every time visit Vegas! <EOR> My first Michelin starred restaurant US!

Thus tasting menu obvious choice   Michael Mina splashy  no extravagant decorations chic interior  purely classy elegant restaurant simple decor  However setting accommodate large dinner gathering intimate date  servers staff professional friendly  waiter very helpful attentive  a little attentive became borderline overbearing  But think comes territory when dining establishment Michael Mina   Now best Yelping abilities review six items off Michelin starred restaurant's Signature Tasting Menu   *Domestic Caviar Parfait Alderwood smoked salmon creme fraiche shallot potato cake A small treat packs huge punch  parfait tiny but  its design intention  Just teensy bite contains big bold flavors  ingredients blend well together create intricate tasting experience  smoked salmon definitely dominated over other ingredients powerful BBQ flavor    *Tartare Ahi Tuna Asian pear pine nuts Scotch bonnet infused sesame oil The finely chopped ahi tuna molded into cylindrical block raw egg yolk sitting top  waiter breaks yolk then swiftly meticulously mixes all ingredients together  eat tartare its own spread bread  sesame dressing strong peppery  ahi tuna velvety soaks seasoning  pine nuts add crunchy texture  only complaint toast extremely burnt I should taken photo but opted snap pic boyfriend's less charred toast   surprised even served first place  Does Michelin starred restaurant carry enough bread can't replace burnt toast? wasn't just me  table next also really blackened toast tartare   *Miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass shellfish dumpling dashi broth The BEST dish night! sea bass moist delicate silky  Loved miso flavor dashi broth  didn't care much shellfish dumpling  my mom better dumplings  But sweet Jesus  sea bass absolutely divine  broth savory last drop    *Lobster Pot Pie seasonal baby vegetables brandied lobster cream This interesting dish  waiter sets down pot pie he cuts top off expose chunks lobster swimming buttery cream sauce  essentially openface pot pie  Cool concept! crust pastry flaky doughy  dish rich heavy though  I'd say least favorite despite its unique presentation  lobster fine but wasn't impressed flavors   *American Wagyu Ribeye Rossini Hudson Valley foie gras Pinot Noir reduction The ribeye cooked perfect medium rare glistening red interior  foie gras smooth buttery  solid dish    *Lincoln's Candy Bar root beer float vanilla ice cream chocolate cookie OK felt chefs being lazy lacked inspiration dessert  basically glorified Butterfinger candybar typical chocolate cookie small root beer float milk chocolate straw that can't even sip with!

Sure meal but dent your wallet  But you're walking into top end restaurant top end Vegas hotel   you already know you're getting into  being said meal great start finish  if reason wouldn't back would simply because Vegas just offers many great dining options  But even among those plethora choices Michael Mina's holds its own  <EOR> Had dinner Saturday night 1 13 2018  very disappointed food wine paring  party 3 people all ordered set menu wine paring except 1 person  Also 1 person doesn't eat raw he changed tuna tar tar soup  Lucky he did because think two just food poisoning dinner  Very very disappointed $850 dinner  <EOR> I pleasure doing Michael Mina Cookbook tasting menu wine paring when here  menu consisted five courses     1  Ahi tuna tartare sesame oil pine nuts quail egg well love tuna love raw stuff hence   I love raw tuna   and raw tuna dressed way well     the best tuna tartare ever had  2 Lobster pot pie A minature version Mina classic    actually nice size served ramekin pastry baked top tasting menu generous amount lobster very rich  3 Miso glazed cod soba noodles mushroom dashi bok choy another variation famed Nobu dish   the sweetnes miso well balanced other components dish  4 Kobe ribeye foie gras other courses nicely portioned   this very small portion should highlight meal  2 ounces most  very anticlimactic me  steak wasn't all great either   5 trio Mina classic desserts Rootbeer float chocolate chip cookie coconut cheesecake something else can't remember  I apologize that    The wine parings very good whites first three courses including very nice Riesling tartare red desert wine overtly weet taste  Service solid  would again  <EOR> It never ceases amaze high end restaurants Las Vegas create oases calm luxury just few feet off bustling casino floor  service definitely high point dining experience here  All waitstaff friendly engaging while delivering polished choreographed elegance expects  food delicious exception being restaurant's signature lobster pot pie which lobster disappointingly tough  Other truly wonderful experience looking forward going Mina's San Francisco establishments <EOR> This restaurant epitome fine dining  food die service impeccable  experience itself  Perfect romantic night your spouse great girls night perfect foodies   Food wise don't want miss lobster pot pie because divine but also filet mignon ahi tuna tartare appetizers also missed  server outstanding entire experience lovely worth expense  <EOR> I saved 400th review first nice dinner Las Vegas Michael Mina  Michael Mina huge name fine dining especially coming San Francisco expectations high  particularly excited because restaurant prestigious Michelin star  Having already two star Michelin Picasso expected good things    We arrived early time prix fixe pre theater menu but actually ended choosing ala carte since knew would probably end full sharing dessert  seted close windows overlooked Bellagio fountain which nice  started dinner amuse bouche small piece watermelon goat cheese  never developed liking strong pungent taste goat cheese but actually worked quite well piece fresh watermelon  melon mixed very well strong flavor cheese which resulted smooth aftertaste    For dinner companions chose items pre theater three course menu  savory black mussel soufflé saffron chardonnay cream  Having tried soufflé appreciate rises should light airy  great seafood flavor saffron most expensive spice world even better  reminded seafood paella made into soufflé  only $15 also surprised cheap relatively   try market greens salad also chilled English pea soup well first course  salad your typical salad I don't great appreciation salads made fancy Michael Mina chefs but pea soup full pea flavor  made refreshing starter rest meal    For main course rack lamb anchovies which also came gnocchi broccolini  lamb cooked perfect medium rare nice crust outside  anchovies great touch since didn't overwhelm salty flavor instead rather tangy touch  gnocchi looked miniature scallops came bit dense  broccolini bit over roasted  lucky enough try Maine lobster pot pie which signature dishes Michael Mina  enjoy table side presentation nice server scoops everything presents plate read eat  pie crust top huge covered whole top big pot  $30 supplement pre theater menu worth trying  filet beef juicy tender but more impressed cottage pie mashed potatoes topping short rib meat underneath   After second course already beyond full  probably good idea accept some freshly baked breads beginning dinner  shared root beer float also opera cake  liked sassafras ice cream root beer sorbet lot two freshly baked chocolate pecan crisp cookies  big fan root beer turned into sorbet something new  opera cake very rich flavor didn't really taste almond sponge cake because chocolate   Overall dinner fantastic  great appreciation plate presentation all food looked good tasted  minor complaint service request water twice waited while before served water  Usually such high class places Michael Mina let your water glass drop below 50%  great meal left satisfied but wasn't best fine dining meals had  <EOR> The pre theater $55 per person dinner main reason fan otherwise prices really high dining experience   Reviews lobster pot pie being pretty phenomenal spot worth $20 surcharge pre theater pricing and flaming frugal fox    So why 5th star?  Coupla reasons   Upon making reservation inquired if special occasion why yes birthday   If asked anticipate least birthday wish   birthday cake candle wisks husband thinks oops sorry  no cigar   Polite bussers but bit cocky server whisk again   Dessert  but b day cake?  Sorry sweetie but scene   leave   Enjoyed filet mignon tuna tartare app   not much seafood canneloni app but lobster pot pie sure worth trip here   As wine sommelier very approachable knowledgeable   wanting seem frugally foxy neglected ask price  wine ended paying $29 glass while pre theater pricing quite deal alcohol  <EOR> Just piling everyone else's glowing reviews Michael Mina   dined Saturday night prior show prix fixe theater menu amazing     wine pairings each course outstanding   party five covered everything prix fixe menu including first courses beet goat cheese salad most amazing grilled cheese potato bacon soup tuna tartare beautiful flavorful     Our main courses also ran gamut included tender perfectly cooked filet mignon truffle stuffed chicken foie gras rice delicate phyllo crusted sole mascarpone horsehardish   Outstanding each   Dessert brought chocolate brownies ice cream root beer float most delicious chocolate chip nut cookie ever tasted   addition great food Miguel server impeccable   He warm funny spot on being overbearing whatsoever   Between party five dined some best restaurants United States around world uniformly agreed Michael Mina close being most enjoyable experience ever any restaurant  <EOR> A long overdue review favorite restaurants Las Vegas  lobster pot pie favorite dishes everything tried world rightfully occupies Last Meal Earth blurb Yelp profile  2 25 lb Maine lobster perfectly cooked inside pot pie mushrooms mixed vegetables most decadent sherry sauce ever had?
