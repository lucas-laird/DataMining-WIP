So two weeks ago fiancé tattoo artist into store place order due all good reviews things heard  He proceeded watch cook touch everything without gloves washing hands touching each individual topping  He then asked man if he would put gloves he said we'll washed hands back  fiancé then pulled body art card told guy cross contaminating food  Bottom line never place if can't understand cleaner then tattoo artist  Considering tattooers extremely clean feel people touch you're food should even cleaner  <EOR> I tried them second time since advertised brick oven pizza  11 12 16  ordered online pizza calamari spaghetti meat ball $45  asked pizza medium char crust   Don't know happened but medium char raw pie  calamari round rings 9999 999% time when ordered  No sticks lake fried zucchini fried cheese   The manager would even listen anything  He said he checked order when left perfect  He would listen folks used place order   No third time here  Run don't walk joint  <EOR> So ordered simple Calzone  turned OK  bad  suggest know want ahead time call before arrive  May take some time prepare  <EOR> Just avoid place if don't want disappointed  gave place 3 chances only because first time did pizza  Since then put no sauce pizza nothing eating dough toppings  decided give another try ask xtra sauce still dry guess didnt understand saying thinking didnt hear me  Well today gave  last try asked xtra sauce made sure she heard took pizza home disgusting  No sauce very dry  daughter said little Caesars better  don't very cheap sauce never tasted pizza dry  refuse give them 4 th chance  lost business  <EOR> This pizza doesn't resemble anything close new york style pizza should add negation symbol logo company name because aint new york style   The quality pizza similar kind school lunch except worst    The pizza bad now am lactose intolerant   Stay away all costs  <EOR> This place right across street thought why don't ever eat?

How??  Not Brothers Pizza much better anything but couple deal breakers here    1    *Cleanliness    When arrived waiting pay food noticed same man taking payments handling money just put freshly made pizza oven w washing hands yikes! Although know made pizza still hoping best        2    *Thickness Salty    My pizza no where near thin crust more regular crust pizza    Geez wonder thick regular pizza is??? Secondly crust sprinkled garlic salt im guessing making crust near unedible My fingertips drenched grease Garlic Salt     looked stuck fingers salt container just eating slice   3    *Surprise Toppings ?     Whoever made pizza put toppings first underneath cheese which absolutely hate because SEE KNOW eating   I understand may bother alot people however pet peeve mine      To each own but think return Manhattan Pizza   Anyone thinking trying place maybe opt $3 99 Special instead committing large?  wish would done first now knowing going eat remaining slices       Sincerely Disappointed consumer   PS  Did mention greasy?!? <EOR> It's own fault  didn't read any reviews before coming here   daughter just finished swim lessons husband undecided where eat dinner let 5 year old daughter choose   Another mistake   She wanted pizza since fantastic pizza over weekend didn't want pizza again   But remember seeing place same strip mall swim school seeing sign more pizzas also gyros philly cheesesteaks   should clue place couldn't good    We walk gyro posters everywhere decide one   husband decides philly cheesesteak ordered 2 colossal pizza combos kids   lady counter warned pizza slices huge nixed order   glad did  pizza slice ginormous  great deal was $3 99 included drink  But flavor just OK   poor daughter almost chipped tooth outer crust hard   cheesesteak gyro OK well   meals came fries could sworn saw cooked fries fryer basket when arrived put back fryer us  least saved consuming few hundred unnecessary calories    That's last time enter restaurant without consulting Yelp first!  *Yelp 100 Challenge Review 51 100* <EOR>
