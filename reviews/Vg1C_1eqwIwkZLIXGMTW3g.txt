As lot bars Vegas find service isn't best kinda slow bar staff course want take care gaming customers first   guess find English times especially when there's big boxing fight town full Brits singing shite songs being obnoxious something don't miss living England!  All all decent place probably mostly because atmosphere beer selection the Guinness isn't great way but mind somewhat over rated   Oh Susan R   same thing 'Rose Crown' mentioned     kind saying Geo Metro same Cadillac because they're both American cars! <EOR> In town full glitz glam gaming only local pubs found downplays gaming focuses pub ambiance   course gaming if choose but subtle dark British pub feel comes through without being blinded lights coming screens  plenty beers tap bottles offer full menu worth food   food British pub style don't expect abundance spice anything healthy menu but is   atmosphere great hangout pub should be   bit loud when DJ's making difficult chat anyone more seat down but during quieter hours before 10 pm think perfect place drink settle maybe play round darts pool posse   course always football soccer tele if you're looking place watch game you've found it  <EOR> Jeessica Bridget server beer tender    OMG   Amazingly friendly    Great food   Atmosphere great cant wrong 2 ladies serving all afternoon <EOR> This place come if you're looking spot throw  During last trip sin city some friends looking chill lil dive bar grab drink throw some steel tip darts  spots came conversation w local bar hopper well Yelp search  thought we'd give spot chance    Hmm place very UNDERwhelming  The waitresses aren't most helpful  don't seem knowledgeable when comes knowing whether certain brews draught if ginger beer etc  also take long ask if need help  Poor service!!!
