So finally carne asada breakfast burrito bland! under seasoned water down red chili couldn't help it! Why because chili bland zero heat flavor well!   So disappointing robertos turning into fast food chain! today before two polar opposite restaurants! tell new leadership just looking cheesy marketing posters flyers taped all over place  Roberto's stop trying other fast food places because suck stay true your brand produce quality fast food! <EOR> Just #RobertosTacoShop lake mead Rancho Las Vegas woman drive thru put chile relleno bag sideways all sauce cheese dripped onto me! 10 16pm 9 25!  Going call manager tomorrow  <EOR> This few locations drive thru which very convenient  located gas station small dining area inside  usually pretty friendly order accuracy good  food average which normal chain restaurant  Beats Taco Bell any day  <EOR> If consider going place through drive thru sure open every item look thoroughly   stopped per request order some carne asada fries no pico no sour cream guacamole side  Well home ??? Extra sour cream no guacamole !!!

Way show your customer service  truly waste time  Never again  <EOR> No star all  Those anything already gone  Take your choice options hairs heated properly aka botchilism   service Retarded then again service? Caters tongueless <EOR> Usually wouldn't bad review over something petty but happened multiple times  When someone orders churros probably good thing put cinnamon sugar them  <EOR> This 2nd time location messed order  Both times ordered carna asada burrito no pico  ordered through phone pick lady phone confirmed both times no pico part order  Both times pick during lunch break come back work open theres pico  called withint 6 7 mins pick up  Spoke lady stated she must given wrong burrito  informed unable since pico it  She said she put name book free burrito she asked when would coming in  told come call back 15 min break come pick up  call back hour half later spoke another lady stated lady already left name book  She also stated nobody called store hour half  now being called liar  asked manager  she said its just cook talk cook if want  hrmm really? asked if she could call other employee regarding she states she doesn't number  asked GM she doesn't number either  asked when GM Jose in?

P S  horchata best comparison other Mexican restaurants to  Even formal ones  <EOR> In opinion very racist     Mexican guy wasn't even line but dont know she called counter took order he payed proceeded take order very unprofessional no coming back <EOR> This cleanest location  hearing few people talk Carne Asada fries tried them last night  say pretty tasty  wish would them before  normally order chicken quesadilla which very filling  only location now  <EOR> This place always slow messes orders rude food consistent sometimes good other times bland tough   am going start just driving extra mile to A different toco shop <EOR> The chicken burritos extremely dry also advertises tomatoes them  actually don't big fuss them damn tomatoes  cook can't cook any means  <EOR> The customer service bad gets    I called order ahead time when roughly 25 mins later they hadn't even started order   this isn't first time experienced bad customer service come before wait nearly 5 mins before even being acknowledged waited counter place order    gonna find different robertos experiences gotten worse each time!!! <EOR> By far hands down BEST taco burrito place Vegas take place   I love fried foods even though try eat lot   all Mexican places eaten Las Vegas California Arizona Roberto's houses best chimichanga ever   There Roberto's Arizona but literally 50 miles away home   I miss Roberto's   things loved living Vegas  24 hours  <EOR> After waiting buffet open fiesta realizing Valentine's Day way expensive drove across street excited see Southern California Mexican food taco shop gas station!!

Skip beans aint  great either  Tacos enchilada's nacho's burrtio's can't wrong ordering any these   Don't even think going Taco hell   I hear if flash em drive through free  <EOR> So far probably worst Roberto's to  gave second shot since drive through convenient but alas let down again  nachos every time them cheese little bit melted home melt ourselves before eat  only couple small things salsa 2 tacos 2 nachos  temp food rather luke warm when comes well  Other Roberto's never type thing happen happened twice here  would just travel different better meal  <EOR> I came satisfy depressed appetite I recently broke boyfriend thought the talked getting married soon Palm Springs          and came pick me food   he's bad person just decided cheat career    I didn't feel guilty all consuming fat mess! Carne Asada fries point usual brought all natural antidepressants lift melancholy   I highly recommend place those just dumped feel shit  Dr  Roberto ease pain  Haha  <EOR> Tired ordering shredded beef burritos stuffed full onions peppers tomatoes! BEEF? eaten Robertos many times always happy but drive thru location really skimps meat!! <EOR> First place located gas station   bad   fact more appealing me   Unfortunately food just meh   shredded beef very little flavor it   enchilada sauce also needed some spice   guess if drunk off rocker might want everything menu   Being sober Saturday around 1pm place definitely needed some help  <EOR> I've tried tacos de Lengua California burrito no veggies both amazing  place also drive thru  <EOR> A pretty reliable Roberto's located gas station drive thru   I recently came while strapped cash being hungry work   I carne asada burrito $6 some change  guacamole pico de gallo it  usual per location meat  seasoned well still pretty tender  guess lucky recently cooked batch meat  guacamole pico tasted fresh good flavor well  All three ingredients combined made good tasting filling burrito   Once again given red green sauce when only ever ask green  Whatever end world  But pickled onions carrots jalapenos put bag without having ask which cool   Another experience decent tasting Mexican food filling didn't break bank  <EOR> This Roberto's located super sketchy area inside gas station across Texas Station casino   It's only drive through Roberto's ever seen see why didn't take off  amount time takes your food same inside regular Roberto's imagine if there's ever more car line people really antsy annoyed where really just ordering inside same wait  Plus roll your pajamas    Food taste quality consistent other Roberto's more entertainment value anything rolling suspect speaker order waiting car watching people stumble across adjacent empty dirt lot into night walking dead some shady dealing going poorly lit lot behind just adds atmosphere    Probably avoid though sort feel safer waiting inside regular Roberto's lol  <EOR> This Roberto's located Rancho between Lake Mead Owens across Fiesta Rancho inside Sinclair gas station     Went today 8 12 15 11 15 AM some takeout      eaten many different menu items many different Roberto's all let down   hate mexican food Las Vegas most part   Where grew just completely different better IMHO      My co workers drag every Wednesday because every Wednesday Roberto's 99 cent chicken tacos   pretty awful today   All them greasy bland tortillas chewing shoe leather   Even dousing them tomatillo salsa didn't help   lettuce full inedible stalk pieces   Even guy cuts lettuce don't give f**k     My co workers continue every Wednesday find something edible soon   Maybe french fries  <EOR> Super slow drive thru! cashiers always slow even forget waiting them take your order     prepared wait least 10 minutes them take your order 5 minutes collect your money 15 minutes your food  Just horrible!!!! <EOR> I ALWAYS HERE! always order bean cheese burrito Super nachos 3 taquitos   love depending hungry feeling  feel cheap prices which always good  also love green chili! great food  BEST Mexican fast food place goto  <EOR> Stood front register 10 min before even acknowledged standing just because decided ask  girl if open   Food cold pineapple water nasty <EOR>
