Most NYC transplants should very pleased place   and sell slice too  <EOR> I'm NY lots good pizza  place solid  Compared places NY pretty average but compared places outside NY good  slices ordered heated fresh  <EOR> Quality pizza all way  cheese crust sauce such high quality easily best pizza Las Vegas  ordered them several times consistently amazing  Great job guys! <EOR> I tried joint reviews fellow yelpers     ordered 2 cheese slices soda 4 75     liked dough good  pizza folded nicely    When order usually ask  little bit more sauce since pre made slices sauce wasnt pronounced  but its fine    When am area mood pizza  fine place    recommend based had      07 04 23 I gone several times since first yelp    just want say pizza joint  every time gone its consistently good     Always eat fresh shop if   tastes best just oven    Good job Verrazano's   only grant 5 stars if its FREE food    LOL    <EOR> I lived east while fair share good pizza   When moved could life find pizza place even close ones east  In fact before Verrazano recommended considered Dominos best pizza area   This place consider best flat pizza side town least  I asked them why pizza better others area said because take precautions pizza dough doesn't dry out  They said reason why aren't any good pizza places here  That sort made sense because much drier east  Sometimes wife tells owners little rude but she says everyone  So wife would probably rate four stars but Yelp account five stars  <EOR> I'm gonna honest when ordered regular pie little underwhelmed  basically wrote place off worthy    Then few people told Sicilian good here  absolute sucker good Sicilian pizza  slight hesitation ordered glad did  similar Sicilians use Big Inning  liked lot! Plus takes entire pizza box which way should be  convinced best Sicilian pies you'll town  Also garlic rolls just New York garlic rolls! plus deliver right around corner house winner  wanted give place 4 stars but mediocre regular pie terrible hours made more 3 3 1 2  Since can't give halves 3 is  wings decent slightly above average  would them again but aren't OMG amazing!!!   keep all mind  <EOR> Good pizza   Supposed more authentic most others town DOES taste little different   in good way?  Maybe   depends ask!  Verrazano Pizza good choice lunch! 2 slices drink around $5   I think toppings extra $0 50 so   slices pre made just tossed back oven your toppings everyone else town   Started off Pepperoni slice! Very oily tasty   super simple cheesy foldable slices  Since am NY don't care much authenticity but good slices reasonable prices   Sausage slice! good well   I think prefer pepperoni topping more here   weird since house sausage topping guy little while now   Don't expect anything else besides good pizza cheap prices   family owned pizzeria style spot well Pics <EOR> Visiting family November yes long overdue     all craving pizza take out Chinese   Finally settling pizza three nearby places choose from   Two places flyers left apartment door sister's place just 3 blocks down street   Read reviews those thought sketchy   Found Verrazano's!  4 mile drive but totally worth it   In all travels New York Chicago Portland where used live local places hometown Verrazano's easily top 3 favorite pizza joints now   Don't let strip mall location fool you   Sometimes you'll find gem place definitely qualifies!

Loved meatballs added very good flavor pizza  <EOR> THE NAME ESTABLISHMENT CHANGED  NEW NAME RIZOLI'S  name changed but 'za same!  I'm sure sprawling metropolis several if hundreds pizzerias offer New York style pizza but until stumbled little hole in the wall strip mall pizza place hadn't found any  pizza transports New York's lower East Side  crust perfect just aching folded but droopy soft sauce toppings slide off before your mouth  sauce perfect blend tomatoes herbs spread thinly over dough edges just bit thick chewy  cheese melty stringy messy applied just right see sauce peeking through 'za just bit greasy maybe oily  unctuous would better words less fraught ethnic innuendo God intended be  toppings usual added just right proportions   Of course other items menu pasta meatball subs calzones salads mostly fried sides  only sampled salad which meh garlic knots which very good  But eat them all night order them! Left sit overnight any garlic knots any Italian place become hard little projectiles could conceivably use ammo  lots lunch dinner specials also serve pizza slice case you're done shopping Sprouts next door feel bit peckish  don't generally drink wine beer can't tell if offered there  table couple chairs outside shop case you'd dine al fresco  interior design well really given much thought but scrupulously clean  deliver although if order delivery might wanna heat your oven 250° when order then put pizza box all warm little  isn't pizzeria earth deliver piping hot pizza though no fault no foul!  The staff tend bit towards surly but only lends New York feel place no ever actually rude  If you're ordering dine take out they'll keep notified wait time   Plenty parking strip mall  if feel guilty scarfing two five slices always stop Sprouts way home pick some healthy food just yourself feel noble   If you're anywhere near neighborhood  highly recommend stop sample pies  won't sorry except guilt but hooked! <EOR> I place lot   Count Adam Carolla style pizza eating   when time eat pizza want EAT PIZZA!  means don't want some thick crust weighing down filling slice     Verrazano solves all pizzas come nice thin crust which just right amount doughy   am pepperoni fan myself but offer most other usual toppings well   mention tried sausage time wasn't real thrilled it     Sauce tastes fine skimp cheese variety specials others mentioned   Also guys work great always greet everyone happy chit chat when possible   Also toddler gets real kick watching them cook     If NY style pizza should least give try cost much might end liking it! <EOR> It greasy!!!! good soaked grease  But felt guilty eating it  Service good though  <EOR> Without doubt favorite pizza place Vegas  coming couple years now  NY style incredible  can't say enough small little family owned pizza joint  He remembers every time little things keep coming back over over  But real try pizza!
