For all non vegetarians sure place good     For all vegetarians might want consider something else   Overall fun experience try once but takes forever small results   Give giant bowl ramen any day  <EOR> I driving around hunting some dinner when drove past Swish   used favorite places eat several years ago almost forgot it   haven't years because heart broken but  another story anyway figured I'd check again see if still good   I layout U shaped table both fun conversational little awkward look someone other side  only shabu shabu style    I just didn't care sukiyaki style   food still really good love ponzu sauce!  sauce good!

Isn't just veggies raw meat cook pot yourself?  Even though food simple enough disasterous if prepared appropriately  Take example order Chicken Fiesta $12 95 healthy portion sukiyaki style which came small plate vegetables bowl rice    The chicken carelessly cut into various shapes sizes some large 1 inch x 0 5 inch x 1 inch cube  uneven size cooking time highly variable uneven  Plus trying cook really thick pieces chicken little iron skillet minimal liquid takes forever  Added fact don't want cross contaminate raw chicken other food ended taking long time before could eat   The haphazard plate vegetables also cut unevenly some really large pieces napa cabbage carrots which hard eat which also exacerbated above stated issues  vegetables itself okay but little irritated fact put less 15 leaves spinach plate look full  For those know amount spinach cooks down less mouthful  total turn off because charge another $3 95 miniscule plate poorly cut vegetables   My hubby ordered hungry sized Kobe Chuck $20 95 portion  Although meat cooked better stuff because thinly sliced accompanying dipping sauces horrible  sesame sauce musty weird watery  Tasting swamp water looking crappacino serve Fear Factor horrific combination  ponzu okay but nothing can't bottle supermarket   To cap off experience servers restaurant poor  waiter nice appeared very absent minded  He'd frequently forget start cooking pots plates food cooking utensils etc  Running cheque took way longer ought to  waitress other hand more ball but poorer attitude towards patrons ie sounding exasperated because someone didn't know meat choices grilling why wanted second set chopsticks because handled raw chicken no cooking utensils     why!    name few examples  One might argue joint busy  However I'd say something that  normally don't comparisons but just case  Shabu Shabu Paradise Henderson only waiter whole joint but she handles same number customers all own  service way better received here  Plus she deal refilling unlimited plates correctly cut vegetables bowls salad condiments rice   Although food edible service improperly prepared dishes really ruined place me  Plus rather lackluster portion sizes given price meal also big turn off    Even though other favourite shabu sukiyaki place 30 minutes away I'd rather suffer through another round Swish  2 starred review   <EOR> This definitely only place great AYCE sukiyaki shabu shabu Las Vegas  used come lot but soon declined realized many places Vegas able more bang buck  Then found change management added option AYCE  CHANGED EVERYTHING  No longer did worry being full paying twenty dollars meal    The Good Meat vegetables still die for  meat being all eat   or vegetables if veggie platter nothing complain food department  always ask raw egg dip meat done cooking  Yum! Oh  never forget ask garlic  Even though might change clothes later because garlic smell really adds great taste  All AYCE prices reasonable priced  also good deals alcohol AYCE sake $9 99  Can't that   The Bad only thing bad times service occasionally  When older gentlemen working he very keen all needs  He best! While if younger staff could sitting ourselves wave them down another serving    But overall great price AYCE shabu shabu sukiyaki! Yum  <EOR> for price ayce shabu shabu pretty good  if flavor soy sauce based broth other little bland  think 3 different ayce meat choices  sauces ok  service attentive sliced meat served just quickly being eaten  better shabu shabu places but value swish good  <EOR> We wanting shabu shabu place good reviews  Overall tasty   top sirloin pork  Initially ordered chicken but marinated chunks kind enough change pork   well priced portions nice  servers very attentive  better shabu restaurants but solid meal good price  would come back  <EOR> I wish could give zero star  It second time Swish  didn't nice experience before when spring mt 7 years ago but wanted give shot again since Groupon deal  bought worth hotpot shabu shabu two more people  ordered 1 medium shabu shabu shared and added more meats   PLEASE SEE #4 list happens when ADD MORE STUFFS willing spend more     1  service terrible  Saturday 8 30 PM restaurant empty only boyfriend eat  Although didn't any other customers serve didn't even give any utensils spoons fork turner nothing   waitress didn't even explain menu confused before ordered    2  boiling fast strong asked waitress turn down fire but she barely changed  couldn't even control gas because designed table  couldn't taste anything since everything way hot burned tongue   3  9 15 PM started clean restaurant they close 10 PM Sat   felt under pressure since cleaning mopping floor   4  ended spending $80 dollars since added lot meats mushroom but when PRESENTED GROUPON VOUCHER REFUSED take  said CANNOT ADD MORE ITEMS         what? added more meats alcohol willing spend $40 more refusing take voucher     ?

Help me!!!  My boyfriend ordered traditional prime beef shabu shabu lunch which $10  ordered prime beef sukiyaki lunch which also $10  Both combos come plate vegetables rice  Also ponzu goma sauce    The meat sliced crazy thin thinner paper  practically dissolved contact couldn't pick meat slices without them breaking into bunch tiny inedible dots meat  worst form cuttingcosts ever seen    I'm curious know if thin lunch only if dinner actually give better slice meat? Even thin slices meat absurd even lunch acceptable business practice total scam    The plate vegetables wasn't tiny but all vegetables cut into many tiny pieces bits old! would predict week half old if older    The sauces really sad  ponzu sauce tasted more sour should almost pure vinegar  Maybe bottled ponzu but tasted bottled ponzu better this  Also goma sauce even close goma sauce should taste like even made sesame seeds? very sour well  almost general idea sauce should taste but never actually tasted it  Epic fail    The last drawback didn't offer any type soup base traditional shabu shabu udon noodle soup very end which weird! pretty much bland udon noodle soup broth sip? don't understand it  other hand sukiyaki broth insanely sweet  pour boyfriends bland watery broth into sugar bombed pot order edible    I'm disappointed place called themselves Japanese shabu shabu  all huge lie  <EOR> What great night unwind getting Family together enjoy some soup soul  took parents Father's best friend town holidays some Shabu Shabu! love eating Winter time chilly weather more welcoming actually look forward it!

Having vacationed Japan thought flavor spot experienced trip  variety reasonably priced drinks sakes too  decor simple but layout really nice allows servers move around socialize bar  thought worked great space  definitely back! <EOR> Super cool concept  Never place this  Good date spot fun kids  Josh awesome great service suggestions! <EOR> So Groupon Now! $10 $20 worth food voucher good pass up  cousin wanted venture off strip dinner great place try    There hardly any people around but just meant better service us  picture place getting really full weekend  staff really nice attentive totally money's worth  STUFFED  vegetarian delight rather generous portions you 2 plates veggies plus rice noodles   But since could take dollar further decided order salad avocado roll  tofu salad isn't vegetarian it's topped bonito flakes dressing thousand island   lot food leftover  felt completely defeated  But definitely worth it   Even cousin order 3 specialty rolls voucher  Pretty cool  <EOR> Here's another restaurant where always same thing  when no complaints  Kobe ribeye shabu shabu way go! yourself small stove front you    First boil assortment vegetables mushrooms etc  When they're cooked proceed add meat  meat cooks fast would suggest putting them little time  eat over cup rice wash down some iced green tea  Such simple meal but delicious  leaves feeling satisfied but heavy  Oh peanut y dipping sauce could put tire taste good  <EOR> My foodie king stopped into Swish enjoy food via Groupon  Basically price take $30 off bill selecting food options  could only ala carte items they AYCE options both hot pot sushi   prime rib  Mine medium large size shabu shabu dipping sauce  also ordered egg  Pro Tip told best mix egg when dip your protein gives buttery flavor enhances your meal  great portion both us  added two scoops garlic generous helping chili oil two scoops green onions pot  didn't care sauce dish came with  But both finished whole meal  First time hot pot   Definitely worth try come back AYCE  meat very tender food really good! <EOR> Another bold statement think Vegas way better Japanese food options SF Bay area    except when comes shabu shabu  Other categories ramen sushi curry tonkatsu etc  think LV wins convenience ease getting most importantly quality  But think Vegas bit lacking shabu shabu department  Maybe because haven't ventured off yet into Henderson offer but far Swish Shabu Shabu Spring Mountain did impress  However Swish Sahara does job little better one servers told connected but really whatever means   personally set Swish Sahara more  normally Prime Rib Eye healthy size option Sukiyaki tons garlic but still ask sides ponzu sesame sauce  wish place fresher looking veggies higher quality beef comparing likes Shabu House SF Burlingame but again best option found far  AYCE options definitely cheaper LV place even allows multiple meat options  If you're looking save few bucks between 4 6pm 20% off regular menu  Last time 5 50pm didn't finish eating until 7pm server still gave 20% discount without having remind them  If anyone else any good shabu shabu recommendations please send them way!

safely say both places offered same quality food   say though staff location much more attentive checked customers more often   However also side effect restaurant set your hot pot sitting inside counter space employees control heat your stove   little odd since think I'd rather control over but end didn't affect meal experience   Referencing original review started off saying place now list don't care if ate earlier week eat again tonight! foods  statement stills rings true   ate Spring Mountain Swish lunch Thursday enjoyed Mushroom Party which great name dish dined Sahara Swish dinner Friday and gasp Vegetarian Delight!    Although major obvious difference between Swish Spring Mountain Swish Sahara setup another difference managed different people   snuff whole background story but even different owners find location   Whichever happens closest time! <EOR> I shabu shabu restaurant   because obvious title restaurant called   that most likely would order   But last night when requested shabu shabu waiter adamant sukiyaki   calling shabu shabu bland  OK why hell would talk down food your own restaurant?  why work shabu shabu restaurant WAITER if don't even food???????  fine   take trust advice   happens?  sukiyaki   little bit tasty preference   request ponzu peanut butter sauce  usually served shabu shabu waiter water down   Yes shabu shabu may bland but ummmmmmm    I it   sat eating wishing shabu shabu instead   he's only waiter restaurant but 5 place practically empty   Now see why   He scatter brained   half time would request something   guess what?  never came   music playing background?  ALL depressing just dumped music   Really weird    The food would awesome if he believed brought essential items necessary eat your food beforehand   so you're sitting 5 minutes plate meat wishing eat already  <EOR> Additional update 2 25 2010 first Swish location Sahara did re open but also opened new location Spring Mountain edge Chinatown    Sahara location food same before excellent but many non pot cooked items no longer available which shame   6 year old loved chicken teriyaki bento used offer but obvious understandable effort streamline menu cut back kitchen requirements ultimately save costs no longer offered   now hot pot only menu shabu shabu sukiyaki    Thankfully still offer full array mushrooms just 2 3 kids Shabu Shabu Paradise   would still rate Swish little behind Sh Sh Paradise overall experience   Still waiting re opening Swish Spring Mountain   Unfortunately new location won't convenient being close Chinatown or right sure address # Swish more competition   Its old location further north Sahara made more convenient less daunting trip whole family especially weeknights when wanted enjoy Shabu Shabu relatively quickly    Food wise I'd rate Swish Shabu Shabu Paradise Henderson equal   appetizers Swish little better well fantastic mushroom plate but preparation shabu shabu ingredients fresher cleaner Sh Sh Paradise   We're also fans counter seating Shabu Shabu Paradise much more relaxed less rubbing elbows strangers experience Swish   Still   both great   Now if only Swish would reopen!! <EOR> I discovered place via Groupon surprise! Very nice staff great food  waiter made some good suggestions quick check us  really enjoyed wide variety vegetarian vegan options    We each hot pot I mushroom party  banger left feeling plenty stuffed  even poured broth takeaway container could use next day cook own dinner it great fish!     We look forward coming back trying some other items menu  <EOR> omg    love place   just right amount food  order healthy small hungry big   usually order heathly because comes lots vegetables cabbage spinach mushrooms carrots tofu noodles   really shabu shabu style love ponzu sauce   But if you're first timer should try sukiyaki style   more teriyaki flavor  I place better china town   seems quality meat better located chinatown  try out! <EOR> Yummmm! Always favorite place eat simple quality service food always delicious  always take state friends family eat everyone loves it <EOR> 4 5  Good place  Good food  Meat sliced very thin but tasty  service great  Everyone polite helpful answers questions  other reviews said slice meat side table area aren't many seating areas  signs ACE but didn't partake limited time limit  worth try sure we'll back but won't weekly stop more once while dinner choice  <EOR> I swish Chinatown location thought pretty good but good expected    My first disappointment flavoring  food today tasted really bland some odd reason  Then tasted broth even though spicy miso extra spicy meaning extra miso paste tastes pure water  add lot garlic soy sauce some flavor  Goma sauce also very watery   flavorful normally is  shabu other swish thought flavorful  location unfortunately lacked lot it    My second disappointment service  mean unattentive    weirdly attentive random times  very nice don't wrong but guy asked if he take plate away but meat left said yet   He literally stood until ate meat  Also    turned flame off twice prematurely    Before finished all meat   ask them turn back on    guess since its island stand somewhere    maybe just stood front cause needed elsewhere  Again very nice    I did leave very full pretty satisfied  Enough sauce trick  food no means bad   just better    <EOR> We used Groupon try place out  portions huge food fresh tasty   service great well     back again   <EOR> This favorite places dine in  portions generous staff very friendly accommodating  Sukiyaki ribeye favorite  Just quick hint    always Groupon available if want check place out  highly recommend coming  really unique dining experience  <EOR> Bought Groupon hotpot deal visited quiet Monday afternoon  Ordered Top Sirloin small shabu shabu lychee sake green tempura ice cream  Sirloin really good portion decent  meal ended well good portion green tea tempura ice cream  Kester attentive dedicated  <EOR> Have never swish before  experience very amazing  hubby came date lunch place did disappoint  Since never very kind explained everything detail  made choices we're shown prepare turned such lovely experience  Everything fresh great atmosphere  would definitely recommend place everyone  must try  <EOR> Had great time here!  My partner came during bday weekend Vegas bought Groupon online  weren't sure expect we'd never anything before isn't anything even remotely similar where live    After getting seated server Paul very accomodating explained everything patient even though million questions    The way works You choose your meats seafood would well broth cooked then bring your pot veggies begin cooking while waiting meat  place veggies pot swishing optional allow cook based desired consistency  Then bring meats same thing    Once again Paul super awesome made sure come check often making sure enjoying meal didn't need anything else  end meal he even nice enough give birthday dessert which absolutely amazing!  The only gripe stomachs full wonderful swish pot weren't able fully eat delicious dessert couldn't really take because honey toast ice cream   Overall would definitely recommend place wish Swish all best! Hopefully very successful day expand neck woods! <EOR> After hiking around Red Rock Canyon decided some dinner before heading back hotel   friend wanted dessert Red Velvet Café but couldn't find anything wanted dinner   craving seaweed salad sushi roll Japanese Korean restaurant next door   tabletop grills doing sukiyaki type dinners   wasn't interested that   browsed sushi menu seaweed salad but didn't offer sushi roll   sign front restaurant said vegetarian options but couldn't find many sushi form   ended ordering seaweed salad tasted fresh delicious   also ordered avocado rolls vegetarian rolls avocado cucumber   didn't realize many plate should gotten other because really similar   disappointed wasn't more variety   positive note happy hour received discount! <EOR> I enchanted darkness  darkness sukiyaki  Forget shabu  Ever since visited Shabu Shabu Paradise craved teriyaki sweetness sukiyaki fondue little heart out  Honestly tried every do it yourself culinary trick book besides Korean BBQ sukiyaki now only endorse  Unfortunately Paradise bit far regular visits but Swish right around corner  other night when craving hit hub decided give Swish swirl   The set Swish little informal long central bar seats all around  seated around runway incredibly gracious servers run down delivering goods  servers landing planet niceness  burners sit inside bar which create some precarious dipping practice your chop skills ahead time   Now eats sukiyaki served shallow bowl which create interesting opportunity treat your sukiyaki skillet stir fry when juice gets low  smart call when you're fixing udon noodles  ordered vegetable selection plate includes asparagus carrots  course standard cabbage  All all some good veggies but want dip every known vegetable sauce except mushrooms  really vegetable stop trying trick me  those mushroom aversion ask extra something else replace fungi  twice evening vegetable plate bit more generous tofu mysteriously changed consistency  evening medium firm next evening soft  did consider 3 star rating but    nah   The sauce good add extra helping garlic if like  might use tad more mirin because think sauce notably nice tangy    The prices reasonable but must say bit more money idea unlimited refills veggies tofu which Shabu Shabu Paradise  Those words unlimited refills magic    But location location location always factor Swish right around corner am sure you'll find hub again soon dipping rhyming  Well maybe rhyming  <EOR> We weekly date because love Sushi but husband does eat really good compromise   sushi ordered really fresh   dining experience different if ordering hot pot   bring everything raw cook your self pot placed front each seating area   very unique idea he enjoyed food lot   If wanting waited having your food cooked place you   However would highly recommend going back often   restaurant appeared very clean could see loved music playing atmosphere  <EOR> I took son dinner yesterday 3 19 2017   Did enjoyed all  son sukiyaki shabu  Sukiyaki just sweet no other flavor  also couple sushi rolls looks sushi but did taste sushi all  Quality flavor just waste money  <EOR> What great first time experience  definitely coming back  portion AYCE Shabu perfect service spot awesome flavor soup  Walking away satisfied customers  <EOR> We dinner reservation but when wasn't busy  immediately seated plates fresh veggies sukiyaki  burner high heat broth bubbling over cooked veggies quicker everybody else's  meat?
