Anytime want Thai where you'll find me     The place very small only very nice server but food worth deficiencies   Lunch crowded best time odd hours open   My all time favorite pineapple fried rice level 3 but usually try order something additional just try other things   Never disappointed     Prices more reasonable just overall pleasant experiences!  Enjoy! <EOR> So come lunch quite bit  recommend getting Tom Ka Chicken Shrimp rice spiced your comfort level   My coworker usually gets mint chicken allthough menu  also sweet sour chicken orange chicken  Affordable good food    Hot tip!
