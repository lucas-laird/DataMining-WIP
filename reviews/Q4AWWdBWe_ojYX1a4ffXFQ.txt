The Burrito utterly delicious  Ian's quesadilla cheesy side but no denying taste present Tortilla way cooked    If craving some Mexican food satisfy your late night hunger definitely drop here  open 24 Hour  <EOR> After seeing show wanted tacos   course Yelp found El Dorado Express   Located Boulevard Food Court share area few other fast food joints such coffee shop pizza   nice other options but isn't much seating inside   pretty large patio but wants sit outside middle summer?    After seeing high reviews Yelp headed over   Unfortunately did live those reviews   guessing those high reviews written few many drinks when anything tastes great   First off told running 15 minutes behind we'd wait food   Okay   ordered some chips salsa hoping enjoy those while waited but nope   came tacos   hard reach behind grab some chips salsa send way? When finally did receive food surprised see small tacos were   fine because only $2 50 each but menu should specify street tacos   point glad ordered chips salsa because no way two street tacos going fill wasn't willing wait another 15 minutes   tacos also weren't anything special   just okay   ordered al pastor carne asada while hubs ordered pork chicken   all kind plain lacked much flavor   Needless say pretty disappointed wouldn't stop again  <EOR> This probably last trip here  stopped because yelp said best restaurants US  Authentic Mexican cuisine  wife Mexican some tacos carne asada burrito  wife said tacos where ok she better  Now burrito when cut half see inside it  full white rice  Only little meat  payed $10 rice burrito lol  Come when think authentic Mexican food think burrito full meat beans tomatoes cilantro avocados flavors!
