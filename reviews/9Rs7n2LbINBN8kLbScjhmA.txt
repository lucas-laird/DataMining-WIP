Two crepes chosen Bologna France   France which includes ham eggs farm ? cheese scallions parsley tomatoes béchamel sauce standard fare doesn't disappoint but also didn't wow me   no discernible difference flavor ingredients just crepe stuffed above usual béchamel sauce   Bologna which includes meat red sauce Italian cheese would OK if knew wasn't going crepe   Let's explore further name business Crêpe Bologna listed under savory crepe section should safe assume would receiving crepe   Well exactly Bologna merely cooked crepe batter meat sauce slopped top more lasagne crepe   The service shitty harsh but true   No check back another drink   maybe I'd another room temperature latte  No check back meal dropped   maybe roach food wasn't wouldn't known however because never came back see things going   Confidence its purest form? food great don't need bother ourselves your opinion  Nearly 30 minutes pass crepes finished  Se il vous plaît le chèque! Yah counter request where met fairly combative owner dismissed few concerns brought attention   I've lost count many times place failed   Needless say won't waste time driving again  <EOR> Went Sunday Breakfast  Long wait could understand no gloves no hand washing no hat kitchen  When paid girl stopped prepping took cash back prepping without washing hands  Disgusting!! <EOR> The server really sweet helpful  crepe ok though  ordered Japan crepe pretty salty  think miso sauce it  But girl chef overheard talking friend offered less salty next time stop which really sweet opinion    Overall good service kind staff but food average  <EOR> We love food Crepe service great food! Thank bringing such amazing food desserts Tivoli <EOR> I'm necessarily crepe fanatic but love good being Tivoli Village isn't far home Crepe bookmarked since opened  hard see appeal place especially when comes atmosphere  You've nice little French inspired restaurant those kids really cool little play area! lighting neat live music nice touch just cool ambience  wasn't fan tiny tables uncomfortable seats though   One biggest issues place service  sign front says whether seat yourself wait seated  whatever reason sign pushed into corner since apparently customers don't greeted door kinda just stood until over asked someone if could just seat ourselves  found table took good 10 minutes waitress come over take drink order   but drinks did came fast love serve iced tea carafe  looked menus putting them away ended waiting another 15 minutes completely different waitress come over take food order  original girl took drink order complete look disgust face seemed pretty unhappy actually glad different girl  But apart rarely check during your meal neither restaurant bathrooms very clean  same seemingly angry employee resetting tables hadn't washed trash floors chairs underneath it  just seem way unorganized here   Moving menu they've quite few crepe selections including items breakfast lunch dessert  cool thing offer Crepe Duo which gives your choice 1 savory crepe 1 dessert crepe  prices though thought portions bit small  Most people would probably easily able finish Crepe Duo $23 bit hard wallet  When factor drink tip person could ended spending over $30 eat here  crepes? Eh don't know   The crepes themselves hit miss me  ended ordering 3 crepes split between us   the Britain bacons eggs potatoes gravy Argentina beef peppers onions chimichurri Austria strudel caramelized apple   Britain smallest 3 mostly eggs filling severely lacking salt  Argentina bit more filling flavor much better  While still bit lacking salt pepper beef cooked perfectly chimichurri sauce nice bold flavors just right hint garlic  Sadly Austria worst 3 just complete let down  even sure managed but almost no flavor whole thing  taste apples own but everything else completely bland   In opinion just okay although service lacking ambience iced tea carafes decent Argentina crepe pushed 3 stars  won't rushing back but I'd give them another shot if mood crepe didn't want drive across town  <EOR> Passed dinner saw there's daily events both during day night  Decide stay live jazz happens Saturday nights    Jazz bad  suspect most patrons really performance relatively young jazz band  Most patrons only ordered beverage    Service friendly  really appreciate warm hospitality staff giving  only complaint wished wine some sort alcoholic beverage order other coffee smoothie  mean c'mon jazz without some vino? <EOR> My fiancé Tivoli Village Saturday morning farmers market  never before summerlin bit drive but glad did!
