This review Mermaid Lounge mermaid show aquarium art gallery  This wonderful serene little lounge Silverton Casino next Aquarium near Bass Pro Shop   STRIP PARTY BAR if  you're looking skip it  there's no music  bar course several tables barstools some conversational lounge areas but best part lounge long row stuffed high back armchairs facing aquarium   wonderful place just sit relax while planning your evening activities waiting meet friends unwinding show long night gambling   just sit comfortably watch fish swim contemplate you're going pawn your plane ticket home  Bonus food drinks reasonably priced  Although calls itself restaurant well lounge really only serves limited selection standard bar food   serve very good however recommend fried calamari parmesan fries  drawbacks kitchen open irregularly  Don't depend being able order food here left hungry more occasion when kitchen certainly should open  Also service nearly non existent may bar your drink if things busy  But won't mind just relax watch fish swim lazily by  <EOR> Bartender took 10 minutes ask if wanted drink even tho only two other people  Trying close tab right now waiting 20 minutes  If didn't give them credit card would walk out  Horrible service  Didn't check ONCE  <EOR> Loved Mermaid show Silverton Casino   definitely unusual creative!  Great show free family Mermaid Restaurant Lounge's food bad either   menu offers American food choices  tried fried calamari shrimp salad   calamari bit disappointing since stale soggy shrimp salad good maybe little much sauce   Overall biggest attraction definitely mermaid show  should definitely check showtimes before going   casino itself offers $5 blackjack texas holdem poker tables  great alternative expensive strip casinos  <EOR> The nachos huge pay them   only positive thing say   Only saw 1 mermaid she area lounge she front other people see   waitress must new   She order wrong   wait another 20 minutes just chips salsa which originally ordered    She spilled drinks she setting them table   hubby fish chips he said fish good   But chips just regular shoestring french fries   Maybe late night happy hour would better time there   around 1 2 pm   guess just right time great experience  <EOR> I came when friend Mike B  brought see mermaid show fried oreos  He moved Vegas Seattle June down little vacation!

Ok free live mermaid swimming aquarium real fish   cirque du soleil but very cool memory   Great kids adults myself obsessed mermaids   sat bar area some drinks kill time till next show   Mermaids rotate between shows   scuba diver bottom sure everything safely   Kudos that   children field day this   sure call email showtimes  <EOR> I'm hang lounges bars but little place more sitting giant aquarium  decent place grab comfy seat watch fish swim back forth  There's cool ish vibe lounge  dark great view beautiful aquarium    The bar snacks good love when deep fried Twinkies yeah said it menu  bad things Mermaid Lounge SUPER SMOKY as most places located right smack dab middle casino very loud  really worth special trip but if love fish aquariums you'll kick sipping your house wine bar  <EOR> Horrible service  Waited hasn't come over since 5 15pm its 7 30pm  Totally ridiculous   Party 10 bar no service  sad!!!

My friend showed check mermaid convention being held hotel  gorgeous women and some men elegant fish tails sunbathing pool    We figured Hey if amateurs professional mermaids must AMAZING    Yeah well wrong    First off girls attraction wear full body suits tails look kinda    cheap    then they're wearing goggles nose clips  figure water's probably refrigerated really really conducive nearly naked underwater ballet     Their shows every 15 minutes during certain hours day last maybe 5 minutes most  tank which contains rays fish filled oxygen hoses  girls lowered into lifted pool swing like seat  Once they're water swim oxygen hoses then hang bottom just wave kids until swing appears water again mad dash sit pulled water    No tricks no twirls spins loops anything just breathing through hose waving bottom where only kids parents mobbing tank could see  only put girl tank each show  Really whole illusion no chance  Basic things keeping toes pointed poking just forgotten  just looks semi miserable person trapped tank legs together until she leave    I'd gotten drink bar but wasn't anyone manning it    Seriously Bass Pro Shop adjacent tank FAAAAAAAAR more interesting  sole redeeming quality place jelly fish tank above bar metal looking mermaid statue    If want free show  just cheesy if better just hang around Midway Circus Circus  <EOR> This far favorite casino bars Vegas  many times never Yelp'd til now  I came Thursday night Pub Crawl 1st stop  7 8 Thursday night serving all drinks just buck! Yes thats correct  drinking Grey Goose red bull $1  making them strong  The place even packed able score spot huge chairs facing aquarium  waitress but just easier bar round  I am looking forward next pub crawl   <EOR> In town everything place very unique  Great big aquarium mermaids inside? Yes mermaids little hard explain see it!! inside Silverton little off strip but Bourdain stop check out  bar pretty basic but chairs sit stadium style right front tank cool  did food but beer prices decent  <EOR> After dinner Seasons buffet kids wanted check fish tank   nice surprise see Mermaids kids loved it!  attraction great whole family mermaids really playful all kids!  If haven't least check least once  <EOR> To honest only show people town mermaids   never eaten usually just gamble instead buying drink   think if town business wanted avoid Strip would great bar grab drinks chat   Classy but casual all same time  <EOR> Mermaids  else really need know? food good? Perhaps  drinks strong? Probably  But come mermaids tank waving does really matter? No  addition aforementioned water creatures entire spot serene blue ambiance immediately lulls into lounge mood especially if score tables large cushy seating arrangements  highly recommend evening when you're wondering heck should do? answer always work look some mermaids drink  <EOR> After dinner Twin Creeks made short trek across casino check Mermaid lounge  afraid didn't consume any drinks eat anything review purely spectacle mermaid tank !
