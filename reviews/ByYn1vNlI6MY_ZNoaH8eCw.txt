Literally looks room apartment  Everything clean everything hotel worked  just great  would definitely am going stay again next visit  <EOR> We Vegas huge company event   Alexis Park Resort hosting meetings pre event   didn't  really stay hotel over night  Just conference rooms ended eating Pegasus bar grill located resort    When sat down into Yelp check in  very disappointed  seeing 2 5 stars   BUT because pressed time ignored ended eating there    Well well well     surprise delicious food! VERY tasty full flavor juicy omg yummy    did lot choices menu mind bar grill but two items 10 or maybe even less still excellent   Highly recommend burger chicken taco   service also great     If look through rest negative review location see referring actual resort complaining room check in service    Unfortunately because place Pegasus bar Grill located inside Alexis Park Resort getting all bad reviews   truly deserve such low score Yelp  <EOR>
