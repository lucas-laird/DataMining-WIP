I used come just adobo pusit squid since seem only Filipino fast food place serves it  But last time ordered didn't taste same  sure think way sauce tasted  more watery usual something  Whatever enough tell myself order anymore    They also some Filipino grocery items store  But beware REALLY expensive! bag chicharon costs $1 29 next door Ranch 99 costs over $3 00 Kapit Bahay! You'd think would lot lower knowing its more half price right next door!   Overall place is    ehhhh    okay  would rather another Filipino fast food before going here  <EOR> Went breakfast morning food served proper temperature   Seems day old food reheated   steam rice tasted spoiled   Would never back place again  <EOR> This probably best filipino food town ever ate  Sisig very good well pansit perfect taste  definitely recommend place friends come try eat  <EOR> They look full decided give try   People standing Panda Express set line order foreign language usually good sign food authentic   But when order sweet sour pork lady behind glass give All fat pork   minute ago saw she spooned all lean pork same dish lady obviously speak language   big turn off am coming back again  <EOR> I eat quite often delicious every time! go to order 2 item combo heaping scoop rice pancit chicken adobo  If feeling need little extra order shrimp veggie lumpia   seriously large in charge tho' sure u bring appetite !
