Best panang curry Vegas  <EOR> My favorite Thai restaurant Vegas!The chicken chow mein very good  sure tell them lighter think should spicy scale because things hot! also wimp though  <EOR> Archi's used all time favorite Thai place  past couple visits bit disappointment though  always trying call place order 3 4 separate occasions would never pick up  Apparently online which perfectly fine but those internet? ordered online call probably 5 minutes later  wanted tell prices online incorrect would extra 4 bucks total  said fine because totally craving Thai  bit peeved though since whole order thing online prices correct  should offered price shown online regardless  However sure fixed problem now   I assume month ago    We decided come dinner Saturday mall  ordered Beef Pineapple Fried Rice Chicken Pad Thai  fried rice delicious but spicy me  become some kind wuss spiciness now only because burns stomach  pad thai huge mistake  soggy mess noodles  way much tamarind sauce noodles overcooked   Service attentive but bring sweater ladies   its freezing there  Overall Archi's decent Thai place but definitely favorite anymore  <EOR> I've location several times lunch coworkers continue keep coming back  only food great but prices affordable  entire lunch special under $10 which absolutely fantastic  favorite lunch dish sweet sour chicken which comes rice side salad spring roll cup soup day  much food such great price! must caution fellow yelpers though try avoid going location traditional noon lunch time ALWAYS  packed  If you're able bit earlier say 11 45am bit later 12 30pm then you'll likely seated fairly quickly  Otherwise if come right noon you'll waiting quite long time only seated but your food well  <EOR> Archi's amazing Combination Fried Rice main reason go  mention Pad Kee Mow sp? papaya salad you're missin if don't eat here  <EOR> A Thai restaurant     used love   It's always disappointing when return restaurant prices but portions smaller  go to dish ground spicy beef chicken basil  almost always leftovers take home least enough fill but time around barely enough three us! Such downer   They don't offer refills Thai tea no really does except few places but your glass gigantic compared soda glasses feel some ok lack refills   Service well took forever someone refill water took 10 mins before anyone walked pay bill  wasn't horrible but wasn't great   There few Archi's town isn't really fav but when comes Thai food I'd rather Basil 'n' Lime  <EOR> The vegetable panang curry papaya salad bomb  Extremely flavorful  best Thai restaurants ever  Great service  Wish place Bay Area  <EOR> Archi's consistently serves fresh high quality delicious food EVERY     SINGLE     TIME!!!!
