The staff attentive sweet  Thank ladies!! <EOR> The WORST!!! should expected airport?! Brisket inedible! It's tough full gristle fat spit out    Don't waste your $$! <EOR> I don't expect much airport food  often no surprise when airport food overpriced great  Thus real big surprise when found quite opposite Brookwood Farms Southwest terminal McCarran international airport   It early morning hadn't breakfast yet  Lines long Starbucks Coffee Bean Burger King  Burger King happened right next Brookwood Farms would've easily passed Brookwood Farms without giving second thought but glad didn't  saw nice displays various different biscuits gravy display  all looked good decided give try   I asked biscuits ham gravy  lady helping brought two fresh baked biscuits proceed put layers ham top  She then scooped bunch scrambled eggs then drizzled whole gravy  whole time awe  didn't expect pile biscuits she did  least three large pieces ham lots lots scrambled eggs  more enough share  All food only cost $5 40 $4 99 +  41 ! truly unbelievable amount food price paid  would easily paid double neighboring places airport   Now taste wise great well  biscuits fresh soft  ham eggs just right gravy rich tasty  gravy even little bits sausage it  truly drool worthy!  It's often rave airport food but say became fan Brookwood Farms day  big portion very affordable prices happy traveler  <EOR> Pleasantly surprised airport    Vegas special breakfast     Everything good except gravy Side all over your food <EOR> I didn't expect much because airport  hour before boarding  eating eating Burger King  just few dollars more  ordered TJ's Pulled Pork BBQ Dinner w mash potatoes mac n cheese   Mash Potatoes = 4 5 5 Mac N Cheese = 3 5 Pulled Pork = 10 5!!!!! Yes Pulled Pork GOOD! juicy tender tasted smoked grill wood fire sauce point   wow! Too bad seems only location Vegas  Looks flying Southwest more often just eat here   <EOR> Horrible  If could give negative stars would  Brisket terrible nothing more slab fat  No meat  Beans no flavor  $15 all trash can  told them just stared me  Nasty place  <EOR> This place some pretty good sides but brisket absolute garbage  chicken pulled pork might OK because those pretty hard screw but brisket atrocious  tastes brisket would microwave dinner  sauce could improved well  <EOR> Great food large portions but little pricey  Every time completely ignore customers lined until tell them you're ready order  always order Pounder Platter split w hubby  50% time wrong! Why?  Just tell if you're something order something else  Today gather chicken   Got pulled pork brisket NO CHICKEN!  OMG! What's wrong w people won't communicate remember the best surprise no surprise! honest! Plus if say no cornbread  mean    <EOR> Wow never would known Brookwood Farms did real food counters restaurants until stumbled airport! When grew NC Brookwood Farms brand pulled pork barbeque IF absolutely some grocery store  means pretty good store brand    Anyway typical airport place high prices trapped audience  But portions large drinks self serve  pulled pork sandwich Carolina style slaw top huge messy! bad way but juicy delicious  Even though obviously no smoker sight key sign bad BBQ joint meats thoroughly smoked somewhere even end day seem fresh enough  Carolina BBQ top pork marinated plain vinegar sauce another sauce made ketchup  two Carolina styles mixed into but works  Overall your typical airport fare  if travelling through give place try    know again next time! <EOR> If you're place known its BBQ skip head PeiWei    The order lean brisket sandwich  fatty  BBQ sauce unremarkable  good good store bought imo    The meat tough but far tender  Very little smoke meat  bun delivered hot reasonably good    Wish hadn't eaten there  <EOR> The brisket sandwich ok  Mac Cheese worst ever had  Brisket tender  <EOR> Grabbed couple sides lay over kids  Portions generous mac cheese surprisingly really good  <EOR> The food displayed know expect  no means does indicate get  bbg sandwich displayed piled high thinly sliced meat coleslaw top bbq sauce  served thick dry hard swallow meat short squirt bbq sauce tiny plastic container cabbage mayonnaise  coleslaw sent toilet 2 bites  Health inspector should probably visit  lady no name tag asian gal served busy slice meat give bbq sauce  paid $12 shit  <EOR> My experience question Ever reheated food?  The meat already cooked placed grill quickly warm up  sides resided individual compartments  Freshness wasn't expected delivered point   I craved some BBQ satisfied bit   At least lady behind register nice drink free refills ideal lengthy unexpected layover    Tri tip two sides plus refillable drink and tax = $18  Cannot recommend place  I'm sorry  <EOR> I chose restaurant checking all restaurant options first   definitely best choice us  shared ponder sampler all good   brisket fantastic pork shredded chicken tasty too   prepared three different sauces   came nice sweet cornbread mac cheese   totally delicious satisfying week EXPENSIVE lackluster food strip   would definitely return   Good service too  <EOR> A ok  brisket dinner  Portion good price fair international airport  Brisket ok but bit tough  Needed sauce ample provided  Very sweet tangy  Mac n cheese seemed noodles + unadulterated cheddar cheese interesting  cheddar but wasn't creamy mac if  like  Bourbon baked beans good  Woman behind counter nice  <EOR> Should eat biscuits gravy before 3 hour flight? Well Vegas feeling lucky?    Brookwood apparently does BBQ later day but breakfast definitely worst thing eaten airport  2 big biscuits sausage patties gravy under $7 lot food airport prices quite reasonable    In terms taste decent but again eaten MUCH worse McCarran see Jose Cuervo Tequileria   didn't experience any negative consequences probably ill advised breakfast choice Lady Luck side once  <EOR> They give lot food price  thought ladies working friendly     food itself pretty decent  Everything nice hot  brisket flavourful especially addition bbq sauce doused with  love good BBQ sauce wasn't bad  little sweet side tangy acidic taste back end  I'd eat again when passing through  <EOR> Uggggh   certainly don't expect great meal between flights any airport shouldn't disappointed   but am  All say should stood line next door Burger King bet bit more predictable <EOR> Ok airport food I'd give place solid 3 star  Overall good food  Definitely some best place eaten Vegas airport  Pat's Pounder Platter meats all tasty BBQ dusted green beans surprisingly crispy  BBQ sauce side am glad did found very sweet  Granted prefer heat over sweet  <EOR> Sounded good display case showing sandwich samples looks good  Prices food court bit high   Service challenged     ok disaster   When food ready call your sandwich name    your name sandwich name    many different sandwiches   see confusion    We 2 sandwiches told would 5 min    10 min hearing 2 together inquired gave away 1 them ham cheese sitting there    thought someone else other sandwich    retrieve her    she already touched extra bag    needless say asked them remade waited another 5 plus minutes <EOR> The only part meal enjoyed warm cornbread  chicken equivalent BBQ covered cardboard jerky  dry  mashed potatoes remind instant ones box  many choices wasted meal here  <EOR>
