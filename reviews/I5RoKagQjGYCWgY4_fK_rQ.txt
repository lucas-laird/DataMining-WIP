<EOR> Ordered plain cheese pie  When picked noticed normal pizza guy wasn't making pie weird   Asked them where he said no longer here  Took pie home wasn't same  Very disappointed  Pizza still better dominos Pizza Hut   Please change name no confused thinking they're getting Russo's pizza hire guy back  <EOR> We've back Russo's several occasions since debacle    They've redeemed themselves delivering quality pizza tastes good very fresh tasting  <EOR> Great humble atmosphere friendly staff all around  If ever want pizza know place satisfy needs    They local convient priced fairly  Any good review other yelper's place true wont into details you'll just find yourself <EOR> First order February 2013 picked Russo's special which topped pepperoni sausage mushrooms bell peppers onions   pizza mediocre all way no rush order again     Second order September 2013 last minute guests coming over watch Sunday afternoon football games   Since closest pizza house gave another shot ordered large sausage mushroom pickup   pizza actually pretty great   Even guests thought pleasantly surprised   couldn't believe same place honest     Third order November 2013 old buddy living Boston raving chicken parm sandwiches around Fenway area   thinking last time great chicken parm sub which probably when Clinton president   bit bullet go   Although bread decent chicken bland under seasoned tomato sauce   pretty blah overall   sub came small side potato salad FROZEN   initial thought crunch mouth celery but ice!  Nice!    I called inform them cashier simply just said Sorry  owner called 3 minutes later apologize again   He said something wrong fridge everything froze over blamed cook noticing   I'll probably end ordering again due proximity but drive extra few miles pizza elsewhere sure   wonder many pizza chefs have?  Maybe need obtain shift schedule  <EOR> Pizza flavor tasty but crust hard tasteless  When mentioned owner excuse very poor  He said weather affecting dough comes affects texture flavor   After coming New York eating great pizza over 40 years say bad excuse  happened twice no longer Russo's  <EOR> Stumbled little gem National pizza day looking decent spot slice drink lunch   glad found place!  greeted immediately warm welcome friendly smile   great lunch specials!  2 slices drink $5!!!  pizza delicious!  Service great  definitely back! <EOR> Had large pizza    normally am fan NY style pizza but pretty good!  Ultimately believe perfect combination sauce cheese crust breaks pizza   crust lot flavor good combination soft firm so each slice would bend flop but still strong enough hold all those toppings when folded it     cheese tasty good    but very little sauce   Next time would order extra sauce pizza but time ended ordering extra cup sauce   very accommodating but extra cup sauce cold   told would be    but whatchagonnadoaboutit?     Anyway overall taste pizza good but somewhat sauceless pizza reason four star rating  <EOR> Tried place today give big thumbs up! Pizza great two slice cheese pizza drink lunch special $4 95 + $1 additional topping well worth it  regular lunch stop sure  <EOR> Delicious little pizzeria tucked away small eatery center  Family owned New York origins place super cute super clean super delicious super fresh  ordered Greek salad which very fresh crisp calamari which light fresh just downright delicious bucket chicken wings which did come bucket but instead served nicer oblong plate creamiest ranch dressing side Russo's supreme pizza which added olives ham jalapenos dollar each  All appetizers light fresh really made difference while waited pizza  Usually appetizers sit heavy then time your entree comes don't really room more food but really think due way food prepared  Just would expect small authentic family owned restaurant food made utmost attention freshest ingredients  would give place 5 stars if only pizza order hadn't messed up  While ordered supreme added toppings when pizza came only 3 added toppings asked added  server without hesitation immediately apologized took real We're gonna right attitude which really appreciated  would've happy if other toppings cooked aside just tossed pizza because gonna lie eager eat it! But chef made entirely new pizza he did super quickly! felt bad because pizza huge worried first pizza gonna tossed but when asked box server boxed left overs came back first pizza box well relieved because perfectly good food shouldn't thrown out! course weren't charged first pizza now dinner rest week! haha  despite little mix definitely delicious experience much better option fast food pizza chain  Certainly much pricier but worth considering all food it! <EOR> I drove really far place eat  arrived ten minutes closing time  cashier told closed because slow night   This no sense me  slow reject customer? <EOR> J'adore eating here! review backwards order  homemade cheesecake best  All pizzas good especially pepperoni  Service usually quick  <EOR> Chicken Parm Lasagna real deal    Reasonably priced    Generous portions   back <EOR> This place best try it   boss orders food lunch bf day off love it  <EOR> I come Russo's regularly lunch mostly order lunch special w meatball jalapeño  love atmosphere friendly customer service experience even better   Their pizza best pizza far  crust nice golden brown most time sometimes little burnt put right amount sauce cheese give pretty good amount toppings I love it   slices huge a couple times medium small sized pizza slice equivalent two pieces pizza I happy when saw size pizza! !!
