Crust awesome eggs still creamy delicious  also grilled pear burrata salad dressed perfectly  very good coffee food nice atmosphere  service could bit better server well he quiet friendly but he did take care okay  Would given 5 stars if service better  All all very cool place come again  <EOR> If restaurant experience rated food alone 7th C would easy 3or4 stars  Let's clear  the chefs point  While religious experience certainly quality   That service though? Abysmal  Let's begin     $30+ markup wine ordered bottle market value $11 wine Zinfandel  Price point mean vengeful there's no better explanation  If you're going list bargain bin wine then least price respectable modest mark up    False advertising ordered prawn ceviche given sea bass something other without explanation  WORLD?!  Example if order hot dog give veggie burger tell the burger's better! done sea bass  No sir  then brought attention said sea bass better suck did remove bill? NO  Service hospitality fail    Your business model cannot be order menu but enjoy whatever decide bring you  Excuse but **** noise  speaking noise almost impossibly loud there  table six difficulty hearing another speak might explain why waiter s many screw ups did    Again bottle wine told woman brought bottle only four would drinking  She proceeds place 6 glasses begins pouring  nodded yes but listening? pouring wine  PAY ATTENTION    Finally bill  explained woman took cash cards subtract cash total put $100 red card divide remainder between two cards  She wrote down  came back double amount remaining two cards which means charged least $40 over total including tip   Did pocket cash?? included tip! Literally half hour later somewhat sorted out  half hour! Where also challenged whether mathed right  simplest bill ever  Before launching before putting new people floor any training? owner epitome graciousness upon arrival conveniently disappeared once things hairy  Funny that    Last but certainly least food  did enjoy  CFC Wings braised oxtail which winner most just excellent  sliders which while fried onion added respectable flare killed really still just sliders  Difficult well but certainly good nonetheless  hearth oven bread stole visual scene dominated its own plate dippings ALL aces  Good show there  grilled peach burrata salad also favorite plate scraping good  Several hadn't experienced burrata before but now we're married it  Just delightful combination arrangement    So is  Good food but ruinous service  needs hassle charged something didn't even order wait 30 minutes pay out?  I won't back  7th C square itself away way its locational predecessor  <EOR> Stopped while visiting DTLV say food very good  Great service  All plates smaller shareable type eats  Wings very good crunchy  ceviche good kick chips  try burger bites very good side sauce  Sat patio very nice evening great ambience  Off menu desert delicious  would give place 4 5 stars but water good  Obviously using tap water very disappointing end  Otherwise sure stop again  <EOR> The funky menu caught attention did disappoint  few items late holiday Saturday evening but still enjoyed legs eggs flatiron steak  Reminds tapas restaurant Spain portions small meant shared  Good service food came quickly price bad  would come again  <EOR> We 7th Carson before going Smith Center immediately greeted big hello owner Liam  waitress very prompt always checking us   Liam also stopped table everytime new dish see liked if everything turning way hoped which was  At end meal Liam stopped more time let know new restaurant told come back again which will  no complaints!! <EOR> what delight! Located what's fast becoming favorite Street food 7th Carson downtown Delight! am love menu  excited back try other things didn't time  wine list could use little bump but cocktail menu point  food menu great because something everyone  American Fusion if will  sat kitchen bar could see all action which nice warm since super cold outside  able try pair burrata salad bread dips wings  far Shining Star night bread  yogurt dip more lebneh  then tzatziki baba ganoush hummus awesome! wood fired flatbread made such treat  could eat all day everyday  service outstanding everyone super nice knowledgeable know back soon  Highly recommended if near downtown just want try great spot eat  <EOR> The only reason increased rating two stars rather actions manager Liam came table finishing meal find everything was  When described experience he immediately offered comp meal invited come back another time try things right  He gets mensch points increase star two  But being really very generous part  made reservation 4 people  5 minutes early reservation  Instead getting table offered four chairs communal high top occupied several other people already  non starter us  then offered table window where sun baking making table really unusable  no shade cover window seating table even close reasonable  Next moved two small tables long setup offered seat there  acceptable until told would eat under 20 minutes because needed table someone else  great start evening  did finally them jerry rig table 4 acceptable although less good  After few minutes server came explain third items menu no longer available several other items  busier expected don't food deliveries Sunday  sure why should problem but many items choose already limited menu   She left  allow look over  few remaining items left menu  She next came back table 20 minutes later  would take couple pizettas hearth oven bread dip  Those theoretically still menu  But us  bit time crunch because theater tickets  server explained oven incredibly small food couldn't possibly come timely fashion  only thing left menu could order flat iron steak salmon  steak came first when 10 minutes left before leave  room temperature best  quality meat could only described heimlich material  Despite fact incredibly small portion $21 entree portion four couldn't finish it  really edible  came side fries  fries also room temperature soggy  Despite fact time really hungry couldn't finish those either  salmon made appearance 5 minutes before leave  salmon room temperature overcooked dried out   Bottom line failure honor reservation absolutely terrible service food could eaten even being comped feel overpaid meal  returning  <EOR> Spotted restaurant accident way driving back LV strip  Open kitchen clean friendly atmosphere  All staff extremely attentive  beet salad burger which awesome  Hit spot  Owner came say hello introduced himself well grabbed brought over drinks bar weren't waiting  He told story place now open three months  If find yourself downtown looking drinks great food exceptional service don't skip place  <EOR> We came late dinner  menu item come pork belly  bummed didn't try but rest dinner delicious satisfying  oxtail toast so many great flavors duckling pot pies complete comfort food flaky delicious pear bruggata salad light refreshing honey drizzle really pulled all together hearth bread  love bread sweet treat  huge!

pairs well Grilled Peach Burrata salad which ranks competitively against other versions tried due addition fresh pesto which pops vibrantly against sweet peaches creamy cheese  simple sounding sliders also hit perfectly fried onions made think imaginary private chef would if craving White Castle  three dishes alone would satisfying summery meal   The Hearth Oven Bread 4 dips huge charred bread round slight zatar like seasoning  Ours soggy bottom bit much oil which unnecessary given accompanying dips all solid own  only foray into seafood offerings Prawn Ceviche which only later informed actually sea bass didn't notice but disclosed until inquired which odd considering chef's seafood background  dish itself lackluster larger portion sans awkward tablespoon sized side unseasoned mashed avocado would more appropriate price given protein downgrade  bread I'd again if dining group but seafood situation left bad taste mouth   I overlook few missteps new restaurant but service comes down training experience  Kevin L's review details issues further but major takeaway bring cash when splitting bill  comedy errors took three staff members literally half hour resolve time cost additional fees form parking ticket being late meter! requesting staff expedite solution given schedule  all teachable moments but manager really should stepped situation exceeded fifteen minute mark   The food thoughtful beautiful really having modern tapas concept downtown even if don't often venture down area  eventually back check duckling pot pies fried chicken wings garden patio but going find few new friends take    ATM hit way over   NOTE No vegan options desserts limited  <EOR> Don't waste your time money going 7th Carson  During meal experienced nothing special worth ever going back for  prices averaged around $2 50 bite expensive then most dishes very poorly executed cooking technique lacking     ITEMS ORDERED The grilled peach burrata salad huge miss 1 10   peaches hard bitter making dish inedible  Uncooked butternut squash would've upgrade bad  wings okay 4 10 nothing  hardly cravable  spice blend  dusted wings tasted exactly Pork Butt rub bought Costco put ribs smoke home literally exactly it  smoked pork belly best dish ordered still nothing special 5 10 3 pieces pork belly sitting top blue cheese pork chicharron could've greatly benefited some sweetness acid counter richness saltiness pork blue cheese  bill total $57 63 w o tip 3 pieces pork belly soggy fries 4 wings doused pork butt rub bitter hard peaches  also included 2 diet cokes 2 ginger beers ZERO alcoholic drinks    Other notes person party ordered flat iron steak  shit there's more meat Big Mac plate  When brought honestly thought kitchen split steak onto two plates  I'd shocked serving size over 4oz  Even more shocking $21 charged it    7th Carson You're tenure resemble Pop if changes prices food quality technique aren't made soon   don't see place making through summer   Glutton way better 7th Carson anyone wanting try place please yourself favor call reservation Carson's Kitchen  You're welcome!

Casual eclectic yet bit high end  Perfect date night family dinner    Our family sat promptly Sunday evening hostess asked if reservations we didn't     Service perfect attentive relaxed    Amongst family we're few reviews dishes    Smoked Pork Belly very tasty but small portion    The Oscar Craft C perfect way try new drink pair your dish  husband LOVED unique option    The Pink Dragon yummy but didn't pair well pizza  definitely dessert beverage  Frothy creamy    The Parmesan fries great    The Prosciutto Pizza crowd fav 10 inches diameter  egg best part!

Greg hands down talented hell! Best menu great costume service definitely back  <EOR> Useful Tip Host stand located outside Garden area off 7th St  My favorite unfiltered dame decided indulge nice little drink spot because Yelp suggested really great tapas style food!   The restaurant itself intimate open kitchen which pretty unique  cocktails well crafted  ordered spicy yet yummy melon cocktail   Service ticket time food lot slower anticipated!  Food Sea Tuna Tartare $13 great presentation but portion small amount rice crackers provided cost  devoured little jar mean tuna quickly barely remember taste  If take guess sure exceptional remainder plates ordered! Land Duckling Pot Pies $12 bestie well traveled experienced carnivore raved duck pot pie! take word because don't consume meat  She highly recommends shared plate order thank later! 5 5 Oven White Truffle Toast $9 truffle executed very well did enjoy toast but worth carbs don't tell trainer !

What??? Why does menu state prawn ? She explained prawns hard keep desert sea bass little easier manage heat     ok guess understand utterly mystified explanation   all times eaten ceviche never sea bass fish  Anyway impressed   I did enjoy peach burrata salad refreshing but best ever had  oxtail good first time tried particular dish  other table mates shared sliders chicken wings bread  All tapas just ok me  Nothing really dazzled me  decided split bill paid cash thank goodness friends ran into issues when using debit cards  left before all took place parking meter running time  felt bad Stephany V  received ticket when she trying leave while    Overall dazzled place but hopes together especially telling truth menu  must confess love concept sharIng food friends but need more few bites sustain myself  found myself stopping another dining establishment complete dinner way home  <EOR> For something different wanted meal downtown once based menu reviews tried out  early sat bar where Oscar mixologist he more just regular bartender say that mixed some delicious cocktails!
