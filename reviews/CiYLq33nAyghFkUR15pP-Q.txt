Also ging es erst die mittlere Bestelltheke  Die dort servierten Tacos schmeckten nach nichts  Alles zerkocht und ungewürzt  Auf den Spieß rechts hatte ich am Ende keine Lust mehr weil ich meinen Vormittag nicht damit verbringen wollte auf Tacos zu warten die nicht mal wirklich nach schmeckten   Das Bestellsystem ist mehr als optimierungsbedürftig da das ich sehen durfte sowas von ineffektiv war ja fast idiotisch  Jeder Koch nimmt gleichzeitig die Bestellung auf und serviert  Wie soll man bei drei Bestelltheken mit unterschiedlicher Nachfrage gleichzeitig essen? Die einzige Möglichkeit gemeinsam und alles zu essen ist wenn Laden leer ist  Alles andere ist utopisch  Und dann mit dem vollen Tablett zur Kasse die sich dann auch beim Eingang befindet  stolpert der bezahlende den reinkommenden über die Füße und tritt den wartenden auf die Zehen  ein Chaos!  Nein Danke! Ein Mal und nie wieder!! <EOR> Honestly BEST TACO PLACE EVER! El Pastor! delicious!   I ordered two tacos el pastor asada  asada just okay bad but el pastor great ended getting 5 more el pastors because delicious! Highly highly recommend el pastor Tacos El Gordo    They lots tables chairs inside outside but does super crowded  parking front restaurant well  Tacos El Gordo order your food counters counters each kind meat want  Then cash register pay  Sit wherever want  Great place come!

Ademas eso de hacer diferentes lineas fatal es una desorganización total  <EOR> I'm fan Tacos El Gordo but man location no organization ALL! literally waiting line 20 minutes didn't even move inch  Three lines would turn into 6 lines people trying cut line walked in  employees seemed could careless brought attention  Please hire security something  <EOR> I found them Instagram Tijuana excited come LV find location here!! carne asada tacos we're good but line adobada al pastor huge because  just where at! pastor fresh off rotisserie nice crunchy pieces  salsas hot told them con todo meaning everything  Ask side cebollitas nice grilled onions jalapeno hot yellow pepper  Then pay     2 sodas 8 tacos only $23!!!!! left hefty tip because see everyone working butt off food amazing! <EOR> BEST TACOS LIFE   I woke Sunday morning immediately wanted tacos because  completely normal?

Guacamole FREE  Well    wouldn't call Guac its more just avocado but still! Other places would charging $1 more some guac  would definitely pass carne aside fries its missing bunch pico    After your order pay  $2 tacos bit pricey side since used taco Tuesday but worth it!  So ordered 12 tacos large order carne asada fries given 4 small sauces    when asked more sauce said 1 sauce fries 1 sauce per 4 tacos  sure came conclusion because sister loves putting sauce everything but wanted charge $0 50 each additional sauce  No thanks    Horchata decent  3 tacos definitely wasn't enough because they're small would recommend getting 4 5  Also FLOUR TORTILLA  corn tortilla tasted amazing  <EOR> Not doing me  least just great reviews see here  am happy say did buy into hype everyone giving place great reviews  place all cracked be  Lucky arrived slow night tonight  Okay reviews place  pass place take turn walk in  Man door heavy f****! place spacious loved that  found pretty cool meat set deli type thing line pay big well liked that     order two tacos de asada meat looked good along condiments  surprised when he asked if wanted everything he didn't put chilly    But guess put aside but even more surprising fact he put avocado it  Thats twist surprised because know some tacos shops but surprising because Tacos El Gordo San Fernando Valley California both inside taco truck don't that      Screw lets it  order realize salsas inside fridge liked everyone won't fight snack bar grab condiments  Yeah yeah pay also some lengua tacos aside  Now those did O G  taste  mine more desired  loved packed meat  flavor detail    Okay  tortilla used yellow kind those slide  meat carne asada good flavor but felt needed little bit more way hold flavor meat  added spiciest salsa only disillusioned self    IT    WAS    NOT    SPICY! blew mind     thing believe took off flavor fact inside fridge  salsa tasted nothing EVEN HINT FLAVOR LEFT! now imagine this    your regular corn tortilla sub par meat good flavor topped off boring salsa flavorless avocado  thought when added avocado going kick if didn't kick would taco itself rescue flavor but no     just sitting debating if should different change mind  order another one  tacos little pricy only because experience  order de adobada  because says spicy  taco already am doubting just because meat more pinker Patrick sponge bob guacamole watery fuck    Should guacamole look white green? experience but whatever  taste am automatically turned off  Screw am coming again  only thing am grateful stuff good seating great  But am guessing tacos el gordo own distinct flavor Las Vegas     Gordo frequently would same type meat same type flavor but difference between those when flip meat don't lightly press down it  flip  press down little longer grab tighter locked meat flavor  Even if meat same same yellow tortilla would still taste good  But doesn't avacado chilly yellow tortilla just added texture taco  Over nothing fancy just your salsa outside room temperature white corn tortilla pressed down meat GREAT!

Are 2 vampiros omg regret going there! ate before without issue big this  gotten stomach aches but today! <EOR> I love love love tacos el gordo especially location  very first tacos el gordo location don't understand why don't come back more often    In comparison strip location felt location better tasting adobada  Plus less busy check food much faster    If you've NEVER tacos el gordo just counter food order right away want  There's usually carne asada line adobada line  your food then counter pay    Must try tacos your choice fave adobada ask pineapple it campechana fries carne asada + adobada  YUM!   Honestly can't wait till next cheat day come here  <EOR> If looking good quality cheap eats some places open really late ONE  Tacos EL Gordo hase open kitchen few staffs constantly sweep floor wipe tables  probably cleanest taco joint ever seen  favorite tacos Taco De Adobada Taco De Lengua spicy pork beef tongue   Spicy pork tender juicy flavorful  Beef tongue comes huge chunks the most generous portion but then again cost $2 25   always leave feeling satisfied comforted visiting Tacos El Gordo  <EOR> The food ok but worth wait line 45 min line only moved half way  ordering system horrible if your hungry don't frustrate you! <EOR> Tripas tacos salty  Asked pineapple tacos still forgot  before impressed  But time  really need set better strategy ordering food  would recommend order pay cashier wait your order called  Simple right? <EOR> After hearing friend reading reviews decided give shot disappointed! tried taco el pastor carne asada taco carne quesadilla carne fries a lot know all amazing  top carne generous amount fresh guac blow your mind fresh made corn tortillas die for  pork awesome especially watching cut right off spit  little confused order busy but just ask anybody able help you  only thing would done differently asked some salsa side  Besides loved food! <EOR> This place took straight days college crossing borders eating tacos   really different lines different meats   going back sure  <EOR> Shy driving across border Mexican tacos get  Want cabeza tacos? some sesos?

No course  silly head big   But Mexican did higher expectations place?  Probably       yeah   may love much everyone else but no means did it   Heck if only tried adobado spicy pork tacos I'd probably give five star   While we're tripas intestines pretty damn good well definitely don't mind tongue either     What gets though carne asada   No matter much toppings your taco whether partake those chiles there's no escaping fact meat just pretty bland me   Every single time whether taco form top fries just really doesn't me   huge disappointment because whenever tacos always want carne asada   While complaining horchata tasted pretty watered down whenever although whipped orange delicious     This actual Mexican franchise should commended having body parts turn average person off   Tongue brains intestines name all range good great adobado being star place   set little weird most people thus causes everyone think start right side thus delaying quest those delicious adobado tacos but once through process quick enough    If you're adventurous enough come down try those tacos you'll never see Taco Bell   If you're well then I'd still choose carne asada tacos over Taco Bell  <EOR> This ain't Taco HELL play Taco Bell if u didn't one? !!!  Like Tacos Mexico really intestine tacos = YUM  Don't judge deep fried goodness intestines    all things fried delicious  Just something bout eating fresh veggies salsa    I can't enough but far used driving  Which prolly why crave all time    <EOR> The tacos amazing worth sometimes long lines!  food 5 stars The ordering method HORRIBLE!!! wish could just line order 3 confusing time consuming if want 2 different types tacos stand 2 different lines   really practical  The restaurant experience would rate 2  <EOR> A short distance all commercialized mayhem Strip little taste Tijuana  Tacos El Gordo open late  Until time ask?

If want multiple types then need stand different lines   why buddy system works wonders especially if all want little everything  Even then still ended consuming partially cold food because greedy wanted stuff each queues restaurant   I heard step previous location almost no seating  came Friday night definitely jam packed peeps but able secure table four without any problems  Again where buddy system comes into play everyone needs due diligence almost fun all need work together ensure don't starve end all   I would run down each taco meats but spicy pork chorizo asada variations all delicious  only STUFFED meat eat some fork before trying finish off hands  No complaints every morsel absolutely fantastic  think extra love flavor comes amazing handmade in house created tortillas  Those things perfecto eyes   One thing must asada fries  You're able any meat but beef fab  large share amongst four full grown adults barely finished  full various tacos just pounded took lot courage energy muster strengeth finish heaping amount delicious fries topped steak guac cheese sour cream  You're gonna feel you're give birth when you're done but every bite worth pain you'll feel over eating   Parking cinch share spaces huge shopping center   If you're Vegas check place out  delicious! <EOR> I complaining years no fast food mexican spots vegas clubbing  till friends said should try spot  no way legit mexican spot vegas know it  Well definitely wrong  ordered adobado fries kind carne asada fries but better  pretty good opinion  good thing walking distance surrender xs!

Best tacos Vegas HANDS DOWN!!! <EOR> As taco master back la confidently judge tacos   I hungry wanted quick fix popped joint   interesting different meats different lines  settled El lengua taco cabeza carne asada fries  disappointed flavors  Everything tasted smokey if needed grill change   Also quite pricey tacos compared la tacos  Overall skip tacos vegas  <EOR> Main Foods Tacos Meat  Price $  Date Visited April 2015  Verdict did know Tacos taste gold   Be prepared line long time cause place popular  separate lines different types meat sure line pork my recommendation but generally longest line   staff extremely efficient though  Best if you're town   Adobada spiced pork reminds taste Char Siu BBQ Pork Canto Cuisine   warm juice flows pork itself fuses cold sauce pork well spiced prepared complements crisp yet soft tortilla  only complain WHY HELL SMALL  ordered 3 still did enough it  Going more next time Vegas   I lost memory only remember beef  Should Suadero Cabeza beef crispy bit blander previous taco  But serves excellent transition taco before Adobada <EOR> Wow place pack line door but don't discourage wait worth best tacos side town OC heard place through friend happy came ALPASTOR good slice pineapple  tacos tame back Mexico City comfort food  disappointed promise you  bring your appetite munch on  <EOR> It place find when Vegas Real Mexican food    the green chili food but need request or <EOR> So husband told coworker if we're Vegas must check Tacos El Gordo abliged  sorry say blown away food  fact pretty shocked find whole wall type establishment nice part town  Anyway tacos similarly dissapointing because carne asada lover did love carne asada  taste backyard bbq grill where taste charcol if sense?   ugh  buche okay sope overfried    the orchata dispensed through those soda machines taste nothing orchata  just wasnt very satisfied meal all! OH grilled onions decent  also didn't set kinda confusing  something guess supposed different stations depending type meat your ordering most convenient  if want steak station if want pork another another  wasn't sure if supposed form line each if just slide down next    it's weird  <EOR> Best tacos quesadillas Vegas! Saturday's Sunday's slammed! Horchata Tacos does any better! <EOR> This list while visiting Vegas  afraid would crazy busy based Yelp reviews  When pleasantly surprised  Also weekday   There different lines different meats  see could kind inconvenient if crowded especially if you're yourself want taste everything  suggest going least 1 other person don't wait all lines  no problem though because pretty empty! Once all your food pay separate station   We ordered 2 carne asada tacos 2 adobada tacos carne asada adobada fries  All items delicious  Personally enjoyed adobada meat more carne asada  thought tastier good flavor  those fries hard finish all! P If ever come back would just adobada fries   Service friendly place nicely kept  Since different lines different meats would suggest knowing want before entering  <EOR> Not sure hype all about  place dirty shithole captured some Tijuana vibe correctly   My Tacos El Gordo experience took just 50 minutes 3 soggy tacos just under $7 dollars   There several lines need particular items then need in to another unorganized line pay  Oh those lines enjoy watching people cut front making more frustrating    The food itself average  Definitely worth waiting for   My freshly pressed tortillas obliterated time hit checkout due amount salsa cook ladled each taco    Now actual tacos  asada  overshadowed handful cilantro onions full ladle salsa some green shit represented quacamole devoid any palatability  al pastor pretty much same  chorizo taco bad other much salsa gave rough gut  Most meat asada taco gristly ended pitching trash along two other worthless tacos   I can't really say tortillas anything special other pressed right front you  know all salsa dumped upon tacos 5 minutes tortillas useless ingredient holders left taco mess   Pack fork and possibly your firearm ccw pay cash prepared wait while if venture weekend  Otherwise few options right road less expensive chaotic actually enjoy food  <EOR> Not much else say here  Try variety  Lunch better later day  Pork left carne sad middle rest around right  Longest line carne  All wraps whether taco tostadas great   If friends split order each station   Basic tasty rustic tacos  <EOR> Ask people where best tacos town most them answer  long overdue return visit of sorts concur   Tacos El Gordo Tijuana import way California  slinging some best street tacos around  visited Strip location once couple years ago but comparison some other taquerias convenient visit restaurant Charleston  mention prices which equal if higher others sales ever appearing at least eyes ears   But if want delicious tacos all proper fixings price isn't big concern then choose guys   Like some its close competitors or used to Tacos El Gordo system where order first then pay last  meats divided station asada taking huge grill itself left al pastor adobada occupying vertical spit right rest meats enjoying bath sauna center  may line 3 times and probably should nice bring friends  Luckily work quickly enough able handle myself during Monday lunch rush   I tried all meats taco form list them best worst per impression Asada $2 25 used think Taco Tijuana best asada but par perhaps even better  pico guac beef juicy acidic just freaking good even when gets cold you've waiting lines  might just touch salty but  nothing slice radish two can't take care of   Al pastor $2 25 excellent just touch shy favorite ever town   dude actually waited vertical spit turn just right spot cut caramelized meat  sure pineapple complimentary available upon request  They're must have topping lend perfect sweetness even though relatively large slices bit clunky   Buche $2 25 flavorful tender pork stomach not belly served red sauce  least good used consider favorite buche town but felt able taste more pork here   Lengua $2 40 confused cabeza first but definitely superior head meat  beef tongue flavorful despite being last bites meal green tomatillo sauce perfect acidic complement  certainly better lengua tacos around town although comes premium price _that_ much higher   Suadero $2 25 beef shoulder served red sauce  pretty salty little dry tough but marinated flavor meatiness great option  other salty dishes bite crunchy radish available cart near fountain drinks helps take away edge enough   Tripas $2 25 crispy fried beef intestine w red sauce  definitely overly salty intense  While serviceable standouts here  least two local taco places better tripas   Cabeza $2 25 cow head meat tomatillo sauce  tender while first bite delicious rest fell flat noticed cabeza sometimes does  Perhaps lacking some fatty cartilaginous pieces would standout   Cesos $2 40 cow brain served tomatillo sauce  Subtle flavor could just detect  know should soft but little mushy side  texture concern extra cost why I'd say least desirable meat but still worth try if stomach space   For delicious Mexican street tacos Tacos El Gordo really should top your list  Assuming taco craving don't wanna wait special sales would first recommendation tacos general asada buche particular  Choose location if you're area otherwise really wanna avoid Strip traffic  <EOR> This place crowded   lines   may eat outside   Just other reviews say sure wait correct line ordering only pastor tacos shortest line happened wanted   know order several street tacos ordered total 12 pastor tacos corn tortillas 2 drinks which came under $25   When wait line order your food hey your tacos fresh next register pay   restaurant small crowded people holding tables friends family but when outside outdoor overflow seating no still cold but bad able bear cold fill bellies pastor goodness day   tacos themselves very good!  Pork marinated well enough flavor spice when topped some lime juice washed down horchata good!  Tacos El Gordo your tacos legit  <EOR> They very yummy food! Flavorful definitely authentic  couple cons set unorganized much sitting room  I loved sope! melted cheese   cheese! goodness just perfect mixture flavor  <EOR> BOOOMB ASS TACOS!!!!! Great flavor haven't some good real mexican tacos long time! <EOR> Before die order four tacos de adobado con piña  extra cilantro sauce  Hands down favorite tacos ever  downside place aren't many veggie options carnivore friends only  <EOR> Seriously best tacos town   favorites carne asada tacos adobada tacos   carne asada fries worth try too   adobada taco meat carved right off slab onto your taco   If only going order kind taco ONE   workers quick efficient   would suggest getting 4 5 tacos fill up   open until 2 am weekdays 4 am weekends which nice plus! <EOR> Finally chance come really nice  Enjoyed food big big portions  Food didn't take long come enjoyed rock music actually place when wasn't busy shocking <EOR> Any visitor Las Vegas needs hit spot if ever claimed enjoy tacos  bomb spot gotta them carne fries wonder why McDonald's subway all over country!! <EOR> Great little taco shop visit Vegas!! Very reasonable prices some best tacos ever great lunch dinner even late night out! All corn tortillas hand made delicious    Just word advice different stations let order tacos different meats but adobada definitely best menu  adobada spit rotates outside part gets cut nice char it  Then topped onions cilantro top couple corn tortillas! Order your food your food then cashier pay    This definitely places least once every time Vegas! <EOR> Most authentic taqueria ever  fresh tortillas being constantly made Asada pastor meat being cut right front you  must if Vegas area  away strip hour best meal you'll eat while Vegas  Tacos El Gordo must  <EOR> Ya te sale bien caro! Los tacos están buenos pero son chicos y ya sale lo mismo que comer en un restaurant más formal  <EOR> I Tacos El Gordo San Diego when came Vegas try out  let down! all   lines long but cooks fast orders fast  Everything fresh place very clean busy restaurant   enjoy all meats Carne asada Mulas point    Enjoy your meal! <EOR> Omg  If could give place 100 stars would!! place does right!!

The only gripe find place ordering little confusing  There's really line    several lines blurred into one?  sure    But if throw couple bucks tip jar chefs usually walk through everything pay special attention sure you're good  <EOR> Went back along spicy pork some beef stomach tacos   pork better but stomach solid   place just hits home run every time  Was told nice cashier going opening location strip mall right next encore   Strip just past Encore coming Venetian Bellagio etc  heading towards Stratosphere  Good  times  <EOR> The food good but wasn't good all hype  worth line outside cold overpriced  <EOR> I'm huge fan place!!  thing really missed LA tacos   guisados taco trucks ones street ladies cooking cart   I miss all it   Tacos really hard find Vegas   am personally big fan tex mex tacos   I want straight street tacos nothing but meat cilantro onions occasional sauce   I've tried tacos cardenas think decently good   When tacos el gordo Friday night course line   moved fast though   place unique several lines   Lines depend meat want your tacos   everything lengua tripe asada al pastor   didn't carnitas though   lined infamous spicy pork line   When guy asked 2 spicy pork al pastor   he told same thing   thought weird because thought different   Anyhow 3 tacos asked them pineapples complimentary side     I another line pay   Finding seats hard busy night but people eat fast just keep eye out   loved tacos!!

The taco dilemma full effect here  combination plate should create?  My Taco Creation 2 Asada asada nice  wasn't full fatty pieces nor over salty  taste bite feel you're your mothers vecindario  4 25 5 1 Lengua always need tongue action Tacos El Gordo gave nicely  Soft chewy flavorful no fault here  4 25 5 1 Al Pastor Would 2 but someone drunk dropped one  favorite them all  meat marinated perfection  4 75 5 1 Asada Sope okay sope ingredients eh  3 5  Tortillas handmade but street taco mercado taco  Fits schema well    Customer Service Mexican fast paced meaning no smiles just order keep moving except cashier Tacos made eaten here  quite simple  <EOR> Well is   If want those little tacos sizzling meat slabbed grilling topped veggies pico de gallo other sauces all 10 seconds flat tasting all delish proper grilled taste place go   close facsimile El Taorina except think better     Line doesn't move terribly fast but once order quickly   Then line pay line take bit also but all all bad wait overall   guess all depends when if 15 20 people line see taking bit time before sit down eat   only couple tables open cashing but only spent total less 10 minutes through entire process    pretty good level busy ness think   The Asada Adobada both very good but spicy adobada took cake   Outstanding stuff   $2 each thinking 3 enough most maybe 4 bad price lunch definite bargain dinner   Table for 1 Factor Well fast food type place certainly fine but you'll hard time feeling good taking whole table all yourself all those people waiting     Take go  <EOR> *Thumbs up* Tres tacos de adobada por favor  Thats all need know  love color flavor spicy kick pork  variation al pastor but better  carne asada okay but boring  lengua also standout  Wallet friendly prices which such welcome relief Vegas Strip  especially if you're dirt frickin' poor losing all your money gambling   *Thumbs down* First time stepping bit confusing where order  supposed different stations each type taco but just brush your Spanish loco  Just look big rotating juicy pile meat order there  <EOR> They amazing! Ordered large fry ended messing order but fixed giving another fry extra stuff free amazing <EOR> So last full   went some friends   I still lengua asada   eating slow appreciate good food here   but that'll hard do  <EOR> Tacos El Gordo BEYOND fire  always only al pastor tacos green creamy sauce combination spicy salsa everything! Best tacos Las Vegas! <EOR> The tacos unquestionably some best ever life  without doubt    The downsides Tacos El Gordo It worst lines systems world  far efficiency worst  Combine cramming people every side really begins your nerves when you're hungry  Also far everyone speaking language don't understand things difficult   With all being said         those al pastor tacos   ask pina pineapple man die for  <EOR> 2 Asian girls 1 white guy   that first thought walking into door tacos el gordo  never felt place before only non Mexicans but everyone super nice  adobada guy even offered sample slice  reminded little Korean spicy pork  adobada taco carne asada taco chorizo sope  There assembly line first woman making tortillas hand  adobada everything yelpers said was! Spicy bit crispy much fat  definitely want adobada fries next time   Carne asada ok but fav  thinly sliced vs chopped most Mexican places  nice tender good flavor which ruined awful pasty guacamole automatically topped with  guac pretty damn bad   Chorizo sope good least greasy chorizo ever  Mexican white cheese melted top  texture almost good mozzarella  better sopes BUT also worse Neighborhood way sketchy but Tacos el gordo very clean 2 ladies just bussing tables there's quick turn over  Parking lot well lit felt pretty safe there  great Mexican but probably would only back if general area  stuck traffic electric Daisy over half hour drive side town  <EOR> Best carne asada tacos ever restaurant! guys open location Phoenix AZ! Guacamole pretty good too  <EOR> Best tacos Vegas  place always packed can't enough tacos al pastor  really enjoyed buche tacos affordable price $2 full meal entire family under $30 which deal Las Vegas  <EOR> It lines depending kind meat want your tacos quesadillas tostadas   ordered carne asada al pastor tacos   carne asada tacos good but al pastor excellent craved al pastor   pile meat add onions cilantro guacamole salsa   want more taco   If San Diego Las Vegas must place tacos   Yummy! <EOR> The tacos al pastor best outside Mexico  If order fries $2 enough 4 people  <EOR> Holy moly Batman tacos off chain!!!! kid spent lot time visiting TJ always filled tacos   would never expect find them nevada far boarder  But place brougt back all those memories bite taco adobado   tortilla tasted freshly made meat perfect sauce topped of!!! <EOR> This place must go! reviews no lie  hear branch Las Vegas strip better but already very impressed downtown branch  tacos freshly made both meat tortilla! Average price per taco $2 25 which may sound slightly expensive compared taco trucks LA but definitely worth it! Each taco contains LOT meat  only but give very generous amount guacamole per taco  All combined rich flavor reason enough why they're well known! Be prepared wait line least 30 45 minutes though especially Al Pastor  personally did try Al Pastor because line hadn't moved good 15 minutes hungry definitely back try future! also Asada Fries $13!  My advice Eat food order soon it  definitely does difference when eat fresh vs when pack eat back your hotel 15 minutes later! <EOR> Legit Mexican tacos cheap!!  Don't overwhelmed usual long lines move quick!   Different lines depending type meat  If you're familiar type meat ask sample!    Yesss  Just go  always good time tacos!!!! <EOR> My husband discovered place through mighty powers Yelp because high ratings    Upon walking into restaurant first thing see huge meat pineapple  Seriously!   The line pretty long but moved fairly fast  place PACKED! Luckily time spent line spent talking people around find just heck should order heck meat pinapple was   The meat pineapple pork vertical spit pineapple top yummy juices drained down onto meat  Through other patrons found if ordered Tacos de Adobada would partake meat pineapple  also advised order 3 which seemed sufficient amount since rather small  did see several people back second or third meal if you're hungry might want order more    I certainly see going back tradition Vegas visits  food delicious definitely more authentic Nashville  <EOR> My sister said best If love restaurant amazing food bathroom  Accurate AF!!!    We drinking know?  then pops brain   mmm tacos  Normally mom making them just home but when mom busy them place     They all!  Lengua Buche Tripas cachete Al Pastor Adobada course Carne Asada  Al Pastor fries best! them errything!!!  Pineapples too    The only bad thing place bathroom!  Yuck!!!!!! guess supposed single person bathroom because toilet stall but all together    no divider no door when peek crack look floor see eyes feet pooper     nothing!  pretty sure only gets cleaned morning cuz 5pm looks horrible unwelcoming   Long story short afraid wash hands     Highly recommend taking whippes moist towelettes sanitizer  Maybe even table cloth     Another bad thing tables between long ass lines   uncomfortable having people just stare eating hovering over your food    Unless you're stare right back chew mouth open purpose till stop looking me!  The other bad thing place chusma comes eat here   don't mind people really don't just ones short line normally Tripa then ahead order Al Pastor Carne Asada Fries pineapples cebollas mulas huaraches tortas aztecas HBO Netflix horchata tostadas entire family     everything line for!!! business course being nice ahead them but  why people keep doing shit   If your signs says Tripas only take trips orders!!!!! entire menu!!!    Other I'd give place 5 stars  bathroom drops 4    Anglos place safe!  even armed security guard patrol     wait    now think about     maybe means safe      Whatever worth risk     <EOR> It's good San Diego! Takes 45 minutes front line Adobada  actually Adobada Fries menu too!   The same great service you'd original Tacos El Gordo location H Street  place bigger Palm Street location  plus but oh man packed here    The Al Pastor Adobada meat juicy tender  special guacamole sauce nice creamy which great adobada    I definitely recommend swinging if you've never if you're just craving some tacos  Tacos El Gordo sets standard higher ever when comes Tacos Adobada Fries  <EOR> This place joke system ordering horrible could loose mind waiting line heat  2 hours line just end walking because taquero would stop every 5 min knows back  Tried some meat boyfriends tacos tried better tacos better price way shorter wait time  Point would recommend place unless hire least 20 more people  <EOR> The worst part moving sd Vegas lack bomb mexi food thank god tacos el Gordo followed here  continue gordo <EOR> 1st time today  let start WOW!

Taco de Asada Basically carne asada taco regular fixings   Taste just okay portion beef generous but felt tad dry   3 stars   Taco de Chorizo Made firmer chorizo kind melts into poodle grease spices   Others don't seem care much taco but thought good   4 stars!  Taco de Lingua tongue taco   really want more but just little salty taste   Otherwise portion beef tongue also generous   still give another try   2 5 stars  The grilled scallions roasted pepper good lady behind counter really filled plate even though only needed  scallions   might used more if scallions chopped but chalk being traditional authentic way served street taco carts   Oh yea tacos big disposed off easily 3 4 normal bites but $2 each plus tax generous meat toppings still good yummy deal   Décor 2 5  Very modest but first foremost food right? Food 4 5  Overall very pleased tacos here   If closer likely least 1 2 week alas lot traffic lights drive through 35mph  Service 5 5  low cost unpretentious restaurant service friendly fast  Cleanliness 5 5  something said staff keeps busy front restaurant area spotlessly clean   Very nice! Parking 3 5  May find closest parking spaces but many strip mall  Location 3 5  Located probably best part town but location surrounded bulk targeted demographic heavily traversed street no less   Perhaps bit way those living West side 15 but drive wasn't bad later evening once traffic dies down   4 Stars! <EOR> I'm taco man tacos el gordo great local favorite  slap yo mama good but doesn't disappoint if need quick meal just something settle long night drinking  Tacos $2 lines food separated whatever meat want  location isn't busy strip location thankfully but does packed certain times  downside being strip closes earlier   If you're hanging downtown need some dank Mexican food then spot perfect you  tacos quick good im particularly big fan quesadillas  nachos middle road but somehow nacho fries off chain probably best item  something would recommend sharing because big filling  also good jamaica orange bang if you're into those drinks  <EOR> Lots different meats but kind rude food kind over priced did salsa bar  think place over rated some people  <EOR> I heard nothing but good reviews place  First time super packed !

The line system kind inconvenient  If want Adobada Al Pastor Asada wait 2 different lines  If want buche lengua tripa another line  if want variety meats could potentially standing 3 long lines  recommend come group split yourselves into each line  wanted tripa tacos but decided against because meant would wait additional 30 minutes time crunch  <EOR> Awesome place eat tacos Baja California style  place always packed food deliciously great  Good parking space music great food reasonable price  First time tasted tacos almost ten years ago San Diego Ca  Finger locking good  <EOR> OK place all time favorite taco place EVER! food amazing  Once actually it  ONLY downfall HUGE ASS LONG LINE!
