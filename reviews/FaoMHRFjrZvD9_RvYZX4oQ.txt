INFURIATED!!!!!! <EOR> Love food   but service! According receipt server Terry   When started order she told she noticed last time didn't throw away food before left needed that   When called number used word guest but did feel guest   never known restaurant forces eater bus own table unless worked there   Seeing don't Popeye's uniform am paid Popeye's bus tables   I am pretty sure don't work there   college did work fast food know workers prefer customers work them but tell customer he outrageous! <EOR> Very very very very rude customer service  forgot half  order when back see manager Alma store manager rudest them all  Even showing receipt she still wanted dispute fact forgot half order  She never said thank you  Never apologize inconvenience   other Popeyes around Vegas  yourself favor don't one  calling corporate first thing morning  Alma customer service your gig maybe need find another job since your unhappy one  <EOR> So guys sell just pieces chicken without combos but when comes Shrimp no knows do? cashier confused  drive thru asked just box shrimp  No combo no sides just shrimp  She lost she never heard before  Kept questioning me  Then asks side would like  Again said no sides  She said she would price window  window she says Did 10 piece combo? said no    just wanted Shrimp    Again confused look  She grabs manager he gives price  He didn't hesitate    I am now sitting parking lot because shrimp going take 2 minutes cook  sitting 5 minutes now  probably don't even remember car in      The manager felt bad waiting long he gave two orders shrimp  kind him    Gotta train those front line employees correctly  much respect manager  He working hard smart  He made trip location better  <EOR> Rude inefficient  Took forever  couldn't even speak English order  pointing it  Food good   only reason more 1 star  <EOR> Some times just need lubricate your innards tastiest place so    I cravings greasy fried chicken but unfortunately no stores near when see am all over it!  This N only fast food places where eat   Gotta some vices  <EOR> Best bunch  chicken overlooked other ones Vegas  Popeyes closer but if starving come one  lot same workers past few years which always plus  usually enough chicken hand fill your order even when car line 5+    If New Orleans tastes closest opinion <EOR> I think all locations favorite  didn't used way  Trust   Employees definitely par service very standard  Wait times short food always fresh hot    I normally come Tuesday catch $0 99 special between hours 11 1230 almost 100% guarantees super fresh chicken   The only downside tables cleaned fast enough when busy  <EOR> I only come occasional two for Tuesday special  service standard chain never any issues having wait long order them running out  Overall satisfactory experience typically  <EOR>
