It's open  chipotle  little small side but there's extra seating mall  <EOR> This place ghetto! But only cheap sort healthy place near work can't complain  prices little bit more probably 25cents more them would usually pay  bad being strip! I love chicken bowl which rice beans usually without beans because hate beans your choice salsa sour cream lots lettuce  also love chicken salad sauce give just right  They offer other meat besides chicken steak carnitas Barbacoa  No worries if your vegetarian veggie burrito bowl  <EOR> I fan years but when moved Vegas LA seems Vegas Chipotles skimp portions WTH?!
