She only waitress saw     seems odd given Saturday morning    The food your average breakfast  could cooked same breakfast home     Our waitress took sweet time when came giving check  mean when you're ready you're ready go    I back place  <EOR> Friends invited breakfast Saturday morning trying new places   impressed   all   Save your money IHOP   even Denny's   Waitress slow never refilled water even when ASKED orange juice came tiny 8oz cup $3 hash browns tasted corn starch   drown them ketchup Tobasco pepper them barely palatable   I am really glad just something small   Even still took forever come place wasn't even half full   Ugh  <EOR> We finally butts try new place   usually Griddle Memphis BBQ brunch brunch Republic   Since didn't want spend much just breakfast opted New Day Cafe down street   used location Las Palmas   full Griddle which nice since no wait   offer pretty good selection breakfast lunch   Huevos Rancheros partner Tommy B  Vegetarian platter   always order Huevos Rancheros breakfast surprised fry tortillas ask want your eggs   Normally tortillas fried eggs always sunny side up   say though variation really tasty   fried tortillas added another layer flavor   actually didn't use any ketchup   usually drench eggs ketchup but food flavorful didn't need condiment   partner enjoyed vegetarian omelet   also offer Egg Beaters egg whites healthier choice egg dishes which nice health conscious   Overall place very quaint restaurant when don't want fight lines IHOP Griddle  <EOR> I walked place felt having breakfast relatives house  really nice area   guess expected more decor?  We talked grabbed table back which no place settings  service fast polite    I ordered power omelet which egg white turkey bacon spinach  pretty tasty but am positive recreate omelet home    I fact customize your sides  omelet came cottage cheese but allow choose fruit french fries    I think total around $9 item which guess comparable IHOP Denny's but more food those places   I personally would pass but if coupon it! <EOR> Food average   bad but nothing special   Hard impress breakfast   Service   again average   whole place just average   wouldn't point again but might stop give another try  <EOR> I really want place  nopales cactus which love scrambled eggs but others noted portions small while price similar other breakfast places Egg Works Egg others        Service hit miss sometimes okay other times negligent  Coffee pretty good but challenging refills without asking  And even if ask may come  brought friend couple times he no longer wants there  servers seem going through motions  rude just seem kind apathetic  sure describe it    It's okay bringing kids but again pricing exorbitant some cases like juice coffee iced tea     There better places breakfast price far better service  Unfortunately drive bit farther them  <EOR> A mom pop CLEAN breakfast joint  could use decorator but nice  could also use door front kitchen least fan because little smokey dinning area  But would definitely recommend place non stiff people  Its delicious warm comfy breakfast restaurant  <EOR> New Day Cafe hole wall breakfast lunch spot  Ive 3 times now  Its rather laid back restaurant when walk waitress tells sit where ever want  Seems rather lazy part  Breakfast selection limited 2 pages    On other hand food bad  french toast club which very unique filling  morning tried California Omlete which great well   The reason only rated 3 stars service could better we made requests weren't fulfilled more napkins? C'mon    toast burnt side wasn't pre buttered which made almost hard rock   But Im sure wind again  <EOR> Alright school when daughter said she hungry New Day Cafe just staring face    I Tuna Melt alfafa sprouts avocado  tuna salad is grilled almost patty seeing interesting  sandwich tasty     The Mango slushy very refreshing  My daughter enjoyed french toast well    So because visit better last earned another star me!!!! <EOR> This second visit breakfast   husband noticed because close house right off Silverado Ranch Maryland   Both times really enjoyed meals   Definitely members clean plate club!  Each time gone husband ordered New Day Cafe Special Huevos Racheros   invited parents come second time breakfast   Yelp check in offer free coffee latte order entree   waitress speak manager find special valid for    it's only good 1 drink off 1 ticket   1 drink off each entree    The food really fresh coffee good   mom loved sugar free latte   husband really liked caramel latte   thoroughly enjoyed chai tea latte! It's really cute small restaurant   Quick friendly service   We'll back! <EOR> For breakfast cafe am sure most ever achieve above 3 star system  food tasty had french toast cinnamon roll although service little slow times  Good location ample parking though always plus  <EOR> Came around 10am Saturday  Only few tables being used  Sat down ordered drinks  the coffee very good   waffle hubby tried burger fries  Service ok  waffle brought 4 minutes before burger which odd  nice fluffy but nothing amazing  Hubby said burger ok  snuck few fries fresh crisp  nice place but truthfully regulars @ Griddle most likely won't back anytime soon  <EOR> Good basic breakfast nothing fancy but lots variety many appetites  <EOR> Wanted try new cafe! Very small but extremely friendly staff  Orders prompt delicious! Menu cheap affordable  bagel sandwich very delicious home fries even better  Great service good food thanks having us! <EOR>
