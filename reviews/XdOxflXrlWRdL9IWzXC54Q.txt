Dinner time but ridiculous!!!!! Our appetizers came just before entrees ordered stuffed mushrooms  garlic breads came nice warm but hard zupa toscana soup delicious however salad hardly any dressing more croutons onions then lettuce tomatoes  ordered shrimp fettuccine which hardly any alfredo sauce dried pretty quick didn't much shrimp no more 10 pcs mind dinner plates! ordered take 2 which both chicken broccoli alfredo sauce  paid almost 60 food OK! <EOR> Your usual Olive Garden Italian dinner but good decent service    Had chicken scampi  promised creamy garlic sauce  good but when think garlic think GARLIC  spoiled eating smaller Italian places don't hold back garlic guess  said though good    This would good safe place bring your family friends  Just don't plan being impressed food  <EOR> Awful customer service  never come back  Waiter took forever come take order didn't receive salad breadsticks until 25 mins sodas served  Waiter served 5 tables that came us instead us  When waiter noticed guests table she then started coming over table refilled all empty drinks brought salad over   I let waiter know waiting over 40 mins food she snapped back stating know don't know why taking forever Food came 10 mins later     waiter came back let know she spoke manager offered free dessert  Some food orders wrong didn't bother sending back because would've probably taken another hour food  <EOR> Ate other evening some town family members  Justin server pleasure  He really offered great suggestions appetizers entrees into desserts  great dining experience all us  <EOR> My fiancé came everyday while he Never Ending Pasta Pass bragged Centennial location    cleanliness staff  just recently visited together management team staff absolutely wonderful  Kacie absolute delight made feel family  She's amazing manager! Highly recommend coming! <EOR> When family needs carbohydrate overload Olive Garden  family four all never ending pasta bowl promotion  salad breadsticks lived OG reputation did pastas sauces   We visited location many times varying levels  service ranging poor great  review stars more service most recent visit  server Sara not sure spelling she attentive very personable  restaurant very busy Saturday night but she didn't feel rushed she took time actually speak us  If recommend asking her  <EOR> Well always come today 2 10 18 aren't serving Lobster ravioli pasta chip nachos  too  waitress attitude slow   If ask more soup she acts asking world  She worried people behind us   This worst services ever  <EOR> My brother came dinner 5 days initially opened  everything seemed fine until suddenly he stops eating moves plate away him   wasn't he explained something plate he thought did belong salad took plate looked it   Lo behold dead fly remainder salad   Obviously happy called management   comped meals apologetic which fine weren't going big deal scene however left uneasy feeling hoped next time would better visit    We jump today decided give another wanted celebrate family event Cheyenne location far away residence   should just gone extra distance!  While food did contain any unwanted critters special surprises service itself displeasing   Drinks forgotten drinks came late entrees came 45min finished appetizers no refills offered many times could other people working possibly ask server come back table To Go containers dessert orders check?!  totally ludicrous!   I love going Olive Garden   enjoy going celebrate events just because     However surely pass going specific location time being   Perhaps need re evaluate staffing management matter  <EOR> I'm sure Olive Garden's call ahead waitlist system works but pointless one  Called ahead 7 00 told them party 6 would 20 25 minutes which told long wait then when check call ahead waitlist told wait another 20 25 minutes  almost 40 minutes later still seated  Olive Garden should just rid waitlist find better system  <EOR> The look olive garden some much warmer older ones  Plus feels more upscale   The place super clean  come often over course time few issues  But anytime issue managers fix quick always coming tables  <EOR> After reading some reviews seems  majority gripes involve staff   With mind low expectation service wife would receive  arrived earlier wife soon walked host greeted eccentric Welcome! then random comment didn't quite hear  He friendly girl behind check in booth  Thursday night no wait other own personal wait wife    Service fast waitress friendly but rude either  food came very quick  quick sitting entree basically full soup bowl   worthy gripe opinion just something note  capellini ordered decent nothing special   The thing did notice wanted mention prices menu charge  Every item receipt just little more expensive presented menu  capellini menu 11 50 but check said 11 99 dipping sauce 3 75 charged 3 79 etc    huge deal even big enough say anything but menu outdated which unlikely since just opened location OG figured clever way sneaking few extra dollars per ticket  subtle really notice even complain about  don't know judge   Overall decent experience  <EOR> Food excellent service fantastic   only reason rank low due sewage stink literally right outside front door   only could kill your appetite before but could lose fine meal way out   Sorry say but truth  <EOR> Service always great   never come received bad mehhhh service   Food always same other restaurants   think ambiance servers place great experience is  <EOR> We seated immediately  Server knowledgable pointed menu's newest items  hard pass soup salad   so ordered  Soup delicious salad fresh crisp  <EOR> I've coming all life but first time lunch  duos only sized right but more importantly priced right  salad keeps coming back always delicious! <EOR> Since last review back couple times no complaints  Fast friendly service delicious entrees can't forget unlimited salad breadsticks meal  5 stars <EOR> No time management servers  Regardless if you're busy should least communicate inconvenience customers timely manner  very fond location  <EOR> Everybody loves Carb garden unless your diet because hard come fall victim breadsticks pasta   Came early dinner specials going which really good deals got  particular location very nice slow when came attended seated quickly  special found online but when handed menus kinda hard find when did find wasn't very specific just based off knowledge remembered looking online  waiter friendly he offered kid drink another tables mess drink made two accident table which thought nice him  Everything tasted remember previous Olive Garden experiences nothing changed  recommend place if your craving pasta never wrong coming but would recommend catching specials because sometimes really good ones  <EOR> We sat bar server great! African American gentleman Atlanta working closing shift Sunday 26th  He friendly polite always top offering more soup bread etc  far best service ever experienced OG  wish knew name  guy could easily server very high end restaurant  chicken parm pretty salty but hubby enjoyed chicken shrimp carbonara  All really needed salad breadsticks wine anyway  <EOR> When think darn good salad bread sticks else comes mind  NOBODY! And appetizers find don't like  love stuffed mushrooms   My wife loves soup salad  And love tour Italy  The only problem can't eat all because you've eaten two half bowls salad four whole breadsticks  down few glasses   But leave happy full every time   And amount money spend I'd extra mints lol <EOR> Let's Olive Garden NEVER vocabulary always disappointing far food goes  However location received excellent customer service to go order  While card being run observed bored looking folded armed bartenders before rush really nice decor  calamari ordered tough side but fried mozz good  stuffed mushrooms odd taste  more masked stuffing they're recommendable but they're rave worthy  If love Olive Garden location exceptional respectful service  <EOR> Unfortunately terrible experience location  past weekend submitted order online pick curbside To Go around 9pm  order pick time 9 40pm  family showed 5 mins early parked designated To Go parking spots  9 55 still sitting waiting no even bothered come say anything bring order collect payment etc  mom inside see going only greeted some rude lady told didn't orders 9pm which news would've just gone inside initially she didn't even see car monitor anyway which complete lie because mom said she could see car monitor just fine   mom asked if she could please just order could way STILL wasn't even ready    hour+ later  When home took everything opened Alfredo dipping sauce ordered breadsticks surprise maybe whopping 2 3 tablespoons sauce $4 giant sauce container  Needless say super disappointed Olive Garden super close house but  returning location  I'd rather drive over Cheyenne  <EOR> Stopped quick bite drink  Food great but waiter Austin really great  He made experience better  <EOR> Waitress food great   however need sure kitchen staff under staffed  <EOR> Alright grand opening day Olive Garden location  much review feedback constructive criticism management Upon entering wait name taken given wait time accurate estimate 5 10 minutes  hostesses could more professional more friendly first last impression restaurant should taken into consideration them more smiles eye contact necessary guests appreciate more more patient when staff warm friendly sincere speaking sincere hosts attitude voices forced far meaning say such thank  sorry being host previous assistant manager restaurant myself small details pertinent  Mirror personality your guests create bond interaction  host led seat more friendly personable smiling explaining server would did leave parting comment enjoy  thank    Also casual fine dining atmosphere slang lack professionalism should no where near here  No wants hear ok GUYS you're table done good go  Follow back wayyyy  want if want much more proper say would if would   looking party shouting last name through three sections restaurant BAXTER!

My server Devon  waited 4 minutes greeted bad  She looked rushed frustrated table behind waiting 15 minutes helped until manager came take order  Employees your managers help don't sacrifice patience enjoyment party waiting because hurried ask help greet take order just few minutes could lose tip customer forever  She didn't offer wine even remove glasses table when mentioned only came dessert nor she very savvy menus quite sure if she even looked before because asked question having another dessert menu she searched frantically saying lemme see if its back here  told already checked wasn't  She sort shocked said she would ask bar if one  Came back later took order didn't collect menus until half way through  Once she rushed she smiled made eye contact  Confidence key employees act know doing move grace don't let frantic show your face all fooled in good way   She waited bring check didn't rush appreciate    The Dolcinis two frostbitten completely frozen strawberry tiramisu lemon mousse perfect  Writing review waiting other two defrost enough taste flavor ice    Overall first day bumpy but going well see  All rest come time  Thank management! wish all well your business personal endeavors!

WTF!!! didn't even ask bowl! Now while she someone else brings food  pasta front don't even touch soup    I am disappointed service  really did enjoy dining experience because particular person  would much rather drive extra 5 6 miles down Cheyenne Rd OG  Because 7 years going excellent service   I won't back anytime soon fans Michoacan KNOW provide good meal great service basically same parking lot if want stay close home  <EOR> If enjoy waiting 50 minutes pickup order consisting child's ravioli breadsticks then place you! Especially paying items did order such mango smoothie take girl crumbling your receipt instead giving you   As server myself hard take extra step formally complain bad service but new low   Unacceptable  <EOR> So given Olive Garden two chances both times experience sub par   Tonight ordered via curbside pickup  just Applebee's car side bring food you  told order would ready 6 6 15 no come car just inside  Apparently getting rather large to go order together but still 15 minutes outside waiting seems long   All food good aside bread sticks  some particular reason specific location nastiest bread sticks  Other locations CA don't stale microwave taste hard ends however location stale bread sticks both times here   The servers nice but seemed overwhelmed under trained  fault management setting servers failure!

<EOR> Came around 3 afternoon party 2 small child which sleeping  waiter Semir must say highly satisfied wwith service work ethic  olive garden couple times but never service this   In middle late lunch needed little more cheese salad stopped Austin since Semir little busy other guests  Austin great attitude  He never told he would tell waiter  He just did because he saw waiter busy he wasn't busy  Overall only reasons wasnt 5 stars because saw atleast 6 empty booths when but still 10 min wait  Best servers location date  <EOR> The curbside pick joke  order correct tell certain time end 15 20 minutes late  <EOR> I love going Friday Saturday night  busy wait usually 30 minutes  just sit bar great meal chat bartender  give VIP service really treat right   big into chain restaurants but worth your time  <EOR> Had great dinner tonight  shrimp Alfredo  Plus chose soup chicken dumplings  Also glass Michelle Chardonnay  wonderful dinner excellent service  waiter point refills water checked food served didn't complain much cheese put food Haha  asked booth tried put table no problem found nice booth  Very polite staff food amazing all courses  5 stars definitely  pricey restaurant but if cash spend taste finer foods then definitely stop in  absolutely come back  <EOR> We used Olive Garden cater wedding reception   food amazing did such great job setting everything up   guests loved food disappeared fast!

Also always Alfredo dipping sauce breadsticks! worth it! time shrimp Alfredo  delicious  Although forgot put sun dried tomatoes mix  other people shrimp scampi which really delicious well  dessert waiter highly recommended pumpkin cheesecake  didn't particularly it  should gotten usual Tiramisu!  never wrong with! live learn! still love location probably come next time crave olive garden! <EOR> Thanks location going Macaroni Grill now on   Waited 45 minutes food car side pickup   way compensating time piece chocolate cake extra breadsticks warming food via microwave   dog wouldn't even touch it   Nice $30 meal garbage   NEVER again   lost business  <EOR> Tiffany AMAZING server!

No plates them even asking some  No silverware took 3 minutes some while food just sat table  Then dinner came while finishing appetizers zero room table  transferred leftover food plate just room entrees  No salad breadsticks yet  Exactly 6 minutes into dinner salad came more plates no room  When salad plates delivered obviously right  dishwasher warm hot! plate dried sauce when asked another plate waiter tried wipe off actually ASKED if ok? No don't want someone's leftovers hot plate salad  top off having ask twice breadsticks came everyone just finished dinner  obvious branch very poorly run management staff  only never return 20 years may never return another Olive Garden again  Probably worse dinners ever! If could give zero stars engagement  SAD chain size! <EOR> I think Olive Garden going downhill general many heavy dishes dishes cheese them but service good   cucina mia white wine garlic over angel hair   sauce much thicker cheesier other location normally eat taste   sicilian cheesecake strawberry good but still quite frozen   Also appreciated warning paying games  <EOR> First foremost server Lisa amazing! time crunch because lunch break  She everything very quickly top everything  food delicious lunch special cheap filling!
