Cute place check date friends! <EOR> On Sunday afternoon took parents Fukumimi ramen but usual wait long Chinatown far away  Right dad asked why no else capitalizing ramen craze east side mom remembered Shinya just opened near Hard Rock decided try out    Shinya quite bit bigger most ramen shops town but exceedingly so  other party when arrived seated greeted quickly  ordered couple Sapporos draft $2 opening special right now well order shishito peppers  peppers plentiful thinly shaved bonito top added bit tang sweet charred peppers  ordered miso ramen mom tonkatsu shoyu dad chicken karaage bowl    Shinya offers 6 types ramen 3 which more traditional shio miso tonkatsu other 3 bit more unusual fried chicken chicken vegan   happy see ventured standard toppings well offering fish cake bamboo shoots miso  ramen maybe slightly less noodles some other restaurants easily able finish bowl  broth decent amount kick though did ask some chili oil along it  chashu though absolutely gigantic  give two thick pieces probably 5 6 long  dad's karaage bowl bit small but $4 good snack  asked if he wanted any sauces brought 3 different types try which thought little odd  Why just serve bowl sauces anyways?   Overall Shinya much welcomed much less busy ramen spot newly renovated strip mall across Hard Rock  don't see much reason Fukumimi anymore unless need tan tan men  Hopefully more people give Shinya try succeed  <EOR> I excited eat but very disappointed menu  menu very basic hate names ramen feel very unauthentic  But thought I'd give try since seen some reviews supposedly best ramen town!!! But ordered fired chicken ramen no flavor  needed add much chili paste give broth some type taste  broth tastes very powdery  hope just bad night  really ramen taste  <EOR> Food service excellent!  food super affordable right across Hard Rock Hotel Casino  <EOR> New place delicious food very friendly wait staff  Lots choices   eat again  <EOR> Miso soup spicy as indicated menu but when asked if spicy said no problem  miso ramen which little nephew way color already off  spicy said Miso actually spicy itself  Whaat? let down  Please know your product when say something actually it! Gyoza good but extraordinary  <EOR> This review 3 5 stars   As soft opening expected some hiccups   But overall waitress seemed overwhelmed real novice   She didn't write anything down inevitably screwed both dishes   Chicken mine pork no corn thin noodles mine   Little things could easily taken care if order written down   When food came correctly both chickan tonkatsu broth little meaty but tasty   Mild spice although asked double spicy paste   many noodles liking but might appeal other ramen eaters there   Noodles very thin just your typical variety   far meat both pork chicken outstanding   chicken more shredded rotisserie rather chashu   pork thick pork belly really grilled perfection   rest ramen accompaniments just average complete onion bamboo shoot egg and added corn $1      Because fiasco food manager thankfully gave discount due growing pains new restaurant   really nice simple gesture bring customer back   meat alone Shinya Maru could worth another go maybe try rice bowl instead   Nice near strip side town but surely still better options China Town Southwest  <EOR> The Vegas joint ramen! first breakfast spot morning edc loved food drinks  Joey also such sweetheart sever manager   Attention details 100% Shinya Maru thank great food kind hearted spirits have  <EOR> The ramen delicious  Service friendly nice  rice plate could use little bit work but overall bad  would recommend everyone try ramen house  <EOR> If far away jinya UNLV student waiting jinya reopen renovations update reopened 03 16 17 shinya!
