But waiter really nice  <EOR> I am embarrassed admit actually PF Changs   lot   Chinese food generally greasy but actually tastes healthy   Plus could drink sauce comes lettuce peanut wraps think tasty  <EOR> I typically P F  Chang's but experience planet Hollywood location less ideal   The server brought full bottle champagne when clearly asked 2 glasses she didn't offer take off bill change order   She missing more long occasion!  The food good average most PF Changes but service gives location 2 stars!   Server didn't pay attention could care less! Shame <EOR> I eat PF Chang's District least once month am huge fan menu chain  service usually top notch but experience location worth yelping about    The hostess decided look stood front two minutes  She told wait would 45 minutes  Since meeting long time friend concert didn't mind        We waited waited waited some more  ended waiting over hour fifteen minutes! hostess rude when check it  She made feel bad asking  When finally taken seats wait while waiter  getting used all waiting now even though am starting hunger pains  No big deal    We order waiter comes sauce  Don't usually sauce spiel every time? Maybe just spoiled use good service GV location  Regardless he just poured sauce left  When food rice exact opposite sticky rice  fact hard resembled uncooked rice! Unbelievable  good news Dan Dan Noodles world! distinct flavor cucumber cut heat chile paste perfectly  waiter did ask if wanted them cut  Mongolian Beef also big hit  meal would complete without famous lettuce wraps which delicious usual    Overall satisfied food presentation minus uncooked rice  PF Changs doesn't enjoy food? staff however really rude unprofessional guest highly put off this  Next time am hotel am going sandwich shop sticking PF Changs Green Valley  <EOR> Always enjoyed food ordered chicken lettuce wrap garlic shrimp lobster sauce Chilean sea bass everything delicious! server Brandon really nice gave free tiramisu because Christmas  small portion but hey free!

annoyed rude smart ass remark calmly said no use offers every time them without problem whatever offer time may     long story short annoyed way server spoke decided leave when called manager she brushed off said she just walked into shift just made aware if situation but ore then welcome call back hour speak manager duty   declined decided write comment corporate through main website no response     It's very unfortunate lot great servers location really never give issues but all takes horrible experience want never return  <EOR> Excellent service! Stacy fantastic  She took such good care baby even bringing some grapes while waiting food  Very friendly attentive! All food good came quick  hot sour soup chicken lettuce wraps  Hit spot would again  nice find restaurant casino didn't reek smoke  Clean  Reasonable little pricey depending dish ordered  <EOR> Okay last November friends Vegas stayed Imperial  haven't down strip much yet decided walk tour scrip ended PH  really PH see lot younger crowds other places  But anyways getting hungry though since we're PF Chang  PF Chang wait hour before table  place pretty nice design look very modern  There's upstairs but don't know if you're able eat there?
