This place clean hostesses nice hardworking   When walk you'll surprised giant menu visual menu tv screens!  But always cashiers ask recommend! <EOR> Ended lunch Market Grille Café day Greek on   OK!  Ordered off 'Build Your Own' lunch menu $7 50   Comes your choice main Gyro traditional beef lamb chicken veggie Pomegranate Chicken Mediterranean Wrap chicken gyro falafel veggie And choice side Fries Greek seasoned Basmati Rice Salad spinach Greek I ordered traditional Gyro side fries   Didn't take long order come table maybe 10 minutes   admit looked pretty darn good   Serving size alright   could used few more fries plate those things yummy!  Fresh hot covered Greek seasoning which think some paprika fresh herbs   Gyro good well lots meat little aftertaste laaaaammmmmbbbbb fresh tomatoes nice tangy tzatziki sauce feta cheese chopped parsley load red onions!  lots them!  Luckily onions   Others may bit put off them   But what's Greek food without red onions?  Less stinky LOL   My big gripe lunch menu?  Why doesn't combo come damn drink??  much moolah should least small soda!  am gonna drink all those onions?  did ask water cup which happily obliged   But still did drown lovely onion breath?  Hell no!  Eh resort Altoid   Overall Gyro pretty tasty   lamb beef meat combo flavorful dry but freshness tzatziki sauce parsley took home   pita supple airy but enough heft hold all ingredients   managed finish lunch nicely   I'd back Market Grill Café more if price Gyro bit more reasonable   Greek Mediterranean food but being cheapy eater leaves no qualms going Chipotle few doors down lower priced fatty burrito believe often break tortillas fillings N right across street   Market Grill Café   let drink!  Opa! <EOR> Always great service great food  bomb happy hour too!! Give place try! <EOR> I don't quiet understand all good reviews place  If could divide review into two different categories service food would  would give 4 stars service  first time didn't know menu  lady behind counter very friendly helped pick something menu  lunch special but somehow ended paying way much just lunch  brings second category Food    I'm sure if place listed Greek Mediterranean food but if ever authentic Mediterranean food would know tzatziki Greek yogurt sauce tons garlic  call theirs dill sauce yogurt dill no spices no garlic no flavor  Hubby  ordered gyros which also dry without any flavor  Last but least desert    ordered baklava    First all piece sell huge charge $5  no way anyone would able finish piece themselves if could well then should reconsider dietary choices  Second all if ever baklava before then would know shouldn't taste licking cinnamon's butt hole  Excuse language but much cinnamon sugar piece baklava hubby both almost chocked first only bite    My recommendation place needs serious revision menu  should stick Greek Mediterranean theme learn those dishes change menu completely  Also if looking more authentic taste Mediterranean cuisine might want try Stephanos' Baladie Cafe my favorite   <EOR> The first time visited market grill cafe hole wall location centennial hills  happy they've upgraded beautiful clean precious neighborhood Greek restaurant now!!! choose sit down served order fresh fast food go love that!!! servers staff all super sweet  favorite dishes Lentil soup falafel gyro platter babaganoush tabouleh Greek salads hummus  Almost everything served plenty warm pita!!!

Trying new dish Mamma Mia's Chicken  Olive oil brushed chicken grilled w fig preserve goat cheese topped wi crushed pistachios sundried tomatoes! <EOR> I just finished lunch think may new Greek place to  wanted try place while but never chance  Luckily today remedied problem    The cafe itself cutely decorated homey feeling  menu quite diverse seems everything ever heard Greek food  traditional gyro quite pleased  ask yogurt hummus side try both options  Both yummy don't think could decide which better option both great!  daughter cheesy pita ate almost whole thing  big deal because she usually eats bite done  think another point place    I also felt very welcomed well  staff friendly helpful  manager stopped table several times check well chat bit  really feels neighborhood joint  place! check when minute  <EOR> I can't believe lived near Market Grille 4 years never stopped bite until 3 years moved other side valley  Shame me  But did other day when group office made drive 95 lunch  must say impressed  restaurant small cafe name would suggest  But decorated well  feels almost somebody's backyard garden  Greek music playing adds atmosphere   For lunch ordered traditional gyro Greek salad  gyro stuffed full meat lettuce tomato cucumber onion all topped yogurt dill sauce  delicious filling  All stuff fell mixed well salad which much same stuff  But also fetta cheese olives  can't love that  good solid meal  price fair given portions  No complaints department  can't really complain much anything honestly  Sevice good too  Friendly quick way should be  bothers pay bottle water when most places free water cups but whatever  going hate them over that   I hope chance come back again future  Maybe own without coworkers  booth gets awful crowded 4 fat a$$ dudes crammed it  I'd more comfortable dining solo  <EOR> Great place food great nice portion value really appeciate your busines  Food great very clean huge menu  <EOR> There time when really liked place least location anyway  But changed last visit  Word wise doesn't pay Frequent Diner Card holder least where lunch specials concerned   I ordered off lunch specials menu done past when total came remembered Frequent Diner Card  pulled noticed all 10 punches yay free lunch well give take $1 some change remaining balance  cashier called manager over squared away  manager came over few seconds examination she notified couldn't use $10 off card because ordering off lunch specials menu which she mumbled something being already discounted needed use entree instead  think gave death look instead immediately questioning ridiculousness she just stated which NOWHERE WRITTEN LUNCH SPECIALS MENU NOR FINE PRINT FREQUENT DINER CARD grabbed useless card manager paid meal  complete douchebag all  lunch time lines long hungry sure people behind hungry there     Yet more thought more irritated became  re read card just sure didn't miss something  only thing think would apply Management reserves all rights part  Perhaps reservation being able use card even toward discounted lunch specials wasn't paying more lunch special  Then thinking last time came into place ordered off lunch specials menu the10th punch card  card clearly states puch every $10 purchase even ordering those discounted lunch specials drink tax comes little over $10  what's policy again using card toward lunch specials? Oh right  don't really they??  I wanted say something manager denied $10 off but she nowhere found done meal back work  decided visit website which wealth information if looking book them next event  Unfortunately no comments section just card fill catering purposes  But interestingly enough found lunch specials listed website $7 50 supposed include beverage  Why location Lake Mead $7 50 does include beverage? always charged drink  basically discounted lunch special $7 50 plus $2 25 drink plus tax came $11 08 lunch  able use $10 off card would've paid remaining balance left cashier nice fat tip which would've elicited bell ringing followed hearty OPA! kitchen always done whenever visited  But point doubtful ever return least location    I must add quality food also gone downhill  When first started coming really liked Greek salad  But noticed during last couple visits salad completely bland very few vegetables olives feta lettuce always wilted if week old   They're overcharging discounted specials supposed include drinks honoring frequent diner card food mediocre fast food best   damn shame  <EOR> Great lunch menu! $9 selection gyro wrap kabob 1 side drink  Serving huge food tasty  packed around peak lunch hour time sure come little earlier later grab seat    I spinach wrap French fries tasty  Definitely fill unless your starving almost away sharing wrap friend  say though French fries way much seasoning making super salty  If your sensitive salt I'd recommend telling them easy seasoning omit all together  <EOR> Healthy but overated over priced   The quality good but way over priced  last health conscious son    I tried both salads entrees  just don't seem complete satisfying unless order extras   priced if paying atmosphere but reality Panera Bread but Grape Vine Wallpaper    It's good place something quick heatlhy  don't reccomend date unless you're high school  <EOR> Everything made fresh onsite awesomely surly Greek kitchen studs mutter OPA! phoned in enthusiasm whenever someone puts tip jar  But don't care surly those motherfuckers  some BOMB ASS food!
