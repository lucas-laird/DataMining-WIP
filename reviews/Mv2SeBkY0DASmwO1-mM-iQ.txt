Burger King next door isn't going you   But Classic Cobb will   fresh chicken bacon avocado tomatoes mixed greens   pretty big too   Honestly think best bet low carb C Terminal  <EOR> Las Mkt trick if need something satisfy your hunger before flight  husband stopped before flight quick bite    The menu pretty simple lunch dinner  several varieties flatbreads sandwiches salads  breakfast also few sandwich options  location mixed couple other food spots food court style setting  tables area all restaurants  didn't problem snagging table    We both ordered flatbreads  weren't anything write home but good enough  crust crispy amount topping right  did take five minutes flatbreads  isn't Burger King don't expect ready time pay  Pricing flatbreads wasn't more less typical airport food  <EOR> Short line long wait bland food  wanted quick bite before morning flight ordered Southwest egg tblt wrap am sorry report bland  Absolutely no flavor despite advertising having avocado Chipotle ranch dressing pepper jack  put almost no sauce avocado mostly just tasted eggs  doesn't help man making sandwich seemed annoyed  price worth it  better served going Starbucks which next place purchasing wrap there  <EOR> Yuck! say MAJOR disappointment  Dry bread just all around poor sandwich  Should gone Jersey Mike's  <EOR> Landed needed some food but fast food walked around decided joint  build your own sandwich only $9 99 which isn't bad when other places selling sell them higher price same but less food pre made  also some sandwich combos pre set should building much  <EOR> I walked trying better decision because Burger King directly next door     The girl behind register new honestly shouldn't even because she no idea ring anything up   other girl making sandwiches helping but wasn't really giving clear direction   So ordered sandwich side potato salad come find potato salad so      fine but then when told take off     because she no idea ring anything she couldn't then girl helping back never came back out  So standing awkwardly she doesn't any idea do  asked did slide credit card yet? she said no  just took credit card back left   I then Great American bagel company received quick prompt service sandwich made just ordered delicious  <EOR> Awful service forgot toast put cranberry sauce gobbler  Needs new staff those ladies no clue  <EOR> Keep walking!!! Horrible service can't tell if food real? Unable use knife cut large sandwich  Interesting Jas Mkt remains business?  Twenty feet away good bbq  <EOR> This above expectations! flatbread pizza portabello arugula toppings! 7 minute wait freshness! $10 50 service nice  Tables clean! more expect airport food court  hour kill food perfect pass time! <EOR> This review nothing price  focus solely service food   The people behind counter seem super unhappy  kinda bizarre don't really ever see place where 100% employees case 2 manager all equally fully hate life  would give negative stars if could  Rude crap attitudes    The food average  horrible great  3 5  gobbler turkey cranberry aioli served warm probably wouldn't order ot again without change recipe  Also classic cobb good  All all never return negative vibe enough keep away   <EOR> Five people standing around line people waiting served  can't type slow service airport  <EOR> It's airport option know expensive less ideally fresh  options laid deli cases looking sad but accurate   Be warned going through oven takes time but construction sandwiches etc  takes way longer should given number people working Subway style lay ingredients    Burnt bread lots sauce not necessarily great thing very little portobello sandwich choice  $11 least hoping better offering Burger King next door   Service wasn't surly  mixed greens sandwich ample current enough completely fall apart heat mushroom toasted prior oven run through soft throughout otherwise would gone 1 star  <EOR> This great option stop once twice month when travel Las Vegas business    The only complaints don't serve breakfast items all day employee morning always cranky  thought she hated but watching actions over last few visits tell she cranky all customers  try every time extremely polite friendly  try smile but all she does scowl  also noticed week visit all employees wear name tags except lady    The steak egg burrito delicious worth dealing Ms  Cranky  <EOR> Las Mkt definitely stands among Burger King other fast food options around it  offers flatbreads sandwiches salads some brunch items  smell fresh made bacon draws across food court    But few issues hold back being airport food option seek out   1 clear where stand line order  huge problem but boyfriend walked back forth end counter other convinced going wrong way  boyfriend called Las Mkt Mambo  He thinks he's clever  For record line end opposite registers   And weren't only people doing this  couple people asked where line ends angry man front berated cashier confusion  Some Order  Pay signs would work wonders   2 speaking cashier he also line cook prep cook  pretty much every role along line  He working hard seemed few other employees working hard  Yet took while orders placed  bottleneck people waiting food registers    My bf standing behind line but probably 7 10 minutes between when ordered received food when he finally asked he wanted    If you're hurry flight check see line moving first   3 price   airport  Food isn't necessarily economical    But Gobbler sandwich turkey cranberry aioli stuffing gravy costed $10  does come sides chips fruit though happy see healthy options offered  pretty standard sandwiched between two slices average sized bakery style sourdough    Again drawn bacon didn't really notice prices until pay   me  But now forewarned    When finally received sandwich which served hot pretty good  liked mix stuffing sweetness aioli  definitely fast food hamburger    But Las Mkt could eatery search when you're awaiting flight LAS   most frustrating part  potential could realized just few tweaks  <EOR> One best sandwiches ever tasted  The steakhouse blue sandwich AMAZING  probably could little warmer but almost want buy second right now   The staff could've little warmer well but don't know much hold against them   Would definitely eat again forgot much liked place! When compare most airport food spots CLEAR WINNER  <EOR> I would give less 1 star if could  30 bucks 2 sandwiches drinks  Price would fine but both sandwiches even decent  Bread ice cold chewy very chewy  Chicken very poor well  wife's ham cheese just no tomatoes lettuce  Menu said spicy mustard out  Nite self anyone finds themselves Las Vegas airport should avoid place  bag chips store would better least would edible  worst places ever tried eat at  <EOR>
