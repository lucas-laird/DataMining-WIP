I disappointed meal yesterday Galanga Thai Eatery try find some better Thai food today   Prommares closed Sundays took chance new Thai restaurant am glad did!  Thai restaurant actually focuses making people happy   haven't service since stopped eating Thai Grill!  food authentic good too!  waitress gave own fan even!  Anyway really counts food   ordered Thai iced tea which wasn't sweet most places but good still   also ordered duck curry sweet sticky rice mango desert     At $14 initially thought duck curry tad pricey but when dish served quickly realized portion curry quite generous particularly duck department   completely surprised tender duck was   never duck Thai place tender!  Yummy!  yellow curry soupy just unique perhaps less bold prefer taste   ordered medium spice level wasn't spicy enough but always remedied Thai food   Overall very good dish     The mango sweet sticky rice good to   waitress made sure knew mango wasn't ripe going sour no complaints here    indeed sour but sweet sticky rice quite nice     I no clue why place only two reviews   am tempted give five stars but can't yet say Essence Thai par old Thai Grill Prommares   definitely coming back try some other dishes though! <EOR> This place well lit white lights looked fun outside friend decided stop whim driving by   spacious inside saw lots Thai people eating felt may relatively authentic   menu diverse some nice options    My friend ordered roasted duck rice which came skin yum cilantro green onions 2 dipping sauces a gooey soyish chili paste    flavor duck rice delicious   Stop Light Curry choice green red yellow meat I asked tofu listed menu yum! green curry   Mine green red bell peppers baby Thai eggplant basil leaves tofu   7 10 spicy scale deliciously spicy I love food eyes water nose run! came small cup steamed rice but waiter gave second because needed sop spicy curry sauce   Thai iced tea icing the   curry total bill 2 delicious dishes 2 drinks $22 steal   back even though really near where live!  plenty menu try am thinking pad kee mao next! <EOR> Essence Thai pretty decent Thai food despite fact Crap Rangoon imitation crap listed appetizer   I brought coworker while Las Vegas business trip   He never Thai food first experience he opened menu spotted Crap Rangoon straightaway   That made some barely controlled guffawing   Nice   food wanted introduce to?  Moving shared some chicken satay   very good mild bite great yellow curry flavor   ordered panang curry coworker ordered beef stir fry sort thing   He reported good no signs crap   The panang curry nice   ordered 5 10 spiciness scale since never eaten before   would more 7 8 if hot   dish very good   shrimp tender juicy sproingy overdone sometimes happens   I also Thai iced tea which yummy although strongly flavored most Thai restaurants version   Overall would dine Essence Thai again   Skip crap though  <EOR>
