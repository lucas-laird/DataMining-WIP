Went today left  Grouchy owner pushy waitress   going unless wish treated badly  Almost bothering them show up  Only day when Larry sushi guy don't waste your time money  <EOR> We ordered take sushi other night   only did short roll when back requested full order server became upset us   When she finally ordered forgotten roll server sushi chef began speaking another language looking laughing loudly   guess something them messing order funny?  sushi tempura sub par   never back place again  why pay treated amusing joke?  Guess  why only customers place   hard only outstanding order right?  Utter disappointment  <EOR> My son lunch last Friday June 7  He eat all sushi before sleeping night he vomitted once all throughout night probably vomitted 8 more times finally ended ending emergency room Summerlin Hosp early morning Saturday food poisoning explained ER physician  Some sushi son ordered did look fresh told but he said its taste ok but does 15yo know what's fresh not  should tasted before allowing consume sushi  thought could caused incident w only put finger sushi   Not coming back again  <EOR> Eh finally tried sushi joint close home Richie H  check sushi joint sheer adventurism help support  locally owned businesses    The decor pretty minimal star dining room being sushi bar located right side room    The service wasn't bad didn't encounter any unpleasant service anything that  fact very attentive wanted sure comfortable during dinner  extra * that!   However food could use bit more help  While fish OK portion could use little help  bit smaller side while being pretty thin  rice could way better sushi rice needs little more grainy side eater being able feel each grain separate your mouth  Well case! Kinda sweet rice being little mushy side  know kinda nit picking but if think especially Vegas aka  middle desert almost all restaurants same fish monger fresh fish  Rice thing  going separate good bad  Also did weird thing scallops actually minced spicy tuna roll meat getting scallop nigri sushi question  Maybe cost saving move?      Maybe check again but knows  Until then if happen SW don't feel driving very far some sushi then may compromise    Bon Appetite  <EOR> I love place!  Sushi amazing service great   Also very clean   Inaka Sushi definitely sushi craving crusher   only reason didn't give 5 stars because don't tempura ice cream  <EOR> Great place  only sushi joints fresh uni  Every time husband eaten its quiet slow immediate attention interaction especially sitting bar  Great happy hour too  All eat free beer sake sounds good <EOR> Ate multiple times price great food! Friendly service awesome happy hour  Would recommend friends family  <EOR> I little nervous place given other reviews but skipping previously trying 808 sushi which disappointing thought would give try   ordered couple rolls pleasantly surprised food   thought all tasted very good which awesome since place very close home   Everything seemed really fresh   Granted only couple rolls but would encourage try yourself   personally don't think other reviews give justice  <EOR> There many all eat sushi places town somewhere service fails  rolls but whatever all same rolls wherever go rolls bunch different goop slathered all over them different combinations dumb   The guy works waiter owner whatever personality mackerel! The staff other location near Rhodes Ranch terrible personalities  say thank when leaving entering  When feel am intruding time  place called Sushi Koma Flamingo Durango   I just drive next time     it's farther but least those people appreciate your business  No more Inaka girl   and all people take  worth it  environment well food  literally left last time did something bad  <EOR> Inaka best Sushi spots town   Inaka roll amazing fish always fresh   True service isnt greatest but overlook because food awesome  <EOR> I chose Take Box Beef shrimp sushi vegetables tempura California rolls ginger salad miso soup  flavors great food looked  Customer service outstanding  first visit lunch visit dinner  Both occasions staff service excellent  Meal portions more adequate  regular stop us    plan try delivery soon  <EOR> Me wife AYCE expected ok  first bite into yellowtail nigiri worst ever tasted  main part sushi rice very mushy yet hard meaning undercooked then left long time making edges each rice hard  Let alone texture flavor awful  fish thin fresh  only hour AYCE couldnt hang  torture waitress chinese snob  mess sushi bad?
