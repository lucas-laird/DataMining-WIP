Then dad's noodle soup comes fairly large bowl side note EAT lot noodle soups    first thing he does bowl noodle soup he SMELLS odd isn't it?  But all honesty  tell if good aroma fragrance  ratio noodle soup ingredients way off noodles 35% ingredients 4% rest soup   noodle soup restaurant advertised $3 99 but dad upgraded $4 99   suppose reasonably priced such crappy bowl noodles   Next pork chop dishes  meats dyed red extremely paper thin   brother's plate 2 pork chop pieces each size man's wallet    pretty small   Now plate originally came fried egg 2 pork chops no pork skin   When ordered plate dad specifically told owner baked egg she said ok but extra which fine but now still send back baked egg pork skin   She took pork chop off plate added small scoop pork skin gave back   HECK that? Then asked come fried egg she said don't that   Then mom granny tried house special   chicken also dyed red  Why? don't freakin' know  also 4 fried triangles something plate  granny ate she found hair refer picture   Now keep mind posted outside restaurant A rating health department   This strand hair any encased fried coating  unsanitary sight  Then started notice un mopped stained floors unsanitary practices cleaning tables serving foods same unwashed hands  Even potties didn't toilet paper seat covers paper towels     At point edge seat squirm  son comes over asks if wanted check even though asked many times  He hands over bill nearly $40 4 gross dishes  hand hairy fried substance tell loud clear gross loud clear tables behind hear lol   He turns around eww reaction  found funny  Anyway he deducts $10 that   If restaurant owner's son whoever let ask eat crappy food too?

When Vegas again going back place  <EOR> I appalled service actually made Yelp account share experience   My family mood pho first place came across  curious why no customers all but assumed 9pm Saturday night Labor Day weekend everyone Las Vegas strip   I'll admit all happy when picked menus took look prices  $3 99 small bowl $4 99 big bowl? pho lover's dream come true!  I uncomfortable feeling when waittress came take order  mom asked big small bowl instead giving straight answer waittress just said Small bowl babies big bowl adults  asked repeatedly describe bowl but she just repeated us Small bowl babies big bowl adults  Since she didn't give straight answer all ordered big bowl   My sister wasn't hungry when waittress asked order she just said okay going eat  Well reality if she hungry willing share her  waittress responded saying want appetizer? sister repeated No hungry  Again waittress tried again appetizer lot  even share your family  being harrassed few more times finally raised voice No she's hungry  She doesn't want anything  more try waittress finally gave turned orders   When pho shocked size bowl  would say adult sized bowl little bigger regular bowl is  mad fact waittress somewhat lied us  sister eventually ordered small bowl haha bowl size expecting large bowl be regular bowl  believe woman tried cheat extra dollar per bowl  other pho restaurants upgrade bowl regular large usually $0 50  I'm really complaining though $4 99 large bowl extremely cheap  The pho okay  can't really remember much because ate almost week ago can't recall much  remember saying myself better pho but worst ever had   When finished pho left over pho wanted take out asked sister pay bill take out box  sister approached cashier here's convo Sister Hi would pay food take out pho [points table] Waittress Okay [looks receipt] which would take out?

And if your dining establishment service oriented no should even *think* asking refill bill  waiter would bring check periodically see if needed anything   But    hell  figured play  I pushed button refill   I pushed again   Damn     think plasic thingie broken because see waiter other side restaurant slurping own bowl noodles   I wave hand general direction  even consider snapping But instead cash register asked refill asked bill  waiter overheard immediately said he'd bring us   Sigh   The hostess shining star  She petite Asian woman TON makeup gold lame leggings glitzy shirt  waiting say love long time  Frankly think she might management owner  bad employees aren't snazzy interesting  Too bad food wasn't very good   The other positive experience super cheap    restaurant seemed relatively clean  I'd only come again see hostess because she such character  <EOR> I've few times   food decent cheap well   gone sporadically during two years Vegas 4 99 large bowl pho good value if looking it   Although cut short green leafy mints leaves come side   The service pretty good compared other Pho places because don't much traffic although due location business     If going north towards spring mountain easy access   However if going south away spring mountain may very difficult left turn due traffic opposite way because no stop light during heavy congestion may take awhile due lack courtesy Las Vegas drivers   If looking value bang buck I'd recommend place although if price doesn't matter other places better food  <EOR> This restaurant terrible taste foods awful serve lack utensils worst drinks comes styro foam cup   never recommend restaurant all  <EOR> For $4 pop mediocre tasting pho can't really complain  paid $10 pho doesn't even taste pho  least delicious powders use almost taste real thing extra boost MSG forget a extra dinginess restaurant the dirtier pho place better pho b soup just devoured made special powders side meat thrown in   The only qualm place open late nor 24 7 because pho would taste SPECTACULAR if trying sober up   Should your way it? No wouldn't think but if just happen Decatur going south Spring Mountain might well pop because hey only $4  <EOR> I really Pho place   think food good price isn't bad   Pho addict place because cost HALF other places charging   Also pot stickers spring rolls things if want     I've noticed service so so when busy but keep eye you   Try it! <EOR> They don't care cause youre just tourist them  place nerve add tip themselves onto bill  Count your bill dispute them its right  place no good  food wasn't good  customer service wasn't good either    Don't support business  <EOR> I love place three reasons 1  first time tried order small bowl pho lady told large small girls  2  large bowl pho turned $5 20 tax   Cheapest pho town consistently pretty good boot   3  half dozen times eaten there's never more other party restaurant     I keep coming back place because feels underdog Vietnamese restaurants Las Vegas  don't know manage survive because place always seems barely anybody but here's hoping keep up  <EOR> I thought place looked good outside  love hole wall restraurants but place sucks    It really cheep but pay get   the broth pho wasnt bad but maybe because just water powder think      I think place probably used much better then economy crashed just stopped caring food   service wasn't good food wasnt good  bleh  hate leave bad ratings but gotta one  <EOR> I admit haven't patronized many Vietnamese restaurants but comparable ones which been   prices reasonable servings large   admit Saturday night rather empty but rest Vegas time   service really good if bit over eager order   I'd come back again  <EOR>
