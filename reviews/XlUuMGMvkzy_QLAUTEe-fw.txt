All ordered juicy soup beef dumplings side rice  soup dumplings ok bit sour could definitely more hot  kind cold once hit mouth   It worth trying but don't think back  <EOR> Yes 5 friggin' stars   I love place!  Dumpling King hidden gem every sense  Nearly every time huge supposed lit sign front off broken place nearly looks deserted besides car two parking lot  probably doesn't help if you're heading West Spring Mountain almost impossible see being tucked behind large plaza building  Plus don't see advertisements them anywhere whatever reason amount reviews place crazy low  people just don't there   but why? good!  Our first trip Dumpling King admittedly little nerve wrecking  Besides having clue where really having never heard all strange walking into place pretty much empty other diners but full bright floral designs   and Christmas decorations  Yup Christmas decorations  Which now July still subtle spots across restaurant  But really all part charm now  decor decorations all place always clean   The menu large plenty things choose from  Some things can't even read  Luckily couple times regulars pointed right direction order  pretty sure barely even put dent list items but now handful times some things confidently recommend   For smaller items start while you're deciding eat order String Beans  large plate fresh beans dried peppers tons flavor likely hit anyone working tastebuds  course name would imply excellent dumplings  tried couple different types but always seem back Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings  Even 6 year old can't enough things  little vinegar and or chili paste just sets them off even more  pack much flavor juice into those little things beyond me  But if want some idea watch them being hand made little room right kitchen   also where other favorites Vegetable Fried Noodles  Thick handmade noodles served perfectly cooked piled high veggies    There's probably enough room character limit everything but larger main course type stuff some must try dishes Fried Lamb w Cumin new found item added favorites list Black Pepper Beef  Both dishes packed tons flavor fresh perfectly cooked meat  piled high plenty sharing   I've also number items likely wouldn't ordered myself due sheer skepticism but ended really liking  which Teppan Tofu mainly because don't normally tofu anywhere  But just pretty much everything else menu packed flavor comes huge portion  other thing really enjoyed but probably wouldn't ordered Baked Yoked Coated Pumpkin  Don't wrong pumpkin but just doesn't ring it  Flavorwise though doesn't disappoint  almost dessert french fry even more because there's no way eat just one   When comes food really hasn't single thing Dumpling King haven't liked  if any negatives place whatsoever hit miss service  Usually biggest issue getting refills here  whatever reason take time getting water  also weird little interaction last visit which 4th time where main waitress I think owner asked if needed forks  mean   c'mon know white boy but you've seen before   I know use some dang chop sticks lady  Well sort of  Good enough eat least    Overall DK easily if favorite restaurant area  Every time come food excellent large groups split tons food really isn't expensive  said   hidden gem check out! <EOR> I'm surprised place doesn't more reviews! many dumpling joints served soup aka juicy dumplings place BEST ever had  most soup seen dumpling ever!! green onion pancakes also very fluffy serving generous  third time would definitely return!!  They great take well  Very friendly offering water tea while wait your order! <EOR> For being self proclaimed dumpling king would expected way more dumplings   juicy beef dumplings no pork option   Salty meat thicker skin prefer   string beans money though   Perfectly cooked seasoned   onion pancake but did them much because bready greasy flaky am used to   Everything freshly cooked order     The whole time played Calvin Harris Blame repeat   worst part  <EOR> After eating brunch some friends thought would good soup dumpling eating challenge   so found place thought would good try out  When going place pretty empty only 2 other tables  ordered 4 servings soup dumplings  soup dumplings beef ones which am accustomed to  mediocre best     What irks took awhile 3 orders come out   and then 10 minutes later last order   asked spoons help eat dumplings kinda hard eat just chopsticks    the spoons never came ourselves  contemplating ordering more dumplings but main lady didn't seem care much taking order   so just asked check and took awhile    Overall  the dumplings 3 5   but lack service   drops 2    <EOR> I just back another delicious meal Dumpling King fathom restaurant some negative reviews did   live New York am used good quality Chinese food   son's friend recommended Dumpling King decided give try  am always leery trying new places but am glad did  start finish food delicious  Fresh tasty hot kitchen reasonably priced  couldn't ask more  owner Merry lovely speaks English beautifully if any questions she more happy answer them  Some dishes enjoyed potstickers beef dumplings brisket sweet sour beef fried noodles chicken  bill all food four people $60 lots bring home! decor festive bright  If expecting Panda Express then wrong place  If looking good high quality meal then Dumpling King  won't sorry  <EOR> Food = 2 stars   We ordered several dumplings steamed fried  fillings all seemed come soup dumplings  Their Korean cold noodle fav  more flavor all dumpling dishes    Lamb dumpling tasted very game y stinky  Lamb hard perfect granted but dish hard swallow    Service similar typical Asian restaurant nothing really bad say if don't expect much    Decor very flashy bright red prints chair covers red paper lanterns covering ceiling lights  <EOR> I am fan hand pulled noodles!  Hubby wanted some soup dumplings decided yesterday try DK lunch today   arrived notice Christmas décor up   Wondered if DK celebrated Christmas all year round just super excited Christmas already put decorations   restaurant's chairs all covered red flowered fabric   Lots red everywhere   Hurts eyes bit   Chairs uncomfortable   Onto food Beef Soup Dumplings thought ok   definitely better  Couldn't really taste soup medium sized dumplings   pass next time  Teppan Tofu ask some steam rice eat this   sauce very flavorful   tofu soft inside somewhat crispy outside   thought above mediocre  Shrimp Fried Noodle hand pulled noodle best hand pulled cooked noodle tasted date   texture chewiness perfect   shrimps perfectly cooked well   share overcooked shrimp kill dish   DK!

I hoping really good dumpling since called dumpling king but XLB weird sour taste it    Maybe  style? But didn't enjoy tried lot XLB elsewhere   Beef noodle soup nothing specially edible meh   Cumin lamb really good! Without dish maybe would've given 2 star   We left over first 2 dishes wasn't really worth bringing home  <EOR> The main entrées tasty   tried lamb dish which very good   duck ok   Nothing fancy but just delicious because duck   dumpling wraps tasted homemade but dumpling fillings just ok   taro dessert which told entree probably highlight meal   Prices higher I'd pay portions ok except white rice   only filled bowl half way but charged $2   something cheap sure why would stingy rice portions   Service typical lack luster Chinese restaurants delicious food   Overall back unless undeniable craving eat authentic Chinese food  slightly over priced  <EOR> taste very good!! must try!! good! traditional Chinese foods  those people Chinese foods must try! <EOR> I came Christmas vacation  ordered bunch dishes can't pronounce Chinese   dishes stuck stone dumplings soup dumplings lamb!

The decorations red flowers seen pictures  private rooms party size large   Must order lamb dumplings!! can't wrong it!  Parking bit limited but some back   Local mom pop resturant! support local restaurants! <EOR> I came take recently upon entering restaurant eyes burst bright floral patterned seat covers  bit eyesore  rest restaurant cutely arranged round tables red Chinese lanterns lining ceilings  playing old school Christmas songs which cheery mood whilst waiting   I ordered soup dumplings fried string beans  hoping them big portions amount paid which $20 two dishes    So verdict The dumplings ok hardened soon started cool down  green beans seasoned nicely good portion but down side greasy were    I'm willing give place another shot didn't really love had  <EOR> Next stop soup dumpling journey Dumpling King Lots mixed reviews but came determined see myself  very pleased!  Once walked bombarded sight super bright red floral chairs  only other table immediately greeted seated table   seems smallest tables 4 tops which isn't bad but sitting own almost tempted order enough food fill all space P   After eyes recovered chair assault took glance menu find Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings  took few minutes since layout bit weird  Protip menu items skip numbers because pictured items removed list    Anyway soup dumplings good! seen some reviews saying some all dumplings came broken but guess lucky all mine intact! Filling well broth flavorful nice amount ginger   new place these!  I ordered some green onion pancake just dumplings weren't lonely  Standard good soy sauce chili oil paste   Food came complementary pot tea    Woohoo! far good soup dumpling hunt  eager see if find better Vegas but happy come back until happens   read place almost good Din Tai Fung which highly recommended me  feel there's trip L A  new near future <EOR> Great food great staff  Low key casual restaurant great authentic foods!

Steamed beef dumplings Pretty disappointing restaurant named them  dumplings did give juicy flavorful experience expected when bit into them   Shrimp fried rice If closed eyes taken bite may thought eating just plain white rice carrots peas  Give MSG want Chinese food more flavor  shrimp even more bland rice   Both $9 portion wise enough 2 people  should ordered more  <EOR> The soup dumpling delicious cumin beef string beans delicious! try hot pots next time   looked delicious table next us  <EOR> Best Xiaolongbao Las Vegas! Very fresh hot  Made front frozen  <EOR> Food great but service could better   The waitress bit slow  approached something waiting forever when remind she totally forgot seem never heard request!! asked dish thought ordered she said its its way then later waiting another 30min she said she would check find actually never ordered it!!  Anyways really shumai cystal dumplings    I really want try squirrel whole fish but dont stock whole fish  Owner kind enough give card told next time before come call she would shop fresh fish     <EOR> Went last night whim  ordered must try section   say when its hot pretty good nothing rave about  Little pricey  But when food becomes cold really gets soggy oily  best pan fried potstickers $9 99  Good best value think  <EOR> A friend town telling all great dumpling places he going lately  excited found place  Wife really mood dumplings  hoping place going really good  mediocre  Nobody when arrived 6 pm Saturday  good sign but time left place full  lucky guess  read yelp reviews before going  Decorations hideous described  boy working very good but he polite  Obviously family business  ordered simmering beef noodle soup steamed beef soup dumplings pan fried crystal beef dumplings  soup pretty good  noodles seemed fresh made  However dumplings nothing special  steamed dumplings over salted fell apart easily  crystal dumplings reminded frozen  Most menu dumplings  Seems place Chinese restaurant dumplings menu place specialized dumplings  would back if someone suggested but would pick it  <EOR> First time spot   figured would try some dumplings out     Decor expected   felt slapped huge Chinese floral pattern upon entering     Ordered beef stew noodle not bad   China Mama better      Since dumpling king   you would figure dumplings would amaze balls but wrong! Mediocre best   and plenty dumplings compare to   ordered shrimp chive ones blah      Overall worth try definitely worth coming again   perhaps if better dumplings!! <EOR> Loved it!  Dumplings Dumplings Dumplings   Unfortunately can't review much else because all Dumplings   Very authentic always wall wall nationals sometimes even trouble ordering if know mandarin   Food great every dumpling think personal favorite stone pan dumplings    Its bit away strip but worth drive sure! I'll back! <EOR> My first impression decor restaurant its red floral chairs acquired taste   Service slow if rush place go   I pan fried dumplings beef noodle soup   food okay nothing would write more about  <EOR> Review strongly based SERVICE time only  Upon walking seated immediately cool   sat down waitress tended table next quickly seating before asking drink order  Eventually    water hot tea  When asked specialties famous plates waitress some difficulty communicating  Limited English totally fine! However waitress informed mom ONLY beef dumplings available  party entered immediately received water hot tea  opted ONLY beef dumplings available hot sour soup another protein dish  dumplings served cold white plate all other tables around served typical steam container  Odd right? waiting 20mins some damn hot sour soup it wasn't very busy decided pay leave only eating 7 sadly served dumplings    After speaking manager owner? she nice cordial gladly informed several other options dumplings  Umm what? She the beef dumplings probably only quick serve dumpling readily made  All other ones need made might taken while  Bottomline provided sorry excuses nonavailability food  didn't sense party served dumplings proper tray well following parties them 2 groups     It's hard really comment taste dumplings when service effects your entire experience  parents culinary 25+ years know when service sketchy explainable busy ness hassle ness    To end review manager told its best come holiday better service  Oh  great know  <EOR> My boyfriend decided finally check place weekend being being Yelp bookmarks awhile  certainly disappointed!  We shared beef soup dumplings beef dim sum dumplings  Both great but personally liked dim sum better  came better big portions ten each  total whole meal under $30 which think steal   I also loved hot tea complementary  Very good service overall great place  back soon try more! <EOR> This place great   If you're just visiting Vegas you're looking some authentic northeastern Chinese food definitely place worth checking out  still relatively new but food tasted amazing authentic   Also staff very friendly   ordered beef dumplings even hand made Chinese yellow wasabi request   Definitely coming back again when town  <EOR> I came fix kind food grown accustomed to  never seen lamb dumplings before but now good  Also Lamb cumin  Both of would order again minute  Overall would say lamb well  did see any pork dishes sure going that  Try place it  almost empty when came here  <EOR> We warmly greeted seated server  asking recommendations but server couldn't understand English   She called owner could speak English but helpful recommending anything good    Maybe because she busy having dinner herself  asked hot tea given pot hot water   The juicy beef soup dumpling really good  steamed duck little tough dry though   Our bill came $30 left feeling hungry still  <EOR> The greatest chinese food ever eaten  Awesome spice never chinese food dumplings actually taste really good  first  <EOR> Their name does place justice! specialize Northern Chinese cuisine rather just dumplings  really excited discover Northern Chinese restaurant even happier now good already planning second visit!

But first impression is   place smells  very pungent bathroom odor  wouldn't mind if smelled cleaning supplies   but smelly bathroom sewage scent way when you're eating! But asian restaurant  Things slip through cracks all time  stayed  eventually used it   The menu lot items! Most English descriptions pretty vague  pictures help lot  lost all choices took awhile order   When did ordered pan fried beef patties soup dumplings hot sour soup    The patties good  Crispy flavorful tasted great little bit vinegar hot sauce   The hot sour soup savory other places but tasty well  Full flavor jusy enough sour    The soup dumplings normally take longer last arrive table  Tip normally if know you're ordering dish should put order first  dumplings good  personal preference dumplings more sweet salty but salty  Also actually much soup each one    The menu other delicious sounding items we'll probably back try other items  But need fix smell!!  Overall   626 dumplings beats NY dumplings beats China Mama beats Dumpling King <EOR> Food decent no complaints served   Muslim owned business no pork menu which somewhat limiting place dumpling name place   decor bit off putting but clean  <EOR> Walked during closing time around 10 40 but closed 10  lady very kindly still serve hours  felt bad knowing stayed eat Becuase apparently said Yelp close 12  Anyways service alright but food alright  ordered beef soup dumpling which everyone keeps talking isn't all that  Also ordered crispy beef shrimp fried rice which tasty but taste MSG pretty heavy  wish give place more stars just instead lady just telling closed instead rushing order     like okay? <EOR> You know XLB while vacation     Unfortunately XLB just ok  problem them?

Especially if succulent wrappers used encase dumpling fillings hand made dumplings assemble cook order  major comfort food category me  fact ?? boiled dumplings first item ever personally ordered own lunch money mom gave elementary school Taipei  just few pennies each shop made delivered plastic bag school name just time lunch break   don't remember much tasted but memory having tremendous emotional satisfaction joy simple meal still very strong   So while driving try new ramen place few miles down street light new restaurant caught eye decided quick but very safe u turn into small parking lot front Dumpling King   plenty spaces back building case restaurant gets super popular coming weeks  initially afraid dropping restaurant close since fairly empty inside but looking hours operation relieved see 1 25 hours left   I made quick scan restaurant pretty much blinded all red color restaurant   Red floral printed seat covers over each chair   tablecloth reddish color lighting fairly dim yeah slightly disoriented color red   wonder if normal reaction just those minor details made just little different other 6 odd billion people planet not including aliens left zigzag lights over skies Hawaii    Anyway picking nearby table good lighting taking food pictures going over menu eventually found dumpling section all way last page under Main Food ordered following 101  Beef Steamed Dumplings 4 ???? Decent flavor but felt texture filling off  overground overworked   102  Beef Dumplings 4 ???? Same filling above except dumpling boiled   103  Lamb Dumplings 4 ???? Good dumpling nice lamb flavor  Dumpling also boiled looks exactly Beef Dumpling   112  Stone Dumplings ???? big plate full pot stickers cooked pan inverted onto plate  residual starchy water forms thin crust connects all dumplings together see picture    kind cool looking but eat fast   Because taking time take pictures all food came more less same time noticed small pool oil puddle plate 10 minutes which made taste good very first piece had   Just something think if dining solo eat very slowly   NOTE Although menu prices listed dumplings portions 4 told misprint now minimum order 8 dumplings now need order those items x2   But Beef Lamb Dumplings comes 8 pieces $5 bad price wise but does present additional hurdle against trying much menu possible without asking doggie bag   did however let order four pieces each Beef Dumplings Lamb Dumplings total eight pieces since both cooked same way   Overall thought food A OK family operated restaurant Mom son both works front dad likely kitchen cooking    closest Chinese dumpling restaurant where live now stopping near future   Plus asked see if also Xiao Long Bao given calling themselves Dumpling King serve many dumpling specialties same region told just added menu day   Would nice offer such information when reading menu time placing orders but oh well  Just another reason back  Maybe later dinner   Credit cards accepted but when gave them AmEx card AmEx sticker along usual suspects front door but asked pay different card because American Express charges higher fee perhaps but more likely due AmEx distributing funds merchant clients entire billing cycle   Yeah pretty much all small vendors hating AmEx think if old enough once dominated credit card market  Oh mighty fallen indeed     3 5 stars   am sure another update forth coming should try XLB next visit   Review #26 2014 <EOR> They good food except its hard take orders when no speaks english usually  Thats only reason low stars  <EOR>
