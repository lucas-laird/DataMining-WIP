  Now never pizza rating flip side menu  Lasanga pretty good but Spaghetti lacking  Jumbo Stuffed Shells decent burgers good  Philly Cheese OK  Salads good especially Antipasta delicious Basalmic Vinagarette  appetizers poor taste frozen then fried  Kind pricey  Decent portions  average dinner nothing special  <EOR> Over past few years pizza joint   Angelina's isn't far place located decent strip mall where Albertson's resides   would usually place order hit Albertson's sides drinks then grab grub Angelina's   Very convenient!!!  But something happened stopped coming while   Maybe because wanted try something new   But last weekend wanting burger   always liked burger offering Angelina's provides   usually Double Bacon Cheeseburger side fries   Filling tasty   decided come back order one   experience trip I call order Double Bacon Cheeseburger trek Angelina's     *Side Note trip would faster if would open road between Vegas Valley Sahara   would take few miles off trip   Anyhow Angelina's counter pay order   told would couple minutes before ready   No problem don't mind waiting   few minutes comes order   put plastic bag filled napkins ketchup packets   Nice!!!  I home ready chow down burger   look this    forgot bacon   What???? total love affair bacon   mean order side bacon bacon   little disappointed but barely   burger seasoned nicely tomatoes fresh lettuce crispy   also toasted bun   nice touch   could used little more fries but whatever   say decent job but took off couple stars forgetting bacon   But back!!!  My tip more pizza! Sandwiches burgers wings! If ever into Angelina's Charleston pick menu   extensive lot offer  <EOR> TOTAL NIGHTMARE order 7pm received food 9pm called pizzeria assistant manager  told grub hub fault top typed notes very specific wanted ranch dressing didn't deliver pizza cold   $21 00 + 2 hours waiting + cold incomplete order = Angelina's pizza NEVER AGAIN  We throw pizza away call NAPOLI should never trust food low quality restaurant Angelina's NEVER AGAIN  Sincerely José Almodóvar 7029295817 <EOR> Kept giving place chance past 4 years only game around hot minute but never should given 2nd chance   Pizza consistently soggy when well bake requested  Really wish worth it  vending machine though  <EOR> It just okay   wings ordered cooked perfectly but wasn't enough sauce  found myself adding own special hot sauce them keep them moist dry  pizza   I'm pizza let start saying that  eaten enough teenager though know good pie just wasn't especially price $16 medium?   dough soggy when picked slice all toppings slid off  wasn't impressed but willing give them another shot maybe during day time  If coupons definitely use them  <EOR> I'm finally putting feelings down writing finally being disappointed to say least particular locations' standards last time   Frankly sure where start  order delivery them fairly often usually order same thing myself Philly Cheesesteak fries  usually sub par best but sacrifice quality convenience  Burnt meat soggy flavorless fries missing ingredients norm  Never again  Recently gone way below sub par disgusting  handful times now fries tasted dish water meat sandy sort grit it  Still never wrote any reviews stopped bringing back because admittedly pessimistic opinion reporting dissatisfaction restaurant does absolutely nothing improve things shown past when few times did call Angelinas inform them forgot parts order met horrible attitudes just felt extremely uncomfortable somehow wrong    Why did continue order food? Because convenient used great guess just wanted give them chance or numerous chances stuff together  Also idiot apparently   Another point I'd add if eat food significantly better  Doesn't taste off doesn't show signs staff just giving damn probably because you're right complain it  tells question someone just being bad cook but take advantage being able skimp screw over take orders because people like myself usually won't take trip bring back lieu just putting bad food throwing away   just take though   I'm gonna wrap summary today's order  Gritty meat dishwater fries few bites felt giant hard chunk squeaked when bit into similar glass hard plastic  instantly felt nauseous stomach contracted run toilet where vomited forcefully traces blood it excuse gory details   irate point  sure if later personally speak manager may irrelevant point never ever order food again won't much could repair situation  Very sad say Angelinas permanently removed list regular eating spots  used fantastic  <EOR> The pizza ok greatest but some flavor it  sure prices little over priced quality  <EOR> We ordered delivery chicken Alfredo pizza ranch chicken wrap  took over hour when delivery time supposed within 45 minutes  pizza pretty good although cold but wrap inedible  Cold dry tasted old  Even partner eat almost anything couldn't stomach it  Overall IF order them again won't trust anything else but pizza which sucks because many things menu sound delicious  <EOR> Found place near pops house spending extended period time Vegas  Large selection menu great local hangout <EOR> Angelina's great big menu  ordered wings pizza sub food awesome <EOR> I called @ 12 56 place takeout order put hold 5 minutes then cashier tells actually cashing already    Says close @ 2am  <EOR>
