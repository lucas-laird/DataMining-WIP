Anyway Las Vegas Casino Cafe's pretty much glorified Denny's  food always just good enough pricing fair  However service really really SUCKED big time  mean took literally forever anything everything  Probably 10 minutes before someone took drink order another 10 minutes before drinks  Another 10 minutes before took food order another 20 minutes before actually food   on top forgot half drinks remind some them 3 times bring certain drinks forgot  Oh but bill came real fast hmm    Yeah never again   go Carnegie Deli short walk away guarantee much better food service   No wonder damn place empty  G <EOR> I think may worst hotel cafe Vegas   only insanely overpriced something expecting happen quality actually below Denny's   only reason kill some time while boys gambled   food delivered quickly which nice but nothing satisfying it  Which really saying lot since 6 am entire night    <EOR> Conveniently located right below hotel elevators Mirage Caribe Cafe available all hours  food bit expensive is  all regular Americana dishes typically crave Hamburgers cheesesteaks salads etc  The decor bit nicer regular Cafes  service decent but nothing ordinary  dishes range between 15 25 dollars depending order  said most Las Vegas restaurants base price service experience  typical any diner food good but great  Now Vegas cheap place general but 8 15 dollars would made more sense  didn't see any specials menu most Vegas eateries    Overall decent  But hey if you're hotel guest you're somewhat buzzed drunk just long night something close room just more sense  But if you're staying different property there's plenty Cafes inside casinos more reasonable price  <EOR> I tried much but tried good   breakfast   coffee I whole pot myself too! cinnamon French toast   really wanted some fruit but menu listed marinated strawberries which would seem some sort syrupy strawberry thing   Regardless wanted strawberries ordered them French toast   When French toast served actually side fresh sliced strawberries bananas which anywhere menu but precisely wanted French toast   unseen cook somehow read mind   really mess but happened work me   French toast good served little pitcher maple syrup bowl butter   I thought decent selection breakfast options several sounded really good service good   line when arrived but seemed away very quickly   Again am sure non breakfast items but would return breakfast quite happily  <EOR> So last DAY before catch noon flight LAS ass 2 30am hair up   Drais hasn't seen last me!  Hungry dancing 6 hours straight Wet girls CHEESE BURGER   Weird place such terrible reviews  glad found something open decent eat    We ordered fresh jicama mandarin salad which surprise reallllly good  expecting something yucky given hour but again its Vegas good!  15 minutes later huge juicy cheeseburger swiss sauteed mushrooms arrives all its glory    3 bites full  felt such sinner wasting 2 perfectly good burgers my friend only took few bites guess happens when deprive yourself normal eating schedule    Oh well  least next time know where grab burger salad any hour nice hotel  <EOR> Every year Las Vegas always breakfast here  THey don't big selection but sure big proportions  1 lack selection 2 lack original specialties  It may little pricey but otherwise good  How cheap expect restaurant luxurious hotel be? <EOR> as good 24 hr cafe be  Always late night fix whatever order cant wrong  Cant exactly remember ordered last year but its good old skool comfort fatty fried foods  <EOR> It early morning 3am  stayed Mirage didn't want far into cafe  price reasonable    HOWEVER worse soup ever life here  ordered bowl French onion soup basic right? when waiter took soup shocked even friends noticed  Dude most surprised expression your face! friend did order again?

Service Overall angry complaining whole time table in which waiter NEVER come back table check complain through whole dinning experience   When back hotel room around 4 5AM morning just dissatisfy disbelieve just share worse soup experience roommates waking them up!   So am WARN fellow Yelpers! <EOR> i've eating Caribe since remember my gparents used live Vegas    dad used take sister felt included Vegas experience since couldn't gamble stand while dad gambled    basically things adults could do    It's changed few times decor menu but always bit soft spot heart   ate very late night early morning meal weekend grilled cheese cole slaw    think grilled cheese could tasted better mess but cole slaw great   friend's chicken fingers great other friends omelette almost tasteless according her   good time    I've many times most part lives high expectations    Service isn't always greatest prices seem sky rocket each time come back    $12 grilled cheese?  hungry   what say? <EOR> Horrible  If can't even basics right chicken noodle soup French onion soup which huge blob cheese top slice bread soaking between both way salty what's point opening restaurant? I'd rather Denny's  <EOR> Reason Breakfast    and didn't want head outside haha   Bueno Good prices some pretty good food  corned beef hash little much onion taste but mom's Belgian waffle rockin' sister's poached eggs    No Bueno Service spotty slow   they're some lazy ones  <EOR> Wow   Why restaurant Mirage?  ate breakfast fiancee highly regret it   waited line 30 minutes service even slower   Once seated took 15 minutes drink orders   Once drinks took another 15 minutes food orders   both ordered complete breakfasts tasted horrible  eggs soggy potatoes mushy ham steak disgusting  Don't started prices   cost $6 50 glass orange juice! Horrible   just plain horrible   ended paying food similar paid room service   By all means eat here   service slow waiters very very rude  unacceptable especially Mirage   yourself favor walk across street McDonald's   Trust me  <EOR> Good food fancy Cafe   Surprised bad reviews   good menu  Service excellent  Portions big   ethnic foods menu to   waitress asked if want bill room tab which first 5am  Very attentive  Kind fancy looking outside prices kind steep but its strip its mirage imperial palace worth it  <EOR> Fine sandwiches fries   wouldn't anything else there   isn't gourmet glorified Denny's   But quick portions huge hamburger just fine  <EOR> After checking Mirage needed some food asap!! took luggage into rooms came down elevator saw Caribe Cafe right away!  took look touch scroll menu huge plasma front cafe found perfect quick bite  seated ordered d coke  ice tea buffalo wings raspberry jicama babygreen salad patty melt!  Service quick accomodating dad needed directions restroom wash hands said would just bring some wet naps cloths which nice since bathroom outside cafe   wings very buffalowy tasty however little cold tasted old if reheated once twice bleh   patty melt yummy super greasy but else patty melt supposed be?  Plus fries yummy except occasionallly BEYOND crispy ones   salad yum jicama raspberry orange slices nice dressing   bill ended around $40 which decent amount quick bite!  Would come again if mirage but wouldnt way here <EOR> This place ok  Decided since staying Mirage  convenient  thought would fast eat cafe but man service took forever  all starving food took more half hour us    I ahi poke ahi sandwhich  ahi poke ok nothing Roy's  sandwhich better but superb  bit disappointed  <EOR> This restaurant now closed replaced Carnegie Delicatessen  ' <EOR> I thought 'City Never Sleeps '  Crap!  guess actually New York but gives?  12 30am want some damn dinner! only place Mirage could find still slinging it   fact think only open 11pm 6am service knows only game town well casino anyway don't particularly care they're rather slow     Anyway Vegas am keeping some random hours end eating twice   Both times strawberry Belgian waffles   say pretty good decently priced   coffee good too kept going anyway <EOR>
