Another red flag something wrong when Friday night almost no business  We invited wait bar but did want drink until sat down  at which point bartender asked if thought good bar  customer don't appreciate being questioned why want don't want drink  Upon sitting down asked if wanted sparkling flat water  and wanted flat or rather TAP water realizing buying ourselves bottles water  Later waiter sounded irritated when asked tap water although he did give us  We never offered drinks dessert  Luckily time dessert all wanted there  The wait staff never really checked aside time refilled water  when did come over made some snide comment people group  Wait staff incredibly rude  guess first waiter's shift must ended middle meal he just disappeared  understand he leave but most good restaurants waiter least let know leaving someone else wiil taking care you  only realized when end different waiter brought check  We checked frequently  or really all  as other establishments  Customer service obviously forte here  could take cue bartenders casino floor bar downstairs  At casino bar wonderful  and fun!  bartenders  The prices exorbitant  understand certain fine dining restaurants expect pay significantly more   however $23 shrimp appetizer? only serves person according waiter  would needed purchase 5 appetizers or $115 appetizers enough appetizer everyone table  Maybe wrong but waiter told us  dined many fine restaurants all over world yet feel ripped off restaurant  Needless say skipped appetizers  and prices heck McDonald's prices service severely lacking  hope point getting across  and most people pointed very loud  liked music but pretty much killed any dinner conversation  Screaming across dinner table no fun  the food actually good but given everything else going difficult focus that  enjoyed perciatelli $23 which maybe touch salty but overall tasty pancetta  The kicker gave straight 15% tip because poor service  no extras there  honestly deserved no tip but principle group didn't think right  Imagine shock when friend charged meal checked online statement found ADDED extra 5% tip  totaling approximately 20% gratuity  despite she written tip signed receipt  She complaining credit card company today additional charge reversed    Bottom line Stay far far away  Food decent but given complete lack service high prices much better experience other restaurants  Hopefully Rio management wises realized restaurant needs more customer friendly needs replaced  Hope helps  <EOR> I'm surprised some bad reviews site! ambiance great  Service wonderful    even no reservation      Bucatini Alamtraciana' good any while Rome  pricing bit high but no worse other nice restaurants dined while Vegas Dinner 2 wine shared appetizer $120   <EOR> It definitely any other dining experience cause felt nightclub all loud music flat screens but where ended   3 other people weren't any type budget dinner review primarily service quality   We same time large group but nonetheless no excuse entrees take over hour receive   appetizers came timely manner very delicious the meatballs live rep pizza probably best ever had but main courses different story   waiting over 30 minutes seeing smaller parties ordered receive food before more displeased   spoke waiter he explained large group higher priority I think just forgot order    Our entire dining experience took nearly 4 hours because displeasure offered take few drinks off bill   money wasn't problem service   waiter hardly ever checked constantly ask other staff when questions   The only good thing say place played some Biggie Smalls speakers Soprano's TVs  <EOR> Was part large group Saturday food very good wine very good but place really loud    Very Trendy restaurant but thankfully food lived hype  <EOR> Martorano's good came back back nights during last stay Vegas  Ask Sergio Jason the best waiter bartender!  Believe hype! need order MEATBALLS Martorano's salad! Please beg you  If you're Vegas reading jealous because you're much closer heaven your mouth me  salad magnificently acidic meatball perfection  other item must order FRIED MOZZARELLA because spicy San Marzano tomato sauce absolute crack  addicted! appetizers both nights  light! could fill yourself just meatballs mozzarella you've warned!  I chicken parm first night although delicious couldnt finish  If ate quarter I'd say lot  second night penne alla vodka although delicious also couldnt finish  You'd think learned lesson  highly recommend chicken parm  doesnt come pasta but note massive chicken cutlet    Beautiful news order bowl sunday gravy soak all your food before into your food coma  must order bowl when order your food  If order halfway through your meal may take time before bowl heaven gets your table  <EOR> Got VIP soft opening last night everything hoped!! Also took kids but 6 30 noise wasn't problem through dinner happy dance when tunes started crank  food really impressive  and eat good places lot!! Fresh EVERYTHING cooked perfection nothing cold even slightly overdone flavors wonderful! Kids heaven! All sauces completely individual no note bases presentations creative without being weird  Also wine glass selection special perfectly paired menu  beautiful Brunello hadn't seen since Italy! Knocked outta park Cuz!! <EOR> I read many negative reviews almost cancelled but glad didn't  family 5 enjoyed good Italian food reasonable price  calamari appetizer good flavor  server attentive but over bearing  saw people complain lack substitutions part restaurant simply true  more compromise except 3 course fixed price menu which more understandable   wife ceasar salad which light but still sardine flavor  would expect  Although children's menu appetizer pizza more enough 9 13 year old share   If choose aware probably quietest restaurant strip  If don't already total rewards casino card may want stop downstairs pick offer 10% discount most items card  Overall food good price lower end Las Vegas  <EOR> I cafe martarano dinner tonight terrible We waited long food   spaghetti meatball which bland noodles weren't cooked all way still crunchy  also chicken Alfredo dish tasted salty plain  service good overpriced  coming back better food olive garden  <EOR> First off let say place delicious  Italian fare Vegas place right place go  eaten some best Vegas well such Nove  restaurant should judged few main categories  Food Service Ambiance Uniqueness   The reviews movie clips playing just dumb  First all don't bring your little kids place this  If want them eat somewhere nice then bring them chain Chicago Grill McCormick any other run mill fancy place bring kids to  movie clips part places character think awesome quite honest  cult classic Italian restaurant little bit punch face it  going if want some delicious Italian place usual boring run mill fancy Italian place where go   It seems people reviewing place poorly no character themselves enjoy being bored  somewhere boring if something different your idea fun  <EOR> Disappointing say least  second time left wanting back  service decent but food price really surprising good kind  started off calamari chili sauce which think photo yelp dish  calamari fresh tender but because breaded then drenched TON sauce left mushy overwhelming couldn't even finish it  Why cover much sauce completely ruin entirety dish? Usually would find place serves old frozen calamari which doesn't seem case just don't it  would much more enjoyable drizzle little side sauce spoon onto your dish    Next entree ordered veal parm which decent but nothing spectacular  side spaghetti remarkable must say some best spaghetti ever but everything else quite lack luster mundane  something would willing drop another $200 bucks on  Again value money while Vegas think many places touristy spots don't need count repeat business don't really care if gouge people because someone else checking into Rio where place located next day  <EOR> We great time here!!!

Again don't know much any dishes cost didn't pay any them let alone look menu   All wait staff knew Derek personally apparently he dined often quick serve everything could possibly need   Derek just said Bring all good stuff magic happened table   Three different kinds pasta little steak something random meatball thingies don't even know else   Here's thing   don't Italian food   generally find heavy   another thing   Derek himself Italian heritage   When Derek first sat down he said Look NEVER eat Italian because nothing compares grandma's cooking  But place good  Did believe him?  No  thought some weird promo he pulling which unlike    But no  first few bites TOTALLY SOLD   Everything scrumptious tasty definitely heavy   Goldilocks once said eating Baby Bear's soup JUUUUUUST right The appetizers entrees desserts ALL amazing   But piece de resistance place DECOR AMBIANCE   Holy cow!  At first confused when lighting changed violet blue   eyes playing tricks me?  busy savoring meal care if going blind   Then blue light changed red   the???   when realized lighting room continuously changes color dissolving slowly color next!  adds totally colorful fun element whole modern decor jeebus movies!  Okay classics enthusiast general but really cool music lighting interrupted periodically short showing classic scenes classic movies Godfather whatnot!  Totally cool unexpected touch!  DJ played good if loud music staff totally friendly enthusiastic!  The best part?  kitchen see where magic happens   Derek introduced chef he looks incredibly Vin Diesel another Las Vegas impersonator? he totally friendly exuberant   Just kind guy!  This place freaking awesome   experience freaking awesome   fact did zero damage gambling funds freaking awesome   When and don't mean IF mean WHEN back no way able afford such varied sampling I think 10 different plates table point all scrumptious goodness but sure try something different every time just fill!

The sausage meatball ok  sausage dry meatball really nothing rave about   pastas under cooked  am sure whether way ordered food but better fast food joint   What things worse atmosphere there  Very Guido! playing TV's Martorano cooking 2 meals which looks something 9 year old cooks  opinion he looks bulky version Mickey Rourke? ? Which adds Guidoness  also adds also showed blasted scenes Godfather Casino where F bombed every other word  made part group devoted church goers very uncomfortable  <EOR> Food good but over priced  4 people paid $180 no alcohol just apetizer some pasta dishes    Service amazing  But reason am giving restuarant 1 star because played SCARFACE while having dinner small chiildren! How upscale restaurant play rated R movie which portrays violence setting which supposed relaxing romantic classic We leave middle meal no time dessert rush through few bites My husband remove children table during killing scenes I addressed manager he didn't seem interested say  DO GIVE RESTUARANT ANY BUSINESS! <EOR>
