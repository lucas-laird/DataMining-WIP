Ichiban safe bet if you're looking meal Fashion Show Mall  <EOR> Tons cheap choices walking distance Venetian Encore Wynn Treasure Island  <EOR> Ein doch recht normaler Food Court mit wenigen Tiefen und einigen Höhen   Am schnellen abräumen der Tische könnte noch etwas gearbeitet werden ansonsten gibt es viele Sitzmöglichkeiten sowohl Hochtischen als auch am normalen  Die Auswahl der Essensmöglichkeiten ist groß und man bekommt von Burger Bis Asia Food eigentlich alles   Preislich bewegt sich alles einem moderaten Rahmen und ist natürlich im Vergleich zu den normalen Restaurants Las Vegas günstig   Mein eindeutiger Favorit ist der Habit Burger Grill! Frische Burger direkt vom Grill auf das Tablett  Besser geht es nicht und schmecken tut es wirklich super gut   Den Foot Court erreicht man entweder direkt durch die Mall oder auch von außen mit der Rolltreppe auf die dritte Ebene    Da man Las Vegas jeder Ecke viele Essensmöglichkeiten findet ist diese natürlich nur eine Weitere mehr aber doch eine gute Alternative wenn man sich dieser Ecke befindet  <EOR> We ate Philadelphia steak hoagie   No taste leave review remember come again  <EOR> Years ago used located bottom floor opposite end now underneath futuristic architectural feature reminds Star Trek know you've seen off freeway kinda weird looking  access outside mall Strip  inside mall just escalators second level near Hot Topic    Chicken Connection pretty good Crazy Crepes looks interesting we'll try sometime Great Wraps pretty good Greek Island Cafe never tried it Haagen Dazs yummy but pricey $8 dazzler Hot Dog Stick the lemonade good uniforms smile Ichiban never tried it Jac Ray never tried it KFC Express parfait anyone? Nathan's Famous supposedly best hot dogs according people back east Panda Express a fast food standard located everywhere Philadelphia Cheese Steak don't remember if tried not Sbarro hate Subway #1 fast food chain US Taco Maker never tried it Wendy's frosty please!   really something every taste here  Chicken Connection Great Wraps best places here  If prefer something else lots restaurants Maggiano's reasonable Italian food heard place really good Ra Sushi you exit mall towards Strip entrance lunch specials mon sat     There lady selling attraction tickets near escalators  bathrooms past Crazy Crepes place  ample seating food court probably best thing food court really  tables chairs then areas tall counter seating stools well  shouldn't hard find free table here  All areas pretty clean  <EOR> I pizza honest tasted same nasty pizza food court home  don't even understand WHY ate here  many good eating places Vegas why mall food court? only saving grace crepe crazy crepes but dirty tables just ruined effect  going eat again  <EOR> With all money just spent Diesel Louis Vuitton your going eat dinner  Burgers hot dogs  Its pretty place  seems if doesn't belong sort high end establishment  Could imagine many fast food places cluttering Forum Shops Ceasers Palace? Its noisy tables probably haven't sponged down while  guess could drop off kids while spend some serious cash    place meant for? <EOR> Jac Ray tuna cervice salad fraud!! canned tuna! nothing cervice it  hate when places mis advertise food   If restaurant would sent back   Oh yeah took 20 minutes them give pre boxed salad   I'm only giving place 2 stars cuz 1  salad still good 2  its cheap its going Vegas  <EOR> Si vous en avez assez de l'ambiance électrique du strip et que vous cherchez un endroit un peu plus calme ou déjeuner c'est l'endroit qu'il vous faut    Ce food court est d'autant plus interéssant qu'on y trouve vraiment de tout donc si vous êtes à plusieurs pas besoin de vous mettre d'accord sur une spécialité tout le monde peut y trouver son compte ! <EOR> Stayed Trump Hotel across street ate breakfast several days row   Good specials food court prices rather over paying same eggs bacon toast anywhere else   Nice clean very friendly workers every counter encountered! <EOR> Got fan just because something almost everybody    Wife hit Subway before noon decided try breakfast sandwiches  Until now did even know Subway made breakfast sandwiches    I bit nervous when saw sandwich builder is special name person? pull pre cooked egg looked more crepe not sure expecting but dressing bacon cheese quick trip through microwave then toss some veggies actually pretty decent    The foot long fed both can't really complain  <EOR> AVOID Philadelphia Cheese Steak!!!  **DANGER DANGER**  much better food airport place   Keep mind Vegas best cities find good food eat   Did really travel all way eat mall food?  coming city then going McDonalds KFC In Out   Why?  places where live?  After doing some shopping friend wanted come eat quick bite but very hesitant   I decided try Philly Cheese Streak guy working grill 5 16 14 @ 635pm very disgruntled   No greeting because he busy pre frying bell peppers he put them bin   He asks want   give order   Then he comes cash register asks again want   Don't ask people want while frying bell peppers   Only task time   cannot multi task   Just look idiot   Look sign says try Fries way made Philly   ordered cheese steak mushrooms added combo med drink fries     To surprise he took bag frozen fries freezer poured fryer   FRIES WAY PHILLY?  Then he took couple slices frozen wafer meat another freezer put stove thaw   Then sliced looks meat really Philly Steak   You very little meat   Come frozen does rent mall cost much?  fries MEH could done better job home   I wasted $14 because couldn't eat he made   Fries gets 1 star Philly Cheese Steak gets 1 star Coke styrofoam cup gets 2 stars  Disgruntled attitude = PRICELESS <EOR> Monday dark morning reviewing food courts  Sexy   Everytime almost exclusively hit Chicken Place  Kinda sad don't even know full name damn kiosk considering if somehow brought little Ziploc baggie you know kind used hold your marijuana when little kid hung all toothpicks would accumulate hey you! stfu sample this! *waves nubby fleshy thing face* action would wicked jungle dwelling Vietcong Barbie   Can't really nitpick food court though malls whole required County provide feeding troughs Sheepish shoppers  almost automatic now     Stomach *rumble* complete useless bastard Me Almost     there     one more flight escalatory overtones Stomach Remember your Yelp event tonight?

It's just A OK since nothing particularly interesting but Hot Dog Stick Crepes  <EOR> I wanted last thicker cheesier slice cheese pizza @sbarro but girl ignored gave teenagers instead   sbarro pizza isn't great anyway     HA!!!  But showed them when did pizza quickly ran over cashier paid first!!!  ********************* KFC Express need serve fried chicken strips wings sandwiches need leg thigh!!! <EOR> The food court doesn't seem belongs higher end mall  seems bit place  even away everything separate 3rd floor  rather large regards overall space  There's many seats though nearly great selection eateries  Unlike other food courts selection horrible    The more known usual suspects which could choose are Wendy's Subway Panda Express Nathan's Hot Dogs Haagen Dazs   Lesser known Villa Italian Kitchen Taco Maker Suki Hana Philadelphia Steak Hoagie Great Wraps India Masala Crazy Crepes Chicken Connection   I'm merely only reviewing food court actual FOOD locations   completely separate review    Overall though food court separate level rest mall  There's ample seating decent cleanliness when compared other food establishments  However  say could use some work  passable standards but maybe others  Maybe little more effort could towards wiping down tables cleaning table suraces bit more  Also emptying trash cans just sweeping just bit more would bump cleanliness score    From food court level outside actually nice view Wynn Palazzo   kind plus    Minus 1 star cleanliness Minus 1 star lack solid food choices Minus 1 star overall dismal feel place  probably won't back patronize estabishment here  <EOR> Some solid places eat but take your food go  Almost many homeless people food court customers  asked money food 3 people first 10 minutes sitting down  guy sat across watched eat whole time  He asked money two times then decided pull lets then geel bad stunt  Very uncomfortable environment employees just walk happens  back anytime soon work very close food court  <EOR> I agree its typical mall food court  ate Subway Chinese Gourmet Express  prices definitely cheaper Venetian hotel bf stayed at  Subway always tasted same Chinese food similar Panda express  Only chow mein more yellowy side  Very quick food service  busier saturday sunday lunch  <EOR>
