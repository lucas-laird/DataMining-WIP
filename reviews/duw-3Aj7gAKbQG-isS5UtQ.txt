Everything sandwiches desserts etc  delicious  <EOR> I really wanted place   Easy reservations Open Table when called update reservations later time super polite accommodating especially considering reservation group 8 which wound actually being 7    First food really right?  menu looks great unfortunately some dishes don't deliver   Although did salad first course others group weren't lucky   person's scallops over cooked rubbery caprese salad salty couldn't eaten   More mixed reviews main dishes   short ribs hit people liked oxtail ravioli but skin sea bass soggy instead nice crunchy texture someone undercooked chicken sent back   The worst part evening?  service   waiter came twice roughly hour first give menus then take orders   Even though took 90 minutes dinners he never came back ask if wanted more drinks say coming etc   only 4 other parties restaurant!  When finally complained manager no apology simply head nod   Truly disappointing   apology only came awkwardly during THIRD conversation manager raw chicken sent back   Then came dinner chocolates brought 6  group 7  possibly worst service ever experienced   real negative mark Four Season's luxury brand     Because leave things positive note drinks great bread basket  <EOR> Pas mal comme restaurant pour déjeuner à Las Vegas  La qualité est là mais c'est beaucoup trop cher pour déjeuner  Le weekend il y le brunch de disponible avec beaucoup de choix  C'est surtout beau comme endroit pour déjeuner surtout dehors sur la terrasse  Mais 40$ pour le brunch ce n'est certainement pas une aubaine  <EOR> The most salient feature Verandah partakes entire Four Seasons Las Vegas oasis atmosphere enjoyed during recent stay q v  million miles casinos showplace and not so showplace restaurants while being corridor away   Restaurant thoroughly kid friendly while second compromising adults' menu choices also Four Seasons standard   We breakfast each day consistent enjoyable including both la carte menu buffet   Highlights buffet day ate include salmon crab omelet bar donut bar!

Sigh  track record speaks itself undoubtedly return again  But say changes occurred Four Seasons recently mostly behind scenes management stuff am all encouraged future  <EOR> I would give 4 stars but sure husband would give 5 stars few times now really liked lunch there   haven't breakfast though   always love atmosphere Verandah food always good! dinner though hope something great because some reason haven't anything really liked   But still love Four Seasons!!!! <EOR> Brunch sunny Saturday Vegas?

Both Nutella cupcake Panna cotta amateur  cake part cupcake tasted worse store bought mix Nutella buttercream frosting lacking any type bold flavor  cherries even good felt manager just threw together dessert without thinking through    When bill came noticed charged chicken salad  told waiter should charged item didn't eat  manager comes back says ate half salad said tried salad realized par  He ended comping meal sub par experience   I hope see improvement remodel done because restaurant needs refreshed professionally detailed    I appreciated manager comping meal bringing few desserts  However lack attention detail Verandah Four Seasons Las Vegas cracked be  <EOR> We late dinner last night lovely time here  style dim ambiance restaurant felt very elegant comfortable  Service courteous everything ordered delicious  started off beef tartare which incredible  signature pasta served beautifully jar four cheese pizza also did disappoint  dessert panna cotta trio loved each individual flavor  am looking forward coming back again trying brunch menu happy hour specials!

<EOR> Review 2012 Restaurant Week   Verandah located Four Seasons Hotel remember first visit hotel confused heck where park valet did park large lot south entrance walk roadway in     Verandah dimly lit nice cozy atmosphere   numerous tables private rooms booths   But sat against window wall where couldn't really see outside because getting dark   But see private pool surrounded green forestry would probably nice sit dine   service good server attentive but restaurant wasn't busy yet food runner knocked socks off   lost all pictures phone relying blurry dishes opposite foodie buddy Angela T's uploaded photos since came restaurant week     On paper menu looked outstanding worthy $50 12 price marked   compared other items offered other places same mark thought Verandah played conservative such high level culinary technique   drink ordered didn't impress but server did replace it     The best food runner ever because he Hawaiian came complimentary appetizer   soup spoon sides great   first course came mine Angela's   tasted risotto because love risotto ahh maybe cooked little bit longer needed   think argula better tasting greens flower even better but fresh   first course scallop jumbo shrimp can't remember third item but placed top nice sauce topped delicious flavor foam   spoon sweet fruit taste which completely refreshed palette   runner told eaten direction other   second course caught attention brought here   dish plain   monkfish itself prepared perfectly though really no hating but really no way loving also   ordered other dessert just could split try others dessert both ended being ordinary well   two three courses just plain appetizer great though   There some great skills used when preparing Restaurant Week courses appreciate participation otherwise would never come dinner   Culinary skills mix flavor outshined bland main course complimentary appetizer appreciated well food runner top every ingredient knowledge into  each dish created   thought he chef way he explained each item he delivered us  <EOR> Lunch today fabulous  The shrimp tacos world Service fantastic We amazing experience  Definitely going day Xmas tradition  <EOR> First brought bread   bread good however cold warm which minus   second thing ordered butternut squash soup which incredible highly recommend  Next mahi mahi fish tacos mango salsa top made them very good   only disappointment side slaw salad which virtually no taste finally add salt find if any flavor not <EOR> My husband easy more casual for most Vegas anyway dinner before going see Lion King  busy but nice quiet  waiter fantastic very personable attentive  Menu small which prefer rather poring over many choices  mozzarella caprese appetizer perfectly simple  Cloud Gnocci dinner which name indicates light very tasty  wouldn't recommend if looking heavy big dish but loved it  apple tart dessert which beautiful tasty  Didn't love goat cheese crumble but didn't overwhelm tart  didn't actually any pie crust which missed  definitely return! <EOR> Had fantastic lunch pool  able Seafood Mac 'n Cheese even though lunch  Service excellent food great  Would definitely come again  service little slow  <EOR> I took mom $100 for two taxes tip afternoon tea early Christmas present she absolutely adored it! lot fun but pained hand over credit card  isn't something I'd often but if into tea parties should try least once    The tea service setup fun but sad waiters wearing white gloves anything kind per person price should've playing scene Downton Abbey semi casual  lots older socialite types well few couples  opt add glass champage just straight tea    The tea menu good but sad two teas of course wanted!

I thought pumpkin pancakes ok  The carrot juice VERY delicious!  In regards service    When asked straw waiter told use daughter's used straw all bitten up! Seriously?!   I definitely won't coming back  honestly would complaining if service great  <EOR> Brunched trip group soon well all landed Vegas ourselves checked respective rooms hotels pretty good I'm vegetarian  reviewing  Grilled Portobello Parmesan which if portobello without breading egg free egg allergy  decent grilled portobello mushroom veggie patty but nothing write home about  also couldn't resist getting side truffle parmesan fries which normally come burger and amounted $8 worth fries quite nice if particularly truffle y really truffle little sad  companions menagerie items 7 total including Chicken Waffles Traditional Corned Beef Pastrami Hash Skillet Chicken Angel Hair Pasta Tuna Sampler  Everyone seemed pretty satisfied food buffet looked pretty good except probably could only eaten two things course made no sense that   companion bloody mary well seemed pleased that   The service lovely  waiter great looking things making suggestions group members fence have  don't think there's anything menu would vegan but if you're vegan pretty sure your waiter could work something kitchen you  would nice see vegetarian section including vegan sub section and or some markers common allergens dairy nuts but otherwise lovely experience   Overall tasty if pricey meal but if brunching area again I'd certainly willing return <EOR> The Verandah Four Season's version hotel cafe  serves breakfast lunch dinner daily  eaten breakfast  breakfast menu offers simple American favorites pancakes French toast waffles hash plus couple ethnic dishes such huevos rancheros  Lunch gets little more ambitious dinner time menu switches Italian theme   **The Atmosphere Colors mostly range browns lots wood  Seating available both indoors outdoors while sat indoors outdoor seating looked very nice  Overall atmosphere pleasant relaxed   Service friendly efficient  can't describe very well but good feeling restaurant  Everything just worked smoothly   **The Meal I chose often recommend dish corned beef pastrami hash two eggs crisp potatoes  started layer finely shredded potatoes actually more thin spaghetti shreds fried crisp  Next thick layer hash  Lastly two eggs any style chose scrambled   The hash consisted thick layer finely minced corned beef pastrami  delicious somehow managed finish gargantuan portion  crunchy potatoes shreds excellent foil smooth hash although challenge onto fork  only disappointing item eggs  overly firm lacking character  However  minor quibble  would recommend dish anyone   I also ordered latte  came small biscuit cross between pistachio biscotti shortbread  Slightly sweet good foil coffee   **Summary After only meal ready place Verandah list top breakfast spots  Its menu doesn't appeal much top choice Bouchon overall feel place also isn't quite inviting but combination excellent food good service pleasing atmosphere winner   **The Bill The meal $21 plus tax tip  <EOR> Four Seasons beautiful property starts  Service experience every area expected above top notch  I requested seated poolside patio  Which promptly  being seated took between 5 7 minutes greeted someone  timeframe did notice multiple servers look direction but come acknowledge us   When greeted seemed server enthused new guests dining  ordered drinks food all once since unwillingly given time so  Waters took awhile speaking bus person kindest interaction had  believe name Jose very polite genuine  The coke raspberry tea ordered took some time but kept filled  arrived positive note  Bread service arrived 2 minutes before entrees made way  Disappointing because wasn't anything special  Just stale white loaf hard side plain butter  My tomato soup quite good  rest entrees subpar  hard time believing real Wagyu beef used burger bun nothing special  Caesar Salad dressing nice however chicken added bland seemed freshly prepared   I understand restaurants strip unionized food servers  But sometimes maybe comfortable forget provide positive experience  <EOR> I made reservations High Tea today  highly impressed Jonathan took reservation  genuine customer service level exemplary should noted  previously tried reservations other establishments would accommodate single person  case Veranda  welcoming Jonathan explained tea menu showed location within restaurant  successful tea all atmosphere  guys set tone great experience  highly recommend establishment  <EOR> This review weekend brunch  First all could possibly most family friendly restaurant strip  Children coloring book souvenir cup even play cartoons if need keep children still    The brunch $39 Four Seasons restaurant its very reasonable  Children $16  Most items come individual serving dishes highlight donut maker customize your taste    Highlights items include rustic cut corned beef hash skillet red quinoa cereal chicken apple sausage applewood smoked bacon chilaquiles florentine eggs benedict hollandaise mascarpone cheese blintz roasted apple glaze ricotta pancakes  also choose unlimited bloody mary bar    Unlike many Vegas strip buffet take reservations use Open Table guarantee seating because gets busy here  <EOR> We brunch buffet sunday am   It pricey 39 person but expected given location Four Seasons   It did disappoint did walk through confirm worth price   The sheer volume diversity combined attention detail preparation each thing tried impressive   This usual mass produced brunch buffet   Each station individual servings items chilaquiles hash sticky buns bread pudding  well all usual fare breakfast   The omelet scramble bar chef making ordered impressive ingredients all fresh   The normal pastries carb section interesting addition homemade hot doughnut bar   Great quality quantity price   Would highly recommend if don't mind spending money appreciate quality ingredients  If just want some red some yellow some orange your 10 dollar brunch better look elsewhere  <EOR> Very good food really nice atmosphere  dropped mid week lunch sat outside  waitress Kieu Q friendly happy give some recommendations  Veranda nice lunch menu everything pizza pasta entree salads sandwiches  started glass wine which Kieu poured actual bottle which nice touch    We ordered gorgonzola fries start  chose Charlie Palmer steak sandwich mom other half both Sin City burger  Sin city wagyu burger white cheddar bacon avocado side truffle parmesan fries  steak sandwich NY strip arugula steak fries    The chips house made described being served  gorgonzola fondue   delicious chips needed more cheese  first few chips rest no cheese them    The burgers steak sandwich arrived short time after   steak cooked perfectly bread super fresh  steak fries little thick dry  absolutely loved smaller fries served burgers though  crispy loaded truffle parmesan flavor  Next time ask those instead steak fries    Unfortunately food runner mixed burgers mom other half each others one medium rare   figured few bites flagged down Kieu  She very
