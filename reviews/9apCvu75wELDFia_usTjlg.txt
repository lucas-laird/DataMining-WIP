Horrible horrible horrible service extremely slow keep reminding waitress ordered accept reservations first come first serve everyone standing around don't know they're doing honest rather pay little bit more all you can eat sushi noncasino environment    definitely two thumbs down!!!! <EOR> The service place amazingly friendly attentive  mention Linguine Clams best ever had  pasta always al dente! Plus pour wine generously glass  Prices reasonable perfect date spot before seeing movie Suncoast Theaters  <EOR> The Suncoast's Oyster Bar serves pre shucked oysters  They remove blue plastic bands around each before serving them half shell  two dozen oysters satisfied price paid   $14 99 per dozen didn't expect greatness exactly expected   oysters large plump but none liquor probably due them being pre shucked    don't different kinds oysters would expect oyster bar would   guess good place if craving oysters want place  quick cheap   fun watch most dishes being prepared right front you   bouillabaisse could stronger flavor but tasty nonetheless   If Senor Miguel's next door order Oyster Bar menu too  <EOR> So comp casino decided try Oyster Bar  originally month ago wasn't going review but ended going buffet cafe since then all horrible  surf turf worst ever  friend seafood gumbo didn't even look good  steak seasoned bad shrimp funny taste it  gumbo looked nothing ever seen before even tasted  good thing say server very polite  <EOR> I love Oyster Bar inside Suncoast Casino   I always Shrimp Cocktail Crab Cocktail!  Oyster great but time opted ordered something new   it similar Clam soup but White Wine   very good!!  Prices bad   what expect?? inside casino targeting tourists   LOL!!! <EOR> Questions  Is bread best when fragrance yeast rather cardboard?  New England clam chowder supposed cream colored rather gray?  sushi rolls supposed taste more fish cucumber? sushi rice supposed flavored rice wine vinegar?  eel best when tastes eel rather candy?  tuna supposed free sinew threads feel thin dental floss?  If your answer any above yes then somewhere else   Grocery store deli sushi canned chowder better   Seriously         and while it    Las Vegas bakers bread?  When bread your response usually Oh it    don't know is  suggestion Buy  Walmart frozen east rolls   Follow directions your patrons roll eyes only whites show bury faces bread basket   Taste better clever are  <EOR> Agreed Mona C  whole good but great oysters cant price but then again cant argue price Just want add clam chowder seriously tasted canned    I ordered sampler mostly everything deep fried would expect place oyster bar find ways enhance flavors seafood just batter fry suckers  Surprisingly rice good    NOT GOOD groups seating VERY limited <EOR> I take pass next time  shrimp crab cakes other oyster dishes  NO sushi! waste time money! <EOR> Sat sushi bar great meal 3 rounds sushi beer sake chaser $39 00 <EOR> Although unassuming name Oyster Bar some solid seafood food general    Sashimi Oysters Everything really fresh  Oysters only things refuse eat but everyone family loved them!
