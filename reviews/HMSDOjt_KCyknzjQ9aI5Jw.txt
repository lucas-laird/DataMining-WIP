Tres Leches Honey Toast Try it! <EOR> In al honestly really wanted place but honest impressed restaurant   I came lunch sisters dad some ramen  read some great reviews place eager try it  service ok wish little more attentive  food biggest concern  personally countless ramen places Vegas but ones would put very bottom list  ordered tontsuku ramen noodles underdone  only but pork no flavor  two good things ramen egg broth  Along appetizers impressive  fries ok best since belly seasoned  Also would recommend soup dumplings since should just called dumplings because no soup inside    All things considered would coming back unless some change methods cooking maybe putting grill gas powered  <EOR> Today birthday given choice anywhere wanted  craving Asian food since birthday didn't feel cooking  toss between place ramen place down street house  decided swing since wanted support owners because also own bowlology    While deciding order asked server sally if could ramen picture  turned stock photo guess little shocked disappointed response  When asked if could ramen similar maybe shoyu ramen response don't think so  Instead saying no sorry     let check that      We ordered dumpling chicken soup chicken skewers shrimp skewers ton ramen 2 boba  dumpling good  Came soup spoons plate  very delicious  believe gyoza dumpling boiled chicken stock  perfect flavor loved it   bf skewers  took bite each tad bit spicy but he loved it  ramen good  Couldn't finish all passed bf finish up    While sitting watching gentleman walking around talking few customers bit told bf boyfriend next time come back must ask server because sorry Sally just wasn't sharpest crayon box  She nice but same time super friendly personable  Lot answers very customer service oriented she seemed flustered maybe she new  Anyway man watching swung table asked liked food  thinking perfect!! Now name could request him  told loved food  name  name Dan  Turned cook  happy sad same time  Happy because many cooks come say hi sure everything good just feel welcome???? many tell you  He's second know of  sad because now can't request server because  he does    We talked bit food stuff that  daughter vegan conversation that  Anyway Dan reason why am giving place five stars  wanted give place less stars  because food because Sally  believe good customer service good food important  most delicious food but if server gives bad feeling then chances won't back    Dan excuses himself Sally comes back  bill hand over debit card  She some kind issues little machine says she needs front  problem  Dan comes back table socialize bit more  Meanwhile sally walking all over place debit card hand  watch walk front side kitchen then back towards front then back again other words kid walking around everywhere cars hand  stop taking Dan asked come back towards us  finally stop waking everywhere asked cars back issue she said she having hard time scanning card  sure if magnetic strip but told just pay cash  made no sense why she just wondering around card hand    Dan nice enough give 10% discount  did leave tip because right thing but all honesty good food Dan saved day  think people need bottle personality enthusiasm share others  People learn lot customer service him   He's only reason why giving 5 stars  If wasn't I'd knock off star because server    Conclusion food great Dan awesome  Hopefully Sally just having off day  come back think should give place try  disappointed <EOR> This update previous request  Before head visited grand opening  happy impressed back  sorry did  First shuffled between people just place order take paid gave nice tip waited  ordered Raman burger which first time ate came really fast  box bag didn't look till home 10 minutes later  feel sad writing but disgusting  bottom tray bunch fluid oil water don't know bun completely soaked gross  far hamburger just browned side because inside totally rare uncooked  sad because wanted same amazing burger but evil twin instead  Don't think back even if right next work  <EOR> Mazemen new favorite  ate girl both loved food  Everything looks fresh clean boba too!
