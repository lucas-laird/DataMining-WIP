But then wasn't good   am happy report yummy again!! tried shrimp mahi taco today awesome!! Definitely recommend! <EOR> Why does Saborr complete opposite side town me? If located any closer I'd probably going least every week    day  Seriously  Support local joint! Tried fish tacos ceviche tostadas  Both pretty great   service very friendly too   As previous reviews stated   Think Chipotle  But no crazy lines more affordable great authentic taste  flavors aren't typical your average Robertos mexican grill   But rather much more homemade   no brainer give place try  <EOR> To keep simple  Saborr your money worths  Great portions cheap prices  Great staff plus military discount  <EOR> The wife noticed place recently decided try noticing no reviews Yelp   It's Mexican cuisine whose format seems loosely based chipotle style ordering  menu limited offering burritos tacos quesadillas  offer ribs didn't try  Something ribs doesn't scream Mexican food me  ordered chorizo bacon breakfast burrito wife selected crane asada tacos which came two sides  burrito didn't bad taste but no texture even bacon very mushy  taco combination presented well looked promising  Unfortunately wasn't greatest crane asada had   pretty tough made eating tacos without destroying entire construction taco very difficult  woman helping very polite answered questions but could done better job explaining format ordering  kind just figure own she watched visibly verbally thrown off setup     Overall wasn't terrible prices aren't bad but hopefully over next couple months work some minor issues  I'd try again some point future <EOR> Very surprised good place menudo birria severed everyday instead just Sundays most restaurants birria excellent   also sell beer micheladas! Food prices cheap might little more expensive Roberto's tacos but well worth   coming back! <EOR> Amazing food amazing service  Super quick service  usually burrito almost everything in   and told worth it  amount food prices great <EOR> Food well seasoned tasteful  However two things found demirtting 1 employees wearing gloves while prepping food 2 employee sweeping dining room while full capacity    lunch rush   Hopefully improve  <EOR> I am giving place 5 stars service kindness genuineness  Why 4 stars? Simply leave room improvement    place cute food tastes wonderful  $10 Yelp deal $20 worth food! great discussion manager sweet hard working  place great but feel could some slight changes even better  Yes just being over critical but said profile honest  <EOR> Average fast Mexican food bland side   Service Chipotle style assembly line which unique small independent Mexican places this   Still thought flavors minimal details throughout experience disappointing     The upside good prices military discount fast service really friendly staff   So exactly am talking about?  Flimsy plastic silverware just unusable   Watery horchata a crime book! Bland refried beans plain chicken uninteresting enchilada sauce   basically don't spice anything even little bit   No salsa bar    mean c'mon salsa bar???  Based strong reviews expecting pretty awesome experience   I'd eat again but wouldn't first choice  <EOR> Took ride way Speedway see Christmas lights   Great little place!  just Mahi fish tacos GREAT!  Super friendly staff   Clean place   Lighted parking lot strip center   Happy hour 3 6pm   couple beers less $5 00   Wish places closer us! <EOR> Best Mexican food!

Thanks looking out    Had 3 asada tacos very juicy great flavor them corn tortilla shells added crema cilantro salsa roja shells little burnt appearance but taste however did fall apart  sides rice tasted great chips which tasted homemade  All all good meal coming back probably going flour tortillas next time though  <EOR> Excellent authentic tacos  Enjoyed option cabbage onions cilantro tacos  Fast service lunch time close Nellis  Wish couple more options meat Al Pastor  <EOR> DELISH!!!  very best food value wonderful     very simple place everyone works very friendly!  son chicken enchiladas chilli releno rice beans both great! <EOR> Today national holiday New Year's being celebrated number places still closed   came Saborr based Yelp reviews looking good breakfast burrito   most often case disappointed taking Yelp recommendations   I ordered scrambled egg bacon chorizo potato burrito   young lady waiting extremely nice helpful adding best extras it   Once she took order turned she also cooking all fresh   All ingredients then place looked tasted home made oversized tortilla grilled slight crisp   She brought table checked if anything else needed   Everything burrito outstanding!
