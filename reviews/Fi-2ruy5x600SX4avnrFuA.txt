During recent trip Las Vegas decided Spice Market buffet coupons heard good things already We didn't know only coupon could used per ticket  front desk people very rude no reason everything explained manager he proceeded ask if going eat breakfast staff being rude wasn't priority  left didn't chance try anything  <EOR> Got buffet Buffet pass bridal party final stop dinner  lot choose quality good desserts plentiful  my only gripe soft serve machine broken    Service prompt friendly would try again  <EOR> Came dinner didnt run into long wait all  Food pretty good atmosphere also pretty good  happy actually middle eastern station even more pleased good was  ended being only thing ate! exception fresh cut fruit shrimp cocktail <EOR> I used come lot when Aladdin shortly became PH  tried dinner recently but brunch good past although price now $25 per person  bad choice if you're looking buffet type breakfast lunch probably better buffets Vegas  <EOR> Not impressed   Variety food good  quality much  Desserts tasty  worth expense   charged $5 extra per person being group 12    although server gone most time   good steak house would better deal  <EOR> Yikes! Where start?! pretty easy going buffets generally always good thing   Unfortunately Spice Market didn't deliver   First while eating food watched chefs use bare hands transfer food dish dish yes food eat! Generally big complainer but when ready serve food your dish towel back ready serve food   I'm less thrilled   Next watched same chef take food OFF customer's plate place back into serving line! Oh my! Glad didn't eat prime rib because she served SAME piece back ANOTHER customer!  As food? More half ate cold lukewarm best   actually waitress test sliders still mostly frozen! Such waste!  Also place such good reviews desserts can't say all impressed   many choices single label identifying any them know try?  Those did try totally bland tasteless   disappointed Buffet! <EOR> For 35 $ per person would think comes great service buffet which did just don't understand why people starve serve good food but employ those put hard working reputation line  case manager once again left family waiting front long standing line  hard put 2 tables together ? But easier seat 20 other people down  Once again People tend ignore seniors kids  Anyway visit place again  <EOR> As part Harrah's Buffet Buffets Spice Market Buffet worth trying least once   variety quality met expectations   One major caveat unlike just every other buffet restaurant Spice Market Buffet unique policy clearing off table if leaves napkins top drinks which *usually* indicates diners away getting more food returning    no idea long cleaning staff must wait before decide diners done if diners don't leave napkins top drinks but *may* contributing factor line backups  <EOR> Staying Elara time share wanted try buffet but lazy just headed Planet Hollywood walked through Miracle Mile Shops   Upon entering casino looked buffet which sort hidden     It late dinnertime weren't lot people but still ton food   immediately town grabbed exotic dishes kabobs lambs etc  then noticed your own burger proceeded request two medium well's cheese     I must eaten around 4 5 platefuls then time dessert   cupcake bar   Tons cupcakes tried maybe 6 them     I recommend place only if nearby if you're lazy   Otherwise should just gone ate somewhere else  <EOR> Another Las Vegas buffet which means another expensive  Spice Market Buffet favorite foods know of  cheaper Buffet Bellagio Wynn  came twice  Once before over over  Both times weren't busy  would come again see other items haven't gotten try  <EOR> The buffet beautiful selection   visually impressive   food just OK   ate half put plate then back try other things   few nice meat selections side dishes shrimp whole family liked   desserts great   endless alcohol option nasty watery wine   If choose option bottled beer then good deal   $33 99 age 11 $19 99 age 10 under seemed bit steep especially all trial error through find tasty food   service clearing plates replenishing beverages just OK   Don't tip when check wait see if your server attentive tip end   kids enjoyed experience   think husband would rather steakhouse spending $33 99 steak getting nice bottle wine  <EOR> We came down buffet since closest place some breakfast food Sunday morning  pretty good taking elevator down choice just any kind food want  don't think expect lobster crab 11 00am morning but some things prime rib other nice cuts meat    If you're gambling then you're probably going pay full price $25 more  Coming Chicago pretty steep price  You're only Vegas much why right? would probably back again if could eat twice much if huge amount comps  If money blow you're really hungry don't want far hotel then away eating being happy it  <EOR> My husband always love coming here  middle eastern section just delish  seafood always fresh much choose those huge crab legs it  desserts yummy  Cotten candy all different types cakes ice cream puddings! buffet top line! <EOR> The food sucks  Very generic tasteless  U pay get  only good thing place prime rib very well cooked tender   Tried buffet definitely coming back  worth it  $31 dinner <EOR> What happened Spice Market Buffet?  place used amazing really big foods around world people waited in   Maybe Planet Hollywood management killed but literally half size used food terrible many people eating right now   Sad because really good but overall gross experience  <EOR> felt eating refugee camp  $35 low end food worthy  They asked extra $20 ea express line which actually slows down regular line  want give yourself break before step in  Aria much better buffet one   I give 1 star because there's no zero star available  <EOR> So impressed  If wanted spend much brunch would've gone somewhere better but no people group wanted place  think should've questioned taste buds since she slightly sick congested    The place different stations  American Mexican Italian Asian Salad station Seafood Desserts MIddle Eastern which included Indian food because apparently India Asia according Planet Hollywood    The line quite long but around brunch lunch party waited line which didn't seem long wait  maybe didn't seem long since TVs playing Nets game people all Lin but digress  Once paid total came $31 wait seated which again didn't seem long wait  marked drink orders paper off search belly fulfilling food  usual breakfast food eggs benedict bacon a lot since don't really eat bacon lol well some fruit harsh browns  Another plate contained stuff Middle Eastern station some chicken curry basmati rice lamb stuffed tomato thing pita hummus  Well say enjoyed breakfast stuff aside non runny eggs benedict kinda disappointed Middle Eastern station  found food station bit bland asking Where spice whatever suppose be?!

Reading mixed reviews decided most people giving bad reviews picky  Lol And anyway  all purchased buffet buffets pass $60 w tax included price  why see myself?   Well     specifically because interested having some middle eastern cuisine   In section offered basmati rice tabouli couscous lamb kebab chicken curry roasted cauliflower well pita bread hummus tzaziki sauce   My first plate buffet full plate all things  Everything average curry notch above average  tried everything  Didn't hate but wasn't impressed  basmati rice which usually favorite part Crunchy  Flavor good but definitely needed cooked longer  The lamb pretty dry gristley which disappointing reading review tender amazing was   They also offered Mexican Italian Chinese section which couldn't find thing looked mildly appealing    I tried American section prime rib Yukon mashed potatoes I read review try them    sure Yukon style potatoes didn't find eating them   ? Just mashed potatoes yellow tint The prime rib decent offered horseradish horseradish cream   The seafood seemed pretty high traffic area  Crab legs mussels shrimp etc     I tried three things  Crab legs good shrimp mussels     thing found alarming  piling new crab legs shrimp top ones just sitting there  Sure said high traffic area but happens end day when bottom barrel crab leg  hours    ?

Wouldn't mind stopping back again if Vegas  <EOR> Buffets reputation being highest quality food   given   While buffet Planet Hollywood wide variety including Mediterranean station lacks any semblance quality scant offerings vegetarians pescetarians people eat fish veggies    So here's why gets star The sushi rice undercooked firm   sushi rubbery texture  The shrimp tempura crispy yet cold  The crab legs self service bar cold could blanched hot water taken eat chilled table   Chilled should mean crab legs frozen center  The Asian station absolutely no vegetarian offerings other steamed and undercooked rice  The soups only mediocre  The vegetables skewers Mediterranean station sit cutting board shared meat   baklava stale   also lacked sweetness filling other phyllo dough  The Mexican station allowed your own taco   rice   guess   undercooked   Thankfully meal comp   wouldn't pay hefty price tag dinner   would rather sit down restaurant quality over quantity dining bang   Now   ask Wynn buffet! <EOR> If best buffets strip then can't imagine bad ones like   wandered into Spice Market Buffet because wanted something quick casual dinner staying Planet Hollywood   Having never Las Vegas buffet before figured something needs experience anyway   First little surprised much cost $28 00   Isn't supposed cheap eats?

Creme Brulee help someone am falling fast! Definitely try buffet when Vegas  yummy worth !!!  Oh wait did mention Crab legs <EOR> Maybe came bad time before going 5 30 show see Gordie Brown  First cheap buffet no local discounts  seated because early time very few people here  own drinks  First tried jerk chicken wings rice pilaf green beans American section far left side  All good spice flavor but chicken sitting long hard  Green beans raw inside which recipe disaster GAS !! Rice okay  tried couple more thing but yuck  <EOR> In Vegas always least buffet  must say Saturday brunch carried wide selection actually good  strive stay #1 top buffets    For all buffet lovers consider getting buffet buffet all day pass  Explore other casinos offer  Rio all seafood harrah's should pretty decent  <EOR> Best buffet ever! Liked stations labeled country  took while seated only complaint  <EOR> one favorite vegas buffets usually must whenever we're town  vegas strip buffets expensive  25 bucks dinner   but ten bucks less wynn buffet really pretty good   soup salad pasta middle eastern section mexican   for vegetarian buffets worth but least food pretty good here  mean far food kept under heat lamps go  service also mucho excellente!  they also cotton candy station  awesome that?! time when very entertaining seeing where people put cotton candy  know when decided cotton candy before done eating  people quite innovative  cup stuck bowl where keep packets sugar   unfortunately last time cotton candy machine broken  probably two cotton candies late  <EOR> Huge selections different type foods  Don't know else say foods good buffet  <EOR> I'm sad because eaten Spice Market before year ago remember liking just fine   This time around quality lower taste gotten better  way champagne brunch really worth price  Crab legs? None  Oysters? Nada  Champagne? Creme brulee? Nowhere found   Still food worthy 3 stars  knocked star off service  When being seated host little condescending toward Uncle no apparent reason  Once seated waitress never once checked see if glasses needed refilled  literally hunt down refills entire meal when did attention easily 10 15 minute wait refills  Often instead helping tables she chatting co workers    Our plates also cleared very often   FINAL VERDICT edible inattentive service but really worth money <EOR> Priced $31 per person buffet definitely worth visit   6 people party very different tastes something everyone   American Seafood included some sushi Italian Mexican Indian salads soups incredible dessert station   little most things most delicious   Food hot fresh     The only complaint only person working register check in   Unfortunately if players card skip line kept getting cut front of   5pm took 20 minutes pay seated  can't imagine if arrived any later  <EOR> Horrible food don't waste your $$ worst buffet ever <EOR> The food good decent selection amazing  atmosphere isn't anything special  lively especially Vegas  groupon good price  Otherwise overpriced <EOR> mmmm delicious!  seafood section goood!  Alaskan crab legs amazing   and all halved cracked no hard work dig meat   desserts also amazing   I cheesecake bite   it looked scoop ice cream delicious   also banana cream pie favorite   Great tasting food sure!  If wider variety foods then would given 5 stars agreed best buffet vegas 07 award   comes very close book though  <EOR> I family brunch bit past noon last Sunday   line long but moved pretty quickly soon excitedly entered buffet its fare around world  While did appear many stations Middle Eastern Mexican upon approaching stations found very few choices each those stations   mom particularly dismayed seafood station its sorry selection few kinds shrimp couple kinds salmon more old looking fish no crab sushi sight     I Middle Eastern food pita bread harder side hummus watery   good bad   pasta possibly worst made think cafeteria food wasn't much could eat Asian station since don't eat meat other seafood   dad sister seemed enjoy few cuts meat American station   After tried seafood walked around look all food see wanted   salad bar favorite spinach salad but walked away when saw BUG half inch long spinach   thought myself first oh my    well guess hard wash every single bug many pounds spinach must put daily   But restaurant shouldn't responsible cleaning vegetables enough least large bug that?  My sister indifferent all food except bread tempura shrimp which she liked   garlic bread favorite thing other couple desserts but didn't pay $25 eat bread   fruit good dessert I liked cannoli except crepe   best part getting cotton candy dessert bar!    All all bland poor quality majority food and bug well sad selection outweighed fun desserts good bread   guess expectations high buffet   If no low expectations weekday lunch lower price maybe you'd find worthwhile but would much rather dish really tasty   could #1 buffet Vegas? <EOR> I'm only giving 2 stars because lady took plates kind funny wish could remember name Save your money!!! sad when leave buffet still hungry   they need add more food  also watching some come isn't appetizing   I'll come back when things change but till then stick off strip buffets considering local <EOR> The variety best mexican asian middle eastern offerings   buffet part  Buffet Buffets Pass   If into basic but tasty variety offerings then your place  <EOR> Atmosphere little old Las Vegas despite being located Planet Hollywood   Rather bland tables booths   eating alone offered tiny table right hostess desk   asked another table offered back next several families small children   best welcome!  Thank goodness food very good waiter attentive  friendly which more made hostess   All food very good almost seemed over ambitious buffet   Most could outstanding if didn't sit buffet    place large array food extensive   really enjoyed meal  <EOR> Decent food selection never experienced wait line during visits date   Interesting also cotton candy included dessert selection time time  <EOR> My friends stayed Planet Hollywood past weekend tried place   food very good price reasonable   Great variety would come again if staying Hotel   Good food big selection plus good service     that's 4 5 book  <EOR> Grab seat order your drink straight plate crab plate peeled shrimp cocktail sauce lemon butter  Sit eat  Order refill your drink  Next chinese section fill half plate Middle Eastern section hook yourself tandoori chicken curry chicken  Find your table again eat  Next order your hot drink choice coffee tea grab cheesecake apple cherry chocolate crepe  Enjoy your dessert  before leave grab couple cotton candy!

Absolutely recommend   Try treasure island mgm buffet instead almost same price way better food  <EOR> This place deserves zero star  food quality terrible horrible service we wait good 15 minutes seated very slow hour day  employees rude unhelpful seems never learned smile over priced terrible food  Do waste your money go elsewhere  <EOR> Went Sunday Brunch today  happy find offer 20% locals discount  sad experience quality food  12 dining all noticed same thing    the food hot  server friendly but SLOW  Perhaps since tip already charged did feel need impress  big selection but nothing great  shame quality used much better  Such nice property sad see down hill  <EOR> I Breakfast Buffet upon hearing lots good recommendations friends yelpers dissapointed  Even though wide variation different food culture flavor good  Everything kinda taste same while  only delicious food Ice Cream  expensive compared better buffet ate Paris Las Vegas Hotel  friends ended eating lots shrimp champange order money worth spending  <EOR> I would call myself buffet buff probably 85% big buffets Las Vegas  find buffet nice vegan selection  love Mid Eastern  dishes resemble authentic cuisine  service so so don't see big difference compared other buffets  Overall would consider top 5 list  <EOR> This best buffets strip opinion  variety freshness food always top notch  especially love middle east section  excellent tandori chicken  If kids bringing whole family great place! very kid friendly both atmostphere menu  Plus desserts excellent well  Service drinks little slow but hey buffet  <EOR> The Spice Market second day because friend Jerad wouldn't shut im glad he didn't! food good two stand outs were The sausage peppers which tasted eating back home Little Italy N Y C  They pork tenderloin glazed apple sauce apple inside hate admit but wen thirds  <EOR> Most food ok  cooking staff unprofessional  Watched chef use tongs pick garbage floor put gloved hand use same hand garbage re stack plates  Found finger nail oatmeal but manager said oh he doesn't think someone would cutting nails over oatmeal  Really  your answer!

may girl but sure eat football player! =]   The selection salad bar Asian Italian Mexican Mediterranean American desserts  salad bar very good because everything looked very limp  could tell whoever bought produce doesn't know choose right fruits vegetables  Asian entrees bit salty   not fan  Italian area looked very good but quality wise   not much  pasta bit dry well meatballs  Another disappointment Bacchanal Buffet   Guess Vegas wasn't set Italian foods? just own Italian dishes =]  The Mexican area would thought would good but disappointed  nachos created falling apart  chips thin couldn't hold much ingredients  toppings made fresh except pico de gallo  guacamole watered down  meats didn't look very good just sitting drying up   The cheese quesadilla good! wasn't hot cheese hardened  All say sad     Nothing against Mediterranean foods but once tried awhile back   I wasn't feeling very well can't say much station  But kabobs looked nice  American selection wasn't great   I asked rare slice prime rib gave well done very good service  Could said wait next come out   decided wait later meat bit tug eat but descent though  also sausage ham  Chicken noodle soup first tasted good but second bite   man definitely taste black pepper  Broke sweat   JK! macaroni cheese didn't look good eat   should stuck first impression but decided take huge portion still  tasted horrible   the macaroni cooked thank goodness compared Bacchanal Buffet   but cheese overcooked didn't enough flavor  Another disappointment   The dessert station watching Cupcake Wars   WAY MANY! Just looking different flavors cupcakes made want chuck everything back out  did try red velvet cupcake dry  icing   do know sour there   Then tried fruit tart which very good except crust  cheesecake extremely thick bland    Overall would recommend coming but Vegas late stayed Paris   So second closest place eat Planet Hollywood  However service ok   not best  Didn't take plates very often  Also   where sat   it broken   so bruise booty    = guess unlimited apple juice made though =] <EOR> We came accident  thought buffets buffets planet Hollywood  Since already starving decided give try  came around 5 30 dinner  Dinner price $40  inside small buffet    The food okay  expected little better  choice sea food italian American Asian middle eastern Mexican  also very big dessert area    I tried following Sea food Sushi little hard very good  veggie roll spicy tuna California roll Cocktail shrimp decent Crawfish rice pretty good Crab legs really good whole plate them  Shrimp penne pesto really good must try   Crab pasta Alfredo really creamy delicious  Italian Pepperoni pizza slice okay could've probably skipped Blacked chicken pasta good Parmesan garlic wings really great taste   American Pork loin juicy amazing flavor Steak amazing cooked little rare but just perfect Mac cheese alright just 2 spoons   Asian  Low mein fan little flavor less   Fried rice good but definitely better   Egg roll good   Over all food okay  would've rather paid $10 Wicked Spoon  good just seemed heated microwave    The service good  left happy stuffed which wanted  <EOR> Honestly don't understand why many low ratings buffet  price paid think well worth it  Bought coupon Tix4tonight $2 per person  Then 25% off lunch 50% off dinner  Dinner only paid $17 49 before tax  Some highlights dinner crab legs shrimp prime rib short rib lamb Mediterranean section  If love Asian food don't come because don't much variety food doesn't look delicious all  Mexican section pretty good  However very limited choices salad bar fruits  many cupcakes desert section if love cupcakes it! also cotton candy which cute!

My boyfriend came across Groupon Spice Market decided purchase buffet option  $43 two people all you can eat and drink including beer wine champagne brunch  also breakfast lunch options weekdays but dinner choice currently sold out   I'm giving Spice Market four stars based alcohol bottomless mimosas   hell yea! incredible dessert station  rest buffet decent but probably three stars best    Things loved The cupcake selection phenomenal! must 12 different varieties fancy cupcakes  tried four cookies cream chocolate mint caramel apple smores little piggy almost ate all those four cupcakes  personal favorite chocolate mint super creamy mint frosting but all four them incredible  If only more room belly!  The prime rib great! Perfectly cooked tasted perfection when dipped au jus  enjoyed two slices tender meat   The mac cheese surprisingly good  tried other buffets always find bland but perfectly seasoned even back seconds  chicken pesto pasta Italian bar also tasty dish   Things Didn't Love The fresh sliced turkey dry gravy funny taste it  love turkey gravy big disappointment   The salad bar very tiny  know lot people salad buffet but always little salad meal  guess feel slightly healthier while gorging all deliciousness  But very few toppings ranch liking I'm very particular ranch dressing restaurants     The mashed potatoes which admit didn't even try looked incredibly runny strangely yellow  happened fluffy white potatoes?

The cupcake bar fun exotic sounding cupcakes but cupcakes very ordinary   The sushi mediocre 2 bites didn't want any more    bad Yelp doesn't 3 1 5 star option  <EOR> For price thought buffet just okay  Price dinner $30  Yes crab legs  Pardon if don't all a twitter over that  Lots buffets crab legs  actually think best dish salmon soy glaze  actually quite delicious    Despite fact buffet still some salad meats thought salad fixings minimal  Most prepared salads raw salad fixings  Kind disappointing    Chinese food selection shady looking didn't there  Mediterranean section very nice although think baba ganoush bit off    Prime rib ok much better Golden Nugget if believe that dessert section also just okay  yams fabulous!  If you're going buffets while Vegas maybe buffet buffets pass around $45 think which gives 24 hours buffet eating any Harrah's properties  If hit 2 buffets 24hours takes sting prices  If aren't going hit 2 buffets 24 hours don't it  Also now there's no buffet Bally's may see more traffic Spice Market Paris    prepared lines peak dining times  <EOR> The BEST buffet ever to!!!! choice food great anytime come breakfast lunch dinner food just amazing!

Some things most buffets lack some flavor but most part everything tastes good always presented fresh  think people forget places can't over season everything trying cater everyone's needs  Some extra salt some food almost none can  making mass amounts food expect some things under seasoned  always add more your table salt pepper shaker  My favorite thing they're Mac N Cheese add bacon it  Then grab some bread sticks side where serving pizza  then dip break sticks into mac n cheese sauce delish! carb over load? Duh    but counting Vacation Vegas?? Plus need bread help soak all alcohol consuming while you're eating  don't want tipsy before start your day!

Hummus    $30 two during lunch no alcohol  <EOR> Came dinner start off Buffet Buffets gluttony fest since buffet opens latest  No line 930pm  open till 11pm dinner $30  wasn't good remembered be  eaten many times before    but years ago  crab legs dinner    but cold  However later saw people asking steamed guess warmed well  prime rib good tender juicy  variety food vast    but food bad   guess many places copying Wicked Spoon doing small individual portions because some items served here  fried rice fried chicken shrimp cocktail individual servings  thought fried rice pretty good Asian selections did taste Asian lol  Asian chicken wings    did taste marinade them home  BBQ pork buns quite good well but very soft! bun falls apart very easily! fried chicken also juicy tasty    I big desserts here    but large selection cupcakes! However cupcakes typical size cupcakes harder try more flavors  mini cupcakes because try more  also crepe but crepe itself pre made  warm fill whatever want  if want good FRESH made crepes Paris buffet way go    I would eat again if doing buffet buffets deal    but probably if paying full price buffet itself  Even though dinner over 11pm believe still eat till 1130 so    least  heard guys saying table next me  came 1045pm  <EOR> Good verity foods  Taste good well  Nice place family kids  <EOR> The quality food really gone down hill think price gone lot!  selections still good but just doesn't taste very good   lines    ugh  don't think we'll back <EOR> 2 5 I'd say  going wow really if you're going quality then buffets always seem worst way when comes down lol    We actually pretty quick waited maybe 5 minutes  Space little cramped none food items ran while there  tried little everything general consensus bland    The miso soup tasted off exactly expect it  Sauteed veggies needed flavor mac n cheese decent but needed bread crumbs something kick up  pastas bland curry cauliflower needed more spice premade salads overdressed good way  lasagna mostly just ground meat without enough cheese actually balance it   I'd say things actually liked stuffed sole mashed potatoes mac n cheese since sole actually tasty other two easily fixable issues  Black pepper seemed easiest way really    Necessary recovery night but think venture elsewhere next time town  <EOR> Crab legs check  Pot Roast check  Burritos you them yourselves check  Kung Pao Chicken check  Overpriced buffet 3 4 check  D  Went Saturday heavily packed many people families cheerleaders the cheerleader competition going weekend Vegas heavily dressed people   friend desperately wanted having sale where if check into Facebook there's Pay Person Another Person Free deal   AWESOME!!! totally would gone if deal wasn't there   price person $30  worth me   But because deal would again just all awesome food have!!

For similar pricing you're better off eating next door Paris buffet! glad only came breakfast $20   Based breakfast items wouldn't high expectations lunch dinner   Final thoughts? AVOID <EOR> My husband free buffets show  Well only thing impressed crablegs steamed hot unlike other buffets Vegas  husband few good items  cupcakes awesome though why 3 stars instead 2 <EOR> Went back try again service still mediocre food quality gone downhill  used good price but now quality selection food worth it  shame because used favorite buffet  selection limited food quality good anymore  servers customer oriented 10 year old daughter asked dessert server crepe she told hey come back 20 minutes because she busy restocking area  am sorry inconvenience crepe when your job  just wait 20 minutes paying $150 dinner your job done your schedule  <EOR> Skip buffet if you're Las Vegas  bad regular standard  slightly better hometown golden coral  But strip pretty unimpressive  lot food but dont look fresh  prime rib pretty good because freshly made but other stuff unimpressive  Rather doing poor job making food every continent should focus 1 2 good it  <EOR> We really wanted breakfast but closed 11am prepare serve lunch   $5 00 off per person coupon Planet Hollywood hotel     FOOD SELECTION I impressed   am Chinese Chinese lunch looked horrible     I enjoyed Mediterranean buffet section because lamb dolmas grilled vegetables etc     I disappointed selection  much diverse selection but does hone key items     Service ambiance spacious good    I come back here  <EOR> Seeing gave sneak preview PH review more detailed version   Spice Market most interesting concept buffet seen  Being foodie access some best buffet's outside Vegas hold restaurant  type high regard  quality quantity good amounts both reside here  really only eat American non ethnic foods long before getting absolutely bored living working growing highly diverse communities found passion flavors world  something Vegas failed understand standard buffets other casino's  Sure everything you'd expect sausage prime rib crab legs shrimp pasta burgers etc but also KBBQ cous cous vegetarian dishes besides vegetables kabobs spring rolls pad thai carne asada lamb gyro  deserts could better but honestly think just need more hip  Offer some cake pop's some bread pudding just brownies sundae's chocolate fountains  desert game uncharted territory them usually only big boys really diversify into level  Service excellent price marginally higher comparable standard buffets other casino's   It basically multi ethnic food court stacked top Vegas buffet  Lets face demographics speak themselves people come people live work there  Expose yourself some culture come eat here  remind more home when you've Vegas long   The bad thing eat buffets pretty often stuffing face while flaw fixed  explored off strip found some gems but if taking 10 minute taxi isn't your thing want stay within your casino hotel fine establishment  <EOR> Nothing terribly memorable place  admit wasn't hungry should kinda sorta recovering blackout night before   so take rating grain salt suppose ^_^   I breakfast buffet $15 which seems pretty standard Vegas  Nothing really special buffet remember except pizza which made really excited morning  Everything else just your standard eggs not so fresh bacon sausage hash browns etc  made 3 4 through plate before grossed myself didn't near money's worth    But service great! waitress gave two big glasses OJ didn't ask another later hehe   very considerate    So yeah if you're staying Planet Hollywood doesn't hurt grab breakfast here  But I'd vie breakfast over Le Village Buffet Paris instead *wink wink* <EOR> This really good buffet   stopped when Planet Hollywood gave discount voucher   all standard fare would expect   Once thing noticed quality seemed better other buffets including Rio's World buffet     Service also good server came around often take care drinks   sure discount coupons pass getting new player card   good deal   We lunch wasn't huge variety exotic foods read other reviews   coming back few months staying Planet Hollywood come back round two  <EOR> This buffet solid 3  $30 99 person dinner  $11 99 all drink   I thought nice different influenced stations food  seafood Italian asian American middle eastern mexican soups+salad desserts Seafood American top 2 Asian station oily poorly flavored food  comparable Panda Express   Mexican middle eastern also some basic options only  Nothing amazing  The dessert option large sisters enjoyed trying different things but wasn't par expected Vegas  did cotton candy tho fun   It nice try first Vegas buffet but did expect bit more  <EOR> Spice market best buffet Strip but worst either   Bottom line pretty wide selection good value $25 non guests   Variety quality very good though word Spice waited line over hour seats which disappointing    The carving Mediterranean stations best opinion but really hoping crab legs seafood section buffet did deliver   love good crab leg   Mmmmm    damn Spice Market  <EOR> I kept calling place Spice World all day realizing mixing name buffet title second Spice Girls' album  Oh well   Honestly good!

Eh   The prime rib while divine cut thin enough could see through it  But flavor notes just everything else made it    Aside cupcakes  icing many them straight whipped butter lacking any other flavor aside Heart attack     The wait staff seemed disgruntled when friend asked another glass water waitress picked husband's yet sipped glass handed her  Talk lazy nasty! <EOR> Take advantage reduced prices good food while under renovation   Salad Mediterranean Mexican good   Ham perfect   Very clean   Nice staff   Restrooms inside don't leave restaurant  <EOR> This first meal married couple wanted something close room well   ya know lol   anyway   it noon when arrived much suprise food little cold notified staff   after getting back home decided call SMB let them know experience   they apologized offered comp meal new husband when come back   I thought very nice  <EOR> Spice Market Planet Hollywood's own buffet quite good one  If stay hotel also 10% discount which basically only covers tax $30 per head   food selection excellent  Mexican Chinese Middle Eastern Italian grill seafood  Personally seafood lover stuck mostly seafood but did try least thing every section  Snowcrab legs every buffet most popular thing menu people just grabbing plates them  Sometimes hot sometimes chilled which little weird  food tasty though all ate ourselves into food coma    We prime dinner time 6 PM wait line 45 minutes  There's line casino floor take escalator downstairs wait another line  little disappointing finally through line only into another  service spotty sometimes no would pick plates until few collected sometimes right finished  only buffet Vegas don't something compare except buffets must say better buffets ever terms food quality  <EOR> We staying Planet Hoolywood decided try place  actually pretty good but place touted # 1 buffet LV that  Harrahs card cost down under $20 choices really good  crab stuffed sole good any restaurant  sister in law purch Groupon thing ate very reasonably    The creme brle delicious flan  dozen cup cakes cotton candy plus bunch other stuff   I read some people waited over 40 minutes eat  think would pissed given them lower grade but food dollar value very good  If see line somewhere else  <EOR> I champagne brunch  line long pay seated thought good sign  champagne cheapest ever tasted  food terrible felt guilty eating bite throwing away  kept trying new things very small portions hoping find something because hungry  thing say liked  boyfriend ate shrimp said tasted spoiled  first place ate Vegas stomach wasn't right rest trip  drink service awful took 20 min served  <EOR> Very awesome buffet! breakfast mostly eggs muffins but lunch when good stuff arrives  large variety everything! Just dive see yourself into  Best Buffet Las Vegas very reasonable price! <EOR> It only gets 3 stars because groupon  If paid full price would probably two stars  aria's buffet far superior    However want say desserts delicious contrary some reviews talking only cotton candy cupcakes  expanded other items rank right wynn's dessert concoctions  <EOR> I'd would say far Vegas buffet offers decent quality $ pay  every othe time visited would probably again  <EOR> Waitress amazing  Didn't really eat much   thankfully because all done leave cockroach running all over table  Two waitresses saw caught napkin disposed kinda seemed normal ordeal them  When know there's more  I'd just careful if end eating there  <EOR> In opinion best buffets Vegas   They nice variety foods   Mediterranean Italian Mexican Seafood American much more   No other buffets gone last few years offer large variety foods including lamb kabob! Huge variety foods here  crab legs already sliced half dont worry breaking them  cool that? Great dessert selection including favorites flan   We able great deal Groupon 4 people $75 well worth it   Staff great polite clean dishes refill drinks promptly  additional $12 person all drink beer wine   The decor average but all honesty decor takes second place food  Right? <EOR> A standard buffet generic selections  But hey if pay $12 more all alcoholic beverages free   I visited brunch choices included nothing really stood out     Except cotton candy   at buffet brunch   any upon browsing different cuisines American Chinese Italian Seafood Mexican etc  dishes foods those could easily home  said nothing grabbed attention  American standard eggs Benedict bacon hash browns etc  even Italian expected lasagnas other pastas  Even some food dry cooked long left while  plates would fill food then would only able eat 1 4 1 3 plate grab because flavors bland food worse though  checked Mexican Soup bars did even care any items there   The only thing really stood simply crepes  smaller half size normal crepe pre cooked choices filling strawberries bananas foster caramel light no alcohol   topping station next soft serve ice cream machine again generic toppings NO NUTELLA  Everywhere where sweet crepes served always Nutella always    The DRINKS included variety wines Chardonnay white wines mimosas etc  mimosas alright but wines white wines Chardonnay dry lacked flavor    Thankfully party waited long enough lunch menu served pretty much closed down Seafood bar plate plate crab  <EOR> This place great but prime rib best ever had!

There basically no diversity culture types beyond typical American diner options sausage scrambled eggs bacon  felt place typical buffet made Denny's menu  Hash brown bit mushy benedict quite dry  fifth food options just various forms bread muffins more carbs! Pancakes white porridge nothing more ordinary  Everything felt pre made because saran wrap covering most buffet items giving atmosphere most items heated oven without thought freshness   Looking old Hollywood movie posters dot wall quite frankly more exhilarating eating breakfast here! similar prices entree definitely walk over Cafe Hollywood only better breakfast but also better appreciation Hollywood culture thru throwback pictures!

Ok ok stop sidetracking stay course      no wonder reviews annoying long?  LOL! Spice Market Buffet located Planet Hollywood  way unless know Planet Hollywood's location seen sign far away wouldn't know if stand front it   don't any signs showing Planet Hollywood except Miracle Mile Mall  Casino posted above entry way    My buddy confused where he but able guide thru Once entered into line then prompted into real buffet line downstairs   Spice Market Buffet used Arabian themed but since take over Hollywood now see posters movies hanging walls   nice before trying more sophisticated   Food really pretty good   much better ones located central strip area   Salads Mexican Asian Seafood Mediterranean Italian nice dessert section     My highlights following     Lamb Kabobs    fresh off grill dipped tzatziki sauce     wonderful pairing kabobs slightly salty which balanced perfectly light yogurt cucumber sauce   Very refreshing!  However big fan grill meats because tend bit dry compared likes other kabobs such Satay izakaya but buddy thought better ones he's I'd take word it   very flavorful though  Got some prime rib Mushroom Rougut    man    did ever tell much love mushrooms?  best firm texture mushrooms which addicted to   Pairing tender prime rib definitely world   I then back bowl mushroom only!  Please miss mushrooms if ever here!  thank this! Had some salads needed increase veggie intake overall veggies veggies    nothing special discuss but fresh!  thousand island dressing which always yummy!  Now onto main portion   seafood      Fried sole absolutely jammin!  Imagine actual fish n chip except fish definitely over battered meat if full juicy!  If plate say 6 pieces some fries your $11 worth already!  did great job fried fish! My buddy buffalo popcorn shrimp missed it   He really enjoyed kick added crunchiness which good pairing   Very inventive buffet usually only see straight deep fried shrimp   Now onto favorite dish them all wrapped filet sole wrapped around crab filling   those frequent readers reviews remember experience Le Village buffet Paris rose filet sole?  Remember much loved that?  Well     just topped because near identical except now crab fillings    eating rose sole ravioli then once bite into you've just entered crab cake dimension    OMG delicious!!!    Now see why didn't more items?  stuck sole never turned back             I did little bit dessert though    Fresh strawberry tart Tiramisu not past which only disappointment really cool cotton candy station where everyone take cotton candy go!!!  Kids absolutely love it!  So if Vegas strongly recommend 24hr pass so access buffet anytime your heart desires also save money visit Spice Market Buffet   great tip    if want visit Paris Buffet anticipate nice long wait must early   If just simply walk over next door Spice Market PH notice line half size also service much more faster because Paris moves speed snail       Vegas every second matters all fun excitement calling your all times    smart choice! <EOR> I bought deal off Travelzoo visited buffet dinner during trip Vegas  good  Everything tried just barely edible really disappointed  Yes lot choices but wasn't any better going Golden Corral  <EOR> Basic    Ate dinner because buy free vouchers friend took advantage  definitely wouldn't pay full price [$40 per person   add $12 alcoholic beverages] buffet    Nothing really made say oh wow!   did Mediterranean section because looooove hummus curry chicken other foods Mediterranean persuasion  spent much time portion buffet trying whatever had  bad  Another plus Mexican section bomb ass Mexican corn  Tore up   The dessert section major disappointment  cookies?! love cupcakes super excited see variety but all tasted same even though supposedly all different fancy flavors  Boo  Ice cream machine kept breaking down couldn't kiddos ice cream kept promising them if ate food    Decent food decent service nice restaurant   loved different movies posters hanging throughout place  come back if voucher again    <EOR> Not bad nice variety cultures  favorite though  Lot food lacking but wasn't downright disappointing  Foods need more flavor sure  <EOR> Feel am being way generous 2 star definitely very disappointing only half star away compare wynn?

Great variety selections!   The crab legs bit salty    Very friendly helpful staff! <EOR> I read some very good reviews buffet site others wife made point dinner Tuesday evening  both very disappointed  admit there's lots variety dishes sound high quality but reality set very quickly  few dishes good but great many not  short ribs basically just fat gristle cut prime rib easily 60% fat Asian steamed bun pork dry stopped bite some Mid Eastern lamb skewers tough gave two bites  idea  excellent item meat balls Italian station  No way I'd back buffet  <EOR> We Spice Market Buffet dinner tonight around 9 00PM  give only star place mainly because demeanor cashier name Mona seemed ignoring looking moving back counter  She basically ignored 5 minutes  When another couple came behind she quickly said help   She should working position greeting public  She should fired  follow letter management  The food buffet bad although expensive $36 per person  <EOR> Delicious plenty options   If you're Vegas want hit good buffet cannot wrong here!  plenty variety all above average  <EOR> The signs say best buffet Vegas but girlfriend weren't overwhelmed two breakfasts Spice Market  food service alright nothing more the scrambled eggs runny example   helped received $5 off coupon upon check in Planet Hollywood coupons also available online   cute touch framed posters movies involving food all around  <EOR> Price now $25 brunch champagne automatically included   even better time when last there   actually enjoyed more Bellagio's   Crab stuffed sole buffalo shrimp pork brisket tandoori chicken all excellent   Dessert chef back room fresh batch pie display nice it   Low line 1 30 Saturday surprised me   Everything great even down pineapple   Champagne quality seemed bit higher recall too   actually don't need mix OJ now stomach it  <EOR> Went 830ish breakfast midweek Groupon   Omelet station good expected but everything else subpar  Service slow although no line many people there   Dishware dirty   Would definitely recommend without discount   groupon $10 person buffet unlimited alcohol   Unlikely return but worked time since cup coffee might work close $10 some places     <EOR> I don't source but told collegues rated best buffet 2007  see why   Let's start crab legs leg man? crab succulent sweet  Many other buffets overboiled tasteless crab but legs SUPERB!  also split legs down middle shelling your crab ordeal usually elsewhere  think ate half body weight crab if appear reddish hue may explain it   Prefer racks rather legs? honey glazed rack lamb melts your mouth  Tender juicy doesn't overwhelming lamb taste turns many away  honestly much lamb person myself but did come back seconds!  Most buffets peel your own shrimp which frankly isn't worth trouble but peeled already!  And prime rib cooked perfectly juicy chef cuts slice your specifications   It $30 person but if any items off set menu price per plate would approximate anyway couldn't seconds!   Highly recommended but come large appetite belt few extra notches  <EOR> Save your money different buffet  Prices increased everytime friends realize just wasn't worth it    Food mediocre best few items taste above average but just few  those place where fill your plate top don't eat half it  Ambiance nothing special very crowded felt being herded    I'm even joking put something food full very quickly  no joke  almost 10 friends skipped lunch came 5pm all completely famished ready attack! No ate much  no one! even 300lb guy promising buffet regret entrance he ate only moderately    For paying $25 $30 wait just expect more especially considering bunch times because plates small food  plus note location very convenient selection very broad  would preferred see smaller selection better quality people would actually eat food plates  <EOR> Ehhhh I'd somewhere else  Food good  Choices lot  Line short but its weekday sure even count that  2 soup choices both bland  2 3 different sushi choices  Food presentation awful  disappointed  2 friends before said use lot better  worth money  Rio buffet way better same $  But if really want great Vegas buffet    Try bacchanal Caesars  <EOR> There's really nice selection everything categorized dish   We used 2 for 1 won hotel which brought bill $30 which nice buffet  The waitress bringing drinks very attentive ensured table cleared plates when we'd more   Overall good food   Good atmosphere Friendly staff <EOR> Not entirely impressed buffet  same ranking Bacchanal Wicked Spoon but typical Hometown Buffet esque buffet either  I'd rank your more average but not much Vegas buffet  If understand just said then need lay off buffets  both  My cousin came Fourth July brunch  special menu really wasn't special begin with   The only reason tempted give place fact Mediterranean section  But good cause all Mediterranean food tasteless  Chicken lamb kebabs dry tabbouleh wasn't terrific  just everything section wasn't great   I really enjoyed prime rib though  But could found basically every Vegas buffet  You just gotta believe there  Desserts dull too   The rumors true  When you're Vegas gotta give those $50+ buffets try  Anything below gamble  But guess  Vegas all right? <EOR> I purchased really good groupon basically under $80 able snag dinner 4 people unlimited beer wine  pretty good Vegas buffet   The food good being popular ones  lighting little dark inside but price food decent   We loved cotton candy dessert station! never seen before!

Cold pita no gyro   ALL meats served bland dry  only decent items soft serve few desserts the cupcakes looked nice but cake super dry Its Vegas should known instinct eat Rio  <EOR> Start dessert   or maybe just eat dessert    We came brunch because groupon unlimited drinks   felt obligated drink many mimosas possible because buffet awful especially value   No way would ever come back if groupon   Even case feel mildly swindled    Nothing really stands mind being good food   Lots things obviously frozen prepackaged   crepe cherry pie filling brutal disappointment     I did Baba Ganooj naan   place used Aladdin   Stick know     Dry sliders dry meat turds shrimp chewy tempura just disappointment disappointment   But buffet   Try hate move on    Why two stars    cotton candy machine! <EOR> Average best    We stayed Planet Hollywood every time casino could see huge line into place figured would check champagne brunch since seemed popular    What say ate BUNCH food drank BUNCH champagne but food just eh  know buffet but something called SPICE MARKET should use little more spice spruce bland food  only thing saved awesome guy wouldn't let champagne glass anywhere near empty! <EOR> We eaten many times over past years always enjoy food   Prime Rib really good   Desserts used amazing while still tasty they've basically turned everything into cupcake which find really strange   Creme Brle still good   If pie luck because none    We groupon glad sure I'd happy paying full price buffet   good deal groupon  Biggest complaint because large party 12 charged 18% gratuity $40!!!!! which waaaaaaaaay high service any buffet let alone server good all   She forgot drinks never brought them very unfriendly   She did deserve $40 feel very unnecessary   Next time we'll request 2 separate tables leave appropriate tip service rendered  <EOR> Planet Hollywood Spice Market Buffet used good breakfast buffet   Ever since Harrah's took over Planet Hollywood buffet doesn't taste good before   frequently come breakfast buffet when visit weekend know am talking about   Very good omelets bacons desserts   Although griddle pancakes pancakes kinda hard new items mcd lookalike sausage mcmuffin tasted horrible tri tips kinda dry   Maybe wrong time  <EOR> The last time Spice market Buffet when hotel still Aladdin  first last time visiting Spice Market Buffet    Came back past sunday give another try since now Planet Hollywood  $23 pp brunch champagne included you'll add $3 unlimited champagne    The food okay just very typical buffet food  nothing amazing  You'll find mid eastern asian mexican american italian  cuisines    there no line when since 1130am plus  wouldnt mind coming back place but definitely first choice    The atmosphere ambiance alright  comfortable  servers  quick friendly  <EOR> One lesser buffets Vegas but decent nowhere near horrid Flamingo's train wreck paradise retirement home   At least crab legs which decent OK prime rib decent selection Mediterranean Mexican mid eastern cuisine   An entire two stars off Italian section which just confusing tasted worse Souplantation   Not many selections larger buffets Vegas but least couple good items    1 points off nasty TVs  Fix burn in screen doesn't turn white people into pasty yellow  <EOR> I bought groupon buffet eating honestly say glad didn't pay full price     It very busy Tuesday night we waiting line register almost hour then line seated another 20 minutes so    food pretty standard regular buffet really high quality Vegas buffets   little disappointed   counters dirty not surprising since many people food little scarce too   An ok deal if groupon time wait  <EOR> This probably better buffets ever ! different cuisines Italian Mexican Middle Eastern buffet top notch  Everything hot fresh all drink wine didn't hurt ! Great find ! <EOR> The food average enough Thanksgiving day trip   arrived around 1045 11 11 special buffet expecting line   Surprisingly no line allowed seated paying only breakfast buffet price   saving grace considering learned shortly thereafter despite ad special buffet clearly stating inclusion crab legs did inform anyone menu item wasn't served until 3pm   Anyone unfortunate enough arrive say 1130 wouldn't option but would pay exact same price those arrived later day   Seems stipulation should stated any ad crab big draw trip  <EOR> This used favorite Strip buffets but quality variety food really gone down hill   When walked into restaurant 1 00pm absolutely no line red flag    seated restaurant only 30% occupied   Needless say food just sat under heat lamps forming crusts   I tried several pasta dishes all tasted same despite varied descriptions   The desert bar overrun cupcakes   Cheap cheap cheap   I tried Flank Steak chewy despite cooked medium Tandoori Chicken overcooked   shredded chicken could re purposed shoe laces    I returning Spice Market   I'd rather pay little extra money dine Wynn Bellagio gourmet dining experience  <EOR> I'm sure all negative reviews about   wait wasn't long probably 15 minutes little before 6pm   ended filling plates plates steamed snow crab legs shrimp cocktails   steamed ones much better cold ones   Then enough room sliver prime rib candied sweet potato   YUM   finally finished off meal taste 4 different cupcakes fruit tart   could lost control eaten ALL   I agree plates things just didn't sense why buffet mashed potatos?  pasta?  corn muffins? Why would fill nonsense?!  kabobs looked good but just no room bellies anymore   It's worth if groupon deal pay $45 2 people  <EOR> I may given another star place being crammed together  think could use lose few tables open dining area also PLEASE pull your tables away area where people walking buffet  never seated closely actual food  table basically dessert section   As food there's lot selection numerous stations different ethnic foods choose from   I sampled mainly seafood crab legs peel n eat shrimp some buffalo popcorn shrimp yum! some sushi dry yuck   Tried some food Mediterranean section  Hummus dates lamb naan bread olives etc  Okay but great better Greek food elsewhere   Mexican American meat carving areas did interest although Father In Law nice looking piece prime rib  husband also some fried chicken he said quite tasty   Desserts Mainly dessert section cupcakes although did manage find some pretty decent cannolis  cupcake OK but kind dry  honestly don't even remember which kind now but if thing cupcakes love place   Overall bad  course Father In Law paid bill can't complain  But would throw down money myself?

When line pay rude black lady talking didn't speak english  may asian but definitely know speak english  She told another cashier other side but many people squished together did want squish through squished while paying! let know know option but would rather push through people  told just because pay sooner squish does mean seated faster because already line backed people waiting seated  backed cashier wasn't even calling come over! She waiting hostess seat people everyone could comfortably walking around! Then hear old ass grandpa wanted cuss because said  even rude   I just letting lady know  sorry but think 65 year old man cussing 19 year old girl just ridiculous  Completely classless!!

Won't coming back buffet because love hot steamed crab  <EOR> For breakfast brunch buffet Spice Market Buffet steal opinion  fresh fruits omelet station assorted cheeses meats even offerings eggs benedict  nutshell buffet seemed everything imaginable would want consume  Service little spotty since both days jammed but  understandable  no expert buffets but considering wanted something relatively quick much hassle Spice Market Buffet fit bill  <EOR> It second time trying buffet once dinner once brunch    Dinner The food alright plenty options chose service good   Brunch Disappointing honestly  feel buffet strip $25 per person options should better any regular hotel inn breakfast options  Also food's taste wasn't good would think   I would local spots instead next time  <EOR> Quality food poor   Lots choices but just didn't think food worth price   Think stand alone place better choice   You'll better quallity food eat less  <EOR> I experience much better service restroom  upset treated no reason only wanted sit something drink  But even difficult guess  We 24 hour buffet pass one  Paid  Waited seated  Waited some more  Waited some more  I would say 15 minutes wait seated nobody seating people  Finally taken spot  We sat  We waited drink  We waited some more  I told friend food would wait order drinks  Waited some more  I flag someone down then two servers argued table number whose table was  Yes ladies everyone area heard argue   Finally server came annoyed took drink order  When she returned incorrect  *sigh* Reorder wait  After saw nobody interested find doing if needed anything if alive  I believe when server arrived clear last plates pleasant surprise rolling eyes back when spoke  Gosh such love   What even more wonderful surviving cold looks staff watching them ooze gush over older couple sitting table away  red carpet treatment while died thirst  Not server deserved tip place service failed give   Food decent  Nice selection price  No soup bowls soup station  Boooooo  So if eat soup plate your hands your business  Cupcakes looked great  didn't taste great though  Just ok  <EOR> Stop 2 Buffet Buffet's adventure   place pretty good very flavorful food lots different styles foods     Food wise lots options but lot options each station   lot seafood though seafood fan didn't any but if your thing covered place   Being half Lebanese straight Middle Eastern station but fairly upset available   picked Dolmas which couple issues 1  served cold  2  sitting some form oil  3  served side Feta Cheese   Which Greek way serving them Middle Eastern way    also some lamb which haven't eaten lamb since child   lamb however perfectly cooked   very tender seasoned perfectly     I later picked some roasted turkey some chicken some Naan bread beans rice quesadilla   some Mac Cheese well but wasn't happy all didn't taste right good   did cupcake station which first glance offers tons different flavors cupcakes however most them hard some flavors good   Though did cream puff cupcake enough more 1   The food pretty solid however service great   waitress only gave 1 refill away most time there   would return place again suggest friends  <EOR> Spice Market used favorite buffets strip  However down sizing buffet less stellar  understand issues made them lose some area buffet  However totaled reduced buffet  town full buffets many more options  diamond total rewards member say totally disappointed  wife food lackluster lacked variety  also cut some best things such crab legs prime rib  often stay Planet Hollywood but won't back eat Spice Market  <EOR> Purchased Groupon spice market buffet hoping able enjoy Vegas buffet without having pay $60+ two  getting receipt waiting line seated 40 minutes Tuesday night watching two hostess arguing looked manager steps start seating everyone  finally seated grab food time waitress came table drink order utensils food cold  Food no good  would venture say below average  Best part dessert station other that    wouldn't come back nor would recommend it  <EOR> The first time came buffet would given 5 stars but trip only 4   The food pretty decent lots selection certain but some items looking forward fell flat   Chinese food actually worse some crappy joints searching LA perhaps need all reviews 2 3 stars    only seemed rare prime rib station   While bloody prime rib still mooing     The real problem renovation going Aladdin   buffet moved temporary location upstairs last time downstairs casino everything served catering dishes   hard see items labels aren't very large everyone walks along opening each beautiful btw catering dish see what's inside   little annoying seems some dining rooms little cramped   dining room seated main walkway back food but tight couple points only person could walk through time   I hope quality returns first impression but regardless does I'd wait until renovation complete before dealing one  <EOR> We ate other night free passes given last time ate horrible  Food poor quality server never stopped bringing beverages  all buffet options Vegas should off your list  Honestly paid time would've requested refund  <EOR> We because groupon only $45 2 which included unlimited beverages including alcohol also need pay tax restaurant $3 65    gave 3 stars because price otherwise may given 2 stars   food adequate ribs dry unnecessary kick fried chicken flavorless general tso's chicken dry every ham carving station dry many items just ordinary   Having said less then $49 unlimited drinks food   Mexican salad stations good pizza Italian station   don't eat seafood but seemed lot choices including crab legs   Desserts mostly assorted cupcakes okay   also crepe station soft serve ice cream

Perhaps way asking if needed anything  Hmmm     money back?   This 2 5 star tops  clicked 3 stars generous and prime rib   thinking    there's no need back next several years probably read Yelp reviews check if any improvements  <EOR> Very small buffet compared other buffets Vegas  Very very minimal food options food cold burnt  came first time Vegas thought great! guess gone down hill  Won't coming again  Very bland food  Gross  feel disgusting  <EOR> The employee taking money very rude family   She unclear instructions where wait line server sit you   another employee came over rude telling where line wait server seat us   asked hostess sat if talk manager way treated she pointed manager duty     second employee towards figured lost cause talk way he talked us  food pretty good tho  <EOR> Lame   advertise all international cuisine hardly any international   breakfast four things far east    And?

Although point painfully sober even hungrier   The food was     all right   Typical Vegas AYCE fare exception King Crab legs  Nothing remarkable special  even disappointed desserts  desserts key  If put lot work desserts then know entrees doubly good  Flan tasted off Strawberry tart spoiled watching old man pick off all strawberries leave tart there  Really old man  if old lady bribing way line much better    However unlike other Vegas AYCE buffets Spice Market Buffet unique offers Middle Eastern section which pleasant break usual Italian Seafood American sections  marinated feta cheese de LISH    Other okay buffet  hey rhymed! <EOR> I've lot buffets Vegas far favorite   don't expect much quality department when buffet because let's face we're quantity aren't we?  impressed wide variety food good was   definitely back to     However waitress beeeee atch   She rude literally yelled friend pulling chair booth when she arrived later rest us   WTF?

Since stomachs empty deal right price decided it    Upon arriving wait line 25 minutes so  standard any Vegas buffet  While line mouths watering read different summer time options board   Sadly place proved majority buffets decide try strip Bacchanal Wicked Spoon  food selection decent but half just did look appealing  kabobs looked little charred burnt pasta off taste it  it just wasn't expecting   The only thing saving adding extra star place would crab legs  crab legs contain lot more meat then crab legs other places  end night content just eating those   Would come again? Probably unless craving nothing but crab  opinion save your money somewhere better  <EOR> First time coming here  Food flavorful many varieties  4 plates crab legs! good! Only reason why giving 4 stars because wait 40 minutes line plenty tables occupied  <EOR> Not bad  The mid eastern section wins credit esp  Quite authentic  Other things match price  <EOR> Man wait long line time in   Still variety cleanliness good tasting food   woke late 300pm half way through took away lunch replaced dinner try both! har har  still preety darn good price variety food environment  <EOR> Another lengthy line buffet although suppose if buffet receives good ratings then where everyone wants eat    I around lunch time line 40 minutes  Terribly confusing line  because buffet downstairs when walk escalator see rope across meaning wait someone  did gazed menu bit   An employee standing few feet away tables asked few people behind if all going buffet pointed line behind pillar   No sign telling where line everyone concealment behind huge pillar casino  am tourist read signs but if don't none read then fault  several people front walked around rope shook head    So waiting among 10 people front thinking wasn't bad  waited 15 minutes then gentleman opened rope let all through  Once downstairs see true line   After cashier include another line waiting host seat you  lines really bound together people wanting see cashier bunched people ready seated  feel sorry employees because hell job all people   The food good lots selections  almost every area try something  Well stocked food hot   The server filling drinks smiling lot very kind  He quick did job well  <EOR> The first time Vegas 5 years ago all Caesars property buffets blew away   selection quality presentation would warranted least 4 5 stars   But recently all say ****???  Caesars utterly completely destroyed once great buffet   seems they've cut entire space half crammed few stations tasteless luke warm trash food would served low class Jersey Diner   Caesars done??  Put some money into place remodel GREAT again! <EOR> I guess biggest mistake buying Buffet Buffets pass  Stayed Planet Hollywood first time walk around strip instead taking car everywhere go  guess really convenientonly because where hotel situated  Rooms pretty crappy buffet   Spice market buffet? Please stay away  dont know exactly much charge dinner but probably around less more $30 sure  worth your money  All selections just horrible  probably worst buffet ever including local buffets town instance Chinese buffets   Crab legs no flavor whatsoever  hard eat well  Most food selections all americanized just american food even though says Italian Asian  Why even need different sections because its unnecessary   Prime rib dry stiff ever  mussels clams dry chewy couldnt even eat them  mention lady server pretty rude well  asked extra silverware she just gave nonchalant look walked away without saying anything came back when? 1000000 minutes later  did want leave tips all  Only thing good iced tea   it  No kidding   Anyway things short wont your money's worth all  Please stay away  Just dont even bother buy Buffet Buffets pass  Just pay time fee Bacchanal buffet  probably best buffet vegas wont  sorry  <EOR> This more less favorite buffet Vegas alongside Carnival World Market buffet Rio   Spice Market Buffet most expensive nor least but provides excellent array variety food each dish very good   There more elaborate buffets such example Wynn but such buffets sometimes try present dishes such rack lamb just aren't suited mass quantity daily presentation fall short finest rack lamb say home restaurant     Spice Market doesn't try cannot well serves international foods America Italy Middle East Asia Mexico course including seafood soups salads desserts   pizza stone fire ovens     Lately implemented drink machine all drinks self service which fine actually no waiting everything available tap   It's currently $30 99 per person dinner daily 3pm 11pm $21 99 lunch M F 11am 3pm    hard find 10% $5  off coupons online liberal accepting such discounts   lines sometimes long peak dinner hours but usually bad   Certain categories Total Rewards cards jump line  <EOR> Went lunch  sea food stall some really amazing dishes  <EOR> With groupon well worth it!

Because staying Planet Hollywood lazy ate dinner then again breakfast   At dinner some food pretty good tandoori chicken seafood enchiladas barbecue ribs but most just ok   service decent but changed next day   At breakfast food again mixed quality   tri tip steak delicious potatoes good fruit decent most other stuff eggs pastries etc  ok   But service fucking awful waited 10 minutes before server took order when needed refill took good 15 minutes before server came by   when friend asked replace OJ because super watery he gave attitude told fresh squeezed OJ buffet which true    He dick maybe first time ever didn't leave tip all   Spice Market used regularly top list Vegas buffets but gone downhill expectations high   still decent but won't back awhile  <EOR> For $15 person breakfast you'd hard pressed buffet deal any major hotels Strip  food really good buffet why people always complain freshness? freakin' buffet idiots!

Come now  don't need crazy over drink order   Even though food isn't perfect enjoy coming because most food offer pretty good  also really love dessert bar  first time ate chocolate mousse best chocolate mousse ever had  keep coming back hoping again but luck always bad never seen since  Other pies offer   Overall Spice Market your typical Vegas buffet crowded overpriced  <EOR> Arrived early Sunday night   hardly anyone front line yet took FOREVER   Still don't took very little time pay when there  yes added tip    Then took somewhat forever again before someone seated us     Took off buffet seriously UNimpressed!
