Across land food being made large brightly colored trucks hardly vegetable seen   vegetarian girl wanders truck truck hoping find something tame hunger but she finds disappointment more often tasty meat free food   Until day beacon light shone bar led to Sausagefest   Ok may bit dramatic but hella tough veg girl some meat free food truck goods   imagine surprise when meat heavy Sausagefest truck showed Tenaya Creek Brewery served only veg friendly sausage but vegan one!  better yet two flavors!  So may just Field Roast vegan sausages but perfectly ok me   high quality full flavor ready take whatever toppings choose     My husband Tenaya Creek Special which Sage Apple sausage sauerkraut grilled onions grain mustard   regular version also comes bacon we course nixed cooked Tenaya Creek's Calico Brown Ale   sure if vegan version cooked beer since only took small bite try   very good but just never sauerkraut fan   I Smokey Robinson without bacon    spicy Chipotle sausage barbeque sauce grilled onions   also supposed cheese but think left off mine keep vegan which thought thoughtful   Since vegan pretty obsessed cheese think next time specifically ask them leave on   The bread sandwiches great nice doughy inside slight crust outside perfect holding all ingredients your sandwich place   Also fries great deal only $1 extra really tasty   only wish offered bigger containers ketchup   Don't worry meat eaters Sausagefest popular everyone saw should give them try too   The employees or owners? friendly food good veg friendly!
