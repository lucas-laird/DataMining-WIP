If enjoy defiling your body food buffet you   24 hours non stop artery clogging gluttony   If prefer quality life over quantity you  <EOR> I actually did way back September glad tried out   I'd say 5 stars value but minus 1 because wanted die afterwards  simply much food let tell eat!    lunch dinner breakfast   Lunch Harrah's  3 5 stars  Hostesses slow no line  WTF mate? food fine  Nothing stood out    Dinner Spice World Market  5 stars  loved it  good  Lots variety yummy! Very fresh  especially loved Mediterranean section    Breakfast Caesar's Palace  4 stars  Yes negative four  food? Where variety? Why every tray practically empty? Why did waste breakfast here? Seriously people tiny  Avoid plague    Do it! <EOR> Unfortunately stars only paris buffet  PH gone down considerably  Food tasteless don't crab legs  Flamingo's breakfast ok but eggs runny much selection  Paris delicious crepes crab legs pork chops  Dessert paris also very tasty  Service excellent Paris ok other 2 hotels  <EOR> My food sever must having bad day before comes work  He hardly comes around checking us  drinks empty almost entire time  No would recommend associates place  <EOR> Thanksgiving weekend Vegas stayed @ Rio   1  started Carnival Buffet @ Rio around 8pm 2  breakfast Villiage Buffet @ Paris 3  lunch Spice Market @ Planet Hollywood 4  another dinner before 8pm Villiage Buffet @ Paris  4 buffets 24hrs    Carnival Buffet gone way down quality but maintain good service  a lot food sure but nothing really stood crab legs very small waiting crazy   Villiage Buffet actually favorite  better quality crepe station excellent prime rib good  Spice market ok  middle eastern section interesting but taste very average overall  <EOR> I'm going spend all day writing   Ill just say GREAT DEAL!  Dinner did ceasars palace  very good   breakfast Paris! excellent!!!! Lunch planet hollywood  great   some best meals trip   def recommended!!! <EOR> Great price $59 99  tried Paris Harrahs Planet Hollywood   Flamingo closed dinner didn't Rio all wasn't going pay extra Caesars but before good   Paris buffet 3 times now great dinner but waited over 1 2 hr line 7pm weekend   Good selection foods  Harrah breakfast  they good spread self serve drink station   Server attentive nice   Lots dessert omelette bar   Ate Planet Hollywood last  atmosphere dark basement  Spread different but seemed good   Fun cotton candy dessert   Felt ill few hours though wasn't looking forward 7AM flight home   Best word advice  go around 7 8pm dinner breakfast lunch dinner any meals want between  <EOR> A lot variety  few need revamped  Spice market best  Paris close second  <EOR> I done deal twice I'd say worth it   For $50 eat many meals fit within 24 hours  Most people would probably able 2 3 meals within those 24 hours   Without buffet would cost anywhere $30 $60   I know some other yelp reviewers say eat fast time right but think long two meals you've received your money's worth  In way lot getting season pass amusement park  Even if three times whole year you've spent less would if bought three individual tickets well worth it   I've only chance Rio Paris buffets am absolutely satisfied   The Rio perhaps bigger two variety foods including pho wonton soup asian food craves   I say little disappointed Paris buffet  lot less food expected but if really love crepes dessert where go  Also service great people friendly   As tips recommend getting wristband late before closing more flexible schedule dinner next day   Also never late  Your wristband lasts until minute reaches 24 hours  remember last time wristband supposed expire 7 pm  boyfriend rushed Paris buffet only find super long line  6 59 but refused give customs desk left line told friendly lady desk wristband expire but I'd squeeze last meal  She smiled gave receipt two buffet told show cashier line receipt proceed line seated  I didn't want wait same line cashier where people waiting pay meal skipped front told girl showing people seats already receipt asked if she could seat me    She asked if everyone party already paid said yes she took boyfriend right in  So basically saved 45 minutes standing line managed squeeze meal minute spare   Also if happen walk past buffet while you're going your day strip buffet no line going feel free stop grab gelato cheesecake  Because can  there   I yet try other buffets list but heard Planet Hollywood superb  way great thing buffets most likely food like  Remember buffet eating much can give variety foods choose from  Don't food chose? pick another! wish more? some more!

We planned hitting Paris's Le Village Buffet breakfast Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet lunch Rio's Carnival World Buffet dinner but plans don't always pan perfectly   We checked Le Village Buffet right cusp breakfast into lunch best both worlds   highly recommend doing breakfast Paris because great selection bacon crispy crepes pretty damn good gotta nutella    reminded street vendor Paris    city is!    lunch wasn't bad either   prime rib juicy but other meats fried chicken pork little dry   MUST flans though because they're extra creamy totally delicious   Buffets quite filling actually didn't feel need stuff faces lunch   Unfortunately due some scheduling mishap couldn't hit Rio lunch ended back Paris   dinner selection nearly identical lunch weren't all impressed   time prime rib little drier     The next morning early enough money's worth hit Planet Hollywood   Standard breakfast stuff but nothing write home about   Nothing really stood me   just okay   I gave Buffet Buffets 4 stars 2 reasons    1 Paris' breakfast really quite good 2 pretty damn good deal   Vegas likelihood you'll hitting buffets quite high   Fork few extra bucks you'll 3 or more meals covered 24 hour period     One final thing though   end 24 hour period you'll sick buffets won't even funny! <EOR> Our favorite buffet Vegas!

This such amazing deal  pays itself 1 1 2 visits!  Once pass 24 hours eat Hotels chain which include Rio Harrah's Planet Hollywood Paris Imperial Palace Flamingo Caesars Palace maybe others can't recall  If sign free Total Rewards players card pass  also great bc put your card every time play slots points  Also every time book hotels accumulate points    Total each buffet $30 including tips all other fees  BoB pass $45 think pretty sweet deal!   The best time pass noon  Since 24 hrs where please you'll able eat lunch dinner breakfast next day lunch! Also change buffets    example if Flamingo lunch don't time any other buffets during lunch hours find like  did dinner once liked different things different buffets buffet hopping!  I recommend Rio World Buffet    amazing! Anything think     there! Also crab legs Imperial Palace pretty good since slower buffet wait fresh crab legs shorter  Harrah's also very decent brunch! Flamingo chocolate fountain!! I also hear Caesar's Palace amazing but personally never eaten there   Enjoy! <EOR> I would probably only able once life because person simply just can't eat much food!  The pass $49 95 total rewards card starting 11AM Sunday  Friday 11AM pass price additional $20 want wary pricing   If start 11AM Sunday great thing still Le Village Buffet Paris  drawback would wake extra early try squeeze more meal Monday morning   Bacchanal most insane surcharge  Sundays considered brunch certain time +$20 brunch +$25 dinner  listed prices aren't always correct prepared!  Also +$10 Rio Seafood buffet  don't think you're getting all 6 buffets flat price which would ultimate steal!!! If wasn't trying brunch Paris would probably start late dinner Day 1 Dinner Breakfast Lunch Dinner Day 2   No matter slice pass wasn't bad deal since earned admission 4 different spots but should really eating much?  Enjoy! <EOR> It's great deal but only if think ahead  $50 for non members could theoretically three meals full day another next day  just line early four meals each $25 $28 individually priced   valid 24 hours time purchase use seven locations  downside lines most likely long  Besides having wait line also risk invalidating your ticket if you're cutting close 24 hour deadline your last meal  Vegas 4th July weekend year unfortunately those did plan ahead when purchasing deal  ended eating only two meals lunch Flamingo dinner Caesar's Palace had rush airport catch early morning flight next day   wish more seats restaurants lines would shorter wait averaging 1 hour   But overall those things ought while Vegas least once  Just plan ahead your meal times  <EOR> Very good deal $54 99 24 hours if huge appetite!

If children and or plan your overeating experiences around other more important activities hassle sure 3 4 meals your money's worth   If all over again would only choose really awesome buffet pay binge  Also I'd rather buy groceries if kitchen your hotel eat fast food if budget   Then again now say done buffet buffets  Just wouldn't bother ever again  <EOR> Only reviewing Buffet Buffets pass individual buffets which reviewing individually just heads up     The pass when June   Now $39 99 $5 last month Total Rewards members think $44 99 non members but worth money way   The pass good 24 hours seven buffets including awesome Rio buffet   recommend getting around lunch lunch dinner breakfast then lunch or just brunch next day    Dinner works but if you're going clubbing shows might tough force yourself squeeze 3rd 4th meal   Best thing opposed eating monster everytime pace yourself out   don't feel forced your money's worth normally if shell $40 buffet   Definitely this   $40 breaks down almost 15 meal just don't forget give tip   Each time go   know means costs little more but honestly never knock wood bad service any buffets even though some food subpar which would always over alternative good food bad service    So again this   Maybe even if kids   Because even if just want dessert just nibble something better paying $40 once then $40 everytime   just sneak them cookie ice cream  <EOR> Lots choices   the food looks good but taste disappointment   try somewhere else   a very average buffet <EOR> If you're willing commit save money but overall found buffets gets into underwhelming  Also am fat fat man but still couldn't fourth meal 24 hours thought going die 3  biggest thing allows slightly cheaper access Ceasar's buffet but if you're going should probably just commit bingeing Romans reportedly did then eat day two while digests   All told wouldn't again  <EOR> Great deal!

We argued lady everyone total rewards told $20 $35 website said $30  She called manager duty come over he told $44 99 its pay elsewhere  He told other buffet within BOB  really pissed off even showed website Caesars he still didn't want honor price! Such bad management many misinformation around  should train staff provide correct information customer because basically lying when first purchased BOB Paris $20 additional fee factors why would buy pass!! If told $44 99 per head probably wouldn't buy it  Anyway since there's no point standing line occupying line stepped aside  immediately called customer service line provided Caesars palace website especially indicating call when any question holiday price  told CS July 4th weekend paid $74 99 pass much would need pay extra if want Bacchanal buffet  CS said $35 extra fee!! back talk lady cashier put phone speaker  asked CS same question she said $35! lady cashier immediately grabbed phone told CS $44 99  Haha So put down phone lady cashier immediately informed manager end honored price $35  The point money  point providing correct information customer train your staff!! if website didn't even say abt $44 99 why charging people extra! could just name own price whatever want which wrong!
