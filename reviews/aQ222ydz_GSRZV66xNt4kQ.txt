2 girlfriends recommended place all 3 went     made sure appetite when here      sushi mediocre     made TERRIBLE service      2 half hours because orders took 30 min come whether appetizers sushi     server's excuse because bar full    ? you're telling your main dining area which actually also pretty full should SUFFER just because bar full?????   **someone replied comment saying come Monday when busy    umm come different day even mediocre service? No thanks    <EOR> Just awesome traditional unique sushi!  Impeccable service great Saki menu items   Can't wait back! <EOR> Truthfully restaurant would rated 3 5 stars but service received chef moved back 4 stars   $55 omakase each    Started yellowtail sashimi very flavorful great start    then sashimi salad garlic ponzu okay item stood out   next black cod soy which split decision between love I    slimey texture while enjoyed it   i think good balance sweetness miso   the filet mignon decent but think bit spoiled steak hence might unfair judge its decent but something I'd eat again restuarant   the final dish came dish assorted nigiri sushi two pieces tuna roll end    think all dishes most disasppointing wasabi under fish nigiri bit heavy which would okay if fresh made wasabi Kagaya LA but wasn't therefore just overpowering addition sushi    The fish overall would rate around 3 5 since good tuna melts your mouth salmon should sweet without any other additional sauces flavoring hence why only received 3 5 stars fish      FOOD = 3 5 stars FOOD Service = 4 stars chefs definitely fun chit chat with    <EOR> Food pretty good  annoyed took over 30 mins spicy salmon mango roll  Asked cancel cause wanted leave wouldn't let said chef working it  Guess he fishing salmon <EOR> This place great sushi sushi chef great personality  Happy hour 1030pm 2am best deal going!
