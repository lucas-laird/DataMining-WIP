Probably   My experience Alex followed night Robuchon tough beat  However believe Alex came through  both different establishments each strengths  Alex Robuchon one Michelin star less but Yelp scale certainly deserves 5 stars   The service amazing  decor beautiful  tasting menu which exceptionally tasteful well put together  pairing wine following sommelier's advice spot on    If you've dined Michelin restaurants know expect  Alex deserves 2 stars but no more  didn't try anything which challenged imagination felt reinvented traditional flavors  would agree Michelin if you're paying any attention that regarding number stars   For those dine Alex cure Las Vegas hangover please yourself favor In n Out  <EOR> I can't believe 2 star Michelin rated restaurant  husband tasting menu felt better food restaurants aren't even rated  give 2 stars outstanding service as expected good desserts minus macaroons b c better ones McDonald's France!
