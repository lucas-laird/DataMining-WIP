No distinguishable flavors we couldn't even tell which which rice overcooked soggy flavorless   also didn't even receive some items ordered bone marrow     The only reason don't give 1 star because restaurant gorgeous    it  <EOR> Gorgeous restaurant ambiance decor view fountain! Fantastic place  Very elegant romantic!  Portions bit small but packed flavor  nice dinner before heading show   Among favorite places eat Las Vegas! <EOR> LOVED place!  eat again!  Fantastic view   Fantastic food some sushi lovers some all loved it!  A little expensive but worth every penny   We Vegas every year eat every time! <EOR> Very high end high end pricing   hosted customer very good   4 stars better but great spot very nice meal  <EOR> Me encanto el lugar  Placentero la comida buena  El ambiente agradable  El precio adecuado pero no es caro  Totalmente recomendable  <EOR> Had waldorf salad start few sushi rolls oysters  rolls aaaammmmzing oysters bit fishy i some spice oysters didn't anything    Atmosphere great  <EOR> I loved Wynn over ten years since first visited   But renovated rid many good restaurants such Boterro Society Cafe   Japanese restaurant also restaurants rid of   Their former Japanese restaurant OKADA much much better decor also menu   Mizumi if still regarded Japanese restaurant Decor became cheesy loud lack elegance   now looks Chinese restaurants   No elegance decor but just red everywhere   Sushi chefs wear red caps that warned something wrong     Don't take wrong  love red especially red decor Ancore lobby floor BEFORE renovated! It mystery why rid gorgeous red chandeliers many exquisite decor made Ancore special  Somehow painted everywhere white made them look cheap now      Anyway Sushi raw fish display didn't look impressive judging selections fresh looks  looked around checked Sushi plates tables decided pass raw fish time    We assigned best view sheet front waterfall maybe price pay   The food nothing wow creative exquisite   Kobe beef 2oz yes 2oz 20oz $110 especially disappointing despite high expectation because price wouldn't expect something totally amazing price portion?    I many Kobe beef before but most ordinary taste didn't even taste best most expensive one   We also ordered beef tartar fillet US beef good but nothing wow can't anywhere else!   Honestly Kobe beef didn't taste any better beef though more fat    They took long serve everything even though half empty 5 30 weekday  They also didn't care serve timing  ordered roll bowl rice came between meat dishes sat eating only rice half hour   We could ordered more but became full waited long between each dish  left full but weren't satisfied     Also Asian Sake pourer suit sommelier? didn't show courtesy all made feel uncomfortable is because didn't order most expensive Sake bottle wonder? Go somewhere else if want celebrate special occasion spend much money $300 two without tip   Just worth money   Generally Wynn Ancore renovation disappointing  Many nice things gone knockout gorgeous atmosphere   It's somehow downgraded now compared amazing before such shame    They should kept great restaurants decor rather spending money less    So sad truly loved Wynn Ancore for its uniquely gorgeous atmosphere couldn't find anywhere else  <EOR> Don't come budget conscious meal  If splurge food top notch    Five shared sushi platter four snow beef $100 5 tiny but heavenly slices Robata platter few rolls    The sushi extremly clean fresh  Uni amazing    Two days later am still craving meal  <EOR> Bottom line poor quality value less average food incredibly high price  If want good sushi Vegas somewhere else!  We salmon box sushi customized freshly made but tasted prepared earlier  rice cold just come refrigerator    We also salad dish chicken imitation meal promised great taste quinoa     tasted fake frozen meat you'd supermarket    We tried give waitress hints meal less satisfactory but she didn't seem care  <EOR> I really loved restaurant   thought food beautiful atmosphere tranquil   am also desert person but rice balls filled sorbet truly stunning   GREAT  <EOR> yes   omakazi please   think thats spelled wrong   but yes   good    = ill back sure <EOR> I read place various fb magazine newsfeeds  so researched yelp  also read executive chef hawaii  we people hawaii always support other fellow locals  my first time n ohh myyy decor inside beautiful! even great table waterfall! server she absolutely nice n super cool! Helpful explaining menu items  i ordered omakase  very happy did! Omgosh every dish beautiful n deeelicious! fav was   all it! alot restaurants n far place best! definitely back omakase again becuz server said changes  aaand course try other dishes!! Yummm! <EOR> Food amazing!  chefs sous chefs down praise them  Sadly dressed Trendy 100 degree resort but would allow table  understand dress codes BUT allowing men sweats white t shirt come seated???  guess $600 bill two wasn't good enough your establishment  Very disappointed treatment  told if change wouldn't hold reservation  Everyone really friends EXCEPT FOH manager  Shame return send anyone your way   Thank ruining anniversary dinner <EOR> We lovely view waterfall room beautiful   First star! The waiter professional nice! Second star  The food     Zero Stars! If really love appreciate Japanese food don't eat here  The essence Japanese food highlight quality ingredients prepare them excellently   done here   Just example hamachi collar prepared being baked rather grilled side burnt other side raw   really disgusting  I enjoyed setting but food  <EOR> Came quick dinner sat right breathtaking waterfall! definitely dream  loved all rolls ordered + cocktails  Everything fresh tasty    Great place  <EOR> With high expectations arrived Mizumi celebrate anniversary    We seated table beautiful view waterfall area server incredible  She attentive sweet definitely made anniversary dinner special    I researched menu advance also read through all Yelp reviews suggestions order  decided few different items both sushi robatayaki menus    We started Mizumi roll little disappointed  All ingredients sounded great together but taste didn't live expectation  just didn't taste fresh flavorful hoped  lobster little chewy but rest ingredients seemed point  fella raved roll having Mizumi before even he let down occasion  brussel sprouts good albeit little overdressed balsamic vinegar  still loved them  highlights ordered probably rice balls pork belly bacon wrapped enoki another roll I can't remember name life enjoyed lot more Mizumi roll  better versions elsewhere but very tasty  least favorite items sweet potatoes shishito peppers eggplant  rarely meet shishito pepper eggplant dish don't enjoy particularly disappointing me    We ended meal Mizumi mask dessert  low expectations since mostly ordered expecting good photo op over actually enjoying dessert  tasty but definitely nothing amazing  did wow factor far presentation though    Our anniversary great mostly due fantastic company excellent service but food just ok visit  am interested trying more menu options another time but I'd likely skip most ordered during dinner  no idea if just arrived off night but I'd likely give them another whirl future  <EOR> My love great time Mizumi  really appreciated accommodating staff chef Kosher needs request  very romantic vibes sexy! Thanks!!!!   Pricing expensive but sometimes must spoil themselves  <EOR> I good memories here  service always very pleasant  But can't sure food   <EOR> Yes really enjoyed sushi experience Mizumi when said Chef   omakase wa kudasai he took nice sushi experience   also some very nice Sake which enhanced meal  <EOR> We dinner Mizumi before Le Reve Dreams show Wynn Theatre   Got seated front beautiful man made waterfall very serine   Their sushi sashimi menu best around world knew try them   didn't disappoint all   Some exceptions were sweet shrimp Alaska plump firm sweet be favorite mirugai good if Tsukiji market many there  usually don't care salmon but exceptional Organic Wild Scotland ! must try some   Finally Albacore Sea Urchin best Santa Barbara's coast usual best be!!  My wife raw sashimi person yaki nigiri robatta yaki set all very tasty grill flavor aroma priceless  With going around world local boy Hawaii Head Chef Davin Hashimoto see doing very well although he off kid night compliments chef   If wasn't nephew Ryan mentioned classmate chef he dinners classmates previous night would've missed place   It made stay Wynn complete Would definitely come back again again! <EOR>
