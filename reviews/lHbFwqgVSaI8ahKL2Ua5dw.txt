Many Vietnamese restaurants frequented Vegas East Coast where am where far fresh  they provided often stale traditional foods while Americanized fair greasy very appetizing pretty typical    Vietnamese place does even offer Americanized dishes  offers simple Vietnamese cuisine  tastes delicious its simplicity variety still good enough food enthusiast first timer   The only slight draw back  the owners also servers especially lunch time  While very adept kitchen  yum  they speak much English can't always understand order  difficulty understanding them couple occasions  view major drawback think adds authenticity restaurant but someone else may   Overall great restaurant  am craving right now! <EOR>
