I meeting high school friend lunch  When she said deli originally skeptical unimpressed but when pleasantly surprised  I pot roast sandwich moist flavorful   sandwich chips loaded baked potatoes soup all good choices  What made day free soft serve mean many places free dessert?  It reasonably priced tasty staff delight   It isn't fine dining but comfortable school lunchroom feel kind place  It's Cheers Bar but Deli Style where everyone knows your name  <EOR> Was looking quick lunch wasn't fried food when Jason's location popped map sold  fan Jason's years extensive menu great salad bar always liked place lighter lunch    This Jason's located bottom corner office building clearly catering corporate America however if plan making trip don't work office building should know attached parking garage $3 half hour  would recommend walking another location if possible but sounded good paid park!  The interior resembles every other Jason's same decor layout  order counter salad bar drinks located more towards middle then plenty seating  probably 1 30pm time arrived Monday pretty dead but would imagine lot traffic during lunch hour businesses upstairs    Friendly staff working food par expect Jason's  tuna melt fruit side girlfriend ordered penne pasta marinara sauce meatballs  delivered penne pasta chicken white sauce but upon bringing attention apologetic kind replaced very quickly  A+ customer service    I'd recommend place if close want quick lunch! <EOR> If want quick lunch healthy filled calories place you   food always fresh try new pork tenderloin sandwiches   Super tasty healthier some other meats   staff always friendly most them recognize only handful visits   soups great larger variety most sandwich shops including chile chicken pot pie soup     They salad bar fresh ingredients even give free muffins crunchy garlic toast free all customers   soft serve ice cream also included your meal if dine in     The price reasonable portions just right  Goldilocks would pleased  big small  <EOR> Salad bar half empty rotten lettuce sandwich good but salad bar disgusting empty took literally 20 mins refill during peak lunch hours unacceptable <EOR> This favorite JD location  to go place everyday lunch FAR best  option downtown yes said it  Screw Le Thai Eat other hip places    healthy soup salad  nuts ice cream muffins    What really difference staff  Great customer service!
