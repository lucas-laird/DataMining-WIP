Really friendly staff well  <EOR> I've tried Joe's Philly several times received menu door few months ago  say better but decent place grab cheap quick lunch   I'm sure why called Joe's Philly's Pizza seems kind confusing  pizza? Philly Cheesesteak? didn't know Philadelphia known pizza   Anyway three visits ordered cheesesteak twice pretty good  eaten lot cheesesteak sandwiches life would say ranked somewhere middle lower spectrum  However lunch special comes fries fountain drink around $6  comment fries pretty soggy under salted  sandwich itself bad could use more meat cheese onions peppers  bread decent well   I've also gotten chicken wings  wings actually pretty good  best but definitely worst  amount buffalo sauce really varies  Sometimes they've smothered wings other times there's hardly any them  way think tastes just Jack's Hot Sauce just put if back again   The service pretty quick  usually your order within 10 minutes usually less   All all bad place but fairly mediocre  try pizza  if again  <EOR> Decided Joe's never been  food amazing! Great specials  Totally worth drive! only food great but service fantastic    Don't forget come won't lose  <EOR> Its month since last time ordered anything here  ordered 3 times month two then pretty much gave up  saw some really good reviews place excited thinking finally some good pizza  First time tried said myself ok maybe fluke  Second time kind same thing  Funny even tried third time uh well its good  There's nothing good place opinion  think almost impossible place single legit 5 star review  people seem very friendly over phone its venting over bad experience anything that  Its just food even really average  pizza wings cheesesteak  tried quite few things just hoping would least decent could convenient place order no luck  wont ordering again right now looking bunch 2 star reviews screen place really accurate  kind irritating think place 10+ reviews total all gave them 5 stars  single 4 less star review food really below average  cool  <EOR> Had take out pizza which just fantastic! amount sauces spices just perfect ingredients very fresh  can't rate pizza high enough great  <EOR> Super friendly welcoming  Smells delicious  wrong Philly pizza  Mmm mmm mmm  Bring on! <EOR> the delivery fine  calamari clearly frozen reheated mushrooms too  hawaiian pizza tasted    strange? dough dessert dough  also website lists hawaiian ham pineapple but fact ham pineapple bacon which would've fine if knew getting know liked bacon  feeling relieved also some desserts  boyfriend's chocolate cake chocolate loaf sunken quite stale  excited cheesecake but WOW tasted 10 years old absolutely no flavor  red sauce only describe tasting grenadine  yeah spit threw away  say though mountain dew EXCEPTIONAL  <EOR> Let just start off saying took them almost TWO HOURS deliver pizza chicken tenders when called update man said driver would house 5 minutes well 30 minutes later guy finally arrived nice cold pizza  Aside food no more alright  Please yourself favor DON'T ORDER PLACE  <EOR> The new owners remodelled nicely      However food decent before mediocre now least  Chicken Noodle soup broth sour fries fried beyond crisp  <EOR> One favorite pizza places town! If havn't already must try Armenian Pizza' Great place <EOR> I'd probably able rate order bit higher FRESH  order took almost hour half arrive  pizza cold hard calamari soggy couldn't even tell zeppoli zeppoli  called ask where order woman ordered seemed put asked stating driver left ten minutes previous  received order called again  Same woman  Bad attitude  offered send another order  Why would customer already waited way long want wait more? If pizza outstanding wait might worth it  average pizza  never order again  refunded $10 order  should refunded all money crap  Food worth it   UPDATE OWNER messaged called sir  Also saying phone  If phone gender would obvious  Also saying takes 40 minutes Sicilian pizza hope understand THAT  am stupid  am however Sicilian   said driver left soon pizza done  obvious lie because only takes 10 minutes damn store  pizza would cold  order liars  <EOR> Ate first last time ever eat there  all giving new small businesses chance but never again give place chance no wore gloves hair nets ended pulling hair food myself short hair medium length brown hair   Worst part already ate almost 2 slices before finding it  <EOR> They stay open super late night but unlike most places serve really good food  ordered philly cheese steak sandwich delicious! Beef tender thought saucy wasn't overwhelming  Hubby picky eater he gobbled philly up  Definitely recommended if ever area would come philly cheese again  <EOR> We love pizza place best las vegas  Eat hear few times month never let down <EOR> Meh  experienced better  sums experience place  few times tried couple different items pretty much same experience each time   The Goods Friendly service decent wings good crust sauce pizza    The Not So Goods It's kind hard pin point exactly wrong place  servers friendly but don't seem know can't done  Example ask small cup water replied times asked 1 Grab bottle water should fine  2 Sure here's cup use fountain  3 Ok give cup but sure fill soda   AND CHARGED FOUNTAIN SODA ANYWAY I didn't realize until paid     To continue lack consistency even though eat every single time often brought food already boxed if ordered pick delivery  time once ordered pizza server walked pizza box without any plates utensils you might ask why utensils   read later   least attempt cater towards your dine in visitors    Lets talk pizza  am major pizza enthusiast don't believe such thing bad pizza  But never more disappointed pie such long time   I tried supreme pizza outside crust sauce   everything such complete hope mess  just seemed threw numerous frozen vegetables then caked lot cheese top toppings assumed it   peppers onions weren't fully cooked toppings heavy could barely even hold slice without all cheese toppings falling off  why having utensils would nice least some pieces eat pizza cheese toppings bite   This pizza would somewhat passable if only delivered but if dining would expect some kind quality increase since pizza would generally fresher  severely question reviews say best pizza town  understand local establishment but doesn't mean should favorable reviews unfavorable flavors    Is better Digorno? Nope Is better Little Caesars? Sorry   but really  LC though but why would come place lower quality pizza double price LC $8 supreme ?  Despite fact some other food decent mainly wings place heavy weight pizza itself  really wanted great place but #soniamdissapoint   It just seems cusp making damn good pizza hopefully take actual criticism proper adjustments  If anyone wondering why am critical pizza because pizzeria   #idonotproofreadsomyreviewsmightsoundlikegibberish <EOR> This pizza stood test Las Vegas' time f today gone tomorrow  many chain restaurants pushed small businesses Joe Philly's since first time moved vegas early 90's just good now then if better!!! <EOR> Just Ordered hawaiian pizza   still warm delicious   Also ordered cheeseburger  which also hot delicious    definitely ordering   pizza better pizza Hut dominoes    fries fail  But everything else just right   Didn't exceed expectations but definitely met them    <EOR> I only give place star based delivery late night  Wouldn't think busy mess 4am!!  don't answer calls took 2hours deliver 2miles    when food came cold hell! ate half sandwich tried fries  couldn't even eat them! total waste money food  ugh waste time appetite  ordered Philly cheese sandwich never again wouldn't recommend place anyone let alone delivery service customer support! called billion times when answer led said food cooking  Then took another hour    take hardly ever complain  Don't waste your money somewhere else  Trust me  $20 seriously <EOR> Wish could rate food but place cancelled grubhub order no explanation hour placed  <EOR> We stopped slice way back hotel just ok   lived Philly 6 years some great pizza place kind disappointing night   staff very friendly helpful acted bothering them     I guess being open later then some places lot people wondering since people tend order something don't way friendly helpful   The pizza more dough then pizza almost eating pretzel sauce it   ordered sausage slice very generous sausage mostly cheese slice but sausage price   I would back place when Philly again way many pizza places return one   also could just staff particular night its hard say   best suggestion give stop grab slice post review   Maybe just hit them off night which happens  <EOR> This place off chain  don't why less STARS    I'm new Vegas  looking good pizzeria  also love Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches  But damn place Philly cheese steak pizza  Ohf  Def try out   So ordered online waited only bit    30 min roughly just any other pizza deliveries  think name Mike totally forgot name Big chunky dude  Guy super nice AF    He rolled gave meal    He heads in    damn pizza legit    ate whole thing sitting    Along chocolate cake ordered it    also filling AF    Ohf  Y'all just gotta try out  Rec'd top  <EOR> I only two slices pepperoni lunch but excellent   Awesome tasting thin crust great chew nice amount toppings plenty sauce   Very good  <EOR> Extra!
