Apparently request less didn't know either  Flavor wise dish really good  Good depth flavor savory spicy numbing  Next come cumin lamb  lamb different other places uses  Thicker slices lamb which very fatty juicy  bit lacking cumin flavor  Would preferred more cumin flavor  peppers used pretty spicy well  Maybe request more cumin used xD   Last stir fried water spinach ong choy   Learned something new recently  Never knew ong choy called water spinach  dont think use water version  don't really know explain but know family tends ask if its water grown   guess other type might soil grown? DONT KNOW ! But know water version tubes much larger normal version type youd see super markets   water type tends more tender lighter color vs other type which requires some more picking  Flavor good overall  Fermented soybean popular style cook in  Wished garlic sliced thai chilis XD   Overall all items really tasty  hope bring family soon  family loves eat spicy foods having tried almost all other similar style restaurants town   Unfortunately due unforeseen events believe permanently closed due fire furniture store next door  did well dishes  <EOR> I love place!
