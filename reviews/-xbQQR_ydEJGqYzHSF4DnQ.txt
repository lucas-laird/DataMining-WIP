When check charged $21 49 pizza  conversation Marinka something $3 extra deep dish bc requires more dough Where does say menu? hold on    Minutes later    manager decided refund $3 back HAHA   FAIL   Pizza delicious! 8 slices medium  Very cheesy  Crispy crust but bit wet inside  Less pineapples expected  Needs toppings less cheese  small bits ham  IMO flavor Round Table Maui Zaui better  6 slices to go decided weigh home  4lbs! Amazing! Heavy  haha <EOR> My husband works nearby met lunch   prices pretty good   complimentary parmesan breadsticks real treat!  pizza just OK and know say all reviews but think only fair mention NY'er born bred pizza  just OK sometimes incredible others      The service fine but waiter attentive I'd liked I really don't ask water refills especially lunch time when busy but admit little nitpick y service      Overall I'd say good neighborhood restaurant lunch probably even dinner but wouldn't send people way   wanted give place 3 5 stars but since even felt should bump down 3 instead 4 if means anything  <EOR> WTF lower average reviews?!? ate Tuesday evening   ordered deep dish calamari Caesar salad  free breadsticks  food good! Tasty! Deep dish cheesey!! deep dish NYC yes better but come Vegas! Lol! used groupon total $11 change so spent $24 all food groupon   would come back   service good too!  Good place take date quiet dinner  <EOR> Just ordered delivery because live right down street it   never again would rather drive somewhere GOOD pizza  small thin crust margherita works deep dish order jalapeno poppers   honestly all disappointment  Everything lacked flavor dough undercooked no crisp  <EOR> The pizza okay   Nothing amazing notable   I personally don't mind breadsticks  deep fried different other places  If leave them long gross chewy  They're best fresh  Especially marinara  My favorite thing order fruti de mare  seafood cooked perfectly linguine al dente  Their wine awesome price too! The Alfredo seemed little flour tasting  very appetizing but boyfriend seems order every time he in  Maybe just ordered bad day  Small restaurant which typically always short staffed  night hour before closing seemed 5 other parties came afterwards  felt really bad waitress told she literally told other waitress home early because slow prior crowd coming in   cut some slack but said they're practically always short staffed  Nice staff but definitely short staffed  Haha <EOR> As someone eaten often say quality just isn't anymore  Nor customer service   We ordered pizza pickup when home   wow  supposed half half but more 1 4 3 4 All sauce side pizza side just toppings swimming sauce instead baked into cheese  top having usually wait 30 min pizza took almost hour  top all when decided actually eat 1  half thickness usually 2  wasn't even cooked all way through cold  Nothing waiting forever inedible food! paying amount food aren't even receiving    When contacted restaurant asked manager snottiest person ever talked to  He only referred himself manager ever sure talking too  He assured he PERSONALLY made pizza mistaken only half half but everything else well  Guess eyes liars! Sad say all because used favorite pizza place authentic Chicago style pizza  Now search another  little customer service long way lost loyal customer over it   Oh did end getting refund hour half later but take pizza back so much having evening in ended little caesars which sadly million times better this  hell lot cheaper    Save your money folks find another restaurant  <EOR> I pizza numerous times eaten other food restaurant once  First things first    Chicago Style pizza always amazing   tried few but vegetarian favorite    Now only negative service strange sometimes pizza isn't ready another 10 20 minutes initial estimate  Also employees heard arguing each other back usually when pizza isn't ready time    Overall place great back again again  <EOR> Best pizza town when comes wanting something resemble midwestern pizza   Thin crust meat lovers good   tiramusu good but more custard then really should be     The service difficult usually just delivered no problems   recently just moved wished place closer   They also great coupons $10 off $30 which great   usually order 2 pizzas fridge right away leftovers because good  <EOR> There certainly no lack good Italian places Las Vegas but only few blocks house decided give try   Bring your appetite you!  If you're eating start off complimentary breadsticks which fried pizza dough flavored garlic sprinkled parmesan cheese top   Delicious! If you're really hungry deep dish pizza good slice enough fill up!  ordered meat classic deep dish plenty meat toppings but favorite thick layer chunky tomato sauce top  tried thin crust pizza chicken parmesan balsamic chicken panini which all delicious   Service great times refilled drinks without having ask   since gone back more! <EOR> It shame see place closed  come few times enjoyed getting pizza well some other dishes  I know time chicken Marsala another time Chicken Parm Won't forget authentic place portions amazing!! Another time eggplant parm Cheese Heaven!  Very good food good service! The owners very nice!

Ordered Kid's pizza pepperoni bacon Calamari Chicken Caesar Salad Tiramisu Canoli  Kid's Pizza $7 49 Pretty good being kids pizza  6 8 slices thin crust flavorful    Calamari $6 99 I'm no expert calamari SHOULD taste but calamari really really fishy tasting  being takeout remained crispy opinion lot more would San Gennaro Olive Garden lot less money  sauce awesome  recommend   Chicken Caesar Salad Small $7 48 Enough feed 2 bulimic people! Holy crap much salad  fresh! chicken breaded very flavorful chopped into tiny little cubes which weird  croutons phenomenal lots flavor  dressing Caesar tasted home made anchovy based little oily  also covered powdered parm cheese  Overall just okay    Tiramisu $4 99 Tiny! $5 really really small piece  espresso taste overwhelming sure if sauce drizzled top but way strong  Probably why writing review right now pretty wired  wouldn't recommend if love traditional tasting tiramisu   Canoli $5 99 AMAZING! 2 canolis they're pretty good size  They're covered powdered cinnamon over stuffed cream  actual canoli tastes puff pastry really fresh hard  recommend   The service! After ordering online called sure through okay add desserts because forgot them check out  girl answered phone seemed pleasant but really confused  She confirmed order but stated driver already left  submitted order 2 minutes before called lol  She apologized mix added desserts but didn't tell new total  Originally $21 some change when driver showed $33 change  Whatever! delivery guy shows hands food takes money leaves  He pretty nice except he forgot desserts!! starting think wasn't supposed them call back girl answered different earlier answers phone Maciano's please hold   say okay but she didn't hear because already hold  5 minutes later she picks phone sorry we're closed  9 40 supposedly website say close 11 00pm Fridays  say WAIT! because thought she going hang without hearing out  explain driver forgot desserts she puts another hold picks phone back says he's way back   it  No apology anything  driver returns hands desserts offers shut door he sees struggling dog bag  Oh he apologized Overall food OK  Service could better  Desserts bit over priced but is  I'd order pizzas instead miscellaneous stuff might taste better  <EOR> First off would've given them four stars because love food longtime customers  But time around just two many fouls post review  recently posted large banner advertising 20% off carryout ad delivery  very proud aggressive move assume gain more business yet when called asked girl answered happily suddenly changed tones if told just ran over dog  reluctant yes still offer discount gave order she gave total  surprised when receipt see gave whopping $3 00 off  would mathematically correct if ordered $15 00 worth food but sadly did not  ordered $28 00 worth  wanting add sour taste mouth right before eating dinner didn't say anything but screw $3 00 off   bright side probably save way more eating again  thanks girl gave measley discount under guise knew math obvious disappointment could read giant 20% off sign hanging over door   You'd think discount coming straight own pocket  Well just case is      owe three more dollars!!! <EOR> Fried breadsticks?
