Chipotle   speaks itself   freaking good   pork burrito bowl but every now again hankering carbs all burrito   There's whole lot say other fresh made honest goodness Mexican albeit mexican american food   appreciate they're consistently good   many times never anything wasn't fresh didn't taste great   restaurant always kept clean never location when busy   Never   employees for most part anyway friendly good job getting orders quickly accurately    I don't buy into hype Chipotle awful place eat because all bad press they've gotten over illness some people suffered eating there   Geez if swore off every food establishment made someone sick I'd eating home rest life   would review Yelp?   Chipotle   Fresh   Fast   Satisfying    all  <EOR> Very nice employees good quality food dining area usually very clean  I've never any problems them being ingredients anything that  The food good everything always prepared just way want it  Down side shopping center absolute WORST  parking sucks people rude you're lucky without nearly getting car accident lol  <EOR> Just rest except always crowded along added bonus  few times walked theres always cops location  said am always getting dirty looks them  just avoid location because that  shouldn't feel uncomfortable going somewhere all  <EOR> This probably worst Chipotle Vegas  Every now then might lucky actually good bowl burrito them but hardly ever  usually only eat if area really want Chipotle but rather drive further knowing better outcome then one  <EOR> Finally! chipotle East side  love chipotle but tops many to  all occasions never stingy portions  always ask extra hot sauce corn truly give extra  Restaurant always clean workers work fast paste  would definitely come back  <EOR> Chipotle life!

Also restaurant smallest Chipotle's well  eaten taken good enough return multiple occasions  <EOR> This far worst chipotle ever too  Terrible customer service  Terrible workers  didnt even know wrap burrito  terrible never coming again! <EOR> I love chipotle! But location  vegetarian salad every time   Typically when no meat give extra rice beans  location bottom barrel half scoop each  Seriously just because vegetarian doesn't mean hungry ! Next ordered boyfriend burrito brown rice steak going wait? Isn't point chipotle getting your food timely manner? annoying  If know dinner time don't think would prepared  But wasn't even busy  Wonder why? <EOR> I love customer service store always clean food great  just want tell employees Chipotle keep great work your food awesome  always challenges Vegas Restaurants awesome friendly  Thank awesome service  <EOR> Went yesterday husband lunch  service fast employees polite  BUT food husband nauseous vomiting sick rest day  never eat again! food little expensive making people sick  wish could find receipt money back  20 dollars down drain toilet  <EOR> I haven't even left parking lot yet  made upset  love chipotle maybe just used California hospitality but location sucks customer service  When walk see 3 employees table gentleman ahead questions employee happy help him  other ran back  Well he lot questions while waiting same employees could helped line decided stay peek around corner stare instead helping  Then when employee called cash register person   took good 3 minutes employee stop ignoring come help  know plenty people looking work maybe chipotle needs clean house location    Also come home find store bought chips instead chips love  Big fail  <EOR> Watching someone break proper food safety practices right front utterly ridiculous!   As making way front line noticed lobby fairly empty line order food big  2 servers helping patrons build burritos bowls  third individual handling some chemicals right bathroom area  ladies serving food asked lady cleaning bathroom please some lettuce nothing wrong right?! Except rather wash hands she walked straight into walk refrigerator large hotel pan full lettuce then proceeds leave right next stove instead placing temperature controlled food area  All while she rubbing nose starts handle money  Apparently then dons maybe she should wear gloves  She grabs pair box attempts put them handling them putting them she puts them back box continues work!! Let just contaminate rest work area!  Suffice say never coming here  <EOR> I walked ordered white rice girl helping gave brown rice she clearly new she seemed somewhat nervous   Then grilled veggies cook came grill more  He said would take 6 minutes  He started right away manager shift apologized gave free bowl we ordered 2 I am giving them 5 stars because thought really nice thing them since wait little which really didn't mind  <EOR> It's while since came chipotle today reminded why  came ordered food girl saw first nice steak looked bit old serving didn't say anything since really busy  come pay explained sister paying separate brother together cashier just stares blankly if stupid didn't say correctly ahead corrected me  sister ahead sit down came back told ask green Tabasco sauce because wants any asked same girl just stares say yes look sodas giving look if stupid something told no ! sister just came tell me  just stared didn't say anything walked away  When came sit down she see right wasn't any ! she just stared down walked away  Later she came two new bottles  chips stale WAY SALTY!!! <EOR> Today son visited chipotle around 215 pm well when still cooking few item wait son order but order hold due lack food  done but ok waiting giving fact all food gonna fresh well manager BRYAN saw waiting food asked if helped told yes still waiting food done cooking waiting only around 6 min but super hungry felt all eternity stomach LONG STORY SHORT FINALLY DONE SINCE WAITED BRYAN TOLD HE SUPER SORRY APOLOGIZED WAIT GAVE MEAL FREE  shocked thanked he told sorry again wait your lunch thanks chipotle happy customer here!! <EOR> Went last Friday guac  service excellent tho carnitas burrito bowl instead!
