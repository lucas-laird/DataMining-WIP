Really?? store same parking lot SMITHS Grocery lazy UNEMPOWERED employees can't take five'r over buy few avocado's peoples sandwiches???  Subway needs look policies training allow people able satisfy customer's needs    Adios!! <EOR> A very dirty place  watch employees picking gunk between bins fingers then watch them your sandwich while wearing same gloves  Another customer said something changing gloves he ignored  walked never back  <EOR> They good sandwiches don't skimp but really need turn open sign mornings   <EOR> Worst subway any visited  many years eating subway all over country even England once  2 bad experiences location  year ago no bread  claimed ran out  F does subway run bread  literally main item  2nd bad experience 2 days ago  stale bread  Again bread main item   serve stale bread? really suck job!  would avoid location any other location  <EOR> I love subway usually Cheyenne but discovered way grocery store  always annoyed lack products other location tried out   The employees very friendly chatty didn't repeat myself  all products fully stocked actually AVACADO!!!!
