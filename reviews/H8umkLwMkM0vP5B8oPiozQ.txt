patron bad experience  whole meal should removed bill  When restaurant first opened many years ago long wait times but food service great  NO LONGER CASE  save yourself some time money stomach ache avoid Sundance Grill Silverton  <EOR> Clean contemporary open feel friendly service typical american coffee shop burgers sandwiches plates around $10 20 per person  tried chicken noodle soup turkey club sandwich burger which all decent tasty but memorable  fries thin shoestrings which tasty generous portion provided accept silverton points payment which ended here  2 5 stars <EOR> My husband breakfast morning  sure if having off day but meal good  water weird taste hash browns soaked grease but crispy  seemed cooked them very low temp  Eggs good sausage not  husband fruit yogurt granola bowl delicious  Service very good  <EOR> I've probably 20 times there's bit learning curve when comes food service get   Most recently came fiancee around 5 30 AM unfortunately late cheap late night menu but food still good price regardless   Even nobody else waiting seated took minute two before someone noticed should seat us   least 2 servers around only 3 other tables when seated took quite bit time drinks them take order etc   My fiancee eggs awful sausage great while burger fries   asked double checked burger would plain but when clear cook put everything then scraped off he wouldn't over again   clear mean still some lettuce plate burger   asked remade server told them strangely enough back 1 minute later  yes literally just scraped remaining lettuce off served same burger   again asked actually remade finally did   Amongst all ended getting old lukewarm unsalted fries 99% time fries die but guess decided fuck because messed wouldn't let them take short cut making order properly    Additionally when preparing order first time started eggs burger same time fiancee's plate sitting window 10 minutes getting cold while mine finished     It ended correct burger 5+ minutes fiancee finished eating   Normally would just give place 1 star service bad but because actually having good experiences before give 2   If want some tips try eat counter service usually pretty good   Pastas burgers breakfast sandwiches all pretty good   I'd suggest staying away pizza  <EOR> I am gluten free due allergy  restaurant advertises gluten free menu thru staff if asked hotel  grill

wanted take advantage BOGO deal going breakfast  basics bacon eggs coffee  Everything good except house potatoes whatever called more dry hard cold chips  sour dough great food served quickly  service hit miss here  come other occasions enjoyed other meals too  ham steak eggs ginormous  Prices also reasonable free offer paid $10 70 breakfast! <EOR> Food actually pretty good   come quite few times mere fact always seems only restaurant open Silverton Casino   enjoyed hamburgers shrimp cocktails breakfast   Service so so don't fact pay your bill cashier   However food great usually accommodate large parties plenty booths good conversation noisy  <EOR> The food okay when December 2016 during NFR  ordered Philly cheesesteak which pretty good although meat awful dry figuring safe bet compared choosing seafood middle desert  WRONG  long spent worst 5 hours life some nasty food poisoning could only link dinner eaten really anything several hours prior  Personally most likely eat again thanks experience but say staff very amicable prompt  But check your meat before eat! <EOR> This your average casino cafe open 24 hours     They large menu includes breakfast items steaks sandwiches salads asian desserts   menu could use more vegetarian healthy options though   portions also large pretty good value   The quality food itself average occasionally below average   Fish chips left fryer long stale fries etc   biggest drag its ratings however service   servers friendly working hard but always no matter time day seemed understaffed   Everyone seems running around headless chickens   drinks remain unfilled while sometimes your order takes forever brought out   The Sundance Grill just your average all night casino cafe serving diner type food unfortunately really lacks service  <EOR> I eat every time Las Vegas  food always good time issue chicken undercooked took care immediately  service real problem  very hit miss  best service worst service here  past week worst service ever Sundance  server clearly didn't know going on  He confused everything but he trying give credit that  breakfast before checked usual breakfast burrito  solid choice  dad omelette forget called but basically western omelette  came choice meat bacon sausage ham  When he ordered sausage waiter beyond confused  clearly states choice meat but dad point menu  burrito comes good but left off sour cream salsa  usually plate  dad starts eating breakfast anger minute he realizes forgot sausage  When server comes he didn't know saying  really annoying  eat head casino while dad waits sausage show up  done playing he's paying counter  walk he's talking cashier because charged sausage  She bit attitude  saw when came she told couple front wait front while she set table  None could figure why needed wait but whatever  She asked dad which did have? don't know mattered which he actually ate if wrong wrong  She manager remove charge  eating when stay strip come meal  food real good I'd give 5 stars but service varied never know get  <EOR> 4 Stars Food 2 Stars Service  I eaten 3 times every time worst service    Here's today's experience   initially seated asked want drink   Drink arrives fairly quick ask question What's Soup Day    Waitress responds she doesn't know ask someone else   Another waitress arrives ask wanted order   asked minute which means come back 5 minutes   doesn't mean ignore next 15 minutes while chit chat another guest   waitress must noticed beginning wait impatiently   She arrived table asked if ready   responded yes she immediately said she'd back  ???????  Finally came back took order   Country Fried Steak Eggs Hash Browns Biscuit Gravy   Eggs bit runny but rest food perfect   Portions price good   Big portions fairly cheap   Besides eggs food always fresh     It always seems take some time them take your order here   Happened all three times here   But food almost it  <EOR> Sorry say but place really starting slip  Both service food quality  eaten approximately 3 6 times month last 3 4 times disappointment  prime rib which always favorite both smaller usual more fat usual  Most food still descent best but service leaves much desired  Being busy understandable but ignore customer simple glass water while wait order taken unacceptable  seems regular occurrence now  Very sad considering once great spot nice meal affordable price while feeling bring some value place  sure if new management understaffing but something definitely change better  <EOR> Came first night town dinner  weren't busy decided come instead having wait busier restaurant  Huge mistake! sat almost immediately menus everything seemed would okay  took 20 mins waitress even come over take order  Mind only 4 other tables being occupied  Food wasn't great just your average food  Step service place might okay  <EOR> I love place!  They recently updated menu format changed few things    We had grilled salmon spinach salad quesadilla no chicken garlic shrimp pasta chicken penne pasta tomato basil pizza  Everything DELICIOUS!   Salmon salad good! Fresh flavorful somewhat healthy  salmon fillet large    Quesadilla great starter came pico de gallo salsa sour cream  Everything fresh    Garlic shrimp pasta tasty but oily   Shrimp could've fresher but still good    My boyfriend liked chicken penne pasta but he thought garlic shrimp pasta better   Pizza AMAZING always  fire brick pizza oven thing which cook pizzas in    Our server very sweet friendly    Overall very impressed food quality casino coffee shop  coming back!  The ice cream gelato stand front great well  2 scoops $3! <EOR> I Grill several occasions over years  Service usually slow but food always decent such Fish Chips  We back Las Vegas winter thought some fish chips some gambling   Well didn't happen  Showed today around 1 30 p m  three couples front hostess seated first couple  Then stood waiting waiting  Meanwhile cashier having heated discussion another employee manager walks frowning whole time asks cashier question looks line people waiting walked off    hostess returns takes second couple  Then wait wait then manager walks cashier other employee still deep discussion asks something again still frowning looks line again walks away   Meanwhile cashier gets some customers ring employee keeps griping cashier whole time she helping guests  Meanwhile still waiting missing hostess return  Then manager walks asks people front many he says 2 he hands them beeper says 15 minutes    Then looks say 2 he then says 15 minutes  husband said already waiting 15 minutes reply manager looks waiting another 15 minutes   What no apology no nothing just sour look face he just ate lemon  told really enjoyed show two employee's walked off   We left casino without playing any machines Burger across street  Then South Point play  <EOR> I always turkey burger GREAT way but lately craving big American breakfast plus stack pancakes EXCELLENT <EOR> One star saying alot   am frequent customer because comps gaming but quite frankly cannot bring myself back   few weeks ago Saturday night alone sitting counter   10PM ordered shrimp linguine   waiting 45 minutes said something server   She said busy but shrimp fire   15 minutes later still no food   Then some friends came moved table ordered food food finally arrived   no linguine only over cooked spaghetti few overcooked shrimp no garlic bread   Well past Saturday night again ordered Jumbo Shrimp cocktail start   ordering waiter came over say shrimp would few minutes before cooked more   Then waiter comes table plate worst looking shrimp which below par buffet ones promptly told bring them back no way would pay $11 that   10 minutes later waiter comes back table version Jumbo Shrimp warm very good   insulted would even serve high level player casino   informed manager when paid bill never should served shrimp he politely said he knew   If he knew why served me?  Bottom line comp isn't even worth it!!!  Service OK but rest meal including rib eye which ordered medium came barely cooked awful   did send steak back because point meal thought just take home eat tomorrow  <EOR> I used cafe but last visit wasn't good very disappointed food   My calamari greasy bread sandwich dried looked old  <EOR> Compared customer service buffet place pretty crappy! literally ignore when walk seated just walk around you're alive  rude! food pretty bland  tried chicken Parmesan probably best pasta  chicken Alfredo no salt no flavor maybe 5 pieces dry chicken breast  W sitting bar seating waiting 40 min omelet mom ordered eggs     only but always say 15 20 regular seating when even FULL  plethora empty seats  When paying cashier took extra 10 minutes because gave hotel player club member wrong price bill he upset he said continue give wrong price he going pay exactly bill  manager immediately said she going call security  horrible my Opinion manager supposed diffuse resolve upset customer  jump calling security just walk off      odd  <EOR> I'll follow others say typical casino cafe  nothing special other fact open late served pizza or flatbread    ordered two both decent   daughter ordered banana split huge!
