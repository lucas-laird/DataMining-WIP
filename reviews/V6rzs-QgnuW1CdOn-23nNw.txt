C'mon  wouldn't find until next day when decided check but still selling same coupon  Why wanted cause such issue wait because employees aren't trained properly beyond me  attitudes changed much over simple coupon made seriously reconsider ever coming back   But while standing around counter waiting finally pay food witnessed lady waited assumedly cook meal prepare food way break health code violation  She answering phones taking orders touching computer making food all same time  Never once washed hands then even put pen pad right same prep station catfish on    Since didn't sick die hope food different 2 stars likely generous but won't back now sure  <EOR> I've twice both times food perfect  cat fish fresh perfectly cooked  mashed potatoes real chunks real potatoes mash  owners employees friendly obviously dedicated cooking good food  south saying when find good food want home slap mema making   good! <EOR> Order counter take seat dining room watch tv    I ordered 3 piece chicken tender red beans rice macaroni cheese drink $8 already feeling pretty pleased    The chicken incredibly tender perfectly fried though needed bit salt  Served ranch   Red Beans Rice PERFECT  Home style red beans made just right   Macaroni cheese homestyle well    The chicken portion huge truly need more 3 piece  Hell add additional side share someone  tenders almost size full chicken breast  <EOR> Ate few days ago very impressed service meal  new Vegas craving fried shrimp but couldn't find place  came across yelp decided give reading reviews  must say definitely live positive things being said them  boyfriend recognized moment walked given menus sent open table  orders taken timely manner when food arrived freshly cooked steaming hot  fried shrimp swai fish delicious  well red beans rice potato salad  place definitely being seeing again soon near future  <EOR> great food! seriously full everything homemade scratch cooked order  Owners used own uncle bens bbq watch best city  Definitely recommended! <EOR> When walk doors unassuming hidden gem feel transported deep south kitchen   The staff very friendly authentic   explained family could take seat wherever would would right us   server friendly helpful     I enjoyed 3 piece fried fish greens mac cheese   wife shrimp Po Boy mashed potatoes daughter enjoyed kids fried shrimp   The prices extremely reasonable portion size very large   I tell best fried fish Las Vegas   wife couldn't stop talking good shrimp Po Boy daughter loved meal   collared greens best ever had   Yes best ever   Mac Cheese decent but nothing special   mashed potatoes gravy unlike anything ever had   unique fish fry taste nothing short spectacular    When back very soon 3 piece fish again greens potatoes   always consume very large portion food very satisfied 3 piece fish   huge!

Huh! Also ordered collard greens instead simply telling which seems happening more more late simply added more mac cheese without informing us  bottom line if catch them food great  Just don't surprised if food advertised isn't available staff yelling each other if owner bails early beer! <EOR> The food  absolutely fantastic! !  fried chicken wings  greens French fries  chicken hot fresh full size wings   greens taste just back home Chicago style   atmosphere great customer service too  price variety food excellent value   most definitely back again when visit Vegas! <EOR> This place amazing boyfriend really enjoyed food  staff very friendly  definitely back!!!!! <EOR> Delicious Greens!

Spoke employee phone missing items! told off sworn at! support small local establishments but never EVER recommend Place anyone ever again! <EOR> If could give restaurant minus 5 would  most unprofessionally run restaurants town  eaten take out many occasions every time issues    It takes several attempts them even pick phone   then much attitude  call told pick time u still wait least 15 minutes   and your order most probably incorrect  If call food catered forget even called  then attitude if your fault  boast catering say deliver but probably call come pick anyway   There no staff wait staff gives attitude if doing them favor  Well customers doing favor  First all never seen more wait person anytime  Tables bussed properly ask drink cup  because come in  few cooks seem overwhelmed every time there   last time waiting takeout waited hour even started order then acted issue    I think sad decent professionally run southern style restaurant area  If restaurant decent location trained managers may succeed but last being run is    Due last experience never back! <EOR> Update earlier review  contacted restaurant tainted food wife ate last Tuesday before Christmas  person answered phone could sounded less sympathetic he told manager call back around 2pm  Saturday well called back sure enough no manager no owner duty!
