Banquettes dark wood walls give comfortable conversation friendly atmosphere  Lighting subdued but dark  Banquettes very popular should reserved  enjoyed Mayors Banquette   Our server Leo spot throughout dining experience  menu many choices land sea  entree choice night meat  starter delicious serving Escargot  Six plump morsels savory garlic butter sauce  dinner rolls perfect soaking excess garlic butter   Both entrees 8 oz petite filets perfectly cooked requested well done medium rare  Tender juicy results  shared twice baked potato provided carbs  dessert menu tempting but overruled due lack room but always next time  <EOR> MA$$IVE DI$APPOINTMENT   I've Golden Steer half dozen times  Last night first time  6 years  retro old school Vegas vibe  Unfortunately  all going now   Last night such tacky mediocre experience when dinner two $384 just awful  waiters all very friendly meat good but it  plaque front entrance stating proper dress required  can't imagine where draw line  room plenty men T shirts foam trucker hats women dressed belonged guy foam trucker hat  first chair husband sat shot seat cushion collapsed   room nice dim atmosphere continuously ruined large families plenty young children phones taking flash photos tables filming everything phone's  light on  such dim room very annoying   room swarming busboys waiters oversized ill fitting black jackets  don't think ever seen high staff customer ratio  Unfortunately service still slow lackluster best  remind them drink order refill wine glasses    We started table side caesar salad two  Instead being prepared wooden bowl rubbed garlic prepared large pebble finished translucent plastic bowl you'd see ice cheap salad bar   bowl big plastic salad spoons created loud annoying clapping sound    didn't want watch just wanted end  salad fine but table side presentation just bore best   Chateaubriand which came lots veggies also ordered two lobster tails  meat fine  accompanying hollandaise bearnaise sauces already coagulating little stainless gravy boats  asparagus under cooked totally void any seasoning broccoli nearly raw equally bland carrots cooked mush again no sign seasoning  Think hospital food  waiter asked food told bad veggies were  He kind shrugged said they're just steamed  Whatever  They're just horrible   lobster tails $75 each dry chewy side  horrible but no means excellent   bottle riesling wine cheaper bottles list $50  good    As dinner concluded two different waiters asked everything told them  feigned surprise other understood  Both told no choice things done there  Apologies excuses fine suppose but don't change fact mediocre experience worsened ridiculous price   kind enough comp wine both offered drinks dessert  declined  just wanted leave  final bit tackiness when paid  bring portable card reader table preset buttons tip  15% 20% etc  stupid way take care bill  I'd much prefer just take card bring receipt sign  nice restaurant would do     Considering all dining options Las Vegas can't think single reason ever Golden Steer    won't back  <EOR> The Golden Steer Las Vegas classic  ambiance alone worth trip  sides starters average but 12 oz  filet Oscar style fantastic  bananas foster made table side great well  Service wonderful restaurant definitely must any local just anyone interested classic Vegas dining experience  <EOR> I huge fan place   First all realize old establishment but neighborhood around best   couple friends' advice best steakhouse Vegas   not   friend mine ate terribly long ago   filet salad glass wine   He ribeye salad beer split baked potato   $225   might old school Vegas but charge some really new school prices   servers curt very friendly   ask water refills   should never happen any restaurant let alone you're paying house note eat at   weren't busy really no excuse    much better steaks Gordon Ramsay Carnevino Hugo's Cellar Capital Grille Vic Anthony's others   unless someone else buying going back here   worth hefty hefty price tag   despite lack business parking terrible  <EOR> If looking great old steakhouse off stop hotels place  Don't let outside scare off  You'll good deal $75 100 you'll prime quality beef few sides   Try caesar salad tossed table side  Awesome  <EOR> I driven restaurant hundreds probably thousands times while growing Vegas never tried until yesterday evening  wish tried place earlier proved some most excellent steak Vegas   The real reason held off trying place long cost  expensive restaurant which each steak priced least $35 Italian Specialties Chicken Parmigiana etc running $26 $27  being said did use Groupon eat here  Groupon good $50 enough really only cover person   The interior restaurant stands stark contrast crappy strip mall resides in  dark classic Vegas restaurants tend wonderful atmosphere  definently obvious place built 1958 history building easy see feel   The waiters couldn't nicer  greeted though regular place popped over table time time share stories more famous patrons The Rat Pack Elvis Presley Mario Andretti restaurant  Apparently Robert De Niro's son also works waiter which doesn't much sense   but hey  cool   As appetizer ordered signature garlic bread $5 which pretty tasty  pretty much impossible huge mess when eating which all more fun  regular bread excellent well came fresh hot almost burned myself when grabbed it  No complaints though take hot fresh bread any day week For entree 14 oz  Top Sirloin steak $37 side order steak fries $8   am seasoning sauce fanatic   but steak needed nothing extra  Much Bob Taylor's Ranch House meat cooked such way natural flavor meat rich enough no extra seasoning necessary    When all said done bill came exactly $50 just throw waiters tip  truly excellent meal would consider upper echelon Vegas steakhouses  <EOR> Finally rib eye done right some over processed over priced Morton's meat   am Iowa black angus steaks grandfathers farm   Also wait staff old school high end don't training anymore  <EOR> Now doesn't look much outside but looks deceiving! Everything ordered delicious but very pricey  filet mignon cooked perfection sautéed mushrooms very good  ordered salad but next time pass that  bread came meal good well   The ambience very old school dark  Very romantic  very classy but did see alot people casual wear   I definitely come back  <EOR> We love Vegas steakhouses  waited until visitors town try one  wish would've waited longer   We fine paying top price top quality  Golden Steer neither  overpaying name fact Vegas' oldest steakhouse   The ambiance great thats why star  Very old school Vegas  service absolutely horrible  4 us  head waiter greeted most annoyed lethargic way  Two separate people asked which type water wanted  only saw waiter greet take order ask dessert   We order famous garlic bread start  extremely crumby pretty tasteless    Each ordered some kind steak prime rib  meat okay  Nothing write home about  also ordered world's largest baked potato   Again nothing special here  other sides sautéed mushrooms  Unbeknownst mushroom buttons sliced mushrooms    The final time saw waiter he ask if wanted dessert    he REEKED ashtray  clear he just finished smoke break  He absolutely STUNK  when he brought bill he double charged garlic bread I mention because reading other Yelp comments seems recurring problem    If want great steakhouse which worth weight gold Hugo's Cellar Four Queens Hank's Green Valley Ranch  promise won't over pay getting   This huge disappointment us  really looking forward restaurant  <EOR> I've wanting try place past 18 years! FINALLY made reservations not really needed Saturday night  steak no doubt 5 stars high quality meat BUT everything else needed help taste wise  bill $275 00 3 NO alcohol includes tip     PROS Steaks filet mignon bone rib eye Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail HUGE shrimp Old Vegas interior great pictures  CONS Clams casino looked stuffed clams Beefsteak Tomato Salad bland Creamed Corn              Creamed Spinach             $$$$ <EOR> We seated host first thing recognized sitting Burt Reynolds table  looked around all other tables marked famous actors' names  Whenever certain actor comes into restaurant eat eat table  pretty neat  Clint Eastwood's table right across ours over sat down  sounds weird but kind cool sitting Clint Eastwood's table where he sat dined   The restaurant old fashioned feel it  wood paneling lights dimmed down Sinatra playing background  All staff wearing tuxedo's  Don't worry though ate t shirt shorts  felt little place   The first thing really impressed when ordered famous Caesar salad waiter mixed dressing lettuce right front us  best salads long time   If love prime rib place go! Golden Steer famous disappoint  When cut through steak felt butter  steak cooked perfectly say without doubt best prime rib ever had   Coupled history outstanding food can't think better dining experiences  Every time someone asks dining suggestion Vegas always mention restaurant  little way but perfect getaway hustle bustle strip  <EOR> I wish could give bit higher rating     My food hands down FIVE stars but service just meh    We started table side Caesar Salad   by way EVERYONE should tableside Caesar! But person making NO personality    my husband even tried joke around he wouldn't crack smile    tableside show no show    we barely hello  Our steaks AMAZING petite filet cooked perfectly side great too!  Dessert   of course tableside bananas foster   again   same dry tableside waiter    and desert just ok   wasn't best bananas foster I suggest stop using banana liqueur don't need fake banana flavor Bacardi 151 use brandy     as doesn't burn fast lets bananas caramelize more without burning   and yes dessert house frequently I'd back different waiter   maybe upgrade 5 star review   as food certainly deserving it  <EOR> Love Decor  $17 martini bit much  Prime rib over done last year food amazing time true  busy but no excuse poor service  bad didn't charge sides  42 anniversary all coment hostess! Chain restaurants give small desert  cool  Next time going steak restaurant Orleans better food service  Sorry!!! <EOR> This review 3 5 stars   To begin am fan strip steak houses   Yes overpriced but offer upscale good eats environment almost guarantees quality meal   Golden Steer steers little different direction staying true its Vegas origin   scale restaurant less strip steak house however   Though waiters wearing tuxedos prices par restaurant itself located right off Sahara unwelcoming shopping plaza bar even machines play blackjack   Very Vegassy vibe   I decided give Golden Steer shot because found Groupon craving nice dinner   ate bar served very nice old fashioned $12   then ordered caesar salad $12 12oz filet $48 medium rare   caesar salad though prepared bar side hoping top notch salad   Nothing extraordinary but top quality salad nonetheless   steak came without sides cooked all over place   outside easily medium if well done   inside perfect but only 70% steak cooked correctly little lackluster top steak house   In all Golden Steer worth only coupon   nice classy environment different strip places but believe find very similar steak if better downtown suburbs cheaper price  albeit back time old Vegas  <EOR> Old Vegas atmosphere neat identified each table Celebrity dined there  IE John Wayne Charles Bronson Table side preparation love banana fosters great steak prime cuts !

The ambience cool takes back time dim lighting well pictures legends John Wayne Marilyn Monroe walls  recommended started off table side Caesar Salad  fun watching server it  Usually Caesar dressing creamy but unique tasted great too  8oz Petite Filet Mignon which cooked perfection! Didn't any fork knife struggles because steak easy cut full flavor  All enjoyed delicious food! also ordered side Whipped Potatoes which tasty but nothing special  If planning order dessert stay away Creme Brûlée  no expert but some restaurants horrible Creme Brûlées  Don't waste your money them here! Some party table side Bananas Foster  Watching them very entertaining flames all  told good but little sweet kind crazy rum    Great service! servers worked team very attentive refilling drinks taking plates away constantly asking food tasting  Definitely wouldn't mind coming back again! <EOR> The highlight trip Vegas!
