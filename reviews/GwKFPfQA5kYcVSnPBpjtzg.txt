Kris Kelley <EOR> A few weeks ago husband lovely Saturday brunch Garfield's which located small commercial center Regatta Drive heart Desert Shores  Upon entering immediately pleased  nautical themed restaurant situated actual water cares if fake lake reminded sitting Shutters Beach Santa Monica dad some years back  sat atrium really enjoyed feeling wasn't Vegas   Our waiter Thomas intuitive needs gave time needed peruse menu indulging answering numerous questions  opinions various dishes menu honest though weren't able try everything wanted he gave enough information want come back even before ordered  agonizing minutes deliberation decided upon starting crab cakes of course try seafood followed salad nicoise side potatoes au gratin   The crab cakes $12 browned nicely seasoned well however missed big chunks lump crab meat sign good crab cake  backfin used instead lump good quality though didn't tin taste some do  Dijon mustard sauce really made dish successful proved chef fact French nobody does sauces French   acidity complimented fried cakes more inventive approach serving them usual suspects aoli tartar sauce  using fresh chewy bread sop remaining sauce allowed them remove plate room salad potatoes  salad nicoise $16 wasn't visually appealing could sad tuna can  actually really dislike canned tuna fish personal aversion made worse freshman year roommate ate ALL time teeny dorm room lacked adequate ventilation  much better quality 'chicken sea ' however therefore tolerable me  Most other components salad fine chef scores points going extra trouble soaking thinly sliced onions water dulls some bite   haricot vert crunchy but Ian pointed blanched improperly because weren't seasoned substantially enough own verdant should the result water rolling boil when green beans shocking them properly ice cold water when came out   tomatoes pithy didn't eat them but dressing almost made salad's shortcomings  au gratin potatoes $7 made organic Idaho potatoes nothing unique but did come bubbly cheesy scrumptious addition little salt I'd comment serve good salt table mini pepper mill which consider hallmarks good restaurant   meal Thomas brought free champagne cocktail which incredibly generous seeing hadn't voiced grievances face  He wanted try grottes cherries cocktail asked which delicious  $12 would fairly expensive but definitely worth it   Would order potatoes again? Maybe  Would order salad again? Probably not  probably wouldn't crab cakes again actually  don't want harsh because food all pretty good just bit overpriced was  intrigued enough want come back try some other dishes though perhaps french toast bananas Thomas raved blackened shrimp over pasta which menu but apparently very popular   The real reason come ambiance atrium which unpretentious cheery side great views  even saw black swan guarding eggs nearby nest while mate patrolled area ensure safety few turtles bobbing around lake quite sweet little scene being desert! <EOR> The first time Garfield's boyfriend experience deplorable  won't into detail because manager came speak more made experience  He gave gift card return restaurant give second chance did   The second time much better  sat near window because cold sit outside beautiful patio  server friendly enough but didn't really way herself memorable  first thing bothered when drinks 2 1 which happy hour special didn't even see sign table let know until ordered drinks  thought server would told seeing still 1 hour left happy hour  wasn't until brought attention she gave Happy Hour drink prices  restaurant brings mind philosophy strong believe which good service more important good food    The manager nice first time because returned  time highly unlikely return dinner  say food good  bit pricier I'd normally pay but quality worth price  crab cakes delicious  boyfriend steak came asparagus mashed potatoes  Both dishes very yummy steak cooked properly which plus   Note want return during brunch over weekend because open Bloody Mary bar just love some Bloody Mary's! <EOR> I Garfield's Sunday brunch  All signs pointed delightful Sunday brunch view lake  But don't let lake view fool you  place pretty bad  service very slow inaccurate  top food wasn't all great either  ordered chopped salad  Simple  can't screw right? saddest salad ever seen  fellow diners actually teased it  small portion 99% iceberg lettuce  literally only couple pieces tomato size peppercorn  Also light sprinkling ham  completely underwhelming  seen side salads mcdonalds looked tasted better    One person table ordered French toast which comes berries  order arrived no fruit whatsoever  notified person told gave someone else's order but he'd bring fruit  couple people finished meals when notified 2nd person missing fruit also said he'd bring it  person eating French toast slowed down wait fruit  time fruit came everyone done meals French toast now cold 3 4 eaten  Yum    In nutshell Plain food poor service  somewhere else  <EOR> Came 12 lady friends brunch  seated such nice spot  over looked pretty little lake  I ordered Cobb salad best salads ever  split order crab cakes also pretty fantastic  The highlight endless glasses bubbly  splash peach added into mine going down way easy!  Can't wait come back again  <EOR> I previously wrote very lengthy review restaurant which somehow deleted     Obviously bad review  wonder good reviews place trusted if power remove reviews don't like   I terrible experience Monday night  only offered five menu items Hamburgers hotdogs garlic fries pretzels chicken wings When wanted order regular menu refused  manager incredibly rude drinking job  Normally would just decide return Monday night football but continue customer except incredibly unprofessional demeanor manager  never back again  <EOR> A romantic dinner water's edge Summerlin area choice delayed Valentine's Day celebration   I under impression Garfield's Restaurant more New American but waiter said actually more French inspired  going bit tricky since egg free diet  Nonetheless Groupon allowed some flexibility choices dinner which helped lot   After put order started munching Parmesan cheese crisps could enough them!  really yummy!  We started off Beignet Calamari Tempura Fried Pickled Peppers Tartar Sauce $12    Usually calamari pretty average much set apart rest   But some reason version pretty good!  accompanying pickles nice contrast tartar dipping sauce little extra made stand out   pleasantly surprised!

First course salmon tar tar croutons  Actually decent but size silver dollar  Second course scallops basil rice  table very small scallops compared everyone else got  Ours where little larger gold dollar  boys cooked perfect mine rubbery overdone  Rice good but again super small portions  Maybe half cup rice   Third course chicken  Finally big plate right? Wrong  thin slices dry chicken over mediocre mole Mexican rice  Bland  Still hungry   Here comes forth course! Yummy dessert time! Except raspberry mouse unpalatable  ate bite    Did mention wine pairing? wines overall acceptable but well paired meals   And top off handed bill end included only 18% gratuity which course expected pay but over $10 tax supposed prepaid meal  Needless say we're unimpressed returning  ended needing eat when home because still hungry  Oh did mention 4 course dinner took over two half hours?! <EOR> I came 4 girlfriends enjoy unlimited mimosa brunch! sat patio greeted impeccable service great views even BETTER food drinks! started REAL reason BELINI MIMOSA madness! waiters did hesitate bring drinks made sure always  full glass hand!!!!  Once chatted bit over mimosas ordered  waiters never rushed made great recommendations  example usually NEVER order French Toast but recommendation waiter did    Once french toast arrived took bite WOW  Best French Toast EVER seriously  turned skeptic french toast into believer hallelujah! Crispy fluffy springy dab butter maple syrup=perfection   The best part whole experience its location sits beautiful lake ducks geese cool breeze  nice change your typical Vegas eatery  <EOR> I'm sure think Garfield's 2nd visit  Btw fell behind reviews 1st visit actually few weeks ago didn't twice week     super early dinner time really ONLY table seated  happy hour bar started couple martinis  server nice but pretty awkward she seemed new  did groupon again started kind weird  Last time wanted bottle reisling but told didn't unopened bottle able included glass wine  time opposite wanted glass but told only sell bottle  If  case why didn't full bottle last time? She also didn't seem know wines all reds anyway    Ordered New Orleans style barbecue gulf shrimp which supposed kind spicy scampi ton chopped garlic spices   expected but version headless peeled shrimp light citrusy sauce  good but even close BBQ shrimp    Rib eye slightly overcooked medium well medium but still seasoned well huge  friend days special halibut over garlic spinach w supposedly champagne sauce  Look picture sauce really strong orange sauce taste color even garnished orange  overpowering something halibut ironically would've better fake bbq sauce shrimp    Souffle perfect again but rest pretty big disappointment  half off wine night also bottle only $15 which awesome  Total tip around $110  bad but also paid $57 $114 groupon theory $224 meal  worth much? Definitely not    also took home half bottle since didn't finish it  She put laid down bag when home few hrs later found she didn't close screw cap tightly lot spilled bag  Luckily good bags didn't leak thru car but seriously? visit huge fail nearly every way really can't recommend anyone anymore  <EOR> Food drinks scenery great  However service horrendous  friends came bottomless drinks cut off waiter no apparent reason  He dropped off check without asking if needed anything further  matters worse asked another round drinks  response no more drinks drop off check     first off NEVER asked check  Secondly suck  Point blank  Oh forgot add hid check purposely  waiter audacity ask if misplaced check  if! Did forget mention ran tabasco?!?? um going serve bloody mary's w tabasco spicyness??!?!??! done spot  <EOR> Hidden location but well worth finding  restaurant small local strip mall but lake  Yes lake! Summerlin lived 5 years before stumbling across development during spring bicycle ride  Garfields nautical theme believe all tables lake view even guy fishing boat dined   sure if he serious fisherman just enjoying lake cooler own company   The service excellent knowledgeable staff super friendly  wife 3 kids everyone welcomed  menu excellent enjoyed pan fried sea bass which moist delicious wife eating meat Good Friday pizza super thin top notch  Kids plenty choices good feed! Reasonably priced wine English Bass beer finished off great night   It worth drive Strip if you're visiting but if local must  <EOR>
