Kind Bubba Gump restaurant meets House Blues   Came lunch ordered Memphis Style chicken salad   First waitress took FOREVER come table   order took long time table food just so so   nothing particularly special salad but also nothing wrong it   Portion very generous   Perhaps more traditional Southern fare better but wouldn't back average salad slow service  <EOR> CUSTOMER SERVICE BEST but food pretty good!!  reading all reviews friend hesitant try spot but walking strip ended here   soon approached podium around 4 young ladies just standing there      we waited someone tell something   being told 20 min wait table the place wasnt even full found spot bar   10 min waiting someone acknowledge friend some menus   then told order bartender we seated bar area but bar    wish someone told directly bar order    food finally came admit good   baked beans best sure order that   would just suggest management put staff customer service training learn manage multiple tables customer doesnt own menus additional napkins  <EOR> I really want give place 4 stars     But just can't    The food really good  gumbo spicy decent sized portion  partner inhaled burger which good sign  mac cheese made white cheddar came extra cheese melting top it  But piece de resistance sweet potato puff sundae  name little misleading  They're puffs all they're basically sweet potater tots  They're little smaller perfectly crispy outside soft sweet inside  Bring them large bowl drizzle them hot fudge caramel top them scoop vanilla ice cream you've decadent dessert just die for! If nothing else that!  So why only 3 stars? service probably worst service received restaurant long time  6 us  seated table  Then waited almost 20 minutes no drinks no acknowledgement  ended having hostess let know we'd waiting still didn't drinks  She didn't apologise just said Ok minute find server  few minutes later he appeared elbow said want drink? Hey guys sorry delay  everyone? etc Nothing  Just want drink? tell all ready order food too  He really didn't seem he wanted showed  He around took orders then left  He brought drinks point several empty bar refills when he appeared more  When he brought food he just kind threw down it  don't think he came back check once except clear plates  time crunch would spoken manager but trying hustle show    It's shame really  service point would bumped another star because food good live music good  But awful service just impossible ignore  <EOR> Very poor service! Food quality poor  Doesn't everyone know actually cook meat before serve it? Ordered burger meat raw! Waitress cared less! Skip joint! <EOR> The ribs awesome but service just ok people really nice but may see your waiter waitress long periods time  atmosphere cool if live music something different  3 times probably again! <EOR> We lucky enough All Star Band 10 30 2 30 most nights which highly recommend! 11 players guest singers belt blues MoTown power!

C! sure why shoehorned ten more pirate related jokes into set  only assume thought playing Treasure Island night  Sadly lead singer attempting growl baritone bluesy wail but just sounded awkward range comfort zone  Good background tunes guess if elevator music drums   Additionally sells nine dollar PBR? friend paid eighteen dollars two notoriously cheap beers  if you're going charge twelve bucks Guinness better sure tastes fresh stuff tap mixture pine tar dust    The catfish absolutely no taste must battered wet sand  cheese sausage platter looked opened Slim Jim package threw plate    And top off when bill came asked waiter politely if he could put 30 dollars cash toward tab put rest 40 credit card  He repeated request nodded agreement walked away  When he came back he pocketed 30 dollars citing told keep tip charged full 70 bucks  If question dude ask before turn your hand into piggy bank  When you're dealing money don't assume know    This best feel blues experience ever  Maybe themed interactive restaurant  <EOR> Julian Dennison GM he most fantastic host  Welcoming generous friendly   First visit wicked live blues band!!! house band sub lead guitar    TOTALLY stole show!

Lucille's never disappoints   Not case BB Kings    We time look menu decide wanted before someone came take drink food order   minimum 35 minutes before saw food   Really poor service   She never came back check us   No refills   Once food finally there   the most helpful person working food runner   never saw waitress again until time drop off bill   Then thought she lost because didn't see again quite some time before card back  As far food goes   the sauce good   But ask extra side BBQ sauce   isn't bottle table   No extra flavors   only house sauce   dad liked ribs   mom split chicken ribs combo   opinion chicken dry ribs fatty   Cornbread pretty good though  There nightly music there   good band    however gets really loud there   Unless going specifically listen music   don't because won't able conversation   Unless plan yelling each other!  Also another warning people may know this   if restaurant while live entertainment charge entertainment tax which usually 18%   Definitely adds bill   mom gift shop magnet   that $6 magnet also charged 18% entertainment tax    Not planning going back   not worth prices   There's plenty other great places eat Mirage other Strip properties local places  <EOR> I ate BB King's almost every morning breakfast when visiting Vegas well least when wasn't hungover lazy take elevator 19 floors down some grub  good place some breakfast if staying Mirage  check specials mimosas bloody Mary's  bar staff super duper nice appreciated having morning cup coffee them during stay  <EOR> THEYRE CLOSED  PERMANENTLY! The bartender Sun 11 11 @ 11am totally RUDE    Pissed off them closing wasnt trying helpful nice even dressed if he even cared there    Wanted Bloody Marys road before heading Airport he refused charge room  Telling closing tonight The Mirage doesnt own anymore taking room charges! Worst treatment Mirage! Glad theyre closing         <EOR> We day opened lunch   really wanted try deep fried pickles but chickened LOL  ended getting Patty Melt wasn't bad something hard mess though    Positives Pricing actually pretty reasonable strip Vegas little pricey but shockingly expensive  Nice variety dishes lots good comfort food   Negatives The restaurant really open bit big deli feel just sea tables looks tried really easy clear all tables music dancing   SInce right opened give them another try sometime   bad place but anything knocked socks off  <EOR> Would give less if possible!  First pay cover charge see random band perform during half dinner  If going charge cover could least perform throughout night   Next food  wife Cajun carbenara bland flavorless  Even garlic toast bland  BBQ chicken ribs weren't bad but worth $23 cost   Finally cost $25 coupon which why first place dinner two 1 drink each bill still $60   right original bill prior coupon $85    This absolutely wasn't worth it  thought bland soul food oxymoron until ate here  advice just don't place  <EOR> So apparently someone working BB Kings keeps Yelp reviews send message apologizing lackluster experience   I offered $25 gift certicate the kind buy restaurant com $2 several times month free t shirt reconsidering review   What exactly am supposed reconsider?  informed mystery worker appreciated offer would give them another chance should send certificate but would change review until dined again since wouldn't fair anyone else reading reviews   Three weeks later received no reply mail BB Kings     Oh worth heard Happy Hour currently cancelled  <EOR> Something vacationing want collard greens   lol  only spot came mind BB Kings   Decided eat Sunday night checking website seeing sold 1  Collard Greens 2  Fried Pickles!  website able reserve table through Open Table   However did see where cover charge Sunday  Fri Sat only    OK  no big deal   $5 later when band break   seated table right front row clear view band   Great   ordered Fried Pickle appetizer cat fish entree side collard greens   pickles great but sauce salty  catfish came hot great well   collard greens barely room temperature dry   little juice mine   won't ordering them again  The house band very good!  male lead singer lead guitar awesome   could listened all night   female singer came great voice but no stage presence   She looked if she robot programed sing   mention all fidgeting   dress ear piece  only smile she gave when patron walked tip bucket seductively  All all good experience would try again  <EOR> Stuck inside Mirage staying BB's nice surprise   love blues love BB King love food   could wrong?  After receiving much deserved Bloody Mary $10 but bottomless $20 look menu     Chorizo burrito sounds good   Corned beef hash   i love stuff  Biscuits n Gravy  too heavy plane ride home     What's this?  Chicken Waffles? Jackpot   Served hot sauce syrup   spicy delicious   enough waffle but am glad ate none less   Gladys Knight sells Midnight Train Atlanta which chicken waffles   looks better but take get   3 chicken tenders good size waffle covered butter powdered sugar syrup   Don't forget hot sauce  $15  Wife regular breakfast   eggs meat hash brown biscuit   Good   worth 13 bucks but Vegas resort therefore expect resort prices   Anyone complaining price Vegas probably wrong place   Since staying walked twice night hear music club   Both times sounded great   Wish more time hang out  <EOR> Went tonight because friends visiting East Coast wanted brought $75 restaurant com certificate along them   spend $150 discount    hard here   They're big eaters keep them     The four shared sampler appetizer platter ribs catfish fried pickles wings also bowl sweet potato puffs   Everything sampler platter good but puffs outstanding   try never eat fried food but couldn't resist these   I ordered filet mignon medium rare   delivered medium well dried awful   sent back friend ordered bbq salmon over creamed corn adorned shrimp   shrimp good sized cooked right   salmon would good but creamed corn hell weren't kidding cream   Heart Attack plate enough cream clog arteries tri athlete   combined sweetness corn gloppy barbecue sauce fat content andouille sausage mixed good measure made way rich me   friend loved though!  My husband's hanger steak ordered medium came well done   fine since he only orders steaks medium because force to   other guy pork chops he liked them   should gotten them because looked didn't any heavy sauce them   really pissed off though husband didn't want collard greens came steak asked if he could substitute green beans   waiter said there'd $2 extra charge   Why?  Both listed sides same charge   kind niggling crap really pushes buttons 'cause unnecessary   After pigging all food friends wanted dessert along ride   banana bread pudding very large portion   love bread pudding but am usually disappointed   time really good   eating leftovers next three days   The band Greg Garland think something close really really talented   But detest loud music always especially when having dinner friends can't conversation   When finally threw towel decided talk music did enjoy it   think all musicians gone deaf can't hear volume they're playing   The service spotty good sometimes infuriatingly slow other times    All all entertaining evening   Tomorrow we'll find quiet cafe take them finally talk  <EOR> Since staying Mirage wanted some breakfast but feeling hungry enough buffet yet wanted more muffin coffee Starbucks chose BB Kings mainly because close no wait   I excited see chicken waffles always wanted try chicken waffles    wasn't anything spectacular hear many people rave great was     chicken looked chicken tenders could fast food joint for paid $15?  Now mind if good wouldn't complaining   My husband yogurt parfait small cup yogurt handful granola $10   HUH?
