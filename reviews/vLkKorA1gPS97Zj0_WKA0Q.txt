Everyone ordered appetizer entree drink full even entertain dessert  total $120 person including tax tip less interesting fine dining experiences paid much much more  <EOR> This probably most disappointing meals chef high caliber   Perhaps because restaurant newly opened menu hasn't perfected well still no excuse overcooking beef ?  Unlike other low rating reviewer service really good us  ambiance table seating arrangement also issue  only problem entirely food   I different tasting dishes but some times felt really disjointed confused if lacked something tie all small dishes together     The langoustine tasting quite fun interesting  While some dishes  amazing others huh? sake shot? like  hum   not sure why doing shot sake when just sold bottle really expensive wine   didn't really enhance langoustine overall tasting experience    My husband's steak overdone  He ordered rare beef came barely pink  didn't want send back just decided concentrate venison which prob best ever had    The dessert tasting fun exciting  flirtatious girl all dressed ready night town  Lots bling once again many components didn't really sense all together   This sounds really silly but warm baguette served before meal awesome not baked in house   but super tasty !

We dined Twist probably least ten times since first opened! fondly remembered those wonderful early years under Pascal Sanchez when he pampered guests most creative labor intensive dishes LV offering far better food service value competition over Joel Robuchon Guy Savoy departure Sanchez few years ago though Twist became just another ordinary high end restaurant under Kawasaki another temporary chef even though both spent years Gagnaire's kitchens  Answering prayers Don Frederic finally came rescue long delay due some visa problems proved worth wait! The creativity back of course Gagnaire big hand that equally important flawless execution dishes! Seafood once again cooked perfection neither 10 seconds short long included many shellfish dishes always challenge even some best kitchens! The lobster poached green tea beurre doux Alaskan king crab Nigerian tandoori prawns smoked haddock scallop soufflé well crispy langoustine all done well enough Gagnaire proud Eric Ripert looked over shoulders   Apparently much different experience Brian B  Luck draw? am most forgiving seafood having turned back lobster even Michelin three starred L'Atelier Hong Kong mention many other restaurants even returning fish dish twice them  Bases first dinner Twist under helm Frederic far best restaurant Las Vegas!

FRENCH RESTAURANT but whatever  Sadly removed foie gras 4 ways replaced this  just basic cold foie gras terrine  all tasty special interesting  many better foie gras terrines life    * Las Vegas showcases weird random cuisine truly is! 4 components * tuna over pears just creative enough special impeccable tuna *lamb shoulder braised DELISH  more special items ate last night  Sad tiny portion   *guacamole cactus yup boring weird sounds *Martini glass sorbet popcorn all fun food but just SILLY  sorry can't just throw popcorn martini glass boring sorbet call gourmet  Nope    *Nebraska ribeye 2 ways pleasant surprise! HUGE 12 ounces center cut meat meat incredible  served cut burnt gross meat swimming oil green beans HUH? your 2 ways ?? some pumpkin thing if memory serves  sides didn't matter main ribeye very large very tasty  could skip nasty oily grizzle meat side if trying seem gourmet    * DEER little odd call deer it's always venison TX! but mb call because unlike venison any way  wasn't gamey VERY tender  deer filet mignon  served some terrible brussel sprouts chewy gnocchi  Again stop serving crappy sides already! least meat really good could look past it  Best deer ever and growing TX ate deer quite bit!!     *Dessert Pierre Gagnier 5 ways or something that! skip boring details but actually fun enjoyable  playful desserts dessert time silly  chocolate caramel apple pistachio etc etc lots flavors all delicious!   Wine Pleasantly surprised domestic offerings  Some favorite Napa estate cabs available pricing wasn't really bad  wine service very good well    Service waiters French opinion could tad friendlier  Because place expensive disappointed service wasn't better  spent LOT food wine don't feel treated such  asked another multigrain roll promised another one    NEVER CAME  specifically ordered pre theater menu $10 less regular menu but charged full price  husband without water 30 minutes  Nit picky stuff but service should flawless!   Overall impressions glad dined but can't say likely come back  food ranged boring weird delicious but never best bite life quality it  meats impeccable desserts fun those highlights me  Service could better but restaurant beautiful  would recommend trying Joel Robuchon first if you're looking fancy French dinner  <EOR> This place major disappointment review long overdue  made reservations place based chef Pierre Gagnaire's marvelous reviews  disappointing factor bunch amigos back cooking  Saturday night June only total 6 tables enormous beautiful place  food bad       2 glasses Schramberg Blanc de Blanc $52 ripoff 1 bottle Bien Nacido 2007 Pinot Noir good Pierre's salad appetizer $24 so Trio Foie Gras $38 weird looking didn't finish it USDA Ribeye $60 most disappointing part entree! steak rubbery tasted cooked Soy sauce!
