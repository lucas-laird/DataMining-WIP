The wine list showed ambition but lacked commitment  covers lots ground but most producers features garden variety   On other hand staff lovely attentive  Dishes whisked off table impressive efficiency  Every request greeted cheerful enthusiasm which helped overall experience mildly positive one    I cannot honestly say great first experience Fleur but considering creativity friendly attitude definitely try again  <EOR> I came 3 other friends ordered bunch different plates shared everything try bunch stuff   Service great   would give place 3 star if wasn't near damn perfect chocolate souffle   souffle bumped 4 star rating     What ordered Croque Monsieur YUM Steak Tartar good but better Fig flambe tarte Flambee could've done without Seared foie gras YUMMMMM Tuna Tacos friends liked dish   thought hard shell taco raw tuna weird combo  Rock Shrimp blahhh if ever Korean spicy dduk uses same sauce  Braised Hamachi very good Italian style Meatballs good Braised Short Ribs very good but better Side Wild Mushroom good  Warm Coconut Almond Cakes Very good   Kiwi sorbet great combo almond cakes  Chocolate Souffle AMAZING!

Embarrassing but true  Desserts also standout esp  basil sorbet  Spendy but worth it    Also dark intimate decor tres romantique  Great special occasion  <EOR> ive eaten twice more satisfied both times! service great food amazing setting beautiful! oysters delicious tuna tacos must pork tender melts your mouth!  the dishes creative different cannot fine dining anywhere it! everything cooked perfection only special dishes amazing but even sliders fries best strip!  fluer great place dinner date family together even if just want great meal!  i would definitely recommend place anyone loves great quality food! 5 stars! <EOR> I specifically trip Vegas just Chef Keller's mussels again  definitely stole show meal  Perfectly cooked  consistency sauce just thick enough stick each mussel making perfect bite  find myself always comparing mussel dishes back Fleur's    The atmosphere restuarant nice over top decorated some Vegas venues are  Servers hover attentive enough seamless meal  Job well done Chef  <EOR> Becky bartender awesome   great servive good recommendation grilled vegi sandwich  Also very helpful vegas vouchers <EOR> Perhaps ordered wrong items?  We started shabu shabu small bowl piece shrimp some veggies tiny bundle noodles  broth then poured into bowl tableside  Such false advertising advertise shabu shabu  it more bowl noodles  flavor bland truly think dish should taken off menu   My boyfriend ordered Fleur Burger ordered Short Ribs  short ribs bit hard pull apart cut quality meat fell short expectations  probably ate half before throwing towel  excited taste Fleur Burger hearing many good things it  but just wasn't blown away   The whole meal average  everything service food  experience Fleur pushed Hubert Keller's other restaurants way down list restaurants try  <EOR> I hugely disappointed place   But let explain   very hyped eat having heard great was   little worried when learned later no longer Fleur de Lys but became just Fleur started serving tapas   No matter though!  The decor atmosphere pretty nice though   very pretty able see wine storage room bottom floor   guess there's dining table wine storage area it's really cool looking area    But uh ladies    don't table wear skirt   Everyone bottom floor almost see your skirt   The service good   Waiters friendly attentive   far    place doing well   Ok now more important stuff    We each ordered drinks   Now mixed drinks started $15 which pretty pricey $35   talking mixed drinks wines which obviously much higher    ordered Absinthe Frappe which wasn't bad but wasn't amazing   dining partners all thought drinks decent but great as wasn't worth $15    would no problems drinks $10 but $15 more would've expected nod say wow pretty good  Now food Paprika Popcorn   wasn't bad but tasted seriously popcorn some salt paprika   cheapest thing menu ok sure   because figured would something munch while waited other things come    But really quite small easily finished way quickly   Oysters   fan oysters can't talk taste   other hand presentation?  Incredibly cool   Dry ice mist rising really cool looking contraption   oysters themselves small only 3   Friends said tasted pretty good but great small oysters   Chicken Croquette w Water Cress salad   actually pretty tasty   but 4 fish stick sized croquettes some water cress salad it   Pretty tasty though   Risotto   thought pretty good myself   amazing but pretty good   friend likes risotto though says she much better though decent   Mushroom Ragout   actually liked quite bit   mushrooms tasty well seasoned   course problem probably could've eaten whole thing 2 3 mouthfuls though but then again normally don't shove much food your mouth once when you're fine dining    Hamachi   quite tasty   fish good shittake mushrooms underneath flavorful tasty   Definitely lot though   Mac Cheese   Mac Cheese lobster seems really  popular combination   liked it   mac cheese + lobster multiple places though wasn't any better other places   friends also agreed other places better Mac Cheese + Lobster   But personally thought pretty tasty   Small portions though see trend?    I'd say much two half tea cups the ones use Chinese restaurant    Onion Soup   pretty tasty   comes 4 shot glasses filled soup   Well they're probably size 2 shots but pretty much equivalent 8 shots soup   Fairly tasty   Sliders   sliders themselves quite tasty   meat tender juicy flavorful   fries    well 10 fries   they're steak fries   Imagine getting 10 McDonalds fries  just ok   Personally rating break down something Ambience Great Service Good Drinks Meh Food Taste Decent Good Food Portions Laughably small Food Bang Buck Meh <EOR> Outstanding Grand Marnier soufflé perfect presentation just right amount Grand Marnier give balanced complex flavour right texture tasty crème anglaise custard   All served right temperature definitely worth 20 minutes wait! <EOR> First visit changes made  food still tastes great vibe more lively now  think more comfortable eat now  <EOR> Tapas restaurant  first glance wanted order 20 things    Judging yelp pictures other patrons offered amuse bouche menu definitely changed  Bummer us    Croque Monsieur favorite     Gnocci risotto ok  Garlic fries fabulous    Mussels fresh but wasn't feeling pesto put broth  hoping fabulous garlic wine butter broth Bouchon Mon Ami but sweet side    Very disappointed braised beef  Considered 'large' plate charged something $30  way much fat potatoes undercooked  Should gotten short ribs    If wasn't Restaurant com coupon would way over priced worth it  <EOR> went concert feeling hungry  food ok  loved chocolate souffle! but far entries honestly expecting more  just mediocre me  great atmosphere though  <EOR> This place nice  If looking nice quiet delicious meal place go  Everything ate amazing ahi tuna tacos arugula salad beats buratta pork belly fried rice braised short rib creme brûlée  Everything fresh cooked perfectly  server accommodating  She didn't try talk into anything order more wanted  Definitely worth checking out  <EOR> Oh dear oh dear oh dear  ate place two months ago wonderful experience  Small plates cheese platter fig flambe three white wines glass  Wonderful quality service  back weekend Sunday lunch two great glasses absinthe terrific service bartender  back two hours later different place  Different bartender can't be bothered attitude they'd lost remote couldn't change channels TV not bothered but he all apologetic   Ordered three different bottles white wines all stock  sure if they're running down stock save money recession but HUGE disappointment considering I'd before  Sort Monsieur Keller! <EOR> We Vegas convention met clients two nights row cocktails Fleur  wine each night each night recommended server hit each time  two nights row ordered Foie gras appetizer swooned  smooth butter delightfully mild  husband enjoyed octopus but wasn't fan  Fleur quite expensive if you're coming dinner take note  But fun sit 'patio' people watch good glass wine bite  Very attentive service  <EOR> Enjoyed Elegance Menu Wine Pairings  Service slow start took sometime waited bread service sluggish waited long time amuse bouche  mentioned something waiter told time restraints  He quick apologize rest meal flowed nicely timely   Truffled Onion Soup duck ragout started  Chardonnay selected pairing  Both delicious   2nd course followed gently heated salmon apple rosemary puree beautifully prepared  paired Pinot Grigio   Veal potato ravioli wasn't most striking dish but made lacked looks flavor  paired lovely Pinot Noir   Alaskan halibut mussels  fresh nicely done   Moving onto main course Filet short rib each served vegetable puree  All quite good  Wine pairings Chianti Cabernet Sauvignon   Desserts followed chocolate soufflé $6 upcharge carrot cake pineapple sorbet dessert trio  cake sorbet unmemorable but peanut butter baileys milkshake delicious  could've drank those all day night  Port served soufflé other dessert wine cannot remember name similar but far less cloying Moscato   We brought check petite fours given pink rose taken piece wall  all sweet treats gummy lychee treat left lasting impression final tab around $430 before tip 3 elegance menus two wine pairings    It quite enjoyable but we'll repeating  While everything done well nothing raised culinary bar speak  <EOR> Saw reviews excited try place  seeing MJ show thought would perfect place dinner before show  Apps very good but small bit overpriced  tuna tacos favorite followed octopus  Unfortunately more potato vs octopus  Another octopus app brought table accident immediately noticed plate more octopus ours meaning inconsistent portions bad  husband burger considering supposed specialty   over cooked really nothing special  Overall disappointed  <EOR> Came specifically Hudson Valley Foie Gras torchon   Beautiful presentation but lacking flavor bigtime  Dish served strawberries strawberry spread some type nuts assuming homemade peanut butter also lacking flavor   Great service but disappointing food  <EOR> I really high expectations Fleur   big fan Hubert Keller recently eaten Burger Bar really enjoyed experience there   really looking forward excellent food experience Fleur   start mildly disappointed   hostess wasn't very friendly restaurant itself overly  casual bar feel it   also loud while because live band playing just across way   menu small large plates huge many exciting options but  unfortunately many fell flat me   lobster mac cheese way mild very flavorful   duck really tender but could used more zing flavors   accompanying braised veggies rhubarb celery chipolini onion appetizing all looked limp oily flavorless   favorite garlic fries which incredibly rich due truffle oil   service inconsistent   Drinks refilled first refill took unexpectedly long time extra things requested e g  lime brought table   serviced really dropped off toward end meal when felt bit overlooked   also seemed problems expediting food reasonable time period   Even though all dishes don't need come same time wait long last plate the truffle fries thought forgotten them    While wasn't horrible dining experience bit frustrating because such high hopes Hubert Keller's food flavors just weren't there   But then again fear Fleur may just those trendy Vegas places where chef puts name but doesn't leave mark anywhere else  <EOR> Very good but great   did small plates they large plates menu all good but expected better   FOOD started parmesan popcorn which fun tasty dish   moved good but end forgettable bread meat cheese trays   Other dishes good but again special included olives risotto skirt steak chimichuri lobster mac 'n cheese inspired Keller's Top Chef dish prepared dorm shower steak tartare     dessert tiramisu brownie lollipops panne cotta PB J macaroons coconut cake   Again all good but great   There two notable dishes Crab avocado spheres which absolutely beautiful but only poor tasting dish the crab mushy lost avocado watermelon gazpacho    The Gnocchi excellent    Subtle but great balance between gnocchi cheese pesto and am pesto fan    SERVICE waitress very good friendly knowledgable menu but rest staff spotty  water rarely refilled   ATMOSPHERE effect two sections   front part restaurant seems reserved casual diners shorts hats etc back room more business casual diners   relatively quiet nice relaxed but hip feel   IN SUM Fleur nice dining experience but expected better   Everything good but 15 dishes only memorable special   quite four stars I'd 3 5 if could   <EOR> Food tasty but extremely small expensive no value  thouht tapas style few dishes share but each $20 dish only enough child filling any means The waitress nice but pushy side try order more bill two people came $200 including two cocktails but no dessert otherwise would lot more! $100 per person could gone lot good restaurants even Vegas  don't know Keller wife knows all stuff did know either <EOR> Located inside Mandalay Bay resort  restaurant beautiful decor patio bar lounge seating    The food pretty good  menu consists variety small plates inspired Chef Keller's international travels   It wasn't busy but servers hanging bar  little hard attention  Took while check also drinks refilled  <EOR> My husband decided nice meal honeymoon  booked restaurant Palazzo but last night Vegas tired  canceled reservation Fleur de Lys instead  We're very glad did!  We very impressed damn near everything    He steak lamp chops  Both world delicious hand made pretzel rolls  wanted ask 20 them  NOM    We ended night chocolate soufflé which world delicious  shared plenty big enough both unlike some other fine dining restaurants portions hardy Fleur de Lys    If you're looking fine dining you're staying near Mandalay Bay or even if you're not! check Fleur de Lys  <EOR> 5 stars = good gets   DEFINITELY!

I girlfriend celebrate five months together  found gift certificates Restaurant com thought hey why not?  We arrived time 9 00pm reservation all dressed seated immediately swank dining room some mood music between black curtains  Upon sitting down though realized forgotten gift certificate  Luckily still email phone    but would accept it? asked server next time she came 'round she wasn't sure but she would ask manager  Sure enough    looked wouldn't take it  = Oh well    stuff happens   We decided both elegance menu would mean 8 different dishes between two $79 person  entrees around $50 la carte apps around $20    why prix fixe?   After some delicious bread rosemary foccacia honey wheat rolls amuse busche tempura cod potato salad cayanne creme fraiche  pretty cute sorta play fish chips = And remember when manager came said he wouldn't take coupon off email? Well he came back suggested something else if could send confirmation email he would print apply us  Really? REALLY  AWESOME! There's another star right there!  The rest night just there  highlights 1st course Truffled Onion  Soup Braised Duck Ragout girlfriend definitely won one  soup amazingly creamy delicious duck inside crepe just money  *drool* Ahi Tuna Tartare alright  think better tartares before    fennel definitely little different good but favorite flavor think   2nd course Citrus glazed halibut halibut alright but really blew away broccoli puree  haven't purees much    usually don't eat such fancy places    but stuff blew mind  tasted freakin' good    pure essence broccoli  heck did that?! Braised Veal Yukon Gold Potato Ravioli came pretty good too  potato inside ravioli flavorful      3rd Course Filet mignon + foie gras truffles probably BEST cooked piece meat EVER eaten PERFECTLY medium rare practically melted mouth    foie gras    first time stuff just MELTED over meat    freakin' delicious  usually fan liver but stuff just butter  Paired filet AMAZING  Totally worth extra $25  mashed potatoes which more puree equally delicious  Stout Braised Beef Short Ribs really good too  say mustard favorite part but again some most tender well cooked meat ever had   Dessert Chocolate Souffle shabby     huge chocolate fan but girlfriend loved it  Carrot cream cheese ice cream sandwich Carrot cake great but beyond simple carrot cake  simply heavenly  carrot pineapple ice cream served sweet but overly so  absolutely LOVED raspberry jam smeared side ice cream sandwich  *drool* think if only filet dinner would've completely satisfied   We also served complimentary anniversary dessert play cheesecake scripted Happy Anniversary chocolate  tellin' yah service tops!

A leisurely meal lively conversation made very enjoyable evening experience  <EOR> My advice would skip it   We Vegas sister's 25th birthday stayed Mandalay Bay  Initially made reservations Aureole  looking around menus found menu Fleur more appetizing switch last minute  BIG mistake   First all Fleur nice restaurant  no outer walls people walking being loud disrupt your meal  also cheesy poster thing outside made feel going random sushi restaurant Brooklyn   Second waiter probably most awkward person ever encountered restaurant  restaurant tapas style menu nothing online  ordered bunch tapas since large lunch still bit stuffed  Some people party ordered larger tapas  assumed they'd bring tapas together since well they're tapas meant shared  case  brought all but two dishes waited really really long time 30 minutes those two dishes  Just cancel them waiter said Oh second course  Huh? Why heck would two people want eat while everyone else watched? obviously forgot those dishes last minute brought them out   I refuse but husband doesn't scene   Anyway then when came dessert portion expected them bring something sister since asked occasion when made reservation   But no  awkward waiter brings dessert menu asks everyone wants no wanted anything just wanted needed reminded another person party its birthday  Then he defensive when reminded him  Awesome  She eventually brownie lollipops   To top all off no apology compensation huge lag time between first second courses     This place empty every night passed by  place Vegas where fancy delicious food dime dozen place won't last  yourself favor don't subject yourself awkward slow service  <EOR> Such great time Becky bartender@fleur she incredible  second year row she made  signature cocktail   Paris bloom   Always personable great conversation  Always come back her <EOR> Knew Chef Keller many TV appearances french pedigree   very excited   bad service akin bad Denny's waitstaff   We cut off server before finishing ordering   Hence Fleur lost 28 dollar order Diver Scallops   asked Duck but cabbage chicken entree   served Cesare salad before even half through server asked if would ok if brought entree since ready    relunctantly agreed only served wrong order they brought chicken cabbage instead duck    Off both entrees remade   While waiting asked server please place order souffle would ready when finished meal   The dinners good though duck skin crispy I'd hoped   Server cleared plates asked if wanted anything else proceeded bring check   aggravated tell he forgotten souffle   Another 15 dollars threw away bad service   What disappointment   Won't back again  <EOR> Happy Birthday ME!  5 Friday night    GREAT service GREAT food   Started off some drinks while table together   sat down ordered cheese plate dried cured meat platter Italian meatballs start   Ordered second cheese plate    YUM!

steak bad but onion soup app much better opinion   Overall excellent food great pleasant service overall easygoing atmosphere  prices little high but nothing ordinary Vegas strip  Definitely recommend other folk likely visit again  <EOR> Hmmmm    i don't know rate restaurant    liked but damn expensive   If fact came home hungry enough eat beef curry made earlier    all fairness ate foie gras which never   it did down butter   so yes loved but $25   it does hurt little   still bit hungry ordered Nicoise salad  which really fishy mistake   oyy!

reviewers hated mac cheese being cheesy enough   however if fan kraft mac cheese it   personally restaurant mac cheese  always way oily 25 different cheeses melted noodles super heavy bread crumb topping   honestly prefer neon orange crap costs $1 70 cents sale    keller's mac cheese sort smooth silky cheese sauce feels very light except lobster chunks thrown in   loved it   the rest meal hit miss some really amazing things fried chickpeas tuna tacos manchego salad   everything else very decent but best i'd ever steak tartare skirt steak moules   overall solid meal better average  <EOR> February 2 2013 Absolutely terrible  hate giving low marks especially French restaurants   My friend works marketing UFC offered some choice seats  arrived beginning during minor fights decided few cocktails small meal  chose Fleur because saw decent happy hour menu lots bar seating    Once checked asked hostess if bar seating available she said yes  Mind bar literally 2 yards away them  Once turned saw absolutely no seats  let alone standing room    We wandered back them hostess turned back attend something instead asking wrong needed  finally sat waiting additional 10 minutes sat 10 tables available patio area    15 minutes later thought waiter zooming pass us  additional 15 minutes later   no waitress but nice busboy took drink orders  20 minutes later no drinks waitress  finally caved called manager apologized used excuse She serving Absinthe right now   rationalized she did start serving said Absinthe until 30 minutes seated  couple behind attended well    The waitress finally came over gave drinks without saying name greeting us  dirty martini watered down  Clearly left counter little ice flecks completely melted  Again no waitress sight ask fresh one  Eventually called manager over because getting ridiculous hadn't even seen food yet  He tried reason martini watered down  examining glass he saw amount condensation identical dead drink  replacement much better   Now food   We ordered oysters tacos  actual food appetizers combined size 1 smart phone  worst part taco tasted shelf bought tacos while oysters tasteless   The manager asked everything upfront but polite fact far below par  He half apologized gave annoyed look  disappointed restaurant  Among worst 10 dining experiences  saying something because things list going Bertrands finding

Bill $72 without tip gratuity before restaurant com certificate   And just small rant isn't Fleur's fault small girl hanging short railing along patio   inches away food  Staring breathing food   and parents said NOTHING! five minutes on!

Big enough share but    hungry person could conquer thing Portions huge which actually liked because able try appetizer main course dessert  Usually stuffed just entree! However if want spend little possible full probably isn't place you   Minus 1 star because 1 lobster mac cheese [as seen Top Chef Masters!!!] peking duck breast good but extraordinary 2 service lackluster  guy okay but he never smiled didn't act he cared all   PS came Restaurant com certificate <EOR> Being Bay Area regret visiting its sister restaurant SF  finally decided perfect time check Fleur de Lys once all   few months ago   Overall date both agreed everything fine but simply lacked umph I'd expect chef Keller's caliber take over edge  Sorry but gotta chalk was another overpriced spot along strip  execution fine but maybe its fact Vegas can't quite grow best ingredients produce money buy  If thats case money elsewhere   With current state economy more more chefs having tweak formulas re tool restaurants  Seems Mr  Keller agreed Fleur de Lys them recently shut down temporarily until later year reopen tapas restaurant  Good luck Mr  Keller! <EOR> The decor best aspect   TERRIBLE service  waiter could show wine list where anything was   He did fly everything ok without stopping  glass wine ordered corked  but nothing waiter   We ordered first soup then appetizer then meal   They rushed soup appetizer together busy night   asked them slow down but apparently don't know how  felt Applebees' services higher priced food    The food tapas  very small appetizer menu  octopus delicious onion soup   entrees all memorable  did bother dessert   Even decent service felt restaurant trading chef's name no hint august heritage  misuse brand name chef  or over extension name restaurant does meet standards  restaurant could survive without Hubert Keller name  <EOR> My husband Fleur few months ago   result cannot remember all ordered but mention highlights below   wanted restaurant SF but ready commit price point yet  thought why SF when restaurant com gc Vegas place?  First off server amazing! He didn't give any crap having restaurant com which some nicer places tend do   Second he funny checked right amount time   Food good timing able enjoy couple plates time next sets coming right when ready them   Also dished great presentation  Some come dry ice which always fun   The food fleur burger 5000    Yeah right! While would funny use coupon no way would order it!    Croque Monsieur thought going croquettes that's fault    okay but expected   waiter asked if liked told thought would be  He took away took off bill   replaced chicken croquettes which originally thought getting   lacked little bit flavor guess just ones home little bit better   Risotto freaking awesome   love Parmesan risotto did disappoint   Very strong bold favors   Tuna tacos pretty good    disappointing but nothing extra special them   Ceviche really enjoyed one   nice light great flavor   Chocolate souffle yummmmmmmmmy!  Overall really enjoyed overall dining experience ambiance   price point might little high without restaurant com but typical Vegas prices   Stop happy hour if catch good drink special! <EOR> Ahi Tuna Tacos start shells bit chewy   Flavor great  Caesar salad very tasty  Grace says white anchovies used very delicate and yummy perfect amount briny ness   Skirt steak take picture  Incredible flavor tender  Now accomplish both? Nice job! Grace both ordered skirt steak medium mine medium rare   Both came perfectly cooked but mine half thick kinda ripped off   ONLY minus night only reason 4 stars   Desert tiramisu blueberries raspberries strawberries   Awesome custard light creamy top perfectly browned! If creme brûlée itself cream killer! <EOR> I wanted try shower Mac Cheese based Top Chef challenge    but wanted Cheeseburger    over all solid flavors tasty seasoned fries great service great view people watch casino  <EOR> We came lunch  lunch selection pretty small    chose main chicken dish waitress mentioned most sought dishes   The food comes relatively slow wasn't very busy when there  When chicken saw some translucent thicker end  When ate jelly texture  told waitress thought chicken undercooked  She took back  She brought again same chicken noticed did nothing more perhaps microwave bake it basically re cooked it  high end restaurant expecting bit more  Additionally asked waitress side order fries  never them    soon know check no mention fries    2 stars only because spent 90$ three lunch entrees some drinks  expecting more  flavor acceptable service pretty good  <EOR> Our first night Vegas couldn't decide where eat  weren't starving but wanted something nibble on   couldn't made better decision!   We ordered sliders stuffed baby bell peppers French flat bread  All amazing  sliders best ever had  Perfectly cooked  Just perfection  stuffed baby bell peppers also very good although sliders definitely take win   Stuffed some sort walnut mix  Very good  Finally flat bread  Again another win! 1 criticism wish crust little crispier  But  personal preference    I can't say enough good things place  encourage go  <EOR> I came lunch group everyone bit disappointed dishes   loved onion soup served little steel pitcher perfectly flavored refreshing delicious   My chopped cobb salad pretty standard lettuce corn beans nice sliced avocado top   table mates complaining though turkey sandwiches other lunch dishes because portions small     Dinner guess would better?

Lobster mac cheese bland Barely any lobster taste    Sliders dry     Chimichurri steak only tasted oil chimichurri sauce no garlic herb taste  Meat cold upon arrival     Foie gras only decent item ordered   Cute plating   The other good thing $3 selected beer maybe happy hour deal?   Server took awhile table upon being seated   Also he forgot split drinks food seperate checks    Anyway reviews restaurant really great   which why confused why happened us!  want te food!! still would try fleur de lys   more shot! <EOR> The small plates provide great selection very good well creative  entrees well done but selection limited uninspired  short ribs skirt steak roasted chicken  liked food drinks fantastic but ambience if mall  I'd back but wouldn't seek out  food Mandalay generally mediocre best spots if need stay site  <EOR> Not bad overall!  food really wasn't cup tea but nothing quality fare   menu items tad bit pricey were   wine list pretty expansive made just okay food  <EOR> Great food good ambiance if seated back reasonable price given sophistication food preparation    The staff bit uppity wait staff particular hit miss like many restaurants but food almost always outstanding    Everything eaten Fleur prepared well  few times food warm I'd but busy  Lunch particularly good value here  <EOR> Made reservation seated promptly  burgers dry fries luke warm request water repeatedly  disappointed overall experience bit surprised  wine glass list solid did enjoy Champagne but overall lunch unfortunately less stellar  <EOR> Came brunch Sunday  exactly needed weekend Vegas before drive back LA  decor simple but elegant looking darker tones woods   waiter nice attentive    Hangover Angus Short Rib Benedict  amazing!! definitely heavier side but great hangover  Lots pulled short rib top thick crispy round hash brown potato cakes instead usual English muffin   egg top poached perfectly    Roasted Organic Chicken Breast  Generous portion chicken breast top red quinoa salad mixed fresh light vinaigrette  yummy well good choice lighter option   We also ordered Bloody Mary's which build your own style  bartender wheels over impressive cart various types vodka Bloody Mary mix tonnnn hot sauce options garnishes  all excited but  drinks turned kinda bleh  Maybe own fault though?

I lucky during Restaurant Week 3 course meal could afford   also lucky brother wife could sample food too   Everything tried outstanding   Especially appetizers!  Next time Vegas  definite stop even if breaks bank cuz know it'll bust your gut! <EOR> 4 5 stars little skeptical high reviews but now say spot on  fact such exceptional meal ended eating bar next night  Thus end trying 20+ items  knew would place right off bat when Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA along great bar snacks  others mention cant miss tuns tacos onion soup ravioli skirt steak etc  dish mentioned yet loved scallops never better cooked scallop   such ambitious menu surprised well executed everything was  Sure some dishes simple straightforward but others way beyond would typically find small plate tapas concept  Service great exception pacing food but between extensive menu two major conventions town restaurant being few weeks old understandable  would certainly put short list places Las Vegas  <EOR> The food good nothing exceptional but all better average  prices little high side but isn't Vegas?   We ordered Steak tartare very good  seasoned well  Sauteed shrimp bad  Served rich creamy spicy sauce quite SEASian inspired  Braised pork sliders meh   Skirt steak cooked well but chimmichurri disappointing bland Peking duck breast definitely peking duck  skin crispy n fat rendered off  but bad flavour wise Braised short rib very rich n deliciously tender  potatoes disappointing  Chocolate souffle very good Creme Brulee trio very good   Service quite dismal  hostess nice seated promptly food runners great describing every dish ordered BUT server pretty absent pompous  saw when ordered when she asked if wanted order more food when bill   it  No check back food even forgot meant order glass wine! all options Vegas hard justify going back   <EOR> Came hungry   Did Lion King prix fixe menu summer 2009 when  Lion King playing Vegas    Left happy   We soup duck crepe black truffle salmon fall apart tender roast celebration chocolate just divine  <EOR> I tasting menu wine pairing everything good   Nothing however stood exceptional   Maybe because restaurant located massive hotel strip Hubert feels he can't it   know he better dishes inside would experience them   Another negative price   top expensive tasting menu plus wine pairing pay special seating   Only Vegas      We did autographed burger books consolation  <EOR> We came splurge dinner Vegas  Although intended order 3 course menu $45 ended really splurging $90 menu disappointed   Everything excellent especially tuna tartare filet mignon chocolate souffle dessert   could perfect each course but suffice say everything excellent nothing disappointed     Here's really appreciated dinner Fleur de Lys  the little extra touches   amuse bouche   frequency which bread selections came around we eventually sampled all 6 different types bread all delish    excellence house wine   complimentary mini pastries made pastry chef   really extra mile sure experience worthwhile   only complaint service bit intrusive example someone came every course ask was   Other perfect place romantic splurge dinner Vegas  <EOR> No expectations came place  made reservations work dinner because close convention center thought located very convenient part Mandalay Bay  honest always past place thinking much but oh look restaurant party eight made reservations eight us  pretty hostesses led bar waited rest group  bartenders helpful   some chip shoulders  rudely asked move service area   understood way    but parents always taught say but say it! Some bartenders need register some customer service workshops   The place nice but first glance place looks casual  Some tables hug against main casino walkway isn't much privacy   We lucky enough seated inside  place nice but very small  service above average prices would expect restaurant caliber   Now onto food    food good  fleur burger which very tasty  expect fancy burger taste like  Im huge fan caramelized onions but gave burger little more ummphh bit more texture  solid B burger    It also came side potatoes slices their version French fries wasn't big fan  came small little cup didn't taste thoroughly cooked   If gonna give good burger please sure put much effort French fries well!

Also turns menu divided into Italian Spanish Japanese American maybe more country  would think easier cuisine really well  great paella before thought okay try dish each region  order paella Spain  small tapas size but entire dish salty   Hits souffle probably most ordered dessert restaurant  delicious  chocolate flavored dessert also comes beautiful scoop pistachio ice cream  also paired two scoop ice cream combo  MORE pistachio blood orange  both work chocolate  The seafood delicious! yellowtail sashimi oysters over bed marbles dry ice perfectly seared scallops  Wish entree sizes because wanted more! wait staff quite attentive asking everything if wanted more that the bread basic olive oil balsamic blend delicious  Simple good    I hope some entrees mark clearly menu  fine tapas but expecting fuller meal before found changes  Also there's only unisex bathroom  may take while your foot through door  <EOR> Came lunch weekday review based lunch dinner     I thought items ordered good  Shower mac cheese cheese sauce smooth small chunks lobster nice crumbly crust top   Steak Frites crust steak black salty fries interesting extra flavor maybe they're fried fat instead oil? As said before everything good but world amazing   waiter very honest when asked he recommended   According shouldn't order caesar salad field greens salad because anywhere   Also he said cuban sandwich plain vegetable sandwich   if come would avoid those items! <EOR> On latest trip Las Vegas decided dinner Hubert Keller's Fleur Mandalay Bay     They dining area front restaurant but opted seating restaurant   décor ambiance very modern classy   After checking menu decided order several small plates large plate finish off dessert  ordered Caesar salad parmesan lavash truffle anchovy    truffle pieces set apart ordinary Caesar  Ahi tuna tacos ponzu chantilly Serrano avocado cream   Three small tacos delicious   Could eaten couple more own  shower mac n cheese lobster brunoise vegetable   Delicious good amount lobster mixed in  Black angus sliders caramelized onions bacon frites   Two juicy sliders very juicy tasty  Guinness braised short ribs rainbow carrots pommee puree coffee foam   great flavors Guinness coffee foam   ribs tad dry  Grand Marnier soufflé orange crème anglaise orange cardamom ice cream   Wow amazing dessert   delicious down last drop   licking spoon   Service excellent   talking wine cellar waiter he even took tour cellar meal   cool!  Overall great overall meal   small plates able share all dishes   Heck even shared short rib entrée well  <EOR> I became acquainted Hubert through Top Chef love show!   realized he restaurant LV few years ago but wasn't able dine there   so made mission dine time!  As usual   I made reservations through OpenTable  arrived party 15 minutes early  wait reservation time  thought strange    never ran into situation where restaurant would seat early  Once seated   I looked around saw dinning pretty much empty  question is     why did wait 15 minutes??  The menu tapas style  similar way Asian culture eats but portions lot smaller   and more expensive  expectations very high  ordered special which included 3 course meal 4 tapas   For 3 course  fish tacos filet mignon creme brulee  For 4 tapas  foie gras corn soup scallops octopus   The most memorable foie corn scallops creme  foie could taste love attention put plate  sauce sorbet   it something never before  corn soup equivalent lobster bisque Capital Grille  Creamy light but definitely share if want try other things! scallops came bowl smoke covering it  could taste smoke sweetness scallop  also tomato water   smells tomato but doesn't really taste  creme brulee hands down best far  Smooth light  did feel guilty afterwards!  The low meal octopus  tender but really salty sauce reminded jarred pasta sauce  Sorry! But truth    wish ordered shrimp dish instead   Service great  Food spectacular  think need dust place because halfway through dinner allergies kicked up  wish more light just personal preference   hostess confused bit 15 minute wait   again never told wait when arrive early reservation   especially when clearly room restaurant   I would give 3 if bad mood  look forward dinning again  Maybe sit outside people watch next time haha  <EOR> Had burger blue cheese  overcooked  lot people working but service lacking slow  ok  burger smaller side tad dry  I'd suggest going somewhere else  <EOR> Delish food Frenchy chef flowing white locks DJs side?  Oui please!  My sister hubs wanted try place since they're fans Hubert Keller stint Top Chef Masters booked late dinner Vegas trip few weeks ago  Although restaurant closes 10 30PM assured simply deadline put your food order which nice since arrived 9 45PM didn't want feel rushed     We ordered almost everything stamped Keller's favorite menu yes no problem being tourist he did steer wrong  White Onion Soup kindly split into shot glasses party could share without any awkwardness nice touch LOVED it!  Creamy pitch perfect onion flavor your tastebuds going   wanted boat load more   Grilled Octopus Tender octopus good Spanish flavors   Angus sliders Tasty bites can't wrong caramelized onions bacon   Fleur Burger don't know thinking ordering sliders house specialty burger #burgermonsters but phenomenal   wanted order foie gras truffles $35 extra but table mates objected gluttonously wanting buy $70 burger   Boo hoo fair enough 'cause when came burger utterly delicious rich due juicy wagyu beef meaty abalone mushroom top satisfying decadent without add ons   Lomo Saltado steak cooked perfectly medium rare good sear subtle glaze but particular show stopper   Strangely enough all loved Peruvian fried rice came side which hadn't paid much attention when ordering   Dessert Orange Souffle Nothing ordinary but very well executed classic french soufflé cream sauce pleasantly finished off meal    The decor bit wonky feeling mall ish exposed brick giant painting blonde big boobed woman negligee head cut off overlooks dining room that but food star really hit spot! <EOR> We awesome meal here  Lump crab cantaloupe sauce YUM! Then some scallops seared perfection truffle lasagna double YUM YUM! desert caramel plate good  Service right only Vegas able wear flip flops Fleur de Lys  <EOR> Not worth money horrible every way especially value   really expected more Hubert Keller restaurant but maybe caught them bad day   <EOR> I'd give 4 5 but since Yelp forces choose am going round down simply because few small things would critique usual price meal even small critiques matter lot   restaurant com gift certificate which accepted no fuss feel excellent value money but since average person probably paying menu price am proceeding standard   We opted stay small plates maximize number things try   small plates menu divided region sampled ahi tuna tacos tarte flambe twice far favorite vegetable tempura two other items can't remember   tempura most disappointing did match menu description no better you'd find average Japanese restaurant   cocktails excellent blood orange margarita fleurtini both light refreshing but still immensely satisfying certainly lacking liquor!  Service fairly formal which fits tenor restaurant but doesn't leave much say other fine   would happy come back especially if Mandalay Bay area but think would lunch dinner unless able hands another good discount coupon voucher  <EOR> Food fantastic   If complaint would some plates come 3's instead 4's   4 people when 3 sliders came   person sat out   But      Again food fantastic   foie gras truly perfect   Service acceptable kitchen little slow  <EOR> OMG!  fun   Best staff ever   husband FDL anniversary dinner last night   tapas special where every tapas menu $99   also add every dessert additional $15   assumed would amuse bouche size bites but full tapas serving which actually bigger tapas    First seated told waitress wanted   She said normally only serve Tapas patio but she would check manager   very accommodating left where were   then stopped ordering two tapas tasting menus because would much food   WHAT?  saved $115   Mu husband doesn't eat pork offered substitutions two pork items him   food delicious but VERY RICH as might expect French influenced cuisine  Truffle popcorn amazing huge portion but drenched butter even though only second dish brought couldn't finish it   onion soup literally fantastic   Four little tasting cups come per serving   Ahi tuna tartare good but heavy dressing fish flavor little lost   rock shrimp noodles very spicy  husband felt shrimp overcooked  I thought OK   Chimichurri flank steak amazing the silky chimichurri marinated grass fed flank served medium rare outstanding   charcuterie plate Delicious portion huge!  husband short ribs he loved them   Delicate wonderful hearts palm salad   tossed green salad also yummy  husband two glasses wine cocktail flight three fruity mini martinis    sweet string presented beautifully    brought 7 desserts an extra anniversary which ate bit each because stuffed  Best all service unbelievably good   main waitress packed food without asking at high end restaurant where would embarrassed ask that   great time would back flash   Total bill $227 alcohol $50 extra entree $42     think $115 could all food quality service unbelievable  <EOR> LAS VEGAS RESTAURANT WEEK!!!  $20 00 3 course lunch!!!

wanted compliment service   waitress asked if show mentioned flight   Rather two three hour experience great delivering dishes promptly   Although would great over many hours really way accommodating without even having ask   Although entree menu also small plates separated territory   friends shared several  Ahi tuna tacos   love tuna tuna perfect   crispy taco very neat touch   Black angus sliders   Maybe highlight dinner   While everyone sliders days fantastic   Larger would expected caramelized onions bacon came together wonderfully meat   Tarte flambee   Probably most disappointing dish   No flambee overall much flavor over bread   Seared foie gras   love good foie gras foie gras prepared perfectly other highlight evening   BBQ pork ribs   dish often bad small plates restaurants done perfectly Fleur   Ribs tender flavorful meaty   Pork belly fried rice   Okay another highlight evening   Surprisingly pork belly made dish great but flavor rice   Green papaya carpaccio   tarte weaker dishes   Just much flavor carpaccio did come through   Brownie lollipops  am big sweets person but very popular table   With Julian Serrano two fantastic options small plates Vegas   Both fantastic Fleur maybe little more consistent but some great dishes both places  <EOR> Dinner Review      Note star rating     gave Fleur five stars  might ask why given some dishes as explained below just okay reason other dishes really really good  Ultimately judge restaurants food based whether remember them     definitely remember beef tartare tacos veloute ricotta gnocchi   addition service excellent   Had dinner Fleur before seeing Le Reve Wynn  Decided tasting menu Tastes Around World which reasonably priced in relative sense given much easily pay other celebrity chef restaurants around Las Vegas     four courses plus dessert amounting ten dishes added escargot boot Course 1 1  Beef Tartare Tacos Terrific dish  big fan beef tartare taco shells added texture beef great    2  Truffled Beef Carpaccio Good dish  But same other good restaurants bad any means     again good dish just necessarily memorable   Course 2 3  White Onion Soup Veloute Terrifc dish again  personal favorite memorable way beef carpaccio might be veloute rich creamy trace truffle   4  Gyoza Mediocre dish   least favortie dish gyozas somewhat uninspired neither pillowy ness boiled dumplings crispy skin potstickers    Course 3 5  Ricotta Gnocchi Braised Short Rib Very good dish  really enjoyed gnocchi and lot lately     favorite being Osteria Mamma Los Angeles especially nice pan sear short ribs also tasty   6  Grilled Octopus Okay dish  quite good gnocchi but better gyoza   Court 4 7  Grilled Skirt Steak Lyonnaise Very good dish  steak cooked well as properly burnt death     always enjoy steak potatoes   8  Diver Scallop Good dish  Nicely cooked scallops but don't remember pork belly   9  Ratatouille Very good dish   really enjoyed ratatouille recall another review saying vegetables mushy but found whole dish spot on   Dessert 10  Brioche Beignets Terrific dish  Light fluffy pilows goodness     again thought beignets terrific but word caution set expectations different beignets might expect Cafe Du Monde    Additional Dish 11  Escargot Good dish  Friend never snails added order good dish but also don't eat snails often enough add any insight   Service Service friendly professional nothing but good things say staff    Atmosphere Comfortable dining room upscale but still casual feel   more casual try food court fine dining try Aureole next door  <EOR> I $70 Kobe burger toped fogra black truffels This good your birthday Christmas fourth July all having orgy your mouth  Its clear never anything good life its funny burger    <EOR> The nitrogen cocktail really phenomenal  really love tapas style sharing food everyone table  favorite dishes steak tartare new York steak  croquet monsieur pretty yummy too  fish dish nothing special  pork schnitzel blah  cocktail menu includes various kinds Absinthe very interesting  <EOR> We LOVE Fleur    We Fleur many times including during restaurant week  food always delicious but during restaurant week if because you'll try some really fun creative dishes    Every time husband Fleur love order wonderful experience  wait staff always attentive kind  ambiance very warm relaxed inviting  prefer sit inside restaurant rather near bar  it's more enjoyable away casino foot traffic    Fleur serves small plates but also order normal meal  aren't tapas fans usually order steaks which always cooked perfectly   We saw Mr  Keller himself walk kitchen first time ate real thrill chance compliment chef <EOR> Looks hippest place Mandalay Bay   may be   The service curt which suppose understandable considering clientele menu extremely limited   I never forgot however worst cheese ever encountered   love sharp pungent cheeses   If isn't some mold ready yet   even hold breath when necessary deaden odor decay   But whatever stuff should come bloody warning require sign waiver liability  <EOR> I cannot express paper  immense professionalism class exulted Chef Laurent while Las Vegas last week  father worked industry entire life seen fair share snobby arrogant chefs  chef person Chef Laurent league own when comes personal attention he pays people work  tasting menu ate Fleur best meal life  Chef provided inexplicable unforgettable experience  <EOR> It's awhile since but remember cocktails phenomenal ahi tuna tacos   atmosphere rear nice ask seated back away look e lous tromping through casino  <EOR> I excited try Hubert Keller's of Top Chef fame famous restaurant Vegas  full tasting menu mostly food did disappoint Amuse Bouche Unfortunately forgotten served amuse perhaps testament amuse bouche being forgettable    Truffled Onion Soup Duck Ragout Black Truffles 2 words = Simply Divine! 5 stars excellent dish    I'd come back over over this   Filet Mignon Topped Sautéed Foie Gras Black Périgord Truffles Red Wine Essence Another great dish combining 3 favorite elements filet mignon foie gras black truffles   only complaint sauce foie gras bit salty taste  All all though worth additional $25   Pan Seared Alaskan Halibut Shiitake Macaroon White   Pan Seared Duck Breast Chestnut Puree Onion Ginger Gastrique 4 stars  bad  puree interesting combination terms taste + texture  duck bit salty  liked presentation course   Passion fruit coconut sorbet streusel crust coconut soup tapioca balls strawberry kiwi plantain 3 stars  wasn't bad  tasted bit some Asian desserts before    Dessert Trio Peanut Butter Milkshake + Chocolate Fondant Cake + Canal Bailey's ice cream crushed peanut butter brittle 3 5 stars  peanut butter milkshake bit rich but liked Bailey's ice cream  addition crushed peanut butter brittle flash brilliance   Tray Chocolates finished generous assortment chocolates truffles house  bad but nothing write home about   Whew! ton food   There thousands fresh pink roses wall which server said changed daily  He retrieved presented pink rose which keep    Service general however wasn't great  expected pampered bit more given price range establishment but table somewhat neglected times  Also took almost hour wait between some courses food came making 3 hour long meal    Summary truffled onion soup filet mignon foie gras reason giving place 4 stars  Minus star service few mediocre courses  Total bill = $200 2  <EOR> Nothing restaurant came together me  only thing really truly enjoyed carpaccio steak tartare promise being good being mixed tableside waiter customer's taste but desperately need salt  pork belly lo mein overly sweet belly just sat flabby fatty self no acid anything cut it  just sweetness starch fat far much all those things  Dessert probably ok forgot must bad    Food aside experience leaves lot desired  spent some time trying figure place is  Bar seating flanks outside restaurant sort chairs nearly impossible push unless some kind weird half seated tiptoe thing bar where people may choose stand sense restaurant don't  place setting missing fork which inexcusable price point  Drink orders completely bizarre involving picking selection iPad which then turn around show server actually place order  Why can't just send order bar directly app? actually takes more time normal cocktail list  would sense wine where want sure your selection communicated clearly but doesn't work all here   It also doesn't help beautiful interior you're still sitting casino there's some dude bar outside whose idea Vegas Vince Vaughn movies 90's all shouting along it   There few good points but they're hard pick otherwise bizarre experience  Concentrate less whimsy more food place might work  <EOR> Being Vegas gives really good options visit well known chef's restaurant   Most big names place strip   think am pretty basic guy satisfied most if all places eat last review buffet okay?   would also say mind set probably focused around statement such why would want pay much meal? good value true but sometimes pay for   place great!  Breakfast probably favorite meal day also least know breakfast lunch more reasonably priced dinner double score    Fleur opens 11am Mandalay Bay   Upon being seated realize beautifu place sure walk around whole restaurant snap some pictures   ordered Carnitas Hash outstanding   Everything plate cooked perfection just right amount char seasoning while plated very beautifully   time didn't mind waiting Yelp Elite S O  take fill food pictures before meal because taking pictures too  S O  ordered Fleur Omelet stuffed asparagus tomatoes mozzarella   tasting some dish restrain myself stealing all crispy potato cakes to call tater tots would calling race car daily driver    typically cannot eat restaurant tomatoes because tasteless but case Very flavorful   wait staff really friendly professional would expected but don't always get did great job Bravo!

Love small plates   maybe restaurant would able compete Joel Rubuchon's L'Atelier   ?  No   even same league   We ask sit inside assumed would quieter patio area opposite loud rock band murdering some old classics across walkway   Instead find room dominated large crowd obnoxiously loud guests clearly much chagrin all other guests restaurant   hostess just laughs fact chose come inside louder there   The wait staff much more impressive   waitress somewhat apathetic   between courses table did cleaned drops sauce various crumbs just continued build up   table bussed between courses seemed staff expected eat fish dishes using fig jam covered silverware off dirty plates   When complaints food see below no acknowledgement problem let alone apology   also ordered 7 dishes only ever received 6 them     All could overlooked food spectacular but not   very much doubt Hubert Keller would put kind food he himself clearly problems quality control     By dishes The fig flambee which flatbread knew?  Just assumed flambee french menu meant flamed   Would nice if mentioned when ordered it dominated goat cheese fig battling attention pancetta essentially non existant    The tartar bland clearly seen hint seasoning even addition accompanying sauces etc  meat appeared somewhat low quality itself  The seared shrimp OK   Nice heat shrimp cooked well   The hamachi opinion best dish night foam outstanding pickled shiitake sumptuous  The salt wings fantastic but whole bunch those same price local Thai restaurant  Then came risotto soon arrived table wanted hold plate upside down over head clearly way stiff   Tried anyway tasted bland mush leaves added   Underseasoned no creaminess all just horribly overcooked   send dish back   Thankfully took off tab   All all wouldn't bother going back unless heard quality control problems addressed   When paying $70 head deserve better much better strip    P S   Just checked rating graph Fleur getting great reviews until beginning September which time ratings plummeted   Coincidence?  think not   changed Hubert?

Because far tell over 700 other reviewers taken novelty missing something   two dishes actually genuinely liked heirloom beet chocolate bar dessert which almost silken texture intriguing flavor  green papaya carpaccio appetizers which very tangy bright   don't know happened rest menu     The grilled skirt steak lyonnaise great first couple bites but soon realized overabundance sickeningly sweet red wine jus which overwhelmingly drenched everything underneath   potatoes  soaked singly potato y thing left them   jus free spot remaining anything edible    The szechuan beef tartare truly horrible   first time tartare where strikingly aware eating raw beef   no other flavor despite being mixed tableside spices expeditor   asked spicy wanted said very he added ton still tasted nothing but raw beef    The duroc pork belly lo mein entirely much lo mein sweet salty fatty saucy everything while still tasting anything decent!

Most everything else found underwhelming hummus baba ganoush sad  If recommendation would order this  baba blended puree overwhelming flavor chili powder? am sure but did any smoky beautiful flavor eggplant  tempted send back  little bread triangles nothing special hummus just passable delicious  gnocchi solid but then artichokes little over cooked perhaps  little freshness choke missing   The presentations okay but times cheesy  When oysters first arrived dry ice smoke swirling first reaction cool! Then looking glass rocks big blades seaweed thought little odd  Stick solid colored stone perhaps smooth white lose seaweed maybe then feel little less Miami Vice    Our waitress bit brusque rushed  If think sliver second wanted if question she seemed bothered  Perhaps she large section cover but way made nervous!  If busy night may want avoid patio seating gets loud hear nearby lounge singers belting Barbie World ? interior does offer nice cozy seating groups order feast which pretty much everything menu 435  saw party 6 guys attempt told waitress halt food because stuffed! also offer absinthe service 9 options cheapest $25    Overall little value average price tapas being $12  $5000 wagyu Fleurburger foie gras truffle 1995 bottle Chateau Petrus  spent around $150 sad see money go  wouldn't plan full meal but maybe if snack two best things menu fun light bite! <EOR> An absolutely wonderful dining experience  tried almost everything menu everything fantastic  Each dish brings uniqueness leaves wanting more more  Killer food affordable price great wine  Perfection  <EOR> Keller day disservice day give red meat   which never    A lot people Top Chef restaurant hunting  afraid those people occasionally since old room mate loves show    I wish could back relive experience  Excellent service  highlight night definitely seared foie gras  miss you! steak also amazing but else expect?

We also tried braised beef sliders nothing special some korean bbq ribs great flavor but chewy almost spit them out  Now meal point disappointing but then all changed  Hubert Keller came through dining room checked every table! He sweet posed pictures people  When he stopped table friend Lauren asked if he could serve souffle  He agreed without skipping beat    Now little history never souffle because perfect man waiting right one  Souffles delicate done poorly wanted first real french master disappointed  Before souffle served complimentary birthday dessert brownie bites banana cupcakes  adorable but nothing spectacular    My friend Lauren creme brulee stunning! thought sure going much custard enough crunchy delicious sugar topping but raspberry pistachio vanilla some best had  love vanilla definitely something special one  Then came highlight meal Hubert served souffle even prepped front me  He also bought which incredibly thoughtful  souffle stunning he predicted am now addicted them!   Overall food disappointing but personal theory french chef excel french food tapas  niche obvious  desserts stunning would back dessert anytime  Hubert Keller did disappoint he sweet friendly accommodating  couldn't wipe smile off face days! Thanks great experience Hubert! <EOR> Only stopped drinks bar but can't Blood Orange Margarita mind    sooo good! definitely back dine! <EOR> Everything perfect!  The evening decor staff drinks food friends    I 3 course dinner option complaint   3 other people pretty well covered menu everything cooked presented tasted great!  cannot wait next visit Las Vegas perhaps San Francisco again   Well worth experience  <EOR> recent stay Mandalay Bay nightmare!! Thankfully experience Fleur Hubert Keller located Mandalay Bay quite opposite  food ABSOLUTELY AMAZING   husband foodies!  am picky eater doesn't care far box sad know    hesitant try type restaurant   husband's first concern no salt shaker table   lol  Our meal consisted       Pan con tomate toasted ciabatta tomato garlic manchego $7 ciabatta bread just melted your mouth fresh tomato which usually HATE divine manchego cheese perfect choice   Prime tomahawk rib eye 40oz well done shallot jus $95 BEST steak ever eaten   Well done isn't easy but cooked perfection   plate HUGE could fed family four it   Upon first bite thought going salty but mistaken   flavors just blend together melt your mouth   Fingerling pomme puree truffle jus $8 WOW says all!!

Marble potato shallot butter $ 8 More WOW tender flavorful   We skipped desert only because full steak potatoes   But sure would disappointed either   Needless say husband no need salt shaker only concern now found food liked better and he's great cook   P S  leftovers didn't even survive night!!  Next time you're Vegas give Fleur try even if you're meat potatoes kind girl guy SIMPLY AMAZING!!! <EOR> SKIP    I happy hour few friends recently  food pricey bland drinks and particularly strong worth money  But service really unhappy with    The busboy spilled beer ALL over boyfriend like drenched jeans shoes  If would mortified apologetic  He just said very apathetic Oh sorry like he bumped chair walked off  Like meh happens whatcha gonna do  spilled beer end world but when you're traveling brought pair jeans SUCKS someone completely soak 1 uncomfortable all night 2 smell stale old drunk rest your vacation    The good actually    let's call barely okay manager did come over replaced beer  also paid shoes cleaned but ONLY because boyfriend demanded since otherwise shoes going ruined  Apart bringing new beer because completely empty now! napkins did nothing seem trying it    The bad brought bill over charged boyfriend beer! called them waitress said Oh yeah because replaced it  Aka replaced beer spilled second one  Yes because HE DIDN'T DRINK ANY FIRST BECAUSE DUMPED *ON LAP*  fact didn't even comp drink not mention anyone else ridiculous waitress seemed genuinely shocked would even think should have  Seriously? understand low cost restaurant comp drink? When wouldn't let waitress said Oh guess take off  When she brought bill back she did super fake sorry hope great night blah blah blah fake nice stuff when you've just realised you're probably getting really shitty tip  Aka little late fake niceness  I would never back  fact spilled drink happens  more attitude  don't care when restaurants screw handle it  clearly place where know they're casino business no matter they're really concerned customer's experience  <EOR> I feel silly realizing Tapas style place when boyfriend excited inexpensive some delicious sounding items were  super late hungry but wanted something would unique being Top Chef fan really excited trying Hubert Keller place!  When saw 5000 dollar burger menu knew something asked server which she shyly replied don't call tapas here  boyfriend immediately weary but still pretty excited try good food!  The best way describe some food whimsical boyfriend chicken croquettes skirt steak which said came fingerling potato  When came literally *one* fingerling potato made look mini baked potato  kind laugh moment but more sad laughter  understand chef trying dishes tad more affordable average person but single fingerling? didn't know whether joke admired weirded by   Same dishes wish ordered few more things but some fried chickpeas gnocchi  While *definitely* best gnocchis before only four plated  Really brief dish hard appreciate when theres little remember!  However desserts definitely some favorite during trip  loved cheesecake lollipops beautiful tasted amazing coated white chocolate gingerbread checkered short bread cookie fresh strawberry puree dipping sauce  also creme brule sampler Cookie dough Lavender Earl Grey  creamy light meant eaten slowly    We also given complimentary lobster mac cheese but neither eat fish bittersweet moment! totally loved gesture though   I am against idea tapas but think should re evaluate plating bit more giving due steep prices  would rather tried Bouchon but serendipity left Fleur's door  Definitely good light meal however  <EOR> Fleur de Lys your typical LV restaurant   extremely glitzy huge fan fare but little no substance   dcor without doubt very luring seductive matched friendly staff   level service very impressive hostess bartenders waiters   When comes food appetizers wonderful menu wide array selection   However when comes main course leaves little disappointed   typical sin city sucker bright lights excitement but leaving feel little sucker   If hit big tables money now no object Fleur de Lys place you  <EOR> Came dinner before going Michael Jackson Cirque Du Solei show loved it!  You pork belly fried rice! shrimp dish pork ribs just delicious  dad loves tripe he dish said really great lean meat though bit spicy   I heard lot people talking lobster mac cheese but didn't really care it  Maybe because already eaten much food  wasn't bad just wasn't wow many reviews said   Definitely check out!!! <EOR> Well good time  Went Mother's Day  Nice slow when right before dinner rush  All servers paying full attention  Great bunch people work there  Julio Javier server  Cant remember name sure all wine parings did that  But he great!  So being first time decide 2 person 4 course wine paring   Was really nice   1st course Ahi tuna tacos did try am allergic Along beef carpaccio wrapped around thai salad next smudge sriracha sauce  Paired sparkling wine  am pretty sure beef carpaccio best things night  would thought raw meat would pleasant    2nd course White onion soup toasted bread wonderful fantastic fatty fat bone marrow  Next little cup sautéed red onions  Spread all bread enjoy soup  paired sweet Riesling  Sweet creamy onions all over dish  come back prob again   3rd course Shrimp grits  grits warm cream cheese concoction shrimp  BBQ tomato sauce nice smokey  plate indescribable octopus  mom said reminded octopus she would eat Greece  Something mom would cook! She told grandmother beating ink octopus rock back yard  This dish paired really good French Chardonnay  think favorite wine ALL   It should ended there  But last course maybe least favorite  4th course Skirt steak garlic fries  ok nothing special  Sauce ok kind undefined  In question why didn't mac n cheese see other reviews     scallops green aioli sauce great loved mini veggies  Ate up    Actually took most steak just pretty full all wine damn   Everything good though just full red meat don't usually eat much it    Dessert Beignets raspberry sauce vanilla  Very charming  Paired dessert wine   All all great  sat good spot watch people walk laugh drink really good wine  favorite thing surprisingly bone marrow! good  Also liked carpaccio  Id again but lunch! <EOR> BEST MOJITO ever had!!!
