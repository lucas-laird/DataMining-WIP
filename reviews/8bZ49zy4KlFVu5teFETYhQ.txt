Gorgeous atmosphere!  I am going start review Wild Sushi incredible service   came Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm   walked carrying arm load books am Nursing program CSN promptly greeted man think owner   told just eat lots studying done   He sat own section away middle room where bit noisy   He took drink appetizer order before knew sitting front me!  water refilled often allowed delay order bit   Towards end dining experience over heard waitress tell next waitress through shift change bother much trying study but refill water often!  Really 5 star service!  often between classes just service!  Oh yeah food great too!  salmon sashimi comes huge martini glass tastes wonderfully fresh   also order spicy tuna which wasn't crazy but sometimes just spicy!  many rolls mind boggling!   menu dinners noodles many other traditional dishes   can't wait try more! <EOR> **This review based customer service only! But experience don't even want know sushi taste    Rude hostess!!!!

VK Las Vegas <EOR> I've having nigiri sushi lately tonight decided some rolls instead   driven Wild number times seen ad saying 50% off all rolls all day every day   generally shy away places may increase prices only offer 50% off but reading Yelp reviews decided give Wild try   I ordered two rolls  the baked Langostino lobster California roll Kiss Fire   menu describes baked langostino roll baked baby lobster mushroom dynamite sauce Cali roll Kiss Fire Inside Shrimp tempura spicy shrimp cucumber  Ouside spicy soft shell crab albacore jalapeno topping extra spicy ponzu sauce   Both excellent   presentation great any good sushi place should have   flavors lobster mixed California roll very good   Kiss Fire aptly named   spicy seasonings gave kiss fire well small fire   found rolls good way used no soy sauce but merely used wasabi   almost finished portion brought almost asked more could more fire myself   another reviewer said use small amount rice   isn't huge amount used roll look bigger take place other ingredients     I few more rolls try list but decided pig but stop two some dessert   order tempura red bean ice cream   pleasant ending good meal   three servers circulating through restaurant wasn't very busy   attentive even bringing check asked if wanted another iced tea   I really liked decor restaurant   fan sitting sushi bars come learn sat table   music reggae  odd sushi house  and big screen TV ESPN's Sports Nation   amazing good ESPN when don't listen word drivel they're saying   TV mute watched plays chatting tapped feet  music   I'll back try some other rolls  <EOR> A Living Social deal brought Thursday night intensive work session  sat bar just favorite food    sushi! unagi albacore pretty fresh but other quality good  Everything just spicy roll wise couldn't eat it! There's pretty large selection specialty rolls choose but am more nigri person  Service attentive weren't busy rainy Thursday night  Overall think bill came 50 something bucks Living Social Deal taken out  almost worth just your favorite AYCE point but lunch special dinner specials might worth try  <EOR> Worst dining experience State Nevada  took hour half six rolls two teriyaki bowls which apparently owner didn't even realize offered  Very small rolls half price still much  <EOR> I really struggled overall rating Wild Sushi Grill  They've some really strong positives going them really fresh fish very reasonable prices nice presentation food clean inviting decor but some pretty irritatingly strong negatives slowwww service rude management   Wild Sushi could extremely successful if improved people part equation since already shown knack business side   They definitely earned 3 stars quality food fresh flavorful artistically presented price quality quantity very fair $11 sushi combo 6 nigiri California roll spicy tuna roll miso soup side salad having clean attractive venue freshly decorated vaulted ceiling big screen projection TV killer jazz band weekends    However knock off 2 big stars woefully inadequate people skills  Minus star slow waitress #1 inattentive waitress #2 yes Wild Sushi seems knack switching waitresses described other Yelp reviews   top off management extremely rude obvious think customers completely gullible suckers  mentioned jazz band weekends really good mean REALLY good  Good enough want pay see them perform jazz club like awesome Anthology San Diego CA   ask waitress #2 if could any information regarding band name band could contact them website phone email etc    waitress kindly owner manager pass request could see give scowl frown said something length her  She came back apologized said owner doesn't know contact jazz band he doesn't know wouldn't pass questions band  However owner relayed if did band could only see them coming restaurant weekends!
