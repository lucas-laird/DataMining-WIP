Management <EOR> The people work extremely rude  don't say hello barely act want take your order  Don't even wait thank end your transaction  only come when need coffee drive back LA    I'm thinking going find another coffee spot! <EOR> Went tonight usually pretty good but tonight terrible  ordered tacos ok but cheddar potato wedges just wedges no cheese bacon but maybe wedge  jack jr ordered cheese extra pickles mayo looked sitting around hours bun soggy whole thing cold  only positive two free egg rolls cause didn't full order even over cooked!!! <EOR> Well quality food diminished since last time 2008 impressed cleanliness restaurant quality food  french fries  undercooked burger overcooked overall definitely looking forward to  Next time visit Vegas definitely stop eat <EOR> It long since did review feel badly am doing Jack Box  Especially since done year ago same location    But experience today bad feel needed documented  I arrived 5 05pm  two people front register  When man ordering finished cashier manager walked away without saying anything  few minutes passed she still gone  2nd line stepped Kiosk place order  Smart thinking part waiting till cashier back break or maternity leave    My order placed waited waited waited  Being tall made easy look display monitor see order little over 10 minutes  But kept waiting waiting   At 15 minutes flagged down Drive Thru cashier  told obvious getting food could money back? She called manager back she needed refund then looked back said your food ready  want ? told would take food   She scrambled moment then told manager she better give refund   After couple minutes pushing buttons given money back without apology even explanation why wasn't getting food instead  did snotty comment them being short help she needed give cook break  Seemed odd cook gets break 5pm dinner hour dining room closes but brother says can't argue minimum wage    I home began cooking dinner  cooked took online survey talktojackinthebox[dot]com gave pretty bad review  Oddly enough little problem slow service time  gripe poor way complaint handled    Now total shocker  under 5 hours submitting online form received call store's General Manager  first thought would impressed just important feedback them  might assume someone corporate office saw called GM home deal it  thinking #@ # calling 9 48pm ?  Being restaurant more 20 minutes without single employee acknowledging suspect touch customers  Calling 12 minutes ten talk just proves it   So Jack summary love commercials but customer service worse deplorable  If being short help problem everything power assist you  NEVER returning your restaurants need less staff therefore no longer short help  Problem solved! <EOR> Visited location 8 22  great way end drunken night  location food extra hot <EOR> This jack always great!
