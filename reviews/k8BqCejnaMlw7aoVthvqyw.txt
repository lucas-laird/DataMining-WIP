Wife daughter vegetarian lasagna  Would return? Only if area  worth special trip there  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised place   father visiting hankering lasagna decided since pretty close where live   much nicer inside would think 24 hour restaurant bar    bar area pretty big dining area even larger   dress seemed casual but place very classy vibe made feel under dressed jeans   The food really pretty great dad wasn't impressed lasagna but dinner Maria's Saltimbocca great!  also piano player dining room took requests pretty awesome amount spent! <EOR> I've 3 times fell love first time because cheese ravioli garlic bread amazing!  second time just good because same thing   boyfriend seafood pasta good   it waaaay salty   Well   we hadn't 5 months forgotten bad experience apparently did he   other night service great usual but food entirely tooooo salty   manicotti tasted strange typical manicotti   boyfriend's meat ravioli salty he couldn't eat it   nor could I   Unfortunately won't going again   great place drink lounge friends since frequently entertainment   very charming place  <EOR> Went Sunday night 40s 50s 60s live music playing   Great place bring date some wine enjoy live music   Food really good but little salty  <EOR> I really loved everything place! fiance came whim trying other restaurants Saturday night long wait times  walked sat immediately  server told history restaurant showed some house's best dishes! watched couple different singers perform while ate garlic bread delicious enjoyed cocktails also delicious    We started calamari both thought better most! Maria's Saltimbocca  Very rich but very delicious! fiance chicken parmesan really liked well    It little pricier anticipated but definitely worth every penny! back! <EOR> We stopped dinner Sunday night around 11pm  atmosphere reminded old Vegas very nostalgic  food wonderful portions huge even though late night lighter menu   waiter also very nice  <EOR> Ohh gosh! surprise place was! friend thinking would fun dive  wad actually very good  food delicious! place super dark but loved reminded dark smoky piano bars grampa used love minus smoke  definitely  come back <EOR> my family drove Las Vegas restaurant  wanted away glam couple hrs  everything perfect  decor rich history food service amazing  beer selection wasn't best but family already burned no biggie  definitely plan come back  <EOR> Great food ambiance exception inattentive server Roger  If wasn't would've given solid five star experience  <EOR> Calamari great bread  Other didn't meal  picked house salad  Dressings tarty lacked flavor  daughter picked pasta bowl  Tbe kicker when waitress asked meal told she didn't it  While she offered another pasta bowl  daughter unable eat anything dairy  she told okay well pack eat later  Really??? She didnt now  males think she's going eat later  Long story short wont back cost $50 1 adult 2 children  only house salad  <EOR> This goal  heard good reviews over years Bootlegger Bistro but visit Wednesday evening 10 00 pm good several reasons    1  First very good part  history Bootlegger alive well walls decor  sat old booths where apparently many early Las Vegas icons may sat fun chat about  But better yet or more video monitors plays continuous clips Las Vegas 60s 70s again fun entertaining   2  Now unfortunately food simply bland  No Italian bistro should bland food any point fundamental flaw 'the kiss death ' When Italian place serves generic tasting sauce time those TV shows enter picture accomplish some major changes   3  ordered Eggplant Parmigiana chicken dish Pollo All Angelo  Each ours dishes no taste other series generic ingredients canned type placed together heated  pasta bit undercooked but okay   4  point two servers both disappeared 5 minutes another group came in  bartender 'quietly' yelling i e  arms frustration looking all making gestures along some additional bar guests seated nearby   5  Unexplainable part  ordered Coke normal  Then middle dinner ordered another refill strangely different much more syrup like   6  sum food sincerely dislike saying bland every point service fast food meaning adequate but intermittent definitely but atmosphere pleasant  Unfortunately nearly enough return  would rather eat great food dive 'hole wall '  7  some other reviews see highly suspect two possibly being 'affiliated' place  words just seem simplistic case broad another  Now if hear new management improved menu some point may re visit but no time soon    Strange thought knowing many famous people eaten Bootlegger prior locale hearing place well decades looking forward good dinner wife  simply failed  irony just shared wife Olive Garden doesn't essentially cook anything no grills but uses microwaves re heat all pre packaged items sent each store  <EOR> I love pretty much everything Bootlegger Bistro  love old timey lounge acts singing piano early evenings love weird eclectic group twenty somethings come late night seem no good    Food pretty good especially late night place  really pizza Baked Penne  Although Pollo Angelo probably favorite  Delicious chicken sautéed olives artichoke hearts mushrooms  Yummy!!  Early 3pm 5pm late night dining specials     This great place meet drink catch friends  loud crazy  Usually nice relaxing there's usually pretty good people watching action  <EOR> The hostess said people come pizza ordered it  Very disappointing say least  dough pre made likely frozen crispy coming back  <EOR> I would give 3 stars unnecessary sass bartender  She acted though party 7 ordering drinks empty bar nuisance  She seemed irritated if someone wasn't sure wanted immediately   The food saving grace  Seafood Diavolo divine  Packed seafood came extra spicy asked  main gripe Italian restaurants rarely spicy  Also shrimp huge really tasty  Cooked perfectly    The Sinatra esque singer delightful background  All all great place dine if stay away bar  <EOR> This Rosebud's favorites many times  first because friend informed Ruth Brown performed Thursday nights before she died  did great then she died predicted  I assume other fine entertainment but let them live peace  RIP Ruth      Anyway once when mood Italian ordered rib eye special best steaks long time  also agreed rare occasions when Babygirl diet ordered light entrees fish chicken  both well cooked moist delicious served beds spinach sides steamed broccoli whole wheat pasta marinara  hardly missed cheesy stuff   But mostly keep coming back because serve hands down absolute favorite lasagna town  At least since old Venetian West Sahara closed down  Sob  Rather square usually served version more slice tall layer cake layers being big rich section ricotta filling  YUM! served lying its side sauce melted mozzarella bubbling top    Unless course you're sister  case everyone else's lasagna described  She inexplicably cold one  she sent back waiter brought heated but suffered its sojourn microwave now soggy   she flagged waiter down yet again sent another trip kitchen  time brought new which hot fresh but then she consumed enough someone else's chicken she no longer hungry  looked prime target scavengers tasty leftovers but no competition it  Guess all put enough time restaurant business figure no way coming third run unscathed   Anyway wasn't lasagna incident cost fifth star Bad experiences follow sister around black cloud  promise them    No lower rating due pet peeve Lasanga priced reasonably enough 17 18 dollars but does include salad  even bread  buy order garlic knots  Nothing hate more  Jeez  Raise price couple bucks throw some damned lettuce  We'll all happy  <EOR> We Las Vegas last week NFR read back magazine place try   driving back hotel saw decided stop late lunch   place very old school food outstanding   am Italian am pretty picky Italian food eat   would recommend lasagna meatball sandwich lunch   Great flavor good size portions   If would time would gone back dinner try antipasta   back next year NFR come back!  sat bar no problems service   waitress very friendly  <EOR> This best Italian food all Las Vegas ok maybe better Carmine's but definitely close  love old Vegas feel romantic ambiance very cozy intimate setting date night however if sit main dining room piano player really entertaining btw bit loud  But least your choice sitting bar area cozier main dining room more family oriented   food great usually order meat ravioli rose sauce a must try but couple other dishes well did disappoint spaghetti meatballs fettucine   wonderful significant other introduced place hooked  Best part they're open 24 7 <EOR> I love old school flair joint  Reminds past life 1938 when mob ran Las Vegas people knew your name  Great food Pizza Las Vegas yesterday no need pay $50 000 just comp  <EOR> Everything place great   staff very attentive helpful questions menu   garlic bread bites AMAZING!!!!

server black gentlemen he pleasant friendly top everything    We ended going back few days later lunch some friends food services just good    It's little dark inside hard read menus but recommend bootleggers! <EOR> Went Monday night some friends open mic night good music great atmosphere sat bar playing poker having some drinks great bar staff made great drink always checking see if ok Nichole bartender gave first class treatment she rocks saying great night come back enjoy bootlegger experience        thank much showing great customer service    steve <EOR> I lived Vegas 25 years  Am long time gaming executive  eaten bootleggers least 50 times  More recommended least 100 times friends clients confidence   This last time attempted significant wait party 3  said could take 2 2 top tables bar  started put tables together several employees said allowed that  when checked host suggested manager defended statement taking 2 tables fit party 3 meant  Did really think 3 guest would sit 2 separate tables? Really ridiculous piss poor attitude top it    Being legacy restaurants comes responsibility  helpful respectful kind  But more importantly being grateful business  lost long time customer very broad reach  am still young would likely eat another 50 times more recommended another 100  But lost all that! <EOR> THE BEST ITALIAN LAS VEGAS!!!  Living Vegas past 17 years life having opportunity sample some finest Italian Food Las Vegas offer definitively say Bootlegger number 1!  I've place more times count never ceases amaze each every visit! prefer sit lounge area near bar more quiet main dining area especially when restaurant live performers livening atmosphere music    My favorite appetizer calamari entree linguini clams! calamari cooked perfection every visit portion size linguini clams unreal  personally prefer broth but other sauces delicious well! pasta usually good serve two people but eat entire bowl myself because GOOD! If you're into linguini clams honestly say never gone wrong anything else Bootlegger's menu take your pick!  If managed save room dessert Tiramisu where at! Probably best Tiramisu Vegas time writing review but  top years now    Overall Bootlegger fantastic! perfect place visit any occasion! would recommend avoiding Bootlegger Friday Saturday night dinner quite crowded  during week around 4 30PM you'll practically place yourself  might wait little before food comes your table but  because Bootlegger everything scratch!   Once Bootlegger you'll spoiled life! <EOR> I've eaten twice now  first time good but excellent  second time phenomenal  Might because second time Friday instead weeknight really on  great jazz singer looked mob hit man but voice Frank Sinatra smooth  then splurged special Chilean Sea bass  AMAZING  never enjoyed fish much  Sweet mild delicate flavor flaked just right without any fishiness  other people enjoyed dishes too  wine also tasty  But still talk Chilean sea bass can't wait back! <EOR> Dont judge little gem its cover!!!! outside seedy little dive off Las Vegas Blvd    Inside transform ya back 80's decor old pictures high back loungers harp player!!!

She told server Janie did recall request   dish remade correct sauce course ate shifts because finished lunch then   daughter requested speak manager regarding discount meal all inconvenience   server said she would manager she graciously apologized situation   called manager NEVER came table told server he wouldn't discount take off anything  never seen such poor customer relations ANY restaurant to! worse he no sack own dirty work! He server come over convey answer! She very nice apologetic felt bad he even put employee awkward position  But going back Bootlegger nor recommend place visitors  town built its reputation CUSTOMER SERVICE just product being sold!  Furthermore many good Italian restaurants town frequent where you're business isn't respected appreciated wanted! <EOR> Whoever cooking salmon tonight kudos! Best cooked piece salmon long time  Thank you! We enjoyed food atmosphere  <EOR> The atmosphere excellent  visit few times year  far favorite place order lasagna  definitely worth visit when town  south strip right next outlet mall  often entertainment evening which adds atmosphere old school Vegas feel  only complaint reason 4 stars 5 never good waiter compared other upscale restaurants town   forgetful  often tell them your request twice always run water flag someone down  However food especially lasagna amazing worth visit sure  <EOR> In two years lived Vegas area frequently heard good things place  mostly along lines being very good old school Italian restaurant having live music most if all evenings   I FINALLY last night dinner friend      While owners guess recipes back 60+ years current location basically modern strip mall complex along Las Vegas Blvd   They small outdoor seating section which actually would lot fun nice day night but opted sit inside first visit better few everything   We arrived 6 30PM Thursday easily found parking front door promptly seated no reservation    The interior pretty nice  lots old photos family wall nice looking bar section then couple dining sections   seated probably main seating area since where small stage Baby Grand piano was   Ambience pretty classic  dark red tablecloths red walls etc  while customer attire ran gamut   jeans t shirt some groups semi formally dressed table people shorts t shirt    I don't think management really minds much however now know place would personally feel comfortable just wearing shorts t shirt sandals    spur moment dining location while wouldn't feel uncomfortable going back casual attire if know headed least wear nice shirt but even staff still dressed nicer least 50% clientele   All staff very friendly professional  shortly seated offered ice water   drink order taken when menus delivered pretty much soon ready order waiter take it    Right order placed received gratis appetizer 'garlic bread balls' marinara dipping sauce  good stuff!  My friend ordered meat lasagna a vegetarian ordered side salad spaghetti marinara   My salad arrived within 5 minutes very good albeit nothing special elaborate    time young woman accompanied pianist started signing   nice touch but loud prevent conversation table   About 15 20 minutes placed order entrees arrived both offered Parmesan cheese added top     friend said lasagna very good know spaghetti too    Spaghetti marinara sauce Parmesan cheese sprinkles pretty basic course  hapless bachelor type spaghetti marinara sauce few meals actually home  but marinara sauce clearly something freshly made result true old school Italian family tradition  won't find sort flavor jar grocery store     Quantity both pasta friend's lasagna good   no means 'family style ' nor did any leftovers but portions enough two good sized adult males fill bellies   It AMAZES think place open 24 7!   I'd live 2 4AM sometime just see if still classy casual kind place     expect late night early morning operation subsidized video poker machines players bar   My only complaint?   prices    Call cheapskate  very true someone lives LV area likes dining out need careful meal budget   But also know $15 less some casino buffets fill large variety decent food plus drink   fact always back mind though am trying compare relatively cheap casino buffet meal experience very nice old school Italian place linen napkins waiters wearing suits ties   $16 plate spaghetti marinara?  Well reluctantly say OK but only because overall ambience plus live music   $3 iced tea free refills ? live that    But surprised see tasty but nothing extraordinary side salad $8    experience many comparable places salad would included price entree   place some touristy place Strip away charging lot simply because tourists programmed expect pay lot while LV area vacation   almost there's surcharge wanting eat healthy      stomaches pleasantly full passed desert time   I absolutely expect back  curiosity may stop if hungry area 3AM days if somewhat casual date nice lunch dinner option  <EOR> Went Christmas dinner  Food all all good but ribeye little salty  Service mediocre  Maybe server wanted home wasn't happy working Christmas Day  <EOR> First place when Vegas because close hotel   Little pricey but great old school Italian restaurant   don't usually spaghetti but just felt right place very good   Again thought $18 spaghetti meatballs seems little high come considering cost ingredients being said paying more atmosphere  <EOR> I first heard place because watching old episodes Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown  knew immediately would place husband would love  mentioned Joel I'd Tuesday he surprised early dinner    Bootleggers Bistro located Las Vegas Blvd forever! Since 3 30 pm Tuesday place empty  Which fine us  No waiting still some excellent tunes Sinatra Louie Prima  dimly lit place large bar  also small stage piano    Our server point quickly poured water handed menus  Bootleggers all Italian classics  Since eat very little days become whole new way ordering  Joel decided split appetizer entree  picked Antipasto plate Baked Penne  food came super fast  First Antipasto plate which huge! contained best marinaded mushrooms bell peppers chickpeas  Plus filled ham salami pepperoni provolone fresh mozzarella  heaven  Then better when brought epically awesome garlic knots marinara sauce seriously life changing!! waitress brought piping hot Baked Penne  Joel's favorite Italian items  probably best Baked Penne ever had  ricotta cheese sweet creamy pasta cooked perfectly al dente   sauce meat mealies your mouth along bites cheese pasta    What amazing meal! can't stop thinking every part it  seriously back ASAP!! service rocks ambiance romantic even 3 30pm food mind blowing!!! your next date night here!

The service also top notch waiter Scott game whole evening   So if enjoy authentic Italian fare romantic dinner great service fair price point Bootlegger MUST! <EOR> We ate restaurant month ago pasta great loved entertainment  husband's mom came holiday Florida wanted take Saturday night   Unfortunately time good experience whatsoever   pasta which should baked come piping hot barely warm   take almost whole thing could properly heat myself   mother law ordered cod could smell minute waiter brought table   extremely fishy cost $22 needless say she very disappointed   top all water glass sat bone dry until finally able ask waiter water   When told fish tasted fishy he acted surprised???  Really could smell arriving he delivered it   We try going restaurant again but awhile  <EOR> I find restaurant utterly intriguing theory  24 hour establishment known its old style Vegas vibe  There's much sort thing going game   Booze promise good red sauce Italian American eats plus Groupon brought Bootlegger late other night  Overall think solid 3 5 star place   The hot fresh garlic bread hit  thought red sauce served along side just tad thin missing ingredient two  bad base sauce but bursting flavor  bread perfect accompaniment big ol' cocktails started off with   Our hot Antipasto appetizer came very quickly nicely presented good size two  truly enjoyed toasted meat ravioli but again lackluster side dish red sauce wished more less other two selections  calamari just okay  shrimp scampi rubbery really didn't any taste all despite pool buttery sauce  don't quite understand scampi sauce taste anything garlic butter! Two favorite things together bowl  could taste any garlic nor butter  really wonder what's sauce could yellow water all know  took bite shrimp let less discriminating husband polish off rest it    For entrees both veal scalloppini fettucini alfredo  veal medallions tender tasty sauteed mushrooms mixed in  impression sauce veal slightly modified version alfredo sauce nicely al dente pasta  very little distinction flavors though both sauces passably good better red sure   Maybe little bit salt definitely some fresh grated parmesan would set dish off  portion size just right left just enough room share outstanding large slice tiramisu    The staff service fine over top but attentive friendly enough me  did dark fairly romantic atmosphere oversized leather booths  Bootlegger reminded lot some old Italian spots New York which nice  meal felt expensive even Groupon don't know often I'd special trip hit or miss eats but always handy know extra late night choice  <EOR> Food's always good but service totally inconsistent sometime great sometime awful  bad because atmosphere nice also live music weekend  <EOR> Cheat day upon Italian mind  more specific truffle chicken carbonara cheesy garlic bread two items wished magically appeared every menu late night    Well  hopeful wishing  even find Italian restaurant open midnight another struggle  came across bootleggers through yelp! Open 24 7?! Sold! Although No cheesy garlic bread no truffle chicken carbonara   So settled chicken Alfredo complimentary garlic knots    Alfredo pretty good! wish more saucey!
