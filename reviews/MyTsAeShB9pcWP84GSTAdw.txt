Game on   So ordered beef chicken pork belly fish fusion tacos start   We served complimentary chips salsa guacamole which decidedly meh  forgot take picture guacamole but brown relatively bland  salsa alright but nothing special  chips clearly homestyle fried corn tortillas which overly thick greasy   The fusion tacos ordered quite filling serving size quite large  All tacos topped shredded cabbage tomatoes FYI thought tomatoes rather flavorless pale beefsteak tomatoes which fan  little little meat per veggie ratio taco tastes   The fish fish tacos really tough coating missing nice light sauce top tie everything together  found overall dry   The pork belly chicken tacos okay both hit smokiness however oddly underseasoned Korean food  expected big flavor hits chili paste sesame oils    which weren't there   The best thing tried bulgogi taco which good seasoned right good amount grilled flavor it   Overall given only really thought 1 dish good 4 think we'll pass place even though glad finally check all fuss 3 starred review   <EOR> Love place!! food always delicious  some chips salsa guacamole free munch while wait food come out  food comes quick awesome  service always excellent  No matter busy place service never seems fall short especially since only 1 2 servers    I always order fusion burrito beef kimchi mouthwatering deliciousness! think main star pork belly's stick  promise regret if order this  doesn't pork belly?!

Bulgogi made order  <EOR> I thrilled learn Komex opened bit closer workplace  Love food especially fusion beef bulgogi pork belly tacos  Buffalo location bigger even if layout bit odd  bar which looks never used takes large portion room   This Komex isn't hectic other smaller location lunch time  However during first visit coworkers someone apparently placed large takeout order which resulted waiting food nearly 45 minutes  Even made order food shouldn't take long  need enough staff cook call in orders order affect restaurant service  patient though food delicious    I tried them again Saturday lunchtime food came within 15 minutes service food spot on  fusion tacos again husband tried enchiladas different meats  far good   But during most recent visit weekday lunchtime coworkers all sorts things off  water tasted funny put skimpiest portion pork belly meat tacos  coworker both asked kimchi side  generous portion small plate true kimchi side dish  Mine? Well looked few kimchi shavings small tin container people use hold ketchup tartar sauce  asked waitress she said kimchi orders same really? 2 different chefs made items  short end deal then? Sigh  Anyway waitress never offered remedy blatant inconsistency food which thought bad form  Food should consistent even case two different cooks food preparers   So if you're going eat Komex ready play some food roulette  <EOR> We chose unconventional route 30+ person wedding rehearsal dinner Komex  Lynda pleasure work made things easy us  sent menu wanted explanation wanted tables chairs configured staff executed things perfectly  did amazing job staying top any additional orders put clearing away plates keeping buffet table clean organized    I frequent Komex regularly most impressed ability present same high quality food throughout night since party large other guests inside restaurant serving  lot bang buck glad could share something love Vegas out of town guests    Bonus now TV inside since NBA playoffs going guests didn't miss games    Now wedding over definitely back Komex favorite fusion cheesesteaks! <EOR> This place just amazing  love everything it  food great price fair  selection great well  love idea Mexican Korean fusion wish could come more but living Henderson place far  <EOR> Marketed Korean Mexican fusion joint   KoMex somewhat lacking both those aspects   essentially standard Roberto's style restaurant quality also serves fried rice noodles chow mien etc  Mexican entrees korean style meats bulgogi pork belly sort   also pork belly saimen     I kimchee fried rice shrimp   All ingredients there    bit spicy good amount shirmp it   pretty good but then again mess fried rice really   3 5 5  Members table ordered fried fish plate w fried rice   bulgogi enchalada bulgogi tacos french fries spicy wings   All bar grub quality   Fries light crispy but could used some salt   wings looked buffalo style wings touch Thai chili   bulgogi enchelada tacos sub par flavor literally nothing else tacos but thinly sliced meat   No sauce no onions veggies   Nothing much stood out  2 5 overall  The restaurant itself lacking ambiance   Very cafeteria esque   bright   Much less inspired similar places L L Aloha Kitchen example  2 5  Not much chance return visit  <EOR> Great food   Great service   Definitely back   It first time getting Korean BBQ gave free samples meats     Cheesesteak something special   They made plain Grilled Cheese cranky toddler  <EOR> Excellent! bulgogi plate disappointed  great flavor highly recommend adding side kimchi! delivious amazing service can't prices  <EOR> Super good  Super cheap  echoing lot other reviews  bulgogi fries super tasty super filling  big guy friend big eater muscling through half order  Three ppl would happily share half order    The wings worth splitting well  Good flavor right amount crispness without being dry  If split those you're halfway full    I typically soft taco two round experience but lot other stuff besides tacos burritos  Pork belly fish spicy pork consistent favorites taco department fish plate itself actually real good too    My only tip put much cabbage pico tacos  just remove half before chow down eat excess salad  Also eat tacos soon come out  cold pico cool down meat minutes  DON'T WANT COLD MEAT!!!! unless carpaccio Half order bulgogi fries 8 wings two pork belly tacos one flour corn carne asada taco corn less $22 cash* pre tip    Also know fact bulgogi bowl good  less intimidating bibimbap  Also pan fried fish great some fusion salsa more sauce comes with  <EOR> This amazing!
