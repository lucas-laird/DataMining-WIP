The menu dairy kosher meaning serve dairy but no meat focuses mostly Israeli style cuisine some pasta sandwiches thrown good measure  generally order Creamy Eggplant roasted eggplant marinara cheese hummus soo good Nicoise salad okkayyy    also serve fish if you're lookin' some protein   Overall food decent healthy but wouldn't come if wasn't Kosher   Please note if wear red halter top restaurant you're going some HARD COLD stares   caters Orthodox Summerlin     They also closed Friday evening all day Saturday  <EOR> get mushroom appetizer forget name but its stuffed cheese pesto sauce staff courteous prices cheap  <EOR> Terrible One waitress Leaking roof Over priced food 15$ plain dish pasta no sauce Terrible service manageress When asked why  added 18%gratuity when only four people dining Management replied because kosher restaurant  Very disappointed <EOR> $30 delivery fee  wa?
