I really hoping place AYCE sushi since close home reviews seem decent although aren't many them    but sad say won't coming back again   There 2 items liked ahi poke baked green mussels   thought ahi poke presented really well enjoyed crunch chips provided   probably should ordered 2 them forget all unmemorable rolls got    but first time wanted try everything   mussels good but if slather enough yum yum sauce anything it'll probably good might saying much   As rolls honest couldn't tell them apart once reached table   Everything looked same shared many same ingredients   All 6 agreed all crunchy fried rolls very good    it fried couldn't really taste fish inside tell kind fish whether even fresh   other rolls just ok   wish told advertise many pieces roll came because all assumed usual 8 pieces   end trying very hard finish all food   As nigiri only tried salmon tuna   ok bad fresh   The service ok   only waitress thought she fine but see why others party did think she very helpful   brother thought she seemed kind pushy having order everything beginning she didn't come back   Usually order little little during AYCE don't over order but she order lot only came back take dessert order   Also she missed orders   only know she did because only half order roll selected everything came way big half order   didn't bother speak because kind glad she did forget tired eating mediocre rolls  <EOR> This place HORRIBLE! wish could give 0 stars  deserves  tried numerous sushi places Vegas takes cake absolute worst    We visited all eat dinner ordered drinks  waitress brought drinks disappeared  Diet Coke almost entirely syrup water awkward taste  Still since  somewhat common attempted order food enjoy meal  Each 3 people ordered rolls some edamame waited   and waited waited some more  50 minutes brought roll  Should known leave right but trying kind as seemed understaffed pressed on   About 20 minutes later most rolls come only way describe them mediocre shrimp tough spicy tuna odd texture wasn't spicy all crab Cali rolls tasted old  Again should left but friends didn't really want cause scene   Finally 80 minutes final dish first order came something beef  Anticipating some sort Kobe Beef roll think Roys dug but meat obviously burnt overpowered rest roll  waitress finally came back while deciding whether try order more asked take away roll  She simply said won't walked away  Confused demanded she take plate away crowding table  She informed hadn't eaten whole thing violating all eat rules  Now while am aware those rules very common prevent people being wasteful force your customers eat horribly prepared food   The sushi chef attempted tell since first time he would ignore but last straw  informed wouldn't next time because food horrible service rude    Avoid place!!! <EOR> Brian's Beach you've done again!   Brian's Beach still top places eat sushi  being said rolls O SO Satisfying  half orders most rolls hey plus me  say more try more your adventure through sushi land  Triple all time favorite roll! If kick your sushi must try Almost Fire Roll if feel need try something ordinary Twist octopus roll your way go    I highly recommend eating AYCE if your sushi eater love take your adventure your taste buds sushi next level  Lunch $21 95 Dinner $25 95  totally worth your money   trust me!   As service excellent servers filled drinks Chefs friendly  <EOR> Ugly location  Good sushi  Great value  Good service  very busy which means short waits  <EOR> Best sushi had! tuna carpaccio fave menu although everything ordered good  edamame warm fish fresh green tea ice cream delish! Only down side although sushi AYCE would assume dessert AYCE too   not  first time 2008 dessert AYCE  came again last month changed it  only order dessert selection ice cream mochi  if wanted each? suppose AYCE right?  fine tho didn't really mind much bc end meal pretty full   Defintely order AYCE    wouldn't worth if just ordered 1 2 things menu  <EOR> ****Take out review****  I close giving place two stars but reconsidered because everything bad   I think   The bf called order pick lady told would ready 20 minutes  said great sat back put movie 21 minutes later way pick order  bf paid sat car waited  waited    and waited  Mind sitting car right front place pretty much could see lot things going restaurant  including food being made sushi chefs boxing handing guy  waiting additional 10 minutes finally headed home feast dinner  ended ordering sushi dinner which came nine pieces sushi eight pieces CA rolls miso soup   The good eel salmon California rolls most certainly miso soup hot yummy probably best part meal The bad avocado rolls fresh very mushy   The ugly speaking mushy can't even begin describe bad sushi was  def wasn't fresh smelled funky when swallowed felt nauseous    So would back? Yes maybe while though  place numerous times before but don't remember much experience could def give another shot regardless bad piece fish was  Although think pointless call order pick just find when there  Maybe trust issues? Thinking client might pick order? because sushi right then there?

We looked behind sushi bar saw culprit right plain view world's LARGEST rice cooker  looked more cement mixer may used while constructing City Center property  Brian decided would serve loftier purpose over ricing masses @ quaint little sushi bar  Really Brian?! much rice REALLY necessary?!   Perhaps saves money fish!   fish wasn't freshest world despite fact dining right beach Brian's beach is     Honestly whole beach theme began ended large plastic fish hung wall looked more anatomy chart identify FRESH fish sorry but thinking may needed re read wall didactic      All all pretty disappointed rice overkill sushi  hot sake great deal though pretty darn delicious servers Brian all VERY friendly well  really loved service actually    And now leave song as sung tune Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby!

Cannot that!  Make sure order Appetizers Tuna Pokies Carpaccio Baked Mussel takes awhile but fresh baked Seaweed Salad  Roll Big B Big D roll Hand roll Saba  Dessert Mochi ice cream it usually runs $2 per piece market Green Tea Ice Cream  I highly recommend place anyone! <EOR> I felt tofu restaurant sushi restaurant    Food The sushi seriously tasted tofu no  flavor  probably tasted more rice sushi  Maybe taste buds really really REALLY off day but doubt it  No toro day  Uni decent   saving grace place non sushi items shrimp heads oysters gyoza dynamite  most interesting meal day tofu cheesecake  Trying cram unhealthy cheesecake into healthy food tofu just boggles mind  bad but wouldn't order again   Service No complaints just nothing stood out  Felt just order food ate paid left  Didn't same good vibe staff did Naked Fish Raku Hikari Sushi Mon   Price $22 lunch 11 30am 4pm $26 dinner 4pm 11 30pm  going rate AYCE sushi town  If you're coming lunch pay dinner price Uni sweet shrimp + shrimp heads  Worth extra $4   So if don't sushi but want Japanese food come brian's beach SUSHI  Otherwise Hikari Sushi Mon instead aren't far away  <EOR> Best AYCE sushi place west Mississippi!!! Well might slight exaggeration but planned trips Vegas around place  Fish fresh menu items normally found AYCE joints    Highly recommend tuna carpaccio ahi tuna poki tower  use lot Anago sauce if don't sweet your sushi sure side  Also give homemade tofu cheesecake try   pretty good IMO  <EOR> I meetup group event Sushi Group 22nd Nov  Table wasn't ready moment  when already made reservation  so kind upset little first  But made table soon enough kind understood only waitress working  because Monday  When start ordering food  it quick good  Waitress Sushimans really kind  I can't believe 3 hours   lol P  Even tho time limit  they didn't kick out   P  I tell trying hard give better service since big group us  I really liked food great time everyone! <EOR> customer service poor presentation good atmosphere poor taste good  This favorite places go  boyfriend pretty often where actually knew faces  Last Saturday brought three friends us  Long story short handed plate food bar boyfriend where sitting where corner bar turns  offered friends left roll where still talking set plate down thought felt table but mistake dropped plate floor  The chefs made horrible face me  boyfriend pick pieces min nobody coming clean mess sister saw bad felt came wipe mess  Nobody offered another roll even though knew I'd charged ones dropped and fine that     never offered replace nobody came clean actually acted really angry it   Considering all spent lot money before well evening you'd think would realize mistake was  am paying customer didn't purpose  If wouldn't having such good night prob  would made bigger deal it  Instead just writing review  really liked place until last week   We'll looking new favorite sushi bar now  <EOR> In much younger youth day met guy facebook decided lunch him   decided meet Brian's Beach Sushi   know know ya never know could slasher rapist serial killer axe murderer   figured because he Filipino wouldn't bad   Worst he could pilipino aksent   Because found love place met great awesome person befriend   Still friends day   Whenever always given wonderful service   servers always pleasant kind patient   pretty lucky getting nice people   I agree when reason why people come back place because employees greet customers all smiles prepare food serve food   Because convenient location everything need done daily basis often come dine lunch   Mostly just lunch special Salmon California Rolls   Nothing spectacular just simple lunch need through rest day   simple ingredients best food   salmon always fresh which love   hate old salmon can't stand it   Some restaurants serve old salmon tell because there's foul smell permeating food  <EOR> I've coming Brian's beach longest time sushi always great staff friendly  love quality balance sushi tried other places quality keeps coming back again again    recommend try mountain roll paradise roll Denver roll but ask sauce side gives more freedom add your liking  Also don't forget try tofu cheesecake all time favorite dessert perfect end good dining experience     Yeah know other sushi places great job serving some good sushi but Brian keeps quality flavor balance always consistent fresh delicious   FYI  Brian he usually making sushi enjoy each time  <EOR> Good place but kind annoyed friends orders way before did ordered right when walked starving take while decide would order spicy mayo just straight mayo spiracha which weird because always ordered diffrent locations its actually own take sauce blob mayo spiracha side _ eel sauce alright rainbow roll delicious eel roll friends also happy ordered which arizona roll crunch roll caifornia shrimp tempura roll good over all but im sauce person clearly lacking =] <EOR> I lunch reading reviews excited go   ordered lunch special $11 95 which teriyaki salmon chicken tempura vegetables shrimp 3 pc tuna sashimi 3 pc sushi tuna shrimp yellowtail plus ordered side Halibut    I feel terrible but really wasn't all great  definitely experienced WAY better   all fairness did order any rolls   seems most better reviews mention rolls   probably try place again just give rolls shot but until then Brian's Beach Sushi gets 2 stars me  <EOR> We decided give place try because Yelp reviews looked promising   love sushi but if develop favorite spot visit often enough start know everything going order before eat   wanted try something new gave place try     We hopeful discover new sushi spot however would case   First all waited 20 minutes just water hot green tea   didn't receive first orders until 45 minutes later   venue small 2 sushi chefs but weren't many customers time   extremely slow took breaks watch tv while waiting food   didn't everything ordered because forgot but ended being ok   added ton rice all rolls very little fish   ended getting full rice without getting enjoy came for   When asked waitress check she cleaned 2 more tables before bringing check     Disappointing  <EOR> My boyfriend tried place year ago terrible experience waited  over hour two rolls place even busy  Food decent but worth wait  decide give another try last night BIG mistake fish tasted old nasty  When home both terrible stomach aches  <EOR> Hadn't hit sushi buffet while friend told favorite one   Whenever places main goal eat more spend there   All menu items even buffet prices try order most expensive ones sure money's worth   $50 wife along some drinks came $90 including tip   ended eating little over $100 worth   know prices don't mean anything since its buffet but feel better some reason     I am all made order sushi buffets   No more Makino Todai crap me   place great   restaurant itself bit small but nice   also noticed more Japanese people eating any other sushi buffet Vegas which must say something place   fish didn't blow away but all good quality stuff   Its pretty comparable Sushi Hana sans toro  <EOR> What disappointment!!! Tried place bc fav sushi joint wasn't open when craving  fellow Yelpers quite trustworthy far but afraid deceived unworthy 4star rating place had  What's going Yelpers???  We early dinner only 2 tables occupied  Service friendly all Chef waiter waitress  Most importantly fishes weren't fresh most rolls terrible   simply terrible just much sauce cover bad smelly fish    Brian if gonna put your own name restaurant's name then plz represent your name more proudly something ppl would wanna remember by   plz consider constructive criticism bc don't lash  no reason  <EOR> On side town probably only place I'd AYCE sushi  Come think probably going tomorrow friend since close where live   From all times there's only server  Therefore if busy you're gonna fighting waiter  always same waiter too  guess only waiter?  If want fresh stuff might place terms quality stuff compared places Sushi Twister   However really adore Almost Fire roll here  I'd mostly just only eat nigiri other places but I'd always order roll here  excited tomorrow actually 0D   Until next visit if any significant update needed sure update review! <EOR> I'd VERY Leery Single Visit Single Review yelps   As Ex Local Brian's Beach still favorite Japanese restaurants LV   much it?  Let's see recent URGENT trip LV where drive over morning leave afternoon place time highly compressed time frame Brian's Beach   The service always exemplary food always excellent   favorites include seared tuna tartar Dynamite grape bree quesadilla WTF? uhh yeah MUST TRY assorted rolls appetizers  One great bonus place AYCE rules aren't limited just rolls but also apply appetizers if someone doesn't dig rolls stick great appetizer menu  The thing personally dislike Seared Tuna tartar limited order per guest  can't blame them though expensive dish would seriously just chow down dozen plates if could  <EOR> I dont understand missed spot 2 years living southwest  first time today AYCE sushi  early dinner 5pm service fast helpful   delicious  Nigiri menu spot on  Super fresh    As other AYCE sushi places really dont remember besides nigiri  But really enjoyed every plate overall experience  stand definitely fresh nigiri  appetizer ahi tuna carpaccio delicious too    AYCE REALLY good deal $25    I think might hooked  <EOR>
