We ordered Bacon Jalapeno Prawns starter sitting gigantic puddle BBQ sauce which first impressions wasn't very appealing   However surprise good apart fact sauce tasted McDonald's BBQ sauce  We shared St Louis Ribs dish Cajun Chicken Sausage Pasta  The Ribs although cooked well worst flavored sickly sweet sauce almost reminded some kind teriyaki sauce bunch chillies thrown there   slightly more edible when scrapped excess off your knife   To honest would preferred McDonald's flavored sauce instead  It came nothing but some decoration slithers potato   serves ribs no sides?? Rip off  The pasta ok   Nothing Cajun but far pastas ok   Perhaps renaming would better?   fresh basil nice touch though   No wonder quiet Friday night  <EOR> The P B B J Crostini F***ing AMAZING!!!!!!
