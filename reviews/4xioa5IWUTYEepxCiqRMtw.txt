Anyways quarter pounders fries which weren't anything special really nothing more way taking care late night hunger   Service ordinary tables food court decent repair sleeping bum I'm assuming clothing appearance some young college aged kids patrons  <EOR> This McDonald's life party 3AM night clubbing   You'll see sweaty guys suits destroyed girls walking barefoot because heels hurt   Everyone stumbling around maybe getting fight two   Its blind leading blind   But nothing hits spot big mac night drinking   good news joint close Signature MGM   else would eat during normal hours when Joel Robuchon within walking distance? <EOR> Biggest collective lines anything MGM Grand far tell  food fine here  only issue apparently decided pull some customer unfriendly design stuff having people wait food counter same register ordered looks moving really slowly times  Still cheaper everywhere else A OK Yelp calls 3 stars  <EOR> Got hotcakes sausage patty breakfast delicious  Orange juice nice cold hate when warm OJ just same  <EOR> Why bleep am reviewing McDonald's MGM's Studio Walk especially since just around corner some finest dining world Joel Robuchon's L'Atelier Michael Mina's Seablue?  'cause ate McDonald's recently  why   It Sunday around crack o' dawn that's small d capital D ahem feeling particularly bright eyed bushy tailed  Plus catch flight NYC couple hours   So what's knackered lad supposed do? Eat greasiest thing purview  what  There's nothing Sausage McMuffin egg hash browns soak mumble mumble glasses G and T's sucked down night before   Thank goodness McDonald's say!   And if disagree just sit 'n' spin  <EOR> I never see reason McDonald's but if really looking cheapest options MGM place   Located food court actually few options where prices aren't ridiculously marked Vegas standards   If need indulge want anywhere else America guess should stop by  <EOR> This your typical McDonald's fare food court setting  definitely least expensive meal weekend happy see normal McDonalds prices including dollar menu a lot touristy places not    line moved quickly order correct  No complaints here! <EOR> You lucky being right near start line 6 15am when 30 degrees line Starbucks mile long friend tradition getting your egg mcmuffins each race since San Diego Rock 'n' Roll marathon     We woke extra early braved elements wonderfully warm   decided would stay inside blanket heat until start race   turns everyone else same idea but lines moved fast   Wow!  possible?  Oh anticipated egg mcmuffins all ready well coffee juice   made them night before?  good possibly be?    I order mine without sausage your employee freaks out   He tells they're already made if could just take sausage out   give look say want made fresh   He consults another employee ultimately manager agree should fresh egg mcmuffin   Gee thanks   Also what's $7 price tag?  Did raise prices night before marathon?  never paid much combo meal   You're supposed cheap breakfast option   I supposed fresh egg mcmuffin notice fresh   cheese burnt well muffin there's sausage residue muffin   did happen?  juice warm because left anticipation rush     Next marathon won't coming back   buy muffins somewhere night before just do  <EOR> Worst service ever!! super slow guy register seems he hates job   Next time call sick if don't wanna here <EOR> The ABSOLUTE worst McDonald's planet! PERIOD! only reason why didn't give them 1 star because Mcdonald's food great!  The service particular restaurant far suckiest form service known man  4 year old niece delivers food more respectable way  waiting line 45 mins order wait another 45 mins your food  only thing imagine playing head while watching workers duties could circus theme music    We talking people around while stood amazement bad service was  lady waited 30 mins coffee leaving just see long would actually take coffee come  second time she asked coffee manager herself audacity give attitude    As continuing supportive customer Mcdonald's brand strongly suggest send people teach them run lines  people obviously know doing! <EOR> It's your typical McDonald's difference open 24 hours!  A ton seating  Fast service even early morning hours   Perfect if you're staying MGM Grand  <EOR>
