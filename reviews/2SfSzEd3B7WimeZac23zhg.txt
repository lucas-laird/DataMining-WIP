How works place your order counter they'll give number servers deliver your food when ready    Food Shakshoka skillet comes chorizo avocado marinara sauce 2 eggs I over easy eggs 2 prices bread  thought chorizo mixed dish but instead placed side  only 3 dingy pieces  least give few more pieces! However flavor good plenty veggies it    Medium chai latte should've gotten large! wasn't overly sweet something would again  Only thing wished served bit hotter temperature wise    Service great! waitress owner attentive always made sure water filled  Some people group bottomless mimosas waitress did great job refilling those too    I would sure come back especially since want try some other items menu  <EOR> This place 50 50 shot  Sometimes excellent affordable meal great cafe setting  lattes good too!
