First don't honor military discount because uniform  First off  pretty good way never having give discount  Military families use same source income least do  if give spouse $1 off you're still giving same military personnel $1 off  What's difference? just seems very unfair me  wouldn't upset if just that  But now prices raised which understand  businesses work  But $13 sandwich  just turkey bacon lettuce mustard?? Needless say coming back  people friendly previous staff   Before when came would offer cup water always declined but today thirsty asked cup water when receipt charge cup  Really???
