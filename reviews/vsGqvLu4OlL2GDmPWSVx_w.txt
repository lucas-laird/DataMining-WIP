I am excited place   tried Flame Kabob couple days eating Paymon's blew them away   koobideh better Paymon's Habib's but without price Paymon's uncomfortable bow tied servers forced upscale feeling Habib's   The atmosphere Chipotle style place walk counter tables bring your food when ready   We tried chicken beef koobideh beef tenderloin not sure if name right    All great but liked chicken most   Also pretty good hummus great shirazi salad too!   Never bother more expensive places just some decent kabobs again! <EOR> A tad pricey but quality food worth it   steak kabob tender cooked perfectly medium rare   However ground meat kabob such ground chicken kabob twice much meat price but spices used good  <EOR> One word YUM! My husband huge fan Persian food when he found place next day   high expectations Flame Kabob did disappoint   table everything Kabobs Schwarma everything absolutely wonderful! meat cooked seasoned perfectly  saffron rice some best bread god bread!
