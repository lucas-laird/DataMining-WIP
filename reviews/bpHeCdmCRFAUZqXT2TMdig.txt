Tiny place built into crevice Main Street south downtown  Only 10 tables menu compact but good variety usual south border fare    Prices very reasonable everything tasted very good always return when need fix fantastic guacamole!  OLE! <EOR> Love tacos!  really small restaurant though only 12 14 tables   need 11 50am lunch ensure table otherwise you're waiting don't waiting area your getting hit back door waiting outside heat cold  <EOR> You may told time another old time locals El Sombrero the best Mexican restaurant Las Vegas  Myself Hispanic find completely false strongly disagree   I'm sure why many people told place best  definitely old  exterior lost paint may driven Main St  even see it  Inside quite cramped but plus  chat other dinners  gives off hole wall feel  character place   The food far below fair  always say if restaurant claims serve certain type food then should able simplest staple type food perfectly  Example Italian restaurant should able great meatball marinara sauce  Hence mexican restaurant should great taco  If screw simplest dish rest entrées turn out?  I love tacos ordered taco dish  highly surprise receive very generic un freshly made tacos  shells packaged hard ones purchase grocery store  meat ground beef very noticeable taco mix seasoning  way much lettuce  very displeased   Not sure place gotten such notable reputation  only conclusion called old time locals don't really know good Mexican food  <EOR> Great great chili verde  Pork Chili verde favorite dishes family owned El Sombrero knows distinctly incredible mouth watering recipe  rest menu pretty authentic but entirely     The service very very casual which isn't necessarily bad thing since beer wine only wine margarita pretty laughable but $4 nothing complain   But serve some great Mexican Beers Salsas wonderful!  You might miss tiny square restaurant old roommate loved say pass Gas there! Gas St  If become regular keep little reserved sign your special booth when come D <EOR> This place awesome! Anything Vegas longer then pretty impressive  took Anthony Bourdain eat here  Ya  right name droppin'! He loved much do  Prices gone bit over years though but still worth it  <EOR> This place looks kind classic might good since tucked away near fremont recommended local but just didn't place   found substandard fatty   meat did taste freshly killed but wasn't feelin' it  <EOR> Mediocre Mexican food take forever!  really small shack Main Street   couple friends insisted lunch took over two hours   Everything took way long took them inordinately long time take order food even bill could leave   Once food hour food completely bland   same quality your average Mexican chain   Avoid all costs  <EOR> El Claustrophobio! Upon walking knew cramped meal booths straight Nashville '70s small claustrophobic shiny wear  Eww  ceilings '70s motel lobby low well underhung rafters boot  rent cannot possibly much yet food cheap current more you would think pricepoint even close good value     Every item food plate #11 Lunch Combo Tamale Burrito Beans Rice funky aftertaste which unacceptable day age survival of the tastiest restaurants  Especially when $5 looking plate food costs $10  place should $$$ $$ relative all other Mexican options town  aftertastes made think water quality bad part town? grill cleaned recently? Even both salsas a Red Pico looking one pretty terrible both weird aftertastes which made think many days ago salsa made? some kind salsa 'filler' never heard tasting baby corn water chestnuts crappy Chinese restaurant? only took chip full each salsa immediately give both  says LOT because am typically chip monster usually ruin appetite chips salsa Mexican restaurants  Both salsas actually *sour* aftertaste which last checked Szechwan Culiacán     Not mention chips 1PM lunch already stale wish hadn't peeked back servers' prep station where sat sad gray bus boy tub stale chips sitting unappetizingly window    Impressed and surprised seemingly loyal customer following place packed energy good people laughing talking  Service fine   C'mon Downtown Vegas folks can't possibly place much! And     To PR puppet account dude sent insulting compliment because above review just cost El Sombrero another star  Way fucker! <EOR> We lot things done Downtown Saturday ended starving 3 PM   usual conversation where eat taking place decision making void  want?  don't know  Dona Maria's?  um  Chicago Joe's?  eh    we just given headed back 'burbs when passed Main  El Sombrero? YES!  We first tried El Sombrero when first moved Vegas LA 9 years ago   time although LOVED building history found food didn't live LA grown Mexican food snobbery  Nine years later think changed mind     As poured over menu waitress pretty sure owner graciously said could still order off lunch menu even though late it   Nice   She also suggested whole bunch combos when she found don't eat pork beef rule   don't much or any? vegan dishes broke 7 month moratorium meat splurged chicken taco cheese enchilada combination     The taco although served hard shell tasted great   beans top notch too  enchilada sauce almost cinnamon flavoring couldn't quite place  Pretty different any other enchilada sauce reading other Yelp reviews think know why   palate LA palate hadn't exposed much New Mexico style food initially judged harshly due inexperience  tsk tsk Lesson learned   The service kind welcoming ancient building kept immaculately clean interior   Loved everything place  <EOR> Have coming since kid 40 yrs basically    natural love place just due memories   food still good but best town but much better then most hands down   truely bothers early close evening now a days   understand money during lunch hours but weekend pulled before 8 closed   People give two stars   well   you probably never happy anything <EOR> I've passed place several times walk just happened skipped breakfast hungry around lunch time found myself across street decided give try    didnt even look menu ordered Chicken Burrito To Go came $8  little surprised price but hoping best  lunch time most tables small dining room occupied looked Business people DownTown  offered seat wait order but probably moreso way waitress place very small compact   As waited looked signed pictures wall = Penn Teller Ray Charles Freddie Fender alot didnt know  didnt wait very long asked if wanted some chips salsa take initially declined but nice waitress sold saying Its all fresh Homemade ate chips way home advertised = very lite little salt red ones very good   When home very disappointed $8  burrito good enough but only medium sized portion compared Roberto's other Mexican place reviewed which sell bigger better $5  hindsight should lunch ordered special menu which next time hungry area   The place almost full must doing something right  <EOR> Take pass   Eh all Mexican food restaurants area worth taking pass going somewhere else not food any better just nothing special El Sombrero comparison    seating limited parking terrible food worth making trip here   coming back again  <EOR> Sorry closing! Thanks memories! Maybe come toy! <EOR> The last time came food world  much time  ordered #3 way way overpriced $13  should more $7  Everything tasted stale old nothing hot  prob sitting all day microwaved  chips salsa served guess stale  only good thing strawberry soda jarritos <EOR> Went again new year  Fantastic chips great salsa  ground beef enchiladas best ever had  <EOR> Hands down best Chili Verde ever had!!  place hole wall somewhat seedy area but forever good reason     Home made salsa quick service delicious home made mexican food serioulsy comparable food Mexico   tried menudo but hear also amazing again bowl chili verde $8 really can't it!!
