The best thing IMO double pan fried noodles  often chef successfully creates crispy outer edges while rest noodles just right mouth feel them little bite little chewiness  sauce just perfect cornstarchy    A close second hot sour soup  Trust really above average almost better mom's heh     The kai lan Chinese broccoli also very good plump juicy  less adventurous companion likes lemon chicken which alright but great   They some good lunch specials late night specials half price some items 11pm including hot sour soup yay!    In all better Chinese dining experience some Spring Mountain which very pleasant surprise! <EOR> I absolutely love chicken fried rice  overly greasy some places actually taste egg which love! such big serving bring rest home    I also delicious chicken lettuce wrap appetizer  chicken mushrooms which could taste thank goodness green onions water chestnuts all mixed type sauce tasted teriyaki something else couldn't quite think of  forgot menu said but all leaf fresh lettuce finger lickin good !
