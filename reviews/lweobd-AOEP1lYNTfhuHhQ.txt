But seeing Yelp pictures tell dessert half assed  First off turon even fried golden brown color still pretty yellowish color top didn't even any honey simple syrup sweeten it  However give props just use regular old bananas but specific tropical banana which don't know name of  halo halo thought so so  did ube ice cream girlfriend craving even though ordered did tell discontinued it  also wasn't huge fan frosted flakes although sense since add crunch sweetness desert  just simply cup tea   Although deserts ordered did blow away actually left somewhat disappointed give props creativity uniqueness flavors tried overall service bad  might give place another try lunch but definitely sweets run  <EOR> Food very tasty especially pork belly  I wish servings little bit more  The place quite small restaurant Vegas  Overall must try  <EOR> First time here  take order go  place small very hot  ordered Kare kare 1lb lechon pancit bam family size large dinuguan  home OMG! portions small everything just horrible  container half cup dinuguan  rice dry old mixed fresh  food terrible could eat it  Everything greasy old  kare kare sweet sickening  moved Hawaii  Plus Philippines eaten good Filipino food many years  food worst ever had  waste over $50!

Must check out!!just plain rice fried rice wasn't very good    <EOR> Oh man am disappointed  came because friends ordered Lechon Thanksgiving really liked thought restaurant would some delicious treats us  place easy find but when no greeted find server  Once seated looked over menu asked special drink listed but wasn't available ordered water  ordered oxtail soup while boyfriend ordered shrimp pancit  10 mins later finally served drinks  Then almost 15 mins time ordered server informed shrimp  suggested boyfriend order something else all together    but server told pancit already being made    settled pork  oxtail soup came first  could hardly wait  But palate tasted nothing extraordinary    if could describe taste color would boring gray    oxtail's mild taste thrown off watered down broth  almost brings tears write such waste good meat  pancit joined 5 minutes later  almost excuses bad oxtail since takes long prepare    but absolutely no excuse bad pancit    pancit noodles where great    but hell thinking? Hard pieces non edible pork riddled amongst flavorful yummy pancit    WTF horrible  But final blow meal time experience  check    boyfriend though he ordered solo meal pancit   but instead charged family size  no conformation sever granted boyfriend didn't specify he wanted solo meal    but come suppose professional business am sure hasn't only happened boyfriend   Instead correcting complaining left disappointed curious why place sure high marks  pork good when ordered thanksgiving    but dine in experience could improved upon more flavor beef broth rid pork your pancit some shrimp    people trying eat here! <EOR> Amazing service amazing food just little slice Philippines! small space feel just home give all attention  Stop regret it! <EOR> So really rounded 3 5 star review   Let start lechon probably best Vegas    better Salo Salo Goldilocks etc   love pork pork moist flavorful crispy skin   some other restaurants end more pork jerky   and being fan Chinese style roast pork   this lechon comparable   why 3 5 stars    the ngo hiong lumpia just didn't seem crispy enough egg roll exterior almost slightly chewy   filling also wasn't meaty enough guess use shanghai lumpia   Also calamansi juice mango juice   I'm love calamansi!  staff extremely friendly accommodating however seeing only 1 2 tables   they should left item order   until reminded them did check pancit ordered    only realize order placed   didn't receive order until end meal   pancit mediocre best when arrived   staff very accommodating offered free mango juice due mistake    a nice gesture   However fiancee really wanted additional calamansi juice run =    second table wanted mango juice noticed sent someone actually pick some up     The decor simple patio eating area works   some kinks work since fairly new but would come back some lechon  <EOR> Can't wrong place !!
