Within two weeks discovering little hidden gem place eaten 8 times  <EOR> 4 stars Carne asada taco salad    I let husband take order because wanted see if I'd enjoy food blindly  know food taste better when service great food tastes poo because poor service  thought process was   it windy hungry  I'd enjoy taco salad without anyone ruining vibe   It's shop located amongst strip businesses  could easily miss because isn't quite street view  when see 7 11 corner  that's your cue turn in  Lots parking because those strips within neighborhood  took all but 2 mins since husband works around corner   It took 15 minutes little longer until husband comes walking two bags each taco salad  place onto Styrofoam plates which obviously can't closed    We ate those suckers parking lot because couldn't risk food sweating  felt little longer necessary considering just taco salad   Opting Carne asada omitting beans rice  What    don't judge  handle only much moosh  Anyway upon opening quickly discovered why food took little longer jusssst taco salad   I completely appreciate fresh taco shell  Nothing waiting long stale one  But todaaay ay  salad delight  All fixings inside typical taco salad however everything seemed fresh!!! lettuce pico guac etc   fresh  furrrr resh  Lettuce nice crispy meat wasn't salty nor chewy pico didn't look twas sitting container overnight  add meat seemed kind skim  put meat way bottom salad    Honestly though   being skim meat taco salad alright me  meat wasn't even feature taco    The Carne asada taco salad 6 95  also ordered horchata  else would wash all down during midday fiesta  large cup came out 2 dollar something   The husband said horchata pre poured into cups which bare Pepsi logo sits fridge waiting someone take them home  horchata wasn't overly sweet wasn't anything special add  Just your typical horchata   Blind test worked  enjoyed food without any biasness  biased  woud love return try tacos something interest full service myself  update    So 4 stars STRICTLY over taco salad  <EOR> This location previously Robertos   similar style Robertos quick serve mexican restaurant   expecting culinary greatness more quick flavorful lunch   cheap almost always lunch special   Chile Relleno burrito favorite   Ask 2 rellenos less other stuff     Some times chicken tacos  99    Bueno!
