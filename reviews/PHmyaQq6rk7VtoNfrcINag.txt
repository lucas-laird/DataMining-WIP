Used known Tri State Pizza but now FAMILIA PIZZERIA   all usual Italian dishes pastas hot cold subs but seem focus pies     As some may know outskirts Philly feel know when pizza shop good pie   when mom pop pizza shop way judge pies tasting plain cheese pepperoni pie     Familia Pizzeria good North East Coast pie   large 18 plain pie $13 96 including tax    ratio cheese sauce perfect   describe sauce wasn't chunky marinara style nor runny sauce can but traditional herbs good taste texture   Each slice foldable thin   would've given place five stars more grease top pie if bottom crust less brown a bit crispy but place certainly beats Metro Pizza   Metro good but authentic   Perhaps owners lived Vegas long forget pie should taste like?  I called order carryout   pie ready when NO wait   added two liter bottle coke $2 75 + tax      The ambiance would expect small pizza shop   walk there's small display pies available slice   did look bit old but 4 15pm  way lunch rush little early dinner crowd   six tables which clean decorated red white plaid table cloths   register white board daily specials   Today Wednesday specials Italian Wedding Soup  that's only thing remember   course there's Coca Cola refrigerator two liter bottles 12 oz  bottles bottles Yoo Hoo   Beside there's self serve Coca Cola soda fountain   fountain big PLUS book because sometimes mix sodas unique flavors   instance did ever notice SUBWAYS always self serve fountains   well try mixing half Minute Maid Lemonade half Nestea Raspberry Iced Tea   WOW it'll bomb'est Arnold Palmer you'll ever have!!!!!!!!
