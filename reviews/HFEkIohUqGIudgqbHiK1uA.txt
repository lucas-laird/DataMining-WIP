Everything fresh! <EOR> This place just ok  bad but haven't anything really stood out   Denver omelette  alright but wish would put more cheese also put cheese inside omelette rather just top  doesn't seem cheesy when put top all ingredients inside part gooey cheesiness   but guess might just personal preference putting some more meat wouldn't hurt either  feel really skimped meat   times where felt just eating veggie scramble  <EOR> Great service waiters very friendly prompt  good asking if wanted more coffee water  only downside because food good most likely wait  <EOR> So coming Cracked Egg pretty much since opened years ago  say average least once week more lunch breakfast   Often hit other locations well depending where day brings me   lot pancakes     Always fan sad say poor experiences most recently actually prompted create yelp account  Normally would just voice such concerns manager but sad say don't really think he would receptive   He seems more interested socializing he does running place standards set other Cracked eggs   hope owner reads because am those regulars would always tell friends good all restaurants were   going happen again   speak experience customer operator    My last visit four other tables seated    10 minutes waitress stop talking friends she eating come take order    Another 15 minutes  before order came eggs bacon toast fruit   become pretty much routine occurrence   Staff am paying watch eat socialize each other your friends bring in   life Gordon Ramsey don't sit down eat yourself then wash your hands then bring order when feel it mouthful food!!!  does this??  Portion sizes always consistent rule brand  Lately seem vary huge tiny    Food costs must treat chart here   Flavors always varied guess depending cooking late   Cleanliness?  Brush crumb floor then step throughout day     Oh BTW spill floor nobody cleaned up    almost caused kill myself  But hey long  staff time text phone update facebook between sitting down chat friends   what's more dead customer right?   No follow refills selling staff's part anymore   am sure owner glad know rather supervising manager generally leaves well before staff closing  Seen least half dozen times last two months   No side work clean being done when slow   seen tables take ten minutes bused floors routinely filthy bathroom horse wouldn't use    3 Visits last two weeks  Each more disappointing last   Staff generally unorganized disinterested   continuous flow new employee faces over last few months tells general leadership problem   remember years going where same cashiers busboys waiters waitresses clockwork  last visit heard waitress tell another she wasn't told if she working  tomorrow????  Wasn't told yet closing???  Communication key hospitality    Attention detail no more   staff might care $200 month losing future but am sure owners might care 50 other customers noticing same race bottom    Good Evening   I'm McAvoy <EOR> I don't wait many other places eat at   GLAD waited!

Well     fine until last few times   My family love convenient location due coffee cake frequent random intervals  Sometimes husband kids sometimes just sister when she's town   However any time sit back service DOWNHILL VERY fast  recommend insist sitting front order decent service   On top something particularly odd yesterday doubt going back incident  Now sister large women  booth though handle isnt exactly most comfortable  Most times ask take whatever because usually place packed want bad enough take booth table whichever comes first  However yesterday place relatively empty but instead asking guy seated just shoved into booth back while several tables open front  guess werent pretty enough sit front?  Let explain booth works  sit corner being smaller two then booth table angled pinning she fit sit   A table sat down two three minutes later  waitress tended them first  guess she didnt see us  She then rushed over take order  requested coffee  She says yeah but food want? rushing through making food order  So    did  hurried ordered food   So    she brings coffee cocoa myself sister    then coffee cake few minutes later  time then bring breakfast   I take two bites breakfast potatoes then she's already bringing check! took longer bring coffee cake did bring check bringing food  Truly    pair sunny side eggs hadnt even yolks broken yet when she's pushing check already  turn away carry breakfast  Several minutes later she comes BACK check! again turn away  time notice man seated talking waitress tends front pointing talking great length It's OBVIOUSLY us   He then proceeds sit end counter we corner back where could seen front if counter ate meal    staring whole time  SUPER awkward  When waitress pushed ticket third time message left over half meal taking hint getting hell there   I'm sure why wanted bad but fair enough    wont returning  bad  coffee cake REALLY good  <EOR> Bad service today 5 22 17 6 30 am One server handling least 7 groups tables  French toast served cold  ready saw coming window when done kitchen but sat good 15 minutes before served  coffee fresh too  Disappointing today    <EOR> We heard place remarkable    The place packed   Recovering bachelor's party night before don't let your mind wander playing Super Mario Bros  Mount Charleston until eyes bled needed place sober but only hour before head off work   When walked told hostess time constraint   Her reply? Oh shouldn't problem  hostess didn't tell seating 4 additional smaller parties boisterous wedding brunch other side restaurant table would greeted one two servers finished taking order   So failed communicate but we'll deal   all heard place remarkable   After 23 minutes without Hello waiter serving all four those parties sat five started dine ditch if don't receive anything   Only then did waiter casually chatting cook dashed madly table looking suddenly concerned   We rattled requests off 40 minutes later food   remember food being above par all heard place remarkable but service left such bad taste mouth step foot location again   Small cups no refills didn't help   Short staffed?  Sure   But would liked heads before sat down under time crunch   After all heard place remarkable   Stay away  <EOR> This little hidden treasure wish many people didn't know about  before 9 am wait seated   Great hearty home cooked style taste dishes  Country Benny flavorful biscuit topped sausage patty poached egg delicious sausage gravy  absolutely delicious!!!
