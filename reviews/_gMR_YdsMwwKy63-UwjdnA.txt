Perfect place some wonton noodle soup  don't trek over Chinatown dishes  <EOR> This hands down new favorite place salt pepper pork chops! used food express but they've sadly changed way theirs  pork chops extra extra crispy place delivers crunch! 4 times now various coworkers haven't heard complaint  nice choice Chinese food traditional Hawaiian food those picky friends mine  There's something everyone! chicken katsu favorite well  also tried chicken cake noodle for first time reminded Hong Kong pan fried noodles emphasis meat less veggies  portions huge always more enough meal the ladies work friendly accommodating  only reason won't give 5 stars because air conditioning awful last two times there  mean could feel but everyone group sweating fanning between bites  keep coming back but maybe takeout more dining in  <EOR> Always fresh delicious  regular order Chinese food menu Orange chicken which overly breaded  Mongolian beef which always flavorful  takeout orders usually ready pretty quickly  average no more 10 minutes  <EOR> Whenever want loco moco would always blue diamond location now way closer always compelled musubi  just opened place very clean lots parking they're connected Taste   The ONLY part complain wish management would take note whenever order saimin anything does soup DINING always pack styrofoam all  full on go green tree hugger but REALLY WISH could eat soup without having pour noodles  feel wasteful use styrofoam  ordered saimin wonton noodle soup few times always comes this  When improve bump 5 star  Just give plastic plate bowl styrofoam  <EOR> This place life  When off diet all want gorge myself sleep off rest day   Katsu shrimp curry ridiculously delicious well mahi mahi   and always grab spam masubi side    You order online pick up    Say what?
