LOL bet watch more Kdrama too!!!! D <EOR> I would give place 4 star rating value flavor  Everything else from Cleanliness location outside surroundings ambience etc almost wants knock down 1  Originally headed Lotus Siam but closed  tried neighboring Korean restaurant closed too  rundown strip mall riddled Korean restaurants happened only open Sunday afternoon  honestly would never come type strip mall under any circumstances but lure yelps promise hard resist  parking lot barren! Tumble weeds gang pigeons hiding underneath broke down van  open yelp app just sure those 4 stars came recent reviews  walked walking into those salons ghost town  Outdated barren empty tables bussed posters food only decor  two ladies waited very friendly accommodating biggest reasons would give them more stars  looked over menu usuals wanted no dish could $10 which thought would pretty high way establishment looked  wanted walk but only ones girl really nice  ended ordering assortment meats grill ourselves good two comes rice drinks usual array pickled sides $35 95  grill vent clean  When she brought plate meat truly disturbed raw chicken juices same plate thinly sliced steak  if ask your chicken separate plate  She helped grill flavors different sweet other Korean restaurants patron but still good different interesting way  stuffed she still bringing meat most meat ever gotten any Korean restaurant  Everything needed more brought over promptly without extra charge without attitude  big deal because other Korean restaurants usually don't follow reservations giving extra sides actually into argument box  ladies checked frequently brought everything needed another reason wish could give them better score  end total $38 95 which  think pretty damn good all food  certain despite all negatives would rate place 3 stars but midway through review both experienced onslaught mild stomach agitation when boyfriend came restroom first words drop two stars yea  <EOR> From American married Korean perspective Ponchon best Las Vegas    Portions good    Food good    Shabu shabu two great    Prices slightly lowest town  <EOR> We came reading reviews yelp  seated table still sauce bits food table  then reseated another table also sauce table  All other tables looked worse  speaking food but cleanliness  Gross  Obviously left since no clean tables  <EOR> Great korean bbq!  I came late Friday night 9pm way back picking boyfriend airport  only ones initially felt keeping them closing but very accommodating friendly  good choice meat platter which brisket short ribs chicken pork belly  LOT meat but good finished all! believe $35 which felt good price amount food  employees cooked meat table sure if always if just did since only ones there  also give 8 side dishes most part pretty good   area where restaurant located looks bit shady but  quickly forgotten when taste food! <EOR>
