All coffee imported Ethiopia roasted a freshly brewed  girl chai tea latte tasted amazing  iced caramel latte which tasted good but little bit sweet milky taste could little stronger  Maybe should taken extra shot? However overall cute quiet coffee shop  would perfect place study free wifi! prices fair drinks range 3 4 50 however extra shots espresso $2 00 which think kind pricy but understandable since everything fresh imported Ethiopia  Would definitely back try other drinks <EOR> Well worth visit   Coffee Ethiopian influence new experience but glad delved into it   lounge dining area quiet intimate comfortable barrista knowledgeable friendly helpful   Most importantly coffee delicious   caramel macchiato type drink sweet creamy aromatic very satisfying   location difficult locate just street address but extra effort paid off   Damned good   soon can! <EOR> For those people know Kaldi's Ethiopia am told real thing  Ethiopian coffee shop chain Ethiopia Las Vegas  All coffee imported Ethiopia!
