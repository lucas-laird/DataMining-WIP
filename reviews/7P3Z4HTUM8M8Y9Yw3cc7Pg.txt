When order coffee other shops don't ring fresh brewed poured coffee   Maybe steamed hotter?  knows?   It OK one time stop but stick Sunrise simply having more vegan options like pastries sandwiches better tasting plain coffee and additions agave   <EOR> 10 10 would come back again amazing chocolate truffles! really enjoyed great atmosphere cafe!! <EOR> Come all time!

Pretty little unique gift would say  <EOR> Love place  Its local giant corporate chain  really good coffee treat customers well  really care shows  Every coffee drink just right    I visit almost everyday tried every special drinks  bad thing menu  Plus own pastries too  raspberry cheesecake croissant superb  <EOR> Walking notice atmosphere very comfy would expect days coffee house  beautiful selection truffles crafted in house display window if sweet tooth would totally recommend checking place out   I decided embark new journey coffees coffee houses yeah know am two decades late trendy but past always stuck plain ole coffee because whenever tried fancy coffee drink always extremely sweet  told lady behind counter worries surprise she didn't act problems boring which let's face but she nice helpful anyway! She suggested marshmallow latte me  Also lunchtime hungry even though she highly recommended lavender white chocolate scone opted chicken salad sandwich croissant   As far tell chicken salad only lunch option really surprised ready order 12 45 afternoon  fair finished making salad within few minutes order but still thought strange prep done earlier  sandwich very good croissant full butter crazy flaky kind but tamer version still delicious think works even better sandwich  I think flaky kind best enjoyed own but delicate sandwich  chicken salad well made but dried sweetened cranberries would preferred without  Maybe should gone lavendar white chocolate scone! But friend ordered same sandwich thought cranberries delicious just show things matter personal taste   The marshmallow latte excellent  little bit sweet but could still taste roasted coffee  very elegant beverage made feel having grown drink spite emotional immaturity! Fantastic suggestion barista!  I really torn whether whether give 4 5 stars  just back see happens next time! <EOR> So happy place opened right next me   walked dog last Sunday sat patio sipped coffee while reading   Happy be   Good coffee   Great atmosphere   Great pastries macaroons   wish few savory options pastries maybe quiche two but other great addition neighborhood  <EOR> Amazing little coffe shop !!!

This place = NO BUENO!!!! <EOR> I excited when saw box  Very cute packaging presentation!  First liquor filled truffle blown away flavor YUMMMY    The reason only gave 3 stars because very pricey cake bombs just awful  Every dry couldn't finish any six included gift  Perhaps stored extras weren't fresh because holiday? sure return but sure if stick truffles they'll bomb  <EOR> A quaint coffee shop alcohol infused truffles      We stopped check place really enjoyed sights sounds smells tastes   I ordered iced peach tea iced Americano along chocolate baileys infused truffle coconut Malibu infused truffle  tea delcious use Barney Sons good quality  Americano also really deep flavorful  far truffles coconut preference  alcohol nice mild touch rich chocolate run soaked cake    This small business supports other small businesses could see shelves goats milk burbon caramel    It looks comfy spot stay awhile plenty real plants comfy chairs easy listening mud ice  don't keep asking water nice little self serve station   I'll back try lunch menu items  <EOR> Great Place nice quiet Coffee Tipsy very good Wish place open longer  <EOR> Great little coffee shop off beaten track! Nestled between Southern Hills Hospital medical complex sure check place out! Freshly brewed coffee tea homemade truffles goodies! tried Peach Ginger black tea today iced great! <EOR> This coffee shop located odd spot off 215 Sunset medical building area  Pretty smart them though everyone stop before break shifts! Anyways I'm a fan iced coffee did right red eye which iced coffee shot espresso added  could tell just new BEAUTIFUL espresso machine because every worker watching poured delicious drink! also opted cranberry scone best while  funny actually never ever Starbucks not fan coffee but cranberry orange scone let tell Tipsy blew them water landslide  Perhaps because bake prepare everything house fresh every morning!  They also cute little chocolate truffles did try time but sure knowing shall sometime soon  The only downer point only open week understand getting everything situated still  But very coffee shop homie warm yet  love take computer enjoy coffee pastries while getting some work done just didn't feel would comfy doing just yet  Although faith place full warm month so! <EOR> Absolutely delicious!!!! fun concoction espresso coffee drinks  Devils Frappe which vanilla ice cream blended toffee syrup espresso  usually can't sweet things early morning gamble    cut some sweetness added another shot worked perfectly  thought gonna more frozen side but case which perfect liking   They also adorable little treats tiny chocolate balls filled alcohol    back try those!! <EOR> Went Tipsy day when looking local coffee shop  tried cookie butter latte delicious!! staff super friendly shop super cute! Gave four stars because feel they're bit overpriced  Definitely indulge every now then though! <EOR> This place adorable quaint staff super sweet rating no way influenced service ambiance  Honestly ambiance terrific there's even charger pod some tables many electronic devices   I love coffee  love flavor coffee espresso value delightful craft beverage highlights those flavors  All things considered would recommend Tipsy's lattes someone does flavor coffee  syrups powerful sweet Salted Caramel Nutella latte which sounds amazing right? tasted sugar milk  know yelpers love things if keep keepin' place your spot!  I also disappointed pastry selection  Since focus predominantly truffles which feels odd combination balance such sweet beverages opted only non truffle food remaining which biscotti  bad great    <EOR> I use lot Tipsy but anymore     hard find shop parking small     coffee just okay     now Vegas many great cafe   Not many choices pastry <EOR> We spoiled Tipsy Coffee House cater coffee breakfast for The Southern Nevada Association Education Young Child's Fall Mini Conference! WOW absolutely blown away! regular decaf organic locally roasted coffees simply divine superb really exquisitely delicate delicious! Everyone raving entire day! Tipsy also spared no detail offering gourmet breakfast sandwiches delectable array signature chocolate truffles which proved talk event ! Look Las Vegas there's new cafe confection rock star town TIPSY NAME O! <EOR> I Tipsy couple days ago first time  ordered latte almond milk ham egg cheese croissant  latte really good  coffee nice well rounded flavor burnt tasting Starbucks  sandwich took bit but because fresh order nothing frozen! worth wait because croissant nicely toasted buttery while eggs light fluffy  staff friendly courteous  definitely come back! <EOR> The first time came into coffee shop skeptical because small looked outside but when walked smell fresh coffee baked goods filled relaxing feel  place great ! <EOR> Great place   Internet fast   sell drip mug free refills   Definite bonus!  Pretty conveniently located   Nice people   Privately owned!  Definitely must try  <EOR> Came quick lunch today chicken salad sandwich  really good enjoyed flavored iced tea  took star away because customer service  did even hi hello bye any employees  <EOR> It strange location but sight welcome middle nondescript surroundings  While easily visible didn't seem very accessible   When friend made way greeted purchased couple ginger scones which delicious  inquired iced teas said could any tea iced tea  earl gray friend americano  saw barista preparing tea tea bag being steeped thought could bode well only steep hot water any ice would dilute it  She didn't call counter but sitting while checked were  Sure enough iced tea watery but terrible friends coffee just okay   I starving expected some savory options but only pre made sandwiches  While sounded decent know refrigerated bread never good pricey almost $8 pop  pre made sandwich? Meh   I'd stick freshly made scones  also offer some boozy chocolates truffles   There two other patrons when ordered chocolate  took table inspected while  Eventually brought back counter let barista know given wrong chocolate  She takes already given them set down table puts back case! Kind grossed out   Some coffee drinks involve ice cream syrups cake them  just really thing  straightforward coffee drinks guess purist  more adventurous teas though wish gotten Chai could maybe give more positive review since own Chai mix  respect trying coffee spot much needed area  Unfortunately didn't win over  <EOR> Tipsy Coffee House right next door Southern Hills Hospital  If you're looking latte side order cute nurse attractive doctor scrubs your place  shop decorated very well lots cool artwork fish tank  plenty seats usually pretty empty  only complaint often stuck waiting 10 15 minutes drink since only person working  All baristas extremely friendly hand deliver your coffee  large selection truffles nutella drinkss every girls favorite!  Tipsy great place study  quiet empty drinks good! <EOR> This best locally own coffee shops town  Even names coffee drinks great  housemaid peanut butter blow your mind  glad found hidden gem  <EOR> Love coffee croissants! run favorite lot chocolate because never early enough weekends  But when great! I need try chicken salad croissant though! <EOR> Finally found real coffee shop! barista few times looking real espresso coffee  Vegas think found it! had   One overly sweet sugary drinks ice despite all flavours sugar still tasted coffee BTW it where Coffee Bean Einsten's Charbucks sugary delicious but doesn't taste coffee   The price really pleased too  expensive something $5 drink $2 americano but again comparatively other establishments within reason   The barista could friendlier    But then coffee slingers jacked caffeine hyped probably no fault hers   I'm very excited found new coffee joint! <EOR> After finishing doctors appointment stopped little gem shop  adorable! super cute little chocolates other baked goods along some knick knacks purchase tumblers shirts    I opted iced coconut coffee soy milk  very good! over powering flavor very good flavor   I wish place closer I'd definitely come more often  Also drive thru would great quicker access when just passing but probably would draw away little small business feel  <EOR> I loved place chocolate yummy place quiet relaxed while staff lovely  games people sit down play friends  only thing found bummer early close times  However understand because location staying open later evening really just waste money them  Still sad   <EOR> A cute cafe bakery Tipsy unique cozy drinks delicious sweet treats accompany them  Most products appear concocted assembled in house including truffles whole place modern but homemade feel sets apart trendier perhaps more shallow joints    I felt welcome start visit thanks incredibly patient engaging staff warmth happy customers  barista very kind personable even met regular drink named him! Tells lot just local place is    I thoroughly enjoyed homemade chai chocolate dipped strawberry regular mister kindly ordered trying decide get  commonplace chai tea chocolate Tipsy provides nice distinct take both can't pinpoint exactly but whatever glad they've taken time personalize formulas set themselves apart    I'm hoping open little later eventually maybe when people finally discover there's much more charming option Starbucks down street  definitely dropping semi regularly see they're stirring next! <EOR> Tipsy best coffee ever tasted! now favorite place coffee! tried Americana strong fresh  handmade chocolate also must try  surprised some infused real liquor! new item which mango pineapple crepe cake sweet very yummy!
