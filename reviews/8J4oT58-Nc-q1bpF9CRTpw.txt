She actually placed hot iron plate front little baby! Hello!? Baby sees baby grabs! trying tell push plate course fast enough  he 2nd degree burn  NEVER come back again! Bad service stupid servers  <EOR> As Las Vegas residents seen done just everything then some! place keep going back time time again    Each time visit find place clean comfortable teeming friendly capable staff  moment walk moment walk door staff seem above beyond    We two small children patience definitely appreciated! food always comes delicious within reasonable amount time    I realize people on especially sheesh! tend knock food calling precooked reheated etc  keep mind people need consider Applebees fast food bigger selection nicer seating area  Its bit more expensive most chain fast food stores but  because better food more better service yet leave dissatisfied!  If want fine fresh dining then probably don't want place Chilis Applebees  exist purposes laid back family friendly version sit down dining   Instead if feel you're getting Michelin star quality cuisine casino restaurants place strip blow all your money there    But family four budget want tasty food nice atmosphere welcoming environment ALWAYS return Applebees! <EOR> Typical chain restaurant  menu food OK  expect price right? rib eye steak which decently price  ordered veggies baked potato sides  did know baked potato extra $4+ wow! baked potato? should included entree  steak surprisingly good seasoned well even though probably cheap meat  think place hit miss depending your mood like  narrowly passed grade book  <EOR> Arrived 6 20 sat less minute  Service quick   Food equal other Applebee's better  <EOR> Truly horrible service!  food wasn't much better either  daughter ordered new pulled pork bacon ham sandwich  Wow!  Talk looking picture  Sad looking ham puréed pork just gross  Server asked everything told terrible  She ignored us  full price dinner daughter potato chips  What?  My rubles overlooked fries over seasoned  mother law fiesta chicken  only fiesta greasy cheese completely costing tiny piece chicken  disgusting looking    And don't think you're going refills  Even while looking empty glasses server walked away  stopped ask refills she started walking away    And just case server reads this  2% tip wasn't mistake  feeling generous  <EOR> We hadn't Applebee's long time but decided give them more chance   mistake!  Walked waited 10 minutes hostess   Even customers came find but couldn't   Finally comes asks help us   told party 3 she then asks take name because she needs check see tables available   KIDDING ME!  already waited 10 minutes dining room over half empty just seating open table   just told leaving comment nice day! apology having wait 10 minutes nothing!  way where managers?  MAYBE someone should dining room dinner time   Just thought  <EOR> This really good choice   came party six everything smoothly    food great service   also really cool touch pads each table now but tried pay wouldn't accept Visa   sure why but nevertheless still cool  <EOR> Ordered Triple Pork Dare Ya sandwich  Looked NOTHING picture but ever?

Thanks! <EOR> DJ bar awesome  She never stops constantly going  She works hard gave wonderful customer service <EOR> Good service  food however just blah  definitely don't recommend Quesadilla burger  <EOR> Applebees gone down hill  Well least one  Service ok  But food sucked  Which sucks because used love spot  glass water bunch gross stuff floating it  spinach dip weird taste  daughters yogurt kids menu tasted sour  wife's ribs tasted bitter  just all bad unfortunately  If cook food better all would well  <EOR> Mediocre name Applebees  Maybe expect much? Maybe just used higher quality food? Maybe snob? Tough meat WAY oversalted everything  Nothing tasted fresh all  chicken fingers rubbery very good  Actually nothing very good  grilled chicken something pretty gross    even when just tried eat chicken breast itself tasteless other mass proliferation salt   I remember back day used Applebees burgers  don't know if burgers still any good but don't know I'd return even find out  <EOR> Customer service always great  plus  Anytime any Applebee's location same thing    Mac n cheese honey pepper chicken  Usually when chicken already covered honey pepper sauce delicious  three times come no sauce chicken    BARELY speckled on  third time came specifically asked server sure chicken already tossed sauce  excited because delicious   however when food as see picture still no sauce chicken  really annoyed specifically ask meal prepared appears menu still didn't  having overly fried chicken finger top pasta  Secondly when blondie which also every time stale old  could tell fresh even made day  texture felt expired bread wasn't even warm  always assumed reheated brownies anyway but just disgusting did taste dessert all  After three strikes returning location  <EOR> This first time Applebee's location busy Friday evening  think server worked hard did very best  I'd give five stars amazing effort  However don't think enough people working maybe people called President's Day weekend?? Idk       Pros place clean food good value  ordered mozzarella sticks which crispy outside gooey inside  daughters Mac n Cheese eaten quickly no complaints  younger daughter ordered chicken strips did solid job there  Next side salad Tortilla soup  tortilla soup really hit spot! salad fresh nicely prepared    Cons Super busy customers although tried  appeared staff couldn't keep up  example another server brought food she gave wrong items  but quickly right plates  real server running around constantly drinks other orders  found location loud crowded which didn't mind all but some folks might    Personally Applebee's Henderson Stephanie better  location in experience pays more attention customer isn't rat race feeling  However food location decent price relatively cheap  <EOR> My first time eating Applebees very long time all give 2 stars  waitress awesome! She very attentive super sweet  did 2 $25  ordered Bourbon Street Chicken Shrimp  says Cajun seasoned but couldn't  taste anything because BEYOND salty  saying something because love salt  But wasn't enough water world quench thirst left parched! all soaked salt then seasoned salt cooked  just permeated salt  No Cajun flavor whatsoever  potatoes came side frozen potatoes  only good thing ate artichoke spinach dip appetizer   Definitely going back anytime soon  <EOR> I am normally Applebee's person but say say bar table bartender waiter he fabulous   food but service fabulous ! <EOR> We've coming years today worst visit ever  ordered parm steak shrimp  ordered steak medium came well done sent back time came back rare sent back  time gotten second steak husband just finished entree  told them never mind don't want it  offered something soup  No thanks why bother point eat meal family wait insincere apology tell meat thermometer probably working   think there's change management because visits consistently gotten worse  Last two visits cocktails bugs them won't order bar anymore  guess won't order kitchen anymore 8 years last visit  <EOR> This mine fiancé's favorite Applebee's location Vegas  eat lot places  Everything really fairly priced tastes good  love two $25 which includes entrée 2 dinners  usually steak which surprisingly good! garlic mashed broccoli  hubby usually gets three cheese mac cheese honey chicken tenders always sneak some lol  Car side great option when don't feel fast food but don't want sit down restaurant  usually decide do   love option easy order online phone ! some girls little slow coming car when first see but other great experience nice family restaurant! <EOR> Took wife in laws dinner last evening enjoyed fun evening   service good most part food excellent   ordered 6 ounce sirloin steak mashed potatoes green beans   steak cooked perfectly mashed potatoes delicious BUT green beans limp fresh hardly any taste probably frozen food   But I'd recommend good family restaurant  <EOR> This absolute worst experience here  only waitress DJ rude but she messed order  asked no pico ended getting it  It'd understandable if busy but completely dead  when she asked things said gotten pico it  She offered remade then tried charge twice mistake  When said gotten charged twice then she said she removed  But she said nothing when she gave receipt double order there  returning! <EOR> Had lunch over weekend pleasant meal   Oriental Chicken Salad always wonderful   Waitress kept drinks re filled kept checking us   granddaughter Grilled Cheese she enjoyed drink served covered kids cup which also re filled   Overall great place good meal  <EOR> I would give experience 0 star if could  service sucked  ordered artichoke dip appetizer 2 burgers  waitress bartender Amber sucked big time  She stood bar chatting customer ignored us  25 minutes 2nd drink finally bar ask if getting appetizer soon  She asks haven't gotten yet?

Like skimpy portions?   Like high prices garbage?   Then love Applebees!!!   Pure disappointment store first last visit    Not only dish bland cold overly greasy fried mess but entire party issues all well    Salads OK only thing may saving grace    Everything else frozen precooked heated food taste if sitting around awhile    The service OK however hit miss really depends server may end with  right way wrong! 50 50 chance take dining more commercial restaurants    There just many great places eat Las Vegas world fraction cost! would never again waste money below mediocre quality!   The meals creative no flair real flavor! Whoever responsible menu planning needs dropped! Applebees come see give few great suggestion's turn your bad menu into something wowing!   Disappointed beyond all comprehension!   Side note *** dish ordered buttermilk breaded fried shrimp no longer menu now replaced double crunch shrimp dinner  Wow shocker!!!  Yes maybe double crunch shrimp fare better original menu item buttermilk fried shrimp soggy flavorless   I am sure many complaints issued such mine such horrid dish! <EOR> I always liked majority food Applebee's  Don't know going but location disaster! Everytime come crowded hostess just can't keep all customers coming in  last time overheard someone saying see many tables open why seating people? Can't remember name but also server very slow believe twice within past year  She took 15 minutes greet take drink orders  food table never saw again  Thankfully those pay table devices didn't wait check!  The food usually good lot choose menu  Spinach Artichoke Dip favorite appetizer #2 list chain restaurants CPK best one! wouldn't recommend getting steak unless want fork knife struggles your frustration level rise LOL  While thumbs down serving Pepsi products   2 stars because food pay devices! Won't returning location because slow AF!! <EOR> Just came home Applebee's!  excellent dinner server Isak friendly courteous pleasure talk to  The food delicious  but Cedar Grill Chicken  fantastic enjoyed every bite  fantastic piece chicken served Rice apple topping!!  chicken 5 star restaurants before but even better definitely back again dinner sincerely recommend!!! <EOR> We absolutely loved server Anyssa just waited working lunch   Food Applebee's same however she sweet amazing! <EOR> Dominic food server delivers five star service! quite unusual places noted  <EOR>
