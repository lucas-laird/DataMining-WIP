We've sampled yellow curry panang curry beef basil pineapple fried rice pad thai pad kea mao papaya salad  favorite panang curry! Omgosh delish until home checked calorie content  Panang curry typically 40 50g's fat serving  Ouch! Well anything much fat better worth I'd say serving panang curry worth it  pad thai greasy side kind bland when think what's it  definitely prefer pad kea mao because more veggies tastes basil yum!!! compared you'd pad thai just bean sprouts peanuts   I did enjoy papaya salad  first time trying but $10 salad grated green papaya dressing just tasted fish sauce? Did give wrong sauce? don't know  Regardless back Archi's! cute ambiance some delicious options  Definitely try panang curry pad kea mao! <EOR> I ordered pad Thai lunch special two wontons instead egg roll informed won ton skin only    no sense? called back asked if would've ordered egg roll if just skin she said no comes vegetables  don't understand why give wonton skin if advertise wonton <EOR> best thai food Vegas   Came every week when lived Vegas  Now am coming everytime visit  <EOR> I love Archi's   While place most often Thai food place when want decent assortment dishes menu Thai food prepared consistently well   There's enough variety satisfy you're looking most time appetizers salads soups entrees including curry noodle dishes desserts   eaten W  Sahara restaurant Rainbow Blvd  restaurant found food service consistently good both   Lunch portions almost big dinner portions include egg roll small soup   They're definitely worth choosing during lunch hour   Dinner always delicious   those enjoy Thai food you'll see many your usual favorites there   If you're new variety Asian cuisine consider adding your choice meat Pad Thai everyone seems love dish Pad Se Ew Pad Prik Pow Broccoli     If you're mood curry eight dishes chose they're all good   If you'd rather soup highly recommend Tom Yum Tom Kha  Tom Kha essentially Tom Yum but coconut milk added soup creamier rather brothy  I prefer fried Egg Rolls they're served warm right fryer rather fresh Spring Rolls served cold    if you've never tried don't forget treat yourself Thai Iced Tea   They're almost sweet but still taste fantastic   almost liquid dessert   Finally most Thai restaurants dial spiciness down   waitstaff ask conservative if you're little nervous dial there   You'll start feel heat anything above moderate level if you're adventurous Thai hot   But better spicy food  Parking at Sahara location ample since restaurant located storefront   When enter parking lot look Regal Cinema   Archi's right  <EOR> I stopped other night before movie without having done any research prior yelping which very unusual risky me! menu vast prices pretty decent area selection ambiance  drunken noodles beef HUGE portion delivered  Tender wide rice noodles arranged bed fresh veggies wood ear mushrooms lettuce flavorful beef  Around $13 w tax + tip believe quite bargain provided leftovers! Would back if area  <EOR> Normally would say Archies favorite Thai food places but time pleasant  walked busy atmosphere took girls walking three times before greeted  place order 1 23 just basic pad Thai some red curry     patiently waiting 1 55 she says coming just minute  Finally food enjoy home well pad Thai great usual but having bad experiences curry lately always extra careful when eating it    course giant black wavy piece hair almost puked  couldn't believe literally still shock writing review! didn't pay 23$ plus tip food nasty hair it! just don't know if any decent Thai food restaurants left town discouraging  <EOR> I usually love Archies however tonight horrible experience time walked in  guy front trying many things wasn't seating people timely manner when tables available  Then some name crossed off waiting list sat people came us   he did seat soon brought t attention but shouldn't to  Then placed order brought dinner date wrong order wait  mine cold  Then rushed boxes taking dishes away however took forever bring check  wasn't good service used to  Hope act together won't continue coming here    <EOR> This would 5 star if food alone   would 4 star if only issue fact rice portion comes red curry small  became three because service wasn't very good  admit give another try future think every place off night some patrons  <EOR> Not authentic!! very fooled pictures order pad see ew   expect Chinese Broccoli due previous Yelp pictures showed did look same also no flavor noodles very mushy definitely fresh noodles top very bad customer service which going let pass but food good leave review  <EOR> I am huge soup fan just love shrimp soup  Very Fresh tasting back here  other thai places town which reviewed but near house Summerlin very good  <EOR> I heard many people rave archie's agree!   unaware close place home which definitely plus!

But good eat anyway  would suggest getting salads soups spicy because spice tends overwhelm dishes  Better add more spice later sorry  Besides lunch specials few other favorite dishes mine Panang curry Massaman curry Tom Kha Gai soup  If season try mango sticky rice dessert  Love it! <EOR> My wife loves Tom Yum soup Thai iced tea great   pretty much everything menu  always visit place when we're Summerlin  <EOR> I've coming Archi's years! The rainbow warm springs location service never disappoints staff friendly quick  Also atmosphere always extremely clean modernized nice cultural feel  don't started food!

I'd back but they're high list Thai places Vegas  <EOR> My first time coming friends Bday think tolerating spending time Original Thai BBQ known Archi's whole time   Best Thai dish Vegas service great also   Friend recommended Chee Choo catfish curry sauce  Ordered medium spicy which spicy all but other still right touch flavor curry sauce good  But trying friends spicy beef eggplant made wish ordered instead  <EOR> Hands down best Thai Restarunt Las vegas definitely worth checking if u love Thai food portion sizes good great location great prices  Customer services good  better but don't mind because food execellente <EOR> Mediocre food poor service  ask more water forget  only see twice thats it  <EOR> If Thai food craving don't feel driving Lotus Siam Archi's satisfies craving  You're gonna find world dishes but kind dishes become staples Thai food found America  Service always prompt attentive speedy when you're ordering takeout  <EOR> Nice place eat tasty food service good enough prices affordable staff fast kind will definitely come back lunch dinner my review big enough will update later  <EOR> In fairness food ok hopefully clean if don't run restroom soon  Negative point service slow missed starter soup which came lunch special never given though everyone around sipping soup  Totally disappointed! <EOR> If you're looking some solid Thai food place be   definitely appeals American palate  food great introduction those looking something different savory  <EOR> Very good Thai food reasonable prices  spice level 2 which plenty husband 5 which bit much him  Pad Thai spring rolls favorite dishes  <EOR> I Archi's pad thai pad see ew   especially because use chinese broccoli  south rainbow location good too  <EOR> We huge birthday needed catered house Archie decided on     If weren't friends family getting then may never heard glad did     This far best Thai food Las Vegas lot choose from   Everything perfect     Pad Thai basil beef curry egg rolls green salad fried rice all perfect     I've tried several different Thai restaurants if good catered then can't imagine good must if dine restaurant  <EOR> Food always great! really spicy careful when say 10    Only reason its 4 stars because service great   Understand extremely busy during lunch time but should excuse bad service   now order pick only   Highly recommended  <EOR> I tried chicken pad prik king first time fell love! actually craving dish ever since first tried it  also really enjoyed pad see ew which solid noodle dish most thai restaurants those aren't familiar order    Archi's also great peanut dressing few extra dollars side extra peanut dressing throw salad during week  Overall great takeout experience  <EOR> This used favorite thai place  used order almost every week  love pad see ew  past few times ordered very bad  flavor bad enjoyable all  ordering again  quality food gone down lot very disappointing  <EOR> Archi's Thai Cafe changed outlook Thai food   I've never good experiences Thai places past which pretty much made avoid Thai restaurants general   All remember bean sprouts  peanuts LOTS them   So little reluctant try Archi's but am GLAD DID   Can't believe waited long   chicken pad thai good chicken fried rice bomb  pleasantly surprised see everything bean sprouts peanuts!    We ordered those 2 dishes eggplant dish Thai iced tea which came $40 including tax   wasn't thrilled eggplant little bitter harder used to   serving portions fairly large pretty much ended taking 75% food home   Yeah pretty ridiculous ordered much food lunch but served nice leftovers I would DEFINITELY again   also take out!  few locations sure call right place your order! <EOR> Waited 10 15 minutes  Order food waited 1 hour before food came  During waiting food server never stopped give updates anything  Food good but great  Ordered Fried Egg side came cold  Server told she new one  30 seconds later same egg cut half soggy    must put microwave  Service 3 5 Wait Time 1 5 Food Quality 2 5 <EOR> I've eaten few times  food very good service ok  lunch specials priced great  feel turn much better service  friendliness staff lacks genuine feelings   On last visit ordered cola served cola glass ice  Really? No soda fountain! No fresh brewed tea? Ok food good but also deliver very spaced awkward timing all parties receive food same time  <EOR> The name Archi's doesn't scream Thai cuisine anything Asian matter but once passed unusual name place definitely better Thai restaurants Las Vegas chain otherwise     Tom yum soup delicious really judge Thai restaurant quality traditional Thai soup  Lunch specials 11 a m  3 p m  very good deal equally scrumptious!  Overall interior restaurant very pleasant appealing menu prices very reasonable  If Thai food should stop sometime! <EOR> Archi's Las Vegas Thai chain 3 locations must admit recent obsession Thai Noodle caused forget much enjoy some curry noodles Archi's particularly neighborhood location    When first moved town Archi's spot Thai  food great which later but think distinguishes Archi's most restaurants Las Vegas interior  done brilliant job transforming strip mall space into warm clean welcoming space  coherent sense design which puts ease some reason  Maybe just feel Archi good handle things    And he does! being little Thai adventurous eating all around town confidently say when food good really good  Granted suffer inconsistency time time spice scale baffles me  3 mind blowingly hot despite fact scale supposedly 10  Consider yourself warned    Despite when want curry Pad Kee Mow very respectable eggplant dish am happy visit Archi's  tofu stir fry noodle dishes most flavorful but obsessed Pad Kee Mow least month  became little frustrated when vegetable selection kept changing  hard give girl solid helping real vegetables baby corn does count noodles? However last visit told waitress lots yummy vegetables please apparently secret phrase unlock garden delight because mega veggies  Splendid!  The service always no water glass empty amazing when visited  Food comes quickly hot  Servers always nice   I teetering between 3 4 Archi's but Archi am slapping 4 your establishment because although food little inconsistent really really appreciate atmosphere cleanliness service when curry stars align food definitely fan worthy  <EOR> Once again Archie's came through tasty lunch  ginger chicken well prepared  Always worth little extra brown rice  Both locations visit tend same quality consistency which nice  <EOR> 3 words YELLOW CHICKEN CURRY  curry paste thick sort but rather mixture  sweet spicy yumness! spices dish overwhelming all provide taste no other  most curry dishes choose spicy range 1 10  love spicy food let tell ya 7 pushing but tried 8 while very spicy still taste well enough enjoy dish  far everything tried delicious Pork Phad Thai Tofu soup Tom Kha Shrimp  If anything bad say Archi's would fried rice mediocre most definitely better fried rice before but its terrible just bland   sure try Thai Tea your meal DELICIOUS!

I understand place popular spot Vegas always packed during dinner time  However service down drastically during busy hours  two  occasions where wait 30 minutes check taken care of  Despite occasional inconvenience still keep coming back because food great  suggest ordering take during busy hours because it'll take awhile before you'll seated  <EOR> Dishes order awesome 1  pad kee mao pork spicy although only 5 plenty veggies  Weird lettuce underneath though  Pretty darn awesome  2  pineapple fried rice addictive! 3  pad thai tad sweet but still tasty 4  house curry rich other curries but still alright  Large portions good service reasonable prices  I'd come again  <EOR> Archi's always delivers! first time location gotta say other locations better  much bigger read more busy crowded service left something desired  But once dropped hint main guy things alot more smoothly  HIGHLY recommend red curry papaya salad  Just warning salad WAAY spicier expected conserved level ask for  Also flat noodles chicken pretty solid  highly recommend Archi's anyone everyone! <EOR> We quite disappointed ordered meal share portion quite adequate some leftover however hot only ordered '2' hot    other good service clean probably tasty if could taste over hot    <EOR> It seems though give half portion when order but still pay full price   Which catch 22 because when dine take long your order gets annoying <EOR> Really Archies??!!   put trust every time eat location    daughters favorite place but see 42 demerits health district closure very concerning    eggs meat 20 degrees off safe temp???  kitchen gross      dont know happened if being cheap lazy just no concern your customers health   worst part knowing family place allowed happen      shame you      <EOR> My third favorite three Archi's locations around town  farthest therefor frequent least    All same favorite dishes apply location  Curries noodles soups eggplant always favorite  still steer clear chicken dishes  Pork tofu catfish shrimp way usually   My Thai obsession knows know boundaries Archi's all locations always feed addiction  Cheap clean good service food   all ask great restaurant Archi's delivers every time    I don't order drinks either  hate having pay refills  Only favorite Archi's Rainbow fountain   Good location especially right before movies  <EOR> This Thai restaurant quite ways Strip   another restaurat before Archi's but restaurant long waiting time   decided try place instead   Fortunately no wait time   table just waiting party 4   ambiance relaxing restaurant nicely decorated   Staff attentive without being intrusive food came quickly   So ordered shared   Beef Pad see ew $8 95 ginger ginger ginger chicken $9 95 spicy chicken basil fried rice $9 95 green curry chicken $9 95 Thai iced tea $3 95   Everything tasted fine   outstanding but above average     Las Vegas many restaurants choose from   If area craving Thai food would certainly drop again   If area then would come all way eat   Overall though Archi's Thai Cafe good spot eat   If hometown I'd rate them 4 stars   Vegas though because all choices there    I only give them 3 stars  <EOR> Eh honestly don't see hype about  Pad thai mediocre say least had no tofu noodles tasted shrimp never tasted before spicy specifically said no spice   Service below eh but above awful   asked extra napkins instead responding he walks away friend asked if he heard me  waited see he would before said anything he ended walking station napkins   is difficult say sure  yes ? worst thai place but definitely visiting OSHA San Fran next month! <EOR> Great meal  Tom yum soup hits spot cool day   Last couple trips seems soup entrees come very close each other  would prefer eat soup before entree arrives   But solid meal everytime  <EOR> The food good  establishment nice decor  give sodas cup ice    The service less okay  waitress only would come drop off drinks soup meal  She never stopped ask if needed refill  <EOR> Always consistently good  isn't fastest service but food delicious restaurant clean staff friendly  just don't come if hurry take out  Can't compare other Thai because always pleased don't feel need elsewhere  <EOR> Spent $50 restaurant couldn't eat any food  putting place Top 10 list worst service worst food  husband ordered takeout 5 30 evening told food ready pick 25 minutes  arrived 5 55 pay bill  waited until 6 30 before takeout ready  During wait asked girl why taking long?
