Bun lettuce? tomato sauce your fresh crisp good  But almost no beef ! <EOR> What say?  money best freshest burger around  Don't really fries much although appreciate fact fresh cut  Maybe need use another brand oil improve deep frying technique? <EOR> I haven't checked other reviews In N Out but may only denizen U  S  can't give four five stars   simply impressed very limited menu its claim fame burger itself   Plain simple okay but single isn't much bigger Mickey D's   minced onion bun good   But appreciate alternatives fries just aren't any   Not being regular wasn't familiar items aren't posted menu but knew existed asked   kid register enumerated few things when hubby heard say Veggie burger he decided healthier alternative change   When food ready hubs dug only discover veggie burger nothing more lettuce tomato sandwich!  manager chided clerk being more specific husband ended regular burger   We came because hungry late knew open   But remain unimpressed quick return  <EOR> Awesome Burgers! really down sauce so   prefer Ketchup Mustard spread lol   <EOR> nothing special particular location  Line always crazy long but move fairly quickly  every time Im craving fast food burger late nite! <EOR> One day met girl said she'd never N even though she's lived LV ever  think she lying just saying I'd outraged take there  worked    If N then need right now  Seriously  Here's you're going double double everything animal style fries shake  If don't know animal style means then need online search secret menu! actual menu only consists hamburger cheeseburger double double  Also please don't those people waits line 5 minutes then no idea want when you're up  probably guy behind saying Really? THREE things pick from! Everything N fresh  meat delicious bread super soft vegetables crisp  whatever reason even ketchup tastes better  only thing dislike little N aware commit sacrilege fries  They're good but personally fries Wendy's Jack Box more    As reviewer Cathy L wrote N Out! eat! <EOR> yuck!!! disgrace!!!! im cali when n order dont some half a** excuse your order pretty  much any where vegas   Im guessin just livin vegas life style money f*ck customers but hey thats just opinion! well done fries means soggy limp fries means golden crispy fries just case staff doesnt know protien style!!!   dont scared just means wrap lettuce dont fu*k entire burger!!!!omg company prides itself customer service please try place im just sayin if your first dont judge!!!!! better!!! <EOR> I'd give location more stars but last experience wasn't greatest  received food home  half way through eating double double noticed meat just way red against better judgment took another bite definitely tasted raw ish  Threw rest away very upsetting <EOR> IN N rocks  else say?  There always always super duper long line drive thru sometimes wait 10 minutes sometimes 30  But know information going in  always wait IN N OUT because all made order  least wait long Fatburger   Employees nice good location drive easily  <EOR> Wow! place crazy!  The food great line moved really fast many people little place once   Look secret menu before go! Ask free stickers if try something off it   I burger combo animal style fries  Yes animal style!  Animal style thousand island dressing onions put over fries even burgers think   I didn't it    But burger really good!  Don't bathrooms wreck broken! <EOR> The best fast food burger    period! worth small wait them your food fresh  burgers deliciously seasoned addition raw onion them delicious! milkshakes also thick tasty  <EOR> Only reason why gave location 4 star because long wait time drive thru dine in  know off freeway major intersection but lines always long  Aside never wrong n out  <EOR> First time location  Ordered two double doubles everything doubled including onions lettuce  Protein style  juicy all right spots thevwait staff spot on  <EOR> Just know right away BUSIEST N location Las Vegas  think most took once 30 min but when busy pretty quick 5 7 min so  Since busy location dining room slightly bigger  you'll probably see lot people all over world since over heard many them say straight airport its list come here   My personal favorite just cheeseburger no onions light spread order fries all box lid  Reason being seals moisture fries soft  just personal preference because down side fries hard very quickly but its cuz made fresh   But if don't mind onions  would definately try Animal Style  Its basically extra spread grilled onions  made your fries animal style too  if u wanna healthy ask protein style which burger wrapped lettuce instead bun  <EOR> Staff friendly efficient fast  Restaurant looked clean could see  order right food good  course recommend location  Enjoy <EOR> I love N Out! Simple delicious inexpensive some best customer service there  love people location but gets extremely busy parking lots size does support amount customers regular basis  only downfall wait  Granted all long wait time but due parking lot waited multiple times road just waiting turn actual line  <EOR> Finally ate first time  double double best burgers ever had  Now can't stop going back!!!!! <EOR> Flavor Flav said best don't    don't don't don't believe hype   Ordering Super Secret Menu decent burger whole grilled onion slice key but never read impossible cook good fries frying potato once  Lame limp tasteless  Even ordering well done fries just sure they're cold when you're done burger   At place where hype freshness ingredients milkshakes tap machine   If you're California chances OMG TOTALLY LOVE PLACE  Put Burger Midwest you'll see die quick death because they're just good   The place quite obviously stripped down Steak 'n Shake since opened 15 years later   In prefect world Fatburger would control every location since superior every way   If know real food should then eating just doubt mankind's superiority dominant species planet    If majority Las Vegas think Taco Bell best tacos you'll love place    Mediocrity rules! <EOR> I guess hopes reading much but    didn't find anything special   cheap  good but burger tasted many other chain burgers had   Maybe hit off day but    didn't hype   Location clean service fast! <EOR> Conveniently located near work location   Food service consistently very good   option grilled onions   menu hasn't changed  okay because perfected recipes offered   work fast but doesn't stop long drive through lines occur regularly certain times day   learned some patterns know long before certain time day [after work] good   Otherwise drive through starts getting longer longer and     Las Vegas needs more locations! <EOR> FIX YOUR FRIES!  I've loved In N Out's burgers since kid they're good today then  opinion best burgers price range   But your fries suck  guys brag fresh ingredients but consistently worst fries any drivethru  They're dried out  Every single time  McD better  BK better  Cane's better  Wendy's too   Also shakes 50% foam  What's that?  In N Out   I love you  lifelong fan  But your fries consistently lousy  Please open making improvements change those fries family doesn't extra stop McD fries every time   Thanks <EOR> This probably worse fast food ever ate literally ordered just some French fries then literally sit down called number handed stale warm fries never again here <EOR> Animal style fries no spread extra extra grilled onions favorite  often remark fresh everything wonderful staff members are!   This location slightly sketchy area   a lot drive thru business but always enough seats everyone inside  Less wait time order! <EOR> Super packed still pretty quick  really need review this? Try normal double double if dont it    somewhere else  don't need waisting time standing line front me  <EOR> Not many choices menu but because no burger Hawaii always come!
