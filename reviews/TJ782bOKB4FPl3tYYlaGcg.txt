  Wow! Vegas! mind races different fantasies place could name that!  1  Vegas all nude joint serves lap dances your Tom Yum 2  Infamous Thai strip joint where girls don't use mouths smoke cigarette  3  off Vegas Strip dance dinner review topless dancers 4  Trendy club where Panang Curry isn't hottest thing house    It only 1 mile away follow Gypsy GPS coordinates  Tipps Thai restaurant reads sign front normal Strip mall restaurant dark part neigborhood   What? Did many drunk truckers wanting more Thai food changed name? many geeks Consumer Electronics Shows wanting breasts Pad Thai?  Wait minute thought Tipps well integral part Titts isn't it? Every mammary its nipple isn't really mammalia!   Or did GPS just typo? peer into restaurant  pretty large 8 00pm nobody inside eating  car lot  looks restaurant sure but somehow Titts Tipps moniker hasn't help bring customers  pondering bit straining see some sign life drive off search alternative  am really hungry now getting tired grumpy    Marnee's Thai shows nearby  couple more cars lot few more customers inside  time am famished  There's karaoke stage lights right  seems place owned omnipresent Chinese Diaspora  know? Well owner looks Chinese somehow but sign outside said 'Marnee Thai Chinese Food   best clue    I order Tom Yum soup no Lap dance came but spicy! Then Panang Curry Rice  The only thing steaming curry rice! Sing Ha help cool off burning tongue    Food so so  soup ordered medium hot but hot hot red green chilies lot lemograss too  Panang just chicken no veggies  chicken all breast meat though    Really nice breasts  No tipps but tender little morsels mouth  <EOR> DUCK FRIED RICE!!! Finally! ultimate comfort food  crave many cocktails  Although fried rice buttery San Francisco duck pieces lean tasty  menu but when order bring without hesitation  Unlike Lotus Siam where there's big hassle then want charge $45 something custom    I would give place 5 stars except fact very happening  gone several times date night always only ones here  could plus if want intimate date but big minus if your first date  <EOR> ** Huge Thai Food Critic say doesn't more authentic place **  Food 5 5 delicious said doesn't more authentic place  Thai lot dishes Marnee Thai resembled moms home cooking  ordered pad woon sen pad see ew lad na  huge Thai critic because always comparing Thai restaurants own mother place takes cake  Every dish ordered wasn't your Americanize Thai favorites Pad Thai ordered Authentic stuff WOW amazed me    Service 5 5 service amazing women waitress she reminded lot own mother  Even though super loud Karaoke cheering she still really attentive  Kept asking if doing okay refilling drinks etc    Karaoke 3 5 Depending singing someone really bad singing someone really good singing  But there's live karaoke everyone listen while they're eating  cup tea handle loud restaurants but being forced listen someone absolutely should karaoke singing super annoying  But most time people usually cheering clapping dancing just having good time   Parking 4 5 place shares small parking lot couple other businesses which parking spaces limited usually if don't during peak dinner hours should able find parking  <EOR> Since moving Vegas thing heard 24 Hour least late night Thai places  Well walking all over First Friday Arts District then Fremont Street hungry late  there's nothing home really eat  do? Yelp app rescue! quick search running car El Cortez then heading off Spring Mountain Road finally going try late night Thai place    I ended picking Marnee Thai based reviews Ric H Nelson Arvin Misti Y   When those heavy hitters recommending place can't wrong lead late night Thai happy place  walked all things Thai Karaoke squealing microphone amplifier set 11  Once fixed mic volume didn't drop but singing actually pretty good  Including myself two other non Thai people but didn't feel uncomfortable fact service spot very good  Yep service smile wins over again     Ok enough lead dang review food? late area familiar why push comfort zone bit further? Panang Curry chicken course brown rice outside comfort zone haven't tried Thai curry yet  order anxiety level up  it? worried nothing  Oh man did place right order! While wish bit more chicken curry very flavorful loved it  LOVED IT    I gotta back try few more things but already know they're late night list places go  since some Chinese type dishes orange chicken bring others quite adventurous wanting push food experiences    4 Rock Solid Stars  Damn why did wait long try curries?

Oh last thing  asked spice   how hot want right  Only Penn's Thai House done usually places don't bring heat even when ask  <EOR> A restaurant karaoke good if annoying if don't  found annoying  came quick bite eat endure some girls being choked mic literally but  sounded like  volume speakers high being club   The food itself OK Thai food  Chinese part menu horrible  thing did place staff honest  friend kept dropping wallet because designer jeans staff actually picked gave back him  <EOR> This place pretty good mother took when Vegas big group friends  some good entree's  service couldn't really say much since early morning only table there  <EOR> if want variety   gotta come here  menu book  really pad thai its rubbery some places are  spicy chicken mushroom coconut milk soup best ever  only reason why gets 3 stars sometimes someone singing karaoke while eat its really loud annoying   im trying diss thai language anything  its just singer just mediocre its hard talk without yelling  <EOR> Haven't gone back long time but BF mood late night Thai work   Ordered thai ice tea good   Got fried catfish w thai basil ordered mild which definitely doesn't register mild but spicy  good though very flavorful fish wasn't muddy tasting  The BF wanted pad se ew mostly reason he wanted eat Thai  Theirs disappointing though  chicken dirty  poultry flavor   you know when taste chicken coop would smell like  Okay maybe eat just noodles then but dunno just weren't feeling it  wasn't balanced flavors very wet didn't eat much but didn't heart send back    I thought place just A OK place even when food good but bad chicken pad se ew just put damper keeping late night option  <EOR> Went Skinny Jeans stayed phatty phood  does mean? Well thought going see Thai boy band named Skinny Jeans performing   LV Weekly told kitchy evening! When arrived however appeared just karaoke  turned husband asked handle this? decided could   Little did know some average karoake  Everyone restaurant Thai all mesmerized female singer  told she famous singer Thailand vacationing Vegas  little dubious until saw someone hand appeared roll hundred dollar bills   famous money    They definitely Thai vibe under control  evening could Thailand  lots cheering dancing accompany singing    I always hesitant try Marnee because reviews average bad  However think may new chef town  When pay actually greeted new chef told she training  She Thai but traditionally worked Chinese kitchens    If she only training then am excited  panang curry pad kea mow  Both well executed least bit greasy filled quality fresh ingredients  pad kea mow probably best flavored noodle dish town intense aka delicious wok char topped pile fresh green cilantro  unfortunately ordered them tad spicy a 6 10 wasn't able enjoy them much potentially could have    Sadly no brown rice but service impeccable  friendly apologizing singing which unnecessary attentive  water glasses never less half full  wish bit more light but guess when you're hosting famous little privacy  <EOR> Ordered something midnight special menu   can't read Thai   Definitely interesting spot eat especially karaoke night   pretty loud prepared turn dial your hearing aid down few notches  <EOR> We came Monday evening ordered  1  Chicken pad thai 8 99 2  Chicken green curry 8 99 3  white rice  for $22 Chinese Thai restaurant  try it  Nice little stage performances  Friendly service  only patrons time  eating dinner time time would help serve us  While eating watching family slide shows TV  Food came less 10 mins  hungry great! Pad thai bit much flavoring almost much orange coloring  First time waitress ask 'how hot would it'  Medium pretty spicy  Rather chicken Beef shrimp cost more money  Green curry could use bit more coconut more chicken  Good amount bamboo  Spice rack old fresh  Peppers soft almost empty  rice free! Kinda slow picking check  price think pretty good  Usually when combination food end spending around $25 30  <EOR> Called take order Marnee several weeks ago tried standard Thai order Spicy Basil Chicken Lunch Special   First item note no brown rice   don't really dock restaurants but still worth mentioning   When arrived 10 15 minutes later walked into nearly empty restaurant    then nicely asked seat waited 4 5 minutes meal   doesn't really bother if walk into busy restaurant wait few extra minutes but didn't really understand where holdup could instance   When back office thought meal looked pretty standard which bad thing since favorite dishes   egg roll seemed soggier used probably because same takeout container rest food   also seemed little overcooked which combined sogginess did leave satisfied   chicken basil fine but unspectacular chicken itself described several times other reviews quite finely ground quite nicely sliced but instead seemed clumsily cut pieces chicken     I did notice lot positive reviews mentioned late night dining which could see being big bonus   Unfortunately scared dark tucked 10pm    If Thai place open near 2am I'd probably sleepwalk though     I think year two ago would probably still found 3 star meal because flavors weren't awful but amount Thai restaurants tried since then rank against others thereby only gets 2 me  <EOR> Little disapointed time food seem bit rushed less flavor service slow     My husband love Thai usually pretty good perhaps ordered    We started stuffed chicken wings inside pork fried served sweat chili sauce  good     Our yellow curry just okay potatoes bit small mushy didn't enjoy much phad prik khing pork good but just kinda blah flavors  Maybe taste buds blah today cont back but many Thai it'll while  <EOR> It probably 2 week incessant Christmas music playing casinos where husband work caused become disgusted whole notion Christmas   With being said hoped into car decided Christmas eve dinner China Town   mood Thai food stumbled across Marnee Thai   Upon entering felt if starring own Wild West movie because everyone literally stopped doing turn around look us     Acting natural ordered some appetizers off menu beef jerky little dry but few bites grew it   Thai carnitas!  Seafood Salad little spicy found imitation crab off putting   Finally Stuffed Chicken Wings okay but weird coating   Over all service food all kind Meh   entree skip apps   Oh don't sit under karaoke television monitor which when  wall over table   eating felt people watching kind because watching monitor which foot above head   still consider personal space  <EOR> I love papaya salad! service good here  server nice friendly  back sure reason gave 4 star because atmosphere sad  <EOR> This restaurant old school off strip  Las Vegas   The prices right money   offer quality lunch menu at below average prices   shrimp fried rice pretty tasty well garlic chicken Thai ice coffee  <EOR> The first time came Marnee Thai Restaurant 2 3 years ago bunch friends classmates all fellow culinary students   came tried lot different food enjoyed live band performance   remembered food good but never back   That changed last night when group decided drop late night dinner Yelp event Barrack Museum UNLV    favorite dish order Yum Woon Sen Yum Glass Noodle Salad which cellophane noodles mixed pork shrimp dressed spicy lime dressing   ordered just 3 spiciness scale already very hot!  unless enjoy really spicy food don't anything more 3 probably better 2 lower   Otherwise quite good   The food definitely authentic   may famous some other Thai restaurants Las Vegas but definitely good worth try   Decor Pretty simple decorations but stage live band karaoke   Food Pretty good Thai food   Service Very pleasant efficient   Parking Usually issue  <EOR> I'm going unbiased simple possible    Friday night dinner  9pm  Group 5  Spent almost 2 half hours entirely waiting food  suggestion friend because only Thai joint around extended hours until 3am believe   Decor tacky unnecessarily dimly lit noticed stage DJ booth microphone karaoke  4 other tables being served 2 waiters total    Wasn't pleasantly greeted waiter instead literally pointed table simply asked Drink?   Then took 15 minutes come back beverages another 5 take food orders  anxiously waiting ridiculous 45 minutes no food dishes finally started come out  shall say dish  Starving entire group scoffed down but left extremely agitated due its painfully stingy portions  exact thing happened every 10 minutes per dish coming often bland unexciting  also didn't help waiter never seemed care even deliberately showed signs impatient unstatisfied  single word apology update speed food  Even We're understaffed  New cook would helped but now refuse even give them benefit doubt  end long painful 2 hour sampling dining experience waiter simply dropped off check vanished  usually am very reserved understanding but never before such bad dining experience life  <EOR>
