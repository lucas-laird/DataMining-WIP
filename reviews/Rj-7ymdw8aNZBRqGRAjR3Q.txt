Spanish culture Mexican culture two different things  digressing actual experience let's that    So walk into packed restaurant Saturday night  Luckily no wait time two sat right away  took couple minutes greeted attractive waitress wearing black guayabera unbuttoned enough could see lacy black bra hey if then giiiiiirl   Service friendly but timing off   took longer should bring Prickly Pear Margarita Organic Margarita table  ordered chicken tacos since Matt already ate time frame 15 20 minutes table front ours sat ordered food received food 5 minutes into enjoying food before even plate tacos  ask where comida when food runner brought out  know busy work restaurants but shouldn't taken 20 minutes bring plate tacos table  chicken tender rice beans good  plate served DIY style everything laid some corn tortillas tin cup  No complaints but should around $11 $15  done saw runner carrying flan thought YUM decided split it  talked into ordering tres leches cheesecake instead which okay  COVERED cinnamon  could sifted onto dessert without using quarter jar cinnamon  Honestly tasted bread pudding  looked sort bread pudding  circular mushy cake emulsified syrup covered cinnamon  $9 discount because Matt grand total came $38  $47  price points such 14 oz Pickly Pear margarita $12 14 oz organic margarita $13 chicken tacos $15 tres leches $5    In conclusion service friendly ambiance nice albeit completely authentic but prices timing need work  If price points brought down 1 2 dollars would more accessible locals more par place which Americanized Mexican fusion restaurant strip  <EOR> Where start!!!!! seat ourselves bar area walking towards table guacamole station wide open mind place patio BUT only waitress' guacamole which watching unbeknownst waitress she wearing any gloves only she put fingers mouth take gum she chewing but decided just spit into hole cart guacamole on!!!! Needless say back plus chips salsa guacamole tastes better Chili's am guacamole fanatic!!! <EOR> I expected lot more  liked happy hour menu but only really good thing drinks  Mango Margarita die for! fan food  Steak tacos good  Loaded nachos mediocre  Took 20minutes anyone even give menu water  Literally every employee avoided eye contact  Server polite attentive noticing upset  <EOR> Ok 4 stars EXTREME PREJUDICE     Look huge fan Cafe Ba Ba Reeba or El Primero those listened 4th grade Spanish teachers    part time local would STRIP sit Ba Ba Reeba's patio not something locals tend  just liked much!

Yet somehow didn't everything ordered  Strike 2  Strike 3? Did see waitress roll eyes!? Quite frankly should eaten Chipotle inside Fashion Show Mall  food service guacamole much better  <EOR> Decided drop into establishment grab quick lunch rather opt Fashion Show Mall food court  $126 later party 5 left wondering WHY when didn't seem ordered much food   When checked receipt few hours later realized server only automatically charged mandatory 18% party 5 but she did TWICE  First much $ spent much more money meal 2 some fine restaurants around world BUT caught off guard party 5 mandatory service charge   honestly would tipped more but rebel doesn't told something   Larger parties totally understand  But 5?  consider tacky wouldn't surprised if results smaller tips servers overall   Food good  Above average mexican food elevated version El Torito    I give credit manager fixed issue double service charge once called inquire basically implying could under influence  Now ounce alcohol all week work lunch probably would laugh but presumptuous remark somewhat insulting  She fixed nonetheless thank you   only called because bored waiting delayed flight airport   If busy usual would let took loss place could carry shady business   Beware don't think am only person happened to  waitress didn't even bat eye   fact charges labeled two separate types services would confusing misleading anyone  BAD BUSINESS    Eat if you're Fashion Show Mall   Eat if craving Mexican food but something better Chipotle inside mall  Eat if you're okay paying $19 99 chicken tacos  Note chicken tortilla soup AWESOME! Eat if want forced into 36% your total check   Two stars soup  Another star added effort general manager partner put into fixing issue  return sure hope provide 4 5 star rating place some real potential  <EOR> A great place eat in  two friends visited place couple times  Guacamole best ever little spicier side though  Everything menu great  must try everyone  <EOR> This place gem big group dinner!

<EOR> Decent restaurant right outside Fashion Mall where eat while getting fresh air  order chicken tacos wife chicken tinger  tacos good give really small corn tortillas where build taco yourself between rice black beans cilantro sour cream salsa pico de gallo  chips salsa really good Segundo supplies 3 different sauces if some heat ask Diablo salsa  <EOR> I really wanted Mexican food day flew Vegas  It' just those things crave it  found place okay reviews decided try it   The restaurant good ambiance  thought going seated outside but sat inside which wasn't bad  huge projection screen where playing some channel cannot remember  also next bar which looked great selection Tequila    I really wanted chicken flautas which didn't settled crunchy chicken tacos  server told sangrias really good decided try those too   The sangria actually pretty good served bits green apple  drink started night    The crunchy chicken taco plate came three tacos black beans white lime rice cilantro charred tomatillo salsa guacamole sour cream  Put all together made yummy meal  feel chicken could more flavor also menu stated made own shells but looked more Taco Bell variety which wasn't expecting    A downer restaurant no free chips salsa food bit pricey food  ordered sangria chicken taco plate ceviche appetizer  tab $40! much bang buck here  Many say  Vegas but different dining experience totaling same dollar amount next evenings say beg differ  <EOR> Food ok  Just nachos but service subpar best   Took 30 minutes appetizer nachos  Ran water did server notice until food served   impressed  Ok am updating previous review  posted message owner  He very nice wanted try restaurant again much sent gift card  great customer service definitely going back  <EOR> Very delicious Mexican food  guacamole very good recommend it  location very nice where look onto strip people watch while eat  Even 105° weather place kept comfortable   surely again if looking Mexican area  <EOR> We always eat while LV   tradition eat chips salsa while drinking beer two  beer selection rather limited most places strip they're margaritas great just much tequila person  feel better service bar  past visit kids say normal tables service terribly slow but maybe  just because children   Then ran beer ordered apparently confused waiter price when he offered another selection he told multiple times when asked bill   why took off star way which spoken then another star speed service MIA waiter  feel neglected because order small children  <EOR> Americanized Mexican food being said some food items really great some much  guacamole delicious point  $22 fajitas much meat little burnt side probably worst fajitas ever had  chicken enchiladas very tasty  Elote terrible  rice amazing  Hit miss  would come back rice  <EOR> Great outdoor seating fun environment  food fresh quick affordable  Service excellent  shared chicken tacos nachos  Portions nice size! <EOR> I've going El Segundo while now but haven't gotten around reviewing it  more favorite happy hours go  Even though strip much pain because elevator takes directly it  What's awesome happy hour tacos taquitos  What's great modelo part happy hour which happens favorite beer mine  If beer isn't your thing margaritas petty good too  Besides happy hour food pretty good too  If sitting bar there's nice place sit people watch everyone strip  If you're just visiting local recommend coming least once  <EOR> Went twice good mediocre experience  food good but service great   Example brought three entrees 2 accidental double order   Drink refills did exist server didn't come around 30 mins  check wrong Included double order took 15 mins fix  shorted $10 change conveniently did include receipt  10 mins fix  least restaurant good food margaritas would 1 star horrible service  seafood platter really good   sure count your change though  <EOR> It solid but just ok  salsa guacamole grilled pineapple margarita highlight meal  food good but little over priced but strip it  Service good little slow but busy  If strip would but o would venture when many other local Mexican food places just good if better cheaper  If sure send text group free chips salsa <EOR> Stopped over weekend buddy just moved Las Vegas  ordered tacos he ordered specialty burger menu  Please note different normal Strip Burger menu  ask small page specialty burger menu otherwise you'll normal menu  any case taco's again delicious expected  Unfortunately friends burger cooked liking  server didn't check back right away therefore he lost appetite  When he complained burger server profusely apologized promptly removed charge bill  She also said she didn't realize computer system didn't allow input burger temperature she more aware let kitchen know future if special burgers ordered  Nonetheless still good time  friend way met someone bar number   Fun times always El Segundo Sol! <EOR> **BEST MEXICAN HAPPY HOUR STRIP**  Fat Tuesdays move over    We're talking QUALITY over QUANTITY here   Fortunately able venture into lively fun place some delicious margaritas tried Big Stick Mango half price   Their HH menu included tasty pork burritos $4 95 $0 95 extra works totally worth every penny!  The Espolon promotion girls came over gave free tequila shots  Wow did over   HIGHLY RECOMMEND happiest hour your pre party adventure Vegas  <EOR> Food good margaritas not  nice alternative hotel dining Wynn since weren't able reservation  Check happy hour! <EOR> Seemed little expensive but  expected Vegas   Really large selection tequila if you're into kinda thing   I'm but fan cucumber mint margaritas    Quesadilla appetizer good but small  Steak fajitas really good  Totally fan rice give it  think did more picking stuff actual fajita assembling    You pay chips which kind annoying since almost every other Mexican place ever gives them free  Probably worth big group though since they're bottomless  <EOR> The place nice food great! But expect nothing less if platter beef fajitas costs $22 + tax + another 18% 22% gratuity  would given place 4 stars but steak fajitas platter really small  tasted great but fun doesn't last very long  service personnel very nice  place pretty noisy loud but  Vegas don't  <EOR> The good things place location fact food decent  restaurant located Fashion Mall right happening part Las Vegas Strip across Wynn  enchiladas also pretty good   The only bad things place pricey opinion don't really enough you're paying  understand fact strip would more expensive but could least provide some free chips salsa  Most other Mexican restaurants do! <EOR> This place great! spending week Utah 4 hours Vegas kill around sunset before flight home   Obviously Yelp found place!  weren't dressed anything fancy hiking    yikes! yet felt comfortable sitting outside here   actually surrounded few parties business casual I think large Rehearsal dinner maybe? but waitstaff friendly didn't seem mind!  The food amazing   drinks even better!  started off guacamole omg many avocados!! endless chips salsa   ask refill salsa but server super helpful prompt it   continued drink then decided share steak tacos which able order preference medium record delish! came tons veggies side rice salsa guac beans tortillas   More enough food honestly!  For drinks he ordered Sol Marg on rocks opted Frozen Prickly Pear Marg which just right amount sweet without being overwhelming!  good!  great location people watch if table outside   didn't check happy hour because sat table but specials looked good enough!  Overall cute place great mexican food even better margaritas chill vibe   could see doing big dinner birthday just girls sounds fun! <EOR> It Strip expect pay more    However expect better service where restaurant fell short  waited long time drinks food busy  endless chips ended because second round never arrived  waiter pleasant however felt forgotten   The margaritas pricy if returned would only if happy hour  tried some different margaritas loved them all  small very small price deal  large very large!  Because saved draft finish review cannot remember ordered food wise but all good  Overall if Fashion Show Mall would probably return but special trip  <EOR> Tasted great!  Guacamole Excellent Chile Relleno Fantastic Tres Leches Cake Amazing <EOR> I've dined twice which more enough times rate experience two stars   Appetizer Bottomless tortilla chips dips could've just eaten alone called day  chips served hot baking pan along pico de gallo tomato roasted tomatillo salsas    Entree Baja Fish Tacos If wanted construct own fish tacos would've just made them home  Instead given plate ingredients including side tiny tortillas which smaller palm hand  fish nuggets lightly battered fried  they're golden delicious  coleslaw rice beans good    Service Granted restaurant busy but service could've better  ordered guacamole twice never received it    Other Dining patio uncomfortable though offers partial view Wynn Strip traffic  Keep look birds   Overall No bueno  <EOR> Took long enough but now favorite upscale Mexican restaurant Vegas  last closed worried wouldn't find worthy replacement    El Segundo Sol laid back vibe fantastic food  friend spent much time Mexico raved atmosphere food  Carne Asada cooked order simply zsome e most tasty tender had  second visit sampled Baja fish tacos best had  fish melted mouth!
