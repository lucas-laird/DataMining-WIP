Sure  drive isn't far know sellers frequently come change product  <EOR> Everything expensive!! Even old t shirts priced if new  My husband looked 2 traffic lights which he saw 2 years ago   Some vendors advertised 20% discounts but upon closer inspection prices appeared boosted prior called discount  On top if all employees patrol place if sure no takes item  When find something am capable paying hundreds even thousands  So patrolling high prices turn off me  I lose interest shop exhibits hypervigilance high prices such  present place  buy antique shows  don't even live Las Vegas  doubt am only person noticing bad customer service prices here  News flash! only antique store Las Vegas!!

Making customers experience great assisting anyway  your employees Antique mall America your antique selection good but your customer service terrible  <EOR> The fifth star missing due fact downsized mall substantially   remember needing hours through home all things vintage tacky just plain interesting but alas cut space half guessing due  pesky economy  There's just something musty smell old  not people old  entirely different odor nearly pleasant  talking moth balls am speaking scent memories quirky gadgets sturdy pieces furniture miscellaneous decor possess  history behind each piece collected Antique Mall and any antique shop quite honest intrigues me    From vintage glassware collectible memorabilia quiet fancy old box Polaroid camera's myself shocker sure     Visiting home all things antique brings back memories thing happens older  I think call nostalgia?  Memories shmemories though admit find little disturbing things childhood I'm product 80's surfacing ANTIQUE store now haha   If want trip down memory lane couple laughs if you're looking completely unique gift quirky certain someone definitely Antique Mall America stop your list! <EOR> My son twice  first time 45 minutes before closing  employees started letting know when closing 30 minutes before closed  very annoying pushy point rude    We back give them second chance 4 months later  able see second half store  even saw several vendors booth  vendors very friendly helpful  talking having fun when employees front desk came said Hello know time is?
