While large party came in  Party 9   unfortunately sat right next them  reason unfortunate because actually witness good service actually looks while being basically ignored ourselves  thing bad service  point just chalk servers being incapable don't back  quite another witness same exact servers giving amazing service another group while basically shunning you   I'm even exaggerating  empty drink almost ten minutes  Meanwhile server sitting table large party having casual conversation  attention just start drinking non existent drink which sound anyone food industry should understand  server actually looks smiles continued conversation  He wasn't taking order nor he helping them any way  He just talking   A few minutes later girl helping server offered another drink  server only made appearance twice  actually bring food drop ticket  When he actually dropped ticket he told take cashier when ready pointed front desk  right away we're told server handles that    The manager said he'd take care said total $50 more ticket actually was! correct he walked away saying something tips   pretty audacious talk tips experience just had   Finally some other server brought receipt back left lowest tip left years   Overall food decent but service abysmal  If want mediocre food horrible service give place shot  <EOR> One word place     blech   I'm proud admit few times for some reason husband used here    every time disappointing best   service particular location just AWFUL   awful fact whole meal three comped once food took over 45 minutes arrive ordering   Then there's issue really greasy low quality food always leaves tummy ache   YUCK   honestly can't think anything good say OTB   Sorry  <EOR> Arrived just before 5pm  many patrons time placed order waited waited meals  20 mins  told order coming soon another 5 mins  later  finally came  dish cold needed sent back while worst steak fajitas  beef? softest texture sat water 3 days definitely enjoyable meal   eat meal while wife waited re heated   All say Adios Border we're NEVER coming back !!!!! <EOR> My husband going almost two years once week once every other week happy hour   Why?

Guess he really didn't care    The manager came because groupon when he asked told wouldn't back   told wrong he apologized gave additional $10 off    So give 2 stars since manager rice salsa all good  The rest wasn't  <EOR> I installed yelp app just leave review  When gazed menu felt excitement enchiladas suizas ordered! disappointment anticipated! enchiladas doused such abundance cheese begged question if I'd some enchilada cheese ordered! food flavorless price should received much more! give place star! <EOR> I love place  bunch times service always good  Most staff know name eat  don't even give menu anymore when come in    They gone above beyond when come birthdays fundraisers things that  Kelly Katy Melissa Christian all rest great    They best queso dip cilantro lime rice along wide diverse menu  continue back more  <EOR> We walked where bar hostess tells cant bar because only server said only server whole wait? She didn't answer just stood waited waited still waiting!!!! just left  Never coming back! <EOR> My friend stopped before running some errands some lunch  restaurant itself pretty slow seated right away hostess really nice  eaten before remember being pretty alright prices        friend ordered stacked nachos lunch $11 99 ordered carnitas chimichanga red sauce $10 99   finished bowl tortilla chips came complimentary salsa asked another which no problem except salt BOMB  inedible       chimichanga pretty good although very small served huge chunk raw jalapeno top  price definitely didn't bang buck  then couple bites friend's nachos again HUGE assault senses all salt  thought maybe chips again but eating just meat itself figured time meat crazy over seasoned  unpleasant she didn't even finish them  server she started pretty nice but sitting while attitude seemed change more nuisance  Plus when finally bill top overly priced food size surprised see charged $1 49 tiny side sour cream! You've kidding me! won't returning  <EOR> I've wanting Border restaurant last year half  know sounds crazy but still quest find great taco Tuesday Vegas  subscribing OTB's email newsletters months now finally made taco Tuesday week 9 30 2014  When arrived cantina area all tables empty completely filled sticky gross  set least debris friend some disinfecting  cleaning spray off server's station because no came check us   I dismayed when ordered margarita found pre made giant slushy machine 7 eleven  overly sweet came mug instead margarita glass  server obviously over worked told order jumbo margarita order margarita glass  Um ok but serves margarita any size beer mug only 5 ice cubes?   So ordered another margarita floater Cazadores tequila but never actually see floater  Apparently all you  No thank you!   So margaritas suck  food The chips salsa nice fresh tasting  order guacamole which came plate formed two ice cream scoops  0 stars presentation even trying look made fresh sometime last day two  wasn't pretty  Yes contains more onions normal guacamole but love onions flavor actually decent  Next ordered empanadas chicken  wasn't much chicken very very Fri fried but whatever   all say those  On tacos  ordered grilled fish tacos which sounded delicious  came lavish presentation lots cheese lettuce cabbage like  Unfortunately fish salty soon took bite heart started hurting sodium intake  corn tortillas greasy  asked server when could finally find again if she could them remake tacos less sodium   Finally server brought some more tacos made without salt but still great flavor  guess grill already salty enough all other overly salted tacos   If service would better then would able overlook  discrepancies food  Unfortunately  All servers busy very inattentive  server especially acted if burden every time asked something Thank goodness caring busser finally brought water napkins server forgot   At end meal instead thanking server told order fish tacos without salt next time save hassle  avoid your section next time instead?   I'm disappointed!  year half anticipation get  might back give them more try only because really love tacos Tuesdays  <EOR> Good decor free chips good salsa  Unfortunately food bit mediocre  flavors some dishes portions pretty small  Good customer service but could also because many customers walking door  ordered fish taco which pretty good  boyfriend ordered taco salad which big fried tortilla very little salad would recommend it! <EOR> Went late lunch  quickly seated  Location easily accessible  Menu allot different options  waitress great customer service kept drinks coming  took bit food arrive but deff favorable  <EOR> On Border   seriously sucks when comes service  bad  Very bad  bad pack Hollywood script writers couldn't dream some mistakes seen made here  But slap bowl salsa hot chips front almost forget waitress gone 12 minutes hasn't taken order yet  Set big lunch plate dinner plate down mix tamales enchiladas chile rellenos gone before know it    I hate service but when Ann 95 hungry car keeps finding way here  hunch again again again    3 stars   gotta drop star patient when comes slow service another star gets dropped because dang wanted cheese enchiladas cheese doesn't sound same chicken  Yet sure seem lot chicken when here  Oh email sign deal doesn't free sopapilla until your next visit send lot email  <EOR> One few places Vegas enjoy Tex Mex  Having grown Fort Worth prefer Tex Mex Cali Mex OTB great menu reminds home  especially enjoy empanadas salsa flautas but just everything menu great  <EOR> No wait food awesome  Brisket Tacos fabulous! Tina attentive soft eyes  struck park tonight  <EOR> I've three separate occasions   first time visited place absolutely marginal   eating thinking myself Yes eating burrito   but don't know why doesn't taste good say Taco Bell  second third visits place work related wasn't driving deciding lunch didn't much choice   kept thinking same thing thought first visit Why isn't good Taco Bell?    If give place star means pretty much dragged unconscious establishment order step back inside   Yes think Taco Bell better place especially when comes price but going throw fit if somebody else footing bill  <EOR> I'd say experience average  good things guacamole  very good margarita requested Hornitos very good and strong   pre made Patron margarita also good I'd definitely chicken flautas again  bad avocado fries sounded good theory but cardboard type taste  Also strawberry margarita happy hour $3 very weak strawberry slush  <EOR> Good service amazing food  reviews pleasantly surprised Definitely would come again  <EOR> Mexican restaurant chains   what say   Some better others if compare OTB family owned Mexican restaurants then aren't being fair    OTB really good is   salsa chips unique tasty  Guacamole Live favorite   serve Dos Equis tap Negro Modelo bottle which used tap but no more shame   Taco Tuesday day go   Cheap good   work dinner won't break bank   almost always sit cantina Kelly best   Great friendly service smile   Thanks Kelly!   It busy longer usual wait times expected but gives more time drink beer scarf down chips  Overall OTB restaurant especially specials   some other reviews seems can't please everyone but must doing something right because seem always busy  <EOR> Always search great Mexican Restaurant Vegas ain't it! wish someone would open Tex Mex restaurant town  Wishful thinking suppose  Beyond disappointed livid describes better  4 people cost $90!
