Embers classy restaurant great service great food  Perfect date night night friends  Check out! <EOR> We decided try Embers when came across Groupon deal shortly moving Las Vegas  brunch sat outside patio  very nice atmosphere although took little longer anticipated food husband both enjoyed breakfast choices  prices little expensive amount food but quality very good  recommend snagging Groupon if want try save yourself couple bucks  <EOR> Short point    If want great meal definitely worth visit  eaten dozen times never disappointed  food quality excellent plating very good service warm friendly  sure why other reviewers would blame restaurant guests attire tenant mix shopping center? Kind unfair  am restauranteur San Francisco find Embers best options dining area highly recommend it  <EOR> I heard opening establishment while dining other local favorites finally chance check out   glad did!  To begin surprised see empty Saturday night   mean Boca Park peak dinnertime!  party three made reservation only walk into very subdued environment   soon realize word simply hasn't gotten yet amazing food served Embers   We started calamari   Perfectly done great dipping sauce  nice spicy way but spicy party   Good more me!    During appetizers perused cocktail menu decided order something looked unique   While honestly don't recall ordered remember absolutely delicious     Next soups salads wedge salads them French onion soup me   clearly happy salads amazed soup   soups where just small onion piece doused tons broth lumpy cheese   almost chili!!  Lots good stuff here   could easily called night hearty soup but ordered macadamia crusted mahi mahi which DElicious!  took two bites boxed rest home   friends ordered some steaks which also gave thumbs up  Of course took bite also impressed  The only downside Embers service   very laid back person but did notice neither hostess nor server seemed want there   Maybe just new ??  but even when maintaining utmost professionalism nothing's wrong warm smile   All all nice time look forward trying some more unique menu items guacamole brie melt sun dried mozzarella   Yummo! <EOR> Nice ample space friendly upscale neighborhood bar vibe  Killer menu too! black blue burger melt your mouth awesomeness  Server friendly gave plenty time look over menu did rush us  definitely return regulars  <EOR> Beautiful restaurant  Looks though someone picked decorations catalog but great clean setting nonetheless   The service great  Wasn't very busy Sunday brunch but just meant more attention could paid patrons    Ordered stuff dates appetizer  If presentation everything clearly missed mark  looked giant blob but taste great bacon crispy which nice   entrée ordered fried chicken biscuits  I'd highly recommend although potatoes greasy    My friend ordered blueberry lemon pancakes  greatful he doesn't eat much  almost ate all pancakes  <EOR> Really nice decor outdoor patio Embers comfortable good place drink hang  Speaking drinks hard time picking cocktail menu extensive quite interesting  Ended Georgia Peach Julep Burbon mint peaches honey quite good sweet  issue menu selections   choices seemed slim without focus    didn't know specialty opted Seared Ahi Salad which tasty  Nothing menu said try except specialty drinks! <EOR> Waited hour orders but glad Marcus owner Ted Mamola came over made due busy 20 person party ahead us  comped bottle wine desserts great customer sevice!!  The review food itself very good  Tri tip entree flat iron steak awesome!  Would come back but when huge party ahead!! <EOR> Excellent food extremely friendly staff  only bad review place some douche named Erik pissed he didn't another guest wearing fortunately she isn't menu don't let influence your decision  tri tip menu though should probably become curious putting your mouth because awesome  <EOR> I tried Embers Happy Hour two friends     I'd back but experience night average reason No spicy mustard   any place burgers and Embers many menu only yellow mustard?  scandalized disappointed     No dijon? No deli mustard? even honey mustard?  did love server enjoyed sides  burger good reasonably priced  tablemates loved wine meals   But mustard thing downer me     hear great weeknight happy hour dinner great  back but I'd bring own mustard  <EOR> I sliders again tonight something forgot add last review size wise very small  Plus only two come with Chips instead fries  Overall they're good bar snack but meal  fiancé cajun chicken sandwich much larger size wise also comes fries  She said good   Service time terrible  seated quickly but server decided focusing older clients would better use time  ask things multiple times time finally weren't needed  example ordered waters drinks she didn't actually bring them until asked again  Also asked side sauce once food arrived finished eating time there   One other note bartender didn't finances drink felt need sample it  She didn't drink glass but used straw finger over end try it  She did close enough plain site hear say wow  good  <EOR> I never understand why mediocre chain restaurants packed when share proximity quality restaurants Embers  visited Embers twice  first dinner behest friend lives locally  friend's request wasn't just food which excellent but because drink selection  easy greater Las Veegas area find place does cocktails hard find place does them right  gauge expertise? Lion's Tail Blood Sand  fact Embers sets them apart  Now add versatile menu courteous staff bacon wrapped dates Embers becomes favorite restaurants Summerlin  <EOR> Previous reviews mixed actually nervous trying Embers   ate early Saturday evening restaurant quiet even though bar area lively   received friendly greetings upon entering fabulous server Chrissy continued tone throughout meal   The drinks good wine pours generous   split Caesar start which good   steaks tasty cooked precisely ordered   filet completely tender   called fries steak fries but shoestrings just bit sparse   baked potato huge   Broccoli great asparagus skinny variety but good   fact entrees include 2 sides Embers slightly better cost wise other good steakhouses area   I look forward returning soon highly recommend Embers! <EOR> Very delicious  great customer service staff very attentive  great brunch dinner selection!

would think price could whole roll maybe eight pieces instead four    For salad ordered Caesar dressing side  Price $10  price thinking maybe did something different expensive  Maybe guy dressed Julius Caesar come entourage present magnificent salad  But no  just your basic romaine lettuce parmesan cheese croutons  side note cheapest salad spring mix which $8   Lastly main course Slow Roasted Tri Tip  Price $20  Now actually decent  still don't think 20 tri tip justifies though  Came mashed yams spinach    Overall food quality below average especially price  total came 54 dollars some change   20 percent tip included  lot other places where soup salad main course under 20 dollars  Don't wrong  am cheapskate but damned if pay much meal  cant really rave about    In closing atmosphere service pretty good but food worth ridiculous prices charge you  Originally gonna give two stars but since good company probably distracted disappointment long enough give guys extra star   Speaking good company shout outs good friends Kevin L Ollan wifey Kristina C D gf Evelyn Y including C D jr  Last but least person responsible night fun most loveable huggable person ever meet Stephanie Fluffy Bear K!
