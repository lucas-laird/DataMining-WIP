First off burgers come fake cheese must sauce comes can   tasted slimy over salted artificially flavored thick oil  meat gray flavorless tasted more tofu   bacon fake   didn't taste bacon more smoked cardboard   bread super soggy bland   took two bites threw away   tried bite steak burger even worse tasted salty old used grease diner   5 hours still feel nauseated   WORST burger ever!  Rumrunner Whitecastle In n Out but place! <EOR> My greasy guilty pleasure   I really look drive thru  There's 2 lanes but rarely ever see other opened  sit outside enjoy your meal if weather permits   My favorite order double bacon cheeseburger  MUST ORDER SEASONED FRIES  amazing! fully loaded fries equally enjoyable well    I'm only rating place 3 due most recent visit  ranch extremely oily = couldn't enjoy meal usually because this   Overall isn't bad place grab lunch dinner at  <EOR> Checkers gets 3 STRONG stars!
