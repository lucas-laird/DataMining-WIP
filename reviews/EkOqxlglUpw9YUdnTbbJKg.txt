First time true Las Vegas deep dish pizza say really liked ordered! met classmate ordered small Meat deep dish pizza  Tip small pizza between two people still leave 2 pieces left over  very filling! wait time table 30 45 minutes but pre order your pizza  sat bar ordered some drinks  actually 45 minutes table Wednesday night but pizza came quickly seated  Pizza really good but crust alone needed bit salt spice kinda bland itself  But sauce toppings cheese crust married together well worth wait  Enjoy! <EOR> This place pretty unique pizza fried chicken sub sandwich hot wings french fries more  work near Flamingo location lunch dinner few times    I want first point subs  enought italian sub fries  toasted perfection price great  under 6 bucks good meal taste $20 plate! meat bread fresh flavor portion worth eating again!   The service fair fast easy  lot pizza shops around town should try out    As said above lunch dinner there  ordered family meal pack bunch fryed chicken bread sticks fries wings pizza  All all price cant it  paid under $35 bucks more enough family 5  even left overs!!!  I say fryed chicken little dry but wings pizza frys great! <EOR> we kept getting flyer's door loved prices food amazing even next morning good ordering alot <EOR> Contrary banner top page business moved  still serves same horrid disgusting pizza other food made clean your digestive tract send pharmacy    I ordered large pizza them  ate part slice then part second slice then threw all garbage    What more say them? Save your money pizza elsewhere  <EOR> I making lasagna night realized didn't any bread salad side dishes  Since only live minutes Happy's Pizza decided order Greek Salad Cheesy Bread  did order delivery since middle making dinner  Mind could drive 2 minutes 1 hour later Greek Salad Cheesy Bread arrived  Thank God lasagna takes forever cook!  The cheesy bread very large price around $6 00 believe  However dry marinara sauce very bland  ranch paid  75 cents for broke spilled everywhere  Cheesy Bread really cheesy taste kind weird   The Greek Salad around $7 00 disgusting! dressing used really gross salad didn't even feta cheese it      Overall total $21 00 tip salad cheesy bread didn't even eat half it!   Pretty disappointed quality taste food  most likely going back  <EOR> This place ok   not favorite   everything pizza bbq ribs fried chicken fried fish   nothingvto write home about <EOR> I love place would wrote review maybe month two but never around it   Anyway service excellent pizza okay would say its average maybe close little caesars pizza quality   But really just come wings good cooked perfection fries every time them fresh crispy customer service top notch many other take places where really bad average best really place would recommend anybody  <EOR> It's really fair critique seafood Las Vegas being Louisiana  But  eat expect done right  sum things Happy's serves cheap frozen seafood  intend coming back try pizza  staff says great  What's good place friendly staff prompt service large menu  place might great  just know popcorn shrimp tilapia not  could've gotten same result walmart's frozen section  <EOR> Menu looks great food made VERY UNHAPPY  had no flavor tasted microwaved  Stay away <EOR> Yum!
