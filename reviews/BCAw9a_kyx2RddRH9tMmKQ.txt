Located Hard Rock Hotel hidden gem known Mr  Lucky's Everytime Vegas there's three things ALWAYS do  Number 1 put $20 black red start off weekend  Number 2 Fat Tuesday sip while walk strip  Finally number 3   at some point during drunken debauchery always 777 deal place  best deal EVER anywhere  just vegas but ANYWHERE!  For $7 77 perfectly cooked steak three pieces grilled shrimp salad your choice mashed baked potatoes french fries  listed menu therefore when walk all say 777? your in    This place also featured Food Network's Best Thing Ever Ate bang your buck special  When saw dish itself TV nothing but flashbacks good food drunken munchies Mr  Lucky's  <EOR> *cue old man voice* Back day late '90s place used something something good  Value quality certainly dropped since began going Mr Lucky's '96 when steak shrimp special $5 95 weren't required purchase beverage included salad  lemonade back those days used fresh squeezed lemons powdered concentrated crap use now   These days still find off menu steak shrimp special show your players card deal but $7 77 minus salad really? much money did save taking off salad?! required purchase drink $3 soda tea lemonade reality your special special $10 77  steak believe also shrunk size since special began  two things remain awesome grilled shrimp garlic mashed potatoes    Service even sitting counter spotty best    If happened look menu other food includes overpriced breakfasts other items    I guess if starving 3 4 am drunk don't want stumble anywhere else outside casino fit bill but won't rushing back anytime soon  Instead head over Eillis Island steak potato beer special which includes salad! <EOR> Sean K server he amazing! Personable witty hilarious  could definitely come back just see him  food would recommend French toast  cornflake crust delicious <EOR> I certainly lucky stumble upon place during late night hunger craving fest some best hashbrowns long time  breakfast phenomenal totally hit spot perfectly  sure wasn't consumed hunger fooling myself into thinking some best food ever came back during lunchtime later tried some lunch specials which again impressed caliber quality food prepared  service equally attentive late night hours during day  decor fun trendy hip eatery  Prices won't high all Vegas diners eateries 24 7 joint inexpensive fun! <EOR> I ate client today   wanted casual quick meal   fancy burger   I asked no bun lettuce wrap instead change cheese goat cheese   When waiter gave meal bun he immediately took back brought back lettuce wrap  Then taking first bite noticed forgot cheese   and burger AWFUL! tasted burnt meat   I didn't want complain again front client just few bites   waste   never again  <EOR> As far $7 77 steak shrimp dinner goes    recommend getting medium well done  crap ordering well done steaks but chef's Mr  Lucky's know keep moist yummy   While enjoying cooked steak everyone else chewing some bloody meat  hahah Also recommend mashed potatoes!  Other just said place pretty standard   Cheap prices good food good service! money saved spend rest booze! <EOR> So really isn't anything special place other ridiciously good mashed potatoes  mean really its put whole stick butter each serving nom nom  am thinking coming days ordering 3 large sides eating all shamelessly some corner booth   These Cadillac potatoes served $7 77 steak dinner deal which think only reason anyone would come otherwise average casino cafe  players card ask server deal its served 24 7 but isn't listed menu  comes 3 grilled shrimp decent cut steak salad course    mashed potatoes Jesus must made  $7 77 sort poorly kept secret but something alot tourist probably don't know about  fact its probably only reason would even come here   Other everything else menu pretty average very overpriced  $17 regular cheeseburger? pfff Burger Bar  also pretty good happy hour starts midnight  should anyone's Vegas cheap eats list  <EOR> Good diner type restaurant lobby Hard Rock Hotel  open 24 hours which great   The food good diner type meals offered  breakfast options well  portions gigantic too   A bit overpriced but somewhat expected  <EOR> I some friends 4 odd something o'clock morning ordered Lucky 7   because remember bits pieces focus parts actually remember   The service pretty good lots people but seated right away  all pretty much knew wanted crackin' right away  Probably best salads ranch ever life   I'm sure possible but hey telling awesome salad  Everything else tasted really good only thing asked medium rare steak bit much rare side  But any rate still left full happy!

When ordered pancakes mentioned BLUEBERRIES  soon Clay heard order he immediately said 'Got it!!' walked off   Our food came fairly quick which nice  First HRH Breakfast plate received wheat bread barely brown hash browns 2 yolks w 1 popped sausage bacon  Clay asked wanted breakfast might received sourdough toast well done hash browns   Secondly Sweet Cream Pancakes w Blueberries received plain pancakes 3 pieces single 1 strawberry  When reiterated ordered rebuttal received  ticket said   Server Clay comes back send back   Throughout meal checked twice    TWICE  Clay would repeatedly walk right past table speak single 1 gentleman sitting table right next us  became very bothersome server walk past table zero regard  don't want call discriminatory but very much felt way   This first time coming eating Hard Rock unfortunately also last  <EOR> A standby almost seems nostalgic holdover bygone time now live time when venerable casino coffee shops being replaced Denny's TGI Friday's  old school without being stale  meals tend bar food breakfast food both done well  Chicken tenders club sandwiches potato skins always go to dishes they've never done wrong  <EOR> I've few times over years order $7 77 gambler's special which consists salad steak mashed potatoes shrimp   used good value decent meal   However yesterday asked gambler's special informed waiter deal changed   Now need player's card one per table Hard Rock $7 77 deal must purchase beverage which brings price over $10 very minimum   If don't player's card don't want signing free gambler's special $10 plus purchase beverage which bring your total over $13 very minimum   told waiter policy changed just short time ago    One last thing I'd comment quality gambler's special itself   seems quality meal gone down over time   just good used be   hope review helps  <EOR> Just New York Half Half sandwich comes full pastrami roast beef rye   Good sandwich overall fries   Heard good steak too   I stop again when staying visiting Hard Rock Casino  <EOR> Tried $7 77 steak eggs delicioussssssss!!

No need attitude! suggested contact front desk let them know rules aren't misinforming hotel guests yet another smug look    Yet she continued attitude trying shoo away when another waitress came offered order go  nasty waitress 'tude pretty snappy when asked cheese fries shredded cheese instead nacho cheese always serve shredded cheese quickly served back well  served last night!
