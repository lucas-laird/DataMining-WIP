Can't wait try Dim Sum  <EOR> I quite few times since opened  past few times thought must've gotten them good day but now realizing quality gone down all other reviews reading  very disappointing  looking forward decent American Chinese restaurant neighborhood   food when first opened top notch   Well seasoned well prepared but now past few times gotten them food still hot but no seasoning noodles meat overcooked   hope fix whatever changed back when first opened  <EOR> Been twice now  First dined in  Second because cheap pay tip   We Family Dinner first time which pork fried rice crab rangoon egg roll soup egg drop two entrees Mu Shu Beef Honey Walnut Shrimp   Walnut Shrimp just okay wouldn't order again  Mu Shu Beef good  egg roll chewy  Crab Rangoon good  Egg Drop Soup good  also Sausage Fried Rice go  boyfriend liked sausage fried rice    Today following take out Fish Fillet Black Bean Sauce Mongolian Beef two Sausage Fried Rice  liked both fish fillet mongolian beef  Although black bean sauce bit salty getting fish veggies without sauce anyway   Service good  place always empty except family saw dined today lady grabbed to go menu when first there   Tip would grab menu could just call your order ahead time take out  But wait wasn't long  done 10 minutes said wait would be   I would again if want some cheap Chinese food wouldn't want drive all way Chinatown  <EOR> 7 30 saw new place received few good reviews decided give try  service excellent  5 stars! refills kept coming food prepared brought timely manner  place clean ambiance standard yet relaxing  staff very well run efficient  waiter Titus very friendly  He even asked food basically asking if could give any constructive criticism  also introduced ourselves chatted bit  new places should treat customers!   Me friend ordered Family Meal 2 $21 75 which included choice Hot Sour Soup Egg Drop Soup Crab Rangoon Egg Roll Pork Fried Rice very generous portion  could $10 entree other places 2 entrees your choice  ordered Mongolian Beef Chicken Vegetables  Beverages relatively cheap well $1 50    I'd give food 3 5 4 stars  food fresh presentation vivid  could delicious depending your taste  really authentic style though  think chefs could opt food more but business standpoint think choose otherwise their clientele appears mostly locals surrounding neighborhood   Overall there's nothing wrong it! But I'd recommend places Chinatown area if want authentic  think hot sauce homemade  sure what's going  definitely unique  But just say normal Sriracha chili sauce would suffice    If you're area live nearby highly recommend giving place least once  did 15% off July customers door though ends today  maybe Yelpers time Nevertheless food decent value average $7 95 la carte steamed rice   didn't look but wouldn't doubt good lunch special well  OK time leftovers plenty!   Just well run service deserve returning business definitely back! <EOR> This place definitely definition hole in the wall   I love place  love coming here  people nice friendly  never felt welcome   The give such big portion many things come entree ridiculous   I definition recommend everyone come give try  regret coming here   Their sweet sour shrimp chicken good   It die for  <EOR> Talk bang your buck lunch special! first looking prices thinking myself really cheap  first thought why even bother places Panda Express when fresh made order chinese food same price?? though limited options Liu's lunch special menu  blown away Liu's full page choose from  truly diverse menu too   would think experience most places see lunch specials limited  broken down different proteins chicken beef pork shrimp  Most them your traditional chinese options find most other restaurants  Also only does options start end entree  give option hour sour soup egg drop soup  Even your starch steam rice fried rice  Some entrees your typical ones plan checking next visit    I ended ordering general tso chicken  felt okay  chicken admit cooked point  nice crispy outside chicken cooked perfection inside nice steaming hot  sauce did work  felt sauce just bottle sweet spicy hot sauce any asian market shelf  If anything more sweet then anything  egg roll comes all lunch specials good  really liked most pot stickers  Talk HUGE  them thinking use pot stickers being certain size most part eat biter two  Liu's pot stickers take two three bites  Still even oversized  nice sear side  pork filling only cooked perfectly but nice taste it  dipping sauce perfect compliment  six pieces per order  Surprise able eat everything good thing came LIu recovery meal day triathlon training  when comes value down Liu's lunch hidden gem   The service excellent friendly love vibe small family businesses  might order wrong lunch special but many more options try  Just cause ok lunch know Liu's more offer  price doubt plan coming back trying more menu  Once find Ono am sure see bump updated review Just keeping real  <EOR> Liu's Kitchen surprisingly pretty good blow your mind but excellent choice some Chinese food  See pics posted yum They $5 75 $6 75 lunch special selected dishes 40 different ones using chicken pork beef shrimp which included steamed fried rice chow mein egg roll soup   solid deal always complain having enough $5 meals around Vegas always $10+   wasn't feeling well instantly thought egg drop soup something crispy spicy   General Tso's Chicken w egg roll steam rice egg drop soup http www yelp com biz_photos lius kitchen las vegas?select=JeWE4l25T4G1aEDj6PAQQg#Yjq_E0xGqUs_mAjolJEumA asked if could chicken extra crispy did  crispy spicy liking filled lots chili peppers  sauce wasn't sweet which also liked  egg roll crispy  egg drop soup made feel  lot better cause wasn't feeling well going in   Clean tasty menu cheap friendly new business SW oh yea back definitely  Spicy Honey Chicken dish which looks good pics posted want try more menu  deliver orders least $15 within 3 miles also take orders online which always good  <EOR> Ok totally excited find place BBQ pork buns thought would never happen but did! really good!!!! recommend alone  The hot sour soup quite tasty egg rolls teenie tiny but good crab Rangoon  Now mixed review ordered beef w vegetable few other YELPers found beef different strange texture vs others chicken chow mien bit greasy side  Sad  The veggies fresh but sauce taste   Overall 4 probably give them another shot when crave Pork Bao update review  <EOR> Very sad  first visit excellent thought found new hidden gem  whole family loved very reasonable  Second time food par even half good first time I ordered same items  third time chicken INEDIBLE    white dark gray chicken  seems though quality ingredients just initial opening  guess figured established themselves enough able start ordering low grade meat  awful won't back  <EOR> Try salt pepper pork walnut shrimp!
