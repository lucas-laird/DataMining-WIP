Highly recommend going if you're good feed  Plenty healthy choices well but must admit gave quite few those tasty pastries    <EOR> I Bellagio buffet  Its toss between Mandalay Bay Bellagio  French food say place about  Although eat any kind seafood say best selection crab  Alaskan King crab snow crab buckets! place crab heaven if crab  melted butter scoop your hearts content champagne glass now those cheapy plastic containers other casinos  salad selection course choices bread  eat bread although love bread because high carb content but enough that  bread tried! delicious real butter side  Soft butter frozen kind  butter room temperature easy spread your bread  Yum!   Alright downside place ready wait  felt line Disneyland into those rides! line long! waited 75 minutes seated stayed 2 hours inside  Prepare wait folks  worth wait but come starving hungry because wait end grouchy impatient time cashier  Eat enough hour wait then ready feast! Happy eating1 <EOR> Had dinner nothing really special compared Louisiana buffets   King crab snow crab menu but served cold almost frozen   Louisiana casino buffets actually steam crabs which believe taste better   Everything else buffet just nasty below standards taste   If wasn't crabs I'd give place 1 star   Seems all Vegas buffets suffer same disease large square footage but small selections high price   built flash  <EOR> Went brunch lunch family    opted Bellagio over Wynn based reviews  arrived 1100 finally through long line around 1200  pleasantly surprised cleanliness huge variety food drinks  little bit everything meats pastas seafood salads pizzas breads fruits breakfast items omlet station pancakes waffles warm maple syrup thick slabs bacon red potatoes sausage SO YUMMY!!!! desserts!!!

All all food above meh   can't say blown away but wasn't horrified either  expecting good given buffet situation but overall pretty    average    Would back restaurant? Probably not  heard Wicked Spoon much better  But then again buffet really much better another? Isn't eternal question? <EOR> We Wednesday night only did wait over hour line but didn't many main course vegetarian options tofu veggie meat loafs etc  vegan definitely couldn't eat cause they'd just fruit  Much meat side dishes along meat  don't think i'd pay $36 again eat overly rich pasta pizza dessert vegetarian  probably ate $5 worth food if that  food nicely presented though staff friendly  can't accommodate many people timely manner  circus  wouldn't back because expensive food options limited vegetarians takes WAY long in  <EOR> My wife just ate lunch based recommendation local  worst buffets tried Vegas  food less mediocre most cases barely edible  Breads stale dry flavors most things seemed bland cheap platter fresh burgers just put already cold  Avoid buffet spend your money elsewhere! <EOR> A friend wanted try best buffet Vegas underwhelmed  We're foodies San Francisco admit being very spoiled coming land amazing food  most impressive element beautiful presentation  buffet plentiful lots options  Overall food could more thoughtfully seasoned  crab legs cocktail shrimp watery  hard crackers stone crab claws because them server didn't see server quite while    Stand outs pesto mashed potatoes steak tartare tuna poke raw salmon kale salad cheeses pizza  fell short homemade bread pastas Asian food sausages looked amazing but tasted off  just flown starving but unfortunately took long time seated line seemed move  could because arrived right lunch dinner change over but no mentioned that  plus side desserts good fun sample several because small  <EOR> The buffet always long line in  Then pricey but seafood good tho  might come back  But liked ceasar palace's Better <EOR> I stayed Bellagio during first week November thought would write review Buffet since probably best things Bellagio  Now keep mind vacationing Vegas more 20+ years am very picky buffets  also am seafood lover main reason going buffet while Vegas paying $30+  line long even breakfast but if player's card straight front  Also if don't mind eating counter straight front  Even 9 morning Sunday seafood bluefin tune salmon bass shrimp crablegs etc   made order ommelette w crab then stuffed myself bluefiin tuna salmon bass delicious!   some watermelon dessert!

I wish bigger stomach times all very good quite few things unable try  <EOR> Great choices many  Mountains crab shrimp kobe beef salads sides  Desserts all tasted same though  Skip jean louis  <EOR> So local bellagio buffet favorites strip ! quality usually top notch but unfortunately today April 29 2015 food quite disappointing  just item but whole experience tonight   juice super water downed tell old  Steak pizza super dry  old tasting   bass tasted good previously times came   desert best part but can't really mess desert   Idk if new Chiefs just bad day but would let them know food game gone down isn't good past  Time step again reclaim your tittle best buffets strip because tonight standard   <EOR> This high class buffet great service rather good price especially get   food displayed appetizing way none appears tastes cheap buffet food come used to   Servers come regularly check even though much  staff friendly helpful   Good experience tasty food  <EOR> Hmmmm    Buffet Bellagio     Excellent  They good selection food desserts  All which tasted very good  even audacity try crab meat  Which saying lot since buffet all am allergic shell fish  However crab sweet delicious did suffer any food poisoning insert cheers   place might little crowded chaotic depending time day but overall positive experience   Definitely worth money wait  <EOR> Very underwhelming especially being Bellagio  Selection limited compared Bacchanal food just wasn't good   It might more acceptable regular price but December holiday pricing which made $10 extra per person  sure difference but still did impress   For price better options town  <EOR> The food delicious ! many many many choices choose Asian Italian  Pho lovers your own pho  don't add pho sauce very salty   favorite section all desert section  cheesecakes tiramisu must ! Also many many many ice cream flavor choose from  recommend getting macaron stale ! staff also alright  <EOR> I think buffet really good especially steak seafood  offer different kind juice wine  recommend eating dinner time because offer fresh crab scallop all eat  Although price little high but worth price! <EOR> Very disappointed   my husband did dinner buffet  around 5pm Friday night  no wait immediately seated  staff very friendly but food fell short  selection adequate but quality lacking  Most entrees luke warm tasted sitting awhile    We ate Caesar's Palace buffet earlier week Bellagio's buffet pales comparison  Bellagio's buffet cheaper but definitely worth spending little bit more money better quality food     The service great but food isn't any different strip mall buffet  <EOR> Dinner Good but wasn't great expected  However breakfast lunch lot better! Free drinks soft drinks juices coffee tea $12 unlimited alcohol package available  Staff very rude unorganised however waiters friendly but very few mind then running around past lot trying 5 man job own  <EOR> The absolute best buffet town! Amazing fresh seafood crab already pre cracked sliced down center extremely easy at  dessert section alone deserved savored everything FRESH stale old hard sitting out  Great prime rib great desserts great service very clean environment great place dinner! <EOR> great food great alcohol great ambience great everything   duck ostrich lamb along quail  !!! <EOR> The most delicious wonderful buffet ever!  am fan buffet  You explore culinary world here    North America South America Europe Asia      Crepes blintzes eggs Benedict pizza tortilla pork buns waffles pancakes desserts galore all delicious   Mimosa Bloody Mary champagne Wow <EOR> My favorite buffet strip! particularly breakfast  Plenty everything always putting hot food  great experiences every time gone gone quite bit! Pro tip Arrive 30 minutes before dinner starts pay lunch price when put dinner food  <EOR> One best buffets part MLIFE series  Food delicious love all stations  Dessert best hostesses waiters prompt attentive  pretty loud look if many people moving fast all over place but ok once actually sit down  come back here  <EOR> Long wait line over 1 5 hrs!  early!  unforgivable because many empty tables never used    There slightly more dish choices Hometown Buffet probably even many Golden Corral  If off strip M Resort much more choices shorter lines   The pizzas cold   Waited advertised pizza asked took them 30 minutes put out!   The asian food nasty  thai chicken salad didn't chicken  LOL! The ribs propane taste it  The smoked salmon good but several pieces hadn't finished dethawing still frozen core! Liked carrot cake bread pudding   Bottom Line Go only if want wait 1 5 hrs mediocre food   Otherwise there's much better buffets restaurants  <EOR> One favorite things when visit Las Vegas going buffets  first time coming Bellagio Buffet reading best disagree  First say server wonderful! Even though busy she came around regularly take empty plates refill drinks  food average variety also average  disappointed dinner food didn't come until 45 minutes actual dinner time mostly lunch foods while stations empty  most disappointing no gelato dessert!!! Even lower scale buffets strip that! really expected more Bellagio am very disappointed  marking off list buffets to   There other buffets strip same price better dessert selection even include unlimited beer wine exact same price Bellagio Buffet  just can't stop shaking head one  <EOR> Bellagio say?  I stood line hour plus when finally sat down server came frequently   However truly baffled small area buffet was! seen bigger buffets 2 3 star hotels strip off!  I enjoyed crab carrot cake everything tasted expensive rather rich hearty  Thus quality food necessarily better but superior subjective high end realm taste    Was worth $20 plus dollars smaller selection dinner fast service long lines expensive tasting but comfort like food? depends you're asking    I'll pass  <EOR> Where start     Maybe rude less enthusiastic cashier entrance taking 86 dollars wife enjoy nice meal maybe ROCK bit down when eating mussel  Only manger come greet say he rock meal two days prior  maybe long shot but am thinking thing j want hear considered am pissed off already then he says give 20 percent off meal okay ? way comped meal while security officer hands piece paper says write Down description happened? No am going write essay off your lazy behind write report yourself isn't your job? Any ways if read far eat your own risk bring your dentist just incase  <EOR> The buffet okay    reminded Old Country Buffet plus crab legs  selection very surprising large  Online said buffet max $3 but charged $40 99 each  $88 average buffet worth time money    Very disappointed wish could money back    <EOR> This Vegas best buffets  Now put shame any campus feeding troth  Plastic coffee drink cups! your own drink  want money back  Avoid  <EOR> Absolutely worst buffet ever   food sucks ASS !!!!! many casino buffets far   Straight shitty ! might off night   However tried little everything nothing remotely palatable!  Oh well gave try  all  say   Buyer beware  !!!! And yes stayed Bellagio 4 nights during trip   Great place   Buffet      Sucks Balls   <EOR> went during thanksgiving family     wait almost 3 hours food sushi crab mostly cold feel frozen huge disappointment   Wynn next day buffet much better shorter line    won't bother again  <EOR> While Bellagio bf decided swing buffet lunch  Just time seemed start line lunch rush  wait wasn't terrible but assume just little bit luck  seated game started  Judging food bring back your first plate clearly depicts your buffet navigation skill  clearly upper hand over boyfriend politely circled nearest island food  set adventure came back better food spread  Probably best compliment buffet where did that?   said felt selection pretty good a little something everyone bacon eggs sushi smoked fish cheese blinis salads mini burgers shrimp cocktail etc  really difficult plate dessert first  server attentive food delicious  lunch best deal  <EOR> Pesto mashed potatoes  Yuuuuummmmmmm   I Bellagio even though costs maybe another $5 other buffets Strip unlimited Mimosas great selection all you can eat especially fresh fruits some interesting food combinations brunch buffet those pesto mashed potatoes  best buffets Vegas personal favorite  <EOR> Truly dizzying array choices around world await here   if you're typical American opts quantity over quality then buffet won't disappoint    admittedly did somewhat enjoy wolfing down ghastly amount food buffet but also dishes plate left uneaten bad     i completely different experience Paris' Le Village Buffet   actually savored every dish plate food good wiped plate clean   opinion Le Village more culinary masterpieces Bellagio's buffet  <EOR> Everything would expect  only waited 40 mins  Wouldn't wait more hour even unlimited champagne  Solid buffet  However breakfast doesn't crab legs   just case wanted some  wait dinner <EOR> Enjoyed Buffet more any other LV    Better Spice Market better Wynn    Why?  We front long ash line riiiiight 4pm charged 20 person lunch rate   feel bad party behind us  mean really difference between them what    another 15 20 dollars per person? charged much less because line 10 seconds before did  If roles reversed woulda sucked  happened day SWEET  When cashier he told person controlling line last lunch rate folks in  Dinner lunch prices cool    I able try most dishes liked majority them  favorites trip Gulf Shrimp w Cocktail sauce plentiful bigger Spice Market Buffet very tasty    I never understood allure crab legs those waterlogged fiber y morsels dullness seriously supposed way? All 3 buffet's crab legs cold waterlogged flavorless    what's appeal? but shrimp sweet little tiny snap them not mushy waterlogged all     Loved prime rib kobe steak lamb not gamey little bites all around had  place best sushi three salmon tuna poke tasty well   Also whoever said strawberry tart delicious spot on  loved it  sweet but nice way end meal   Will back next outing  miss shrimp already = I worried since some people said buffet downhill but trying all say if downhill joint musta something rediculously special when first opened! <EOR> The Bellagio buffet bad  actually quite good  couple things though spoiled experience seating area quite badly designed  felt your average American diner instead something special  very dirty  food floor table which hadn't cleaned properly seats felt seen cleaner days  Nothing terrible but definitely would expect  Wynn buffet right next door <EOR> I want start saying buffets iffy  Usually hit miss but visit definitely hit! usually love buffets but only if crab legs which buffet lots of! King Crab Snow Crab  all ice but ask steamed  said before love buffets but boyfriend keen buffets until he ate here! He actually satisfied dinner said he would back    only gave four stars because offer unlimited alcoholic beverages Bayside Buffet does Mandalay Bay  desserts weren't great but did banana foster ice cream actually tasted ice cream! Also review dinner only which $30 per person  <EOR> Can say yum?  Probably best buffets ever to   Save bit money lining right before lunch ends save money still food serve lunch dinner   Amazing desserts   Crab great but needed bit defrosted last time    Worth trip money sure  <EOR> Bellagio losing its touch customer service   couple friends March 2012  7 45pm sitted 8pm  food selection poor most foods lukewarm  Maybe because getting late  Las Vegas every year always enjoyed food Bellagio but time disappointment  waste money too  called manager next day told call back Monday  explained flying day but manager didn't care  <EOR> All eat Chilean Sea Bass side Venison some Buffalo? Heck yea! Throw some fresh sushi sashimi?? FIVE STARS BABY!  The  Best  Buffet  In  Las Vegas   Do argue me   I am LV buffet connoisseur   The food tasty savory many many MANY dishes choose from  food bays expansive  believe 9? may counted wrong midst food coma last time there  least 8  less expensive Wynn buffet way more selection  no Carnival Buffet RIO but food fresher more specialties available food just tastes better   Desserts? Divine    Service? Superb   Price? Perfect  <EOR> I've twice already enjoy it   big seafood punk when comes buffets overload it   avoid pastas breads other filler junk find OCB Old Country Buffet    The meat seafood choices highlights   Crab legs   Sushi handrolls   Anything cutting stations     I wanted head over Wynn which amazing but closer Caesar's  <EOR> The place fine but definitely outstanding   impressed any single item  However does large selection fruits deserts   don't understand concept ice cold crab legs Vegas  literally chew ice crystals crab legs huge fan  opinion buffet best but worst either  <EOR> I usually come buffet when Vegas because best strip past experiences  good selection just many things cared time went   Very pricey considering ate  ate usual suspects crab legs cocktail shrimp  crab legs very small thin maybe bottom batch  miso sea bass good   filled mostly creamed spinach mushrooms  Big selection desert tried most them  only ones liked creme brulee vanilla ice cream better when ate them together   Food wasn't anything great but then again buffet job done   Service great they took plates away quickly everyone new cup seltzer before finished first without having ask  <EOR> I many buffets Vegas lunch dinners far best  If you're buffet person should give try  So many varieties food selections  Food quality above average almost find any type food could imagine  Italian station well steak station among best  If holiday occasion usually waiting line but you'll seated pretty soon  One fact people neglecting never expect high end menu restaurant food quality buffet considering mind I'd say Bellagio good choice repeat if you're planning buffet meal  Dessert station really nice many options  Staff friendly but they're busy could take them sometimes check you  One advice going buffet toward end lunch time way you'd pay lunch which normally cheaper sit through dinner enjoy added items dinner well  <EOR> at first buffet looked beaUtiful   course better price  food delecious   baked chicken pizza pasta yum   guess very late because dessert drying tasted stale   don't think husband correct stomachs all rich food ended getting sick   overall ok rio carnival buffet best   bad last day   can't wait again!!!!!! <EOR> Came Friday Gourmet buffet hoping some better quality food   wait very long probably around 5min since around 5pm  wasn't much sashimi sushi bar have ask them salmon sashimi but bf enjoyed spicy tuna poke  sea bass average definitely good when home piece bluenose completely dry  veal bad fell off bone easily enough   thing really killed whole meal kobe beef  saw bf piece thought would give try but piece rare center still bleeding   bf assured still edible did give several bites but taste pretty much killed appetite any other kinds meat night   ate two more plates dessert since figure should harmless   creme brulee chocolate covered strawberries favorites  top all off within 5min leaving buffet immediately look bathroom   may just stomache cannot handle rare meat but there's no way give decent mark since basically flushed $38 down toilet soon eating here  <EOR> Great buffet! best Vegas  Huge selection foods lunch $22 dinner $ 40 walked having gained almost 10 lbs  ultimate favorite dessert  Various cakes sweets available  carrot cake bananas foster  If love red meat sure come dinner  Endless prime rib lamb Kobe beef etc  Sushi selections numerous  Would definitely eat again  <EOR> The Bellagio buffet probably best if best buffet Vegas  reason why probably wait hour Saturday brunch buffet  buffet massive offering such lox bagels eggs pasta Chinese food sushi Vietnamese spring rolls steamed shrimp salads good carving station  also champagne Saturday brunch which also featured bottomless champagne $30 $25 buffet only    The lox very fresh fishy  wouldn't expect such high quality lox buffet but pleasant surprise  Vietnamese springs rolls also awesome  tried eggs benedict which good well items carving station  only miss probably Chinese food  worse hole in the wall Chinese primarily because amount oil present each dish lack quality sauces preparation  Everything else top notch though    This buffet definitely trumps any others including Paris buffet which also liked quite bit  <EOR> Bellagio buffet vs  Wynn buffet?  dinner both places consecutive days made point hungry   result Bellagio tko   This place fresh tuna moist prime rib desserts more depth character better ice tea better french sour dough better salad selection   short contrast Wynn no tuna pathetic desserts tasted oily rather rich dry prime rib nasty rasberry flavored ice tea horrible service   Don't waste your money anywhere else   If you're going binge food plump yourself nice yourself eat instead     One negative crab   started slicing crab legs half result they've become freezer burned iodine aftertaste   Now legs dry salty   Why fuck good thing?

Save your money would better aMcDonald! <EOR> I come Alaskan king crab legs  it   Totally worth money just that! <EOR> I looked reviews looked should good lunch but worse Golden corral meal children $7 99  Steak absolutely no taste then tried chicken dry cold  Dessert tried brownie also very dry tasteless last but least try cookie would've better off if Pillsberry grocery store  Will back!! <EOR> Lots variety  Wish more sushi variey though   buffet particularly good if love meat other protein products quite selection  Loved desserts here  Food quality average   Overall decent buffet  <EOR> Die halbe Stunde Wartezeit hat sich gelohnt  Grosse Auswahl Speisen sehr guter Qualität  Wer hier nichts findet ihm schmeckt dem ist nicht zu helfen   Kinder zahlen leider ebenfalls den vollen Preis von fast 40 $ Wir haben den Fehler gemacht gleich am Eingang viel Trinkgeld zu geben und nicht erst dem aufmerksamen Kellner am Tisch  das war nicht clever    <EOR> Went lunch give place best bang buck   Only $20 lunch prime rib kobe beef more   desert bar more Wynn   place just soft serve ice cream instead gelato    line pretty quick too   If decide between Wynn breakfast lunch recommend here  <EOR> This buffet step compare Wynn's buffet! Bellagio beautiful desserts different selections food Wynn but more delicious! Bellagio your last buffet Vegas! Because know say save best last  definitely best ever! <EOR> This buffet entire life! group fans buffets fancy swanky type but y loved bellagios take it! Sunday brunch buffet lines extremely long! line passes casino office if you're nice ask right people move invited guest area instantly! French toast die beverages included 25 dollar price  add endless champagne just 5 dollars more  buffet worth every penny  <EOR> Pros Good food all around rack lamb great lot good pasta dishes hand tossed pizzas lot great fish etc   Great service took plates quickly topped drinks quicly well    It's Bellagio completely boring Wynn close Caesars palace my two favorites     Cons Price memorial day weekend jacked price $30 lunch $40 Dinner  waited 1 hour long ass line 2 30 afternoon made lunch    The deserts just average obnoxious table next us  kobe beef leg lamb prime rib wasn't great imo    the transition brunch dinner took long    Honestly good but am definitely trying Wynn next time  just don't know if worth money end which really all right ? Obviously would never complain if $10    just sayin' D <EOR> To date best buffet ever to  All around perfection  eaten least 5 times definitely back   Yes line long if your staying Bellagio  sucks but 100% worth wait  Another slight drawback cost  $35 dinner but cheap hell 5 star dinner   Staff very friendly but intrusive  Tables cleaned quick always around if u need something   Now food! King crab legs all eat  pound things $15 market easy  sushi station pre made sushi some specialty hand rolls  Perfect prime beef  desert bar cry vast   Last time sick miserable cold still enjoyed myself    Unless your budget very tight here! variety vast eat almost every night did  <EOR> Parmi tous les buffets testés il y maintenant 2 ans à raison d'un par jour le Bellagio était l'un de mes préférés avec le Wynn  Ce qui m'avait le plus marqué ici c'était certainement les gaufres toutes marquées du B du Bellagio la grande classe je vous dis !  Petite astuce le mieux selon moi c'est d'arriver un peu avant la fin du service breakfast qui termine à 11h ainsi vous ne payez que 17$ par personne avec les taxes et si vous prenez bien votre temps ce qui ne vous demande pas beaucoup d'effort vous pourrez profiter pleinement du buffet du lunch qui commence à 12h Autrement dit vous allez faire 2 voir même 3 repas en 1    pas de doute vous êtes bien dans la ville de tous les excès !!!  Je rejoins un peu Axle M  sur le cadre qui n'est pas vraiment à la hauteur de la renommée de l'hôtel et de la qualité de la cuisine servie sinon je mettais moi aussi une cinquième étoile sans hésiter ! <EOR> Went Buffet Bellaggio very disappointed should erase part NO KING CRAB LAMB KOBE BEEF SASHIME Use every day no more only Fri Sun Last time we'll eat there Thats why rating dropping compared other BUFFET THE STAFF very good hard working should giving BIG BONUS  WORTH PRICE EAT YOU'VE WORN  <EOR> IT cool all eat all could stuff face but really   even all alcohol world could hide food just mediocre  <EOR> We started day drunken debauchery couldn't more wonderful  $30 all drink mimosas buffet! don't need into details but basically ends entire group very happy place around 1 afternoon Venetian pool where continued drink lives away  <EOR> We ate first day Vegas  Since starving buffet just downstairs decided try out  food good great price  wasn't much variety expecting  Though hotel itself wonderful better places eat  If want buffet worth price try Planet Hollywood  <EOR> Well worth $28 dinner  Everything awesome  liked different varieties fish here  Long line but real quick  definitely going back  <EOR> Really expected more bellagio! nothing special buffet  felt smaller other buffets vegas  first plate mostly breakfast things didn't eat any just dry bland  Ribs prime rib only thing stood memorable  But back more gone  Desert great  opted $12 extra unlimited drinks great value since getting mimosas but margaritas serving didn't taste any tequila them all  would recommend spending extra $20 wicked spoon  <EOR> Where start? first time staying Vegas experiencing buffet really looking forward trying  Disappointed under statement  price wife paid ridiculous quality food had  some items never tried actually pretty yummy but other things great  crab legs looking forward trying COLD  shrimp cod salmon flavorless    What good though crawfish tiramisu smoked salmon tart looking thing fish egg top  Everything else just substandard    I recommend place nor returning  <EOR> Take your credit cards cash priciest buffet you'll ever experience  cheap back 2004 me  Luckily won $5K Bellagio poker tournament later night  both visits back 2004 2012 same high quality items  Casual wear good  mentioned it' very high priced thus four star rating me  Still expect classiest casinos world  <EOR> Very sub par food very disappointed  Waitress very friendly tipped but other place worth it  <EOR> Now satisfying experience should able please most people  scam little bit though telling upfront japanese italian stations lay stuff until noon  11am many others noon already eaten other stations reasonably full  But loved decor most food available us  When sushi finally came better sushi eaten other buffets  Hope helps! <EOR> It really everything  Gourmet food breakfast  well worth price if three rounds food  <EOR> Oh Bellagio always did right  first never thought you'd let down  But b i g  way  your first love believe everything say think they'll always you  But then disappoint you've never disappointed before  things never same again          alright review    I'm hard reviewer always give benefit doubt  try find silver lining  But when deceive me        with Bellagio first started deception  Dec  29 2015  Beforehand checked pricing website  looked legit brunch $23 99 dinner $34 99  headed door brunch 3 adults 3 kids  did usual wait line least hour  pay charged $36 99 brunch!

Bellagio also cheaper Wynn $38 Wicked Spoon $37 while quality remains just high  So many delicious foods couldn't move past 1 food station without filling plate! lol Desserts also delicious minus bread pudding bananas foster  FAV white chocolate cream nutella chocolate covered mini waffle cup!! could eat 20 them!!!!!! 9 <EOR> If could give no stars would!!! Let warn all recommend place brother sister food poisoning crab legs place mom only ate pasta salad pizzas since we're big fans sea food honestly wasn't even all 40 bucks person sick!!!! plans next day couple events paid couldn't even attend since leave early doctors since throwing diarrhea non stop just over all horrible experience belagio  Wish would just rio carnival buffet plan now know    just wanna warn people cause wouldn't want anyone going through vacation well <EOR> Really enjoyed buffet something everyone   Xmas day queue 4 hours long 3pm!  if M life card use it  It over $100 two cheaper when holidays but really good food  <EOR> Dinner very disappointed enough choose from  all food very salty  not impressed  will recommend Rio's buffet <EOR> Not expected price   Its Bellagio name should speak itself   Cold crab subpar food nothing really hot wait times what? <EOR> Great buffet experience Vegas   Delicious food fine dining area   Great variety food around world   Don't forget reserve room dessert lots lots them  <EOR> I've eaten couple times  second favorite buffet Vegas  come just before dinner pay lunch dinner spread  Again love crab legs! Love meats salads breads etc     The Bacchanal Buffet just upper hand some reason guess way serve crab legs Bacchanal quicker because there's station where pick cold crab legs another separate station if want boiled crab legs  line Bellagio slow!  I did great sort private booth made experience better   The line buffet slow too! Bacchanal fast just let ya know! The food still top notch though  <EOR> I've only handful AYCE's Vegas tops far   The carved meat fruit stood particularly deserve shout out   Smoked salmon sushi desserts honorable mention   However everything excellent service through execution   Other places could learn many thing Buffet Bellagio  <EOR> The lunch buffet ran $30 but there's great selection food  other reviewers stated beef wellington crab legs served lunch  expecting neither disappointed  haven't pleasure staying Bellagio yet but lucky take peasants off street  quick glance place clientele obvious weren't Golden Corral  buffet selection bomb   shrimp steak pasta sushi several things delicious even though sure were  price overall experience recommended stop  <EOR> We did brunch buffet truly delicious  much variety  most enjoyed prime rib chow mein carrot cake  Worth money  <EOR> Bottom line Good food selection buffet Very !!! long line 1 5 hrs so would given them 4 stars if line wasn't long <EOR> Another buffet Strip   Definitely better most but still without its flaws   Buffet Bellagio probably most recommended when coming Vegas but doesn't always live hype   Lines incredibly long times   Waiting upwards  hour    just eat Vegas   decor drab dim doesn't really convey good eating atmosphere   food mediocre but does better weekends which few dollars more well   If happen Buffet line isn't very long bad choice   Otherwise somewhere else come back some other time  <EOR> My boyfriend family dined Bellagio Buffet last night boyfriend became incredibly eating seafood there  spent entire day room throwing almost passing out  called Bellagio told them going which said only report nothing else  fact tue manager worst seemed skeptical said cant anything without tye receipt number  spent 20 minutes finding receipt number then asked give entire credit card information through phone  felt doing something wrong reporting incident   didn't even once ask boyfriend feeling completely unsympathetic  didn't offer any help comfort  am really disappointed service execution help during illness emergency  <EOR> Was really same restaurant all other people? buffet people!   The king crab very good quality tons it  Both salmon tuna Pokes excellent  sushi better quality then most buffets but hot fish dishes universal overcooked status  miso cod especially awful both watery tough      Miso soup soup quite strange   tasted combination cream mushroom soup miso   blech  other soup cannot remember if squash pumpkin pretty good      The only pasta tried Wild Mushroom ravioli  very good  daughter said mac cheese adequate but nothing special      The Sirloin okay   but again nothing special     As prior Yelper noted bread pudding very good   especially if put Banana Fosters sauce it   all other desserts looked little plastic fake nastiness     So   my recommendation go eat your weight king crab Poke sushi hava bite two specialty pasty soup   and hit bread pudding up  If those items all rating   I woulda given place 5 used buffets all time when daughter little   I think both outgrown them    <EOR> I guess doesn't much better this  Only place improvement table area which felt glorified canteen posh admit   The array offered food amazing surely should come without healthy appetite  But 19 95 breakfast guess nobody that  To avoid another mistake don't hold yourself bread if want salad start take good look around first otherwise might end well filled soon because still keep discovering more dishes  lol thinking now 10days later hungry    Was bit disappointed waiter every other table he worked more smile can't say could done honestly  Since don't want jump conclusions won't say more  Maybe all hovering around room empty plates off disappointed puny tips some folks leave    then again disinterested demeanor going change that   But still couldn't spoil delicous meal ! Highly recommend  oh come rather early guess     only because low season found table right away sure  Waiting lines high season reported dozens yards long <EOR> Headed dinner some friends over Easter weekend   I'd list places eat some time certainly disappointed   quality all food very good especially considering fact such large variety   walk into buffet area greeted large assortment sushi both nigiri various rolls    passed headed pile crab legs lurking behind sushi bar   split crab legs easier eat which plus   No need waste precious buffet time cracking open bunch crab legs!  Also along way find traditional American cuisine such mashed potatoes prime rib along other ethnic delights such grape leaves Chinese specialties   Among surprises beef wellington which found most other buffets   melts your mouth   desserts leave something imagination better ones found elsewhere   But excellent place enjoy nice meal if justify cost  <EOR> Our second day LV decision where dine highly influenced some top reviews Bellagio Buffet    prepare wait!   least hour Saturday afternoon unless privileged guest then course queue omitted    price paid $60 43 two    large selection different cuisine well worth price    hotel itself very impressive water fountain lobby botanical garden we missed changing decoration Autumn season course chocolate fountain  <EOR> Dear management came brunch large group friends 30th birthday  Your buffet beautiful food incredible but really stood service  server only she incredibly hospitable but she intuitive kind  She brought birthday dessert that she designed herself paid bottomless drinks she served before any even asked  She made feel very honored guests did everything happy  Service very hard come if she eligible any type promotion she deserves it  perfect example hospitality should look like  Thank So  <EOR> I understand rave reviews but didn't find *taste* food very good  selection amazing however  quality also really good  But everything just little bland liking  Nothing stuck out  Might arriving 9pm but shouldn't matter  there's beef wellingtons racks lamb cut order buffet  worth $40 entry fee me  rather eat really good dish $40 eat bunch fancy bland food  But  just me  <EOR> Kobe beef rather dry seems might sat awhile buffets food exactly made order fresh but all all thought OK experience definitely enjoyed food <EOR> Was family dining credit use  restaurants Bellagio where could use credits nice but could use credit buffet dinner breakfast next day  Dinner $35 breakfast $19  Breakfast much better deal  All standard stuff egg bacon sausage pancakes waffles  Did want wait line omelet  Some nice things eggs benedict very good  also decent choice chinese breakfast items such rice porridge steamed pork buns  Dessert breakfast dinner identical but lot desserts  all desserts very good whatever did try dinner breakfast then some   dinner prime rib very good best item  call Kobe top round roast tough should avoid  selection dinner covers pretty much everything  crab legs cold but give plate crab legs person behind counter heat up  sure but suspect just microwave it  Wife crab legs but just much work eat  Kids happy mac cheese small ramekins pizza ribs course desserts  both dinner breakfast waited 20 minutes in  midweek dinner around 6 00 pm breakfast around 10 00 am  other thing very good coffee  <EOR> How disappointed  lunch couldn't believe sub par food was  guess since heard such good things expected better  Caesars new buffet night before buffet doesn't come close  sliders overcooked  ribs terrible  Sushi choices all veggie until she finally made spicy tuna roll which average  Salads good  If pesto place  All pastas pesto mashed potatoes pesto good  Desserts good  reputation expected better  <EOR> Hands down best buffet anywhere  All eat Fine dining  king crab legs  Are sliced half easy eat  amount choices insane       must save room desert which hard do tried all other high end buffets  Vegas but always back one  <EOR> Their gourmet buffet best!

LOL anyway never ate buffet but wanted to!!!    Crazy thing right heard bad news power outage really    kitchen lost power new years eve closed all day until dinner!! next find water show performing because another technical difficulty probably related outage   Wow someone probably fired day   Imagine many hundreds thousands lost afternoon    Really new  years even 2012?   Gotta kidding guys     BTW over rio great seafood buffet least fill lobster crab wow luck power outage bellagio buffet NYE 2012 really     <EOR> There long line 30 people front took 20 minutes in  But worth wait   Food good but salmon mouthwatering  cooked right spot could actually ask them wanted cooked  Typically anywhere else you'll dry overcooked salmon but juicy pinkish but raw just perfect  Thanks chef!  Highly recommended! Good buffet  <EOR> As far buffet probably buffet most variety food imagine   ranges salad sushi steak Chinese food Italian   dessert table just never stops   people work behind some buffet tables probably actually chefs least look chefs    However just any buffet taste food replaced huge variety food  that means lot choices but don't really just piece really good something   impossible try all items buffet but did try enough think   am glad best buffet town   actually first meal Vegas   Can't say disappointed but can't say terribly impressed     Bottom line buffet  <EOR> Second time disappointed!  Excellent choices all phases your buffet gorge fest     Shrimp hit miss   Desserts less Wynn but overall pretty good always fresh     Salad bar seems vast desert no takers could easily reduce put another meat station     It's pricey dinner but they've crab legs crateful worth it   Yes back   Again  <EOR> Really poor selection lunch  Expensive but don't high expectations  Compared Aria buffet overpriced just really nothing special all  <EOR> We stayed next door Bellagio decided try buffet long Internet search best buffer Vegas   wait line bearable but definitely find yourself long line especially breakfast dinner times  supposed best buffet Vegas  say food quality top notch don't feel ripped off paying 50 dollars per person  offers massive wide array food options   it's died Vegas food heaven  Good food experience! <EOR> Bellagio Wynn best buffets town  They're also  priciest but worth every cent  If you've tried some other places Bellagio surprise its quality variety  Concentrate on the expensive items smoked salmon don't waste room on pizza salad eat anywhere  If you're confused  selection try small sample each item then next pass you'll know which dishes take  Most buffets only small number  of really good things when much selection makes sense plan ahead  Keep mind Bellagio DOES any good desserts besides fresh fruit don't worry saving room won't need it  last note plan tipping least 20% probably more  service good  <EOR> Best buffet ever ! brunch all drink mimosas ! Mmmmmm yummmm    best buffet ever most clean   its Lil pricey but well worth it <EOR> ALL REMEMBER EATING CRAB LEGS PRIME RIB SUSHI TONS TONS DESSERTS! I'd back eat desserts alone!

place fine when wife first came but now family full price kids pricing atrocious  back anytime soon   For comparison Wicked Spoon $5 more each adult but kids only cost 1 3  food better   The buffet Paris also does charge full price kids  <EOR> I visited Buffet around 1pm Monday   food so so very impressive   found and almost ate looked paper trash salad mix  waitress explained wrapper salad bag   I wouldn't back 5 girls all left hungry  <EOR> Definitely good buffet experience Vegas The food no big deal  Sushi quality disappointed dry rice few options also few options seafood  staff friendly polite  Takes forever replace used plates refill beverage  would recommend other buffet  <EOR> Don't even bother  Idk place gets 4 stars but VERY disappointed  excited try Buffett because good reviews but extremely disappointing  people behind counter rude  very limited selection honestly concerned food poisoning  just tired old blah food  bathroom disgusting  Never again!!!! Caesars palace Buffett instead!!! <EOR> Thought pretty good  Super busy kind squished close strangers but food good   Liked sliders vanilla dome dessert two!   Lots higher quality options tasty  Great waitstaff! meal free due myVegas slot game   Because able jump line people waiting seated immediately  Pretty cool usually nice wait  <EOR> Howzit!?  If Hawaiian Poke Buffet Bellagio decent Shoyu Poke Kukui Nuts   Great selection  Taste average above average depends select   Notable dishes Sea Bass Beef Wellington Roma Tomato soup Hawaiian Shoyu Poke   Good service   Minimum 1 hour wait Friday Saturday nights  <EOR> We arrived time right before dinner being served  Well first all bread terrible yeah eat almost everything including meat  crab legs OK but someone said really wasn't great  sushi subpar didn't look all fresh  Deserts only thing really enjoyed establishment    To sum all its worth going but over $23  BETTER buffets off strip Good Luck! <EOR> 3 stars feel  sorta generous Bellagio buffet   I buffett Bellagio years ago brunch didn't recall sticking extraordinary but didn't remember being bad either  stay Bellagio regularly but some reason hadn't back buffet until last trip  wasn't impressed    The line fairly long which fine but closer front could see tons tables seemed purposely keeping line long  Perhaps more appealing passers oh must good look line! The food selection plentiful if can't find something eat given all choices there's something wrong you  love prime rib tastey but slices pretty small  some good mushroom ravioli going vegies nice fresh  say entree good both plates worth      The desserts surprisingly bad  None group liked dessert  should noted food snobs any stretch enjoy good dessert much next person  BUT when going buffet establishment caliber Bellagio I'd expect desserts knock socks off  didn't  portions very small selection pretty skimpy all commented textures odd desserts all flavorless  let down  <EOR> Best Buffet Vegas  Worth wait line  food great endless variety food imaginable  Leave nice little tip servers taking away your plates finished food continuously asking beverages your choice  Definitely back when return Vegas  <EOR> I don't know paying $40 person dry turkey whatever but just less week ago paid $20ish lunch AMAZING! everything terriyaki flank steak sooo tender! pesto mashed potatoes sweet potatoes some kind fruit juice pineapple juice maybe? very creative unique! yummy!! pesto mozzarella balls walnuts cranberries    sushi crab legs fresh chilled shrimp mushroom ravioli truffle cream sauce    amazing   cheesecake best cheesecake ever had   crunchy coffee tiramisu dessert thing phenomenal   all wonderful   coffee even delicious   very very happy experience DEFINITELY going back next visit Vegas   loved it!  Oh probably wouldn't brunch Sunday because $40 $50 bucks think reasons happy experience because food incredible $20! Which pretty close rate other buffets town some which should ashamed themselves!   <EOR> I love buffets   I sit eat hours! Buffets need all day pass me  stuff myself silly full  Then four hours later hungry again  But anyways   so really really excited come see all hoopla about  came right before started serving lunch able eat brunch foods then transition into lunch  Fresh squeezed OJ served during brunch but lunch  Don't miss bc OJ really crisp refreshing! Brunch options good but then again really hard mess eggs benedict sausage  expecting everything really tasty but lunch options so so nothing spectacular  bunch international foods blah stayed away from  did stuff myself seafood smoked salmon! sushi isn't really worth save your tummy meats    Dessert also ok  pretty look but come short flavor  There's fresh fruit   fruits really aren't list gonna eat buffet but boyfriend stuffed whole bunch into backpack later  Hey we're Asian! Next time Vegas try Wynn buffet  <EOR> maybe its good if never buffet Wynn <EOR> We friend visiting loves buffets more buffets last few weeks I'd last year! Sadly underwhelmed Bellagio Buffet overall based price  remember loving past   week rating just OK  crab legs which adore trust am very discerning where crab legs concerned still bit frozen  Also remember past fruit options pretty upscale  berries such  week just melon  bananas    fact good sushi area plenty options saved night me  <EOR> Thought coming would great choice but wrong !!!! wait  table 15 20 minutes food drink quality very poor food bland spicy waitress did check mean understand busy but need more staff !!! only good thing place unfortunately beautiful hotel but needless say need redo buffet menu <EOR> To surprise buffet liked least  quality food there  food presented way didn't want eat but gave try anyway since already paid it  lot food tried didn't taste good tasted more canned frozen food  place smelled bad inviting scent sure very clean  Even dishes dirty waiter hard time finding clean fork wasn't stained residues  shame  <EOR> I 12 00  The line very quick 15' front door   We pay 161$ 5 people plus TIP dont forget Tip USA   thought food great lot option since hotel expensive   But buffet turn disappointed because food taste 3 10 scale   Never back  should spend money somewhere else better food  <EOR> Well 6 years ago would said buffet best thing ever anymore   After having buffet ARIA buffet Golden Corral compared    Food tasteless  Most over cooked crab legs no bigger pencil COLD serves steamed crab legs cold?   The sweet section nothing more frozen petit fours could buy Sams club thaw serve  told made fresh house daily  true  Maybe unfrozen daily    116 00 3 people honestly would enjoyed Panda Express more here  Waited 45 minutes seated probably only ate 20 minutes  walking through lines included  Very disappointed just don't see return trip us  <EOR> A large number options   am gluten intolerant asked hostess she seating gluten free options   She called chef kind enough give tour entire buffet   food reasonably tasty salads fresh    staff however seemed bit involved among themselves   dessert selection extensive gluten tolerant but only two those can't consume gluten <EOR> Skip this! Gourmet night because holiday Presidents Day $48 per person beer wine additional $14 99 per person   King crab served cold fact time your table your entire meal cold   server best yet tip prior sitting down she $18 bringing water  2 them  So if going spend $120 two people expect actual Gourmet meal filed king crab Kobe beef salmon     elsewhere  <EOR> I would say far best buffet Las Vegas  food all gourmet  wait bit long times would only downfall  <EOR> Enjoyed buffet each day stayed Bellagio  Breakfast probably favorite time go!! omelette biscuits gravy French toast  good! <EOR> All eat several different meanings me  mean all stand eat  mean all dare eat  mean all dare stand eat  mean Buffet Bellagio  Which means Mona loading taking no prisoners  talking some serious eating here   Smoke joint first  don't kid  may want work expanding your belly capacity  Again don't kid  some world class excess  nothing surpasses it   To those line fruit salads? Ha! laugh your general direction  When tray crab legs eye shot chose kiwi instead? some lame ass shit friend  seafood always impeccable  delicious    Turkey dinner? all fixings? Why not? Lamb chops? Bring 'em  just keeps coming  ate boss  he's big boy  made way back sixth plate he just giggled  did appreciate lovely waiter saying don't know where put honey  pass whipped cream dessert items  Now please excuse while wipe drool off shirt  <EOR> Awesome amazing much variety  much crab people filling plates 5 inches high crab unfortunately can't eat much but all very good  <EOR> I've never felt need leave review restaurants but experience friends yesterday night Thanksgiving unacceptable   1 Long wait knew beforehand wait going long but didn't expect wait over 4 hours   line 4 30pm seated around 9pm   2 Foods terrible crab legs defrosted prime rib dry kobe top sirloin dry fully cooked   did lamb rack though     3 Closes early seated around 9 00pm started ready close around 10pm did desserts fruits     many people line behind wonder if even able anything other appetizers salads   I know experiences probably mainly due Thanksgiving Holiday but price believe should able keep usual service food quality     I back   p s  did proof read grammar nazis pick someone else  <EOR> We holiday rush prices paying $29 99 per person dinner   Surprisingly rated top 10 buffets Las Vegas nothing special   Even Wynn ice sculptures chocolatiers remember    buffet disappointing say least but bit better some other buffets had     Food Why crab legs always cold?  Can't serve them hot once?  don't eat any seafood cold   desserts probably best but any other mass produced food best creme brulee strawberry tart vanilla pudding bottom   sushi mediocre being laid people taking mass quantity time   buffet leave some people line won't ya?  meats okay but all people hoarding food presentation lacked its luster   Service fortunate chosen line number people party so avoided 2 hour wait heard    ended sitting bar area staff very pleasant nice     Layout most buffets try separate things however seafood meats compacted same area better spread lines instead cramming them through sitting area   did want any those lines mostly salads desserts italian me   lot varied selection which found surprising   Even rio carnival buffet more thought haven't years can't vouch now    I wouldn't back   definitely going try M studio buffet next time   Although further south strip worth try something new price   hear even includes champagne wine part your meal purchase   Can't that! <EOR> Total disappointment!  The boyfriend came saturday night buffet cost $40 per person  Grant buffet however expected better quality    One thing really disappointed Kobe Beef   piece but tough rubbery hard time cutting through fork knife  Also crab legs very small  Didn't really enjoy any food here  Even desserts good  sweet and usually handle sweet things     It worth money come here  <EOR> One word WONDERFUL  come everytime am Vegas line always super long  If you're eating dinner sure line 5pm else would wasting least hour waiting long line  <EOR> Yummy lunch buffet! Lots different foods vegetarian options  only second buffet Vegas but there's good chance returning next trip! Warning sushi doesn't come until 12  prepared sit if early! <EOR> still far best quality food strip buffets! price most restaurants compete quality  bar setting within space nice touch  no else that   service average nothing bad but expect buffet?  decor should par cuisine seems very outdated bland Bellagio represents   even though buffet WHERE should warrant dress code   circus circus  <EOR> Very disappointed  Food just okay but almost $50 per head holiday menu price really poor value money  Food choice pretty limited quality would expect Bellagio   My in laws came 7 years ago raved it   All say quality clearly gone down time prices gone up  paid $25 each which probably made them feel worth going  would eat again  <EOR> So disappointed buffet last  night  husband eaten 2 years ago felt  best buffet strip many unusual delicious salads top chef meats pasta selection die great dessert selection  bragged family friends brought family last night  family member said they'd return  expensive mediocre food  Soup barely warm only 3 lettuce salads choose from  Pasta bar ok  Meat seafood selection average! I'd recommend Buffet Orleans instead Bellagio! <EOR> The best buffet ever Vegas far! 3rd every vist lol came lunch friday afternoon $21 99 per person bad   The kobe beef mini burgers def highlight yummy   they lot high end food    think lunch perfect time because large range foods fit breakfast lunch come wakes breakfast when Vegas! lol   I def back back back D <EOR> Great variety!

The only thing didn't care much loooong wait come 1 hour but must say worth it! <EOR> Okay second time Buffet  first time really impressed food delicious such big variety  dessert buffet! best   So decided come back 3 weeks later family  Wednesday night wasn't big line top busy   The food again delicious but service worst  3 adults kid ordered drinks 3 adults but seemed 2 drinks problem giving them us  waitress seemed more more angry did smile talk back when asked bring drinks  1 45 hours she said couldn't more drinks go  WHAT  Okay receipt says would if people would stay no longer 2 hours but just asked last drink  Well she came back said last one  then drinks bugs ice cubes  BUGS  gross  talked manager she apologized money back 1 unlimited drinks around $13     I am never coming back good food but never bad bad service BUGS ice cubes  EWW <EOR> I lunch buffet far best buffet Vegas date travelled quite often   choices lunch time bit overwhelming full breakfast choices omlette station sushi bar meat carving station pastas deserts list on  only dissappointment could eat more   Best $20 buffet variety Strip  <EOR> A friend mine getting married Vegas Halloween felt good enough excuse Vegas   Months before trip researching reading tons reviews different restaurants bars  know wanted least buffet most part internets told Bellagio Buffet    Me boyfriend Saturday night pretty disappointing    First wait twenty minutes  long wait but when finally seated passed probably abut 20 empty tables  sure if being under staffed if them saving tables 'invited guests' but felt twenty minute wait unnecessary    Then getting through buffet line hassle itself  wasn't lot open space between dessert island actual buffet  herd cattle trying way food  layout buffet good just needs more spread out   And then there's issue carving stations  think reasons why buffet area congested  people handling carving stations half assing it  weren't working diligently help people  would carve some meat someone then walk away  would handling two different carving stations  Once again sure if understaffed but 6 pm Saturday  Buffet should know expect lot people during time should plan staff accordingly    I willing ignore wait layout buffet because felt food would wait  Wrong    First really excited try Kobe Beef  never it  first thing got  bring back table only knife lousy butter knife  look steak knife didn't any  ever tried cut steak butter knife? Butter knives meant steak hence called butter knives steak knives    Anyway    determined try kobe beef battled butter knife  Wikipedia says Kobe beef refers meat generally considered delicacy renowned its flavour tenderness fatty well marbled texture  Bellagio however meat really tough  struggled butter knife cut piece flesh when eating felt eating warmed raw meat  tender all chew lot  Maybe food retarded but didn't think meat anything praise  didn't even finish it   Next tried prime rib  love good prime rib  prime rib Bellagio Buffet very fatty very generic far buffets go  still ate because prime rib   but still ehhhhh  better prime rib Ellis Island    I some other assorted food all very meh  Yes all eat crab legs but cold hardly any meat each leg  Yes cold shrimp but anywhere    The desserts weren't great either  another thing looking forward to  drooling over yelp pictures weeks before Vegas however when finally buffet felt wasn't much selection saw pictures yelp   Anyway buffet average  should probably ten dollars cheaper  If want good quality  food might well regular restaurant same price    I returning  <EOR> Very disappointing  Expensive nothing special  While did caviar something haven't found elsewhere nothing else impressed us  Also service subpar  only waiter unattentive lead hostess making snide remarks guests when needed service asked help other servers simply said cannot help  section   coming back ever again especially having paid over $90 2 people  <EOR> The Bellagio Buffet isn't bad but isn't spectacular either  If Vegas time buffet Bacchanal  expected more Las Vegas buffet Bellagio but could also ate Bacchanal yesterday became somewhat jaded Vegas buffets   ate Sunday brunch which priced reasonable $30 per person would extra   arrived 1pm wait time 20 25mins beginning line being sat table   waitress came over served coffee orange juice water   selection probably third available bacchanal 15 breakfast items eggs omelet station bacon turkey sausage   food good quality but seemed taste flavor lacking  lunch dinner selection consisted prime rib pizza bland pasta marinara among other things   also salad station sushi station table full shrimp packed ice   desert spread average some soft serve ice cream sorbet cookies some ecclairs bread pudding   Overall would recommend Bellagio Buffet but second Bacchanal  <EOR> I would probably give 3 5 but rounding because great service good food despite being little pricey   Lots stuff very good  prime rib roasted chicken turkey blue nose that label    does mean ate dolphin?

Omelette station safe option but long lines order  omelette holiday inn too    French Toast dry eggy  No flavor  Beef Ribs outside burned inside raw  also chewy instead soft   Mussels moment put mouth knew if swallow gonna sick next two days  bad fish smells was  never spit food first!

Come early don't expect service! <EOR> I would love give place 5 stars but lack green bean casserole kept happening    The arrogance planning buffet most apparent void having green bean casserole   One year thanksgiving mother attempted grandpas famous recipe failed miserably   She drinking since four am ash rested top over boiling gravy least two packs stress induced cigarettes she smoked while trying dinner 14 short notice   While she isnt much chef people clearly why couldn't perfect serve such simple dish?  Get your shizz together maybe next time all stars deserve! <EOR> Wow just unbelievably mediocre buffet  used love buffet now completely down hill  Everything tastes came $8 all eat strip mall buffet  <EOR> Waiting looooooooong time holiday meal terrible experience Christmas night food good expected! <EOR> I ate twice latest trip Vegas   The first time bridesmaids fiancée did breakfast day wedding  service time amazing! very attentive drink server food absolutely delicious  price breakfast isn't bad either  $60ish three wait wasn't long all    The second time brunch following day group 10 just some friends family wanted together good food  First off lady seating wasn't very pleasant  She very confused party size acted never happens  She kept saying 4 table 4 another she didn't speak very good English trying explain math included only 8 when party 10 another ordeal  She very concerned 18% gratuity larger groups when already said wasn't issue  already waiting 40 minutes while she ran around confused inspected tickets in  She left 10th party member behind rope because she clearly couldn't count ten most time  When finally seated server very nice attentive  The food good but delicious breakfast  probably wouldn't brunch again  party larger 4 but lot buffet choices strip probably wouldn't again all  <EOR> I've two Buffet Places Vegas  say Wicked Spoon much better  Salad choices limited but tastes good  best thing place Pizzas! tried three different flavors all amazingly delicious!

<EOR> This second time going gotta say all food only okay  still great breakfast good service provided good selection but wasn't good first time years ago  bummed don't king crab claws anymore <EOR> The best buffet Las Vegas strip hands down   Although relatively expensive buffets Vegas quality top notch Bellagio Buffet   agog when saw lovely delicate sweets available along crab legs sushi filets etc   variety quality fantastic here   Everything very fresh well nothing looked sitting even comfortable sushi     If center strip area would highly recommend going buffet above all others  <EOR> Very good Sunday champagne brunch but somehow quite impressive expected $28 95 based its reputation   Maybe just kind over whole buffet abundance thing guess almost everywhere decent Vegas expensive now     The pros Good omelette bar fresh ingredients   Very tasty desserts   Exceptionally friendly attentive table service  which rare buffets  always making sure coffee water juice champagne dutifully refilled   let relax stay forever without feeling rushed     The cons Rather limited seafood department   Somewhere I'd heard sushi brunch but California vegetable spicy tuna rolls hardly count you those self serve deli any decent supermarket    piece grilled swordfish bit into overcooked literally could chew avoided rest   All all very pleasant experience   Still good enough 3 stars while most buffets aren't  <EOR> Cheapest bottomless brunch strip   Wonderful experience  Great food  waiter made sure glasses never saw bottom  Highly recommend  <EOR> If very hungry try buffet   starving just checked into Hotel found Buffet answer stomach's prayers We seated Bar due opening did wait hour   bar tender Georgie fun loved job kept glasses full   highlight bluenose fish rice shrimp sauteed peppers all all delicious   husband carnivore loved beef wellington   disappointed crab legs frozen   would recommend getting line alittle early rush sit bar did   Outstanding buffet!! <EOR> After all hype raves say Bellagio dinner buffet first meal Vegas big disappointment   felt food selection little weak flavors quality low end scale   only thing made lack good hot food amazing dessert bar which featured some insanely good desserts   Honestly can't remember much because most tended over cooked   only thing really good fresh lamb beef gyros which carved straight off rotating vertical spit   Unfortunately meat ready only every 10 15 minutes an eternity buffet wasn't much each time carved it   fast meat would run out   Extra points having mini pitas full bar condiments such sliced tomatoes lettuce tzatziki crumbled feta cheese   also appreciated sushi bar which tuna poke tuna sashimi which fresh very good       Bellagio's carving station offered large variety meats standard prime rib lamb more exotic fare such bison beef wellington which later turned into chicken wellington   tried prime rib bison beef wellington all which lacking flavor   prime rib tad overdone even center seasoning which made good tasting crust didn't penetrate center meat   bison beef wellington both tough over cooked   first time trying bison while think potential just tough enjoy   Likewise beef wellington which good pastry crust dry   And now desserts which all delicious   creme brulee which 3 yes know pig came perfectly crisp carmelized crust which delighted cracking spoon   Delicious   Next key lime pie deliciously tart smooth   Likewise lemon meringue pie amazing nicely browned meringue top   other desserts well all which good presumably because man behind Jean Philippe Patisserie overseeing all desserts Bellagio   All all okay buffet   desserts outstanding but other foods disappointment   If eat $35+ worth pastries perhaps nibbles sushi gyro cocktail shrimp pasta then Bellagio place go   Otherwise more complete overall Vegas buffet experience would head Wynn Paris Mandalay Bay  <EOR> Quality buffet reasonable price  Lots desert selections  Selection good Mirage but quality little bit better  <EOR> Very disappointing!!!!! food selection small especially sushi station  Only California rolls some simple sushi available  dessert selection sad  service good all  lady stayed sushi station basically just threw spring rolls plate!!! heard much buffet really expecting good time  Turned truly disappointing  <EOR> To tell truth never really enjoy buffets   usually find food stale flavorless loaded salt sugar   typically feel terrible afterwards!  Not Bellagio!  Sure price steep but well worth it   found food fresh wide variety   sushi station chinese station actual seafood   Friday night dinner three types crab leg shrimp can tell seafood    service quick food hot everything refilled timely manner   Dessert good but didn't blow mind   meat great too   several different types beef all cooked differently   Alcohol included meal but soft drinks are   think $45 pp   We arrived earlier side maybe 5 pm wait 15 minutes in   When left dinner line obnoxiously long   suggest getting before your typical dinner time decrease your wait time     I didn't try any other buffets but looked others   Harrah's hotel example buffett much cheaper but offerings lacked variety wasn't ton offered   decided skip headed Bellagio instead  <EOR> Our family checked into NYNY gave two vouchers buffets $30 off each nearby hotels   chose Bellagio because seafood offering    family four even vouchers still cost $70 + tip   prime rib good did good variety seafood but just OK   sushi definitely just buffet quality nothing special very limited choice  server whole section slow dishes bussed waters refilled    All all just OK dining experience left feeling stuffed overeating course   good value paid but without vouchers would again  <EOR> I'm going give 3 stars     Great selection though Ostrich duck lamb sea bass swordfish sushi prime rib shrimp king crab snow crab beef wellington    etc    definitely gourmet buffet saturday night!

It's worth if isn't line stick good stuff  <EOR> Ate Monday evening   lot selections   Paella very bland   King crab legs tiny only available cold   Snow crab legs warm but those soaked long water tasted sterile   sushi station Marty's caviar salmon tuna   Decent selection dessert including panna cotta few ice cream sorbet flavors fruits   No leche flan  <EOR> I watching O show even though just hour left  items normal but quality under estimation  dont really agree deserve  <EOR> I very disappointed food very salt crab legs very small place sucked <EOR> So disappointed  winding road food court quality eats worth remembering  Asian section Sushi rice balls made machine = hard lumps cold rice dry limp noodles  Seafood section small crab legs cocktail shrimp nothing special  Italian section some dishes ok still Olive Garden best  day also some exotic meats elk ostrich cooked well but weren't exciting    Did back seconds all since nothing good enough repeat  Saved appetite desserts which actually good  But never back again  Thanks Bellagio! <EOR> Our server Gilbert fantastic! If ever back buffet would ask each time however quality food very disappointing  pumped left feeling irritated price paid  prime rib gray dry crab legs cold over cooked  BBQ chicken overwhelming taste liquid smoke fish lacked seasoning  salad ok  desserts yummy  bottomless drinks always filled  Thank goodness some best customer service around because helped celebration dinner total let down  <EOR> Large variety     Duck good    Crab legs pre cut but cold best taste   Shrimp wonderful!  Cooked perfectly   Stuffed veal excellent stuffing but little overcooked   Lobster ravioli bland  Salmon nigiri     picked salmon off top  Some pieces soft fresh while others blah    All desserts good!  Probably best part meal  many wonderful choices!!!  made joke saying next time back only having desserts!!  The food seemed little average but guess variety   desserts delicious tho!!! <EOR> I did research yelp vegas buffets prior arrival   Since stayed MGM thought I'd give Buffet Bellagio try     i tuesday no wait   3pm lunch price other yelpers suggested ate lunch dinner food   only difference between lunch dinner offered sashimi instead flank steak prime ribs   Big whoop     Most yelpers said best buffets Vegas   started eating while wondered if actually into right hotel      think Bellagio bigger nicer hotels yet fail even sushi wow sucks   super generic sushi even worse ones Safeway   Heck even friends better sushi that!!   The flank steak chewy heck   leg lamb tasted more duck   only buffet few days ago can't even remember ate because nothing stood out!!!

If free might   But likely wouldn't pay $20 per person  <EOR> The food ok desserts ok   Nothing great didn't walk saying ok worth money! <EOR> Our first day hotel little late didn't any idea where go  decided Buffett  all ant didn't seam bad all food get  crab legs prime rib  joked told wife where else crab legs tacos plate   place  Also kid liked deserts ice cream  all all win family  food good quality your typical bland Buffett food  <EOR> The Bellagio A List rapper everything does does big buffet no exception  visiting 10 buffets Vegas finally ponied money visit Bellagio   Despite seemingly endless line waited best buffet sin city offer  visited during late breakfast hour pleased find some lunch foods including salad which favorite sure why  also some pad thai breakfast tacos eggs benedict omelette stations that's right multiple omelettes more   Their breakfast meats impressive  Seriously  blush  just sausage either  Even ham chunks impressive  price wasn't bad either  think $21 tip   Bonus $10 all drink buying buffet  But prefer only stay two hours   $30 per person but if really want drunk might your place  all bucket beer $25 even middle road hotels  <EOR> We terrible experience here  food way salty smelled weird  Even mashed potatoes hard eat  whole family only served themselves once lost appetite  coming back  <EOR> this far best AYCE buffet las vegas   i just top buffets strip none them comes close bellagio  only buffet tops bellagio infamous ballys sterling brunch which only served sundays   quality product fresh good the price very reasonable service good well being buffet   i always visit bellagio buffet when come visit!  never ever dissapoints me! keep good work boys!!! <EOR> Excellent buffet! 2 30pm able pay lunch prices dinner  meat selection excellent  kobe beef roast delicious  long lines meat table but didn't wait long  services excellent  drinks filled constantly  definitely worth going again  actually buffet Wynn next day say buffet Bellagio definitely lot better  <EOR> Solid 3 5 stars  We came lunch Friday around 1pm waited 20 minutes  service decent considering buffet    Hmm wasn't very impressed meat station  Everything just okay  The desserts also alright  think only thing memorable worth mentioning pasta  don't know if just but feel Vegas buffets downgraded  <EOR> Would come again probably unless group people wanted try out  service good never dirty plate table  food mediocre good depending got  few pastas bomb grilled salmon pretty tasty  Other pretty much your basic food found buffet  Oh prime rib good honey carrots tasty!! <EOR> Sorry Bellagio  no longer best buffet Vegas offer   While still enjoy caving station seafood selection weekend holiday gourmet dinners hardly worth price  prime rib good crab legs enjoyable buffet standard  Other nothing really stood out  cooked food selection remained pretty much same over years offered very little excitement repeat customers  Quality average definitely does compare newer buffets Wynn Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon    Is imagination desserts really aren't good anymore? Dessert used only reason still back Bellagio buffet  time around lot desserts tried seemed sat while  Creme brulee no longer chilled turned slightly watery  Chocolate eclair crispy  Many tart shells soggy  only dessert still good bread pudding which kept warm   Best deal lunch buffet  However price would much rather Wicked Spoon  won't disappointed there  <EOR> Haven't tried all buffet vegas but rather satisfied bellagio buffet  Showed 7 Tuesday but still wait 25 min seated  Waiter came right away brought drinks kept taking dirty plate away  Plenty dishes nothing extraordinary but all decent  recommend  <EOR> For buffet delighted   We didn't stand line long  paid $41 pop  tried fill apps entrees desserts etc  Dessert first! You'd think it'd terrible most buffets but carrot cake surprisingly delicious moist  brownie also surprisingly good  entrees   meats   how try them? okay good  prime rib rack lamb wagyu beef   Good but no stars  lobster mac n cheese satisfying albeit bit runny    In sum if come right expectations satisfied  hungry couldn't into any fancy restaurants nearby they all booked over july 4th weekend did mention hungry? <EOR> My best advice approaching Bellagio buffet breakfast brunch time  Show around 10 10 30  Gives enough time sample some breakfast food pretty quickly changeover lunch when bring some great savory options  Skip breakfast pastry bar  Middling quality really just stomach filler  Top items spicy tuna hand rolls made offer comes noon shrimp fresh rolls grapefruit kale salad  Unsurprisingly put case staffed server rather being open grabs  Runner ups seafood ceviche scallops mangos roast lamb pesto mashed potatoes smoked salmon broccolini everyone says crab legs fresh delicious  come 11 if you're first display some very large sized claws  You mix items different stations new creations build your own sundae bread pudding caramelized peaches soft serve vanilla bean custard soft serve peach sorbet  Nom! Most bite sized pastries only okay  passion fruit guava tartlet chocolate crunches top diamond rough! <EOR> In comparison other Buffets strip buffet Bellagio falls short selection quality  <EOR> Food really good especially near Christmas!  But first great customer service   special needs son wait going two hours   spoke service people manager speak me   He able head line discount him   person Marianna charge line extremely nice brought tears eyes   Anyway try crab legs shrimp cocktail better Bacchanal duck breast grilled duck legs course goose   great grilled lamb chops prime rib sushi   Selection vast Bacchanal but lot cheaper found son likes chicken mole sauce   Really really good grilled sea bass   The Kobe beef but other meats it   Desserts OK but fresh fruit excellent   They free beer wine glass   Will back  <EOR> Bomb com great   am fan line though   need better job moving line    Customer service does still matter <EOR> Went over holiday weekend  Unfortunately meant prices higher but seemed try bring best time too   They advertised Kobe steak bar which hit first stop excited but unfortunately must good cut kobe beef  First all kobe beef ny strip steaks  You're probably looking $90+ 12 oz steak  Whatever serving no marbling fat throughout meat dry over cooked  Unfortunately steak shadowed flank steak which much better prepared more flavorful   Anyway also king crab legs snow crab legs rack lamb chilean sea bass name few other favorites  Overall food quality good variety buffet offers definitely appropriate amount pay  might add might want stay away sushi bar though really only part I'd say wasn't very good   My only advice definitely want save room dessert  good food I'd say dessert even better  <EOR> Champagne brunch Bellagio Sundays = pretty fantastic! Don't plan doing anything afterwards because amount mimosas you'll consumed they keep them coming you'll need nap brunch  3 times now food always excellent  breakfast lunch foods food nicely varied  dessert bar could give anyone sweet tooth or diabetes salad bar look super fresh  yourself favor just once say you've gone  <EOR> This most over priced buffet eaten long time  Indian casino's Inland Empire better then this  selection good but quality stinks    I thought nothing but wasted calories huge eater  sin  <EOR> Overwhelming amount choices  dinner Thursday night felt much choose from  Everything good too    House made sausages point  Turkey moist  Salad bar build your own lots toppings  Pesto mash sweet potato mash great  Pizza amazing especially buffet  Could eaten $35 worth alone  Made order taco station which full try because loaded amazing chicken Marsala  Tons bread choices all looked amazing but resisted because didn't want load cheap carbs   Try mac cheese  brother loved but personally thought tasted noodles smothered melt your mouth butter  Didn't enough cheese feeling butter   The desserts very average Vegas buffets  Soft serve machine ice cream  Cold creme brulee  pecan tart tasted very box  best white chocolate nutella cone which worth getting few of    The main choices amazing though forget desserts  Sit back load even if just pizza  <EOR> To surprise place good  Food soups cold  Entrees looked sitting long periods time  love trying different buffets returning one  <EOR> One better buffets Vegas  ate Buffet Bellagio every day breakfast recent Vegas trip  highlight buffet all choices brunch  really enjoyed prime rib great flavor  better then most other buffets eaten at  shrimp also very good  pizza wasn't bad buffet pizza  also great selection desserts nice self serve ice cream machine  bunch drink stations Coke Freestyle machines which because didn't wait someone fill drink  also very good getting dirty plates cleared   Overall great buffet but quite good Cosmo which opinion still sets bar Vegas Buffets  <EOR> Well     Where start?  I did lot buffet research prior Vegas trip   narrowed short list down Studio B M Resort Bacchanal Buffet Caesar's Palace Bellagio Buffet   We during lunch time visited each them asked walk through     If really seafood variety weird things     would Bacchanal Buffet   If want value don't mind driving Strip would Studio B buffet M Resort   really liked buffet low prices but wasn't quite expectations really nice buffet!  The Bellagio Buffet exceeded expectations   arrived 3 PM left 5 30 enjoyed leisurely meal each other all food outstanding   atmosphere made difference between other two buffets considering   Even silverware top quality!  relatively quiet food very fresh   lot variety meats salmon Asian desserts Mexican breads salads much more!  I definitely back visit next trip! <EOR> My friend Vegas weekend when he uploaded picture buffet knew come next time LV  reading reviews someone said come right before dinner time pay lunch price but eat dinner  right  only problem should come 45 minutes before dinner starts cause wait line going long  Since buffet knew I'd bloated wore skirt loose top hide food baby  = <EOR> I told best buffet Vegas don't see anywhere else compete   everything snow crab king crab steak prime rib shrimp all other typical buffet foods   More expensive side but if Vegas   All crab ate must worth much normal restaurant     What say when John Wall chillin right outside must good   Everything tasty very flavorful   Definitely going back next time Vegas  <EOR> For context normally buffets  AYCE offerings never really selling point either  All else being equal don't even having meal same hotel staying at  natural inclination bit   Yet all preconceived strikes against least terms personal preferences still loved brunch Bellagio's buffet    Good orange juice  Good omelette station  Attentive service  only legitimate downside steep holiday weekend surcharge over $30 per person brunch during Labor Day weekend  <EOR> We extremely disappointed visit Wednesday morning  visitors selected Bellagio based Yelp ratings which proved woefully inaccurate   breakfast but pay holiday brunch rate   first visit unimpressed surroundings process compared Wynn Caesars similar pricing  Remarkably counter some reviews most saddening aspect quality food   Roast beef cold crab legs very small worth effort but also markedly old shrimp mealy California roles chewy even sides seemed less appealing   Cleanliness always challenging massive crowd but sample ice cream machine drink stations mess ladies room inside buffet MGM standards   Seemed abundance people wearing name tags managers? floating thru but didn't witness any positive effect   Given configuration food lines staff struggle guests maintain stations  Sorry never again  <EOR> This buffet favorite Las Vegas until recent visit   Now s just worth price   quality fallen while price risen   Apparently economy taken toll  <EOR> Where start eggs Benedict Kobe beef st Louis ribs tortellini Sliders bread pudding sushi dessert bar mussels omg!! <EOR> We Bellagio recommendation friend    pleasantly surprised find lunch buffet less $30   Let tell worth it!!!  Anything could think of   they had    enjoyed fact could breakfast dinner or both if me   lol     Great Flank steak potatoes    made order omlettes   you wrong place    must add   they also all ou drink alcoholic beverages $13   Definitely better values strip! <EOR> I can't give more star because price high nothing! First all charge full price kids understand he 14 but little she's 9  crazy! Second one the food absolutely good all even dish good    Maybe just chicken noodle soup    But believe 36$ chicken soup tooooo much! recommend it!!!  It's expected Bellagio <EOR> My husband kids love come every once while because think best buffets Las Vegas  definitely can't wrong champagne brunch    I haven't tried everything offer because never eat much food  Buffets usually waste money because can't eat much    The food tried great though  breakfast scrambled eggs sausage bacon French toast pancakes all delicious  desserts also fantastic! tried few bites husbands prime rib which wasn't best tried  also tried some polenta which awesome flavor! tasted cooked chicken broth  couldn't stop eating it  champagne bit harsh but think because cheap champagne lol  sushi really yummy but only two rolls choose California rolls vegetable rolls  crab legs pretty good well but chilled mine hot    Overall great buffet if want wait huge lineup  always two hour wait when there  Definitely try though! <EOR> Went Bellagio Buffet last week when few friends came town  buffet dinner glad wasn't disappointed   value buffet eater   sit eat 3 4 plates crab legs before move Prime Rib  = crab legs delicious fresh   prime rib soft tender melted mouth pretty good buffet   did try few other things above average but can't remember them right now   desserts pretty good   gf big sweet tooth she grabbed each most pretty good   especially liked creme brulee chocolate peanut butter bar guess its called   Overall back again  <EOR> Such disappointment price Paid almost $60 dinner during holidays 2 hour wait   only way front line pay $20 way expensive  First all sat first while friends still paying hostess said would tell them where paid   waiting 10 minutes friends phone call friend saying seated somewhere else other side buffet  Unorganized just there     I being turned away Bacchanal Buffet Caesars palace because weren't taking any more people   If your first Vegas buffet probably would impressed because lot food   However if you've Bacchanal Buffet place rip off especially dessert section  big sweet tooth love going Vegas Buffets specifically dessert  don't know if came bad day but barely any dessert choices   no gelato crepes ran macarons  weren't even any strawberries   only some pastries cakes soft serve think best thing creme brulee   $50 expect feast definitely did that   only thing worth Prime Rib which delicious but can't over fact dessert good all  waiters friendly though but being nicest hotels Vegas sure hope improve future  <EOR> Overall 3 5 Food 3 5 Service 3  Tip right before lunch over lunch over 4pm head around 3 45pm lunch pricing then wait food switch over dinner before gorging   Lunch price $10 cheaper weekdays Sun Thur $17 cheaper weekends Fri Sat compared dinner pricing   Food good   Kind expected more but bad buffet    Selection good  Nothing really stood amazing but enjoyed following st  louis style ribs prime rib quail baked sea bass buffalo popcorn shrimp  Desserts ok   Pretty stuffed point probably affected enjoyment factor   Seemed pretty standard buffet items creme brulee flan cheesecake fruit tarts etc  Service decent   Waitress forgot take drink orders when seated but otherwise bad experience   Remember wear stretchy pants bite two everything becomes whole lot food quickly  <EOR> Despite all empty tables seen picture somehow restaurant managed drag 35 minutes painfully slow waiting line  How? possible? No apology end line when colleague pointed empty tables inside attendant tried remonstrate rather apologise profusely  Good beef salad  rest food ok but unfortunately entire experience ruined 10 minutes unnecessary line let alone 35   demonstrate no regard whatsoever time customers  Efficient management required urgently here  <EOR> $40 head including tax  Unlimited non alcoholic drinks  sections buffet categorized cuisine type Japanese seafood Mediterranean Italian Chinese continental bread breakfast dessert   The crab legs seemed biggest hit but favorites everything tried Japanese black seaweed salad beef wellington  chocolate parfait dessert really good too  friend through three plates food piece split dessert  Mmmm banana fosters   I suggest making lap around first devising game want most  Then categorize your plates cuisine avoiding mixing Italian Chinese   much tried downsize portions didn't enough space everything   sad didn't chance try prime rib rack lamb breakfast    Nonetheless buffet offered lot high quality food  If look around notice each person serves each station same ethnic background cuisine host   buffet hit spot put into nice food coma  <EOR> Vegas buffets feel contestant Supermarket Sweep http www youtube com watch?v=ZSwmFurzkpQ combing stations most expensive offerings sure biggest bang buck   Luckily first trip Bellagio Buffet early east coast flight Vegas 12PM Vegas time but 3PM body clock   Having eaten anything besides some Delta provided cookies decided use buffet catch breakfast lunch   Here's Breakfast Fantastic pancakes thick cut bacon   Better most when brunch   French toast thick but bland   Cheese blintzes good but better strawberry sauce top them   Lunch Very good prime rib leg lamb carving station   Asked medium rare medium rare   rubs each very flavorful   Cocktail shrimp nice plump   Tried few vegetables Singapore noodels just so so   I disappointed weren't any crab legs something else cut above norm steak lobster etc   Dessert Yeah still room   Liked sundae station ground Butterfingers topping plus    fruit tart tried average but chocolate chip cookie very good   All all step above other buffets had   earned $26 worth   Worthy choice 1 2 meal sitting  <EOR> I agree back day place nothing ever seen absolutely crazy good   Now just little different maybe  problem   Vegas changed changed again but buffet much   HOWEVER still think best buffet all wynn sucks!

So many different types food! Everything tried delicious even great fruit dessert bar  If choose last meal life I'd choose here  <EOR> One favorite buffets Vegas aside Wynn   decor nice food even better   desserts ridiculously good but don't expect big dessert selection during breakfast   best time around 10 30 right before bring lunch items   aware though if you're during holiday weekend prices higher usual   However Bellagio sure your money's worth   last holiday weekend offered beef wellington 4 different kinds macarons lamb way many other things name   won't quality food anywhere strip price! <EOR> I buffet lunch Friday wasn't busy  server think Alfredo very attentive never let drinks empty   Plates also never sat table creating clutter   The food excellent!!  Salad bar little small but all excellent entree choices didn't bother all   Shrimp cocktail available delicious   The salmon bursting flavor very fresh All selections tasted fresh full flavor unlike other buffets encountered  Trays constantly being switched fresh options  While plenty choices disappointed variety sushi which only contained California rolls veggie roll  dessert bar also little flat  ice cream amazing all desserts beautiful flavor appetizing designs  expecting more intricate desserts buffet due food being offered   All all AMAZING far best buffet Vegas would definitely back recommend anyone  <EOR> Buffet menu course downgraded bad  Sushi bar really nothing Crabs even fresh? Where's lobsters? Gone?  I used love buffet place now within many downgraded cheapo! <EOR> It's totally worth long line price! Loved pesto mashed potatoes!  Wow wow wow <EOR> This kid weird b c fan buffets all  ate when first opened but recently returned another vegas trip know pretty good  liked variety food lot buffets end tasting same while  actually case quite few things found good  liked crab legs rack lamb spicy tuna hand rolls awesome  don't spend lot time desserts but some friends thought adequate  also did crepes chicken mushroom also worth noting  wish could tried more but tried over indulge due dieting but wish wasn't  <EOR> This definitely favorite high class buffet when Vegas  would describe best far buffets Wynn close 2nd    When eat crazy King Crab Legs  Just eating few babies there's your money back already = If no big pieces left just wait few minutes because always replenish supply every now then    Also very wide range premium sushi here  hand rolls rolls seaweed cone regular sushi  Salmon pieces sushi very very fresh just eat Salmon throw rice away  Shiet wasting stomach rice  haha  only during holiday season tend rack prices federal holidays  But still place gets vote best buffet Vegas  Lines quite long try around 5 30pm dinner time  <EOR> For Vegas 1st time visitors must  once each dinner brunch  never left disappointed  line intimidating but well worth wait   For dinner prime rib awesome  3 servings  lamb good but still worth trying  Most meats always cooked well carvers serve generous portions   Cocktail shrimp salmon sushi good  Sometimes watch when fresh sushi comes because sit become room temperature   The chicken noodle soup average  Probably only negatives items   On breakfast side bacon eggs eggs benedict great  sausage pretty good but still prefer bacon  Waffles hard but great variety them offered good samples  late during brunch some breakfast removed can't say much more breakfast   Too many desserts try flan if sweet caramel ice cream  Bread pudding some ice cream does trick quite well  Grab some fresh fruit strawberries bananas etc etc  Orange juice lemonade tastes fresh possibly home made and or freshly squeezed   Service better normal buffet service quick clear off plates  1st 2 3 rounds beverages fast but then things slow bit   As someone else mentioned just much good food enjoy all 1 sitting  <EOR> Reminded large Sizzler  Totally lacking food taste presentation  buffets Wynn M Resort much better    Shame because rest Bellagio offer top notch  <EOR> Large selection very nice display  food very good overall service   scrambled eggs little watery which flaw noticed  But outside food fresh very good  amount options price extremely reasonable  <EOR> One favorite buffets Vegas    awesome goodness  This place opinon BETTER Wynn buffet because only does offer wider selection food also few bucks cheaper Wynn   Yes there's always long line but expect? Bellagio Buffet crying loud!   If you're ever Saturday lunch I'd recommend come around 3pm a late lunch pay lunch price stay until dinner  Dinner served 4pm way pay $25 instead $32 33 seafood dinner!!  I love dessert selection   the sugar free strawberry cheesecake DIE for   nomnomnom  Highly recommended! <EOR> My first impression price tag $42+ +tip person buffet   Tables clean carpets clean service fair far getting drinks refilled except drink refilled diet root beer instead regular    One generally stays away sushi buffet but decided try it   Good decision   sushi very good   steamed crab legs already split ease getting meat however time back table crab legs lukewarm cool   littleneck clams pretty good well   I some folks buffet gorge themselves am just those people   price worth perceived value   such am fan but thought okay  <EOR> I love Bellagio buffet  favorites Vegas hands down  around 10 30 during week breakfast price but they'll switching over lunch foods  brunch weekends fantastic too  love thanksgiving type foods mashed yams red cabbage  prime rib point love seafood  Oh gluten free desserts too!!

Overall would prefer trying bacchanal wicked spoon just because crab legs aren't good enough alone pay price  just big seafood  also good chicken tikka masala! But didn't provide any naan which kinda disappointing  Also bellagio good pasta  <EOR> I prefer Wynn but both probably among best Las Vegas   Maybe constant refilling crab legs when dinner once time chef cooking omelette calling sir carefully using spatula sure every corner egg cooked evenly   bit line little bit more others Strip but little details all difference  <EOR> Oh Bellagio become once great buffet your heyday? miss very much  bragged years man only sorely disappointed when finally made it  cocktail shrimp some nasty mush consistency almost water logged Atlantis  obviously due presentation melted crushed ice but why sacrifice shrimp? Why? Don't even started mini dry burgers pathetic sushi pizza ish  lamb ok maybe just beaten down previous mentioned choices  antipasto bar olive bread brie while good just wasn't enough sustain cost  Very disappointed won't back  say Hello Wicked Spoon?

 consensus among family everyone very happy Bellagio   back here   Forget Cravings  <EOR> I tried buffet Wynn first before Bellagio   buffet definitely GREAT buffet if compare other restaurants across America   but time we're comparing Vegas standards   think buffet Wynn lot better much better ambiance Bellagio   Since gave Wynn 5 stars then give Bellagio 4 stars   lunch selection great should during dinner time     Bellagio needs invest some money making restaurant brighter maybe even new facelift   just looks old   But nonetheless still pretty good buffet  <EOR> We Father's Day brunch super disappointed   more expensive because holiday menu food purely mediocre   selection grand other buffets strip  really thought prestige hotel Belagio buffet would supreme  feel pretty upset almost wish could reimbursed least meal two  very upset quality food Father's Day husband  <EOR> Food average  note flavors  Nothing poor nothing great regarding food  Drinks strong when could them  Service negligent nearly non existent  Pray don't Guadalupe your server otherwise elbow deep dirty plateware which reprehensible buffet  Even speaking management situation remained same  Definitely would suggest avoiding buffet  <EOR> I keep short sweet because catch all reviews Vegas trip   The food pretty good price reasonable  falls right middle buffets Vegas quality food   The horrible part wait  never seen line long this! food average above average but line think handing free money show tickets  number times when said pass because line way long  ate time just average  <EOR> I just wanted compare top ranking buffet restaurants Vegas based USA Today's report  decoration buffet restaurant Bellagio impressive ones Caesar Place Wynn  foods however quite par two  cost cheaper too  foods top three ranked buffet restaurants quite similar would trick  If going decoration then Bellagio would you  <EOR> I'm scratching head over include review am drawing blank   The wait 45 minutes Sunday night around 5 30  Once inside didn't thrill seeing all selection  If anything impression wish decided elsewhere  The crab legs huge disappointment  weren't good comparison other buffets had  prime rib little tough side quite lacking flavor    All all idea  would say avoid buffet altogether worth it! <EOR> What happened place?? looking forward place few years but let down quality choices    The line wasn't long wait weekday  <EOR> You wait but worth it   There amazing variety everything prepared well   crab legs thrown into salty boiling water hot already split   Call old fashioned but would prefer cracking them myself   little anybody table didn't general consensus sushi made well since rice kept falling apart   spicy tuna roll good though   Also all several desserts   Most them delicious very cute   Our server great well!  He gave tips maximize stomach space kept hydrated   holiday weekend unfortunately paid higher price normal     However would definitely come back when am Vegas next  <EOR> Expensive but worth it  glad tried infamous Bellagio buffet while Vegas  steak tartar crab legs endless veggie options tons deliciousness reasonable Vegas buffet price!! <EOR> We decided hit place doing reaserch da web rated top 10 buffets Vegas  didnt care price because Vegas celebrate 30th Birthday  dinner around 7 waiting big long line which moved pretty quick  seated food hunting lol  hit sushi rolls section plate full but freshest let tell you  would fall apart just picking rice didnt seem good either  BOOO sushi rolls  back hit meat section  prime rib quail Kobe some sides cant even think being review im just writting when last year  Kobe good should be  NASTY meat  Prime rib also NASTY  only thing good probably quail  Oh desserts just alright  Paying 80 dollas dinner expected wayyyyyy better quality food  Im sure cheaper more better quality buffets Vegas  dont recommend place because ate walking back hotel Aria hotel halway holding yack soon opened room door  YACKED all food ate  GROSS <EOR> I Memorial Day weekend when buffet prices higher  First all paid $50 per person 6 people never such awful buffet price  wasn't selection variety food  sushi awful steak awful  Just everything bad  Bellagio buffet many years remember pretty good  become shockingly bad am very unhappy  place gone downhill big time  <EOR> I've three times each time pleasant experience  food excellent waitstaff tries best keep drinks filled but lot times understaffed extremely busy would wait awhile your water filled  Overall great selection high quality food  am definitely planning come back next time Vegas again  <EOR> not bad but frank buffet meet expectation  buffet some hotel china much better? little disappointed  <EOR> I love good buffet Las Vegas Buffet Bellagio no different  Good quality tasty food  wide selection food  some food see won't see other buffets  definitely selection pastas seafood huge assorted meats  dessert little mini donuts  buffet interior very lovely dine in  bit pricey buffet but you're Las Vegas  prices norm here  Definitely top notch buffet Las Vegas  <EOR> One favorite buffets Vegas  family come once every two years Bellagio never disappoints  hotel reputation being Vegas's classic hotels buffet doesn't stray far image well    The staff kind food delicious  There's something everyone  salads sushi there's bound dozens options you'll crave again again    The price isn't high compared other buffets town  quality service food excellent must if you're Las Vegas! <EOR> My wife came Wednesday evening 5 45pm walked right no line   food station selections little better most buffets to   The flank steak prime rib delicious poke   rice nigiri sushi  could little smaller but  OK   beef roast trying pass off Kobe beef roast just regular roast beef   If real Kobe beef meat would buttery tender no effort cutting chewing   king crab legs great especially when heated!  don't think anyone knew could heated only requesting or other people just liked really cold crab    I look pair chopsticks sushi bar did find any   asked counter person he directed another station where again didn't find any   asked waiter chopsticks he promptly directed sushi bar   busy time he did provide good customer service saying he right back some chopsticks   did finally find chopsticks because previously no cared fill basket up   incident waiter other staff cannot give 5 star rating   work Wynn where customer service everything why no 5th star   Other waiter pretty good keeping beverages filled besides giving regular iced tea refill rather raspberry tea   back?

Thanks Bellagio! <EOR> Terrible food  day before buffet Caesar's amazing time 5 star service   Bellagio buffet poorly designed implemented  food choice limited no hot food   Well let reiterate hot food only mildly warm let steam trick you  king crab legs cold Caesar's where chef boils crab give them right spot    The food tastes cheap low class find local suburban casino  Close frozen sushi only 2 3 choices smoked salmon?!! Which fresh yikes  only thing liked lamb   Service more bus boys much attention patrons    <EOR> I weekday group 5  line pretty long took hour seated  buffet dinner cost $37 82  including tip  looking spend least $40 per person dinner   As far food much selection  whole group actually disbelief see little selection price pay  steak cheesecake good but nothing extraordinary here  top ice cream machine broken which made little sad For $40+ should least free alcohol if food par  find same selections normal buffet end saving $30 person  2 stars waiter excellent  He made experience much better very attentive us  Overall would recommend place probably again <EOR> ate last night  think more food options last time came  some reason remembered loving bit more last time  think station blocked off curtains maybe doing construction   the desserts super cute but sadly wasnt great except chocolate mousse cups cannolis   ice cream machine dipensed but partially melted time table  <EOR> best buffet vegas hands down!  amazing selection much want don't bother any other place  but friday saturday night good dinner since menu changes  amazing stuff ostrich kobe beef not real sadly beef tenderloin duck quail sushi king crab legs etc  lots desserts many choose all good! <EOR> Not worth price  vegetables washed see some dirt it  crabs leg overly salty  value place great  strip guess  plus  food great which quite surprised much charge $41 per person? recommend going Studio B M hotel  <EOR> This place overrated!

Half star even though she forgot water   Prolly ain't coming back though quality quantity food served ain't $25 worthy  <EOR> If need quick food picky breakfast eaters weekday morning you're staying Bellagio may worth your while just buffet  Same food Cafe  $25 per person  Self serve beverages option add endless drinks $15  There's full bar located front center upon entry  offer all standard American breakfast fare plus assorted salads pastries Asian food Mexican food  Many gluten free options well marked such  Some sugar free options well  fine dining there's nothing very exciting but serviceable breakfast option  No line all buffet  Tuesday 0930 but various coffee shops quick breakfast spots long wait  clean  Dirty dishes removed promptly  Food bins platters refreshed often  worth price paid  <EOR> Awesome experience!

Maybe over exaggerating just tad bit but know fact downgraded quality meats crab legs  mean BAD Rio which fact piece $hit!! first started noticing change year half ago?   Warned parents before made yearly trip course right   Then thought well maybe should try again? But same thing  disappointing    did enjoy crab legs much use to  little COLD salty side  prime rib dry full non flavor    Call bias but if your crab legs SUCK suck  mean doesn't want crab legs when Vegas buffet??   HOWEVER crab legs ASIDE food alright  guess best part Bellagio dessert station    Will again? wouldn't chose but would go   just hope surprise kick 3 stars butt    SERIOUSLY BELLAGIO give reason root you  thanks  <EOR> Solid 4 star lunch  Would even back without comps  Food tasty nice selection desserts very good  sure dinners but lunch selection could satisfy most palates  Good selection Italian Asian American foods  worth $20 lunch charge  <EOR> After hearing hubby talk repeatedly much he enjoyed Bellagio Buffet previous visit high hopes experience   honestly bit disappointed!  visited late lunch early dinner Friday   The service fine but overly fantastic   dining room nice but lacked real atmosphere character   Granted am allergic seafood therefore didn't enjoy plentiful crab   But husband family felt better crab legs other buffets   Kobi Steak big disappointment chewy lacked flavor   Overall food ok but weren't any dishes write home about   found other buffets price enjoyed lot more!  highlight banana nutella stuffed french toast!  perfect sweet entree since replicated home because husband loved much   A side note best game plan best food best prices near end lunch shift which usually between 3 00 4 00    don't clear restaurant between lunch dinner shifts prices usually significantly cheaper lunch like $12 less person! example Bellagio 3 30 paid lunch price but then bring dinner entrees starting 4 00   just ate early dinner but since buffet definitely don't hungry later! <EOR> Disappointing  only good thing did wait long table  food very plain basic  Honestly nothing stood did refill clean station often should few food stations scraps dirty  Servers nice but also basic     Another really bad feature bathrooms male only stall line!! buffet doing customers almost crime  Definitely buffet Vegas  <EOR> Meh nothing special  Lots choices but nothing really tasted very well  Sorry Belagio really excited you  <EOR> They only couple good items menu rest pretty much trash <EOR> Note brunch   complaint would limited somewhat standard options partially limited attempt true Italian theme casino   few nice touches but level expects Bellagio   does expect high quality Bellagio food buffet that   times almost forget buffet food   real standouts desserts   normally don't eat buffet desserts   aren't worth calories often bad taste texture   However Bellagio worth saving room   chocolate dome very good   key lime pie good   complaint would don't gelato many other buffets now     Overall better buffets   kills Mirage which mediocre IMHO   However still buffet food   pricy   If you're filling omelet over $30  pricy egg omelet   It's tough score   food 4 stars for buffets but price options 3 stars   Service good which normal    lean towards score 4 bearing mind comparison other buffets town  other restaurants  <EOR> Four words Alaskan King Crab Legs  Nuff said   Pre split unlimited served hot butter really didn't waste time eating much else here   Ask workers heat your crab legs iced buffet line hot water before enjoying!

Overall food Bellagio buffet decent prime rib deserves five stars but sushi only deserves star  service crappy but feel overall experience Bellagio the guest service wasn't great Bellagio but  another review   <EOR> I love Bellagio Buffet  least thought did  last time visited Vegas 5 6 years ago favourite buffet  when decided visit Vegas again put list good eats  boy disappointed  Firstly began new policy charging all customers same price regardless age  Yup your 5 year old barely eats anything pay same price full grown adult! does sense?!!!!  Secondly food choice quality only so  bad but good remembered  perhaps fully price all parties expected more  another buffet following day children pricing exceptional!   So your research maybe check another choice esp  if children your party  worth full price them  <EOR> This buffet great few years ago but looked tired time  Sushi even good selection just okay  Disappointed! <EOR> I took Capitalistic approach previous Yelper decided take three interns mainland China bastion Capitalism Las Vegas where excess best   did fret long lines waiting enter buffet but little hungry long flight wrought delays coming Las Vegas   But Bellagio did disappoint   seafood platters bottomless Alaskan King Crab helpings Prime Rib all delicious nutritous   all passed rice bread loaded beef crab shrimp sashimi   even surprised served Poke here   favorite dessert mini creme brulee treat can't Sorry Twinkie Kid! price four people during dinner $112 well worth it   service exceptionally attentive surprisingly timely   Whenever returned another round epicurean delight plates cleared table   goodness often does happen?

Never going back there  Gonna stick standard wynn instead  <EOR> We ate hours! popped right before lunch hustled when lunch time came around  variety food offered amazing  Omelets made order salmon sushi bar etc  place definitely worth least try  <EOR> To dine buffet Vegas practically necessity good reason  Every casino strip boasts its own extravagant buffet choosing which attend feel impossible!   The Bellagio's version solid contender classic presentation great quality food  delightfully fun Wicked Spoon Cosmo line 7 00pm Wednesday stretched nearly 40 minutes  But once inside perfectly pleased variety taste quality Buffet's options  Personal favorites Kobe beef pesto mashed potatoes shrimp cocktail sushi crab legs prime rib    All all absolutely decadent experience where everything tasted good ended stuffing myself painfully uncomfortable fullness  boyfriend currently mission sample every buffet Vegas rate solid option  only thing missing playfulness fun found other Vegas buffets mainly Wicked Spoon   Bellagio handles things much more serious graceful way  Still good course  but bit more straight laced  <EOR> Rude management  Dark gloomy  Interior needs major upgrade  entrance buffet looks going shootout OK Corral  enough options vegans vegetarians  Dessert undesirable  Took bite few items threw them away  Wasn't worth $50 paid  could easily gone next door Cosmopolitan which 100x better  <EOR> I ate Nov 2009 again earlier year  buffet really gone down hill when use when first opened   The food just okay didnt think shrimp crap legs various meats anything write home about  30$ think would rather eat somewhere else where menu just order few things menu share friends    The dessert ok   I am coming back here  <EOR> We early bird price before 9AM fill breakfast lunch food  excellent variety food quality pretty good overall  cheaper buffets town conveniently located  <EOR> Buffets your best friends your worst enemies  Everything your craving actual restaurant probably good time  much afterwards  But enjoy while lasts  But don't let last long you'll punished gym it   While understand Bellagio world renown hotel arguably top resort Strip don't know if same call Buffet    For don't let long lines deceive into believing you're going eating some luxury food  decor resembles buffet Station Casino   I would give food 4 5 stars  actually pretty nice because still hesitant quality food  Beef Wellington which never seen any other hotel buffet  While certainly unique thing buffet tasted terrible  seafood average above average  crab legs good but even when asked them steam em bit rude did very mediocre job heating them up  Other all your other foods your standard foods find your nearest resort buffet   Service decent  Except all cooks seemed bitter rude old  Maybe explained age but certainly no position blame lack customer service due age  But being hotel part mega resort Bellagio customer service level standards should certainly skies   I paid 88 two because holiday which typical special occasions  But perfectly honest don't see myself coming back full price  Half off would trick though  <EOR> Das beste Buffet Las Vegas! Wir waren zum Mittagsbuffet im Bellagio unter der Woche weil es am Abend doch sehr gefragt ist und man länger anstehen musste  Pro Person zahlten wir 28$ plus Tax im nachhinein sehr günstig für dieses atemberaubende Erlebnis war  Man muss wirklich sagen es gibt dort alles! Von Koberind über Hummer ist dort alles für jede Gaumenfreude gesorgt! Total geflasht waren wir alle dann vom Dessertbuffet siehe Foto ich hab noch nie gut gegessen! Ein absolutes Muss wenn man Las Vegas besucht! ***** <EOR> I lunch weekday no line     Yeah good solid buffet   didn't eat much wanted  think just didn't pace myself very well   But think if hungrier would worth $20 lunch   From remember best items were mountain shrimp cocktail be careful take many tho!  leave room other things! very decent steak ribs smoked salmon scallops  Their Asian selection pretty unimpressive looking both sushi hot Asian Fusion sections but hey didn't come taste delicacies world   came engorge meat seafood  oh yeah dessert!  The dessert section sadly didn't taste good looked   couple items pretty good but most average below average   chocolate dipped strawberries but ran before could any I'd probably come back   But next time want crab legs!!!  P S  Non alcohol drinks free distributed waiter service   If want booze though bar pay extra  <EOR> Oh crab legs!  Pretty sure almost everything think here   Where begin!  Miso soup slightly salty   there tons sushi everywhere fresh veggie rolls   crabs legs already cracked huge pile crab shrimp     All food really good huge variety whether steak lover vegetarian   dessert section huge too!  service great too   Victor waiter he really attentive always glass full whatever drinking plates cleared right away   He also very friendly!  pretty sure ate 10+ pounds food ruined whatever wedding diet going but totally worth would definitely again  <EOR> I found buffet pretty standard  Nothing made spectacular  say prime rib worth couple trips plate  Also all drink 2 hours special $15  limited list drinks mimosas sangria screwdrivers draft beer finish your drink completely before order new hence buying time can't order many  Still worth money though even if only 2 3 since drinks expensive Vegas  <EOR> It decent buffet   many options vegetarians   Lots quality sweets cakes  Long weekend lines ridiculous though  <EOR> To honest wasn't 1st choice buffets try Las Vegas anniversary trip time around    before  wanted try Caesar's buffet but line darn long plus fault going dinner 9 knowing buffets close early  particular night no different  9 waited good 20 minutes panicking would old food  reassured serve past 10  cheap just blow away $ eat old food  only buffet hit just 2 sans kids finally eat peace enjoy it  But fault coming late   With said  liked selection  First saw crab legs but if down more different kinds crab legs better ones salad area! Ahh  good fresh cracked really good butter  cocktail shrimp lamb chop good too  sushi fresh   There wasn't much time dally trying other useless typical buffet stuff frankly Asian cuisine n won ton soup wasn't good all but  ok  Came seafood   I remember desserts divine last time came but bc late hour wasn't much selection left  flan good last lucky get  Otherwise rest so   Yeah wish gelato instead soft serve  Strange don't    Our server nice Asian lady n very kind stopped alot  Told when last calls patient coming late    Just personally wish more time enjoy food instead rushing scarving all down   Did fact unlimited beverages came coffee too    Overall enjoyed it  Crab legs best  If wasn't M Resorts' buffet featuring divine sashimi salad would come back next time <EOR> Easily best buffets Vegas  crab legs KIng crab legs smaller snow crab ones  desert bar vast serve larger variety meats most other buffets  pricey but nicer casinos Vegas expected  <EOR> This top 3 favorite buffets strip  probably buffet most often besides inside M Resort  love crab legs sea bass meats  desserts pretty good too  wish better selection sushi but can't complain other selections great  <EOR> I rate Buffet Bellagio 5 5 stars  frequent visitor Las Vegas Strip am also frequent visitor Bellagio specially Buffet Bellagio  buffet best best without doubt  tried many others nearby don't compare size selection food quality selection service did mention wide range selections? different hotel W**n left buffet hungry due poor selections  nothing eat  assure problem Buffet Bellagio  specially value huge selection Sushi Japanese food  in fact whole pod buffet dedicated this!

No fried chicken but great roast beef brisket wonderful malloreddos pasta dish paid good money night before Julian Serrano's big deal Lago restaurant Bellagio     Huge selection   Nice service   Pricey but heck you're Vegas  <EOR> I Buffet few years back really enjoyed it  pricey buffet though  didn't drink because mimosas expensive hung over anyway  food  loved pasta selection  really good sauces delicious! picky Chinese food  something would eat buffet  crab legs delicious  selection food desserts good overall  <EOR> I asked local where best place eat strip Bellagio buffet top list  Though little pricey food disappointment  staff extremely pleasant helpful  Whenever back Vegas return  <EOR> My husband planned Sunday Brunch but thanks flight being delayed 6 hours settle weekday breakfast instead but weren't disappointed   The selection food amazing  several stations typical breakfast choices toast fruit oatmeal scrambled eggs bacon sausage pancakes some lesser seen items such eggs benedict eggs florentine apple cinnamon crepes cheese blintzes  omelette station asian station featuring curried duck singapore noodles some other choices not really choice breakfast pizza station much more   pastries amazing croissants melt in your mouth good! $15 person great deal  Though couldn't quite understand why couple sitting next paid all money just couple bowls fruit  <EOR> Lackluster food ridiculous overcharging!  dined Bellagio Buffet first time Monday safely say return  First off only reason chose buffet over all others because staying Bellagio convenient price $34 99 seemed reasonable  imagine surprise when lined pay told holiday price $9 per person more!  holiday??  Mexican Independence Day!!!  Now don't wrong think marvelous Mexico gained independence Spain September 15th 1810 but possible connection does price food Las Vegas buffet?  Did colorful piñatas? No  Did lovely assortment traditional Mexican foods desserts honor occasion? No   Did pass cute little sombreros offer half price margaritas? No  only way chose observe Mexican Independence Day act banditos charge customers more same tired buffet food offered anywhere strip  No Bueno  <EOR> We came Thursday evening    course near closing time timing off watching GSW MGM catching glimpse Bellagio Fountains  40 minutes eat outta here   cutoff 10 20 p m    Food = delicious!    Highlights Chilean sea bass miso sauce osso bucco pork Kobe beef prime rib fried rice     They some good Chinese food gai lan! meat carving station rotisserie chicken made to order taco station large selection seafood including snow crab legs crawfish     Unfortunately sushi wasn't impressive rice heavy hard I tried roll fish nigiri looked sitting way long  Perhaps lateness  Although Hijiki seaweed salad delicious!   Pizza great especially when came fresh oven   course salad bar great too  I no idea why but always want salad  Plenty choose quality ingredients    Desserts    lots choose from  chocolate dome tiramisu good   soft serve too    Drinks non alcoholic included   Order when you're table     Service = friendly   attentive drinks cleared off dirty plates provided ample napkins      Prices = $34 99 dinner buffet Monday Thursday  It $39 99 Friday through Sunday  other prices Chef's Table Gourmet dinner lunch breakfast weekend brunch   also offer option unlimited Margaritas Bloody Marys sparkling wine beer $12 99 those mood drinking  Overall I'd say good place decent buffet without breaking bank  <EOR> Loved food amazing waiter nice   Minus 1 star price really $50 person because st Patrick's day  Which 3 days ago  no sense  didn't even see St Patrick's food <EOR> from all reviews read heard really underwhelmed got   decor reminded ann arbor's olive garden nursing home homely   compared wicked buffet cosmo place did look appetizing all   the food selection wasn't awesome but wasn't bad would say average buffet   but probably because during lunch   20 bucks per person lunch wasnt bad price     the pro did appreciate speedy waiter service here   more top things wicked buffet   but when back Vegas don't think i'd visiting bellagio's buffet first choice    <EOR> I'm writing finishing desert  Honestly place hyped up  came based reviews  really looking forward place but husband disappointed  anticipated some really good quality dishes  food wasn't bad but alright nothing amazing  standing line saw long line getting thinking wow place must good people wait 30 40mins  place spacious  buffet all area choices limited  Some dishes better others  dessert  best part! Save your money try better quality buffet! <EOR> I tried just every buffet strip personal favorite  However depending your tastes might others better  am crazy quality seafood sushi salad crab legs   Its only buffet strip offers sashimi poke steak tartar less $50   However if don't sushi prefer comfort foods different twist might place you  also find better deserts elsewhere  That being said still feel Bellagio best food best value Vegas  <EOR> Wynn Bellagio?  Tough choice   coin toss between two   If love Alaskan king crab creme brulee Wynn though thought opi snow crab legs sweeter more tender Alaskan King crab legs   Prime rib good both places   However shocked carver Bellagio cut prime rib half HORIZONTALLY   best part prime rib half tougher part other   If didn't know your cuts you'd missing most tender part prime rib   still couldn't believe it   never buffet does that    Cut thinner if don't want people waste but don't cut half horizontally!!!  Other desserts overall better Bellagio   if sushi poke salad definitely here   even spicy tuna hand roll   Yum! <EOR> My favorite buffet Vegas HANDS DOWN! Real good food selection someone thinks Wynn's buffet just too    fancy? LOL  Love fish rock shrimp pizza pastas salads prime rib ooh desserts! Although haven't seen favorite chocolate covered strawberries during last visit   is dinner only? during lunch  HMMM  Regardless always eat Mandalay Bay when we're town  <EOR> Nomz  Aghh  tasty delicious many choices  surprised cheap breakfast $15 99 considering Bellagio  which super swanky   Although breakfast did full spread lunch foods desserts well   The service great very clean including bathrooms much choose from  list some things ate lots lox bagels cream cheese eggs florentine watermelon lavender honey flan bomb diggity bread pudding shrimp pesto pizza eclair berries etc  Now listing everything ate kind feel fatty   but whatever  Vegas! <EOR> Hmm buffet really isn't good line would suggest  Its very average only slightl upscale vibe it  Save your money wynn cosmo instead which similar prices but much better food  dont during busy season coz line ridiculously long times! <EOR> Went brunch buffet Saturday $23 95  wrong? Most amazing food ever  wait line 45mins 1hr but totally worth it  Very few other buffets offer brunch    only other option Wynn $32  Bellagio totally worth would again  <EOR> I still consider Bellagio buffet best Strip quality good regardless whether peak dinner weekend off peak time i e  breakfast    buffet nice selection great variety   desserts waffles Kobe beef favorites buffet  <EOR> The dinner buffet best Strip   everything would want eat Beef pork chicken lamb king crab large shrimp lobster desserts etc     It however pretty pricey I know hard believe limit much food physically stuffed into confines human stomach   if company footing bill if you're looking splurge place dinner  <EOR> The last time Bellagio buffet back 2007  honestly say quality down hill drastically  weekend brunch saturday afternoon  expected some really good food since remembered really enjoying before even compared higher Wynn    The selection very low items high quality many yelpers mentioned  brunch regular buffet fare breakfast foods pancakes eggs potatoes waffles french toast omlette station  type food being served any buffet there's nothing special  noticed 2 breakfast stations which selection even smaller   Sushi  california rolls vege rolls  C'mon guys if want top player serve some more specialized rolls  California rolls common nowadays buffets vegas please serve them something more special such tempura salmon tempura yellow tail tuna albacore really stand competition   Soups   mushroom chicken noodle  another average selection   Meats turkey roast beef lamb pretty standard again   Seafood no crab legs weekend brunch which thought stranged   Bottom line if want just over priced average brunch Bellagio winner  don't even real ice cream comes frozen yogurt machine  wayyy better brunch Station casinos off strip  <EOR> Longest wait ever expensive meal  Service which only drinks dirty plates terrible  Food mostly cold very appetizing  best thing ice tea always cold don't forget stop great glass tea <EOR> I disappointed food!  Thank goodness buffets comped   charge $37 per person not worth it    crab legs bit fishy prime rib mediocre everything else just average   However caviar tuna sashimi great!  Desserts pretty standard buffet   Would come back   would check bacchanal buffet Caesars    little more $ but food much better  <EOR> Another great Vegas buffet  Though prefer bacchanal buffet over Caesar's Palace different  much more affordable however  Around $35 per person opposed around $55 Caesar's  variety spread therefore more limited  Notable foods snow crab legs I literally ate 3 plates worth steak flank  wait longer Caesars but thankfully mom platinum member skipped 3 hour line  <EOR> 47 99 holiday price getting high quality seafood desserts Topnotch quality king crab leg where its REAL refers natural sweet tender w fresh hot butter dip   They use BEST veal baby cow tender soft but time don't it    Their desserts best use fresh made eclairs but don't time   But light cream mousse best compare Wynn encore's buffets  <EOR> So heard best buffet strip  Wow disappointed   40 dollars person bland boring food  worth all  Yes crab legs shrimp but doesn't all  <EOR> A decent buffet but expect better Bellagio  Monday evening 2 for 1 reward MLife account  short line around 6 00pm but line MLife members made quickly  Service best experienced buffet never plates cleared drinks refilled quickly    Carving stations included kobe beef prime rib turkey chicken sausages  liked selections pizza pastas soups breads especially pretzel rolls!

Honestly TI Luxor buffet even better Luxor isnt good    Save your money aria buffet Wynn Ceasars  Bellagio horrible now they've gone down hill  <EOR> Went Saturday Father's Day weekend dinner  Price $49 99  Unfortunately buffet just worth price cost      The food mediocre wasn't much variety  Also some foods really salty times  guess depends much salt cooks poured onto food     The workers clearing plates whatnot very kind quick though  star workers  <EOR> This review strictly Bellagio's dinner buffet   I'm always walking through past Bellagio when Vegas anyways going dinner buffet no brainer  started coming part trip Vegas every time since 2014  replaced Bacchanal Caesar's Palace go to buffet Vegas   They tiered pricing depending day week go   M Th dinner $37 pp F Sun dinner $42 pp   There line no matter day prepared wait unless you're Pearl M life member higher   There great selection food appease every taste bud but absolute favorites grilled meat including juicy prime rib tender short ribs crab legs spicy tuna hand rolls pasta dessert station  disappointed paella didn't raw oysters!  I always eat more need but couldn't help all delicious food around me   Lastly fan organic chamomile pyramid tea bag! <EOR> This place legendary! Sure line incredibly long price kinda high but worth both  might best buffet experience Vegas  quality top notch comparable most 3 5 4 star restaurants    I measure buffet places quality crab legs   this best  jumbos overly salty some lower quality places  many many different stations food   if sweet tooth place your fix!   I believe close 10pm   arriving any later 8 30pm probably in     Check them out! <EOR> The buffet probably better lower priced ones but almost $30 person dinner sure all great   very disappointed sushi which surprisingly better Flamingo buffet   sushi tasted pre packaged ones you'd find your local Safeway Costco   2 varieties poke so so crab legs shrimp variety cooked seafood   The buffet food looks better Flamingo's but thought only desserts better overall   really good desserts slices cakes creme' brulee cookies flan tarts etc   Jr  Yelper red meat prime rib Kobe' beef which OK    BBQ short ribs boneless quite tender tasty    You early wait line   first evening arrived around 6 30PM 1 5 2 hrs wait left  2nd nite 5PM eat 1 hr's wait   server good filling sodas water   Hard understand any person eat all food   took just tablespoon size some foods just sample full don't think sampled even 1 3 choices available   If you're big portion eater then buffets may worth dollars spent otherwise you're just overeating going really fat   kid just look around folks buffet lines  <EOR> Soooo much food      come hungry lots time really your money's worth <EOR> really disappointment  bunch different food stations country but everything tasted crappy buffet id anywhere  think golden corral   salad bar maybe 5 6 toppings fresh varied soups old sitting around long meat station chewy sliders plain undercooked china pork stew really underseasoned sushi bite spit out pizza probably best part but mostly because its hrd mess up  bellagio seriously your game here  waste <EOR> After hour wait wasn't worth it  paying $91 two wasn't worth it  After being seated old dance floor near front door masses watching eat wasn't worth it  eating food own local Indian Casino Buffet beats far less wasn't worth it  paying $7 park wasn't worth it  Folks bottom line could much better  money spent $98 could definitely find better experience  Did mention flies? Yes little nats flying around table food faces?  Yummm  <EOR> Maybe visited third day having visited Bacchanal Wicked Spoon    kept exchanging 'What happened place?' glances during whole dinner  hubby brother yours truly used think Buffet BOMB but last visit left wondering why should ever come back   Just few examples * Salty icy king crab legs totally edible * Prime rib serious lack flavor don't mean put ton salt no  mean just adequate seasoning bring natural flavor * Subpar sushi sashimi * Dessert pretty look but totally deficient bright fresh flavor delight perfect end meal  Why create competitive edge low glycemic dessert selection stevia not Truvia junk    Use Stevia Raw organic blue agave syrup Costco carries them example? artisanal ice cream sorbet packs some awesome flavor?  Really money time which equals money spent comparative selections there    Hmmm    1 star ambiance locational advantage being Bellagio 1 star service drinks silverwares reasonably efficient removal used plates <EOR> Buffet @ Bellagio!!  hell yesssss  All Eat much variety different cultures  Definitely place your grub on! <EOR> This best buffet far Vegas   2 different types crab legs King crab legs Apilio crab legs spicy tuna poke spicy tuna hand roll excellent   didn't try pasta mainly seafood sushi didn't want waste space stomach pasta   creme brulee awesome dessert different compartment there's always room <EOR> On Sunday 6 15 14 girlfriend decided hit Buffet Bellagio Father's Day brunch  watched segment TV few years ago buffet Bellagio  supposed best buffets Las Vegas  couldn't wait indulge all different foods!

We Vegas group course didn't find until half group home  Overall presentation fantastic!!  line should tipped off place one   LONG lines moved quite quickly   dining area itself HUGE!!  tables aren't close together don't listen everyone else's conversations  I'm picky eater group plenty choices   Your definitely going hungry here   Others group raved lamb   liked keep some breakfast foods during lunch buffet   earliest riser but still love eat breakfast no matter time day   Staff very friendly!!  So glad found buffet   Price average! Food great!! <EOR> 3 5 stars! buffet better ones you'll find Vegas but dining Wynn last couple times Vegas think Wynn buffet might edge bit    My family came Sunday night dinner $29 95 pp    not bad considering prices Friday Saturday night  researching different buffets strip Sunday $5 more then others  line thinking skipping buffet because needed catch show but line actually moved relatively fast seated maybe less 30 minutes later 12 wait while tables set    The food Tasty! Good array meats prime rib! pasta pizzas sushi seafood salads course   dessert! Everything fresh too  can't remember all details every single dish ate but most pretty good  Although thing noted Kobe beef cooked way rare  just bloody couldn't finish all  crab legs abundant but served cold  kitchen staff warm them you  just need ask them    I didn't find dessert section impressive though  usual cakes  saw bread pudding flan creme brulee  think also machine soft serve ice cream? creme brulee delicious  nice hot  Love!  Also food constantly being refilled  staff totally top game! never saw anything empty  waiter he ok  don't think he attentive ask lot things  Gratuity already tacked onto bill because such large party    Overall food solid  I'd come back   not sure if pay weekend peak prices though but still stands good option! <EOR> Wow    second night Vegas first time life    Buffet Bellagio   line wasn't extremely long front even Friday night   did pretty early around 6 30 which gave enough time 10pm show   Once paid promptly seated   place huge   quickly first plates yes PLATES plural food   straight some veggies fish slice pizza crab legs   maybe five seven buffets    Sushi Salads Mediterranean Meats Turkey Kobe Beef Rack Lamb Prime Rib which also asparagus mushrooms mash potatoes Italian pizzas pesto pasta ravioli lasagna type thing Asian fried rice fish   etc  few other buffets didn't want try   desserts phenomenal!  must trys creme brulee sorbets raspberry peach    lot unique pastries well   Overall I'd definitely eat again    but willing fork close $100 two people  <EOR> Food stale  tasted bad  many options  Service pathetic 10 wanted sit together did join table  Also dinner very pricey  would never again  <EOR> We eating rio buffet several years row other trips  friends gotten married everyone after  late catching some sleep made over   weekend $10 more   Never again  may all gourmet food but no thank you!! easy good quality sea food hot warm crab legs cold iced traditional buffet foods  not  all very good quality but damn fancy me  tried caviar first last time   Three different kinds  sure may worth $39 paid per person but way way over priced   The desert section awesome! Gotta love bananas foster! <EOR> I guess give Bellagio Buffet 3 stars  Four returned Las Vegas absence several years   arrived Saturday  good news bad news thought  bad news price very high lines long  expected good news Ostrich steaks Elk roast Venison many other excellent foods previously enjoyed only Bellagio   Bellagip Buffet ranked top few buffets world!  excited When arrived buffet surprised find no line all   price turned even higher expected off putting   paid grabbed plates   found no exotic foods all  meats nor delicious seaweed any only Bellagio favorites   told items removed menu along other higher cost restaurant items  price but food cheaper! The food still prepared well very tasty but Bellagio no longer even worth honorable mention Nevada never mind listed best buffers world  Good food but worth cost  old buffet now relighted memory great feasts gone by  <EOR> Really good choices everyone!  Mt only reason 4 stars instead 5 because meal rate dinner advertised $36 99 but actual rate $40 99 before tax   enjoyed vegetarian options things well seasoned properly cooked all around!  didn't eat whole day afterward  <EOR> It supposed stay Vegas! Why did those extra couple pounds follow home? now all Yelp read know unhidden truth did Sin City   This best buffet Vegas  terrific variety cold salads unusual delicious  hot dishes also really good great recipes much essence prepared sit steam table  huge perhaps taking just little bit plate each time going back more walk off calories? desserts good pass even though visualized practicing restraint before but hey going stay Vegas!  The best thing afterwards would long brisk walk enjoy sights  casinos  did  atrium plop onto couch craning face upwards soaking beautiful glass ceiling flower garden Chihuly then shift couches yet another view  Then short stroll Dancing Fountains  Sounds cheesy quite surprise only enjoy but moved its beauty  <EOR> Don't expect life serve expect  Just enjoy buffet  ? Manoj Vaz  I feel above quote basically sums view Buffet Bellagio It's definitely expected but family enjoyed nonetheless   During recent vacation mom expressed interest wanting try Vegas buffet   Buffet Bellagio nearly 10 years ago remembered quite decent   since all wanted view Bellagio Conservatory decided check off two things list made way Bellagio Hotel   NOTE 1   Buffet near O Theatre   Follow signs  2   lunch   $23 99 per adult   Though wasn't tremendously busy when arrived still wait 5 10 minutes seated   server took drink orders then mom brother off explore food stations   Overall selection variety food offerings stations satisfactory but would say nothing particular compelled return twice same area   course should always room least try different cuisines prepared buffets general     at least  view dining buffet   All things considered brother mom myself chose items including salads fruits pastas chicken burgers vegetables soup   though all food prepared well food station left lasting impression dessert!  mom sampled various cheesecakes including seasonal pumpkin flavor key lime pie carrot cake   Portion sizes just right where felt enough overly stuffed   definitely sweet end meal sure   SERVICE alright   cashier bit rough but server dining room very friendly patient   BOTTOM LINE Good variety food stations cuisine   Dessert excellent! <EOR> The crab legs fresh delish! bad part prime rib first wasn't awesome hoped be  But when boyfriend came back better part loved it! Very juicy!!!   The downer sushi spring rolls  good  Oh well     rest awesome though   I must say everytime buffet desserts awful  one  Chocolate Vanilla Dome Fruit Crepe Tiramisu delectable! 2 Chocolate Vanilla Domes even!!! boyfriend stayed 2 hours until tummies cannot hold anymore   Oh did say excellent service? didn't mango juice lady server suggested combination orange raspberry  good! server suggests things  Awesome! definitely back when town!  Oh check Bellagio Gardens after! nice!  Update Bacchanal Caesar's better Bellagio  <EOR> Nah am sad say am disappointed food  only thing made feel worth spending money crab legs which definitely delicious  Also smoked salmon buttery soft comes generously sized fatty portions! However other dishes aren't unique tasty enough buffet stand others  Kobe beef roast very excited but very over cooked  barely any pink steak meat hard beef jerky hard  Now  waste Kobe beef  Then sand cooked vegetables miso soup salty  Still giving them three stars though huge variety food dessert option huge  Come if discount  <EOR> This review dinner!

Unfortunately delicious crab legs practically frozen let them thaw eat them  recommend chorizo pasta if  your thing whole sushi section chose from  Does anyone else try every single dessert buffets?? Pecan pie fruit tarts mini cheesecakes delicious chocolate mousse coconut macaroon froyo apple pie creamy creme brulee    all very appealing eyes  server friendly quick service  iced tea water cup always refilled unwanted plates gone time came back next round food   On side note use more stalls each bathroom  3 womens 3 mens enough! <EOR> I Love Buffet! another review stated super clean classy buffet get!

Can't wait again!! <EOR> The buffet experience reasons why Vegas Bellagio satisfies craving    somewhat   meat eaters your taste buds dance array meats ranging salmon veal   While prime rib quite good Mandalay Bay's kobe beef very delicious   also beef wellington which rare   specialty believe dessert bar   creme brulee which favorite don't disappoint   couldn't help myself 3 those  <EOR> 3 stars because hype price  good yes but def expecting id put 4th 4 buffets tried here  If your close staying good but if your picking I'd try some others first  But can't wrong just don't over excited price little underwhelming  <EOR> Great buffet  think gained 5 lbs before check came  just changed mind took away star cuz remember steak whatever meat serving good  <EOR> ** First impression overall very good including service cashier food quality  ** first time breakfast lunch arriving before 11 00am witness meal changeover  ** Breakfast $19 99 per however Bellagio   Thursday lot people hotel showing Bellagio's popularity still very high 2015  ** Nice location walk off your meal elaborate lobby area people watching  ** continue your meal walk front doors easy crossing street level        Strip right into Planet Hollywood where Miracle Mile shopping center  <EOR> My family wait almost 2 5 hours buffet over Christmas weekend  worth it? Hard say    I pigged king crab legs which think most expensive food available buffet  both cocktail sauce melted butter available which made everything taste much better  Unfortunately crab legs salted probably purpose people more full couldn't eat many    Other crab legs all other food items just okay  tried all meats but nothing extraordinary  family all enjoyed lamb however give try  also poke section wasn't bad  salmon tuna pre seasoned cut into small cubes could your own little poke salad bowl     My only other favorite bread pudding  two different types one regular chocolate maybe? but preferred regular darker colored much cinnamon  definitely recommend putting some vanilla soft serve top bread pudding it'll taste even better    Overall okay food but would never wait long buffet ever again  did however during Christmas weekend when Vegas super packed during regular days line probably isn't long  think buffet only worth going if REALLY want pig crab legs other buffets packed  <EOR> This Buffett best ever too    did all foods sampled  Such crawfish but hey   buffet for  Trying foods never had     son enjoyed prime rib mashed potatoes  Crab legs good but served chilled   much offer could on   good eat twice during 4 day visit    Skip Noodle eat here  disappointed  <EOR> I hope you've trained long hard young chocolate covered grasshopper!

Yes crab legs  Yes melted butter too! Yes creme brulee! if floor yes also Kobe beef 9'' Yum!  Tips survive Buffet Bellagio  Tip#1 MUCH THING  If any person knows best way eat buffet ME! take little everything little taste   Think buffet uncharted territory Capt  Stomach sent mission find best eatery bring back base   You're sent recon you're faced amalgam tastes smells EVERYWHERE! If looks good smells good take little see if tastes good especially if your first time trying it  grab pound mediterranean salad take bite dump it  Please  if tastes good don't much because there's million other things try also!  Tip #2 Create plan! Make map even! Walk around buffet first see you're working keep mental what's where everyone going seems most popular item buffet line  all know where start  Don't just start picking grabbing because unlike other buffets noticed most cultured cuisines  talking tacos orange chicken culture  talking bistro worthy eats won't find Taco  Bell Panda Express!   Tip#3 Start light work your way up!  So you're buffet line empty plate hand you're hunter hunger  Start light salad  own island you're won't much trouble finding it  Sounds epic doesn't it? Haha! There's also little sushi bar  Sometimes they'll even beef tartare! Mmmm  Then you've warmed your insides take tour seafood crab legs ALREADY CUT awesome! sea bass GREAT also  If you're lucky come time when Kobe beef some! absolutely scrumptous! extremely tender melts butter your mouth!  If you're local take your friends if really want taste Las Vegas buffets food all about!

Your wasting money bad service  <EOR> I actually little underwhelmed buffet   Maybe just hyped much friend maybe expecting more just your typical breakfast items price paid   Aside endless Mimosas Eggs Benedict smoked salmon probably best things available   sushi bar severely lacking choices only California Rolls Veggie Rolls   Then again    this place middle desert   should really surprised?  Brunch run little over $30 per person which honestly you're mostly paying name Bellagio   <EOR> The buffets Vegas greatly over rated started pricey point fine dining meal often better choice   Bellagio Buffet probably most consistently excellent food buffet style dining   excellent selection high quality ingredients few places match   flavor cooking isn't always where should but trade off challenge buffet dining   biggest negative legend place precedes often long lines enter gastronomic experience   would certainly recommend experience dinner least once your life might habit your subsequent Vegas visits  <EOR> Way overrated  lemonade tasted bathroom water lemon   fish dishes 3 all fishy spit them out  Smaller selection most buffets  Rest food boring desserts sweet   But did excellent brick oven style pizza some greens them  traditional pizza  back 3rds 4ths  If wasn't probably would pretty pissed waiting half hour line spending around $60 2 people  22 year old daughter also disappointed would return  <EOR> Growing Vegas ok buffet  Definitely better ones though  <EOR> I haven't Bellagio buffet years but honestly can't believe allowed quality product level  place really lost touch premium buffet  Wynn buffet last month   regret just going again  <EOR> Came Friday lunch buffet   Selection just ok but maybe time day  little more money's worth managed oh discretely snag 5 muffins 5 pears 2 apples 5 cookies hide them somewhere bodies left Couple close calls numerous waitstaff   Think bit suspicious when minute 5 muffins sitting plate next minute all gone including paper wrapping    Did well deserved props peeps sitting table next covert operation  <EOR> BEWARE  false advertisement ripoff pricing holiday pricing!!! ate last night 12 19 15 seated 9pm close 10pm   While waiting line asked host time stop cooking he said 10 30pm figured worth since we'd least 1 5 hr eat  Since 12 19 charged more $49 99 pp no child pricing even though brought son  3 paid over $150 dinner price you'd expect great food service but instead unfriendly service food staff except waitress cioppino station says made order when walked asked made order but woman just served bowl already cooked pot when asked she just replied busy no time  wtf bellagio service?!! Besides last hour busy be? holiday menu posted grilled lobster tails but no didn't see any closest thing crawfish said earlier host told stop cooking 10 30pm but 10pm caviar station already closed   Tried some frozen yogurt machine but already started draining machine 10pm all food tasted cooked massive no flavor whatsoever  For price paid just ridiculous food quality fraudulent advertising unfriendly lying staff  Never again would patronize bellagio buffet  <EOR> The food average  Just most buffets just lot choices  Some good some good   Disappointed because reputations place   would rush back  price 35 00 expected better  <EOR> Winner!

Prime rib dinner! prime rib all good Bellagio buffet  Dinner rates around $48 person soft drinks included expecting lot  Note self never expect much else 3 star awakening  dinner party impressed either  friend dusted off 4 plates full snow crab legs money's worth while other friend insisted pizza extremely good  Okay it! recommendation sucked  But beats 280 minute wait Bacchanal Buffet    right?

No lie off plane dropped luggage hotel jumped cab here  wasting any time  arrived Wednesday around 1 30pm line decent no more 10 minute wait  staff really friendly cordial  selection endless even though threw towel plate FAIL   really hours quality presentation but save time just say MUST GO! <EOR> It's fun wait line almost two hours service isn't much impress me  told only 30 minutes eat before foods stopped being served guess grab four plates food order money's worth? would given place 3 star rating if wasn't godly food  pasta just divine carrot cake best ever had  hard time breathing because much ate! Despite long wait power walking race food am determined come back  <EOR> Well say first line very long    even midweek  so prepare yourself that  When find atmosphere nice actually restroom INSIDE buffet which refreshing change   The food high quality tad surprised didn't more selection but none less food did good   not spectacular but good  buffet VERY crowded people may constantly your way walking into you     typical Strip setback  <EOR> My first buffet Vegas! Came during lunchtime happy wide variety selection but quality taste food wasn't good I'd hoped for  Some options wee bland while others salty    The seafood section favorites  enjoyed clams lot because great flavor  Asian section wasn't bad   enjoyed noodles mostly  can't wrong sushi!!   There huge selection desserts which awesome! two stood mousse cake bread pudding  total price payed lunch around $37 tax  Buffets must going Vegas    but being first nothing compare to  <EOR> Went last night husbands birthday usually eat Gallagher's steakhouse NY NY  told snow crab during week AlaskanKing Crab  true snow crab horrible  only thing able finish little lemon tart e cream him  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE save your money folks <EOR> While only eaten buffet Bellagio only once definitely favorites   Since most buffets cost $26 30 would much rather pick Bellagio since larger selection sushi   Service attentive line moves slowly but surely     Some meat cuts dry but much meat eater   also cut crab legs a definitely plus those love crab also great selection fish   didn't find dessert soup section extraordinary but don't think anyone buffet fill dessert soup main course! <EOR> Bellagio Buffet standard breakfast lunch don't judge if only ate breakfast lunch   Compared other vegas buffets great buffet dinner if your meats    If want crabs lunch Aria Buffet    Last time ate Bellagio Buffet Dinner March 2012   quail duck lamp chops kobe steaks prime rib decent tuna salmon sushi   When woke morning lost weight   WTF?

TIP If gamble enough use your MGM player's card register your meal partially fully comped   TIP #2 all buffets if fits into your schedule try time your entrance into buffet very end lunch   way they'll bringing pricier dinner items paid lunch price! <EOR> THIS PLACE DOPE!

Go Buffet Bellagio if love QUALITY food $20 spare lunch Vegas! Don't Buffet Bellagio if tight budget if indecisive! <EOR> I've never fan buffets but Bellagio's won over when first opened  But seems place gone down hill over years  food just isn't very good any more  <EOR> We came Tuesday night around 8PM saw lot people dressed up  expected crème de la crème buffets Vegas but pretty disappointed food offered   Service Front desk professional but very warm inviting       happy  Maybe because overwhelmed number people waiting in? Thankfully purchased pass prior going use VIP line but even then wait 15 minutes seated  server Victor he FABULOUS older gentleman wonderful stories great sense humor extremely accommodating love VICTOR! If come back would D  Food surprisingly mediocre  just expected more interesting things try but everything pretty basic exception Kobe carving station tuna poki  picky eater but price place charging would expect better  <EOR> My boyfriend arrived 3 30pm eat dinner order aviod waiting line long time however unexpectedly no person entrance all  Later know some people bought brunch tickets stayed until dinner could eat more foods especially some only provided dinner save more money  Even though recommend doing still works  managers waiters care when come leave neither recognize you  foods various e g  snow crab legs king crab legs shrimps salmon beef lamb ribs et al  special caviar but tastes so so  Chinese foods classic authentic all! Some dishes greasy some salty some insipid  However difficult full eat good reason why buffet buffet  <EOR> I same better buffet @ Bellagio 2 years ago  When back time quality food wasn't great last time  would rather try some new place next time  customer service excellent ! <EOR> We ate January 2nd $50+tax person   also first Vegas buffet advantage having no comparisons   Overall decently good   selection food very good   also plethora fancy stuff tuna pokes caviar   tried Kobe beef but didn't feel special but fancy stuff nonetheless   crab legs good large always resupplied quickly   weren't many different desserts Wicked Spoon but quality higher Bellagio   We ate Wicked Spoon very next day must say Bellagio superior every regard including service   An unrelated note gotta say keep yourself buffet per trip otherwise may much  <EOR> I'm reviewing recent experience eating here  came watching O GREAT SHOW once entered chowed down  pretty nice variety food but overall food just ok  Since LOVE desserts tried all desserts which disappointing but again nothing would try more then once  <EOR> I'm downgrading them two stars lunch selection   Yes price cheaper lunch but qualify selection lot less well   served flank steak turkey carving stations both cuts meats dry   sushi station very limited just veggie California roll request spicy tuna hand rolls   miso soup really salty too   seafood menu very limited too     I guess its still above average buffet but disappointed dinner last time really good  <EOR> Came first Vegas buffet experience can't compare others  would say its just ok  Good variety but pretty much nothing amazing  appearance fancy food but really just nice cafeteria fare  prime rib disappointing  brisket juicy bland  lamb chop bit better  Best parts some random sides some scalloped potato thing creamed spinach etc  desserts spot though ate six different ones all delicious  guess your money's worth but kinda wish I'd just gone cheaper doesn't pretend fancy  <EOR> We when offering special Chinese New Year buffet  split grilled lobster tails rack lamb some other dishes typically offered  lobster person lamb matter but BF super stoked  price more expensive advised only offer lobster during New Years Chinese New Year   salad bar bit small but offered different types lettuces typical salad toppings  additional smaller salad appetizer area shrimp caesar salad another well but forgot kind  station also offered antipasta selection meats cheeses olives peppers etc  real shaved parmesan well  meat station crowded because  where doing lobster tails everyone hovered around trying one   cauliflower au gratin which excellent! BF much vegetable eater but he loved maybe something incorporate into meals home  Also grilled asparagus carved turkey w cranberry sauce which actually quite dry  think maybe need leave hunk skin over already cut piece turkey keep somewhat moist   Fingerling roasted potatoes good trying Asian foods Pizza areas distracted desserts really didn't see much but remember small sushi area offering nigiri rolls typical asian inspired cuisine chow mein fried steamed rice chicken broccoli seafood dishes  Now dessert cart  YUM!  chocolate vanilla dome cake which die for!  looked cocoa powder dusted over dome but actually cake!  really thin layer chocolate cake think mocha color vanilla chocolate mousse inside creamy!  wanted 6 them but slyly put them little square plates making hard actually take many! lol   also piece tiramisu which equally good creamy  BFhad piece cheesecake which he said great!

Several carving stations many different food areas  grabbed plate started end without realizing buffet wrapped around  just kept going! Next time would walk through whole thing before putting anything plate  most buffets hits misses    Predictably favorite items dessert items  put bread pudding caramelized peaches caramel sauce vanilla custard  best dessert long time  cousin loved carrot cake  Everyone party found something liked    Worth full price? sure  Using your MLife points deal? Definitely  <EOR> I high expectations place considering part Bellagio nicest hotels Las Vegas   Maybe limited because part Mother's Day Champagne brunch way lacked lot   I don't particularly care buffets but Mother's Day mom wanted try place   waited line over hour but excuse because most busy day year lunch     It small selection food compared other buffets flavor worse   Everything bland   could tell no difference between food food Station casino buffet off strip   desserts limited couldn't keep refilling selection   good portion buffet empty   Crab legs scarce   Why spend $35+ flavorless food?    Our server slow didn't refill waters very often   Go Rio buffet  hotel isn't nice Bellagio but buffet way better  <EOR> For all hype buffet receives thought OKAY  mean sure say best buffet ever eaten but still guess because everyone know kept going OH GOSH BELLAGIO BUFFET BEST WORLD OH GOSH! just expected     lot more maybe just really picky? knows   I ate Bellagio Buffet first day Vegas  friend tried cheat system  wanted right before lunch ended dinner began we'd avoid paying dinner prices  Apparently everyone mother doing same  2 45 didn't seated until 3 30 lol    Now don't know much dinner Bellagio usually costs  since weren't able pay cheap lunch price expecting pay     $30 most dinner Wednesday  But nope! Because holiday season dinner weekday I'm sure if same weekends cost eye opening $45 person! Yup $97 two people  dip into gambling budget pay dinner when cashier handed back receipt expecting room key something because seriously couldn't believe spent $100 dinner Wednesday didn't anything else  But again type person tries into buffets right lunch ends avoid paying dinner prices no judgment    We wanted stay buffet least two hours moneys worth did  friend through four five plates each plus dessert  buffet LOT food  think third round trying find fork discovered another section buffet missed lol  didn't notice any Mexican food I hoping taco station something! but lots pasta fettuccine tortellini ravioli lots DELICIOUS pizza lamb steak turkey Asian Thai food some American     sushi which did like  decided just can't bring myself sushi served buffets  prefer 'All Eat' sushi route instead 'buffet' type thing   desserts think more pretty look eat  good but nothing really stood out  maybe just really full food couldn't appreciate it   So all all buffet just okay  definitely going try Wynn's Buffet soon settle rivalry between two  Whatever expectations Bellagio's Buffet just take down couple notches sure you'll enjoy it  <EOR> Update took family back lunch 2 22 17  usual amazing  steak perfect medium rare very tender  shrimp plentiful delicious  even Spicy Tuna Handrolls! also signature seafood omelet which consists shrimp real crab meat mushrooms spinach jalapeños course lots cheese! dessert bar Creme Brûlée!

To most your Vegas experience somehow save some money during day obviously spend twice much night Buffet Bellagio answer  wake ample time recover your hangover find your way line 3PM  You'll 30 minutes while they're still serving lunch  Grab small plate sample anything lunch entrees look unique  your appetizer  Now wait until 4PM them put crab legs seafood dinner entrees  Your first last meal day now ready  strategy just taste lunch dinner items lunch price $25   large group Asian people strategy down long before here   Stay away Biryani anything Indian sushi   My favorite item pesto mashed potatoes! <EOR> The buffet pretty good however believe way over priced worth  quality nothing exceptional variety food decent but nothing ordinary  $50 person dinner which more some other buffets higher ratings such buffet Aria Hotel  But since Bellagio charge want still overflow customers  wait 45 minutes 9 30 pm  quite few open tables but servers did turn them around very quickly which caused wait longer would if more servers faster wait staff  wait staff very friendly did feel really cared much waiting us  <EOR> The best dinner buffet ever had  variety endless anything everything else you've another buffet but better quality preparation  weeknight price verrry reasonable  it less extra $5 other good buffets mid strip area extra few bucks definitely worth here  only give place 4 starts because although food excellent Bellagio all think fair hold them higher standard  But still great buffet must do Vegas list catch free spectacularly beautiful water fountain show outside full dinner  <EOR> No   Just no   least breakfast   those rare instances when say would back if free  Even buy deal pissed off   breakfast anyone ever cruised say cruise ship breakfast buffet not great mind you beats Bellagio's   really nothing redeeming it   pastries borderline gross eggs meh fruit offerings pathetic coffee forgettable   just expected way more 5 star property   Oh   and should mention ridiculous line which just added insult injury  <EOR> Food never made happier! far BEST dinner buffet money buy   Yes worth wait yes worth $40 per person   You find something even most pickiest eater still your money's worth!  We coming back again again  <EOR> I firmly believe buffet best Vegas I rank highly because food quality price ratio  almost all Vegas buffets buffet best seafood selections  KING CRAB legs  itself buffet worth me  King crab $30 dollar pound just keep mind  Most buffets serve snow crab which nearly expensive  also salmon tuna poke salmon nigiri!  The dessert selection great too! many different things try they're all adorably plated too  If you've already gone Carnival Rio Wicked Spoon Bacchanal highly recommend place!   Many people complain long wait times but EVERY buffet Vegas going similar 2 3 hour wait time completely disregarded review because find irrelevant  review solely based food quality price  However recommend coming around 4 30 line because pretty bad 6pm   Note Different items served during holidays  Holiday pricing also higher without much change quality  tried both but prefer regular one! <EOR> One top favorite buffets Vegas excellent coffee!   They changed self serve drink service over past few years meaning your own non alcoholic drinks   Also changed glass plastic cups doesn't feel higher end buffet when opened   Still really good food   Recommend walking through atrium hotel lobby while you're always beautiful!   PS Bellagio more macarons daily! <EOR> In absolute terms fairly good buffet  But given amount people waiting line absurd talk gets bit downer  Much food even Sushi slightly lower quality all eat Staten Island  knocking but given context world class casino Vegas then less would expect  being said put lot work into desserts very much matches level expected  waiting staff also high quality despite hectic scene still stop conversation you  <EOR> So typically hate reviews service food  But spending solid 40 minutes line  Tuesday afternoon 4 30 saw buffet employee asking groups many party  Turns he seeking small groups willing  sit bar!

You'll sure your fix salads charcuterie sushi sashimi meats seafoods Asian food Italian plenty desserts    Surprisingly coffee really good!  All all nothing WOW'd $38 sure if I'd likely back   but if you're looking traditional Vegas buffet still probably towards top list  <EOR> $30 weekend lunch = worth it  If yourself weekday believe even cheaper approx  $15 $20 which = even *more worth it*   Here takeaways  The Bellagio offers really great service buffet  part rambunctious party 16 constantly waitresses stopping refilling drinks when say bottomless champagne mimosas really mean it chatting amiably taking away finished plates  The buffet most ripe delectable fruit ever! Juicy white peaches perfectly shaped pears    Bellagio's attention detail fruit ripeness noteworthy  I don't remember everything ate it long weekend but recall eating tons bacon  let tell good  Definitely bacon  Most items cooked surprisingly well being produced en masse  lot fresh seafood well prepared sushi variety smoked fish shrimp cocktail pounds squid octopus ceviche  pastries crowning point in fact existed only notch above severely underwhelming    pallid tart pie crusts thing but fresh bread killer  Everyone keeps taking posting pictures macarons  saw none visit thus buy some separately Jean Phillipe  HUGE BUMMER  MINUS STAR  Kidding  But honestly only slightly  In end buffets buffets  When gauging your own hedonistic binging experience only two questions should ask yourself good buffet food bad buffet food?  Did recover least half money through mouth? If answers good  yes then you've won buffet  exactly felt dining Bellagio  <EOR> Usually pretty good service but great time   wait line over hour which understandable being NYE but once inside told only 1 hour since going switch brunch dinner   Other everything good   Lots sugar free options  <EOR> Delicious! highly recommend buffet! Everything cooked very well  definitely back  <EOR> Out all buffets Vegas tied first along Wynn   Even though wait dinner long price made want shoot myself worth nice splurge  remember buffet being big tons selection  quality sushi stood must several plates it  Couldn't tell crab legs other seafood items I'm into those things but did notice people piling plates high crab lobster  while since back but remember Asian selections really good   The desserts also some best had  Everything tried good! would definitely come back dinner  <EOR> I dinner Bellagio Buffet last night   Although line long time consuming food worth wait!  Once sat greeted promptly server provide drink    started seafood section crab legs delicious    Next hit Asian BBQ sections buffet    Both many different options    Service great good second none    If your mood superior vegas buffet strongly suggest Bellagio Buffet! <EOR> $40 + tax weekend buffet which closes 10pm! Waited only 10 15 minutes 8pm Saturday night  Unlimited drinks alcohol costs extra  Huge assortment tons seafood options favorite! Good thing came buffet because originally just wanted eat ahi tuna poke dinner another place but actually some sushi ahi tuna salmon poke!   I didn't care for Beef wellington friends really liked but think bad cut pastry actually undercooked crispy   maybe because last portion day  Kobe beef seriously toughest piece meat  I couldn't even cut knife! Very disappointed because never kobe beef before high expectations   For dessert recommend sugar free apple pie vanilla custard overall sweet when eaten together! Also bread pudding vanilla custard Overall good buffet price! <EOR> This brunch buffet good but good Mandalay Bay's   definite selection among food   also build your own omelet station but scrambled eggs instead   bit runny   did french toast stuffed chocolate bananas  quite delicious   Overall good but great  <EOR> Gag  Everything overheated overcooked hot enough stale  pretty disappointed won't eating buffet again  <EOR> Very good quality variety  Price decent  $25 lunch  great selection seafood sushi  also awesome dessert  section  Nothing rave but pretty good  If planning eating lot worth price  <EOR> I really enjoyed myself here  food delicious  omelet station great although lady working station didn't listen people requested omelet   macaroons simply delicious! well sushi selection large   *Suggestion provide discount children don't eat 35 dollars worth food! <EOR> One expensive buffet ok ready stand line 30 mins more! line wrapped pretty far cashier  enjoyed sashimi salmon poke liked prime rib well first second hard good  deserts tasty    This best buffet but pretty ok worth price though  $40 person? crazy  would nice $25 buffet  <EOR> I love buffets them lot  already buffet Wynn hotel more then happy try different buffet  friend suggested bellagio though sure! new place new yelp review!  So head thank goodness came early because no line wait pay but wait time table 6??? bit frustrated because open tables just didn't seat us  finally seated 10 15 minutes waiting    Usually when buffets starving no surprise   when HUNGRY! decided circle around area see have  Vegas buffet felt selections very limited much things appealed me  But still manged little everything    The taste alright  able full but only scarf down 2 plates  think most enjoyable item pasta ravioli truffle sauce  Besides alright  food okay nothing really gave wow factor  <EOR> After reading other reviews prepared love Bellagio Buffet   Having just left though must admit pretty disappointed    We arrived 2pm Thursday line reached telephones outside restaurant   moved pretty steadily though party 4 seated 40 minutes   general service pretty sloppy   times when 6 dirty plates piled table aside iced tea which filled pretty regularly flag someone down another drink   From carving stations tried flank steak kobe prime rib chicken ribs   flank marinated wonderfully ribs awesome but everything else pretty meh over undercooked   The shrimp plentiful tasty plus come pre shelled   crab legs didn't come until dinner line them maybe 15 deep first but died down half hour   Tonight both snow king   didn't appreciate fact they're cut half much expected usually can't pull meat piece because there's layer cartilage middle   Also didn't very good job defrosting them since most legs still chunks ice them but ask someone behind counter heat them you   The lunch sushi options pretty bare but sashimi comes dinnertime   Although seen ads buffet having dim sum only BBQ pork buns   think four types pasta all but vegetarian   tortellini really good   also fan pesto mashed potatoes   The salad bar few premade salads favorite being spinach bacon one   During lunch bunch deli meats cheese but taken away dinner   mozzarella balls must try!  The dessert station 30 options all beautifully made each approximately two bite size   20 them little tarts cakes then bread pudding brownies cookies   saw three sugar free options   probably shared 10 desserts mom   Everything pretty good but favorites cheesecake creme brulee key lime tart   sister huge fan fruit tarts ate six   All all felt $19 99 worth lunch but don't know if worth $29 99 dinner   However given generally ranked top three buffets Vegas feel bit overrated   much better experience Le Village Buffet across street Paris Las Vegas when came few years ago  <EOR> For personal taste   thought food salty  Meats starchy foods Mac n cheese mashed potatoes veggies too     The meat especially prime rib fatty when asked less fat request insulted carver dude seriously!?  facial expressions body language hand movements all unnecessary     cut down plate even more all 4 bites? 1st buffet Vegas meh  If leave em alone  <EOR> Did Champagne Brunch 1pm Sunday  fairly busy 30 min wait so?   server took care beverages  She brought carafe OJ table own mimosas which loved   The food great! ate LOT  Prime Rib no au jus? Passion Fruit Sorbet Exotic Cake BACON SAUSAGE EGGS BREAAAAAAAAD  happy camper  pricy but nice reward half marathon! would highly recommend this  <EOR> One worst buffets casino  only gave 2 stars because didn't food poisoning   The decor terrible looks Denny's best  definitely would expect fine establishment Bellagio   I definitely recommend Wicked Spoon right next door Cosmopolitan if foodie  <EOR> Came while back pretty good great ambiance vibe  Feels  Very upscale compared some other lesser buffets near by  Plenty choices lots good stuff hardcore meat eaters there  pretty crowded though  If u looking late night grub sesh before hitting strip club ain't place  But if u looking nice place take your girl before going then yea come here! <EOR> We came few days before Christmas course pay holiday pricing close $50 person which expected during holiday complaining price   line extended all way outside around buffet  took good indication good food going be   We quickly seated had front line pass   took awhile before someone came drinks  Seem bit understaffed evening   ONTO FOOD Pho Station Not really pho station since didn't even pho rice noodles  Instead pick udon mei fun Chinese cellophane rice noodles yes rice noodles but they're ones find your standard bowl pho   broth dark broth which honestly tasted beef broth very salty vegetable broth which tasted funny   Definitely suggest skip station   Hand Roll To excitement saw sheets seaweed next sushi bar  asked if those hand rolls guy said yes  asked California hand roll     Nope only roll spicy tuna hand roll  Great tuna lovers great me   Crab Legs They 2 separate areas where find crab legs  Good job! Crowd control  Once select your legs ask staff heat you  legs hit miss  mostly just ok tasting legs occasional super yummy sweet legs between   Salad Bar pays $50 buffet eat salad? do! Mainly because everything else just looked whatever    sad say highlight buffet experience  Three types greens select from  variety toppings   Dessert Lots choose from  Portion nice small able try everything  love flan try those  just ok  Didn't bother finishing it    OVERALL Would come again? don't think so  price would rather eat Bacchanal   What disappointing first last meal <EOR> $40 all eat high end buffet  place most moderately priced restaurant could find wasn't cheesy cafe  turned best meal all weekend   All eat crab legs  Prime rib perfectly cooked  Sushi ahi poke spicy tuna hand roll  Spaetzle  Salads fruit veggies  Braised lamb Asian pork ribs  Bananas foster  Mini cakes  Cookies  Stuff yourself until food spills your ears   This place sums Las Vegas experience    excess excess! green lovin' tree huggin' recyclin' fool thing Vegas seen post consumer anything!

Doubtful  Would visit any other buffet? Probably either  <EOR> If  4 Friday Saturday gourmet buffet far best buffet ever   least 6 times year probably more   just budget 6 times lol   lamb chops which always little red but them put grill them well done   ahi poke spicy tuna rolls sushi rolls caviar   also prime rib which hit miss if medium rare kobe beef which also hit miss   Don't think ever tried beef wellington   smoked trout good when along smoked salmon   ton other things even if steak isn't your liking when satisfied if other things menu   If red meat only thing want better off going Rio some other smaller places  Oh pre cut king sno crab which easy dig meat without effort  <EOR> We dinner waited over 45 min line 8 30 pm weekday   long time wait    I felt food fresh hot other breakfast lunch buffets visited  prime rib cool somewhat tough  red potatoes good    The thing didn't is personal hate smell fish seafood buffet smelled fish every section cause them having fish some places  gross  <EOR> The Buffet Bellagio far favorite all buffets visited Las Vegas  wait extremely long but always feel worth it  service pretty good some times better others but food variety beyond compare  Incredible selections sushi meats even breads! know seems silly bread buffet but PRETZEL BREAD!  I would say only food variety great Dessert selection think Wynn buffet wins department  But everything else Bellagio favorite! <EOR> You cannot buffet price impressed Give yourself half hour before being seated because always line Desserts fantastic Will defiantly return dinner next time We lunch visit  <EOR> My husband decided dine Bellagio Buffet based recommendation local resident  experience underwhelming which understatement   over priced offered selection similar any typical buffet  would rather taken money spent dining experience spent slot machine  <EOR> Excellent buffet  Brisket flank steak fantastic! hit end breakfast service start lunch good until dinner! Can't wait back next time we're town  <EOR> Every time Vegas eat Bellagio buffet   only gripe place sushi selection   All badly rolled masses rice mediocre stuffing   I love salad bar dessert selection comparable other places nothing special     Their shrimp always good love polenta ribs beefcubes bread   wasnt impressed 'kobe' beef its available everytime but time done wrong  Wasnt crazy lamb either   I loooove coffee its definitely gourmet   Yes lines long thats why its wonderful VIP   so price its worth try least once  <EOR> Poor selection such high end buffet! Food taste just ok outstanding  Spend your money somewhere else  hometown Indian casino buffet 10 times better then this? <EOR> I actually LOVE idea buffets  love having several different foods choose from  love knowing eat much want anything   The problem buffets never anything actually like   Things Don't Rather Eat Because Totally Even Good Why Would More Serving It Any kind breakfast food seriously  Why  Why would eat several eggs  Eggs plain easy cheap  dozen eggs cost $2 00 $3 00  Think all eggs want home  Why would anyone eat eggs buffet?!

Seriously quality buffet MOST AWESOME cheesecake ever life     The Buffet Bellagio doesn't mess around  Come worth it  <EOR> Moderation thy name Bellagio  No talking those dancing fountains  ceiling Chihuly blown glass blossoms lobby  elaborate conservatory  taliking damn buffet Vegas staple every casino hotel operation  town  But being Bellagio especially huge spread dishes wouldn't expect buffet line   And therein lies problem  just don't think Eggs Benedict should lumped dozen chafing dish French Toast wedges getting arid Sahara under heat lamps  fact everything warmed over slightly mushy texture never quite satisfies but somehow satiates because you'll damned your thirty dollars' worth food  thing no complaints service  army waitresses ready refilling coffee cups juice glasses picking dirty dishes   The lines move quickly would expect when people overwhelmed choices  If read guidebooks Bellagio often mentioned serving best buffets Strip  Oh really  appears bulimics less choice Sin City originally thought   FOOD 3 stars   quantity way relative mediocrity AMBIANCE 3 stars   something pig trough Italian villa SERVICE 4 stars   they keep those dishes moving TOTAL 3 stars   accommodates worst excesses   but least fixed price <EOR> Had breakfast Tuesday 9 30 AM  No wait all  ended being lunch dinner well  didn't need eat again all day!  The service quite good  Iced coffee rocks! Fresh squeezed OJ  Benedict Florentine great spinach crape smoked salmon chicken satay some favorites   It quite good overall world good but $19 Bellagio great meal  would definitely return  <EOR> EX CELL LENT! know long line little daunting but if would stick because food fantastic! quality sushi great lot other things crab legs prime rib pizza shrimp chinese food station lamb salads fruit etc etc  everything food much quality!! also dessert station many delicious desserts such creme brulee cheesecakes chocolate mousses other types desserts  dessert heaven!! YUMMY TUMMY!  Even though $30 per person would say if hungry worth it  stay long want relaxing friends  <EOR> I gone Bellagio Buffet over 5 years last time rather blah     Well time around used Vegas winnings nice free meal boy happy!  Two items town     Beef Wellington Crab Legs!  yummy good   It would 5 star buffet but desserts very good  <EOR> Probably better buffets far  around $23 tremendous buffet lunch  Highlights include assortment fresh greens veggies salads pizza flank steak accompanied mashed potatoes roasted baby mushrooms! shrimp cocktail  desserts looked incredible but only average unfortunately cheesecake quite good though!  The only disappointing thing didn't crab legs prime rib lunch apparently dinner only  would recommend place highly! early though lines brutal  <EOR> Steadily going downhill  only reason gets 4 instead 3 because inclusion ostrich which never before shockingly good  duck! steak!   Drink service night fairly poor Vegas standards   Highlights continue ample sushi selection carvery  salad dessert bar lagging behind times  price think M Buffet better deal almost similar quality items plus free alcohol  quality Wynn Buffet really starting pull ahead  <EOR> Preface review am long time fan Vegas buffet  group 6 March 26 2016 dinner  enjoyed quality taste food but half group considered slightly above average  Bellagio cheap but few bucks less buffets Caesar's Wynn  Crab legs good caviar ok prime rib rack lamb good sushi bad street tacos good service ok deserts good above average    consistent quality range choices albeit near Caesar's  $44 person equated 2 hours dining  Definitely good choice Vegas buffet  Foodie out  <EOR> Well people officially given buffets   seems only difference casino casino simply price   theory only cook much food time before begins taste bland watered down   say fan would understatement   Besides roasted quail few deserts buffet straight sucked   If visiting Vegas strong desire whole strip buffet thing would highly recommend Wynn buffet only buffet could say sincerely enjoyed being around same price hope would right decision  <EOR> came lunch price wasn't bad all $22 person perhaps lunch price dinner price    maybe outta season maybe lunch time thing but no alaskan crab legs???? nooooo      good variety kick ass sushi hand rolls most desserts super tasty and tried every dessert   <EOR> Not huge fan buffets really sure why came    wait ridiculous usual 40 min? Sat morning  probably better buffets Vegas definitely decently priced Wynn $35 $25 although selection isn't large  <EOR> Let start saying Oh  My  God  never stood line half hours dinner before   Moving on    boyfriend fan buffets but hearing Gourmet Dinner Kobe beef he willing try  steak very good buffet standards although $40 you'd expect them good choose medium rare well done medium rare tender juicy  lamb good but taste very strong overwhelmed second slice  also serve regular steaks wellingtons   The Mac Cheese AWFUL totally tasteless  tried few pieces each pastas none them tasted memorable  around whole circle place took spoonful most dishes serving nothing really stood other various steaks    Now must talk desserts  Why? Because love them if don't skip ahead  Cheesecake oh very good  melts your mouth flavor rich but same time isn't overwhelming all  Must try! Carrot cake standard flavorful much icing  Tarts various different tarts but didn't quite them  Lime Tart super sour  Tiramisu tasted more coffee mousse but bad  Chocolate cake very good! chocolate flavor very rich  Caramel Pudding pudding lacking taste caramel sauce couldn't really save either   All all sure we'd back when visit Vegas again mainly due unimaginably long lines but if you're steak dessert lover good place go! <EOR> This probably better buffet's strip but kind pricey   love items wouldn't normally see such kobe beef ostrich elk   also liked spicy tuna hand rolls shrimps already peeled   Everything pretty good just wish bigger storage space stomach   best way save some money probably come 30minutes hour before dinner starts only pay lunch time prices then slowly eat lounge around until dinner starts up   Then getting 2 meals price 1  <EOR> The receptionist really rude  morning brunch while friend regular line Mlife line ask if Mlife member could served seat right away meanwhile wasn't sure if am member haven't Vegas while she said yes Mlife VIP member  Ok back regular line checked see if Mlife member found received lots emails membership#  back VIP line again showe emails but she started feeling annoyed impatient didn't wanna assist but said VIP means accumulate 25k points something that new members qualified  Alright understand but thing she didn't even wanna Check could sure VIP? does VIP member must show VIP card? receptionist supposed friendly smile least right?

What's love? restaurant inside Bellagio there's slight sense grandeur atmosphere very nice  prices however slightly high quality food presented  steaks average rice nigiri felt slightly overdone  incredible variety though really enjoyed desserts  would come back but perhaps during holiday weekend as prices raised   <EOR> I some pretty high expectations buffet disappointed  price 30 per person weekday considering buffets' location expect better  food just OK  Some highlights already pealed shrimp prime rib some pasta's  Some low lights Chinese food sushi desserts  Chinese food crap sushi sub par although large selection  dessert stations looked nice but food itself wasn't good  now BIGGEST low light  crab legs  some high expectations them including love when saw already cracked open all needed your fork could just remove meat eat  problem    they frozen solid  took two legs let them rest few mins figuring would thaw ok   they far gone frozen  Honestly just crappy  very disappointed whole thing especially place price  <EOR> Not sure why Buffet Bellagio highly rated  waited hour into mostly empty buffet Food lackluster particularly bad sushi rice cold hard BBQ chicken BBQ sauce tasted McDonalds packets snow crab snow crab never good but theirs small no flavor   Also wine crazy expensive $17 glass Chardonnay? did mention all you can drink special which only few dollars more single glass but didn't actually say much each glass is  star desserts which tasty  <EOR> I enjoyed buffet many times fine   Plenty good offerings prime rib Indian food potatoes all versions eggs benedict shrimp being favorite treats   crab legs generate line evening   Unlike Sterling Brunch Wynn buffet buffet good but great   desserts just OK   offerings seem change regularly   dining rooms need updated  <EOR> Disappointing   few years ago confidently say quality gone downhill   large selection food but diverse delicious used be   food still good but great   presentation decent but probably great terms food handling   shrimp cocktail particularly bad sitting directly huge pile ice which looked nice but made shrimp taste ice    which tastes nothing   tub cocktail sauce spilled all over warm also less appetizing   desserts final straw looked amazing but tasted terribly seriously inedible   service slow slightly forgetful   entire place needs facelift carpets getting gross tables decor outdated need repair    Again food good but great better options specifically would recommend Wicked Spoon next door Cosmopolitan   Bellagio going work much harder compete  <EOR> If you've already read review Buffet Wynn then short  Bellagio Buffet essentially become staple visit Vegas seems satisfy every need wants when comes buffet this  made reference choice between Buffet Wynn Buffet Bellagio each win win situation but definitely believe win more Bellagio buffet  If pepsi coke challenge Bellagio coke   in tall glass ice   on hot summer day  If find yourself dilemma inability choose between Wynn Bellagio especially first timers best advice try both find better   The gist PROS Everything buffet should have  CONS Lines could long especially holidays  early ride lunch time into dinner  Especially useful if you're ballin' budget  Prices also everyones budget  <EOR> My son lunch yesterday   food pretty good   bit pricey but when you're vegas casino there's nothing cheap right?  $42 dollars both us   think probably could found off strip steakhouse eaten better less   But hey we're vacation right?  did manage subsidize some meal handing some $10 dollar lap dances some passing women okay guy but he dressed woman didn't know until halfway through dance    don't want talk anymore  nutshell good lots selection but money if you're just wanting lunch gorge yourself   Find nicer sit down restaurant off strip  <EOR> 3 stars     could better  don't cold crab legs  cut through middle suppose easier eat bad idea! them taste water!

Servers come around ensure enough drink coffee soda water sure tip!    Now food quality isn't bad   mean buffet food can't expect gourmet individual dining but wasn't spectacular   Most seasonings bland to cater masses but coming buffet almost must if come Vegas    Just try leave place without protruding gut  <EOR> Absolutely phenomenal  crab steak tartar Kobe beef standouts me  Great experience! must Vegas  <EOR> The buffet Bellagio exactly expected   Quantity Quality   thing hoping just step higher other buffets terms selection food typical run mill selections   But don't wrong food items good quality never ran out  service very good cleanliness buffet areas dining areas impeccable   For value paid for  family enjoyed stuffed   definitely back but heard Cesar's Palace buffet he best   We'll see  <EOR> A theme park but truly best meal life far YUM!! only wish would arrived much earlier could eaten faster  think some people around thought hadn't food week  Don't miss out! <EOR> $40 am stuffed! Chicken waffle breading candied apples crab legs! Yes! loved it  There's much choose eat something different every time up! <EOR> Sorry worst buffet ever ate  didn't smell good food when hit door  carpet smelled mildew  Easter special started early would thought food would least half decent  sushi bar   wait forgot no sushi bar  Actually but better sushi whole foods even grocery store  Save your money  McDonald's  <EOR> We ate because free room  two days row same exact food  nice convenience  staff great  sat bar nice  Bartender very nice knowledgeable  <EOR> This place packed but didn't enjoy eating experience  dimly lit no windows  old decor dead ambiance made feel any run of the mill buffet  The food okay but good regular restaurant  might try buffet another restaurant next time <EOR> The line around corner took 40 minutes before seated table   say besides snow crab other limited seafood disappointed   Since don't eat red meat other choices just weren't good expected   ended eating lots veggies couple asian dishes okay   dessert fruit selections impressive however   service very good attentive   definitely better buffets also lot cheaper  <EOR> This place gross disgusting dirty complete rip off  serving counters filthy close together you're  rubbing derrière total strangers  NEVER eat overpriced dump again  don't even serve real ice cream here! Aria buffet clean deeeeeelicious!!! <EOR> Why 3 stars?  Its because ive bacchanal ceasar palace if compare two  bacchanal far greater bellagio    Price check  Bellagio = $30+ Bacchanal = $59$  Just add 20 more regret it! = Goodluck buffet hunters!   Happy feasting! <EOR> This always favorite place eat Vegas  eating different places since variety spice life  But always end coming back buffett  favorite memories having champagne brunch friends first time Vegas when 23  hung table 4 hours! <EOR> D*mmit! breakfast  impressed? No  Cause can't wrong scramble eggs sausage bacon etc  Ahhhh  <EOR> The ONLY reason buffet gets 4 stars because cannot eat cold crab legs   Other Bellagio 5 times past 3 years while vacation   pricey if during weekends when serve gourmet dinner     I liked dinner selection because very impressive selection great   food fresh clean   What liked best lunch selection   only $20 but yet almost same selection food would during dinner   stuffed eating lunch passed even dinner   dessert selection awesome   I've Mandalay Bay Wynn I'd say best far overall selection   If specifically crab legs eater then bang your buck Mandalay Bay  <EOR> Yummy!  Wonderful selection food    I really liked section pre made salads    The seafood meat good   Pace yourself because if eat much soon wont able enjoy all!  Good service too  <EOR> This place awesome during Sunday Brunch   admit first buffet where everything taken sample actually eaten finished   Most buffets sample if don't dish just leave venture off another dish   first buffet where cleaned plate every dish tried   Good job Bellagio!!!  worth every penny during Sunday Brunch  <EOR> I am impressed everyone else   sushi favorite yet disappointed it   find meats dry any pasta rubbery   Snow crabs legs good king crab legs tasted fishy   really crowded hard see everything tables   desserts merely ok delicious enough called desserts   sick 2 hours eating here   Wynn's buffet better  <EOR> One word Chilean Seabass  Very friendly staff amazed waitress refilled drinks took all plates smile face  If knew many plates through you'd amazed well  Then manager saw disappointment fresh strawberries put away brought large bowl strawberries just also smile face    Sure crab legs dark spots them  might've tasted ammonia  But everything else great!  Wynn used go to buffet but think enough better Bellagio justify price  don't even Chilean Seabass   So $20 30 price point Bellagio place go! <EOR> Mass quantiles name game when comes buffets often cost quality however case here   My friend making less sober stagger across strip when saw signs buffet sounded great  $38 tax cheap   to person does eat meat often buffet's seem rip off but felt bandit   There sushi area your usual rolls nigiri hand rolls etc  real star Poke sliced raw fish tossed soy sauce scallions sesame seed oil spices  usually poke quality $12 app martini glass sized bite  opted full dinner plate great plate raw fish   Once cleaned sea all treasures explored rest buffet  Artisan cheese plate bok choy quinoa many other gourmet items could found   My friend really enjoyed kobe beef may function BAC   The dessert section also many tasting sized bites great allowing maximum amount flavors had  <EOR> We came Lunch using Vegas 2 1  discount would still say price worth paying  Upon arriving learned weekday brunch which made really excited since missed breakfast  omelet perfect country potatoes bacon  also piece French Toast but between syrup sweetness overwhelmed me  second round tried little Asian cuisine  surprise pork buns so yummy enjoyed chow menu green bean chicken broccoli  only complaint coffee  first cup coffee day tasted just awful  came dispenser machine which probably why  Other everything delicious  hope come back dinner sometime! <EOR> This bread le cirque! least tastes looks same  best part me  whole bread section amazing  buffet HUGE  decided called fishing trip! grabbed bite each 7 fish dishes had  None them where amazing but where all good  then full try anything else   We managed sneak no line but most vegas casino buffets going line during meal times   This best buffet tried vegas  <EOR> man brunch time 11am line looked long out side past restrooms but only took 20mins inside   $26 brunch breakfast lunch items solid waffles eggs really good bacon soups sushi pizza roast turkey salad fruit bars dessert bar area cereal bar area pretty good amount food feel its cheap big hotel buffet great before walk down strip! <EOR> Not nearly worth $42+ spent dinner just myself Tuesday  When using card machine asked tip before even entered buffet  Granted $0 option but asking tip before even seated really poor form  Especially establishment Bellagio  being seated wondered tipping exactly  1 minute interaction cashier 30 second interaction hostess rarely saw busser  call busser instead server because he didn't serve anything  Even drinks self serve machines  say again am tipping for? If am tipping front money divided if don't even know where seated? little interaction staff nice polite  Now food  felt quality ingredients good but flavor just meh  Kung Pao Chicken ok but didn't really taste Chinese food  honestly flavor Panda Express better  tasted kind bland  Pasta better Chinese food but still just ok  carving station food pretty good pizza good buffet pizza  caviar station but mini waffle put dry completely took all moisture mouth  sushi flavorless  fish seemed fresh but rice consistency half hardened clay no flavor  couldn't taste any rice wine vinegar  word sushi seasoned rice if rice isn't flavored you've all wrong  tuna salmon poke good but needed more flavor   Don't bother buffet  Overrated understatement place  Better eat place actually serves tastes better casts less  If really want spend bunch buffet Wynn Buffet  couple bucks cheaper food WAY better   I haven't Bellagio buffet 10 years since felt overrated back then  Gave another try thinking might improved but actually worse  don't think ever need come back  much better food Vegas same price range cheaper  <EOR> We weekend Vegas girlfriends total disaster food disgusting cold  tasted leftovers paid $28 nothing  Would recommend!! waste your time money going there <EOR> Incredibly indulgent experience  crab legs die truffle pizza guilty pleasure mine  Really classy buffet especially good if you've few drinks first stir your hunger  say desserts so so but stuffed enough then anyway care  <EOR> We buffet because remember being fabulous 10 years ago  Unfortunately did live expectations  food good price very good selection mediocre presentation ok  waitress kept water filled throughout meal  baby back ribs good  watermelon outstanding juicy sweet  sorbet dispenses machine good  egg Benedict good flavor but soggy    Overall would come back if wanted fabulous buffet  would come back because price good convenient  <EOR> Not good Bacchanal over Caesars but nonetheless still yummy    Again massive buffet find something eat  If can't then you're damn picky!   Same Bacchanal dove right into crab legs  Ugh never enough those suckers   I think around $50 person    <EOR> Stark Wonderful contrast previous nights buffet Aria  Take look review see mean   Everything Bellagio seems perfect know its but business perception everything!!!  Last night first visit Bellagio buffet think third although always great last nights experience exceptional   I started nice salad bleu cheese amazing greens dried cranberries light vinaigrette some wonderful flatbread croutons  Followed visit caviar station well informed server served delicious bite caviar sour cream fresh made bellini   I tasted few pastas 2 bites 4 different ones all great but Prime Rib pasta sublime its rich 2 bites leave craving more right now!!!  The carving stations looked great Prime Rib being cut thick but passed meats seafood  Starting sushi super fresh ahi served perfect rice may just touch thick  Piles excellent steamed clams could served best seafood restaurants anywhere hot steamy Snow crab cut perfect served plentiful cooked perfection   Lots dessert choices favorite carrot cake don't pass up  good!!!  The real reason epic dining experience though wonderful service  sat table near bar saw many servers interacting each other  all great spirits seemed each other if just perception still good table being taken care very kind efficient lady treated king!!! rarely mention servers name but Evelia made visit Bellagio highlight trip  kindness excellent service skills rank top 190 Yelp reviews  10 stars service!!!! <EOR> after seating rented minivan i swear never ever minivan even if become soccer mom 6 kids almost 5 hours all wanted food lots it   harassed forced girls visit favorite buffet place world bellagio buffet   vegas everything bigger life itself all things done true sin city style metamorphosed into pig committed sin gluttony   must say avoid sushi all cost kobe bbq beef tastes rather some cheap ass chicken tough dry   however creme brulee almost good ny plaza hotel's   yummy!!!  o absolutely hate buffet yet tried almost every buffet las vegas nothing parallels bellagio yet   wish people realize bad buffet is   how fat greedy wasteful   but then again vegas stuff normally wouldn't ready unbutton your pants leave least 2 hour gap your schedule truly enjoy food your money's worth  <EOR> DEFINITELY worth money   I'm fan crab didn't even bother wasting stomach space COLD crab legs moved pastas salads meats sushi Everything else pretty bland      Sushi selection horrible  All saw salmon tuna  mean sushi pretty fresh but sitting ball MUSHED rice    =______=  took glance rolls impressed all   The only things memorable were Prime rib kobe beef pesto mashed potatoes grilled vegetables napoleon dessert   it   I really understand people rave best buffets LV  <EOR> A requisite Vegas buffet experience IMO second Vegas faves list Le Village @ Paris [http www yelp com biz le village buffet las vegas#hrid W7aoVNIZ1KeVYlTDfAqNrQ]   As part annual summer Vegas trip dinner Buffet @ Bellagio become staple Day 2 itinerary smartly scheduled anticipation collective hangovers first evening appetite debilitating   Buffets quandary me   Stocky brutish may appear actually much much heftier before being mindful weight diet usually counter intuitive all things all eat    Even some power discipline try just more uncommon dishes little delectable tastes lots extravagant foods enjoyed WITHOUT getting stuffed         all its hard maintain little bit cute going Vegas cute always on    _________________________ Oh Vegas   super secksified people even gluttony inducing troves culinary delight    <EOR> I admit best buffet Vegas compared others around same price     The lines horrendous but managed hands few comp VIP passes only wait 5 mins other food selection great very tasty      There hug selection food meat italian sushi salad bar neverending dessert bar yummy crab legs   everything satisfy your needs here   It VERY crowded dinner time once twice felt someone going bump plate   thaaat crowded  <EOR> Very good food Everything tastes fresh just made unlike traditional buffets which serve old food reheated stuff  Even salmon tasted fresh grilled Highly recommend it Just sure bring appetite <EOR> I am sure if quality down just mentality where think Vegas strip food overpriced but place okay    Food Mac cheese friend raved truffle mac cheese and love truffles but mac cheese definitely did truffles any other mac cheese  Bacon probably gave place extra star  really great  thick cut bacon crispy perfection   Prime Rib dry   Steak meh Desserts typical selection  banana foster basically sugar   Sushi dinner sashimi rolls    It buffet quality always downgraded but place known best strip  <EOR> I came because recommended several people glad did  came wife cousin brunch although already 12 00 p m  all three very satisfied  came Saturday before President's Day which apparently holiday buffet which means increase price $41 per person bottomless champagne mimosas   definitely worth it  food great did suffer quality flavor as most buffet entrees do champagne good some cheap bottle you'll regret hour two brunch  highlights table in no particular order omelet station hand rolled spicy tuna prime rib  <EOR> Very nice restaurant   A very wide variety cuisines all excuisite flavor!

Dessert bar really good really enjoyed classic cheesecake   2 hours later walked satisfied just time Water Show! <EOR> I ate both lunch dinner services recent trip Las Vegas really pleased! found pleasant variety pretty fresh food buffet  find buffet  along Cravings Mirage  to better more affordable buffets strip   The dinner service incredible seafood selections  four different types ceviches every single them delicious  also ate marinara pasta served dinner ate plateful it  Bellagio knows pasta!  My only complaint food organization seems little wild  favorite things Cravings Mirage patrons choose which section buffet want visit based ethnic  type  mirage if you're mood salad salad section     if want Chinese Chinese section     if want Italian Italian section on  Bellagio no signs clear cut divisions walk around buffet several times gather idea where everything wanted was  only minor gripe though!  Other foods distinctly remember because scrumptious tasted roasted squash marinated mushrooms  mushrooms available both lunch dinner while squash available during lunch  squash slightly sweet due brown sugar coating perfectly caramelized  would never expected eat such great squash dish buffet  Usually vegetables buffets boring low taste but Bellagio! definitely visit Bellagio meals again  <EOR> This buffet just ordinary compared other ones there  Nothing special all  many other good places eat wouldnt waste meal here  <EOR> I think lot better then buffet Wynn    around same price even cheaper   I loved cocktail shrimps prime ribs deserts   Their Crème brûlée so good  think best ever had    Their deserts good think actually worth price only that  Tips ready spend 30 60 mins wait in    <EOR> Not your average buffet  Lamb beef chimichurri sauce sushi pastas salads vegetables all kinds breads desserts etc  would think you're eating gourmet establishment  <EOR> Best buffet ever  although even 4 30 PM stand line hour  Cost $37 when better some $45 buffets LA  All you can eat Macarons? Yes indeed  <EOR> My favorite buffet world  am vegetarian salads Bellagio works art  Such creativity quality ingredients  buffet manages present true gourmet cuisine buffet  freshness outstanding  <EOR> Best buffet ever food wise       However cannot give perfect score because quite pricey buffet   It's even more expensive Sunday brunch $$ add fast when u family   Overall place must try atleast once for sheer selection taste but better choices bang for your buck places there  <EOR> What disappointment  variety food horrible  Nothing tasted fresh  12 people came 450 which expected but little bit quality food  Service  only thing would say good here  wait 40 minutes  would never come back buffet  better food other buffets here <EOR> Very very pricey but worth especially when know 88 chefs made your breakfast lunch  grand alright  Lots desserts some sushi turkey steak oatmeal regular cereal grits soups some chinese food fried stuff  Kind stuff would see regular buffet just presented nicely    Loved blueberry muffins green mashed potatoes turkey  Everything else just ok    Go experience    $27 brunch where ever going that? <EOR> 4 stars because super starving! Actually very good  around 5pm  No line  Great food  prime rib 2 slice kobe steak! Delicious  Melt mouth  red potato cook perfection  know vegas many buffets but top list  gf no complain  She devour sushi said best dessert ever! stuff fit any dessert  left hour later line wrap til front entrance  left gamble n lost some money! reality expensive buffet us  Haha  No really bill $65 something  <EOR> Please keep mind first time any Las Vegas buffets    That being said GOOD GOD LORD BABY JESUS SWEET ALLAH HOLY BUDDHA  everything wanted more  came 1pm still breakfast food available! Since came during st paddy's day weekend pay holiday lunch price even though wasn't st paddy's day which $35 person  Still bad! additional $12 person if wanted unlimited domestic drinks beers bloody Mary's mimosas    So anyways seated quickly able food while drinks way    HIGHLY RECOMMEND prime steak eggs Benedict eclair strawberry tart salad pizza  I would stay away seafood wasn't great but selection nonetheless GREAT  would highly recommend buffet anyone looking pig Vegas! <EOR> What happened? great when last visited 8 years ago   I made visit May couldnt believe much changed   in bad way  Food should hot all cold lukewarm pizza soggy meat hard chew gave up  Finally found hair dessert  disgusting   I called waitress she apologized called manager  He came offered champagne but politely declined  never return  <EOR> I don't know anyone could rate buffet anything less 5 stars!  Now tried several buffets throughout Vegas thought already made mind favourite   WRONG   While certain items better other buffets Like Wynn's Gelato station salads Paris' massive dessert section   macaroons creme brulee    wow would still pick Bellagio buffet because its entrees   all entrees usually look forward most rather appetizers desserts   We 4 00 which shame because could've come 30 min earlier lunch price  Oh well!  definitely ate over $36 food anyway well worth it   waited line Saturday evening only 20 30 minutes around time because tired starving Tao Beach   just wanted veg out!  seated quickly orders taken drinks jiffy!    Swordfish Quail King Crab Snow Crab TUNA POKE    oh god   real life?  heard Beef Wellington quite good but really red meat beef pork kind person didn't try did want waste any precious space stomach!    My point  try it   course expensive but worth it!  first two times came Vegas shitty buffet Imperial Palace which worse Fresh Choice Souplantation did any buffet all which greatly regret!  Normal food Vegas not fast food expensive anyway I'd rather indulge bit REAL meal     I learned lesson   Now usually eat buffets around lunchtime then don't buy food rest day Yay! <EOR> Had buffet dinner 3 weeks ago  spectacular  never seen much food life  just everything added plate good  think paid around 30 00 per person thought worth every penny  early though we arrived 6pm no line 90 minutes later unbelievable!! sure try little everything  Otherwise you'll feel deprived  Enjoy! <EOR> Not quite sure why reviews slipping but still prefer Bellagio favorite buffet hit Vegas  Bucchanal close 2nd though  Bucchanal charges much more Bellagio serve terms unique food items   Buffets Vegas Bellagio Bucchanal Caesars Cravings Mirage Wicked Spoon Wynn   I always come Chilean sea bass  seafoody any buffet serves fish wins me  last time came didn't Gourmet Dinner concept which presume added Beef Wellington Kobe beef Duck breast Caviar Alaskan King crab legs Yes  right Alaskan Snow crab legs which much cheaper price per lb   Now let's down what's good Beef wellington absolutely amazing here  ate many slices this  Cooked perfectly medium rare perfect crusting wrapped around beef tenderloin  Definitely recommending getting item   Kobe beef surpisingly good  very lean dry  asked if could more rare side but didn't offer it  Kind surprised  waited next batch noticed more red time around gave another chance but stil very try tough  expecting marbly piece meat  Maybe incorrectly labelled  Kobe beef expecting all =S Would try item again   Chilean Seabass amazing always  Did change bit last time came which 4 years ago  expensive piece fish unfortunately other popular buffets serve  again reason itself choose Bellagio buffet over overs those seafood lovers   Alaskan King Crab Snow Crab legs very mediorce  Starting appreciate frozen then thawed crab legs  lack real crab taste super salty  love crab legs but unfortunately come down point where need just them fresh enjoy it  Frozen crab legs just don't count anymore difference taste far much now   Prime rib amazing always better prime ribs served compared other buffets think  beef juice horseradish it  always multiple slices everytime come here  Definitely recommend trying it! sure medium rare more rare! Anything cooked above medium rare just waste meat!  Caviar variety okay but maybe just caviar kind guy  tried all 3 them caviars  Flying fish roe Salmon roe Sturgeon roe black caviar   all very salty much desired flavor  pass next time come but worth try guess since something new added Gourmet Dinner   also tried Steak Tartare which okay  very appetizing though because straight looks raw ground beef some seasoning it  faint hearted  I'd still give try since usually offered during non Gourmet meals   I still think go to buffet  wouldn't mind going Bucchanal again well but think Bellagio buffet more memorable items come back compared rest  <EOR> I told myself next trip Vegas gonna try nicer buffets Strip  husband stayed Paris choice between Wicked Spoon Buffet  While intrigued Wicked Spoon's mac cheese bar Bellagio   We waited line 45 minutes Monday night  worth wait  prime rib awesome Kobe sirloin even better  cold shrimp fresh pasta lots flavor  Even sea bass good never eat sea bass  tried four desserts favorite tiramisu  only thing didn't much shrimp paella but  very minor quibble    Overall great food server really nice even when she forgot water definitely best buffet we'd ever eaten at point anyway   definitely worth splurge    although Friday Sat  prices seem bit steep  <EOR> Worth wait money  Here's tip if there's long line there's only two sneak hostess front ask sit bar   you won't wait long! much variety top quality food  lunch maybe why didn't crab legs those might served only dinner   <EOR> I generally think buffets waste money  mean many plates food eat? five other girlfriends long night drinking gambling  needed some food   The food spread impressive  really something everyone here    breakfast lunch dinner foods  stuck eggs benedict shimp cocktail some fruit but between six good sampling food    The dessert section control  Crembrulee eclairs chocolate raspberry ganace cake profiteroles    all  Next time stick section only <EOR> The Bellagio Buffet did good selection food but unfortunately much lukewarm and thus very enjoyable    I'm vegetarian quite few options marinara pasta Mac cheese pizza salad mashed potatoes broccolini breads desserts etc  Unfortunately pastas pizzas all lukewarm very edible   My husband meat eater found same few meats  But he loved sushi crab legs prime rib   The redeeming parts buffet though service desserts   Our waiter extremely unobtrusive while also keeping plates cleared drinks filled remaining pleasant smiling  Big win there   The desserts also quite tasty  few sugar free gluten free options special diets win! also some delectable carrot cake fruit tarts mini waffle cups Nutella white chocolate cream   Overall good desserts service overall selection just wish would improve temperature food  <EOR> This far best buffet Vegas  First off love Hotel walking thru hallways just nice  set Buffett waiters course food outstanding  loved mashed potatoes oatmeal eggs benedict price ok  Way better buffet Wynn!!! <EOR> Came Saturday  Buffet worth $43 99 gourmet buffet  disappointed  enough selection opinion  desserts good though  <EOR> Absolutely divine!!!!

I would back alternative Bacchanal <EOR> Oh look Oh wow look Where start  start delicious soups miso egg drop chicken noodle tomato basil corn chowder clam chowder  maybe salads Oh wait look marinated olives cheese balls basil pesto sauce pasta salads  Man look size those shrimps  wherever start buffet able end because many selections gourmet entrees  Food satisfy tempt your taste buds  Did mention sushi selections? might better buffets lost wages but yet find any better Buffet Bellagios  <EOR> Loved buffet   fish eating vegetarian ok pescatarian all you can eat buffets rarely good deal but definitely money's worth one      There tons interesting non meat options beyond abundance salads pastas also less common place grains noodles well prepared vegetables available    Loved unlimited sushi    desserts plentiful tasty      I wish hadn't 1 hour wait Monday night March but only complaint  <EOR> The buffet like all buffets Vegas accessible through casino   arrived around 10 40am during week no line all   payed less $20 person little breakfast lunch dessert all rolled into fatty brunch   breakfast lunch food flip started happening around 11am     The breakfast pretty standard lots American options waffles omelets oatmeal fruit etc   seemed lot breakfast food stations side just repeat other side   Most breakfast lukewarm best all satisfying     The lunch food better slightly more variety   still disappointed some food got   lukewarm pizza overly bloody prime rib literally bleeding plate   ended beefing plate mostly seafood items Chinese buffet station where food hot flavorful   I huge sweet tooth hit dessert counter more than   er twice   But mostly because many desserts individually plated tiny little plates which made difficult hold more 4 tiny plates trip sharing everything hubby little   seriously needed tray   mission try everything apple bars cheesecake fudge brownies carrot cake eclairs mousses chocolate covered strawberries fruit tarts crème brûlée bread pudding cookies ice cream etc   If would known going enjoy desserts much would held back mediocre breakfast lunch foods worn stretchy pants   yes come any excuse validate actions eat obscene amount dessert buffet   Hands down best part meal dessert! <EOR> Its 2 30 am stuck  hotel room yellping iPhone  because Bellagio buffet tore insides out  Oh look watch jurrasic park rather drunkenly roaming strip  Thanks Bellagio buffet  <EOR> I come every time visit Vegas mostly amazing beef wellington delicious desserts! sure check ahead time sure they're serving beef wellington because menu every day  place itself does look very big but waiters servers very nice  Fridays Saturdays Gourmet Dinner days but best lunch meal stay dinner because price difference HUGE  Think linner lunch + dinner    There's always line king crab legs  They're already cracked open very easy eat  I don't know if buttery topping Wynn though cocktail shrimp also really good  Prime rib bloody side last time rotisserie chicken dry but usual beef wellington does fail  perfectly cooked very tender  Avoid variety fishes near Chinese food though because usually dry  sushi plain side too    The dessert selection very varied looks fancy  favorite small glass cup multiple layers  There's light brown layer under beige layer tastes coffee chocolate covered whipped cream  forget name but delicious! Avoid raspberry cream chocolate bites top though tastes really sour! creme brulee chocolate covered strawberries look simple but they're really good!  Note Apparently you're allowed take photos food  attempted take photo dessert station because just looked delicious artistic love taking photos food but chef behind counter told no photos  Maybe they're afraid somehow figure all secret recipes simply looking photos  *shrug*  I'm sure if absolute best buffet Vegas since all food incredible but every place its pros cons  give four because all years still look forward coming here! <EOR> I rate place 3 stars because didn't leave impression me   There kobe beef good part could unlimited amounts which friends all did 40 50 bucks per person worth it  haha  There soup thank goodness  don't remember seeing eating icecream     well anyways if compare buffet aria buffet I'd eat Arias ANYDAY! <EOR> The brunch AWESOME!  measly 28 bucks stuff your face bottomless mimosas and OJ them good! second time definitely back   food awesome too   would try dinner buffet sometime    <EOR> We just walked door Vegas 180 previous review   I've eaten Bellagio buffet over dozen times past all werrre good   But trip terrible   town biz took boss     The shrimp hard   frozen just hard   2 kinds sushi   Empty pans platters picked clean when never replenished hour spent   Theirslider burgers which like   4 trays turkey depsite signs said beef sliders    asked where beef ones? man said all turkey   said know pointed signs   He said take care sir     2 minutes later back 4 trays OLD turkey sliders still there    he removed signs!   solution   Those same sliders under lights hour no eating them   Yet stayed   It worst buffet experience ever Vegas   boss salmon he said tasted nasty ham   We mentioned waitress   She told other people complaining too   asked manager money back   She obliged   that   Yes know anyone bad day   But whole buffet bad except carving station   OK   Would return?  Unlikely I'd through effort give another shot   restaurant house cards   Takes lots cards build but only send crashing down  <EOR> Really Really large selection   Great value price  Top notch food  <EOR> Went back gourmet weekend dinner  Friggin amazing  Seriously    A sampling incredible food crab legs served cold cut half didn't crack them that alone made boost five stars ostrich so good elk ribeye yummy strange pretzel rolls steak tartare various sashimi lots really yummy grilled veggies perfect seasoning many kinds lamb hand rolls bread pudding  mushroom truffle ravioli lobster ravioli  I didn't beef wellington tuna tartare little bland  Cheesecake disappointing  <EOR> Very good buffet price $38 huge selection   waiter William very attentive purchased $14 99 unlimited drinks William never let drinks empty   Definitely would recommend  <EOR> Enh  thoroughly impressed  waffles pancakes French toast tough stale  some pre made salads bitter  Everything else decent  especially cookies Japanese cuisine  guess can't fairly low price $26+tax   Otherwise wasn't impressed style layout  Also lighting sucks IMO  Maybe used best buffet Vegas but think Wynn top spot lockdown! <EOR> I've grazed buffets Mandalay Bay Fremont Street Bellagio's offering good middle of the road choice   For best results choose Bellagio dinner when Snow King Crab legs steal show   already cut half lengthwise luscious meat easy enjoy   One unique feature Bellagio stand allow seating bar area  $8 they'll serve all selected adult beverages you'd like  since you're sitting bar service quick!  Bellagio's sometimes creative takes dishes miss mark  Pesto mashed potatoes may look good paper but recommend passing  Sushi seemed little meh  some offerings sit dishes longer should   On other hand Bellagio's carving station often features exceptionally flavorful flank steak prefer over standard prime rib  <EOR> After morning TAO BEACH mayhem friends headed over Bellagio Buffet figuring food going great water show WRONG    We during transition period scoring selection late lunch early dinner price lunch also upgraded endless glass champagne    DISAPPOINTMENT all around   where begin? champagne just brut wine      domestic stuff    I know know should known better considering price  decor lighting dark very generic Hometown Buffet  kind expected them carry Bellagio theme throughout ENTIRE hotel   how silly assume such things poor transition lunch dinner  times where stations empty   that would never happen Wynn salmon doused bbq sauce! Fish delicate why earth would drench bbq sauces?!?!?!  Things saved meal being complete waste money * dessert array say good but least wide selection  * sushi stay away nigiri pieces just doesn't look right however seaweed salad good poke selection  * frisee spinach salad walnuts cranberries  * mac cheese w bread crumbs perfect size taste  Atmosphere terrible Price pay  Overall Don't count comeback shell extra $10 eat Wynn your stomach taste buds thank you  <EOR> This spot great  thought wynn buffet best  But know place many options many seafood dishes  love clams crab every single vegetable dish have  delicious words hardly describe yummy tastes  Wynn buffet basically eight dollars more granted good buffet but its something buffet better  am foodie all way but know when place superior flavors superior food  place fits bill  <EOR> Dinner   coming having wait almost hour half food damn good     My buddy kept telling everyone line crowd @$$ raping because line super long food wasn't expected good he's cranky when he's hungry     But once sat down food constant drubbing complaints replaced silence mmm  ooo  yum      Hands down best buffets Vegas  <EOR> Finally try Kobe beef taste like  soft chewy!

Definitely not  just might find myself again decent meal if want avoid paying $55 Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet  <EOR> I came brunch wait long line  finished eating found line gotten even longer  Overall impressed brunch  Dinner much better but also more costly  Wynn Wicked Spoon lunch buffets days before way spoiled selection those other places had  buffet atmosphere cafeteria which total disconnect high mighty establishment  although don't mind servers personal other comparable buffets   Lunch starts around 12 1  when next set menu items set out  would include sushi seafood some roasted meats  But even brunch some meaty dishes  stir fry prime rib miso soup  liked rice porridge fixings well  All standard offerings fruit eggs breads pastries oatmeal too  desserts lackluster   The bottomless champagne $5 good deal but all bubbly take room stomach beware! made own mimosas asking orange juice but orange juice served pulp free  grapefruit juice pretty good though  <EOR> Would totally come just eat dozens Alaskan King Crab Legs! other food buffet most all right  <EOR> After waiting line 45 mins paying over $75 wife myself hoping impressed    Well not  Buffet average best  expected food served hot but most warm room temperature  Ate almost whole meal without drink refill  ask waiter twice before finally them filled but then pretty much done eating  first piece prime rib very good juicy back but second piece dry  Some things good but nothing stood great  Other Vegas buffets cheaper better  Don't think back   <EOR> My friend brunch before wanted try it  line long but moved fast  There's varied selection choose from  main choices sushi bacon watermelon even though tried little bit lot food  experience wasn't over the top but neither expectations  glad experienced brunch Bellagio but many other places try Vegas  <EOR> This used favorite buffet Vegas until discovered Cravings Buffet Mirage Casino  But save different review    As Buffet Bellagio if time right crowd wonderful  buckets ice cold already cracked Alaskan King Crab legs excellent  Aside sea food Asian food section Italian food Meat station salad bar sushi bar various breads dessert bar  Over all food really good variety pretty vast   *I would only come dinner  breakfast food disappointing  rating solely off dinner selection  <EOR> Overrated  used be  wait 2 hours food all food just ok  Spend your money somewhere else spend less time waiting  <EOR> Oh man  place death family  Every time we're Vegas always stop here    The food amazing utmost quality  Everything just really good  All meat prime rib beef wellington kobe beef etc crab legs seafood ec  even buffet guy any means but place exception    Usually pretty long line but lucky skip line most time <EOR> I'm really much buffet person but all came lunch before left Monday  Since weekday cheaper weekend prices  Only $20 lunch buffet  wasn't line able seated right away  waiter immediately took drink ordered food    Some favorites scrambled eggs jook asparagus mushrooms Korean style kalbi tri tip smoked salmon  Some things did were lamb sushi Vietnamese spring roll  favorite part meal lined over 10 desserts all took bite all them  YUM!   Overall better experience Wynn buffet couple years ago  But again much buffet person did see favorites jook??   Service great waiter nice enough bring non dairy creamer coffee! Overall bad! just glad didn't penalize wasting food! <EOR> Georgie Chin amazing bartenders! great charisma which just adds overall appealing vibe buffet  very good selection food fast wait staff  would definitely come back establishment  <EOR> Let start saying leaving took cab driver asked day said well buffet just ate sucked balls but otherwise good day  start dining room glorified cafeteria layout food lousy general vibe place much less classy then would expect Bellagio   Now onto food yuck  tried LOT food only reason feel OK giving place star because roast turkey awesome  Aside run down Mac cheese = dry  Bread = stale  Prime rib = flavorless  crab legs tasted just defrosted horrible!!!  So waited dessert hoping would redeem buffet  end meal mom the pastry chef should fired fuck chocolate?   eclairs basically bread dough foul chocolate filling strawberry tart lacked sugar creme brûlée didn't crust!!  So moral story? F place save your money hit wicked spoon best buffet ever <EOR> Be warned Sunday brunch line absofuckinlutely ridONCULOUS say aint worth waiting line for  Aside line wasn't bad when around 11 even though banged broads front all hung over could FEEL them rolling eyes behind giant Chanel sunglasses clutching waterbottles pushing glasses glossy sleek heads giving buddy stink eye   much more amused cougars further ahead talking football bets   Once inside pay 24 bucks brunch 28 if want champagne still bargain    food excellent options endless should Vegas buffet   only drawback buffets gross people often come them fascination sneezing behind me? H1N1 anybody am just being paranoid?   I close great quote stolen another yelper treat everyone if swine flu syphilis  hope don't deter Bellagio Buffet really good  <EOR> Came Memorial Day morning some brunch indulged some breakfast lunch dessert goods  environment nice open hotel itself lobby but overall clean spacious  expect buffet but decent variety both savory sweet breakfast lunch options  higher price due holiday may worth but didn't wait line which always plus! very enjoyable satisfying meal just wish ambience bit more welcoming bright overall improved experience  <EOR> Expensive but worth long wait line  ate much food enjoyed desserts most  mmmmm    creme brulee  also soft serve icecream  seafood selection great blue fin tuna best fish ever buffet! thought buffet would totally blow diet but plenty healthy options tasted great! <EOR> Dinner great but breakfast small  Im gluten free not choice don't eat beef pork  scrambled eggs runny tasted someone poured water them  No turkey bacon times most people eat wouldn't say if turkey sausage edible  WAIT staff extremely friendly thats plus  No Vanilla yogurt only mango strawberry plain  All dinner food also during breakfast its good look  <EOR> Too bad just one off wonder   We 2nd time wasn't impressive 1st time considering price tag on par Caesars Wynn very good but paid for   The major disappointment time   No caviar few other dishes such deer say weekends but still paid $50 Xmas season looked back own photos posted also bread bowl cod gone that just photo big clams aren't big time became flavorless    Kids paid full price now ridiculous  Service people tell management cutting your tips me  need good living but your buffet gouging customers  needless say won't come back next time    No valet  Bellagio start charging $10 1 hour parking year oh am supposed wait half hours pay parking your buffet? think only great buffet strip? Um check out     A few bright spots some major favorites gone smoke salmon salmon stir fried brisket as good Caesars   Also something didn't notice deserts especially fruits suck big time almost can't find fruit station small  <EOR> 4 stars  I am STILL full type but DAMN worth it!  usually Buffets probably because handful buffets ranged mediocre The Orleans vomit inducing Treasure Island  but friend visiting town really wanted off go    We waited line 45 minutes which bit suprising Tuesday night but line moved relatively well okay  29 99 person price right around expecting   The highlight Kobe Beef! Woof! freaking good! prime rib roasted turkey also set carving stations very good well  Crab legs shrimp also tasty hell even pizza lot flavor it! Sushi solid  Manacotti great also! huge soup salad station well  Why anyone would pay 30 bones fill soup salad concept simply can't wrap haad around  But whatever    The desert station ton variety grabbed sampling each item! Unfortunatley didnt much room left point   maybe more another time    Again Tuesday night place bustling! mean freaking slammed! Kids running down aisles past tables confused little 4 foot blue haired ladies traipsing plates stacked almost foot high    I swear asian guy mess crumbs all over face around mouth piling plate line  lol  it funniest thing seen all day! wasn't just crumb two he dropped chin onto plate just shoveled food just forgot wipe before going back more!  All all very good but just can't bring myself give 5th star  wouldn't opposed coming back though filling Kobe Beef! <EOR> I wasn't very impressed place  But price $27 per person on weekends just ok  Selection isn't grand Wynn buffet but again pay for  Although say if anyone buffet  Barona Casino San Diego you'll better time half price!  The Italian portion buffet most pasta over sauced dried but  always issue when pasta left while  Japanese side? Sushi decent but again way better  side dishes over salted overly spicy which made dishes seemingly unauthentic  say though seafood fresh but weren't any crab legs when only grabbed few shrimps  Fresh sweet! American side mostly prime rib critique  small slice pleased small because wouldn't eaten anymore it  difficult cut especially since cutting felt butter knife  Seasoning lacking but cooked nice medium rare  favorite part buffets desserts? happy variety but unhappy looked better tasted  sampled half options most them sweet creamy dry    I know more affordable buffets Vegas poor college student always try find ways cutting corners saving bit  But if you're looking real Vegas place skip place  still yet find best buffet Vegas because no ever wants clubs bloated afterwards  maybe another time come Vegas just eat buffets!  Nothing special pass! <EOR> Expensive  $95 3 people brunch 9am 3pm  No child prices  Selection ok I better  Eggs benedict wasnt very good cold  enough meat selection  Desserts tasty  Expected more choices pricing  crowded transition dinner 215 300   Glad tried see all about  full but try another buffet next time  <EOR> This buffet right par buffet Wynn  upside didn't wait nearly long inside Bellagio start grubbing out  tried mainly more expensive stuff don't eat regular basis  kobe beef really good  desert bar some favorites  sushi definately worth try although wasn't level high class sushi place LA example  give 4 stars  don't think $35  <EOR> I breakfast buffet  food ok  came few years ago selections much better  <EOR> I'm sorely disappointed  mean reservations doing buffet but since many top ten lists figured good place try any  Boy wrong    Where begin  selection wasn't mind blowing array mainly Chinese Japanese Italian Mexican  food itself bland forgettable greasy  Sadly best things Chinese broccoli sea bass but even those heavily greased hard put down  crab legs still frozen  prime rib looked slab fat  desserts deceivingly pretty but tasted weird  Nothing tasted good  add insult injury when asked coffee instant!

Bellagio buffet half reason come Vegas okay maybe 10% but  only because booze takes majority    *too* expensive $35 champagne brunch TOTALLY WORTH IT   Mr  Bellagio no qualms keeping your mimosa filled brim   fact might hard time convincing them put more OJ cranberry juice whatever diluent your choice   So great   bubbly doesn't stop don't even grumble when you're falling your chair hollering awesome waitress seeing if take home us   vast majority food pretty damn delicious considering buffet   RIDICULOUS bacon  sliced off 1 4 pieces placed lovingly your plate   Next all eat shrimp which failingly try separate mass amounts syrup covering french toast   eggs benedict gets its own plate   every once awhile throw some fruit good measure   Oh coffee delicious   IT ALL DELICIOUS   don't know why always forget bring gallon ziplocks me   Stupid stupid Robin  <EOR> It could because came two three years back when quality lot better but bit disappointed selection desserts quality entrees  same time could because came Sunday dinner gourmet dinner option offered  Honestly remembering back lot more food  time around no macaroons tortes mousse  creme brule extremely watery consistency  insert sad face   I thought stood rack lambs kobe beef sea bass king crab legs white chocolate nutella cone strawberry cheesecake banana foster bread pudding  Everything else began taste same when 30 minutes into buffet  lot people line salmon maguro poke but stayed away raw seafood because buffet all  Upon leaving impressions Bellagio buffet decreased stomach unsatisfied    I would recommend trying newer buffets if you're ever town Wynn Wicked Spoon Cosmopolitan  which may temporarily become next hotel if you're real carnivore  Texas de Brazil would more satisfactory  <EOR> I bit disappointed buffet being Bellagio  selection food smaller expected  atmosphere nice however think much better buffets strip same price  <EOR> I'm pretty amazed never written review Bellagio Buffet   all Las Vegas eateries probably eaten most both brunch dinner   place where definitely eat more you're paying for   But even then really worth it?  Some meats instance pretty disappointing   time your small medallion sized cut prime rib roast beef kobe beef venison other protein back your table cold   if ask second slice always carve thinner first   The deserts no different   Thankfully they're small ones aren't hit brush aside feel bad it   You're better off stopping Jean Philippe Patisserie around corner   On other hand made order omelets pretty awesome  line never long throw lot different toppings  pizza thin crust also variety different toppings also surprisingly good   always save room two small slices   If you're comped line pass why hell not   But ever growing number world class food options Vegas where every other celebrity chef restaurant why pay overstuff yourself mediocre food? <EOR> Arrived around 10am breakfast no line seated quickly  Price $39 99 holiday pricing  Bit price gouge but whatever   Nice selection  Turkey prime rib crab legs omelet stations desserts  Normal higher end Vegas Strip buffet   I took star off because sushi literally frozen hurt teeth when bit into wasn't alot meat crab legs   Overall bad  <EOR> Me friends looking good buffet eat while working convention past week  heard Bellagio great! set there  early day off 5pm grab early dinner    We grabbed first dish all seafood sushi sea bass crab legs pretty please  decided try other things  meats other things  ribs cold dry old  friends prime  steak old cold well! other friend piece wild boar ALL fat  super disappointing long day work  Granted maybe because early dinner?

Lol <EOR> Finally chance Bellagio Buffet since hearing rave reviews buffet Bellagio casino Las Vegas   Vegas around mid day straight Bellagio checked bags straight buffet   heard buffet Bellagio around $40 but lunch $20   Good price   sat rather quickly headed off buffet   First noticed setup stations similar Rio   All Italian food station mexican food another station etc   carving station presented ham some kind stuffed chicken some type lamb which looked great but lamb person   small piece ham turkey   Both excellent   turkey very moist ham tasted honey ham   Don't recall seeing beef carving section   some type ribs great   steered away just normal foods pizzas pastas mexican food looking special foods   noticed cream cheese lox but think may staples most high end buffets   Since little early lunch still breakfast there   Grabbed couple pieces bacon   Bacon wasn't tasty bacon Venetian   excited see going put sushi 12 00   put 10 minutes early   only cali type rolls but seemed made real crab versus fake crab   some veggie rolls   Rice seemed little mushy    Asian area also some spring rolls didn't care all   bite immediately placed spring rolls trash plate   Overall glad tried Bellagio buffet but probably won't back unless dinner buffet  <EOR> Don't wrong food great      But worth $50 person    Since we're staying Bellagio hit buffet more once simply due convenience   Breakfast far best  biscuits gravy die for!   The only reason we're giving them 3 5 stars service  cashiers friendly All act if can't understand hear your half time  almost overcharged more once which simply annoying  wait staff unattentative unless look tons money   Regardless all paid same price should receive same experience  <EOR> The buffet Bellagio better kid  I recently visited again few years later thought  all have? also guess because brunch omelet kitchen close some stations  did think deserved 25 per person paid but maybe dinner would better   But all eat crab legs jumbo shrimp cocktail sushi great! <EOR> Obviously going lot choose all going something exquisite  Yes cost more sometimes lines going ridiculously long    What love place if nice restaurant can't decide eat  all ! If just want try something here  where all your answers    I little bit everything try almost everything offer  love desserts here  Awesome  <EOR> Not really worth it    Infinite amounts food but food selection limited  Let's want some sushi 100 pieces 3 different kinds sushi    Lots dessert though but its all same just small cakes little cones filled creme  Try find little cup strawberry jello+whipped cream  really fast    Seafood salty  If really want grab when first comes bottom pile    The best food DIY salad    k    Large generous portions meat wait line maybe 2min through whole line     Overall its okay if hungry  other buffets strip  hotel big am really disappointed  <EOR> We came breakfast second day trip my birthday enjoyed dining experience  Friendly staff nice waitress attentive kept drinks filled  Nice selection American ethnic dishes  <EOR>  Good and poor tidbits     love huge peeled shrimp husband loves crab nice meat items lots vegetables buffet gorgeous desserts nice selection breads sliders welconed  Detest self service beverages   Sorry MGM Mirage blew it  Pricy but love Bellagio property  atmosphere  <EOR> The Buffet incredible  best most complete Brunches had  came 9 am wasn't line  on way line huge  Buffet 30 bucks never ending Mimosas 18  stayed 2 5 hours   The service great  waiter very engaging always made sure drinks filled  place many options could only finish two plates  waffles omelette then beef ribs steak  much food pics people post give justice   The mimosas very strong  only wish time twice during trip  <EOR> Over priced modern day version surely constitutes Roman gastronomic orgy  Fit fat emperor swarthy court really nauseated amount food consumption going here   Like stations cross drag yourself your plate next crepes omelettes fruit meats porridge danishes oh just going over head  feel 10 lbs heavier  We came because given Bfast stay Bellagio  But pay wait Disneyland like cue then seated arena food would could step foot here   Best well prepared custom ordered omelette any cafe resto Bellagio your heart hips favor steer clear here  <EOR> Came celebrate last night Vegas   As FYI price dinner buffet $29 95 Sunday Thursday gourmet buffet Fridays Saturdays $36 95   Another FYI all non alcoholic beverages included price but alcoholic drinks not  When line saw line snaked around nervous pissed off because thought I'd wait I'm impatient type see pacing around when waiting seated however line moving very efficient seated down 20 minutes   When saw buffet place seemed neverending counted 9 10 different stations all separated ethnicity types food  Since Friday paid gourmet buffet which includes Beef Wellington I think  why price difference The beef wellington amazing very tender juicy along everything else  ate saw person next table sitting down pile and mean pile stone crabs just watching devour amazing   The service good outstanding but again don't come service just food <EOR> So many varieties food choose from!! All beautifully presented  food didn't taste all great but expect buffet?  I did lobster ravioli  big chucks lobster meat delish creme sauce top off  Don't eat many because pretty filling  pesto pizza also very good  craving some right now! All other dishes just so so  great expected be    Their dessert area prettiest  All beautifully made assorted chocolate cake cheesecake creme brulee chocolate dipped strawberries my fav  assorted creme puffs more  looked very good appealing but didn't taste same way  Chocolate cake didn't taste chocolate cake  creme brulee didn't enough flavor  desserts just great look at    Overall think done buffets here  lot food but its just good come back  <EOR> The best buffet Las Vegas! everything! goose good! also love caviar! All stand line two hours your stomachache full! <EOR> awesome buffet! lot variety! loved prime rib!!!!!!!!!!! good! little disappointed dessert section though  sad face   salad bar quite withered   didn't taste fresh   other delicious! <EOR> Going into knew going come restaurant looking whale put extra 10 miles running week headed Vegas! Buffet Bellagio all business didn't waste time rice pasta potatoes didn't pay 45 bucks load carbs LOL   Salmon rib eye steak bbq ribs lots other good stuff!! buffet best selection food all others Vegas almost everything really good  salmon could used bit more salt roast turkey little dry however turkey exactly easy just right cut them some slack No desserts though wicked selection but don't need those types sugars passed them  Overall very satisfied buffet still remains top list  I'll put 15 more miles week  head over Vegas again just good <EOR> Heard much Las Vegas buffets excited finally try it  However utterly disappointed Bellagio's lunch buffet  hotel buffet only more options premium price but premium food selections quality    Service indifferent slow  stack plates real high see would then bother come over take away  case even before restaurant busy   Environment Clean spacious  Dim yellow lights favorite ambience looks tired aged  Flies flying around should expect little friends?   Presentation food looks tired poorly presented cut  Look photos decide yourself does food look appetizing?  Food Uninspired food even standard food court food  cooked fish overcooked under seasoned  pizza fillings generous but average pizza  sushi cheapest quality sushi find no salmon avocado just vegetables com'on!! Steak    steak!? books no steak = no buffet especially premium priced buffets!! Stir fry vegetables Panda Panda does better both taste presentation selection quality!  Egg Benedict favorite good hollandaise sauce runny yolk yum! But highlight pretty sad   Dessert Decent but nothing exciting poorly presented  Each slice cut haphazardly uneven sizes rough edges  Sincerely food courts does better tenth price!   Price low down $28 99 weekday lunch  If eating alone sure buffet may worthwhile eat more selections food  However would still recommend elsewhere better value money  If eating group definitely recommend going eat different restaurants even take outs  better eat food prepared cooked presented care precision heart  Bellagio's buffet quantity without quality  <EOR> Once king buffets Vegas Bellagio still solid contender   eaten several times seafood buffet always enjoyed it  food quality good selections good well  buffet wont blow away but if some comps use Bellagio wouldnt bad choice use them  <EOR> This buffet super limited didn't many good options  would come again considering all buffet options Vegas offer  logic since Bellagio higher end hotels would good choice  If staying close buffet might almost worth it  <EOR> My friend religiously played MyVegas All three versions! 2 3 weeks before trip  ended 48 500 LP which let ton stuff  them 2 1 Bellagio dinner buffet  dinner buffet $40 per person MyVegas deal paid $20 each    The Bellagio buffet pretty big much selection  say though crab both versions super hard open  would nice if came little more pre cracked?   We arrived around 5 30pm dinner woken super early sunrise hot air balloon ride morning wanted turn early  no wait but time left line super long    The Bellagio buffet only buffet poke which craze 2016  tried both salmon tuna wasn't impressed  seasoning way light! did someone making handrolls spot which pretty cool  Dessert options ok quite liked tapioca pudding    All all would say good deal $20 sure if would've if pay full $40 though  <EOR> This easily favorite buffet Vegas  service fantastic room spacious selection unmatched  always stop brunch when town  Eggs benedict prime rib crab legs sausage sushi some best offerings opinion  also really great coffee dessert  Highly recommended true quality Vegas buffet  <EOR> Meh  holiday buffet brunch 36 99 worth your money  only thing appetizing prime rib snow crab legs  But even then prime rib just Mediocre  <EOR> This place great!  Also expensive   buffet costs $40 before tip taxes but food awesome service great though someone group telling server we'd tipping finished might helped that    huge variety food didn't even time through all but sushi meats pretty tasty especially buffet   There're probably dozen different meats servers cut if love kobe beef rack lamb all other good stuff you'll probably love here   wish hungrier could've gone back seconds but trying everything pretty good too   Also desserts    don't know if always same stuff but home made marshmallows meringues delicious   Oh biggest things should watch for    lines   sure there're better off peak hours probably more easily but around 7 8ish PACKED   If waited line probably would've taken LEAST hour in   Luckily friend talked servers skip line sure but might able skip line if some sort membership maybe just if you're girl good sweet talking waiters P  Overall Awesome buffet lot delicious food but watch long ass line  <EOR> We try come least once during every trip Vegas because food really good   great selection food dessert   Even son asks come back   only bad thing price per person same adults children if kid doesn't eat enough cover price really worth it   But since only come once year big deal pay more son  <EOR> Long lines bummer but once orgy food overwhelming  brunch friends amazed could sushi alongside prime rib eggs benedict  didn't necessarily eat them order but sometimes  Vegas buffets supposed be!   They nice dessert bar could bigger but still nice if still room end your meal is  <EOR> So tried research place reviews came back favorable  Sadly did listen inner voice   Got hotel 3pm lunch hour ended waiting line over hour! Did leave line find another venue no did listen inner voice wait longer Pirates Disney noooo did end paying dinner rate stead lunch rate? YES! know right? should left but since spent much time line felt committed task   That said food meh best  very cautious seasonings selection OK but when expect taste another unfortunate   Now know should lower expectations when going buffet but then again why should one?

For comparison also Wicked Spoon Cosmopolitan  Bellagio definitely wider selection but loses uniqueness category    The pros Good sushi selection quality  murdered whole school fish during consumption salmon sushi  Decent seafood variety Numerous red meats available  1 point abysmal kobe beef  embarrassing  Delicious creme brulee  Inhaled least 5 these    The cons Front end staff  Limited speciality items ethnic food  Besides creme brulee desserts mediocre    The Buffet Bellagio doesn't disappoint but misses specialness comes expect Vegas buffet  strictly taste purposes I'd give nod Bellagio  overall experience though Wicked Spoon wins there  <EOR> If going splurge buffet Vegas good one  buffet Bellagio just doesn't compare all other great buffets Vegas    The food variety just okay  little pancakes giving caviar tasted awful  definitely other buffets better food quality sure   From remember customer service good    Overall nothing really special place  <EOR> Cheaper good used be  bad but 5* used be  could say best buffet I'd ever before I'm foodie usually don't them but if hear great one   but last trip $ down did quality  <EOR> Everyone kept telling good Bellagio Buffet wanted try out   left hotel even asking taxi cab driver he said good excited see what's up     Me friends starving 3PM haven't ate since day before around 6pm  waited line 30 mins only cost $25 00 each buffet which aint bad all finally ready attack grub on  LoL hungry putting food plate eating while walking around looking other food   tried Prime Rib Lamb both ok but prime rib lil bit red but still ate it   pretty much tried everything everything good but great   all eat shrimp bomb though cause ate 15 shrimps   looking forward crab legs but dinner time    Anyways experience ok would back but would rather try other places see wassup   Next Wynn buffet!!!  Enjoy! <EOR> Absolutely loved service food  came 12 years ago still great  buffet great selection really puts effort its food  would recommend anyone  <EOR> Honestly impressed  Maybe just high expectations something    but definitely going bother going again   As usual made basic rounds    hit prime rib whatever steak cut going on    asian food   seafood   dessert   it wasn't bad but definitely much better food even better prices     The lighting felt really dim me   made feel though date something equally awkward   Usually buffets extremely well lit    best way highlight food right? Even if doesn't taste good it'll still look bomb dot com you'll it! Yeah definitely case here   Overall nothing ordinary someplace would way for   Bonus points having really great waitresses keno but  extent stars   Sorry Bellagio but really need step your game because half dozen other buffets pwnd  <EOR> Meh   waited line hour pretty average Vegas buffet despite its inclusion most Best lists category   Nothing particularly special delicious selection wasn't outrageous weren't able keep demand many items causing long lines   server couldn't bothered check more often every twenty minutes dirty dishes piled table frequently   decor nothing special   top all off supposed more special menu offering normal charging $100 two since stretched Mother's Day pricing over three days   Really disappointment   don't know if used good but extremely average now even normal $30 price point dinner   all options Vegas Buffet otherwise won't back  <EOR> Whenever stay Bellagio succumb buffet   Lately law diminishing returns since both eat less used idea overstuffing trying anything Vegas isn't appealing five year ago   But quality Buffett keeps coming back usually Brunch     The prime rib money skip champagne component champagne but pretty cheap sparkling wine worth extra money instead save room another helping succulent shrimp well made deserts another helping well prepared Pad Thai  <EOR> It pretty good but nothing write home about  If over again would probably review options try something different  <EOR> This place decent compared all other buffets Vegas   would def recommend place anyone looking good buffet to   still yet visited buffet could rate 4 5 stars   can't remember all ate during last trip but list some things had   Rack Lamb 4 Kobe Beef 4 Shrimp 2 Crab Legs 2 Prime Rib 4 Mash Potatoes 4 Mac Cheese 3 Sushi 3 Ahi 3 Creme Brulee 4 Cheesecake 3 <EOR> Two questions should ask yourself when come place are 1  hungry am I? 2  much want overeat?  I am just saying its buffet million options seemingly luxurious food everyone eats ton because hey just paid $40 buffet     But honest everything mediocre best   know shouldn't expect much buffet but feels food just thrown front isn't ounce care prep food itself   liked few things pastas sweet potato   But sushi terrible if am going buffet pasta something very wrong here  <EOR> I expected more Bellagio buffet but eating wasted appetite money mediocre few selections compared other buffets too  transition breakfast lunch selections poor barely enough grab food out  taste food did grab okay could use some additional flavor   kept thinking if made food people preferred bland dishes  disappointed never come again nor brag it  only because watched Andrew Zimmerman's show when he did Vegas trip try buffets them but man    Starting think exaggeration  hungry even walk any where else since walked MGM just eat too   give 2 star just nice   <EOR> 1 star buffet 5 star price  Quality down complaints up  sub par  wants right more  Why? nothing more say  else want hear? Ok  water good  <EOR> I really excited ahead try vegas buffets   stayed bellagio decided breakfast buffet   can't really say paid lot it around 24$   Service good mean serve yourself but rest staff really nice friendly  giving place 2 stars because food   Everything else great coffee beverages environment service  the food really bad really sorry say   Pastas cold French toast waffles dry tasty jams syrop wasn't good all   expect big variety food places but wasn't big variety all   Next time staying would definitely prefer nice breakfast place then buffet   <EOR> The 4 really dessert  lol   Maybe Vegas way much but all buffets seem same Vegas  Why come here? Crab Legs Dessert    My tip show towards end lunch hour pay lunch price enjoy both lunch dinner! Overall good variety food  sure back  <EOR> Super late review buffet! brought mom Mother's Day Brunch! can't believe all bad reviews because experience other service waiter excellent! little apprehensive try because all previous reviews however took step faith tried myself! Really glad did because everything hoping be!  When arrived NO LINE! Yes    NO LINE! Mother's Day?! WOW! complete shock ask employee's place even open! Lucked completely because no wait! price believe close $60 per person remember but Mother's Day  standard most hotels charge buffet!  The selection food items yes bit smaller compared other buffet's but no complaints because job done Mom loved it! favorite part all fact offered both KING CRAB legs Snow! option them heated pretty neat because all needed pile your plate much wanted chef would heat them you!  The All Drink option added additional $12 15 when called told $12 when actually waitress said $15! Whatever she wanted argue didn't care only concerned drinking! did explain quoted phone she didn't care all! Other attitude great experience definitely see myself returning again! <EOR> For 25 min  wait $31 bucks underwhelmed  Maybe if liked Crab legs would felt moneys worth but someone small slightly picky doesn't eat ton sitting isn't worth it  food selection seemed bit random    tons choices but no real continuity    My other issue service  know buffet but felt because two 20 something females server didn't really give time day  wait forever drinks never water refills took forever come over ask if wanted coffee  tables around which filled older couples constantly getting drink refills plates cleared etc  <EOR> Maybe picked bad day but quality food really gone down last few years    arrived just before 12pm Saturday Aug 2 many stations still breakfast items pancakes eggs etc      All seafood fish items really tasteless very tough    pizza should even offered looked something frozen section supermarket    didn't see any crab legs but did shrimp which pretty good     I say desserts great always    Also service inside table great but area where pay looked totally confused chaotic  <EOR> I heard really good things place but say little disappointed  Yes food quality perfect but expecting more selection  <EOR> This works 2 5 actually husband giving 3 2  food mediocre selection limited desert seemed cut corners semi sweet chocolate strawberries?   husband says food A ok although he thinks and am inclined agree may because he eats meat not  He reports glazed ham prime rib quite good  ambiance both agree nice but given mixed performance food experience did live Bellagio reputation reason rounded down 2 5 median score  <EOR> We New Years Eve menu different bit more expensive usual  good stuff but still tad hard justify price tag other When Vegas rationale  husband loved if says anything! thing really liked different kinds caviar sure would never tried caviar otherwise  staff very nice  <EOR> 4 95 stars   know picky ratings lately but can't give perfect rating if some things aren't par    Definitely top 2 best buffets had!!  loooooove carving station here   I'd say  why keep coming back Bellagio   always succulent prime rib which favorite here   also other interesting meats during gourmet dinners such Kobe beef tri tip ostrich beef wellington rotisserie chicken   the list on    The other options Bellagio good   Typical pizza italian dishes   Decent asian food  Nothing stands much   really meat place   But other thing really enjoy cooking station during gourmet dinners   dish puff pastry cup   add bunch different items such shrimp mushrooms onions tomatoes then tomato based sauce pesto sauce   bunch other things add just can't remember else available   But sauce thing DIE FOR   Whether pesto tomato you'll fully satisfied   really really love always save room tummy least them    Thank Bellagio letting wallow all your meaty goodness! <EOR> Let just say would give 3 5 Stars because give extra love wonderful server Regina  But service aside food didn't blow mind  think better Vegas hotel buffets but selection overall could improve  came 2 30pm lunch buffet which extended over dinner buffet 3pm  lunch dinner wasn't big difference except did bring snow crab legs crawfish took away breakfast items  Also meats changed took away BBQ ribs came prime rib    The sushi any buffet just below average but did poke especially salmon poke spicy mayo sauce side dinner item?   Meats good especially loved BBQ ribs lunch  really into snow crab but other tables plates full them you know they're getting money's worth!     Desserts okay selection standout favorites mine mango panna cotta cheesecake  tiramisu panna cotta also good  soft serve ice cream machine but barely touched since melted right away bowl  liked variety soups miso soup nice way end meal    If play MyVegas save enough loyalty points redeem free weekday lunch buffet meal Bellagio even BOGO if can't enough  Quite amazing deal  certainly ate money's worth which happened price air  <EOR> Well came comped lunch buffet can't really say anything special food  pretty good variety but nothing overly tasty  server actually quit when guy front tried another slice steak  wouldn't pay eat  sure  <EOR> Omg high hopes being nice hotel  Literally nothing bf except cold shrimp good  wish would asked look food before paying 95 00 husband eat here  disgrace! weirdest looking food love food! never again! price wait place dud! Earlier ate buffet aria hotel 10 times better! day before mirage even better cheaper! Bellagio needs upgrade! Wasted money!! <EOR> Overall bad brunch spot   wouldn't consider must visit place Vegas but good choice if you're looking moderate priced buffet okay maybe upper end moderate but terrible    visited Buffet Saturday morning Champagne Brunch   Right around 10AM short ish line few minutes standing around in   Service good waitress top keeping drinks filled plates bussed   The food selection isn't widest around but fairly large decent quality   would liked see more seafood sushi options less generic breakfast offerings but really liked seafood ceviche scallops! prime rib   dim sum nice touch though tasted pretty average   desserts all looked delicious most ones tasted exception sugar free ones   but guess fault great  <EOR> The only reason giving buffet 1 star because doesn't allow just leave blank    which would describe experience  Let start saying place over rated  thought atmosphere reviews would give try first time  3 19 16   Well surprise waiting line 30 min price increased 30%  Why?   according cashier St Patrick's Day  trying biased but give major holiday willing pay extra fees Autistic 5 year old son   who doesn't eat but few choice foods  more specific he literally ate 2 small square pieces pizza small bowl more dipping cup mac cheese  didn't decline elsewhere fact children hungry waiting line patiently   deserved sit eat   Most ppl would probably question why even took two children first place   Well again experience  But pay almost $50 person ages 3+ just plain taking advantage  Yes!  paid each x 4  Then when asked manager why charge much children  response can't put age some children similar ages consume lot food   Then husband asked if can't put age why over age 3 charged adult rate?   Your still putting age limit it!   The manager couldn't answer just say  way is  also say many places stayed ones treated more respect  courtesy less 4 star rating   go figure  mentioned before high expectations very disappointed way treated  back hope others continue don't children   or disabled children matter receive type treatment  Because don't want bore anyone won't into menu   only say mine daughter's plate full blood oh rare meats   which could eat  <EOR> AAA     like keeled over woke food heven  <EOR> First off bellagio buffet expensive if lunch   But sure 30 minutes before lunch time over stay dinner menu too   Best way deal!  The food really rich but still tasty   any other good buffet   BUT selling point reason why place gets 4 star review because of     DESSERTS!  MUCH VARIETY GOOD!  Ask your server cup black coffee also really good! just tops off your meal   The only downer wait staff bit haughty    but buffets food waiter service place still deserves 4 stars <EOR> It's almost impossible truly give review buffet mean change daily right? But here's experience   My friends debated awhile which buffet hit during stay Vegas Bellagio final choice  long line $35 per person cost in  selection seemed huge since spent $35 wanted $35 worth food least   The food great couldn't more happy got  many options many different stations  main dinner stuff great but think made fair share stops dessert station  Creme brulee chocolate covered strawberries fruit tarts? loooving every second   The only complaint waiter kind slow drink orders  thing he reallllly  <EOR> I read need right 4pm avoid long lines friends true! time left around 6pm line stretched all way down casino  felt little bit old folks eating dinner early but well worth it  Buffet itself wide selection delicious options most them definitely high end scale  Alaskan king crab legs seemed huge hit  No lobster though! desserts amazing usually tempted but key lime tart lets good true! Overall would say good bet early dinner late lunch $35 reasonable  <EOR> If vegetarian place definitely you  Expecting nice dinner paying exorbitant price only disappointed  flooded sea food entries  Since am vegetarian could just eat bread n butter lentil soup desserts  1 star   <EOR> I don't think better buffet there  Great place breakfast don't worry eating again  catch alittle African fish over Asian food fish excellent Eggs Benedict  Wash all down some best Iced Tea ever tasted  <EOR> Bellagio Buffet? Wynn Buffet? Vegas Buffet Debate!  IMO Bellagio winner dessert puts top!  friend's 25th birthday celebration fest decided group dinner Bellagio Buffet   called hour before hand give buffet heads rolling 19 people   don't really take reservations still wait line but managed save two tables right next eachother!  There's much food didn't know where start!  meat carving station serving kobe beef prime rib ostrich turkey beef wellington more!  kobe beef prime rib deliciously tender   Other highlights poke tuna so fresh prepared salads area pastas vegetarian pizza mac n cheese three different kinds potatoes!!!    For dessert limited myself three dishes apple pie really yummy coconut macaroon just okay DELICIOUS chocolate covered strawberries   dark chocolate milk chocolate swirled chocolate covered  YUMMMMMM   After tax gratutity because large party came $45 per person Saturday night dinner buffet   Stuffed  <EOR> Good buffet   late lunch you'll able eat dinner cost lunch   When changeover dinner don't kick out   still prefer Wynn buffet  <EOR> I think came wrong day  Yeah some high end food but honestly don't think worth $28 95 dinner Tuesday  mean before but Friday few years ago  Back then food amazing guess see why its much better weekends   They chicken wellington but dry taste  helped myself lot salmon nigiri but rice pasty  slab salmon just right puny Mirage  cooking station made French dish where pick your seafood veggies type sauce poured onto kind bread used wellington  creation consisted salmon scallops shrimp mixed onions tomatoes peppers  All following stir fried then mixed pesto sauce  don't remember actual name dish but very few things enjoyed  pesto mashed potatoes  Hmmm guess thing pesto sauce    Besides dishes just mentioned meal wasn't memorable  29 doll hairs expected better  bad but great  weekend  may more expensive but better food  <EOR> Love breakfast buffet here  favorites eggs benedict eggs florentine crepes salads desserts coffee  All top quality service received freshly brewed flavorful coffees  Eggs benny perfect which impressive maintain buffet sitting under heat lamps  If 1 2 hr  before lunch turnaround you'll experience lunch items too  back next trip! <EOR> A lot food 43$ !!

Shhhhhh  never tried it   only sushi favorite Japanese places     Here some tips 1 dinner early meaning before 6pm expect long line   always line when gone  If line zig zags casino 1 hour    In January $15 VIP service which would allow cut front   show lot food eat decided worth it   trimmed 60+ minutes us     2 Don't over eat save room dessert   I've gone lot Vegas buffets but current favorite  <EOR> All say is       MEH     First off expected better   Rio usually eat something 2 3 big plates shrimp cocktail   ate 1 plate bellagio   because watching diet trying fit into sexy dress night saving room something else   because something wrong   just didn't taste good   screw shrimp cocktail?    Next crab wasn't good   Usually eat least 5 plates stacked crab legs   mean 5 points cutting king crab legs half don't work cracking them getting angry cutting your fingers trying eat faster   But quality just wasn't there   I'd rather crack crab could eat something tastier   dry hit miss   Probably frozen long   fresh     Third sashimi disgusting   Americans think sashimi like?  fresh all   couldn't eat plate because fear eating bad fish   having eaten bad fish point life definitely worth risk   some spicy tuna but come SPICY TUNA???   Next kobe beef wasn't kobe all   Why call kobe??? Just call beef jerky     The chilean bass pretty good   can't believe something eat   Oh pesto mashed potatoes pretty good but come seafood   potatoes     There no king crab claws rio    Skipped carb dishes bread pastas etc   coming back     Two stars because dessert pretty good   pretty good mean creme brulee good   did moneys worth   angry just thinking paying bad food    all  <EOR> We weekday 5 00pm no line seated right away  There wide variety food loved hand tuna roll chorizo  liked crab legs but cold wish made them hot wasn't wide variety seafood buffet but quality food good desert part ok didn't ice cream!

Sorry Bellagio Buffet  Never again until renovate reinvent rejuvenate! <EOR> No idea why much hate place  Monday night Kobe beef rack lamb pork mussel paetta many other upscale options available   all delicious   Service great would expect Bellagio  deserts!! Usually most sad disappointing part buffet experience but Bellagio does them very very well  surprised no gelato but white chocolate nutella cone cups cannollis more made it  <EOR> Very bland dishes throughout  turkey slice dry  Beef little taste  Spicy tuna handroll good  <EOR> A great stop breakfast  can't complain $13 95 buffet gets through dinner without feeling hungry again  especially when eating Panda Express costs same price! if show towards end breakfast 10 30ish eat extras put lunch crowd breakfast price    Don't know any other meals but would definitely recommend breakfast buffet Bellagio  <EOR> This review more towards 3 5 stars but 3 seems little  enjoyed buffet  am normally fan buffets but best to  literally just every type food craving could think of  really enjoyed seafood options both cooked small sushi selections  also sampled many other foods cant remember list them all  But just idea bbq brisket ham turkey salads soups various potatoes etc     dessert array awesome ice cream tart puddings cakes more  Everyone tried delicious  came early dinner around 6 00pm timed perfect short wait however when leaving line all way into casino  <EOR> This usually must when Vegas  say time only 4 star visit   Things just didn't meet exceeded expectations used to   shrimp crab gone down quality years progressed   Some food cold   think buffet needs update   Over all ok but could much better   Service excellent  <EOR> Good vegetarians meat lovers too  liked lamb chops beef ribs  Also enjoyed tuna salmon poke  think fewer food choices tho compared other buffets same price range  <EOR> Breakfast Lunch all hyped be     Just okay  Why would anyone add orange flavoring flan?! Flan already good way is     Well Bellagio just tweak every dishes such way  experimented foods good simply just being normal added extra ingredients which needed first place  Mandalay Bay's buffet much nicer fancier  heard guest met Buffet Planet Hollywood's buffet actually much better Bellagio's      I might back but only check dinner  Breakfast just meh     <EOR> On hot April afternoon during stay Bellagio decided try famed buffet  The buffet quite good though felt pricey $40 ish + taxes because weekday lunch heard its much higher over weekends  But then Vegas can't expect value money guess Coming food huge array dishes wife vegetarian also found many good options it  mostly international mix something satisfy every palate  The service ok ish times found servers looking disinterested   To sum while Vegas definitely experience buffet once probably before watching spectacular fountains <EOR> So since 40 Gabillion other people already reviewed buffet just into faves disappointments very quickly   I think expected something more based all hype hooplah   But Bellagio Buffet all its' glory still BUFFET   don't know why expected other but did   being said darn good buffet options only found other buffets but lot people wouldn't chance try elsewhere  I doubt serve Bluenose Kobe Beef Iowa whatever  *****TIP*****  arrived 15 minuted before end lunch beginning dinner   paid lunch price but feasted dinner goodies   Just plan spend 2+ hours   fun when group pass time few drinks some good conversation   The Not So Much I unimpressed desserts   know minority but grabbed Flan which inedible Chocolate Mousse Cake Hazelnuts weak flavor Lemon bar some sort   best bunch even meh  Also lamb overcooked chewey  We rare medium  The Crab Legs sponges could squeeze water them  Gross   The Interesting Roast Quail Bluenose Very similar Seabass  See Awesome seciton  The Good Scallop Ceviche  Seaweed Salad  Fresh Mozarella Pesto  Kobe Beef Sirloin Flavorful but tender  The Awesome Mashed Sweet Potatoes Ginger Orange Bluenose They prepared various ways   3 helpings! House Cured Bacon Think Smoked Pork Belly!  YUM! Smoked Trout It amazing  Salmon Nigiri It REALLY good  Definitely Buffet Sushi Quality  It overall impressive spread   But price high wasn't supreme perfection would want experience Wynn Carnival @ Rio Cravings @ Mirage  <EOR> I can't wholeheartedly give buffet four star since pretty sure fresh shrimp ate made sick later day but otherwise well worth money $23 95 brunch Sunday including fountain drinks free refills   cousins locals also vouch place  Sunday exactly noon didn't seated until close one  But worth wait! Really good steak 10 different potato dishes good mix vegetables tons dessert  well packaged bite sized portions  lot different kinds breads which unfortunately unable around tasting  <EOR> Since its featured tv many times best buffets try out   Came Brunch Sunday morning the later longer wait champagne meal $30 per person but endless mimosas!

No way jose!  For dessert always grab every single kind take bite each one   Share friends don't waste much food   Eating buffets way very enjoyable worthwhile experience   Cheers! <EOR> Sorry but very disappointed buffet freaking Bellagio !  Cons No visual appeal sorry but eat your eyes first buffet look nothing spectacular   No cute presentation regular dishes used dessert old school ice cream machine   last buffet did Wicked Spoon loved presentation   NO OYSTERS!!!!! Seriously $43 would think bigger seafood selection Side dishes Hometown Buffet Desserts nothing special no macaroons no gelato sushis selection also very limited  Pros good service plates always removed pretty fast  offer  3 kind caviars love ikura also steak tartare very yummi ahi poke salmon poke   <EOR> I tried buffet friend Thursday lunch say quite disappointed quality price ratio place   First things first buffet ideally located strip inside Bellagio hotel  hotel rather large parking structure allows park without many difficulties  should note parking structure become paid very soon though   My main issue buffet price  easily most expensive buffets Las Vegas such would expect absolutely top quality food  Unfortunately case  food good but nothing exceptional price thus leading low quality price ratio   Service pretty good but alcohol included price ready spend even more if want include your meal   Overall would recommend buffet since many others just good well much cheaper  Stay away tourist traps! Feel free message should need any additional information  <EOR> We complimentary passes buffet went  later found complimentary meant would reimbursed 80 dollars 100 something paid dinner two  Anyway am digressing back matters food   Crab legs Inedible  cut half tasted off  NY Strip Inedible  Cooked beyond belief  Pizza OK frozen pizza OK  Sushi Gross Pasta OK better pasta noodles company Dessert enjoyed but really nothing special  Tasted something food Lion  Coffee bitter bitter Staff don't care except bussers only deserving persons there   The time ate Golden Corral better meal cost 10 bucks    1 star may seem harsh but almost 60 bucks per person kind food simply unacceptable  <EOR> Buffets hardly ever completely different eachother price selection people  However Bellagio upped standard which establishments measured mirrors hotel present food service guests beautiful decor restaurant  amazing selection varies finest seafood mountain Italian pastas great variety Asian food  While bit steep buffet $30 per person consider fine dining night which serve yourself  <EOR> Awesome Breakfast Buffett  really enjoyed omelette  Nice variety  Wednesday Morning 9 45 no wait time  $45 two people  <EOR> The best buffet town 15 years ago  exotic meat peasant Kobe beef venison  But time corporations took over buffet down hill  bad prices didn't follow  service always great but lines always long   When Steve Wynn exited did quality  give four stars because great memories  But really deserves three based generic buffet fare sits under heat lamps now  Definitely worth price admission  wait  Can't say winner but loser either  Mandalay buffet  cheaper better  If you're thinking going Wynn buffet skip it  just rehash Bellagio buffet  Overpriced  <EOR> We good experience back couple years ago   thought would hopefully experience great food Buffet Bellagio again   family devastated quality type food being offered $47 person buffet    food blend flavoring missing just completely off    selection food minuscule quality subpar price    say Campbell chicken noodle soup much more tasty chicken noodle soup    no signs oysters fishes other some salmon    Forget any sashimi sushi dishes   buffet over Atlantic casino Reno much better    Any Asian buffet places California would better quality   say extremely disappointed food  <EOR> We dinner Bellagio Buffet last night  service OK  server great but kind forgot towards end visit  food cold  only good thing crab legs because they're suppose cold tacos because freshly made  food under single lamp didn't heat food all  let server know food cold he told manager charge  All she did come over ask problem said she going talk chief  no idea actually happened though because didn't see that  Half buffet closed well wasn't many options  must say rather Rio buffet  high end casino horrible experience  <EOR> I'm fan buffets even fancy Vegas buffets   still probably better ones there   Luxur buffet ever   even worse   heard buffet Mandalay Bay best though which try someday   Of course efficient Asian sense means eat only meat seafood   just that!  then outside watch water show   could stand hours  <EOR> This third time trying Bellagio Buffet  first time tried during lunch time second time early morning breakfast time around brunch time    Based buffets tried Vegas pretty decent one  good seafood lovers cold king crabs my husband fan   am more seafood person mostly omelette station they take around 1ish variety desserts variety dishes different restaurants Bellagio easy able sample all dishes buffet take pick case want restaurants dinner  moved beverages vending machines sure if fan that  Since 5 didn't fact coffees teas apart getting food  during Christmas more crowded usual  However did enjoy food taste at least tried servers prompt cleaning plates    If want avoid crowds try getting around 10am starts getting crowded that  buffet definitely worth try! <EOR> Compared any other buffet top   Thursday $29 person     deal!  $50 worth Alaskan King Crab Legs!

All eat snow crab good enough but when found Alaskan King Crab heaven  Unfortunately served cold but realistically must accommodate many customers  also sushi actual raw fish! However did question quality sashimi Nevada landlocked fish definitely tasted frozen  least option Wynn served raw fish   In terms food general definitely recommend Bellagio  few thing know before going  5 30 PM line buffet becomes ridiculously long  fortunate enough told before going  arrived entrance buffet around 5 00 PM wait only 5 min ! Keep mind when contemplating when because going early definitely perk  <EOR> Great buffet unlimited mimosas only partook unlimited OJ Though    Definitely come if big group people    those late stragglers ask host let your guests jump line come in     Awesome we late comers    <EOR> ive breakfast lunch dinner  dinner def time want go   the selection better quality well    service great price match  selection everything food dessert over whelming  its kinda loud felt back school  but better food  <EOR> I say very flavorful buffet  Nothing bland  once! think price steep but fun semi special occasion  group 4 fortunate enough bypass monster line dinner because comp hubby's poker obsession  All points he racked poker room helped dinner comped because 1 comp able cut line! recommend using those pts ahead here!

If love crab legs much then you're luck   pile them high let serve yourself unlike MGM    works wonderfully because don't caught waiting line hour receive three crab legs   slice them down middle well which another huge perk   If them warm take them cooking stations grill'em you   Fantastic!  P S  Thrifty side note If time just right hit buffet line around 3 30 experience dinner selections lunch prices $  only meal you'd need day  Trust me  way Vegas budget  <EOR> Few words Very delicious food prompt customer service just long wait line   but definitely recommended <EOR> Yummmmmmmmm This buffet best Las Vegas  such selection find salads excellent prime rib soups pasta crab legs excellent everything  only complaint busy often takes long time tables cleaned off  long wait often unless M life card moves front line  <EOR> had dinner fri night   48  bucks ok but great <EOR> ** AYCE Reduced Price Happier Person **  If frequent visitor Las Vegas chances probably tried Buffet Bellagio   If remembered correctly used charge close $50 person dinner buffet but might wrong since while since did AYCE @ Las Vegas   Anyways    Saturday wherein charge $36 gourmet dinner   usual    Salad pasta Chinese Japanese blah blah blah   tried little bit everything all taste good but couldn't resist stopping meat section another serving lamb everytime passed by   absolutely delicious   OVERALL Yes ate money's worth Bellagio probably regret decision all out another AYCE location few days   *sigh* <EOR> I came dinner enjoyed food at time   There's great variety cuisines lots options  sushi fresh most food tasted delicious  Unlimited access drinks which great   Unfortunately give low score because food poisoning got  reccomend yourself favour avoid crab legs here! frozen smelt off weren't cleaned properly  leave buffet early felt sick unfortunately ruined experience rest trip Vegas  Next time stay away seafood  <EOR> To must artist's hat on  Why? may ask   Well palette plate   freewheel create     My first masterpiece   I call Japan | Americana | Italia   Basically some sushi w heaps wasabi course slider mini burger shrimp pizza   My next creation she called Boned Things Green Red    consisted sliced turkey some ribs duck leg color pop asparagus cranberry sauce   And lastly pièce de résistance  I call Raw Sweetness    consisted three unique looking dessert dishes bowl fruit some raw Scottish Salmon I'm half Scottish  represent!    All all good trip   Gorging wasn't part parcel trip high end buffet    other words didn't belly seafood counter snag entire crab bowl off it   Have never disappointed here  <EOR> I preface fact hate buffets   those 5 stars mistake?  Nope    because Bellagio's Sunday Brunch blew away    As vegetarian options usually limited boring don't value them compared someone 5 pounds snow crab legs   Typically wonder through buffet idea what's pick tiny little piece few good looking things likely anything enough try seconds   If seconds because didn't find enough eating round picking satisfy hunger    Desserts really only aspect look forward to    Buffets usually bad OK food  rather costly usually eat much regret after    The brunch though     did standard nipples round liked most things tried which placed interesting situation really wanted consume day!  ate mostly non desserts    choice!  world nearly ended right there   everything amazing but most good great   left stuffed unwilling eat anything all rest day     worth once   Is expensive but once worth $60 think two sans alcohol    Considering  all wanted eat day really liked think buffet fleecing don't regret would revisit another time  <EOR> It Sunday before Christmas waiting line ridiculously long  waited hour before seated  seated waiter immediately took drink orders  Once drinks ready chow down whole buffet!   Price Holiday dinner $47 99    Dining atmosphere wasn't fancy Wicked Spoon however food better Wicked Spoon's  $47 99? Smoked salmon Chinese duck Chinese broccoli lamb chops prime ribs goose meat sushi nigiri gnocchi bolognese beef wellington tasty desserts  Oh also taco station shrimp cocktail!  The good Lamb chops simply amazing! only seasoning just right lambs tender juicy! Chinese duck broccoli actually pretty good  dessert pecan pie tasted good!   The Bad Miso soup fairly salty    Disappointment ran creme brulee = Other long waiting line definitely amazing buffet experience  food Bellagio definitely far more superior Wicked Spoon's  Would come back if another chance? Hell yea! <EOR> This go to luxury buffet  Gone mussels gone Alaskan KING crab legs Bellagio happened them?    Chilean sea bass? No  Everything diluted pricy B level offering  Sad  <EOR> The Buffet Bellagio good ravioli really good sushi bad lots fun desserts show from  However nothing really blew away  think decided really buffet person I'd rather just pick really great dish menu regular restaurant that  <EOR> I'm generally buffet fan grain salt review  headed over Bellagio Saturday brunch  little before 11 waited 30 minutes ish before getting seated  Lunch menu $32   Selection quite impressive lot variety  reminded Mexican Caribbean resort venue where quantity abounds over quality  Usual stuff omelet station available though coin I'd liked see more high end stuff  Prime rib roasted turkey smoked salmon decent looking sushi bar probably best bang buck  No problems service drink refills plentiful easy come by  <EOR> When apocalypse happens hope midst eating buffet!   Just stuffing mouth tender prime rib melt in your mouth grilled sea bass  know butter melts your mouth?  EXACTLY was    There piles Alaskan King Crab legs conveniently already cut if you're smart  aim for expensive stuff!  I tried beef bourguignon because Julia Child though thought good friend wasn't fan  never tried sure supposed taste but admit taste alcohol red wine   Man oh man creamy herbed green mashed potatoes goood! literally scoop each time back which 4 5 times counting dessert   Their sushi selection good best but really haven't buffet good sushi can't complain  really delicious salmon poke friend couldn't enough piles piles shrimp cocktail    This buffet seemed good deal only 35 dollars  Wynn lunch paid 30 some seriously disappointing food  guessing because lunch but comparing costs no go     service food company excellent! <EOR> Went family Thanksgiving dinner say quality selection really gone down since last time here    The cocktail sauce tasted really diluted when eating shrimp  crab legs pretty salty didn't much meat  broccoli also pretty salty  shrimp ravioli complete joke because literally contained tiny piece shrimp include photo y'all see   Bobby pizza decent basically cranberry sauce turkey chunks  grilled salmon truffle oil pretty tasty crispy but weren't really making many them because probably busy doing other things  California rolls tempura rolls did taste good all  decided stay away nigiri poke because fish slices did look fresh    Overall pretty disappointed Thanksgiving dinner buffet  Pretty much paid $55 per person sad selection food poor flavor lots saltiness  eat strip pretty often place may avoid future  <EOR> When first step into buffet Bellagio nice feeling due magnificent atmosphere  greeted friendly hostesses waitresses    There variety food desserts  food mouth watering  cannot wrong Bellagio Buffet  <EOR> The seafood fresh here  locates Bellagio given price high expectation  However turns worst buffet ever tried Vegas  <EOR> It's while but definitely remember buffet being really good  Honestly can't into specifics because long but definitely favorite buffet Vegas before Bacchanal opened up  Owe yourself enjoy it! <EOR> I breakfast buffet time  years since when came last time probably best buffet Las Vegas time much  lot good variety  Some best things tried Baked ham herb crusted prime rib ravioli    The cannoli disappointing most desserts disappointing   The price pretty good weekend $35 person compared $60 Casear's Palace weekends  <EOR> I did research before coming listed consistently best buffets vegas well didn't disappoint  came supper but came weekday early around 4 30 avoid line  boy glad    time left which just past 7 line entrance buffet already!

Pretty wide choice all other range cuisines well   deserts many    not place if diet  Hard know where begin end!! If you're looking decent buffet Las Vegas would definitely recommend here  <EOR> Going chime say selection great food delicious Yelp stars well worth price justified   It $30 per person including drinks food for buffet very good standards!  Went Wednesday night 6 PM 20 minute wait  service attentive  place clean   As person usually cheap buffets impressed selection food main course salad dessert have  very well diverse while maintaining quality  only complaint would pastas  marinara pasta's flavor weak creamy pastas very grainy due cheesy sauce  The highlight? Prime rib  Add mashed potatoes mashed yam grilled mushroom veggies zuchinni squash perfect comfort food plate! huge crab person can't criticize it good though but tell baked sea bass perfect  Also sushi surprisingly good buffet  If raw fish then won't disappointed  They've nigiris poke salmon tuna  seaweed salad gets thumbs too   Dessert? Yes! usually hate dessert buffets but nodding every bite   My first buffet Vegas Strip Paris' Le Village few bucks less tell you're better off coming Bellagio   Next time come back Vegas going back Bellagio more stomach stuffing  <EOR> Overrated  prime rib tough chew crab legs thin  doesn't much selections good foods  Maybe Tuesday   Won't return again  <EOR> I didn't think even worth 30$  Kobe beef over cooked took stiff steak knife cut it  tasted prime rib but tough  If crab legs sausage pretty good shrimp cocktail dessert coffee shooter chocolate moose cups mini key lime pies  If lamb don't lamb ribs horrible y over cooked  worth opinion <EOR> Decent place dinner  However I'd say buffet Wynn much better slightly more expensive price  crab legs watery but dessert selection great  <EOR> when someone talks thinks Bellagio automatically think high end super high quality     Apparently become trend someone actually wait buffets Vegas   know food self service but now drinks well? Why thing?  Maybe some el cheap $8 buffet somewhere downtown? Paying $30 lunch buffet and paying parking someone doesn't bring drinks beyond ridiculous they're suppose help clear plates which still however seriously lack diligence so     The food good but amazing use be  breakfast stuff great bbq beef brisket melt your mouth tender but absolutely no flavor   slathering BBQ sauce ridiculously tender brisket isn't going give enough flavor bland  sliders? Why even buffet? HOCKEY PUCKS  flavorless bone dry hockey pucks   did eat any Asian cuisine but person group did told dry lacked flavor   ton selection buffet many gluten free options desert good macadamia cookies delicious       I don't want come buffet any time soon disappointed Bellagio better this   <EOR> Great food selection!

Macaroons die for   rest desserts tasted old  Liked all other food! <EOR> Food good server great  management very rude employees especially those latino  didn't see why eating 1  no need someone feel less you <EOR> Hands down best buffet strip! always eat multiple times buffet while amazing  tried almost every buffet strip nothing compares one! steamed cracked crab legs butter die for! place something everyone cooks servers work very hard keep food fresh hot  must try won't disappointed! <EOR> I remember coming child best buffet world!   It really isn't bad $20 lunch    lot cheaper most restaurants Vegas  good variety breakfast food  prime rib definitely best part  sushi other hand didn't look great   I'd say just    OK  service good usual <EOR> I Dinner Buffet Friday night  7pm line really long  buffet must downgraded quality quantity before  Many yelp pictured items does exist buffet Don't fouled pictures dated many years ago  Items very limited compare other Vegas Buffets    The snow crabs small don't even bother split half other buffets  Jonah claws shrimp decent  Other three seafood don't see any other seafoods  Don't bother come place if seafood lover  hard grab snow crabs claws shrimp because placed top large ice your wrist contact sneeze guards    Sushi joke  Poorly made  Tasted dry disgusting  Other standard Buffet food okay  bad impressive either    Very limited selection desserts  guess used two levels desserts lot ice cream types where use scoops See Yelp Pictures   Now only level repeated desserts three type ice cream soft serve ice cream machine the machine see McDonalds   love sweets no complain taste  all delicious    Overall Bellagio's Buffet big disappointment  paying high price going golden corral snow crab more seating  Wynn Caeser's buffet better Bellagio  <EOR> Very disappointed food  no taste all  Even desserts off  expecting exceptional food name Ballgio but $40 person waste money   experience taught never want eat  buffet again  <EOR> Food amazing only thing pricy  65 two brunch  good once blue moon but regular thing  <EOR> When Vegas buffet   tradition dates back childhood!  trip tried Bellagio which often compared Wynn   buffet Bellagio pretty good but Wynn wins book   They draw even PRIME RIB SHRIMP CRAB LEG categories all which great   particularly shrimp!

Potatoes served five different ways three pasta dishes red curry called Kobe beef just few items you'll find spread   also sushi which only consists California veggie rolls alongside questionable looking sashimi   If ignore sushi table place prepare night drinking should only accomplished Vegas  <EOR> The food pretty good but buffet overpriced  However price expected since Vegas  really bothered horrid service   The waitress sat party down asked drinks wanted  asked soy milk she rolled eyes  let slide since didn't really bother me  However she then said annoyed tone serious? really annoyed cause felt she judging me  She brought drinks while getting food told friend somebody way soy milk  doesn't matter if way because PAID job also PAID meal   Throughout meal also never any refills unless asked some point nobody even cleaned plates  really felt did waitress all   This worst experience ever any buffet  food may good but service just much worse  <EOR> i loved loved buffet let tell usually HATE buffets  But Bellagio definitely vote  Yes pricey other reviewers said its 25 bucks person but its worth ever penny  nothing mean nothing could taste dont have  omelettes crepes fresh waffles crispy bacon if your fruit oatmeal yogurt salad type your taste too! lines long but fast moving best part assigned seating no looking spot chow down filled your plate goodies  party 8 let sit two tables next each other could enjoy meal  staff nice welcoming very accommodating would definitely back if im ever Vegas again  <EOR> I guess kinda fault around 9 30 pm Friday night closed 10 00pm they take food back 10 30 which meant food going good wasn't  However did selection unique dishes offered  Prime ribs would great if fresh hot   Asian Food selection looked really smushy gross  Italian section looked decent variety pasta pizza  Sushi really really fresh which very surprising!

Aside prime rib it good but small serving Kobe beef night went  never tried Kobe before and   and   maybe said Kobey beef  Coby beef because wasn't exactly most tender beef ever had  prime rib actually more tender  Oh well  <EOR> After waking morning Vegas decided try find place eat   checking some restaurants accountant thought why don't pay few bucks more all eat buffet?? Before buffets Caesar's Wynn etc  came Bellagio buffet place be   thought would relive childhood memory walked over Bellagio buffet   little bit line when Tuesday morning but line moved pretty quickly only wait 15 minutes     I thought going crab but unfortunately none  For also same price Aria buffet crab disappointed this  tried other things main things enjoyed prime rib   usually meat rare but tender delicious   Dip au jous sauce front carving station much better   Aside prime rib did really care anything else   tried pasta sushi pizza few other things which did think bad but great   also tried some dessert which thought tasted little sweet I know dessert but almost thought sugar overload      With all other buffet options think Bellagio buffet become somewhat obsolete compared other newer buffets  <EOR> I read Bellagio better buffets Vegas decided give try lunch   line wasn't long 11am decided play few slots use restroom   When returned 30 minutes later line long winding!  Ugh   I seat close buffet itself   disappointed though   didn't see anything spectacular buffet price bit high   seemed regular Vegas buffet me   Plus drink service very slow   already finished first plate time drink arrived   Good luck trying ask refills   Might well bring bottle water   Although admit dessert counter best ones seen     I'd try again but dinner   Perhaps food better then   Be sure pick pear fruit basket   thought decorative item but actually real pear   best pear ever had! <EOR> It's worth price admission  $26 lunch gets all usual fixings  chilean sea bass bit dry but still great  peasant duck fatty but very tasty  bbq salmon really soft but would preferred lemon pepper chile based honey mango mix  Surprisingly OJ really good ha  service staff really friendly  Definitely top 10 buffet lunch though much food especially w the filling flavors assortments can't eat much humble opinion  <EOR> For very first review 2018 HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYBODY !!! find Bellagio Hotel very classy place catering more sophisticated well to do clientele   expectations higher place let's say likes Circus Circus   Thus when walked into Bellagio Buffet during week Thanksgiving rather expected more same classier ambience quality service     found   While decent food nothing wow'd fact some aspects bothered me   am happy say food tasted fine it   Buffets money off me   search scant few things but definitely don't money's worth   lunch tend want things cooked cold shrimp cocktail sauce crab legs bagels lox         and maybe couple other cold items along lines finger foods plus desserts   usually much more available but tend stay away hot dishes most buffet food stations   Bellagio buffet found shrimp but no crabs legs definitely no lox bagels   Devastation   Sure plenty other things but nothing intrigued busy being upset NO LOX   Come on   desserts chose decent   To matters worse FIRST time where walked into buffet thought oh dingy dark       old   just didn't feel bright cheerful        think Wynn Buffet which bright colorful airy   Bellagio Buffet need SERIOUS MAKEOVER   Very old dated   Some may say yah but if food good cares        well care all part experience   UPDATE THIS   The piece de resistance classy hotel buffet why earth would own drinks?  NEVER deal THAT   All other buffets waitress service clear plates but also bring beverages   waitresses but weren't allowed drinks   heck about?  Would nice say least      even waitress commented   I'm glad tried place but won't return   far many other respectable hotel Strip buffets just didn't float boat  <EOR> The Buffet Bellagio always favorites   spending night getaway home decided breakfast buffet before returning home   Imagine surprise when entered see buffet now serve yourself beverage place   several stations where coffee water variety juices Coca Cola multi dispensing machines   Imagine also surprise when pay $26 including tax grab cup your own coffee then take your table   icon mind just lost some its sparkle     I'm sure number staff cut because delivering beverages any more   Rather policing tables during guest meal then cleaning setting new guests   did made order mushroom spinach cheese crab meat omelette but just wasn't same   sat table while returned BEVERAGES area second cup coffee     #sad <EOR> I wish would eaten every single day Vegas  buffet amazing! rare find buffet where everything good  came breakfast day brunch another day only speak those  arrived each time before 9am did wait all but line starts form 10am    All good hotel buffets omelette stations but best! highly recommend trying it  really nothing stands buffet menu wise  same foods most buffets have   breakfast brunch chicken prime rib pizza seafood salad dessert station   the usual  taste sets place apart  bar good drink menu includes bottomless mimosas  STRONG  Why? Because instead bringing glass glass pre made mimosas give separate glass orange juice come table periodically bottle champagne just fill your glass it  safe say mimosas probably 70% champagne  Awesome! No matter hotel staying priority come buffet  <EOR> wow place overly hyped  still love food but no way good bayside buffet mandalay bay mirage  <EOR> We easter dinner buffet    Good part good buffet sea food lovers specially loves crab legs   High quality food deserts mind blowing Low on limited selections eg see some dimsum indian food middleeast food etc  Overall think overrated  <EOR> After coming three times past 21 years am able say paying $30 eat buffet worth it  selection food great but quality food    much  very obvious frozen before being set out  Crab legs still thawing eating cake felt just eating big chunk flavored whipped cream!!! <EOR> I understand positive reviews place  a$54 for two buffet should $10   The buns sliders could used pound nails  actually tried pierce striking table knife  No chance  Hard boiled egg? yolk quite literally powder due overcooking  Fish? Sponge  Actually sucked all moisture mouth couldn't bite down without lot water  rice? Just   don't  Really  Don't   All dessert items tried could bought grocery better quality  Frankly desserts only edible items dozen tried even marginal   It gets better   I asked IPA  waiter no idea IPA was  explained type beer  Oh Bud Light Stella something else $14 told I'd water  Good choice  Which again?  Water  Because no way going pay $14 Budweiser   Oh check later since beers price aren't listed anywhere else hotel  called buffet asked beer prices  supposed 6 8 dollars   Nice hustle buffet waiter  <EOR> Came wife wonderful time  Alaskan King Crab Legs definitely did disappoint  big super juicy meaty  think ate over 20 legs myself     They very good job restocking never worry fighting those legs   In terms sushi selections very limited  However very impressed quality fish  salmon tuna sashimi pieces very fresh thick clean   Everything else tastes just mediocre opinion  tried pork ribs prime cuts etc  but tasted average  wasn't any particular dish really jumped me   I did love dessert section  lot different variety desserts someone doesn't sweet stuff impressed ended eating all dessert   So essentially if want stuff yourself some delicious king crab legs delicious sashimi pieces definitely want check place out  If much seafood lover want more variety sushi then might want consider other buffet places  <EOR> Several years ago gone buffet blown away good was  However going again yesterday shocked  pathetic buffet costs $45 per person  literally better food locally   What f happened? talking wife years but now cannot imagine ever going back  <EOR> The Buffet Bellagio best buffets town  amazing selection everything great  You wait line seated take bit but worth it  Brunch love it   They Prime Rib eggs great bread fresh fish amazing deserts everything between  The service great  check often  buffet grab your plate station station pick like  place clean drinks even good  If picky eater place because such huge selection which choose   Enjoy  <EOR> So Bellagio buffet before thought remembered having great experience although honest can't really remember  when 5 years old guess might matured taste buds since then  knows?  Anyway food mediocre best but choices slim shocked  mean good variety standard American staples chicken mashed potatoes turkey pasta pizza etc  although guess those last two Italian but whatever  But really hoping unique food items don't day to day  definitely place that  way more focused quantity over quality  did sushi bar but type sushi would find supermarket mostly rice basic ingredients blah     The good thing waiter refilled drinks whenever needed even sometimes when didn't need it soda comes free your dinner you're charged extra it   I dunno everything FINE but wait price hoping something great  <EOR> Went Bellagio buffet party 9   40 minute wait which bad   party comprised 2 families if wanted sit together same table would required pay 18% gratuity front   buffet   Egregious fleecing   But wanted sit together   My family never 'Las Vegas buffet' really looking forward it   I thought food quality good   Standouts chicken tikka masala beef ravioli tuna salmon poke mango panna cotta cheesecake   Jill bought drink package well which consists all drink champagne bloody marys 'big 3' beer red white sangria   I'd again   champagne good sangria 1 sip each red white tasted cough syrup   ended being $12 99 1 glass bad champagne   I'm glad but would again  <EOR> We Las Vegas trade show friends wanted eat Buffet  Most buffets Vegas safe bet  much  crab legs very good if  all want eat stick them  only place ever where kobe beef dry rubbery  sushi made buffet but quality sub par  dessert bar awful  really don't much  good say buffet  $50 person better options buffet  Caesear's Palace buffet really really good  buffet Paris Paris delicious let temper statement adding haven't eaten buffet several years might changed   It very surprising buffet poor  money Cafe food much better  <EOR> Poor customer service! just going ask if guest staying hotel basic membership holder use fast lane  won't believe staff entrance said  telling No he actually point sign attitude meaning can't read   Why would ask if sign clear enough?! feel offended just walk away Cesar instead  check experience front desk unpleasant well  He didn't even border take time greet feel welcomed  High end hotel terrible customer service  First last time  <EOR> what really say buffet?  there many options way flustered round came back half plateful crab legs two slices watermelon  anxiety=inability focus   round two three four five much better  think key group complementary flavors together asian flavors meat seafood etc per plate    i gotta say service pretty good considering packed well  4 stars book! <EOR> Sadly last day Vegas  Being last day Vegas half hungover didn't feel eating much probably didn't quite eat money's worth  [  However good time  literally cashier 10 59am according receipt  no line all cashier super nice  front gonna pay just myself she asked if all together  told she told less minute price would change if wanted just pay together  just paid everyone paid back afterward    We stayed few hours opportunity eat breakfast lunch there  much different types food stuffed  If breakfast buffet should really try omelets  when order awesome   also yummy pineapple fried rice ]  I wasn't big fan desserts though but maybe  because just wasn't feeling sweets stuffed  <EOR> Really high end food  Lunch only $19 95 person  If ur looking good buffet Vegas try one  <EOR> I've heard famous Bellagio Buffet since little  Yay finally tried lunch  fair price $25 per person indulge variety food  breakfast foods Italian Asian pizza burgers salad sushi lox herring a personal favorite much much more  assumed would more extravagant but think lobstah shows during dinner  shrimp lunch though  tried little bit everything made happy lox herring trout spicy tuna hand rolls flank steak polenta mussels pizza salad desserts  would absolutely return again more foood!

Seriously love eat   more often care quantity over quality   Yes know should habit   fact buffets reasons moved Las Vegas UNLV!  just don't spreads buffets all over Hawaii heaven   I'm older now metabolism slowin' down just tiny bit   the pooch shows much eatin' if there's no cardio runnin'!  Gone days eating cold pizza breakfast Reubens dining commons lunch God love those things In N Out dinner beer dessert!  noticed palatte gets tired same old thing taste buds surprised every once while     This buffet brings back lots memories   Back college first 'gourmet' buffet school homies ever to   remember Sunday brunch fondly where else could drink all mimosas wanted?  Getting hammered breakfast seemed nice option time!  shabby back then only $25!  felt big spenders!  It's long time but food still good   took kids first ever fancy buffet believe they're used buffets Station Casinos but  another review another time boy surprised!  eyes wide open drooling surprised!  couldn't believe much food could place   Thanks buffet well over 2 hours little sample okay large sample Bellagio offer lunch dinner   More later   Anyway tried just everything had!  town kids APE $**T!

But loved it!!  Wanna sample much gluttony possible!  Best tip give Bellagio lunch but late 3 PM   Pay $20 + tax enjoy last offerings lunch   then prepare dinner!  Dinner items start rolling around 3 30 PM   Good thing because gourmet dinner costs upward $38 + tax depending whether holiday weekend   Save your A$$ some money recession!  use money TUMS afterwards  <EOR> If buffet while you're Las Vegas don't recommend going Bellagio  website says price would $34 99 but waiting over half hour line tell price $48 99  Others waiting line also expected pay $34 99  meal never visit again  because food environment worth price! <EOR> the long line   the line long start twisting your words  looks lot food your fingertips but ain't all that  sure selection vast but don't distracted anything else  eat only expensive things even if oversalted  still most popular buffets  prefer other places now wicked spoon but keep coming back when part group because still most well known everyone's food bucket list  crab legs! <EOR> Really great Buffet!!

First all love clean look place   nothing fancy spectacular but being where located just feel no ordinary buffet   The buffet lines wavy designed starting right side left side facility   I usually skipped first section toward hot food sections instead    I'm big fan cheese bread feel having salads buffets really worth price paying defeats purpose  especially Bellagio just cut chase     Rack lamb Juicious maximus!  Love tenderness rack lamb!  But sometimes chefs stingy only gives 2 pcs so    I'd usually someone help couple more wouldn't additional trip   Prime rib expect?  cooked perfectly juicy well!  If want bloody it   If want well done available well   anyway pretty much available just tell chef  they try accomodate much possible Beef Wellington Delicious beef wrapped bread    did mention buttery bread?  Oh yeah     buttery alright    YUMMY!  What's this?  Many variations fresh made pizzas?  basic kinds would find lower end buffets   all great stuff caliber CPK other fine pizza establishments!  veggie pizza wonderful! But didn't want fill stomach useless carbs   keep moving forward please    Same pasta dishes   looked absolutely wonderful     but pass due carb regulations    no can't sir!  Only sampled wonderful!  Asian food asian    usually excited getting asian food buffets unless Makino's Midori's pls refer other reviews took few bok choys just fill some void veggies column     all     Seafood    ok   took almost everything because cost taste   all seafood great many choose from    but most memorable sea bass    SUPER BUTTERY eating butter straight up!! I wonder if actually butter carved into looking sea bass?  Regardless    melt your mouth chocolate yet fish!  figure! must hopefully offer when visiting place     sometimes leave off menu some reason      sad days Sushi great selection known but some basic selections but tuna ahi poke sashimi super jammin!  Chunky pieces ahi marinated vinegary soy sauce seseme    awesome sashimi!  Soup Cream corn heavenly     drinking liquid gold!   Finally dessert!  Way many selections choose from!

Service extremely fast going tip server lot but she left lunch <EOR> Per usual yelp everything before give try  However sorely disappointed Bellagio's buffet  Nothing particularly bad its just nothing YUM  $30+ person expecting fairly decent food  crab legs super salty everything else bland unmemorable  honestly say prefer cheap Asian buffets over Bellagio's  dessert selection which could've its saving grace since major sweet tooth also huge let down  only thing did well creme brulee hence extra star  <EOR> Mmmm     champagne brunch Bellagio    yum!  So huge fan buffets but admit really good   friends around 12 12 30 waited 15 20 minutes   champagne wasn't bad but eating some sweet stuff bitter    recommend order some orange juice mimosas     The French toast hazelnut chocolate bananas pretty bomb   first round came back seconds very last they weren't making anymore    love it     I'm also fan spicy tuna hand rolls fruit tart dessert     The buffet lot food all things tried liked almost everything at least enough finish it    lot food just okay most meat tried pretty dry but some exceptionally good stuff would keep coming back here   I ate way past full because good!    $29 champagne brunch $23 brunch without champagne <EOR> I tried both Bellagio buffet Wynn buffet since many mixed reviews both  say Wynn buffet much better  boyfriend stood line around 2 30pm stayed until 4pm dinner items which only included some new sushi items crab legs prime rib   spicy tuna hand roll salmon poke probably best part buffet  dessert mediocre  creme brulee tasted pudding very watered down runny consistency  did enjoy peach strawberry self serve sorbet though but much other desserts really stood me  wish more variety choices buffet boyfriend even indicated he back several times only same items he already eaten  <EOR> at first sticker shock over price but worth it   Best buffet Vegas thus far  <EOR> This buffet mediocre best  stuck salad bar salmon platter meats  If want carb place be  Otherwise selection minimal those watching it  <EOR> Hot damn place good!  think hubbie would give 7 stars if he could   He must eaten $100 worth crab legs alone    mention rack lamb ostrich prime rib quail Kobe beef swordfish       Definitely stand buffet back    unless try all other Vegas buffets first! <EOR> I'd say favorite buffet Vegas very clean organized everything want buffet more   some reason when comparing Wynn buffet place just tastes better  Loved king crab legs prime rib dessert but wasn't huge fan asian dishes     that's okay though wasn't really going buffet asian food anyway! haha  And HUGE fan buffets don't give them 5 stars     but say best expensive but definitely worth if you're Vegas! <EOR> The king crab split cracked    hot clarified butter     awesome!!!

Back Bellagio   just can't recommend enough may far say favorite buffet experience Las Vegas date   tried everything   mean    EVERYTHING   all good  Sushi selection alright but imagine hard keep really fresh sushi continuously available throughout day  And haven't even mentioned desserts which actually felt weren't even highlight meal   Sure beautiful good mini servings everything including crème brulée key lime pie carrot cake etcetera etcetera   would satisfied rest buffet if desserts merely ice cream!    By way arrived lunch around 12pm walked right in  No line folks   However when walking around 2p line eat door   If manage keep normal meal hours Vegas seems lines kind you    <EOR> MEH  NO CRAB LEGS NO CARE   Waited line while boyfriend gambled 2 hours waited long endless line  Good thing Bellagio wifi  know wsup  But Sunday brunch suppose wouldn't crab legs but hey expecting some because Vegas! cares if brunch?

BELLAGIO BUFFET!!!!! He used live Vegas he would tell all good things rated award  Ok agreed check went   Waited line 2 hours Sunday pleased all end result  Maybe because Wynn's buffet night before totally blown away it  such high expectations Bellagio's buffet since read such good reviews thought if Wynn awesome Bellagio would buffet heaven   The food unremarkable don't even remember ate besides prime rib crab legs  know tasted something everything but really don't remember anything ate   made bad  Oh also glass green tea   The decor reminded Sizzler  know buffet don't expect chandeliers famous paintings wall but just didn't look would belong Bellagio  Maybe hotel Harrah's across street?  And poor BF now fiance really bad case heartburn few hours later  = <EOR> A great feast more offer mingling morbidly obese  Quality presentation stand outs here  <EOR> I really regretted coming buffet   wife really picky eaters but place really bad   Tuesday evening pretty empty   only three things liked prime rib creme brulee mushroom ravioli   other things bordering disgusting unedible   Some things bad spit them out   usually never spit food only done few times life    Bellagio buffet did three times   cook staff except meat carver guy all seemed uncaring bored   food cooked showed all emotions unfortunately   Usually when read negative reviews am writing now tend brush them off try forget them only focus good reviews cause really want try buffet   But believe skip buffet  don't know other people wrote good reviews buffet ate but certainly same food ate   guess wasn't just though   Lots other people around complaining food too   Many people just ate bite things left rest plate uneaten   happens frequently buffets people waste food but Bellagio day unusual amount wasted food unhappy faces customers   coffee some people rave about   found worst regular McDonald's coffee  drink coffee lot believe when say coffee Bellagio worst drank long long time   If want safe bet then Wynn instead   won't regret it   no don't work Wynn   am just tourist probably just you  <EOR> i came sunday brunch unlimited mimosas beforr such good experience  each time  each time drank much wanted throw because much food too  each time come right back hotel sleep because im drunk full dont want no where  when first came 4 yrs ago such amazing brunch lots seafood lamb rack prime rib lots bomb food    recently  came back 2 yrs ago downhill such cut lamb racks quality crab down  food just impressed wow good need back  service great always mimosas filled top  also amazing time least 2 hrs more drinking  but overall food buffet gone down but its still better flamingos harrahs buffet sure  mean 35 bucks including mimosas isnt bad  but cesar palace buffet new spot buffets thats where where eat at  <EOR> Below average food quality  Everything cold flavorless  would recommend buffet  other higher quality buffets Vegas  <EOR> Disappointed very   When goto Vegas nice buffet brand names  Pairs Bellagio Wynn   why choose Bellagio result? Very disappointed comparing its reputation   We arrived Vegas earlier expected which means dinner plan changed late lunch  Good news no waiting line price cheaper bad news choices food quite limited   First all where does all seafood go? section cocktail shrimp section seafood salad couple hot dishes salmon cod  Then  pretty much it  Lobster? Crab? Oyster? Clams? None exist  Seriously less seafood choices any decent buffet any American city   And don't started salad section  didn't plan feed salad but choice way less  When look few options lettuce leaves croutons dressing feel old country buffet   Maybe because more more Asian people coming visit added sushi session some Chinese dishes  quality choices those dishes impressive though   OK lots choices pizza pasta  Unfortunately seldom eat carbs expect during buffet time attractive me  common sense  feeds pasta buffet? Unless comes black truffle sauce won't eat bite pasta buffet time   And ice cream machine   seriously? gelato just pull handle ice cream machine old country buffet? We're Bellagio most expensive hotel Vegas definitely didn't expected see ice cream machine here   I'll stop whining change some positive feedbacks   Beef dishes good  tried both steak beef brisket both very juicy tender  sure ask chef cut thin slice though otherwise thick  Talking chef smile little bit?  Dessert section impressive must admit  Tons choices kept changing them  Half lunch feeding dessert  Very colorful beautiful unfortunately quite rich same time   Here something interesting around 4pm when finished leave half guests eating area rushing seafood section line up  turned crab legs looks pretty fresh  bad we're very stuffed couldn't take another bite  didn't even bother into line   In general very disappointed experience Bellagio buffet  coming back again  <EOR> We just very disappointed server name julie G  waited long time until she came give drink then she never came back  She never check anymore very friendly  breakfast unenjoyable think server trained better  paying still give tips  However wont return anymore due behavior   Management please fix this! <EOR> Vegas plethora buffets ones Wynn Planet Hollywood Cosmopolitan just name few  Those mixed bag experiences   The Bellagio however classic  typically way particular buffet once year   Under $30 buffet lunch?  almost unbeatable Vegas considering quality buffet you're getting salads seafood Asian Greek American assortment meats seafood during lunch  But also if arrive during 11 3 lunch rush weekends which essentially spans entire lunch time frame prepared other forms entertainment you'll most likely graced 1 2 hour wait   However dinner offer lamb beef wellington crab legs shrimp cocktail steak tartare ahi salmon poke addition goodness serve lunch    More $ More Gluttony? Less $ Less Gluttony?  Expect pay little under $50 dinner but choice trade off yours  <EOR> Went because parents wanted eat buffet heard really good  food good buffet but prefer quality over quantity I'd rather paid $40 pp eat normal restaurant  prime rib pastas good but king crab legs salty  quality sushi ok  <EOR> Great Buffet  stayed Bellagio several times love Buffet Bellagio  last time visited Las Vegas Xmas back experience selections  food well prepared great flavor but Buffet seemed bit under lit  visited brunch since 2014 enjoyed but most older Buffets rather visit new more modern spots  still top Buffets Las Vegas  <EOR> Wow extremely disappointed  used buffet try but today's terrible experience never again  place way over priced under represented food selection  Brunch weekend 34 99 person dinner almost $50 per does include tip  brunch today  usual oatmeal grits waffles French toast omelette bar fruit some crazy looking sausages prime rib pre made runny eggs bacon apple crepes cheese blintz lox bagels far worst bagels ever tasted   Chinese food selection  honest best thing keep mind am partial porridge green onions added clams white wine garlic sauce very Tasty  pastries dry bread horrible overall selection price extremely disappointing  sure if hotel just cheap but guys should try invest some more $$ Into food  Aria much better buffet lower price point  Stay away dine somewhere else  <EOR> Made gluttony buffets add many sins rampant Vegas but admittedly partake in   I've all meals before breakfast brunch lunch dinner  love all  quality price selection really can't Bellagio  Highlights include best creamy just slightly runny scrambled eggs Cute petite jars marmalade Alaskan king crab legs yes yes most places but still good Chilean Sea Bass endangered but delicious Sushi bar made order Steak tar tar again made fresh order Dessert Bar Bread Bar  This latest trip try some Ostrich Buffalo meat too  While something would particularly crave again nice able try   Bellagio always go to buffet  meal day sin city    Tip Come around 3 30p enjoy Linner lunch prices  skip lines if stay hotel guest  Otherwise come early else prepared wait hour + line  <EOR> WAY DISAPPOINTED!

My only real disappointment Prime Rib  While I'd really prefer rib eye steak over prime rib any day invest occasional slice when opportunity presents itself  But slice fell short  Lackluster marbling dry little no flavor even really pink center  first cut!!! highly disappointed but enough other good stuff really care     Dessert station rocked all day everyday twice Sunday!!! particularly impressed key lime tarts  Yum!!! <EOR> My gf suggested eat because better food which suppose implied higher price charge dinner    This case    When you're Vegas or anywhere really remember buffet buffet buffet    Sure they've Kobe not really aren't Japan beef lamb sushi Alaskan king crab legs snow crab flank steak shrimp cocktail         but all tastes buffet quality food which better way saying they're mostly terrible    Do know difficult must coordinate meal big enough feed hundreds if thousands people? possibly think quality factor cooking meals?  Where satisfaction getting thick slice Kobe beef if tough your knife can't through it?  Like king crab legs? Then you'll hate them since they're all machine cut partially frozen tastes they've sitting salt water bath week    I wouldn't even mess sushi  very very picky fish whatever serving looked step above grocery store    Even desserts mediocre    If want eat well Vegas look decent restaurant drop $70 you'd spend there  last and mean LAST buffet visit proved once all no matter they're serving charging nothing beats paying freshly made food  isn't worth cramming sub par servings down your gullet just justify cost paid here  Unless no discerning tastes you're just big fatty loves binge eat hey no judgment here    your thing then just isn't place waste money Vegas  <EOR> Perhaps case being first buffet remember having Vegas perhaps just good day but Bellagio Buffet trip well worth wait price  To note Sunday brunch $29 95 unlimited champagne    After getting seated table paying greeted waiter gives drinks all sorts   Afterwards variety food wonderful   seafood breakfast items noodles meat nearly every item buffet seemed great taste mind behind just joy eat   unlimited succulent shrimp delicious bowtie noodles fettuccine sauce chicken superb   Add banana hazelnut french toast great desserts sugar less cheescake wonderful hard time leaving    Admittedly Asian cuisine par all whether oddly flavored shrimp spring rolls bland sushi some other bland dishes but variety taste great     The line long non Bellagio residents Sunday Brunch wait hour   Bellagio guests first priority   So yes am Las Vegas newbie but introduction buffet life Vegas life seems pretty good  <EOR> wide selection classic buffet eats accommodation different cuisines Very early switch over time lunch dinner dinner prices begin 3 00PM but won't require clearing buffet order begin dinner welcomed stay Servers hard flag down but you'll need ask drinks utensils them blast air conditioning buffet making dining area very cold  no ice cream gelato bar just machine gives choice chocolate vanilla soft serve Line ups become brutal 2 00PM  Come earlier if wanting lunch     WHAT OFFERED EXCLUSIVELY DURING DINNER Crab legs Nigiri Salmon Poke Steaks larger selection BBQ items higher qualities meat Oyster More dessert options Creme brulee cake etc <EOR> Low quality buffet food  breakfast buffet 2 $80 expensive was  <EOR> It alright   Nothing extra special  Much breakfast food cold   The prime rib fried rice interesting choice breakfast food but good  <EOR> Last time felt crab legs item would bringing back  back trip some crab legs now dessert options probably bring back next time  can't wait see one themselves next   Here low down pre split king crab legs pot clarified butter along finest chocolatey desserts ever found buffet paired delicious angus roast beef sushi grade tuna salmon roast duck quail everything else would ever want buffet    The kicker $30  its Bellagio won't feel you're cheapass going buffet instead pricey 5 star joint  Need more proof its good? many other buffets snaking line front them? 20 minute wait absolutely worth everyone line knows just join them wait glory   I've always stood opinion best buffet Vegas based food price location sticking yet again  <EOR> The Buffet Bellagio always more premium Buffet options strip since early 2000s  since outclassed Wicked Spoon Cosmopolitan Bacchanal Buffet Caesars but given price quality ratios Bellagio hasn't bad choice really good prime rib   These days found prime rib subpar lack wait lines days may show it  prices still premium ever but food just doesn't particularly strike home anything amazing may done point   In addition switched beverage service self service which personally don't mind but use those Coke machines all syrup options which normally if actually stocked machines all syrups  Instead most them taste subpar   The Buffet Bellagio feel gone downhill throughout years while still solid option price point more likely Wicked Spoon not fan Bacchanal mid tier buffet   TIP Prime rib still good but great used be  <EOR> I am buffet guy but group tonight chose this  ok  amazing  Everything expected any similar restaurant area  Probly return  <EOR> Great price even better food!

I'd pick Bellagio over Wynn buffet cuz least Bellagio good selection fresh fruit vs Wynn's fruit in syrup crap  Oh yea remember Bellagio chocolate covered strawberries  <EOR> This buffet absolutely MASSIVE selection food   favorite dishes prime rib pastas side salad   course desserts!!!  wasn't impressed seafood though sushi very sub par paella kind fishy tasting   But such large selection food easy try little bit everything find like   Arrive line early before 5 30PM because line gets long that   Once inside pretty spacious don't really wait anything   price kind expensive $40ish but since one time kind outing thought worth it   fun finally see fuss eat best buffet Vegas! <EOR> Not impressed breakfast  food fresh tasted frozen  Presentation food plain poor  Reminds upscale cafeteria  Most staff don't speak English friendly helpful  asked cook if he could warm french toast because cold he replied don't microwave  cook egg station extremely pushy rude  Eggs runny french toast pancakes dry cold sausage bacon greasy throughly cooked fruit mushy  deserts ok  worth $15! suggestion try M hotel Henderson  <EOR> It almost trash  paid over $80 2 person think  couldn't eat anything cause taste trash fresh af  Food junk  But don't want give 1 star cause food trash enough but servers kind old ladies gentle men  don't want them lose job  <EOR> Staff hostess assign seating terrible  Both main hostess other took seat rude very friendly bad day maybe  floor manager no better  Young inexperience trying resolve conflict without first understanding problem  first mistake bias toward hostess instead listening customer  happen customer also right Food Very disappointed especially those price  Food no better typical Reno buffet half price   If really want buffet highly recommend Wicked Spoon buffet Cosmopolitian hotel  guys class food awesome same price  Night day compared Belllagio they're even close  <EOR> So read holiday menu before decided take family dinner premium price    paid 211 party four   Several holiday items listed menu being offererd   No lobster tail caviar lamb chops scallops salted caramel mousse    buffet small quality great did but give three star premium price yet offering listed which would made price worth it   First last time recommend M resort great food great price huge selection e wine beer include <EOR> Only second best buffet Vegas  write right reviewing Wynn Buffet say WYNN  both buffets consecutive nights personally thought Bellagio could some catching do   For Bellagio actually seemed buffet  table arrangements decorations made seem kinda touristy opposed classy Wynn  Albeit food still great but something seemed lacking when compared Wynn's   Bottom line same cost wait time Wynn your premium Vegas buffet experience  <EOR> My favorite buffet Vegas  set standard higher quality food buffets Rio's world buffet faded top spot  guess people just tired everything fried  Excellent quality choices reasonably prices esp breakfast lunch   Only downside wait long when busy try peak mealtimes  <EOR> I've lot major buffets Caesars Mirage Wynn Paris etc  buffet still all time favorite Sunday brunch   love omelet bar most variety items compared other buffets   last time individual going around making sure all items fresh made properly whatever else look for   threw whole plate freshly made french toast some reason another but whatever glad sure give customers highest quality food   place worth forking money you'll glad did  <EOR> Totally agree Yami's comment place  last year thought OK time just disappointing  holiday brunch during labor day weekend sure whether anything poor quality selection food  barely average  Bacchanal MUCH BETTER far tell  <EOR> 3 9 5 fan because 1  love buffets 2  love seafood mussels kicked ass!

Went during weekday lunch 22 99 person very pleased  Although selection poor certain aspects for sushi only california rolls spicy tuna roll very happy overall quality consistency choices  heavier meat cuts including St Louis pork ribs brisket flank steak all very solid  Even Asian foods perspective Asian very tasty  Interestingly many breakfast foods still available well into lunch hours including omelette station if  your thing  Finally looks put full desserts repertoire lunch which includes awesome sugar free options just tasty guiltier counterparts   If looking Vegas buffet happy without breaking bank buffet bellagio great option! <EOR> I decided give shot based reviews here  line waiting but wasn't bad  think only waited 15 minutes table  really impressed choices quality food  many delicious items everything fresh  thing don't understand why people pile crab legs high plates they've never seen them before run out?    tried Wynn buffet following night very disappointed selection buffet even quality seemed few steps below Bellagio      Another thing people complaining Bellagio   I'm sure still stuffed your faces  If unimpressed problem then let them know ASAP don't eat   go home write negative review few days later  <EOR> Over weekend opportunity eat dinner Bellagio Buffet also Caesars Palace Buffet both rated some top Vegas Buffets   found Bellagio Buffet having better quality food tasting lot better Caesars Palace however Bellagio lot less selection food items  Bellagio offers Caviar where Caesars charges extra however Caesars caviar lot higher quality  very disappointed cheese Italian meat selection Bellagio very weak   both basically same crab legs shrimp however Caesars lot more fish items less meat items  guess say Bellagio offers better quality variety   However Bellagio dessert section very weak compared Caesars if dessert person Caesars definite way go  Bellagio also $10 00 less Caesars  seeing Caesars buffet made realize Bellagio buffet needs facelift looking old outdated  <EOR> This place gives buffets good name  food always fresh interesting  breakfast brunch possibly best Las Vegas  Friday Saturday night gourmet dinner buffet unreal  Try Beef Wellington Venison Steak Tartar just name few  <EOR> My second time going breakfast buffett time just pleasant aa time before! soon walk smell high quality air! place best omelette bar strip far concerned   flavor unmatched! variety offered beats other casino buffetts hands down   Highly recommend Bellagio buffet even if you're staying worth trip  <EOR> MUCH BETTER  My husband enjoyed lunch Thursday afternoon happy much more pleasant experience food service when visited during month prior   The servers hostesses seemed less confused disorganized moment walked however very friendly seemed care much personal interaction guests waited line   I several sushi items hearty salad salad bar everything fresh delicious   Salmon crab roll particularly tasty tuna sushi also very good   husband few slices prime rib he said very tender perfect into mini sandwich some plentiful bread options   also happy service received which much more attentive friendlier experienced prior     The issue when order mimosa bring champagne sparkling wine really orange juice separately   recommend serving mimosas without presentation does bode well cleanliness guest enjoyment     We consider dining again upcoming Vegas trip happy see food service back par people come expect dining establishment Bellagio   Cheers! <EOR> The variety meat desserts fruits enough cost high price!

About 22 lunch 35 dinner tax included  I've never bad experience here   everything tastes pretty awesome! Drinks bit pricey though included buffet price  Stick water  <EOR> Pretty mixed bag but can't say would again !!!!!    lunch buffet   First off felt service kind bad   did keep entrance payment line moving well good   However thought people doing drinks well behind counter weren't very friendly   Yeah lot tables people through but does detract experience   The food great   Having heard buffet best Vegas expecting lot but guess should expected small step above Old Country Buffet   salad fruit bar pretty good but those foods can't really screw aren't they?  Maybe review overly negative but if Vegas just short time paying $20 person whatever meal should something AWESOME   Somewhere else  <EOR> I recently visited 3 years feel going downhill  service food variety food ambience sinking  Bellagio needs BIG re vamp if want compete HOT buffets town  <EOR> I guess $45 buffet nice wide selection meats foods    First early if want avoid 1hr + wait especially if friends large group    Second meat selection when came alright although kobe beef absolutely disgusting friend raved brocolini but did enjoy some less fancy stuff prime rib pesto mash potatoes sashimi  mean feel cannot never win your money's worth vegas buffet but place wasnt bad   Third didn't care seafood crab legs etc nothing add that  Fourth dessert selection pretty good although most desserts just pretty look things sweet etc  creme brulee alright but again desserts cute pretty but GOOD needed more it    My waiter also sucked major balls because he never refilled damn OJ looked cranky all time  <EOR> All buffets should modeled one   3 hours kill before leaving airport decided slowly eat lunch   little plate little plate there     picture   Well     much choose      EVERYTHING good   Totally worth wait  <EOR> Best buffet strip! family used only buffet when would take kid always thought great but nothing compare to  Then older started coming other families friends now over 21! still maintain Buffet Bellagio simply best   My most recent experience last week friend knows what's when comes buffets Bellagio  decided come just before drive home because knew no would hungry going here  If 3 45 pay lunch price but put dinner 4 00   yes!

Beef wellington sirloin steak   I must say though buffet catered Asian tourists  didn't great variety items just large quantities it  large variety pastas but impressive  Nothing stood besides steak killer horseradish    Soup Jeez  Maybe because huge soup person but selection really poor  Your standard chicken noodle clam chowder vegetable minestrone   They section entrees prepared per order but wasn't good either  wasn't customized any way just poured lady two huge soup pots    Seafood Though late night but keeping coming all fresh seafood! Though everyone only grabs snow crab   I going cocktail shrimp However   the salmon tilapia other fish amazing  cream crop but stood enough keep going back more    Dessert Sad!

Stuffed! <EOR> I really wasn't impressed buffet   buffets 1 3rd price better this   didn't eat much buffet over $50+ person felt should better   The Kobe beef just marginal expected   Prime rib alright   sushi bar didn't large variety just very minimal   caviar three types   Really could done without but least wanted try this   However husband really did love coconut macaroons best tasted   large selection desserts felt more options things buffet   I did really broccolini but pay much greens?  husband some family tasted few Asian dishes said wasn't great     My husband did pork tenderloin very tender   some Thanksgiving type food maybe cooking buffet diminished taste food   don't know   bit disappointing    There also taco bar some Latino type foods but didn't look appealing   Salad bar also marginal   Sweet Tomatoes them way outdone here   Guess thinking Bellagio grand hotel would expect grand buffet   But think expectations high   would expect would better $15 20 buffet but wrong   Very generous mom foot bill 4 children families   $$$$$   I would add server waiting half table Lorde sp? top notch   He excellent give 10 star 5 stars   He cleared plates regularly filled drinks regularly humorous but polite   Very professional he worked hard 2 hours only table but other tables he responsible for   Great job him   didn't pay attention other end table party 16 though   Some family did lot crab but lazy crack shells meat rarely ever eat crab   did seem stocked well   It's bad buffet but price would expected much better selection variety foods presented  <EOR> This honestly most expensive effin' buffet ever eaten but other RE MAX buddies wanted eat thought why not?      This ended being really good though!  sushi fair considering nowhere near water LOL prime rib which tasty whole bunch other fare   even offer certain adult beverages all drink deal   did partake because cheap liquor them all drink     Give try well worth $40 something you'll pay! <EOR> UMM say overrated? people rated highly buffet eaten any other buffets Vegas really off night when came in!  THEY DEDICATE 1 4 BUFFET BREAD GOODNESS SAKE! $40 per person buffet does really? best thing california roll only because used real crab meat it! service also very good but because sat bar    Can someone tell what's special buffet?

Let's just start off saying LOT choices  Something everybody  crab legs great meat selection  Recommend lamb  Yes caviar bar but just know real caviar but still tasty  Overall good experience!! <EOR> After crapping tables some your money back    hit buffett tables   The food good comes fresh all time   desserts small taste everything   wait staff attentive keep hot water coming green tea  <EOR> The buffet nice variety items but huge may imagine $40+ per person  line dinner huge  food delicious no complaints  alcohol $15 per anything  <EOR> The buffet bellagio much better Caesars buffet price cheaper  Suggest people come all types meeting  service excellent well <EOR> I say underwhelmed experience  super nice hotel Vegas would expect buffet just nice match  course price point super high  actually reservation thought large group private room which case top placed 2 separate tables  won't back annual function thoroughly disappointed front  bunch variety expected buffet some food quality felt average also expected buffet but really didn't layout  Food seemed logical near each other far away  flow just seemed bizarre buffet itself crowded long lines popular items such crab legs  Even inside place constantly line sat watched 30 minutes waiting whole party arrive  Even tables seemed open impersonal crowded  other buffets just much food selection better layout  won't back especially price expect bit more  <EOR> This best place ate Las Vegas   I thought would $35 per person breakfast but ended being two people  friend hung over enjoy but ended paying whatever!  The best salmon ever BUFFET  eggs good shrimp good canadian bacon fruit plate  YUMMY! <EOR> Most important message between times right before switch over dinner pay lunch prices dinner options   $20 lunch   Since Rio buffet first buffet remember going Vegas always compare others it   surprised selection bigger since Vegas city excessiveness   large variety foods salads seafood meat pasta desserts everything between   Mmmm    king crab legs   Saltier smaller Wynn but still good   least crack them you   best salmon ahi poke could devoured whole plate of   Fresh seafood!!!!  The desserts ok thought would more would yummier but eating all did didn't really need dessert anyway   And server top refilling iced teas   Overall Bellagio really good but think prefer Wynn buffet because quality food better  <EOR> Very pricey 3 star quality decor cleanliness 5 star price rather some middle road place ballys golden nugget staff extremely crass low quality terms service no hiring filters table given unclean actually wait someone come clean server behind counter didn't even know chicken dish he serving when asked unable respond clear English call supervisor didnt know no labels provided one menu classy all sushi pasta steak could find decent item complete rip off 35 dollars per person <EOR> As quarterly annual Vegas visitor Buffet @ Bellagio hands down favorite weekends  Made mistake catching midweek extended Vegas stay significantly diminished weekend fare   With mid 20's metabolism affinity cardiovascular activities abilities put down abnormal volumes food  break down avg  meal there   Salad bar fully stocked whether your own pre fixed offerings have  side note hard boiled eggs! great usual spinach salad w turkey carving section  Carving section regulars something different  Last ostrich duck    Sushi plenty just rolls some ngiri  But tuna salmon poke along seaweed salad  always sucker pizza cocktail shrimp  Then some prime rib  All which top notch    The dessert section cracks center buffet every time predominantly surrounded women  notice fragrant area compared everywhere else  eat nothing but sweets  But yea polished off half dozen chocolate covered strawberries white chocolate mousse apple pie ice cream    The wait long if 7 later  usually try 6 30 basically walk straight into place no wait  way walk off food off some drinking gambling 10 11 hungry again  Then starts all over    <EOR> I just returned 4th Vegas trip 6 hours ago   Vegas buffets must sure bet   Bellagio buffet would say peeled jumbo shrimp highlight well smoked salmon   buffet more pricey ones $20 $40 depending when go but definitely worth it   Definitely early since lines long  <EOR> Get early feast all night  Huge selection just anything your little fat heart could desire  bee lined Kobe Beef seemed crab legs major draw many massive piles leg debris some tables   Overall just experience itself say hit buffet made bow you  <EOR> As all buffets few dishes food doesn't even sense anymore !!!

Actually he really hasn't noticed all! place isn't even packed  When stopped first time first words Oh didn't know drink package   guess look free soda kind guy?!   came Las Vegas three goals mind which enjoying brunch Bellaggio  Oh well quote famous singer Meatloaf? two three ain't bad   Actually Jorge just refilled glass  guess having Yelp app open phone some action! <EOR> Warning people gourmet dinner does start 3pm says website!   I wanted try new buffet Vegas decided try Bellagio  arrived around 2pm Saturday try gourmet dinner starts 3pm  weekend brunch just alright only great thing crab legs omelette  When 3pm rolled around excited try lamb chop  asking several times being told would ready 5 min lamb chops did served till 3 40pm  Even though only 40 min late still false advertising! When did finally try lamb chops good all  took bite couldn't any more   The only good item Alaskan king crab legs serve during gourmet dinner  Alaskan king crab legs did served around 3pm  served 2 stars that  <EOR> This ultimate gluttonous experience only way rip off casino!  I looking seafood buffet came based reviews disappointed whatsoever!  The service great clearing tables getting your drinks everything ate good if great   The crab legs good   prefer warm but probably would dried them keep 'em warm   cold   am big fan chicken soup kept going back more   best ever restaurant   desserts awesome   cheesecake flan sorbet ice cream custard    and more   prime rib pizza fruits all kinds salads rice      etc   I'm going back sure  <EOR> Some people Vegas gamble some nightlife but eat  just under $40 buffet may seem bit pricey but well worth cost long eat appropriate items so stay away salad    The variety great ranging various types sushi seafood meats pastas even pizza! Sadly pizza looked worst thing but why would eat pizza buffet when prime rib shrimp cocktail all crab legs could eat!  Dessert even better almost much variety main dishes  Choose frozen yogurt sorbet more pastries could ever imagine  <EOR> I excited check bottomless champagne brunch here  Champagne brunch Sat Sun just few additional dollars your bill   Checked bunch amigas say wasn't impressed   We all know buffet food isn't stellar but being Bellagio thought would bit better  Most food over under salted  Nothing really stuck out  OMG Sushi really bad  Very dry all rice!  Desserts so so nothing really stood out   only good part all champagne great wait staff  Otherwise  Your run mill buffet  food looks pretty but taste isn't there   Definitely find Rio Buffet Carnival One Paris much better food options   Food presentation isn't greatest but you'll happy taste  <EOR> If lived Vegas would eat every meal forklift carry every time  most bang buck buffet ever  amazing selection quality there    Tar tars smoked salmon start  Half split crab legs unpeeled jumbo schrimp well continue starting because eaiting days  Skip all pasta bread some Chilean Sea Bass Prime Rib Wellington  Repeat few times then hit dessert  many different desserts meal itself if just ate that  Some Creme Brule Tarts Cakes you'll heaven just feel bulemic search closest toilet   This far best 10 000 calorie meal your money buy  sure between Mon Thurs save $8 pratically same food  If feel guilty just clubbing night hyphy dance off walk out  <EOR> The buffet Bellagio best buffet believe EVER had  I'd truly rate experience 4 5   We arrived during prime lunch hours told wait two hours but additional $15 person yes YOU! may skip line  where you  spent $75 lunch two   That being said vacation food while perhaps worry worth $35pp! plenty oh SO good!

Personally think preferred less expensive buffet Mandalay Bay which serves harder eat but just delicious dungeness crabs  <EOR> They Caviar Bar!

Super good!! Dessert section great well   Can crowded suggest getting line early    *tip If your hate cold seafood your crab legs steamed  Just ask chef seafood section  <EOR> I hard time deciding hit Bellagio Wynn buffet   I even asked taxi driver others preference  ended Bellagio since closer hotel  paid $28+gratuity each dinner    It Sunday night 7 30 PM  line 45 minutes deep  Overall great spread but upscale anticipated   Just everything very good but still tasted any other buffet Vegas  Which reminds conversation taxi driver few years ago  driver said reason why most buffets Vegas taste same buy food same commissary   sort Costco hotels   just reheat add more dishes theirs different   don't know if  true not   but wonder  BTW crab legs served chilled  no hot crab sight  crab first batch being served partially frozen which did care for   probably because couldn't replenish fast enough  However come pre sliced lengthwise easier eat   Also restrooms conveniently located inside buffet area   Service good friendly    Tip your first trip buffet fill your plate crab legs expensive cuts meat  your second plate more crab protein and or starch salads  always feel eat money's worth when order  <EOR> Not worth $49 entrance fee  crab legs frozen crawfish brown dead before cooked them imagine sushi lacking creativity  meats pretty good    but wouldn't come again  <EOR> Came Thanksgiving Day line ridiculous  Again else expect ? dining  Thanksgiving Day  Thankfully Noir Mlife card which allowed straight front line  service great but food quality great used be  am still fan Bacchanal buffet! <EOR> I'd give place 3 5 stars if could  Came late lunch waited line 25minutes  Food decent waiter quick drinks  failed mentioned stop bringing new food 2 30pm having paid already limited buffet selection  <EOR> Went buffet twice breakfast very happy did   All you can eat breakfast items $17?  Yes please!  Scrambled eggs little wet but cook preparing eggs omelets order   Meats breakfast pizza pastries just anything could want   Didn't try lunch dinner though  <EOR> We first tried buffet fathers day  through 1hour long line miss lunch dinner cut off time minute! Now weren't even sure where gonna hubby chose Buffet last minute  expecting dinner prices but once saw sign lunch still meant be! But said next pay clock changed did prices food took FOREVER change brunch dinner  irritated hour sat done switching over    we left lil angry hungry  payed much wait even eat!  Fast forward last week  cousins come into town stay Bellagio invite buffet because line passes  lil nervous but made sure 6pm dinner would full swing! glad gave another go!! food delicious! crab already cut prepared salads tasty! prime rib melted mouth!! couldn't stop eating  terribly large buffet but offer worth it  Oh if order orange juice good stuff fresh squeezed but crap machine places usually have  hot tea die for!!! Visit buffet worth it! <EOR> I think place better dinner buffet most Vegas hotel buffets  everything like good grill seafood selections fresh salad sushi made to order etc  It's crowded good reasons  But tons people may effect dinning experience lots loud people  servers busy your table may cleared fast enough  But all food quality  4 Stars food  would eat again food price  <EOR> I buffet past weekend MLK weekend  say success! girlfriends around 2 30pm  took time eating  eventually stayed until dinner items came 4pm  Yes ate lot  But also ate really slow since night before course filled little much alcohol! pesto mashed potatoes which good! rack lamb whole rotisierre chicken  When dinner items came course alaskan king crab legs snow crab legs  chicken noodle soup perfect night drinking  also Ostrich  tried because figured I'd never eat anywhere else  bad  Tastes normal  servers friendly  full bar there  sushi selection wasn't best  <EOR> This place really overrated   don't think anything special buffet   Food mediocre selection most varied seen   Service horrible too waited 20 minutes just cup water   price bad brunch though  <EOR> Overpriced overrated buffet! sushi section 10x  worst Todai which isn't good begin with  only thing worth eating sea bass  lamb chop no taste pasta hospital food  buffet many times quality getting worse  <EOR> Die Buffets Las Vegas sind aus meiner Erfahrung alle im Vergleich zu den vergangenen Jahren recht teuer geworden auch als Gast des eigentlichen Hotels hat man keinen Preisvorteil mehr  Das Buffet im Bellagio unterscheidet sich hier ebenfalls nicht  Wir waren hier zum Frühstück und konnten feststellen dass das Angebot schon vergleichsweise reichhaltig und frisch ist  Die typischen Amerikanischen Frühstücksgewohnheiten lassen sich hier ohne Probleme befriedigen wer es etwas mehr nach exotisch möchte findet zumindest diverse Frühstücksflocken eine Omelett Bar und reichlich Obst und Früchte  Das Gast bedient sich inzwischen selbst auch bei den Getränken  Die Auslagen wurden während unseres Aufenthaltes regelmässig bestückt und die Servicekraft besuchte uns auch regelmässig am Tisch um das überflüssige Geschirr abzuräumen  Die Qualität der Lebensmittel ging Ordnung ich persönlich sehe nur den recht hohen Preis für meinen Nahrungsmittelbedarf nicht ganz gerechtfertigt  Es ist vollkommen klar dass ein Buffet immer eine Mischkalkulation ist  Vorteil vom Bellagio Buffet ist eindeutig die Frische der Lebensmittel und das aufmerksame Personal hier ist man gut bedient  <EOR> I best buffets when under influence performance enhancing supplements otherwise just waste money but Bellagio buffet wasn't drunk anything enjoyed it  think made total six trips 3rd servings entrees couple helpings dessert tried congee some other stuff  disappointed no seafood but maybe came wrong time  pleased but life short same buffet Las Vegas sure if return  <EOR> It's just another buffet city  long lines same food any other MGM property there's nothing really stand out  quality food decent but didn't replenish often people eating it  <EOR> Hubby checked place couple weeks ago wonderful time!

<EOR> I experience eating May 6 2010  did find amusing restaurant called 'The Buffet usually more unique name it   Overall food good especially if you're into seafood  service superb server Elger seemed keep drinks flowing magically  Pricing you'd expect Vegas buffet type hotel runs $29 99   My only complaint why cannot give them more three stars  although restaurant non smoking which seems norm everywhere Vegas restaurants now smoke casino wafts basically ruined dining experience  did let Hotel know next time Vegas try back reevaluate  <EOR> Sad say Bellagio buffet but goes  Thursday night kids  Buffet same say five ten years ago   restaurant going south few years  Few years ago used Wagu beef Prime Rib   but today using much lower grade beef  crab legs serving snow crab king crab  could keep going but idea  Sushi section terrible   Using cheap rice properly seasoned paper thin slice if tuna salmon  <EOR> Came several times think OK  IDK why people think great   quality food wasn't anything special   waitresses always looked didn't want there   Well then don't want either!

Saturday gourmet buffet some extras beef wellington pretty good lamb chops   also selections venison prime rib but both incredibly bad overcooked RAW rare   never seen snow crab B buffet guessing new   also usual king crab legs but both king snow partially frozen TINY   sure if party gone earlier would able bigger more meaty ones but oh well   first timer buffet would good but coming back eat again would really difficult justify $40+ price tag   Even comp would probably prefer enjoyable more peaceful meal CAFE! <EOR> Hands down best Buffet tried Vegas long shot $32 per person pretty reasonable come folks Vegas! early which great since seems quite line otherwise   I thought carving stations far best! All meat cooked perfectly seasoned perfection! salads actually quite delicious usually  something steer clear buffet but don't miss out!

The wait wasn't bad around 30 minutes  pay immediately when reach front wait some more open table   If take step back overview entire buffet line actually isn't much variety few stations same food items just setup different sides accompaniments take good amount space well  started cold station consisted smoked salmon smoked trout few seafood ceviche seafood salads  good all especially smoked trout tasted spoiled rather smoked  salmon all right great  Snow Crabs fresh off taste  tried two pieces thinking first just bad but nope  They're all bad  saving grace King Crab which sweet fresh  course loaded myself that  Other food items enjoyed pizzas pesto mashed potatoes   it  prime rib wasn't good all  wasn't seasoned enough meat more cold side   The weakest station far ever experienced Sushi Asian station  sushi your super basic rolls  also hand made tuna roll summer rolls which both AWFUL  nori tuna roll soft rice tough   basically probably sat while  same summer roll  rice wrapper thick tough  inedible literally pull wrapper mouth because couldn't even chew it  filling tasted terrible well  Connected station cheese meat portion which again your super basic cheeses meats   Don't started Chinese section! Seeing fried rice fried noodles overcooked Chinese Broccoli congee wonton soup no wontons even visible disheartening   There breakfast station which your basics scrambled egg sausages waffles eggs benedict bacon French toast potatoes etc  Plus ham turkey carving station omelet station  Come 2PM rid breakfast station!  The dessert section looks big appears many selections if you're just walking while you're grabbing your main course items but when ready dessert actually isn't much selection because half same stuff other  dessert wasn't very good all caramel flan tiramisu bread rice pudding really bad raspberry white mousse cake awful   Overall expecting something more something different something atypical usual buffets experienced outside Las Vegas but wasn't expecting see most basic low end buffet especially being located Bellagio  bewildered  Did come rare day where everything?

I'd expect Bellagio that  switching plates lunch end run but stuffed pass  I'd give 4 5 but rounded because sure lunch dinner also amazing choices  <EOR> Probably best bang your buck far buffets strip   came sunday brunch 3pm switched over dinner menu 4pm woot woot double selection   Good quality food reasonable $25 +5 unlimited champagne   selection quite big Wynn but price difference I'd say Bellagio better deal      start choice 5 6 different cooked fish items grilled swordfish grilled bluenose roasted bluenose salmon seared halibut grilled chilean sea bass cooked 2 different ways   cooked fishes items combined Alaskan king crab legs snow crab legs dinner sushi options destroy Wynn's seafood selection   course prime rib but buffet doesn't prime rib come your crappy Reno buffet it      desserts really good dunno friend Susy talking saying they're mess all tasted good looked   Except those little faux Ice cream cones those weren't good all    All all solid buffet you'll only need meal all day long! trust me  <EOR> After Googling countless Vegas buffets boyfriend decided would come some best ratings  came Fathers Day around $100  only wait few minutes seated around 8 30pm  line rather long behind though just time   This place huge  full bar but alcoholic beverages cost extra  Soda tea juice coffee included   So many different types food  Seafood crab salmon tuna etc   Meat rib eye turkey ham etc    pasta sushi caviar salads BBQ noodles  pretty much little everything  dessert bar? YES PLEASE  Cakes cheesecake muffins cookies ice cream  bomb  only negative I'd say lot meats especially turkey very dry overheard few people mention cooks didn't seem care  But everything else fantastic    Will definitely come back next time town! Hopefully won't come holiday won't expensive haha  <EOR> We came 2 30 transition period food wasn't great  options better 4pm  enjoyed sushi creme brûlée  crab legs weren't freshly steamed though icy cold = <EOR> I really looking forward going buffet bellagio ever since seeing chow down countdown travel channel  high expectations but underwhelmed experience  food good but nothing super memorable  say am harsh because price expecting way more  Maybe shouldn't such high expectations?  Pictures attached <EOR> We Vegas over Thanksgiving weekend  really wanted nice Vegas buffet since hadn't eaten before decided check buffet Bellagio  line bit ridiculous but dealt it  gave toddler opportunity take nice long nap  probably should just gone somewhere else   We hit sweet spot right before lunch ended right before dinner started  Lunch prices dinner food  pay holiday prices though which sucked    The service horrible  given initial drinks then never asked if wanted more  literally piles plates table before cleared even midway through meal waiter told he getting off work he wanted give drink bill then because might want more???    The food OK best  Fortunately smart stuck pricier options wouldn't feel ripped off but still wasn't impressed  crab legs shrimp both tasted fishy crab legs ice crystals meat first prime rib roast massively overcooked dry even center cuts second done nicely but cut most ridiculously thin slices  Sushi lamb squab etc  all just average  pastas reminded pastas hot buffet Souplantation   The average food even awful service probably would all forgivable if wasn't other patrons  You'd think people never eaten before never learned manners lives! People literally shoving each other way cutting lines chance slice meat  line squab woman only pushed way front but proceeded pile plate over dozen those little birds   Overpriced overrated miserable experience  <EOR> Wide selection  Food good  Prime rib very tasty  Deserts very good  Servers staff rude clearly miserable  <EOR> Yum! visited buffet lunch  perfect group  no line only time waited them table together  good selection food personally happy  could eaten lot more prime rib ribs but didn't  agree some other Yelpers though wish little bigger selection desserts  0ur waitress cool she even brought two cheesecakes over candles them two friends celebrating birthdays  sure visit Bellagio buffet again future  <EOR> $33 fathers day buffet   the line sunday take hour but once u worth cuz brunch buffet king crab legs snow crab legs   while herbed polenta pretty good well various carving stations sweet station mediocre   the service decent your meal comes w juice tea cranberry orange milk coffee green tea   Overall decent but nothing spectacular <EOR> For $26 person feasted waffles sausage eggs pancakes feta spinach pizza sweet potato puree fabulously decadent green salad pasta  Hubby indulged sushi prime rib pesto mashed potatoes   Then ridiculous dessert platter carrot cake chocolate eclairs fruit tarts cream puffs chocolate layer cake bowl vanilla ice cream Butterfinger topping    Had wait line 45 minutes but I'd say money's worth!  certainly didn't need eat again any time soon! <EOR> Voted Number 1 buffet Vegas   course try it  Maybe brunch lunch menu but wasn't impressed  lamb just OK  Nothing Spectacular  cut Prime Rib served dry over cooked  curry chicken great presentation but lacked major taste  All food looked great but no mouth orgasms folks The only good thing place dessert  everything all tasted wonderful    Next time try dinner  Maybe dinner buffet voted number 1? Definitely better buffets Roseville Lincoln buffet  <EOR> Came dinner Monday night pretty slow here  All staff working place very efficient polite  For $38 nothing special whatsoever   Prime Rib very very dry no flavor all  Corned beef good but again very dry  Dry turkey dry rotisserie chicken  I see trend    Salad bar ok   Several different toppings dressings nothing haven't seen any other salad bar  Italian area   Several pastas pizzas   Beef ravioli's just OK   Cavatelli sun dried tomatoes gorgonzola cheese good  Asian area   Boring   Good chicken shu mai terrible looking chow mein  Taco bar seriously lacking each time walked nobody even working it  The time guy working he unloading tortillas plastic bags   Seafood area   Cold crab legs cold shrimp Jonah claws   WHY?  Why steamed   BORING way   Come on!  Then another salad bar sure why different area prepared salads   Caesar pretty good   Grapefruit kale pine nut salad interesting good   best thing poke which never seen buffet before  Why sushi over Asian food???? sure but really place  Here next sushi find cheese good assortment no meats   Oh then breads other side room   Weird arrangements   Desserts nothing all wow about   Puddings tarts cookies OOOOHHHH soft serve ice cream direct Golden Corral   No gelato no strawberries no creme brulee no tira misu   Where good stuff everyone wow about?  No alcohol included   Wine $14 more per glass   We impressed would recommend buffet all  For less $$ far better food M resort kicks buffet's A$$  <EOR> I came mid April friends extremely impressed both food well service     I two challenges coming into  I am picky eater given bread sweets Lent  worried having enough options since usually don't care buffets but figured if mimosa all times everything would okay     This ended being favorite buffet all time   Laura server AWESOME   She very friendly made sure glasses always topped off   She filled glass many times started suspect she trying take advantage me   Some highlights pesto mashed potatoes pineapple fried rice   many other things can't think moment also yummy   couldn't waffles but boyfriend friends loved them   think desserts mixed bag speaking group   There's always soft serve if all else fails   I agree everyone said MUCH BETTER Wynn   Wynn very overrated overpriced   surprised buffet cheap is   would gladly paid more   Will DEFINITELY return next visit Vegas  <EOR> I truly enjoyed food place price good too  $27 brunch  line long around noon lunch  think most ppl Vegas doing 24hour buffet pass  unlimited champagne extra $5   They good variety selections types foods sushi sashimi pasta american food different meats  love shrimp cocktails large sauce zestfully satisfying   wish crab legs lunch though  desserts good but Paris's better   I left place happy full wanting more shrimp cocktails <EOR> I came reading all reviews  sister friend wanted try it  gave shot must say wont back  wasn't expected  Food okay nothing great  guess seafood lover  pastas weren't good pizzas lame  only good thing delicious chocolate strawberry! <EOR> 47 99$ per person  Kinda expensive buffet  food okay but worth 47 99$  desert options probably best part  amazing! Probably won't back buffet  <EOR> I would suggest management undercover experience buffet    need trane personell more polite serve better smile! Food mediocre best why? Why bad service? chefs serve meat products would them work me    bad mood    look if favor doing does end!! Choice sushi better take out! Meats well eat them tell think!anyways done that!! Sorry    Enjoy <EOR> 5 stars definitely worth buffet  kinda those buffet where should dress bit since many people would feel place when they're wearing t shirt athletic shorts least should wear button down collared shirt  off bus bellagio walked buffet  wait see why many people came  hour waiting line seated  food tons variety stuffed face paella sashimi crab legs roast lamb  desserts AMAZING  bread pudding raspberry tart banana foster rest desserts good mention very pretty looking  couldn't eat another bite could see why dinner price over 30 bucks person  Come over dinner won't regret it  If you're lazy walk over then just take double decker bus since bellagio central area strip  <EOR> NO NO NO NO NO distended stomach screaming ever since buffet tonight  greedy piggy bastards quantity over quality but stuff your face this?  I agree when comes buffets nicer quality most but still don't appeal  Personally I'd rather nice good quality meal decent size maybe even leftovers  As vegetarian options? Forget it! rice risotto many other items would expect safe chicken stock them  thinking could vegetables side dishes but options very limited  2nd star chef showed could eat even though he wouldn't listen when said seafood vegetarian  After meal decided never buffet again  5 hours since ate still hurting! <EOR> Went 7 19 16    rushed told 30 minutes eat why bother letting people in!!!   the food nasty   fish dry bland  gross  I admit roast beef good nice rare    the crab legs tooth pics worst part staff started cleaning night while eating   WARNING   DO EAT HERE   for $78 plus tip somewhere else     seriously <EOR> Every time come Vegas Bellagio Buffet least once breakfast brunch  food itself isn't amazing giving 5 stars but there's just much variety everything tastes good  huge selection desserts best part love Nutella banana French toast  <EOR> Went seeing program travel channel friends recommendation   DISAPPointed   $30 person selection poor   Nothing stands great buffet  Line 30 minute long   sure buzz about   Would dinner again  <EOR> Great Buffet  Lamb superb  Crab pre cracked  Service quick  Food fresh always reloading Asian food eh    Rio's better it other pretty good  come back <EOR> Still best dinner buffet strip  Start king crab shrimp cocktails  Then move specialty meats   Everything sings quality   especially hand made desserts  <EOR> This better solid buffets Vegas  back second time breakfast past weekend  waitress amazing improvement over last making sure always champagne water joking around she just very sweet    The buffet seemed less items last time there  arrived around 7AM many things missing such sushi hand rolls prime rib etc  put thew food leaving few hours later but if paid same price those came later morning shouldn't same food too? But loved shrimp omelet chicken biryani all other items  <EOR> Before read 5 STARS because comparing against ALL other buffets especially ones Vegas   onto BRIEF SUMMARY! Buffets usually quantity quality but Bellagio gives great quality food whole lot it Smaller Rio but better quality Great service Wasted food Pig Farm Quality Deserts  Every time Vegas officially 3 times last 6 months hit Bellagio Buffet  Bottom line  Yes should Rio because world's biggest buffet but when you're done poo ing your brains you'll want spend additional 5 bucks Bellagio   VEGAS = LINES  if you're gonna cry waiting line club really great restaurant then don't Vegas  going amusement park during some busy holiday weekend crying wait line ride  RIDICULOUS  Suck wait   longer wait MORE food you'll probbaly eat  HAHA  So waited 10 15 minutes line eat dinner Friday Night around 7 8pm  Normal wait time Vegas without reservations least hour  little bit pricey but again worth it  Yeah 34 99 basically pay $40 a person   In general Bellagio NICE Casino buffet nice decor  soon sat down greeted put drink orders in  then headed towards buffet!  If haven't Bellagio Buffet yet sure around ONCE look everything offer  stuff right side isn't always same stuff left side wanna plan all want eat lol  thing Bellagio unless you're absolutely stuck something particular could probably eat whole bunch different meals setting haha   My first stop always salad bar  freshly prepared salads choose then built it yourself  love field greens always fresh well all other ingredients  They've plenty salad dressings toppings    On stuff everyone wants but rarely matters me  Seafood! There's much food general basically ignore all crab legs other seafood  sushi available looks ok  think back December wasn't anything brag about    Bellagio seems specialize giving different gourmet type foods  especially loved Kobe Beef Top Sirloin Beef Wellington Roasted Turkey Ostrich  Although never ate Ostrich thought cool it! also roasted Quail  Didn't try but hey if you're adventurous you!  Bellagio also all staple foods regular buffets have  Super creamy fluffy mashed potatoes pesto version fresh artisan bread Asian cuisine pastas carved meats   Deserts where think Bellagio sets itself Rio  Rio lot selection does Bellagio  But Bellagio's cheesecake legitimate  think plain cheesecake fruit topping equivalent cheesecake factory  cheesecake itself very rich smooth  other deserts well  ate few different things but usually you're full even eat desert depending are   All all Bellagio best buffet Las Vegas  prefer over any other buffet service great  constantly filled drink took away dishes offered advice food  sure there's people may disagree but ehh they're cool me! haha   Go Bellagio eat buffet  Don't waste your money cheap buffet  gonna keep toilet  quality quantity here! <EOR> This place best  shrimp large no veins  Rio   king crab precut  Very easy eat  Prime rib great  Worth every $  Best buffet $32  back  <EOR> Just it! never seen many QUALITY options buffet life  sushi particular melt your mouth amazing  2 kinds poke! big desert person but save room! pastries looked good true  Its cheap any means but its par would spend any decent establishment Vegas   Pros High quality ingredients Variety Presentation Execution  Cons I felt needed wheelchair when done! <EOR> This place really sucked  pretty disappointed  Everything really dry over cooked no flavor all  only things ok chicken tortilla soup crem brûlée roasted carrots duck   it  price wait thumbs down  <EOR> We stayed Bellagio first time decided try buffet  pleasantly surprised   well above expectations great price  big fans buffet st Caesar's Palace but definitely give them run  Especially half price  <EOR> I always sure come Sunday brunch buffet when Vegas   offer many choices really hard decide eat   yummiest omelettes lots different ingredients choose including crab shrimp mMM       also shrimps really fresh huge well   crab legs already halved all eating them super easy   sushi pretty good well mean spicy tuna hand roll   quality food definitely beats all other buffets including Wynn buffet    Best part Bellagio buffet?  desserts course!  offer many decadent treats   there's bound something everyone Only bad part wait usually 1 5 hours but worth when you're finally surrounded all yummy foods offer   Definitely recommended! <EOR> All Hot Food Fairly Cold Table Otherwise Wide Variety I actually shocked hope did catch them just bad night  But nice looking prime rib mashed potatoes gravy just cold lame time sat down  say FAST LANE MLife holders AWESOME!!  But NO WAY would wait line ever Bellagio Buffet even if its FREE!!! Aria best buffet second only Wynn Mirage felt third best totally most gracious staff ever Mirage Buffet Every service person thanked business way smile so  case Bellagio if could just food HOT HOT would quite awesome   It only real problem saw perhaps just bad night apologize if case  ALL staff depend tourism good reviews  am careful say give real thought   https www tripadvisor com ShowUserReviews g45963 d422633 r530406791 The_Buffet_at_Bellagio Las_Vegas_Nevada html# <EOR> My experience very exciting but think little hand end stay here   Let just sum experience couple bullet points  1   Unlimitted mimosas 2  Waiter kept stock oj cranberry mixers while keeping champagne glasses full 3  Awesome omelet station 4  Large variety seafood 5  1 stall 2 urinals huge buffet    come on  Great way start your day Vegas brunch buffet favorite buffets ever to  <EOR> After paying walking threw buffet Bellagio all honesty ask staff member only buffet casino?? seriously thought some kind express version vaunted Bellagio Buffet   No sir it  contemplated leaving before even being seated asking refund but long line desk estimated cost time aggravation would greatly exceed admission price pressed on   Food offered ok cheap buffet standards but absolutely NOTHING special mean NOTHING  local Indian Casino Mohegan Sun near house Connecticut better buffet buffet Aria puts shame   Service awful staff friendly would expect registry motor vehicles office   Having read seen television quite big deal being made Bellagio Buffet can't recall ever being let down actiual dining experience comparing hype reality    I would back ever again even if meal free       <EOR> 5 buffets 36 hours    Vegas baby! Yeah!  4 5 lunch friend mine's dime   only way baby! Kidding     I just Paris buffet morning wasn't feeling hungry    really only ate three cheese ravioli  beef ravioli  tried some sushi California rolls gelato some cheesecake  only tri tip roast time didnt any red meat other beef ravioli   By beef ravioli really mean tortellini think   The server great very attentive pro active    Anyway good food good dessert good service  <EOR> I checked Buffet Bellagio Friday night  group looking right combination good buffet reasonable price  Buffet Bellagio based few online reviews read seemed meet those requirements Then walked in   First all charged $47 holiday rate because Columbus Day weekend  Columbus Day horrible holiday many historical reasons view but aside Friday  Columbus Day following Monday  Why would gouge customers $47 three days before random holiday?   Anyway wasn't good start experience  But want review place irrespective those shenanigans provide unbiased assessment   The food decent diverse  couple meat stations which serving prime rib corned beef another which serving goat shanks lamb chops  corned beef really flavorable lamb shanks  Those tried other options similar assessment   They few seafood stations which shrimp cocktails another several different types crab legs sushi station  crab legs sliced half vertically making easy eat  shrimp okay  sushi underwhelming especially sashimi     They pizza station which pretty good  few different kinds thin crust pizza appreciated that   Everything else most part pretty meh buffet nothing better you'd your average buffet other parts country    The thing offer specific praise dessert section  several different options cheesecakes brownies flan cookies creme brulee ice cream etc  trying bite few different options say all good except flan   Ultimately when factoring even regular non holiday rate I'd say isn't worth price when several better dining options nearby  definitely worth $47  Ridiculous  <EOR> I'd actually 3 5 stars if could but once am glad can't because wouldn't fair business   Here's thing girlfriend just finished rock n roll half marathon wanted eat   original plans grab 1 buffet weekend going one   Unfortunately wanted closing time race ended we planning going couple days prior but circumstances required skip it    Therefore trying decide between Bacchanal Buffet Caesars one   chose because although loved Caesars when last Vegas wanted try new one   Therefore came here   However realized paid before we didn't remember going 2 buffets last trip therefore should gone Caesars which preferred but late   Therefore didn't enjoy much would because disappointed decision come first place   As said  really fair though because Bellagio really good buffet   good Caesars?  Nope but plenty options all high quality very tasty   funny but actually starving long distance run   thought would but until your muscles relax everything tight can't eat much   Therefore wasn't able eat much wanted to   Nevertheless did enjoy plate full carved turkey rotisserie chicken carved ham kobe beef some potatoes   Also another plate some Asian food crab legs finally 2 bowls won ton soup which probably best item sooooooooooo deliciously salty!    If complain something lets face if know then know complain lot things would dessert   Firstly no cookies?  trays cookies?  Secondly lot desserts just disappointing   No apple pie cobbler only 1 2 cheesecake options no brownies   did mini key lime pies also ice cream but 35 degrees screw that   Also buffet Caesars serves things little tapas plates   rather heaping loads food won't finish onto your plate Caesar's controls portions   always grab more back more but if wager would say Caesar's system wastes less food   If give two buffets eat much want point bursting making disgusting mess both both serve high quality delicious food but wastes less then one   Also if am being honest Caesar's better options too   But just because Caesar's better doesn't mean Bellagio bad   Heck both   Apparently did but ate much broke memory  <EOR> Hands down best buffet Vegas     Granted only two while Vegas But compared Wicked Spoon Cosmo hands down best Buffet  Give try lose   but if your disappointed don't come crying me  <EOR> Love buffet!  Caviar Crab legs Creme Brulee oh my!  quality food top notch   all other buffets vegas keep coming back one    Sry Bacchanal <EOR> Like many Vegas buffets huge selection but bellagio's food quality average borderline bad   Pros their weekday dinner buffet ends 10 instead 9pm wicked spoon good diverse dessert selection they snow king crabs delicious their sashimi mix scrumptious had both salmon tuna Cons their service little slow  look waiter water drinks came 8 40pm still 20min wait dinner buffet left 1 hr I excited see macarons but just   bad  middle part just jam   what  they lot food but only two dishes really enjoyed  There's something off food quality here  dinner weekdays $34 but still don't think worth price   Pass  better buffets restaurants Vegas eg burgr Gordon Ramsey <EOR> I took friend town  Simply put terrible  1 5 hour wait  unclean stations  Frozen crab legs turned melted butter back solid  Sushi fresh  buffet thrown towel simply can't compete new resorts  worth 9 99 let alone 29 95 even if free its worth wait  Stay away place  <EOR> I think rating true is    4 5  happened come weekend Champagne Brunch  everyone suggested  Come 3 3 30 before dinner rolls pay brunch price no champagne 24 bucks champagne 28 29 bucks  i forget   food delicious things I'd probably never tried life  Buffalo decent but little dry side  Prime rib delicious well lamb  Dessert yum yum creme brulee that bruleed front you   But staff attentive pretty good taking your dishes away once completed  I'd come back again! <EOR> amazing   best buffet ever had   so happy when left   i tried many new wonderful things   defiantly coming back   they very good variety and great service   really good options   and really cool dessert set up  <EOR> We night dancing drinking definitely must  heard great reviews place plus Bellagio!

Grrrr  The selection fairly standard  highlights included pesto mashed potatoes thin pizza selection which includes delicious pesto shrimp  fiancee enjoyed prime ribs lot but seafood selection quality unimpressive  desserts fairly good though prefer gelato stations Bacchanal Wicked Spoon    The ambience decor fairly casual seating area feel diner instead Bellagio  <EOR> We decided try Buffet memories past visits but even two for one price head line perk disappointed  quality once was! cold shrimp watery tasteless while crab legs size pencils  caviar dotted dry small but thick excuses blini which totally overwhelm taste caviar  best entrée roast beef best overall dessert line which did offer several very tasty items  None justified current high price buffet  shame see become once best buffet strip  <EOR> I agree many yelp high end buffet even tell presentation items many items given single serve size plates bowls etc   lunch $19 dinner $27   late breakfast didn't wait line  <EOR> El peor buffet de mi vida las patas de cangrejo súper chicas y la comida y variedad no buena ni el servicio sirve!!!

Linger long enough late lunch first dibs dinner items   Tables spaced apart appropriately  hard enjoy dining if someone always squeezing way knocking your arms elbows    Staff friendly  waiter came many times waters orange juices  nice pleasant each every time  He seemed relaxed if he working leisurely but still managed attend everyone    Also Annabelle super helpful sister family seated but running little late  waited line but then asked if could skip ahead pay join family  Once proved family actually inside my sister show table husband baby! Lol maybe people desperate enough lie jump line?? she helped pay saved least 30 45 minutes! Really appreciated she didn't say yes  <EOR> Pricey but par some better buffets Vegas   It part Buffet Buffet program paid $50 person because Labor Day special dinner starting 3 p m  Friday because celebrating birthday   Some notables Good selection little bit everything  Seafood choices consisted Alaska regular crabs shrimp smoked salmon sushi caviar Ikura American caviar seaweed salad mussel salad calamari salad  Carvery choices included rack lamb Asian pork belly beef Wellington  Asian foods included Broccoli Beef Beef Panang chicken shiu mai  Extensive dessert section  Some good items  Alaska king crab legs split served cold though servers steam upon request  the mussels seafoods free grit only very slightly over cooked compared other buffets  Beef Wellington rack lamb just right  only complaint saltiness mushroom filling Beef Wellington  Extensive salad selection including mussel salad  Competent unobtrusive service servers cranberry juice ice cream  Some hot items  Veal osso bucco inconsistent quality  one perfectly tender piece but mine overcooked leathery  Sushi inconsistent sushi much vinegar mine just right  Pork belly salty due oversmoking? Is worth $50 person?  Only if eat enough worth your while   Lunch definitely more palatable! <EOR> Mediocre service crowded [well guess shouldn't surprise] poorly laid out food stations cold interesting food fairly limited selection etc   The waitstaff did fine job omelette station OK but everything else worth time nor buffet experience  interested back  <EOR> I 5 plates food think enough rounds judge place     Now first off where hell pasta station?  remember being pasta station before   Maybe another place   Disappointing   The seafood really good  prime rib crab duck quail crab   Fresh made spicy tuna rolls proper   I recommend place but expecting more   particular lamb properly marinated  <EOR> I honestly expected buffet LOT better  Maybe just high expectations buffet paid 45 bucks    think dinner price but 4 30pm   We seated rather quickly because kinda early dinner time   There nothing special food  very mediocre  Sushi mediocre it didn't taste fresh hoped   Dessert good  looks really good pretty though  money's worth tried bite every single dessert had  haha yes taste buds little confused there  Hands down creme brulee best! only worth trying opinion Cheesecake alright but said nothing special   A random note ostrich there   I'm pescetarian don't eat stuff but friends all tried spit chase down soda  I guess try if want  Maybe acquired taste but just slight warning  it smells looks pretty gross   The only reason didn't give 2 stars instead 3 because waiter super friendly  He kept coming back take away plates refill drinks   All all try different buffet  hear Mirage better but never actually tried it  Next time will   You pass Bellagio Buffet  Save your money  <EOR> The variety buffet better any strip  talking trays food but actual good tasting quality food  find smaller let's say Ceasars even Rip but worth it  crab legs prime rib caviar! only thing didn't prefer wait hostesses  wait 45 minutes when 5 6 hostesses cranky b <EOR> Staying VIP penthouse lucky cut all way front line VIP access  overheard wait time Sunday morning hour long 0   Inside hugeee variety food options  ranged breakfast lunch options dinner desserts  wanted sure enjoyed much fit tummy since first time buffet  wasn't much fanatic breakfast options   Breakfast French toast least favorite lacked flavor  Pancakes  Breakfast potatoes  Cereal  Omelette      Lunch Dinner Ravioli ****AMAZING**** Chicken wings  Veggie soup  Mashed potato w gravy least favorite   Dessert Tiny fun size pumpkin pie slice  Fruit  Flan least favorite    Again those portions chose eat Keep mind plenty more options   I payed $40 entry drinks along condiments ketchup drinks milk   etc brought upon request  Gratuity included $40  Also minor bother only 3 restroom stalls found myself waiting line few times when could spent time eating some more delicious cheese Ravioli !! Regarding service very attentive empty plates weren't stacked long  Servers constantly cleaning removing plates way    I would eat again try remaining full tummy couldn't take anymore  Overall food satisfying dear Ravioli hope taste again  <EOR> Came Sunday brunch holy cow!  line huge!  must least 2 hour wait   Luckily cut line pass only wait 15 minutes     The hazelnut banana french toast delicious!  cheese blintzes coffee eggs benedict weren't great   The good thing buffet though much food find something like   It's bit pricey but worth money since much choose from   sure would wait huge line though??? <EOR> Peeled jumbo shrimp cocktail    mmmmmmmmm  I'll come if afford come another buffet hit Bachanal Ceasar's Palace stomach wise wallet wise   But place isn't bad plan B buffets   But if you're staying here   well when Rome   eat buffet   Very good variety food here   Price typical premier high end buffet days  <EOR> I heard great Bellagio buffet many times   Well least much food course try it   We spent $35 dinner around your typical dinner time Saturday night   wait pretty short 15 20 min     Well friends right TON food   death stomach   kid sat over 2 hours eating eating eating   Long bf stopped still going hey $35 worth food! I really liked spicy tuna hand rolls!!!  kobe beef okay some other meats better   soups pastas good too   liked best desserts!!!!!!!!!  many all looked pretty!  took giant bite least 8 different ones   chocolate covered strawberries weren't good looked   don't think strawberries fresh   in fact some them tasted starting bad = Also crab legs salty kind tasted nothing   biggest dissapointment beause love crabs!  Overall food generally good fun 4 stars is! <EOR> I think buffets Spice Market Buffet Aladdin awesome  buffet all right    large selection diverse range foods  best part shrimp crab cocktail sauce  Stick that  rest things standard buffet fare  Defintely stay away 'pasta bar' where choose red white sauce pasta vegetables heat you  good all    But really just eat crab shimp cocktail sauce  <EOR> i couple months back very disappointed  paid much dinner definitley worth all  sick felt food poison   called spoke server request refund since no more 30 min   She said she would them refund manager  then waited  she said if would take complimentary come back another time left nothing she said call because manager available   did file report til day still no refund   <EOR> Dropped $300 Seahawks needed drown sorrows something  3pounds King Crab did trick washed down some Chicken Wellington   Overall I'd say easily best buffet Vegas  $37 ain't cheap but par most  <EOR> best buffet eaten at!  everything good   bit pricey but worth it   arrive little early long line form   heard wynn very good buffet too   hope try next time vegas  <EOR> I came over summer husband while Vegas  heard lot great things buffet great its hayday 1990s   Vip voucher sure where it chance all way front line even buy one one free voucher  However impressed food here  know try hard but feel could better prices charged $50 + dinner   If BOGO coupon would give less 4 stars  <EOR> Never life did picture myself hitting buffet Vegas  say  always seemed gimmicky guess  crashed night  room pimp exceeded expectation  driving all freaking day dire need something delicious  No reservations no snacks screw eating shit mini bar  buddy mosey down  Buffet while gawking numerous hot females walking around   Back food  Everything great first foremost  sushi just okay bland selection rolls pretty eh  Anyway quality sushi  Prime Rib really juicy satisfied craving blood  king crab legs really good shrimp mighty tasty  spinach stuffed pasta things great smothered creamy white sauce  Pesto mashed potatoes duck turkey spareribs noodles dim sum everything really good quality food overall pretty good  left place feeling really content blob  service great drinks pretty good  Nice buffet    good enough wipe buffet grudge away time being  <EOR> Bellagio itself  definitely most beautiful hotels Las Vegas Strip  But unfortunately can't say much buffet since alot compare Las Vegas   eaten almost every buffet Las Vegas worth trying best reviews  recommendations etc  Bellagio buffet Good Great Best but Terribly Bad   If area   worth trying but if there's time your hands options available would seek elsewhere  I stayed Bellagio 2 nights ate buffet twice   First experience Dinner  your typical meat carving stations salad bar variety international selections etc dessert bar  always seafood since price typically priced high $40s per person money's worth probably every other person hits buffet lol  The seafood selection very slim but did crab legs shrimp cocktail few salads seafood them well sushi station poke   The desserts amazing  doesn't take much impress since sweet tooth   Overall concern ate breakfast next morning buffet saw many same items served night before   think definitely change up  Overall place definitely worth try but always stick Wicked Spoon Cosmopolitan if option  <EOR> I don't think gone Vegas without doing Sat Sun Bellagio Brunch Buffet   thing down science   Some people know count cards well know bring down house attacking buffet   let lay wisdom you     OK first off If want take Vegas need follow some simple buffet rules   1  No salad   don't care good dressing fresh looks if sounds good you   NO NO NO  splitting 10's   Someone fills precious trips buffet salad picking buffet chips changing tables   2  No Rolls bread   good everything freshly baked but takes way much space trap want fall into   Kind taking insurance when dealer Ace showing   3   No sushi other maybe spicy tuna hand roll   aren't slicing fresh sashimi here   all california rolls lots rice little fish   going better sushi elsewhere don't fill all rice   OK now some basic strategy down teach fool proof system   Course 1 Breakfast   omelette station left them fire you   Take all your options   If don't want standard fillings notice crab meat shrimp   also spinach basil cilantro some extra seasoning   want think outside box some smoked salmon bring them throw into omelette   Ok your omelette grab eggs benedict which always perfect runny yolk center some sausage bacon if wish   now here's why said Omelette station left right   Next sausage small bowl marked Beef Tenderloin   don't right think few people notice which plan   now nicely seasoned slices filet mignon put some more scrambled eggs top steak eggs   call course eggs 3 ways   Omelette Scrambled Benedict   Please notice avoided all french toast waffles pancakes   sure good but you'll ruin your other courses   Course 2 Cold Smoked Fish   Ok here's real tough one   can't bagel course takes way much room violates rule 2   grab lots smoked salmon smoked trout maybe herring if slices tomato red onion   Use slice tomato base construct open face sandwiches smoked fish using cream cheese hold all together fork   Right center buffet large chilled cocktail shrimp try use shrimp barrier between cocktail sauce smoked fish   Although little known fact cocktail sauce cream cheese tastes good together   Course 3 Meat   carving station them slice some Prime Rib roasted lamb   sure don't skimp your slices speak if small   odds making back again small sometimes line   know this   your right another small carving station Turkey Pork Belly   sure some cranberry sauce hold piece turkey pork belly together fork   some potatoes your meat mashed best way go   mashing they've done some hard chewing work you   smearing some each bite meat down smoothly   If want flavor overload pesto mashed   Course 4 Odds Ends   now walking around buffet few times you've seen some other things catch your eye   Now's time just throw whatever else want try your plate   Roasted chicken saffron rice BBQ glazed Salmon Creamy Pasta chicken sun dried tomatoes few Lo Mein Chinese dishes couple slices pizza   Now pizza don't afraid take only few bites slice then eat rest toppings aren't violating rule 2   pizza pretty good usually 5 6 choose from   Keep look shrimp pesto one   Course 4 5 Back Plan   Sometimes Odds Ends aren't happening   People don't pay much attention them sometimes sit long little dried out   Don't affraid throw towel then double down something really liked earlier   Sure starving people world may feel guilty throwing whole plate food away barely touched but aren't going plate food anyway     Course 5 Dessert   Sample Everything Finish Nothing!  When done table looks same dessert station just 1 bite missing   Don't feel bad remember happened last person told starving people Let Them Eat Cake <EOR> Staying Bellagio place husband  Customer service horrible except Mr Carlo behind crab legs craw fish area  quality food sub par hotel  crab legs cold watered down  Plain gross!!! <EOR> Unfortunately Bellagio Buffet no longer great just good ok now   standards gone gone bit downhill!  don't know if just day if always now   used point visit Bellagio Buffet each time came Vegas  But 10 years ago  least several years since Bellagio Buffet  impressed  day holiday time  charged holiday prices even though holiday passed  thought since charging more may some special items  wrong! Brunch  did Crab Legs but served Cold Cocktail Sauce rather warm Drawn Butter  Everything else just average remember Sushi actually being kind bad  remember years ago having exotic items Bellagio BBQ Wild Boar Ribs really good Pasta dishes  But time all just standard Buffet fare  None which particularly good  Desserts looked good but surprisingly nothing really tasted great  agreed Aria even Mirage better Buffets! If staying sure fine Breakfast Lunch  But don't special trip anymore!! bad because used best! Now just every other buffet  <EOR> Wow did lot folks upset bypassing line  We're huge party over 100 people skirting line getting BEST service ever   put into seating area reserved just Given drinks including beer sangria margaritas    let loose buffet    It appears crab legs everyone's favorite item eating them going style! lamb tasted roast beef prime rib tough but otherwise everything tasted delicious especially dessert! creme brulee amazing  <EOR> Date November 20 2009 Good Variety all different types food try well deserts  Bad $30 per person food average   Summary If want try wide range dishes different parts earth without going many resurants work you  If want specific type dinner beyond average look somewhere else specializes it  <EOR> I remember going couple years back being BLOWN AWAY food here  We're talking transcendent metaphysical God spake the cloudtops kind experience  I just brunch last weekend more Presbyterian service  Nice but heavens didn't exactly open up  <EOR> I cant say much other purw amazement! place EVERYTHING best part all tasted if made home thats saying lot since classically trained chef! Much love all kitchen workers here    GREAT job! server awesome too <EOR> Ahi tuna Mac n cheese Sushi Pasta  That's remember having here   Bellagio's buffet best around town   Planet Hollywood Wynn don't compare   really set food selection offer   But beware try before peak times 12 1pm usually long wait dinner time 7 8   end waiting hour   guess could try preferred guest throwing down couple G's black jack table   smart come earlier time avoid wait  <EOR> Best Buffet! Such large selection! Only downside LINE place  But if plan ahead line hour before want eating wont regret it! <EOR> I read many reviews wondering if yelpers inhaling something when wrote reviews perhaps college students very young kobe beef?? all beef offerings very tough chew unique Bellagio general dumbing down all buffets save money Vegas almost all cruise ships  tried all buffets strip very disappointed good old days gone Bellagio Wynn buffets  used best still remember fondly amazing dining experience Parisian brother he said Bellagio feast such culinary delight experience remember  might Bellagio lake Como Italy old experience  just come back Cinque terre know good pasta should taste like  The briskets tritips still mooing bite harder shoe leather variety pastas but did see simple spaghetti meat balls where they? why olives almost every dish? everybody liked olives hated them immediately excluded lot dishes all weird herbs added everything too  old country herbs but everything especially strong herb such rosemary believe dill sage added mayonaise made no sense never mayonnaise mixed herbs does cold cuts!!! where chefs Bellagio coming doing things norm elsewhere? The BBQ tasted ok but tad sweet most dishes sweet chef must sweet tooth  shrimp cocktail fine BUT COCKTAIL SAUCE SWEET! killed shrimp king crab legs only sweet did enough if all horse radish tasted ketchup ketchup added sugar made zero sense me  lemon crushed still frozen no juice left extract need fresh lemon! king crab legs big enough more queen baby crab legs! The plain chow mein fine shrimp wonton soup delicious no wonder always back twice bowl   The soppresata also delicious but also made no sense why placed next sweet papaya instead mustard mayonnaise hunting mayo when found mayo mixed w dill! looking cornichons but none found  I did eat many sweets spent much time trying chew beef just exhausted wanted home  deserts pretty much tasteless just cruise ships now no longer real whip cream artificial stuffs coloring other subtitutes  If want real culinary experience guess would 5 stars Michelin restaurant most cruise ships the worst offender Royal Caribbean Vegas strip  <EOR> You can't Vegas buffet!!! came brunch   I'd say Bellagio best selections!   The prime rib juicy good  sushi sections serving none other spicy tuna hand roll  YUM!  However fan customer service front  cashier didn't even offer champagne brunch which $5 top brunch price  ushers front RUDE told back line pay gratuity if wanted sit close friends already eating  4 arrived half hour 2 another 4 us     wanted sit together but refused wanted back line just pay gratuity even thoug would given gratuity anyway!!! waitress really great tipped $20 just serving drinks  I'd say  MORE 18% tyring pay just sit together  instead letting sit together usher took friends OPPOSITE side just kids  ugh  wanted complain but just ignored them since girlfriends bachelorette party  <EOR> The sushi selection great here!!  poke delicious special rolls   part buffet plentiful crab equals 4 5 stars   Another good dish lobster mac n cheese   The rest buffet just mediocre   pastas taste bland   Everything overcooked sitting under heat lamps   turn over food very slow   desserts looked delicious but failed taste way   restaurant bit outdated felt eating cafeteria  <EOR> The Bellagio always favorite buffet world myself am huge buffet eater   Every time am Vegas am sure hit place    very happy every sing time until recent visits   decision keep breakfast food buffet throughout day instead adding usual lunch items place total waste   breakfast fair pair golden corral nothing special   Even though still serving mostly breakfast continue charge you   bad didn't even see things corn buffet except cold corn salads   guess time try Wynns new place 17 million dollar new buffet ceasers  <EOR> I defended Buffet @ Bellagio even when wife said only 3 5* Yelp dinner first night returning Vegas few years   time huge disappointment know other poor reviews certainly merits  prime rib chewy even knife couldn't cut through spicy cauliflower ok spice but mushy texture Kalbi just chunk fatty American BBQ Korean Kalbi clams tiny underwhelming crab legs 3rd grade best poke looked tasted worse could Safeway deli Honolulu Miso soup way salty certainly something Japanese would cry if fed them ice cream way more ice cream    could but idea   You your own now Bellagio buffet  I no longer defend you  <EOR> So if told could eat unlimited Parisian macarons would say?  Well know I'd want know where sign up!  stayed Bellagio reservation came two complimentary buffet trips   Since plane late transfer airport took forever against hard start time show opted use them first night already prepared food sounded win   Little did know entering into best buffet ever to   Being Seattle very familiar casino buffets including price $45 50 per person pretty average when saw price before turning using credit weren't shocked   shocked however quality price!

Yes  Yes is   Although wait may little lengthy even most patient patrons must say Buffat Bellagio did fair service  First foremost there's plenty choose from  Although seems seafood focus items such freshly carved meats sides taking well fairly decent array Italian dishes  Going back seafood however definitely par being buffet    Most places when seafood usually budget level offerings such cod maybe salmon catfish  here  Snow crab legs absolutely divine  probably wasn't plate entire restaurant didn't crab legs it  sushi tasted surprisingly clean fresh which again must say little odd buffet style cuisine!  Prime rib? Perfect  perfect medium rare didn't even need au jus enhance flavor  Very good stuff    My only complaint service tad rough  understand busy but something more 2 visits table refills beverages needs addressed   only thing  holding back giving Buffet Bellagio full 5 star rating  <EOR> This place GREAT!! food wonderful lots variety yes champagne flows Nile those into that  both enjoyed prime rib spicy tuna hand rolls blue cheese chicken tomato pasta most  really liked eggs Benedict smoked salmon well  Wife also said dessert good but didn't far  really set experience off did wait line  last Saturday afternoon around 1ish plus minus hour because forget exact time  no hungover drunk scoping line just happened run into bartender took wife straight in  later learn bring parties 2 sit bar came right time because he did feel walking all way back line  guess lot groups here  quick tip passed upon leaving through exit check bar if only 2 you  just may save 1 5 hour wait did us! Having said all great food great people no wait made great experience hence 5 stars  <EOR> Pretty tasty  brunch dinner both lot food offer  service good seated pretty quickly no matter long line is  Definitely better buffets check strip  <EOR> The ONLY reason even buffet because line pass VIP rep   sure enough regret having return buffet scene lack luster quality inconsistent food  The sushi menu disgusting   rice sushi rock hard COLD   only two choices   tuna salmon   Other maki rolls just blah  Only thing liked station spicy tuna hand roll actually made when order   only saving grace station   Other items usually skip   right prime rib  Was dripping bloody disgusting first time   Only took bite moved dish way   Second time around someone else dry   In end just fed myself shrimp crab legs it     suppose can't really wrong that   or you? o 0  I now remember why hate buffet much   especially Vegas buffets   mediocre foods outlandish prices   If wasnt line pass would've killed myself having wait line 1 1 2 hours dive into this   On BRIGHT note however did DAMN good hot coffee cheesecake  <EOR> Before considered Bellagio Buffet best buffet strip only last weekend excited standing line to experience best buffet strip until came face face reality  paid $40 00 per person worst buffet Las Vegas  disappointed  mad although its weekday dinner still $40 00 errr! I don't recommend Bellagio Buffet guaranteed disappointed! <EOR> Stayed Bellagio least 10 times last 6 years  Bellagio Buffet once 6 years ago just yesterday most recent stay  Nothing changed  Same mediocre tasting buffet food many options nothing creative terms food options creativity  Bland simple flavorless  Lots greasy pasta options fill customers  Cannot compare Baccanal Caesar's even Buffet Wynn  <EOR> Short wait Sunday morning brunch   Probably 10 minutes   Pay before enter   Nice selection food   Some decent vegetarian options   couple carving stations   Omelets sushi Asian fruits breads American Seafood desserts etc     All food ate pretty good didn't send back any plates full food   really hog trough eater but nice variety food choose from   would probably back unless someone really wanted go   matter probably back buffet Vegas anywhere else   Wait staff great!  desserts great! <EOR> I am obsessed buffet Bellagio  many different choices your head spin  difficult want indulge here! breakfast amazing meats breads fruit fish porridges much more difficult list!! During lunch fresh sushi steak salads soups all delicious try little everyone one  Yes more expensive but quality honestly worth get  are So many buffets Las Vegas but believe tops them all  <EOR> I visited second time past week much less impressed I'd first time around  almost embarrassed brought mom dinner    There decent selection items choose but nothing particularly outstanding  did enjoy crab legs you them hot! but other chicken noodle soup didn't really anything else    I definitely expected more place Bellagio especially since paid $50 head dine there! Service also lackluster quite unprofessional  way much gossiping liking  <EOR> Food Pretty blah general impression second time first lunch last time dinner   would coming back either  Meats all dry  Beef Wellington major letdown  Sushi selection non existent  Salmon tuna? pizza nothing bad say but rarely say anything bad pizza would blasphemy  Crab legs pre split however intensely salty  Shrimp cocktail probably best thing  Desserts good best creme brulee however quickness couldn't find anymore    Drink Soda  Numerous refills due salty crab legs   Service Quick clear away plates refill water soda     Ambiance Crowd Vegas style  Spacious tacky  Young people old gamblers families slice world  <EOR> Real Alaskan king crab legs caviar kobe beef flan creamer brûlée few    perfect dishes  Bellagio Buffet #1 Yes better Bucchanal Caesars <EOR> As many friend highly recommend buffet high expectation  think missed little bit but mostly part very nice buffet hit Vegas    We around 4pm avoid long wait  overwhelmed varieties items  tried different dish two bits    My favorite ones Spanish Paella Shellfish  Moisture rice tender shrimp shellfish   Shrimp pizza Yes  Pizza  am surprised wonder taste shrimp pizza   Ahi Poke fresh tuna perfect spicy taste   Miso soup mushroom   And Dessert! especially Tiramisu  think could next time just eat dessert    I impressed prime rib nor leg lamb  Snow crab legs king crab legs fine but nothing special  Swordfish grilled Salmon dry  <EOR> Worst buffet ever! All crabs literally frozen even steaming cold  wished never labor day  We'll nevet back  <EOR> Best buffet to   My boyfriend ended going dinner  convince much stay ridiculous line  waited 45 minutes  really wish would take reservations normal dinners I know there's special dinner reservation but fork over $100+ buffet two   long wait lack normal reservation took off star   Food itself great quality  better some non buffet restaurants around town  loved crabs pre opened all scoop them fork eat without messiness  definitely way much food body handle  food coma hours after  Dessert amazing  Consumed many probably gained 10 pounds dessert alone  serves expensive food choices where would pay heck lot more $40 per person good quality   Service wonderful  server amazing  personally tipped cash I saw people taking dishes such weren't tables attend didn't want waiter receive tip   drink glasses refilled constantly finished food dishes taken away promptly  <EOR> I came lunch little 11 line wasn't bad   took 15 minutes in     I'm into breakfast foods but course hour many people having breakfast brunch enjoy usual waffles scrambled eggs sausage bacon etc   People always omelette stations  more lunch food thought selection would little wider     They usual carved meats such turkey sirloin beef which both good overlooked dry   didn't lot salads appealed me   basic build your own salad section   cold cut meats some gourmet salads cheese but don't that  basic selection cooked vegetables carrots potatoes along creamed spinach which good   more helping mashed potatoes starch probably wouldn't gotten full   Seafood wise mainly cocktail shrimp   sushi selection very basic average ravioli pasta selection wasn't tasty enough finish   As desserts wide appetizing selection but could only manage mini pecan pie flan some peach raspberry sorbet   probably don't barely money's worth because can't more two rounds!  I'm sure dinner selection better but course paying higher price   Lunch good but wasn't wowed   <EOR> I eaten many times over years mainly because comped star rating dropped dropped   started fresh innovative buffet reasonable prices Las Vegas now just opposite   Gone all imaginative dishes such exotic fruits main courses grilled quail Beef Wellington Chinese ribs replaced rotisserie chicken poor quality roasts just nothing all   No more drink service now pour your own kind McDonald's   Everything cheapened point ridiculousness   once attentive engaging staff now most often simply sullen   least lines much shorter  wonder why   They might explain serve people eat   Wrong answer!  Bellagio middle road hotel buffet should Golden Corral certainly rather extreme prices charged here   back track buffet managers Bellagio!  In meantime try eating coffee shop  <EOR> It just didn't me   years big debate seemed between buffet Caesar's buffet Bellagio tops Vegas   getting chance try Bellagio buffet February 2016 attest fact Caesar's buffet better   Granted couple years since Caesar's but came away very positive memory experience   Bellagio buffet cramped food underwhelming   Yes does coveted pre split Alaskan king crab legs   But smallest ever seen   served cold steamed   variety meats including beef wellington kobe beef however meats simply did taste good   lamb chops exception   other bright spot caviar   end day seek other places eat when Vegas  <EOR> hmm   $20 lunch buffet on Monday   bad  definitely cheaper Wynn   I pretty much ransacked cocktail shrimp station must've eaten half supply when there  tried lamb duck turkey pretty much little bit everything  all decent enough   but nothing amazing  lamb mint jelly probably highlight meal along napoleon dessert   dessert favorite part meal! slightly disappointed didnt crab lobster but guess $20 wut expect  sushi california rolls   kind home  service aka person bringing drinks good    hmm   wut else   nothing else really say buffet here   think next time try buffet Paris  <EOR> The Buffet Bellagio breaths life into nothing else can   Thank introducing pesto mashed potatoes  <EOR> Came 2pm no line  Food decent but nothing very remarkable however  lacked savory tastiness looking for  probably expecting much seeing Bellagio looks really wonderful  say enjoyed gardens much more food   But good note liked some desserts tried  blueberry cheesecake chocolate mouse tasted nice texture good  also liked raspberry iced tea some reason   Anyway price $30 hmm cant tell yet if worth food wise  service good though server very pleasant friendly  Maybe dinner would better selection food  <EOR> Yum      That little 3 letter word sums up   1045am   breakfast buffet closes 11am   suggest earlier take full advantage beast offer   couldn't omelette line sizzler waiting crab legs but man looked good   Instead just normal buffet fare   3 different kinds potatoes sliced thinly cubed baked bacon crispy but still amazing taste multiple sausages waffles french toast pancakes chorizo etc   all amazing even though scrambled eggs bit runny I dislike runny eggs   lot     $16 includes tax say well worth it   If only hungrier or hungry waiting long?? would've done more $16 worth damage   Instead only probably did $13   Sad   Oh yea orange juice amazing   highly recommend it  <EOR> Meals always taste better when free   Especially buffet Bellagio!  friend played credit card roulette decide pays buffet other persons   Luckily cashier picked credit card      We came around lunch time wait minimal   paid seated within few minutes   Great!  Then gathered bunch food feasted   scrambled eggs pesto mashed potatoes pasta fried rice etc   Everything tasted great   seconds fairly quickly when should rested little while   started full although managed third plate regretted last     Moving desert ton selection   cheesecake bread pudding   tasted fantastic     Free buffet? Win! <EOR> The Buffet Bellagio quite attraction  good reason  best Vegas  would call tops but there  case anything good long wait  But lines move quickly turnover time seems reasonable   I tried breakfast buffet which good deal $15 95  lot choose here  include your typical bakery favorites muffins croissants alongside sweet dessert items fruit oatmeal cereals those lighter appetite    For those bigger lot choose here  your typical breakfast favorites sausages regular chorizo bacon eggs waffles pancakes  But also extra things omelet bar  even Chinese selection those preferring more ethnic cuisine  Also nice selection breakfast pizzas offered  thoroughly enjoyed each item tried here   If no rush would suggest hitting buffet little later say around 10 am  way able enjoy breakfast also try some things lunch menu!   I left completely full satisfied much skipped lunch altogether  Wonderful buffet  shame good buffets tried only found Vegas  Oh well better waistline  <EOR> Hella  Fuckin  Good   What more say?   Food god damn good  Maybe little trek took Tropicana Bellagio desert heat maybe lack breakfast night drinking before  buffet awesome  Pretzels gulf shrimp good variety foods nothing seemed dry cheap over cooked    I dont know else say but trust average 4 stars almost over 300 reviews  <EOR> This best 4 buffets tried the others Le Village Cravings Spice Market   both king snow crab legs which awesome  ribs prime rib delicious  whole variety other food those aren't into big ticket items too  clear dining room between lunch dinner catch dinner items lunch prices going late lunch if you're inclined  There's usually least short line but bad long don't during peak hours  <EOR> This 2nd time eating buffet   definitely splurge never 2 1 coupons which use other casino buffet's   able apply mLife credit which helped little   With last time 12 28 brunch best server!

Everything ate very good  All breakfast foods lunch items tasted fresh warm  meats offered lunch such steak ribs etc absolutely delicious cooked perfectly  very large dessert table could pick from  I two issues place  own drinks  being lazy but if paying 30 dollars person upscale buffet feel staff should getting refills me  Also fancy vibe hotel gives off honestly thought I'd more food options  found myself struggling fill plate find things wanted picky eater  tons food but tons same food little variety    Glad ate  Probably won't need come back  <EOR> Yummy!  Wish crablegs lunch better dessert selection but great value better tasting food Wicked Spoon  <EOR> Spending more then 2 days Vegas sure does fck your schedule   Breakfasts actually lunches   Naps during hottest part day 2PM 5? usually norm   Recovering power nap find yourself having dinner rather late   Friends found ourselves wrestling between Bellagio buffet Mirage buffet dinner   time made minds sauntered across street hotel watched round dancing water Frank Sinatra arrived buffet tail end dinner service   Something tells food would better if maybe hour two earlier   Not bad just some tasted awhile   nothing write home about   Nothing near 5 stars   staff looked bit drained   wanted order coffee end dinner but decided against frightened reaction we'd staff already begun fold napkins tomorrow's breakfast service   I only ate sushi because balls   stomach steel   Eat your own risk  <EOR> You would think Wow!

More meh side Roast Beef dry Regular sushi rolls just decent seaweed salad salty Desserts average nothing spectacular them although most them pretty Service far beverages such might take while during busy hours  One last note EARLY  If want eat 5 4  Line gets pretty busy  If want lunch try closer during opening time   Overall better buffets Vegas there  <EOR> I'm sure if really high expectations coming but slightly disappointed  Don't wrong meal good  just wasn't great  lot hype long lines here  also recommended friends  really wide selection food good price person eat lot  didn't think anything outstanding worthy major hype  Maybe caught place off night? just better meals Las Vegas thought buffet Cosmopolitan better  definitely wasn't bad though if no long line would come back  <EOR> Two words SEA BASS!  If eat nothing but Sea Bass did you'll only satisfy your palate but certainly your money's worth!!!  believe only serve during dinner though but worth wait!  know saying melts your mouth butter?  Sea Bass    The offerings Bellagio Buffet always solid   Upscale but overly pretentious   My biggest tip Skip your ordinary food such Orange Chicken higher end food   Bellagio Buffet your Orange Chicken fix Panda Express anytime! <EOR> next best thing Wynn  Only downsides fruit sweet crab legs just nasty  Loved everything else especially creme brulee  tip late lunch stay dinner  tip your waiter well also  <EOR> They amazing choices desserts! arrived around 11 30am waited 30 minutes  Due holiday paid 42 bucks per person which much more regular days 29 don't crab because very fishy smell  service appreciable refill your cup once below half it  <EOR> Went during dinner hours during Labor Day weekend prices higher usual  food ok nothing spectacular however did enjoy crab legs  Wish could eaten more  roast turkey also great  Those 2 favorite things  Everything else average  Definitely worth price <EOR> We last trip weren't impressed   back time found food better last time   great variety choices fresh fruits salads   seated quickly   would recommend buffet here  <EOR> I've Vegas twice each time Bellagio buffet  don't think secret creme de la creme world vegas buffets which only drawback  might secret optimize your food consumption while doing your thang buffet  heard various strategies  don't believe don't eat before strategy slow steady philosophy  also going start watching Hot Dog eating contest ESPN like did most recent visit psych myself excessive self gorging   The food ranges really good really bad depending get  don't know if any guidelines you're just gonna try bit everything  but don't fill carbs meats your money's worth  <EOR> I buffet Christmas Eve brunch pleasantly surprised offerings   The wait time minimal maybe 20 30 minutes since early atmosphere lively   Just most people say stock Kobe beef king crab legs definitely pretty good  All all pretty good buffet decent menu items lots variety  <EOR> Buffet #4 2016 Vegas trip   Wife pretty much buffeted time reached last dinner trip    Met bro sis in law buffet looking Christmas decorations conservatory   Bellagio always beautiful holiday set flowers model train set large decorated tree flowered polar bear etc    walking through conservatory taking obligatory selfies headed buffet stuff tummies   Well buffet all same items prior Casino buffets Snow Crab Legs Prime Rib Boiled Shrimp Salad Bar Dessert Bar etc    Thus mention unique items only    Salmon Pate Petit Four Salmon Poke Tuna Poke Beef Tartar Spicy Tuna Handroll Watermelon Watercress Salad Asian Pears etc     Funny thing    actually tried all those different items since fill Crab Legs Prime Rib etc  all other buffets   Recommend buffet unique items   Decor dated no natural lighting since no windows   Done buffets awhile     Don't watch diners plates piled high Snow Crab Legs     <EOR> I can't mad but used be  Used best buffet LV hands down  Last two years adequate  mad just disappointed didn't little more adventurous  wasn't bad dish but nothing bring back either  <EOR> What say Buffet Bellagio except WOW  service outstanding iced tea unparalleled food beyond amazing barely wait  family come every time we're Vegas    definitely back  <EOR> Walmart quality food  All fish over cooked dry tasteless  Prime rib chewy rubber  Sushi better sushi Walmart  Fried rice dry sushi rice cooked properly  Overall worst buffet ever to  would recommend anyone especially considering much pay high school cafeteria grade food  <EOR> Not worth price place gone down hill let quality drop big time  Don't spend your money specialty drinks cost $18 worst  better drinks downtown $3 <EOR> I really can't decide favorite buffet Bellagio Wynn  think Bellagio's food little bit better but Wynn upper hand decor department    This being said am growing tired buffets  casual cheap dining experience which good if did much shopping gambling wallet pain  But aside many amazing restaurants try if am feeling broke don't think return buffet unless friend drags me    However Bellagio buffet best food found any buffet ever life  if going buffet would say place so    The roast chicken German potato salad fresh made sushi highlights last trip  <EOR> We just finished weekend brunch  All say meh   knew wasn't going mind blowing but hoping would least half way decent   especially Superbowl Sunday  assortment pastries desserts pancakes waffles endless  However hardly any noteworthy hot savory food items speak of  scrambled eggs dry bland  prime rib dry extremely overcooked  mash potatoes whipped  chicken noodle soup no noodles it   just minced carrot  no cooked veggies premise besides some Chinese broccoli  could on  only thing enjoyed coffee blueberry cheesecake very friendly service  heading Cesar's Palace Bacchanal Buffet tonight extreme disappointment today  <EOR> Lemonade tastes bad   food ok nothing exceeds expectation  see O Show n thought would give try   wouldn't again  <EOR> Love buffet here   Ate ton crab legs cut half u already   Other no complaints  The line buffet super long any given day  is    Nuff Said  <EOR> I buffet twice most recent stay bellagio   say just good Wynn buffet eyes better hands down if Wynn's crab legs  call two buffets wash but prices little bit lower easier well   I liked prime rib lab especially ribs some other type marinated steak  Shrimp aplenty ceasar other types salad   The dessert section also very strong bread pudding carrot cake various types chocolate cake Flan favorite   cream puffs  All all much better expected  <EOR> I never tried buffet  came lunch buffet during weekdays  selections terrible food tasteless  guess buffet selection good only weekends holidays dinner  wish money back wicked spoon other buffet instead  <EOR> My friends came Friday evening long line moved quite quickly  gourmet weekend dinner wonderful!   My favorite selections savory porcini truffle ravioli sea bass  sashimi average quality smoked salmon great  swordfish Kobe beef however tough dry    Definitely pick buffet if love Alaskan king crab legs  Each huge crab leg conveniently precut half  Just grab plateful pluck juicy cold strips meat into your mouth  p   The dessert bar great variety  Creme brulee caramel flan cheesecake strawberry chocolate mousse chocolate cake tiramisu    Whatever floats your banana boat!   I wish bigger stomach  <EOR> Probably 3 5 stars but decided round because nice desserts made happy  epitome Las Vegas buffets offers pretty much offers any type quality cuisine your appetite possibly desire  well priced buffet given good food is   for buffet  Some items better others  personally enjoyed prime rib sea bass no surprise   Save room dessert  really fine selection pastries cakes  <EOR> I very hyped place  heard great things  Besides Bellagio great  say good but great  Food okay selection okay but must say expected more  <EOR> Come dinner   nom nom nom!!  came weekday line big   food great!  just everything could want!  prime rib great crab legs!  crab legs split easy eat!  Yum yum yum!!  would definitely come dinner again! <EOR> This disappointing! $50 person holiday quality tastes should better way better!  prices gone quality gone down   After hour wait line ready eat  food looks good appetizing but when put mouth just disappointing  hard? tough? tasted bland?   yes all above!  duck prime rib duck legs lamb king crab leg cocktail shrimps sushi everything else high end buffet has  Desserts average favorite cheesecake  I don't see huge difference items between regular dinner menu holiday gourmet dinner which ten dollars more then usual  <EOR> I  ended buffet because wanted Wicked Spoon over Cosmopolitan but didn't think I'd time since close closing   Buffet Bellagio open until 10 pm trekked over husband check out      The line extremely long but moved fast   costs $29 99 per person eat which wasn't bad considering beverages included well dessert      One draws never ending snow crab legs   into snow crab legs passed but other people piling plates ceiling those things      I through buffet line 3 times     Must try Mashed Potatoes Heirloom Tomato Salad Broccolini   Meh Kobe Beef Tenderloin didn't taste anything special extremely dry Prime Rib way bloody Gross Macaroni cheese pizza homemade sausages most desserts     The only good thing dessert buffet chocolate mousse waffle shell      Overall would probably give another buffet try before going back one    wasn't bad price selection but food just wasn't good everyone saying  <EOR> To start don't enjoy star reviews often but really can't sum place any better huge disappointment  girlfriend did lot research places eat such buffet rated the best  top line  start mentioned going 32 99 come place 42 per person not end world let's continue   roughly 5 parties people front us  Few families couples   stood didn't move line joke 50 minutes  Right front line tables two which vacant dirty previous parties roughly 25 minutes before someone said something  ALSO 9 10 groups people left while waited line   Again some things worth wait let's food   food very disappointing   Some food looked old pizza alone looked dominoes  crap legs very stringy cold  don't know but enjoy them freshly hot steamed butter which when asked butter told yea guess don't any  yourself favor head over Paris buffet Caesars Buffet  Paris bit cheaper Caesars however both very good  <EOR> With lines Disneyland ride even slow weekday Bellagio's buffet needs no endorsements  well very very well  While current $27 95 dinner price higher some still most expensive Wynn Rio Seafood Buffet more   Within deceptively large 600 seat series rooms Italian seaside motif Bellagio's more pleasant atmospheres buffet linen napkins heavy silverware  but also still Keno    Strong points Sushi bar two dedicated chefs making cut rolls sashimi hand rolls dumplings steak tartar seaweed salad two kinds poke ahi salmon more    Fish quality far above most other buffets   Salad bar very large range choices which according management changed often  including marinated tofu quinoa salad smoked salmon spinach frisee  they also salads tossed order   A large selection seafood most which good quality  bluenose sea bass 3 different ways  because sustainable it's tender Chilean but nice light fish   Also vol au vents order 3 4 different ways which aren't bad    Strong selection soups including nice red pepper bisque mushroom laden miso  Six kinds brick oven pizzas which actually good usually buffet pizza wretched very good properly made creamed spinach  They grill veal piccata marsala live    but didn't try it   Weak points Mediocre selection Italian pasta Authentic but small selection Chinese Paella underwhelming  Broad selection carved meats chicken wellington? but most aren't impressive  I think Buffalo sirloin doesn't really lend itself buffet service   BUT did PERFECT TURKEY not overly brined which probably know isn't easy   But course most people still pile crab legs which served two stations  Desserts underwhelming Wynn Cravings Studio B all better but little apple pie rolls nice     Weekend dinners price $35 but kobe beef rack lamb venison more variety     Here's secret tip If only two people management allows walk exit door seat yourself bar space allowing   bartender charge buffet  <EOR> We very impress all selection taste  currently sitting trying enjoy time here  would recommend if trying find good selection food  expected better price being near Bacchanal Buffet   server really nice doing rounds  <EOR> I impressed quality food all    overpriced $32 pp worth all  <EOR> We ate brunch Saturday afternoon few hours left   food options respectably broad mix old new vital when you've upgraded unlimited booze going sit spell   only minor complaint unfed craving lox but far outweighed rest  Even buffet basics impressive nicely crisped bacon solid omelette bar shockingly chafer eggs benedict all overcooked dry             food only part experience  If compiling list thankless hospitality jobs would say supplying high volume probably already drunk  crowds vegas tourists unlimited booze would near top    Yet server perfect role she topped off mimosas before could even notice glasses half empty gamely endured tipsy badinage  She even designed dessert plate birthday girl   fine dining caliber service all way far beyond any buffet experienced  <EOR> So just review place Vegas Buffet spree hand down place took #1 spot   Quality food endless options dessert selection die for   important thing flavor food party mouth     Flavor Flavor more Flavor!!  Great job Bellagio can't wait back worth every penny!!! <EOR> selection vast other buffets but some items really good brunch esp smoked salmon seaweed salad    also usually dont cheesecake but theirs nice light  <EOR> I looking forward buffet  wanted amazing buffet did research  between Caesars  opted because scored buy buffet  hoping some top sushi highlighted travel channel other forms media  did research said full assortment going available lunch  showed without issue VIP line   sat quickly began feast  sushi section all california rolls  Where all other amazing types sushi promised?! checked back several times only additional rolls added veggie roll  No salmon? No tuna? also tried flank steak which pretty good brisket ribs all pretty good  amazing anticipated  actually found pizza best part options tried  indulged shrimp few desserts  desserts decent but expected  left feeling hiding all amazing stuff ranted raved about  fair share buffets found no different would some less over top buffets off strip  Save your money different buffet pay less same quality  <EOR> FIVE stars! Can't wait day try place dinner because lunch buffet amazing! loaded breakfast food then bunch deliciously seasoned crab legs shrimp  Weird breakfast seafood combo know don't judge <EOR> Their Rosemary Prime Rib best ever had! Also comparatively great selection seafood if  your thing  <EOR> Everytime Vegas sure hit Buffet Bellagio  Quite wide selection good food  Highly recommended anyone trip Las Vegas! <EOR> Just good remember it! Granted crab legs previously frozen but buffet middle desert all    I stuffed face 3 pounds crab legs 6oz Kobe beef small portion some best beef stroganoff ever tasted entire rack lamb! Ended night small dessert sampler surprised able walk own!  Well worth $50 gourmet dinner weekends IMO  <EOR> This place gave stretch marks   Need say more? <EOR> My absolute favorite buffet Las Vegas  really variety food options two different types crab legs prime rib mac n' cheese there's something everyone  also love fact serve rack lamb adore lamb very much  heart all still buffet albeit expensive but better buffets spend money on  Service really consistent drinks refilled very quick pace  larger buffets Vegas really clean  Bonus points having bathrooms buffet   Overall isn't much more say hasn't said already  guess say if pick buffet come here!!! <EOR> I dinner hubby both stuffed couldn't move  variety buffet vast there's something everyone  around 5 00pm line already long  Luckily MLife member having dinner promos buy free  great thing front line if you're going guests  No waiting line seated five minutes  $34 99 both bad all   I surprised see many entrees offered  item did see King Crab  only Snow Crab which sufficed  came chilled but could ask heated up  just ate cold didn't problem it  also ate ton sushi poke  surprised see buffet  Everything ate fresh  fish firm translucent  made sure save room piece Peppercorn Crusted Prime Rib  ate Horseradish Cream Au Jus  tender juicy just phenomenal    My hubby doesn't eat red meat seafood  He loaded plate green salad pasta chicken turkey dishes  items would gone but whatever floats boat    Lastly desserts  ate six different items  main reason why couldn't move afterward  All desserts tasted point  best bunch Green Tea Mango Panna Cotta  wish could snuck some me    The service slacking  server came took drink orders  He brought drinks never seen again  Someone else cleared dirty plates  buffet pay tip before when you're done eating just leave  <EOR> We buffet 7 14 2018  several years back must say very disappointed quality selection food   hyped much family disappointed  Nothing stood excellent quality taste  sure if because almost transition breakfast lunch if buffet fallen behind standards due mass production great demand  Some desserts which offered available  People waiting some dishes refilled staff manning areas where less enthusiastic towards waiting dinners  Presentation food average  Taste below average  We coming back anytime soon which am very sad love hotel itself visiting all artwork shows  The wait staff very professional kept table clear dishes prompt  Just food quality better before when remembered previous visit  <EOR> We buffet several times past kind sad say gone downhill big time  week day dinner weird  your own drinks now place where crab legs no longer self serve  guy handing plates just few crab legs it  guess want keep coming back every few minutes more  last time buffet decent selection  time wasn't much variety nothing really jumped made say try that  gone two other buffets being next door past week blew buffet water  even fair compare anymore  amazing other good bellagio just blah  Reminded Louisiana casino buffet without steak  Just really sad  won't coming back when much better buffet own street another mlife casino place next door which place go  <EOR> On advice Vegas resident said buffet the best buffet Vegas wife came Saturday brunch buffet   being Bellagio expected pay hefty price No less $50 per person really delicious food   However surprise price only $37   moment should turned around ran many Vegas  restaurants run celebrity chefs   But against better judgement proceeded pay   greeted seated friendly staff but food just bad worse many chain restaurants throughout west coast   food ok worse   single item grand great   crab which supposed star show served cold cocktail sauce lemon    right    no butter!  Instead king crab some patrons rave served anorexic Dungeness crab leg looked pulled murky waters Mekong River   Additionally mussels horrible   took bite mouthful gravel   guess cooks Bellagio no time soak such high demand mediocre fair   Finally dessert ok may inclined eat more cheese ravioli if hadn't lost appetite mouthful gravel crunched through teeth  might spit enough fill little pothole Flamingo   No more buffets me   When pay $70+ meal tastes worse Chili's Barstow think  time call quits once glorious experience Vegas life     What happened Vegas didn't stay Vegas time around  followed home ceramic sculpture water it  <EOR> While can't say all buffets Vegas definitely favorite far   There's just something quality food stand price worth me   No other buffet Vegas compares far I haven't tried Wynn yet though    Last week while vacation most delicious experience yet   salad section amazing selection hot foods great specifically loved Italian section night   carving stations also really good   turkey lamb disappointed!  also thoroughly enjoyed dessert section   Can't wait back next time Vegas  <EOR> OK admit buffets     usually 2 3 when Vegas   Bellagio BEST found  Note tried top ones Paris Wynn Mirage all same prize   Which feel good bargain**   only breakfast lunch never done dinner   just white trash me   The range food Bellagio excellent quality top notch  serves far fastest most efficient    food stations very clean well organized   wait into buffets very reasonable      I would say only draw back don't change menu   October now just June same dishes     Bloody Mary excellent Ice Tea   If dessert person Paris buffet better desserts crepe station    ** Where omelet bacon sausage OJ coffee fruit other stuff $15 dollars even Denny's <EOR> And complain? Its third best buffet Vegas expect lot but never would thought selection HUGE!!! offer great selection salmon tartar Japanese food Pasta Seafood   hmm  ill rethink cold snowcarb but no king crab? Service okay decor bit outdated but buffet recommended! <EOR> A bit pricey but worth it   can't say anything bad food everything lunch buffet line good   Service excellent seated pretty quickly   Highlights The spicy tuna roll actually pretty close something sushi bar!  Smoked salmon right balance being being salty hint smoky flavor shrimp cocktail pretty big cocktail sauce sweet sour   Soft serve other desserts good overly sweet   Recommended sure! <EOR> Man wait buffet Saturday morning pretty long 45 minutes all empty stomachs night before!   The day before eaten Wynn buffet comparison test! Bellagio's interior decor far lacking compared  isn't fancy but rather comfortable  think more family friendly if  concern  Service more attentive though   Selection doesn't include wide variety Wynn but maybe  because encountered most American breakfast items french toast pancakes eggs etc  Again food simply average  hangover did appreciate congee =      My friend more Wynn Wynn more Bellagio  But Studio B Buffet inside M Hendersen wins heart  <EOR> Having read all reviews decided try Wicked Spoon Cosmopolitan then Buffet Bellagio  Boy treat Wicked Spoon but utter disappointment to say least Bellagio   The prices don't differ much but more should expected $30 Bellagio $27 Wicked Spoon on weekends well! sadly case   The hype surrounding crab legs turned meh moment  True pretty huge  easy mistake brine water freshness but texture gave them away  I'd imagined crab meat its luscious chewy grandeur but more less chewy strands soaked ice seawater  Wicked Spoon limited crab w drawn butter tasted superior even when bloated The meat department fared only average imo  alleged Kobe Beef definitely kind melts your mouth  Although Wicked Spoon offers similar stuff more variety least Galbi Braised Short Ribs at WS yummy   Dessert Oh don't started  WS throws its competition window  Bellagio even compare? would expect desserts should worthy Jean Phillipe Patisserie also hotel but far true  creme brulee bad but cheesecakes sorbets brought back horrific college dining hall memories  Compare fresh strawberries bite size apples coated amazing chocolate shots delicate mousse selection delectable fudges fresh flavorful gelato Wicked Spoon  desserts alone WS deserves 5 stars myself give Bellagio 2 stars   2 stars for service efficient although wasn't best cranberry juice I would hardly lying if said best thing all night     My only guess WS new buffet building its name line shorter outrageous!   few years bet that's vegas price line rating far exceed Bellagio  <EOR> i over memorial day weekend all think going back  holiday weekend lunch $30 95 opposed regular $20 95 believe  still cheaper charged wynn    i thoroughly surprised bellagio because heard mixed reviews friends  think buffet rivals rio favorite   mMm good selection food! pasta actually GOOD just pan full generic unflavored sauce noodles  lobster ravioli  mMm!!   also crab legs weren't great ones wynn  i cut open you're picking snapping but crab meat just wasn't sweet i'd like  oh bacon! hahah buffets gets bacon? yes do  such delicious crispy bacon  wish could side bacon all meals    also advice others going around 3 4 best because dinner selections lunch prices! kebabs delicious smelled good  my mouth watered watching cooks grill them  usually don't prime rib but loved prime rib  although au jus day SUPER SALTY  = also don't skip chicken noodle soup   good! big egg noodles big chunks chicken   not your average campbell's soup    and dessert course!  fruits fresh could see them cutting right then there! there's machine peach raspberry sorbet  creamy bit tart  couldn't stop eating chocolate white choco covered strawberries creme brulee! usually only eat top crispy burnt part creme brulee but custard actually good!   this definitely worth wait left stuffed satisfied! <EOR> It really really disappointing  Nothing tasty  Several things inedible  Definitely worth money spent  <EOR> It's three years since Sunday brunch buffet still dream it!  That hazelnut french toast chocolate almost put sweet food coma  <EOR> Amazing buffet  think only other five star buffet Boma DisneyWorld but easily earns its five stars  cusp between meals like 10ish between breakfast 4ish between lunch dinner sample more things  If room  food quality top notch  Several good sushi options great pasta dishes mushroom ravioli kobe beef tenderloin prime rib squab great gravies all kinds other stuff  simple cheese fruit well crafted fancy desserts place does right  must visit when Vegas  <EOR> After dancing night away Tao ready extravagant brunch buffet Bellagio! 11am much line inside  unlimited champagne brunch which cost $30 only $6 more regular brunch   My eyes always much bigger stomach buffets but now learned work system least wasteful  Check all food first proteins take small portions stay away carbs much possible then save most room dessert!  The food dinner buffet definitely much better brunch but also pay lot more  Brunch good but nothing really spectacular  beef tenderloin spicy tuna hand rolls spicy sweet sauce leg lamb favorites  desserts best part cheesecake carrot cake delectable!   My mimosa came large wine glass which smart end because don't come around pouring much  actually only managed drink glass which turned just enough  If stayed couple hours sure would've another glass two   If only time buffet during your stay I'd recommend Buffet Wynn instead  little pricier but much better variety! <EOR> Great buffet lots selections prime rib delicious worth  30 dollars <EOR> Dissapointing mediocre best crab watery drab presentation overall quality poor mimosas even bad don't know managed mess up    friend said gone downhill but tried anyways should gone wicked spoon instead  <EOR> This best buffet ever experienced  much food little stomach fill  All amazing desserts many sugar free  can't describe delicious everything was  think worth price eat many yummy things  <EOR> I thought triple B's stood Better Business Bureau   after coming years find nowadays stands Bellagio's B list Buffet really 3 star buffet king crab   thought giving 4 stars but back back food poisoning wouldn't allow it   The 10 year decline    Lobster ravioli morphed into mushroom ravioli which then just recently morphed into cheese ravioli  Doh! Mango floating islands became some apple dish glass  Rack lamb which favorite protein really gamey tasting gray under seasoned   like should tossed 2 days earlier  3rd time found such should probably knock off menu   The macaroons used big pillowy moist fresh   now they're small nothing special Chilean sea bass turned into barramundi recent downgrade Peeled shrimp extra large large changed while ago To top things off food poisoning! literally sprint bathroom upon leaving   I'm blaming salmon tuna poke one   I know tuna wasn't fresh   and hit last two visits  Fool twice shame me   What worked Decent prime rib King crab they heat back near Mexican station Pesto mashed potatoes spot on Service always pretty good They added caviar station near run your life poke Value   you still right before dinner pay lunch price if time right  Hashtag winning    If Vegas need buffet hit Bachannal Caesars   this lost luster years ago  <EOR> I've several times  Every time come am less impressed  first time came really impressed food! heard Buffet try Vegas  excellent variety foods desserts  snow crabs king crabs steaks prime ribs beef wellingtons chicken fishes pork shrimps mexican italian sushi salad bar dessert stations much much more  If would've reviewed place first time came just over year ago would've easily 5 stars  But next visits kinda disappointing  Meats weren't great food tasted bland very enjoyable first time  probably won't coming back buffet anymore unless something lures in   Also expect wait line solid 30 minutes! <EOR> I've Bellagio buffet three times each time quality down little  first time weekend champagne brunch awed selection overall quality variety food    The second time felt let down because remembered being better   The third time recent trip weekday lunch didn't lot things I'd expect casino buffet prime rib steak riblets steaklets?   also thought sushi bar lacking only handroll offering spicy tuna which good sushi buffet only raw fish roll  shrimp cocktail also much smaller shrimp large gulf shrimp past two times    We also wait rather long served drinks    That probably last time Bellagio buffet many new hotel casinos now quality Bellagio no longer best  <EOR> Warning anyone trying 7pm expect hour two waiting line    Personally buffet bellagio probably favorites Vegas mgm being favorite but particular always catches eye due few reasons    * interior design freaking gorgeous * Snow Crab legs galore  * fountain machine fancy pancy one automatic ones * Middle strip * Desert island!  Only thing don't price  Pricing wise if just spend 30 40$ more buffet buffet pass which enables multiple buffets 24 hours price 2 meals  Which turn usually looks first meal dinner Next day Breakfast Lunch Dinner Four grand meals price two    Other place multitude food categories italian chinese spain? saw paella more  also probably best deserts offered Vegas  If decide visit need try white chocolate moose nutella  amazing! That sums highly suggest getting early dinner avoid lines anyone looking location straight near anchorman machines  Not sure if layout changed sorry Just follow buffet directions looking up    Thanks meal! visit plenty times summer losing all money tables xD <EOR> Great variety very good quality buffet especially dessert bar!  service very good epecially considering large party  <EOR> This buffet rests laurels Bellagio name which probably why people line constantly  mlife card bypass general line sadly before people end line even chance eat! dont recommend eating unless you're comped  service very courteous prompt which earns buffet 1 star buffet gets another star some good desserts mainly its poke bar which braved despite warnings potential food poisoning fortunately did experience   There's also tartare served behind poke counter area  be sure ask it  Other prime rib dry flavorless well Kobe beef  Glad didn't pay full price meal  Don't think ever back again either  <EOR> Despite arm leg offer seated establishment I'd say food die for   buffet huge large selection desserts entrees!    Crab legs course mentioned fat juicy delicious!  Fun bring group people dine place clean each buffet station nicely presented constant filling food!  Crowds?  Sure crowds but don't even notice them station station taking eyefull deliciously cooked food     This place pricey but food alone worth it   I'd definitely again armed empty stomach especially desserts!  Tiny cups creme brulee!  YUM!! <EOR> Meh expecting more place Bellagio sushi   But overall don't think I'd come back   bad buffet all but rather Paris Paris   The food fresh lot variety but nothing wow factor  <EOR> Coming once every year  know way back then place used king crab sea bass fish  really love eating sea bass everytime coming but sadly anymore  somehow sure recently downgraded  right before 5pm there's no standing line time  just because today its thrusday wasn't during weekend any special occasion holiday  normally long line all way outside wait should around half hr 1 n half hour  $40 per person pretty decent price  no complaining because you're eating fancy buffet Bellagio lol   only thing wasn't much happy kind bothering place because kids ages over 5 would paid full price  really sucks  wouldn't mind paying half price  very clean spacious  desserts fantastic delicious  very friendly staffs great service  finished dirty dishes taken away promptly everytime refilled drinks  back once again soon  see next time  <EOR> Delicious! definitely return buffet  dessert food selection perfect  <EOR> I definitely shocked quality food caliber hotel  place made fatties me  Haha I can't believe friends sat 5 hours Lunch Dinner  When first told would paying $40 buffet little hesitant but worth it  waited 20 minutes once ditched everyone straight foods  glad last day Vegas all tight dress party over  4 plates different desserts almost put sweet food coma    It kinda embarrassing because server breaks twice when she came back still there  <EOR> JUST AWFUL   Seriously awful  far people gross everywhere isn't Bellagios fault people dip fingers mashed potatoes then lick them clean way next food   Anyways far restaurant goes   it's dark dingy feeling  the options all around sparse  seafood tasted old close being fresh wife eat sushi regularly tasted night wasn't sushi don't believe piece all brave enough put down  I tried resulting waffles pancakes but those dried crusty  would've better used hockey puck   Save your $35 per person take your wife girlfriend Raos! <EOR> Way overhyped   only good thing sushi   crab legs dry way over cooked lost all flavor  Everything else mediocre best   Excalibur Fremont lot better buffets then lot less cost    Avoid all cost   <EOR> All say am very disappointed   Period   somewhere else if want eat good buffet  <EOR> Well Vegas buffet  Nothing especially good but nothing bad well  However sheer amount variety food worth your while  serve every type breakfast food imaginable then some  There's decent  variety fresh produce low cal options although place if you're watching your weight  Come hungry  <EOR> Came brunch bottomless mimosas   ended paying around $50 per person food made  miserable  Nothing good  Nothing  Good thing glass really bottomless because only thing worth something  <EOR> Really very great   Atmosphere much busy cafe   Reminds Hometown buffet   just okay price tag Ruth Chris   food average best   crab fresh way salty   Sushi inedible   Prime Rib potatoes good   price find yourself nice elegant 5 star eatery really enjoy yourself   think good if overeat  <EOR> This review rates MULTIPLE restaurants recent trip KEEP READING! Ate early lunch 1015 AM Buffet Friday   Stood line almost hour   HIGHLY recommend using MLife cards because higher levels allow zip through express line average wait time under 5 minutes  Cost $32 person which GREAT deal food provided   still serving breakfast including omelets order lunch items well   Nice mixture meats including boiled shrimp prime rib etc  crab legs ONLY dinner which priced higher   arrangement buffet line more show efficiency odd design created lines choke points which should unnecessary   would eat again wished I'd chance try dinner menu  At high end spectrum Bacchanal buffet Caesar's Palace   If looking OUTSTANDING buffet PLACE EAT STRIP!  Everything classy efficient   never seen crab served did but should become GOLD STANDARD buffets EVERYWHERE   NONE crab piled high steam table watching people front cherry pick crab legs!  Instead walk counter your empty plate hand cook   He takes lid off huge steaming pot submerged crab legs BIG ONES TOO!    He stacks them your plate puts another plate top tips perpendicular floor i e  drain water hands your plate   legs claws come split meat very easy remove  NO cracking required!

I think favorite party entire buffet   was salad bar  Sadly only because everything else just alright  selection three greens variety toppings dressings  Oil vinegar side bar  Definitely some salad add some prime rib pieces into it  It'll your night since everything else   won't   Dessert just alright  didn't finish anything  Portions small which nice don't feel you've wasted much food when don't finish  pretty big selection    Overall most likely coming back   Food 2 5  Service 4 5  Overall 2 5  <EOR> We end lunch could dinner lunch price  meat selection dinner phenomenal  sushi all fresh  pasta over cooked sauces flavorless   For buffet little better other buffets eaten but much better price charge  <EOR> I'm usually frequent buffet goer but probably best buffet to  wait inside wasn't long when early dinner 20 min but understandable why would take time letting people even though tables available  buffet area isn't large if every table full people would chaos    The food enjoyed most seafood  quick summary sea bass YUM! smoked salmon crab legs YUM!!!   mussels bit sandy sushi wasn't good but made having some delicious desserts  creme brulee die creamy hint coffee flavor raspberry chocolate mousse cone wonderful surprise bottom cone  Definitely worth trying every single dessert they're all petit sized yes possible no judge  Also watermelon ridiculously red couldn't resist eating whole bunch slices!  The waiters nice pretty quick but waiter definitely little bit confused drinks  ordered ginger ale coke iced tea  first time he brought ginger ale coke sprite second time he brought ginger ale sprite iced tea very weird  picky didn't really matter much   the buffet def must when vegas <EOR> Pretty weak price compared Bacchanal just next door   Bacchanal few days ago night day compared dump   Everything service food atmosphere don't compare   If half price might worth but unless stay hotel buffet free don't come here  <EOR> I seen buffet food paradise seemed would great place eat all hype show  all eat crab legs thing son excited try  complete disappointment first all pay $7 park eat place  Then pay almost $80 horrible disappointing meal  crab legs joke told phone would snow crab which fine but weren't any crab legs ever super small couldn't even meat them few clusters huge waste  left dissapointed wasted almost $80 meal could back home $20  horrible waste money time  Sad see people consider fantastic place eat  <EOR> If you're guy need take dump midway through your meal use restrooms located right outside buffet way cleaner!

No oysters though  All all satisfying meal still super stuffed! <EOR> Over priced avg buffet   food decent but worth $30 per person  If rate it   the closest comparison would Golden corral buffet  <EOR> I expecting better more variety  desserts awesome reason three stars  food average  dinner enough variety meats considering dinner  Only prune rib rare other option  people enjoy sushi seafood always variety but don't eat seafood  general won't pay 40 dollars just desserts  <EOR> No wait holiday weekend brunch? bad sign  Wynn Bacchanal Wicked spoon all lines normal weekends  Maybe just timing right? Maybe not  While food wasn't horrible Station Casino standard  nice upscale hotel food quality inexcusable  made matters worse organization food incomprehensible    I waterlogged snow crab search cocktail sauce lemon melted butter  butter cereal lemon cocktail sauce over sushi along waterlogged shrimp    I slice prime rib turned stringy tough  Where au jus mashed potatoes creamed spinach? au jus across room same table maple syrup  kid lady almost accidentally put au jus pancakes mashed potatoes searching for  later found cheese blintzes strawberry sauce over baked fish fruit over sushi cheese Caesar salad  green salad carving station mixed salads opposite side buffet   The last search whipped cream cobbler  looked everywhere before finally asking lady waved vaguely desserts  walked around saw none  asked lady behind desserts she brought tray refrigerator scooped serving  back table found unsweetened   It's sad best thing eat mixed green salad made crumbled blue cheese balsamic dressing sunflower seeds  parmesan crisps good too  picky eater either  humorously frustrating experience  became scavenger hunt find anything   Really Bellagio?

Well figured just single incident until seen another woman doing another family  Having them stand waiting instead waiting till table ready bring them over  Very poor service but  only complaint  Couldn't catch name because name tags very small she didn't introduce herself  She shoulder length orangish brown hair chewing gum entire time  <EOR> Terrible terrible! All food tasted same  Huge disappointment many nice meals hotel  Yelpers skip buffet save yourself wait line <EOR> My friends Vegas pass weekend decided since heard better buffets Vegas  came lunch friday afternoon  line long but bad  large group paid $25 which included gratuity  lot cheaper expected    Service really quick efficent oppose most buffets Vegas  server really top things extremely friendly  Some items really stood was Eggs Benedict Mini Sliders Tri tip Pesto Tortellini Bow tie pasta Chow Mein Spicy Tuna Hand rolls Tiramisu Chocolate cake  At first friends wanted all eat buffet pass thing 45 bucks but decided wanted quality over quantity am glad here  Very good quality food service  <EOR> Very very disappointed  Such classy hotel great chefs but buffet horrible  dined New Year's Eve  Prime rib lobster tail Alaskan crab legs all sounded amazing  better buffets cruise ships  cost evening 80$ per person New Year's Eve but definitely worth it  All food cold no flavor  Would recommend anyone  Reserve Olives Bellagio instead  <EOR> It first time eating here  food just tooooo salty taste such cream spinach tacos  Kobe beef tough texture  strawberries tart sweet  could see lot staff  dining room area chatting amongst themselves  Overall experience poor  waste  money  recommend  <EOR> I think buffet isn't bad regardless price  weekend $32 person brunch  Which don't think unreasonable buffet   You all your usual prime rib shrimp cocktails variety Chinese foods spanish foods seafood  quite few seafood salads smoked salmon really good well  roasted lamb very good opinion  addition obviously there's big selection breakfast foods two omelette making stations custom your omelette you   There's no alcoholic beverages included price dessert section very large compared some other vegas buffets but good solid buffet opinion  definitely price well  <EOR> The seeming gold standard which all buffets judged stands Buffet Bellagio   The food little higher end items such roasted lamb paella honey glazed slab bacon gourmet pizza along usual suspects such prime rib roasted turkey made order omelettes waffles etc   All food well prepared service great   The only thing disappointing Bellagio desserts   Although look high end taste leaves something desired  <EOR> Not expert Las Vegas buffet places but 2 times come Vegas gone buffet brunch loved every second it  great assortment breakfast lunch options such smoked salmon trout scallop ceviche shrimp coctail breads fresh fruit salads pancakes eggs french toast  Anything imagine brunch mere price tag $26 or something that   even prime rib station  roasted potatoes silky perfect  always stock smoked salmon shrimps probably money's worth since much buffet eater  say dessert options lacking  But Bellagio buffet where eat way much having drank way much  But hey you're Vegas!

<EOR> Great service decent food  Although asked steamed crab legs but cold middle old bay seasoning masking sweet crab flavor and fresh     Our group 9 enjoyed dessert bar most  <EOR> Not gigantic selection food some other buffets but everything extremely good  plenty room seating price $30 30 2 PM Wednesday  <EOR> Out all buffets Vegas chose because read online better quality ones  The ones Wynn Caesar's Palace seemed high marks too  dinner day Christmas holiday prices $47 99 person   pretty steep but it   believe usual dinner price $32   really outrageous 2 hour 10 minute wait table line moved extremely slowly!  If known wait long wouldn't done it   never life waited long eat meal!  rather miserable hadn't eaten all day   actually gave people option paying $20 front line flash passes rides amusement parks   probably worth paying but didn't it   As far food itself selection pretty good   There's several things I'd never eat didn't really try them now   But almost many foods did such pesto mashed potatoes very tasty! gnocchi shrimp cocktail cold calamari salad sushi turkey cornbread stuffing   Overall think quality food great!  buffet crab legs split half   didn't try them but boyfriend did   He thought OK   He didn't know chilled weren't large he thought   hot melted butter them but combined chilled legs gave them lukewarm funny temperature   Many people eating piles them   The interior very nice elegant   after all Bellagio   waiter very nice   all those thousands diners employees worked heads off! <EOR> OK best buffet Las Vegas when first opened many new buffets  dinner $32 person  impressed since food lacked flavor quality food gone down bit  prime rib raviolis sea bass only dishes thought decent  called Kobe beef disgusting no marbling whats ever  its bought select roast cooked medium rare  Turkey okay  sushi no way avoid  tuna poki good  dessert section OK better bacchanal  remember old days buffet unbelievably good  When Steve Wynn owned casino place eat  going back  <EOR> Wonderful Buffet! If want it!  Yes am willing pay hefty price feed taste buds here!  experience dont want miss   Bellagio Buffet seeing again soon! <EOR> For price expected more lot more   lunch 5 years ago disapopinted lack selection   many other better buffets choose Paris Encore Wynn   would skip worth it   Derek <EOR> Came Sunday brunch noon   spread! Typical breakfast foods french toast waffles cereal oatmeal eggs made order etc well heartier lunch foods Asians dishes even sushi   Food high quality ingredients all looked tasted fresh   Service quick glass orange juice remained topped off entire time   Not cheap $25 $30 champagne but pretty good   especially considering both breakfast lunch  <EOR> I've Bellagio buffet couple times  favorite   until Wynn buffet opened  much food all good! LOVE buffets ate ton food  Whatever wanted had   I plan return Bellagio buffet someday  update review afterward  Overall grade A BEST buffets 1 Wynn 2 Bellagio <EOR> Went first time  Gourmet Dinner 49 99  very disappointed   No flavor food  ended skipping food deserts  Saw favorite desert napoleon great either  better bakery next house    The only thing liked strawberry shortcake cup desert  good  But worth 49 99     Been twice Wicked Spoon wich GREAt but told really good case  again  stick already know great  <EOR> My family five including wife in laws buffet Saturday afternoon late June 2015 during trip Vegas  Overall very dissatisfied experience here   Here biggest issues experience Buffet Bellagio 1  Being weekend supposed brunch buffet true many breakfast y items  However general very hard construct meaningful meal items there  example fried rice chow mein but no Chinese entrees could those  brother in law big lover meat he nothing satisfied appetite  myself big lover seafood again nothing would really fancy such lobster scallops crabs sushi  supposed least 3 types sushi based place cards saw but sushi mostly run never replenished  2  stations very poorly laid result placement items made very little sense  recollect another buffet experience where layout worse here  example french toast section but maple syrup nowhere found next it  Eventually asking staff member able locate it  far only having problem little girl asked where maple syrup once managed drizzle french toast  Likewise sorbets icecreams but very far each other  Toppings sorbets icecreams also different sections even though most people might want access broad assortment toppings  3  Lastly found service quite unfriendly  server Claudia think don't think she or any other waitstaff encountered smiled even once during entire 2 hours there  Food items also regularly replenished when inquired sushi which run staff did appear apologetic expressed no interest replenishing items  final illustration lack helpfulness staff standing line inquired wait times  staff members commented would 45 minute wait getting ready leave hearing such long wait time  However end did stand line wait turned no more 20 minutes  shorter wait time certainly appreciated but then again would left restaurant basis incorrect information provided staff member  Overall would say deeply unsatisfying unfulfilling experience certainly when considered against $30 price paid complete bust  view served very mediocre food laid most haphazard manner imaginable combined unfriendly unwelcoming service  would definitely back buffet again especially when many options choose Las Vegas  <EOR> The server best warm but variety kind food any  more choice holiday brunch $37 99 per person ! <EOR> I little hesitant try Buffet Bellagio   can't say great experiences concerning buffet lines   But particular wonderful   Yes expensive but buffet offers copious amounts delicious food   On first round chose shrimp cocktail spicy tuna rolls baked sea bass miso soup   arranged everything artistically plate proceeded dine   Let tell shrimp cocktail delicious!  spicy tuna rolls satisfactory   pleasantly surprised sea bass   miso soup tasted little bland though   On next round tried different pasta dishes shrimp cocktail again salmon   liked everything plate time   The desserts sweet   tried fried bananas caramel sauce   at least  think was   good but just started sweet   The buffet great way fill without breaking your bank other more expensive establishments   think worth your money extremely satisfying meal  <EOR> One word amazing!  Where start herb crusted prime rib great king crab legs great sushi fresh  large selection any appetite  Enjoy!! <EOR> Do if hungry  would good thing!!  lot food duh know buffet     Here had spinach onion mushroom cooked order omelet which give 3 5   bit bland but fiber in    Spicy tuna hand roll California roll   best but palatable  Beet salad cabbage garbanzo bean salad Caesar salad  really good  Didn't eat dessert because blow stuffed gills   Looked good but friends said outstanding    Simply put buffet Bellagio bad be?? <EOR> We loved buffet  learn come dinner during weekend because 2 hours standing line  time round came week day before 3 pm  waited only 10 min bit cheaper too  food excellent  service good! But very favorite bread pudding! Please try delicious! <EOR> Waited hour only find didn't crab legs   needless say pissed  <EOR> It monday night vegas decided check Bellagio Buffet   used highly rated buffet used somewhat look forward coming but may possible buffet gone down quality buffet eating days over   They pretty broad selection foods Chinese Japanese Italian everything in between   definitely no lack variety here     Many items standard fare higher end buffets Sin City   mountain shrimp cocktail snow crab legs ice always draw small line   shrimp cocktail usual appetizing but snow crab fresh usual funny taste it   meat hard shells which usually sign crab wasn't fresh   Maybe being Monday something it   The selection fish great   Salmon prepared sashimi smoked poached every which way imagine   also swordfish sea bass   For dessert fans huge bar filled mini cheesecakes carrot cake soft serve ice cream creme brulee much much more   great anyone just wants try little bit everything   I would still venture Vegas buffets   Once awhile just variety don't care enough think specific restaurant eat at   smorgasbord Bellagio good backdrop eating competition where quantity rules over quantity  <EOR> I am rating specifically BREAKFAST  no clue dinner like  But breakfast buffet more options any other too  Also omelette making guy awesome  would come simply ask surprise me  breakfast well priced  service fast  location course beautiful Bellagio  <EOR> Not worth money wait line  buffet Brunch Saturday    food just ok   edible but nothing run home tell your mother it  waffles hard dry  meats extra fatty very rare  eggs super runny  breakfast sausage good but  pretty hard screw up  pizza ok too  muscles dry  king crab legs ok buffet standards  pork belly juicy delicious did many options desserts just your standards tried almost everything but only happy keylime tart    Overall think Belliago Buffet more old school vegas vibe  standard options  newer hotel buffets strip i e  Cosmopolitan Aira etc seems give only standards but different variations them well providing other unique options same price buffet  <EOR> Pros Lots shrimp crab legs   Good dessert Good roasted ham turkey beef Freshly squeezed juices You ever may like   Cons Long line waiting hours They easily give pager Expensive but worth it <EOR> Came breakfast last day Vegas   little everything but didn't finish everything   exploring options food offer   wasn't half bad but buffet you're going little less expect normal restaurant wait staff   Eggs bacon cold rather warm   chocolate croissant AMAZING but found almost impossible find haha   Fruits some flavored yogurt great too   Don't French toast pancakes   very bland   belgian waffle couldn't even cut knife!!! Wow!! would LOVE try dinner buffet next time there   looked FANTASTIC!!!!! almost grabbed plate free dinner  Haha! <EOR> Been lunch buffet couple times   am brunch buffet person just think any brunch buffet just so so no matter pricey great everyone else seems think is   Something all food just sitting many selections overwhelming me   definitely bank me I struggle pick maybe 2 plates picked food   prime rib corn chowder lox  actually pretty good  did eat that! chinese food terrible tho don't even bother  <EOR> I higher aspirations buffet Bellagio   could handle price but expecting little more WOW factor offerings especially dessert side   ate good but hoping something little more indulgent impressive  <EOR> I hate buffets really do  But where else french toast pizza plate?  I came brunch  While food quality decent expecting bit more selection  wasn't terrible but Bellagio Buffet didn't quite live hype   Boo long wait felt quite pathetic waiting 30 min  line food   I'm lardass heart    <EOR> Good lunch buffet but few odd annoyances knock down star  First why waiting table when over half tables buffet empty? plus side suppose wait gave time hungrier    As buffet itself steak excellent star show along BBQ pork ribs  also salad bread Asian sushi stations  All worth try but mostly ate meat rather filling bread  shrimp cocktail excellent once finally came but shrimp less nearly entire time redoing ice used displaying shrimp  done but does really justify closing shrimp station nearly hour lunch? desserts good well but saw some jackass drop tongs floor put them back buffet  noticed turned tongs buffet guy replaced them yuck  thisclose eating strawberry tart side shoe dirt   I enjoyed buffet back hopefully shrimp available whole time  wife horrified much food ate means food good she thinks pig sure want answer one  <EOR> Err think wrong day  Where king crab?  why only $25 person lunch Saturday  could've sworn king crab weekends bah   So way think next leading item lunch prime rib very tasty  Most other items ranged average good but much else spectacular  heard buffet gone downhill recent years but no basis comparison  <EOR> At first thought am spending more deserves but getting mingling around eating  totally happy quality food drink desserts   really did worth money time  Trust your research see highest rated buffet Vegas   Enjoy your stay food  <EOR> We dinner twice two different trip Vegas far think best buffet Vegas far! lot variety everything tastes quite good excellent  love king crab legs! certainly back  <EOR> Worst buffet ever  Bellagio most good looking hotels but buffet worst ever  smells butcher raw old meat smell very old everything nothing taste good  <EOR> On recent trip Las Vegas wife ate buffet two separate occasions   Once breakfast once lunch   ate buffet years ago remembered being better now least breakfast anyway   first breakfast must say less impressed selection   your standard omelette station along other breakfast staples bacon sausage biscuits gravy toast etc   food all pretty good just felt bit underwhelming being Bellagio buffet   hotel much glitz glamour associated all its other restaurants just felt breakfast buffet lacking bit   When lunch couple days later better   many more options such sliders BBQ beef brisket prime rib etc   dessert station lacking though   few selections pie cake ok but just standard ice cream machine might find Ponderosa   Other buffets such Wynn Aria much better selection desserts opinion   Overall buffet just A Ok   great but bad   price breakfast around $20 per person which thought reasonable Bellagio   eating though see why cost is   feeling completely renovate buffet before long   Just gut feeling   way decent but won't rushing back here  <EOR> The food good  nothing compared buffet Wynn  Will never back  <EOR> Bon passé le décor qui te fait croire à un Campanile de Sartrouville est propulsé dans l'abondance et l'opulence et les grosses panses    Alors les 4 étoiles c'est vraiment pour les perles qu'on peut trouver au milieu de daubes   Déjà évite le coin Jap  Les sushis c'est du congelé décongelé sûrement  Et évite les trucs fromages chelou j'ai eurk dans mon assiette  Mais après il y'a de tout  Du Chinois pour une qualité correcte du veggie si vous la jouer petit joueur y'a tout pour faire sa propre salade des minis burgers des pâtes mauvaises apparemment dommage de la viande à la découpe  Dessert là c'est la fête du slip profusion de couleur et de saveurs c'est vraiment délicat servis dans des petites portions parfait vraiment  La boisson à volonté prenez le ice tea sweet c'est assez sucré mais c'est un subtil mélange entre grenadine et ice tea    Aller fiston mes préférés sont Le bacon avec sa Strawberry sauce   Les oeufs brouillés Les mini burgers pas mal  Pizza peperroni Après en dessert Cake au citron Gâteau au mascarpone  Tarte à la noix de pécan    Le prix lunch à 25 93$ à cette date du 23 Mars 2015 taxe incluse  PS attention vous risquer de repartir avec du Kg au cuissot ! <EOR> I would give place three half stars but think four star review inflated here's three stars   The Sunday champagne brunch comparable Wynn dinner over year ago Spice Market dinner also over year ago Mirage lunch two days before  nothing piss yourself over  more expensive Mirage lunch buffet isn't much variety would hoped for    Shrimp cocktail = also Mirage lunch buffet  Prime rib = also Mirage lunch buffet same if worse  Chilean sea bass = eh   I just don't see big deal is  unlimited champagne which pay extra $5 only difference  lazy refilling champagne server really attentive nice  She even filled last time before left walked full champagne flute way gamble   If other buffets offered champagne brunch I'd there  disappointment  never come again  <EOR> If want great experience single advice Don't Bucchanal buffet before coming Buffet Bellagio  did exactly bar set pretty damn high expectations  Since Caesar's Palace right thought Bellagio would just good   With said boy disappointment    After waiting 20 30 minutes line joint find myself wondering why didn't just pay few extra bucks Bucchanal instead  Food here's very lackluster  the variety very limited quality very sub par both food well dessert portions  Perhaps only dishes really liked pastas crab legs  Ambience also pretty minimalistic opinion  When first came Bellagio's Buffet decade ago setting considered posh elegant time  Well 10+ years never seem upgrade place match modern times  thought pretty sad looking place  inside biggest casinos strip  Even service pretty minimal  Since beverages self served only table service provided dirty plate removal  felt bad all older servers scrambling hold all dirty plates since looked if trapped enslaved work against will  $50 head memorial day weekend pricing would much rather saved dough eat somewhere else more worthy time hard earned cash  <EOR> Bellagio buffet good but amazing everyone portrays be  definitely good selection but feel lot items heavily salted  <EOR> I expecting very good buffet price wait   tried variety things mediocre terrible   food seasoned well   tried ceviche Mediterranean flavor just right   crab legs cold although heat them if ask felt pain do   sea bass bok choy best thing tried   Overall expected more buffet Bellagio friendly staff though  <EOR> This USED favorite buffet Vegas but WOW place fallen  Self serve drink station EVEN WATER!

Just some perks being Mlife card holder  The buffet expensive especially hotel Bellagio but thing heard come hour early pay breakfast price punch price before start switching plates save around $12 $20 USD  bad Ehhh      The selection superb which only buffet Bellagio would meat station Kobe beef juicy tender prime rib suculent baby pigs chicken Roast beef   The seafood section which favorite part if buffet second would dessert huge large size shrimp ice cocktail sauce side king crab legs which already cut half don't break legs dig meet but clampers available    The desert section just half circle buffet includes different kinds cookies cakes pastries last but least GELATO!! =P   What also seperates buffet other strip buffets restroom located inside buffet don't walk outside through casino tempted gamble  Most buffets designed walk when using restroom gamble but +++   Did mention customer aervicewas excellent incident proved waitress above beyond buffet guests  planning going back new plate decided leave cell phone table when came back table disappeared thought someone stolen it  Then waitress came back told she thought left buffet wanted keep safe hands incase amiss impressed she done especially watching customer  couldn't remember name but remember she looked never forget honest caring she unlike other waitresses buffets just having bad day  Psssh!  I shall return buffet eveytime visit Vegas   = <EOR> Taking into consideration cost give two  think quality food gone down since last visit price gone least 25%  didn't take any pictures because place crowded patrons trying put food plates  Would back? Probably saying bad just me  Maybe just outgrown it    Lol <EOR> I scouting yelp reviews buffet couple months waiting next time friend came into town could try it   weekend dinner payed $40each   I must say huge disappointment   used fan Rio seafood buffet but gone way down quality over years really looking forward getting some King Crab legs Bellagio even though chilled steamed     To dismay crab good   Both King Snow crab no flavor some actually smelled bad   But am basing review dismal crab   I read many posts good Kobe beef Beef Wellington numerous other items great just weren't all good     The Kobe beef tasted dry roast beef   Beef Wellington ok never before but didn't knock socks off   Lamb chops bit gamey lots Lamb   best things ever tasted  Lamb Chop Oregon Coast wasnt' even close   The sushi smelled foul only could muster courage try tuna which would expect low dollar buffet    The only high point Prime Rib very large tasty Peel Eat shrimp   Prime Rib very good au jus also really good   Prime Rib isn't good Lowry's Prime Rib but top notch Buffet Prime Rib   many disappointments buffet Prime Rib Bellagio isn't them     There also couple vegitable dishes other sides good but price expected way more   buffet Green Valley Ranch third cost quality food much better   much selection high end stuff but when crab Kobe Beef Sushi all suck really bad point becomes moot   I gave two stars because between peel eat shrimp good Prime Rib think $$ worth  <EOR> Its true when folks say best buffet Vegas  Now did all other buffets but its quite good  Just taste meat know meat nice steakhouse  Great sushit selection also nice selection fish all impecable quality  Search no further Vegas buffets  <EOR> The Buffet Bellagio best buffet LV  much food choose each them delicately prepared  kobe beef though doubt if its real really good  King crabs cut its easier work with  Sashimi fresh  dessert much choose taste really good  would definitely come back if money  <EOR> Had buffet dinner during Labor Day weekend   food quality gone down notch since last visited   price quite bit $52 person   crab legs super salty cold  waitress afterwards told could asked reheat crab leg plates  little late   Chinese foods don't taste good   Spanish Italian dishes decent   meat prime rib hangar steak lamb chop good  plethora choices nearby would skip line buffet next time  <EOR> What world happened Bellagio Buffet?!?

All all really enjoyed it  <EOR> I experienced buffet when came Vegas during Thanksgiving break!

Service good well coffee desserts rocked well!  My least favorite Chinese because felt very ordinary therefore very non gourmet   gourmet matches quality other serving stations    Pricey but worth just sure come hungry  <EOR> Alrighty   goes     I am Red Bull addict     Like going 5 years now   Studying CPA repeatedly did me     But where ELSE would need more Vegas?!   why absolutely NO qualms ordering Red Bull Bellagio Buffet   No shame   Most memorable part?

If could give no stars would    We visited spot December because stayed Bellagio family friends bday given VIP line pass because room staying in  thought fabulous because buffet lines Vegas ridiculously long    Anyways VIP line was nearly long regular line VIP  wait 15 mins pay  When arriving cashier specifically told lady charge all parties including tips party 6 7ppl some still coming down room she obliged   paying waited another 15 mins finally seated  20 mins  later another lady came stated must move different table because cashier lady did charge other guests! Wtf!!? Long story short much discussion everything straightened out   We Sunday brunch selections expected  If want pay $40 eat pancakes sausage comparable ihop then here    Overall would back  Food great customer service definitely sucks including GM    Stay clear bacchanal! Much better far! <EOR> Although other seats available placed group booth immediately next dishwashing entrance  gripe perhaps profiled whatever reason much tip though would leave etc  gripe why would put tables area ANY customer sit without effectively buffering noise?   There loud crashing clanking dishes dinnerware reverberated off walls absolutely ruined meal  really doesn't matter quality food when sounds piercing your eardrum trying chew    My recommendation if trying place sorry location request different table even if wait longer  all throwing down quite chunk $ price  better yet should fix noise problem itself  <EOR> Whenever am Vegas buffet love come to  food always delicious  many different options chose from  even sushi fresh seafood! desert bar best! <EOR> Great food but prepare long wait  Service could better but overall food experience good  always bring family here  <EOR> Two things King crab snow crab  Those alone cover $40 fee per person  C'mon people stop complaining  King crab legs $12 99 lb sometimes more grocery stores  including shell  am pretty sure ate more two pounds each King snow crab meat  Then there's dessert  many choose dizzy trying fave chocolate cake pie  Both good  time over stuffed couldn't see nor think food anymore  <EOR> the cashier douchebag here  a child costs same adult  place hyped alot stuff seemed fancy but just   false some reason  not great  wynn better much better <EOR> Reputation Everything  assuming good which Buffet Bellagio seems still 100 people waiting line!    just shame food can't back anymore   While pretty darn good last time Buffet now seems living off its reputation more anything else   Although 40 people line when arrived it more doubled time left able bypass wait making reservation   trade off fixed 18% gratuity but well worth much faster all 12 seated together   Plus probably would tipped much anyways   On plus side wide variety choose from   nearly every other Vegas buffet sections Asian food sushi sashimi seasonal fruits various salads pastas pizzas seafood including fresh king crab legs    addition also couple carvery stations offering meaty favorites prime rib Kobe beef ribs pork belly rack lamb well stations made to order tacos caviar   course dessert bar wealth selections cap your meal   While all variety great also necessary order find things worth eating   Most food just okay handful tasty items but carvery meats really disappointing though prime rib okay rack lamb good but Kobe beef AWFUL tough flavorless    Furthermore tacos pretty bleh two three caviars just tobiko ikura like Japanese restaurants sashimi didn't look appetizing all   At $39 head regular Saturday night dinner price comparable better buffets Strip Wynn's buffet Cosmo's Wicked Spoon two but food felt step two behind   TWO HALF STARS rounded because things salmon mousse cups smoked salmon chocolate covered strawberries rack lamb plus items   Plus part just hopes bad night   However if paid pocket the resort credit staying Bellagio covered meal would rounded down  <EOR> Still favorite buffet Vegas   isn't perfect but haven't found better one   most offer high quality meats seafood   favorites visit beef pork crab legs   Love crab legs served cut half no cracking needed   would pass Asian cuisine but rest food pretty good   ton desserts but Wicked dessert bar beats especially because Wicked offers gelato   buffet visit when hit Vegas! <EOR> Went Saturday night   paid $168 00 4 people  waste money!! Waited line hour  Kobe beef tasted shoe leather snow crab legs frozen wonton soup tasted bad Chinese ribs super fatty tasteless flan tasted flem bread hard pizza gross didn't any desserts  thought Vegas buffets good cheap  boy wrong!!!! <EOR> The best aspect weekend brunch bottomless champ $5  did some calculations  bottle comparable champagne $2 99 must drink approximately 1 5 bottles break even which would normally no problem except doing buffet would decrease eating efficiency   Another highlight experience shrimp pizza  only negative experience standing behind skinny people picking through baskets shrimp appeared choosing quality over quantity  Also total lack oysters half shell    I never witnessed desert buffet own eyes because immobilized eating lots pizzas Prime Rib  recovered immediately passing hotel bed  <EOR> So two half years ago breakfast really enjoyed it  decided would come famous dinner buffet  7pm Thursday bit under impressed  Well actually first buffet chocolate milk impressive  But food    much  Rockfish cod kalbi beef brisket all dry  salmon great though  salmon tuna poke nigiri  salmon once again great but tuna really  smoked salmon bite type thing delicious  did care creamed spinach all  general salmon very well everything else hit miss  also dessert very well  white chocolate nutella cone which great chocolate mousse creme brulee  4 stars    3 dinner 5 breakfast  <EOR> I came try cuz people said its best buffet strip but don't think so  Paying $80 good doesn't even taste good really worth it  rather fine dining restaurant  guess Buffett just never good <EOR> Yes!   Do yourself favor ADD Bottomless Mimosa's Bloody Marys your already much needed brunch    Like say BIG THANK CELSO Bar area made experience buffet memorable fella awesome great attitude great server never once empty Mimosa glass really speaks volumes yes am bar yes bar holds less then 20 seats but he associates serve all drinks big buffet room said never empty glass love it!

The food honest okay nothing really stood buffet few things OK but Game Drink fill tummy food    Got doggy bag no food 0 So if stay course try but if your near want ball trust try cool buffet because regret BUZZ!   Later! <EOR> Wasn't good Old crab go regular meal The buffet nothing brag <EOR> REALLY??! 4 STARS?!  I excited try buffet Bellagio   Reading all reviews all buffets Vegas seemed best ones   family Vegas Christmas watch Cirque du Solei wanted dinner before show   buffet conveniently located next O theater   It took hour stood line 3 30pm   can't even imagine long would take during normal dinner hours   Since holidays $45 per person   such high prices reviews expecting bomb ass dinner     Maybe expectations high realistically met but thought all food average below average   tried various cuts beef duck thought all meat towards dry side   Also tried foie gras good     I know everyone raves all eat crab legs   BUT THEYRE COLD!!  When crab meat cold don't really warm butter didn't really improve taste either   I excited try all cute desserts but all ok but chocolate mousse pretty good   Even if buffet $30 wouldn't think nearly worth don't think eat again  <EOR> It's best buffet Vegas anymore  sure  almost want give 2 stars but think still better most buffets    I came couple days before Christmas because friend front line pass  glad he because line looked pretty long  nice just able walk in  cost $48 because holiday prices but didn't seem worth it    They Alaskan King Crab legs standard snow crab legs prime rib  even Kobe round which looked better tasted  meat tough good all  should figured when lady took forever slicing everybody else's meat didn't even bother mine ended thick 1 1 2 inch piece  Both types crab legs very tasty  dessert offerings did include crepe gelato which thought standard fare higher end buffets  Everything tasted just bleh worth price   I've Bellagio quite few times before used regard better buffets Vegas  last time though really disappointed probably won't returning anytime soon  <EOR> If want true Las Vegas buffet experience Buffet Bellagio must  food amazing huge variety  Some notable offerings prime rib kobe sirloin chilled king crab legs beef wellington  deserts amazing especially creme brulee tiramisu  Being more upscale hotels Legas buffet bit more expensive others but definitely worth quality matches price quite well  <EOR> It hurts give Bellagio Buffet 1 star but food absolutely horrible  If husband says food bad then bad  ask fork 3 times because every fork received dirty dried food soap scum! rotisserie chicken drier sponge homemade mashed potatoes taste made spoiled milk beef brisket looked patio desk completely dried out    For $49 Bellagio expected mouth watering selections total opposite  if you're hungry don't care taste convenient then enjoy but just wasted $50    Oh no Crab Legs until 3 30pm no creme brûlée done  buffet Paris hotel tasted MUCH better Bellagio  Only gave review star because poor waitress Cici!

They've all kinds food best part quality food  Ya pay $20 somewhere else same array foods but knows long its sitting there  end day when can't Bellagio Wynn buffet Paris buffet other great alternatives!  CONCLUSION EAT IT! fatty! eat eat eat! <EOR> Looks exciting yelp reviews family recommendation BUT someone isn't into seafood least dinner  pizza really really good say wanted take whole pie home paid really should have! Don't dinner if your aren't big seafood  would check next time lunch time but sure if want disappointed again waste money  <EOR> Went brunch here  impressed first    Then when back second plate same thing all around definitely wouldn't impressed  main thing liked smoked salmon cream cheese  desserts wasn't all either  looooove desserts  very busy packed servers pretty attentive good  <EOR> We've very nice lunch!

NOPE  Its just your average buffet restaurant no different outside $15 20 buffet  Sushi terrible!!! nothing hyped about  first last visit buffet    Service runners = outstanding thumbs The hotel still gorgeous since opened back 90's  <EOR> Why people wait hour long lines buffet? guess Vegas  passes avoid wait figured why gorge ourselves little   For buffet fairly impressive  sushi alone propels Bellagio above most Vegas buffets heard about  But still buffet  won't spot George Clooney eating here  <EOR> So far dinner Friday Saturday brunch    On Friday food excellent service bit slow but place huge  biggest gripe quality food price Saturday  reheated some food Saturday Friday  Specifically pasta marinara sauce      Also allot buffets welcome 30 000 runners families some type discount  Bellegio having any that  Price 60 2    Would recommend visit craving mirage 50% discount rest weekend  Also  pro tip maybe send hostess front some pr training she acts she's working dmv  Brash ready pounce expected such beautiful property  <EOR> We dinner arrived Vegas  just remember being cheap but forgot selection limited    Their food dry tasty  Dessert looks good but enough back ever again  <EOR> The best buffet MGM Grand Hotel! Best Variety amazing flavored food  Great Servers well! <EOR> This really isn't high end buffet purports be  Pretty much standard non descript buffet offerings exception crab legs which seem big deal many eating there     anyhow    the crabs fine   if  then perhaps place would work you    onto other seafood    the premade sushi meh    the shrimp small water logged   like really just good    the pastas didn't even bother trying looked unenspired   the pizza   well   it's buffet pizza guess good could actually right?      sad no Asian dumplings other some Chinese pork buns  lamb chops nice  overcooked  roast beef tasty enough  desserts again   not much trumpet except mango coconut pane cotta which yummy back seconds  Friendly attentive waitstaff          we buffets comped price value ratio didn't bother much  But if shell 40 bucks dinner buffet would disappointed   Indian casino back east does comparable job fraction cost   I  tried other more expensive buffets vegas   generally avoid buffets   but would suggest if higher end buffet experience vegas want    I would research little before heading here  <EOR> We came into town few days visit friend  friend took buffet  first thought WOW  biggest buffet ever seen  Any kind meat wanted  potato bar beyond amazing  Every kind pie came wanted  service great  <EOR> Very poor options vegetarians  just 1 pasta wife could eat  meat options great tasty which able enjoy!!  Please please please add some more veggie options come wife  <EOR> Buffets generally good     food mass produced generally just isn't super tasty  buffet no exception    wasn't bad but wasn't great  would say best items ribs mashed potatoes sliders    all fairly decent  asian selections all very good  desserts weren't anything special either     PS buffet free using MyVegas can't complain that! <EOR> I' m absolutely  disappointments place! $70 2 people brunch time! Nothing eat only sweet deserts bread  If honest food so so!  don't know diner  time food but strongly  recommend  ignore place  brunch time! <EOR> ***************************** 1425 ***************************     always Buffet Bellagio especially during weekday lunch  only $23 99 bargain quality food serving       Buffet offers quite few live action cooking stations such eggs crepe spare rib meatloaf turkey chicken stations  Guests may choose best Italian Japanese Chinese seafood American cuisines offered daily enjoy exquisite champagne brunch weekend  Adding buffet decadence new unlimited drink option $12 99 per person bottomless Margaritas Bloody Marys sparkling wine beer quite nice      Dinner $34 99 Weekend Brunch $29 99 Brunch Unlimited Champagne $42 98 Holidays Buffet Chef's Table Gourmet Dinner $64 99     dessert selection also quite awesome  Sushi station weak but carved meat stations Italian station it     $14 LESS Bacchanal Buffet Caesars Palace but honestly much indulge before slip back your bikini pool party? don't want look 5 months pregnant you?     If you're M Life member Gold Platinum Noir into separate line bad all use your Express Comp here! <EOR> Everyone comes buffet because think cant wrong Bellagio! Think again buster!!! place nothing but average  only thing maybe let lift eye spicy tuna handroll  roast beef bad same shrimp cocktail but aren't served every buffet strip?  The food nothing special  shitload breads pizzas pastas mashed potatoes type stuff  Honestly food stuff find your typical pizza joint olive garden   So unless just want bite eat wouldn't expecting good food  I'd say wynn mandalay bay buffets slightly better nicer  <EOR> I heard many good things buffets Las Vegas  when just evening decided try Bellagio  read many good things it   It Friday evening expecting worst when comes wait time  However wait wasn't terrible  waited approximately 30 minutes  paying $42 weekend dinner you're placed short line wait available table  Drinks included price   There extensive selection food available Buffet Bellagio  mainly lined king crab legs  plenty everyone lined up  chefs also heat your crab legs if don't cold crab legs  tried some other items such beef roast sushi pastas however nothing really stood out  While looking around extensive dessert selections surprised find Paris brest  tasted just expected   Overall bad place dinner if want stuff yourself silly  food good something everyone  <EOR> I buffet friend lot rewards points some kind vip club status able front line let say if waited crazy long line would super pissed main reasons am dropping review 2 stars   If long line price would reasonable might given 4 stars because buffet food quality choice good amazing but good   atmosphere nice good decor service par but price long line     Meh better choices Vegas <EOR> I really hopeful buffet here  decent selection but comes short why pay good lump sum per person average tasting breakfast buffet?  The stuff just basics honey baked ham eggs sausages biscuit gravy cheeses pancakes  Nothing fancy here    JUST AVERAGE BASIC BREAKFAST but yet pay lots loot when didn't eat much just two plates    The highlights champagne mimosa dang! server hooked! coffee awesome! sure kind but house coffee off hook well  drinks full buffet itself   We sitting next group middle aged guys Super Bowl weekend day  funny guys all jacked weekend kinda reminds Al Bundy NO MA'AM cronies enjoying weekend away wives Lol   I recommend coming if  win extra cash Bellagio's casino if feel don't want anywhere else  Overall average breakfast buffet during morning but great servers  <EOR> This favorite buffet eat when am Vegas  trip breakfast dinner here  selection great food taste great    Coming Hawaii surprised see ahi poke great but pretty good  Prime rib crab legs expected good is  But variety cuisines could here    The service servers bussers good  drinks always full plates always taken away  lines pretty long throughout day dinner time wait could 1 hour    Tip join mlife least Pearl level  Skip general line  <EOR> I only speak brunch buffet  food decent but average quality  service good bring drinks remove plates etc      price I'd goto Cafe Bellagio     <EOR> I coming buffet tail end Sunday brunch right when dinner options come out   Why?  Because still capitalize mimosas eggs benedict bacon STILL dinner options   win win really   overall dessert bar better Wynn but don't gelato bar fail   <EOR> 3 5 stars   dinner line super long but if you're MLife member Level 3 higher bypass line straight front  The brochure incorrectly states all MLife members levels 1 5 this  Service good   The seafood selection excellent fresh plenty variety   Really great   meat section also good but less varietal   Plenty pizza grains too   sushi sashimi poke selection small   Limited fresh fruit salad options   Desserts looked beautiful but soon realize they're all basically same kind desserts various cheesecakes tiramisu brownies fro yo etc   Most which tasted regular supermarket fare  <EOR> I feel being review #796 bit overkill but heck   Part reason why suckered brunch fact many reviews   Maybe helping sucker someone else   I'm hoping fact weekend explains mediocre food   Yes large selection but truly impressed any it   also asked glass champagne since its included $19 95 weekday buffet only warned waitress glass champagne $10!!  $10?!?  kidding me?  Don't worry   if want add splash OJ mimosa its $15!!  thanked waitress heads stuck diet coke   The service far best part buffet   waitress right pick dirty plates fill sodas   Don't worry still stuffed myself silly money's worth but next time heading over Mirage Cravings Buffet   ate couple years ago remember being much more impressed  <EOR> Seriously going all Vegas Buffets?  Almost all them gone downhill   Needless say Bellagio's buffet good used be   $60 per person doesn't even equate good value compared eating some finer dining establishments  But buffet still better ones around terms quality freshness   more more buffets over top Bellagio's seems bit outdated   just wary fact prices jump depending day season   Normally should $30 but double dinner when went   still good selection carving stations always decent roasted chicken turkey breast prime rib   Decent place but no longer someplace would way visit  <EOR> Vegas buffets! When Vegas visit least one  However very disappointed Bellagio buffet  very very expensive didn't feel getting money's worth  Most food just OK prime rib dry chewy  guess expecting better run mill buffets but just any buffet mass produced food sitting under heat lamps  price would never back  <EOR> This buffet gets 3 5 stars me  came lunch buffet  first time ever trying infamous Las Vegas buffets admit didn't live all its hype  pretty disappointed overall quality food service   Food kind bummed find didn't nigiri sushi pictured advertised  prime rib mashed potatoes good  soups delicious also but somehow whole experience kind let down   Note does cost extra alcohol  all drink option timed  service becomes very slow your first few drinks  don't expect want take advantage all drink special just bought   Hmm weird   I'm saying won't ever back because wasn't awful but definitely better choices there  <EOR> If want best King Crab you'll ever eat conveniently split half don't need deal mess crab miss Buffet   Go Sunday brunch they've everything even sushi bar  sushi chefs whatever want just ask  Everything buffet delicious desserts endless   Great prime rib even Venison  <EOR> I came back dinner Tuesday line control   we probably waiting good hour  However some reason Bellagio bartenders love once again friend pulled line asked if wanted sit bar  If someone asks if ever want sit bar IT  wear heels  reason bartender gave when asked she picks people line   I 3 rounds meat sushi crab dessert fully stuffed  Kobe beef great prime rib  little impartial lamb think mother best lamb ever but still decent  crab legs ok although necessarily fan chilled crab legs  couldn't find any butter save life course once done eating guy next sat down big ass bowl melted butter  course   The desserts delightful couple white chocolate cones chocolate cake peanut butter stuff key lime tart  can't eat cheesecake but looked good well   The price good high line buffet no complaints there  definitely no shortage food  raise earlier review star but would recommend going lunch dinner instead breakfast   breakfast isn't really worth opinion  Then again biggest fan breakfast  <EOR> Mussels sea bass sashimi really good  Unfortunately dessert really disaster  made mistake going during holiday season  line 3 hrs lunch then ended dinner  price high 48+tax overpriced  <EOR> 3pm Nevada time 5pm according Wisconsin body $19 95 lunch dinner me    would try find something nit pick but simply astounding value $19 95   seared flank steak thinly sliced carving station phenomenal  ideal cut meat   Unexpected favorites included creamy herbed polenta super tasty pesto mashed potatoes   rotini bolognese sauce classic bolognese flavor  just another meat sauce   raw tuna nicoise sald great    Incredible dessert selection   Tasteful furnishings sat nicely marbled bar  nice option constant drink refills glance away  might seated quicker if volunteer sit there!   <EOR> Bottomless mimosas omelet station sugar free desserts?!?! Amazing   NO SALSA!?!?! Toto guess aren't Texas anymore  <EOR> My family group 4 waited little over hour try buffet  use groupon eat buffet Planet Hollywood but since ate numerous times before wanted try something new all decided check Bellagio's  disappointment food alright  nothing memorable find myself struggling again  dessert bar probably best part me   I'm most likely coming back but feel free try yourself! Maybe food work you  family ended regretting using groupon end wait definitely worth it  <EOR> Most food really good gave four stars because sushi good fried rice bad regret putting mouth couple other items  opinion green beans red peppers tasted good seconds most deserts rich overall enjoyed would back the mini jelly excellent brisket tender tasted great chicken dry  <EOR> We Sunday Brunch added All Drink option  large variety food salad bar carving station sushi bar pasta bar pizza bar everything breakfast        * Prime Rib delicious ask cooked your liking         Bartenders Servers Jimmy William awesome!! quick All Drink turn around time  service care gave impeccable        definitely being going back soon  Probably Thanksgiving Brunch  <EOR> Came Vegas last Sunday thought would try buffet bellagio because all great reviews    We came lunch real long line but surprise moved pretty quickly  Little pricier remember past but thought whatever everything now days  seated  Waiter nice very attentive  Refills quick plates gone quick    Food decent book  Honestly nothing worth price paid but hey vegas right?    Sushi soso tasted if sat around day so   Breakfast honestly can't wrong it Italian pasta didn't much taste  throw alot parmesian it   Desserts pretty good cant complain there    Overall would probably come back if wife made but honestly think better buffets  <EOR> Don't bother while crab legs on  don't care if only tell crab shells hair clothes everywhere else  Just leave promise stab eye shell cracker    On occasion try little bit little bit but fill seafood over anything else  Can't complain rest menu but don't really partake much either    Good eats quality food competitive pricing especially when compared other buffets down strip  <EOR> Had lunch other day ok  worth $22 price tag imo but comp free fine   I high expectations because reviews fact Bellagio maybe just expected much    Break down Mashed potatoes gravy delicious lol Salmon good  Fried rice very dried and right start lunch Sliders very rare  Potato salad super strong mustard seed seasonings not thing Pizza fine  Cheesecake desserts yummy  Pumpkin pie not  To didn't seem much better $10 $12 buffet but paying twice amount  think Caesars buffet thousand times better same price range  wouldn't again unless comp  <EOR> The desserts amazing! Having said lunch yesterday pretty disappointed rest food  Most things somewhere between mediocre bad  buffets usually expect food mediocre good    But said desserts really really good  tried many different ones none them overly sweet  favorite buffet terms dessert   They did few other good things too  thin crust pizzas shrimp cocktail already peeled! pesto infused mashed potatoes amazing idea mixed salads all pretty good   If you're really into sweets would recommend place even if rest buffet good yes dessert good   If want good non sweet food though would somewhere else  <EOR> I came try buffet since heard lot  featured Food Network bests Vegas   19 95 would rather  WYNN Buffet  weren't alot choices food great  giving place 3 stars because awesome sliders had   desserts weren't very many    tip Wynn instead  <EOR> We dined before could wait return visit  But difference few years makes   Alot buffets paid but exception here  The servers actually rude experienced any other restaurant Vegas  On occasion short woman shouting across restaurant above customer's heads other employees  She appeared supervisor  quite spectacle everyone section restaurant slowed down eating watch  inappropriate   After she left area waited until server walked asked if she floor manager  He said he didn't know talking about  described she shortest employee   But he acted he didn't know she was  obvious she probably boss he covering her  The ambience place gone down hill even though price gone up  eat again  strip full higher quality buffets  <EOR> One best town  Great food lot choose from  really liked dishes other restaurants inside Bellagio  only downfall no Beverage service anymore    why    ?

Rather disappointing  <EOR> Went buffet during transition breakfast lunch  breakfast selection same other buffets but quality second none  lunch selection versatile your own sushi station great touch  wish would saved room try high end deserts  All buffet employees friendly helpful  <EOR> This best buffet Vegas   Relatively long lines maybe more pricey most all but end worth during your stay Vegas   Both lunch dinner buffet very good   Stick would higher priced meats fish can't wrong   Just pace yourself   only downside applies most places Vegas desserts tasteless   Hotels Vegas use magic trick into thinking desserts first class   Don't fooled   end cares eat higher end meat cuts enjoy  <EOR> At $40 per person hoping more Bellagio's buffet   After waiting nearly hour seated finally brought small table right near sushi buffet   selection food enormous you'd hard pressed find something enjoy   Highlights just watching people load crab legs shrimp cocktail the smart buffet diners    talking PILES stuff   It impossible try everything but able good sampling various cuisines   Nothing really stood out   sushi nothing write home but guess  no surprise seeing buffet   some decent pasta dishes my weakness nice selection meats including lamb prime rib   basically find everything which translates everything just being average   Our server quite friendly though he kept drinks filled table cleared   Though buffets fun eating just can't justify $40 price tag here  <EOR> So many choices choose from  High quality fish  much sushi  heaven    One gripe kobe beef perfect  Tender pink   husband's kobe beef looked terrible   iver cooked   He didnt finish it  looked if cooked not good thing prices if restaurants strip woukd eat buffet any day  Everyone enough eat dessert under 100   If debating buffets would say easily toss between Bellagio Wynn  food equal but Wynns décor may bit less stuffy <EOR> I use love buffet but last visit wasn't impressed  Crab legs thin prime rib dry desserts bland fell apart  knows off night maybe? still place but dropped top 5 Vegas buffets instead top 3  Step your game Bellagio buffet! <EOR> I love Wynn buffet just much love but Bellagio buffet gets 5th star due VARIETY!

There's literally nothing vegetarian eat except fruit salad  Even waffles pancakes animal products them    As vegetarian ate salad bar which decent deserving 2nd star  miso soup disgusting boyfriend said pancakes gross  $12 99 unlimited mimosas bloody Mary's margaritas  Keep mind alcohol use cheap leave feeling hot after  orange juice used tasted minute maid  food doesn't seem quality either    We pretty decent service except lady fruit bar couldn't seem understand wanted mixed berries despite fact told 4 times    I wouldn't recommend all  $20 per person better spent utilizing room service going actual restaurant  <EOR> The best brunch Vegas  food diverse omelets pizza roast beef green curie duck etc  VERY reasonably priced don't let Bellagio scare off     service little slow wait but line moves fast worth wait  <EOR> Loved eating too!

The best fresh french toast pancakes  Absolutely amazing warm fluffy  Big vat bread pudding? Always huge plus  Two different kinds breakfast potatos? All delicious  Tons different breakfast pastries myriad muffins a very good cinnamon bun danishes? Check! Maybe carbo loaded much? did lotsa beautiful fruits though!  By time lunch came around tuckered nothing really spoke me  However tried fresh pizza great! Desserts super disappointing because none them tasted fresh  even cute little shapes could sway which sad   They lot cold vegetarian options which great some warm veggies but nothing sensational  didn't try looked Pad Thai because looked little forced me    Maybe ambiance little dumpy layout bit chaotic  promise try again Bellagio Buffet  Someday! <EOR> This place made fatties God knows why decided before XS but trying reaaaally hard eat much wouldn't look stuffed sausage club  Impossible  EVERYTHING all tastes marvelous    When first told would paying $40 buffet adamant going somewhere else but worth it  waited long line once phew   at least dress wasn't tight    Besides tasting good food presented beautifully  pretty food definitely back next Vegas trip  <EOR> We all know buffet reviews inconsistent depending multitude factors  everyone eats same time everyone waits long line everyone pays same price everyone eats same thing everyone same tastes food   And everyone tasted ostrich before  Strangely way prepared cooked tasted just chashu BBQ pork  pretty tasty but couldn't help but mental image ostrich head buried ground    I'm biggest fan prime rib but loved here  tender juicy super flavorful  Put some baby mushrooms au jus sauce top coming back more  Even when stomach explode   The crab legs? always apprehensive because epitome inconsistency buffets  could still semi frozen entirely thawed could salty could some funky fishy flavor could skimpy size meat  during recent visit everything spot on   Other favorites include chilean seabass salmon braised beef  Nothing tried overcooked bland  When came time dessert didn't hold back  favorites would creme brulee flan mousse apricot chocolate covered strawberries    Surprisingly line around 5 30pm Saturday night very long  only left around 7pm snaked around casino floor  thought quality quantity food ate $35 per person bargain  far better Wynn buffet last visit any other buffet Strip matter  IMHO   Of course let's hope things good next visit  Because there's worse feeling paying good money bad food  knows maybe just lucky time around  Sometimes just hit jackpot buffet eating experiences  <EOR> Took adult children celebrate birthdays Vegas weekend anticipated highlights Easter brunch Bellagio    Well anticipation quickly started dwindling when wait line hour   Then more upon entering taking look selection    Easter brunch price selections mediocre best   prime rib no flavor crab legs only served iced very little meat some impossible into no utensils task available   also no melted butter available them    taste most food if low end buffet layout buffet made no sense move while your food cold   desert selection fine    very very disappointed wished would chosen different buffet start   assumed am sure others did well being Bellagio would amazing!  fade that    much charge little effort should made  <EOR> At almost $50 buffet I'd expected much better selection  pastas chinese salads okay  sushi bad  30 desserts enticing but didn't deliver  vegetarian sure saw money's worth stomach satisfaction   <EOR> Waited line 30 mins Sunday around 2 00PM  All eat crab legs champagne prime rib salmon worth $50!

While some seafood options I super happy bagel lox fruit offerings rest food options didn't quite lived visual appeal each dish even overall buffet  surprisingly Asian food offerings abysmal chilaquiles more minimal effort breakfast nachos lmao some savory dishes didn't seem sense during breakfast time at least imo anyway   poached salmon stir fried eggplant anyone?    It's while since ate 4 5 years but clearly see decline quality but increase price  breakfast definitely worth even during non holidays weekdays  looking lunch dinner prices don't think it'll much better either  <EOR> we came Sunday fell line 1 o'clock took 1 half hours eat   really excited because really buffets but LOVE vegas buffets   Pork Belly delicious!

Also more enough  2 carving stations 4 items  Lamb prime rib ham turkey  Pastas sushi shrimp crab legs days  polenta favorites which really enjoyed  Deserts also plentiful  People act need fucken 20 decisions when know can't fit much shit your stomach    After sitting down first round food section server kindly took drinks rushed back them  Very attentive hard find that  Overall food good service great wait time short more selection needed  Recommend? Yeah definitely good buffets beautiful decor simplicity food items while executed well good flavors    Why 4 stars? anticipated food item really overcooked  Prime rib  wasnt much overcooked seemed rushed  medium plate become well done dry time hit table  Other great buffet stop by  <EOR> I always dined buffet many occasions every time come Vegas   many ethnic variety offerings food Buffet Chilean seabass occasional game meat bison poke salmon tuna  Price per person steadily increased but does most everything Vegas   nicest thing enjoy botanical garden Bellagio Resort before eating Buffet   Don't forget save room desserts here better offerings fruit tart chocolate mousse cake seasonal display pastries  <EOR> I would give buffet 3 4 stars depending when eat it  If primetime busy holiday prices buffet up  would say most time would rate buffet 4 stars usually happy overall experience   It buffet but food usually high quality don't think ever disappointed food itself  Just sometimes prices little high   Good enough come back again sometimes crave whenever buffet craving  <EOR> Good variety quality   Unfortunately ran lamb chops early night    Also don't king crab legs anymore <EOR> From everything heard Buffet Bellagio gold standard buffets Vegas all other buffets trying Bellagio doing  But experience buffet Bellagio just OK   We staying Bellagio ended eating buffet twice  Once breakfast  I'd say actually better breakfast  price cheaper there's more enough everything could possibly want  following day around 2pm wasn't good  sort transitioning between brunch dinner just good  No seafood? No crab legs  Just meh  guess come dinner better spread   As far layout more impressed buffet Wynn Caesar's palace  Check early morning meal but otherwise worth going your way for  <EOR> This place incredible  Food every palate decadent  ate lunch Wednesday hungry again until lunch next day  only problem place hard choose which food try because much choice  But  really problem give 5 stars! <EOR> I came sunday brunch  desserts lead on   It Monet  looked delicious far away but close just mess  didn't taste good    But did PRIME RIB brunch! OH MAN damn good  ate tons prime rib bacon brunch  Chinese food looked iffy stay away that  But breakfast items good spicy tuna handrolls also decent  They're also pretty damn spicy    Top off $5 bottomless Mimosas  MMMM MMMMMMM MMMMMMMM <EOR> *3 5 stars*  My DB wanted last hit Vegas trip Bellagio Buffet brunch  prepared pay something $16 99 but guess Labor Day special also Saturday per head cost $29 99 without champagne   little sticker shocked   line quarter 11A hardly wait thank god!   While being seated remember thinking hell am going eat $29 99 worth breakfast items?! Well thank god prime rib cuz DARN DELICIOUS! really don't expect prime rib yummilicious buffet but really really impressed!! portion cut  very generous looked little surprised when carver said enough? Let's just say back seconds   If room belly would've gone back more    thought sushi good fresh nothing special just california roll types   I did notice weren't many vegetable options    wish more veggie roasted veggies prime rib   less half star that     I would've given Bellagio Brunch Buffet  5 stars but little disappointed desserts believe took plate each except chocolate cake!   cheesecake key lime pie soft if sitting long  them little solid but rock hard definitely mushy   mention sad didn't any chocolate chip cookies without nuts   boooo could've used too! only dessert liked some puff pastry wafer  thingy creme     So  why I'd give them 3 5 stars  1 star desserts less 1 2 lack yummy grilled  veggies  Did just miss them? wonder Forgot give props waitress she bomb!! wish took name  She it   even when she knew dessert time when back seat she poured hot cup coffee me  <EOR> Wow! best tasting largest most impressive buffet ever eaten  many choices many high end foods does usually find buffet prime rib crab legs premium cheeses variety veg even grilled  many things eat cannot even sample bit everything  Elegantly displayed chocolate carvings such  Negatives bit pricey long lines irritating VIP service where other patrons allowed cut line ahead those waited longer  Rude off putting  I'd expect more resort would never feel comfortable taking advantage others using VIP service  <EOR> +1 Star LOTS FOOOOOOOOD! crabs shrimp etc etc     +1 Star Spacious big! +1 Star DESSERT BAR   OMG +1 Star Definitely must taste if you're awesome area surrounded many place see spots  1 Star Long wait if your time Vegas limited   don't waste it! <EOR> WOW!!! Awesome variety food when buffet much variety expect so so tasting food being specialize particular item    Well ALL food AMAZING!!!! no regrets coming here   no idea where but seeing pictures helped choose place  Wait long but well worth it  <EOR> For $30 person dinner really can't those prices amount food selection offer  early wait long <EOR> Service ia horrible   Food quality tastes very good but Coffee! don't try drink   No looking around care u  before  Server coming asking coffee milk hot water also controlling quality coffee   Now changed   Buffet concept most important signature 5 star Vegas Hotels Bellagio below average unfotunately <EOR>
