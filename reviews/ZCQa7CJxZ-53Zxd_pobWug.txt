I must mention fried eggs second day served over pork cakes   Very delicious but did care potatoes   My overall opinion back nor would recommend friend going Vegas  <EOR> Beautiful setting! sat patio right middle hotel  feels we're sitting outside Paris when we're really Vegas  food ok  chicken noodle soup way salty totally sent back  French onion good  salmon ok wasn't flavored like  grilled steak good cooked liked it  mashed potatoes really good  service friendly didn't come lot but made sure waters refilled empty plates taken away  Super convenient if you're staying hotel  <EOR> This place should called Le Cafe lle Bad Service  Never life treated horribly restaurant  family lunch 1 afternoon  no line inside empty except 3 other families  seated immediately    Ten minutes being seated busboy asked we'd drink  He barely understood orders ran around headless chicken then disappeared into kitchen  told waitress over very soon take orders  guess twenty minutes considered very soon because  long took    After taking orders waited ten more minutes until iced tea arrived  parents' brother's drinks nowhere sight  complaining manager horrible service informing felt neglected he simply smirked replied assure you're being neglected  Yeah REALLY assured us   I noticed no waiters sight three families seated before still did drinks food  family complained manager left  Finally rest drinks food arrived we seated little over hour now   food alright DEFINITELY worth wait all wasn't even hot    My soup came without spoon asked waitress one she said she bring right away  Five minutes later she came table check no spoon sight  Again asked spoon she one she came back without spoon once more! asked final time total 10 minutes getting  spoon personally walked utility station took spoon  Ridiculous!   DON'T EAT HERE place does deserve your business all! probably fifth time eaten past four years each time service seemed exponentially worse  totally unacceptable especially Las Vegas where restaurants extremely competitive  <EOR> My plans needed change  Wanted steak birthday but dinner plans took show instead  left lunch elusive birthday steak    Read menu cafe Paris Hotel looked good   Ordered Steak Frites nice flat steak french fries bearnaise bordelaise sauce accompaniment  Also ordered mixed green salad      The service good attentive efficient  bread came rather late nearly frozen butter but worked around faux pas   The salad really good   The steak tougher side but cooked perfection  looked top sirloin but semi sliced before cooking give pattern top  okay but I'd hoped for  sauces came weak flavorless  salt pepper both them just some taste steak  bearnaise sauce weakest classical version  bordelaise needed salt most but closest you'd expect classic French reduction sauce but tasted jarred mass produced   not pan steak made in   Overall experience okay nothing write home about  many other Vegas options can't see myself ever returning  would recommend place only if hungry currently Paris Hotel don't mind casino right eat  worth special trip for  <EOR> The setting indoor outdoor trickery beautiful  service adequate  food edible but nothing more only breakfast   VERY overpriced  Costs almost much breakfast Cafe Bellagio which quite good   <EOR> My husband 3 course set dinner last night  bit worried because some bad reviews  But still gave shot try food turned delicious us  French onion soup appetizer then prime rib entree  chose chocolate layered cake dessert  liked all them    The onion soup tasted really good liked don't put much black pepper or probably none over power taste onion  But if black pepper then probably won't though liked it  prime rib good came good size said 12 oz think too  would even better if fresh horseradish but satisfied enough quality prime rib though only creamed horseradish  choose 2 sides entree  chose Yukon whipped potato French fries while husband chose baked potato creamed spinach  liked Yukon whipped potato lot  French fries over burned though  didn't big deal because pretty enough eat already  husband thought sides okay bad but wow either  Both rib eyes came correct doneness asked for  end when dessert came liked layered chocolate cake lot too  think pretty safe set dinner  don't know would if order items off regular menu   If back future probably set dinner again because good priced portion just right  <EOR> As Las Vegas resident generally avoid restaurants Las Vegas strip both because local restaurants often offer better value because traffic hassle  However needed meet relatives staying Paris just experienced 6 hour delayed flight  seemed only courteous meet them where staying all travelling done    We made reservation seven people 7 45pm Friday night but apparently real busy Friday night  arrived three parties thankfully seated arrived  ate inside rather outside near casino floor  thankfully quiet place where could all hear each other  next plus bread served good chewy bread rolls unfortunately freshly baked good bread often served Las Vegas   Three peppercorn steak  rated 8 10 thought sauce could more subtle third person liked sauce  French dip declared excellent  Two duck la orange thought duck lean another liked it  person ordered beef wine sauce liked person ordered omlette said okay  Service good never need catch waiter's eye    With ordering appetizer no rushing through dinner meal lasted hour quarter  when together relatives town meal should leisurely occasion  see speed service constant source debate Las Vegas dining  Some people want quickly others myself resent waiter asking still working sir? restaurant served its purpose well nice quiet place leisurely family meal no rushing reasonably good food excellent service  <EOR> Amazing!

Someone knows getting anything special wants basic meal slightly elevated price location conveniently nearby   Don't expect love nor hate it  <EOR> Food so so  Service so so  Location noisy but then again Paris Hotel Vegas   Would recommend it? If can't into another place yes  Otherwise nothing special really  <EOR> Very disappointing try anywhere else Paris better dining experience  Even buffet better  Perhaps outdoor setting should hint scale back expectations but given price point location expected better service quality    Menu limited dining options especially if aren't breakfast  Can't remember specifically mediocre  dining area practically casino floor itself which noisy smoky experience    Service ridiculously slow considering weren't busy  Food hot when came barely passed warm  Server attentive cups did refilled bill seemed twice high experience warranted  would rather hit buffet grab and go pizza spots  <EOR> Not bad other reviews  ordered tuna sandwich read all negative reviews steak  Tuna juicy enough tasty good  However don't chicken noodle soup because way salty    <EOR> Gross  Don't eat here  best thing water    We ordered calamari which tasted chewy fries  Completely over cooked    Our entrée rotisserie chicken came fingerling potatoes spinach mushrooms  Chicken flavored good but skin tough chewy  Costco better rotisserie chicken  Boyfriend ordered Paris burger came fries weird sour sauce  Burger no flavor seasonings  fries where probably best thing plate   After paying server assumed change take without asking if needed change back  Wtf! now ask change  Service wasn't even great! <EOR> The food good service horrible wait 15 20 mins table      cafe empty  don't it  staff very rude incompetent    Blueberry Hill next time  <EOR> The food good nice atmosphere but service bad   No entrance greet seat when seat no came table   No water no bread no waiter    When waiter came he very nice but process slow  Long wait between bread meal  No notice finished eating  entire experience tainted  bad  <EOR> Only breakfast its actually bad   Ordered scramble grilled veggies toast  Also cup cappuccino  little snafu cup cappuccino found red plastic ring cup  waiter quickly gave new cup  Other bad  would come back  sure ask seated outside  <EOR> Fantastic corned beef hash bacon   loved sit patio some great people watching! <EOR> This place le sucks ! long wait line happy seated pleasant spot outside    waitress assistant helping table which seemed cause some confusuion  took 10 minutes first drink  forgot husbands  He eaten whole basket bread harrassed 2 servers 3 times some water  drink he ordered  When Jaime female server finally brought drink she told husband guess just know ask it  Amazing  sat waited good 45 minutes lunch watching tables around getting pissed food times trying  water glasses refilled  Never again  <EOR> Lovely restaurant tasty food gracious service   throughly enjoyed bread before dinner delicious salads  Fairly classic American food charming French cafe setting  <EOR> I feel place meant gambleholics just want quick bite return gambling immediately    All food ordered horrible  can't comprehend food quality could Vegas    Service terrible  does seem under staffed  wait outside long    MORE wait table being seated    LONGER wait ordered  time food came full stuffing much bread which wasn't any thing extraordinary just hungry waiting Last visit second time due friends wanted would also last visit   Don't come here  <EOR> Staying Paris Las Vegas nice hotel line buffet 40 min  wait 8 p m  granddaughter decided eat last night  We walked through empty should left! dining room space overlooking on casino floor  waited   and waited   finally water  No waiter should left gone very busy noodle house   Finally ordered  onion soup  too salty tasted 'mix'!

I can't wait until try other food there! <EOR> I stayed Paris over weekend upon checking getting situated wanted first place could find order chow down popped radar  I've read some reviews less then friendly all say don't eat considered bad take your rage yourself lack judgement here!  They special 3 course meal choose $40 which thought logically made sense  It began french onion soup which did come hot contrary review saying lukewarm actually better ones had  Not salty didn't smell funky either  I filet mignon medium rare main course  It actually perfect cut meat cooked should but flae being under seasoned  I did some sautéed mushrooms onions mac n cheese it  there wasn't much special mushrooms but sauce mac n cheese won meal over me  the sauce just flowing bite bite just gave cheesy goodness within each forkful  I did end NY cheesecake  They give HUGE pieces better ones had  It light cream cheese but delivered taste sure!  Long story short really read reviews Yelp your OWN choice things  I mean yeah saw 2 1 1 stars said ummz am making bad decision? Yes each own but when see oh took long food bad rating think isn't Yelp FOOD? If you're grouchy waited long eat don't enjoyable company just should eat bag chips beef jerky gift shop  I thought place rocked give them thumb enjoyable experience! <EOR> I would tend say outside `steakhouse` `gourmet` rooms casinos casino fare usually blah  blah We ordered teh prix fixe steak specials bride filet mignon myself ribeye found food adequate The mashed potatoes seemed most genuine however couldn`t put fingers but mashed fail The cheesecakes desert surprisingly FULL SIZED! pretty good For $39 prix fixe strip felt good value  Would return? perhaps nothing else avail if staying site Waiters ok  Busboy little slow w refill waiter drinks table others <EOR> Didn't plan eat just did due proximity where time   eaten several times previously did dining list November 2011 trip Las Vegas   Anyways escargot starter dish bouef bourguignon entree   Both okay nothing write home about   However escargot seemed over done   left thinking could should serve better food restaurant price range   breakfast place lunch dinner place doesn't quite cut given all choices Las Vegas  <EOR> I recommend coming breakfast  menu over priced terrible food  scrambled eggs bacon wheat toast mother french toast  food luke warm cold wouldn't recommend either  <EOR> Winner winner breakfast eggs sausage dinner?  what's available around Paris offer even somewhat $$ prices you'll pleased know its exactly expect   extravagant only reason come 6am morning reliable breakfast food because A you've partying damn hard barely anything would taste bad point B you've become baller status first grand meal reap your winnings outta good light since drank all those whiskey rocks down during conquest     Therefore sayin its best place eat but 6am breakfast its worth checking if you're nearby  <EOR> Had dinner ordered 3 course prix fixe menu $39  requested foie gras extra $12 rib eye steak Chef accommodated request!

Anyhoo   the burger decent yummy side coleslaw   food no frills but spot wonderfully   friend duck crepe which filled tender duck breast topped creamy sauce  Super tasty!  Coffee piping hot which nice refills plentiful   True IHOP feel comes thermos refill your own   needed lots lots caffeine day thermos actually quite appreciated  P <EOR> Originally dinner reservations Flemings but realized needed change later time  Unfortunately meant 11 00 pm    We staying Paris noticed sign three course meal $39  meal included starter entrée two sides dessert  deal!  What's even better reserve table OpenTable com pay your total rewards points  platinum total rewards member really didn't reservations but why waste passing 100 points?   We scored 9 30 PM reservations seated immediately  seated patio which attempted feel dining alfresco next smoke filled casino  thought dining middle casino annoying but frankly didn't even notice people walking by    It took few minutes someone take drink orders took little while bread well  Service little slow request drinks twice  But since read  reviews yelp wasn't expecting lot fast service    I ordered wedge salad New York steak creamed corn Yukon potatoes berries cream dessert  Stephen wedge salad mixed grill creamed spinach Mac n cheese cheesecake dessert   Food wise pretty good  wasn't same caliber Flemings but $39 could complain   Our first course came within 20 minutes entrées came shortly after  plenty food full took desserts since hotel room refrigerator   Overall decent experience must say pretty pleased decent service  Aside asking waiter drinks twice could find lot fault place   guess couldn't find any fault because food comped since use total rewards points pay everything    I'd come back but only if paid comp points  <EOR> This ok place eat if staying Paris just want something eat  There's really nothing spectacular place but just decent food if don't want leave your hotel  Definitely somewhere would come searching eat though  <EOR> Wow!  Found deal here  $39 preset menu  appetizer main course two sides dessert  Thought portion going small but nope big  Couldn't finish prime beef  cheesecake big too!!  all tasted good  <EOR> Oh dear many awful reviews place has  always pretty good time when come  think breakfast usually best place come  Last time came lunch boyfriend half soup sandwich special  soup chose chicken noodle soup which could tell really fresh shredded pieces chicken salty  sandwich chose tuna salad okay it just lacked bit flavor    I think really coming cafe outside patio  quite pretty somewhat romantic   <EOR> We've gone few times each time just dessert   The place cute you're feeling you're truly Paris well never but Europe many times relate     The best thing desert itself  flour less chocolate cake OMG die for!!!! also tried apple strudel past excellent!  The service very good servers all male old times European restaurants very polite knowledgeable menu items    Next time we're going back dinner I'd really taste food  menu $16 fillet mignon! <EOR> $5 small mediocre espresso  Service wasn't exactly friendliest  experience mediocre enough can't really think anything else say beyond this  better options inside Bellagio  <EOR> Sat patio ordered espresso took forever tasted burnt  Ordered creme brûlée which never arrived   Service really bad <EOR> The food good here  staff friendly! woman front little rude said 20 minute wait first come first serve status  waited 15 minutes until sat outside  ton tables which didn't sense  bread morning great warm woman served very nice  dinner however bread hard barely warm  Asian waiter slow beginning until stared waiting order over 15 minutes  Every time he asked question answered point when he would fill glasses he would slam cups down table hard  barely eating food he asked if wanted dessert lol  Overall give place 4 stars because good food <EOR> We pretty excited french breakfast Saturday morning while staying Bellagio just front Paris    Alas surprise good one     The wait short good point    but waiter took 20 minutes come ask wanted   Then saw eggs benedict table next us   looked each other same time english muffin totally burned!  Shortly owner plate asked more hollandaise sauce barely any   Then came espresso    well  ordered   some instantaneous coffee instead   asked if machine broken said no   then asked exchanged regular coffee   bad but least didn't pay $5 50 double espresso   Then much later came greasy toast fake butter rest order   If french experience just forget it   place should avoided any price   As nice alternative your croissants pains au chocolat next door Lenotre which nice patisserie nice coffee pastries   Enjoy your trip Vegas!  P <EOR> Just bought cappuccino to go expensive  costs over $5 very small cup wasn't even full  <EOR> Was wandering around place eat stopped when saw special $39 1 soup salad 2 prime rib steak entree w 2 sides 3 dessert  Didn't think yelp reviews wouid low such place I should figured many empty tables though   But still place  line forming outside entrance even though many empty tables I thought reserved time   But guess just taking time seating people   I special tried French Onion Soup    which bit salty and nothing special   entree opt steak forgot cut though   Steak pretty tender  flavor but marbled enough  requested creamed spinach mac cheese sides  kitchen screwed gave creamed corn instead mac cheese  But didn't complain because best creamed corn had  always though Lawry's Beverly Hills made best creamed corn    but more! glad screwed order! creamed spinach just whatevers  figured few days pigging Vegas    should put some dark green veggies which why picked instead fries   My boyfriend ordered foie gras caramelized apples burger which tried piece of  place didn't right find nothing fancy foie gras it first time trying   dessert took chocolate cake because full eat restaurant  Heck full eat all until next morning  But   cake still really moist next morning  regret eating night before lol  thing really worth mentioning waiter Jose  He probably nicest waiter ever had! Kitchen service needs improvement though  felt forever waiting food restaurant wasn't packed  need pay attention people's orders  might liked fact gave creamed corn instead but might always way  Overall think decent place food  Would better if faster  <EOR> Amazing  perfect  can't believe someone said place cafeteria food! food great ingredients all really fresh tasty but perhaps depends order  party eight all lunch    sandwiches burgers salads  everyone super happy  vibe nice clean lighting bright super heart gorgeous blue water glasses  Only negative point keno girl didn't come table think she should thus fired preventing becoming millionaire  <EOR> My first meal lunch brother sister in law   wasn't expecting much but pleasantly surprised   SIL corned beef Reuben sandwich verdict good   Brother Fruits de Mer sandwich open faced sandwich seafood melted butter melted cheese excellent!  Parisienne smoky ham not watery junk sell supermarket Swiss cheese very crusty chewy bread very good   My next meal breakfast   tried pancakes probably best choice French themed restaurant   average  <EOR> I excellent time cafe Paris hotel  Sal very accommodating  heel hurting asked if he bandaid which he returned 6 bandaids  mojitos also delicious food excellent  friend great time  must again next trip Vegas! <EOR> Vegas think done you   first visit bit obnoxious fake me   However upon further visits lured bit   Great deals hotels hundreds dollars blackjack winnings good food?  sold   Last time bared your teeth took blackjack money   started see really really wanting continue relationship   time visiting ex   town figured I'd introduce friends even though mentally pretty much done you   visit only clinched me   zero love Vegas anymore   strip completely devoid culture anything want actually put money into   Paris hotel perfect example that   Ugh   always check Yelp before going somewhere town   Why didn't time?  I work trip Vegas staying airport taking two first time Vegas visiting employees down strip   extremely tired hungry but budget   Yes we're company dime company frugal side   Doesn't leave many options dinner strip   We into place which others mentioned French Denny's   menu pretty darn expensive being diner version Paris restaurants   saw similar prices menu Paris's more upscale Mon Ami Gabi    We all opted $12 99 beef tenderloin crab asparagus topping vegetables potatoes   crab topping neither crab nor K rab   sure except white stringy   steak kind bland but least edible   only spit chewy piece into napkin   think $12 99 cheapest things menu   We ask bread which nothing special   eat some butter meal taste better though   If want cheap steak $10 99 steak lobster basement Binion's   atmosphere similarly Denny's like food only slightly better but least some lobster salad   As think done Vegas   Blech blech blech  <EOR> Ended doing special  39 dollars 4 course meal shabby Vegas   ordered prime rib fries mac n cheese n cheescake  Also spinach salad  everything really french fries mac n cheese    Would come back again <EOR> One favorites places breakfast brunch because Nutella crepes! Also really fingerling potatoes  Service always nice but busy wait could long times <EOR> Avoid if can!  We stopped other day late lunch around 2 30 noticing patio 3 4ths full   Much surprise found line 4 tables deep   Worse yet Diamond Seven Stars VIP line where cut off just anytime before you're seated   told 45 minute wait  which struck inexplicable given only partially full restaurant   Two couples jumped off line front us   cut off two Diamond members still seated 10 minutes   inefficiency process should clue rest experience   The place looks French menu reads French but food neither terribly good nor terribly French   onion soup arrived burned top without soup spoon   broth wasn't bad but really hard eat teaspoon finding anyone took 10 minutes   knew second waitress put down no soup spoon but she off shot before could say anything   The French Dip almost inedible  isn't meat supposed warm lukewarm?  Theirs cold refrigerator   jus wasn't bad   bread nice   fries disgusting cold way many them     The salade frisee dried looking lettuce left kitchen long   By way bill all mediocre food service above including two glasses chardonnay $85 tip   Do here   Find somewhere else   never ever wait half hour eat here  <EOR> Very cute  breakfast 7am  before fly can't really rate based busy time  waiter really nice polite  bread real good  Breakfast yummy too  eggs hashbrowns made well  husband steak eggs meal  made nice juicy    Although place really expensive breakfast  price think you'd knock your socks off type food  Orange juice $4 00 waiter didn't even come back see if husband wanted more  Which leads believe there's no free refills that    I guess say okay if don't mind spending much your breakfast  Vegas though could probably find better cheaper price  <EOR> I little nervous when saw place only 3 stars but worry naught  rotisserie chicken mushrooms sautéed spinach subbing roasted potatoes pommes frites  fries crispy salty   just 'em  chicken super juicy huge could easily split dish  started huge side green salad which blend tasty greens no iceberg  I hate iceberg! topped few perfectly ripened teardrop tomatoes some chopped cucumber  ranch dressing divine did taste bottled  Service good but overbearing  sit inside casino floor noisy! balcony  Would come back? Yes would! <EOR> The service really ridiculous  might well slap aprons honey badgers call them waiters cuz really dont give fuck  food bland expensive  came 2 days row  Each time progressively horrible  management fat fucking asshole  it choice come obligated since  mother in laws choice getting into heated argument waitress being dumb rude bitch decided come back again  <EOR> Best French onion soup years! <EOR> Main case point? $39 menu 3 course dinner?   Headed Strip bit earlier expected show walked Paris Hotel find some good eats birthday  Saw cutesy cafe sign showed options seemed good pass up    I ordered French Onion Soup Prime Rib Mac Cheese Mushrooms Onions chocolate layer cake    While big fan soup French Onion delicious  The Prime Rib perfection although only managed finish half since ate soup fast The Chocolate layer cake big two regular slices regular restaurant moist chocolatey!   Recommending place price service! <EOR> Try chicken waffles! waffles bacon bits it! Customer service okay but chicken waffles must have  <EOR> I great experience came long drive oc checked grabbed late lunch  wait bit long looked around seeing empty tables but maybe servers busy hostess tied something  took while orders tried hold keep patience  ceasar salad calamari pretty good   overpriced but pay experience use your TR card little slight discount earn those RC  <EOR> Disgusting omelette here! ordered chicken mushroom cheddar cheese  chicken tasted old funky  expecting white meat but dark  cheddar cheese overwhelming took entire omelette unappealing fake looking orange color  Cheese favorite food but just much  pick omelette going throw eating all cheese  Having pile orange goop plate during meal made lose appetite quickly    This incredibly overpriced dish $17  never ever return again  family agreed food horrible  Plus cups utensils smelled ass  use hand sanitizer wipe down fork  Please save your money stomach anywhere else  your vacation nothing ruins mood faster crappy meal  <EOR> Regular food  Good waiters but incredibly RUDE management All cliches fancy French restaurant obnoxious captain without any perks    Why would cafe manager treat its guests poorly dumbfounded me  <EOR> The menu looked enticing but end worth price  service terrible food over all mildly decent best   Cobb salad actually pretty gross  free bread definitely highlight  much better choices Vegas  <EOR> If Dennis your waiter you're treat!  A group four lunch great time!  We liked cheese appetizer good selection fresh!  The French Dip magnifique! <EOR> It's hit miss place always stay Paris since comp rooms cafe convenient     The service generally good lunch menu much better breakfast!  absolutely loved chicken soup rich thick creamy delicious   must say chicken salad sandwich nothing special   Also steer clear hashes way large very good   Coffee sodas thumbs up! <EOR> Had very nice breakfast boo Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis  liked best nice change pace Vegas casino buffet type vibe  Almost being european cafe just happens middle large casino   The wait minimal weekday morning server great  boo quiche french toast banana suggestion waiter great but can't remember name sorry man   French toast excellent  Really hit spot  boo very pleased quiche  Pricewise thought breakfast reasonable    I would definitely back  <EOR> We breakfast     experience started bad    but waiter duke resolved matter  scrumptious steak eggs  girlfriend french toast which she really didnt enjoy all    <EOR>
