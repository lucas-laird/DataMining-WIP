Granted Sunday morning but 2 hours later would lunch time  time around wait time quoted 40 minutes which almost exact   chill day waited  All signature rocking chairs porch taken but nice shade mister system could browse general store  When name called proceeded desk seated   The restaurant very busy  lot staff including corporate trainers ensure everyone adhering company's standards  server slow side but horrible  ordered favorite biscuits sawmill gravy delicious smoked sausage patties fried apples also asked some amazing apple butter biscuits     Everything expected other coffee which wasn't

Unless LOVE sitting outside many rocking chairs   Cracker Barrel entry pure chaos!  Even walking into restaurant you're greeted crowd swell people    probably because restaurant itself connected 'old country store'   Which speak Please spend way more money then ever intend to! still 10 minute wait before being seated wandered around country store see goodies could find   Very kitschy but kinda fun just look   However careful because need control traffic TONS other folks walking store mention line people waiting pay food bill!  prepared tight spots   Coming Cracker Barrel weekend almost considered mistake   restaurant busy CROWDED!  Really empty table when dined day   Soon cleaned almost immediately filled next party   being said service little rushed   server brand spankin' new like he started 2 days prior he still trying around menu restaurant service   He answered questions best knowledge confused few times but pretty apologetic it   family ended ordering Sunrise Sampler 2 orders 2 eggs cooked order grits fried apples hashbrown casserole homemade buttermilk biscuits sawmill gravy smoked sausage country ham thick sliced bacon Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast 2 eggs cooked order grits fried apples hashbrown casserole smothered country fried steak  Order took long while nearly 30 minutes!  ordinarily would start throw tiny fit especially breakfast but signed overcrowded place fairly new staff   Thankfully though food arrived still very hot   Fresh @$$ biscuits!!  first thing jumped into damn worth calories!

Finally Cracker Barrel opened Las Vegas  second day opened even though knew would crowded  wait 30 minutes but fun look around store before seated  even found item looking house  service excellent especially since just opened  waiter training but he did good job  gave review less stars because food bad  grites blah  gravy no taste runny  ham overcooked tough could barely cut it  bite leave because didn't want choke  noise level outrageous  BUT again when things calmed down bit  Hopefully kitchen improve  want lunch sometime try famous fried chicken  Hopefully advertised  <EOR> If good old fashioned southern food then Cracker Barrel place you  huge menu big portions great prices friendly service tasty food which pretty much all points restaurant needs great review book   This first time Cracker Barrel all other experience Cracker Barrel's Arizona  pretty much exactly before rocking chairs patio area no outdoor dining just wait shop full country style knick knacks front dining area  also sell some off brand soda's candy   The menu biggest ever seen any restaurant point even huge list side dishes well over 20   Lisa server swear she gave best menu rundown ever heard  She knew everything could answer any question just friendliest servers ever had   Entrees range $8 $12 all southern style  known chicken dumplings chicken fried steak ham among other things  love dinner sampler which comes ham meatloaf chicken dumplings  person loves trying different things meal me! chicken dumplings probably best items named above juicy soaked delicious gravy  ham meatloaf also very good though nothing special   Most dishes come your choice two three sides which mentioned above large variety choose from  Heck even sides only certain days week  fried okra hash brown casserole turnip greens  All sides taste great want back try them all   In addition meals come corn bread muffins biscuits  corn bread savory side prefer sweet corn bread but if saltier probably enjoy it  love biscuits suggest side apple butter them   I've Cracker Barrel's before breakfast great job to  Just huge portions dinner breakfast big to  breakfast sampler ham bacon sausage eggs biscuits grits hash browns gravy around $10  just cant variety size price  also great pancakes French toast if morning sweet tooth   My only real criticism some food little bland side pallet but then again those people loves heavily spiced food largely personal preference issue  also told Cracker Barrel often large wait times though right night came party five   The biggest compliment give Cracker Barrel everything taste home made  reminds grandmother's cooking Arkansas knows southern food  Actually grandmother when came she loved everything it   If want large southern style meal taste came someone's home kitchen then bring your appetite stop here  usually big chain restaurants but Cracker Barrel just get's everything right  look forward coming some comfort food again  <EOR> Meh!! alright first time !   Felt very welcomed but 1 2 pound cheese burger patty wasn't great ! called 1 2 pound bacon cheese burger but patty literally 5 times smaller then bread therefore just ate bread patty very dry ! smashing juice    I'd craving order eat here  Service better then food   <EOR> I'm giving wonderful restaurant 3 stars following reason   wait time Monday night 7 30 nearly hour  once seated took over 30 minutes bring food    I want clarify few things though  restaurant only open 2 weeks  first Cracker Barrel Las Vegas  understanding would busy     When checked said 40 minutes decided wait out   did fact large rocking chairs checkers play deck  could try them actually buy them store! Nice touch The food extremely yummy  But sure worth wait  Good thing trail mix us!   Will back?    Yes!  But maybe wait until newness calms down  <EOR> My girlfriend came week opening around 9 30 10pm wait 50 minutes  ended being around half hour but very surprised busy near closing time! very hot outside but thankfully porch there's few fans  Service pretty good occasionally drinks would empty but server stopped frequently  ordered build your own side platter  remember ordering often when younger decided try out  green beans AWESOME! corn much clearly frozen  French fries good but  hard mess up  Mac Cheese nasty fuzzy texture didn't eat much that  also ordered bowl chicken noodle soup   it yummy   but came barely above lukewarm  girlfriend ordered couple entrees she could sample few things nothing WOW quality taste  Overall disappointing remembered childhood back east  Maybe because import everything desert? Also want mention girlfriend did sick eating here  speculate because food isn't kept high enough temperature  Nothing came hot  Hmm    <EOR> Good home cooking   Fun sides hash brown casserole turnip greens dumplings  fried chicken best!  Service also pretty good <EOR> Wow!

Service sub par although all seem very friendly also very unorganized  First thing ordered before anything biscuits gravy never wasn't charged it  No big deal  Although really craving it   ask three different people straws  Yes straws    Honestly food ok best  wasn't expecting world rocked certainly wasn't   Ambiance nice seems decent family restaurant  huge fireplace middle which feel homey   really feel more 2 5 star but being generous giving 3  back?
