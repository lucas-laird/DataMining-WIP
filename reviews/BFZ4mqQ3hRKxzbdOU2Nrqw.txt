This place closed or moved without forwarding address phone number   very disappointed! <EOR> Thanks fellow Yelpers helping discover place  drove today way bank same time trying figure want eat late lunch  decided give place shot disappointed  ordered Togoshi Ramen     + bowl big am still full + tastes good little bit everything     shrimp squid pork fishcake lots vegetables  + decor simple but cares     just give good food! + some funny 50 60s japanese music playing     kinda liked located ghetto     although why would care unless you're walking  Bottom line best $12 spent lunch week  I back try more stuff  <EOR> Togoshi Ramen only place Las Vegas grub classic Ramen favorites   location little way $10 cab ride strip   gyoza fried chicken delicious! <EOR> This place good solid food  I eaten over years food very consistent  If enjoy simple food ramen fried rice gyoza etc     I think disappointed   Reasonable prices  Tasty ramen fried rice  Good service   Season necessary enjoy      <EOR> I am Las Vegas  friend mine puts towering monument American dream all its gaudy crass tasteless glory   means buffets unbelievably big name restaurants hours upon hours shopping pretty clothes wear night people egos match casinos all amounting insane amount money wasting  where people find fun    It August  don't even want know exact outside temperature is  spent miserable days Vegas before days just fun  need something something reminiscent home comforts teddy bear  then spot it Ramen Restaurant   plain sign plain strip mall behind all casinos but once enter parking lot find quite big presence plaza    The windows glass door completely covered inside but flashing neon open sign invites come in  Vegas? not? Inside pretty large space walls plentifully decorated signs nothing but Japanese written them which positive note me  open kitchen left cashier directly front where waitstaff watch door seating area right    The menu many typical Japanese snack food including croquettes kara age others rice curry dishes mapo dofu Japanese style course nice ramen list simple yet enough everyone find something tastes  chashu ramen significant other mapo ramen    The broth nice clear even mapo ramen which good sign  served right temperature came steaming table remained plenty warm last drop  noodles could bit softer but am also used Korean ramen which much softer noodles just Japanese tend drier rice Koreans know Japanese firmer noodles  But perhaps could cooked just bit more found some noodles sticking each other beginning which good thing  loosened time 2 3 done bowl   For Koreans other people stronger flavors mapo ramen definitely more suited tastes  Very strong presence sesame seed oil pork bits ground pork floating soup caught amidst your noodles making every slurp bit more interesting  chashu ramen much more subtle hearty yet mild however pork slices unfortunately overcooked hence bit dry   But end ate drank all grateful fact such place present desert hell Vegas  last sign satisfied immediately overcome sleepiness only produced good bowl ramen quite content   I would back just mapo ramen perhaps try others afterwards  If ever find myself stranded Vegas horrors yet again place would turn order keep sanity yes find teddy bear   And did mention smoke your ramen?

Because tanmen while extremely popular Japananese ramen shacks isn't found many ramen houses west coast due its similarity Chinese noodle soup    This place represents bowl heaven Las Vegas  truly Japanese comes full hand written Japanese menus wall tourism posters etc  <EOR> I'm sure all fuss about  expected lot more place reading all reviews other people  Maybe just used style ramen perhaps experience ramen places Gardena CA might spoiled taste buds but really didn't find appealing  ordered shio ramen expecting usually Santouka but nothing that  broth clear unlike milky white soup base Santouka  Chashu rather dry unflavorful    Maybe best ramen place find Vegas but just didn't anything me  <EOR>
