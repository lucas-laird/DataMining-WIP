But disappointment absent   I put charge calling Mark Rich's inform them terrible news  man answered seemed already aware mistake asked if wanted delivery person run them back office  Well yes sir why called  He told knots would delivered right away we already paid them anyways  As slowly ate pizza trying save space knots phone rang  Someone pizza place called back offered give credit knots  kind!    Wait  knots still way? No? Oh   Is refund?  A credit future order   Oh   I don't enjoy ordering knots getting them being promised knots being told them later  Why would order them again if didn't first order right? thing if compensation mistake but wasn't case    I almost gave them two stars because pizza pretty good but poor service drives wall  understand mistakes happen but promise renege due laziness any other reason inexcusable  <EOR> There seems abundance good pizza Las Vegas but Mark Rich's pizza comes flavor personality seem home made   Maybe family atmosphere restaurant savory flavors packed into stromboli     perhaps just fresh ingredients put plate    whatever secret food good reasonably priced spot well worth visit  <EOR> The food very good  ranch dressing home made good  portions very  big  service best part  <EOR> The nyc aesthetic magnetic hospitality excellent  felt home place dragged ordered pasta garlic bread delicious  awesome deals families  Wednesday night kids eat free any item kids menu free purchase  Tuesday night buy free  Monday night all eat pasta $8 99  mix match ravioli rapture $12 99+tax garlic bread try Chicken Stromboli to!

Btw  Pizza slice Made order  also gelato pretty decent bar <EOR> This place terrible! Every time order ask myself why continue support such lousy establishment?   Well tonight last time  Never ordered meal thought good  Incorrectly preparing food way ordered seems norm here  putting onions something simple task many people but obviously place  simply threw food garbage because couldn't eat it  No longer settle Mark Rich's solely because close convenient  <EOR> We Sunday  place fairly busy when arrived completely full time food  Ordered fried zucchini marinara large Work pizza  zucchini good chucks tomato sauce cold  pizza undercooked tasted it  saw other pizzas come tables looking fully cooked darker golden brown ours  Didn't even bother take leftovers home  Very disappointing  <EOR> We used frequent restaurant often  Unfortunately inconsistency food forced elsewhere  pizza soggy undercooked over cooked water downed sauce  Rocco's Dom DeMarcos both Summerlin never disappoint  <EOR> First time eating WOW! delicious!

Paired Stella  am going back soon try pasta   highly recommend restaurant  <EOR> Went lunch  food good  service slow  very very slow   All enjoyment food lost  Wasn't really crowded  no idea if problem  waiter uncommunicative  <EOR> Ordering slices such hit miss expience  Sometimes well prepared fresh   other times give 5 hour old pizza re cheesed!    Zero consistency  Same sandwiches  Once fantastic meatball sub filled generous amounts sauce cheese  Another time sandwhich way little sauce bread wasn't cooked all   If want experience original NY Pizza Pasta try location Jones Sahara   food way better  <EOR> Nasty food  many dishes focus takes away quality  Ordered few dishes happen try pizza which frozen middle  Let's know its frozen food warmed order  Very nasty  <EOR> The food very very good   crust soft way it   best part sauce   Definitely made fresh  <EOR> Son enjoyed slice beautiful day  could better way spend afternoon  Only ordered 1 slice boy but really enjoyed time  <EOR> Local great pizza Summerlin very casual owners always there Prices good kid friendly  clown comes Fridays custom balloons designs kids    <EOR> Unlike other opinions bad service 5 times find waitresses all incredibly friendly   fact owners always casually eating friends drinking wine whatever want own place business    I think fact eat own restaurant good sign   fact remain accessible customers ask things them rock stars pizza business   very outgoing amicable   and last night personally stopped table asked friend if everything okay   just couple issues food ordered tomato basil soup   thinking most restaurants would very simple   tomatoes blender basil etc   But white soup came instead bit put off   must all milk?  sip pretty much milked down tasted terrible   waitress kindly asked if didn't want she took off bill   She felt bad kitchen super busy   No worries  I don't let few small things ruin image place especially service being good is   friend ordered gluten free pizza because diet restrictions    tasty   But bad because feeling sick all night  SO   I think something else crust couldn't process probably corn   really yummy though    Message Mark Rich now great wheat free corn free pizza crust flour!! *hint hint*   Thanks all! <EOR> Large pie w mushroom always winner   heard good things rest menu but very difficult stray weekly order    Nice some NY pizza desert  <EOR> Food Delicious generous portions Service Deplorable  First good chicken marsala which came two full chicken breasts cooked perfection massive pile pasta  Put fancy presentation dish would expect eating expensive gourmet restaurant  friend large antipasto salad which    well large doesn't even begin cover it  salad big enough choke hippo  pizzas also looked very tasty great review everybody table  Honestly food itself deserves higher rating but service bad enough drag all way down   Now bad  Most time entire staff busy watching football game bothered paying attention customers  Personally ask water multiple times set utensils friend server forgot bring set asked shouldn't provided without asking? Oh real icing cake asked box food server kind enough box herself  then forget it  actually ask food back several minutes later getting ready leave   I'm going mark place off Return   <EOR> Great service love pepperoni pizza some great specials  Its neighborhood shop easy too! <EOR> So good! service exceptional! Stromboli world wings great  come all time family friends  <EOR> I've eaten northwest location many times previously extremely happy decided try Summerlin location close kids school  Ordered #1 special  Large pizza bucket wings $35 spaghetti marinara $7 home found received 4oz souffle cup ranch BUCKET buffalo wings  Obviously enough  pizza good  wings tasted freezer burn something  Didn't eat many since didn't enough ranch  back next day ask more ranch  Explained much bucket she still charged almost $5 more ranch! Ridiculous but needed ranch wings edible  <EOR> I don't know why place only averages 3 stars  ordering dining last couple years pretty legit overall  pizza pretty good typical thick crust variety  chicken strips soups all good too  only gripe would pretty minor DM chicken wings sometimes feather traces left them but came bird really big deal but seen others grossed it    Otherwise great mom pop pizza spot  Another plus decent bottle wine $20  <EOR> I never bad experience here  Come routinely day climbing red rock almost always order pepperoni bacon pineapple jalapeño pizza! Wash down chainbreaker white IPA  <EOR> Pizza good when first going sadly quality quickly declined pizza no longer good pizza also much expensive worst but certainly best <EOR> Never take out but definitely again!  So food takes 15 20 minutes ordered 2 slices pizza 2 medium spinach calzones   never seen large life cost $16 but seeing size mediums probably guess size!  So NY pizza slice perspective bad   right price definitely right taste buds   slice cheese slice white   The calzones far definitely winner   expecting $9 piece wife would getting some tiny things which would complement pizza slices   However could barely share one!  crust soft which rarely calzone which meant dough freshly made cooked right temperature   also didn't skimp marinara which did appreciate   All all definitely trying them again    Hopefully don't run into same bad reviews others but perhaps to go actually good spot versus in dining   Personally don't care in dining much anyways unless going some posh place Strip   Now find good place  close teriyaki hibachi chicken to go golden  <EOR> Had team party flag football team food service great  Mark Rich personally made sure staff took care whole night! Awesome pizza! <EOR> We couple times food service great  Bob wife restaurant most time always striking conversation   kids love play pizza dough give them keep them occupied  <EOR> I've only twice while working nearby client site  waiter service nice efficient   Both times calzone dough quite nice baked just right   sauce little mild side liking but tasty nonetheless  also 6 flavors CJ's italian ice location   If you've never Italian ice gotta try it   bad spot quick lunch   sure pizza haven't tried yet   next time  <EOR> I Sunday Night Football game pleased see game TVs  pizza quality OK but better  worst part all service  felt service rushed entire time  Eventually found server getting close end shift kept prodding pay check  Now don't mind paying tipping advance server leaving early but she being very rude guests constantly asking if wanted food to go when just received five minutes ago  checked closing time 2 hours prior closing wasn't holding entire staff back  don't think ever received such poor service  When eating thought food OK wanted come back try pasta but experienced going again  Hope better time did! <EOR> Kristin excellent call smoupie because hospitality pasta tequila wonderful whole wheat pasta which ask special  Mark Rich's really covers all great food healthy options beautiful competent  waitress smile    back sure! <EOR> Should known place bad Day opened   wife said oh lets try them again   Okay hopefully improved since last time which well over year ago   Well should KNOW better!!!!  PIZZA BURNT BOTTTOM CRUST SOGGY!!!   Ordered Calamari Bigger Mistake  Frozen rings   son thought mozzarella rings daughter thought onion rings   must buy food albertsons frozen food section    staff needs trained knowing Menu better telling people accurate time pick up   Leave another menu door bring back store everytime ask owner   Leaving menu's doors cars littering marketing!!!!!!!!!  Also tell owner off bar stool Manage!!!!
