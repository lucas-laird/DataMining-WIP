I shrimp grits medium box $14 which pricey side considering maybe 5 little shrimp inside  But bigger problem gravy very very spicy which identified anywhere box which made inedible  <EOR> Probably best meal prep ready food had!! yummy  convenient microwave when you're really use  Always helpful friendly  now on!! <EOR> I just put down fork write review  ate Coriander Chicken meal fantastic  first concerned portion size but just finished meal am satisfied  employee awesome gave run down food food change outs keep freshness  Definitely pleased food location also great  recommend  <EOR> Not great first impression    know store new but interior store very cold uninviting  walked into almost empty store 2 black shelving units each  side walls   guy working greeted right away but didn't really ask any questions if first time anything that  He just said hi then walked behind counter   Ambiance 1 5 I walked looked all containers there  Some them looked OK    But gotta admit prices all little high me  quantity didn't equal price  posted picture Mac cheese     kind hard see picture but 2 broccoli florets seriously 4 spoonfuls macaroni $6 35    Without tasting it   I can't say flavor but honestly why does healthy always = $$$$? Value 1 5 I excited place opening but honestly going trader Joe's whole foods even glaziers buying pre made stuff better deal  guess if true celiac can't any gluten might good try but if normal person just trying eat healthier very little time hand would look elsewhere   I did end buying 2 things    Ended being $22 98    2 very little entrees  update review once actually taste food    Quality ???? Since review just mainly covering ambiance service  And oh end used bathrooms because getting some tables delivered guy phone pretty much ignoring trying figure table situation    while waiting used bathroom guess guests    Cuz trying close door he almost ran saying normally don't bathroom    Uummmm   I guess just imagining bathroom    Weird he could ignore whole time he phone soon walk into bathroom normally he saw me     He did mention if see something menu currently request could us   Unless food amazing    Which didn't look would be   I don't see myself returning anytime soon  <EOR> Stopped yesterday grabbed spaghetti squash turkey meatballs quite tasty  definitely back! <EOR> Decided come try place because failing meal prep  setup extremely simple but clean which like  vegetarian meals separated non vegetarian meals  Since having major sweet tooth just strawberry muffins some type yogurt spread  popped microwave instructions said let tell didn't even taste microwaved extremely fresh  still tasted strawberries   Plus macros pretty reasonable terms protein fats carbs  Which another plus place  love list macros rather just calories! only thing keeping giving place five star pricing  believe little overpriced since take home heat type meal  just expect pricing bit lower because sure meals prepared bulk then pre portioned  <EOR> Forget all other Healthy Food Prep places  menu pinnacle quality  always hard time finding places care nutrition let alone convenience  found healthy home!  The customer service highly attentive feel welcome  am definitely making spot all noms  <EOR> Cute little spot some healthy eats  tucked away little shopping plaza didn't even know there    You walk store seems empty  small fridge area fresh juices ans lemonades  Really good but pretty pricey    You also order some food since don't really any seats  food also pretty pricey but guess eating healthy does cost Lil more  <EOR> Food great place perfect if busy schedule  Meal prep store! Healthy delicious  <EOR> Nice guy but question business plan   seem just distributor but suppliers leaving them short   First time food scarce juice non existent   He said Juice next week Second time week later even less food still no juice   asked when juice would replenished he said next week      They claim food fresh daily but when see dates they're least 4 days old     There definitely market this   but no supply   Run your business man we're thirsty money! <EOR> I repeat customer  previously used chef service weekly meal preps helped tremendously weight control when added exercise  When chef moved back LA eager find another meal prep service  don't gift making healthy food taste good wanted try few samples entree items  purchased 4 entrees ate Italian Turkey Meatballs w Spaghetti Squash evening  am impressed    tasty healthy! Great customer service store also    <EOR> I've attempted pick some juice multiple occasions over course last few weeks no success  business claims everything fresh daily basis sure need improve supply chain!
