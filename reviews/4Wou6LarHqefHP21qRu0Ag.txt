Why call name? order still wrong took 40 minutes even it  Management should fire whole day staff  <EOR> I really Tropical Smoothies establishments  However store inefficient dirty  No sense ordering ahead your order isn't prepared till arrive  Owners need hire least two people teach them keep place clean  <EOR> How does place stay business?  reviews place justice   ordering cashier literally answers cell phone register says hey helping white dude want ?  NEVER any place business employee answer phone register while helping let alone call white dude    only came because closer Blue Diamond location but moving forward never come place again   Blue Diamond store all business   Place joke wouldn't surprised if fail health inspection  <EOR> So some guy guessing employee comes outside wearing ATI uniform carrying textbooks walk into kitchen starts making sandwiches without washing hands just puts gloves on  Also answers personal phone while working  Wtf <EOR> Never uncomfortable life ordering food  Byosha didn't seem interested taking order   No greeting anything just blank stare waited take order replacing receipt tape  wife asked turkey bacon ranch attitude answer   never return here  <EOR> I 2 days row  Yesterday peanut butter cup today Bahama Mama!

Seriously lady nasty attitude meal ordered came side which she didn't give   Seriously worst customer service ever  literally anywhere else <EOR> Do read reviews? many people comment lack staff weekend  Sunday just watched three groups people leave rather wait  did same thing yesterday  feel employees  Pretty sure franchise standards respect speed  love tropical smoothie but fix Blue Diamond store training store always plenty people working  <EOR> Oh should looked ratings before ordered location  Shocker low  Not! Ordered chicken salad sandwich toasted baked lays chips smoothie  salad smoothie  ordered UberEATS working home today paid 4 99 delivery  Horrible! don't answer phone can't even let them know  <EOR> If any kind hurry would avoid place  extremely slow under staffed  No since urgency all wait time could 30 45 minutes easily smoothie?? <EOR>
