Can't wait come back!! <EOR> The pool isn't heated enjoyable swim time year  prices kinda high kids running around all crazy splashing everyone  view AMAZING! Wish pool heated would given 4 stars then  <EOR> Level 8 heißt deshalb weil es sich um den 8  Stock des Stratosphere Hotels handelt   Und dort befindet sich der Pool des Stratospheres  Wir waren im August 2014 Gäste des Hotels und haben den Pool mehrmals besucht  Auf den Fotos der Internetseiten sieht dieser allerdings schlechter aus als er Wirklichkeit ist   Der gesamte Bereich ist recht groß und man konnte immer ein ruhiges Plätzchen finden  Liegen sind ausreichend vorhanden und Handtücher gibt es unbegrenzt   Der Pool selbst ist schön groß dass man sich auch den Spitzenzeiten noch wohlfühlen kann  Man blickt direkt auf den Stratosphere Tower und kann denjenigen die sich trauen beim Skyjump aus über 300m  Höhe zusehen  Der einzige Nachteil ist dass es bedingt durch die Lage im 8 Stock keine schattenspendenden Bäume gibt   Allerdings hat man viele Sonnenschirme aufgestellt die zumindest die direkte Sonneneinstrahlung etwas verringern  <EOR> Amazing! bar best staff Vegas! remembered group girls 3 years ago come stay stratosphere again because pool bar staff! Matt most friendly literally drink champ!  pool really enjoyable large over crowded which nice  back another 2 3 years see again! <EOR> Great spot party  most amazing view strip  because location isn't blocked other large casinos actually nice breeze despite 100 plus temperature    We early Fourth July celebration  Yellow Brick Road played while enjoyed buckets cold beer  9 00 amazing firework display  something said fighting crowds being able just chill reclining lawn chair while watching choreographed inferno above  Totally awesome! <EOR> During 4 day vacation experienced okay customer service Elation pool staff initially  During last day Saturday the staff seemed bit careless  group sat entire time without being approached waiter despite being completely visible  Thus approached bar glass water  waited 7 minutes only 1 bartender  Once he able serve he approached asked he could which responded just two cups water he then ask if am 21 which case told yes 24  He responded asking ID  Since ID chair proceeded leave bar  return ID friend also requested glass water  waiter again suggested he needed see ID which  asked water? handed ID  He then says does matter? You're bar don't question      The poor attitude snarky comments nonchalant attitude paying customers should tolerated  hope Ivo better days during employment Fire bar  stratosphere  However no longer visit bar    I suppose apple does spoil bunch  <EOR>
