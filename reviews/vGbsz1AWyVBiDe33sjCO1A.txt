Disappointed  Ordered small coffee lady taking order said should probably medium size because small would strong  Ok don't adjust shots according sizes coffee?!?! <EOR> Cold brew Stumptown coffee tap! Enjoyed charcuterie cheese plate pesto olives  Perfect way kick off Vegas trip  barista told flew employees training Stumptown owner  <EOR> The coffee nice cafe but real shame service lack it  dining cafe put order large cappachino medium latte cup dining in  told only tiny cups would paper takeaway cup despite fact dining in  requested muffin stayed counter pay  totally ignored sat down  coffee brought takeaway cups but no muffin  When sugar etc asked girl if muffin which replied no  She proceeded brought over where sitting having coffee  paper bag!!!!! asked if could plate dining warned up  begrudgingly done  While sitting eating waitress came told should paid when ordered  replied twice pay ignored  Good coffee bad experience !!!! Would back there <EOR> Had breakfast twice  Nothing complain about  4 5 because missing opportunity sit outside  <EOR> A cozy little getaway within strip casino  Very comfortable nice mix intimate tables couches stuffed chairs  server behind counter could more pleasant attentive professional   I coffee but intrigued fairly ambitious menu ordered potabello mushroom sandwich very pleased  mushrooms sauteed marinated just right almost meat texture love portobello mushrooms  cheese sauteed peppers grilled bread all stepped supporting roles very good sandwich   The noise smoke accompany most casinos wasn't issue just far enough away casino floor quickly forgot casino   I'd say place good casino coffee shop  <EOR> Tuscany casino nice place good coffee does Italian feel which nice  <EOR> I say lived 11 years when think cafe casino nauseous bc usually just bc open 24 7  really hungry comp decided use needless say again day 2  omelette bacon cheese onion  Absolutely delicious hash browns perfect taste amazing  know seems simple but some really gross cafe food more cafe food  Very good! <EOR> I past weekend ordered couple panini's  some reason panini's took full 25 minutes which getting pretty frustrating  could see basically only employee making panini's he all customers' panini's basically time only 1 machine limited space   To improve experience think cashier NEEDS let people know before pay hey just FYI going approx 20 minute wait whatever because customers want wait long sandwich!!!   Anyways   beyond      paninis actually very delicious  enjoyed bread used everything very tasty   Please just warn people if your sandwiches going take abnormally long time  <EOR> The original source Stumptown coffee Vegas located inside Tuscany Resort easiest find when using front entrance it's right corner located near pool  Hot cold coffees available but cold brew Midnight Brew over ice best choices  There's limited pastry case menu fresh salads flat bread pizzas sandwiches refrigerator case grab options  Service over several visits best frequently clarify repeat basic orders drinks tendency underfilled inch rim annoying when large only 16oz begin with  <EOR> This cafe located inside hotel casino kinda nice atmosphere close  girlfriend came just looking drink while town    We walked started chatting worker seeing nobody else cafe  He incredibly nice helpful  He knew menu incredibly well  legitimately impressed well he knew everything he could spout all juts off top head  takes dedication point admire persistence    The reason am putting only 3 star because both ordered chai tea latte both drinks very little flavor great  Neither incredibly impressed quality drink  would willing try again but wouldn't getting drink    Ultimately don't your way but if you're around ahead  many other places around where better drink  <EOR> Ordered two drinks ladies helpful happy assist 'no dairy' drink  Love coffee  Pastries huge fresh  <EOR> A little pricey but but quality nice sized portions  Donuts huge  egg sausage cheese sandwich English muffin  Very convenient located right Tuscany hotel  <EOR> A fantastic little bakery Tuscany Resort   Coffee excellent strong but bitter smooth finish   Bagels muffins doughnuts   chocolate covered doughnut which 6 7 inches across     HUGE was   I think coffee brand Stumptown coffee   Haven't brand before liked lot   Even if staying Tuscany Resort great place visit two blocks off main strip  <EOR> My favorite off strip hidden gem  Caesar salad always crisp fresh flatbread pizzas delicious  homemade potato chips addictive!

If haven't tried cheese must rubbed espresso lavender okay might sound bit wild but delish! flat bread pizza also really tasty! if save room dessert giant chocolate chip cookies lots pastries probably best coconut macaroons ever so soft ! Staff really friendly helpful  likely new Vegas spot when want some  good food without strip chaos price! <EOR> I sausage egg cheese sandwich breakfast wasn't very good burnt flavor scent it  Tried again lunch grilled cheese same result  other restaurants capacity due event going time  said brought snacks next day self defense  sandwich machine needs cleaning replacing  Wouldn't fed garbage dog  <EOR> Cafe shop serves smooth coffee  use stumptown coffee beans pacific northwest  Pastries huge might want share  Overall place cool off don't want sit slots walk strip <EOR> This coffee shop located Tuscany Resort near pool area  stopped meet some fellow Yelpers staying particular hotel  ordered Stumptown Cold Brew beverage    The cold brew okay  unfortunately sourness hard avoid  funny even guy behind counter warned but set cold brew understood bit sour but this  took few drinks use but while grew enough finish off  don't think intended sour wonder if bad batch    Anyways service very good friendly  also provide baked goods craft beers wine some light eats perfect enjoying pool side  WiFi free but ask password  small amount comfortable seating inside abundance outside near pool  <EOR> Der Chaitea Latte ist sehr schlecht hat mehr Schaum als Tea  Das Ambiente und die Bedienung sind mangelhaft  <EOR> I really enjoy spot morning cup coffee  atmosphere very pleasant cozy coffee very good  also very nice outdoor area looks right into pool chairs tables    Gluten Free offer any gluten free baked goods but some gf granola bars also offer small fruit cups! <EOR> love stumptown coffee! great croissants too! <EOR> Breakfast coffee decent here  Ordered egg cheese English muffin sausage cappuccino  Both very hot yummy!! Started day happy! <EOR> Das kleine Café Tuscany ist nicht mein Fall es ist soweit zwar sauber und ordentlich jedoch abgesehen von den recht teuren Panini 8$ die dann aber doch nur zwei Weizenbrotscheiben sind war ich weder vom Cappuccino noch vom Chai Tee überzeugt  Die Preise dafür waren ebenfalls hoch sodass am Ende nur bleibt dass dieses Kaffee im Haus liegt  Der nächste SB ist jedoch nur einmal quer über die Straße sodass dieses wohl mein einziger Versuch hier im Bottega bleiben wird  Sehr schade da die sonstige Gastronomie im Tuscany bisher immer gut war  <EOR> Waking walking downstairs cafe wonderful  Quaint cozy tables just outsude door perfect view pool  <EOR> They perfect little menu tons food any occasion! cinnamon coffee cake mocha  mocha delicious creamy coffee cake giant piece full cinnamon! outdoor seating shade pool  lots cute birds around too  <EOR> Stumptown funk up Stumptown funk up Say whaaa?!  Cold brew coffee  what  Not new news but Caffé Bottega Tuscany Casino serving Stumptown Coffee Roasters cold brew coffee  recently visiting Pacific Northwest didn't realize strong presence Stumptown coffee until left  Strangely enough tea binge time subconsciously avoided coffee altogether yes am looking S***bucks   curiosity Stumptown brought adventure all way Tuscany Casino   From main entrance Tuscany Casino right almost hidden cafe  immediately enticed sweet goodies case which pastries donuts  buttermilk bar square shaped one wow yummy  5 5  The highly anticipated cold brew bit disappointing  Compared other places town impressed  Cold brew supposed less acidic bitter taste  version acidic  some fruity floral tones present  did finish drink  3 5  The baristas warm friendly helpful   sell Stumptown coffee bag $16  <EOR> I stopped drinking starbucks since found stumptown coffee! alot pastries but recommend visit morning cause thats when pastry shelf fully stocked  always cold brew  <EOR> Stumptown coffee spot located inside Tuscany Resort   go cold brew    <EOR> The Grand Opening featured beer soda coffee tasting along food samples  Joseph James brewery reps hand goodies samples chocolate stout rye brews   This nice little cafe selection craft brews coffee bevvies paninis pizza salad etc  sign advertised homemade potato chips   The food very good especially liked pastrami panini Caesar salad  Tuscany few restaurants choose without knowing if also local brews such Joseph James I'd choose cafe  outdoor seating party but looked temporary just grand opening  <EOR>
