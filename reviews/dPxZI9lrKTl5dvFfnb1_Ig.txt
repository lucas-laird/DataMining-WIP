She didn't know but she would eat it  Marsala sauce most places very rich flavor but extremely mild flavorless  Usually when faced poor meal just suck enjoy sauce pasta but sauce very good  occasion did something done only couple times life I'm retired lot years sent back! ordered Chicken Saltimbocca  expectations would great! Wrong! lacked flavor very bland  chicken cooked well dollops cheese top but no other flavor  Usually sauce pasta best part but night  no add flavors artichoke hearts prosciutto mushrooms  sauted onions  olives  give flavor but when add types things just sauce really nail sauce  Marsala did mushrooms but wasn't enough cover weakness sauce  written glowing review place before but totally different place  different cook? Did change sauce recipes? Because everyone else gave four give three stars  Based solely meals would give one  people very friendly know take pride restaurant but unlikely return  <EOR> Opening day can't wait back!
