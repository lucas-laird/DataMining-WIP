A majority food tried pretty good  really liked prime rib mac n' cheese  desserts highlight the mini key lime pies awesome   also loved roasted potatoes would give salmon four stars five   My main complaint size variety buffet  paid $26 95 person dinner expecting some grand spread  Instead buffet walk end other less 15 seconds  heart sank when first walked saw small was  mad myself agreeing place without looking reviews first  Fortunately little did good enough feel though money wasn't completely wasted   I can't say sure would recommend place considering charge limited selection  dinner companions mixed reviews place  guess if want avoid icky crowd sometimes Circus Circus but don't want pay Bellagio's prices then may worth try  <EOR> went buffet because staying casino   really bad service   waitress saw no longer drinksbut continued clean tables then proceeded walk off  food all that  buffet really small considering caesars   personally save your money different buffet  <EOR> So thought through all Vegas posts didn't you? just never around working post mainly because buffet itself disappointing  When arrived Cafe Lago inside Caesar's Palace Las Vegas saw empty place was  great sign  only reason ate because moved rooms over hotel staying Bellagio few nights easy just downstairs find buffet   The room itself beautifully decorated   The buffet itself tiny selection small  course crab legs  cocktail shrimps prime rib all but much else offer   I initially thought oyster shooters available when saw those small glasses but just cocktail sauce other just olives  Disappointing    There soup station claimed wonton soup available  cold night sounded good tried bowl  Beneath those huge lids soups could add mushrooms various other toppings  But alas wontons no where found  asked server where she said it  What?? Then why label wonton soup? into very good discussion waitress nice Vietnamese lady basically told no ever likes soup  She pointed into direction buffet Wynn very honest she kindly mixed some free Mimosas without asking  Mimosas usually extra  felt know all lives    The pastry bar just ok  Nothing really stood here    There some good things buffet  everflowing chocolate fondue fountain  Dark chocolate white chocolate lots lots strawberries blueberries blackberries other fruits dipping  didn't care much chocolate itself just those blueberries blackberries because if ate 10 pounds those could money's worth  think just did that    One other thing liked Cafe Lago large selection mini parfaits  particular guava parfait truly special others good too  some jello shots quite good  real ice cream soft serve   So Cafe Lago lacked meats try fruits ice creams parfaits  don't think  enough warrant voluntary return visit much better buffets Vegas such Bellagio Le Village Buffet Paris Hotel   Full post photos blog  <EOR> Came because buffet PASS  should've PASSed one!

He said lobster bisque soup   OK now am some sort dumbass?  soup section some nasty chowder something else looked nasty   No lobster bisque   finish horrible meal outside eyes didn't lie said LOBSTER f*cK   Would recommend anyone spend money here   only thing good where chocolate covered strawberries   ate free comped but still left furious  <EOR> I always remember place   first place ever dined Las Vegas   remember yesterday   ex gf arrived Vegas 6am no idea where eat   staying Bellagio but everything seemed closed ended Caesars Palace somehow   wandered around aimlessly until saw restaurant looked open   quickly ran first Vegas meal Breakfast buffet   can't believe easily amused back then all drink chocolate milk   food wasn't bad hard judge since you'd try really hard screw breakfast foods   check place again   for old times sake  <EOR> I knew place bad reviews Yelp before coming but looking light breakfast Buffet Buffets pass before going pool gave shot  Good choice!  The breakfast great  multiple different sausages other meats choose from  Scrambled eggs excellent lot pastries fruit try although no desserts   Yes selection very small but if you're looking light breakfast especially BoB pass don't afraid give Lago chance   Would try lunch dinner maybe? <EOR> We stayed Caesars Palace decided first buffet stop downstairs Lago   around 7 30pm cashiers having some sort problem because taking them literally 4 mins process guest    and party 13     all paying separately   would say only thing enjoyed prime rib   selection probably worst seen Vegas     there none   cafe work more selection here   give them credit variety dessert but being disappointed dinner didn't crave any dessert   The only positive bought buffet buffets deal other buffets made it   Caesars!  Step up  <EOR> If could give no stars would   You would think Caesars Palace would grand buffet but think again  wait extremely long  think family waited around 2 hours in  selection very minimal  mean literally when reached very end buffet    said  it? Everything dry salty  your typical fried egg rolls prime rib fresh salad two choices pasta  only thing could say decent shrimp  There's dessert bar shaped circle    everywhere around circle same damn dessert  Oh pumpkin pie looks bought Smiths something   Just horrible  NEVER come back again  <EOR> I ate weight snow crab creme brulee  Maybe better buffets but fit bill me  Especially if Caesar's convention area  just escalator ride entrance  I'd back take friend  <EOR> I dinner very unimpressed food selection buffet price was  setup buffet also horrible moving people could start end converge middle no where go  did  Shrimp buffet but found funny weren't  de shelled suckers still legs them crap why didn't kill them myself while you're it  Overall service fine buffet but just wasn't Greek orgy food expecting Ceasers Palace have  <EOR> Me bf Cafe Lago 4 25 2010 sunday brunch   great time because atomsphere cozy nice staff really friendly too     Food okay lack variety probably weakness but quality juice omelet crab legs prime ribs pancakes pretty good least kept wanting more more   Sushis look good just many other buffets vegas  we enjoyed great time if looking good place chat just relax enjoy some food you! <EOR> I only eaten two Vegas Buffets Wynn buffet let say cannot compare two all!

Pay price admission $40 wait seated  where fun begins  seated wait server come drink order could started buffet  waited 15 minutes maybe longer enough time wife plate then leave plate   No come help let preface saying place full 3 tables occupied section May 20 tables   way no server yet but waitresses standing talking lifes many important events   Finally waive waiter down see if could something drink he takes order yells guessed two ladies still yapping away    Start dig every thing cold!  scrambled eggs runny cold crescent egg cheese sandwich ever cheese heated then cooled down then heated back enough said! Sausage ham bacon all cold  just thought back bagel lox cream cheese  could bad right? should known just looking lox sliced thicker then use still piled 4 slices half bagel grabbed other half smeared some cream cheese it  Nooooooooo bagel stale lox fishy spit them out    I asked wife food was  Wouldn't know she experience did figure! Lol!   I probably give Casser's more shot but worst breakfast ever had  could gone Denny's across street ate less money gotten better service happy!   Proceed caution!!!!! <EOR> It's run mill buffet place Caesar's seems quite small   Anyways mom needed quick bite before shuttle arrived ended here   just concentrated just having mostly peeled shrimp cocktail you can't really mess some beef ribs some veggies   actually broccoli raab cauliflower some mixed mushroom dish pretty good  <EOR> Wanted brunch buffet type Sunday hadn't hit Caesar's yet decided give go   Oh cool line's long shouldn't take long   Took them half hour through 20 people buffet      The service also slow once in   Waitress brought drinks then pretty much didn't see again until two plates later asked bill   point she asks friend if he wants refill asked bill when cup's empty since halfway through first plate looks he's crazy when he says no   The buffet pretty limited don't even put scrambled eggs   nice eggs omelets cooked order but when  ONLY way eggs wait 10 15 minutes   Admittedly salmon cream cheese omelet pretty good   also ham skirt steak some other carved meats ribs crab legs though those gone refilled    Definitely didn't seem worth price  <EOR> I thought excellent buffet   Sure selection may vast other buffets around town but quality   Ambiance very nice very friendly staff   Deserts okay   Good anytime day  <EOR> We've going Vegas buffets 40 years finally decided try Caesar's  figured 1st class resort would great buffet  WRONG!!!! Besides being smallest buffet ever boring uninteresting  Loaded different pastas  Except cold shrimp no shrimp dishes any kind  Trays left almost empty  emailed manager expecting least appology but even courtest reply  1st time ever left buffet hungry  hate say but would better any other buffet includes Terribles! Actually Hometown Buffet better! Sorry Caesars need LOT better  <EOR> DON'T COME HERE  I didn't know buffets bad  included 24hr buffet deal Vegas offers   looks promising outside dinner   soon walked down line food smile frown   Nothing looked appealing small selection food   They random plastic cups even more random things them don't know if supposed combine all little cups salad but lame   crab legs super salty!  Soups horrible everything else looked bad couldn't even put plate   thought okay bust but dessert hard mess right? WRONG   didn't even ice cream desserts looked crumby   buffet Vegas doesn't ice cream!?!?!?  Oh wait  right ONE   To top off left see if something missed edible when came back table swarm exaggerating gnats hovering over plates  EWW told waiter happen ask everything he stares plates says want it? should just close down because whoever running shouldn't food business  <EOR> This smallest buffet visited Vegas least impressive  lunch last day luckily eating other buffets day before weren't all hungry  ended mostly filling salad bagels lox cream cheese pretty unremarkable buffet but  really all looked good there  Other items included few pasta dishes carved meats two breakfast items scrambled eggs sausage  tried two things unimpressed  just back salad pretty boring!  The two positive things say place 1 no wait time 2 ice cream cone enjoy leave buffet  <EOR> My girlfriend lunch buffet  price pretty cheaper expected but foods way less expected!! only recall 5 items dessert really bad well   The service!!!

More Suchi noodles etc  think  LUXOR too  Monte Carlo nice too  good MUCH more selections CP    Anyhow disappointing  should read review before went  <EOR> Service deserves 5 stars but  only 5 star feature   There great deal variety lunch normally find other buffets  counters average poor presentations  risotto good if right when came but sitting while could tell rice began dry out   Denver Omelet good except excessive cheese  sure tell them light cheese   Beef ossa good flavor looks piece ox tail but tastes good beef   Top round beef good if eat right away  If sits your plate yet another item dry out   The dessert presentation great  Using milk chocolate dishes hold various fruits raspberries strawberries etc   Ambience nice Bellagio but food matching quality yet  <EOR> I wanted hit myself soon saw food choices while eating leaving writing this    for trusting YELP reviews   SHOULD LISTENED FELLOW YELPERS   place huge disappointment say least    Oh man Where start?   planning RIO Seafood Buffet originally but decided farther walk where were   Totally awed grandness Caesars Palace exterior thought might well   all CAESARS     could actually even bad?  Let's talk price   $33 some change per person dinner buffet   want swear   RIDICULOUS lack food options   If manager tasted food myself $18 would price   Food crab legs I prefer them warm fresh broiler butter dip them into but nope!  COLD top ice cubes tasted if they've thawed cocktail shrimp ok no surprise barbequed ribs so hard couldn't chew it   licked flavor left some bite marks sushi maki rolls?  3?  call variety? roast beef pork belly ham turkey Chinese food Mexican food some pasta dishes poor salad section so little choice vegetable selection good variety breads rolls didn't see any soup section    Only plus dessert section  perfectly crafted some them quite tasty   Service Poor   Why should even comment section place Caesar's?  Shouldn't least 4 star 5 star service?  2 cashiers collecting money just couldn't work any slower   People line all annoyed getting impatient   Water refilled quickly enough   asked paper napkin waiter came back saying them gave wet cloth napkin!  Waited 9 min ice cream before someone came over b c no single employee standing around behind buffet line around 8 10 pm Fri night   When 2 other people started wait behind said Hello   Hello?  Excuse me?! annoying     Decor Nice pleasant   Fancy but over top expected   My final advice along many many yelpers given negative reviews     PLACE WORTH YOUR MONEY   much different your local casino's international buffet  <EOR> Probably weakest buffet Strip  Small selection but definitely necessities prime rib shrimp cocktail king crab legs  But really nothing spectacular dessert section impressive  Pass!! <EOR> I must say hesitant try place reading all reviews but since only buffet place Cesar's dinner voucher place decided take risk  During holidays special sea food special going which include unlimited shrimps crab legs  seafood fresh delicious deal maker itself  general buffet didn't find much variety  tried dim sum average fried rice average two kind sushi below average salad bar baked fish average 4 different kind potato Awesome off hook   dessert bar another deal maker because consisted 20 different kind desserts  think $27 place definitely worth especially if seafood platter well  server practically ignored table hence three stars <EOR> went lunch buffet  alright      wait 45  minutes line see friggin place over half empty tables???? WTF     its club where u create line place look its poppin       then seated table 4 when 5 ppl     now food     prime rib stringy able cut given knife    stopped eating first piece      the best items probably omelet eggs fajita tacos    pretty pathetic      orange juice tasted watered down 50 50     champagne pretty bad    <EOR> The casual buffet Cafe Lago Caesar's Place nothing special  $22 variety mediocre food  desserts decent but everything else disappointing best unremarkable  least decor decent live piano nice touch  <EOR> Why people harsh buffets? Maybe service rather food? dunno   Anyways really enjoyed buffet  24 hour buffet pass wonderful compared others   The pastas desserts notable other foods all around good  largest selection but did serve very tasty   I liked buffet  all really matters  <EOR> I don't know others would again rate buffet low!!!  weekend understood pricing could higher side   However buffet much better stinky Rio Buffet last year's Thanksgiving Vegas trip which took different friend   Caesar's Palace's Cafe Lago offered wide variety selections well true may offering certain types food selections but feel customers need think main THEME particular hotel casino crying loud!!!!

Come man   Vegas!  Here also service really stunk   waiter gone long periods time but when he came around he only serviced tables next HUH?    Then when he refilled waters he refilled 7 up   Blech  <EOR> The service definitely sucks but food breakfast anyway solid hearty  All staples present coffee good anywhere city  Try window seat south side room  waiters slow bit uncaring but mostly really cool place  Recommended! <EOR> Selection isn't great other major buffets but quality food it   price point $20 lunch fantastic   Great value opinion  <EOR> Since weekday only short line short wait! Since boyfriend loved buffet when he dined family breakfast he show place  seated waiting 5 minutes server immediately served drinks while took off grab breakfast  omelette DELICIOUS! freshly made customize however like  Try Denver Omelette which bell peppers onions ham   little everything if remember exactly  french toast delicious pairing Smuckers sugar free syrup but pancake just okay since seem left awhile  side pots warm breakfast items Egg Benedict Sausages Egg Sandwiches few more  There's also prime rib those prefers protein kind breakfast  center variety pastries cereal something simple kids  Over all most memorable item enjoyed most Denver Omelette  wonder why reviews low? If you're impatient don't bother head buffets during weekends dinner times unless VIP those 5 stars Diamond Member  <EOR> For buffet place good  try deliver international food providing sample it  stuff sushi variety European meat southern food Italian Chinese etc  purchase time meal $40 dollars 24 hour period  Hubby did since figured we'd Caesar's Palace least 2 days  24 hour deal better BUT   make sure eat 3 meals would your money's worth lol  <EOR> Not great Buffet  any means   Still you're usual items dinner Carving Station variety desserts obligatory amount Chinese food seafood section   overall decor restaurant very nice super high back booths tasteful aqua color scheme    fact heat crab legs plus   chef puts your crab legs you've selected hot water heat you     The salad bar section very small selection very limited when comes fruits   positive note hand scooped ice cream Waffle Cone   nice touch many buffets hand scooped ice cream     While participating Buffet Buffet group decided going 2 dinner buffets same night   stopped Lago Buffet around 9 20PM buffet closes 10PM   No problem thought   ate dinner then dessert   around 15 min closing dimmed lights   However group still finishing desserts   Then 10 min later turned lights completely!  dark finishing up   Wow   If let someone 9 59PM still need allow them time all food least half hour eat all food   all buffet   People need allowed time eat all food   Turning off lights when customer eating   Unacceptable  <EOR> First buffet Buffet Buffets tour   only breakfast can't really judge offerings later day   However buffet seems small don't see offering much terms variety   The nice thing buffet offer champagne bloody marys breakfast price   Most buffets wait brunch hour around 10 30am   couple mimosas started Buffet Buffets tour off right!  They offer sticky buns roasted chicken breakfast   try keep interesting   grits pretty good but scrambled eggs runny  Nothing really looked fantastic starving!  sure if lighting something but nothing looked good    Nice view pool   only two buffets Buffet Buffets outside view     Decent buffet but size limitations  <EOR> I am surprised low ratings buffet since would rate dining experience Cafe Lago near 5 stars  drew $50 dinner special Christmas seafood buffet being offered   The food selection Cafe Lago little limited compared other buffets M but quality food excellent    For Christmas buffet Cafe Lago offered all eat seafood platter king crab legs oysters shrimp all drink champagne addition standard buffet   The crab legs sweet succulent  shrimp coctail good but oysters let down because two friend first seafood platter seemed old  Shortly found buffet run oysters   We quite dejected since come all eat oysters  Fortunately server able wrangle four more fresh tasty oysters   We ended feasting champagne crab legs much 3+ hour meal which ended when lights flickered dimmed   What stopped giving buffet 5 stars would shortage oysters would only paid $40 Christmas buffet but regular one   Our server night excellent made dining experience much more enjoyable  Also originally planning M seafood buffet but found sold out!  Although really wanted M seafood buffet Cafe Lago turned most enjoyable dining experience trip Vegas! <EOR> Talk disappointment   regret   told guys Caesar's great buffet argue?  still nicer resorts strip   Memorial Day morning while weren't surprised charged weekend prices bit weird next empty   We found why   don't nearly pay come here   selection really comes down omelet station prime rib shrimp cocktails sushi   wasn't much variety foods didn't re supply quickly enough point where no fresh fruit found all! Also even though someone said quality beats quantity sure sucks when wait line food   really much better other places   On its own passable but many better options around same price really worth go  <EOR> The food excellent if nothing mind shattering   restaurant clean staff attentive   Maybe cost little bit more then other Vegas buffets but food good much complaint  <EOR> Since brunch weekend cost $24 95  lots people already eating  starving really didn't walk around see offered  first stop omelet station where smoked salmon omelet freshly made me  Also some bacon which nearby  then headed some salad I hate when don't label types dressings out saw those cute glasses shrimp my fave sausage some bread  Loved fresh squeezed OJ served well   Overall food okay  best part since came right brunch taking lunch items well way bread station turned into dessert station helped ourselves one last time chocolate covered strawberries other mini tarts  <EOR> Yelp should allow give negative stars because places this  earth place still even open?!

Wrong   most places just offer flaked potatoes made water   Pretty runny   mashed potatoes real potatoes mashed butter cream   Even better real bacon bits offered side   only beginning really good unusual vegetable dishes   Creamed celery root anyone?

Lets just say your kitchen probably bigger goin there    food bland    no variety    almost felt selecting food hospital cafeteria   no joke exaggerating either!  Take advice anyone complained    waste your time directly RIO Carnival Buffet    2nd if Planet Hollywood ok    unless platinum diamond seven stars membership prepared long line    take someone access walk thru VIP    Hmmm why didn't yelp check reviews before wasting time here   ummm never again!!! <EOR> experienced better would understatement year    Our waitress talked people table directly behind ours 10 minutes before coming over ask drink order  Brought drinks she didn't come again 20 25 minutes  Then own drink refills she finally noticed us     Meat way overcooked guy cutting meat wanted nothing me   or anybody else matter   Weekends free champagne hookup   plus   Generally food selection great especially considering much you're paying it     I've more impressed Golden Corral  <EOR> The buffet Cafe Lago slightly above average   don't super giant selection some other places but everything serve pretty good quality   Sometimes would rather few quality items over quantity   buffet more 3 5 stars   Also while Vegas recently eat again wedding reception   held large room back which accommodated 5 large tables guests   Caesar salad starter entrees choose between chicken prime rib salmon dessert strawberry cheesecake   dining area place settings extremely elegant classy which really liked   wish could say same food  Caesar salad only average   prime rib extremely good but then also anything eat all day already nearly 8pm probably saying much   lastly cheesecake pretty disgusting   wasn't traditional cheesecake pie crust bottom   Instead lot hardest sugar cookie could ever imagine  couldn't even cut into knife let alone try bite off   service good but painfully slow   start finish took nearly 2 hours salad entree dessert   raid buffet instead   Overall probably wouldn't want host wedding reception any dinner reception unless involved eating buffet  <EOR> Very good quality crowded service good $27 dinner seems reasonable  Only reason didnt give 5 stars dessert bar wasnt great  <EOR> Total sh*thole  expected much more Cesars  FAcADE   There poor selection garbage food here  didn't even seem fresh  $5 buffet quality    First barely anything  Most Vegas buffets plentiful many choices  terms food just bits pieces scraps  dumplings good but wrong defrosted deep fried pot stickers? else sad container corn cob chunks old looking pizza few small troughs sloppy pasta your typical buffet fruits   Dessert just sad  man scooping ice cream 2 tubs  He holding cone vanilla scoop customer just looked sad pathetic  can't explain  Anyway rest desserts little bits pieces yucky tasting lardy cream based things  don't even know don't even care  All know wasted calories sampling them   Enough already  Just don't here  somewhere else  Anywhere else  McDonalds example  <EOR> The buffet good but great Planet Hollywood formerly Aladdin's superb Wynn's   It weird ask bread server  Usually there's bread section available carb lovers  Bf jokingly said buffet Atkin's followers  Definitely lots meats!  Service good  Never ran juice  Though specifically ask spoons  guess worried could used weapon mass spooning  We paid brunch price didn't feel worth it  don't recommend place unless you're starving can't walk two legs  <EOR> Though buffet may largest all food offers good quality   I've come twice both times very pleased  Instead trying ram all kinds low quality food down your throat really try serve best    Seafood small section Chinese food meat station   Their omelet station mornings amazing  Oh if you're looking ice cream frozen yogurt section only offer cakes pastries all sorts    Try out! Especially if Buffet Buffets pass because don't already know you'll stuffing your face plenty other places  hurt try doesn't boast itself its overwhelming selections? <EOR> I impressed all only reason 2 star desserts good but selection small but did crab legs peel eat shrimp chilled But bring 6 party brought 8 crab legs 16 shrimp enough just started work try second platter less first 1 filled line foods nothing terrible far taste but much better but big buffets anyway little effort find better places <EOR> It's expensive other buffets  food didn't taste horrible  why gave place 3 stars   They almost same lunch dinner menu  only difference during dinner time dim sum food  no soup all when there  made extremely sad    The dessert pleasant  No icecream which also made really sad    I guess short buffet contradictory buffets  never buffet where no soup icecream     There everything else though   meat crab legs   shrimp    <EOR> Honestly decent but worth $30 IMO  selection really small especially compared buffet Bellagio Wynn    The waiter very very attentive big group  He top drinks clearing tables  He also nice enough try work split bill not    The food good but seriously nothing high caliber  Yes buffet but buffets Vegas known actually better food run mill buffets aren't Vegas  somewhat surprised why wasn't huge line buffet much anymore  <EOR> Without doubt WORST VEGAS BUFFET EVERRRRR    WARNING WARNING WARNING COME HERE!  I expecting more especially since buffet ever famous Caesars Palace  But completely let down  First off $27 dinner  cheapo any means  But honestly think food selection quantity equates $10 Hometown Buffet dinner   top off Sunday Brunch buffet Red Rock Casino following morning cost $14 completely blew away  When think Las Vegas Buffets think top line quality selection reasonable price  But nope Lago Buffet    The selections limited  Food wasn't world  Just bunch greasy American food tasted 2 days old   The dessert selection surprisingly okay  couple items liked    But overall place just BLOWS  <EOR> Service Horrible Price Expensive Food Sh_t Atmosphere Old  We late couldn't buffet wanted  since Hotel   What joke! saw chef around buffet giving direction staff  would never endanger myself much accessible guests fear would really tell horrible place is  He better man I   Absolutely some place else Wynn Bellagio Venetian  <EOR> This worst buffet Las Vegas    reminds mind comic strip saw Chicago Tribune Sports section many years ago where whole Russian baseball team take walk shame dugout into clubhouse replaced whole new team walking clubhouse dugout because first team sucked  Ceasar's Palace should chefs work buffet   The pork chops prime rib dried inedible  apple tried old brown stuff inside  three bean salad cilantro sprinkled all over does that? could post pictures later time  <EOR> This probably better buffet experiences anywhere   soon seated whole table served OJ carafe coffee share   Definitely come less crowded less noisy buffet experience   likely see less choices sure but quality food more it   The highlight garlic mashed potato tons roasted whole garlic cloves mixed inside   topped freshly cooked bacon bits die for!  also strawberries white chocolate   and mini pecan bars shortbread   yum!

Even servers employees embarrassed recommend Lago Cafe   Pricing $20 per person breakfast 12 different entrees  Scrambled eggs hash browns 3 types sliced bread two types sausages carved chicken ham roast beef biscuits gravy finally mashed potatoes   course coffee orange juice more arsenic cranberry juice   For lunch add $5 more skinny king crab legs cured salt water washed shrimp   Lots cheap pasta   kosher folks slimy salmon suspiciously low grade beef may kosher   Anyone endorses Caesar's Lago Buffet stupid because far better spreads first rate chefs runs circles around over rated scam   Which one's?  mentioned it  Bellagio   around $22 including tax over 3 times entrees actually taste cuisine  Unlike Lago Bellagio actually pride presentation flavors   Each taste each morsel filled surprising good flavors desserts! Let's talk desserts   Lago presents crummy cookies questionable donuts laughably small   Bellagio? WOW!  Caesar's Palace Buffet Lago best described disappointing waste money   People praise Lago simply smart common sense  When employees private don't recommend Lago then says lot why should elsewhere   Caesar's Palace Buffet Lago food best compared Sunset Station's Buffet   Food OK quality  only difference Sunset Station charges $7 versus +$20 lot less variety food  <EOR> A OK  came lunch Saturday thinking since its Caesar's palace would nice place buffet  Don't wrong atmosphere service good but   food just mediocre best part thought desserts all mini dessert dishes  Overall wouldn't first pick  would choose another buffet over one  <EOR> We Buffet Buffet passes Vegas where eat any Harrah's 7 hotels most disappointing  expected much better because located Caesars Palace Hotel Casino  food just straight nasty  didn't lot selections everything tasted came can  only buffet hard find! lol <EOR> $27 little steep dinner but since wasn't paying    never eaten dinner buffet before but feel options slightly limited however exceptionally good quality!

One other touch thought great fresh whole fruit stand  Kumquats kiwi baby pineapple blood oranges baby bananas  ate several kumquats would taken pineapple except some already cut that perfectly ripe sweet way why bother?  Next time memorial day weekend doing buffet buffets  If time right 4 meals it! <EOR> We saw $34 World World Buffets basically any Harrah's 5 buffets many times want $34 decided check Cafe Lago first because already Caesar's Palace everything else place pretty spectacular     We arrived late lunch 2pm still crazy long line   ended waiting hour half buffet probably wasn't worth wait   food selection really limited   really dry prime rib bland sushi rolls unshelled shrimp sad looking crab legs bunch other unmemorable items   The dessert selection also limited compared Bellagio Mandalay Bay but must admit loved cannolis fresh cantaloupe honeydew juicy delicious!    If $34 buffet pass all Harrah Buffets recommend Paris Buffet over one! <EOR> I would say strong point buffet desserts   fresh blackberries chocolate square shaped cup cannoli pecan pie chocolate covered strawberries cream puff couple other items all yummy petite sized   almost wished didn't eat much main food could more room stuff in   As savory items favorite coq au vin beef stew right next it   chicken coq au vin really tender flavors surprisingly tasty buffet quality cooking   Growing Asian dad would always capitalize crab legs prime rib   friend told crab didn't taste very fresh thought prime rib normal   don't eat slab slab meat if better good!

Well     much     Despite fact everyone party enjoyed food definitely excited   Being inside most prestigeous casinos gonna 5 stations buffet including salads dessert?  totally seen better         Everything picked seems chicken some sort veggies    single fish dish  pretty much all exciting choices find    and dry! Seriously folks    2 chicken dishes done differently but still chicken   Salad stations lack choices toppings etc    don't know     really don't much say buffet's edible contents    just lacking      So all planning visit vegas price $26 DEFINITELY another exciting buffet leave breathless literally    but if end going 24hrs buffet feast wouldn't hurt give place try     other that    really worth visit    <EOR> I'm really confused low ratings place  gf really great experience brunch buffet New Years day  probably most ginormous buffet but really need lost your buffet?

Think regular restaurant all want 1 delicious entree couple sides satisfied  many yummy dishes REALLY need happily stuff your face? If 5 10 quality choices isn't enough then    don't know tell you?  So think arrived around 10am Saturday Thanksgiving wait maybe 10 mins? serving breakfast foods when arrived exactly craving post clubbin'  eggs way better Paris's quite selection meats omelette station looked pretty legit  Plate 1 sampling obviously but when back plate 2 things started getting confusing    within 10 minutes all breakfast dishes replaced lunch options  gonna lie pretty upset first MORE BACON!! but stopped thought realized getting 2 buffets price 1! Actually BoB more 5 buffets 1 but point  Which perhaps why wasn't disappointed selection knows   Prime rib prime rib prime rib punctuated slice bone in ribeye  Mac n cheese  kind thick crusty layer top watery box kind  Some guy whose job only cut fresh fruit arrange slices delightfully platter  Pretty good pizza buffet  Hot peppery chicken strips little ones taste bud challenged  selection cold salmon cheese etc  Warm croissants  Funky looking dim sum things  plate prime rib mashed taters post breakfast mind you much more person eat? Even if buffet billion times larger still would stuck eating did   Desserts bomb but tummy distended end 24 hrs BoB adventure only tasted some creme brulee mini key lime pie cookies dipped chocolate fountain gelato served waffle bowl  Yikes loseit com come    Service admittedly lacking repeatedly work pretty hard flag down waiters fill waters coffee  Environment classy well lit welcoming wouldn't felt comfortable anywhere considerably fancier  Oh thought kind hard find don't feel bad if takes while there  In summary Lago lot going it  don't know would felt paying full price meal but part larger experience totally satisfied  Come prepared good meal few quality entrees save some room dessert! Breakfast ends early ish take into consideration  <EOR> I've twice  first time don't really remember experience but friends said wasn't good take word it  second time ate just YESTERDAY remember perfectly  came Cafe Lago lunch family yesterday   But before into just say depending where Caesar's you're coming felt Cafe Lago IMPOSSIBLE find  annoyed no signs directing buffet  Also Tuesday family first trying find place  took almost hour find because no signs ask 3 different people  3 different people pointed into direction restaurant when finally found restaurant sign entrance said buffet CLOSED lunch Tuesday Wednesday  annoyed because wondering why none people directed couldn't tell that? just very frustrating   ANYWAY come back Cafe Lago Thursday just try out  When line pretty long    weaving around everything but still line  wait line 20 minutes  thinking place good because long line  Well finally front following host seat  looking around room wondering why such long line in   many seats AVAILABLE    Once situated everything food  probably only ate full plate some desserts  Normally buffet eat 2 full plates half third I'm pretty thin but eat lot   reason why didn't eat much time because selection food isn't much    pretty disappointed definitely prefer Paradise Garden Buffet in Flamingo much better one   I want say most impressed desserts even though desserts look pretty much same all buffets  desserts own little area away rest food   Anyway pretty sure won't back long time  <EOR> This lamest buffet ever to  Selection food sucked oysters gritty sushi fresh crab legs ice cold bland  should call soup pho  Service horrible ask 3 separate servers refills   I actually last November trip wasn't recent  just haven't chance write review  You'd think time would lessen hatred place but experience just bad! Worst  Buffet  Ever  <EOR> Still star   Since buffet pass wanted see if things improved since last review wondered if 4 5 stars actually true   No all lies   would say drunk know good food tasted affliated Caesars some way   Too little selections   Low quality   Does taste good   Long waits lines service spotty   Danger Danger Wil Robinson   Danger!  I am anti Harrahs   just love good tasty food   Rio Carnival Buffet= tasty food great selections   Harrahs = great tasty food bit smaller Rio wonderful desserts   Cafe Lago should renamed Cafe Sucko   Don't listen fools place being best buffet ever ate   buffet great selection foods place doesn't great selection   Again yourself favor walk through place before paying  <EOR> Went Vegas over Memorial Weekend Caesars Palace buffet FIRST VEGAS BUFFET EVER! friends did buffet deal where pay $34 99 ended being around $43 00 everything where any 7? specified buffets Vegas however many times want within 24 hour period  made suffice 3 meals!

But then realized middle restaurant  agree desserts best here!   Service little slow refilling drinks  He'd take plates but wouldn't ask if wanted refill when obviously no more soda left  lady working cashier super slow  glad lot time spare because would sad if didn't into last because lady ringing slowly    Due small selection wouldn't come own  There's enough feel I'd money's worth here  But if you're doing BOB coming desserts good enough! <EOR> this pretty decent buffet   went bfast lunch   plenty variety   banana chips cereal blueberries raspberries omelet station long line meat seafood breads salmon etc  <EOR> Cafe Lago worst buffet among all Harrah's casinos   Yes even worse Imperial Palace   around $13 brucn IP didn't expect much but cafeteria food delivered good omelet    But $25 Lago Buffet would least expect  SOMETHING little just little more   But NOTHING absolutely NOTHING!    There very few selections varieties   Italian station only offered 4 different pasta looked canned food   carving station offered Turkey Prime Rib   Prime Rib prime all   fiance asked end cut   tough he couldn't cut regular knife   guess server said didn't any steak knife!  only thing somewhat edible Roast Chicken     The salad station pretty pathetic no hard boiled eggs beans mushroom celery   heck?  buffet least could offer descent salad bar!    There 3 kind sushi rolls none would even dare touch   Chinese station 3 dishes stir fry shrimp beef fried rice   also 2 different steam buns   dessert station nothing absolutely nothing even looked remotely appetizing!  Give break!  Caesars supposed better if best hotel among Harrah's chain but worst restaurants yes tried few    Lago buffet just proved again     If must buffet because want use your comp food Harrah's take advise Rio's   least edible there   Whoever charge restaurant Caesars should fired!  Whoever runs Lago Buffet Caesars should kicked a$$  <EOR> Food awesome! thinking many people might buffet because smaller most others around strip therefore much selection   But did enjoy actual food more other buffets guess depends your goal is  My husband said best prime rib he's 15 years  All food superb quality  I little disappointed deserts  thought could done better that  looked same desserts all other Harrah's buffets  <EOR> this place does deserve any stars all  boyfriend looking breakfast place ran into one  thought really screw breakfast?
