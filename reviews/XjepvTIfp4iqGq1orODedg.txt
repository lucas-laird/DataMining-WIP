Philly Cheesesteak Another hit  Big plenty meat lots melted cheese  Fries Thick hot crispy  Perfect!  CONS It's little way weird neighborhood  They don't hostess stand when walk somewhat confusing if your first time  worse if busy because waitresses occupied end just standing middle dining room walking around really sure where sit ask table  Once notice though they're pretty good seating right away just awkward first few minutes  Just thought I'd mention that  haha! <EOR> 30 minutes take order four kegs unheard of  grew Vegas eating 35 years once ever complain service food  Then top waitress working July 6th 7pm back dining area see's fit take order table showed us  She doesn't refill drinks now 1 hour  attitude horrible  medium fingers just finally arrived almost plain barely any sauce them  even worth sending back  writing happens  hour five minutes no joke she shows wife's Stromboli says  right? which reply no ordered philly cheese steak  Wow  disappointment just keeps rolling in  now sitting no dinner hour ten minutes in  disappointed four kegs  Thanks Lauren never again bring family dinner  <EOR> $20 small Stromboli order hot wings enough few leftovers two aren't really hungry    'Boli okay surprised made Triple D but considering inside bar quality flavor lot better expected  Wings ordered hot but tasted mild didn't side ranch oddly chunky inside takeout box which made warm more unappealing   Service quick  Order phone ready 15 minutes take your order receipt bar pay any tip leave card given cash take directly kitchen staff when pick your meal   I don't think better food dive casino appreciate they're open take phone in orders 24 7 but isn't place likely seek out  <EOR> Good food  coming few years now  Staff nice but sometimes slow  great lunch specials  <EOR> I only eaten inside 1 time but order take all time  calzones possibly best thing ever eaten  perfect! Also service pretty good even hour in <EOR> Dive bar sports good beer GREAT food  After seeing all food network shows decided stop in!

Great place watch football  <EOR> Stromboli Four Kegs huge enough feed 3 people  choice filling just Pizza Calzone  Stromboli Meatball nice flaky huge tender meatballs  server funny helpful price very reasonable  Try it AW <EOR> Environment ok  Dining area very tight table sticky  Waitress didn't write order down came back table 3 times repeat order  Then call back refills drinks  Booths need re cushioned really worn out  <EOR> Went because DDD  Definitely hole wall  would recommend place if hungry thirsty  imagine drinks very strong  food though definitely bar fair come expecting culinary adventure  If come starved then food portions definitely satisfy   I ordered Boli supposed ordered turkey cheese one  little disappointed because although dough delicious filling just cheese turkey did satisfy me   maybe some spinach something? <EOR> I came Sicilian pizza  huge part pizza scene northeast PA where moved from  didn't think would find all west when came across place Yelp try pizza   It's super easy 95  plaza there's plenty parking  If happen during day expect see nothing few seconds when walk because pretty dark  dated homey looking inside typical most dive bars  However personally felt kind bar would attached someone's house  dug inside vibe   I directed order kitchen counter 10 minute wait  bad  waited longer some places  Paid bar bartender asked if wanted drink declined  home finally taste it  smell spot accustomed to  taste very similar but exact  think cheese  ordered extra cheese won't next time  also think might use American cheese? Shame if  case  cheese takes away flavor but overall would definitely again  recommend getting onions  sauce expected sweet but actually pretty spot on   Everyone else reviewing stromboli which sure good but more needs said Sicilian pizza  <EOR> Came famous Stromboli definitely did disappoint  ordered full size meatball but only able eat half  huge! sure other menu choices but sure all good  service fast staff friendly  FYI stromboli half off midnight  <EOR> Love place much! food great! Granted kinda dive bar ambiance isn't great  smoke but restaurant portion sealed off you're eating smelling smoke same time!

Why not? guy just unleashed angry fury foulest language ever heard any employee ever telling why he wasn't allowed anymore  Every other word f word any all other variation f word along some other belligerent ignorant things he could say  Apparently he pissed off last time ex he only gambled 50 cents per hand something      he accused scamming on   so two start arguing because boyfriend then speaks defend himself keeps escalating escalating     I then finally try intervene say Why speaking that? asked he thought he talking that   He then says again but now putting it   yous aren't allowed anymore   Dude don't even f'ing know dude    then say always come sit back order pizza   he then Yeah yous come order your cheap f'ing pizza     and blah blah blah    this course zero sense 'cause why offer special if going accuse your patrons being cheap when order it    then asked if he manager   he then lied said yes    my ex giving finger several times face saying F*** off asked owner? Again he lied said yes  know owner's names Mario  without warning guy then starts shutting door standing doorway  mean he literally hitting door close it  could injured what? am seriously considering pressing battery charges against guy because it You don't behave way then try assault door? Here's thing right tell banned your property reasons but certainly don't come off talking people such belligerent way unprovoked  just came pizza working if problem then address calm matter that  far trying close door  wasn't if trying force way in  just standing during argument guy started moment he opened door off  All should camera if establishment tapes on  can't imagine having employee talks treats patrons way  Now understand if came messing other patrons acting complete fools but didn't  mad cause someone didn't play $1 25 per hand last time there?  Wow   and oh last thing  He tried involve other bartender yelling Such such doesn't he always bring cheap ass this? Well bartender knows always friendly wouldn't even answer  He just looked over could tell he wanted no parts behavior  Anyway course never set foot place ever again sure let all friends family this  Why spend your money place where employees allowed behave such way?  far battery charges I don't know  still seriously considering it   don't take kindly being assaulted doors  <EOR> This update previous review   back Four Kegs many times  Every time excellent  If keep coming back almost every time  town love food 5 stars!
