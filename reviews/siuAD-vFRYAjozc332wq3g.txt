Portobello also nicely done  Salads crisp flavored well  Smoked salmon fine but    you can't wrong unless bad salmon  Carne asada fries good you're gonna get  tuna good ceviche average  Pork belly eggs benedict little flavor but eggs nice   Okay  less great  FIRST let preface saying everybody VERY nice  restaurant pretty new opened November 2016 first Mother's Day they've done  understand struggles  When sat down table immediately noticed tons trash everywhere  empty food packets applesauce jars used napkins broken candles scrap papers literally half eaten giant ball cotton candy I kid not! all around under table  notified waitress she said Oh! baby yesterday! Which fine   except yesterday  Like   they all night morning clean crap up  whatever    Also waited 20 minutes just utensils napkins  first seating day precisely 11 00 AM  just saying literally all morning your tables ready time opening so   you know   get them ready  Because 11 AM should come surprise you   So typical good waitering means if see empty plate grab it  If see empty glass fill it  But guys arent great that  waiter only stopped twice way took orders without taking single 7 empty plates table away him  great   keep asking more drinks because just weren't good refilling them  But again nice just   really want them well!   We also kept getting food *didn't* order weren't getting food *had* ordered  weird  feel good number people working! think just need learn process better   Also some reviews mentioned service slow  true well  fast eaters but must stayed 2 5 hours because food coming fast enough  Which also means behind reservations because just could turn tables time  heard people complaining pretty loudly  food came good  just took while come   So yes  I'd come back! hope when revise rating something higher  Lots kinks work front end  <EOR> Wow greatest dish ever golden truffle egg salad  also seabass which also World please disappointed   lived Las Vegas 37 years best meal ever had  go  <EOR> First time amazing besides fact waiter gave least amount service since boyfriend young  Talking 19 21 year olds He spent most time older people  Food amazing  Second time different waiter still gave least amount service but actually knew menu  time $53 meat EXTREMELY chewy couldn't bare take another bite even sent back cook little more but no point because completely ruined meat  asked Medium received Medium rare but leaning more towards rare  difficult even cut into   The chef works Friday night's amazing  Tuesday night other hand    don't know  am almost convinced same people  <EOR> Amazing food amazing view amazing service!
