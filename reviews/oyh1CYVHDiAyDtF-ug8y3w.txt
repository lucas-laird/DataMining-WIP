Also if see long line somewhere pressed time WHY would line then fire off nasty gram Yelp it?!  Here's take it Dole Whip spot on  101 degrees outside still proper frozen consistency flavors great  place clean even restroom girl working Thursday afternoon very nice efficient  signs advising crepes made scratch take some time  Another red flag uber important people simply can't wait line  glad moved close definitely back! <EOR> The Dole whip float hit spot  Delicious refreshing  Thanks bringing Las Vegas  staff courteous clean  <EOR> We came last Saturday afternoon peak 100 degree weather great decision come try famous pineapple dole whip  Simply awesome! Refreshing sweet course delicious pineapple  sure try pineapple upside down next visit LV August  Customer service little two dimensional side but cares right? Kids kids they'd rather somewhere else working  little hesitant reading bad reviews jeez owner sure chases all negative ones  Kind poor taste she should thicker skin but again cares  place worth stop  Just don't expect 5 star customer service  <EOR> Saw Eater Las Vegas     drove over soon entered employees welcoming knowledgeable giving suggestion going above  beyond your visit  enjoyable   tried dole whip swirl mango strawberry coconut pineapple   good portions refreshing filling   very busy yet everyone taken care kept all orders very happy doing it   see much any more   <EOR> Ok start did show 18minutes closing girl working made sure knew 18 minutes close  asked dole whip served inside pineapple she quickly tried talking outta it    probably because now 16 minutes closing  just container planned  dole whip good but service horrible  only because located outta way but won't back just because service  <EOR> Went pineapple park first time other day since friend told dole whips dippin' dots there  initially very excited since rarely see dole whips outside Disneyland Disney world mention son big sucker dippin' dots decided drive over picked son school nice little surprise  dole whip good  good flavor just disney's dippin dot's well dippin' dots  No complaints food aspect! However must say customer service extremely lacking  came no else girl behind counter just gave cold icy look nary greeting  tried nice polite but she very aloof almost felt inconveniencing being there  said thank course she gave back change ice cream once did hear peep her  just uncomfortable    Also read some reviews before actually trying place replies business owner made very off putting  almost feels she overly defensive over littlest critiques some if most reviews  wish they'd train employees more proper customer service  don't all peppy cheery but little smile sure long way! <EOR> Dropped today while vacation dole gluten diary free fix  Friendly atmosphere great customer service wanted try few flavors no problem all offering few tasters  other kid dip n' dots old school coke bottles! definitely come back next time am town  <EOR> Awesome!!!!!

The service tad slow only person working Saturday afternoon   My friends pineapple float which liked lot !!! But float pretty small compared mine theirs little pricier I pineapple vanilla soft serve worker gave huge portion!!! Totally worth 5 bucks ! However between two flavors just liked pineapple tastes just Disneyland! definitely would skip vanilla next time   This place relatively far strip would need drive but worth if you're craving some Disneyland pineapple dole whip! <EOR> Finally tried place because  nothing else Sunday night late hours plus friend shared dole whip both own crepes  While waited ordered played Connect Four board game collection  Bohemia  Bri Berry alright wouldn't come back though but let's face it    there's no close crepe place southern highlands  dole whip reminded Disneyland if ever miss Disney dolewhip  know where go  think place last other dessert places Southern Highlands Dairy Queen Cold stone froyo  place all but memory ?

So essentially really only getting half paid because center completely empty  Therefore cannot recommend place   Once again don't think problem employee employees dealt but problem lack training management lack oversight management  place does potential successful however just don't see being around much longer if continues down path  <EOR> Huge servings!  half pineapple half raspberry couldn't even finish it   definitely back often  <EOR> My son love place something everyone family  kid loves dole whip nostalgically love circus animal ice cream Thrifty  also waffles crepes colder months but down ice cream all year around  Oh there's icee here!!!
