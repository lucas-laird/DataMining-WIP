We still tried brought but money paid $8 95 per would rather gone Zaytoon's Durango Twain  This place sorry excuse restaurant  <EOR> Excellent if craving some something different  Staff extremely friendly portions well worth price   The Combination Platter excellent starter cant wrong any kebob dishes winners   The only thing holding back 5 stars Samosa isn't exactly used sorry say but bit bland side  <EOR> Sadly place no longer there   closed true lover Middle Eastern food great place give 5 stars honor its memory! food amazing ordered menu but killer buffet array stews    and favorite discoveries Bouranee Baunjan!  Eggplant stewed tomatos peppers sauce yogurt   now myself place used lot oil dishes maybe  why tasty    hope they've just moved really haven't shut good   Vegas does large selection Middle Eastern restaurants  <EOR> I drove randomly caught Kabob sign corner eye  starving but decided would worth waiting food cook  say best decision life!   ordered mixed kabob chicken shami minced meat   shami kabob spiced just right meat Halal boot  guy actually orders meat California  prices perfect well  don't need spend lot money eat well good time   The Persian Afghani staff very welcoming     Definitely try spot when Vegas! <EOR> Very controversial reviews read   eaten years ago no problems other restaurant always quiet   glad they're still open     office lunch ordered 9  right 9 different items could share lamb shwarma mediterranean salad kebab combo falafel plate chix salad sausage plate greek salad 2 other unidentifiable plates ate everyone put order all ate smorgasbord style    Although some commented some plates looked strange unfamiliar all agreed all good   Main standouts hummus baba ganoush ground beef meat kebaby strip thing   No complaints despite many being dye hard McD Taco fans but course tell 'em change good especially Mediterranean!! <EOR> I give solid three stars don't see anything wrong it  place painfully average  Decent gyro good hummus friendly efficient service   This go to place when mood gyro plain simple  <EOR> I based couple reviews expecting something fabulous   food really good! Four stars food but two service equals three star review   wrong?  took 45 min's couple pita sandwiches only ones when order came wrong!  friend while ate mine   Don't wrong food really good would probably back but come people please order right speed service little! Maybe somebody should tell them leave Yelp card let them know love food but service needs improved! <EOR> Are freakin' kidding me? can't see place could possibly more star  fact if could give ZERO stars  I'd do   Terrible service  someone having big screaming match back turned music try drown them out   Tough disgusting dry overcooked excuse lamb kabob sides weren't any better    Decor = 1  Service = 1  Screaming match = 5  Food = 1  If want good kabobs way better places go   Yuck   Place seems under new ownership location looked different  wonder if past review confused locale if is  <EOR> I thought food good price  combination platter  <EOR> I decided check place see all fuss about   Four reasons bother 1  Despite being strip mall intersection two major roads close several upscale neighborhoods Palace completely empty 12 30 weekday   Never good sign   Guess place doesn't lot lunch business    2  lamb kabobs which dry gamey overcooked deer meat   Meh   3  decor leaves much desired food leaves much desired service slow grumpy   Did wake them midafternoon siesta?    4  Even Olive Garden more variety more consistency more pleasant atmosphere better value     With many better options Vegas why would come here?  Oh  right   No does  <EOR> The place very average but food good  away dinner two under $30 tip  If you're into atomosphere trendiness you  If you're snob want good food fair price good place    I don't reccomend if first date you're trying impress  <EOR> This update previous review happy say wasn't disappointed   This time Poker Widows' Night two friends   Two I them Lamb Kabobs incredible lean tender juicy perfectly seasoned    previous visit ordered rice salad other intending share both   waitress offered kitchen divide when plates came if weren't sharing all each much rice perfectly cooked salad fresh full variety stuff together substantial portion lamb each took home enough second full meal   The other friend Israeli comfort food   She hankering Liver Onions   If she hadn't would another 5 star rating   But liver way overcooked she didn't it   She did however love hummus which ordered single side dish but appetizer   huge portion $4 50  It costs more when ordered alone but who'd just order hummus?    I agree XX when he she said walk can't tell whether they're open    fairly late sure closed  until walked in   don't see bad omen though just owner needs neon OPEN sign   Vegas ferchrissake there's sure no shortage neon had!  I'll going back Kebob Palace but stick chicken especially lamb   Kebob   Kebob Palace   sure won't ordering liver   anywhere  <EOR> This 4 22 2009 inadvertently posted review Kabob Express   Had qabili yogurt mint  Qabili very nice though much lamb it  served beef split pea stew which warm hot small bowl cucumber tomato salad  Yogurt mint dip rather thin  Service slow always despite small number customers  Good value though $18 so <EOR>
