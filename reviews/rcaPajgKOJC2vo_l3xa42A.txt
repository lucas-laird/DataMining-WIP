I personally clients drinks water set food table continually ask dedicated wait staff help clients   Maybe implied tip means don't provide any real service?  addition shoved bill front while mid conversation clients demanding paid     To all worse tried address event planner she basically slammed door us   guess once she gets paid she could care less!!!  I highly recommend management involved kinds interactions ensure clients well taken care of!!!  For customer paid 7k ish lunch dinners would expect significantly better service clients!    Truly disappointing embarrassing experience highly recommend going elsewhere! <EOR> Comfortable high end bistro   Nice outdoor area ideal breakfast   Adored sweetbreads can't moule frites late night dinner  <EOR> Came parents couple years ago enjoyed very much  restaurant beautiful service good well  front house well saw back seemed very professional    As far bistro food suspect place good gets Vegas  Other baguettes pistachios don't remember eating anything noteworthy appetizer but entree ordered grilled Atlantic salmon veggies  enjoyed gamy flavor fish but main reason ordered because wanted sample style cooking fish shown Thomas Keller's Bouchon cookbook  only grilled side side being browned well done other side left completely raw  gives interesting texture fish enjoyed it  entree noticed big oyster bar ordered some Kumamoto oysters which very good well   Recommended  <EOR> The best french food ever had!

First off waiter aka Steve Martin look wierd humor didn't really fly ambience all   kind classy restaurants don't offer bread plate?   staff keep coming over scrape bread crumbs sure some crumbs ended bag since hanging side   start drinks say rip off? 14$ cocktail expected little larger martini glass beer should larger cup !! tasted bad though portions much small   move onto entrees   special fish     for $45 would expected some more side dishes something !    fish chewy dry rrellu needed more sauce piece small only few pieces veggieson side   still hungry that   husband ordered lamb   only came 5 thinly sliced pieces! Taste only so  Most ordered steak don't think any complaints those     But again $45 could filet versus skirt steak ? Overall home $125 bill two unimpressed overrated food   Plan fill bread unless you're ordering steak  <EOR> Bouchon definitely best place breakfast Vegas You come try least once  Breakfast only available 7 10 30am  brunch only available during weekends until 2pm   I Boudin Blanc $15 which comes delicious special blend sausage sweet citrus sauce scramble eggs fresh crossiant side  Sound simple but sever guaranteed  never anything before  she right   Bouchon perfected taste every single items served  sauce butter even peach jam incredible!

While waiter seemed pleasant capable timing service off offputting  long intervals between courses   food uneven     It seems Bouchon trying anymore     It $180 two feel well rewarded lackadaisical service so so food   really hope just resting laurels but  seemed me   Maybe give them another chance but since many dining alternatives Las Vegas probably won't  <EOR> Eh  sure food fantastic everyone says but hard time appreciating because service pretty terrible  Say you're Applebees Lawrence Kansas   then might surprised wait 40 minutes your FIRST drink hour half before ANY food aside bread arrives your table way would totally fine if drinks speedily delivered plentiful  they not   buzzkill your server forgets bring glass wine ordered your dinner your soup delivered without spoon wait good five minutes watching cold before someone walks buy could spoon everytime anyone put anything down your table wrong seat   But wasn't Applebees weren't Kansas  Thumbs down Bouchon  <EOR> I stayed Venetian Hotel girls ate breakfast restaurant 3 times   love it   food good atmosphere cool  <EOR> Service 8 10  Food 9 10  Truffled Mac cheese amazing!

In short nostalgic meal full French favorites ! <EOR> We dinner Christmas Day  very busy but yet service superb  4 expecting service little sluggish given holidays  said pretty safe say come place anytime year still best service  If visit try Specialties  guarantee leave restaurant happy satisfied  Oh save room desserts! <EOR> Bouchon Poor Man's French Laundry   I dined hopes tasting Chef Thomas Keller's creativity  But unfortunately French Bistro nothing really gets wild here   My motto place Simple Food Cooked Perfection    The food overpriced but Vegas all food overpriced   The dishes absolutely Delicious seasoned perfection  hardy cafe fare would seen Paris    It's classy place Raw bar where 19 year old culinary students shuck oysters all day    Recommended all money throw around good dining experience  <EOR> Bouchon those places Vegas show people back home pictures brag living fancy lifestyle Vegas just because Vegas  beautiful inside directly outside it  They're connected outside gardens Venetian beautiful flowers pool along really pretty gazebo  Just down hallway bit lounge near second front desk amazing architecture design really feel you're America anymore but instead Europe  may bit pricey but you're still getting great food amazing service definitely worth price tag if you're paying $20+ brunch   I've two items menu before both delicious  baguette smoked salmon capers  pretty standard choice when sure else get  flavorful just good combination always  But if want something more ordinary should definitely look Chicken Waffles  never waffle meant chicken! your typical buttermilk waffles  best combination savory waffle chicken where batter waffle mixed bacon chives! Doesn't just your mouth water?!? perfect! crispy outside perfectly fluffy inside  chicken deliciously well whole combination roasted good taste yet didn't burn any parts it  sauce comes chicken bit salty well if order some fries dip into too  definitely recommendation two items   They also serve some bread shaped most unique possible way  looks bunch leaves strung together basically break off leaves  bit hard since seems bit over crispy don't expect much that  But other bread still good think very artistically appealing eyes rather teeth you're going use crunch through tough break shell!  In short beautiful location beautiful presentations amazingly delicious food wonderful atmosphere  If need brag people high life Vegas need visit place least once  <EOR> Pretty good overall     Excellent chicken but highlight SUPERB wine recommendation resident wine guy [there special name people which never remember  ] favorite bottle wine EVER soon find label [they peeled label off bottle gave me] post communal enjoyment!    star off Absinthe disaster telling bartender de wormwooded Absinthe undrinkable because tastes pure anise  bartender SWORE excellent tasting version he WRONG! repeat enjoy drinking pure anise extract even ample sugar water added!

server just didn't seem very good job  Maybe he having off day caught weeds   but honestly think case he's just bad waiter    Started nice platter oysters  didn't sick  good  expected them to    My dining companion roast chicken which really delicious well done  Chicken usually most boring things order any restaurant menu but exception  If you've always wanted try those flavorful moist classic French roast chickens you've heard good place start  trout almandine quality  Simply prepared liked it  rhubarb cake dessert tasty   This first visit back Bouchon gone several times few years ago  Prior always breakfast lunch  less crowded quieter those times  However service never especially good suffers endemic Strip celeb chef phoning tourists problem    I'd recommend going lunch breakfast especially during week if swing it avoiding weekend dinner setting your expectations food certainly service all high  <EOR> I vacillated between four five stars place due fact when hold all restaurant experiences food fits more into four star but when compare other Vegas dining experiences clear five five is!  Basically just really nice place great menu superb service delicious food   started oysters half shell which excellently shucked wonderfully fresh  Moved two salads blue cheese walnuts other warm goat cheese over dressed greens which both executed well complimented fresh chewy delicious bread    For entrees husband lamb chicken  also opted sides mushrooms mac cheese  Everything excellent however mushrooms over salted  Considering wasn't theme meal won't hold against them    All accompanied nice inexpensive bottle white wine which served presented if $300 bottle  kind service always indicator well run restaurant attentive staff  Overall cost meal expensive but very very fairly priced when got    After visiting wide array places Vegas would recommend place must! <EOR> Thomas Keller's Las Vegas version Bouchon pretty much Las Vegas version Napa Valley eatery   bright massive pretty swanky Las Vegas Hotel Casino   The hostesses little spacey they seemed trainees but very nice technically didn't run into any difficulties being seated   even dialed Pinot Brasserie could call cancel reservations   Food wise satisfied   Four stars satisfied   think little harder restaurant scoring because dined lot places Asia America pretty good idea fabulous dining   Although party did sample much hyped raw shellfish selections did take time notice prep display area   large sushi kitchen circular glass case two I think sous chefs working away   Given critical rating four stars well earned   server quirky but knowledgeable   sommalier friendly very helpful pretentious word would use any part experience even though service presentation nearly first class   An old french favorite mine always French onion soup   Yup old reliable   commonplace [it] definitely fair share screwed FOS   Bouchon does screw up   Both required cheeses adequately layered baked top   broth salty but moisture drenching perfect amount breading   This review dining experience exactly week ago entree little fuzzy I'm sick right now    remember definitely wanted chicken but definitely didn't sauce compatible allergen list   waiter switched sauce used duck sauce which worked quite well fuzzy memory happiness content   Although salads should bullet proof  weak ruined remember being impressed ingredients presentation   As wrap would definitely recommend restaurant anyone looking reliable fine dining establishment away noise crush Venetian restaurant row anyone mission sample establishments America's finest chefs across America   Bouchon Las Vegas let down  <EOR> Was staying venetian checked place out  heard lots good things before   But overall impressed much    Started w Beignets de Brandade de Morue  insides mashed cod potato  creamy tasted heavier mushy soft fish cake  bad  However outer breading beignet pretty eye crunchy perfection  But tasted extremeeely salty bitter  Just ate filling    Had steak frites meal medium rare flatiron steak good size   Steak decent w bleu cheese top which delish! French fries accompanied meat extremely salty no joke!     Wasn't awful but definitely nothing stand out  Maybe return try LA  <EOR> I think Bouchon those places eat least once while Vegas   know Vegas mouth watering cuisine every corner but something special Bouchon     The first time dined Bouchon 6 other people reservation 8 30pm   service painfully slow but Steak Frites buttery tender forgot almost took 45 minutes served   server also spilled sauce all over friend's purse jacket while clearing plates but he very apologetic   I revisited few days ago 6 30pm reservation 13 people   Even though eating early appealing most folks substantially better experience   service point drinks refilled constantly food came timely manner   tried mussels sauce die for   wish could just sop all sauce yummy bread   Overall think Bouchon quality food very reasonable prices $20 $45    Definitely better any over priced Vegas buffet! <EOR> This maybe 7th time eating here  took group last night superb!

The fries also pretty great well although fries other Bouchon tiny bit better  can't put finger different but wasn't glaring would still order fries again   In terms level service felt Bouchon run more regular restaurant instead amazing Yountville   waiter friendly but seemed disappear bit checking once food arrived   He brought check good time no pressure leave rush but wait while come back take credit card   understand he probably busy don't blame personally    However mildly irritated because lots other staff 4 5 people walked saw holding bill credit card ignored me  other Bouchon don't think would happened since all waitstaff worked seamless team all extremely aware any customers Please help look faces  no sense you're section therefore you're customer felt most normal restaurants  course grand scheme things big deal all but people Bouchon much food service visit fell short both  <EOR> I would highly recommend visiting restaurant  sea food appetizer fresh drinks refilled waited 3 hours receive entrees which heavily salted  Bad service bad food  <EOR> Very disappointing Thomas Keller   plates every course came different times much 10 minutes later!

First never gnocchi   first time fellow diners gnocchi unless French gnocchi confused disappointed   waiter time talked people dining gnocchi she should forever debt   For starters cod brandade which excellent olives which lovely herbal note them charcuterie platter which little much sausage but just wonderful   We then salads warmed goat cheese which provided nice sweetness bitterness salad  touch fennel dressing which also brought sweetness dish   very well balanced salad     My dinner flap steak special  thickness filet but double size actual steak  tender filet but juicy rib eye   fantastic cut meat though swiss chard bed sat rather salty side   We all desserts most getting chocolate mousse  personally creme caramel but table also shared tarte citron which probably best dessert offered up   highly reccommend going sure good waiter  service fantastic!

Pure simple server!! don't recall telling name but receipt says Vikas G    The food between good wonderful depending upon dish   The cheese danish croissant perfection! Four dined those two ordered American breakfast which all agreed really come Bouchon for  quality American breakfast good value but quite disappointedly scrambled eggs dry I would expect   rest American breakfast very good quality but very basic food  nothing added special different   The other dishes ordered eggs Benedict Lamb Merguez hash eggs ordered poached     As would hope hollandaise perfect! Velvety smooth light balance flavors between butter lemon yolk   eggs beautifully poached both dishes remotely over cooked  white tender but runny yolk thickly runny The Benedict Hash point pastries simply fantastic    We contemplated ordering more pastries but waiter told should them take out Bouchon Bakery ground level hotel because he said would even larger selection  Although did recall seeing such grand selection when earlier morning picking coffee took word it  But only did room large selection did even carry pastries wanted take home  They sold asked    This final insult added injury he quite rude beginning being seated  Yes later but latest reservation brunch but if don't want serve people time then don't take reservation   He irritated when asked Parmesan cheese to help those dry scrambled eggs   person chef understands restaurant kitchen environment requested if he could fried egg poached egg  He would requested place busy but quite slow point knew easy request  server said no but then he said he would check but he really thought no  Next food two fried eggs  server did come back ask which way eggs should prepared if would both same   He just seemed irritated fact there  Between American breakfasts just good experience price    There just many other fine dining options Vegas LA justify going back being treated that  <EOR> I am huge Thomas Keller fan first visit Bouchon Bistro locations  did disappoint  omelette day smoked salmon red onion white cheddar caviar hollandaise well corned beef hash  Both excellent  also pastry basket selected 4 pastries scone plain croissant strawberry almond croissant pecan sticky bun  plain croissant pecan sticky bun fine but overwhelming any sense  Honestly having croissant Tartine San Francisco think anything comparatively underwhelming  scone strawberry almond croissant die  scone dry all almost cake never anything unique strawberry almond croissant  would back just those two pastires   As case Thomas Keller food service stellar can't wait back  Also if visit Vegas location ask sit outside! <EOR> Came dinner   would rate food 4 stars but service great give 5   big group over 15 people everyone great time   server very helpful selection food choices beverage choices made experience very enjoyable  <EOR> When girls suggested dinner Bouchon immediately jumped board  became avid Thomas Keller fan trip French Laundry last October despite astronomical price tag  Thus eager try Keller's more affordable restaurant Bouchon   Bouchon Las Vegas located 10th floor Venetian  Luckily staying 12th floor walking restaurant only took few minutes  location itself?

Anyone minimal sense food would know would soak shelf fish water let them spill sand before serving it   I didn't bother saying anything else finished meal still gave good tip end but experience famous Thomas Keller restaurant just 1 star   Would back?

And now husband must try other restaurant French Laundry! <EOR> When found Thomas Keller restaurant Vegas excited try place out  heard great things French Laundry but still chance visit next best option  Unfortunately meal only mediocre when compared others its class    When dine fine upper echelon restaurants try compare others same class  many fine restaurants including Alinea Brooklyn Fare Per se Le Bernadin just name few  believe know good food great food is  meal good would definitely eat again but don't think really stands city boasts restaurants Robuchon Guy Savoy Nobu Gordon Ramsay    The restaurant little difficult find take special elevator there  sure give yourself plenty time find place don't hesitate ask directions if lost  walk into restaurant pass oyster bar where see chefs preparing seafood platters look amazing but did partake  seated given menus looked printed butcher paper  really wasn't impressed know going more casual feel but more expecting more traditional menus given Thomas Keller name    They didn't tasting menu something really wishing ordered la carte  food average fine dining establishment service par good  hoping off day would come back again but given many different restaurants Vegas area may sometime before return  <EOR> This 2nd visit Bouchon absolutely love food service here  started off steak tartare decent  steak cut nicely but thought could used little more acid just bring flavors  also salmon rillete escargot which amazing  salmon rillete flaky chunks salmon bold flavor  escargot sat pool garlic shallots butter topped bite size puff pastries  simply delicious    I muscles white wine garlic saffron broth best tasking white wine muscle dish ever had  Although muscles bit small garlicky saffron wine broth made lack meat  Oh frites     goodness! good ask waitress take them away me  Otherwise would finished them all crispy salty goodnes  give hefty portion frites each dish ware    One more thing and its going hard      try fill hot crispy outside chewy inside baguette give beginning  always try eat much but yet succeed  <EOR> Idk maybe eas off day   waffles werent good remember   chicken above avg but waffles seriously disappointed    Truffles fries must  <EOR> I expecting lot more Thomas Keller   While meal definitely enjoyable far far cry transcendental   avoid chicken dishes plague except French restaurants Poulet Roti fine but just fine   Nothing really popped out chicken just fresh enough flavor just inspired enough presentation just interesting enough   Eh   Service great however oysters   But meal expensive warrant positive impressions    <EOR> We seated outside fountain  Excellent ambience   The steak awesome!!! Oysters wonderful too  <EOR> Food fine  Service slow terrible  Very disappointed because best meal lives few years ago brought friends because it  sure ever back  should known something once waiter asked if any time constraints  He completely ignored us  served bread before even ordered  appetizers came before cocktails ordered well before them  water filler found them waiting bar while  waiter once asked food was  almost 3 hours  He never asked drink refills track down order anything  wanted dessert but tired didn't want wait another hour take order then forget window while  waiter odd asked salads he said something weird wanting sell many salads table he could sell desserts instead  He upsold husband truffle upgrade fries  came without truffles he fixed error but he them 3O minutes rest food then still charged full price  Very very disappointed service such upscale place  expect much more if going spend kind money  best service water filler kept searching food drinks waiter couldn't bothered worry about  <EOR> As checked into Venetian hella peeps saying just Bouchon brunch I'd thank them later  Eh no thank friends!  It all right way better though   I omelet which nice   nothing blow skirt up  brioche toast should delightful buttery but wasn't  side Lyonnaise potatoes good  not great We raspberry beignets basically glorified jelly donuts  YAWN  Best part orange juice! Best probably ever had   We enjoyed pastries small kiosk more enjoyed brunch restaurant  agree others stating place overrated   It really pretty though  <EOR> Really disappointed being asked ID tonight Bouchon when paid check   eaten more 50 times last 10 years won't EVER going back   explanation Mr  Adelson required entire hotel lame   Point sale credit card fraud restaurants almost nonexistent sort voter ID fraud    sorry when paying $500 dinner insulting ask someone drivers license   pay bill IHOP ID    why should Bouchon?  Decent restaurant but million other options strip treat more respect  <EOR> If you're specifically looking French style brunch very heavy food place be  If plan doing anything else rest your day probably best idea   I ordered Croque Madame definitely very tasty  Full rich flavor  But man hours later felt walking around brick stomach  True French form or least stereotype really pack many heavy calories possible into small mass food  wife huge fan both bread pudding french toast combo both menu big hit right? Same issue though she said just over top sweetness heaviness   Granted more kind food review but hopefully above description give better idea you're getting into  glad tried but don't think going back  service also very spotty which hardly ever care but time pretty glaring  times felt forgot even simple things menu providing bread butter jelly put table taking order getting check etc  Tthough very sharp refilling waters give them that  <EOR> This first 3 reviews hopefully post Thomas Keller's Restaurants   While probably least popular culinary trifecta Bouchon vegas yountville French Laundry Per Se starting off restaurant nothing ashamed of   If scroll down Seth W 's review also party 12 drank absinthe easily best dining experiences life good food good drink excellent company     The first thing showed quality restaurant excellent attentive wait staff   Starting off very knowledgeable waiter else explain why castrated chicken more tasty juicy?

He did recommend anything menu seemed occupied other things  never refill water no came table ask food  took even longer check track down another server check out    The food VERY disappointing well  Moules au Safran et à la  Moutarde side Pommes frites  mussels no flavor did even come any bread  frites great but wrong anyways?   completely unsatisfied meal ready done brunch  am all paying good meal but if service top notch worth all! <EOR> Our most recent visit vegas staying Venetian decided Bouchon brunch  party 6 7 wait 10 minutes which wasn't bad   We seated waitress gave run down menu daily specials  She friendly came back around multiple times during meal refill coffees water  also gave French bread before meal quite good   crispy outside chewy inside  looking over menu ordered smoked salmon Benedict  food came 10 15 minutes which pretty standard  Benedict eggs poached perfectly sauce nice creamy clumpy all  Although entree great tried some other food friends ordered such steak hash which turned pretty bland pricier side  All all experience pretty good  server really attentive needs quick everything  food kind hit miss especially price point but I'd come back next time visit  <EOR> Came brunch  Best waffles ever!!!

I ordered Duck Confit entree could more disappointed  should luscious little plate dry also over salted  did manage skin crisped OK   Who over salts French cuisine??? Apparently Thomas Keller does   Sounds American style brunch would safer bet  would return restaurant  Overall NONE real appeal true French Bistro    which would excellent simply prepared food good price  <EOR> Was recommended restaurant cousin   My bf sat large window overlooking garden outside  Really pretty view  restaurant gives off dont try hard vibe  cozy but cozy  classy but classy  somehow casual too    but casual  pt  lets its food speak itself  kinda sometimes  Anyway Two things remember place 1  bread which DIVINEE! Flaky outside soft inside  Perfection! 2  scallops  OMG   BEST scallops ive life trust lot scallops  just melted mouth  tender cooked perfectly  well put together dish but honestly scallops good could held own   Everything else forgettable but remember delicious  hardly remember appetizers sides desserts  think bf's entree salmon but sadly limped shadows scallop  <EOR> This second time dining here   past dinner impressed   But brunch lot!  My bf arrived 12 30pm Sunday during 4th July weekend    bad don't allow reservation weekend brunches waited 40 minutes seated     We ordered Chicken Waffles amazing!  chicken done perfectly tender juicy!  waffles?  TWO THUMBS UP!     Omelette day omelette just OK Good but nothing special   The biggest stand house bread   Haha    yup bread GOOD especially raspberry jam butter   VERY GOOD COMBINATION!  Service good but kinda slow   waited 30 minutes food come out        It very good idea wait long especially when sitting outside during day!  Overall still love Bouchon   definitely come back when visit Vegas again! <EOR> My chicken superb but table's steaks slightly overcooked  Ambiance great although service bit slow server super friendly helpful  return next time Vegas  Breakfast sounds divine  <EOR> Excellent dinner   muscles skirt steak sweet corn bacon fries   dessert lemon tart sorbet   Outstanding   back! <EOR> We loved dinner much came back very next meal breakfast!

Luckily vegetarian wasn't nuts if she accidentally ate meat but mix something food allergy would disastrous    The pate very disappointing  served glass jar side crusty bread  When say crusty mean really really cut yourself biting into type crusty  boyfriend actually sustained cut bread  pate itself salty layer something resembled congealed fat over definitely consistent color    The chicken waffles came boat gravy well maple syrup  waffle AMAZING perfectly crisp light everything waffle should be  chicken decent but seasoning unremarkable thus nothing write home about  ate chicken dipped gravy which made bit more satiating taste buds   The waiter never came back ask food Overall expected much more Bouchon  may back give dinner shot but probably am never going come Bouchon brunch again unless dragged kicking screaming friends  <EOR> If could sum place word BOMBTASTIC!

I asked if initially but first bartender said transferred cup later   Didn't realize when would transferred later albeit another bartender cups only    I walk food over Sands showroom needed transport drinks food without any spillage factor in    Fancy restaurant   Need fancy customer service regardless much tipped them    That's separates good restaurants bad one  <EOR> Oh Bouchon heard many great things certainly didn't disappoint  While didn't think service particularly stellar or bad food certainly top notch   We started off {CHEESE PLATE} all cheeses delicious included some fresh honey really delightful  ordered  {SALADE DE POMMES POCHEES} share which pretty sweet more dessert but all still really enjoyed but probably could saved dessert course instead salad plate  dinner ordered {STEAK DIANE} which absolutely mouthwatering good cooked perfection some diane sauce really want some more just thinking it   To round off dinner ended {CREME BRUELE} {MAISON AU CHOCOLATE} perfect sweetness end off night  <EOR> Loved Bouchon  wonderful french brasserie atmosphere  french margaritas really good too!  The waiter also knew lot extensive wine collection  two french wines love now   The food delicious  pork belly appetizer lamb dinner  Y  U M  definitely recommend trying restaurant! <EOR> Maybe expectations high coming into Bouchon especially since Thomas Keller   My friends made reservations 6 30pm Sunday night place pretty empty  seated 5 minutes waiting which still surprised guess since already reserved table   The decor ambiance place very appropriate dimly lit nice chairs booths   The menus surprised bit made tissue paper used wrap napkins  typical really nice restaurant?   After ordering given bread which plopped straight onto table along some butter pistachios  thought bit awkward  also no bread plates  guess Bouchon can't afford enough plates?   After bit also served some marinated olives which confused bit since didn't order any olives  turned really salty only ended spitting trying it   The wait food wasn't bad orders all came once  ordered leg lamb $33   portions aren't especially big but filled up  lamb very good flavorful definitely ended all quickly  thing looked most appetizing all friends chicken which much bigger portion other dishes smelled delicious   For dessert everyone ordered everything menu caramel custard lemon tart chocolate mousse meringue chocolate bouchons around tasting all desserts  Overall all desserts really good   We having pretty good experience until bill came turns those olives served complimentary  Somehow ended serving olives which did order charged it  told waiter he very apologetic immediately took off bill   Other mishap would say overall OK experience Bouchon  waiters nice decor nice food nice  But all little details missed Bouchon did wow especially Thomas Keller restaurant price paid  <EOR> A friend back brunch time  no reservations but only 30 minute wait when around 11 30am  bad!

She also ordered side bacon which generous TASTY though really wrong bacon?  Chicken Waffles omg  keep chicken moist tender delicious?! Best roasted chicken ever  waffles good but having bacon chives inside little light flavor department  Doesn't matter though because gravy  served dish alongside your typical maple syrup which passed on AMAZING  Rich but tart pieces fatty meat I'm thinking pork belly? little chunks indiscernible veggies  Incredible flavor  5 STARS easy   Mimosas 12 50 each which thought steep but guess  Vegas you! No stars off but pass mimosas next time   As ambiance could teeny bit better  seated outside no asked if wanted not while LOVE dining al fresco sweet baby jesus VEGAS  DESERT  seat people outside when 100 degrees out?!

Well  when sit down found all cracked be   The menu rather unimpressive selections  Maybe little jaded since much more fabulous meal Delmonico's  ahead ordered soup main course puree match earlier day   Their soup recommended Spinach cream soup  actually best part entire course meal  you could pretty much guess dinner night   soup very creamy done right seasoning  texture very smooth even color very bright green suggest elegance ingredient mirror where veggie came front  rather impressed start meal   Then weird twist bread table  noticed cover table piece seamless paper bread placed without plate top paper  gave impression eating cheap 2nd tier restaurant Buca Di Beppo   When Steak Frites came started downhill there  Maybe placing much value steak thought could done better but really unimpressed it  Although bad fries itself its world dining companion tried convince all night  think he more enamored considering Anthony Bourdain loved episode No Reservation where he engrossed much he loved fries same exact restaurant   No dice one   The puree even more disappointment me  thought overcooked very blend  cold mashed potato missing gravy  very subdued point   The service itself miss maybe reason why could never see place awarded Michelin Star  waitress disappeared most night when did spotted she chatting coworker drink station  really detail attention oriented looked just going thru motions   The decor itself place bad classy really nice touch elegance department  However just couldn't over tourist trap portion place pack sardine where tables close neighbors  really chatty loud place close everyone  ambiance really when sit down tried conversation your tablemates   Overall wasn't impressed place all  dining few more other fine dining places honestly say service price paying really lacking establishment  food itself really want pull well but just taste ho hum difference seperate itself pack  kind price paying really upsetting when think it   For Delmonico wound paying $70 best steak ever appetizer soup well worth fine dining meal  paid little bit more around $78 biggest let down ever any dining experience   Just love Elvis love pulling Vegas Elvis  just pulling because Vegas want relive its famous glory he's known for   Sadly better off taking Vegas version real deal as better going original Bouchon Yountville         Quality ** Decor *** Service * Amenity *** Ambiance <EOR> Man place hard rate    I love Thomas Keller's recipes food solid 5 stars every time  trip came breakfast bread pudding  Without question best ever had  Mouthwatering   So should 5 star review right? Um quite   For usually great service Keller's restaurants sorely lacking  Despite having tables open main dining room nice views scoffed group 8 stuck back room no windows decorations  felt eating hotel conference room    As result ignored lot  think kept forgetting someone back room  waited almost half hour being seated before anyone came see if any questions menu bring water  good   The value also rough here  place great food but good Lord expensive  tiny bread pudding size baseball OJ cost $30 tax tip  good but good   So food 5 stars value service 2 stars  average 3  hoping service isolated problem am willing back see if service improves raise 4 star average  But $30 tiny breakfasts always hold back 5 stars view  <EOR> We booked place corporate event over hundred people probably isn't super helpful unless you're interested bringing large party here   They sat outside which late May ended being perfect outside seating area great if need focal point awards dinner  All but 2 maybe 12 tables see center point where did awards   We pre set menu overall some complaints meal   From 4 people know salmon myself included all thought bit overcooked thats bummer b c its pretty easy keep salmon moist  realize its hard each dish your best when you're cooking hundred people once  don't know if cooked right then if ended having another party delivering food but ended being bit dry but still quite good   The dessert decent but nothing rave about    Between all restaurants huge dinners ranks but if look dinner place gf based experience wouldn't slam dunk choice   Again its hard everything perfect 100+ people overall good experience  <EOR> Yum yum yum place wonderful   Bouchon everything expect fine dining without pressure acting snotty getting super dressed up   kind service you'd expect when paying approximately $50 per person   never empty water glass [they leave bottle water table but never fill yourself     keep coming fill your glass]   clean bread crumbs off your table between courses   suggestions food drinks without pressuring selling   All all wonderful experience   The food  exceptional   fiance started onion soup then entree special braised short ribs   served some kind potato gratin something which wonderful!  short ribs some kind glaze gave very rich flavor without being overwhelming   tasting plate cheeses [sadly didn't pay enough attention find names cheeses] which different but all good   entree croque madame which brought back Paris   felt back little cafe next Notre Dame   Yum o   Sadly beau stuffed try desserts but would definitely come back maybe next time!

waiter which name escapes incredible  Very charming greeted respectively warmly  He let know some info restaurant specials day ended deciding have    We trusted waiter's palate food starters tried pork belly dish HEAVEN your mouth  also decided try oysters shipped daily  If remember he said 4 types oysters tried best two  taste ocean each bite!

I all kinds expectations most part happy  didn't high high expectations though  all most big chefs' restaurants Vegas aren't exactly same main flagship place  never wowed much Vegas compared original place  once   Bouchon located Venetian Hotel Resorts  night before brunch meal Bouchon watch The Phantom Opera sampled some goodies Bouchons Bakery  some Macarons some other pastries pretty yummy  thought better Jean Philippe Aria looked much better Payard Caesar well  couldn't wait sit eat Bouchon restaurant  early around 8 00 AM place pretty empty  Everyone probably still sleeping drunk eat breakfast 8 00 AM  fine me  restaurant very bistro look some patio seating facing fountain  pretty overly fancy    We party four time constraint friends needed leave trade show stat 9 00 AM needed time back gamble some more  won $329 night before playing penny slots hooked wanted back Aria resort played machine before leaving town  Oh treating because won BIG  LOL   The menu wasn't overly big found wanted order almost right away  started ordering Cappuccino couldn't wait baguette butter jam  always expected those goodies if ate brunch French Bistro  probably most favorite thing ever world just fresh warm baguette butter jam  bread service simply superb  served bread homemade cherry jam good!! ate jam no tomorrow  Well literally wouldn't cherry jam tomorrow ate all could day  looked just broke fast being hunger strike women's equality month looking way ate  sight seen apparently    When coffee came but Cappuccinos came Lattes  Obviously server didn't really pay much attention detail  However feeling kind just let go    We ordered Salmon Fumé which plate smoked salmon toasts onions tomatoes capers moules mussels cooked mustard white wine sauce Croque Madame which ham cheese between slices brioche bread topped sunny side egg Mornay sauce Bechamel added Gruyere Swiss Cheese corned beef hash  know right corned beef hash? French  However Thomas Keller known pioneer American cookery influenced French technique  thought would best damn corned beef hash would ever have  All meals great  Salmon nice but wasn't much cooking plate  mussels pretty incredible but couple friends didn't care mustard taste  liked it  However best plate hands down Croque Madame  tasted French tasted great  simple ham swiss but yum yum yum  Mornay sauce really added extra tang Swiss cheese  knew great Croque Madame  corned beef hash definitely delicious however little disappointed wasn't minced  corned beef cubed tasted chunky me    I also ordered some bacon never came  server good representation Thomas Keller's restaurant  He might lost all money last night work some food pay some debt  He wasn't born restaurant server  also surprised food came different time  wasn't expecting service where all dishes would unveiled same time however thought would somewhat together place Bouchon   Other thought great meal  loved wanted more cherry jam bread  If you're Vegas try Bouchon  prices reasonable Thomas Keller's restaurant  suggestion though if didn't want gain weight while Vegas trying all delicious food try walk everywhere!

The wife wanted try some celebrity chef places before leave Vegas good Bouchon being willing look other way on     Well let's just say put casual business casual seemed option us   I'll right say am generally huge fan French cuisine  exception marvelous concoctions served Olivier Baguette Cafe Hi Olivier! which routinely blows socks off many wonderful encounters crusty bread across globe flavour profiles just don't very often  Bouchon against beginning   I ordered new potato salad egg confit steak Bouchon black truffle demiglace chocolate marquise dessert  All good various levels  salad fascinating surprised much liked way raw egg yolk crowned whole affair oozed all over dish    Steak cooked perfection tasted good but course just wasn't into glaze  those Philistines smothers steaks gloopy brown sauce bottle however I'd preferred steak unadorned nice peppercorn sauce  Mushrooms fungi turns don't just turn off because texture  taste plays part too  alluded intro personal taste preference rather having anything quality dish   The desert suitably chocolatey tasty nothing I'd running again again but pleasant nice way round off elegant meal   Overall meal tasty  experience amazing  why only four stars?

Haha  know    felt wasted money food could easily home but oh well   The croissants die for  flaky buttery bad you    but man worth it  don't normally eat bacon but caved ate them since couldn't substitute anything else unless charge extra  eggs fluffy even took nit picky requests egg whites only    I'd totally come back croissants    time wasn't feeling adventurous French cuisine most likely because nauseous state but def back try them! also surprised place wasn't packed crowded  restaurant itself isn't probably known its breakfast    bit bummed didn't chicken waffles brunch menu others mentioned = server also super nice gave great recommendations! she very patient especially unpleasant state  felt bad hope she didn't think wasn't enjoying food =X did thoroughly enjoy leftovers though! <EOR> Food delicious best meal Vegas fantastic bread salads steak frites!

remember name when friend made reservation  didn't 2009 things gotten worse   If Yelp negative stars place award it   We party 13 last week  waiter raved fresh oysters flown daily  ordered 3 each apps 2 3 oysters horrible  nice didn't send any back  However provided some candid feedback    The main courses all $35+ except ham cheese sandwich  I'd veal which so so  friends other specials salmon steak fries etc  Again nothing special  all tasted food chain Chili's    At end meal waiter grabbed plates spilled food residue head didn't even notice he done so  I'd call back tell him  waiter didn't offer any napkins anything help clean up  He said sorry left  When demanded manager manager again only apologized behalf waiter  manager kept asking wanted  Common now    wanted then couldn't fixed because hair dirty shirt stained whole dining experience ruined  could told wanted shower new clothes ride back hotel    but wouldn't reasonable    If place run professionals wanted high end restaurant manager would immediately offered compensation instead asking want  manager would offered discount cab back room clean etc  scolding manager another person came back waived $35 plate  Essentially saying we'll feed if let spill dirty food all over you've finished your meal    So if want real dining experience instead getting abused dealing amateurs across street Bellagio's Picasso any other restaurant  <EOR> Pretty good French bistro sister restaurant French Laundry Venezia Towers Venetian  5 star potential but didn't quite it    Moules au Safran et  la Moutarde Maine bouchot mussels steamed white wine mustard saffron $26 50 5 stars  Excellent  Mussels fresh broth tasty    Steak Frites a pan seared prime flatiron served matre d'htel butter $34 50 4 stars  pretty good esp due think layer carmelized onions other spices top but steak itself wasn't flavorful asked medium medium well     Gigot d'Agneau roasted leg lamb spring veggies fennel dauphine $31 00 4 5 stars  Lamb super tender only slight gamey taste good jus very tasty fennel  major lamb fan could 5 stars   Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard foie gras toasted baguette $48 00 4 5 stars  first time trying foie gras pls forgive animal rights ppl   Came small 5 oz  canister under layer goose fat  waiter carved off goose fat expose rich delicious generous portion foie gras  Of course paying $50 better generous  rich tasty tasted even better special salt top small toasted bread pieces  Warning portion least 4 5 ppl finish much 2 3 ppl order unless want take home    Homemade brownies ice cream 4 5 stars three luscious mini brownie bites bit moist chocolate inside ice cream    Overall service very helpful attentive but did screw couple things wasn't perfect  asked spinach side instead fries steak first gave green beans instead  Then did apologize bring spinach side very fresh spinach some butter but SALTIEST thing ever had  returned waiter acknowledged overly salty whatever reason apologized that  free dessert return    Bottom line Pretty good French bistro great service but couple food service goofs prevent giving 5 stars  French bistro style don't expect full French menu  <EOR> Absolutely horrible service actually non service  sat relatively quickly corner table  restaurant barely half full  never offered water server never came over  waited 10 minutes promptly walked out  There's way many good restaurants Vegas waiting ignored  <EOR> This those places really pays ask waiter suggestions rather agonizing sort guessing what's best    Weekday seating fairly easy table without much fuss   absolutely need reservation weekends likely wait hour longer   The highlight's definitely pastries corned beef hash which fantastic   pastry basket very reasonably priced set four nice pastries let choose  ASK WAITER know which freshest best some nice suggestions even if decide couple don't want miss   specials some other items hit miss   Recently lobster hash which found little underwhelming scrambled egg think might actually better cheaper crab hash honest    few other items eaten 4 times Quiche rotating flavor day week   always group 3 4 split twice Florentine which underwhelming fairly boring tbh    Bourbon French Toast Just think bread pudding french toast because is   solidly good but spectacular   Corned Beef Hash Order this   awesome   Pork Loin Another highlight know you're going read think ham eggs basically but smokiness loin fantastic eggs probably haven't piece this   Mussels Really good thing split if group     Pastries usually special pastry two apple danish last

Waited desk quite some time flagged down hostess seated couple standing front us   Her reaction thought just standing   Duhhh! guess many people just stand line next wait seated sign without wanting seated! <EOR> My first time experiencing ratatouille quite interesting  reminded bruschetta but many more spices completely french   5 stars food all it  Exquisite steak ribeye  must try Bouchon Napa! <EOR> I enjoyed lovely brunch patio some GREAT companions great conversation   eggs great   All pastries tried divine   bacon merely satisfactory   jelly  mini donuts AMAZING   But need stop calling those things beignets    donuts misnaming them expected something different terms fluffiness pastry   Bellinis awesome   Wish served coffee bigger cups  <EOR> Bouchon fallen into ennui  last ate Bouchon 2010 food absolutely divine  Fast forward October 13 2013 Bartenders don't notice new customers bar meat omelette crepe inferior quality beignets heavy lumps fried dough     To start off Shane bartender needs some lessons customer service  I'd standing bar least 10 minutes Sunday afternoon around 12 30 pm trying someones attention buy two Bellinis  noticed every time leaned forward bartenders attention man right would look lean forward trying bartenders attention himself  He wife already only gotten coffee but refills well while standing waiting  Finally Shane comes over when he notices guy gesturing asks he needs  man told Shane he wanted more coffee refills said 2 Bellinis when chance Shane says You're going wait  only serve customer time right now helping customer   Really?  Wow  then Mr Bartender Blocker tells someone before waited 45 minutes bloody mary told  unacceptable would helped if he didn't keep leaning front blocking bartender seeing me  don't think guy ever called shenanigans before he totally shocked  then he starts totally going off 5 minutes manic rant he tells quit whining  Um doing whining dude   Anyways Shane comes back asks need tell two Bellini's please  he tells $27 dollars   Um ok dressed perfectly appropriately Sunday brunch why announcement much drinks be?  standard place? Really weird   Bad service plus serving someone else when turn especially birthday equals no tip   Once seated service server top notch  However food seriously lacking  $25 expect omelette prime cuts steak tiny diced pieces second rate meat  husbands crepe topped crab tasted fishy broccoli tasted frozen  beignets supposed soft pillows melt your mouth carb heaven heavy lumps covered grease   Come Keller restaurant needs little attitude adjustment ingredients need higher quality  Considering all choices available strip Bouchon overpriced second rate quality  <EOR> Love love love croque madame!!!!!  resist cheese ham fried egg sandwich covered mornay sauce?  dont forget shoestring fries!  But getting ahead myself   Excellent sazerac served neat should be   complement tap water which soft sweet   Dont bother bottled water   We tried special appetizers day   escargot served mini puff pastries swimming lovely garlic butter sauce very tender   carrot soup served creme fraiche light sweet   oysters very fresh briny    Portion size entrees uniform   special entree day scallops gnocchi perfect size but standard sauteed gnocchi menu item HUGE   good but dont know anyone no matter hungry could through even half plate   menu description bit deceptive   dish described being accompanied fricassee vegetables but only veggies sliced potatoes which seemed odd pairing potato gnocchi pimentos thinly shredded blanched greens   idea vegetables   Anyway dessert fantastic  a coffee flavored pot de creme served some butter shortbread cookies   Yummy!    Service pretty decent spectacular  <EOR> Brunch just ok but     Sometimes just want good seafood tower some good sparkling wine  Bouchon where that  prepared pay though  Thomas Keller + Vegas = $$$$ <EOR> Had breakfast Bouchon finally finding place terribly confusing Venetian and casino many times    My wife waffles strawberries vanilla syrup   sourdough French toast bread pudding   best breakfast ever bar none!  cook home waffles French toast seem totally different foods!

Anyway both bunch dinner say great job fancified French bistro food   Personally think dinner better value    For food recommend steak frites fries delicious and steak isn't bad    time some reason vegetable gnocchi nice departure wasn't looking something super heavy delivered lots fresh veggies pan seared fluffy gnocchi   Since Vegas also opportunity foie on   terrine foie gras which unfortunately able finish but packed later!    friends pan seared foie gras which thought better choice flavor wise   Anyway no real complaints me   Service good water glass never empty waitstaff efficient enough   Decor upscale bistro style classy but nothing special   nice hustle bustle inside restaurant but still talk your friends which nice   Bouchon always pleasure  <EOR> What nice breakfast was  Beignets chocolate spread latte per servers advice  even complimentary yogurt parfait which nice treat  Followed omelet special day all great  Very calm casual great food great service  <EOR> OMFG hands down BEST chicken waffles EVER  Now know you're thinking     Chicken Waffles Bouchon?

Always want life! <EOR> Oh Thomas Keller love butter   Especially breads potatoes   My wife wandered late brunch weekday simply superb brunch  ordered garden breakfast eggs pastry brioche toast potatoes spinach fruit juice coffee she eggs eggs meat potatoes      We blown away especially pastry potatoes    Hers fluffy savory potatoeness wrapped perfect coating fried crisp perfection   Mine skillet potatoes fried onions much butter caramelized takes whole new meaning   Truly delight truly something can't any run of the mill diner   Oh yeah brioche toast croissant   Let's just say Bouchon known its pastries know why   think only better croissant I'd France taste memory probably enhanced because France   Once again though think if add creamery's worth butter any dish good results   We ate outside next fountain atmosphere met cuisine perfectly   Service friendly easy   What really noticed price total bill $40 meal INCLUDED coffee juice   When fine dining restaurant expect pay 4 5 times you'd pay family restaurant $10 20 steak potatoes Chilis = $50 80 steak potatoes Morton's    idea    But if you'd Country Kitchen order eggs meat potatoes coffee juice you'd certainly pay $10 15 person   WAY better Country Kitchen   How rate brunch?  compare delicate croissant perfectly creamy potatoes awesomely greasy chicken fried steak eggs biscuits gravy ate recovery food some mom pop diner $5 99?   Both excellent some level   think Bouchon's brunch excellent can't just anywhere while Diners Drive Ins Dives food may equally good find Bouchon experience must try   And order potatoes   bread  pay no mind butter   Even when home your Vegas vacation learn you've gained 2 pounds 4 days   totally worth it  <EOR> There days where want nicely prepared meal  then days where want stuff face buffet  friends chose Bouchon brunch because itching former   I tried small piece sourdough waffles fresh strawberries vanilla bean butter  very tasty fried waffle  vanilla bean butter nice touch   The vanilla bean yogurt granola tasty boy give LOT granola! bit rich taste but granola helped ease it   The Cobb salad didn't take picture but kinda meh  Limp iceberg lettuce scarce pieces chicken small portion boot $17 salad   This good stop some carb loading any pre intense cardio dance floor club later evening  service great waters constantly filled   Price wise high mediocre meal Venetian hotel  think stop Grand Luxe next time around menu contains better choices  recommended those looking healthy options everything tasted very rich heavy  <EOR> I just found old adage good things come those wait always true   DYING eat Thomas Keller waited long time   Unfortunately good things never came   The place feel true French bistro except huge   hostesses l'attitude parisienne down cold   service staff very good except trainee dropped everything he brought tables around pistachios knives plates   etc   picture   Back hostesses   came table every 15 minutes clipboard pad pen check where everyone meals   understand workings restaurant need know tables close being finished project your seating   But something VERY offsetting clipboard hovering over your table taking notes   would preferred someone some discretion   NOW all things would huge deal if wasn't KELLER restaurant   honestly expected WOW'd wasn't   super hyped food thought sure would put all rest   yet disappointed again   Yes food good but nothing really bring attention too   escargot palatable puff pastry top very floury push those aside only escargot   better small non notable cafes   husband's steak just ok truffle fries horrible   I am sad write review   positive Keller would lock down French experience then some but since only restaurant am greatly disappointed   It pricey put just good French food  <EOR> I hate give place two stars   Thomas Keller thought would blown away   Thomas Keller French Laundry cookbook dying try food   understand he's actually back working kitchen but name attached am going high expectations   Unfortunately tab extremely high service sucked all food point   price paid food should mind blowing exceptional just not   service food impeccable price would b issue   First off waited forever seated   mean 45 minutes when told would half hour   starving   When hostess table ask wait ignored multiple people working hostess station    Our waitress super passive aggressive   She ignored when tried flag down made initial order because decided add order escargot appetizer   ask busing staff add order because even though she saw motion she ignored never came back until much later say she added order   also asked raw sugar she forgot ask again waiting good while     There definitely some high points though such complimentary bread butter apricot jam amazing   escargot delicious but never bad escargot escargot tasted incredibly different any place ordered it   escargot prepared very classic manner lots garlic butter topped puff pastry   excellent happy sop leftover garlic butter bread table   One thing annoyed water situation   think absolutely insane charge $7 water spigot back  put into bottle refrigerated before serving   sealed bottle water which could understand if price higher sparkling water   other thing she continued bring table more water without asking course charged all three bottles water brought table   just find insane water cost more coffee let tell tasted just nasty water hotel room only chilled   order flat water worth insane price tag   We during brunch time wanted try french toast  apple french toast more french toast bread pudding hybrid   gorgeous thinly perfectly sliced apples top tart sweet delicious   french toast itself under seasoned bland   actually add salt which know sounds crazy but needed it   My friend ordered mushroom omelet which very small also under seasoned   also thought would french style omelet but wasn't   came thick but small folded half American style omelet    also came huge mound perfectly crispy bacon deep fried but tasted heavenly     Next friend special day BLT Benedict   Benedict consisted house made split English muffin   tiny   hollandaise top very thin lacked full flavor hollandaise should have   Bacon fine but lettuce iceberg   underwhelmed pale white iceberg thought something butter lettuce would elevated dish much more   tomato halved cherry tomatoes   think nice slice heirloom tomato would also better choice   dish also came small side home fries perfect delicious   Even house made muffin feel dish warranted $26 price tag   Last friend ordered Banana Waffles   t comes nuts but she asked no nuts   waitress asked if she allergic   She said no but them   course food dropped off quickly someone other waitress time realized waffles covered nuts no flag down   finally asked waffles switched but time waffles without nuts brought all done food   things worse waffles cold   all dishes fly due mistake kitchen's part waffle shouldn't something takes same time rest finish food finish   Our waitress comped cold waffles but bill still crazy high mediocre experience   She also highly annoyed kept rolling eyes when came time split bill end   don't know if would return perhaps if someone else footing bill  <EOR> Shit overrated overpriced  am big fan Thomas Keller restaurants napa bouchon Yountville before  menu pretty much same but just think restaurant doesn't compare original valley     Here's had     1 2 dozen raw oysters    yummy very fresh   I Poulet Roti which came Bacon Lardon sweet corn arugula onion confit  dish good but anything great  end thinking myself Dammit! why didnt Croque Madame?! The Steak Frites    Left lot desired  best thing dish French fries  steak lacked great flavor carmalized onion overpowered protein  big no no    I probably wouldn't come back Bouchon  Las Vegas unless company paid meal lol    FYI service wasn't great  saw surver once only once over 2 hours  busser busy talking some chicks back ask steak knives fill own water which ok but worked fine dining know good great service wasn't it  <EOR> The first time service incredible  second time around Easter okay  place take kids expensive  Chicken Waffles amazing but $28 better be  cool wait area right pool  Parking beast aware  <EOR> Oh Bouchon  love oh much  usually pick schmancy dinner during Vegas trip since over the top fancy $500 per person dinners Bouchon suited just fine   First all realize you're supposed order wine all things Frenchy but gotta say cocktails Bouchon spectacular  Supremely amazing  Bulleit Old Fashioned helluva Old Fashioned   Of course service more superb  really feel worth every penny you're spending    The food?

I came friend many times highly recommended glad checked out   I ordered Idaho trout which very light tasty then sampled side olives which expecting but still edible   Then best part whole table hooked samples champagne Moscato paired almost every dessert menu except chocolate cake which fine because don't really eat chocolate anyway    Wow definitely overwhelming amount dessert just table 3    but complaining    Speaking desserts favorite lemon tart pie  Wow! best tart ever had  All other desserts little over top sweetness dairy which fan but still good   Not only food fantastic but service accurate friendly humorous  nice see all workers getting along poking fun another  liked because unexpected says something good establishment    A crew gets along provides exceptional service very true  menu very simple expensive thought would which made meal all more enjoyable    Overall everything great but only complaint hostesses could done better job lack friendliness poise assigning tables  table reserved 9 15 did seated until 9 40 which unprofessional   For restaurant caliber hostess truly need sure table time promised delivered    no excuses  why sticking 4 stars  <EOR> My expectations high dinner being already brunch different occasion which proved mediocre best  felt bad enough forcing boyfriend take even though parents forewarned wasn't good  Lesson learned    First offense drastically sharp change attitude waiter once he discovered did want order appetizers alcohol  He even resorted salesman approach push more menu items order  politely declined he rudely began a hole performance   Second offense food say grosser side things? Trout dry bland unimpressive lamb repulsive if just sitting all day vegas sun light then cooked until tough gummy  flavor actually made want vomit usually love lamb! only highlight bread  Seriously  Even dessert just ok  all things dessert plate all enjoyed ice cream because really can't mess ice cream   Third offense waiter completely absent unreachable during entire course meal  then he suddenly appears way grab bill under boyfriend's elbows take look much tipping  just re read all say WTF?!?! ENRAGED   Fourth offense lovely face slapper throughout entire meal beyond rude service very young teenage couple obviously hookups knew someone worked impeccable service entire meal which included LOT food all house  literally received exact opposite treatment them    See did Thomas Keller? <EOR> Came breakfast ordered Breakfast Americaine  toast very light torched nicely  Sausage bacon great but eggs over easy cooked perfection  strawberry croissant favorite part meal     man      super soft melts your mouth    The service great  server forgotten item meal friend's meal  ended asking items near end meal    time came already full    STILL CHARGED IT! wasn't even apology  quite disappointing   I probably won't coming back Bouchon Bistro but may visit Bouchon Bakery  <EOR> Nearly 500 Yelpers highly doubt anything uniquely funny interesting compelling innovative say Bouchon but must say girlfriends most incredible experience food service ambience combined!  In opinion 'fancier' restaurant separates itself pack due or both two things 1 quality service 2 quality product offered   Bouchon definitely turned amp 11 both fronts   shy away eating myself ridiculous beautiful high priced establishment here's short list ordered myself I did share others now don't worry  entree GIGANTIC veal chop sous vide aromatics fricassee fava beans baby corn roasted red peppers delicious tarragon crema like sauce  side pommes frites     come now  side macaroni au gratin     TOTALLY worth it  1000mL spectacular Riesling  1 2 dozen oysters both British Columbia Washington  French Onion soup     it   While side bill turned significantly larger other gals' portions didn't care   don't come Vegas clubbing   don't come Vegas merely just drunk   sure hell don't Vegas eat McDonalds between such ventures   'developing' foodie myself found Bouchon most perfect entry point between typical fine dining 'fooooormal' restaurant Joel Robuchon next list!

Monday night girlfriend  say place very hard find far corner behind parking elevators really?   Once inside very impressed decor but service pretty ridiculously poor  sat waiting 15 minutes just any acknowledgement waiter another 20 passed before flag down waiter keep girlfriend flipping table walking out  Definitely major problem especially upscale classy place this  Though he did look busy waiter definitely glanced walked away anyways despite fact eagerly awaiting service   However apparently someone noticed because soon enough receiving complimentary appetizer sides it  salmon rillettes creamy delicious very well crostini  tasty little morsels salmon well enjoyed them much more bread which quite hard little burnt   roasted leg lamb CRISPY PORK BELLY entrees joined Mac cheese sautéed mushrooms braised carrots  leg lamb pretty good nice tender cut meat delicious au jus full flavor    The CRISPY PORK BELLY god CRISPY PORK BELLY  caps justice  AMAZING  Pork belly favorite dishes if restaurant menu decisions made  But crispy pork belly far BEST ever had  cut meat just right amount tender succulent meat plentiful amount flavor packed fat top beautifully glazed crispy skin  flavors melded unbelievably well vegetables onion sauce accompanied perfectly! definitely give highest regard chef hope give fat bonus fatty pork he introduced taste buds  only wish someday figure recipe     We unfortunately didn't eat much much appreciated sides but did eat great! mushrooms deliciously prepared  saying something  I hate mushrooms  braised carrots nice soft yet still crunchy enough nicely seasoned  Finally Mac cheese nice gooey but awesome crunchy crust!   In short though experience Bouchon began terribly situation well remedied managers more made food!   Summary Salmon rillettes great! 9 10 Leg lamb decent 8 10 PORK BELLY AMAZING 10 10 <EOR> For restaurant Vegas casino surprised much enjoyed meal   ordered clams which come side fries expecting handful okay sized clams rinky dinky portion fries since side    surprise order comes large cauldron dish over filling clams pretty large side fries could honestly own order HUGE portion!  price paid definitely more money's worth   staff nice attentive helpful   very satisfied visit hope come back soon! <EOR> Some finest dining done  wait staff very helpful girlfriends vegetarianism  perfect night planned going ask girlfriend marry dinner she said yes =     As very pricey well worth it  <EOR> It says close 10 pm   9 30 said kitchen already closed   Why post your hours say you're closed 10 when can't even 9 30?  arrived 15 minutes before closing  <EOR> This place fantastic  soon saw menu knew Brunch  before even realized Thomas Keller restaurant    We ended going Breakfast during week which slightly smaller menu Brunch but still extremely happy all food hard time deciding order   We able grab table outside overlooking Pool area Venetian which gave nice French feeling  started off Cafe au lait which delicious  really looking forward trying Champagne Cocktails which all sounded delicious but alas being last day just exhausted needed IV drip caffeine  server kept coffee coming us    We started off Beignets which came side nutella house made strawberry jam  delicious beignets should be  real star though strawberry jam  asked if sell but sadly no longer do  would totally buy some though  *hint hint*   I ordered quiche du jour which quiche Lorraine  came side salad but substituted fries  wish hadn't because give enough fries feed small country  boyfriend's Croque Madame came more enough fries both us  Seriously am french fry fiend looked hadn't even touched them  quiche fantastic though very rich tasty  boyfriend loved Croque Madame well  Mornay sauce quite tasty    For breakfast bit higher end but location ambiance service drinks food all worth it  would definitely back hopefully dinner Brunch next time sure those champagne cocktails  <EOR> The secret happiness low expectations  lived mantra very long time but allowed myself slide little bit when booked table Bouchon   I'd Thomas Keller's slightly better known restaurant California completely blown away figured Bouchon should offer something damn good its price range   Not quite   attentive polite gregarious waiter made feel very much ease gave enthusiastic recommendations   nothing he could deter ordering half lobster which friend wanted try foie gras which two outstanding experiences FL must order he recommended halibut entree also   He warned foie gras large terrine rather single fried piece suggested order much more   should listened   Somehow 5 oz foie gras didn't strike massive amount but enough table six   particularly good   tasted more patee foie gras   Serving massive overpriced portion mediocre food completely against understand TK's philosophy food be   Keller says should give customers quite enough something enjoy just taste several things while remaining hungry additional offerings   But easily least rich least buttery foie gras including terrine ever just way much two people   fact enough gave rest couple next dug into enthusiasm still left more third time done   Instead making best waiters hedge customers foie gras should just take off menu   Anyway lobster excellent albeit pricey served buttery mustard sauce simply perfect match   far most successful savory dish tried   Again reminded not quite top quality dining experience amount fighting required extract half lobster its shell   world's slickest guy lobster cracker but damn messy almost neighbors too   We also ordered halibut waiter's suggestion which nice texture but near zero flavor its own   Fortunately served top some vegetables sauce matched nicely brought flavor into detectable range     As complimentary bread highly not complimentary house blend red wine both reasonably pleasant   bread didn't stack very well terms flavor freshness compared we'd enjoyed Olives earlier day    Upon request also brought some locally carbonated water made using special Norwegian machine   fear sounding yuppie @$$hole usually don't bonkers water but water tasted particularly crisp clean cool   psychological actually better?  We finished wonderful creme brulee dessert which perfect level sweetness crispiness   top layer seemed thinner usual good thing   Bravo   Anyway despite heroic efforts waiter Bouchon scored bigger failures foie gras halibut successes water creme brulee     no tragedy but given $200 cost including two glasses wine tip tough justify going back   Mon Ami Gabi Olives both more knockout items substantially lower price   TK believe you!  Fix this! <EOR> Bouchon solid dinner place   If you're going something  super fancy but still good eats then highly recommend place   The bread   serve nice loaf freshly baked bread salted butter   could eat two loaves stuff   There's nothing special bread other fact done extremely well   I've three times far steak frites mussels white wine butter twice    Both awesome dishes but probably tell partial mussels   mussels done white wine garlic butter steaming liquid amazing when dip freshly baked bread it   think there's also some thing slices andouille sausage broth flavor   I don't recall experience steak frites but sure good   This place great because ambiance without pretense relax but fancy enough special event birthday anniversary    I recommend making reservations  <EOR> I wanted love experience however    pros beautiful decor authentic French brasserie  server brought braided baguette French butter jam which real treat  ordered crepes while hubby sausage hash  very tasty appealing while mine visually attractive though taste just okay  Unfortunately entire meal disappointing server rushed through returning multiple times first few minutes asking orders  ordering pastry basket asked wait before adding entree kitchen though meals came table only few bites pastries  She seemed more little put serving table acted though she doing favor waiting us  Overall think pricey meal could much better  tip 'don't  ask Amber when go ' <EOR> 4 5 stars   What say true Bouchon Thomas Keller   amazing!  I read other yelpers dinner worth instead took friend lunch brunch birthday   both loved food!  Even though 2 friend didn't food taste looking but thought Croque Madame best had!

I yet try chicken waffles must try next but everything ordered did disappoint  Staff very friendly customer service deserves two thumbs up   Standard pricing Vegas restaurants   I recommend making reservation through open table beforehand vs  showing up  hear people wait over hour table just no bueno!  Romantic intimate ambiance plus large groups private room which really nice dine in  <EOR> Eh  better quarter price BUT boyfriend breakfast menu limited could factor  wanted try chicken waffles everyone raved BUT only available during brunch  Ordered omelet roasted chicken spinach cheese wasn't amazing  Boyfriend croque madame he wasn't fan it good but something keep coming back for    The service bit slow morning waiter bit clumsy spilling juices dropping menus   Overall experience wasn't worth $90 food did blow away   Our minds might change once opportunity try brunch menu  right now stand 3 star rating  <EOR> We brunch everything delicious!

<EOR> I walked into Venetian really excited try Bouchon reading many great reviews it  asked concierge point restaurant given rapid fire directions obviously did completely hear  given sarcastic smile decided entertain woman any further off find it  located 10th floor hotel if keep walking any particular direction you'll likely come across sign point its direction  Saturday around 3PM found mostly empty  limited menu hour decided croque madame side fries  fries skinny somewhat lacking flavor ton them  actual croque madame disappointing  quality all ingredients really where should've considering prestige hotel prices charge food  creamy sauce smothered all over bread tasted really processed bread appeared tasted very low quality white bread somewhat stale  ham tasted lunch meat might find low quality grocery store  Overall made unsatisfying meal didn't finish despite intense hunger  service wasn't friendly particularly helpful which really didn't much improve experience  high hopes Bouchon but making effort return based level service quality ingredients  <EOR> One best places pastries  macaroons huge price regular size ones  strawberry sesame just perfect balance sesame taste really great combination  tried PB cookie  Looking looks peanut butter chocolate chip cookie chocolate filling but much more  two soft cookies fluffy peanut butter cream hidden center  Takes happy place  Your mouth needs slapped brought back earth  <EOR> Brunch review The pastries live hype  looking reviews came brunch many others did  place pretty hidden inside Venezia tower  little quieter rest Venetian though  space nice airy overlooks pool   We ordered Beignets delicious jam filled  liked chocolate sauce better but both good  Four pastry combo select four want  chose Croissants plain blueberry pain au chocolat quite possibly best croissants      ever had  perfectly flaky buttery  flavored ones very point sweet  Cheese danish tasty heaviness good contrast croissants   Entrees French toast tried some dad's oh so delicious!

all loved experience Bouchon  <EOR> My husband dined Sunday brunch hearing many great things brunch  Bouchon did disappoint    We arrived around 11 told would 30 minute wait  wait ended being just shy 30 minutes  waiting area very comfortable seating newspapers read  restaurant also puts plate mini muffins enjoy wait  When time seated hostess offered take bags  given claim tickets retrieve bags brunch   Our waitress greeted soon being seated  She quickly brought drinks told specials day  She friendly checked frequently  atmosphere brunch very lively  Tables fairly close together bit noisy side    I ordered specials which French onion base flat iron steak spinach topped two eggs  unique dish offered brunch very well prepared  French onion base delicious worked well steak eggs  could more steak but other dish great  toast side good way enjoy delicious mixed berry jam   My husband BLT Tartine served Pommes Frites  BLT loaded crispy bacon  challenging cut enjoy but husband enjoyed flavors  Pommes Frites perfectly prepared addictive    We offered dessert menu which course welcomed  Why don't all restaurants offer breakfast dessert!? Meringue fresh fruit perfect two split  meringue large crunchy outside soft center  perfectly sweet  fresh fruit nice balance sugary meringue    Be aware take reservations brunch which fine  only note because woman front desk during check in Venetian told would need reservation brunch  When reservations unavailable initially assumed booked almost plan B  call concierge cleared up  knocking any stars since misinformation wasn't restaurant  told take reservations dinner recommended  <EOR> It's every day when Thomas Keller himself says pleasure you've thanked delicious breakfast always going special memory me    One top items bucket list visit French Laundry Yountville experience Bouchon delight itself    I chose gaufres bananas walnuts  waffle light airy but absorbed vanilla butter syrup really well  soggy all   My wife omelette bacon  must say flavor bacon really unique  Couldn't place finger but really pleasing pallete   I beautiful vanilla latte really good way start day  <EOR> Every single time visited Las Vegas business pleasure probably 10 times past 3 years Bouchon list must visit no matter places  fact enjoy casual yet upscale atmosphere brasserie and original Yountville CA which fairly heart sing much would venture say last meal earth might very well occur Bouchon if choice matter!  Often travel alone business restaurant fantastic old school marble topped bar which beautifully conducive dining solo enjoying people watching friendly banter bartenders slurp decadent perfectly seasoned piping hot French onion soup crowned gooey melted gruyere cheese along side mixed greens salad simple vinaigrette round toasted goat cheese  Simple yes but perfectly executed  epis bread baked house delightful accompaniment shatteringly crisp crust but soft chewy warm interior   When dined colleagues date usually order steak frites entree comes slathered just tiny bit heavily slathered honestly shallot garlic studded red wine butter sauce  Mmmmmmmmm     delicious though!  The Bouchons dessert best choice little cork shaped chocolate cakes served housemade fresh mint chocolate chip ice cream last time them  refreshing way end meal!  Cocktails professionally crafted well chosen wine list featuring variety price points   also known shellfish fruits de mer towers breakfast only excellent but surprising value too  No lunch served however sure early enough even late night gambling delicious breakfast! <EOR> 3 $$$ = 3 *** me   really high expectations Thomas Keller spot but slow SERVICE TEMPERATURE food left very disappointed  Decor aside Venetian just purely spectacular food left very dissatisfied    My first course special night braised veal cheeks  Cheeks most animals always wonderful because tender succulent  when see veal cheeks  adding sugar fudge  must good right? really  could any meat tenderized slow cooked overpowering sauce  SERVED  LUKEWARM    Second course Magret de Canard duck breast   excited because LOVE DUCK  served All Clad copper plated pan  spectacular presentation but came LUKEWARM!

Methinks not  Stay downstairs visit Yountville  <EOR> I Bouchon few Times But last May 17 Made think place does worth prices brunch Ridiculous 2 eggs benedict $27 didnt experience because lot fabulous places Vegas Bouchon Bouchon famous but Amazing anymore <EOR> Went Thomas Keller's brunch 6 friends   early February 2018 nice enough dine outside patio overlooked small pool inside elegantly decorated courtyard   service polite very prompt   starters mimosas cofffee OJ few screwdrivers   All drinks came great    Food wise started off order beignetes smoked salmon petite baguette croissant pecan sticky bun   All starters came spot delicious   tried each above which completely met expectations      main ordered chicken waffles table ordered croque madam breakfast sandwich Oeufs Benedict   All meals came great funny note Croque madam served side fries size small wastebasket   all seriousness largest side fries ever seen    The sandwich excellent chicken waffles served crown liquor maple syrup   amazing  table enjoyed Benedict but didn't try it  just fan dish   definitely back here  <EOR> I wish could add more stars! amazing husband brunch twice during 5 day trip Vegas  Beautiful restaurant beautiful resort  highly recommend eating ousts with worth wait  husband salmons eggs Benedict omelet day both fabulous  course start fried donuts Nutella jam!

Holy cow btw GOOD fresh baby corn shiitake mushrooms sauce could barely restrain myself licking plate    look feel authentic bistro yet just having come back Paris place could stand among best easily     Dessert probably best part   shared sourdough waffle accompanied cherry compote hazelnut ice cream Nutella or reasonable facsimile thereof vanilla bean whipped cream   Apparently said waffle regular breakfast item   wanted come back next morning  second choice because four people CLEARLY demands two desserts no? chocolate bouchons really perfectly fudgy brownie thing vanilla ice cream   Freaking amazing     I honestly tad wary trying eat any celeb chef joint Vegas but because Thomas Keller won't put name just any business proposition comes along figured Bouchon good bet   oh was   pricey but still line practically every other nice place Strip  wanna back!! <EOR> Absolutely beautiful place brunch while Vegas  Delicious food impeccable service  <EOR> Nice bistro food Thomas Keller attention detail  croque madame wasn't really all mind blowing but all shared pastry plate each just impossibly good  don't eat ton croissants but these     Also super hard table able accommodate group nine quite easily  <EOR> Went dinner   food very good   Kind French fusion restaurant   service excellent   However early around 5 30 only three other customers don't know service full house     The biggest stand deserts   lemon tart die some chocolaty raspberry cake goodness   can't recall name but wonderful  <EOR> Pricey tends case French restaurants but beautiful outside patio wonderful food  Smaller portions don't plan being pig unless want pay through nose! <EOR> This place over rated  disapointed because Thomas Keller culinary heroes  any case wasn't bad    but many choices simliar prices same casino even    wouldn't recommend visit  Perhaps should try Lutece Valentino's instead  Both must sees  <EOR> Prices gone 5 10% since last year   food quality still really good complimentary olives ! <EOR> Fantastical chicken waffles  Service top notch  Would even better if more well rounded dinner menu  Seemed brunch oriented <EOR> While last Vegas 3 different dinners 3 different locations  probably worst 3  food very average which very surprising knowing chef behind restaurant  copy French brasserie but would expected better food   special soup yam which delicious but only dish above average  also soup l'ognion mussels gnocchi special veal  waiter did good job selling specials expected better quality food dinner Scarpetta night now outstanding   place overpriced wine list although extensive way overpriced service awful  waiters kept dropping plates silvers floor happened least 4 times during dinner busboy poured water into wine glass  sommelier unshaved suit no tie  good experience recommend it  <EOR> Recently Bouchon dinner    place overly expensive quality    careful waiters trying upsell menu   Regular oysters cost 18 dollars menu   paid 40 dollars   Water cost 30 dollars   Stay away lamb dish very salty   Everything very salty need drink lot water    Wine great   would recommend pear desert   Overall would better quality less somewhere else  <EOR> I've tried Bouchon LA recommended group friends during Vegas trip  think decently priced lunch much better alternative some relatively more popular places eat brunch *ahem Mon Ami Gabi     I LOVE mussels ones Bouchon LA some best had  Thankfully Vegas remains same  huge portion size $25 50 price tag very worth it  trick first eat ones allow dig little hole reach white wine saffron sauce  Then eat mussels dip french fries into sauce same time! Pure deliciousness  I tried some croque madame smoked salmon baguette which both outstanding  friend also ordered special day which pork belly BLT  Service little slow but large group didn't mind much  amazed identical Vegas Bouchon LA Bouchon looked  Uncanny!  I really think best Sunday brunch you'll find strip granted you're looking French style brunch buffet  prices probably little more expensive but food much better! <EOR> For finest quality food unpretentious dishes prices don't break bank Bouchon absolute steal  If you're budget just water entree walk under $20  If you're willing spend bit more appetizers side dishes afters all exquisite  party all serious foodies all very thoroughly impressed everything ate  tureen foie gras seemingly little pricey but more enough three some left over exquisite  staff treasure delighted service  Yes things took time but we're giving plenty time enjoy your meal slow we're ignoring slow  Even water tasted great asked waiter said special filter system takes bad stuff but leaves good minerals  Bouchon won over three tough foodies effortless style charm  definitely going back soon Vegas again already recommended family  <EOR> we ended eating whim  much delight restaurant beautiful! waltzing around new building venetian swept away europe   i felt local celebrity because hostesses and everyone else joint matter kept fawning over saying looked some girl used work there    the food simply mahh velous! never anyone ask wanted salmon cooked but being japanese opted medium the rarest she   plating gorgeous smattering veggies underneath butter garlic infused almost cleaned house!  the real treat chocolate mousse  great real chocolate flavor didn't need any sugary assistance  lemon tart REALLY sour but low spice tolerance love sour! brownie tower things cute also liked mint ice cream tasted mint leaves instead traditional peppermint essence    overall great time minus star because used slow euro service waitress didn't seem all there  <EOR> I such high hopes Bouchon!  The awesomest thing summer Rose  rose fix day! But $18 truffle fries rather steep    I steak frites really just mediocre  Kind disappointing food took nearly hour come out  <EOR> Ate Feb 13   If Venetian trade show need convenience all around winner  That night very windy unfortunately terrace closed but looked terrace would lovely place eat   Someone said noisy might depend where sit   thought quiet   service excellent   another Yelper same night  enjoyed trout  side garlic spinach delicious   Prices high but typical location didn't think over priced  <EOR> The service beyond superb  desserts very well done  Since first experience Bouchon four stars until future visits impress   The chicken waffles appeared popular among other visitors  sampled pastries pot de creme breads egg ham bread thing fries  food fair   the service put over top  <EOR> Super overpriced mediocre food  ordered croque madame side salad fries  croque madame good but bechamel sauce way creamy  fries salad decent nothing special    The server busy catering table next table drunk guys she never came check us  She would literally just walk table without even looking us  took 10 minutes attention could ask check    I never Bouchon Yountville but boyfriend says Vegas does even compare one  could definitely see that   Maybe dinner menu better but pretty unimpressed brunch  <EOR> So place all kinds nice! Nice view gardens airy bright! came Saturday brunch party three seated almost instantly    Ask if strawberry croissant available  tastes strawberry cake something! crumbles it! it!   My boyfriend friend omelet du jour prime rib oyster mushrooms forget else   came brioche think your choice sausage bacon I don't remember   few bites quite good!   I croque madame found very rich satisfying  extremely filling  think would've fine sandwich alone  also really liked fries came with    but salty  good but would've much better if didn't taste entire salt shaker there  Would've polished off salty   Next hostess podium embossing machine some cards some souvenirs with  it! What's even better when use embarrassingly loud noise everyone know you're using machine! <EOR> Breakfast Review      Stopped breakfast before leaving Las Vegas   Sat outside patio which nice   Service Service courteous friendly but little slow side which problem relaxing before driving back home rush    imagine service would faster little prompting if desired   Also really good keeping coffee cup full which appreciate heavy coffee drinker    Food selection pastries both breakfast road oatmeal strawberry compote   croissants terrific light flaky buttery     but greasy oily pecan sticky bun good blueberry muffin also good   Unfortunately oatmeal little watery compote ovelry sweet   Still enjoyed atmosphere friendly service     again pastries really good  <EOR> We ordered French onion soup salmon Benedict  Very cute restaurant perfect brunch  onion soup made perfectly but little sweet side  salmon Benedict made perfectly loved came side salad  also ordered Nutella beignets which much sweeter expected but still delicious  more thick cake texture most other beignets keep mind when ordering  <EOR> Was brunch past weekend   great place!

Sticky bun bit dry  Everything comes loaf baguette jam butter  Lattes so   Paula gave wonderful service well bussers  <EOR> COST $17 Escargot à la Bourguignonne Snails $28 50 Parfait de Foie Gras $38 50 Steak Frites Holy hell  just back fantastic weekend Vegas but am surprised find myself writing horrible experience Bouchon was  don't think ever incredibly let down restaurant magnitude reputation but Bouchon certainly did   Let's start bread  Though delicious literally served group cold LOL  Later servings fixed but still cold bread wtf? Next came cocktails   oooof! better bartenders  understand focus more wines but you're strip some cocktails  Moscow Mule's which just okay but friend's Old Fashioned literally tasted nothing but water   The snails great  Foie Gras however didn't taste one  creamy point tasted butter nothing else  biggest disappointment steak though  EXPECT ANYTOWN DINER SERVING STEAK BOUCHON  Holy hell steak tasted cheap overseasoned just really blah  fries tasted stale gross  gave heaping which damn waste food  don't mind literally five pieces fries just them good please   To cap all off waiting food 1 5 hour! Granted party 9 but come now    your kitchen staff dining room perfectly equipped handle least looked that   Our server nice apologetic gave 4 free desserts it  were lemon tart pie some mousse some ice cream puff pastry creme brûlée  Again sadly all just very passable  better food desserts included any Las Vegas buffet portion ended paying   I truly expected something more since never see LA location before closed down  cost there's seriously some giant disconnect location needs together before closes  <EOR> Stopped while staying Venetian quick café pastry breakfast bar  Delicious all accounts  Service sharp friendly  Big room ambiance surprisingly minimal noise  Just clinking cutlery mumble friendly conversation  Wonderful place start your day LV  <EOR> Bouchon those select restaurants want foodie  kind restaurant that'd you'd definitely want back type you'd recommend anyone   After watching Top Chef Las Vegas first time ever wanting explore learn more culinary world  Then multi task mode looking places eat Las Vegas recent trip there  words Thomas Keller  Michelin rated came sold Bouchon    With more 600 reviews just add some nice things when someone else similar search nice places eat Vegas hopes Yelp review steer them right direction especially if you're feeling eating buffets all time   this nice change pace    Brunch excellent here  relaxed but same time you're experiencing some fine dining  people tell every time come Vegas family Bouchon     I pastries many choices just decided assortment four pastries Bouchon Pastry Basket  http www yelp com biz_photos rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=mHIby3_tPU4T_b9Jubc7fg They're all good but filling  Another instance where eating eyes stomach   I Chicken Waffles best  Roscoe's Chicken Waffles great but Bouchon delivers no other    The Croque Madame good advertised pommes frites delicious  Leave French great French Fries    It all filling couldn't possibly fit dessert  But then saw table across all come just eat dessert cried little bit when saw various dessert options  Then proceeded savor every bit if rub face  tried focus fact table overlooking pool Venetian waiter especially helpful providing excellent dining experience but none puts amazing looking profiteroles stomach    I guess just wait until open Bouchon Beverly Hills later year  But if you're Vegas want great place eat anytime day then Bouchon can't miss restaurant  <EOR> My wife came bouchon quick bite eat  ordered petite seafood platter lobster 4 different types oysters mussels strip clam  Everything great except clams   they hadn't pried open server brought crab leg crackers aide cracking them open  big failure   if order anything clams sure them opened prior arriving your table  <EOR> Went back breakfast lunch Wednesday morning 5 other people   entered around 11 seated 10 mins   hugely disappointed find things same weekday mornings weekends   First no complimentary pastries bread like raved    Also no specialty items chicken waffles   Service ok   Waiter seemed tad slow things   ordered french toast great always smoked salmon lox corn beef few other pastries  The smoked salmon lox really good   just assemble yourself cream cheese onions tomatoes etc    I thought best dish corn beef hash   corn beef really juicy meaty tender   Probably best ones tasted  Would definitely order dish again  All all good experience just bummed able enjoy weekend brunch items experience  <EOR> Loved beignets  Loved free bread jam butter  Loved croque madam  Guess just loved all    Our waitress Arleen super awesome  asked extra bread brought back lot more left  mom excited that  <EOR> Came Friday night whole fam  seated promptly  Impeccable service  needs always met staff  didnt ask water refills water goblets filled half full    The interiors very classy old world Europe  waiters suit which added its ambiance  clientele however bit casual taste particular evening  expecting dressy stuffy  But shirts shorts  But Vegas summer guess expecting much  Some people dressy balanced expectation evening    With Zin hands time finally order  limited but good menu  lot variety but prefer quality over quantity perfectly fine menu  putting order wait long while actual orders     Being French restaurant everything France took forever meal  Although first bite all convinced food really good right restaurant whole family enjoy Friday night Vegas weekend getaway   Our bill family 8 $$$ nearing $$$$  No paid attention all agreement worth it    So would recommend restaurant casual yet elegant dining  <EOR> Came checking lake Havasu  Ordered foie Gras crab beets salad  bread hard felt broke teeth  foie Gras  good Salad okay  best part meal desserts  brownie ice cream creme brulee  Both excellent  asked coffee but server forgot it  disappointed bread server forgot coffee  just bakery next time  <EOR> This review long overdue first visit dating back beginning 2011  Each three visits

Most certainly so     Good choice!  Job well done Thomas Keller! <EOR> I'm San Francisco Bay Area wanted experience Thomas Keller restaurant   impossible reservation French Laundry since going Vegas over 4th July weekend thought would try Bouchon Bistro   heard wonderful things restaurant going back season episode seven NO RESERVATIONS  one Anthony Bourdain's show Food Network   reservation immediately  and maybe should first clue something wrong   A friend restaurant Monday 7 6 09 little 6 PM   immediately seated waiter brought warm pistachio nuts bread butter   Everything looked pristine exactly would expect fine dining establishment   However place empty except few diners seated near windows   just assumed early everyone dined late Vegas   We came enjoy fine cuisine thrilled Thomas Keller's reputation didn't hesitate order most  expensive item menu  the Grand Plateau $110 plus side order French Fries  a dish Bourdain claimed better own   figured two signature dishes best!  Boy WRONG!!!!  The french fries good but spectacular   Shoe string potato fries served paper cone pretty common days least San Francisco Bay Area   hard judge restaurant solely fries waited Grand Plateau   When seafood tower arrived sampled raw oysters clams   fresh sweet   Then moved onto cooked seafood   tried jumbo prawns taken aback   shrimps meaty but no flavor bone chilling cold   Next moved onto dungeness crab   fresh crab should opaque flakes sweet meat   crab served dense meat absolutely no flavor   Ditto lobster   fact lobster tail tasted water logged   mussels also tasted little weak  like mussels half strength   I mentioned manager he suggested perhaps didn't understand texture East Coast crab lobsters since Bay Area   He also told chef steamed seafood never plunged ice water   Despite manager's chef's assurances palate knew better   seafood tasted prepped advance stored very cold refrigerator   Perhaps even gotten partially frozen soggy water logged texture actually melted ice crystals   I grew fresh seafood   father use work restaurants he would buy fresh catch day San Francisco's Chinatown family would wake each morning seafood breakfast fit king   father's best dishes jumbo prawns bursting roe steamed eggs green onions course simple cracked crab   father never overcooked seafood ate crab without any sauces because wanted savor sweetness meat   You imagine disappointed when served Bouchon's interpretation fresh seafood   hindsight obvious probably stocked seafood 4th July holiday experiencing seafood arrived several days earlier   Also since over 100 degrees Las Vegas hard keep seafood super fresh   Going back Anthony Bourdain's book Kitchen Confidential  Never order seafood Monday especially if special  fish probably delivered Thursday anticipation busy Friday Saturday night dinners  If hasn't eaten Sunday night becomes Monday's special   Frankly more insulted manager chef tried convince palates wrong rather admit food freshest   unforgiveable blame customer restaurant's failing   manager never apologized even offered complimentary glass wine dessert   When back office told everyone experience believe most co workers think twice before choosing Thomas Keller establishment future   food does live reputation afraid tough economic times he lowered standards!  If Bouchon ever upscale truly gone downhill! <EOR> Staying Venetian last month early bday celebration friends  Decided eat hotel Bouchon recommended  atmosphere great food very good  bread seemed stale though sure not  breakfast pretty good  Nothing particularly memorable aside company    It very clean staff high caliber  <EOR> My recent meal Bouchon mostly excellent great food  table service  party started cocktails which both subtly flavored high quality expected  brief designated waiting period the restaurant half empty seated attended very good waiter  menu traditional french opted variety dishes ranging simple trout amandine luxurious steak diane the special   paired food Cru Beaujolais recommended waiter it very good   food also quite good although nothing blew away    Overall very satisfied meal especially table service  However sure experience added outlay which came cool hundred per head  kind cash expect ultimate Bouchon fell just shy favorite fine dining experiences some reason  <EOR> Finally came brunch when came Vegas again!  Definitely try famous Croque Madame! AMAZING!  This place never fails me! <EOR> I crack something last time rated place   can't quality food Vegas prices anywhere else   cheap but quality very nice deal   If come breakfast chicken waffles   waffles just ridiculously good   Yeah probably most profitable item but cares?  don't waffle recipe you're gonna bite bullet   Anything braised sous vide awesome o   Desserts quite good since last pastry chef Chris left but still pretty darn good  <EOR> Very good service good food    beef spare rib date steak which lot better  fries very good lightly deep fried cod balls very good  need again hopefully give 5 stars just because best meal ever really wanted be  price high but expected should negative  <EOR> Bouchon never disappoints    croque madames delicious usual!   side bacon portion generous perfectly crispy   ended trying chicken waffles   chicken tender delicious  waffle came along good but great standalone sourdough breakfast waffle     I would highly recommend coming brunch whenever visit Vegas! <EOR> Went some friends visiting really excited try place  definitely vegas bucket list me  space hidden 10th floor Venetian kind hard find  restaurant think beautiful open space classic French design  menu isn't expansive  small way organized little confusing    We started off mimosas escargot froie grois pate small seafood platter appetizers  also served complimentary bread most delicious butter blackberry jam combination  loved escargots   puff pastry top soak garlicky oil goodness  even dipped extra bread sauce  texture escargot flavor point  froie good but really hard  spoon stand upright it  definitely taste actual froie filet better but texture good  give 3 5 stars    seafood platter beauty  couldn't stop snapping pics it  lobster flavored delicious  texture little chewy  shrimp also plump fresh but would crispier if know mean  oysters delicious!  Both kinds were  Sweet fresh  Loved them  mussels ok  Could passed that   We didn't mimosas until appetizers waitress felt bad she gave house  such sweet gesture  love when restaurants comp things when service isn't just right    For main dishes croquet Madame salmon plate burger steak hash which special  croque Madame rich buttery gluttonous  don't think eat all but friends did  also upgraded truffle fries excellent idea since delicious biggest hit  liked salmon plate  Nothing special something home though  steak hash wasn't great actually  30 bucks tasted steak hash diner    Overall great experience service wonderful  Somethings menu superb some just good standard but worth price yes guys place pricey  <EOR> You cannot world bread warm pistachios served right off   french onion soup dynamite   Couldn't eat without trying Croque Madame which fantastic steak frites also delicious   If french fry fan then you'll love it!

For main entrée ordered Croque Madame came lukewarm    my friend also ordered came cold   cheese put over creamy weird    the whole thing weird   do croquet madame  Another friend ordered Warm Asparagus salad $14 literally 5 pieces asparagus sauce drizzled it    more side rather salad  We also repeatedly ask condiments really took long time fetching us    the manager even came over told he'd more mustard then he walked away never returned      Overall experience   I probably wouldn't come back  <EOR> Have coming past 10 years visit first felt gone downhill quite bit  Overall fries entrées don't taste great preparation lacked same level care  also don't include baguette butter used which disappointing  am likely skip Bouchon future visits  <EOR> Really really enjoyed it  late dinner around 10 45PM! still took despite 10 00PM reservation pushed 10 30 hey Vegas   time doesn't exist sometimes   Friendly wait staff great steak frites awesome atmosphere  Highly recommended! <EOR> Brunched 9 29 first time  Showed around 10 30 15 minute wait   group four seated outside near pool per request rather quickly  Drinks bread coffee came quick   some small talk seemed eternity but really 10 minutes excited anticipation plate chicken waffles arrived    The chicken prepared perfectly gravy savory thick waffles lovingly accept entire boat syrup without letting any spill into your plate  Don't forget slather Vanilla Beam Butter first! Simply put very best breakfast Vegas offer  <EOR> Honestly just fine  would back again unless someone really insisted paid it  food fine service fine  But nothing great EXCEPT bread dessert! yes am fan just didnt think food much flavor  But desserts great give 4 stars  Overall say 3 5 stats     whatever means you  YMMW  <EOR> Had dinner then brunch next day   Dinner great pate de campagne starter daube de boeuf main both fabulous but brunch amazing   chicken waffles   presentation very simple elegant but eat bask wonderment truly complex was   PERFECTLY roasted chicken along chive bacon sourdough waffle along sauce chausseur maple syrup   savory sweet interplay nothing short amazing   spend some time now trying recreate dish   Couldn't happier  <EOR> Delish  2nd time just good 1st time  special Hobb's Pork Loin Benedict uh maze ing!!

You'd think they'd all Italian      But food pretty legit even if people dining not   I ordered Poulet Roti  more expected  Two pieces chicken top sweet corn kernels button mushrooms fingerling potatoes lardons which looked bacon   really really good  corn brought flavors chicken potatoes mushrooms gave just right texture  lardons good breaking taste texture chicken which admit isn't favorite kinds meat   ordered because all other types food chicken came clearly made right choice  Altogether made very delicious package  paired Pinot Gris which $11 glass but very well chicken   The service good decor good food ordered definitely worth while and price!   only complaint dessert menu little lacking interesting  single creme brulee menu!

Then another person came take order  He really showed lot dis interest  even gonna call guy out  Thanks Radaslow poor show   ordered warm chevre salad salmon rilletes  salad warm  stone cold  brought bread but only bread plate between two us! Salmon rillettes good but before I'd finished another person brought entrées befire ready  We'd ordered steak frites special lamb chop  Oh dear dear  steak frites ordinary lamb chop being freaking huge yet tasteless   struggled finish asked Radaslow box food but pack ice around it  mean Las Vegas summer car 120F inside!  Again he looked speaking     French   said look wrap food plastic wrap double then pack ice around zip lock bag  He looked confused consult someone   new guy came asked explain why wanted ice  said because hot out! Then said want show how  think he bit insulted but meant sincerely  Maybe engineer logical but you'd think they'd understand importance letting boxed food spoil! Very expensive disappointment! <EOR> Been number times love it   food great service normally would mean five stars normally  However waiter waitress ruin dining experience whole evening happened last night    hence 2 star!  Waited waited waited waitress take order   all time she talking some other guest   10 minutes later still waiting asked another waiter taking order   he told waitress still she talked he back again tell her   That meant when she came table she attitude   bad attitude  Not once did she check food once arrived  but all while talking other guests We eat every time come Vegas first time bad   enjoy but hopefully won't waitress  Staying Venetian love but disappointed dinner tonight <EOR> Ate brunch alone June 2009  food amazing I croissant Quiche du Jour along w perfectly French roasted coffee     Mimosa two! lol   Service impeccably good  Waitress checked often but much just enough let know she around if needed    Funny thing actual restaurant trek itself Elevator wedding chapel floor walk down seriously long hallway seemed hallway Poltergeist kept getting longer longer but guess because hungry found kinda annoying  ate wasn't Ms  Cranky Pants no mo found added appeal charm place haha!

I wanted eat Thomas Keller's restaurants very long time haven't yet organized enough book French Laundry 6 months advance!  So May Saturday night Vegas better half finally dinner Bouchon we very good b'fast before   didn't know before sat down Mr Thomas Keller himself attendance evening which believe between Laundry Per Se NYC pretty rare occurence Vegas    The decor impeccable authentic anything Vegas  service very good but think States long expect more prompt service used living Europe  few moments where waited glasses filled just moment long but no sooner commented fact waiter appeared are tables bugged?!?!    The food wine would expect  poached mackerel first course Serrano ham sensational  going Moules but ended old weakness Steak Frites  Frites 100% amazing but say much better Steak accepting cut meat always flank skirt etc Les Halles NYC  momentary lapse aside continued traditional French choices ordering perfect mean textbook perfect Creme Caramel Alongside glass Sauternes meal could ended better   It when finished desert noticed Mr Keller long Oak bar figured even if he didn't cook food personally knew team bringing A Game looking over shoulder!  As soon another $350 together back yes Stella Artois put Bouchon reassuringly expensive!!!   <EOR> With high powered name Thomas Keller behind restaurant expectations also run accordingly   group friends dinner felt food fairly good but fantastically so   may also due fact when Vegas many great places eat curve works against freshman college bio class where 94% B+   The highlight dinner trout almondine   am big fan trout but particular tender delicate best fish dishes ever had   sliced almonds provided nice mellow nutty contrast trout   those dishes shine without having loud flavors but yet provide soothing feel palate Saffron mussels also decent nice creamy mussels   found gnocchi very doughy bland definite pass   Overall enjoyed dining experience but sure would worth repeat visit especially town  <EOR> Amazing   Great service Oscar! course food never disappointed me  ordered chicken waffle blew away!!

 wasn't only topic conversation irksome but fact he bragging very loudly ignoring other tables   It kind ruined evening waiting dessert menu which never offered waiting check had ask busboy hearing some young punk talk psuedo UFC activities   would just say experience consistent really good beginning but down hill there  <EOR> Amazing wine list  Great service even though did put bacon vegetarian dish  would happily back  <EOR> I complete tour all Bouchons chose breakfast here  breakfast very good exactly would expect TK  Pretty much everything cooked perfectly waffles fluffy eggs  french toast perfectly good bread pudding  course all pastries wonderful    Since Bouchon Venezia tower don't feel you're casino  right off courtyard sunny Euro cafe kind feel  <EOR> Probably BEST restaurant Las Vegas   service great food exquisite   No doubt best Thomas Keller restaurants  If place good wonder what's store French Laundry?? <EOR> Food great   Tried gnocchi meal tasted small French fries shared steak dish   ratings restraunt given definitely over rated  presentation dishes came did look appetizing  <EOR> This belated dinner review September 2010   We started off some bread goat cheese nuts bowl squash soup couple salads see pictures    goat cheese great but everything else wasn't memorable   I scared rest meal would head direction salads but luckily case   entrees croque madam pork belly a seasonal special trout   croque madam delicious but then again could ever wrong grilled sandwich fried egg top?  trout superb  light flaky tender pairing well sauces veggies almonds yes almonds    also humongous!  barely finished it!  pork belly unfortunately probably biggest disappointment mostly because waiter kept raving good was    cooking traditions Taiwan Japan must spoiled because am used expecting satiny sensation pork fat melting mouth but braised pork night dry side   potatoes vegetables still good though   For dessert ordered eponymous bouchons which came three different ice creams sorbets see pictures    something would come just restaurant order but still yummy for dessert personally think better off finding Bouchon bakery stand next Phantom Opera theatre Venetian proper buy anything  enjoy comfort your hotel room    Now restaurant isn't cheap   but think if want splurge experience fine dining then place it   Huge portions high quality food Thomas Keller brand name pleasant atmosphere totally extra $$$ worth it! <EOR> As someone usually very light breakfast Bouchon quite exceptional experience    Walking greeted trio very friendly wait staff members whom directed booth near windows looking some kind garden plaza  view outside nice enough but menu offered more interesting sights  If waffles eggs fruit breakfast should try place  selection aforementioned categories impressive   Still light eater mornings tried order small salad  server thankfully would none it  She talked into ordering lobster gnocchi  also some coffee black  coffee impressively good much inquired its origins  Supposedly Bouchon serves chef selected blend three different beans  sure means but result hot drink subtle bright notes but much bitterness  gnocchi opinion extravagant very small dish  Fried capers pieces lobster gnocchi main elements fare  sufficient  plate very salty very filling excellent way convey lobster sleepy not very hungry east coaster   A cursory glance dining room revealed other patrons thoroughly enjoying dishes well most which giant waffles interesting ingredient x variety  won't leave hungry  <EOR> What great brunch!  I am morning person otherwise would brunch more often   Since special occasion rolled bed met group Venetian breakfast   There 15 us!

capital A no else seemed blown away food  <EOR> my friend took dinner touting best bistro vegas   and Bouchon didn't disappoint    wow   oyster mussles lobster platter fantastic just half platter appetizer full would pushing it    the duck INCREDIBLE   friend's lamb   We came back next night steak  <EOR> Expensive but WORTH IT   pastry platter sticky bun fruit croissant blueberry muffin cheese danish    fruit croissant favorite amazingly delicious   Blueberry muffin also way better any muffin ever had   friends loved sticky bun I'm nut fan didn't try it    cheese danish bit rich but still tasty   friends poulet et de gaufres chicken waffles gaufres au levain waffles bananas both delicious   chicken crepe which can't find menu don't know if mother's day special but most delicious thing ever eaten   life altering   friends agreed beyond delicious   honestly almost didn't because prices but would eat again any time Vegas   best place ate entire week  <EOR> The best breakfast town absolutely amazing  Definitely best breakfast town elite modern delicious  Everything look find place  Lovely place  <EOR> [Updated Oct 2007 boudin blanc good ever!]  Bouchon favorite place breakfast Las Vegas   breakfast more dozen times still look forward going   also dinner once very pleased   Bouchon very bright cheerful  combines formality informality tables graced white tablecloths but piece white paper placed top some men arrive business suits others shorts   good place bring your newspaper   When weather nice consider asking table outside   I've found service efficient friendly relaxed   However read couple accounts which described inattentive service   haven't noticed but then much service needed breakfast     **Breakfast** I've eaten way through much menu *   French Toast Bouchon style   cylinder something sweet bread pudding apples crisp glaze top   thought good but memorable   However seem distinct minority continue read rave reviews stuff   *   personal favorite boudin blanc scrambled eggs croissant beurre noisette   Boudin blanc large white sausage soft smooth distinct acidic tang   unusual enough server sometimes cautions if order but think delicious   scrambled eggs perfect example mean simple food prepared very well  eggs standard scrambled eggs but delicious cooked through but still soft creamy lots flavor   croissant varied between very good truly excellent   *   Omelet chicken piquillo peppers onion confit tarragon swiss cheese sausage links served side   daily special   sausage very good although no match boudin blanc   omelet really good   egg cooked through but still soft light but airy rich   tarragon flavor strong but overpowering   lot onions soft but squishy   chicken dry   Lastly two thick half slices toasted brioche   winner!  *   Steak hash eggs any style brioche toast   Another daily special   hash very good lots tender diced steak   scrambled eggs well prepared liked brioche lot   Again simple food prepared very well   *   Croque Madame   Toasted ham cheese sandwich brioche a rich bread made eggs butter fried egg mornay sauce top served mountain french fries   know sounds little strange but very good   *   Waffles strawberries applewood smoked bacon   waffles light fairly crisp   bacon wasn't crispy would liked but flavor very good   *   Bouchon's croissant always worth ordering sweet pastries   remember most blueberry muffin flavored blueberry juice bits fruit top made crunchy glaze sugar   *   Yogurt parfait   Rich creamy yogurt crunchy home made granola fresh berries   time ordered yogurt very good but berries unripe sour   Perhaps give another try someday     **Dinner** I've only eaten dinner once   little more animated little noisier breakfast   meal consisted of *   Beignets de Brandade de Morue   Three small balls mashed cod covered thin coating fried   essence grown cod fish cake   Very very good  *   Braised Lamb Shank   special recommended server   large piece meat soft fell off bone   Served bed potato puree along micro chives capers lots garlic cloves pimiento strips   lamb flavor strong garlic soft sweet   Also very good  *   Pommes Frites   no need order them but heard such good things Bouchon's French fries give them try   good French fries but little disappointed   Perhaps all hype made unrealistic expectations  *   Bouchons   Three small chocolate morsels brownies but crisp outside soft inside   chocolate flavor dark intense   Served small scoop vanilla ice cream earned its name  *   Mignardises   few sweets end meal   becoming more more common nice touch   When first read menu underwhelmed   no knock your socks off fancy dishes   However breakfast chef concentrated simple dishes executed them very well   very good meal indeed      A trip Las Vegas wouldn't same without least breakfast Bouchon   always leave good mood ready rest day  <EOR> As longtime hunter roll eyes duck dishes restaurants  Farm raised lot fat minimal portion  some foo foo ish care skip fine dining adventures    Plus pa didn't raise no city boy    I gotta tell duck dish 2 boys above beyond dad's roasted duck recipe    * Vegan friends stop reading *   The skin carmelized delicious friend thought bacon  quickly corrected also shocked thin layer fat  cooked little rare which actually brought more flavor  mesmerized Celtic Frost song    And wasn't  even dish but sure highlight    I opted Grilled Ham Cheese fried egg top some sort fancy sauce  decent but obviously light years away duck  don't know    it sounded good time    I did duck appetizer which square breast coated slice bacon  can't recall sauce served but excellent well    I could tell waitress burnt long night serving don't blame res 9 30pm  She still did  great job    So come quack quack point  <EOR> Bouchon offers fine bistro style fare gorgeous classy setting  However looking forward Thomas Keller dining experience but just wasn't wowed  fair food executed well wasn't disapointed quality  <EOR> I really wanted restaurant better was  Elegant setting Thomas Keller lots good excitement beautiful table scrapes  waiter very formative  party 3 opted sea bream special    The table ordered famous salmon rillette house deviled eggs start  salmon rillete unimaginative lacked seasoning spice other salt which abundance    side lemon splash freckle minced chives dish would wonderfully better worthy mention colleagues did join  Again deviled eggs beautifully presented over salted underwhelming  fairly decent chef  Part experience eating especially fine dinning locations wow factor discussions experience evokes going home trying recreate experience  Nothing first two plates did me   The main course arrived looked smelled amazing  Whole pan cooked seam bream side some sort corn cheese bread pan perdu  Three bites into fish find center extremely under cooked  asked waiter interpretation cook unsure if way serve fish 5 star French restaurants  He embarrassed took back put under the  Roiled returned 5 minutes later  fish delicious side world but experience ruined   Dessert lemon tart pine nut crust phenomenal  would order again  talking dessert whole but try forget rest dinning experience  <EOR> Our visit Bouchon Venetian highlighted excellent service great wine amazing French Onion soup   server graciously provided Champagne toast evening's special occasion   However lamb ratatouille turned very thin slices lamb which appetizing did hearty homemade taste would come expect dish   steak frites topped sauteed shallots which overpowered meat its pungent saltiness    butter which topped steak shallots absolutely frozen more halfway through meal before showed any sign starting melt    ice cream atop steak  Also beautiful patio closed evening despite warm weather Vegas summer night  enjoyed experience but would likely back  <EOR> We unbelievable meal here  Started bar helped Cicerone bartender  When seated started deviled eggs pate  pate world  Great accompaniments  Then escargot which amazing very true French style preparation  split steak frites side cauliflower gratin  Service great atmosphere great break craziness strip  Highly recommend! <EOR> I very enjoyable Saturday brunch lunch four other people  35 minute wait little before noon but fit right timeframe said would gave buzzer  chef salad no bacon goat cheese instead blue  fine substitutions salad very very tasty much better thought would be  quiche also looked really good  meal table seemed best 2 egg breakfast came coffee juice pasty addition toast potatoes $23  All same price salad looked great  coffee pretty good   as pastries  Would recommend nice meal! <EOR> I actually haven't eaten but going 2 locations bakery finding all closed thought maybe Bistro buy some macaroons    Whoever front nice thought going turn away because fancier restaurant no intentions eating just really wanted some macaroons  wish manager's hostess names because felt above beyond getting box  guy

Madam croque bit underwhelmed considering classic French dish  honestly could've made home but curious try bouchon ok    Salmon capers bread  Bf solid    So wasn't blown away food but still nice experience give 3 stars bc pleasant reasonably priced IMO  Good but great  <EOR> I thought Thomas Keller good reputation but looks he resorted trading name many contemporaries   Not very good place type serves mediocre food survives name undeserved reputation when maybe used good expectation clientele ignorant don't realize proud admit suckered getting ripped off place this   The seafood platter starter pretty good  Nothing complain although nearly epic presentation say Mastro's which really feel night out   For courses decided judge them couple bistro classics onion soup croque madame a croque monsieur poached egg top   better onion soup Bouchon  straight up  If Thomas Keller would accept challenge would Food Network cook off bury ass  soup tasted bit burnt strong overall first impression someone dumped double dose instant bouillon into pot accident  enough cheese which major pet peeve  nice place why cut costs withholding last ounce two cheese would put soup ever top?  Croque madame served cold almost completely  Once started eating found little warm spot center but definitely sitting while suppose  why food took long arrive should sent back but didn't feel waiting another hour  pretty good definitely would better served hot but even nothing remarkable  bread bit thick ham wasn't anything special  fries unremarkable consistently cooked which kind unusual problem  lot them bit undercooked rest fine but visually all looked came same batch  good McDonald's   The lemon tart dessert probably highlight meal but even occasionally caught slight stale taste   Don't bother Chinatown anywhere else still feel work it  <EOR> Two words Steak Frites     That's all remember say when server takes your order ensure enjoy your meal   french fries unreal   Anthony Bourdain raved them show knew would legit   heading back Vegas two weeks dining Bouchon again   TIPS 1  Order wine cocktails   mixed drinks little stiff  2  overly stuffy leave dinner jacket evening gown your room 3  If you've made other plans dinner consider Bouchon Breakfast  <EOR> This place definition hidden gem   Oysters galore fantastic salmon tartare deviled eggs marinated olives etc  all provided such extravagant way enjoy post lunch Yelp bucket list adventure bar side  Handmade cocktails paired pleasant beer selection hospitable professional bartender left wanting more more more  Unfortunately great finds Bouchon don't come cheap I'd say tapped fiscal responsibilities prompted spreading wealth elsewhere throughout Lost Wages trip  Highly recommended if win big those addictive slots table game your choice! <EOR> 5 stars good wine selection st  emilion bordeaux grand cru grand plateau seafood platter yummy oysters 4 stars steak frites steak temp perfect frites perfect wth 'n grilled onion concoction steak?!  would've tres bon only beurre top! <EOR> Best meal Vegas breakfast just incredible   The oeuf au gratin just amazing cooked perfection  literally melted your mouth  Even OJ stunning  cheap is anything Vegas any more? but definitely worth visit  <EOR> croque monsieur ham cheese sandwich egg over fries 4 strawberry pancakes vanilla butter 4  would come again instead buffets quality food much better <EOR> Uber pricey but worth it!

Rich decadent yet still totally balanced both proportion presentation flavors   No kidding foie garnishes citrus poached olives sweet onion vinaigrette made just single most delicious bite food ever enjoyed   wife lamb which incredible perfectly cooked scallops which divine own right   The oh so very minor downsides prevented full five stars Service seemed somewhat rushed which attribute early seating time i e  Trying turn table before proper dinner rush hit also bit disjointed   could done couple more minutes between foie appie entrees mains brought before table cleared re set main course but no silverware which could eat it   Also since mains rushed didn't fully enjoy first wine selection before next glasses table   Again very small dings report card IMO   All said done Bouchon gave dinner remember   looking forward eating 'hometown' outpost Beverly Hills! <EOR> I've eaten both Napa more recently Vegas Bouchon absolutely no complaints OUTSTANDING meal    Food great service timely no waiting   What ate Endive salad Roquefort cheese watercress walnuts lardon   Divine!

I'd return Bouchon breakfast brunch but probably dinner  <EOR> I thought okay   pretty excited try place because all good reviews but standard expecting   came group girls dinner celebrate couple birthdays before going Vegas clubs   decor very cute waiter very nice first   But when came time order he seemed surprised did want appetizers drinks   He sure?  don't want blah blah blah? don't know if he meant but made think some other girls feel uncomfortable   felt if he implying cheap something   honestly didn't want eat much because didn't want feel bloated club   course didn't order drinks because going drink later   ordered steamed mussels fries   warm bread came really good especially liked mustard   Surprising because usually don't mustard   food took unusually long time come maybe almost hour   really liked mussels   buttery white wine sauce   But thought fries unremarkable   really only mussels eat nothing else     while much   felt needed pasta rice something   maybe dish meant share   When meal almost over waiter again acted surprised when didn't order dessert   But then he said Little portions little people! didn't feel uncomfortable first time   During meal also felt water's didn't filled enough always flag someone down   All all unimpressed   don't think I'd come back dinner however lot reviews mention brunch   maybe give another shot brunch   just kind disappointed seeing all 5 stars got  <EOR> Outside ambiance very nice  Inside loud   Everything excellent except rib eye steak  Disappointing   After dozen high end Vegas dinners last few years decided every restaurant over blown  want impeccable cutting edge cuisine? Vegas  <EOR> Brunch amazing! ate dinner 2 years ago wasn't very memorable but brunch worth getting early for  ate a Tuesday morning no wait but pretty sure long wait weekends  would wait eat though good   The scenery also great  ate outside patio perfect    We started pastry basket coffee  coffee served cutest little cups  pastries delicious but very filling  just standard bacon egg toast breakfast because didn't want anything sweet  But amazing  boyfriend very indecisive he ordered two things  He french toast which extremely sweet but good  wasn't able more bite enough    He also ordered waffles which stole show  Amazing  waffles come amazing vanilla bean butter strawberries  seriously craving waffles right now! good  Worth waking early good place nurse Vegas hangover! <EOR> By Far most Delicious Breakfast Vegas!!! little overpriced!! but definitely YUMMY!!! Service Amazing view spectacular!!! <EOR> Ugh  croque madame overrated  But if ordering bread ham cheese slathered fat side fried fat maybe shouldn't complaining  ^_^  Service meh very slow  don't think rushing eat again  much prefer bakery 3 <EOR> I've stayed Venetian number times always pass Bouchon without stopping by  friend mentioned amazing brunch serve here   Figured time give try   Everything menu sounded really great but finally settled chicken waffles   realize fanciest thing menu but curious prepared chicken   Lo behold chicken marvelous   skin slightly crispy flavorful meat tender   The waffles little strange beginning   never dill waffles before but grew me   honestly fluffiest waffles ever life   Light flavorful   The service started off quite slowly   weren't given proper plating perhaps busy ran out   Otherwise service great  <EOR> Where start?   Checking in We staying Venetian BFF's birthday  called Bouchon check long wait since Sunday afternoon  gentleman told 5 minutes so  When arrived 5 minutes later 2PM receptionist told wait 40 45 minutes!
