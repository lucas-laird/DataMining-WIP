Then when he made time kindly asked recommend something he mumbled Beef Brisket Noodle which wasn't appetizing all    But really took cake finished meal waited maybe 20 minutes before ask ANOTHER server bring bill    The real shame was such nice casino would think restaurant takes prime real estate would *% # together  <EOR> To honest came decor only  figured can't really bad food wise   The decor layout beautiful very unique   Two long rows goldfish tanks   white cut damask designs all over ceiling walls   really gives clean crisp look which really liked   made reservations under Open Table which wasn't really necessary cuz isn't crazy line but 100 points   We seated immediately eventhough fashionably late which totally common Las Vegas    right?    server came she totally authentic Chinese which made think place good   Also known freshly hand stretched noodles   server comes she talks really fast really doesn't give chance ask menu   She just wanted order NOW   hate feeling rushed    ask give few minutes   We ordered pork chives fried dumpling combination chow mein which hand stretched noodles   took awhile but when food beef clearly uncooked which red pinkness it   because combination pork beef chicken showed she apologized took back brought back fully cooked   pork chives fried dumplings quite yummy chow mein pretty good but blown away good   They different pricing Total Rewards members   sure if looking review Vegas know talking about   If don't yourself players club card   Also when show them card when asking check also ability apply any points comps your Total Rewards     It gave satisfaction eating chinese food but said came check unique decor  <EOR> Although dishes prepared adequately main gripe restaurant overly priced its portions   Plus no pictures help differentiate items menu given some overlapping descriptions   small bowl Sichuan Dan Dan noodles almost $20 while 2 small pan fried pork buns cost half that   place would even more packed if reasonable prices especially dim sum menu     The service fast but friendly helpful describing recommending menu items  <EOR> Being skeptical seeing bad rating Yelp still decided give try  actually pretty good! see most bad reviews complained overpricing but Vegas restaurant located inside resort Vegas! can't expect Chinatown price over here  think price reasonable food tastes good enough match price  Especially loved Beijing style beef pancake duck meat fried rice string beans eggplants  meat zha jiang noodle salty but noodle itself decent  place looks very clean modern BTW  <EOR> Date Time Wednesday July 8 2015 @ Noon Location Caesar's Casino Level Dining Companions Mommy Husband Scene Couples Groups Tank Tops Shorts Flat Strappy Sandals Decor All White Banquettes Table Service Hot Hostesses Asian Inspired MiniDresses Efficient Servers Imbibe Hot Soy Bean Milk Devour Beijing Buns Shanghai Dumplings Total $75 60 <EOR> This place where greatly enjoy food   atmosphere very light  staff friendly   late night menu limited but before 12 30 PM extensive menu   would see more day delicious noodle dishes lamb beef duck soups <EOR> Overpriced  great dining experience  Atmosphere employee dining room instead restaurant  Food just ok  <EOR> Decent quality food small portions  Upscale Chinese dining    Great service occasionally put show front when special hand torn noodles  Would come again second visit but anytime soon  <EOR> Good soups shitty service  Possibly worst service ever head  hostess more concern hair actually taking care costumers  price high well getting  shame because food actually tasty  <EOR> Average food prior visits   ROUGH servers   Sitting Bar called server just STANDING take order  wait line when there's NO line!

Don't know why people hard place   food good chow mien dumplings   If looking quick meal give place chance <EOR> The food okay   thought service great restaurant looked awesome   However because supposed cheaper restaurants quality didn't match price   far better Chinese less   realize Vegas should more expensive   However Sushi Roku 5 months ago also Caesars Palace spent same amount far better food nicer looking restaurant  <EOR> I lunch but unfortunately waiting long  loved decoration restaurant but somehow reduced number seats  Service slow but overall food good  ordered Xiaolong bao Lanzhou noodle  Price high but Las Vegas acceptable  <EOR> As Chinese food expert no ask more terms service any Chinese noodle restaurant  service very familiar terms ALL Chinese noodle houses across which say is  Food actually quite good tourist location  Price expect Ceasars Palace  No five stars but good Chinese noodle house tourist location feel home  <EOR> Advise someone lived Beijing many years  go  Expensive tasty  mention bad service 2hour wait time  <EOR> We ate during restsurant week four course meal $50 11   portion procedes Three Square vegas food bank    only saving grace knowing doing some good   meal started seafood soup which nothing special   Next cantonese style roast duck   sure cut bird but mostly bone little meat   served cold marinated bamboo shoots   interesting because never them before but again nothing special   main course scallops asparagus   think sauce just oyster sauce very salty little greasy but scallops nicely cooked   dessert mango pumalo mango custard   pretty good   Overall whole meal just ok   way better meals price during restaurant week past   sure mediocre chinese restaurant stay buisness city Vegas all exceptional restaurant options   Would recomend   Oh yeah should mention didn't choose restaurant group   wouldn't chosen come first place because why eat chinese food when could thai!? <EOR> I really looking forward place but end disappointment   Definitely better     presentation great but over all taste eh bland tasteless   AND really expensive!!!  We chicken chow mein won ton soup dan dan noodles veggie fried rice  hand pulled noodles ok but would spend money place every again  Char sio bao $10 3!!!!!! serious?!?! china town 3 2 bucks! Serving size definitely your normal Chinese restaurant  Therefore suggest getting your own plate   Service sucks some waitresses speak very little English    The food comes cooked someone your party might food last when everyone else done theirs  good!!!! also quick attentive them if when come around otherwise take your plates away when your even done!   Hope your dining experience better mine was      <EOR> Briefly food quality definitely very good  shredded duck rice noodles soup dumplings rivaled any Chinese restaurant Las Vegas    BUT prices establishment far away some most ridonkulous you'll pay food usually very reasonably priced amount deliciousness get  <EOR>     Whattttt place almost big rip off Dragon Noodle place however place tasted slightly better   Mini Wontons = Wonton wrapper  _________ wtc  All craziness  literally doughy wrapper soup lunch  mean soup light flavorful but tasted misc  powder made soup  also extremely salty   The Lai Mien hand pulled noodles wasn't bad but awhile tastes redundant  little bit chewy side too  tiny piece beef came soup noodle saddening   I absolutely nothing spicy cold noodles   Their portions might look tiny but actually pretty hefty serving  keep mind when see price   But $20 dish on average would rather Subway sandwich 4 times  <EOR> My sister dined while back pretty satisfying meal  loved atmosphere thousands goldfish surrounding you  sister ordered tomato egg flower soup which okay great both eggplant noodles  delicious only problem being nearly enough sauce  would asked more except server being non existent until finished  good place lunch prices decent Las Vegas especially since inside Ceasars  would again just ask extra sauce before ordering  <EOR> OK service but several orders wrong group   Small meat portions soup   Shanghai Soup Dumplings good  <EOR> Egregious  Travesty  Unmitigated gall  If could give negative stars would  restaurant staffed native Chinese servers presumably cooks  server rather disinterested standoffish   I imagine because she embarrassed associated such place blatant cash grab is    I admit did hit peak time   it 3 30 pm place mostly empty  However just checked tiring day travel least conveniently hotel  also did any noodles though being stretched front us   I wish did  little usually likes congee chose congee century egg pork $15!!   Now absolutely cannot resist XLB anytime see them menu even though Shanghainese origin presumably Beijing restaurant   they also DanDan noodles Szechuan treat  regular pork XLB $14! seafood pork XLB $14!   finished ordering some Shiu Mai $12! $5 diet coke!!! OK thought prices rather high understatement   But felt same way Yank Sing SF but least food really good didn't feel robbed   The congee made water broth bits century egg smattering pork strips  nary any salt nor any seasonings any sort  result devoid any flavor surprise surprise   $15 raw ingredients totalling 25 cents  Both varieties XLB off well   though both ample soup skins very tough discolored dark hue if sitting awhile  filling surprising tough chewy well  four shiu mai fine though $3 pop you'd think foie gras truffles them  Really nothing different 50 75 cent version you'd find any Chinatown  However meal salvaged best diet coke I'd ever definitely bargain $5  Did catch sarcasm there? 'cause laying pretty thick   So total damage very mediocre actually food aspiring become mediocre meal just $75 !!!   Really no kidding  Pretty incredible  Run fast away place  <EOR> service sucks food sucks  don't recommend restaurant all  would never eat again  <EOR> Ok take restaurant any Asian restaurant    don't any Asian restaurant casinos  expensive portions small  Done no more coming better Chinatown less cheaper portions bigger more authentic <EOR> If looking real Chinese food place  isn't pf changs uber authentic  Hands down favorite Chinese restaurant Vegas  Spicy perfection  <EOR> DO FOOLED EXTREMELY HOT HOSTESS    Food mediocre best  Ive better fast food Chinese joints  ordered sauteed noodles beef which just $18 lo mein  Best thing thai tea  <EOR> Now dis cool place 2 chill eat hang N stuff  Food BomB interior off da hook  Classy  Elegant  Hip  place now da must return spot every time Vegas  Every time    <EOR> The interior decor beautiful  really liked ambiance place   I fact watch them hand pull noodles towards front restaurant entrance  also several fish tanks adds splash vibrant color otherwise contrasting white decor   The food freshly prepared but overpriced compared your typical Chinese restaurant but isn't Vegas?

I agree noodles better your average lo mien fresher just taste different but again nothing spectacular   Besides many goldfish face when trying eat food decor really nice very clean modern  <EOR> We No  9 thinking  going really least 4 star experience  restaurant no host hostess  find someone take order  say once ordered didn't take long food come  ordered Chicken Lo Mein   When tell 8 quarter size pieces chicken it  also need ask extra seasoning because does any flavor unless ask extra spices  <EOR> Food great here   I soup dumplings really good  also ordered noodle soup which amazing  parents ordered second order bring room liked much    What brings down 3 stars only? staff horrendous  just person but everyone involved    The restaurant quiet when arrived  Yet hostess made everyone wait tables empty ones she later sat them anyways     My parents 7 Star aka usually skip lines she told she'd sit next nope she didn't  She sat others next which fine if didn't wait forever also seated   She often disappeared into restaurant customers just waiting outside Where hell did she go? Then when sat down waiter wasn't polite either  He sometimes talked back parents just because mom wanted sure he used hand pull noodles other kind  He replied WELL DUH  Um thanks dude   I often give staff benefit doubt but wouldn't return especially when many options Vegas especially inside Caesars alone  much better staff elsewhere  <EOR> I ate while conference year   sat noodle bar very cool watching them noodles!  Unfortunately coolest part   beef brisket noodle bowl   pieces beef big take them bowl cut them knife fork   first may seem good thing but also cut them small enough bites could chew 30 seconds render chewy fat stuck every piece   noodles really good    maybe just cultured enough know eat them lol   using chopsticks but noodles long bite them let them fall back into bowl which resulted nice splash spotted dress shirt   If noodle short enough slurp into mouth whipped nice stream broth across face wipe off   Needless say didn't even cost any money personally because company's dime still gets 2 stars  <EOR> We love place entrance hallway goldfish   always soup dumplings  both Dan Dan noodles  very spicy good  <EOR> The interior 5 stars very gorgeous floral design looks enameled cast iron  also love goldfish tanks front restaurant    The service 4 stars very gracious attentive server allowed party 7 split bill without any hassle    The food 3 star its own definitely bad tasting food but realize you'll paying $16 $20+ entree exact same order would run $6 $8 off strip restaurant  okay occasionally paying more if see increase quality Beijing Noodle case    I Yangzhou Style Fried Rice Shrimp diced Ham diced carrots peas $17 Singapore Style Rice Noodles Shrimp diced BBQ pork scant bean sprouts few shreds julienned bell pepper $17   average but edible on table soy sauce sambal oelek welcome spices    The wait 1 star stood line 40+ minutes NYE which guess standard ? don't think so    but also move any VIP's front line which many night came lengthening total wait    The cross contamination food items 1 star beware because wheat noodles fresh house almost impossible avoid allergen contamination non wheat items  If gluten free gluten intolerant you're gonna bad time which did less hour eating location a reaction severe mimicked food poisoning   bad     Won't returning future  Better and safer eats elsewhere  <EOR> food good had lan zhou hand stretched noodles didn't change life but good   dumplings next table over looked good well   service infrequent seemed understaffed since plenty open seats but still line door     not sure they'd large parties but if you're looking calories morning definitely recommend it    <EOR> 8 just finished eating here   Service very friendly prices definitely reasonable all really enjoyed meals    I would come back again sure!  Unfortunately didn't snap any photos food but few place  <EOR> Poor service WAY OVERPRICED Chinese food!! Almost took 20 minutes orders taken served some water! top portions SUPER SMALL food only mediocre  ordered Dan Dan mein BBQ pork pancake wrap XLB bill totaling $48 00 if use your Total Rewards player's card take few dollars off your total FYI!     The only thing worth coming try BBQ Pork pancake wrap!! tasty didn't even require sauce! decently sized well literally killed within seconds!! Dan Dan mein SALTY tasted ramen noodles dry sauce packet over it   appetizing say least! XLB wasn't all great skin thick wasn't enough soup within dumpling itself  tasted pretty bland when eaten alone when combined side sauce vinegar plus ginger decent  nothing ordinary though    Venue nice everyone servers wait staff dressed traditional Chinese attire gave upscale vibe restaurant  hard find first since hidden corner near circle bar within Caesar's Palace  right before Bacchanal buffet    Overall probably won't coming back again if ever craving really good Chinese food probably venture Chinatown which only few miles away! <EOR> Service varies depending shift encounter  seats located counter overlooking boiling waters ready anticipation those fresh hand stretched noodles great quick dine in free entertainment  restaurant pulls fresh noodles during brunch lunch hours won't much show night    The food varies  If you're looking authenticity may want look elsewhere  If you're looking good ol' American Chinese food you've hit jackpot  someone grew Beijing Beijing comfort food nightly menu take food produced far China quality  However the restaurant well executed concept Beijing style food caters satisfying American taste buds    Case point? ate Beijin Noodle four consecutive days lunch dinner  each meal American's mostly ordered Kung Pao Chicken Sweet Sour Shrimp  Chinese don't really eat those dishes  Maybe American Chinese but Chinese China    You're probably asking why even ate many time row if food only meh  Well particular dish reminded grammy's cooking sliced potatoes   Each day asked them add ja tsai dish way grams did each time ate dish nearly brought tears reminiscing 4' 3 nai nai    So because Beijing style dish nearly entire time stayed Vegas  <EOR> I would give negative star if could! place just want rob you! came 9 30am planning breakfast  looked menu touch screen  Even though price little pricey $15 99 fish congee baby decided in  Once sat down waitress handed Late night menu   Found price became $21 same thing ! bowl plain congee cost $15 99!! REALLY???!!! 9 30am LATE NIGHT?? REALLY???? Feel trying scam people especially if don't look menu carefully if don't know Chinese food!  Read other reviews don't think food good!! We left!! <EOR> We love place stop every time Vegas!

The food came ridiculously fast but bit leery chicken undercooked  tasted okay never sick but didn't seem particularly well done  Similarly vegetables cut bit haphazardly  Typically vegetables cut small enough easily pick them chopsticks  vegetables left unmanageable chunks  top never actually plate  just ate off serving dish because no bothered give check me  <EOR> first time tried take out  salt pepper chicken  very good  also black bean spare ribs dim sum menu  also steam bbq pork bun  sweet  2nd time ate gf  service slow dim sum  small bowl soup 9 99 outrageous  mean understand its Vegas but portion size toddler  Anyways price overall little cheaper then other chinese spots vegas  Overall if Caesars Palace need some chinese food late night  includes some dim sum dishes place go  <EOR> Soup dumplings aka Xiao Long Bao LEGIT but pricey $13 99 6  iced tea $5 99?!

I came parents Jan 2011 craving some Asian food place sounded some great noodles  Unfortunately extremely disappointed  price high service below average wait long food just okay   I hoping some good Chinese Green Tea complimentary most Chinese Restaurants however charged person skipped that   What ordered Singapore Style Rice Noodles $16 99 menu no description family assumed would vegetarian  When noodles came pork shrimp  don't eat pork told server couldn't eat noodles  He started blaming ordering food disappointment sank in  asked if anything could done he said he would ask them just shrimp  waited least 10 15 minutes nibbling 'Crispy Chicken' getting more frustrated others being attended nicely  When food finally arrived no meat no flavor  complete waste money   Braised Beef Brisket Tendon  Noodle Soup $16 99 best dish ordered  Tasted beef stew noodles  amazing but bad  beef nicely cooked noodles pretty good too   Har Gow Shrimp Dumplings 4 $10 99 dumpling wrapper thick opinion broke easily holding small piece shrimp  Nothing special   Crispy Chicken Szechuan Garlic Sauce $19 99 small plate 'crispy chicken' dry chicken very thin pieces 'garlic sauce' side  pretty much Chicken Katsu impressed Szechuan garlic sauce  worth all   At end hoping order boba drink but server came check before asking if wanted any desserts anything else told parents mention it  <EOR> An utter disappointment    Positives 1 Server prompt good job  2 sat almost immediately surprising Friday night 6pm  3 shredded pork entree nice spice it   Negatives 1 Sat bar right front restaurant area hadn't properly cleaned water glass still remaining bar top needed wiped  Server cleaned dry paper towel should left then  2 Wife ordered beef n broccoli  Both meals came quickly however she found various uncooked beef gelatin well parts still being cold  3 both ordered brown instead white rice knowing would additional $10 each roughly cup rice until received bill  4 Most importantly including area bar kitchen need cleaning  ceiling over where pasta including ceiling lights camera filthy large visible dust accumulation  Also divider between bar kitchen visibly hadn't cleaned thoroughly quite some time   We debated between Searsucker boy lots regret part sorry Caesar's better  <EOR> Delicious 24 hour spot  recommend bbq pork steamed bun  decor very fun  must try when you're hungry hours! <EOR> Authentic Chinese food Las Vegas? Hell yeah!  Rule thumb Chinese restaurant isn't authentic if service great even service pretty authentically bad! Still above average Chinese restaurant though! Also also pretty excited visit Bejing Noodle No  9 because your typical authentic Chinese restaurant resembles hole wall but place really REALLY nice inside! course its strip Las Vegas everything nice inside!  I couldn't believe girlfriend Chinese native when vacation San Francisco suburb where most good food Asian come Las Vegas eat MORE CHINESE FOOD  prices aren't great but then again  recurring theme if eating Las Vegas strip  prices would never acceptable if found restaurant outside Las Vegas but works strip    As far food pretty fucking good! Any place serves hand pressed noodles barring any major setbacks automatically four stars book  take even further even prep chef see outside restaurant through window hand pressing noodles some sort culinary show   My girlfriend ordered beef noodle soup Xiao Long Bao pretty bomb really didn't expect find such good Chinese food Las Vegas  splurged $30 duck meat fried rice which best fried rice ever had  $30 better damn well be  also ordered Shu Mai which actually pretty average San Francisco standards but still hit spot  Also place gets bonus points using real tea leaves tea  ordered Pu'er tea drank all it!  If your comfort food xiao long bao xiao mai beef noodle soup you're Vegas should check place out  If extent your Chinese food experience Panda Express kung pao chicken should also check place glimpse authentic Chinese food  <EOR> Not sure why all bad reviews   eaten least 6 times bad experience   always sit bar area where hand pulled noodles   Usually never wait food always comes quick   Maybe different regular dining area?
