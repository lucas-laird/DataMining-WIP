Interestingly combine common American Chinese dishes find Panda Chinese buffets put own spin keep hint authenticity  Walnut shrimp? Its winner  personal favorite curry fried rice potatoes  all all better your average take and much Chinatown's greasy rice but somewhere take your mother law Shanghai  <EOR> way off strip but read good things press made trek  just ok  apparently owner town some time menu limited when no buns   house special fried rice which tasty but really worth drive opinion   maybe when full menu returns willing back give another shot  <EOR> By far best fried rice plates Vegas  $5 plate can't this!!  place must chef Bob awesome  <EOR> The BEST Fried Rice World!!    right Las Vegas!!
