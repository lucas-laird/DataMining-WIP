Many employees hanging doing nothing bit aggravating wait someone really notice your group   I ordered appetizer which decent but small portions Pink Taco Platter chicken beans picked onions avocado   Honestly food terrible  Chicken sorta cold beans mushy picked onions didn't much taco shell oily hell  colleague bit underwhelmed service delay practically full before main order even taken Due abundance complimentary tortilla chips being served non waiter    On drive back all mutually agreed very underwhelming dining experience  wouldn't mind going back place drinks but when place called Pink Taco serves shitty tacos   its game over! <EOR> For years Pink Taco go to happy hour spots cheap eats two for one drinks  But when brother came town recently husband decided splurge hit PT dinner  It helped $100 comp use! We started pitcher sangria order bacon wrapped jalapenos  entrees husband carnitas chopped salad brother six street tacos one each several varieties   pitcher pricey $48 but everything else $1 off when used player's card   I LOVE chopped salad nice blend lettuce turkey hominy pepitas  always thought used jicama well but when read menu more closely saw apple  weird choice but tasty! husband loved carnitas well  He asked no cilantro brought big chunks pork onions tomatoes guac side  let create own soft tacos delicious cilantro free toppings  LOT meat he nice leftover meal  brother impressed tacos however  Didn't care tortillas thick fan fillings although he ate all fillings left tortillas behind    The salsa usual pretty bland sangria seemed lot sweeter years past  But husband both enjoyed food  price right! using $100 comp owed less $2 pre tip !

Sadly they're now trading name quality dropped off tremendously  offer three salsas chips when sit down wife used destroy them all  last time month ago because wife jonesin' some good chips salsa couldn't more disappointed  salsas bland watery lacked any unique taste  asked server she said six seven months ago changed recipe  always fan sabano de pollo  extremely rich but extremely juicy flavorful  used think fat kid cake birthday feels  good time around may good times past but just couldn't over betrayal cheapening ingredients   House margaritas solid service good  <EOR> This isn't best Mexican food world but late night menu really hit spot 3 AM when craving tacos   done gambling evening hungry   I chicken taco combo which consisted 3 tacos beans rice   fast food job done hour night   <EOR> I don't know why people think place good  Although service great place does serve authentic Mexican food  begin rice Mexican  serve white rice mixed canned vegetables  salsa also freshly made  nearest taco shop better salsa  ordered  combination plate which came Chile relleno veggie taco rajas tamal  veggie taco most edible thing plate  cost $18  Maybe am being harsh because am Mexican know Mexican food should like  also ordered guacamole appetizer 3 5 5 stars  all place way over priced quality food serve  Good luck if come here  <EOR> Came happy hour because stating HRH  excited try happy hour but only few appetizer offerings 50% off  waiter said margaritas buy but when check presented later charged both margaritas find only HOUSE margarita buy free  wasn't explained all pretty much ruined chances ever coming back again    Ordered tortilla soup which happy hour offering which pretty delicious filling  also appetizer platter all things platter only sweet corn tamales    Overall would never come back again would just walk hotel meal fix  suggestion Pink Taco would clearly designated menu just Happy Hour drinks food lot people would screwed over less way  <EOR> Extreme tourist trap  Watered down food drinks ridiculously pumped prices    My GF shared pitcher Cadillac Margaritas $57 which contained 6 margarita glasses worth neither even tiny buzz when finished it  seemed no Grand Mariner Cadillac mix either    We ordered Queso Fundido $10 which should just melted cheese chorizo as menu said but dish served mostly some gross enchilada sauce poured into dish dilute cheese with  Yuk   Pink Taco Las Vegas might fooling tourists around world unfamiliar Mexican food but people Mexican food fans place ain't nothin' but rip off  <EOR> Absolutely delicious! Try queso bean dip!  wish place closer could all time    definitely casual lunch while you're Vegas!! <EOR> The food Pink Taco nothing amazing  basic Mexican fare few flares there  did expect when walked into Hard Rock hotel establishment abundance tequila had   and prices per shot bad considering Vegas     I glass Milagro Reserve Anejo El Tesoro Anniversary Tequila  Both great   as staff takes pride liquid refreshment  If mood good tequila served without salt lime then sure head Pink Taco Hard Rock!!! <EOR> Yummy always !!

Drank some Ice Tea enjoyed food !! <EOR> We going see Rascal Flatts Joint  told great part town crowd different strip  But Pink Tacos recommended  loved it!

Their Happy Hour 4 7pm fantastic!  I'd hard pressed find another place where two people eat drink even if beer NA $12   specials only available bar but early seat  <EOR> La comida esta bien lo que alcanzamos ordenar sin embargo el servicio deja mucho que desear en la barra definitivamente eres ignorado y por más que quieras pedirle otro mesero no te hacen caso en conclusión comida buena con un pésimo servicio al cliente no vale la pena    <EOR> Cool place! We stopped dinner while place kind dead great inexpensive meal unheard vegas   Those chips damn delicious nearly ruined 3 steak taco dinner  Happy hour pretty nice 2for1 bottled beer well 1 2 priced apps   My buddy says place usually rockin thursday night really something special once Rehab starts may  <EOR> Chips tasted freshly made  Ordered quesadilla which delicious  stuffed cheese couldn't finish perfect!   Wife wet burrito also couldn't finish but said delicious  Waitress staff didn't rush when still eating past closing time  <EOR> For all great places eat area I'd skip Pink Taco unless staying Hard Rock needed something fast   pretty standard Americanized Mexican but think dropped ball few key areas   First off chips salsa   chips A+ some best restaurant chips ever had   But salsa   D    gave 3 different kinds tomato based dark green light green   Each tasted pretty much same ZERO spice them   I ordered chicken tacos which came rice beans also tried chicken skewers   tacos basically chicken pico de gallo tortilla   All ingredients good but little cheese seasoning chicken!  chicken skewers little spice them finally!    The service quick everything came correctly but waitress clearly mood friendly group 16 guys tip well   loss suppose  <EOR> My wife always start off trips Las Vegas lunch Pink Taco  favorite Mexican places eat Las Vegas   It's traditional Tex Mex fare but all pretty good  sure some guacamole  Don't load much chips salsa even though its hard   sure leave enough room enjoy your entree   The service usually pretty prompt attentive also  Can't wait back  <EOR> Ate June signature item pink tacos which chicken tacos pickled pink onions top  okay but rice beans mediocre   If signature item merely okay basic accompaniments mediocre would suspicious other items menu  <EOR> I've Pink Taco many times always great experience ! Great food friendly staff fun environment  Happy Hour try chile relleno tacos Hot Pink margarita ! <EOR> While some friends walking around lazy Sunday stumbled into place   The people worked friendly wasn't busy prices reasonable especially Vegas food okay '  As soon sat down serves chips three different types salsa which all surprisingly good  ordered house margarita which delish appetizer sampler split between three girls  server also nice enough inform $2 $3 more three each appetizers instead two each sampler all each appetizer  appetizer okay though nothing special but guess shouldn't expected much hotel restaurant   Service good server very friendly informative but really peeved ask water refill TWICE   Sunday afternoon Vegas  Hellooooo obviously hungover desperate need water  <EOR> I'm guessing name concept Pink Taco hatched Harry Morton CEO just polished off six pack Mickey's Malt Liquor senior prep school   Under big mouth beer bottle caps requisite Mickey's puzzle picture which Harry thought resembled female body part     Harry looked picture through beer induced haze announced D u d e looks pink taco me  tender age 18 moment soggy entrepreneurial brilliance Pink Taco restaurant conceptualized   rest history Morton's restaurant dynasty Think classy Morton's Steakhouse over 70 locations worldwide       Fast forward going Hard Rock Casino needing quick bite eat before concert   Hard Rock Casino doesn't great number mid level dining options ventured into Pink Taco   Here's found The wait relatively short line 15 people took 30 minutes   Customers Hard Rock Casino players cards bypassed line which galactically annoying those formed queue hungry customers   The hostess overwhelmed trying find tables people   Overall staff including waiters seemed working frenetic pace   Things seemed unorganized understaffed      The food okay but overly impressive   If came somewhere Midwest where Taco Bell your favorite Mexican restaurant you'd excited authentic food Pink Taco gush Yelp   If grew Socal you'd say meh  A margarita rocks bartender's weak pour Patron cost $15   I wait such long time change which relatively substantial walked away it   time more valuable       Ironically waitress possessed average skillset did nothing remarkable financially rewarded inefficiancy restaurant operation       If you're tourist likes idea oversized souvenir dink container Eiffel Tower sling find name concept restaurant snicker here    Despite you'd think Harry's Pink Taco doesn't serve Mickey's Malt Liquor  figure?

Ever since updated menu carne asada tacos same  First portions smaller attempt gourmet plating then regular size portions brought back but quality food good first time   I use love eating carne asada tacos but no more  last visit meat over cooked tasted very dry old beef jerky! no longer use real guacamole!

Good example pissing off long time cutomer because table seemed salsas little better another        very short sighted     food good always service always <EOR> My husband visited place during recent trip Vegas  far favorite restaurant during trip    I ordered chicken quesadilla Pina Colada margarita thoroughly enjoyed both   husband ordered chicken nachos he enjoyed those well   The service great well  definitely visit place again next visit Vegas! <EOR> I love place very much just can't enough!!

NO idea why served corn cob btw Honestly place earns 3 stars solely deelish corn margaritas    Sorry review vague    but Vegas pretty sure killed alot brain cells weekend  <EOR> Not bad place stop if you're Hard Rock Casino  margaritas good but bit over priced quality same food   bacon wrapped jalapeños corn cakes very tasty would those again  found beef tacos bit bland  nice atmosphere patio fun  <EOR> Loved atmosphere server very friendly!   I ordered street tacos carne asada rice beans  asada little dry but noticeable Pico de Gallo added some salsa which really good made taco perfect! ride beans seemed little bland little easier eat would mix them together use chip which made better    Would definitely come back again! table behind ordered fajitas smelled looked delicious! <EOR> The food really good! only complain service sucked food before appetizer chips salsa food?  but noticed pretty much sucked every restaurant Vegas  guess don't care tourist lol  why no any tips  lol <EOR> Came new Sunday all eat brunch   Food great!!! must try bloody Mary's!! good!!

Kudos Pink Taco!!!!  Another thoroughly enjoyable meal   thank you!!! <EOR> Be warned folks      know you're going drive around Las Vegas looking Mexican food but place does disservice Mexican food    It's amazing tasteless food could dished maybe its better when you're inebriated  Doubt it!  However guacamole ribs OK  <EOR> Wow Americanized taco place midst Vegas craziness decent much less good? Four stars sure   They basic meats   beef chicken pork   corn flour tortillas  little more variety beef like certain PART beef but hold onto your stomachs pretty safe say don't carry favorite part = The meat flavorful tough veggies fresh tortillas weren't starchy fact borderline home made status   Drinks good apparently Happy Hour? Niiiice  <EOR> Yay Vegas Pink Taco!  love always stop margaritas chips when Vegas  <EOR> They lot good things but nachos favorites  steak tender tastes great    The tacos aren't most traditional ones you'll find but sure good  Fish tacos amazing here  <EOR> I ate twice while staying Hard Rock Hotel few weeks ago  portions fairly generous food very good   Price wise average most casino restaurants but outrageous any means  ordered enchiladas thought very good possibly some best restaurant   I would recommend restaurant anyone craving some good mexican food  only complaint particularly impressed breakfast menu hence only 4 stars   <EOR> The food alright considering its chain Mexican restaurant   Definitely better Chevy's   pink tacos ordered pink tacos natch but soggy couldn't even pick them lame   salad pretty good but could made same thing home   Overall good place come your friends loud grab some drinks eat fairly decent meal  <EOR> the food yummy  large portions   we wait kinda long food kept eating chips salsa not bad!  Fun atmosphere! service pretty good   just hated waiting food! <EOR> I'm giving 3 stars  food always good     sort love crunchy shrimp tacos   honest though     Street tacos price point really only justified hot starving REHAB pool party goers end default   I've several times     Each time walking away generous amount guilt amount money spend such mediocre plates! <EOR> For all hype hear place just sucks   Maybe better before but feeling if don't look Hollywood elite you're scoffed at   waitress finally decided bless presence explained happy hour 2 1 drinks   Great wife said ordered 2 margaritas   She shows 4   What's asked   2 1 she explains order 1 bring 2   If wanted 2 each would fucking asked FOUR!!!  When told didn't want 2 each she looked put off is REALLY first time ever come sweetheart?!? but did take away extra 2 margaritas   few more beers lackluster appetizer sampler bounced  Fuck Pink Taco  <EOR> Had all eat brunch Sunday pretty good  setting isn't very inviting staff cold  Most tapas good but did any sort creamer coffee which odd considering serve breakfast coffee  <EOR> i say really place  wouldnt say its best place world but its solid  wouldnt necessarily way but if im hardrock its choice places there  tacos small though  the burrito good fagitas appetizers also bring free chips salsa tables   the service also pretty good both occasions   my only complaint regards food rice seemed undercooked though dried sitting  also dont salad its sweet? odd but hey im sure some people salad so     all all good place bite eat  <EOR> Food decent greasy full flavor  ate last time Las Vegas 4 years ago  raved food  since changed menu little disappointed  BUT pineapple margarita impeccable!

Service bar beyond fine always offered another beverage    During visit dining room shrimp tacos best lot had  beef tacos OK but didn't love fruit pieces pineapple? them  bacon wrapped jalepenos appetizer ok but also disappointment  taquitos item never disappoint! Portions good sized offer happy hour dining room  Happy hour offered however during Joint concert nights  Beware! The atmosphere usually quite lively decor seems appropriate inviting same time  <EOR> What disappointment  husband's huge Mexican food fan going off strip poker tourney Hard Rock stopped Pink Taco  waitress nice lady but food just awful  Horchata colada tasted likely colada cinnamon it  pork platter chewiest dry pork ever  Could fast enough  Save your money try another restaurant hard rock  <EOR> Brilliant timing Pink Taco visit Hard Rock Hotel Vegas!
