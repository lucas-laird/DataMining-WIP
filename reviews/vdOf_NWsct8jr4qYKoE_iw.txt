Plus cutlet lunches come unlimited cabbage rice just true tonkatsu joint score 2  Finally crumb use cutlets slightly coarser grain compared use kushi age which better crunch hat trick awesome!  The first time came hubs ordered tonkatsu ordered jidori cutlet  Although tonkatsu good serving size tonkatsu kind skimpy compared jidori cutlet  jidori cutlet gives good portion juicy tender chicken  Fantastic  Ever since visit hubs ordered chicken well   So end come jidori cutlet lunch special only don't really feel huge urge stray given excellent value compared other items tried past  4   <EOR> Came lunch  Service good food good wasn't wowed anything here  But would probably back  ordered sashimi lunch 10pc kashiage chefs choice  <EOR> Great food affordable too  Ordered salmon dish oyakudon both yummy  Wish photos post but gobbled right away  <EOR> The food really delicious  tried pork fillet which never eaten other Japanese restaurant   wonderful  <EOR> I expecting portion food big  looks placement dish very nice  ordered chicken cutlet lunch beyond expectations  chicken tendered fried very crisply  Rice soft moist very good thing compared other restaurants  parents ordered 6 piece took some eat  Still fried perfection tasted extremely good  only problem wait time food come  am pretty impatient when comes waiting food but end all worth  restaurant worth sharing friends  5 stars <EOR> Very pleasant experience!

Thank Yu  Yu!!!!!! <EOR> First all place's rating artificially inflated because give discount giving them positive Yelp review    Honestly place deserving 2 3 stars  bad but all good either  Just mediocre Japanese food  Kushi age appears specialty  tried half dozen things  Beef pork smelt some veggies  While tasted pretty good general all unpleasantly greasy  all fried food but just kinda nasty  If pulled fryer just little earlier would've made world difference  fried Jidori chicken wasn't quite greasy kushi age  fine but rather uninteresting under seasoned   didn't feel need eat any more first couple pieces  agedashi tofu okay  Nothing special  Just mediocre  pork chicken katsu can't recall meat since just stole bite friend  Yeah unmemorable  salmon battera basically salmon nigiri much rice  quality fish actually pretty decent place relatively few raw offerings  fishy smelling neon orange  probably best thing had    All all I'd recommend bothering place  plenty better alternatives neighborhood  <EOR> I am excited come here!!!
