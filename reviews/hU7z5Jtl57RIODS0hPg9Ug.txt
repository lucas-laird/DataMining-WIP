Huge delicious!   Staff  friendly! <EOR> The carne asada tacos great salsa bar pretty good 4 5 options little cups  Open 24 7 <EOR> I know place lot good reviews but honestly don't see many people think great  folks never real Mexican food?   My boyfriend tried place first time last night impressed   This place real Mexican food  beans grey milky tint them entirely flavorless  tortilla soggy  Seriously mess bean cheese burrito?!? these    Fake beans? Powdered beans? Yuck Yuck Yuck!!   My boyfriend ordered quesadilla looked taco   I noticed advertising some seasonings thought odd    We order carne asada fries terrible  First all hell carne asada fries big fat steak fries?!? Yuck! carne asada looked chili very sausey  top off loaded seasoning  Yuck! Since when does carne asada fries seasoning? mean covered disgusting seasoning  seasoning really appropriate dish  fairly certain seasonings advertised  Maybe some people but wasn't us   I gave two stars because place really clean inside hot sauce great  service also really good    This appears man show  see could problem times    Perhaps disappointed because San Diego know real Mexican food tastes like!   I really wish owner would consider using higher quality ingredients    This place just isn't us  Everything few dollars more other places  many other taco shops choose won't returning  <EOR> Both times there's only single guy running show taking orders making them serving them  All guy  lot person handle   Fish taco huge filling but I'd personally ask without pico theirs ton jalapeno just overpowered great fish me  Burritos good size good price under $5! but add extras cheese sour cream guac  Still bad deal   Salsa bar five different options all which tasty own way  Signage suggests customers only take need current meal which strikes odd seeing fresh salsa doesn't actually keep all long place never busy  <EOR> Came middle night taco craving but once decided try carne asada torta  pictures some items mouth watered soon saw pictures torta! There guy working he super friendly great customer service   The seating limited but night only boyfriend  appreciated food super fresh could see cooking it  problems Robertos where food sitting then just slabbed tortilla put grill  My torta very flavorful enjoyed things came pico guac sour cream but ruined carne asada  While flavors great meat itself cut thick just SUPER chewy  thought being picky until boyfriend said same thing  made really difficult eat enjoy because took much effort bite rip meat apart   not mention work chewing tough thick carne asada!  The salsas offer all delicious  i couldn't differentiate which best because all great  however very spicy if enjoy heat probably enjoy because isn't unbearable   just really hot! I also ordered horchata 3 caramel churros  horchata typical horchata nothing amazing it  churros fresh delicious but honestly couldn't taste feel any caramel inside  complain because ate all 3 good! Overall wish tacos  I love tacos el gordo pinches tacos hoping find another competitor  Haven't decided if back try more! <EOR> I excited try place but wow disappointed  ordered 3 roll chicken taco fish taco carne asada fries flan  None them good nor appetizing  Also pricing gone nothing worth it   never going back place  also $ 50 credit card charge which don't tell just change you  Really annoyed place  <EOR> Everything place wrong  sure thinks place even half decent  guys real Mexican food??? rice terrible no flavor beans equally bad  mention order wrong  guess no pico means extra pico  once never going back  Robertos 10 times better cheaper! <EOR> I came first time new taco shop kindest people cooking amazing food absolute pleasurable experience  taste love food  Great food fast service  24 7  <EOR> I love carne asada fries here  give special sauce world  prices items best Vegas  favorite mexican food spots town <EOR> Such great find open 24 7!!
