She then said she would call manager even though  title she took beginning conversation   She came back phone call took down info saying manager contact 15 minutes  NEVER heard them took $50 account no reason  Talk poor customer service! <EOR> The design Starbucks quite futuristic  love much location  missing star fact don't honor rewards program  sure why Starbucks location would this  fact earn stars but can't redeem anything confusing factor most people think   I know rewards program used fact free refill policy covers everyone might hurt business but least birthday reward drinks should honored  significantly more expensive drinks should cover that  Being prime location want pay extra dollar no harm least me  <EOR> The price SB least double most drinks no refill  Prices such things coffee mugs 50% higher    They should put sign says no refill  <EOR> Been many Starbucks no complaints one  Business above average but didn't feel though wait  3 gentleman working quite efficient answered inquiry flat white which never heard did enjoy  people watching abundant 2 30 afternoon surprised me  Being local Las Vegas hardly ever come strip glad did today  <EOR> My review reflects outrageous prices! looooove Starbucks! love delivered same food coffee quality however   you'll pay double everything can't use rewards won't stars your purchases? What's point calling Starbucks if lose brand loyalty customer service  Lame lame lame  <EOR> Because owned casino don't participate Starbucks promotions give free drinks rewards program which kind shitty  strip prices  unnecessarily high don't even souvenir mugs Las Vegas  Being Crystals mall also pretty loud distracting probably wouldn't return  <EOR> Horrible staffing! know hotel busy but still only staff few people  many Starbucks but 1 managed poorly   lying maybe 40 people line  If don't care size line then give them money  don't need coffee bad   Here tip take escalator down Roasted Bean  No line friendlier service  <EOR> It's Starbucks  lattes where good timing expected   knock down score because didn't think put finger $8 ham cheese sandwiches sure weren't still frozen   Argh  <EOR> Average Starbucks  Slow drive thru needed repeat order three times  <EOR> This place $2 more just because Aria  praline latte usually venti which $5 25 anywhere else  $7 25!! stopped myself short  If hadn't hub Invisalign removal already would've gone different coffee place  But alas he insisted latte  ordered grande came $6  also charge $ 50 tax!!! No other Starbucks does that  just price  Ugh Las Vegas loves charge exorbitant amounts money don't they?! <EOR> Wow tacky place be?  ordered coffee then asked some water want charge $1 08 free water every single time every single Starbucks tacky Starbucks need take better care your customers <EOR> Watch ring rang black tea lemonade when ordered just black tea  clerk claimed because asked splash flavoring not even pump syrup   2 drinks + small food items $20  Bad service rude employee   The employee made drink did add flavoring which nice    Aria employees need trained meet your service levels learned expect  <EOR> I wanted grab something quick morning before heading off see Hoover Dam line Starbucks  ordered usual Venti latte Macchiato banana   wasn't until paid SB app noticed cost over $9!   what rip off! <EOR> Excuse why grande green tea frappe usually $4 45 over $7 here?

Drinks much pricier traditional Starbucks   at $5 tall Latte     The line tends long entire process take 15 minutes start finish      at least you're able charge things your room! <EOR> STAFF MORE PEOPLE!!!  There's always 30 minute line morning   Plus cashier would let penny ride $25 01 tab  <EOR> During travels all over country general stop Starbucks coffee   location provided absolute worst service seen Starbucks   waited twenty minutes line generally did seem know manage serving drinks nor did care   If staying Aria definitely find another spot coffee  <EOR> Not good experience location  don't accept Starbucks app prices posted food items etc  coffee prices all 1 3 higher typical  <EOR> This visit disappointing  fashion center actually walked all way location because friend wanted come particular Starbucks  complaining walk but definitely quality product served location  ordered cafe late cappuccino  surprise both tasted same felt Drinking just hot milk  friend didn't want take back because he doesn't confrontation all but confronting getting your money worth  Any took mine back let them know even gave them benefit doubt maybe machine working then attendant takes back gives another saying give try because did put shot coffee it  Honestly same thing frustrated no point say anything any more because should fixed moment told them it  Any much excitement walk all way location lol should just gone mall  If same experience least would save trouble walk  If come location your own risk! <EOR> I drawn Starbucks location because looks beautiful plenty comfortable seating  husband stopped americanos breakfast wraps  americanos quick good but wraps disappointing  took while looked very unappetizing  wrapped well falling apart   When bit into wrap some parts breakfast wrap very hot some parts ice cold   If just looking coffee your probably safe however would recommend stopping food  <EOR>
