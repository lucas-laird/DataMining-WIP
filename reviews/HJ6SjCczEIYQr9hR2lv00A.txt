Well if croissant doughnut baby  fritter described buddy being airy  totally agreed but lacking anything apple fritter an    apple fritter   two pastries delicious   bought big fritter bring back boy   When meal arrived small stature but enormous flavor   Particularly doughnut burger which split two ways   mouth left brain NO idea taste buds attempting communicate   little bastard six star experience!

Great experience! <EOR> Our family tried sampling six different cronuts each sweet soft flaky layers deliciousness   Sadly when came Wednesday morning place empty  I'd really see place flourish  Maybe could step notch two marketing   Service friendly though could use bit more pep   Actually whole atmosphere drab side   would come again cronuts <EOR> Kronuts availability low hours still crap  seems can't keep up    Smh <EOR> I drove all way CLOSED!  open Til 3 00pm HELP wanted sign   open timing needs updated Yelp! <EOR> Very disappointed  Very table place dirty stuff floor  All napkin dispensers empty   Despite menu says must spell exactly want your burger  still wrong   The food itself pretty good great but dining experience wasn't  Also 28 bucks two burgers drinks fries  <EOR> Kronuts very good! breakfast impressed breakfast but then again says al's donuts speciality breakfast    many high chairs around little ones also bummer  omelette needed more cheese honestly didnt even seem omelette wife breakfast sandwich also pleased it <EOR> Love place! Friendly staff n awesome cronuts  Gotta try maple bacon cronuts best! <EOR> First time Al's while having tires serviced discount tires across street  First impression confusing menu  Apparently menu wall behind counter no longer valid  given printed menu's instead laminated  menus felt very dirty  ordered two breakfast ham sandwiches bagel coffee  given coffee right away but wasn't hot just warm  Usually put cream sugar coffee but all powered non dairy creamer  breakfast restaurant should offer fresh cream minimum little cups half half  just black coffee today  But mentioned Luke warm tasted horrible  burnt taste    Got ham sandwiches fairly quickly but disappointment  Bagel wasn't toasted  much egg ham ratio all tasted egg  Just flimsy piece ham  $7 sandwich you'd think could  put little more ham it  wasn't necessarily bad sandwich but certainly worth $7  Very bland    I don't see myself coming back  many other better options area  <EOR> How open lunch when 12 20pm kitchen closed?   Sorry Café Burger only 1 star because less option  <EOR> Simply stated if fan curious cronut spot indulge sweet crispy soft surrender! Minus mayhem trying cronut let alone enough office Pink Box  fun part Al's cronuts come variety fillings frostings  They're all delish just each  <EOR> Finally place cronuts everyday! just 9 00 am just weekends  Love idea pettit cronuts   many favors doz $6  Great  Other food good but pastries great  <EOR> A small quiet cafe  great food tho  kronuts scrumptious sweet some other places  burgers also very tasty  most likely going become regular  <EOR> I American burger fries here    GREAT! Business picked while sitting waiting burger everyone looked happy    New business area back again again! <EOR> The service lacking past few times gone holding donuts kronuts back barren display case  When asked kronut cashier asked which would she'd into back but am supposed know which I'd if can't see them?  Also bought Groupon dozen kronuts Saturday them but cashier said she want allowed accept Groupons weekends anymore which doesn't state anywhere voucher came back Thursday owner came told he could dozen mini kronuts return even though voucher dozen regular kronuts when questioned he said he doing favor because he wasn't accepting them anymore  refused mini kronuts he said could take Groupon continued complain Groupon customers come Groupon vouchers   Don't find some other donut place OWNER rude disrespectful  never returning  <EOR> First time trying cronuts pretty tasty  Three different filling options available lemon great flavor  But still think prefer donuts where disappointed  only couple donut flavors plain glazed chocolate frosted Bavarian creme filled  Despite trays glazed filled donuts counter behind case apparently weren't sale! Plain glazed donut just average  need more signs indicate flavors case  rang bell service still wait while someone come help us  patron waiting behind gave left  biggest annoyance some employee's child sitting dining room watching video full expletives  don't think heard f bomb many times restaurant  better more affordable options NW valley  <EOR> Three stars least Cro nut which hubby loved but frozen patties hamburgers?  kidding me?

After yelping around area hamburgers saw place figured we'd give try burgers   Located newer strip center N  Las Vegas Saturday 6pm expecting several people establishment however only 4 people! good sign visual judgement quickly adding very plain brown cream colored walls basic table tops some goofy couch nested back quickly wondering if Al's gonna live its reputation    This typical walk order type cafe  desert display walk hosts all Donuts Cronuts available while 6pm certainly expecting see pastries but few all still looking fresh even knowing AM   I ordered Texas burger gf ordered Buffallo Bill burger  Fries extra  offered add toppings cashier did great job explaining burgers pastries  She actually talked couple cronuts ordered Chocolate covered bavarian cream filled nut toppings gf ordered Maple covered bavarian cream filled bacon toppings!  A standard soda fountain offered drinks well coffee tea offered    We sat down 5 minutes later cronuts brought table followed another 5 burgers fries   We quickly surprised good burger appeared basket large cut fries  Biting into burger very tasty followed Texas burger description  Overall both burgers very pleasing straight greasy dry  simple burger think yourself home but never seem come just right   Cronuts both very tasty well although felt Maple better Chocolate regards bavarian cream tasted more fresh but both good!   In conclusion easily return simple burger pastry  Remember cafe decor minimal nothing all flock over ready enjoy food  <EOR> If haven't tried Cronuts then haven't amazing twist donut   The store only limited amount would suggest calling ahead arriving early morning   The location across Enterprise Rental Car  <EOR> We saw sign marquee day wondering place was  Today looking new burger place try popped again  looked menu did know place??! came ate bit everything  burgers top notch  Loved fries  Coffee smoothies point donuts sight! glad found place!! Oh counter girl super nice! <EOR> They refused sell donuts because large order told other location over 30 minutes drive away! <EOR> Trying new place  Service good  Ordered online   Food ready almost time specified   Service fast friendly <EOR>
