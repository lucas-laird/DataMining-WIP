Why maybe 3?   For past few months almost NEVER your food within specified time frame  Order over phone they'll say 15 minutes but should expect 30 minutes  Maybe they're crowded? Nope  Unless think 2 3 couples who've already served food constitutes crowded    The next thing aggravated last time began trying pass off  watery goop ghetto rigged korma regular dinner version  Occasionally real deal which always satisfying but today when stood around yet again 15 minute late food only come home Water Korma again done  It's become apparent don't begin cooking your food until show up   To top off manager never knows pronounce name   They never put napkins bag  never put forks spoons  actually tell them   Lastly prices pushing it  naan $3 opinion need two orders because give enough naan  dish naan $20   $20 meal feed regular sized male person             Summary 1 Star serving poor quality food 1 Star customer service 1 Star pricing 1 Star wasting people's time  Will come back? don't know  Probably while  <EOR> Flavors point Curry Leaf  No buffet just la carte entrees apps sides desserts  stuck some fairly safe favorite dishes found them all great quality deep complex flavors  Ambiance going upscale feel but pricing reasonable   SAAG PANEER Pure vegetarian Indian comfort unusually creamy plentiful paneer  Pairs fabulously garlic naan which deliciously fragrant beautifully blistered preferred meal  ROGAN JOSH BF's pick ordered medium spicy flavorful sauce  Lamb large plentiful chunks but could more tender  Both main dishes included rice  BAINGAN BHARTA Side tandoori smoked eggplant mash contender favorite dish great smoky flavor good texture  bargain $6 side  KULFI TRIO couldn't resist dessert house made ice creams fulfilled sweets craving bright mango flavor sweet raspberry nutty pistachio  Couldn't pick favorite all good great creamy consistency    Interior upscale modern but slightly uncomfortable chairs large bar area but no alcohol license? intimate date night dinner spot  Unclear whether plan expand seating into adjacent patio area  Service attentive polite throughout    This those places would come back exact same meal rather trying more menu  classic dishes extremely well portions generous  Great option vegetarian meal  <EOR> Samosa Mimosa combo excellent everything else! Staff very friendly helpful atmosphere decor way above would expect strip mall  back! <EOR> Good Indian food difficult find  often Americanized made spicy rather mix wonderful spices  Well if Curry Leaf good tonight least spot Indian food  I traditional Murgh Makhani  Since am lactose intolerant asked without dairy  waiter returned good news chef would accommodate  Man did he ever  chicken cooked perfectly  red sauce tasted new flavors each second passed  waiter said prepared your mind blown  He kidding  best tasting Indian dish ever eaten  also Jeera Aloo which roasted potatoes made many different spices  less successful although still extremely tasty well worth trying  rice also cooked perfectly  am fan bread comment roti   The atmosphere exuded calm  colors simple but felt home perfect modern Indian restaurant  look forward sampling all Curry Leaf offer  food extraordinary  only knock bit pricey  But if want Indian food its finest mind paying few extra dollars <EOR> Unusual standard items   tried soft shell crab calimari appetizer served Indian  spices   entrees lamb saag shrimp madras   Both very tasty   Garlic naan perfect dipping sauces  <EOR> I now curry leaf 4 separate times  However last night service slow typically favorite dishes flavorless group ask if changed owners  Although servers very friendly repeatedly ask water during first hour half group only managed appetizers we party 4 maybe three other tables   When asked why food taking long told kitchen understaffed lot to go orders  While understand kitchen being understaffed would nice server forewarn food taking longer usual perhaps bring some naan before dishes  Also to go orders shouldn't take priority over customers sitting table restaurant! That being said loved previously  chicken 65 fried shrimp soy garlic appetizers delicious different  tikka masala paneer korma along saag chicken paneer also each delicious  Don't miss lemon rice bullet stuffed naan side lentils normally    really hope next time service lentils which some reason time came flavorless watery improve  If just getting food go  <EOR> Really great food  Definitely better indian places   Highly recommend paneer makhni korma mango lassi <EOR> Interesting dessert personally wasn't big fan flavors but very creamy friend enjoyed it  Other experience wonderful customer service excellent!!!! <EOR> 1st time amazing welcoming professional service! food delicious! chicken korma sister chicken tikka marsala! both ordered naan rice pudding dessert delicious too! new favorite Indian restaurant we definitely back!!!!
