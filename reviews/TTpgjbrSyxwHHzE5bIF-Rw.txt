Again hello Namaste! <EOR> Sadly withdraw previously positive review add recent unpleasant experience   Previously only visited lunch buffet which good reasonably priced    Dinner different story   purchased groupon because always enjoyed place  Except course owner's occasional need karaoke   someone tell she loud Whitney Houston? We attempted two weeks ago but roof flood   spoke owner few minutes   walked 6pm still three foot four foot puddle floor   She rents space but why clean up?    So returned last night try again   food good great rice sparse   when asked left overs asked if could little more rice take home us   additional $2 charge bill rice     This big deal She wrote 18% tip overall bill!  Now would completely understood if she wrote quick note side calculations 15% 18% 20% tip total bill   But write tip table two just because using groupon uncalled for   friend paying difference mad crossed off gave 13% tip     Lastly when owner serving feel less bad tip considering she wages unlike normal wait staff  <EOR> I stand belief hate buffets   BUT if buffet compact meaning small only consisting delicious dishes steps where am sitting slap $10 99 price tag then dance   Namaste's lunch buffet all those things     This small restaurant no matter where sitting close action   naan bread fresh oven worth brief wait comes piping hot delicious   favorite true most Indian restaurants butter chicken   only con no samosas bar but frankly much sushi samosas never good buffet anyway     The little lady running place maybe cutest little thing ever   wanted put pocket take home which made even weirder fact am maybe inch taller haha   nice genuine really tell she takes pride place   She told friend she sings nightly   Wish neighborhood close home could stop dinner sometime check out   But no doubt hitting lunch buffet again soon  <EOR> I only lunch   great lunch buffet  Naan fresh tandori chicken tasty   Service above average attentive   The price reasonable return again lunch   Considering casual ambiance don't think would consider place night Indian food   all means check lunch buffet quick tasty Indian meal  <EOR> Had very high hopes place based rave reviews local food critics   Unfortunately gotta give big thumbs down   Went lunch buffet all speak about   ALL veggie dishes super bland  Garbanzo bean dish best bunch but it  Butter chicken also good   tandori sp  chicken grey completely unappealing looking   Naan fine but very greasy   If spicy food place you   Not sure where all raves come place  dinner menu maybe?  nearby India Oven better lunch buffet   All places  good bad days YMMV cliche goes    <EOR> Before making visit Namaste never tried Indian no particular interest it   Since vacation thought could give try disappointed   would just say food really hit miss because average person lot food generally tastes same addition subtraction meats veggies   food did look bit unappetizing but once started find yourself bloated bliss   **Did runs** <EOR> Was trying Lotus Siam next door but line long instead which assume most biz    Food good but nothing really stood over other Indian joints   boyfriend shared veggie dinner 2 which $40   Service good restroom very clean place nicely decorated  <EOR> Finally lunch buffet disappointed   Great service liked decor most importantly food great   cannot price $9 99!

If know should able write those two words done review  everyone else well guess keep going   With all great reviews Namaste's lunch buffet meaning try quite some time  finally excuse last weekend meetup groups  Situated Commercial Center nicest neighborhood but being right next Lotus Siam certainly associated themselves good neighbor   The interior well decorated quite bit wood trim  buffet area isn't huge but provides good selection  though all Butter Chicken  All need Butter Chicken Naan dipping happy camper  just freakin' delicious   I should mention little tidbit  all enjoying meals conversation when suddenly heard owners sing karaoke  She didn't pick easy songs either  She sang Celine's Heart Whitney's Saving All Love  She actually pretty good  just unexpected   Random karaoke aside $10 AYCE definitely fan place  service friendly food very good  just wish wasn't far house  <EOR> Luncheon buffet sampled pakora Indian pickles raita tamarind mint sauces fresh naan basmati rice chicken lamb curries saag sambar gajar halwa   never dined Indian buffet Las Vegas but did compare well ones frequent Connecticut <EOR> Super horrible Indian restaurant visit Vegas  food pricy  lady over harsh service pathetic  would never recommend place    I wished give them zero but no option  <EOR> Good food nice service  owner serves excellent food then sing resteraunt patrons if lucky  Give you'll enjoy your Indaian food escapade  <EOR> The food excellent probably best indian buffet Las Vegas far  restaurant very new sure if quality degrade over time  seen lot new restaurants made great food when just opened but then food quality down hill time by  hope true restaurant because truely enjoyed lunch  update rating if quality changes  <EOR> Went dinner folks  Service spotty starters awful main course OK  Mom ordered Chardonnay which only descriptive word she could find Ganges    I am told lunch buffet good  would recommend dinner  <EOR> A group before going show  food average but best part evening when waitress put down tray started singing karaoke version Always Love You    key change hilarious she belted she Celine something    Best part next Lotus Suam which far better quality!! <EOR> Indian lunch buffets mind especially hearing Misti Y  praise deliciousness   We pull into Commercial Center 1 45 pm Sunday   park car notice aren't many other cars parked front   Hmmm   As open door shock see!  place packed full Indians!  great sign!   I wasn't sure if wait all people standing around if private party   no greet front Husband search empty table   He finds last table far back checking waiter affirmative wave   tell start first buffet line   Meanwhile ask waiter some utensils   When waiter brings over water he apologizes tour group just arrived which explains all craziness   Nonetheless Indian tour group stops Namaste Commercial Center all places lunch en route still good sign!  My turn buffet line!  Now no expert Indian buffets only couple   But think spread pretty good $8 99!  My favorite Vegetable Korma Vegetable cooked creamy cashew nut gravy finished almond garnished coriander cream  good rice hot naan unleavened white bread provided   also liked sauce Chicken Tikka Masala Tender pieces chicken breast roasted homemade creamy tomato however both found chicken pieces itself dry   also liked Allo Jerra which ultimately potatoes   The Husband loving Saag Paneer Spinach cooked homemade cheese Goat Curry     Other items buffet line Pakara fried veggie Cholle Masala dish chickpeas Cabbage Masala   Something both new Uttapam thick pancake sour like taste topped bit tomato onion   Traditionally made rice fermented which explains tangy taste   Finishing off meal Kheer Traditional Indian rice pudding nuts flavored cardamon rose  point helped myself water pitcher  I wasn't sure if self serve since four water pitchers right next where sitting place crowded   did end refilling glass next 4 5 times though  waiters pretty friendly once crowd settled more started clearing out   quick clear dirty dishes refill water glasses   Namaste also simple but pleasant decor its mango painted walls which sure crave mango lassi   Overall definitely bad choice Indian buffet   stuffed meal didn't eat again until 10 pm night! don't know if always busy Sundays though keep mind! <EOR> The BF watching lot Indian food lately we're kick some  bookmarked long time wanted see fuss about    When walked owner belting some tunes just waited finish drinks in  Filipino disenfranchised subjected lot karaoke  Some people might entertainment but fair warning if you're keen might catch song but whole performance    We did buffet $10 99  also ordered mango lassi good but standard  spread decent  2 chicken dishes 6 veggie dishes salad chutneys raita naan rice spongy little cakes dont know name potato pakora rice pudding oranges sweets    We both thought decent but favorite lunch buffet  standout saag which nice gingery flavor creamy texture  refreshing rice pudding  wish naan wasn't premade fresh made some them really crunchy sitting out  flavors good but don't some items precut bagged vegetable mix  doing supply order while confirmed frozen not  know times aren't best businesses but fresh vegetables reasons why drawn Indian food    I would say 3 5 star buffet round service very warm friendly attentive atmosphere nice  just don't think coming often when both love place know uses better quality ingredients built repoire already  <EOR> Stepped into place pre show dinner because wait Lotus Siam next door definitely going back more!  For 3 appetizers 2 entrees 2 premium beers dessert bill $51   We Vegetable Pakora Onion Bahji Paneer Naan start things off  While waited waiter brought some popadoms house sweet sauce spicy sauce  Nice    For main courses Chicken Vindaloo chicken potatoes stewed curry over rice Chicken Biriani Chicken cashew nuts vegetables basmati rice     I enjoyed everything though probably mistake 2 fried appetizers pakora bhaji great Naan bread soft tasty   The Vindaloo perfect  spicy but overpowering flavors really came through sauce along tender juicy chicken  may spicy some Lotus regulars used but thought spot on   The only complaint gf dish could used more cashews  skeptical when she ordered carrot based dessert but surprised good was  probably healthiest dessert ever eat   The service quick friendly hope place sticks around didn't seem busy 8ish Tuesday   though surprised see Mayor wife walk through door sit adjacent booth midway through meal! <EOR> Its mission find Indian restaurant good food good service good value dinner time  Indian food generally enjoyed self serve lunch buffets  But craving some curry 7pm   I say never received such poor service life  waiter wasn't rude 'per se' but way speaking very condescending  Every question comment he rolled eyes something very short say    CLEANLINESS = NO! person dining dropped napkin floor way bathroom  Indian woman appeared owner manager proceeded pick OFF FLOOR place top table where eat   absolutely disgusted demanded another napkin   The lamb ordered such poor quality  very gamy overcooked dry  ordered plain garlic naan  garlic naan good flavor but both overcooked almost crispy  can't remember 2nd entree but obviously wasn't worth remembering   Good ratings mean nothing if food quality and especially cleanliness isn't there    EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE  <EOR> Really wonderful place amazing food  owner authentic cant help feel care love she puts dishes each customer important her  restaurant very clean cozy too  nice tranquil enviroment las vegas even though crazy strip mall       you 100% transported only reminded head your car   Try Samoas Tikka Marsala chicken soup dont miss garlic nann  No doubt back    Big Thanks Groupon help check out    it homerun!
