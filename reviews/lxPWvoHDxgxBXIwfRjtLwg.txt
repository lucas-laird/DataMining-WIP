It's couple years since last time Zizzy but recall great experience   Drinks fantastic service fast private karaoke room pretty cool   again friend's birthday Saturday we'll see if things better! <EOR> One favs spot chill whenever Vegas  away main but yet close enough   price fair cheap side decent services  <EOR> HH awesome! if its already playing ask they'll play K pop    I'm korean sushi blah  ddukbokki good decent expensive tho! $13 should cost no more $8 9  love skewers   there rice bowls meat portions super sized if you're looking quantity isn't place   nice chill not crowded place come relax rough day work  it's bar though if someone comes wants smoke HH prices really can't soju very tasty! <EOR> Been coming long time! Great spot relax few Korean brew soju! Yes small spot bar small but  gives place character  <EOR> This rating only Karaoke room   Karaoke system outdated don't know where begin  Also very limited options adjust system  <EOR> The worst place!!!!!  My family Vegas june 2012 weekend came night thought it'd nice fix sushi  Really couldn't more wrong     Service horrible guys leading place pay more attention friends paying customers  Also horrible taking orders missed 3+ orders group 10  didn't even order all! thing myself ordered Avocado lover roll even roll! basically big chunk avocado! $13 definitely worth it  order didn't even come until much later guy taking orders said he didn't when first freaking thing wanted first place! Shouldn't even ordered all     This place overpriced unprofessional  all hated it  <EOR> What more exciting your first Korean karaoke bar experience?  NOTHING!  Last night MASSIVE 12+ group friends headed Zizzy's also called Z2 few hours pool drinks PT's   located right beside Chinatown Mall but hard spot because set back road strip mall look it!  U turn in     Parking alright 9pmish Friday night but surrounded several Korean Chinese bbq joints may more issue during dinner hours     When first walked very impressed decor feel place   windows doors all tinted very dark even all lights around nice dim   few tables bar front those just come dine   Overall very posh tasteful     Our sever led back largest room room 2 great huge crowds! very dark room large bench sofa ran three walls room two large tables   fourth wall huge entertainment center large flat screen middle song number puncher if can't find remote   it really dark! smaller screens   all snuggled soju warm sake started flowing server kept coming!  also order food brought your room   order shrimp tempura give heaping pile six seven large shrimp instead three usually see tempura appetizer   bite wasn't bland dry some places   Veerry tasty if shrimp tempura fan   The majority karaoke selection Vietnamese Korean but did good collection standard karaoke songs Westerners me   Hit Baby Dirrty P I M P Eternal Flame course Survive just few repertoire night!  provide two microphones but everyone yelling loud thanks Mr  Soju didn't need more anyway   The room runs around 25 30 bucks hour   soju comes around 13 bucks bottle   Dunno much sake tempura but totaled around 25 30 bucks person worth every penny   made new friends tried new things GREAT pictures definitely tagging along next outing Zizzy's! <EOR> This place great but also best   It's nice serve food but very pricey   Nothing menu Wow   and selection music okay   different folders music separate singing rooms   typical asian karoke place    I soju though   Other eh   okay  <EOR> With Lindsey H  @ Zizzy's  Great evening drinks food then damn bill  Uhh why hell $40 02 bill crossed written tune $20 01!!! WTH? mean don't Happy Hour 6pm 9pm anymore?? Uhh why come here! yes should say spots frequent until received bills evening  great place Happy Hour  mean 6pm 9pm? Where else find Vegas? say something because clearly pissed  gents very nice yes but damn give heads up  ordered OVER $200  food drinks! bartenders servers great service way said revamping place going bring happy hour back regular time then late nite happy hour  Ok cool but sure hell back until then  <EOR> I cant begin comprehend such small  establishment only few empty  tables two three occupied tables slow friday night two employees still give such poor customer service  party made numerous  attempts server's attention point where all call wave hands only ignored  Then odacity drink friends phones  experience only justifies why place second choice  <EOR> Justin awesome! Very attentive professional  He right staff happy hour phenomenal  first time definitely come back  Try soju cocktails die for  <EOR> Whenever come Vegas 4 5 times year still need karaoke fix   don't paying ten bucks song those karaoke clubs strip   drive chinatown spend three hours Zizzy   price decent fifteen dollars hour friend clean laid back   When walk looks only bar but karaoke rooms down hallway   ordered soju bar but  habit brought large cup soda pop laced vodka   usually end throwing friend because singing sucks  know thinking rude am throwing vodka friend   But tell could worse vodka no smell   if threw cheap wine him?  Then he would walk around rest night smelling homeless wino can't sing! If karaoke need away strip awhile then check place out  don't take Discover card  <EOR> I little bar  modern cozy same time  several rooms karaoke depending size your group  great place hang if want little low key  drinking Hite beer! <EOR> Well thank other reviewers some hearty laughs! Yes place its quirks but overall friends awesome time full laughter sick cat type singing    The place pretty cut dry  karaoke rooms bar restrooms  rest you! song choices overall pretty decent few couldn't believe didn't offer  videos though lots people mention absolutely no bearing song you're singing incredibly entertaining! mean stars numerous videos named Banana Girl   how love that??!! needs American videos?  My only semi complaint weren't made aware button waiter drinks every time  end world cause some fresh air but minus star customer service  drinks aren't bargain basement but they're strong cares  few margaritas some Sapporo you're all set!   Overall place good time  Even if your friends insist don't sing karaoke will  contagious!! <EOR> Lemme just preface saying KARAOKE = LOVE!!  Came Wednesday night $15 hour  SCORE!!! didn't ask drink minimum which great! Though bit disappointed wasn't broader non alcoholic drink menu  know know   how does sing karaoke without singing? Trust done!!  The song selections while fairly to date don't original music videos but rather Korean actors actresses trying dance walk sing insert verb choice song  Still fabulous time all would back heartbeat if ever town!!  It located next Tea Station Chinatown busy street easy locate only $8 incl  tip cab ride Palazzo  Oh employees kind attentive! never hurts!! <EOR> Been coming years!!! Love place staff     Nothing wrong when your friends privacy singing all your heart out  always come back  <EOR> Probably worst Karaoke places to  karaoke nut place lacking few reasons  bar doesn't karaoke purchase room  rooms extremely stuffy  song choices severely lacking  books mostly Japanese So Americana friendly Karaoke machine broken couldn't line songs ahead time  enter them soon someone's song done  addition And just being nitpicky Karaoke girl videos don't match you're singing  just long string random videos aren't connected any song  particular  friend singing Virgin video child playing violin while old man looks on  **Awkward** LOL only redeeming thing place food  <EOR> We Vegas weekend friend's bachelorette party stopped Saturday before out  happened happy hour could happier experience   We 3 bottles Nigori sake hour karaoke $15  shit not  $15!!! bride also free shot patron bar  staff really nice  don't huge selection songs but service positive experience kind price place amazing  <EOR> SO LONG HAPPY HOUR! friends frequenting hidden gem years solely because kick ass happy hour  show work eat drink happy     Until bills come! Wow no more happy hour? No warning? no significant menu change? cool all! seriously left feeling completely blindsided   Still hungry   buzzed   But definitely broke  When questioned staff super nice but still should notified  find new happy hour spot doesn't smell bleach busted toilet non air conditioned karaoke rooms  Boy bye! <EOR> Somehow all decided come karaoke! second time set foot spot    Walking certain scent invades nose toilet bowl  cool  walked back karaoke room  then wait twenty minutes microphones  Why? Because charge! Shouldnt karaoke place supplies ready patrons use??!! waited all sang bit then microphones died mid song! WOW!!! would think shit would work venue since paying karaoke room     We also ordered french fries apparently seven orders front ours but still took thirty minutes  little long drop some fries some hot oil  Anyway staff nice enough but karaoke could LOT better experience  <EOR> Fun little karaoke bar heart Chinatown spring mountain  Several rooms all different sizes fit your singing entourage  Half full bar enough sing few classics <EOR> Don't wrong  happy hour awesome! service    much    I evening around 8pm which usually happy hour anymore but Zizzy's happy hour 5 9pm  awesome people weird shift hours!
