Well took good 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged party  No hellos no nothing Employees assisted tables front while just stood waiting seated  Another group came immediately greeted seated  Hello? Eventually asked if going seated anytime soon employee said he thought waiting booth     sure excuses being ignored     Eventually seated orders taken food good  But then server forgot being additional requested utensils refills corn tea  duration taken check table clear being bill less appreciated    I would recommend place due lack attention customer service provided  plenty other Korean restaurants I'd rather give business to  <EOR> I am torn place  really visit yet none food particularly did much me  quality grub seemed very close being great but just fell short  plan going back think possibly just ordered wrong items  easy find different dishes menu extensive  Other food decor modern yet comfortable  service attentive  the best part draft beers cheap! <EOR> Good food service atmosphere!!! Comparable strip low local price <EOR> Ok really writing review because only food great  the service great staff nice also definitely tripped fell down steps higher tables  servers helped embarrassed look back because just wanted keep walking friends flushed cheeks  embarrassed self put rush just heck room  Thanks helping kind sir!!!!! <EOR> Endearing   The owners did great job mixing old traditional modern   The place very inviting wooden benches traditional Korean silver ware that means clay dishes round tin cans drink of    The food array all popular Korean dishes  comes moderate proportions tasting everything  if share is   Don't expect best Korean food you've ever had  experience  perfect place grab bite eat drinks friends  <EOR> If could give place 0 stars would  Horrible management  basically argue server re make dish tasted funky  manager wasn't present restaurant she call manager approval see if dish taken off remade  manager said no server told nothing done since no problem dish   just way there    complained again     She called manager second time when she came back she took dish finally re made    If any other restaurant if chef heavy hand salt re make dish you're able enjoy it  If food overcooked properly    But apparently restaurant only way accept re making food take off check ONLY if piece hair any human particles it   <EOR> We love some Korean food tried place last night!!

Especially if love korean food place go! usually order kimchi tofu soup kalbi short ribs pork belly salad bit pricey but most authentic korean restaurants bit expensive just think place worth money because food delicious! <EOR> So review based experience  twice  first time good time  Staff friendly  enjoyed Kalbi Korean chicken wings  Kimchi fried rice egg very good also  hoping jia jiang noodles but done but okay  barley drink good too  second time same thing food good but service point time  Getting order food ready prompt but felt host did check if needed anything  mom eating Kalbi chicken wings which very saucy needed more napkins mom wanted fork but every time she tried ask lady host would walk passed us  busser working next table mom asked fork he attitude job host us  Which may true but he handling utensils  When ready once original host stopped mom wanted box she asked same busser present again table he turns around he's shaking head pointing Mom other co worker  felt bit angry because he's giving mom little snobby attitude small three things she requested  Fork napkins box  don't care if host doesn't stop constantly but least check up  But no ask other guy  <EOR> Beef short ribs bomb  mozzarella chicken mixed bin bap together amazingly left overs  <EOR> I dined other day unique experience  restaurant outside nothing decor inside  decor itself surprised because very oriental theme setting  very nice change modern vegas setting theme restaurants  Soyo Korean Barstaurant's decor reminds theme restaurants China  high wall booths which created sense intimacy but could still people sitting behind talking  wall decor cups used drink caught attention made them stick out    They served barley tea instead water thin tin bowls cups  great try but requested water shortly after  didn't tea am heavy tea drinker  ordered Kalbi plate well Spicy Beef Tofu Soup  food came quickly ordered  Spicy Beef Tofu Soup great flavor Kalbi cooked well done asked  overall first time experience great   We ordered Yogurt Cocktail Soju  little stronger before but good  only $12 large size Soju  also noticed beers only $3 50 pint $13 pitcher which thought great price!  The only aspect holding back rating place 5 star language barrier waiter  waiter spoke enough english take order but explain clearly some items menu questions about  hard understand he saying even though he trying pronounce words slower  Communication little difficult through time dining here  <EOR> Spicy barbecue pork good served hot sizzling platter  many side dishes served meal only thing worthy kim chi  other plates okay  Fair prices service good  <EOR> Soyo become places whenever town climb Red Rocks   Good Korean comfort food reasonable prices  can't remember everything ordered but pork belly good always fun playing titantic w soju beer  lol  Make reservation very big gets crowded  <EOR> Its worst place  But very popular some reason  bulgogi great  service whatever  But normal if u kno Korean people  place u come definetly  Open until last customer leaves too <EOR> This place gets busy times servers could little friendlier but food great prices reasonable well  <EOR> Pretty sure we're going anymore   A group friends eat work while all talking friend started screaming    We no idea going until saw cockroach crawling table!   All servers kept saying sorry sorry  No manager came talk all servers just kept doing doing  even presented bill whole situation without even thought  bit unfortunate because place good thus far but now we're questioning cleanliness  <EOR> I two separate occasions time small group time group 10+ people  only party table prepare that  When came big group shared family style overall food pretty good  When came smaller group ox bone soup flat dumplings  first time trying type soup however fan it  tasted very bland only 2 slices beef small portion noodles  flat dumplings very crispy tasty but bit hard eat everything falls taking few bites  recommendation stick items stronger flavors menu  <EOR> Maybe because dipped nearly 20 degrees last week Vegas but seriously think brrrrrr cold!!  When cold think any food  warm cozy ramen chicken noodle soups jigae beef stews pho cinnamon rolls    Soyo sure fits right into warm cozy because offer all kinds Korean comfort food     We enjoyed    1   starchy potato pancakes Might say even more enjoyable kimchi pancakes? 2   seafood soondubu combination tangy spicy warm your belly goodness! 3   chicken wings special sauce some mutant wings!  gi normous!  delicious  4   dolsot bi bim bap totally hit spot windy days past weekend   hot   spicy hot but HOT stone pot!  love dish always presented hot stone pot but soyo really does right   mix rice veggies beef comes seriously sizzling when toss sauce really dig scrape now crispy rice membrane bottom   those crispy rice lovers certainly bad thing!  chewy crispy tasty rice!

I must admit did experiment menu much hoping because starving  opted safe choices fried wings special sauce sauce heavy particularly unique but enjoyable spicy pork ribs they actually spicy which welcome surprise korean bbq beef pretty difficult mess dish but meat portion generous very little fat   entree came side steamed rice several sides dishes  enjoy kimchi very good but am used bit more spice   Everything very tasty prices more reasonable amount food  get  Next time would explore menu bit more pick foods unfamiliar me  <EOR> Ahh yes place keeps soul young   time music few decibels loud taste but others seem more energy it   spite its young hip eclectic vibe service remains overly attentive   sometimes having 2 3 people ask if Everything OK? big wad kimchi your mouth course give nod satisfied smile   We ordered different items first visit   Except husband couldn't resist getting dumplings AGAIN!  bargain because six huge ones $5 bucks so  good value rest stuff    The Bo Ssam new favorite    perfect low carb meal   Radish kimchi braised maybe steamed whole napa cabbage leaves steamed pork belly  big enough 3 appetizer hearty enough dinner little over delicious lunch next day   husband ordered ramen which only $5 large enough fill average size belly its own   if noodles your thing   However while broth may kimchi ish flavor noodles just Nissin packets Sora Monta Ramen    Probably solid well prepared tasty meal could little $10 here   They really special thing going worth drive  <EOR> Awesome decor great music hipster scene recommend place chill drink  Besides food greasy server couldn't hear very well probably because music nor could hear since he wasn't yelling over music  food over priced quality left overs stayed table don't bother taking home am sure wont taste any better next day  <EOR> I've least dozen times says lot because can't find Korean food Vegas  Soyo comes closest being anything worth going back to  Service always just okay except time when waitress put check book top box which open food it  Very careless her  Another time brought wrong order would then bring right but would need wait 15 min more food already table 3 4 way done eating point  apology guy brought food but guy took order which would nice  Everybody else decent though  Banchan just ok really great but barley tea which complimentary  side note although regulars only recognize 1 2 waiters rest don't making wonder if high turnaround  waiters don't seem very good care much hence 3 stars    Items like LA Gaal Bi Jap Chae Korean pancake seafood Bulgogi Grilled pork belly Marbled beef salad  Items don't like Fried chicken wings garlic very sticky messy breading hard thick taste   Soon Doo Boo used good don't anymore broth become thin watery   The only downfall usually busy often times wait   Cheesy corn  I would try spicy items but hubby doesn't spicy     really jealous people order red looking soups burner brought table  wouldn't know order think need Korean expert me  <EOR> Food great!!!

SERIOUS?!? Customer service!!!   The food isn't horrible but incredibly insulting experience am pretty sure drive extra 10 min another Korean spot  <EOR> The atmosphere Soyo very upbeat   tried many items menu but only favourite Aal Baap   Although menu seems offer tons things most dishes amazing   bibimbap soon tofu also good   The K Pop music played quite loudly restaurant itself very loud   If seeking more quiet atmosphere request booth because booths partly closed off   often crowded night especially Saturdays   some people staff quite courteous helpful but few workers inefficient somewhat rude   food Soyo pretty good but atmosphere loud some staff's behaviour upsetting  <EOR> Looking late night place eat late night being 10pm Summerlin standards drove here   kind hard see blazing lights Oyshi Sushi but just off left Oyshi   also coincided Chris M 's UYE which perfect   Hite beer tap and bottle    Morimoto Soba Ale tap   Soju  Tiny little video game machines   would enough me   But food great too! party four shared bunch different dishes including spicy chicken mozzarella spicy pork belly bean sprouts mandu dumplings kimchi tofu soup seafood scallion pancake   Plus few other dishes did try so much food all traditional Korean sides  food portions generally huge plan accordingly   Also don't afraid mix match   Chris discovered sauce spicy chicken great dumplings   knew?  The complimentary iced barley tea delicious tin bowl service   But pretty sure caffeinated only bit   The spicy pork belly bean sprouts came own portable stove which pretty large unwieldy   ate pretty fast didn't turn were supposed to? wasn't quite sure purpose took valuable space already crowded table    At end your meal its probably best just approach servers ask check   Thankfully Chris knew would sitting much longer wondering up   bill  very reasonable all food alcohol husband had   Didn't even $75 mark could spin wheel  Definitely fan definitely back  <EOR> Favorite dishes dumplings marbled beef salad katsu  Every dish fabulous  Service great  Quick  Consistent  Occasionally Korean pop music bit much    But food worth it  <EOR> Whenever craving Korean food always know soyo's SOLID!

I don't know if would come back place but if probably just order meat based dishes see lol  atmosphere pretty cool kpop music dim light setting  kind reminds hip cafe  workers pretty nice attentive but kind hard understand some them when asking questions menu since spoke limited English  Towards end meal think workers forgot when tried pay bill  ended sitting down 20 minutes until decided just walk register pay there    Overall wouldn't recommend checking place if looking some good Korean food  food just mediocre other restaurants same plaza may better things offer  <EOR> This restaurant best places affordable yummy Korean food great service  always busy when come but servers top game  time when server forgot dessert orders but he extremely apologetic made making extra large portion  No complaints there!   I ordered Bi Bim Bap last time here  still sizzling when arrived its hot stone pot tasted great save maybe little lack salt could easily fixed  portion sizes just perfect presentation food Soyo deserves A+  orders come inclusive side dishes which great addition main course  Also sure check dessert when chance  parfait ordered incredible fruits all fresh just right amount whip cream ice cream everything better course    The restaurant plays Korean pop music servers mostly young adults arcade game machines walls decorated posters pictures chalkboards making trendy atmosphere worth coming back to    I absolutely love variety seating options here  both covered outdoor indoor seating  Customers choice sit elevated booths bar regular tables big party booth overlooks entire place  fancy!  I definitely recommend place anyone into good Korean food attentive service  hey open until late night! <EOR> After Earl volunteered Opportunity Village decided head over Soyo late dinner since Earl never tried before   When arrived seated ourselves immediately   10 minutes given tea menu   two minutes perusing menu server came see if ready order   asked more time since Earl hasn't even read through first page     Finally ready order   following Korean blood Sausage Server asked know blood sausage?

See next time Soyo! <EOR> We're always lookout dining places haven't tried before planned destination dinner failed crowded decided try next door Soyo Korean Barstaurant  place very clean inviting new patrons small intimate 'nooks' would preferred seated but nevertheless entire open dining area itself wasn't bad either  Having no idea menu asked friendly server she recommends instead guessing ourselves  new Korean Food dining but Soyo offers different take traditional Korean BBQ making things whimsical modern right down way food drinks presented rustic tin canisters lieu drinking glasses tea cup example   dinner party three ordered recommended Chicken Wings Garlic Sauce Hot Spicy Vegetables Shredded Beef Soup Bibimbap  chicken wings stood most chicken cooked perfectly tender juicy inside crunchy outside enhanced savory garlic honey glaze  oh yeah grab lot napkins round folks because things going real messy in good way ! hot tender beef soup colorful bibimbap more traditional taste presentation  also good thing  look forward coming back sample more dishes Soyo's menu we're glad discovered another good eats place  <EOR> You know always feel bad when reviews differ much yelp friends  However just opinion    I don't think Soyo all that   came New Year's UFC fight around 10pm? Inside place looked cool old school tv benches lil uncomfortable but provide pillows sit your bum on   We served doggy dishes tea right away but took another 20 25 minutes server come back even take order  place wasn't packed seemed everyone just hanging out  Well when finally order server told didn't oxtail noodle soup    so ordered short rib soup   food came probably 10 15 minutes later which average think  soup good  meat tender most part but no noodles  really wanted something noodles server said replaced oxtail noodle soup  rest friends enjoyed meal most part   Maybe just wrong time didn't order right thing but impressed   Service really terrible think ruined whole Soyo experience me  huge sucker service when no service lack service become mad woman  When check came server given wrong one  she gave amount WAY cheaper discount 10 15% luckily said wrong check  She printed right check no discount  wonder gets such awesome discount  any case 6 bill came around 85 something bucks plus tip   which right 5 entrees 3 soju bombs  Overall think rather drive lil more some Korean BBQ  <EOR> LOVE!  Finally decided try place getting over some intimidation since only korean dining experience AYCE KBBQ lol   AMBIANCE loved hip laid back vibe Barstaurant presented definitely why coming back such cute place fun booths plus anywhere serves awesome korean food korean version officially missing playing background     Count in!!!  SERVICE friend total noobs but servers more helpful friendly just little awkward first because once sat down gave small pitcher barley tea two cup bowl looking things no explanation they serve over water btw weren't sure whether drink bowls if scraps lol   FOOD much great options Galbi stews ramen tried KOONG NAA MOOL GYUP SAAL seems popular choice delish! pork belly squid  sweet chili issh broth bring portable stove burner cook all way stay warm definitely adding dining experience plus very flavorful! comes rice typical banchan sides  also tried flat dumplings which people rave but okay maybe expecting world but it'll BIG PLUS SOJU!! lychee soju bomb!

But wrong was    This place felt stumbling into weird Burning Man camp edge playa 4am  bright lights crazy music tons people stuffing delicious food into faces sort post colonial bacchanal    all going down waaaaaaaay edge civilization!  Three shared seafood pancake bibimbap bowl some short ribs   plus lychee cocktail  Everything great plenty everyone total tab $54  Nice!

I ordered Kimchi Fried Rice ok   think ichiza's better because actually comes kimchi   think rice little sticky little spicy   egg refreshing though but overall thought OK   Corn Mozerella Cheese good   thought sauce mixed cheese while being served hot pot pretty genius   did wish serving little bigger since paying $5 00 it     Garlic Squid dish very good although more garlic did squid   kind felt jipped little price expecting little more just garlic   Green Mussel Soup pretty good   portions good flavor soup ok   nothing brag about   did add lot mussels not     I thought place OK spot   thought Korean tapas genius but pretty greedy portions  Maybe something could improve? Even veggies serve side items small   looked someone took scoop just served it   might return cause service good but don't know prices   paid almost $40 just those dishes alone   felt could've gotten more should  <EOR> Whenever town Soyo great choice some comfort food   Great environment comfy  Music selection fitting according taste which Korean music    The food good  Stuff visits army stew budajigae korean fried chicken cold noodles Kimchi fried rice spicy rice cake tofu soup  Probably other food which forgotten    For a barstaurant restaurant bar Korean food great    Everything tasty filling  need try out    I wish California  <EOR> Delicious food great fried rice stone pot  great place  Music slightly loud but bearable  <EOR> Solid choice Korean food city very few good Korean options  seafood tofu soup soondubu awesome $9 comes banchan bowl rice  mom ordered hot stone bibimbap gave thumbs up  also ordered deep fried rice cakes skewers which CRISPY DELICIOUS  Highly recommend $2 so   Service super fast came off hour no wait  Parking plentiful  <EOR> Really really good place  Reminds childhood!  bool dak which fish stick soup radish pineapple soju  Great combination friends! friend japchae glass noodle dish paired bool dak which chicken cheese  All all staff attentive needs even when late night we came 2pm still packed!

Interesting play words but fitting quite interesting place    I'll start off describing design atmosphere new hip Korean joint  Soyo located same plaza well reviewed Oyshi Sushi  fact two places under same management having acquainted manager owners  walk inside dimly light place you'll find main section middle booth like seating arrangements  each adjacent side additional booths elevated platforms which bit more private sectioned off  Stacks manga cute ceramics arcade game machines other random pieces rustic Korean decorations adorn place all works together 'cute' way  Save upbeat bubbly techno heavy K Pop music always seem play I'm Korean myself just personal preference place often lively full people enjoying themselves    Now important stuff  menu Soyo contains your usual Korean items such soups casseroles noodle meat entrees but don't crazy offering specific variations each whole Korean BBQ table grill experience  Instead real winner crowd pleaser seems offerings street foods   Soyo offers some items haven't able find any other Korean kitchen outside own mom's  Real standouts the Buu Deh Jii Kae Giant spicy casserole unlikely combination Spam rice cake onions green onions ramen noodles brought cooked table    Spicy Pork Belly Casserole Sliced pork belly bean sprouts other veggies cooked similar fashion mention above    Dduk Bbokki spicy rice cake ramen noodles  Chicken Wings Korean style drummettes served plain slathered sweet spicy sesame seed topped sauce  Served pickled Daikon cubes    I could name few more but having hard time remembering them correctly because keep salivating over Spamcakemen goodness    Obviously aforementioned dishes really truly meant enjoyed slowly some friends course alcohol  Aside usual Hite OB light beer plain soju Soyo offers rice wine top quality spirits cocktails respectable beer selection those beer connoisseurs  Which warrants bonus points pleasing beer snob me    All all Soyo you'll expecting if you're searching finest Korean cuisine looking fill barbecued Kalbi Pork Belly  Instead great place hangout friends mellow night over some good Korean soul food liquor  Don't shy away worth checking least once    Plus want try placed called Barstaurant? <EOR> My fave Korean bar Cali Vegas!! Very clean but still retains modern grungy Korean Bar feel   food very decently priced especially since everything darn yummy!! Only weird thing literally checked EVERY employee manager cleaning people   meaning asked if needed anything every 5 minutes people watched dishes hawk took away once empty which made feel eat faster could stop looking take away  Never really thought would issue but bit awkward while    The food all delicious  its rare find place decent gochujang most Cali watered down way sugary  but it! fried rice cake yum galbijjim  honest better cheese corn but complaining! cold noodle nangmyun also favorite ours   soondae only so so but once again good enough happy whatevs!  We DEFINITELY coming back next trip Vegas   I'll missing til then! <EOR> Accidentally brought dad here    should known younger crowd name Barstaurant but whoops bad   The vibes super fun! Perfect place come hang group friends eat drink  kimchee pancake share definitely recommend really enjoyed seafood tofu soup   They blasting trance music when came eat 3 sure certain expectation  little cubbies tables group dynamic more fun  very small bar sit maybe 4 seats? but food's good shouldn't pass up   So many more new restaurants east side! late hours if still lived Vegas would add place rotation  <EOR> We just tried kyochon chicken LA left craving more Vegas unfortunately decided look place offered Korean chicken wings  decided Soyo reading reviews seeing 4 stars  Overall experience itself horrible but food par palate  ordered 2 kinds chicken wings garlic special one  chicken slight stenchy taste chicken gives off if properly handled my nose super sensitive taste ok nothing really rave about  Also FYI side orders included when order only tapas appetizers re chicken wings but if must them $3 more  then decided order favorite bibimbap unlike many though prefer mine cold stone pot which requested them do  bibimbap disappointment well mean never would've thunk put lettuce dish? meat ground meat handful nori which made dish smell fishy doused hot sauce still lacked flavor  Unappetizing  Well least $3 side dishes which spent $10 the cost bibimbap but alas blah    kimchi unsavory only thing glass noodles mayo broccoli rest did even bother trying some black beans radish dish  only salvation meal free iced barley tea drink pickled radish came wings   Now maybe really fair judge place based just three dishes but if ask RECOMMEND PLACE? would say NO  COME BACK? NO well     Unless somebody else drags pays it  But aside food though   I really did love ambiance even outdoor patio setting really reminded Korean drama series mean probably great place hang wasted maybe then can't really tell bad food is  <EOR> Amazing place speak Korean great miss korea much   dessert good ice cream parfait delicious  they open late til 3 4 am good day work night   Location very nice area   I'm definitely going again   <EOR> I hearing place ages never gotten around going until last weekend  came two girl friends decided share several dishes between three us    We ordered seafood stew spicy chicken wings appetizer order mackeral  All food incredibly flavorful amount food price fantastic  stuffed end meal very content  staff pretty friendly gave great suggestions order help round meal  didn't try any drinks occasion but hear fantastic  look forward trying them again next trip    I enjoyed seating quite bit well  booths very closed off private which creates very good environment conversing your dining companions    I'll definitely back  <EOR> Lychee soju gets 5 stars but really should kept chilled! lot if asian kids come extremely loud  lot spicy sou dishes  ordered bunch things ok  garlic chix wings good  katsu overcooked hard chew  chew while before safe swallow  eggs spam dish would great dish breakfast  Service started off slow cold but few other servers redeemed server points  place small even patio area  sure if place worth long drive north las vegas  <EOR> The food great  Ive 4 times can't complain anything except dessert  given excuse left right being able fish dessert  given it  Only food  <EOR> The bi bim bap well seasoned  good  service awesome  waiters waitresses very attentive always came check see if tea filled    Overall experience great great dinner plus red bean shaved ice hit spot <EOR>
