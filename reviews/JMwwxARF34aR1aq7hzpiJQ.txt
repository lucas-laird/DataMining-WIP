Stopped pick dinner  Wait time 15 20 min but definitely worth wait  Ordered couple pupusas platanos fritos made fresh which why small wait time  would recommend calling ahead if planning pick order  staff very friendly restaurant itself really clean  Ended being great dinner option paid less then 15 dollars 2 people! Very affordable every penny  <EOR> Food extremely terrible service slow    When server finally attended table she extremely rude    Best thing menu French fries  <EOR> TERRIBLE SERVICE  lady works Cheyenne location extremely rude  asked check some boxes she never returned table started doing other things  list all things wrong but all know returning  <EOR> So eating restaurants since open first location but location Cheyenne  Service sucks    came dine inn waiting hour   and asked food response going take more time because working take orders first   wtf    kids walked hungry  Never ever going back    <EOR> Did finally find restaurant REAL FLAN???

When told lady still raw she gave snotty look said she would try cooking again declined offer ordered chicken tamale instead wasn't best but actually eatable   Don't here! Horrible food rude staff! <EOR> As soon entered knew should taken into account reviews talking service  even hello sit anywhere nothing  even hello  ordered food lady never came back check us  coming back place ever again  <EOR> Service okay girl nice  Food okay 3 different pupusas The inside decor could use some updating  Overall its okay here  <EOR> Every time pupuseria feel rock stomach hours afterward   because gorge myself delicious cheese pouches should too   Hot tips zucchini herb you combine pupusa fillings   Bring friends speak Spanish if possible but offended when ask your friends La Americana wants  Just embrace it  Servers might try talk things think can't handle El Salvadoran horchata nuttier coarser its Mexican counterpart   Know thyself    Great place pick take dinner group family  <EOR> I gave north las vegas 4 star gave Henderson 5 star   Giving 2 because hardcore racially profiled wait staff  I took hispanic dude there   He never pupusas   taught order what's good not   Then damn waitress kept talking asking questions ignores most time   When she does acknowledge existance could tell she didn't speak English therefore comfortable talking asking questions   mean    does Asian girl know crap Hispanic foods right? <EOR> My favorite place freshly made order pupusas!
