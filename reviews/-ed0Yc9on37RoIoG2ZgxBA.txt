Also awesome noodles just that awesome  Definitely recommend place  <EOR> Food salty service strong  quality does quite reach price point  Pad kee mao good  Short rib fried rice definitely better  Worth trying if visit place   The bill wasn't expensive but probably better choices area  honestly don't know why wait restaurant 45 mins hour  Maybe try calling reserve if plan togo here   We lucky just party two didn't wait  let sit side bar  <EOR> Le Thai pretty decent don't wrong  live near Fremont convenient place grab some decent Thai food  Typically I'd stop once week grab some curry which pretty mild   place bit crowded during peak hours but usually isn't bad    However lately really busy ordering pick  normal thing Thai place  absolutely poor service aspect completely lost long time frequent customer  first time hold 20 whole minutes someone picking occassionally asking needed then telling them carry they'd say moment while try grab someone  Now busy can't always take order right away but 20 whole minutes?  Thankfully manager gave free meal but rather just paid if could order    The second time same thing happens  fifteen minutes hold just hang up  Whatever time peak hours just down street Lotus Siam never problem with   Finally try order third time another day  same treatment  But wasn't during any crazy peak hours don't much excuse  Fifteen minutes hold listening most annoying hold music ever 8bit high pitched melodies just hung again   There food decent considering location  However just principle never returning  amount time wait hold them amount time takes round trip pick elsewhere  <EOR> I don't know why restaurant first rank here  Even though food good service terrible  server order wrong every time  Also whenever call server she seems tired that  totally unsatisfied restaurant!  Reply your comment I visited 12 21 17 12 pm   First ordered soup noodle  However wrong roll noodles because server didn't explain types noodles have  she suggested order additional noodle us  moment just accepted suggestion patience although thats mistake   Second ordered only noodle additional noodle  But she charged two noodles  Though she cancelled order finally feel treated black consumer   Third requested free drink offer yelp  moment didn't know + offer  She just brought two cups tea without any explanation  just paid because didnt pay attention see description offer   Forth woman seems supervisor  Whenever asked something she said just ask server! Actually thats just general question use offer  She just walking around tables server  If would deliver customers messages server least   I've never experienced such terrible service USA  don't know why other peoples satisfied your restaurant  honest feel kind racial discrimination because offered terrible service us   This first review yelp  don't any service guys never suggest restaurant friends  <EOR> I came Vegas  first research place eat!  On searches Le Thai came decided try it  OMG! glad did   phenomenal!

builds rapport among customers social media savvy but  very small set clientele enough keep your restaurant going   Again food good but always slow come out  server keeps your drinks filled but slow take empty dishes away bring your check  Which probably adds ridiculous wait times  food little pricy but think portions very generous  Enough two meals   I Le Thai lot I work Downtown 1 2 times month always send town guests but experience last night incredibly annoying  included manager telling server serve table friends before even though seated probably 10 20 minutes before them   response questioning why server didn't tell free tea sake when waited more hour seated outside rude obnoxious    I probably take little Le Thai break  did when food disgusting improved  Hopefully same happen service management  <EOR> Where start   Well start rude hostess   still can't believe attitude   came told wait would 15 minutes   20 minutes checked back see much longer told she didn't know   Ok fair enough just hungry     Once seated 25 minute wait table right top tables next us   If want sit inside warned very small space    waiter came take order placed appetizer order right away drinks then waiter disappeared 20 minutes avoiding eye contact us   hold hostess said waiter   LOL  Just wow still can't believe terrible hostess behaved     We appetizers left   returning  <EOR> Le Thai surprisingly delicious  pretty small location bar inside but crank delicious Thai food  ordered Short Rib Fried Rice which advertised house specialty  meat some softest most flavorful meat provide plenty meat per plate  boyfriend ordered Awesome Noodles extra spicy delivered extra spicy    Overall I'd recommend place anyone looking some delicious Thai food Vegas area  <EOR> Have several times never bad meal  Tom Kah soup rocks  papaya salad solid serve heat side if requested like  Chicken Satay fantastic well   add several other good Thai places Vegas ranks any them  $50 range 2 people 2 entrees 2 appetizers well worth it <EOR> Hate wait parking      but loooove ground pork pad Thai!  worth wait <EOR> I've hearing all kinds good things Le Thai but never neighborhood around dinner time   Last night downtown happy hour when tummy rumbles set in   knew time Le Thai excited   We seated outdoor section tiny restaurant   pretty hot even 8pm but water misters going cool things off   When combine mist warm air almost gives feeling being southeast asia   atmosphere definitely steps away casinos neon  good thing   For appetizer Thai go to chicken satay   peanut sauce delicious although tad bland   chicken perfect   pieces much larger most other satay seen   chicken also perfectly tender juicy   only dream being able cook chicken perfectly   My entree Pad Kee Mow   ordered chicken medium spice   DC ordered Pad See Eew chicken medium spice   Both dishes fantastic among best Thai food had   many others noted however food damn spicy   generally high tolerance spice medium just little much   Heat aside food incredible   want try everything else menu   Our service lazy but bad way   Maybe relaxed better word   Servers friendly took orders iPhone   Neat little touch   music mix between West Elm dance club very good vibe relaxed atmosphere   We'll definitely returning Le Thai try rest menu only time slightly milder spice profile   <EOR> If you're looking Thai restaurant downtown could your spot  panang curry delicious!! <EOR> I used come really often  last few times eaten gotten take place really declined  time vegetable curry dish literally only carrots onion  husband's noodle dish burned black  Learn cook  your act together  <EOR> If look closely into bell pepper! hair! told waiter could see root hair clearly  He comes back tells cook stated LIME HAIR! world  sorry disgusting  first time  Sad <EOR> This restaurant recommended waitress when asked good places off strip  Great atmosphere tasty Thai food friendly staff highly recommended! <EOR> Awesome service great Thai! satay Panang outstanding highly recommend cucumber sake with  awesome musters outside even 105 degree heat comfortable  Watch heat scale  3 Panang borderline hot eat! <EOR> So ate based off reviews Yelp   Don't mistake  wait time food horrible  talking wait seated talking time ordered until food   over 30 minutes  buddy both ordered when food ready just put side wait mine needless say food hot only warm   place over priced eating less half food gave just threw rest away <EOR> They pad Thai steak phenomenal! very traditional but great combination! sure rsv through Yelp because location long wait br nicely text when your table ready  <EOR> I crave place often! Usually 3 color curry brown rice   Husband loves jerky sticky rice   dipping sauce tasty   wings also come good sauce yet already flavored   It's different usual Thai paces which Archie's Pin Kaow which also good but think if those more family style eating Le Thai more order your own meal   huge fan noodles mainly curry appetizers   good!

Brilliant shrimp fried rice paired green curry   <EOR> It's avoiding place lots Thai options easier Downtown  fact ended last night based solely two facts late cook gifted gift certificate  way now problem because damn good am going fuss heading downtown more often   The vegan options unbelievably incredible  Clearly marked sever took order knew stuff redirecting when nearly ordered something vegan  final order ended being Masaman Curry Spicy Eggplant Drunken Noodles Pad See Ew    I've never spicy eggplant dish before mostly regulating eggplant breaded variety slathered marinara tucked safely into moussaka  dish changed mind  texture unreal sauce both sweet savory bit spicy full bodied umami flavor  cannot rave enough good was   The masaman curry going shoe in because reputable Thai restaurant doesn't killer curry? Loaded tender carrots potatoes all manner vegetables satisfying decadent would need truly say you're curry eater  Same Drunken Noodles    This place absolutely worth hype  deserves far more dedicated dining your behalf hapazard stop boozy night  during day fully appreciate complex flavors dishes offer vegans! <EOR> I really excited pick food until ignored takeout window 5 minutes  yes workers made eye contact carried on  nice wait shorter told  Then over great service when whiff food drive back hotel  Started eating short rib fried rice chicken wings ok  Maybe would've better sitting 5 minute drive  icing cake nice dead fly fried banana  Boo  <EOR> Food always great! favorite Thai places town!

A thirty minute wait Friday night but  expected  Place small but nice  Service great! text when your table ready which cool option    Would definitely come again! <EOR> I've wanted try place forever! love Thai food downtown vibe  thought going place would worthy 5 star review but lack service killed experience completely   It Thursday night around 7pm  seated back part restaurant given menus  Joel decided would share dishes since wanted try same things  waited probably 15 minutes no come by  No drink order nothing  waiter waitress continued walk right even look us  Finally when waiter walked asked if could order  He said waitress really busy  why she hadn't come but he would take order  ordered Short Rib Fried Rice egg top level 3  Joel ordered favorite Pad See Ew pork level 2  food took lot longer then expected  hungry wished we'd ordered appetizer  started noticing other tables come getting food  Weird  Finally came order! Mine very tasty  chunks short rib spice level perfect  Next time wouldn't spend extra $1 50 egg top  expecting runny could mix into rice but egg hard rock did nothing dish  Joel's Pad See Ew more broccoli then noodles but still great flavor    The decor very minimum but need kick heat lamps down bit  sweating storm just spicy food  high hopes Le Thai but service spend money somewhere else downtown  Sorry Le Thai lost me  <EOR> I looking place provided good vegan option friends all wanted something inexpensive side  They seated edge room where entire wall partially open bitter cold outside so your head warm but your legs freezing   Although heat lamps walls just counter intuitive   I ordered vegan curry which very excited see menu option chicken beef pork tofu  Now course assumed would VEGAN FAUX chicken beef pork because why world would someone offer REAL MEAT VEGAN curry?? Especially since explicitly told waitress didn't eat meat  ordered vegan curry chicken  Although friend didn't thought curry tasted fine   until started chewing meat which tasted blood iron sinew asked waitress only ordered tried let know vegan  All four table completely dumbfounded why anyone would offer Vegan Curry menu non vegan meat it?? even clear that?? when waitress told particular customer doesn't eat meat?? IMAGINE THAT  don't disturbed easily but very disturbed biting into flesh being vegetarian 7 years  $13 down drain me  I'm grudgingly giving 3 stars because friends did enjoy beef fried rice maybe waitress long day  But all all ridiculously counter intuitive place  <EOR> I've couple times enjoyed small cute half indoor half outdoor restaurant  summer months indoor seats really hard get  If sit outside roof covered net blocks some heat  also spray cool water mist cool off reminds being amusement park    They good lunch specials here  good chinatown but knock off dollar two regular pricing brings 10 bucks  tried drunken noodles curries eggplant basil pad Thai pad see ew  Everything very flavorful although sometimes salty   adjust spice level  always order everything mild medium did fine heat  dish don't pad Thai   supposed staple dish every restaurant but least here  traditional pad Thai  color little off definitely lacking taste  noodles also super mushy breaks into tiny pieces    I would definitely come back if craving thai food downtown Fremont area  <EOR> Yum! sister came Sunday night 20 minute wait sat outside beer  restaurant very small but servers friendly  food fantastic! ordered short rib fried rice chicken curry! Big portions cheap prices! definitely must every time come downtown <EOR> This absolutely number restaurant when downtown Las Vegas  Today late afternoon lunch ordered happy hour chicken skewers  waitress warned two sticks  would filling but six dollars couldn't imagine them being big    I must say wrong  happy hour appetizer chicken skewers would equivalent two full size chicken breasts  came small cucumber salad peanut satay dressing  really delicious  couldn't even finish appetizer hungry    I ordered beer didn't feel such Jew could give waitress big tip   I am seriously full happy belly  <EOR> Had pad Thai noodles chicken satay eggplant dish  spicy peanuts mister made experience awesome  <EOR> Such good Thai food   brought two Thai afficionado friends worked authentic Thai restaurant another traveled ate way through Thailand    both loved it    THe staff great   came during lazy saturday day gf sat bar chatted bartender   He gave free shots thai whiskey BJ shot bday although might've more own entertainment I qualify review admit joint pricey compared typical Thai food  i e  short rib fried rice savory delicious chunks meat 13$  including fried egg top  believe most curries around 10$ if you're getting regular meat closer 13$ if shrimp    That said food good enough came twice 1 day    albeit drunk second time    However you're guaranteed flavor packed dish cocktails legit  great refreshing fruity but overly sweet drinks   i e  Hendricks cucumber martini so cucumbery but bite Thailup Thai style Mojito made tamarind Pear tini sounds super girly but bf loved it  HA!
