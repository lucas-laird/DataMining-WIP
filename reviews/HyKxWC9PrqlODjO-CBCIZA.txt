The con I'd add fact food took really long time  bit time crunch next game little anxious food  Possibly may also because initial hunger tiredness made 30minute wait drag even longer  Plus group big there's more understanding  However noticed other reviews experience featured long wait time well     Other place great especially large party  others ordered half sheet pizza which filled them up  waitress handled multiple receipts perfectly won't stress dividing managing money within group if come big group! <EOR> Let start saying Facebook brought am excited ordered chop salad slice day both incredible    The chop salad Huge slice beautiful  am thrilled soon open old Blind Tiger location Pecos  certainly return customer  <EOR> Went group co workers while business Vegas  spent most time Speedway saw billboards track try it    awesome!
