Stupid employees don't know doing  person taking orders both drive thrus!!!!!!!!

Cause both head sets on    any complaint because dumb person working BOTH drive thrus skipped she took two orders row other drive thru while waiting good 5 mins just place order  <EOR> Brand new McDonalds but super slow! Waited over 30 mins food slow service!!! together people 30 mins way long  <EOR> The slowest McDonald's ever to!! Awful! Employees miserable well  Bad bad experience! <EOR> It's hard job but mission impossible mess ur food up  <EOR> We staying South Point Hotel across street  wanted quick breakfast meal decided Micky D's  restaurant appeared brand new  super clean most all didn't deal any smoke! people super nice   five people family two growing boys eat  good list items order because special dietary preferences because such pain orders sometimes nuanced  wasn't problem however cause order correct  staff super nice even checked twice ate meal   far fast food meals best Micky D's gone to   Oh no playground area  particular location appears cater older crowd which sense given location  <EOR> All could say place did upgrade needed done! Lol sorry might offend some people because new tech could controversially replace jobs people but still cashiers manually register your order those still pay cash need assistance through employee  new automated touch screen ordering system very time efficient helpful dealing lines waiting   Unfortunately only takes card  why still cashiers available  also love new touch screen beverage dispensers! McDonald's surprised comeback attracting loyal fast food customers new gadgets  Pretty soon everything become digital just menu! Lol <EOR> After seeing Deadpool 2 movie across street South Point last night cooking close McDonald's awhile  twins wanted chicken burgers that  ordering process guess being taken over machines since store new menu ordering done guest  believe future nice see being incorporated educating masses more familiar accept it  ordering simple even pay order machine    The decor McDonald's new fresh bench seats being replaced actual benches nicer eating atmosphere  fresh cut orchids all tables which such nice improvement making feel more inviting  staff bring food your table but opted order but did eat ice cream here  All food fresh bacon Mc Doubles nice touch  also expanded ice cream flavors options am glad now offer them carmel too! great ordering experience visit again just love orchids favorite flavor! <EOR> Omg!

Drive thru suppose quick buy ! <EOR> If use drive thru always double check your order  three occasions gave wrong item forgot something order  gave three stars because management did show empathy compensated mistake  <EOR> I live location come frequently through drive thru many visits felt compelled write review  Worst experiences ever had  Hasn't time where gone through drive thru waited 10 15 minutes received wrong food  understand most crew very young but cmon management  If majority time come night SHOULD take 20 minutes double quarter pounder fries  Anyways  all  OH WHY TWO LANES ONLY PERSON TAKING ORDERS ALL TIMES  smh damn much  <EOR> So   new location everything new clean functional  Why did give 1 star restaurant? easy came two times two issues    First issue tuesday night around 11 00pm friend ordered food 25 minutes still waiting meals! came back register cashier said because low staff  it!  Second issue tonight! ordered drive 4 mc Flurry took money 10 minutes waiting window someone came says cannot give order because product  ! FINE! manager came refund 2 Mc Flurry 4 because somebody told gave 2 them! WRONG! So park car  inside speak finally refund 2 others  !  Rude no customer service slow! need manage your team much better that!!  I know don't need Yelp doing business but lot other fast food where doing job! <EOR> Definitely ready prime time stopped first time last night real close where live tell girl eating course she doesn't pay any attention tries now help customer behind while still waiting number sign she finally figured gives number    After overly long period time find food just sitting bag clueless    The soft drink area filthy dirty when left trash overflowing trash bin    This worse McDonalds ever no comparison store Silverado Maryland Pkwy!  Won't returning anytime soon  <EOR> Ice cream machine always broken night hours    why? Works only during daytime   new McDonald but service seems rude    owner if reading this  Please better manager train your staff  Thank you <EOR> The place filthy dirty clean table myself when sat down eat which really frustrating since manager sitting lobby talking friend  still can't figure why place 2 stars  haven't even gotten food yet worried  <EOR> This best McDonalds to   service spectacular place clean pleasant visit  never yelp fast food restaurants but specific location awesome  <EOR> The manager squeaky voice joke needed help using mobile app just stood around talking laughing zero customer service purple shirt <EOR> Worst fast food restaurant to  Horribly slow service both drive through walk in  order kiosks user friendly take longer ordering regular person  Service suffering hire less people minimum wage ideal  <EOR> In appearance location immaculate  Everything you'd expect brand new store  Ordering via touch screen new but welcome commodity suffering laryngitis time couldn't talk much above whisper      And positivity stops there  ordered nearly $5 medium smoothie always thought overpriced but them enough pay extra dollars 10 piece nuggets  smoothie handed cup typically small size all traditional standards  But McD's smoothies designated medium  already knew this  issue cup wasn't full  Since already agreed pay more money smaller smoothie think least deserve completely full cup  When asked them fill original smoothie thrown away employee  didn't think necessary  fine them just making difference  couple minutes later informed smoothie flavor  nuggets 2 soggy visibly undercooked 1 bruised brown red discoloration  walked new batch nuggets no smoothie    I'm giving location 2 stars because staff nice apologetic fully refunded money    This location convenient way work  new store they're still learning guess  hope necessary improvements made may feel confident quality food if when return  <EOR> After volunteering all night emergency services stop 3am burger  Sorry food except certain breakfast items  wtf!!?? Only two cars ahead line drive thru amd Im still waiting 20 minutes line moving!!!! pick window employee tells 10 mins before food ready park car wait!!!! asked money back drove away   Can McDs any worse!? Employees downright rude acted hate jobs  worst most mismanaged McDs planet  <EOR> The mc Donald's Las Vegas Blvd warm springs sucks big fries burnt small would recommend place anyone fries looked tasted place SUCKS  if could give half star would <EOR> There isn't much write location   Most reviews right   Service extremely slow especially drive thru  double order drive thrus but don't seem know use it  double order drive thrus meant take two orders time but only seem back forth between two sides creates bottleneck  never problem food being cold orders being incorrect though  only inside once  new self order kiosks which pretty cool  really only keep coming location because just down road me  <EOR> Great place looks modern all but very slow service! Descent customer service people work kitchen need wear gloves often when grabbing food freezer did see couple them no gloves grabbing chicken freezer! need more people since new location always busy! need smile more! waited 20 minutes iced coffee wasn't busy work late work  just slow short staff need hire more people! I'd give 1 star I don't know if I'd again  <EOR> It's home 3 times  every time 100% messed order also right old dry  could see happening once while but 3 3? <EOR> I definitely excited another Mc Donald's closer definitely closer freeway entrance   haven't chance inside  ordered through drive thru seems dual order system  Which very unimpressive if wait until other Persian done ordering just literally sat heard complete order   am hoping just understaff system developed   finally completed order continues wait they're quite few cars ahead me  Finally hit next service window took form payment young lady looked most uninterested being there  definitely avoided making further eye contact parked next window waiting move  Geez talk awkward!  Anyhow definitely plan coming back awhile wait unbelievable time food fries warm chicken nuggets warm very strange smell! Which did back because didn't want waste anymore time here  Plus lady gave food kindly informed ran water bottles if wanted large beverage politely declined said don't drink stuff thats why ordered water she told she would happy give big cup water tempting toilet water sounds reminded am interested paying free water!  Wow!  all say!  am definitely pleased visit today! Nor am impressed new location need reevaluate manage place <EOR> I drive past lot since moving back side town ironic first visit location moving day Southwest   If McDonald's app Yelp would drove past recently opened location they opened just 6 days ago across South Point Casino   When arrived saw touchscreen ordering kiosks just off left walk across section traditional cashier station  Since using promo code heard straight counter instead kiosk but young lady said place order there   So bit more lost when dealing kiosk trying figure when would input promo code order   Luckily friendly very helpful manager stepped she did all customers came well asked if needed any assistance  letting know attempting she put order two Egg McMuffins paid cashier counter she promo Egg McMuffins   My order since still lot packing cleaning but back near future  But while waiting order prepared glanced around new McDonald's really modern looking dining area decor   Well  now    Positive vibes     2nd visit update    I came back some breakfast dine in  ordering process lot smoother second visit  fact order ready handed table even before back two packets ketchup   Also way tried use mobile app's Buy Caramel Macchiato kiosk but some error  trying resolve cashier station order ended getting completely comped  now feel even more obligated come back premium sandwiches lunch   I am loving it!!! <EOR>
