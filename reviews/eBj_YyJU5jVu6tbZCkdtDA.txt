Clear table then bring meal  busboys? Use them  also never pays respond typical question anything else need? because never need  simple request red pepper flakes which should within reach every table Italian restaurant completely ignored  guess he other things such deliver water each new customer regardless whether water requested not  I thought water shortage town  Never mind     Considering location Tivoli Village Rodeo Drive Summerlin service best cordial but hectic  Maybe adding more staff during Christmas season many offices having office parties days would helpful  am sure back say great food but dear friends bring your own red pepper flakes if your food spicy  <EOR> My husband always pass Brio talk going day dinner  Tonight finally dinner happy everything!!

 They'll probably just scoff then back yuppie gym I'm looking David Barton where apparently only people 8+ abs Armani workout clothes sweat out   Yes am fact wearing last last last season Adidas sneakers but defense rare blue pair pleather jacket     Tivoli Village nice but right caters specific clientele   window shopping unlike homeboy 50 Cent wow 'what I cannot afford even if I tried' syndrome took over   But digress back eating and fantasizing P Diddy's hidden 16 year old bastard son    Seems Brio only restaurants survived turmoil Tivoli Village   number eateries come gone over year   Now only comment late night Happy Hour 9 PM bar area   try regular restaurant some other time if ever back   hostesses nice showed exactly where bar area no time   Seats open told sit anywhere bar Happy Hour   chose nice little table towards wall section   waitress quick asked if interested some drinks if going stick around Happy Hour   told indeed Happy Hour immediately offered bar plate menus     There decent number dishes available during Happy Hour around 10 so   pricing good between $4 $6 each   number drink specials well   I stuck Peroni beer $4 exactly value but apparently cheaper normal   Really?  Damn markup must massive!  wifey wanted share Black Pepper Shrimp plate but according waitress cream sauce it   Huh?  hard kitchen whip cream sauce exactly?  certainly hope ITALIAN kitchen cream sauces all day long!  Alfredo anyone?  just beyond but OK   opted Roasted Garlic Spinach Artichoke Dip instead   also order Beef Carpaccio two BRIO burgers   Plates took around 20 minutes arrive average most restaurants   But wasn't exactly busy when don't know holdup was   gotta say though plates weren't exactly news write home about   Yes know Happy Hour yes know pricing considered 'cheap' but come now   some ugly looking plates!  Poorly executed most part   Roasted Garlic Spinach Artichoke Dip flatbread triangles alright   seemed sitting under heat lamp bit long side top layer hard   tasted ok but should ashamed say tastes something pick Costco?  Let BRIO burger   Wow   $5 this?  thin burger patty Provolone roasted tomato mayo looks Costco hamburger bun?  side housemade 'chips' once again could Costco?  Now before your panties twist adore Costco shop weekly and drink kale shake almost daily    just saying if same stuff ingredients Costco why Brio?  Why?  BRIO burger plated funny too   5 year old plate better this   burger no lettuce no tomato?  Cut into four pieces chips stuffed middle plate?  Rookies!  didn't taste greatest either   Burger overcooked dry cheese near non existent roasted tomato mayo barely much bun!  price could gone Wendy's right nearby gotten bigger burger   Just so so me   best item night Beef Carpaccio   Ultra thin slices raw beef topped dressed field greens capers mustard aioli shaved Parmigiano Reggiano   plate DELICIOUS   Beef nice cold greens great crunch capers mustard aioli added nice bite cheese gave extra layer flavor   heartily ate up   All $4!
