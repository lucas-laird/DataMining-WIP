Friendly atmosphere comfort level high  <EOR> Thought we'd give because convenience being summerlin area  9 40p ordered ramen fried rice gyoza app  Didn't gyoza until 10 40 ramen came 11 05 fried rice 11 15  Food sub par  many noted before looks pretty but taste bland  ramen noodles bottom bowl stuck together just opened package barely cooked in fact package   Peking duck fried rice over seasoned didn't resemble duck all well  Very disappointed experience  worth price they're serving  <EOR> Food amazing!!

Decor cool  Egg rolls edamame nothing special  Pad thai probably worst ever had  Looking around think chefs restaurant effort but taste just par  advise try sample those popular tasty pad thais some changes  might able away some but some other vets  <EOR> Red Rock regular live just few blocks away  must say food below average service staff manager weren't very friendly if didn't wanna work day  I Wouldn't recommend Noodle 8 bar worse enemy  many great Authentic Asian Cuisine options Las Vegas waste your time money Noodle 8 <EOR> Buns really good pork belly short rib  2 per order $9 buns regular size but meat portion bigger end compared others  Ramen really good  Noodles good broth alright but ingredients way better  Would come back both  <EOR> I looking forward trying place since Red Rock regular but disappointed when first and last meal here  ordered Pork Belly bowl $8 when came table half piece pork belly! serious? pork belly fun bite! can't call meal! also ordered Thai tea $4 which actually pretty good but charged $1 extra which fixed later  boyfriend's ramen $12 broth tasted funny even noodles suck  am going back place  <EOR> I ordered shrimp pad thai specifically asked nothing spicy hot any way  waiter brought dish burned lips mouth when pointed red specks told couldn't eat he said kitchrn must forgotten add spicr  NEVER AGAIN! <EOR> Fist time 8Noodle never return  wait while could see plenty seating  time sat could see other patrons looking around service  sat 10 min without anyone greeting us  walked out  Terrible  <EOR> Tonkatsu ramen definite avoid  If ever tonkatsu ramen instant another decent noodle house would realize savory  take bland nearly nauseating  friend fiance appalled couldn't finish   Their pork belly stringy almost undistinguishable bamboo  Broth incredibly oily  Servings way large  definitely quantity over quality    Service okay no complaints there  Restaurant tries hard overall upscale when technically open air  all sounds smells casino waft in  also charged 4 dollars pepsi which ridiculous  <EOR> Food's okay if you're craving Asian  But nothing your way for  short rib buns tasty but $8 two you'd expect bigger portion   Pad thai chicken decent but made regular flat wide noodles  More sweet side well   Service adequate  prepare food open cool if sit bar watch  <EOR> Heard new place excited try extremely disappointes  Im huge fan wonton noodle soup  But its super over price  Even though wonton soup under noodle soup section no noodles    $14 bucks shrimp maybe 4 chicken meat 4 straw mushrooms wontons   worth it  wasn't super tasty anything just okay   Server didn't bother refill ice tea  Slow service   The only good thing place clean  <EOR> Very flavorful affordable!!

Not sweet very slimy course yuck  Fake!  Disappointed   Now spring roll yummy  Very good    Had pad Thai total redemption  I <EOR> So first visit Noodle Bar   noonish hardly wait which perfect   ordered Pad Thai w Chicken which turned deliciously awesome husband enjoyed Spicy Shrimp which came w some pretty decent sized succulent shrimp but lacked flavor son noshed some edamame beans   Entree prices very good but lil steep drinks hence reason drink prices omitted menu $4 fountain drink kid's apple juice   food comes hot fresh really does taste wonderful though we'll definitely back again  <EOR> So first time being place craving some kind Asian fusion touch class did meet expectations   looking through all reviews yes new restaurant but God sakes give another chance    have open mind!

Good luck getting service once your seated   Oh did mention Pad Thai 7 30pm food came 15 minutes apart no refills water         <EOR> Can't believe let review pass long!  Came 8 Noodle Bar twice past summer first time being July 4th weekend where lucked room discount Red Rock Hotel Casino   being newest eatery hotel time just give try!  But eh kinda better Asian food   less fancy places     Décor 8 Noodle Bar nice very modern vibes open kitchen dining area   used noodle bowls decorate front!  But upon second glance being seated dining area small side   Some tables against wall bit close comfort when multiple parties eating   couple next close could hear each other's conversations!  Luckily nice people able exchange pleasantries no fuss   Back food   really mix sorts all over globe focus course being Asian   Japanese Chinese Vietnamese Korean cuisine all highlighted 8 Noodle Bar   love Asian food hard time deciding eat!  Wifey ended sharing Crispy Egg Rolls $7 pork carrots cilantro lime egg rolls served romaine lettuce leaves bean sprouts sliced chili peppers various dipping sauces Grilled Beef Short Rib Bao Bun $8 ginger sake reduction cucumber red onion Veggie Pad Thai $10 rice noodles tofu egg bean sprouts assorted veggies peanuts lime  Everything came very well presented platters   But servings seemed small!  Especially price!  give larger plate food less money keep your ambience!  major gripe here   Food overall OK   forgot pic but first orders Crispy Egg Rolls send back!  Upon first bite long HAIR within egg roll!  Yes inside it!  Besides totally being grossed immediately taken back into kitchen   server nice enough only ask if alright but ask if could another order egg rolls hair free   only did also took charge egg rolls off bill   Good them that   being said second batch Crispy Egg Rolls tasty!  There's only 3 per order but bit larger ones you'd find your typical Asian eatery   good wrapped lettuce leaf topped some hot chili sauce but found myself looking amazing fish sauce vinegar dip find Vietnamese egg rolls   also wanted some hoisin sauce condiment well these   probably should asked   The Veggie Pad Thai also good but again portion size lacking   money hoping more noodles!  pad thai flavorful healthy amount broccoli which isn't all common pad thai know    hard pick tofu though which smaller amounts   some great crunch though addition crushed peanuts top   The Grilled Beef Short Rib Bao Bun star night!  But course wish more 2 plate!  delicious!  short rib fall off the bone tender succulent whatever sweet savory soy sauce based glaze cooked in   tart crunch came pickled red onion cucumber played well off soft short rib   buns nice supple too!  love some supple buns!  Steamed just right airy dry all   could eaten half dozen happy man   But $4 pop some pricy buns   Overall average first experience 8 Noodle House   enjoy fact Red Rock Hotel Casino trying cater Asian folks no Panda Express food court does count good effort   There's still some kinks work portion size!
