Try halo halo    think best town  <EOR> My first Goldilocks experience San Jose California great first impression  when saw Goldilocks Vegas pretty happy first time food old cold BUT thought maybe bad day   so tried second time months later    old cold brought back time?? pre packed baked goods Those salvage location  <EOR> It's nice Filipino cafe closer side town but place isn't die for  merely holds over when having craving pastries lumpia! Some people family love cakes but think taste stale almost freezer burned  little pricey food tastes could re heated  haven't since expanded dining room  <EOR> I wasn't impressed Goldilocks Bake Shop when comes service even food   Visited couple times last year   Normally visits request mom when she's town   She doesn't complain much but could tell she's never really satisfied food   always feel am inconveniencing employees just walking having them ring up   Simple Hello Thank even smile would brought rating least 3     My most recent visit some freshly baked Pan De Sal   Guess What??  No do   Once walked just realized wasn't Valerio's where sell fresh Pan De Sal   No fresh Pan De Sal also means no freshly made Filipino Pastries   ended getting Ensaymada just give them little business     Also   no credit debit if purchases less $10   Just happens day forgot hit ATM   No problem   found enough spare change car purchase    I've Goldilocks Vallejo San Jose San Diego   Never issue those locations   probably way come back   But if mom town she wants Pinoy food then guess no choice  <EOR> I most Filipino food tried place pretty cool me  raving sister in law's pianono since Thanksgiving 2007 looking good substitute since  little loafs purchase here  All though compare ability take edge off craving  found new favorite Ube  don't know but it  favorite color    PURPLE    I actually stopped eat seeing Filipino husband says no matter mom makes  Still don't know next time leave behind  <EOR> So getting crazy hungry Costco saw sign Goldilocks    I've wanting some Filipino pastries perfect timing I JUST talking enseymada night prior    They small prepped food selection but Crispy Pata calling cook order menu  Oh hypertension! server asked if eating immediately told please sit myself down  think might expanded since 1st persons review since good sized dining room  He prepped table some utensils plates cups water asked drink order well   The BF still full lunch he Ube Shake Boba  crispy pata la carte order side rice  pretty decent far being soft juicy inside having good chip crisp skin  happy  havent long time but those SHOULDN'T eat regular  Ube shake good flavor but ice rather coarse shake   Halo Halo would good but drink    They came check also brought bag pastries selected Ham Enseymada Puto Bumbong   both pretty good asked if anything else    If bigger busy Goldilocks lot more impersonal  Order seat yourself throw your own paper plates plastic utensils away  kinda taken aback Filipino hospitality  Doesn't matter if fast food want comfortable why give 4 when most Goldilocks 3 being just A OK food minimal customer service  never take granted caring staff    Will come back  plus fairly close house  other location way other side town  <EOR> I pretty stoked learn Goldilocks store near place but wound disappointed when entered store  Severely lacking entrees choose baked goods limited well  Prices bit high side  Might well Seafood City buy Goldilocks pastries generally few cents cheaper  Lady behind counter wasn't pleasant nor helpful  Off day perhaps?  Maybe just spoiled other Goldilocks chain stores California  check other Henderson though  Hopefully location much better  <EOR> This place horrible  am Filipino place puts shame  ate family day service slow food sucked  server never order right served cold food  boba drink ordered should first sign because bland blended right consistency  server never even checked polite ONLY table place    this place utter disappointment if want crappiest service horrible food place you  <EOR>
