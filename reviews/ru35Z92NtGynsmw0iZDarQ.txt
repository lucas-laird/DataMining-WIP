Since doing Low Carb Keto life even though planned cheat Unsweetened Iced Tea lemon  smooth tasting  Then brought chips salsa  salsa kick!!! very good! Even tortilla chips good!    Here many reviewers don't understand  mom pop authentic restaurant  If you've ever anywhere Latin America eaten local restaurant same service food  fact heard different woman's voice kitchen possible assume Abuela Grandma Tía making food! Menu both Spanish English  food Lengua Tongue Birria Sopes Ceviche BUNCH other authentic dishes! Americanized food!! let just tell Soft Tacos actually reasonably priced $1 99!!!! ONLY joint 1 small street taco $2  Gusta Tacos charge $3 50 1 taco  Other places charge more 1 taco!!! Those street tacos should really $1 each! But   I understand need profit  $1 99 far more reasonable $3 50! Carne Asada tacos POINT!   One thing love place serve Breakfast ALL DAY!!! Huevos Divorciados Divorced Eggs   Which 2 eggs red green salsa see photo   Because Ketogenic Low Carb life only cheat tortillas  breakfast plate default served Beans Rice However asked Bacon instead asked Guacamole side  charged Bacon but all good  also ordered 3 Carne Asada soft tacos everything  husband Carnitas plate Chile Relleno side    My tacos much better expected!!
