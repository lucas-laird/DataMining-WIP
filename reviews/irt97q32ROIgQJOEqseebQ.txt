You'd think would some great food kind wait but even grocery store bought sushi waaaay better     Don't come take word it  <EOR> You know when walk into Chinese Japanese Mexican restaurant everything menu expensive tell food can't good? place   You know when walk into sushi place some guy isn't Japanese serving you? sushi cut wrong? place   You know when walk into restaurant tell high prices mediocre food designed fool tourists? place  <EOR> The worst place during whole stay Vegas   We tried all eat sushi $19 95 which limited certain sushi rolls  Lol good thing didn't order individual rolls $7 $10 pop  rice same texture costco's packed premade sushi totally gross! ended just eating fish middle leaving rice haha  cucumber salad miso soup decent but service lacked  <EOR> we came all eat while waiting take flight back home   $20 when hung over fresh wasn't bad except vegetable roll   mashed peas? I wouldn't most likely waste 'dining opportunity' again being vegas and being such whore hot wings etc but wasn't terrible certainly cheap vegas standards convenient    If hungry strip want sushi better some  <EOR> It's long time since lured place sweet location AYCE sushi but still recall worst meals ever had  <EOR> Oh goodness where even start   Ok group 6 people 2 people ordered $20 00 all eat sushi rest ordered regular menu  breakdown experience    1 Horrible service  waiteress very mean slow negligent very effing rude     2 all you can eat sushi tasted old costco sushi   Nasty   rice tasted old really dry   seafood very scarce only order 3 rolls time   took forever waitress come back each time order more sushi   3 ordered Tom Kha soup tasted nothing should be   watered down oily wasn't even spicey!!!!   4 friends ordered combination fried rice very dry bland   Even meat tasted rubber   5 took forever waitress bring check us   She knew done eating long time ago she still ignored us   6 restaurant manager A hole   horrible horrible experience complained manager he being such asshole   He telling should brought attention beginning dinner  reason why waited because gave benefit doubt   trying really hard understanding hoping service would improve but didn't   he tell when complain   He just made restaurant look even more stupid   because waited long complain he only comped 2 all eat sushi even though majority ordered nasty hell   still complained he ended taking off fried rice   Big freaking whoop     I seriously hope restaurant closes down least new management   seem pretty unorganized judging other reviews only thinks restaurant down drain   Avoid restaurant all means   Don't let all eat banner outside fool you   Save your money run!!!! Run far far away place! <EOR> During stay Las Vegas decided try Ah Sin because close right across Bellagio frontal view water show   However regretted once food came   We did learn lesson all this  Don't forget check yelp before trying new restaurant    Two iphones    failed utilize tools     The food horrendous  All agreed never sushi bad before  2 just stopped eating because couldn't handle anymore  However did continue eating admitting worse he ever had he's those eat ANYTHING when he hungry  description sushi tightly packed semi hard rice small sliver previously refrigerated fish  watching couple having dinner across expressions face priceless  guy having trouble swallowing could easily tell  girl glass water refilled rate twice minute       The view spectacular  pleasure seeing 3 water shows  weren't same Bellagio changes songs way water pressure moved  awesome view made suffering little more bearable  If knew guys California would told guys order all eat   sorry couldn't tell beforehand because would fired  server hilarious! all good laugh meal  He did good job bringing food quickly refilling glasses etc but he able sort connect good laugh  able save another couple ordering all eat    If no star option would give restaurant none  two things understand  first does restaurant serves 2nd rate food maintain reputation keep pay lot  prime corner street right across Bellagio  Another question applies many restaurants  Why maintain all you can eat option when does further your reputation  promotion if want but don't keep it  see results failing AYCE option yep page  <EOR> Ordered hamachi sashimi sake nigiri Caterpillar roll   whole bill came $40 tax tip   sushi fresh enough sat sushi bar   came last resort having walked around Paris Bally casino finding anything good   place pretty much dead   wanted try Mon Ami Gami but wait atrocious husband says mediocre food   better choices Caesar's Bellagio but couldn't bring myself another 20 minute walk just cross street tonight  <EOR> Saw place while walking by  later night ordered drinks all eat sushi special  sushi brought frozen put microwave!!!!!! When told waitress quality food she said other sushi off regular menus made sushi bar  asked fresh she said Uum     yes  When asked she meant told she fired if she answers question she tell other ways  paid bill eat somewhere else! NEVER HERE!!! <EOR> I hate rag fat ugly kid recess but Ah Sin really does deserve low Yelp rating   Service subpar  Food wasn't great  mood sushi Ah Sin's disappointed  only thing felt good 7 7 ordered long day work    On paper restaurant seems perfect well decorated fancy looking perfect location viewing Bellagio's fountain  guess something give unfortunately restaurant itself  Skip place if can  <EOR> this place just whatever  im picky food but would never bring anyone here  service ok taste wasn't super bad but think probably better food OK hole wall place  can't believe its even casino  actual restaurant its self really nice location strip views but damn  need replace place something else    more life flavor  <EOR> We lured into place big surly convincing man suit promised world actually he just offered all eat sushi    The restaurant decor pretty nice  give that  However unfortunate experience sitting next big table young 20 somethings just way giddy vegas  Management didn't anything profanity constant yelling etc  etc    Also there's no bathroom place! walk outside casino floor use bathroom  What's that? exactly close either   Don't confuse all eat sushi sushi buffet  You're seated table order limited variety choices  order made fresh brought your table  However problem none choices particularly interesting  If intentions eating dragon roll volcano roll etc  you're stuck eating basic tuna salmon rolls whole meal  <EOR>
