Absolutely!  Fat Choy better restaurant say Joel Robuchon?  Uh     NO   But when factor price yeah say yes because average tab per person tax tip included Fat Choy $15 20 whereas average cost per head Joel Robuchon 25 quadrillion dollars OK slight exaggeration    The quality food Fat Choy very good   When consider bang for your buck Fat Choy off charts   Where else Las Vegas anywhere America matter roasted bone marrow $8 duck confit $12?  Those two menu items put gourmet category other two categories Asian fusion American standards   big fan bone marrow just bit rich flavor strong tastes   said did think bite when cousin ordered pretty good   cousin finished off every last bit marrow flabbergasted price insisting bone large he would expect pay $20 least   But am huge fan duck confit Fat Choy good anywhere else bonus astonishingly low price   In Asian category favorite pot stickers   always baffed pot stickers every single Chinese restaurant menu America because never much cared them   But wow love pot stickers Fat Choy   wrapper isn't gummy rubbery every Chinese restaurant ever eaten filling leaner more savory   other favorites sesame noodles fried pork sauce noodles   sesame noodles feature some mushrooms I forgot which variety add delicious layer flavor sesame   If let fried pork sauce sit couple minutes noodles absorb all deliciousness fried pork   Both baos great pork belly duck   foodie budget describes T Peking duck bao real gourmet treat   Again many places Las Vegas anywhere else enjoy gourmet quality seven bucks??  The menu category don't much care American standards   Don't wrong they're done OK   just don't kind food   But if chicken wings spaghetti meatballs cheesesteaks right your alley you'll satisfied Fat Choy   Much made smoke issue inside Eureka Casino which described local magazine kind casino where chain smoking gamblers surgicaly grafted favorite slot machines   borrow immortal wisdom Bart Simpson funny because true   Fat Choy recently smoke eater system which helped tremendously smoke issue   admit used pretty bothered times smoke blowing casino   If you're extremely smoke sensitive smoke eaters might enough   Actually if you're extremely smoke sensitive you'll never survive walk through casino restaurant   But smoke issue now non issue   The very short walk through smokey casino well worth it   Besides great food astonishingly low prices Fat Choy passionately committed executive chef Sheridan Su terrific warm friendly genuine warmth friendliness Las Vegas? staff headed general manager Jenny Wong   any foodie trip Fat Choy good idea   foodie budget absolute must  <EOR> I'm sad give place 2 stars bc husband great experience last couple times when here   especially loved baos but  when ate recently baos different  ordered mushroom tofu bao wasn't same  If remember correctly tofu mushrooms cut but time put slab tofu which prefer cut mixed mushrooms  duck bao didn't taste flavorful  took food 30 40 mins come restaurant wasn't even busy  want old Great Bao come back! <EOR> A total joy!

Did toon PEPSI REMIX machine? here!!! love it <EOR> Tasty Asian fusion treats priced cheap but quality food   enjoy shortrib fried rice veggies   big menu but packed flavors imagination   also burgers cool toppings   Easy access hotel restaurant off Sahara   used represent former owners menu boring compared one   Friendly service spacious counter seating  <EOR> I didn't realize place hasn't officially opened   According staff its still considered soft opening   Located inside smoky casino Fat Choy  knew nothing place except brick n mortar food truck @GreatBaoLV   Overall good comfort food  Portions sharable but huge   Free wifi but tiny place sure once place gets buzzing it'll food many   Its better 3 star but quite 4    If wasn't such smoke filled casino I'd back  <EOR> This everything hoped would be  friend decided lunch today  Taking cue Diners Drive Ins Dives tried Bao buns  main entree short rib grilled cheese friend cheesesteak sandwich  Everything delicious met all expectations   It wasn't really busy inside seated right away  wait staff perfect fact waited two separate waitresses  came checked frequently sure everything perfect  Between quality service deliciousness food absolutely give place five stars  <EOR> Da Hunny says Fat Choy burger 2nd best burger he ever damn fine burger  Dumplings we're yummy duck bao good but nice slice duck little crunchy skin instead bits pieces would better  Absolutely love wonton soup! Perfect warm rainy day Vegas  Oh! both crazy waitresses just lovely! <EOR> This spot bookmark while  appreciate Asian cuisine twist attracted items pictured  expecting wowed but really wasn't  Drove across town perhaps still bitter We duck bao which tasted good but cold time it  hoping bite into warm fluffy bao  also lacking meat but did crispy duck skin inside  Didn't read description see if supposed duck only duck skin bao  short rib grilled cheese thought cheddar sharp  Even kid agrees he loves cheese  Fries ok nothing spectacular  He special burger which tasted pretty good    If returned would only bao  <EOR> This location place faint heart  only located well off strip but nestled inside really seedy casino where would venture alone   Besides fact food definitely worth trip! Although tried several entrees short rib rice grilled cheese w short ribs star truly baos  Specifically duck pork belly baos  eaten duck baos Chinese restaurants but ones Fat Choy best tasting ones ever had  duck piece perfect amount crispy skin fat just splash hoisin sauce  High quality ingredients prepared clean simple way! <EOR> So bunch times still really food but place definitely some issues  far only lunch pretty empty each time there's never more 3 other tables filled  give restaurants leeway being slow inattentive when they're understaffed busy but there's always 2 waitresses 2 3 people kitchen   I think asian waitress came over Great Bao amazing friendly knowledgable food really it  other 2 3 had    not much  They've given wrong order twice despite being empty only having total 5 burgers sandwiches choose from  time right food but forgot add egg pbblt there's always something w place   We usually eat then 2 3 separate orders bring back coworkers  Today VP noticed receipt said $9 then magically total became $10 see pic  Leave finance guy notice something that    http www yelp com user_local_photos?select=3yRadq4tgXdb_zjDa4KwPA userid=dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA  So evidently Fat Choy thinks ok charge $1 each order without telling anyone front even listing receipt  fees no problem paying it  But think way sheisty deceitful slip without informing anyone hiding receipt    It's printed menu despite person phone said no waitress ever mentioned any point  told clearly posted cash register  Which nobody really even pays because waitresses nothing ready made end sitting waiting your food regardless order    Yeah just effen $1 but since separate orders coworkers added over time  never understood to go fees anyway because don't tipped take orders? cost box because you're never charged take home leftovers why would pay $1 privilege also dirtied plate silverware cup?   So whatever next time just ordering everything eat dirtying plates then making bring boxes them  please don't spit food because still gave 4 stars even though guys p*ss off sometimes     <EOR> I'm gonna quick because still eating Fat Choy Burger way   still even buffalo sauce fingers wings   place best traditional wings Vegas  Period   could walk away right now perfectly happy    The burger just table took bite now currently debating whether want bum rush kitchen hug cook     Just come here   Seriously  <EOR> Fabulous food great service diner motif  short rib grilled cheese sandwich  Unbelievably delicious    Even hot tea tasty   Next time try duck  <EOR> Good service but food just ok  pork belly which really fatty wonton soup which didn't much flavor  <EOR> Going 50mins waiting order 1 pork boa 1 duck boa fries fried rice ice cream   Only checked twice within time frame   we want food!!!
