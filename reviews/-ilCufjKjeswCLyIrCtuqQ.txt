This first restaurant bar hit Vegas graduation trip  atmosphere very laid back dim lit restaurant dated bar old school box tvs  mainly attracted $2 tacos tequila shots which sold me   Tacos decent although few $2 tequila shots pints which also 2 bucks they're pretty bomb  asked bartender kind tequila no clue! However service fast efficient but very friendly   Overall I'd give place 3 stars people budget 2 stars aren't <EOR> It's strange fairly limited late night dining options Vegas  seems most casinos all night cafe diner type food bars munchies  nice restaurants always closed middle night  Well night didn't feel diner grub didn't want another hotel settled munchies Tequila Bar Grill    Average syrupy frozen margaritas  Lousy food tasted frozen Costco appetizers thrown fryer  only bad meal ever Las Vegas Strip  <EOR> Friendly staff great margaritas cheap ones $1 chicken taco great cheap meal  enjoyed Platinum Margarita bad top shelf  <EOR> Loved restaurant  great start vacation  Even though 11 group very quick accommodate us  able put tables together could conversations provided 4 separate checks no errors  food great service quick  definitely visit again when vacation next year  <EOR> I've couple times once try defeat big plate nachos   Myself two other friends unable dominate beast but close   also 3lb burger challenge if you're feeling redeem yourself getting your ass kicked slot machine   tried baby rack rib dinner food average spectacular tasting but large portion   Good late nights if you're area want munch appetizers  <EOR> Food ok  Price pretty reasonable  Spend some more somewhere else better meal  <EOR> This regular stop wife whenever we're Vegas  ain't fancy service hit miss we usually sit bar but cheapest places Strip  food pretty good when great drink specials  said nothing fancy but great place relax few drinks bite eat  <EOR> If Nachos then here  should take some friends because plate huge  gone few times food good price  $2 00 Margaritas just but still drunk good price  great place meet friends good inexpensive time  gone other places paid much few drinks drinks meal here  <EOR> Avoid place if rush  looking quick bite before show Bally's popped into Tequila Bar  only orderd couple hamburgers  cooked order but could tell beef fresh no seasoning  fries stale  service beyond slow  never good meal any restaurant Bally's care give them another chance  <EOR> Do skip place! place where spend your money anywhere hidden gem strip!!!

If weren't fact moral issues getting leaving without paying even if only drinks would done it  Our waiter only left halfway through meal without telling anyone but even when he everything drink order drink reception took least 20 minutes minimum   food order which soups appetizers took well over 45 minutes come out  Another thing    grandma ordered tortilla soup looked and tasted lot Texas chili   just tortilla strips added  I think more used people wasted don't keep track normal details restaurant service requires   would NEVER recommend place sober drunk   But hey if 4 30am no where else serving food your munchies then works  <EOR> Ordered Cadillac Margaritas think all margarita mix no tequila $7  Way sweet  running special shots Jose $2 bought couple add drinks cut sweetness  Note shots maybe ounce  Much small acutal shots  ordered nachos HUGE! Definitely highlight lots good toppings  No way 2 finishing them although gave good run   supposed gotten $2 discount nachos Total Rewards card which didn't get  didn't notice until later though didn't feel going back arguing $2  All in all OK place but years ago remember drinks great I'd spend hours hanging there  Now? much  <EOR> Ordered grande nachos  HUGE! Eating vegetarian Vegas usually easy   asked if way nachos vegetarian indeed was  them put meat side which works great if you're people eat meat  parents chose chicken said flavorful cooked well  we're definitely worth trying  also told order tacos beans instead meat vegetable wrap *My mom wanted breakfast ordered scrambled eggs cheese home fries sausage patties sourdough toast  She said just normal breakfast  Tasty but nothing special  <EOR> very good $2 tacos awesome chips salsa  great service  5 tacos chips salsa root beer  $15 great deal <EOR> Best guacamole ever!  three taco combo   All great   Margaritas terrific   Excellent service   Can't wait back  <EOR> I low standards but place terrible   I starving stupidly decided try place out  Waited few minutes table clear would kill guys hire hostess? Sat down dirty table guy comes wet rag brushes all debris onto floor  should hint  elsewhere  ordered wings appetizer  Wings lathered spicy sauce masked fact overcooked  forgot entree but unremarkable sure  Drinks cheap guess  Food overpriced something probably just microwaved  <EOR> $1 dolla tacos  thats all gotta say    Come those tacos chicken better some cheap drinks you'll leave happy camper  believe might open 24hr day perfect long night partying losing your money!   The only complaint length takes your food  came twice night  first time taco experience which said left happy camper  Second time came around 5AM ordered chicken quesadilla onion rings to go  order took 35 minutes make  thought pretty long wait given pretty slow time    Other cool place grab some cheap food drinks before your night! <EOR> My wife hit place last night when trying find something eat Ballys  staff very friendly  food quickly  ended ordering wings nachos tacos    few drinks course The nachos could definitely feed two ppl! food overall good  But no wow factor Something found quite enjoyable fishbowl margaritas tequila sunrise! <EOR> Ive only multiple times long night early morning drinking always order El Hefe Nachos  feed 4 5 people easy only $16  hidden gem inside Ballys!
