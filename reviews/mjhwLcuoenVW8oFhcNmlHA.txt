Food great serve BIG portions careful apps filled right fried zucchini fed 3 then bring your side dish next last could barely finish main course!!!! <EOR> I frequent restaurant because location convenient me  food really good comes big portions  also catering menu  manager Ed very helpful friendly  last visit however disappointed   young lady helped catering order very helpful  She said ran paper plates when asked guests eat salad she just shrugged said don't paper plates   ask boxes option   When back office lunch she did put dressing salad   service very disappointing but food always delish  probably again but request different server lady  Total disappointment time around!!!! <EOR> We used come Claim Jumper lot but stopped because most food just rich   But time group friends Happy Hour great experience   bar really cozy rustic spot table right front fireplace which kept nice toasty   Contrast all other restaurants town blast air conditioning when temp 45 degrees outside sit bundled while eat   Kudos that!  None very hungry HH menu fit bill perfectly   ordered Long Island Iced tea when waiter brought thought uh oh  pale could looked glass water   But when tasted shocked strong good 4 bucks!  I shared chicken Street Tacos friend   really small chicken bit dry but stuff put top really fine $3 really can't complain   tasted friend's ceviche delicious   also shared Calamari another friend   really good drowning breading but tender wonder if really calamari?  very small portion but again HH prices   Also shared black bean hummus chips $2 only thing absolutely skipable   bad wasn't just ordinary hummus   One group ordered just drink didn't eat anything bill very small   Despite server terrific never once hinted weren't worth time   think name Niles he gem   left very nice tip paltry bill   vowed next Happy Hour right back Claim Jumper  <EOR> I dinner other night husband some colleagues  While looking over menu noticed some ladies table only going order dessert  already knew plan was  order humongous dessert take three bites say full finish  just some girls do   but me  didn't want table think pig  mulled over mind second    thought   fooling husband already knows eat  no secret even when dating didn't hide fact   he may think something wrong if don't eat! then placed order appetizer cup Potato Cheese Soup main entree Whiskey Apple Glazed Chicken  soup nice creamy bits potatoes tiny bacon strips top  really hearty oh good! Whiskey Chicken served sweet whiskey apple sauce served over apple sourdough herb stuffing red skin mashed potatoes roasted vegetables side  melody flavors really well together  reminded dish would Thanksgiving Christmas  entree also comes Cheesy Garlic Toast which favorite  usually served marinara sauce if appetizer  Since came meal no sauce but taste could definitely stand itself  portions really big  I lighter portion 11 95 still could finish it  take other half home! <EOR> First time here  Last time here  son received coupon place elementary school achieving honor roll free kids meal purchase entree   receiving drinks before ordering food presented coupon server  three minutes ordering food entree brought out  Before salads  15 minutes several times server passing saying husband's food 2 kids' food way well husband asked if food maybe someone else's order which she denied  called bullshit  husband called bullshit  no way salmon entree could cooked short amount time  decided leave canceled food requested check drinks  Beyond gross trying reserve food  should call health department  <EOR> Super sized offerings and prices does good restaurant make!
