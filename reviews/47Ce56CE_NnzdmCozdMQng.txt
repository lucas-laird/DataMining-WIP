La Takiza isn't cheapest but certainly best   usually order daily special which two tacos choice beans rice around 6 bucks   favorite tacos Al Pastor but Chorizo also very good   Al Pastor perfectly seasoned served little bit pineapple salsa which really accents spiciness pork   tortillas always warm soft yet hard enough hold your taco   tried almost everything La Takiza very pleased everything but would suggest getting Super Taco al pastor!   If love tacos live Vegas alarmed La Takiza's random location there! <EOR>
