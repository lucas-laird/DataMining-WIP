hostess when place evidently less 50% full  Each time she cordial unprofessional  Great food good prices sub par staff seating practices  prefer steak medium without side aggravation  <EOR> The food great   server did best very little support   Which unfortunate because table 14   wine list several errors it   manager seemed problem service   Should four stars   many options Vegas going back  <EOR> Amazing kids really fancy fancy need wear suit tie  chill love wear shorts tank top sandals  Service nothing shy but perfect  Super friendly  Food comes timely manner  If you're prime rib lover MUST go  Price perfect great quality price perfect <EOR> I've few times  time review   Food only Southpoint cut medium rare salad  Salad your usual bagged lettuce usual veggies  rice pilaf which tastey well baked potato  servers need learn portion butter sour cream add potatos  small potato shouldn't come glob butter almost same size potato    ruined it  prime rib however always great  Well seasoned overly fatty always cooked right  Deserts satisfactory  Peach bread pudding very dense  Cheesecake run mill   Service nothing write home about  server took while anything  done eating still some wine finish she wanted rush out  told going stay chat while finished bottle never saw again  took 25 minutes telling until able someones attention take credit card  helper busser ther personality smashed kitty  Even trying engage conversation all blank stare  Being locals recognized accent even asked where he try spark convo since weren't busy  Still just stare  Very weird since also work service industry    Atmosphere Very clean tasteful  wasn't very busy during Saturday night 630pm dinner rush  did large table drunkerds next would think would sit smaller tables away those types  hard hold decent conversation own table table 18 drunks next us    Overall think worth $15 full prime rib dinner  service management definitely needs worked though  <EOR> Returned brother in law's 65th birthday spelled pronounced name three times Tim came Tom  Also $24 95 large birthday dessert enough eight people too  showed note Tom can't comprehend  disappointed  But Tim prime rib blackened said best he ever had  <EOR> Being Memorial Day weekend thought might good idea reservation  wife arrived ten minutes before reservation gave name  woman front desk just looked wrote something down started doing something else  stood around five minutes before another woman came seat us  The dining room dull old  booth full crumbs waitress came bring water didn't speak English very well  think she trying take drink order but neither wife could understand her  She gave water disappeared   Our waiter told special but did give any explanation meal  heard waiter another table describe special very eloquently  Southpoint Prim Rib wife salmon   The split pea soup pretty good  Good texture without being mushy just right amount ham carrots  wife tossed salad bleu cheese  disappointed bread came before salad  hard use steak knife cut though crust  very center ok but WOW sitting hours even days   My wife really enjoyed salmon but surprised find substituting veggies potatoes $2 charge  prime

even but pretty sure no return restaurant because poor atmosphere lack customer service  prices plus well  If no expectations good customer service anything resembling ambiance place you  Otherwise check any other scores steakhouses Las Vegas  <EOR> I enjoy hidden place off strip   located South Point hotel upstairs   cowboy cut bone worth $29 99 price   sides great Jalapeno Creamed corn good    wait long usually   strip would paying twice much   good cut meat very reasonable price   recommend  <EOR> To start off place good food  Don't let 2 stars take away come quite often  why writing clearly plenty people establishment  However over weekend family reservations 12 baby grandfathers 85th birthday  Now understand its Rodeo week South Point everyone place happened busier usual but did reservation @7  When family arrived before told no could sit until entire party arrived  Since surprising grandfather made quite hard he could shown any minute  time arrived 15 mins prior reservation stood host stand family waiting host actually Manager acknowledged me  more people walked seems she less interested still never once looked even bothered ask if all there  She then walked away young man greeted took table  She returned even eyed down way table she still didn't look up  know she saw reading name tag   poor decision behalf  sat round table chairs basically forced next each other while mind also toddler needed highchair  Eventually brought everyone able sit tightly  believe server also another Manager could tell quite overwhelmed only busy but fact he take care table  vibe coming off pretty depressing  He didn't seem interested table seemed want ordered out  Large parties should never just sitting empty while waiting dinner  Bread brought second sat down but never refilled  Salads showed long all ordered but then waited another 30 mins all prime rib show up  Which obviously 12 steaks take time cook then should time anything before main course appropriately  When food finally did come course all enjoyed it  said food still good  Then told don't full wait till see desserts coming out  Then brought piece chocolate cake 2 small pieces cheesecake plate said Happy Anniversary     told them mistake clearly Birthday balloons gifts corrected brought back saying Happy Birthday   However 12 people share small dessert no plates just fork basically saying pass around each take bite   complete joke! Nor offered any more desserts choose only coffee tea  Needless say all quite disappointed services night spending 2 hours there  father restaurant manager 40 years lived 5 different countries working some finest places just sub par service  Can't say want back even recommend anyone  Yeah sure food good but find great Prime Rib many other places  <EOR> My wife other day busy   nice plus there's bar right outside restaurant some good drink deals bring them in     The menu prices very reasonable although $10 split plate charge bit high given other prices menu   burger wife filet medallions   bread served prior meal pretty good enjoyed salad split pea soup got   thought burger fries fantastic but wife did really care filet   She thought mushrooms top good although sauce not   She separate side mushrooms did care those   also split mac cheese shredded beef bbq sauce it   mac cheese totally overpowered bbq sauce   So I'd say food bit above average but service left something desired   server Marija I think? attentive first but less meal on   point she said main entrees would coming couple minutes almost 10 minute wait point   Additionally biggest pet peeve finished food over 10 minutes no check   Eventually just front podium ask check manager   took additional 3 minutes check point   no point did manager server apologize this   Maybe if different server would 3 4 stars instead     On top all allow wax poetic second   Why three steakhouses South Point?  understand there's really high end Michael's regular Silverado but purpose does Primarily Prime Rib serve?  usual deli coffee shop ice cream shop buffet 24 hour cafe options plus specific restaurants Italian Asian Mexican seafood   Additionally only Steak Shake Vegas   Essentially totally killing restaurant option game when comes non Strip casinos Vegas   really should consider moving some more popular menu items Primarily Prime Rib menu Silverado instead then put something even more unique its place    Perhaps Indian Thai teppanyaki even gastropub   just nix entirely use space new high limit area  set apart main casino even more  <EOR> Based reviews expecting tasty experience  atmosphere nice prime rib joint prices reasonable since soup salad potato accompany entrees  Service friendly attentive  food presented nicely sourdough bread basket fresh rosette butter pats but disappointed meals flavor  though cooks afraid season it  taste everything blah  If wasn't fresh peaches dried fruit candied pecans spinach salad lacked flavor acidity  all sweet enough acid give any dimension   ordered Chipotle Glazed Salmon  Yes could feel heat but otherwise no flavor   rarely salt food but tonight salmon no flavor profile  lime sauce came sour cream lime juice diced tomatoes  teaspoon dollop sauce salmon four diced tomato pieces really could called garnish because didn't add anything dish  photos salmon gallery showed colorful crisp looking green yellow squash carrots  must run carrots tonight  vegetables over cooked limp no flavor either  accompanied guests enjoyed prime rib baked potatoes    tried Father's Day but really doubt draw back drive all way NW  <EOR> Had dinner last night   Second time 2 months   Food reasonably priced far prime rib goes   love spinach salad bread always fresh warm   Service top notch prompt   prime rib little overcooked medium but still tender juicy   Fresh horseradish clear your sinuses real quick!  definitely back  <EOR> I give guys 5 stars  primarily serve thing Prime Rib  always excellent service always nail everybody's order temperature  med rare never over cooked  <EOR> Great Meri staff great   Yes cowboy bone cut big   lot seasoning but very clean tasting   Very very tender   Can wrong here   Try it  The$20 bottle wine way go  <EOR> I ate couple weeks ago tell best prime rib ever meat cut butter simply delicious   pea soup awesome even wife hates peas thought really good  baked potato good too  But main story prime rib simply exquisite  Cooked perfection!
