My friend dinner Primrose before Cher's show Park Theater  friend rule Never restaurant hasn't open long because they're still working kinks  might case night  But evening off wrong foot right away when tried seat right kitchen heavy traffic going past constantly  Someone please tell why restaurants always two women having dinner together  Please because happened all life  Hello restaurant people 2017! Women tip much more men do! big jobs too! We're paying customers too! ask different table  hostess suggested eating living room area which seemed good idea because quiet quite lovely room though mainly used lounge  But hostess said could dinner menu agreed  where met kinks  If you're going serve dinner room then ready prepare table dinner  ask *everything*   napkins silverware salt pepper sugar tea  Nothing dinner setup course but no brought until asked then weren't very quick it  reservation two hours before show time wouldn't rush but spent much time waiting everything actually became concerned getting theater time   I ordered rotisserie chicken friend ratatouille  both give food two stars five  chicken dry burned some spots frankly much better rotisserie chicken Sprouts   Framing chicken big clump burned but still hard cauliflower side big clump burned but still hard broccoli other  rest vegetables potatoes onions meh  friend's ratatouille well presented but she ate she said things really weird  never ratatouille before and wasn't positive comment   She also asked bread sourdough three big burned slices arrived something white part looked burns but apparently olive oil poured it  looked very unappetizing  She ask butter  All all very disappointing meal  Couple service screamed don't care! all evening pretty sure neither going back there  When say attitude seemed don't care because whenever asked something shouldn't ask staff barely acknowledged business taking far more time should bring should brought right away seated   If still think you'd try Primrose wait while until act together  ladies if try seat kitchen ask them why want put there  wish had  <EOR> Had amazing time here!
