We ordered oysters menudo camarones la diabla some kind fish filet  Taste wise ranged gross eh   The service however good  We weren't ignored ever giving them second star   I'll probably never back though  <EOR> El Patron truly hidden gem somewhat seedy strip mall  outside looks typical Americanized Mexican joint circa 1979 however upon entry transported Mexican oasis    We couple hours kill before boarding plane come home plopped ourselves table decided give menu try  first glance impressed all offerings spanned way beyond typical and boring burritos enchiladas    We noshed prepared tableside guacamole ceviche appetizer platter nopales homemade flour tortillas arrived table warm cup complimentary soup    And top off enjoyed meal sounds pretty decent live musician playing everything Beatles ballads Spanish REM tunes English    El Patron lesson judging book its cover  <EOR> We Mexican food fanatics place impressed us   Granted gringos go but combined 90 something years planet eaten sh**load Mexican   Ordered combo appetizer platter everything great  Especially enjoyed quesadilla authentic Mexican cheese sorry forgot called oozing forth homemade tortilla blanket   Great margaritas $6 50 each   each ordered combo plate main meal     Chili relleno fabulous chili overcooked beef enchilada chock full shredded beef chorizo taco quite well balanced spicy meat cooling lettuce chopped tomatoes   House guac above average but El Sombrero Main St  still best ever tasted  husband's combo carnitas burrito cheese enchilada chicken taco excellent too     Service prompt friendly  Highly recommended restaurant pass homemade tortillas   choice flour corn but asked little both happily accommodated us   Oh yes     FYI also those roving mariachi duos if you'd serenaded while dine  <EOR> I cruising down Las Vegas Blvd looking place watch football games   Passed billboard restaurant LV Blvd   Searched yelp sports bars which lead off strip into scary land   All the sports bars visited horrific say least  Just when give football coincidentally drive restaurant   staff kind enough seat closed section near bar could watch game   enjoyed salsa hot re fried beans chips   having Sunday brunch buffet which delicious!  Didn't seafood because starving didn't want wait   would definitely visit again  <EOR> This place interesting   ambience upscale but owner obviously tries cover all bases making some really down home dishes   nopales salad white cheese enough bring back all itself   only problem place guess looking place where locals some hole in the wall rice and bean joint clearly isn't it   I'd definitely back though  <EOR> This place bomb!
