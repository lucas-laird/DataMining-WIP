The calamari quite nice   came half tempura squid half tempura veggies   If forgive veggies don't mind eating little healthier would recommend dish   batter very very light perhaps lightest but enough flavor keep interesting   use typical Thai style sweet sour sauce clear pinkish red color sweet light tasting chili flakes     The Ga Pow very unique surprising   haven't dish prepared style before   waitress informed more Southern style Thai restaurant   meat very lean finely minced   first thought hamburger look but definitely mistaken when tasted it   very light almost fluffy   No feeling extra grease fat   veggies onions bell peppers etc well prepared fresh tasting   top jasmine rice very light version dish   thing note place quite bit hotter most Thai restaurants   waitress warned 3 5 VERY hot   spice level did disappoint quite enjoyed heat level balanced lighter flavors   dish sweet all which deviates typical version dish find Vegas   Very light palate stomach   criticism might also wasn't very complex no very little basil mint etc but simple flavors worked very well     I am very curious style Thai cooking   most certainly back try some other dishes curries noodle dishes   motto no sweetness Thai restaurant   Sakina fantastic unique addition Thai food scene Las Vegas opinion must try Thai food lovers! <EOR> This authentic gets!!
