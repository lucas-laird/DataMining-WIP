I love Subway don't think knock against Subway sandwiches knock against Subway   used eat Subway 3 times week since moved Southern Highlands really only Subway near don't bother very often     I never once gone into store gotten wanted   Every single time cheese favorite drink bread green peppers whatever want    asked why always run things half time am sure because store run teenagers don't care   Twice past 3 times wait someone find tops drinks   can't drive home without one   such surprise fill supplies?  Why should stand 10 minutes while search store see if any?    One night told no cheese   not because store didn't any but because the other shift didn't fill trays cheese job  suspect case all products   walked night   6 people fulfill orders guess what?  all wanted cheese    runs diet coke?  Raspberry drink?  Minute maid lemonade?   all once?  Heavens folks!  All sell drinks sandwiches sure things sell!    Well job job   sure hope owner place sees review   store poorest run Subway ever seen   cannot leave business hands job teenagers     If happened once   ok   twice   not great   but 6 6 times past 6 months   never walked store happy   Luckily supermarket next door guess what?  carry food too!  Update 6 23 12   batting 1000   Once again unable sandwich because didn't ingredients   excuse    we busy take while more   Worse told aforementioned whiny complaint if say    what want?  Food?
