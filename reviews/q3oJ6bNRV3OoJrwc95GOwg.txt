However only thing  keeping giving place 5 star found hair chili fries  type person big deal hair food  would usually just pick eat part food hair touched  But time wasn't just strand hair  two three long strands  mixed chili   just couldn't  honest lost appetite  didn't even bother trying pull because just kind disgusted actually   brought back workers gave full refund meal  Which really nice them really appreciated that  While standing waiting worker needed boyfriend overheard manager I'd assume she manager talking cashier lady she needed talk this  made wonder if hair issue happens often here  I'd suggest management place workers wear hairnet order prevent issue occurring again  <EOR> Elotes! Awesome dogs garlic fries horchata churro ice cream! Excellent service! Originally Los Angeles place LA vibe complete South LA music little Snoop Dog Tupac Cube  several types buns choose your dog along different toppings  toasted pretzel bun  share fries hot dogs big! corn came cup or traditional cob mixture butter spices cheese  Very delicious! back!

Very laid back atmosphere very family friendly  always bring people when town visitors always crowd pleaser  <EOR> I come corn! hard come street style corn various sides town dirt dog does job  times always late night many people usually only two people working  No complaints besides maybe twice didn't wanted order likely because late  place nice inside bar stools wall paper  good display! <EOR> Really good advise try everything   only down fal don't enough space amount people there   <EOR> From experience Dirt Dog feels trying modern restaurant coped Los Angeles dirty dog hot dog stand  Although caters theme playing music roots LA incorporating art found City Angels dog does hit note true inner city street dog  Granted actual hot dog tasted fine my dog cold wife's not fries spectacular would say could come back try some more  <EOR> Apart reallllllly long wait am huge fanatic  Dirt Dog  hip simple inventive selections ranging vegetarian hotdogs corn cob  smitten first visit choose different styles hotdogs  knew such simple entree rather complex?   For dinner torn between brown dog green dog which gives reason return future  opted Brown Dog which teriyaki sauce sesame seed aioli  just everyday week please? hotdog tasted juicy noting flavors sweet salty  combination between two really hit off finished caramelized onions    I also Dirty Corn which consisted dirty crema cotija cheese chili powder cilantro bacon bits  4 5  think could've made just tad better but didn't exactly wow me  corn perfectly cooked but ingredients didn't seem mixed well together  Something definitely missing there  Perhaps flare heat?   My girlfriend also Dirty Chili Fries which bad! bit salty side but wouldn't mind getting again    As dessert offered anything wanted menu due long wait  chose Horchata Ice Cream  Delicious say least if choice wouldn't share  Sorry girlfriend!   The long service sort puts off visiting again  food delicious but when you're ready grub there's no way willing wait much did first time around  <EOR> Update another time try elite dog elite fries  Both really good  service bit slow since busy but food wasn't salty first time  still yet try any desserts run ones ask for    Was craving mexican corn day found place something similar  service good place really nice inside  Haven't dined yet but liked menu wall when walk in    For gourmet dogs prices fair  house dog corn  corn bit salty side taste  hot dog pretty good though    Next time would try desserts since looked yummy! <EOR>
