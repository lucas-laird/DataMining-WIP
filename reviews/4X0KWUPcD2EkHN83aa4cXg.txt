Just typical sports bar lots TVs greasy bar food BUT beer pong tables back  bar supplies cups balls pitchers etc which relatively cheap  Since O'Shea's gone RIP probably become day time hang when pool party season over  <EOR> Another took dive  ate Bondies many years ago  can't remember far back  food exceptional  Granted bar food but bar food atmosphere nice  tickets show V Theater Groupon came Blondies  perfect  Eat then walk few steps show  seated immediately  waitress gave pretty piss poor service  extravagant people  don't need kiss ass because you're serving food  just ask refill water food when ready  waitress bottom barrel  took forever order   after walking past telling she'd right us  She then explained busy short staffed  human it  No worries  However she off doing god knows see guy t shirt a bartender dishwasher don't know he is  But he kept running all food  Um ok  She's just walking around she's nothing better do  Also pretty liberal  don't care if tats over your damn eye lashes BUT sometimes wear does well your art  She covered really bad faded tats wearing cheerleading costume  hostess gabbing two friends came applications  She would gab them  seat someone then back dishing great job is  UGH  Unprofessional  But food good when finally it  Nice girl but slow service  Overall groupon comp desperation would bring back  But hopefully none likely    I never alcohol can't speak happy hour specials  <EOR> I think lot people going Blondie's wrong reasons  thing gotta walk into place knowing you're getting yourself into  Blondie's basically Hooters hosts beer pong games  Forget food forget anything else but beer you'll okay  Am saying poor service prick bartenders? Nope  But just making point   I last night pretty damn late group guys a majority whom Marines   play beer pong pretty much did  beer pong tables pretty packed everyone around having good time  pretty loud fun all people around nice tossing back balls joking just having good time   4th July weekend all doing Americans do    drinking beer yelling much love America   Would way eat here? No  Would back if weren't bunch Marines playing beer pong? No  But fun time is  <EOR> Been twice two different occasions  Very laidback  Convenient location inside PH  Quick drinks nothing fancy  Fun place group people play beer pong flip cup  entire back bar set just that  But careful pretty rowdy during peak times beer pong gets pretty competitive  <EOR> Went Blondies 12 28 watch Lions Packers while visiting Vegas  Bad decision  Food way over priced service bad beer prices $$$!

Seriously need food better because would easy just drink when food sucks   needs more drunks Vegas? <EOR> If you're Las Vegas stop Blondies   place always packed fun group people   Everyone gets really into games which playing all over because tv screens everywhere     If stop CHECK IN!  free drink if check Yelp   also ton really great mixed drinks   Even if aren't sports fan you'll place   menu lot variety easy find something you'll like  I hard hard time picking meal because many great looking options    Also especially downtown Las Vegas really reasonable prices     Overall food great drinks even better atmosphere fun location on Strip perfect  <EOR> This worst place ever! better food certainly far way better service elsewhere  waited over 30 minutes order taken then mixed up! I'd recommend spend your money elsewhere! <EOR> A poor excuse sports bar  Granted ate purely able dine al fresco or much while casino but beer selection abysmal meal wasn't really even bar food standards  tomato soup tastes came spinach salad unidentifiable ingredients  Plus all over priced   Also FYI waitresses when customer order san appetizer should come BEFORE rest meal  <EOR> This place pretty awesome don't know why there's many haters there  Food priced very reasonably particularly being strip  Servers super friendly no attitude  all sports channels you'd want  Check disappointed! <EOR> Stopped Thursday afternoon watch NCAA first round couple beers  waitress recommended big 24 oz drafts $15 ea but wasn't really knowledgeable price 12 oz versions  ended having 4 Golden Road Brown Ales god stuff though retrospect $60 seems little steep  I'd remembered being Blondies before thinking beer prices bargain must happy hour  order dozen wings $18 nothing special size texture flavor  3 sliders $13 while small pretty tasty  tough finding any place strip  bargain anymore paid $119 w tip 4 beers dozen wings order sliders  Sports Bar persepective 9 TVs visibile where sat but 5 same game on  asked changing channel but waitress must spaced off  probably would happier hitting Buffalo Wild Wings bypassed block earlier Blondies  <EOR> We rush grab dinner before show stopped Blondie's because no wait fit budget  most beers probably thanks being New Year's week   group six none overly impressed food  turkey wrap okay best pizza disgusting   Service slow almost dismissive despite fact weren't overly busy   There very loud group taking entire back half restaurant  all people totally understand others wanting good time but guys came over insisted starting conversation group girls a k a  making poor attempt hit us disturbed end below average meal also way trying pay checks  would more pleasant experience eating fast food  Perhaps if wanted just stop cheap light beer beer pong ugh would enjoyed ourselves more  <EOR> Gotta agree others service sucks! Although did provide water food  Good thing cause needed choke down gross turkey bacon avocado wrap ordered  free appetizers even worse didn't even bother put plates people just eating hands  seems bar thinks cool but not  <EOR> 0 stars would Blondies   place horrible   waitress bitch even when complained manager manager simply brought over free shots try appease us  For those don't already know  free shots Vegas means don't even alcohol them  finally walked appetizer when found won't even serve iced water   try pay bottled water telling non profit charity  pretty sure should illegal bars serve water when located middle Mohave desert  <EOR> A great place good grille food   Sit patio peoplewatch   service good   group 10 staff very accommodating  <EOR> Yeah don't here  Every time Vegas pass place some point think place looks fun  not  food mediocre overpriced  service bleh  mean might better service if you're guy  place dated  felt horrible cheap tinder date gone wrong  all great offering Vegas why would here? Please love Vegas God's elsewhere  <EOR> Awful service    waitresses feel need beg service  Save yourself trouble    unless you're 21 year old flirty male heat   then might better treatment  <EOR> Blondies number stop Vegas! Tons TVs drink specials suit everyone's needs  mention coming mainly see fabulous Chelsea Maidman she worked years always taken care always great mood  <EOR> Watched UFC fight few days ago great bartender fun atmosphere good food reasonable prices  definitely back  <EOR> So came first time ever came Vegas must admit rather enjoyed ALOT ! husband became fan he loved Buffalo wings did beer pretty cheap food pretty good but service terrible takes 10 15 mins just them your drink order food order maybe just maybe if your lucky you'll your order 30 mins less  food great service great  review ENJOY ! <EOR> Only reason even giving 2 stars because food decent   Service much  when pay tell minimum 25 dollars if your using multiple credit cards when little fact clearly stated ANYWHERE  She tried say charges house if under 25 dollars  management completely stupid owners penny pincher way never happen before def won't back again  <EOR> Unfortunately never back eat again   food good but SERVICE management horrible   party 3 2 adults teen middle afternoon bill $75+ dollars   20% gratuity   server never came back table once!  Once received food never refills drink nor did condiments asked for     So opinion servers add gratuity discretion because know service poor   Gratuity guarantee them decide     Never again! <EOR> My husband liked place  would definitely return  Fast friendly service  Some patrons little loud but sports bar  nice spot bring large group people watch games TV  Food really good well prepared  Nicely located inside Miracle Mile shops  <EOR> Went late night some food  much say place  pretty empty Sunday night probably because nestled deep Miracle Mile Shops Planet Hollywood mostly closed late  ordered Mozzarella sticks each wrap drink  Mozz sticks good wraps fine but both pretty expensive  bill almost $70 which felt bit excessive amount food got  wraps did even come fries  sure place more fun more people when more bar late night restaurant  just experience   The waitresses wear Cheerleader uniforms pretty attentive though bartender slow drinks  <EOR> Ate Blondies Friday Vegas trip  server nice but wasn't very attentive  others noted no free tap water but did give first round bottled waters free  gave 3 bottles 5 people  Food mediocre bar food best worth anything near price paid it!  They everything but pepper  table wanted ask pepper but waitress kitchen talking  surprised when check 20% gratuity included  left thought fair considering service received 15% waitress followed outside let know short changed her  When informed didn't think she deserved amount she told called tip mandatory! ended just walking away   My least favorite part 2 hours later when stomach problems started 4 5 us  All 4 ate hot wings which probably best part meal ended stomach issues rest trip!  I don't think ever eat again! <EOR> I don't usually write many reviews but terrible experience quite compelled   So Blondies Las Vegas first time last Saturday night   seemed off night because only handful other people besides fiance other couple   see why weren't many people Saturday night NOW   The expensive food didn't bother kind expected when Strip   fact only bottled water as far water goes charged didn't bother because don't tap water anyhow   What bothered encounter bleach blonde curly 'fro ish haired Irish so he mentioned bartender   He quite d  che bag    So group seated served drinks food all going well until bartender started shift cranked terrible music  Now understand public establishment always going hear music choice  But he turned music REALLY LOUD  louder club loud  When all having trouble hearing each other waitress waitress mentioned he always does she hated because she couldn't speak guests  music pounding all heads killing buzz  If wanted dance club I'd but wanted eat d^mn restaurant  decided speak bartender himself   I asked if he could please turn down because couldn't hear anyone just loud  suprise he told could food sit OUTSIDE where no speakers  really pissed off but maintained composure   told weren't going move tables asked again if he could just turn down he copped childish attitude turned music all way down  told Look don't turn music off  being unreasonable just wanted turn down little  continued bicker he turned music back back table asked check couldn't fast enough  fiance hold back more words bartender way out  PISSED  never treated badly restaurant before consider myself very reasonable polite  Don't eat unless d  che bag gone  Maybe then won't hell  <EOR> One worst experiences ever bar  Usually people bar socialise fun happy   Wellll just done show near bar walked right some drinks chat bit before leaving   Christina front helped well super sweet   HOWEVERRRR let tell rudest most unprofessional bartender very ugly mean attitude  walk bar girl according Christine name Daniela kindly asked much would drinks if drink menu response 5 dollars shots 7 dollars drinks but problem tone loud shouting   Very extremely rude  obviously did order anything asked hostess bartenders name was  told hostess Christine also leaving sat fountain decide Where heading   bartender comes storming yelling AGAIN!!!

Bartenders less friendly probably because aren't making any tips during all drink beer nights   crappy attitude what's point?    It's bit pain won't even let eat watch games television without paying $10 front   part sucks alone   wear those bracelets anyway saying paid all drink why let other people eat?
