Ivan BEST looking forward enjoy another lovely evening  <EOR> Alder Birch replaced Canal Street restaurant used liked lot   If knew Canal Street when see A B you'll notice big change   Alder Birch bright modern when compared darker river themed wall Canal Street   decided give Alder Birch try   I made reservation just minute before   taken table could seat three people two seats being booth seating   sat chair   given menu server soon appeared   name Brandy she excellent!!  I ordered tomato bisque soup signature 14 ounce A B porterhouse ordered blue fries side later strawberry shortcake dessert     I quickly brought iced tea some bread   nice selection sliced bread some lavash focaccia square   Along bread round dish soft butter another dish large salt crystals those salted butter   focaccia hands down best bread service   The tomato bisque soup very good served extremely hot which good!  took time soup enjoyed focaccia   Next came porterhouse along blue cheese topping ordered charge $4   fries placed table explained ketchup jalapeño flavored if wanted regular ketchup just needed ask   being ketchup fan tried two fries unimpressed   didn't taste jalapeño zing expected just ketchup   enjoyed rest fries without dipping   steak done way Maytag blue cheese topping very good   large pearl onion grilled served steak   meat near bone came right off   If wouldn't messy would gnawed little bit left cleaned bone   Brandy brought dessert menu   Some desserts somewhat standard strawberry shortcake   Brandy explained wasn't cake all but white chocolate bread   didn't matter  i wanted try something different was   strawberry shortcake consists two slices Bon white chocolate bread grilled served strawberries vanilla bean ice cream   partial rose petal done thin chocolate accompanying dish   Bon Breads white chocolate home changed grilling changes bread but little chocolate flavor bread   good grill flavor but dessert essentially grilled toast strawberries ice cream   Good but just OK   Some things Alder Birch   modern decor but lighting could turned down some   bright no rheostat darken dining area give more intimate atmosphere   modern wood glass light   don't want dark need iPhone read menu but I'd rather way was   My server Brandy excellent!  She always replace iced tea answer questions see if needed anything   people working just good   The dinner good A OK Yelp says three stars   don't think wowed enough bring back especially lighting  <EOR> I'm foodie eaten some best restaurants world  If would given place 5 stars  Because husband looking tapas more heavy dinner ordered appetizers sides instead entrees    braised short rib appetizer die for!  Order if you're even slightly inclined  served mushroom caps which equally delicious  Though better elsewhere crab cakes also worth ordering carpaccio though did use lemon crab cakes add touch acid dish needed  mashed potato blue cheese scalloped potatoes would definitely order again   Brussels sprout side while happily generous pecans savory onions lacking both acid salt   Kobe meatballs meh gravy heavy when could bright meatballs dry side   Overall highly recommend meal if find yourself near Orleans  <EOR> The food incredible worth every dime  Great service  didn't give 5 start because AC busted horrible hot there! Oh but sides! all crazy good! <EOR> Are sure Orleans?! years since stepped foot casino  absence all cool me   am generally fan casino dining which greatly limits little foodie's options  Most places understand many people prefer more subdued atmosphere dinner  Alder Birch right   When walk into Alder Birch doors close behind sealing off stench noise casino    We drinks foyer where people watch behind your glass wall  Very entertaining  seated promptly reservation time placed capable hands Ivan  Start finish service fantastic  Everything delicious  Standouts beef carpaccio appetizer lettuce wedge salad amazing crispy creamed corn  Steaks great also   craft cocktails amazing! Well worth trip Orleans! <EOR> Ate other night first time since remodel rename   not impressed  Definitly old Canal Street lot better  Service efficient but little cold prices reasonable type restaurant ambiance bright loud instead warm cozy  Food enjoyed all scallops roast beef salmon ahi tuna salads bone marrow way expensive $12   STAY often but probably frequent Prime Rib Loft instead  Just old steakhouse enjoyed many years  <EOR> First let start saying love steak when invited eat very excited   restaurant itself upscale decor very similar Hanks Green Valley Ranch   greeted then shown private dining room which really anything fancy except giant tv end it   ordered every appetizer menu excluding ocean treasures oysters   braised spare ribs looked horrible tasted looked!  shrimp however delicious   Kobe meatballs weren't anything special but better spare ribs    For those children no children's menu small portion section   ordered Bone rib eye 22 oz shared 3 children   French fries Pontus frites hit kids   creamed corn mediocre definitely Lawreys mashed potatoes lobster Mac good   servers acted didn't want bothered filling drinks even bringing more hot apps   much VIP treatment  <EOR> We stopped place drinks seeing great pictures reviews    First let say drinks New York Sour Old Fashioned very well done  alone deserve four stars!  What didn't website said New York Sour made Four Roses Bourbon but bartender Brandon is was certain only use Makers Mark  why just honest website?? all there's big difference between Four Roses Makers Mark   way really good drinks! <EOR> As longtime local non gambler sometimes difficult convince give places second chance because many options city but Alder Birch completely altered opinion offerings Orleans! friend tried restaurant last year raved tennis team sister in law's birthday decided give shot  thrilled did!  The chic interior welcome break glittering lights frantic noise casino  Although table already prepared when arrived early took few minutes check bar wait rest party  bartender Brandon better even your best idea bartender should be  He charming engaging asked questions effort craft cocktails each would enjoy  He even managed create something friend hates taste alcohol which thought could impossible task! When ready he helped escort table introduced server Alex runner Javier  Alex attentive without hovering gave excellent recommendations  Plus would clone Javier if could  He sweetly hilarious gracious always nearby when needed anything   and needed lot things over course couple hours!  When finished but weren't quite ready end evening Brandon recommended check Bailiwick's live music billiards which also great also significantly cooler anything else remember  If Orleans keeps coming such interesting diversions just stop more often! <EOR> The great experience starts when walk door   hostess friendly ordered happy hour drinks before getting seated   placed lovely booth because reservations Rick waiter  Rick deserves 6 stars excellent service bartender Brandon does well   food beverages super since local come back soon! <EOR> It ambience service food quality high end Steakhouse yet little more reasonably priced when compared similar places strip  steaks very good I ribeye dinning partner Waygu sirloin   sides also great I really liked pommes frites truffle sea salt   if want good high end steakhouse but pay steep prices strip then think really enjoy resturuant  <EOR> We sad replacement Canal Street Restaurant Orleans     Until    tried replacement   beautiful upscale food simply divine   savored every bite talked days   Every item ordered made perfection   No complaints only praises restaurant  <EOR> Great upscale dinner restaurant super service Alex Catherine  Loved various sides such grilled creamed corn asparagus blue cheese scalloped potatoes  steak chicken entrees tasty! <EOR> Had Fabulous meal evening  Celebrating 10 years significant other  Stopped romantic candle lit dinner la carte  Brandi server bar none extremely point  Very prompt service skills attended satisfaction guaranteed  I'd recommend Alder Birch anyone looking ways celebrate your special occasion  <EOR> We stayed 2 nights Orleans recent trip Los Wages decided try Alder Brich   I recently app Open Table made reservations week before leaving  The app worked   app noob yeah take if lol Walking must say really impressed   decor really cool!
