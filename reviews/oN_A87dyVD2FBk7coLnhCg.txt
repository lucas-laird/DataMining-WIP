Its located gas station  other people said food express surprisingly favorite Mexican places town  biggest let down would say just fact there's only guy doing cooking making delivery food EXTREMELY slow    However once past slow service sticky tables seats odd location food actually quite good!  The carne asada fries packed full everything! Meat cheese sour cream guacamole    name it  ingredients typical but guess balance much made magical  stingy here  shared fries three friends still managed somewhat full  Imagine would if ate all alone!  As watched man knew everything served fresh hot off pan  just wish another cook wait wouldn't 30 minutes    I also ordered horchata recommended friends frequents place  blast cinnamon literally made feel early taste Christmas  <EOR> This place definitely won everyone's business top quality Mexican fast food  probably end saying most fellow yelpers already said cut chase! ordered chicken burrito rice beans bell peppers tomatoes   Pros food quality lot better other places area  chicken juicy just right amount salt  put grilled peppers tomatoes burritos menu simple point  Portion sizes big enough full  offer traditional aguas frescas fruit juices English  pineapple hibiscus flower horchata  also offer Jarritos which flavored soda  many places offer definitely one     Cons Wait time  came 3 30 didn't order taken until 4 00  Understaffed  Only person taking orders cooking  Cash only  gas station ATM charges $2 30 gas station only give 10$ cash back  50 cent charge    So aren't many bad things could say place because overall taste food lot better other places area  Unfortunately since took long order taken give place 4 stars  Props cook he really works hard everything done  <EOR> Awesome food   sure if guy all time owner but he works ass off   Great food gas station possible <EOR> I agree last review  Best Authentic Mexican food town  eaten ton Mexican Food places town wouldn't expect such great place gas station but delicious!
