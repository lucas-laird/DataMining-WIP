What concept   Everyone loves bacon why bar bacon themed?     My husband once before few years ago but night drinking karaoke Monday night decided pop Bloody Mary Tuesday morning    This bar huge   looks might separate restaurant side?  But sure that   sat towards back wall near restrooms     Service polite   didn't bartender's name but she nice   She gave recommendations did disappoint checked frequently     The drinks great   Garnished huge piece bacon each bacon bloody mine vodka gin sounds weird but amazing Prices little high here   Drinks $8 50 $9 each   wasn't really anything menu less $8 didn't try any food yet    I want come back when little more money spend   want try mantini also man candy among other things  <EOR> The food fantastic Kristina server wonderful   enough man candy lunch tomorrow   come try bacon   Next time trying B B  white garlic sauce three different bacons     yep 3 different bacons lemon dressed arugula roma tomatos fresh basil  <EOR> I feel pretty fair person when comes judging restaurants  know wait times unrealistic certain items menu may unavailable  worked restaurant before feel people incredibly harsh those work food service  being said experience terrible bacon bar last week  only reason didn't leave because good company people eat  Despite being VERY slow Friday multiple problems evening  First when sat down waitress very kind told she didn't recommend signature bacon bloody mary which wanted because bartenders made ten past hour over it  Um  Im sorry  What? YOUR SIGNATURE DRINK  known most popular items menu  won't us? Because you're tired? Shame bartenders also waitress making feel guilty wanting something actually MENU  Someone group particularly upset demanded drinks which likely ended having spit them something if they're really pissy mixing some tomato juice alcohol lol Furthermore appetizer order came wrong never correct order some entrees took over half hour like BLT come on cold upon arriving top off boyfriend food poisoning night probably because temperatures food sat long   checks split incorrectly none food particularly exceptional  fact BLT more lettuce bacon  BACON BAR?!
