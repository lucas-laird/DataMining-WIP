I pull into drive thru Wednesday May 3 around 9 AM only car drive thru  sit ordering spot probably couple minutes don't hello moment please nothing  say Hello?   Someone replies right you  wait probably 5 min before decide just drive away could because nobody front someone finally takes order    I ordered chorizo breakfast burrito  Simple no special requests just wanted good breakfast burrito    I pull window pay then wait wait wait  Nobody should drive thru longer 5 min especially when only it! Overall probably waited 15 20 minutes breakfast burrito  Also didn't put any salsa bag didn't offer any either  burrito $5  terrible price burrito    But now let review burrito  burrito decent size comparable other similar Mexican food places    The burrito came hot temperature wise  plus  least seemed made order  burrito supposed come with eggs cheese cheddar mozzarella potatoes chorizo  could also order bacon ham  only part burrito good tortilla    The eggs way over cooked potatoes bland didn't put any cheese it  least if did couldn't tell  two types cheese would think would visible could taste it    Let's talk chorizo  chorizo good chorizo  When think chorizo think those rich flavorful Mexican spices all packed into delicious ground sausage  It's supposed red color   chorizo bland would consider chorizo    Overall burrito good  dry almost chore keep eating it  didn't finish usually finish food  big guy  finish burrito  just questioned myself why still eating when bad?  But am man gives second chances probably back try something else  Maybe taco  If your restaurant name food better dang good making food  Right?
