Always fresh darn addicting garlic version standout    Tandoori  Have tried both chicken shrimp  far favorite shrimp  always preferred shrimp tandoori anyway because nothing more visually appetizing large juicy shrimp fresh onions lemons sitting atop sizzling hot plate  Those sexy soft hissing popping noises every time     Matter Paneer  Well better IMO but wasn't bad  think forward tomato searching more creamy notes  Which silly when think paneer should somehow enough maybe touch more cream would better? don't know    Malai kofta  Sauce 10! Dumplings 0! Way dense when shaped into round balls instead those football shaped things  totally just whining shape shouldn't matter but shape coupled dense just didn't me  But sauce though! cashew based sauces amazing    Gulab Jamun Again another dense item but don't hold against them  experienced same dense issue other restaurants regarding dessert  Maybe cooked sitting long? sure   Mango lassi Dare say made canned mango? hope wrong but pretty sure wasn't fresh mango  Still tasty nonetheless especially alcoholic version    All all place excellent  Great dishes full flavor wonderful attentive service  can't really ask more! <EOR> Pathetic Food Quality Overpriced food server didn't provide any plasticware  either  <EOR> Very clean   Friendly staff   Food tastes great   All 9 99   We'll back over over again   Dont forget try garlic naan  <EOR> This review lunch buffet only  came place several times return every time bored bland everyday food need spicy flavors kind kick jolts culinary boredom  effect specially recommend Chicken Makhani Malai Kofta usually don't care much meat just sauce dip Biryani garlic bread then frantically reach ice cold Coke keep close   seasoned rice also great  Warm atmosphere friendly service overall very good experience  <EOR> This buffet very average  some items liked some didn't but nothing wowed me    The sitting area large hold good volume people  staff nice but little disorganized  let couple people know before actually naan  ambiance very casual nice lunch place   In appetizers Tandoori Chicken cold outside sitting long only tasted okay  Shish Kabob tasty but kinds could keep eating  couple pieces done  Samosa would rave about  Though filling little much peas taste really yummy  most samosas favorite part little end where no filling dough crunchy samosa all dough tasted edge piece  Simply wonderful!  One really good thing place deliver fresh naan your table  Other buffets naan cut part buffet but when isn't high turn around know those naans sitting while  case place offered plain butter but asked garlic obliged  did take little while naan actually come ordered but more made wait quality    The main dishes where most disappointed buffet  Chicken Makhani pretty good  good layers flavor  Unfortunately tray seemed chicken pieces very small picked through other guests  Chicken Curry no flavor only ate little  couple vegetarian options which good see vegetarian folk there  fan brinjal didn't try but did try Chana Masala which decent although favorite  All all nothing super exciting terms main dishes   For desert tried both Gulab Jamun Kheer  Kheer wasn't sweet enough taste  Gulab Jamun other hand pretty spot on  nice warm too!  Overall buffet did hold its reputation but good value amount food price pay  <EOR> Is just curry more potent Thanksgiving turkey? feel need drift off into deep slumber every time some Indian food!  But don't care  worth it   I've only eaten lunch buffet $11 cheaper most Indian buffets believe enjoyed every time  Choose between garlic butter just plain naan  Can't wrong either  Very flavorful dishes vegetarian options  Only wish more!
