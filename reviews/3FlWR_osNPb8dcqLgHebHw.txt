obviously need lava common sense manager focused cleanliness  starters more half restaurant being utilized every being crowded into little area  4+ servers every employee panic rush mode  pace atmosphere rush unwelcomed   They need slow down clean restaurant tables properly  Nothing clean  request bus boy come re clean booth because pancake syrup smeared all over probably small child seated before us  put request should never made guest first place   The bathrooms filthy smelled dive bar  no point belaboring lack cleanliness establishment  also no excuse poor quality environment attention details   This place should shut down until find organized management staff    The food quality ok best  home style corned beef hash promoted server clearly very cheap version shouldn't

attitude right start never checked back refill wife's glass just see if needed anything made mistake bill applying coupon code even though gave right away  <EOR> Meh just sums Mimi's breakfast    I've before lunch remember liking it   salad crab cakes cappuccino   Everything good  My boyfriend decided try place breakfast   eggs Benedict   really runny   whites hadn't even set   boyfriend omelet   wasn't bad but wasn't really inspiring either   would better if wasn't quite dry would excusable if price wasn't nearly 10 dollars each dish   When pay much eggs generally expect some kind quality   Same mimosa ordered   $7 glass I'd expect least Korbel   couldn't recognize brand serving although still very enjoyable definitely wasn't anything special      The service wasn't anything write home either   When boyfriend left few minutes waitress ran snatched plate   lot food planning taking home   asked box she one   shook head turned attention back potatoes just realize she snatched ketchup all condiments off table while still eating     I would give Mimi's 2 stars but adding because lunch usually better  <EOR> After waiting 15 minutes waiter acknowledge he took another 15 minutes bring drinks  tried order told old version menu wanted no longer option  Honey asked if he could substitute fries salad told no but he could charge order salad  asked more time he stated fine he'd bring bread basket while waited  15 minutes later finished ordering bread basket  Sadly carrot raisin bread isn't great anymore  baguettes ok  When finally food just ok  steak gristly but butter made that  fries super over cooked  pot roast bland nearly enough sauce  au gratin potatoes green beans made lack flavor meat  never  drinks refilled  wasn't super busy but waiter definitely scatterbrained  Tried giving location another chance but won't back  many other great options area bad service old menus bland food  <EOR> I just keep being impressed restaurant no matter state am in  service always
