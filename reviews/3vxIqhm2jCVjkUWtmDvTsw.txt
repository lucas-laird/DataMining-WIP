Moist flavorful chicken fingers aren't overly battered  Cane's sauce comparable Chick Fil A sauce but pepper added   Texas Toast Yum! And say all drink sweet tea?!?  Definitely stop if your Vegas  <EOR> Yummm! sums experience Raising Cane's  much more really say other then place really good fried chicken  shame none opened California yet but chicken good definitely just matter time    However before rave Raising Cane's feel need respond negative review place certain Elite '11 member Henderson Nevada yelped Raising Cane's really expensive chicken fingers 5 star reviews awarded reviewers mostly Californians deprived food doesn't taste absolutely nothing   Come again? Those darned double negatives baffling   In regards price Raising Cane's flagship combo Box Combo which consists four generously proportioned chicken fingers French fries slice toast side coleslaw side sauce drink costs $6 79  Hardly wallet buster!   Moreover compared KFC' similar combo meal Variety Big Box Meal which consists drumstick chicken strip popcorn chicken two small sides biscuit drink costs $5 99 price difference $0 80 seems hardly expensive let alone really expensive   seriously member probably never Chick fil A where 4 piece chicken strip meal costs $6 49    And audacity imply Californians know food tastes California land no seasoning gross misstatement  Seriously apart Las Vegas area state Nevada nothing but large sandbox its total population 2 7 million being less city Los Angeles 3 8 million   Additionally many restaurants along Las Vegas Strip spin offs branches restaurants started renowned chefs California  Therefore really think Elite '11 status member should revoked    Anyways back Raising Cane's  chicken au natural made premium chicken isn't frozen  fast food restaurant rarity  thing say your chicken 100% chicken but also proclaim your chicken never frozen testament freshness quality food being served  breading spices infused seasoning yelped Southern flavoring  Trust South Alabama Texas Carolinas fast food restaurant close authentic $6 79  literally enjoyed every bite  fact ate ended taking huge ass bite lower lip  Yet despite bleeding swollen lip continued inhale chicken fingers whale pausing only catch breath dip chicken into Cane's special ketchup mayo pepper spice sauce    As coleslaw fries Texas toast okay but honestly didn't give shit because chicken finger lipping good!  In regards drinks Raising Cane's your standard fountain drinks  But real highlight sweet tea which really sweeeeeeeeeeeeet  While sure contains buckets sugar hence its sweetness kind hypocrite would if counting calories fried food restaurant?   So if would enjoy being glutton day hop into Raising Cane's indulge really good fried chicken    definitely sure wash down all yummilicious fried goodness Raising Cane's sweet tea  <EOR> Raising Canes great addition any city  Las Vegas first time seen one   Maybe only LV?  dont know    I used hate place only because knew just served regular ol' chicken fingers   Until actually tried idiot hating something never even tried   Never again   chicken cooked perfection juicy tender crispy!  fries ok doesn't wow just good fingers but does toast!

Well much   honestly mostly tasted floured chicken which know  is    but maybe add some flavor? The fries those crinkled fries tasted ones we'd elementary school bueno  The cane sauce which they're stingy also very good either  Las Vegas   do Popeye's???? <EOR> After seeing all friends' Instagram posts chicken tenders try myself  completely honest saying that    HYPE REAL   Chicken tenders juicy coleslaw refreshing special sauce creamy tangy peppery  Reminded 1000 island but twist  pretty tasty  Texas toast actually favorite part meal    Buttery goodness!  Verdict Overall entire meal alright  lacking some sort wow factor me  think something comparable but possibly even better would Chick fil A  definitely worth trying least once! But other yummy things Vegas crave more  <EOR> Did SEC school? remember Guthrie's?  If fond memories both then Raising Cane's just spot   fries fingers sauce all same only difference being toast more Texas Guthrie's   Also tea lil less sweet sweet tea Auburn Guthrie's which fine actually   Nice clean open space friendly staff definitely coming back! <EOR> Wow lunch really good  chicken well! Differently worth stop very good chicken fries   Looking something quick cheap your place! <EOR> Oh Las Vegas land plentiful Raising Cane's locations! Even though more Cane's locations SoCal now they're still mostly way me  friend Idaho having never Cane's BADLY wanting try knew send it!  Not hungry particular day kept simple Box Combo instead Caniac Combo usually get  Quality would expect typical Cane's location  Definitely extra Cane's sauce! found special order your friends extra crispy  Trust worth because your fries extra fresh!  Service excellent no complaints me  since many Cane's locations Vegas wasn't packed  would NEVER happen SoCal  fair did actively avoid Cane's location closest Strip  decision paid off spades!  Parking incredible easy here  Thank god that   Bottom line if Strip wanted hit Cane's location I'd to  Zero desire try location Tropicana imagine much mess location is  <EOR> Always best place chicken! sauce amazing Texas toast die for! walked 1 9 miles Silverton Hotel this!
