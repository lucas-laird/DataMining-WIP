Then server Brant said he'd bring some hot bread but came back 2 r table 2 say bread oven  finally r bread served 8 30 pm now sitting hour already   isn't bread supposed come soon there?? Now wondering where r food cause waiting 40 min MR Ribeye rare filet?? When ask r server r food he tells there's 2 big parties other side restaurant also computers down earlier backed kitchen   customer   I don't want hear all excuses starving want food cause waiting very long time ! 5 min son i's eyes everyone coming kitchen wondering if  r food coming tell son waiting 5 more min  If r food isn't then leaving   this ridiculous ! food comes within 5 min although food very tasty wasn't hot! steak room temp sitting plate awhile   not just came off grill! only thing hot Au gratin potatoes! I wasn't impressed w r server all    I always look around wait extras asked time received them almost done didn't need now ! The food very tasty delicious   just hot service very slow !
