Food excellent stop your sushi fix on!  Service excellent Ivan!! <EOR> A Very solid sushi experience  Nice variety rolls other traditional dishes menu  Fast polite service  bad considering Vegas  <EOR> I know everyone 'loves' Kaizen but few times 7 8 never really loved it   eastern location better though bc half price sushi but still   sushi high priced dont all eat end spending fortune   few good things jalapeno roll which actually really good but feel place more 'americanized' sushi which hate   love authentic food but place just ok   hate give less spectacular rating but never great meal here   If come late night sushi hit musashi! Its down road paradise way better! happy hour EVERY night 11pm 3am     The service always good but food just ok me  <EOR> When comes food service price point would give Kaizen Fusion Roll five stars far customer services however they'll come rolling 1 lowly star  review average itself 3 stars    Here's situation  friend driving around looking place eat around 4a yelped nearest location  Boom Kaizen popped near UNLV    The food price awesome baked salmon roll  Delicious  Unlike all other all eat places original  He some type calamari roll something else    Adding $11 lychee flavored sake green tea tempura ice cream but don't serve vanilla flavor which didn't really any sense but am I    couldn't more pleased?  Well    let's start beginning    The serve beyond poor  Upon entrance two girls working just most unengaging attitudes missed many marks  ask 3 times same 7UP miscommunication obviously poor service just mentioned   I mean stickler table courtesies but all servers took dishes away served just stuck whole bodies right between both friend based memory server aren't supposed come around side wouldn't just more sense? Anyway odd experience  Given understand 5 30 morning point everyone wants home they're shoving people but place still establishment restaurant clearly strategically placed itself across certain hotel casinos reason but place dead Saturday night obvious reasons     I mean obviously food food great decently priced   Worth if LAST LAST minute late night dinner you're near UNLV campus  <EOR> WORST customer service ever  night paying bill told credit card declined  gave another one  day checked bank account noticed charged BOTH cards  called told wait few days charge first card would disappeared  waited    nothing changed  wanted talk manager but apparently guy NEVER available  called person several times bank statements printed none could solve issue  Eventually spoke manager told send email copy bank accounts statement showing like all time waste? think Im making whole deal 26$? giving free meal PEACE OUT?   did emailed all documents   He NEVER answered back  Called again he restaurant  pissed wasted all time robbed  just unfair  aware treat clients! <EOR> This place amazing food service awesome  Every time come Platform show August dinner here! can't miss Spicy Tuna Salad Avocado Train delicious  last night great time! If stay Hard Rock waking distance! <EOR> It second time here  Really good service good  chicken karaage most since really unique! Slightly breaded but superb juicy! Surely better if order two bottled beers during happy hour  <EOR> Good place especially groups   Pretty solid sushi although strip mall actually prefer since prices reasonable nice low key  <EOR> Mmmm     green chili tempura roll salmon nigiri California roll  Everything delicious!
