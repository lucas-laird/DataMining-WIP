I suggest reservation good table  <EOR> There restaurants then Restaurants   Nobhill just restaurant   Restaurant  capital R   kind place wish could dine regular basis just because would mean more money know morally right but because type sanctuary actually feel though better person   Some people spa relax others lay pool others still might want just soak tub   But take Nobhill all problems melt away   Screw Calgon NOBHILL TAKE AWAY!  One reasons why think Nobhill Restaurant just restaurant because decor   Simply put decor both subtle sophisticated   Swathed modern yet elegent taupes browns very little dining room distract delicious food flawless service   exception few silver toned accents art pieces walls remarkably bare   Some restaurants try hard wth decor doing become obnoxious result extravagance   Nobhill   Restaurant tastefully appointed many ways very un Vegas Vegas restaurant   case less definitely more   Dinner began some wine instructions   brought 2003 Les Forts de Latour the second label Chateau Latour asked them decant advance meal which did without any hesitation callous snobbery   Likewise order also taken without any kind artificial attitude   side note don't care people thought Steven Top Chef Season 1 but people Restaurant which where he works slimeballs   Unlike some high end restaurants server neither pretentious nor obsequious   He neither pushed towards expensive items menu nor discouraged sharing   He fact very welcoming down earth  neither reserved nor shill   Someone already mentioned bread butter won't into details but thought very cool would bake bread right dining room then serve heated slab granite   would then remain warm resting votive box middle table   As case all Michael Mina Restaurants treated amuse bouche start dinner which time little sliver foie gras topped minced Asian pears   both salty sweet creamy crunchy   incredible way begin meal!  For first course shared Dungeness Crab Louis served bed baby hearts romaine avocado   salad light yet creamy all expecting   always thought Crab Louis just crab kind thousand island dressing   But dressing sweet nice little kick spice which paired very nicely glasses Henriot champagne   Our main courses Angus Beef Seared Foie Gras Potato Cakes Pinot Reduction Olive Oil Poached Lamb Loin Goat Cheese Puffs Garbanzo Bean Spring Onion Medley   Both amazing both texture taste   seemingly modest bean onion medley fact good could eaten whole bowl it!  may left some lamb plate but damn if wasn't going eat every last bit veggies!  For dessert shared Tangerine Souffle which topped tangerine vanilla sorbet   Although did anything seemed pair well dessert wine list server made effort find some German eiswein bar which ended being match made heaven!  Both delicious own but together     ahh     Nobhill take away!  As mentioned outset service flawless but swift and efficient yet robotic kind way   server actually very engaging friendly made feel deserved there   turns he grew Orange County throughout meal chatted OC living talked wine we gave glass before left he gave names some people Studio Montage Mozambique Maestro's Ocean Club   He said if mentioned name would something special us   So rolled Nobhill into vacuous din MGM casino could help but feel going miss place   Even though stuffed gills almost did want leave   Why?  Because Restaurant  <EOR> This place wonderful! boyfriend ate before going see David Copperfield   just drinks appetizers dessert but still delicious   Hope back dinner day  <EOR> Nobhill STILL best restaurant Vegas Chef Mina transformed restaurant into parade America's greatest hits seen thru eyes great San Francisco chef     Everyone talked Lobster Pot Pie look great but wildly overpriced   scallops night then back burger another night   Don't forget order sidecar  <EOR> I would give 3 5 stars     The Main Lobster Pot Pie overhyped   There   said *ducking*    If lobster pot pie cost half current market price $85 past weekend then would taste whole lot better   But split pie friend just sad see spread front 3 small chunks lobster lobster tail know paying 40+ portion that   lobster some truffle cream sauce around but wasn't exactly swimming expected   lobster chunks tasted fresh truffle cream sauce good   But crust beautifully golden crust looked promising when pie rolled serving cart   Unfortunately crust flavorless dry once ran truffle cream sauce dip and didn't take long because much begin gulp down water order wash down crust   saying don't order lobster pot pie just don't did expecting rock your palate   If plan split lobster pot pie probably need appetizers fill up  appetizers missed Chilled Cucumber Soup Seared Foie Gras Tomato Fondue especially latter!

Service fantastic  All all great experience $100 per person even bottle wine <EOR> Here's breakdown Hostess Friendly Informative Service Attentive Friendly Halibut Absolutely delightful  Might best had   Salmon fresh  Very unfortunate rest dish great  Ratatouille first experience  delicious  Wine Expensive   but excellent selection   Will back? things happen Vegas stay Vegas? <EOR> 3 5 stars  food good price wise actually quite reasonable  planned prix fixe but since staying MGM Signature actually buy entree free special those stayed which great deal  appetizers group 6 shared Alaskan King Crab appetizer plate filled different cured porks  delicious  main course bacon wrapped scallops which little disappointing lacking flavor lentil stew came with  Same dish husband braised shortrib  very tender but better  I'd again give another chance especially since service great final bill reasonable good time over all  <EOR> Celebrated personal milestone bf long time buddy   He hadn't made San Fran yet visit brought SF him!  decor posh spot did fine city justice    polished wood earthy tones sparkling glass black white photos wall sized piece art jazz atmosphere   reservations but needed moment set table ushered into lounge   barely seated before bartender came over drinks while waited   ordered round received them just hostess conveniently table ready    choreographed perfection   We seated set table    white linen crystal among other equally set vacant tables  immediately brought selection breads which placed heater middle table variety butters   took look wine list realized nothing under buck!  settled half bottle some appetizers classic cheese fondue heirloom salad   fondue perfect but heirlooms disappointment     natural flavor wiped balsamic vinegar cheese   Yet menu looked promising    Michael Mina creations intended capture taste SF   each chose main course North Beach Cioppino Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna Seared Duck Breast   cioppino surprisingly delectable    big chunks crab mussels yummy tomato broth   tuna eh    sauce used compliment dulled fish   duck breast pretty run mill    nothin' yelp about   ordered another half bottle enjoyed quiet

definitely high end if  mind  <EOR> Enticing menu fantastic food beautiful decor sexy atmosphere large portions  Order Lobster pot pie truly experience Chef's brilliance art eating lobster pot pie  However two negative points dining experience   we remind server bring wine main course bathroom situation 1 stall per kind put damper time there  <EOR> We stayed MGM Grand 3nights friend invited dinner Nobhill Tavern which also located hotel  fine dine restaurant intimate set up  food really great served perfect portion huge even small  love sampler manager gave us  Everything just good  But but but    prices cheap all  Better prepare least $100 if bring date here  Haha  twice  <EOR> Ok let start saying only once wish 3 5 star rating   Perhaps if back more they'll earn 4th star   On recent stay Vegas given $50 dining credit spend Fine Dining restaurant MGM Grand   chose restaurant because broadest selection food given choices   From hostess stand outside decor gives appearance Fine Dining but I'd say different parts experience don't say fine dining    book qualify fine dining music should soft background shouldn't notice should just light soundtrack    Music little loud played electric selection   Also fine dining tables should far enough spaced apart talk normal inside voice hear your neighbors conversation also far enough away graceful exit ladies room without bits your body being front people next table  Also long sleeved flannel shirts shouldn't allowed   The waitress serving staff very professional water glass never lower half didn't snooty ignore you attitude  because didn't order alcohol   Menu choices ranged burgers seafood chops which nice something just everyone   To start bring grilled bread grilled actual wood which tasty but only 2 pieces noticed tables next which close can't help but notice going on basket  full   Luckily servers came over right away asked if would more   For entrees kurobuta pork chop which came swiss chard toasted farro salad   dining companion chose bacon wrapped scallops which came sauteed vegetables lentils   eat seafood didn't taste scallops but larger dining companion said delicious   taste vegetables weren't near scallops various shades carrots sauteed butter good   lentils came small iron crock which made easy share unfortunately share worthy   Basic plain meh lentils much other flavor   The pork chop cooked over wood nicely charred outside but juicy inside   first time kurobuta pork while nice juicy can't say flavor any better regular pork   swiss chard braised delicious toasted farro salad really really good   I'd never farro before but based am now big fan   To cap off night delicious silky smooth maple creme brulee which nice maple flavor without being overpowering artificial tasting   On way all servers made point wish good night which thought nice   I'd back again perhaps try other dishes would liked better if weren't packed sardines tables being six inches away each other close enough hold hands person next me   restaurant no where near full time left could spaced more  <EOR> the food service pretty good   the highlight meal lobster pot pie served all clad copper pot     i most looking forward truffled mac cheese   you order al carte also comes fried chicken must order 2    great flavor macaroni wasn't overcooked   but waaay salty as duck breast    server asked if liked mac cheese bc only took few bites   i told thought bit salty   our server immediately apologized said he would mention chef   he seemed sincere did expect anything   when check pleasantly surprised mac cheese taken off     overall solid 3 5 food 4 service atmosphere   if coctails sure order house special cable car   it citrus orange flavored drink served martini glass rims dipped sugar then carmelized the best part garnished orange rind twist <EOR> The first night arrived Las Vegas stopped Nobhill because killer happy hour special great food options  wasn't sure would able eat anything but manager ended coming talking menu giving some suggestions gluten free food items   I decided burger without bun french fries  haven't french fries long because most places cook them same fryer other breaded items which then prevents having some   The burger came really fancy some cole slaw top cheese  pretty fantastic   The french fries little skinny fries which cooked really crispy my favorite kind   could only finish half meal because burger really big enough french fries 2 3 people individual serving   This only restaurant felt funny eating whole trip  did bit stomach ache run restroom night clubs night  didn't ruin night but put little damper mood really made long pajama's some tea while partying  Thinking could cole slaw depending used sauce   I didn't joint pain headache only use restroom time wondering if more lactose issue gluten issue  Likely lactose since problem resolved itself pretty quickly   I'd say indifferent recommending restaurant gluten free option  think few other places MGM offering more knowledge food options Nobhill Tavern  give maybe <EOR> Nob Hill  top notch palate time   Food tasting menu service impeccable but then again learning   Try mixologist inspired cocktails i e  cable car   most memorable thing  <EOR> I Nobhill early dinner before Lady Gaga's concert  Service very nice efficient  Price range more affordable compared other Michael Mina's restaurants Micheal Mina Bellagio American Fish   ordered Seared Foie Greas Maine Lobster Ginger Aioli appetizers  Chef pretty generous portion foie gras  tasted buttery prepared exactly way like  Maine lobster very fresh sweet  Both appetizers tasted great pared German Riesling server recommended  lamb shank ordered entree came huge portion  second thought German Pork Knuckles  now image big is   Lamb shank tender juice  However would more seasoning  Overall great experience would come back more appetizers deserts next time Word street says Michael Mina's Nobhill Tavern next resort replaced La Cave  hope Nobhill could stay long enough till second visit  <EOR> Okay never MM restaurant before but heard quite bit thought we'd give try    1 Lamb Sausage it new menu though thinking idea     say YES! Very good flavor  Since new they're working kinks fact texture kind soft forgiven  But man     Flavor!   2 Truffle Mac Cheese Pretty good     okay really good     put mushrooms guess gives appearance Truffle slices but man aroma dish delicious   3 LPP kinda hesitant ordering many people yelp said hit miss  $85 would expect something really good     honestly was  Taste aroma superb  Quanity     well kinda lacking  definately enough probablly much one just little bit little 2 overall 4 carrot sticks would 6 pieces lobster  2 Claws 4 sections tail  Honestly think LPP would great appetizer side dish 3 people     definitely tastes good but just much very heavy cream sauce cooked in  <EOR> I hate give such fine establishment only 2 stars but service given during visit earned it!  My date mosied Nobhill Tavern 10pm Thursday  asked hostess where could sit happy hour special she pointed bar  When sat down waited almost 10 minutes menu only asking one  Then when gave drink orders bartender briskly told hurry pick food because kitchen closing  chose dishes ordering 4 apps once redeem happy hour special fill tummies  drinks very good very strong made dignity! food was     well tossed salad amazing just served very small portion  beef cheek sliders little decieving small called sliders but rather pieces meat small crackers not bad taste though  fries came huge amount! obvioiusly cheap used fillers  last dish sausage weenies  Ok but tasted breakfast item   After food arrived drinks served guys behind bar vanished  eliminates getting another drink right? asked bar back cleaning restocking if restaurant closed hence all hustle bustle when arrived he said No bar open all night   just back chatting snacking hoped snag bartender another drink soon    But alas when bartender server did show again he informed eat quickly because restaurant now closed half hour! Wow!!!! asked check tipped appropriately work done left never return   Boo really expected better  if would know closing closed wouldn't mosied expecting relax over drink some food  wish hostess seated bar told that      I didn't see any hours operation signs when left but now know better! feel overall visit could handled differently server could nicer  sure he figured when he looked bill compared tip! <EOR> Geez high rating!!!  Nothing really stuck when came dinner   service slightly above average which quite disappointing such respectable establishment   also noted slight air arrogance among servers which really did understand nor appreciate  strange!  = Table service hasty sloppy   While being poured wine server dripped good amount arm did bother apologize   service just very lacking attentive   all tables even full couldn't because busy night    For appetizers ahi tuna salad beer battered shrimp oysters   shrimp pretty big juicy well battered   other two appetizers decent but did stand out   ordered bacon wrapped scallops which quite savory fairly well prepared   However couple them tad overcooked   also tried veal along halibut   Both dishes seemed quite mediocre appetizers   Overall redeeming factor would say would pricing dishes   entrees general range $20 35 which considering presentation quite reasonable   portions pretty good well    Nonetheless service disappointment food didn't amaze expected =   <EOR> I really enjoyed food here   BUT     value expense My personal ROI if felt dead average   We group     lots sharing looking other dishes   did anything knocked socks off    Sorry Michael  <EOR> My group Nobhill Tavern late night happy hour expecting best meals Vegas trip   nothing but disappointed    Service those servers think nothing more impressive writing down orders   told three times wanted little wedge salad NO BACON   When salad came bacon   course   Everything else ordered arrived he came check finished   told never flatbread   Obviously he forgot put but instead fessing he told takes long time because each fresh   So   does mean everything else just sitting around?  When flatbread came few minutes later wasn't even warm   nothing would taken any longer rest order   Food ordered beer battered shrimp two lobster rolls little gem wedge salad flatbread house made chips dip   chips dip came first best ever ah such high hopes Nobhill!  However shrimp nothing special $8 four pieces shrimp nuts if nothing special them   lobster rolls weird fake lemon taste bad way   wedge salad came four halves grape tomatoes so only two tomatoes total three small pieces bacon that didn't want three chunks iceberg lettuce flavorless blue cheese dressing   flatbread basically cracker spinach tomato topping   all mediocre lobster rolls actually bad side   Everything $8 late night menu but chips dip $5   Overall expectations met back  <EOR> We Nobhill Tavern dinner before going see Cirque's KA  nicely located right next KA theater    I impressed whatsoever  waiter completely unfriendly  He treated little kids  All wanted say honey work don't own place    We spent $130 wine glass champagne appetizers  couldn't believe prices  Completely outrageous cheeseburger sliders wood fired sausage  sliders oversalted  couldn't take second bite  only word comes mind when think sausages NASTY  rubbery no flavor   The only good thing charcuterie platter which consisted salami ham pate which phenomenal bread few pickles onions whole grain honey mustard  Honestly create platter similar if better home   I won't going back Nobhill    ever  <EOR> Stopped place meet colleagues glass wine two   didn't eat review somewhat incomplete   The wine selection pretty good but thought expensive   servers very nice but very clumsy   2 hours bartender spilled drink he preparing all over bar almost spilled me     then he dropped dish broke all over floor   happened 5 people bar    not he distracted all business    ha!  Will return?  Probably not    unless friend colleague me  <EOR> Made reservations here    seated     FOOD I pork chop    extremely tender    impressed fat meat taste    texture excellent  bigger other dishes offered too    My fiancé halibut he said ok sauce weak    tried didn't much flavor   Truffle Mac cheese disappointed  expected more    wasn't even enough cheese!  Bussel sprouts good!  Crab cakes 3 small pieces bread helps crab texture    Very good   Unlimited bread yummy  SERVICE Great service  Because Michael Mina restaurant needs good service   AMBIANCE Nice front but back eh  only bathroom    Really?

My husband lobster pot pie which decent but nearly good would expect signature dish restaurant price point   also tried horseradish whipped potatoes which did enjoy but may just due heavy horseradish more universal issue   also lobster rolls cheese fondue which both good   saw many other diners eating Kobe burger fries entree   would clearly never back but would recommend other diners stick less expensive more basic options seem more successful  <EOR> I think just found favorite new Vegas bar!  The world needs more bartenders guys  know talking about    kind guys actually seem enjoy chatting making special concoctions even letting sample little tastes things they've created   We enjoyed appetizers drinks much ended returning next day pre l'Atelier drinks    First night truffle mac n' cheese cliche but awesome beer battered shrimp more perfect tempura beer batter crispy Korean chicken wings great sauce!
