Was staying came breakfast  assortment food available great  made order omelettes any way want them  french toast sausage bacon steel cut oatmeal really good nature valley bar pieces available potatoes pastries smoked salmon waffles etc   etc    honeydew seemed partially frozen but actually separated pineapple other fruits Thank God! kudos them doing that  Everything else good  surprised regular price breakfast $20 because nothing stood amazing but free breakfast can't complain  <EOR> Okay first visit but total flop next  Poor service! Poor attitude!   My post direct Yelp wants more but else say  <EOR> Not bad all but fantastic   attended nice Jazz Brunch today atmosphere very inviting relaxing   buffet  good however service bit slow   fair large group over twenty 20 however restaurant otherwise busy  <EOR> There signs but tried ignore them  Always your gut instinct story tell you    It started off coupon mail 3 course meal all $20 09  piqued interest since JW Marriott dump figured why not?  We immediately no weekend night  When bread basket warm assortment good  But taking bite cheese biscuit olive bread rolled wheat bread rosemary bread bread's quality masked warmness  clearly old but reheated  YUCK    I started regret being enticed coupon but decided let's give food try    A Parsnip bisque Canned soup would tasted better  oil sitting top soup! flavor strong didn't right consistency bisque should have   B Salad Most decent dish there  can't wrong just need fresh lettuce which pile of  dressing thick though  tasted processed   At least tomatoes manchengo cheese sufficed   C Salmon baby potatoes Salmon overcooked salty   The other choice steak which also tasted sure wasn't being harsh critic  the steak despicable  No flavor overcooked   D Dessert Strawberry shortcake Chocolate Mousse   Why even bother point?  But see   the desserts failed miserably too    The only highlight night finding new wine like Cupcake Sauvignon Blanc <EOR> Attended very first First Sunday Jazz Brunch today   same wonderful food along favorite omelet chef Vegas but very crowded staff seemed taken aback crowd   jazz band terrific especially singer    reservation 10 30 arrived 10 20   Making reservation made no difference   we still wait line plus seated probably worst table restaurant right next kitchen    would return again but would 11 30 when crowd seemed die down bit  <EOR> The breakfast buffet lands somewhere between meh  better you'd expect outside Vegas  some logistical issues group day wedding brunch which stressed organizer the bride   <EOR> I made mistake ordering omelet off menu  think buffet would better deal particularly since omelet making station part buffet!? Oh well  ordered asparagus brie omelet  thought asparagus bit tough probably because asparagus season  Would liked see more seasonal menu  brie good omelet but think overall paid same gotten buffet    Like others said ambiance lovely right next garden but seated table closer interior restaurant didn't reap all benefits sunlight    Server nice polite  <EOR> I want place much more can   few all day meeting Ceres years ago felt nice retreat   as if whisked away Palm Springs day   enjoy relaxing waterfall outside window all   Went restaurant week because closest thing small window time   nothing special meal scallops overly gritty salmon overcooked crab stuffed artichokes under cooked only desserts worth coming back for    Service friendly ambiance nice   but would rather spent money someplace else   I still decide come once year because incredible mushroom risotto once upon time but tonight think more twice well  <EOR> This second time place   Beautiful location   Music okay although blaring Jazz idea fun brunch   Every time sister law suggested place twice shown see family   GOOD LORD food HORRIBLE   thawed food service muffins cold pancakes cold french toast cold bacon cold sausage frozen butter   syrup awful   Honestly NEVER such horrible food life!!
