Therefore outlet mall probably more stores then your average outlet mall             If you're into shopping mall still purpose                 walk huge mall exercise!  A nice feature Las Vegas South Premium Outlet mall indoor mall hot summers won't worry extreme Las Vegas heat winter won't worry cold weather either   There tons stores mall well two food courts  Some favorite stores check Nike Under Armour Quiksilver Converse Vans   The list stores outlet mall pretty endless        too many stores mention just post link see various stores eateries outlet mall   http www premiumoutlets com outlet las vegas south stores  If some reason don't car Las Vegas South Premium Outlet mall no need fret smaller version outlet mall near downtown Las Vegas area called Las Vegas North Premium Outlet    The North Premium Outlet may big much stores but if just happen stay hotel downtown area California Hotel Fremont Four Queens Golden Nugget Main Street D Plaza Hotel Downtown Grand Hotel North Premium Outlet Mall far away downtown hotels              You probably take long walk catch bus even taxi down North Premium Outlet Mall far away   Overall I'd rather Las Vegas South Premium Outlet Mall indoor shopping atmosphere   <EOR> Comfortable shopping all quality brands available some store mostly retail outlets  Compared Cabazon Ontario outlet malls store assistants very helpfull offering discounts giving additional discount options   Shopped November sun heat problem  actually enjoyed sitting corridors  Lots seating areas  Smoking allowed perk smokers problem non smokers  Great shopping experience missing star store personnel way none general observation other half missing potential extreme heat summer   Take hat if going anytime april  fun enjoy <EOR> Hm   don't see why lower review   I didn't even know outlet    only north one   better main reason   INDOORSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS   Indoors = AC = happiness Vegas   That all   Actually parking much better other outlet well That all  <EOR> When first moved 2000 known Belz mall place most shopping needs  still think best Nike outlet store around   I buy some work pants basically knew wasn't going any farther first section where Nike located course where Haggar is  Haggar place work pants shorts long time didn't disappoint $18 pairs slacks  think all Yelping expanding waistline needed some bigger pants most old stuff don't fit no more  nice part Haggar flexible waist band allows some growth    I also snuck Kitchen Connection store which some quality items decent prices well some discount items come handy  some screens pans grease don't splatter mini dip warming dish some silver bowls pre measured ingrediants  Now all learn cook   I did notice Columbia Sportswear store where old Burlington used but didn't in  usually quality stuff  check them out   Lots lots mid hallway vendors    almost many  usual influx tourists don't speak English blocking doorways generally no respect fellow man  <EOR> This place always total madhouse but lots men's women's clothing lingerie housewares other shops sort become discount Mecca  love come discount shoes Billabong store lane Bryant Roxy Quiksilver shop  plenty friends empty right now both food courts kind lacking but food options if need them  prepared walk behind slow poke idiots don't know where going   <EOR> Outlets hit miss depending you're going for  good alternative selection brands Element Fox Hurley Vans Converse etc  if you're into those brands also other brands such Coach Charlotte Russe Windsor if you're into others    The Outlets hit miss because some stores good deals others plain expensive  just remolded everything outside interior exterior decor more modernized cleaned which always plus   believe only major accredited store Outlets Coach everything else more secondary brands hear aren't top dogs but still known  Still worth give place browse through though might find something good  <EOR> South outlet pretty good if you're into outlet malls  Every time seems place packed more tourist y crowd looking those Outlet deals    They great selection stores include some classier outlets well  getting pretty partial Hugo      You need Starbucks place chill bit halfway mark covered    The thing find annoying vendors center walkways carts little pushy st times  Gives bazaar feel  more less just shopping annoyed pretty grateful when pass cart already some other potential customer being helped    All all place spend some dough when you're deal mode going outlet  <EOR> Nachdem wir die Las Vegas North Premium Outlets schon mehrfach aufgesucht hatten wollten wir jetzt auch mal die Las Vegas South Premium Outlets entdecken  Aufgrund der teilweise negativen Berichte hatten wir uns bisher dort nicht blicken lassen   Unter anderem findet man hier Adidas Ann Taylor Armani Boss Calvin Klein Coach Cole Haan DKNY Guess Ascics Levis Nike Michael Kors Nautica Reebok Timberland Tommy Hilfiger Polo Ralph Lauren und Under Armour um nur einige zu nennen  Insgesamt findet man hier 145 Stores   Auch wenn keine aktuelle Sales Aktion war konnte man wirklich sehr gute Einsparungen erzielen  Vorher sollte man ggf  auf der Homepage nach Coupons oder Aktionen suchen  Ich konnte 2 Paar Schuhe von Timberland für ca  50 Dollar kaufen  Beide Paare waren um 70 % runtergesetzt und das zweite Paar wurde dann nochmals um 50 % reduziert  Da macht das Einkaufen Spaß   Die Outlet Mall ist einem Gebäude schön klimatisiert und macht einen sehr gepflegten Eindruck  Der Food Court macht einen ansprechenden Eindruck  Kostenlose Parkplätze sind ausreichend vorhanden  Am Wochenende kann es schon mal sehr voll werden   Insgesamt ein empfehlenswertes Outlet mit einer guten Auswahl von Geschäften  Ich würde es immer dem Las Vegas North Premium Outlet vorziehen  <EOR> Not bad outlet mall    they renovate open new stores but still outlet north much better store choices  <EOR> We always attempt stop check store when neighborhood  lot stores outlet mall always good chance finding something looking for!   We noticed time cart vendors aggressive pushy time strolled through mall  actually peaceful stroll store store us  wonder if someone said something them complained maybe simply all tired? major difference time past visits where would mobbed every cart vendor  Anyhow refreshing left alone because No don't want ring cleaned    No don't want ruin nails testing your magic nail polish   No don't want watch iron press shirt   No don't want ruin makeup crappy facial public because your cleanser magically look feel younger    catch drift?  My honey bunches oats loves DC enjoy checking Lids store new DC caps him    This visit hit jackpot Converse store see review    This outlet mall worth checking sure lot great merchandise fraction cost indeed!

Also most prices full retail  just say'in  <EOR> I love hate mall always crowded tourists tourists rude no idea walk halls shopping mall    If local night     hour before closing lucky enough everything need less stress people stop right front elbow smell funny Etc   You sure deal but watch return policy seems stricter policy place if visit same store outside mall    Also if want deals pick magazine near map      coupons it  <EOR> This decent outlet mall located far south end Las Vegas strip  good mix high end Coach Michael Kors Kate Spade non high end stores Vanity Fair Wrangler Lee store majority stores located inside mall nice hot sweltering days     While hubby discovered Citizen watch store  Being huge fans Eco Drive watches stop in  Hubby didn't buy anything but found great watch only $99!   If hungry large food court popcorn stand smell mile away well    One thing wish mall would crack down kiosk associates aggressive nature  least 3 times most recent trip kiosk workers practically leap yell attention carnival barkers  absolutely cannot stand that  Listen if am all interested you're selling approach you  Okay? also feel way many kiosks mall period  things rather congested when walking mall  Whoever charge mall please look into this  <EOR> Tons stores chose ample parking but place just strange vibe every time walk in  no idea why just strange! early day because place becomes overrun tourists   They few places eat food courts your typical mall fast foods  place kept reasonably clean busy gets  careful crossing parking lot though between tourists rental cars having no clue where going ever persistent crazy taxi drivers tad bit dangerous there  <EOR> Not favorite outlet mall Vegas bay areans reminds lot Southland except place smells feet     My favorite stores Hot Topic Coach Outlets   Coach store seems really good selection bough oh 3 purses far! <EOR> I coming outlets since used called Belz  Honestly still call them most time probably won't stop any time soon  lot renovation mall over years result positive   I always enjoy perusing stores kiosks when area  huge fan having mall split between main portion annex since back car repark if want check any stores side  Overall enjoy outlet mall quite bit frequenting quite bit more lately since work area  <EOR> Update Review!
