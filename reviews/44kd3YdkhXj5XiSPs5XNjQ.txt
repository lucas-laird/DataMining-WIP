Server fairly quick greet drinks coming but all starts crumble 10 year old croutons    ordered Street Tacos appetizer no expert street tacos but honest better tacos taco bell  know   Steak chop style Restaurant but why put menu if doesn't fit in? server took order asked soup day reply ummmmm don't know just literally think may chicken tortilla lemon chicken spice something? reply if chicken tortilla may that? If not? May potato cheese? never answer just quick swoop table potato cheese off     guess wasn't chicken tortilla??? girlfriend ordered Monte Cristo no Mayo  10 server came inform don't order pre made couldn't alter sandwich   She reluctantly ok due long taken already inform issue   10 minutes later see Monte Cristo sandwich table seated seated jokingly said she must called ahead ordered    when order FINALLY came tried serve Chicken Sandwich      5 more minutes by   server tried light stumbled twisted excuse another lady order Monte Cristo same time told chef she wanted no mayo he confused stapled wrong tickets together all messed we're sorry  wanted agree loud them being SORRY wasnt going rude inconsiderate girlfriend offered meal share her  She felt same way wanted eat enjoy mine  Well   no real gentlemen going eat while girlfriend wife sits waiting sips water    waited until arrived 15 minutes later  could tell rushed thrown together even several quick fly bys server he could tell waiting food arrive he never offered warm mine take mine back bring fresh when arrived nothing     both fed poor service quality lack knowledge thier own menu ready leave  Damian server asks    would care some dessert? huh!
