My new favorite taco shop! Carne asada plate awesome  less greasy most places  mulitas quesadilla nice cheesy  staff friendly helpful  Grilled peppers onions spicy but oh good  twice great experience both times  <EOR> The food Rosa's pretty decent but nothing extraordinary  bit concerned dining midweek around 6 30pm being only person joint  ambiance pretty nice taco shop  Very clean very new used Jersey Mikes Subs which usually decent decor    I took advantage $ 99 bean cheese burrito special definitely good  wife enchilada w rice beans below average  I'd definitely give Rosa's another shot specifically burrito which btw huge but definitely concerned only people before eating during eating eating  Spanish would say  no bueno  <EOR> Rosa said she everything scratch   My husband loved tacos!  He said he back he can't wait try burritios!  I rolled taco's reminded childhood  tasted shells made scratch   meat little chunky but other really enjoyed tacos   rice pretty good too   sure back  <EOR> Ok didn't retry Carne Asada meat yet which bad review but trying other Mex favorites menu  Today Chorizo Torta sour cream  Delicious!! healthy portion  Torta bread which ruins lot Torta sandwiches if good warm soft toasted moist  would definitely eat again recommend anyone looking good Torta  <EOR>
