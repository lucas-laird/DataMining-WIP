Mexcian restaurant New Mexico favorite stacked green chile enchiladas!  place great but loses star making park parking garage casino which means smell cigarette smoke just delicious dinner   does awesome people watching though! <EOR> Mediocre Mexican food  only thing really enjoy sopapias hot fresh little bit honey  Other food just your typical concoction rice beans guacamole tortilla corn flour some form meat  place located inside Palms Hotel Casino which trendy jacks prices significantly  <EOR> We lunch drinks when first arrived Vegas  service lack luster  waitress obviously didn't want didn't want serve anyone   The margs terrible pretty much mix splash tequilla if drink more stomach ache  salsa bar pretty good enjoyed getting all different types   I would skip eating save your money something more delicious maybe food court instead  <EOR> My review may little biased because girlfriend some serious stomach issues same night ate there  am sure if food enormous amounts alcohol made feel sick next morning  food actually fairly good  Margaritas definitely sweet service pretty good also  <EOR> What disappointment place is!   experienced horribly apathetically lackluster service   took long time waiter just acknowledge then he took drink order    Took 15 minutes come back two drinks weak flat tasting rum coke incorrectly poured very cold Sam Adams it half head   course time waiter came back I'd drank almost all it!     Overall time seated until received food 50 minutes   dining room 1 4 capacity    employees milling about   serving patrons     Our food average   Honestly giant leap above Roberto's   think service better Roberto's    Then check arrived   incorrect   added erroneous $2 50   took bumbling staff members 15 minutes figure cash register allegedly malfunctioning      Ugh   Skip place   almost better off going Del Taco!  Seriously  <EOR> My BFF stopped quick bite  intended cafe next door but chips salsa sounded good off Garduno's went   The chip salsa good excellent but good provided good thermometer rest dinner  also liked fact self serve salsa bar which included avocado salsa! love avocado salsa good one! Creamy small avocado chunks slightly spicy great combo warm tortilla chips! Mm Mmm!  Not being hungry just opted Rolled Tacos or Taquitos normally call them   Pretty simple 6 total tacos 3 filled chicken cheese 3 filled shredded beef cheese then whole plate topped cheese pico de gallo  Good stuff! plate comes sides Chile con Queso I didn't care one Guacamole ok great Sour Cream  opted dip tacos avocado salsa instead Overall good dining experience  service friendly prompt food came timely hot    While didn't love place good satisfied quick bite  may return but many other GREAT restaurants Vegas check instead! <EOR> I admit go!  am emotionally attached Garduno's   may more forgiving some areas   lived Albuquerque NM 4 years fell love them when Pa Pa Felipes   later years became Garduno's   When walked into Palms years ago saw Garduno's smitten!

It's great buffet itself actually pretty good   my favorite items Chimichangas Green Chile Pork Stew   Huevos Rancheros also very good   plenty other options well Omelet Station   The margaritas very good very strong   be careful!  They very friendly staff well  <EOR> We chose Gardunos dinner because Palms near final destination evening prices seemed relatively reasonable highest rated Mexican restaurants Vegas   chips salsa good usually effective indicator quality   margaritas tasty probably worth $12 pop but Vegas baby   friends ordered fajitas steak shrimp excellent!  Great seasoning meat we're going try replicate home!  ordered stuffed rellenos which sounded good but pretty much cheese slick some chicken machacas mixed in   few bites stuffed slight queasy feeling hour afterward   impressed all!  local taqueria kicks places ass hands tied behind back! <EOR> The key salsa bar which Baja Fresh all you can serve yourself  bad overall margaritas strong tasty according fellow drinkers  don't spots necessarily food watching TVs over across 24 7 those drinking only spots? Odd   The mixed appetizers dish massive four sauces bean spicy guac salsa dish good but almost feels Chili's implanted into Palms  necessarily best motivations other drinks   A bit dark but place where grab chips salsa drinks without much trouble  <EOR> If dont sunday brunch then its just so so pricey   far sunday brunch its slam dunk   Food good solid variety fresh salsas all drink margaritas actually some alcohol taste good   Dollar dollar best values best mexican all eat drink buffett far  <EOR> Creamiest Sweetest Frozen Velvety Most Delicious  FROZEN COCONUT MARGARITA  ever!
