Ok maybe million people LA did  Until little Italian came along love cuisine cooking planted roots Lee's Discount Liquor parking lot missing out  Before opening shop Ron the owner respect food people sought approval Korean community before even opening shop happily accepted dishing kitchen  Now  respect baby   With said let tell some good stuff when you'll hooked  love tell meat properly marinated layers flavors everything properly seasoned  amount filling perfect price right  almost feel guilty paying little something good satisfying   come back often because Ron gets little crazy busts something special  seasonal that'll take your taste buds another level  <EOR> I've read all reviews food truck decided try myself!

Nothing you've try it   fusion innovative spicy  <EOR> Pretty average taco 60 70 minute wait  guys ready prime time showdown  <EOR> My second trip Hanshiktaco brought some very good very surprising tacos  tried chicken taco pork taco wasn't expected  but really good way    Both tacos came lettuce kimchee slaw wasn't overpowering spicy but added just enough kick taco most unique flavor combinations taco ever including Bombay Tacos Yayos which curry based   felt needed bit sauce added some sriracha added just right oomph looking for    We garlic asian fries both which very addictive  love side dishes often meal side dishes appetizers but pair tacos little reach me  weren't tasty fries tacos just didn't mesh meal together me  Didn't stop eating them however  said very very addictive  always sweet fried dough delicious crispy always  Those pretty much never fail  <EOR> A staple delicious favorite places eat town friends  Everything menu delicious highest quality nicely priced  yet eat something hanshiktaco did love thoroughly especially weekly specials  owner come dishes unique roasted turkey sweet potato Mexican gravy quesadillas while still ensuring every ingredient high quality delicious  most underrated food truck town  If haven't yet try it! <EOR> I sit review awhile because excitement when first tried overpowered excitement trying something different  Now head clear over enthusiasm died down write fair review   This place random stop checking liquor store Christmas gift  Ita cute loud music coolers chairs  just back home when would party beach  menu simple tacos hot dog sides fried dough  ordered chicken taco fries hot dogs sweet dough  honest all good  texture dogs awesome tacos  Great flavors great combo whole Korean spices hot dogs tacos  Overall I'd eat again sure    I hope continue serve now  Fried dough great way cool off palette spicy flavors order basket  Great experience! <EOR> I'm happy places within 5 minutes house where tasty cheap lunch!

No all she says confused look somehow still buying but drove all way WTH place orders   ordered beef taco tofu egg taco french fries fried dough   four items ordered only order took OVER 15 MINUTES!

If willing willing hang around Lee's parking lot coupe extra minutes Nate dog  <EOR> I other side town running errands buying dog goodies Healthy Tails heading 95 freeway home when saw Korean taco truck  I'd seen reviews thought I'd give change   Had nice chat owner while he fixing stuff two people line ahead me  Talked Bachi Burger Slider Truck Food Network's Great Food Truck Race other things   I ordered beef pork tacos  Great price  $5 two tacos  huge but then don't big portions  hate wasting food   Sat car listening Car Talk while ate them  Only problem spilling some juice white tee shirt  tacos themselves tasty little spicy but overly so  spice but sometimes heat just overpowers taste meat  nice mix meat marinade toppings   Two thumbs up  unlike Fukuburger they're open during day! I'm early riser hard time staying late enough Fukuburger fix  <EOR> I set try burrito all flavored fries    uh yeah don't them anymore    They restructured menu now includes only Tacos beef chicken pork tofu egg 1 $2 78 2 $4 63 not so Fries seasoned fries $1 16 no more flavor options Crazy Dough $1 16 Jumbo Nate Dog $2 78 12 oz Drinks $1  We ourselves mom grandma share 4 pork tacos 2 tofu egg 2 not so fries 2 crazy doughs    I'm going first somewhat negative review but seriously came excited some Seoul Fusion tacos came short  Let preface am LA eating way through all fusion food trucks when craze started  say standard grail which judge all others heavily  Oh know pickle brine kimchee best them done fusion tacos all life being part blended family filipino adobo tacos ethiopian tibbs tacos duck confit tacos bahn mi tacos BBQ pulled pork beer slaw   yeah food     Even if didn't experience food genre something off food  trying expert asshole but just saying know kimchee should good fusion since style cooking  Though kimchee right amount spice set off food but  overwhelming meek palettes flavor off going sort've bitterish weird flavor threw off all us  main shtick fusion part taco good kimchee supposed be  savory bit sour bit salty briny but bitterish odd flavor can't place no go  Best way describe if botch spoiled batch kimchee  bad jar once later found wasn't only sealed loosely but dad ate pieces spoon he eating lunch contaminating hence off fermented spoilt flavor  tacos fairly big flour tortillas but mostly filled lettuce  pork cubes usual shredded soft juicy nice own but sparse  Tofu Egg lot tofu egg taco compared pork   mashed tofu mixed egg very wet kimchee made soggy texture just wasn't working me  Also wetness made bitchfit even eat tacos because stuck paper container ripped holes into taco then bowl instead taco  think needs heavier fry stand wetness kimchee I personally would crispy fried tofu cubes shredded omelette instead blended together drain kimchee bit better before putting taco avoid large amount sog factor  BF left Tofu Egg alone few bites guy kept saying hungry car decided skip lunch 1 errands eat later 4  Apparently hungry enough down taco    Fries yummy crispy greasy good amount seasoning them  Crazy dough good crispy doughy greasy all but definitely needed more sugar coating I dipped them honey home     I think Vegas needs street food since every great city great street vendors give kudos anyone wants into food stand truck culture start city off  gave very fair 3 stars being VERY nice fact fries dough tasty  However can't just live off dough fries alone meal afraid way cards fall  all ordering only if Lee's already feeling having snack  doing some sort promotional stuff Lees even Hanshik raffle very well event boggle things up   come back maybe few months try taco again give fair chance but stands something hesitate ordering again  BF does want back he says he really disappointed    set Blue Nile Ethiopian food lunch Crown bakery dessert  dinner Slider Truck then BF idea instead bring mom grandma food weren't feeling well  Yeah today feel shafted good eating day three places place didn't live hype    I pretty pissed starved part day eat w family instead place near them  resurrect myself getting kitchen late tonight doing something Chef worthy  might off day them everyone but shit made seeming good day off  wasn't fault chose come day time but expected something worth giving day leaves bitter kimchee  <EOR> Stopped today lunch friend tipped off being far where was   The loot 1 Tofu + Egg Taco 1 Chicken Taco 2 Beef Tacos 2 Pork Tacos 1 Garlic Fry 1 Asian Fry 1 Crazy's Sweet Dough 1 Just fun Order asian chicken wings  Total $20 cash only  My wife agreed pork tacos best  Pork well marinated tender  liked beef charred just right way even though she didn't care much it  Chicken excellent  Just right amount asian ginger based spice some kimchi lots fresh greens  Everything cooked order  Tofu taco something never tried before can't compare any other place  good although main taste came kimchi spices as expected    Chicken wings little less spicy would them but tasty greasy actually tad dryer side outside still tender inside come think it   Fries very good  home made taste them cooked tasty oil  garlic fries could used more garlic but if aren't big fan really garlic y fries bound love subtle flavor  Asian fries great just enough zing them stand most other fast food places   Crazy sweet dough very much donut holes surprisingly good  expected them more soaked oil but excited find crispy outside tender inside no oil drippings taste donuty and oily   powdered sugar top just right amount   I only person line took little while everything come 15 minutes but well worth wait  Plus weather cooperated high 70s pleasant instead 100 degree heat seen all week   ++ <EOR> The mere thought them tastebuds giddy weeks  love kimchi love corn tortillas kimchi tacos seemed guaranteed culinary nirvana  Mix tofu convinced someone listening prayers   Alas kimchi tofu egg taco Hanshik disappointment  only taco am giving them 3 stars benefit doubt  Sadly solo taco experience probably prevent returning unless hear tofu rework    What shortcomings taco? Well primarily three 1  tortilla corn  big fat flour one  Props providing generous tacos but flour tortilla warm yummy  Perhaps corn does well tofu? If then think thinner warmer perhaps even smaller flour tortilla would more delightful taco  2  kimchi kimpressive  reminded more sauerkraut  Yes cabbage fresh but seasoning heavy sourness without balance chili spice  3  tofu egg mixture seasoned well thus pretty much tasted plain scrambled eggs    All combined taco think could use some improvement  always mad props inventive passionate entrepreneur  Service definitely nice enthusiastic    I would say give other tacos crazy dough whirl  <EOR> Having tire blowout left way bummed price replacing pair them total left even more down dumps!  Good thing tire store next Hanshiktaco which really nice owner good Nate dog!     crazy Korean Taco truck looks really nice clean inside he fine conversation while great meal $5! French Fries pretty rad but star kimchee laden Nathan's hot dog!   little Siracha rocks!    I'm glad finally stopped although wish I'd buy new tires it     cash only which only other problem   But prices afford change your car! <EOR> Found place accident  going buy some wine Lee's friend pointed Hanshiktaco   it dark no lights didn't want walk alone   so cut chase   Ron owner very cool guy food very good price kudo's Lee family letting there   its places give Vegas its cool vibe    shame people giving two stars     <EOR> So coincidently right down street gym  husband driving past day decided stop best thing he could ever done!!!!!!
