Treat your guest better! <EOR> This place simply nails it   Price point great spend $10 super healthy fresh meal   or spend $7 some fast food joint chinese spot bad Italian place same shopping center place no brainer   Outstanding service even given weird tablet order format which cool once used it delicious fresh healthy food best part all reasonable price point!  kind place something Summerlin whole especially area many active people missing some time   I rarely gush anywhere reviews attest but think place going become serious mainstay concept outstanding   As far food first time shrimp bowl which good   portions dead should meal delicious   girlfirend picked sandwich can't recall was bite great well   Total came $21?  bad!  Came lunch today spent $10 steak bowl which outstanding     Highly recommended although some may take some time used tablet ordering thing <EOR> Maybe gone another time would better experience but first time restaurant left pretty bad impression    Since never Krayvings before little bit confused upon entering  wasn't entirely clear whether supposed seat ourselves order tablets table order counter  only 2 other people dining time tried eye contact staff member no avail no greeted all actually  husband decided seat ourselves ultimately walked counter asked help  staff member came table explained tablet situation  also grabbed paper menu because thought would easier look through  didn't take long realize although very similar paper menu tablet did reflect all same items  wound using both choose dishes used tablet place order   About 10 minutes later food brought out  husband swapped side salad sweet potato hash tablet but side salad brought instead  He reminded food runner she did bring correct dish   The food fine but severely overpriced  ate just everything plates since soup salad sandwich cost $35  sat bit finished eating when no came bus table again weren't sure protocol located trash decided we'd clean ourselves  picked stack plates bowls almost immediately upon standing left tomato soup bowl crashing floor sending tomato soup splattering everywhere  immediately hands knees began sopping napkins  husband grabbed another bunch while did best clean mess off floor adjacent table myself  Meanwhile multiple members staff literally walked around while cleaned floor  person offered help person grabbed mop person said word  knelt middle restaurant sopping tomato soup off floor dozens paper napkins while staff completely ignored entire situation  all actually quite embarrassing   Once I'd finished cleaning floor to best ability using only napkins line pay  stood over 8 minutes all while person addressed now sticky mess remnant tomato soup floor  register cashier gave total  When asked chocolate chip cookies never received but still bill she told she didn't any  very awkward pause she asked if we'd remove them bill  Well certainly didn't want pay item didn't even stock! Finally I'd signed receipt kindly reminded cashier spill should probably addressed  which point she points hollers across restaurant spill! mop up?! staff members carefully stepped around while cleaning floor earlier  pretty sure he already knew though  Needless say we're no hurry visit again   TL DR Fair but overpriced food terrible service  <EOR> Craving Krayvings right now!!!  Mediterranean sandwich    seriously best sandwiches ive ever eaten   flavor combination delightful    green salad accompanied sandwich equally good   Flavorful light dressing   Chased sandwich salad tasty soft chocolate chip cookie   highly recommend gem  <EOR> Love it! day Krayvings delicious healthy customer service oriented establishment never disappoints  <EOR> Went first time morning hike Red rock loved it! shame hidden nobody really knows there    Keep skinny fresh squeezed juice Steak superfood breakfast bowl  healthy delicious! only real healthy places around  see big things Krayvings if more people find them! <EOR> This first time say food excellent  If you're looking grub something healthy just grab smoothie looks covered  location great especially since really close red rock canyon  only reason 2 star review service  ordered 2 salmon burgers 2 large shakes  prices higher your usual wraps burgers but guess all because quality food  salmon burger right away shakes  took 30 mins 3 follow ups second shake  weren't many people 3 servers  4 people drinks before 3 them orders wrong  time 2nd drink almost done meal  shame because food really good but price paying don't think back type service  did try compensate giving free drink handing 2nd drink but don't think no care sincerity side they weren't rude anything just didn't give f**k   fact keep reminding them order kept forgetting deal breaker  hope fix service ASAP because food concept really great would comeback again but won't anytime soon  <EOR> Food came extremely fast which lets know just sitting back there  Waitress then drops napkins food     food mediocre if really hungry  Would suggest eating if working taste buds don't enjoy over priced bad food  <EOR> Tried Krayvings lunch break other day amazing!

Daily Detox juice Bison Chili Salmon Protein Bowl plus 1 wheatgrass shot 1 ginger shot cayenne pepper   I started just juice talking client mine just needed something drink while finished conversation  really well balanced wasn't overpowering beet flavor other juices had  felt really metabolism going but also could smells coming kitchen while met client   The chili really good spicy but over top bison super lean chili wasn't super oily greasy  really hot when let cool bit but once did couldn't stop eating it   The Salmon Protein Bowl perfect  fish cooked perfectly BBQ sauce paired really well fish quinoa veggies  definitely again next time   The shots surprisingly delicious  Usually wheatgrass shots bitter leave your mouth tasting freshly mowed lawn but Krayvings shot sweet left mouth tasting great   Ginger shot excellent tad spicy side since cayenne pepper added but good worth heat   Overall excellent experience staff food  highly recommend Krayvings! <EOR> Finally     year driving Krayvings stopped in  Being first time received warm welcome training session ordering system place  Now always wondered systems would affect service but server likes why embrace modern technology  system easy navigate let's customize your order  checking paper menu also provided set order motion very simple right    Sweet  !!  tried Turkey protein bowl quinoa  quinoa little strange first but warmed bowl tasty kept filled hours without bloat which tough do  g f Egg White Bacon Breakfast Sandwich added avocado always added treat any sand which  very good returned following day go  Overall really Krayvings stop more often now finally ate here  Four Stars Krayvings could more but everything served paper plates bowls untencils also disposable  <EOR> Healthy conveniently located house  However never full eating food nothing shout definitely don't crave it  If then steak Caesar steak sandwich  tried some rice bowls before flavoring off enough carb balance meal just didn't it  Some people love place though definitely try yourself  <EOR> The food does disappoint!
