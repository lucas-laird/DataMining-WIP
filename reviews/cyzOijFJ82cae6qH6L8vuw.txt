I would highly recommend great Thai food  <EOR> The outside restaurant does absolutely no justice amazing food is   done great job decorating making inside inviting comfortable   tried several different dishes all very good   staff friendly helpful   Try lunch  <EOR> I frequently pick takeout place usually happy food service  Last night 01 04 17 7 20 arrived food order 2 entrees 2 desserts totaling $75  young waitress took care sweet over phone when arrived pick food  older Asian waitress maybe 40s slightly bigger woman took care check  20 mins sure why but interact woman more waitress greeted took order over phone  older woman rude when needed enter pin payment which way never asked before restaurant walk busy back area instead signing little slip  Then still some reason sign little slip  When she handed receipt sign she didn't look but shoved tray if she wanted face  wtf?? much pay good customer service courtesy should expected  Idk if because young brown whatever but family members servers tip well because it  probably won't come future other good Thai places town where won't treated second rate customer  BTW actual food good although great  <EOR> What great surprise area face value offers very little regards great Thai cuisine   recently discovered venue through co worker during monthly together lunch   pleasingly surprised ambience   More overs lunch menu though small offers soup dessert part meal   Also meal itself in case chicken patai both generous delicious   Service very personable quick   look forward monthly together few days enjoy another serving  <EOR> Great food excellent service! own tattoo shop around corner ordered take other day  While waited order prepared Art brought ice cold glass strawberry water stemless wine glass  small gesture but showed knew treat customers  Highly recommend restaurant <EOR> To open Thai restaurant same parking lot many consider best Thai restaurant L o S better good  Arawan great!

Pad Thai exquisite tasty  noodles sweet chef very generous chicken  Pad Thai plated beautifully cross cross egg pouch garnished looked sweet potato chips  dish itself rather pricey $18 but didn't keep away coming back again Pad Thai  also offered lunch special entree  lunch special costs $9 99 comes soup dessert  Take lunch specials come soup   The Tom Yum soup shrimp another favorite mine  perfect amount sweet sour flavors  favorite part coup actually mushrooms  usually huge fan mushrooms but definitely dish  Definitely coming back again!  The Thai iced tea nothing special  would skip next time  tasted creamer didn't much tea flavor  person made Thai iced tea little heavy handed ice  my cup more 3 4 full!  The restaurant more upscale other Thai restaurants would normally find Vegas prepared higher prices! spot would also perfect date special someone! <EOR> I always really bad experience lotus Siam found place regret it! food way way better then lotus Siam way better pretty environment!!

Gold flakes?  mean $16 simple chicken penang curry??  Four miserly pieces chicken satay $11? VERY salty chinese brocolli crispy pork belly added another 15 bones thank very much   WOW  Penang somewhat decently flavorful proper spices but sauce thin bland despite being ordered phet aka spicy I speak Thai fluently should no misunderstanding   add insult injury staple Thai cuisine some chicken pieces breast meat least appeared undercooked chewy   four miserly satay skewers mostly ok but little glass thimble half size ordinary shot glass peanut sauce barely enough cover piece  finally able more asking twice  Charging steamed rice seems all rage days Arawan following suit  No problem establishment making money but $2 peice small bowl rice per PERSON seems tad excessive   Bottom line overpriced place dishes should without compromise poorly prepared Americanized psuedo Thai food  recent interview asked Thai restaurant owners prepare Thai food America answer easy just would children    other words add tons sugar eliminate most chilies it  perfectly describes food here  conclusion save your money slots where might better chance getting something back your money  same dingy complex another Thai food place called Lotus Siam understand much better  see next time! <EOR> I took friend lunch yesterday extremely pleased   three Thai restaurants location Lotus Siam Komol Arawan   If love Thai food would well experience all three these  best? Today thinking Arawan but definitely want more experimentation  Big smiles  UPDATE back re read reviews other two restaurants which reminded some important factors  Although Yelp gives all three restaurants two $$'s pricing Lotus Siam increased prices think should three $$$'s now  although  food Komol equally good IMHO day no music service extremely slow  Therefore    Arawan truly best  <EOR> Ok Vegas try fav Lotus Siam but find 4 hour wait till 10 00pm dinner   drive over standby 2 hour wait but literally next door Arawan restaurant open able serve   glad tried magnificent Thai food!  The menu simple traditional Thai but served very tender meats excellent presentation culinary skill wrapping pad Thai edible egg basket thin pancake   Try wonderful place out won't disappointed! <EOR> Came during lunch weekday   three tables    Not only did food take FOREVER brought chicken curry instead shrimp curry  By point starving took pieces chicken start eating curry asked waiter side shrimp  He told he take whole dish away even though insisted I'd eat around chicken just bring side shrimp    the waiter then said if keep dish he'd charge chicken curry shrimp curry   kidding me?!  your mistake food took forever let just eat mistake instead guys redoing whole dish would've completely fine side shrimp  He took dish away remake also took forever brother done entree time correct curry came out   pleasant dining experience when each eat meal alone  It place also sketchy dingy part town decor looks tacky you're better off going strip prices place charging   bought thought dishes totally average  <EOR> Vegas blessed some outstanding Thai cuisine   Thai food Gods call shady complex Sahara Commercial Center home   Lotus Siam boasts Northern Thai dishes Komol offers extensive vegetarian menu  Arawan new kid block WOW factor cannot any Thai place Vegas!
