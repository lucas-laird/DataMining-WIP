Hey sorry ok? Maybe even Hey man why don't your first drink since came inch ruining your outfit before even your first drink  returned late night because obviously stupid when wife asks another bartender champagne he recommends he just exhales say Ugh just Prosecco  Ok sorry bothered ask your opinion your options   These two bartenders hate jobs need some points service training   guests hotel somewhat reflects poorly Delano opinion  <EOR> The sweet sirens call made stop drink bar  Plus walked could stop tapping foot elegant sounds coming female singer  She amazing even interacts audience she sings  Franklin bar just pit stop drink  Although offer actual food did partake any trip   The Franklin throw back wonderful lounges 1930s 1940s female singer dancing piano  voice magical she keeps audiences attention  She even waves guests walk by  feels know her  She very magnetic  band amazing keeps wonderfully singing  Some covers performing sound just originals much talent into band    The Franklin located beautiful Delano near lobby  band playing entire energy bar lobby area alive  voice carries all way down hall hear turn corner coming MJ experience  does just hear voice much passion energy singing    As sit write cocktail enjoyable  whole Franklin bar alive now because sirens voice mesmerizing  service bar great but prices little high  performance band does matter  stopped cocktail because lure female singer band overwhelming plus some time kill  <EOR> This place nothing advertised  Labor Day weekend 2015 No DJ nice waitress waiting tables  pass go! collect 200$! lol  The drinks way over priced seriously would rather gambled money away playing Monopoly  <EOR> Great spot located inside Delano lobby  Jose amazing gave great service even better cocktails  Great low key vibe without any typical Vegas hubris  definitely back here! <EOR> I don't typically write reviews because travel nine months year unfortunately rely other people serve but review place      Normally when research place see if I'd spend money straight whiskey bourbon scotch lists  regard place does disappoint     Here's recap experience night friend's bachelor party we gave bar lot business's I'd old fashioned please  Bartender Any preference? Well yours Knob Creek right? Bartender *dismissively* anything  Okay take your old fashioned some sort Four Roses  Surprise me  He proceeds pour remainder bottle single barrel less 2oz  into jigger  Then he pours over rocks adds much simple laughable amount bitters think counted 10 dashes   He stirs 5 times  THEN he takes slice orange shoves into glass    At point just gonna take $25 drink no joke leave but asked if could without giant orange SLICE  He looks takes fingers grabs orange slice glass tosses behind back   couldn't believe it    I asked if he always classic old fashioned way slice now twist I neglected mention improper measurements incorrect preparation   He said bar old fashioned     Later learned friend ordered old fashioned but pointed menu  made correctly all pre mixed   But twist real maraschino cherries    There should no reason old fashioned any other way classic way bar caliber  managers should consider vetting its bartenders    at all    If want good liquor decent place  Don't expect proper cocktail  <EOR> The Franklin lounge perched near lobby area hotel  lounge intimate seductive dark brown tones dimly lit  Love aesthetics!   The well crafted drinks range classics creations barrel aged  Classics selected Basil Paloma which very refreshing added Jarritos grapefruit soda  Another selection Delano daiquiri    As Creations section Mr  Hyde choice entire night  Other good choices Tea Eleanor Apple eye literally smells taste apple pie     Keep mind luxury well crafted drinks comes price you'll find drinks poured premium but they're worthy charge   The thing keep mind lounge fairly small crowded quickly  all very good choice if prefer value well crafted drinks intimate setting  <EOR> Had wait while attention finally menu  But drinks great loved sweat potato tater tots! <EOR> Hard find if your Vegas but nice decor drinks very good bartenders know talking about <EOR> This place very nice several drinks before going other places evening    It small cozy decent bar!! The bar tender could friendlier    trying ask drink wanted even though group only place no waiting he gave face when started asking different bottles if would happened would given perfect score    Anyways stop drink    Enjoy <EOR> The wife decided check Franklin drinks   Franklin classy upscale lobby bar classy upscale Delano   arrived around 4pm Tuesday all seats bar taken   found seats couches which served obligatory attractive cocktail waitresses   Looking over menu immediately drawn Comfortably Numb $18 barrel aged cocktail made Woodford Reserve Double Oaked Bourbon Giffard Vanille de Madagascar coffee bean infused Carpano Antica Vermouth   practically licking chops anticipation until waitress came back few minutes later informed it   Really?  Major disappointment    Plan B Jefferson Library $15 made Jefferson's Reserve Bourbon lemon juice maple syrup Angostura Innis Gunn Scottish Porter   Jefferson Library fell into category sometimes less more  much going pilsner glass served which resulted bourbon notes being lost mix   While certainly wasn't bad cocktail poorly made wasn't where I'd order another really wasn't anything else cocktail list other unavailable Comfortably Numb appealed me   Franklin hotel lobby bar reliable destination craft cocktails  <EOR> This bar favorites near Mandalay Bay  Quiet very sultry  Drinks delicious memorable  <EOR> As 20 year local Las Vegas bar just another example Wall Street controlled Las Vegas strip ripping off customers   decided come concert ordering round drinks discovered glass champagne cost $29   bar nice atmosphere but unfortunately nice enough charge $29 drink  last trip Delano   mob figures ran Las Vegas 1960s 70s would disgusted way Las Vegas strip now treats customers gouging them every opportunity its restaurants bars  <EOR> Swanky yet comfortable bar adjacent lobby Delano formerly Mandalay's Hotel south strip  Nice environ knowledgeable bartenders serving craft beers mixologist cocktails  tucked away allowing patrons mingle shadows while enjoying nice drink two  destination itself but good place catch drink two while waiting real Vegas festivities commence  Also note Franklin     at Delano     like former President Roosevelt  <EOR> Stopped bar way Rivea  Bartender friendly but drinks overpriced  <EOR>
