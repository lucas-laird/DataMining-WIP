HORRIBLE SERVICE! food disgusting    nothing remembered CPK artichoke spinach dip cold then took back put microwave still gross pizza no flavor just glump cheese didn't even taste   WILL BACK   save yourself frustration  <EOR> Great food service more expensive then LA locations but reasonable Vegas  Great location casino around along sports book atmosphere <EOR> My wife stopped dinner before late Cirque du Soleil show  seated promptly but then service relatively slow  looked if server many tables   One nice feature half restaurant overlooks giant sports betting area which fun watch lots games once     We both ordered cocktails both thought extremely strong  Some people may being served extra alcohol drinks but could barely taste mixers  drinking straight vodka   My Kung Pow Spaghetti good but everything else just average  Nevertheless if hungry reasonably priced place dinner Mirage  <EOR> Everytime fly through Vegas always end California Kitchen when waiting board flight   Like most business folks am need quick meal use free wifi tap into laptop   I always seem asked sit bar even though plenty open tables dining room specifically designed single travelers one two chairs per table    I always insist having table work space   This visit overcharged food given incorrect order  When informed waitress she gave incorrect order she told she'd take back  bill still came incorrect request refund   I know having 'rush' people come through bit hectic but really dislike being treated cattle  isn't difficult order right well bill  Most people would care being charged $3 4 more but never should've occured first place  <EOR> First things first! food decent    Nothing spectacular  just every other CPK to  only difference being hiked prices because restaurant being located Strip  expected however service received not!  I met few friends visiting town some dinner  friends arrived before able booth almost immediately  Great! arrived few minutes later already waters table  told server wasn't brought waters table just told hostess she would few minutes  fact another server named Alberto kind enough keep refilling waters throughout meal  Alberto awesome? A few minutes turned into almost 20 server finally came back table  She didn't even introduce herself seem very friendly  top off felt rushed when she taking order  She just overall very personable  order came table decent amount time but also ask complimentary bread assuming supposed served upon arrival table  Hmmm    Maybe not? order arrived only seen server once throughout meal  last time saw when she dropped check off table!   Anyways experience mediocre feel could've much better server bit more mindful vibe she putting off  being said probably won't returning location again  <EOR> I've more times care claim but tell why sometimes end here   1 never when wait always breeze out   2 often hungry when am sports book if sit back bar CPK TVs watch sports eat same time   3 people nice back bar chat dine but annoying way   4 If just want salad maybe cup soup great option because CPK does overall pretty consistently good salads I love Cobb    5 easy lower priced option other places around   cheap but sometimes just don't feel getting big fancy meal just here   I am sure back again   Just note never pizzas CPK but am sure you'd expect look good   vouch soup salad  <EOR> We normally love CPK back home  However prices inflated staff friendly appetizer cold undercooked  coming location again  <EOR> This chain inside Mirage Casino great because located near entrance facing strip  sports book next door but still don't smell all cigarette smoke here  gone during lunch enjoy soup salad pizza deal  usually sat fast servers friendly food timely manner <EOR> Veronica might worst server ever had  sports book next store many tvs?

My friend hungry suggested share pizza Pear Gorgonzola   good plenty both could finished it  $15 two turned much better deal buffet which would $90 two!    I would detour come CPK anymore but still acceptable option! <EOR> The food same any CPK location  location overpriced crowded loud under staffed just worth walking through smoky casino to  can't really fit party more 6 without splitting group  <EOR> I ordered pesto chicken pizza ate red velvet cake there  moist soft but frosting little bit sweet me  While waiting bar pizza waiter confused gave pizza customers dining in  waited another ten fifteen extra minutes pizza but worth wait  <EOR> Good food but ate $18 pizza myself could continued  Overpriced even Vegas opinion  <EOR> Ate 12 26 16 second night during four day vacation  Place pretty busy but seated within short amount time  Took little bit time drink order took even more time drinks  Once came lady refilling them very attentive friendly saw more often waitress   Everything ordered including complimentary bread took long time arrive table  Food  good would better if hadn't taken quite long  Overall decent experience quite good amount televisions great view sport book area TV's well which perfect watching Cowboys Lions game night    Might give another try next time sure  <EOR> No complaints food but service another story  never given complimentary bread when arrived when manager came pizza ordered asked if could some bread  He very rudely asked if requested waitress because apparently location special request   location many times before never request it  But regardless then politely asked if could some  He very rude especially being manager during time  Couple minutes later see waitresses bringing bread tables surrounding us  asked some tables if did special request bread if just given them  Shocker   it just given them!
