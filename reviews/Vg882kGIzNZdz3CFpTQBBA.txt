Pan? Cutting board?It such huge disappointment  love furikake but couldn't passed spam  mention musubi wasn't even wrapped properly  No excuse popular 808 staple   basic right   Husband comes manapua  He said super apologetic undercooked pork hash working it  Cool manapua! Husband comes back time hawaiian sun's passion orange  looking laughing why heck everytime walk in then walk out something? seriously apologetic twas another peace offering    We both absolutely appreciated hospitality service because mishap  Even more because time hubs come new batch pork hash gave 5pcs vs 2 originally ordered  thought very nice gesture between manapua free drink extra pork hash  husband said guy working really nice because efforts makeup pork hash why giving them 3 stars  extra star service    2 stars food  always feel bad giving low ratings especially local stops even more local because they're Hawaii but food all nothing special  wasn't enthusiastic any it  manapua itself didn't much flavor although twas warm bottom of manapua dry verge being stale  abandoned   What appreciate can't really find pork hash manapua around valley especially if need some Hawaii nostalgia  having them around may such folks  mean caAAan but cant  feel same chow fun  char siu chow fun did even look appetizing  felt chow fun just needed couple more minutes being stir fried  But  just me  abandoned too   They've only open since Feb 18 course they'll need time adjust  just fell super short us   seriously having bad taste pork mouth today between spam undercooked pork hash char siu chow fun currently scarred  don't think ever return especially having other hawaiian spots closer proximity   Give them shot because person's failed experience does dictate another person experience  always say doesn't hurt try  Just sure your food cooked!
