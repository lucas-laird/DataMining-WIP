Tasted good though overly dry bill came $35 p which didn't think bargain based had   So guess really depend comfortable feel but money spent think could asked more   just didn't feel $35 p type place experience   Table for 1 Factor Perfect good sized bar atmosphere fits bill just right  <EOR> I absolutely love place!  The atmosphere welcoming laid back still very attentive  If want some great food reasonable price come here  expect when think bar food  Jake bartenders especially above beyond customers    Been coming awhile regular basis won't stop  Always something new happening great live music food specials   place gives lot like  Thanks 7777  <EOR> Still love bar come every Wednesday kickball least more night week  Besides Uffe Wednesdays there's karaoke Thursday through Saturday which great time  Jake still killing behind bar treat right he'll take care no other bartender town  <EOR>
