I ordered Kalbi Bulgogi beef tongue  Unlike other Korean BBQ's San Toki snow bunny only gives whopping three side dishes any additional side dishes $2 $6 more  Even rice charged  surprised didn't charge water chopsticks  Now wrong charge more items? No but people accustomed traditional Korean BBQ's going different expectations business failed manage expectations Korean BBQ typically is  only did live price but failed portions  kalbi cut away bone cut into tiny little cubes which great presentation but wasted unnecessary step  All 3 dishes failed feed two yet alone 4 people    Now onto flavor no idea place survive other unsuspecting out of town naive tourist no idea Korean BBQ should taste but suppose  proposed business model plan surviving because taste quality isn't it  couldn't even deliver sauces because  tasted bad because decided some sort FUSION gochujang type sauce instead   After coming restaurant wonder if other restaurants also bad one  If could only assume if they're superficial restaurant won't able expand outside Vegas sustain itself unless act together  also wonder if any principle's behind company even work any restaurants  highly doubt it   The biggest insult when person appeared manager inquired did food knew once opened mouth everybody else would want sink down into seat but honest say worst Korean BBQ ever   response well  unfortunate but  odd because TOP KOREAN CHEF LAS VEGAS   course laughed now take pity Las Vegas having such bad Korean food because if  best Vegas feel people Nevada  He also asked Korean BBQ restaurants mentioned half dozen K town guy just back business trip Korea he treated Korean BBQ dept heads divisions Hyundai  guess response fairly reasonable response seemed somewhat slightly valid  <EOR> I've 2 times dinner  place better most Korean restaurants Chinatown think  First time ordered bulgogi seafood pancake teriyaki chicken   We'd cooked bulgogi ourselves came large salad  Food pretty good  Second time them cooked bulgogi ordered fried tofu appetizer  fried tofu could more crispier think  second time gave lot side dishes  bulgogi came fish soup soybean kimchi soup small salad  lot more side dishes first time  sure why  negative thing having them cook bugogi way much onion meat bit fatty  Overall food still pretty good  <EOR> Pretty good place can't argue hours its open til 4am everyday    Same owners Kaizen Sushi Red Mango     The food pretty good combo meal specials parties 2 3 pretty reasonable   wife ordered The San combo which included ton stuff including kimchee pancake 3 meats   stuffed beyond belief     The atmosphere decor pretty nice although say quality food Mother's Korean BBQ still bit better place   Still solid choice late night food but best   service also quite good although only ones eating 11pm when there! <EOR> Walked group friends refused venture neighborhood half decent Korean restaurants  finally persuaded them least check menu pricing before seated  SIDE DISHES ban chan RICE AVAILABLE ADDITIONAL CHARGE never walked place fast   The nerve  <EOR>
