One thing downside green red circle table    Red means stop bringing meats want just relax bit eat have   Green means keep coming   However even when red food just kept coming   waiter told twice thought maybe weren't understanding it   But asking bus boys awesome realized using correctly but just weren't paying attention!  really why all?! <EOR> can't split check  large groups but food good  3rd try still don't card back correct ticket  show starts thirty minutes may miss it  <EOR> Yuckie  Las Vegas piss poor trip general     I think only reason place gets business because right elevators where rooms because food gross    1  cuts meats poor  2  sides disgusting   I taste creamed spinach beans rice    gross flavoured spiced really badly  salad give overdressed 3  service poor best    It reminds Walmart steak places   unless Walmart   then feel sorry your taste level    AVOID AVOID AVOID    <EOR> To start review almost didn't happen because almost walked restaurant   review might long but worth reading if want know getting yourself into   We came Samba around 5 30 ask later reservation   asked return 8 15   8 15 comes table ready yet    fine   play some slots kill some time then check again 15 minutes later   Still ready   eventually led back room restaurant   We grab seats given menus   already chosen wanted due waiting front seated   20 minutes later no come even give water   now full hour reservation time   Only difference now hour hungrier!  Husband sets timer iPhone   He says when hits two minutes we're walking  minute 50 seconds bus boy walks circles back talk us   Maybe he sensed hungry anger?  He asked if helped immediately brought water   He told server Roxanne Roxanna she'd right over   Not long same bus boy comes back table bringing waiter him     James would waiter remainder meal he really saved evening us   He pleasant sweet apologetic getting lost shuffle   big when stores restaurants whatever step admit messed helped   We placed order   Husband also Brasilian Brasil brother order rodizio $40 each   don't eat meat lobster tail   First thing come pão de queijo otherwise known cheese bread some sort crackers   Pão de queijo pretty amazing but some garlic going inside?  wasn't quite right   good but wahhh wished more traditional   If sound brat it   Brasilian BBQ restaurant   Along bread came some vinaigrettes sauces   pico de gallo other phenomenal garlic vinaigrette     For appetizers ordered beef empanadas coconut shrimp   Both delicious   shrimps HUGE!!    Before meat came given plate salad   lot time actually passes before your meat   I'd suggest skipping appetizers speed process   almost they're trying fill before meat comes but since pay much feel some sort obligation eat ton meat anyway walk feeling fat tick pop     The salad okay but already mixed heavy dressing it   Most Brasilian BBQ places astounding salad bars but here   After salad all sides came out   Rice black beans plantains creamed spinach     All really delicious     The meats started rotating lobster tail came out   Again all good   So other weird pão de queijo round cheese breads all food great   service beginning wretched   price paid could think least dozen other places we'd rather spent money   So while food good we'd still return  <EOR> I first Samba 2005  husband eat almost every trip Las Vegas  family members order off menu enjoyed meals but rodizio way here  start salad bread  Then bring your side items glazed carrots plantains creamed spinach rice beans  love carrots plantains  typical meat offerings sausages chicken wings bacon wrapped turkey sirloin steak flank steak lamb teriyaki chicken pork pineapple  pork pineapple favorite part  pineapple honey glazed before cook fantastic! Definitely highlight  also garlic bread vegetables now  pricey $35 per person but hungry because worth it  <EOR> The food wasn't horrible  The service decent  But none four good sized men could even think eating $40 worth meat  Our group together birthday dinner while fun experience doubt would ever back seeing multitude dining experiences awaits Las Vegas  We did partake any drinks mentioned other reviews but wondering if also overpriced bit extra alcohol just help blow price slices meat served  We found ribs sizzling hot all tasty  other meats acceptable but think try something else next time  <EOR> Pretty pricey quality food  7 8 skewers brought only enjoyed brown sugar glazed meat all others very bland just good all! We experience even reading all 2 3 stars  wish would taken most yelper's advise  don't did! somewhere else!!!

 bit pricey side but if Rodizio eat decent amount worth it    They brought around various meats cooked different ways  Everything cooked well full flavor  am picky eater didn't enjoy salad came meal very much   fried plantains looked good but bf said incredibly sweet  I mild allergy bananas couldn't try them bread dipping sauces very flavorful though  would eat again certain  <EOR> Similar Texas de Brazil rotating selection cut right the stick at your table meats   good   bit overwhelming   think ate way more body wanted to   figure Brazilian meat restaurant just good another   wanted try Texas de but now feel unnecessary push stomach its absolute limits again   Thanks experience but no thanks  <EOR> Ok back Vegas again last week business   Samba always first place start craving eat whenever Vegas usual again first night town   Although Rodizio meat served continuously servers carrying skewers around most popular thing order and really very good terms variety taste portion    but always eat much when all u can eat thing     So did plan b when totally ravenous   I ordered Mahogany Glazed Salmon   salmon AWESOME prepared different way ever Salmon anywhere else   exactly sure what's Mahogany glaze but sure Salmon dee licious!
