It obvious hadn't cleaned table completely yet hostess just took napkin call attention packets   Basically everything ok not good   When done decided wait few seconds watch them clean table left  just picked dishes napkins wiped any area covered hard reach  Since big placemats cleaned anything all crumbs left them  Also area check never wiped nor other diagonal side because would meant walking around table clean other side   So get's 1 star less minimum cleanliness required  <EOR> Always delicious !!

Amazing   called over manager told going all issues breakfast having waiter walking away worst   manager told waiter new thought taking off price entree should recover damage     asked more coffee told whole thing terrible rather insulting service part the waiter just stood 10' away never acknowledged anything     left 0 0% tip which never left realizing choosing Casanova breakfast big mistake morning    never seen waiter just walk away calmly answering question if all great    Anyways skip place breakfast dinner might different story  <EOR> My beef lasagna yummy  husband veal piccata great  Salad ordinary  nice little place won't break bank  <EOR> We waited 1 hour receive entree wrong  When asked speak manager disapproval he showed blew off If want leave ahead unacceptable but probably don't care  total waste time  <EOR> It wasn't horrible but wasn't fantastic either   service quite slow   ordered wild mushroom ravioli wasn't bad but better   great try once but wouldn't stopping again next stay Venetian  <EOR> Food fair unfortunately very good value   Servers attentive saving grace   Unfortunately hostess needs think if she really wants work could just bad day her  <EOR> I love coming restaurants where feel welcomed Casanova definitely those! Thank Jaime evelyn great customer service  Jaime definitely very well educated menu knew exactly craving  keep good work Casanova! <EOR> We ordered clams lamb  Food good flavor just tad over cooked lamb dry  waitstaff nice but thought hostesses rude  When came noon told closed then seemed 5 minutes later opened   felt though she could told time opening since obviously later time website  Overall see why others say just mediocre   nice quick bite lunch but would pick somewhere else dinner since already here  <EOR> This place solid 4 stars  would even give 4 1 2  located inside Grand Canal Shops area inside Venetian Palazzo  ordered seafood linguine $24 red sauce  pasta perfectly al dente  scallops shrimp clams mussels fresh  Shrimp scallop good size  Nice generous portions but overly huge  Red tomato sauce little spicy delicious! Hubby ordered lasagna $16 which also tasty generous portion  pricing dishes very reasonable excellent quality ingredients especially given location  Neighboring Italian restaurants same shopping areA charging twice much per plate!  even allow charge room if staying Venetian! server attentive courteous  only reason am giving 5 stars because tables located close together little noisy shoppers passing  <EOR> First off friends stellar deal Tix4Tonight ended dining Casanova ridiculously good price! highly recommend getting deal  friends Las Vegas conference last night wanted celebrate going somewhere nice  made reservations prior arriving seated promptly patio area  While good amount traffic within Venetian did take away experience    For dinner splurged Lamb Chops  lamb cooked perfectly but fan whatever seasoning I think seasoning pistachios but entirely sure   found myself wanting more oomph bursts flavor  say rice pilaf rather bland but somehow all worked dish    Service great attentive! Overall solid Vegas restaurant! I'd definitely recommend others visiting but must deal!   <EOR> Eggplant Massuka Greek Pasta heavenly     After eating just want lie down savour flabours   No Babydoll   <EOR> First last time come here  waiting food over 45 mins doesn't appear if soon  Bald guy guess he manager nice but nice doesn't fill belly  House bread gone now patience  <EOR> This place just alright    expected much better quality food being Venetian   dinner then breakfast following day   ordered burrata tomato appetizer flatbread dinner   appetizer good just $14 worth   very small portion   Only three slices tomato   flatbread flatbread all just pizza   under cooked lacked flavor   next day looking find breakfast Sat 11 30 am most places stopped serving breakfast except place   breakfast bad    thought getting good deal ordering combo eggs hash browns bacon sausage pancakes french toast toast  mean wrong basics?

The food isn't even great anyway  remember pasta alright but nothing particularly memorable  Definitely pass place breakfast $15 steak eggs frozen hash browns  should just gone McDonalds! <EOR> La mejor opción posible para tomarse un respiro de las hamburguesas y las ribs y probar unas buenas pastas en Las Vegas  Escondido por el Venetian no creo que pueda encontrarlo en menos de 20' de dar vueltas no tiene demasiadas sillas pero lo vale   Me pedí un 'farfalle' quiero decir trenzas o raviolones pero no quiero versear con salmón arvejas y salsa de vodka que es una locura  Los platos llenan mucho incluso los que no parecen tan abundantes  Los linguini mare nostrum tambien eran otra bomba   Los postres muy buenos aunque había poca selección y también tenían varios cócteles de postre el chocolate martini destaca    La atención es normal tal vez un poco más acelerada de lo usual  Si bien siempre se estila entregar la cuenta rápido en este restaurant parecían más apurados todavía   Los precios son un poco más elevados que los demás restaurantes de los casinos pero no demasiado  Siempre se puede recurrir los tickets de descuento y la verdad que Casanova lo vale  <EOR> Extremely bad food which overly priced  Greek pasta frozen food served almost cold Parmesan cheese  suggest visiting place vegetarian food instead eat chipotle next door  <EOR> The service great   bread steak lobster supreme all tasty  Recommend place if aren't mood buffet <EOR> I staying Venetian hoping find reasonably priced Italian option good quality place seemed nice fit   arrived 8 30 pm  Wednesday promptly seated   seated outside restaurant proper decent amount ambient mall noise but overwhelmingly loud here   some background music playing well barely audible   I started burrata arugula which disappointing   two thin slices tomatoes devoid flavor other taste cheese salad bland   mozzarella cheese creamy tasty but sufficient balsamic reduction add some complexity   While waiting entrée munched bread which burnt crust which gave bitter taste bread warm room temperature    butter foil wrapped those individual packets but least soft texture easy spread   For entrée ordered lobster supreme which pan seared lobster tail shrimp bed linguini   dish pretty good some minor flaws however   lobster little overcooked difficult pry meat off shell since did provide those tiny lobster forks   most part shrimp perfectly cooked but two pieces overcooked   pasta el dente tomato based sauce very yummy   best part meal portion decent sized   I free cannoli dessert because filled Yelp review   dessert pretty disappointing tasty   First all pastry rock hard impossible eat using spoon   ask knife cut pastry into bite sized pieces  dessert weird chalky texture   Service good waiter friendly   Overall cost $60 appetizer entrée free dessert   expected more terms quality given abundance good eating options around  <EOR> I wish could give 2 5 instead    But since can't decided nice round up  But if you're here   would recommend other smaller Italian restaurant across room  more homey feeling while restaurant more fancy classy feeling it  Anyways    restaurant Service excellent  helped round up  pretty nice attentive    Location Venetian near food court  see fancy table setting far away haha   Food My friend both fettuccini Casanova recommended waitress   both didn't it  pretty bland fettuccini    texture bit off  could told them didn't ask another dish    But honestly just didn't feel didn't bother  work food industry gauged feelings wasn't worth trouble Angel hair pasta sure if name but friends really loved dish  Shrimp ravioli tried off friends  Delish!
