Very disappointed OVER CHARGE dietary restrictions substitutions  Since when does sense sub prosciutto broccoli florets $5 charge? Well $5 maybe 6 broccoli florets entire dish  Felt being nickled dimed  known importing broccoli Mars blessed holy water could've Trader Joe's across way brought own save money  Anyways ordered gluten free version penne ala vodka  item comes prosciutto  server informed would even receiving anything close menu item already priced $30  No vodka no prosciutto no pink sauce  receiving? Still no idea day  server such attitude problem everything start should've known wasn't going pleasant experience  also put order Cesar salad starter no croutons  asked if could add onions salad  Insert eye roll server here  She finished taking order walked away  salad arrived pasta 30 mins later! server made sure bob weave away answer any questions  She did want come explanation why took 30 mins starter salad arrive! really nice busser kind enough refill waters provide 5 year old daughter bread  husband food come before daughters basic spaghetti marina! Everyone knows serve kids food first before adults especially when simple pasta marina already cooked back  Alas server unaware such hospitality  flagged down asking where daughters food she said oh lemme check never came back  friendly busser came rescue daughters food  finished meal asked check  shocked see $6 charge gluten free pasta $5 charge broccoli  asked server why expensive if technically penne ala vodka substitute broccoli  She said policy  Wooooow  then noticed charge $3  asked about? She said onions salad?!?!?! you're telling $4 put 6 onion slices small cedar? farmed table very instance? universe acceptable? managed some high end restaurants bar manager others none standards would've acceptable  Broccoli nowhere near price prosciutto  Why would charge someone vodka sauce if they're getting vodka sauce? She might well charged steak said well same thing  round off crap night ask server 3 times if she could sing happy birthday daughter  She brought cannoli no candle anything  She busy even acknowledge kid smile very least  She set plate before did even try light candle  She just walked off! Two tables down someone else's birthday know? wonderful server whole restaurant sing joyous happy birthday them smile! Must've nice feeling  Explain why she's hospitality business again? Thanks horrible memory special day  waste your time money place unless you're masochist love flushing money down drain  other Italian places downtown summerlin wolf gang puck  always treat respect never charge extra  <EOR> I really hoping place  seen Venetian many times always crowded  now realize filled tourists most likely one time only patrons  food kind flat monotonous  marinara sauce bland  beautiful restaurant if bit pretentious  sense place run heavy handed egotistical owner manager cannot see through its problems  watched management while dining seemed stern unaccommodating  waiter very friendly almost much so  probably try again just case bad day  All all however disappointed  <EOR> A friend wanted try place reluctant  I am GLAD said OK! dinner really great   I ordered caesar cheese tortellini    I know little boring feeling classic don't judge! LOL   caesar dressing creamy flavorful  think tortellini homemade  sure if made right but way tasted very homestyle! Yes good thing!  My friend Arugula Salad good! better caesar spaghetti carbonara  Delish well   For desert piece chocolate cake big head! judging again! LOL    It GOOD!!! no did even eat 1 2 it! Although wanted to!   Great place busy because Downtown Summerlin catching new spot play eat! If thinking weekend night suggest making reservations <EOR> Wow  First time last time  Reservations 6 45  Seated 7 30  Service terrible  ordered primavera pizza  Soggy tasteless  Sent back ordered Bolognese  Husband ordered Scampi  Pasta undercooked tasteless  Shrimp ok  Terrible experience  lady came dog sat chair overheard lady owner  Wow  <EOR> Great food pizza  drinks amd service Moscow Mule excellent Garlic bread appatizer olives awesome!!   eggplant Parmesan which good but sauce very Sweet boarding Chef Boyardee vibe!! entertainment outdoor patio nice bonus DTS   Hey Trattoria please just overhaul your red sauce 5th star!! <EOR> Food great!  First time here   quick bite between showing homes today   Joli split chicken parm sandwich   perfect 2   server Ricki great!  Thank you! <EOR> My first review restaurant October some friends everything delicious   Well time   While service good good last time   Last time brought plate cheese roasted peppers red green black olives fantastic   time only those green olives plate when asked waiter more other colors he found few more green ones said all which find hard believe   Last time garlic knots wonderful   time very doughy undercooked although very brown top   same meal baked ziti while last time delicious time could hardly eat it   other meals just ok   Nothing rave last visit   Towards end meal sat very large party behind although really wasn't enough room waitress kept bumping into every time she through   point she told needed move chair in   If getting ready leave definitely would said something   I also think prices higher priced menu because during holidays but tell probably going back there  <EOR> Great service Ricki even better food  sure order calamari  garlic knots hint good pizza must be  Penne ala vodka great subtile guiancale flavor it  Linguine white clam sauce perfectly seasoned slightly thick bodied sauce deep complexity  clams shell ocean fresh impeccably clean plentiful  linguine prepared perfectly al dente  Service light breeze barely noticeable but just appreciated  Consider re training your hostess requested quiet table she attempted seat front restroom! <EOR> Tried place first time last night liked it  seated outside little chilly but least heaters it  garlic bread delicious great way start your meal  chicken francese really enjoyed it  chicken cooked right tender juicy while pasta alright  pretty awesome live performer well when went  see place great place date night  <EOR> What major disappointment!  ordered penne primavera served sitting warm water  no flavor all   pointed waiter replaced also taken off bill   replacement ok but flavorful enough bring back   truly wonder if food quality dependent kitchen   reviews 5 stars blah   also ordered kale peanut salad which acidic taste   two stars only waiter Giovanni would give five stars but don't want anyone think food   think management needs better job leaves kitchen table  <EOR> Walking away standing hostess station 3 mins while being stared kitchen staff seated acknowledged    Guess don't want business  <EOR> The service top notch  No complaints drinks always filled brother took last sip beer just waiter asked if he'd another  Really top things  However    prices charge food little ridiculous  chicken parm while good just your regular chicken parm worth $26  salmon mom dry flavorless  pesto gnocchi sister super bland  pizza brother good but didn't really much terms flavor  entire meal definitely over priced  Italian band playing too  voice nice but really loud  barely talk each other without screaming  kinda threw all off  Maybe would better ambience date? But family  won't back unfortunately  <EOR> We three times all three times very disappointed   service great but seafood dishes very disappointing!  first time ordered linguini clams  least six clams didn't open sauce bland flavorless clams very fishy taste smell   did give additional clams but half them broken shells led believe took ones didn't open just broke shells clams out  didn't eat them because if clam shell doesn't open its own because clam already dead knows long dead   Second time shrimp scampi  shrimp over cooked but stuffed!?  breading stuffed soaking oil   no delightful garlic wine sauce just butter stuffing   removed stuffing ate six seven shrimp   The third time ordered shrimp linguini red sauce   shrimp tasted very fishy again red sauce utterly bland! extremely disappointing     My husband veal parmesan said good except veal wasn't pounded down thickness little off putting thick breading covered veal   He also another visit carbonara he liked lot third visit he baked ziti thought very good but meatballs  horrible   Our friend lobster ravioli pink sauce   pink sauce very mild flavor he said okay   The garlic knot bread good service good   manager owners ask everything always say good but just don't negative remarks front customers review more them just pray read it     We love everything restaurant but seafood dishes need major overhaul need remake meatball recipe  <EOR> Food good but service terrible  Took over hour food  don't suggest coming unless three hours spare time eat half decent italian meal  <EOR> A friend mine recommended place me  hesitant first but then just decided try out  very pleased  husband 9 yr old son  Gnocci al Pesto and   OH  MY  GOD  delicious  husband Baked Ziti Meatballs looked good taste it  Oh cheesy goodness! son pepperoni pizza normal 9 yr old boy food  He loved too! He ate more half which miracle itself because he's big eater  server Theresa very nice very pleasant  restaurant small quaint but felt authentic welcoming  couldn't happier experience definitely returning soon   especially since new favorite Italian restaurant Las Vegas  even more Maggiano's  <EOR> This restaurant great food great service great ambiance  love garlic knots instead bread  server nice funny  love open kitchen classy decor throughout restaurant  food delicious  The chocolate cake AMAZING! <EOR> Nice restaurant very good service  Food good  Pizza seems best menu item  Garlic knots very good  Baked ziti good  Portion sizes decent  Surprisingly filet meatballs weren't good thought would caprese presented nicely but lacking flavor  <EOR> Came dinner family friend's wedding  ordered your way strawberry  send back since awful but Italian sangria  much better  ordered swordfish  Freakin delicious  bf ordered chicken parmigiana  tasty but nothing special it  Other people table ordered lasagna said best Italian food they've ever had linguine bolognese couldn't stop chowing down linguine clam sauce said clams delightful  All in all great experience  Very kind attentive staff  <EOR> The original Trattoria Reggiano location inside Venetian pretty popular 4 star average long remember  when first arrived new second location wasn't shocking hear we'd little bit wait 30 45 minutes even Sunday 7pm  But wasn't until nearly hour fifteen minutes later walked seated patio might smallest restaurant Downtown Summerlin    Up until seated only other party put name down wait  time waited place really started clear shortly seated only handful tables sat  place pretty much dead  But whatever reason table 6 people whole staffs attention  whole time waited table during whole meal  Obviously very close friends family someone associated restaurant  Food coming them waves nearly every staff member waiting them hand foot  took 20 minutes just waiter come over being sat throughout meal didn't improve  Drinks food took forever come ask refills multiple times guy seemed barely know menu  put lightly service sucked  Even if every waiter new restaurant enough experience shouldn't untrained staff even crappy service general    When comes menu looks pretty much exactly same original location  variety classic Italian dishes some pizza seafood etc  Pricing doesn't seem any different average style Italian restaurant    We brought order complimentary garlic knots  flavor actually pretty good good texture but holy friggin' grease  things felt made then just rolled oil  also brought little pepper olive cheese tray  okay but glad didn't pay either  really impressive start   I pretty much already made mind going order before even came here  filet meatballs sound good usually great reviews  ordered spaghetti meatballs  noodles cooked well obviously hand made anything but decent  really let down meatball  I'd say mentioning filet mignon title just way sucker into ordering them  If filet mignon them amount little impossible taste  really just taste straight pork meatballs no seasoning  $14 appetizer order meatballs $18 spaghetti meatballs should no doubt filet mignon them  supposed house made pomodoro sauce alright but far $18 plate   At point done even thinking trying dessert  But most table wanted dessert oddly enough best thing place  Sort of  homemade chocolate cake looks just garbage Claim Jumper serves passed trying that  tiramisu excellent though really saving grace night  I'd literally come back just would likely try ricotta cheesecake too   Maybe expected much   but pretty dang successful restaurant Venetian all places thought TR would lot more offer  Long waits horrible service below average food just wasn't hoped for  <EOR> This place excellent! spaghetti meatballs best ever had  staff very nice helpful  husband both enjoyed food definitely back again! <EOR> One favorite places eat lunch Downtown Summerlin  Rikki always attentive friendly  She knows eat prepared  Always great experience  <EOR> One new additions Downtown Summerlin dining scene  dining room nicely decorated warm colors brightly lit  outdoor patio comfortable seating  some privacy adjacent foot traffic  Ceiling fans overhead heaters year round venue  Our party four chose patio evening  seated immediately welcomed several staff members  server Amanda attentive helpful  She attitude felt she truly interested providing great service  Amanda along associates  followed throughout meal   The complementary dinner rolls bottles olive oil balsamic vinegar provided  table  ordered Filet Mignon Meatballs starter  three large meatballs plenty sharing  shaved Parmigiano Reggiano offered topping  Four different entrees ordered  Eggplant Parmigiana  layered traditional pomodoro sauce lots melted mozzarella  Chicken Caesar Salad included several large pieces grilled chicken  Lobster Ravioli topped shrimp sauteed pink sauce white wine  ravioli pillows just melted your mouth shrimp tender juicy  Chicken Francese breast sauteed lemon white wine sauce touch butter served spaghetti  Both Eggplant Chicken Francese especially large resulted some take home  All entrees cooked perfectly satisfaction  Freshly shaved Parmigiano Reggiano also offered topping entrees  Two desserts ordered sharing  Ricotta cheese cake moist long lasting cheese flavor  tiramisu served goblet two sticks cookies  saucer which goblet sits drizzled caramel sauce  location caramel adds eye appeal but scooping easy  would rate tiramisu just OK   One note restrooms  restaurant size should more restroom  waited line server mentioned public restroom next door restaurant  woman behind decided check but she returned say line longer  <EOR> Came lunch  ordered Pasta Fagioli soup  favorite soup far best ever ate    then Spaghetti Aglio E Olio surprisingly I felt very small portion but very flavorful  side meatballs  which consisted 2 nice size meatballs  Everyone own preference meatball should made taste  perfect! husband chicken parmigiana spaghetti chicken huge   He said good  server Ricki she great  Though quite expensive     $70 00 lunch! no dessert no drinks except soda enjoyed food service  <EOR> The food delicious service awesome prices little much opinion    I also agree restaurants charge gluten free options  Being gluten free some isn't just some fad diet  charge $5 gluten free options  fair those no choice being gluten free   why gave 3 stars  <EOR> Best place downtown summerlin food quality! place small but nice!   All items ordered fresh tasted amazing! travel even if no plans DT summerlin   recommend everyone!  I recommend reservation due lack size <EOR> The food very nice service second none  But never order glass wine only quarter glass $11 Zinfandel  good  food also little high someone tell them strip  second time return loan bank  LOL  Give try just bring little extra cash  first time came love still do  just don't remember pricey  <EOR> The second star garlic knots  ordered pizza  lived NYC great pizza  wanting try place while  exaggerating pizza came table cold soaking flimsy wet noodle  Literally cold wet noodle  crust incredibly thin floppy wet cold started take photo review BUT before could woman collapsed restaurant hit head wasn't getting up  Please understand next part read carefully sitting far end restaurant ridiculous amount servers working place  two servers customer  least 15  bartender servers hostess manager just stood stunned sheep first person call 911  running across restaurant myself obviously no kind training place emergency situation  People acted hero merely possessing common sense  ambulance showed took woman away general manager commended comped entire bill  explained pizza issue he acted he knew embarrassed but here's kicker guy New York    and he allows kitchen serve sloppy cold pizza!? But hey free garlic knots incredible! <EOR> Great Italian restaurant! Last time antipasto platter penne la vodka which both amazing! Tonight's calamari baked ziti equally good! Friendly staff very personable! Bethany bar awesome great suggestions! Easy see why many regulars bar recognized name !  Can't wait back! <EOR> The food ok nothing write home about   large party several different items   biggest problem why giving them 2 stars bartender apparently doesn't know Blue Moon the original wheat is   both regular wheat menu seasonal which white IPA   told wanted original Blue Moon which he proceeded argue telling Blue Moon IPA  He said they'd getting people complaining because thought wasn't IPA    because most definitely not!!  He assured regular Blue Moon ordered one   seasonal   didn't want argue any further just let someone else table drank it     I hope management take review into account train staff difference here   isn't uncommon beer most places carry taste completely different type beer means your lines mixed your staff doesn't know they're serving   If you're regular  fine but don't try tell something drinking over 6 years something not!  Please see picture proof referring to  <EOR> This review 3 5 stars    Very good food good atmosphere but overall experience meal just didn't meet standard other location strip  he house specialty pasta which came red sauce sundried tomatoes spinach well gnocchi vodka sauce  Both pastas delicious fresh but extremely bland much going besides pasta sauce  guess  normal good Italian but usually enjoy busier dishes  bread garlic knots actually quite good devoured 2 especially dipping entree sauces  finally given complimentary olive pepper dish start just par  Drinks expensive very good frank  ordered Manhattan just alcohol thrown into glass no real craft  house wine $11 truly house wine  Meal came around surprisingly expensive $70  worth cost opinion service underwhelming well  But nonetheless strip type restaurant downtown Summerlin  <EOR> I think all started bad note wasn't recovery during visit    Asking guests wait outside until table inside ready aka 108 degrees while only 1 other table 4 seated restaurant should first clue bad start  Being pressured order= really hate that  first time needed some time  also confused why host asking order minutes sat down? If your host going take orders should know specials day! Alright awkward start     They bring Garlic knots generous appear very appetizing  Overly greasy soggy olive oil raw garlic flavor lighter oil some nice crisp bread would big improvement   Fella ordered meatball sandwich comes fries Caesar salad because already suspicious  AKA servers line cooks talking dates last night loudly table big empty restaurant doesn't feel kitchen strong game   food arrived quickly surprised little suspicious microwave? cheese appeared oddly coagulated melted but bubbly nice toasted meatball sam   The salad flavorful dressing but overdressed wasn't fan full anchovy presented top  Top off last bite sour tomato  Trying eliminate flavor mouth took some fries fella's dish sure enough oil strange taste  couldn't strange oil taste palette fries    My favorite things experience fresh flowers table Andes mint finally neutralized weird fry oil taste  <EOR> My boyfriend gave place 3 star review solely because food  looked really nice inside because Italian craving found spot something new try  food presented wonderfully but taste just doesn't match its good looks   To honest nothing special  food prices didn't seem really worth it  pasta mediocre pizza well    I think thing stood really friendly customer service server evening  She very attentive accommodating  While waited food she brought little tray cheeses olives snack on    I don't think we'll find ourselves again but wasn't bad place  Would recommend anyone else? No because wouldn't first Italian restaurant cross mind BUT if someone ask if should eat don't think would try dissuade them  <EOR> I'm torn between 2 3 stars  wasn't impressed but wasn't really disappointed  closer OK but definitely better  Everything just alright  tries hard but falls short  offer complimentary garlic bread antipasto plate  cheese plate good all  olives eh canned roasted peppers just that    canned   or jarred  whatever  fresh made  much enjoy free stuff free stuff thats good  I'd pass antipasto next time  There 8 tried bunch stuff  really enjoyed eggplant rolatini good  calmari OK but didn't think meatballs great way people raved them  ordered fruit de mare pasta dish  alright  I'd try something else next time if decided come back  couple bottles sangria half price during happy hour enjoyed that   I'm HUGE fan eggplant rolatini theirs good if did come back would that  Service alright  Cost you'd expect Summerlin  Oh mindful prices  differ menu menu  <EOR> The best thing might eat garlic knots  think came close eating two baskets worth all myself  didn't care if wreaked garlic I'd sweating pores next day pretty damn good  rest stuff tried    meh  menu typical Italian American food kind stuff you'll see million other spots  Perfect non adventurous eater  kind diner thinks eating national chain bit risky    The kitchen plays safe turns unremarkable food  Meatballs $14 made filet mignon pork loin mixture hard dense sauce lacked depth  small portion kale peanut salad $8 plenty share but underdressed dish reaching water wash down  end meal took turn better satisfying but uninspired lasagna $22 ground filet ricotta mozzarella   Kid menus available well  son's spaghetti ordered sans tomato sauce just butter sizable portion he devoured  Each kid's meal comes beverage mini cannoli   Located steps away movie theater Downtown Summerlin nice looking space large patio smaller expected interior bar open kitchen  food more paint numbers Monet but just good enough satisfy suburban customer base used eating recognizable Italian   2 5 Stars <EOR> Long time Las Vegas resident over 33 years must say wonderful place  Great food terrific ambiance service  Never disappointing meal pizza's spaghetti meatballs seafood more  Great bread olives peppers kick things off   Thanks! <EOR> Wow! Great food  Great atmosphere  without trying meatballs fabulous!
