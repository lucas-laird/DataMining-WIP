Walked Icy Juicy lunch saw couple reviews avocado slush decided order it  never avocado drink before but avocado slush boba delicious! avocado slush rich nutty flavor  boba very nice consistency chewy throughout tasted boiled brown sugar yum!   Came back second time order again because good   I also tried Rose Green Milk Tea quite fragrant! tried rose milk teas other boba shops but place best tasting one  really taste rose flavor tea but green tea flavor overpowering I'd probably just order Rose Milk Tea next time    Avocado Slush boba $5 45 $4 95 without boba Rose Green Milk Tea boba $4 75 $4 25 without boba Service pretty quick girl helped friendly  Visited Sunday afternoon Tuesday evening  <EOR> When Hawaii Polynesian Cultural Center selling vanilla ice cream topped w peaches strawberries   delicious!  husband found place through Yelp found similiar dessert posted   so figured give try   Sad say same one   looked very similar but did taste same   forgot exactly ordere but strawberry ice cream topped w mango   probably wasn't ice cream because texture lot different   just okay   husband peanut butter toast which fat piece bread w peanut butter spread   just okay also   Nothing really rave about   probably would back recommend friends  <EOR> They BEST passion fruit lychee boba!!! Whenever feel energetically drained come order feel much better! lychee also considered good luck fruit <EOR> Came craving fish balls epic fail moment walked in  Service sucks food came over hour later 2 bowls soup fishball skewer which raw undercooked  don't recommend place  If come just place order pick leeeeeave!!! <EOR> Met Icy Juicy some friends late lunch today  once before enjoyed shaved snow while playing card games  Definitely serve meals savory snacks desserts chill atmosphere   Their crispy pork rice came bento accompanied corn soy sauce marinated egg veggies some noodles  pork itself Taiwanese style seasoned tonkatsu balanced well veggies corn  awkward trying eat container fork knife but managed well enough finish food   Ordered large yogurt green tea boba which mixture green tea those Yakult like yogurt drinks Asian market  both tart tad bitter but better melted ice diluted drink  really consistency honey boba since cooked properly tasted lightly sweet   Spent $8 meal $4 50 drink  Well worth money since still full content type review seven hours later  <EOR> On hunt late night Sunday boba third only successful stop  Located same complex District parking usually rough but 1am pretty easy   Since only came boba great service  server nice order quick  boba  delicious!   Boo honey milk green tea very flavorful overly sweet  Share your suggestions if wrong but caramel milk tea something yet found other boba spots! also delicious pudding addition    I see during peak hours smokers around front deterring but off peak seems good place    Thanks helping Sunday night fix! <EOR> Some female employees rude no customer service skills  Doesn't greet when people come can't even smile!   Place always cramped very clean  Once sat table friends table very dirty milk tea spills already dried table     Drinks okay but tasted waaaaay better ones other places  Also parking terrible because plaza being small all businesses next each other aware!  Also always seemingly rush take your oder give your check rush asap tables turn faster    Overall place pretty much killed because mediocre customer service skills average taste drinks  <EOR> Their boba perfect only because chewy hate soft boba  jasmine milk tea strong tea taste generic type flavor  <EOR> This place okay  guess would say its younger crowd because saw whole bunch kids hanging there  Service whatevers weren't friendly but weren't rude either    I Royal Milk tea  Very good  husband Stawberry Slush Lychee jelly  good but tell used power kind  Lychee really sweet too    But made drinks really quickly  <EOR> My take steak burned    already second time! am supposed eat that! <EOR> My favorite milk tea place Las Vegas   place ideal catching friends hanging out   also desserts kitchen menu which great if feel little snack  <EOR> Was just there  Service horrible  Friend ordered kiwi strawberry slush tasted very sour  Tasted kiwi spoiled something around there  If forgot give boba don't tell them because just add some watery boba into your drink  Ordered snow ice which came different types fruit  Wasn't bad but mango tasted spoiled well  lychee jelly tasted very soury  forgot put order crispy chicken guess made hurry when chicken very soft no flavor it  Usually chicken taste very good but don't know if its new hired waitress just owner doesn't care store but won't coming anymore    To honest right orders immediately paid across street Fresh Cup which saved night  <EOR> this second time there  little disappointed time  girlfriend ordered milktea snow ice  good last time  ordered vegetables oil  portion unexpectedly small  some leftover other table  salty  told waiter salty then made another one  less salty but still salty  except vegetables everything fine  <EOR> This place sucks absolute embarrassment Taiwanese  drinks very ordinary nothing special but least its overpriced  crispy squid crispy chicken bland nothing street Taiwanese style  service horrible  Taiwanese friendly service but more mainland Chinese angry service  waitress didn't even let finish looking through menu  looking see if wanted order more she just snatched menu hand  F* place! Theres new place opened friend told better drinks  never dump ever again! <EOR> Absolutely love place  always mango slush boba chicken fingers  <EOR> I expecting service below average according previous reviews below but service received Icy Juicy great   received boba drink 3 mins drink delicious   getting boba Icy Juicy moving forward = <EOR> Rating 3 5 rounding 4 This good place hang talk some friends over bubble tea  price drinks aren't bad add less sugar if ask half sweetened  go to drink Strawberry Slush Smoothie which perfect blend sweet tart all strawberry  Since close convenient open late friends catch up  Although staff isn't super attentive give basics don't tell leave even when stay long periods time that's huge plus book!   The food itself satisfactory well  used work around area would time time lunch break  filling felt money's worth  The crispy chicken super yummy btw  meal version pretty bomb  regular version share your friends which pretty good too  As negative side experiences biggest thing smell  strong sewage smell seems permeate place people forever smoking RIGHT OUTSIDE DOOR which open half time   If you're seated close entrance smells cigarette sewage  If you're fortunate seated towards back just sewage smell  Sometimes gets quite crowded noisy but seems come territory plaza  Parking isn't always easy find especially if you're going more popular night  All all bad place  probably more often then when comes hanging friends side town  <EOR> This place alright  There's nothing special  nice place quick boba fix  boba just alright    Whenever night always super busy  During day lot slower much quieter  ton options food which includes lots appetizers such crispy chicken crispy squid french fries  opinion french fries way overpriced     Their juicy steak pretty good  usually half pepper half mushrooms  huge steak put noodles top which delicious!   I usually come chat friends just play cards hang out    The service usually horrible most workers speak English well  better just point things  Don't expect great service because won't give you  food so   The last time ordered milk tea  friend ordered Jasmine Milk Tea boba  price higher thought assumed new menu meant prices up  However girl charged boba  She already made drink didn't want create huge fuss demand new drink  minor inconvenience though  <EOR> all hype new taiwanese restaurant?!?!?!  am taiwanese know order test authenticity little disappointed   As all know actually no good taiwanese restaurants Vegas when everyone started talking place stop order some taiwanese popcorn chicken   DISAPPOINTED!  service nothing brag either     I probably going back anything else unless someone DRAGS there  <EOR> Yeah don't know all hype place about   The first time heard place when friend told Icy Juicy drinks comparable those Tea Station but cheaper price  Being boba lover am wanted try place myself  first time way home work wanted place order take out  When waitress handed menu literally tapping foot while perused menu if say Hurry you're wasting time! mind took less 2 minutes decide wanted  Then when reached wallet pay debit card she said can't use card purchases under $10 it could've $15 forgot   Nowhere cash register sign telling didn't accept cards orders under such such  Luckily did cash day otherwise would've game over    Their peppermint milk tea almost same Tea Station give them that  boba bit soft almost if sitting pot long  Prices decent $2 $4 drink  cooked dishes snack options but tried any far  Icy Juicy open late suppose alternative Tea Station but honestly don't see big deal about  Perhaps need give place another try  <EOR> prices cheaper tea planet station  It clean environment  <EOR> I'm glad place opened valley decent boba drinks prices off roof unlike Tea Station   recognized face when walked boba dude Tea Station now there   now shopping 168 don't need past Tea Station Volcano  back more drinks near future! <EOR> Icy Juicy great spot if want catch hangout your friends  playing cards other games play while waiting order  even music D   The menu plenty items choose such appetizers entrees drinks desserts  personal favorites Hot Almond milk tea Thai tea Honey Milk Toast Monster Toast which consist huge toasted bread ice cream strawberries ect   !

Hopefully last time bad mouth customer front them  just never know understand you! <EOR> Good boba but horrible service  workers rude lazy even when slow don't accommodate customers right away  take sweet ass time which horrible  Even making eye contact worker just waiting drinks made she still did take orders  <EOR> I really want place really do  drink variety taste place group friends there  only thing totally kills service people work there  If your whole group friends all don't order something you're going hear old Chinese guy insult Chinese behind tone tries subtle but fails    For drinks tastes good! drinks menu  When asked water smoothie tiny little cup filled warm water no ice no straw  didn't whole refill I'd say hour half? even requested waitresses refill    The staff buzzkill  Wat u want orduh  first thing said us  Oh Fobby Chinese angry tone  nothing against Fobby Chinese accent because family basically all Asia but least Fobby nice customers  Maybe o hallo u today? Duh weaduh duh nice day duh boba drink ya? Enjoy drinks hokay? Anyways group 10ish people? Everyone dissatisfied place just made all angry  Mood killer  ended going fresh cup right across street much better choice boba other things ! <EOR> This place okay boba drinks food  If come weekend usually packed service slow because there's only person takes order runs food takes to go orders    The wonton noodles isn't bad but tried better ones  <EOR> This place some best Boba drinks hands down! Especially Passion Fruit Jelly Ice  steak noodles plate dinner even lunch if you're hungry delicious! stay open late great place if you're about! <EOR> Came around 12 30AM fan all  place packed doesn't really sufficient spacing fever so  Let alone parking situation night disgustingly frustrating    Ordered few different things friends honey toast nutella ice cream  literally just bread chocolate sauce    I felt could just gone home same thing   The staff okay  weren't super friendly but they're outright rude    Overall definitely avoid going back considering many other places offer better things  <EOR> I discovered place Yelp thank fellow yelpers! decided give try    Having snow ice LA pleasantly surprised find place Las Vegas also offers delicious refreshing dessert  fresh fruit mochi toppings good  service good owner nice ask feedback seems appreciate your patronage   I'm going lie  little FOB y Chinese to English translations top sales instead best sellers  sala instead salad but tend overlook things because snow ice which comes green tea taro mango milk flavors good  told food good but haven't tried any yet take advantage free drink lunch entree offer next time   I would rate place solid 4 stars maybe little more  only wish offered even more authentic Taiwanese toppings rice balls fresh taro which could also used hot grass jelly   would definitely elevate 5  <EOR> Ordered to go place because hadn't eaten all day next door ordered sweet sour pork rice pretty disappointed  flavor good but very difficult around fact most pieces pork chunks bone cartilage  friend took bite actually caught throat  She dry heave just expel it  keep spitting pieces  difficult eat enjoyable since every bite taken caution waiting break tooth  Also familiar Asian foods much but when ordered sweet sour pork expected somewhat traditional sweet sour sauce but instead almost certain teriyaki sauce  good but ordered  sure ever back mainly because whim but still disappointed  also asked soy sauce which sure carry told staff member helping wouldn't need any  Aside huge portion sizes tons drink options  <EOR> I honestly disappointed because place would all time especially snow ice boba milk tea  time family came because all wanted something different ice cream milk tea smoothies  cousin asked mango smoothie but mango slush  told waitress but she said same thing  but over it  Chocolate Hazelnut toast overwhelming say least  toast strictly huge piece bread side Nutella ice cream extra  asked extra Nutella but first waitress brought sprinkles  asked again she proceeded attitude  Honestly she didn't want serve she more into sitting down chatting friend  all means but when your job serving people  She did need rude  think going other places now on  <EOR> As much REALLY want place can't  drinks? Pretty tasty good sizes cool mugs slightly pricey but bad   I haven't tried food can't review but huge menu   The service just down right horrible  don't know if accents sorry if but always speak hate me  time brought wrong drink accident kindly asked if could fix it death glare rest night   I suggest just ordering Thai Tea Peppermint Green Milk Tea taking seat then try ignore staff rest your time there  <EOR> The dining room itself ain't much look but play KPOP music videos entertainment Japanese fashion magazines seating area if you're more quiet mood   Employee recommended rose milk tea added boba really surprised quality rose drinks tend bit strong liking and or obviously fake overly syrupy sweetness  case here! Boba also fresh soft warm perfect texture very generous amount   Why only three stars? No consistency  Subsequent visits plagued aggressively disinterested service boba hard then soft but never again just right  <EOR> I want say absolutely love place some fun times but most part its just okay  truly need step up  others said its hit miss kind place  Its place resonates well Asian crowd its apparent see night since open late  Its packed night which parking slightly difficult times but during day its completely empty    think weakest aspect place service! gals nice but very inattentive more interested phones  But draws back jelly slush boba tea hit sizzling plates which really enjoy    The thing recommend honey toast better off going somewhere else satisfy your honey toast craving  <EOR> Icy Juicy now spot which once Quickly except under new ownership  place remodeled more modern theme playing hip C POP K POP over speakers  menu would mirror Tea Planet  drinks just good even better Tea Planet  tapioca milk green tea milk tea passion fruit green tea  drinks just right amount tea flavor syrup achieve perfect balance  boba also cooked right consistency chewy yet still keeps its shape  know lot boba places butcher bobas  food snacks also similar Tea Planet    However thing MUST TRY SNOW ICE  those chunky pieces ice but SHHAAAVVEEED  ice fluffy snow can't even tell its chunks ice  ordered passion fruit pineapple snow ice came decent size shareable 2 3 people    Overall would definetely come back place  Especially drinks SNOW ICE!  Recommend Passionfruit pineapple snow ice passion fruit green tea steak!!!! <EOR> Not greatest services sure! language barrier however should still deter service smile   The drinks food served decent but inconsistent   day create your own drink concoction next time you just firm No can't      The menu extensive offer couple pages hot teas cold slushy drinks without boba    prices reasonable with exception Monster Toast which does justify $12 opinion     We only tried food once thought pretty good but again inconsistent   occasion ordered sweet potato fries  server brought plum powder dip them which made unique delicious however upon our return tried order same thing long stare trip back kitchen answer No can't The plaza which business located incredibly busy making hard find parking itself think twice  coming but should place couple rounds find parking would such big deal  say it does great hangout friends but conclusion think still find better  <EOR> Small place cleanest but  given restaurants Chinatown     ¯\_ ? _ ¯  SERVICE SUCKS!  No greeted acknowledged door only 2 two seater tables taken busy all no excuse   Took another 10 mins place order   Series hands air just don't care attention throughout whole time  just don't find necessary wait long seated order taken ask water check   We ordered few boba drinks hazelnut toast potstickers red bean green tea snow ice   Boba wasn't impressive   Hazelnut Toast poorly executed nothing special JUST hazelnut spread toast   Potstickers comes 8 pieces pan fried wasn't fan open sides little liked must ok    Red Bean Green Tea Snow Ice green tea shaved ice really good green tea flavor definitely stood out  found whole thing sweet especially 4 5 bites because ice sweet red bean sweet then top off condensed milk  Good but talk DIABETES! It came cute heart shaped medium sized bowl  sucker cutesy details!  Will come back? purpose   <EOR> Had late night milk tea craving luckily place open late    Interior okay just clean small space    I Hokkaido milk tea egg pudding right amount sweetness  always egg pudding milk teas think egg pudding better ones  Very eggy creamy    A good spot fix late night boba honey toast  Haven't honey toast yet but definitely come back try along rest menu  <EOR> Boba decent  drinks aren't sweet but service could better more expensive other places  <EOR> This second time brown sugar milk tea  tea service amazing boba sweet absolutely yummy chewy!! <EOR> No special menu late menu   Boba tea regular priced no special sizes   Flavors usual suspects   bad but outatanding   Service speaks mandarin chinese english    Bento box best deal  <EOR> I'm honestly disappointed see Easy Life Boba Tea 4 starred place only 3 stars     Maybe because sucker when see fresh ingredients being used but feel world should way! Anyways boba tea decent nothing spectacular  yet order fruit smoothie I'd assume use real fruit bs most boba places syrup  However awesome experience place comes Taiwanese snow  far best place Vegas Taiwanese snow  Although menu confusing read actually wide diverse selection flavors snow! also top your snow mochi condensed milk without asking may bad others but mochi condensed milk must me!   fruits snow sweet perfectly ripened  snow condensed milk worked together nice gooey flakey consistency  All all snow perfect!  I don't dig crowd much  Maybe its just but little uncomfortable being surrounded fobs  Most employees look fobby too    lol  However fobs good customer service  came twice far instantly greeted every time served smile   I really Icy Juicy Taiwanese snow service great too  If aren't fobaphobic place definitely worth your time  <EOR> I've couple times every single time experience SUCKS  say? service worst! don't know trained them guessing no body did because workers no manners all   When waitress asked would drink wasn't polite all  more WAT U WANT?! always feel rushed whenever ordering  Then ask sure?! course sure why else would order that? Somebody please teach workers some manners least some proper English   The drinks took pretty long table mean wasn't busy all  Maybe 3 4 tables most including mine  slushy boba man   froze faster little Russian kid balls during wintertime Russia  pretty disappointed fact drink waited long sucked  only good part open late night when friends hanging pretty late  Other wouldn't recommend place anyone  <EOR> revisited place   time search yummy chinese food   did receive?

Milk tea wonderful  love sweet  Which different other stores Las Vegas  also good place hang out  <EOR> Went first time today  wasn't busy all  Only two other tables two  sat quickly but another 15 minutes before decided time take order  Even though tried waving them over couple times    After servers took order   two minutes later another server came take order  told already ordered  safe say need better communication    For whatever reason took them another 7 minutes drink  two others party drinks pretty quickly    So over all 22 minutes simple drink? mediocre that? No thanks    The food looks good but thank god didn't order it    might've another hour   Would back? probably would try food    but only if someone else wanted first  won't suggest place friends  <EOR> After great night Ramen Sora fellow yelpers Terri R suggested some dessert Icy Juicy  never never twist arms comes trying new spots Vegas  Good ones fellow yelpers rave about!

Royal milk tea very good too! <EOR> Recently tried place due craving slushy boy oh boy delicious must try avocado slush creamy tasteful tried last week 4 days straight already am addicted!! only thing small plaza parking little tough specially night many other restaurants karaoke spot there <EOR> Love desserts here! say sucker awesome goodness!!!  Took some friends visiting town introduced them yumminess honey toast just any regular honey toast but fresh fruit whipped cream vanilla ice cream  Talk mouth watering its great just don't if your diet  know say best things usually good you    We also shared shaved ice strawberries kiwi  different some other shaved ice added more condensed milk ice softer smoother but definitely bad    Want something good eat dinner    this definite contender! <EOR> Since Las Vegas foodie fest mission find something comparable fluff ice  date best discovered  ordered mango strawberry snow ice taro flavor watermelon slush boba  snow ice good! portion large fruit really fresh  loved mochi bites too  slush mediocre  bland wasn't much boba it  Service good place very clean staff friendly   I back shortly give slushes another try plus want try monster toast!  A side note Icy Juicy's credit card minimum $15 00 which found bit steep especially if you're only buying dessert never carry cash  <EOR> Went late night friend greeted immediately friendly server  place busy when but later around 1 30 am all seats filled   I ordered rose milk tea boba amazing! pieces rose drink pretty  wish took picture before drank all! crispy chicken also really good too  gave basket full it! two couldn't even finish whole thing  Highly recommend coming back! <EOR> This place really growing me  decent overall but really depends order   best things going them being open until 2 am getting orders very quickly  biggest gripe parking absolutely horrendous usually spend while circling around parking lot trying find available spot  There's just many businesses packed into plaza!  Although tea prices kind steep rival Starbucks prices $4 95 large! am happy allow adjust amount sugar your drink  usually large coffee milk tea no sweeter no boba  food stick appetizer type foods such crispy chicken which basically Taiwanese popcorn chicken  food prices opposite drinks usually really good portion price especially crispy chicken! entree noodle dishes aren't very good wouldn't recommend them   Overall good late night snack chill spot if find parking! <EOR> I'm regular here  drinks great pop corn chicken delicious  husband ordered steak sometimes half half chance receive little raw medium  Overall food drinks great   The reason cut 1 star because service just totally horrible  Especially if during night time   The server doesn't know she stand gives sticky face   So order drinks food Togo good choice  <EOR> This go to place boba  drinks good but service hit miss  aren't very attentive but probably because customer service demand pretty low maintenance  Most people come drink sit least hour hang friends  Sometimes run boba wait least 30 minutes  does boba shop run boba?! always baffled me   The food great! favorite crispy chicken sizzling steak spaghetti  mouth literally watering am typing this! crispy chicken great treat share friends  pretty decent portion cheap is! sizzling steak    omg! amazing  If haven't before please try it! comes salad first then steak comes stone plate spaghetti egg steak top drenched mushroom black pepper sauce  favorite black pepper  steak always little undercooked but way because  always just move noodles way put steak stone plate  much better getting over cooked steak IMO   Anyways another reason friends come because open late seat bunch us    sometimes 15 area! Icy Juicy located very busy shopping center  pretty hard find parking spot sometimes park shopping center next door across street! pretty inconvenient but isn't another place found open late seat all we're really left much option   Oh! Also if aren't fan cigarette smoke try sit near entrance  always people smoking outside sometimes leave door open breathing smoke! <EOR> Oh boy where even start    I suppose goods first drinks very tasty boba isn't chewy hard most places been  atmosphere also pretty good spot just sit relax play cards chat friends find out  really nice large selection drink orders extra usual's egg pudding grass jelly add  food mediocre best but place known delicious drinks rather food  Although enjoy cripy chicken  other hand service absolutely horrible  am huge regular keep going back because drinks good but lack severely service  Today sat 1 hour single hostess greeting giving menu  Instead made eye contact few times sat counter talking people watching  would understand if busy but place 9 people time total inside  Finally asked menu which obliged tossing table immediately turning away rather handing open hand reaching it  drink came delicious expected satisfied little treat but when came paying  soon server came back tab she simply stood side looked blankly table 4 hesitantly knowing give check to  She completely dumbstruck   reached grab check fingers tab she then moved away gave person furthest away table didn't even order anything   Again disregarding clearly open hand reaching bill  first time serving  girls working completely ignorant rude!  If want decent drinks come  quickly go  If want service though suggest elsewhere  Kung fu boba way better <EOR> I give Icy Juicy 3 5 star  place nice cool  first time there  shaved ice cream good green tea ice cream mixed fruit  think put much condensed milk but just me  friend try yogurt smoothie thingy she didn't drink cause also sweet her  ice cream good other stuff look very good  think worth trying if sweet tooth  services excellent  place clean seem really good place hang out  <EOR> I only hot coconut milk tea boba but loved it! definitely come back try rest menu! <EOR> Snow ice good  Hot tea good think over priced  Don't hot green tea!!! good all  Peppermint green tea worst! Yuck  Sorry but did it     <EOR> I horrible service waitresses every single time go  don't speak enough English tend orders wrong then proceed blame wrong order customer  even gotten told waitress ordered  know! ordered this! just wanted say Excuse me? Don't think KNOW ordered myself?? also find policy splitting checks ridiculous  Why does every person table pay $15 separate checks? Why can't just milk tea while friend gets some fries?  The food tends much something sweet salty etc   The drinks tend taste syrupy  The place reeks sewage certain times day  I gone several times friends always more more disappointed  Overall would never recommend going anyone  <EOR> Lots tasty drink options packaged less appealing atmosphere unaccommodating service     The servers actually quite friendly but policies cumbersome owner seems cut corners  came when running low boba eventually ran out  Instead giving normal portions boba until ran started rationing people paying boba but receiving full amount  management owner directing this  could tell servers face she brought order she embarrassed happening    When drinks great   but inconsistency leaves wanting take business elsewhere  <EOR> by far best milk tea vegas!! they're milk tea equivalent milk tea L A    sweet boba chewy fresh! <EOR> My shaved ice didn't look nor taste good  worth money  Maybe next time try tea instead  <EOR> Firstly would state give place rating 3 stars because FOOD  service could little better = boba cravers dessert lovers hungry people    Generally everyone find  something love   WHERE small plaza Spring Mountain Jones  If helps same vicinity Cafe Moda Cravin' Cajun   WHEN Conveniently Monday through Sunday 11am 2am    WHAT Honestly way heard place friends' instagram post beautifully made MONSTER HONEY TOAST GOODNESS  picture definitely caught eye  Lol   I met friends eat lunch brainstorming place came mind  friend before she ordered plate food  soon ordered boba their boba perfectly made LIKING   wasn't looking eat full on meal but looking forward dessert instead just sald pepper chicken  friend somewhat rush decided order monstrous honey toast advance    20 minutes later still hasn't come  wondering chicken wings 10 minutes but toast yet front me     We finally ask server kept back all along it already made   Ok it    waiting finish food but c'mon    WANT DESSERT  Another service downfall keep asking water refills napkins check    conclusion call ask them everything yet only customers there    NO BUENO customer service but TOAST keeps coming back forgetting service    <EOR> I really mixed feelings place  More pros cons but still mixed feelings    Pros  fact its open late become place no matter time day craving boba   most delicious cappuccino slush ever which far only think order  must try!  give generous serving crispy chicken rice  Enough tables accommodate large group  even seem separate section towards back even larger group couch area towards front counter if you're looking seat thats more comfortable   Food comes hot fresh timely manner   Extensive beverage food choices  Cons  Service kinda slow  There's probably only two people working person front seems doing everything  There's table outside guess people smoke but keep door open smell inside parking outside limited which obviously fault but something keep mind if intend during busy hours  <EOR> There many Taiwanese restaurants Vegas why still give 3 stars i coming drinks pop corn chicken pop corn chicken rice every once while  don't know why place smells greasy dead chicken now  Icy juicy need clean restaurant! food still tastes ok drinks still good  <EOR> The owner cheap ass  ordered juicy steak cooked medium came rare  them cook again add some more sauce wouldn't dry out  When check discovered charged whole dollar just little bit extra sauce  Maybe if sauce something amazing would understand but salty made food hard eat  could least told would extra charge  <EOR> Located Mountain View Plaza Jones same shopping center Asian BBQ Noodles between Cue D's Cafe Moda  love open until 2am  clean bright also cute decor behind counter   Thier drink selection huge rather daunting  asked waitress recommendation between two debating between she quickly told iced green milk tea favorite    Done  ended ordering boba  enjoyed iced green milk tea but also felt very sweet  left film sugar taste buds  waited until ice melted little bit more order drink but then taste buds toast shall say sugar bombed    My boyfriend ordered iced coconut milk tea boba  drink thick powdery consistency coconut flavor annoying artificial aftertaste  both preferred drink over two    The boba best part  cooked perfectly right amount firmness softness  also pleasantly sweet  glad least thing right  boba places where thier boba tastes dishwasher    We checked Facebook also received 10% off order  total two drinks discount $10  suppose isn't #1 spot boba but now until find best Vegas!

Rush order mad when can't understand say because can't speak English properly  Plus they're rude!! obviously didn't train well  accused stealing when your staff doesn't know slide card give receipt properly? somewhere else way better! <EOR> When into cafe base overall judgement number aspects 1 Ambiance 2 Music 3 Quality food 4 Friendliness servers 5 Menu options 6 Price range etc   My mom randomly craving some cold drinks hot Sunday afternoon  happened having lunch HK Star just couple stores away crossed over try had  really can't say place bad no all but could say better cafes before  hostess pretty friendly when asked specialty drinks recommended ordered mango kumquat green tea which strinkingly good    This place definitely great stop take out order but wouldn't spend day talks chit chat  can't quite put finger but place tad bit dark much unnecessary space no theme concept decoration whatsoever music exactly something could just push into background chill    Not bad great well  <EOR> Okay its defiinitely famous Taiwanese Shaved ice shop Class 302 Rowland Heights CA   **WHich die for!*** But would say its Las Vegas   If aren't near Class 302   have luxury stopping neat creamy shaved ice dessert place $15 hour long leg massages across street    should surely give place try    place may 2 5 3 0 all fits category Their milk tea plenty   refreshing tasty   Boba soft   Shaved ice bit different  Had Taro flavored shaved ice fresh fruits mochi bites   serving bit smaller    two people could share but  stretching bit   Lots fruits mochi   pretty refreshing     I also chicken wings   it could better little salty side   couldn't finish it   skin consistent   it crunchy some places   and burnt others   The bf ended eating all none waste  If still reside vegas   I would back   because heart shaved ice   Keep good work!

Saw newspaper awhile back but never came until today   The Taiwanese style pepper steak 12 95 comes soup salad dish itself egg noodles well  two options whether want mushroom sauce black pepper sauce  opted black pepper sauce  server also ask type sauce degree wellness steak   The dish comes hot plate making sizzle aroma spreading air quickly  portion really filling even took half home me  loved black pepper sauce! various black pepper sauces California Las Vegas definitely top 5 better tasting black pepper sauces  May wonder may difference since black pepper but technique turn super spicy mild no flavor bland  case just right  mild black pepper sauce  steak cooked correctly ordered it    Since boba place must drink! ordered large tapioca milk tea give lot boba your drink its worth! honey boba which nice taste your mouth  texture little chewier prefer but more preference thing  portion decent worth money 4 dollars   Also tried snow ice here! snow ice came heart shaped bowl decorated mango kiwi strawberries making quite appealing eye  snow ice nice mango taste it   The place small but good enough boba place  Chinese music playing background good place hang chill friends  gives freedom spending some time friends while drinks snacks quick snacks  <EOR> One favorite boba place ^_^ always thai tea  Employee's all nice always smiling  This place chill spot <EOR> This place most horrible customer service ever visited to!  We wanted try place work boyfriend food when walked workers staring food but didnt say anything   They hella pushy trying rush order   So did order soon boyfriend tried opening food workers said no outside food but wtf did any sign no outside food little upset left   We definitely going back place! Never  <EOR> IMO think place best shaved ice Vegas why Shave ice place comes 4 flavors green tea condensed milk mango taro red bean not sure last flavor   Unlike most other places tried think place mixed flavor into water before freezing it  Thus when shave ice flavor already evenly distributed into shaved ice  think also give shaved ice nice silky texture  very generous fruit topping  recommend mango stay away red bean  sweetness red bean whole thing sweet   Now why give place three stars instead five Except rose tea boba think other boba drinks just average  shaved ice also little more expensive other place don't lid shaved ice cup if need go  <EOR> Food drinks pretty good price reasonable  recommend  Crispy Chicken Matcha Milk Tea  place small sometimes you'll wait little bit    I don't coming because always people smoking front door blows dining area  Its being old casino poor ventilation   Also service very good  You'll walk bar order pay because can't flag down staff save your life  place deserves solid 4 stars if didn't smell cigarette better service  <EOR> I'm glad finally tried place Everything place A+! SERVICE boba drinks snow ice sweet butter toast juicy steak all stellar! server very attentive well friendly  <EOR> Our first visit good! Hubby avocado smoothie consistency smoothie point boba fresh soft chewy  wanted try snow ice server helped pick out Strawberry milk snow ice  pretty good especially fresh strawberries but really sweet both strawberry syrup condensed milk toppings  think try mixed fruit next time more fruit variety light condensed milk   Definitely hole wall hidden strip mall  Just past cigarette butt infested outside it'll ok  definitely come back try more! <EOR> So good friend mine decided eat somewhere different time ended eating place   Well showing DEFINITELY mistake! First off waitress didn't know ANY answers questions food  mean come REALLY!? going sell your food if don't crap it?! Second service sucked waitress she never checked us  mean if cafe expect LEAST some type friendly service   Third food HORRIBLE  didn't even want pay bill  Plus BARELY touched food  crispy chicken salty milk tea lacked flavor  basically payed $8 only eating rice eggs  WASTE MONEY TIME!  I would've rather spent money $5 00 expensive milk tea tea station due its HIGH QUALITY  Never spending another dime place ever again  <EOR> The place very good enjoy drinks food  Great place eat affordable well! <EOR> I wanted drink some lunch same shopping center  Inside typical simple boba place seem few board games stacks playing cards    The BF rose milk tea  both really liked version much better other spots which seems use tea just hint rose petals  use rose petal jam bits pieces bottom your drink which really yummy    I brown sugar milk tea  drastically different milk tea but slightly different aftertaste brown sugar which prefer    I tied knot straw here  cute   We ordered to go don't much say per se but drinks solid price right drinks made fairly fast  back try more drinks perhaps some icy juicy dessert  <EOR> I really love place  location good  Open till late night  Reasonable price  see lots comments saying service sucks  would say just cultural differences P server simply just your order done then led back  don't expect very good service there  main part comparing drink other store  would say best drink town  drink just sweet enough me  also request less sugar  food best popcorn chicken squad legs  always friends good time  5 stars place D <EOR> AMBIANCE 3 just super simple decor seating  Nothing super special but gets job done! place confusingly decorated  it needs makeover!   SERVICE 4 service actually pretty good  really attentive nice    FOOD 2 Don't order chicken  great  think fish balls ordered pretty good but tend order foods restaurants really mess up! did season fish balls didn't because didn't need all  Usually just cook fish balls let taste magic sometimes even sauces them   It seems boba better rest drinks  ordered Yogurt Slush Strawberry just way sweet pleasant towards end drink  If found way slush taste more yogurty would lot better! <EOR> AWESOME DESSERT PLACE  I would highly recommend getting honey toast any shaved ice dessert  The honey toast consist buteered bread ice cream middle two piroulines  frekaing good   may want indulge yourself shave ice fruit hot vegas summer day! love thispalce usually come dessert  menu decent but would just stick dessert place  <EOR> For those taiwanese cuisine lover place probably best fried chicken rice las vegas  Wonderfully battered absolutely crunchy  havent really try all other stuff but long takes mind away San Gabriel Old Country Cafe then should just fine since am now living Las Vegas    The service great since chinese girl seems only know 50 % english vocabulary but if speak chinese mandarin should just fine  boba tea much milk maybe next time order less milk    You should least try just dont worry service its chinese restaurant  <EOR> In opinion place BEST boba Las Vegas  also open until 2am which awesome  reason why place getting three stars service  probably over 100 times service NEVER good  workload much waitress spends half time phone  suggest ordering your food drinks takeout! <EOR> I frequent place snow ice before  recent snow ice pure disappointment  texture used be  Instead melting your mouth snowy fluff tasted shaved ice properly prepared  might say ice blended smoothie drink  way typical texture snowy ice  <EOR> I Icy Juicy several times now although gave business four stars initial review feel necessary downgrade now tried several things   I really detest milk tea   don't flavor all   really unique really cup tea  Literally   won't again     I also don't clientele   place seems frequented lot boisterous hipsters more willing crowd scream your ear   kind obnoxious   Other places loud like Tea Station but whole other level crazy   think because crowd really really young   substitute teacher   around kids all day   don't wanna around kids midnight while getting boba on     Oh service really spotty   Sometimes workers friendly sometimes look wanna give bitchslap   I really can't see conceivable circumstance during which would return Icy Juicy   Ive tried enough seen enough   over it  <EOR> I'm glad place opened because decent Taiwanese food scarce place good Taiwanese food comparing other places town  <EOR> I wanted update review trying MONSTER TOAST!

Skip buy two shaved ice same money   mixed fruit mochi AMAZING!  two those same chedda! <EOR> As boba snack place same any other  bobas okay but ended giving them four star because constantly mistakes order  sizes wrong would forget give straws would put boba when asked no boba  little clarity would good but overall same any other place  <EOR> Perfect to know each other date place  Small quiet  Family owned business    Drinks very good    I strawberry slush which delivered brain freezes most time but accepted them well lol  fault drinking quick!   They food menu  next list try food  <EOR> i guess mood eat desserts but its pretty damn good  fruits shaved ice cream pretty good  only thing hate coming its packed because shopping center busy its hard find parking  <EOR> This typa place when when aint' jack shit grudgingly place sake doing something   Cranky server thats never wants serve you? Check  Mediocre powder drinks? Check  Overpriced? Check  Boredom unsatisfying cured? Check   PS  mocha typo actually suppose matcha  But server won't tell until drink your table drank it  No refunds exchanges Awesome                <EOR> So ordered hot MT  haven't taken even sip  Opened stir tea cool down find didn't full cup tea  | <EOR> Another decent place Boba Vegas ! wanted just grab drink but set pretty awkward  sit down table despite fact just wanted drink go then pay bill table hrm tip 20% freaking boba drink carried 5 feet?

Chinese waiters Chinese music Chinese writing menus mostly Chinese Asian regulars   If you're expecting diversity cultural experience then elsewhere    Icy Juicy serves only milk teas approx  $3 $5 but also typical snow ice shaved ice approx  $5 $6 slushies approx  $5 flavored teas approx $4 $5    All milk teas very flavorful dark yet equally milky  favorite order all time royal milk tea has ginger taste it milk tea rich heavy perfect combo creme green milk tea a light  refreshing drink more tea creme   boba also very good always soft because popularity always made regularly fresh  If you're fan boba try lychee coffee jelly instead  guaranteed renew your taste buds   They also finger snacks such spicy chicken approx   $5 variety other fried finger foods coming second best approx  $4 $6 entrees coming last approx  $8 $12   favorite snack all time spicy chicken crispy squid  Both very deliciously flavorful batter tastes garlic chili spices rather just meat dipped flour deep fried  If you're drink tea eat snacks perfect combination  But if you're expecting quality meal suggestion save your money eat elsewhere then come drinks desserts afterwards  claim Taiwanese food yet lot authentic poorly executed  If eat suggestion try pork chop rice $8   2 large pieces pork chop eggs cabbage ground pork rice specialty sizzling noodle $12   Those only 2 think worth it  IMO soups worse flavorless taste water     So if many good things say place why did give only 3 stars? Don't wrong drinks delicious when comes down boba shop taste really all matters  However main reason why place set back star list because often lacking service  fair certain waitresses all Asian most cannot speak English fluently very sweet   yet few work during late night shifts hate deal whenever come in  2 girls particular very inattentive distant seem almost unwilling help just because speak Chinese easier them  top when place gets busy mean often full house full lobby during late nights weekend often very hard any service especially if part big group  trying serve first  place could use more staff opinion tables even though don't think  possible just  because very big place   would some major reconstruction   Overall aside those minor flaws definitely recommend Icy Juicy anyone interested making pit stops trying Asian boba culture first time    *CASH ONLY BTW!* <EOR> I really popcorn chicken  right amount spices without being over fried  However all fried things best takeout tends flat being its box long  Service always pretty good  also fan friend tofu though good travel same reasons popcorn chicken  <EOR> I use love going place when new I'd study groups late night catch friends   But gone down hill   day reeked place hasn't cleaned  Mixture sewer cleaning solution!  left without ordering   Last night decided give try since craved drink   10 30pm  order large oeach green tea   took long time something simple   put much sweetener drink felt just drinking syrup Straight bottle   only drank 1 4 including thr help bf  bf ordered milk green tea which seemed fine but he finished drink    I PUT FRIDGE FINISH NEXT MORNING WORK  ITS CURRENTLY 8AM ALREADY MOLD GROWING DRINK  THERES NO WAY MOLD GROW FAST OVER NIGHT REFRIDGERATED ENVIRONMENT UNLESS ALREADY GROWING BEGIN WITH!  quite disturbed definitely return anything   attempt put picture drink all see   Not mention order taker cashier same person usually   straws covered always see taking money then getting drinks food orders counter without washing hands  <EOR> Great tea food but saw owner older lady charge today clipping nails kitchen bar area wanted gag  only did she clip them bar kitchen area she didn't even bother pick nail clippings      saw them floor  Yeah don't know if going ever come back seeing     knows where those nail clips other bodily parts might     GROSS <EOR> A flaw mine usually know rationalize spread joys life  When all out  string reviews did happen series days but all one   I some time kill getting haircut before pick sister  Vetoing gym day relaxation little did know would fall far off bandwagon  started ordering large Grapefruit Green Tea Aloe Vera $5 00 thinking would 24oz serving but came mug puts Hofbrauhaus shame  tea bold bitter all  grapefruit flavor light sweet  aloe vera large chunks came generous portion  Then next step where horribly wrong  ordered Rose Yogurt $3 75   Little did know another drink  thought going frozen yogurt since bottom page lined pictures creamy treat  When employees asked if wanted wait little thrown off but should clue  Rose Yogurt reminded those little bottles yogurt drink  use Asian supermarkets  ok  would totally stick teas    The best part folly bad since running special  Until December 7th tomorrow doing half off drinks if check Facebook them  both drinks came five dollars some change    The staff nice but language barrier  don't speak Chinese but barista kept talking Chinese  waitress roughly translated gist it  previously stated great place late night boba action since open until 2am  <EOR> The prices great if show them your yelp check in to go order 10% discount   massive super mango shaved ice came whopping total $6 15 discount   When say massive mean need both hands hold beastly bowl icy juicy mango madness   only complaint used giant hunks canned peaches instead fresh chunks   They sugar gauge near back menu which allow specify sweet prefer your order   Regulars warned tend err sweet side if don't specify   Armed knowledge ordered dish less sweet side  <EOR> I ordered mango smoothies boba but sweet felt place very loud unclean employees very slow no greeted = <EOR> Cute little place next Cue D's  Came check place catch friends  offer wi fi [ ordered green apple green tea grass jelly  Sounds weird right?

Okay you're probably wondering foods stick high turn over items  Fried foods drinks high turn over items while soup    much  wonton soup inedible tasted bit rancid    My husband likes coming because he says seasoning popcorn chicken tastes does back Taiwan where family from  drinks powdered but they're also full off ice fair price    Something noticed cafe upfront pre sweetened powdered drinks  Unlike other cafes which say they'll accommodate order no sweetener no sugar unsweetened only take sip taste sugar waitress let know if unsweetened drinks option particular drink if ask  Others seem erroneously believe adding simple syrup pre sweetened drink powders means they've accommodated your request unsweetened drink   If don't want fried foods bento boxes good deal quick meal pleasantly surprised good tea eggs tomato egg curry chicken is  would highly recommend it!  I can't give 4 stars place served something tasted rancid ever but hope doesn't happen anyone ever again  I'd also them clean upholstery  Other enough times know solid 3 star place still back because hours prices chicken  <EOR>    Well don't dislike place  saying something considering avoided Icy Juicy plague   The last time 2011  service horrible drinks expensive very good just wasn't very great time   Fast forward 2014 decided give them second chance  okay experience which vast improvement previous one   Service Prompt curt kind awkward but okay  Drinks hot royal milk tea boba which actually really good  Price Still expensive me     I probably wouldn't back unless friend invited again already area  would definitely down if someone treating though! *hint hint <EOR> I craving some bubble tea help handy dandy Yelp app found Icy Juicy  Also originally looking Quickly but apparently closed down Icy Juicy took over space Icy Juicy was    Anyway decided taro smoothie boba egg custard  Since never carry cash paid card informed minimum $15 credit debit card purchases  Kinda annoying but really wanted smoothie ended getting some calamari fish balls meet minimum    The smoothie super tasty exactly liked taro  boba nice chewy egg custard great addition  thought egg custard's flavor might clash taro but actually worked well    The food other hand ok  calamari your standard calamari  nice overcooked  However when cold old oil taste definitely prevalent  fish balls kind Asian restaurants but liked added extra seasoning more own  definitely enjoyed those more calamari    Anyway definitely come back more boba  However probably skip food  bring cash! <EOR> This little boba place next Cue D's  playing some pool came grab drink  girls working seated down  awhile other girl obviously both girls weren't fluent English came over take order  friend asked she recommend she rudely said ready walked away   Both girls rude  finished noticed two girls sitting behind friends attending any customers until owner said something  took forever them come over give check    I ordered green milk tea boba ice cream honey toast  milk tea tasted really strong perfume honey toast no ice cream honey anything  very hard   ' <EOR> $10 minimum use card    booooooo!!!   Visited Tuesday 7 5 16 around 9PM   Once past all cigarette butts outside front door stood foyer awkwardly few minutes wondering do   no hostess stand   there counter but cash register facing outwards looked more  POS waitress instead counter ordering     Finally worker appeared ordered she let know $10 minimum pay card   WTH?  You're running drink shop   most drinks less $10!  shows lack consideration customer also tells owners cheapskates  bothered much more should have   should walked right then     I paid almost six bucks strawberry banana slush boba   boba good consistency   very fresh squishy!
