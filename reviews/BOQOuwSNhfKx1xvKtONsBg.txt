But together didn't really work  think if used black olives instead kalamata chopped artichoke hearts bit smaller instead huge chunks added more mushrooms prosciutto would've 10 times better  thin crust cooking wood fired oven gives rustic flavor   Service decent great terrible  probably won't going back anytime soon though <EOR> So pizza really interesting  Gluten free pizzas other restaurants usually taste really bad microwaved pizzas but Settebello's recipe totally different  gluten free pizza naan bread base which probably just Napoli style never before though  closest comparison draw! fresh ingredients piled top it  They're definitely American pizzas very authentic Italian taste especially sauce   hostess said pretty much anything menu made gluten free just $4 extra which incredibly accommodating  friend around 5PM Sunday wasn't very crowded service incredibly quick the pizzas came around 10 minutes ordered   ambiance really nice too very tastefully decorated would probably great date night  <EOR> My favorite pizza!! favorite waitress Trish!

Talk pizza  might seem lot going when look all ingredients but everything comes together perfectly  crushed tomato great mozzarella ridiculously tasty  new favorite pizza topping might just pine nuts  Now want talk crust? Yup talk pizza  almost bread center very soft chewy texture but outside crispy gets awesome char wood fire grill  only complaint pizza amount toppings  very small amount sausage compared other ingredients some slices even no meat them  huge deal but could definitely bit less stingy meat   They're dessert worthy too! While bit overly sweet side liking Bella Mela definitely worth try  combination apples cinnamon almonds mascarpone good you'll probably ended wanting eat whole thing alone even if full dinner   So when comes pizza all know there's no shortage options Vegas  But if want legit Neapolitan pizza   Settebello where at!

However didn't really vinaigrette salad tasted quite bland  prefer dressing least some taste  Unfortunately wasn't impressed pizza either  Yes ingredients fresh hot but pizza hard eat  main problem crust very thin every bite ingredients would just fall off  Kind felt just eating crust most time pretty messy  Thankfully ordering dessert great idea  Tiramisu delicious sweet  coffee flavor wasn't overpowering or lacking other restaurants  thought funny put contains raw egg description dessert menu  When asked server he said Well starts off raw egg then gets mixed with     Umm ok means lot dishes start off raw egg right??  Anyway now say finally tried but impressed  Fancy pizzas definitely me  happily stick boring Pepperoni Pizzas thank very much! <EOR> Great place if pizza taste good but panna cotta nothing but good no taste all but medicine very heavy balsamic vinegar top shouldn't young vinegar just salad dressing should aged subtle   Other its good place ! <EOR> Settebello pretty successful upscale woodfire pizzeria   Service excellent friendly prompt   Had simple pizza fresh mozzarella spicy salami basil very tasty   typically order pepperoni pizza but loved salami   pepperoni seem little humdrum     I liked crushed tomatoes approach sauce but wish Settebello would rethink much tomato juice allowing crust think could stay true concept pizza without letting overly soggy  <EOR> I fan Settebello years excited opened another location closer side town  opportunity meal some fabulous fellow Yelpers last week five star meal expected  Since larger party able order share quite few different pizzas desserts    We started Arancini appetizer which good opted five different pizzas Margherita DOC Settebello Carbonara Diavola special day which white pizza  favorites Margherita Settebello Diavola although all them great  Diavola fantastic spiciness couldn't enough of  Margherita simple but perfectly made showcased quality ingredients use  Settebello restaurant's namesake perfect combination flavors never say no pine nut  least favorite probably white pizza since quite few more onions would liked  lacking but tablemates seemed love quite bit weekly specials good idea check them Facebook sign online newsletter updates    Luckily able sample quite few desserts well while there  Caramel Budino stole heart moment read description menu did disappoint  highlights meal me  Flavorful great combination flavors  dessert pizza heaven  Cinnamon apples caramel powdered sugar served beautiful pizza dough  great dessert well  second favorite day  S'mores Calzone Zeppoles didn't much me  good but sweet chocolatey taste   probably just though    As fan Settebello long meal lived all fond memories meals friends Settebello Henderson wonder why took long between visits  <EOR> I believe found wonderful Pizzeria!  brought back many memories living Bella Napoli! early lunch busy all   husband never Neapolitan  pizza but he loved flavor    hate travel 4 hours plane enjoy   <EOR> ATMOSPHERE friend came during slow part day only ones sit down early dinner   However place looks really cool spot once sun down more people start come through   decor very rustic which nice see huge pizza over back restaurant   FOOD pizzas meant eaten individually no large pizzas shared sure if fan style   enjoy having huge pizza front everyone everyone getting slice   Regardless Neapolitan style pizzas which much chewier center while outsides crisp   little much chew liking but made pizza great freshness ingredients   Capricciosa pizza great choice overall     SERVICE server nice enough explain Neapolitan pizza differs other types did good job explaining options menu   well run service nothing truly remarkable but certainly beats many other restaurants where service truly lacked  <EOR> I discovered Settebello upon moving Las Vegas area work 7 months ago  become regular!
