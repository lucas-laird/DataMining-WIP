Ok granted every restaurant should signature dish but goodness' sake service staff using verbiage 'chef' 'integrity dish' scrambled egg only dry biscuit ridiculously gargantuan portioned family joint?  politely asked server ask chef he recommended two guests dietary restrictions   All said done ended 'allowing' request bacon side different sauce only agreed pay additional fee substituted sauce   Made wonder if would ordered dish which contained sauce wanted substituted red pepper cream would given discount?

What?!??! she gonna drop them off another table?????  Not wanted rolls but really want back?!?!?!?  She did rethink told no because when she came back table she didn't want anymore   THANK GOODNESS!

Corned beef special cuz hand pulled beef tender  reason said over rated bec dissapointed taste  Although presentation 'WOW' taste kinda bland  Chicken tasteless waffles great much flour fluffy be  Another hassle every person needs order soething even 1 year old?? kidding me?! Good thing order sides additional person      Kiwi Lemonade just so  reason many people likes bec nice color presented green yellow pink color! Again would rather other place breakfast next time  <EOR> Very cool atmosphere very polite staff however am impressed food  Basic toast very dry eggs needed more flavor coffee WAY strong  Perhaps am picky own good however feel $9 breakfast could've more worth money   On positive note crispy potatoes very good sausage AMAZING! also full bar perfect end long night spent partying  <EOR> Great food amazing service portion size massive bring friend! <EOR> Hash House YES YES!!!  I saw Hash House Go Go featured Vegas morning shows during recent business trip decided would check next trip Vegas    boy certainly weren't disappointed  probably top three places breakfast now   They describe menu 'twisted farm food' which good way describing it  Everything made fresh all good  traditional bacon eggs if but if want more adventurous try something Salmon Brie Scramble side grilled mashed potatoes yes    MASHED POTATOES BREAKFAST!!! love that?! The various hashes specialty  particularly taken french toast pecans grilled banana  YUM! Also don't pass biscuits homemade jam they come most meals     All portions HUGEMONGUS sure you're hungry don't plan eating rest day! barely made dent breakfasts when there  would good place group bunch different things eat all family style    The service friendly attentive which made experience all more enjoyable    This place quite bit off strip W  SAHARA cab ride would probably cost bit  Its best if your own transportation  believe Deuce Bus also    If you're looking great place where locals check place out We enjoyed much decided back more time before left town sure we'll back again   If leave hungry just ain't tryin'  <EOR> this mind numbingly good meal   It's rare see restaurant innovative breakfast  rare see them break eggs 1000 different ways mentality  But Hash House does succeeds   They wide variety unique breakfast fare well traditional fare stepped notch quality   The portions absurdly large which probably why Sage Fried Chicken Benedict featured Man Vs  Food  The pancakes superb Sage Benny which bacon fried chicken eggs atop biscuit atop mashed potatoes all smothered chipotle cream sauce   Additionally cast Pawn Stars seated next us  But expect wait table place hopping  <EOR> This place awesome!!! food portions amazingly huge  Great wait staff servers  First time definitely back again!! yummy! <EOR> Oh goodness place comfort food +10   portion sizes huge share two other folks  The service friendly quick reliable  The atmosphere relaxed even lit décor trendy ish  I return <EOR> I wanted love Hash House Go  just didn't work out   I've heard lot good things Hash House especially people whose opinions always right on   I bought coupon restaurant com while work rest day mouth watering anxiety!  I drove other side valley eat 3 friends  For some reason almost dead when entered  decided good thing because usually better service   They bring biscuits look baked cake pan  Whipped butter honey  biscuits amazing but very filling   The menu overwhelming  told order Sage Chicken waffles maple reduction  decided against it  ordered Boston Hash which severely disappointing  love potatoes any form  didn't remember seeing scrambled eggs description but plate  some asparagus too  fresh fruit nowhere near ripe    My friends ordered ribs huge chicken salad bacon salmon  HUGE But felt plates used ribs salad should switched ! Mine seemed more reasonable which going for   The crab cake no good  need use less bread crumbs more crab  potatoes should cut into smaller pieces  mixture potatoes tomatoes did work possibly due fact potatoes covered seasoning tomatoes just plain unnecessary   They famous huge portions odd pairings  thing did understand branch rosemary stuck somewhere every plate brought out   The service horrible  eating 3 people worked restaurant service industry before  them 10 years  all agree horrible service  He jerk  called HASH House you'd think wouldn't problem substitute sort chicken other SALAD  waiter asshole it  Very abrupt never checked us  gave worst tip ever given didn't feel bad  addition couldn't use coupon because $3 short $50  Instead telling order side put dessert bill order use $25 coupon he ran card anyway  good server would've suggested that   I'm sure if want come back  think give gift certificate brother he enjoy it   3 stars because apparently ordered worst thing menu everyone else happy  Just luck!  Also portions excellent music  Otherwise 2 stars  <EOR> Great smells whet your appetite even your dreams if you've ever eaten here   Sure know everyone talks feels played something Seacrest boasting KISS but come all love forget all trash talked whenever return   My typical order #4 hash pancakes whole wheat toast   know creature habit but also great place graze breakfast others strongly suggest invite anyone won't partake leave your guarded friends home   Even if you're professional end breakfast meetings staff regular basis   Overall great place eat graze take your time just sure ready wait weekends  <EOR> After seeing place episode Man vs  Food made pit stop last trip Vegas   Wednesday afternoon wait 30 minutes bad   food portions definitely gigantic! Any plates easily feed two people   We ordered brown sugar banana flapjack mushroom artichoke hearts sundried tomato fresh spinach house hash Andy's sage fried chicken benedict w maple reduction 2 eggs bacon mashed potatoes biscuit appeared Man vs  Food Everything savory delicious! If place bay area would every Saturday morning more! can't wait eat place again next time Vegas   Prices reasonable but service kind sucked   maybe just waitress had? give them benefit doubt because all food ordered tasty!  Deeeeeeelicious food highly recommended! <EOR> Holy BLT  The bread freaking monstrous  place lot even though thought little pricey  Ultimately enjoyed food would come back again  <EOR> Twisted farm food?

There's nothing special Hash House but consistent food tastes fine  <EOR> I wish would open where live   food amazing portions  The chicken waffles fresh crispy well seasoned  The Salmon Hash cream cheese favorite though   Chunks salmon cream cheese over potatoes YUMMY   Always home extra  The brown sugar banana pancakes must try   cake takes whole plate  <EOR> I love going Hash House Go  much fun Breakfast massive pancake notice plural   huge some crazy types try  Last time Brown Sugar Banana pancake good    I would also recommend going Friday nights Chicken Waffles! Why Friday? Well special reduced price only Friday which runs 12 95 could definitely share someone else  Two chicken breasts 2 waffles bacon inside     So if want some good food medium price don't hesitate down try out  <EOR> Received three stars food service     first visit ok but nothing write home about     ordered breakfast eggs cold potatoes all way done     told next time receive better food service     second time ordered burgers     food more decent time around     sure if want give place third try which awful being locals it's hard find consistency service food etc town no matter where !!!!! <EOR> I've twice  cool concept mashed semi twisted food  You're hungry really want it  last round fell flat  ordered bacon infused waffle couple fried eggs piled top good measure cup joe    First coffee must its last legs because lukewarm  sent back  night slinging drinks strip last thing want shitty coffee  Then dish arrives  looks pretty but eggs     wait     wait     also lukewarm  Sweet baby Jesus! tepid themed nightmare  Overall meal disappointing  done high concept low results joint  <EOR> At first thought would impressed place because everything smelled delicious portions going around enormous!

I back four times  If your going group restaurants website coupons save some cash  must <EOR> Yes   this place located Imperial Palace which think all agree giant petri dish cigarette smoke whiskey stains   But rest assured Hash House worth wading through musty humid depressing I Palace   I seen few reviews say may wait line before table place but husband did issue   during late afternoon early evening right in   The wait staff friendly attentive   placing your order receive complimentary order home made biscuits    did catch that?  Let say again     After placing your order receive COMPLIMENTARY ORDER HOME MADE BISCUITS!!  Whaaat?!?! D  Trust melt your mouth!  I highly recommend ordering Sage Fried Chicken Waffles   literally best fried chicken best waffles ever eaten   Everything cooked perfection   chicken just right texture brown crispy   waffles cooked long enough where ever slight crunch when bit into them but insides warm soft     I should also mention waffles ribbons crispy bacon baked right into them!  am talking semi cooked soggy bacon most places sling your plate lazy stupor  You know am talking about   the kind where KNOW cooked all way    bacon CRUNCHES when bite into your waffle!  Hands down place wonderful   literally dragged husband through sick sad casino load place   well worth it   place likely rocking around 2am 6am when people just leaving bars if late night prepared wait   If during daytime likely better luck   Regardless time decide sure stop place regret it!

In due course server arrived clutching medium sized cast iron skillet heavy oven mitt  great idea cast iron would keep food hot steamy while enjoyed it   WRONG! skillet seems used solely presentation preparation stone cold bite realized temperature meal far off  FAIL!  The marinated steak perfectly cooked medium but lacked flavor  green beans which felt strange choice breakfast dish bit al dente whole skillet lacked seasoning    Curiously server pointed days freshly made strawberry citrus jam asked if would butter buttermilk biscuit which replied yes but somehow said butter never materialized  FAIL!  In all meal mediocre several opportunities meet exceed expectations but none taken advantage of    server could noticed large clearly visible crack coffee mug If cast iron used presentation only there's no reason couldn't warmed keep its contents desired temperature  finally when asked add roasted corn dish server could suggested side instead basically telling Chef understands palate better do   I warm place heart Hash House recommended breakfast brunch many friends acquaintances alike only hope particular meal aberration  <EOR> Huge portions packed AM good wait table 6   But food came fast pancakes GINORMOUS!! <EOR> Finally breakfast something fun again   Hash House Go Go made breakfast hip fun again   food terrific   Giant portions flavorful unique delicious food     It expensive   for breakfast but original food     This place much more eggs hash browns   experience  <EOR> amazing delish food HUGE portions =leftovers more hash house enjoyment later!! whenever vegas again im def coming again breakfast brunch <EOR> I think expectations just high  other people said reviews saw place Man V  Food expected absolutely fantastic  But wasn't just   ordinary  Which sad  Maybe shouldn't scramble just boring plain no kick anything made special  tried friends 'Andy's Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict' also just boring tasting me    The portions huge though if staying hotel would recommend sharing plate because won't anywhere put your leftovers  MAYBE finished half food  charge split plate charge which just absolutely ridiculous me  should offer lower portions sizes lower prices but  just opinion    Also server kind rude  group 8 she brought bill  When told needed bills seperated she all pissy  Why would just expect group young adults pay bill?

Another thing didn't understand seemed uncooked or maybe flash fried? angel hair pasta sticking sides dish almost kitty catfish whiskers possibly added texture but more raw pasta chew stuck between teeth  Very odd addition   With all being said plates could probably feed two seasoned eaters light eating family four including small puppy  majority diners including myself referred bottomless pit before take home food later munching   Two meals price sort deal guess but really since dish $18 99 pretty much 2 3 biscuit mashed potato   One last thing guess mention Mark H original San Diego bit disappointed because he said now chain restaurant vibe he said he felt he Chilis but darker wood but better music   oh well  <EOR> They weren't kidding Twisted Farm Food stuff  Definitely twisted definitely humongous!!!

My dad loved it location strip nice away all hustle bustle  They very best biscuits sausage gravy! You must try homemade jam!  Their vanilla waffles outstanding serve them warmed syrup which really nice  Excellent service!!!!  Cons IF prefer mild medium coffee coffee SUCKS!!! My take it Thought bacon eggs breakfast should come more two wimpy pieces bacon  Thought outrageous breakfast came biscuit but add side gravy almost 3 dollars! mean good gravy but made gold? The woman's bathroom nicely maintained handicapped stall would lock   Bottom line food very good definitely come back  <EOR> The success Hash House may directly related frequency hangovers Vegas  Just sight leaning towers fried chicken waffles could cure your hangover faster IV hydration which freakishly enough service find easily Vegas     Opting fork knife remedy over surgical needles experience Hash House thoroughly therapeutic still very Vegas y  ambiance much different your local Denny's big booths neon colored cocktails tumbler sized glasses smiley waitresses  some outdoor seating fun 90s playlist background but real selling point MENU    It'll hard order anything but those famous sage fried chicken bacon stuffed waffles everyone Yelping about  But case you're anti poultry gluten free you'll still find something drool over gigantic menu  Homemade biscuits big salads scrambles benedicts crab cakes griddled cheese meatloaf all part uber American offerings  Prices also huge $18 chicken waffles $15 cocktails example  But wise share everything  party portions you've enough that    Shout waitress cool happily split check 4 ways without inkling annoyance  hooray fresh grapefruit pineapple mimosas $7    because quitting cold turkey isn't good anyone  <EOR> Thank Adam Richman Man vs  Food introducing place  haha  Sunday brunch place packed  told wait table 2 35 40 minutes but only waited 15 minutes    So food      Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict $14 95 the Man vs  Food Must share  HUGE oh good  Everything just together well   Snickers Flapjack $7 95 your basic flapjack pancake Snickers mixed in  served butter maple syrup  size flapjack huge  larger average sized dinner plate  Maybe just big table charger   large orange juice $5 50 Smores Mocha $6 25 looked tempting picture but kinda fell short me  sipping spooning eating top drink marshmallows floating drizzles chocolate syrup graham crackers side all left actual mocha drink joy drink died me  drink blah but all cool toppings yum    If decide come place bring your huge appetite share dish someone  <EOR> Smoked Salmon Benedict all time favorite!

Yelp Challenge! Started 8 20 2011 59 365   <EOR> What all hype about? Seemed Hash House good breakfast joint over 2 700 reviews averaging 4 stars  Unfortunately experience mediocre best   SERVICE Impeccable service friendly knowledgeable server  Forgot name but he very polite    FOOD My server briefly over menu said scrambles popular Farm Scrambles  three options different ingredients #3 which came sun dried tomato basil goat cheese    It $11 99 generous portion  Served griddled mashed crispy potato fresh fruits choice toast homemade biscuit  homemade biscuit extremely dry similar Popeye's chicken  Crispy potato overdone way past crispy  Scramble itself wasn't anything special  Made tomato basil goat cheese sprinkled top  Meh    Another thing  sorry say but HATE rosemary sprig use toasts biscuits  First all looks grass growing toast biscuit second all hate strong scent comes it  smell made sick immediately lost appetite when accidentally brushed against it     CONCLUSION Great service mediocre food  don't see myself coming back again unless stop using rosemary sprig  <EOR> This place reminds places back home! Real delicious quality food creative menu choices  lunch breakfast here  lunch huge dish Man Vs  Food  Even grandfather eating ended taking back condo both eating dinner too! breakfast remember less seeing 6am very drunk   good though  Everything fresh made perfection greasy thrown together  bloody mary greatest though  might stop again next time just those! <EOR> Great atmosphere unbelievable food!  Robert took great care very prompt  If looking unique twist classic breakfast would highly recommend place   worth 5 mile drive strip  <EOR> Hash Hash No No    The hubby talking wonderful place finally came lunch   seated right away but worse table facing kitchen garbage can doesn't exactly wet your appetite  could waited booth but crunch time lunch time   Strike 1  We very friendly waiter   He brought drinks quickly but Ice tea yucky strike 2 screw ice tea   asked soda exchange he promptly exchanged drink no problems   waiter super friendly  five stars service   Kiddo grilled cheese but cheese melted strike 3 took back back melted  split crab cake salad okay mean edible   digging decoration plate dried spaghetti sticks? didn't it   Also plate hard biscuit flavorless a piece paper would tasted better   Very disappointing   The stand cup cream corn chowder gets five stars honestly delish!!  I agree other yelpers servings disgustingly huge many customers plenty linebackers every table   if you've big appetite com here   Another 5 Star jamming tunes the place awesome music!   Lots pics wall celebrity guests Rachel Ray Martha Stewart etc  cool!  I think may still come back give another try maybe new chef order  <EOR> This may single greatest restaurant ever to  original San Diego Hilcrest unlike most Las Vegas versions good restaurants other places cough canters cough true original original amazing  No f ing joke if lived Hilcrest would weigh no less 465lbs because Hash House  If love breakfast love place  No question mind  both combined maybe 15 times never anything less great  If pork tenderloin hash that  Its ridiculous You love forever  <EOR> I brunch night strip because friend gone SD loved it  say everything dreamed might be  portions ridiculously large come hungry  food original waffles bacon baked in? yum! cooked perfectly  Service fast attentive nothing complain there  kind breakfast world seem right again  If you're Vegas need try place   The only reason didn't 5 stars because hard find  might partly fault since decided park Caesar's Palace parking lot   which completely different story   but restaurant inside Imperial Palace casino find your way through maze Vegas casino order there  <EOR> 3 1 2 stars more precise   I'm sure Hash House nice surge being featured Man vs  Food gratuitous plug Adam Richman coolest jobs world way    But me?  dunno overly impressed   kind middle road myself   I'm good eater   and Hash House serve BIG FOOD!  Portions ginormous meals often come platters size small hubcap   almost always leave little doggie bag leftovers!  Alas flavors food doesn't particularly sing palette   just seems you're going chain restaurant lots chain restaurant food all just kinda tastes same   bad but standout great   When combine muted flavors high prices no choice but knock down star two   But perhaps fault   People rave place great deal breakfast when showcase best things Hash House   ended going dinner maybe review somewhat off kilter   But gotta off ate pains say but all average   We shared Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Bacon Waffle Tower $18    saw pics platter online thought gotta that   all?  ok   fried chicken hot juicy but couldn't into batter dip in   tad thick side way chicken   Also flavor just bland bland bland   spicy savory sweet decent fried chicken   very plain   waffles stuffed whole strips bacon?  Impressive but again off flavors   smoked bacon delicious its own but waffle needed some seasoning hot maple reduction couldn't offer   waffle nice crisp chewy inside though waffle should be   We also shared Andy's Twisted Stuffed Burgers $15    roasted beef smoked mozzarella charred tomato it   came HUGE stack which course made near impossible eat   cut into tinier portions just pick up!  Doing made stuffed burger very uneven tasting   hard time getting meld bite included all fixings burger   time finally eat burger juices patty made bottom bun extra SOGGY   hate that   again flavors just seemed subdued somehow   No zip no zing no tang no mas!  really just struck average burger   honestly better less money   first place suggest use dash MSG food?  However fries crisp delicious    Speaking sharing   there none unless being charged it!  Seriously charged $4 5 fee if sharing plate   seems bit highway robbery if ask me   serve large portion so so food then punish if want share?  see why obesity rates high US   your best bet order two plates food or entree large side if you're couple avoid dumb fee altogether   just more leftovers take home     Speaking leftovers   we left Hash House 3 yes 3 containers food ride home!  indeed ate all could left full but satisfied   few hours later decided some leftovers midnight snack but again met mediocre   leftovers didn't hold well all!  Fried chicken soggy and still bland burger gone rubbery side   disappointed thinking throwing away all food ended eating anyway   finer moments   The main reason why still give 3 1 2 star because service   waitress very attentive pleasant kept drinks filled without much fuss   She some mad strong forearms defined!  Must all heavy duty platter lifting going there   Hate say Hash House but think if ever try place again breakfast brunch   Please work seasoning your food!  Thanks k bye! <EOR> Yes Adam Richman aka Man vs Food filmed here  Yes potions huge  Yes dishes unique wonder if all work together  does!

Hash perfect   could found more ideal restaurant   ordered granola cereal fruit which turned very large bowl fresh granola great tasting fruit water melon black berries blue berries banana raspberries pineapple all fresh quite tasty! I also partner special granola peach pancake which tasted agreed fantastic way much! The service excellent met all needs without asking! I really idea only following status quo usual routine breakfast food clever progressive options also menu!   Look forward next visit! <EOR> Came early dinner since side town  Monday place busy   I ordered 16 oz bone rib eye steak waitress requested cheddar bacon mashed instead sweet potato mashed  she left realized she didn't ask wanted steak cooked advised kitchen  When waitress returned she advised weren't going charge extra change order time but future $4 95 extra  Overall food yummy steak cooked medium rare requested sides carrots asparagus included even slices prosciutto added touch  cheddar covered bacon mashed delish included two full size strips bacon!   After completing meal waitress dropped bill reviewed but she charged $4 95 extra charge Cheddar mashed WTH? also disturbing she didn't ask if wanted dessert  advised wanted banana cheesecake huge but flat tasting  few bites left balance advised waitress  She said she would advise chef but when she returned bill charged $2 75 coffee which didn't order   pointed waitress she took bill readjusted tab again   In closing main entree didn't disappoint Hash but service rookie waitress horrendous  She never did mention word flat cheesecake! <EOR> I Hash House several times over years usually when friends town   only when group friends want go   really isn't places   food but don't think super special     Yes huge servings almost always leftovers bring home which plus but enough diehard HH fan   complaint would food doesn't ton flavor   lot different items always sound good look beautiful great presentation but almost always food lacking flavor   Everything bland me   always add ton salt pepper hot sauce syrup something add some flavor   love chicken waffles general but chicken always lacking seasoning  think Kokomo sandwich quite tasty though!  I probably keep ending HH occasionally because many friends love place   keep giving chance when am because concept idea place   said think ok just nothing amazing  <EOR> I live Southern California meaning try Hash House San Diego but never opportunity   When arrived Vegas realized handful around try it   course chicken waffles   When food came wowed presentation   Looks totally amazing over top   First bites fried chicken fried leeks very tasty   first quadrant waffle also pretty good   But then just overwhelming   chicken unevenly cut certain parts chicken overcooked center good but obviously crispy   waffles soggier side waffles crunchy   batter little chewy taste well   syrup just decent   nice pat butter would helped   Personally favorite part dish fried leeks   Coming Southern California course some great chicken waffles Roscoe's hello!  Roscoe's blows Hash House water terms chicken waffles separate entities entire well constructed dish whole   only ate piece fried chicken two squares waffle because full but because just overwhelming   chicken waffle both sogged little fast decided would taste pretty similarly if re heated microwave next day I right    actually home ate second dinner because meal left much desired   +1 star novelty +1 huge portions +1 fried leeks  <EOR> This place no joke  Come extremely hungry home extremely full! Mimosa red velvet dessert waffles extras complete your meal  Hash scrambled chicken waffles beyond delicious  Ask Jessica  <EOR> This place alright   There something when walked where overwhelmingly smelled heavily delicious breakfast foods  usually big fan chicken waffles back home found fitting order Sage Fried Chicken Bacon Waffles   I definitely hate compare Roscoe's but HH takes different approach  given 4 pieces fluffy waffles two chicken breast pieces really decent price was  did enjoy meal but something made really want waffles thinner just use heavy butter grease flavor  oh yeah portions where huge! I understand NY Times favorite featured Man vs  Food  probably hit miss deal ordering chicken waffles but rest items menu looked really good well    Something really wants give place chance   Chances coming back? Possibly  <EOR> My husband restaurant today reviewing W Sahara location only because dying some good French toast since moved seriously missing Cracker Barrel!  checking reviews Yelp decided give Hash House try  And very glad did fantastic!  love inside place vibe very diner y upbeat   seated immediately even tho noon weekday   service good 3 different people taking care us   appreciate when servers busy fellow servers help them instead just leaving patrons hanging    Anyway both ordered Tractor Driver combo Griddled French Toast eggs sausage bacon   Plus coffee course   both ate almost everything huge plates   lunch 12 30 today now almost 6 30 p m  neither hungry yet   Well worth $13 per plate which think perfectly reasonable    French Toast perfect consistency loved it   Everything else just good! I so so coffee but prefer coffee weak   husband likes coffee strong possible when think tastes dirt bottom used ash tray he's happy  enjoyed very much even asked brand is   Also other minor points deducted having ask and then wait briefly more silverware napkins then extra syrup   Would give 4 5 stars if Yelp! would let me!  We back soon am very glad went   Highly recommend it! <EOR> It second time friend's first time  vegetarian options rather limiting but some options  location Saturday Dec 10 around 1 00 p m  ish  No lines seated immediately    Service friendly portions large  sure if deejay all time but he Saturday boy annoying  didn't seem place restaurant where music quieter  could conversation entire meal  If technique insure quick turnover tables succeeded table  think less 30 minutes    We ordered scramble sundried tomatoes grilled cheese sandwich friend  Both seemed more manageable massive portions waffles chicken wheel sized pancakes  scramble OK grilled potatoes cold halfway through meal  Best part meal biscuit  friend appreciated grilled cheese sandwich but could only eat half took rest home box    With tip meal $40  guess least once see if all hubbub TV worth you  Perhaps without loud music may enjoyed more  deejay heavy base ruined experience  enjoy food having feel base music chest  place located rather depressing shopping mall feels all bit dingy dirty  <EOR> Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict!!!

And no    it's strip club go go dancers serve breakfast! Even though know Vegas all    So San Diego location really enjoyed place   When found Vegas figured must check out  disappointed!

We large party ordered number different dishes  lots food shared try everything  Andy's Fried Chicken Benedict awesome blueberry pancake big almost fell off plate  Andy's Chicken Waffles which totally enjoyed but really liked and probably order next time French Toast   topped banana cinnamon cream pecan maple syrup   Aww man bomb diggy diggy   It's just size food but presentation great too   Some dishes looked good weren't sure if should eat just admire bit  ended taking few pics grub   Props server awesome very attentive  Took care well quick refill drinks   Only thing found weird there's no hash browns menu   name Hash House you'd think they'd it   bro ordered crispy potatoes thinking same but unfortunately not  Just crispified blocks potatoes which still good anyway   may ask server hash brown thing next time and next time! Overall totally recommend coming if Vegas   Prices affordable its much better many breakfast buffets town   Prepare move your belt few notches over when you're done  <EOR> Just impressed twisted farm food Sahara location I'd be  Things great when twists wicked like fairly straightforward chicken waffles   However some dishes just sin salmon fried cornmeal crust just gross way treat fish   Service spotty sometimes feel just fawn over other times pulling teeth glass water  no else annoyed odd fried vermicelli sprigs rosemary?

Hash House Quesadilla Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict  Snickers Flapjacks  also ordered multiple drinks take home glasses only couple bucks more! food amazing service excellent  atmosphere restraunt great its nice seeing all reviews awards restraunt earned  Vegas once year coming back! <EOR> I'm originally Los Angeles since moving Vegas 3 years ago chance lay hands any good chicken waffles wishing Roscoes Vegas too   A friend told wanting Hash House only being once which San Diego familiar menu  She told Chicken Waffles suddenly craving just couldn't resist finally made try place again   I disappointed! Chicken tender flavor slighty better Roscoes  only thing better roscoes drown waffles butter haha but better health wise  Now just thinking forgot order mash potatoes gravy side   Roscoes cheaper even if remembered hash house might charged another $10 just those sides   4 fat waffles comes also bacon it   only able finish 2 which beyond filling   I also tried snickers pancake  Snickers pancake huh?

Breakfast Lunch dinner all delicious  I actually came massive hangover 21st birthday  Made feel 1000 times better! FYI bell pepper burger BEYOND WORLD GOOD!   The only con wait long but honestly worth wait  <EOR> came because highly recommended locals   ordered chicken waffles chorizo hash  person ordered chicken waffles because he told best person ever had   just ok   presentation unlike anything ever seen   lot work thought put into but when your presentation better food itself   kind issue  chorizo hash   made chorizo would think would flavorful spicy but nope just bland   meh  also told couldn't add anything into protect the recipe    know bland zero flavor chorizo recipe  waited server 10 mins before he came greet us  order wrong then gave check before even finished eating! worked food service am usually understanding because situations but no apology no sincerity no nothing place needs over itself focus recipes work hard protect   first very last time going place   should just waited Egg I    same wait time but decided hash hash because highly recommended  <EOR> I fearful would another overrated tourist trap but blown away  Portions huge big guy only eat half plate when visit   eyed pancakes chicken waffles other dishes coming out    there's no way could finish any them   Presentation food pushes into five star range  great job   I've two skillet plates pork tenderloin sandwich every time food delicious  BLT Bloody Mary special treat   If peak hours you're probably going long wait table   why try never any popular eatery during peak hours if help it  <EOR> Ambiance nice  Service Good very good Food better I fried chicken waffles   some reason food greasy   chicken over cooked dry   wonder if chicken fried beforehand then re fried order   waffles crunchy outside tender moist middle   waffles soggy pliable   buddy tried waffle agreed   didn't even finish dinner which shocked friends     amount food stopped me   grease   known power down 2 entrees restaurants including soup salad   My buddies chicken pot pie meat loaf pasta   try both them which very good   would order those next time   biscuits very good  The question is    Would back again?

And don't forget bite someone's biscuit fresh jam if yours doesn't come one!  One thing said while see pancakes popular personally care very thick style pancakes  pancakes almost 3 times thick regular pancake 4 times large area wise  But again  more personal preference negative review  <EOR> Hash House GoGo must when coming Vegas food   refreshing alternative glut cheap buffets overly priced epicurean restaurants   portion sizes humongous well having different twist homestyle foods     The sage fried chicken waffles always sure winner   Fried chkn always fresh crisp waffles bacon right int them   Pour syrup over whole thing come winner unlike casinos   Their meatloaf your standard classic meatloaf but without any cheap meat taste   only thing didn't care much meatloaf sandwich use canned tomatoes top   gave very unrefined feel whole thing clashed butter toasted milk bread smoky cheese   The banana brown sugar pancakes worth waking even if means still hung over   pancakes nice amount banana cooked brown sugar marvelous crunchy texture well rounded sweetness     The eggs benedict dishes hash dishes piled high probably enough two share another meal later   kiwi watermelon lemonade also feast eyes layers into 3 different colors star attraction table     Of course no perfect experienced many other Yelpers brought up   Service really mediocre really did seem care   food took over 45 min time ordered server said she would refills but would charge them   Great way comp your customers!  When food did finally come dish time 5 min intervals   also messed orders   I think if anticipate mediocre service should ok   food! <EOR> Our party 6 finally act together grab brunch around 1 30pm Saturday though suppose then actually lunch waited patiently 30 minutes empty stomachs growled early dinner light night evening prior  time seated ravenous  Everything menu looked good    When walked eyed other patron's dishes unless you're competing Man vs  Food those portions regular human consumption  opted order 3 dishes share  Instead paying $2 per plate surcharge you're allowed add side waive fee might well something if pay anyway! opted sides fruit scrambled eggs bacon    We wanted diversify selections ordered sundried tomato basil goat cheese Farm Scramble which served potatoes biscuit vegetarian selection which included all favorite ingredients! some bacon stuffed waffle thing topped sage fried chicken finally farmed benedict   I only speak sundried tomato basil goat cheese farm scramble since others meat them scramble delicious!!  portion size smaller other dishes ordered but still plenty share  service good inhaling food just 15 minutes ordered waters refilled frequently    Bottom line Hash House definitely worth trip strip just sure bring big appetite along prepared least 30 minute wait all times day! <EOR> Service quite rushed server didn't truly pay attention whether liked drinks which sugary couldn't taste liquor well because  full tomato juice  Noticeably tables don't wiped down  but automatically set top mess even being over staffed seem forget important buss tables outside  Just poor service bad table manners even if food decent  going  hard want come back  partner managed enough businesses restaurants know today's brunch messed up  <EOR> This Hash House best!  bring all out of town guests Hash House!  food portions flavors over top!  staff over top well   must locals visitors   Keep up! <EOR> I came because man vs food disappointed  food very meh  coming back  <EOR> If your food good big then place go!

Reasons two star deduction basically customer service A When entered young female front took long time figure customers waiting her  when asked outside seating she said take 10 minutes  But co worker behind says table ready us  She seemed confused followed guy outdoor seating  communication part needs fixed    B food came orderly time around 10 minutes which wasn't bad humongous portions given  HOWEVER servers sloppy when handed plates  First Lady brought friends plate first clumsily lays front her  plate dropped server turned orange slice slipped off plate landed friends lap  never seen anyone careless putting plate down table    Another different lady came plate minutes presentation just pretty  fried sage literally hanging off plate when saw coming   biggest pet peeve because don't care way looks I doubt since all food looks spectacular just overall clumsy    C Lastly lack customer interaction just there  guess  perks being outside? check took them good 10 minutes finally come back check us    Even though first experience rocky know back soon hopefully redeem great restaurant  Till next time  <EOR> Warning If can't handle portions Jenny Craig Go   Hash House place people just can't seem enough breakfast lunch any meal matter   Monstrous portions name game   watermelon kiwi drink seems most popular but prefer iced coffee drinks     Prices joint little steep but portions more that!  You might want try come earlier morning mid morning crowd seems fill lobby endless line tables   If you're mood pig bring friend split plate     All all can't really wrong place   coming back more  <EOR> Service below average  food art   Art didn't much taste   Just stacked waffles chicken put bunch if unnecessary stuff look bigger  I live without going back   <EOR> More just huge portions Creative  Delicious  Memorable   Just take example ordered selection benedicts Andy's Sage Fried Chicken $16 99 bit pricey but pretty much two meals   ordered knowing would arrive front would well thought mound food shaped form artful sculpture must've sat good minute taking pictures attempted figure where start chowing down   did disappoint pleasantly surprised find nice kick chipotle cream  YUM   An extra bonus point coming kitchen rather quick timing especially considering busyness Christmas Day was    The environment better expected  Vegas more few years noticed every damn weekend driving place HH crowd people front   always discouraged trying but crowds waiting avoided if travel alone four just heading bar area counter well bar tables   If waiting can't avoided kill some time checking celebrities that've stopped headshots all over entrance   If come back huge party gotta pre planned reserved whatever because waiting table when you're hungry sucks   But more likely come back bar happy hour everyday 3p 6p   <EOR> DAM PLACE GOOOD!

Great service excellent variety great cookin' ! <EOR> Yes yes portions sizes outrageous the chicken salad sandwich pushing 12 inches high food excessive a bacon bloody mary aka BLT Mary both which fine  But let's honest real highlight going Hash House utterly amazing buttermilk biscuits fresh fruit preserves!   The service really good super friendly attentive  But back biscuits  massive size everything else but baked perfectly crust support weight peach pear preserves when spooned yet still soft chewy middle  Delicious  Shame all other diners restaurant didn't touch biscuits  Don't know starving people corner booth aka would love own?

Still most delicious spot off strip! <EOR> Quant little place brunch!  always driven but never stopped in   Food decent atmosphere good     Prices also reasonable portion sizes but find draw back really don't want much food especially breakfast brunch!  Also now am thinking food actually somewhat bland most notably gravy potatoes   scramble which pretty good though its just all sides waste   Drinks good champagne supernova which mojito made prosecco rather rum which good!    Service friendly when but server wasn't table very often couldn't really figure server perhaps because seating bar area 20 min F A wait sure   We also charged wrong price entree decided speak manager sadly argued rather just talking care problem   Disappointing   Overall decent but nothing special want return  <EOR> Come if prefer quantity over quality style over substance   Bonus star Bjork autographed menu display  <EOR> Great food only reason place gets 3 stars   waiting almost hour table settling sit bar area bit annoying  staff very rude arrogant seemed bothering staff whenever needed something   said food great but unless regular know you     be prepared lackluster service  <EOR> I thought Cheesecake Factory only restaurant serves oversize portions boy wrong! Hash House serves gigantic portions its unique menu items Chicken Waffles elegant prepared Mahi Mahi blue crab cake   Hubby others ordered special night which Chicken Waffles $12 95 compared $18 something other nights  When came taller sitting down course   very surprised chicken 2 thick pieces huge breast meat  chicken crispy little sweet glaze  thought batter may need little bit more seasoning but still decent   I ordered Mahi Mahi blue crab cake $27   presentation looked fancy 5 stars restaurant gorgeous  taste different but good enough almost finished entire entree  dish started bed two mounds mashed potatoes then layered two pieces Mahi Mahi then blue crab cake which covered pesto sauce  also came side carrots   Over all experience enjoyable because entree fun look atmosphere nice   The service great  arrived 30 minutes before closing still sat all seven down friendly smile  didn't rush anything even though felt bad  <EOR> yup most people reviewed place also came because man vs  food   enjoyed place much came 2 mornings row last week   morning 1 little before 8am  didnt wait seated right away   waitress cindy super pleasant nice   ordered house favorite scrambles roasted chicken corn roasted peppers mozzarella cheese  also came biscuit fruit which melon pineapple your choice griddled mashed potatoes crispy potatoes i griddled mashed potatoes    wife ordered tractor driver combo 2 eggs bacon extra crispy vanilla waffle   both enjoyed meals really wanted try other dishes which why came back for           morning 2 little later today  around 830   boy difference made  lot more crowded wait 10 minutes seated   altho nothing compared hours some other yelpers wait!  today ordered sage fried chicken waffles   thing HUGE   wife ordered 2 breakfasts today because she could mind last day vegas gonna back while   she farm scramble hardwood smoked bacon avocado onions it came swiss cheese but she ordered without    she also ordered granola waffle   did stop eating part breakfast   she gonna order bacon waffle but since she saw breakfast came she decided granola waffle just help herself bacon waffle   fed wife = happy wife   everything hashouse good  portions huge tho gotta come hungry   ended taking home part granola waffle which she did eat later day   yes according still tastes good hours later  <EOR> Very good service VERY filling food   signature fried chicken waffles   3 4 thick Belgian style waffles 2 THICK pieces fried chicken mostly boneless which like! plethora sage big cup syrup top all off   When 8 15pm night fairly slow Friday think missed dinner rush   No matter   server told lot food person but brought appetite   2 3rd's through before calling quits   Next time might share plate someone chicken sandwich fries   It 20 00 but worth it   share next time   Also very popular place famous people all autographed photos posters around them praising company  <EOR> it's all WOW factor when bring huge plate food   quality lacking thought we'd rather dennys next time   coffee bottom barrel both time nothing flavored available   should really ask spoon butter creamer splenda because waiter andrew terrible  no toilet paper loo?
