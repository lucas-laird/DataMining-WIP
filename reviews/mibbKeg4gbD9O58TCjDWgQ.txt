Smallest most expensive burrito compared rest locations  tortilla super hard place pretty dirty  also charge extra $1 25 if use your debit card    place worth would recommend different location  <EOR> First all let preface review saying love Roberto's  mean shit you're hearing guy once ate 18 days row when first moved Phoenix  Dead serious check 4 square think still mayor?   However specific location amateur hour  ESPECIALLY Friday late night crew  often made order crystal fuckin' clear only home open complete disaster  only order muff job but shit burnt raw  Maybe because multiple people take order maybe because lead cashier busy buying weed customer back    Whatever issue hope gets fixed because while never eat location again hope confidence once Roberto's name restored may allowed quench carne asada fries thirst without fuckery non professionals    P S  ALWAYS tip mother fuckers  believe shit? WTF problem? <EOR> I robertos location small but service quick  food good good price  didn't charge per debit transaction fee  only downfall  <EOR> This isn't usual Roberto's location but nailed tonight   refried beans smooth cheese enchilada perfectly melted cheese guacamole delicious chunks raw onion it     I might check location again see if keep up! <EOR> Not good other Roberto taco shops  decent but sometimes your order wrong don't seem add much toppings nachos other Roberto's do  Still maybe worth visit  <EOR> Usually great but every time come location problems  Today order chili colorado when home open 6 chunks meat  often order ar evey other location never problem  When brought back all she could say sorry  pay hard earned money people don't care rip off! <EOR> Excellent food price right  Obviously ambiance  Although no problem sitting down eating tables which all clean  <EOR> An MA student Brightwood College am proud customer friend thode work location  professional dealing customers recipe down  show window monitor work  Rated best LV 2007 <EOR> They actually charge 1 29 taco Wednesday which usually 1 00 hardly put any meat save your money taco bell actually more meat fried hard break your teeth  Pure fried shells less teaspoon chopped chicken meat shredded! <EOR> No adobada nachos aka pastor tonight  Really!

Some locations run ice don't air summer but always both   only thing marking them down sometimes grease puddles plate  Letting fried food drip second keeping oil hotter would fix moving them perfect score  <EOR> Roberto's sub par Mexican food begin but when add dirty restaurant  Rude service employee behind counter old salas condiments just worse  called ahead order then when 10 minutes later wasn't ready cashier said almost done making now  cook hadn't even started order yet  home order wrong  back then he argued order being wrong would only remake burritos  took whole uneaten cut half to share two others order back restaurant  He put gloves then took old order opened inspect  discussing anatomy dissected burritos he concluded only made incorrectly could back correct order he wrapped back me    <EOR> Figured place could use recent review last almost year ago  only Roberto's few times first time visiting particular one  just moved far away decided stop way home night out  definitely most glamorous place but guy register kind outgoing liked see into kitchen watch everything on  1am believe its better non fast food options  breakfast burrito huge I actually wish smaller option bit heavy late night meal    however very tasty  sure back now close  always see bunch people when drive location must fairly well despite negative reviews  Hopefully experiences stay positive moving forward! <EOR> I'm huge fan Roberto's but TWO meals recommend 3 Rolled tacos beef w guacamole CARNE ASADA FRIES minus beans location ONLY! far only ones found serve crinkly fries which fave! <EOR> The food usually very good however tonight service horrible food very subpar young kid looks young lineman register taking care all friends while other people waited food young man served friends   hoping catch owner when she present inform ridiculous situation no longer location  <EOR> The cashier over charged food when brought attention manager she just rude !!!! great she's workers but she needs learn listen customer complaints without getting offended  told wouldn't come back location she laughed said okay!
