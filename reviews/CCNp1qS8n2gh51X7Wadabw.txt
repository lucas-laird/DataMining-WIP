You've some nerve! There's no way Vince ever ate cause food would killed he would killed himself shame retribution people accidentally ate me  Better options Taco Bell outhouse vending machine food state prison your vomit toilet just puked in  Instead incarcerating Vince crime humanity Vince's punishment should Vince Neal tatuado experience waiting forever horrible food being forced listen terrible music relevant 5 seconds 100 years ago  <EOR> Oh Vince living Vegas should know better  First all chips salsa really? If going southwest Mexican style restaurant lowest expectation fresh chips  Bagged chips acceptable  food mediocre best  beef burrito no beans came only rice inside no beef! only reason giving 1 star because margarita good service good  <EOR> Oh Vince   done?  all true those other reviews   came looking killer Mexican sorely disappointed   hostess told full menu bar guess what?

WTF?  ridiculous  would think twice returning  <EOR> Let's preface review acknowledging fact am big Motley Crue Vince Neil fan   That being said    disappointed quite unimpressed experience Tatuado   hostess confused uncertain job   server stopped while she escorting table quietly yelling while pointing gesturing I wanted say Excuse me    wait until she isn't customer this?    waiter ok but also seemed little dazed confused     The food   Well    Guacamole all right suppose   Chips semi stale sour cream little warm liking   Everything seemed pretty generic Chicken Nacho appetizer Enchiladas Buffalo Wings   Margaritas pretty standard except Vince's tequila Tatuado branding     This definitely somewhere wanted experience being fan but also one and done me   wont returning unless some major shakeup happens reviews place become stellar over period time    keep eye seen stranger things!    Vince Your music great your tattoo shop damn good    why hire more competent management staff your restaurant keep quality?  #Disappointed  <EOR> The chips salsa delicious quesadilla yummy  margaritas great but bit pricey! nice rock atmosphere  <EOR> I would put 0 stars if option      Pros Absolutely nothing  Cons Plastic plates silverware Terrible service Taquitos frozen kind buy grocery store seriously?!
