Since many people raved taro smoothie ordered first visit  watched them smoothie which essentially just whole lot powder which standard   But some reason expecting something more since people rave quality ingredients  Artificial powder quality ingredient now? Okay then  smoothie done blending added scoop fresh taro top  smoothie okay little powdery times fresh taro more afterthought  just tasted every other boba shop's taro smoothie  only taro smoothie blown away thus far fresh taro blended into actual smoothie very little powder   On next visit decided try another more popular drinks   take sea salt jasmine green tea  drink better taro smoothie  tea strong sea salt added nice flavor component  sucked drink though fact wasn't able evenly distribute sea salt cream  Since Brew Tea Bar uses lids pop off on completely sealed ones most Boba shops use   hard mixed  just swirl cup straw going  little frustrating   Overall Brew Tea Bar good  just don't think world everyone else does  drinks normal tastes similar lot other places to  But definitely best service everyone  <EOR> I really place  couple times impressed  extensive menu but more simple most other tea houses   The prices very fair! think actually perfect mix good price unique product pleasant service   I recommend getting crepe adding ice cream any milk teas  offer honey boba egg custard alternative regular boba small charge    I am giving them 4 instead five friend drink way later mine  truly understand some drinks take longer others but big rush taken care super quick before hers  Probably 12 16 drinks  mad but just pointing where could improve  <EOR> Two milk alternatives soy almond vegan individuals sure double check which items vegan non dairy creamers still contains animal products  Couldn't honey boba opted crystal boba made agar  ordered several drinks to go but opted stay chat letting drinks melt   Louis came over offered remake drinks because he saw melted  Great customer service them stand competitors  <EOR> I really enjoyed matcha milk tea love option customize sweetness  wish somebody some tea shop would able explain difference between milk tea tea latte??? No matter  girls mango tea latte boba even sweet them  Lesson learned  The food options pretty limited just crepes when in  crepes all but tend take while make  would really appreciate something already case    cookies? cakes? It's solid tea place but little far drive way  Brew Tea Bar East side please??? <EOR> Brew tea literally best boba Las Vegas hands down  boba soft stays soft until finish your drink  hate those boba balls hard awhile  always order same thing mango green tea boba mango tea latte sea salt foam boba  always packed though but  good them cuss business popping  workers always nice work hard your drinks quick  Another bonus stamp reward system have  believe buy 10 drink next free regular size   If wanna upgrade your drink large just pay difference  love place can't thank employees enough fast service  Keep good work! <EOR> Forget any other boba spot town   BrewTeaBoys this    I'm usually picking caffeinated concoction before work while always BTB never really content drink because other places sweet when specifically asked adjustment   hint sweetness ok but anymore irritating   guys knows exactly drinks first try too!
