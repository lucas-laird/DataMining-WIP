Don't woo'd three Michelin starts  food mediocre best portions tiny  service good enough but even waiter didn't seem excited menu when asked recommendations specific dishes  would better off throwing all money green zero roulette table  least then would know throwing your money away  <EOR> I recently dined Bar Masa new ARIA Hotel CityCenter Las Vegas   Having heard Chef Masayoshi Takayama holder 3 Michelin Stars more excited dine new restaurant   We ate restaurant 12 20 09 less week ARIA opened   4 people party   The decor inside generic best   Cold concrete floors walls throughout gave restaurant zero personality   expected your usual Japanese restaurant decorations fans masks kimonos tatami mats but frankly restaurant could any other restaurant    Italian restaurant steakhouse even 24 hour hotel coffee shop decor would fine   said generic best   Getting down food disappointed menu's selection   ARIA website did menu online restaurant look ahead time but checking menu Bar Masa NYC figured menu would similar   wrong   menu good selection sushi sashimi but when came hot items lacking   couple Yakitori skewers items couple udon soba some fried rice soups other items very inspiring much different usual Japanese fare   felt menu watered down cater towards general masses used miso soups california rolls   note restaurant serves la carte style no entrees   We ended ordering sashimi box sushi box   Unfortunately waiter very familiar menu could quite confirm included boxes   He guessed 6 7 types sashimi maybe 13 pieces sushi   boxes $99 each   Food brought wooden crates letters B M  written side which made all giggle because Bar Masa first thing thought when think B M stood for   don't understand why chose use crates over trays   looked cheap way try different   addition crates hid food waiters brought them don't really see others  ordering   Unfortunately remember number pieces sushi sashimi boxes either   remember absolutely delicious   sashimi sadly sliced very small very thin   However surprised see 3 pieces toro even though 3 pieces equaled regular piece sashimi normally would regular sushi bar   fish extremely fresh tasted such fresh sashimi sushi since dining Matsuhisa   Even simple maguro tuna delicious   price boxes very fair sushi sashimi grade   In addition boxes also ordered favorite flying fish roe tobiko   waiter somehow ordered ikura instead   Big oversight book   ended getting both both also delicious   Lastly finished off meal Kobe beef garlic fried rice winter mushroom fried rice   While don't generally order fried rice restaurants something shared everyone table   fried rice $28 each   The fried rice typical egg stir fried style fried rice find Asian restaurants   First used brown rice almost looks risotto   no egg used rice taste more flavor ingredients   very well done even though Kobe beef cut into small cubes which unfortunate since really taste beautiful flavor tenderness Kobe beef   winter mushroom fried rice very flavorful enjoyed quite bit   We opted skip dessert instead incredible Jean Philippe Patisserie inside ARIA   Including drinks several bottles beer bill came $100 per person   average high end restaurant   Even though food ate excellent decor service uninspiring menu made dining experience less memorable  <EOR> I am starving eating here  place ridiculously expensive  Vegas expected place where spend money totally understandable  But wow  Sake noodles miso soup $300  quantity food tiny  Come let people eat geeZ  <EOR> So If writing food alone would probably give 3 stars maybe even four if cost less  However cost place would definetely somewhere else   Based upon review certain white suited self proclaimed food critic town here   $120 Omakase menu    First off decor thought nice over all but looing for  front door impressive but inside place bit trendy which could appreciate but really looking nice classy dinner somewhere playing pop music background  alone though wouldn't knock down star for  But service lacking  ask multiple times water glass refilled  ask twice sake menu waiting awhile first time  busser kept trying take plate while still food still eating  courses he brought while husband still bathroom he mumbles off     couldn't understand life when tried ask he said he quickly wandered off   life kept thinking he said some sort tongue but then trying figured cod    The servers work mastered art making eye contact thus making poor service even worse  truly felt flailing arms try noticed more water    Ok food say ten courses few them excellent  toro tartare cavier extraordinary liked thinly sliced wagyu white truffle  However presentation nothing ordinary neither sushi if which piece red snapper squid toro blue fin tuna   having ten crouses spending close $150 person left hungry ended hitting Roberto's way home    All all disappointed  Based upon cost experience would definetely try elsewhere emphatic recommendation white suited self proclaimed food critic now recommendations only given weight deserves     researching yelp! <EOR> Dined group five mostly sushi some sashimi couple drinks each less $500  If your idea indulgence trip Vegas then place you  Everyone group without exception loved food  None connoisseurs but know last night sushi melts your mouth delicious medley flavors something come across often  spicy tuna unanimous favorite  Bonnie server made sure ordered dish couple others devoured no time  She knowledgeable cheerful believed quality restaurant she's working six years again rare combination made great experience  Quantity enough fill five hungry guys comfortable way without feeling stuffed  Would dine again absolutely! <EOR> Don't waste your time money appetite here  Bar Masa joke  Really  try pass off cold interior good but great food fine dining experience exorbitant pricing  Only if want profess ripped off when paid $30 bowl rice little beef kibble oh but kobe! $16 few udon noodles  husband ordered sushi literally child size inch across fish cut extremely thin could see rice below through it  Don't mistake am willing pay fine dining experience hence initial presence restaurant  However very unpleasantly surprised  If too  <EOR> The worst food never want eat again?we spent almost $300 2 people 8 dishes salty oil     <EOR> This place good food fist tastes fresh dishes innovative   BUT completely OVERPRICED why am only giving place 2 stars   portions extremely small but super pricey   am petite Asian girl even still hungry spending $379 for 3 people meal   Even though food tasty simply did justify price   However if insist coming recommend dishes Peking duck foie gras moo shu skin $26 for 4 bite size pieces Wagyu beef tataki truffle $48 $68  Sweet shrimp scallop ceviche $22  Again keep mind dishes SMALL most made shared b t 2 people 3 people max   <EOR> So great Japanese beer selection fantastic sake collection quality fish better then expected mass restaurant    However service atrocious we'll never back   $200+ head just acceptable  <EOR> Ate Masa evening 1 1 16  lobster miso soup $18 sashimi tasting $140 seafood pasta $24 bowl  While food fine the seafood pasta actually made seafood very delicious could believe ripped off felt sashimi platter  five different selections mouthful each  any other sushi place amount sashimi would cost $15  even asked waitress if just first round she said no  I never finished meal two restaurant pay $350 tip walked feeling still hungry did Masa  Not worth it  Profoundly disappointed  There many other fine Japanese restaurants Las Vegas choose from  <EOR> Getting caught yelp posting   always behind when take trip Vegas always leads lots new places   staying Aria trip wanted give different restaurants try   Being big fans Asian food most definitely list   First really did enjoy meal   service really great some good times talking server   headed 7PM show before everyone else   room itself really big tastes   massive room some could say feels airport terminal size   prefer sushi much more cozy setting   other negative price point   place way expensive   mind always add $ everything Vegas but really over top   Those two items forced knock down stars down   The food really good   sushi very fresh great presentation   tried number different items enjoyed all flavors   say good meal but price point just throws off curve  <EOR> Do hesitate! If care budget  Food best ever tried  I actually understand why restaurant low scores  Yes very pricey small portion but worth course going disappointed if think local AllYOU CAN EAT restaurants   Very high end style food quality  UNI AMAEBI TORO AMAZING sometimes run because Chinese men Sushi different  hate fat big rice portion usually provided local restaurants but sushi perfect taste fish  I also heard use Evian water cook steam rice soup  wOw        I strongly recommend Toro Caviar which toast toro caviar  It best menu think even though little bit expensive   Overall anyways upscale restaurant expensive but place entirely different other Japanese restaurants  <EOR> Exceptional food service! eating years always great experience eating here! <EOR> I angry dining Barmasa last night!! Yes definitely overpriced but expected excellent service  didn't it  2 year old needed know big portions would able know many dishes needed order  When asked waiter he gave weird look said high end restaurant only serve small portions blah blah blah   So didn't know much order  Just tell small your portions would be   all need know   don't need your insulting lecture!  But there's more  middle meal both daughter napkin dirty  asked waiter if he could give two new napkins  He wouldn't take away dirty napkins though  Instead he wanted put dirty napkins tray  He acted he afraid touch napkins  kidding me? He claimed high end restaurant but clear own napkins!  just horrible  don't think worth spending top dollar such terrible dining experience  don't even remember ate last night even ended spending over $200! only bad memories left  <EOR> Literally worst food ever eaten! paid $140  dry tasteless shrimp sliced cucumber olive oil it  service terrible! saw server three times once when ordered once when slop once when he dumped check lap  wouldn't recommend place worst enemy!

Different   I ordered unagi roll avocado company ordered California roll since didn't know else lol  unagi roll came 5 pieces good  California roll came 6 pieces made date sick  also ordered calamari appetizer which became inedible few bites   Our total around $90 two rolls calamari appetizer Fiji water   Definitely worth it  <EOR> Food average some dishes ok but everything definitely overpriced  let them trick into thinking portion sizes big normal people leave place hungry  don't even remember ate memorable  guy took drink order very pushy  Terrible dinning experience but venue ambiance very nice actual waitress great  <EOR> NO Way!!! place overpriced ridiculous    Was staying Vdara person wanted sushi  Wow bad decision  wanted something simple    Make boring story short   Here low down  1  over priced  pretty funny stupid prices  2  $75 sashimi plate  Yeah paid that  husband told idiot doing that  kind agree him  sushi bites tiny  fish did even taste fresh which shocked me  still starving when finished   3  Fish even impressive   4  Decor pretty much sucks well  god damn sushi joint but would never know until looked menu  Very stark modern but warm inviting all  Lame   5  Oh simple avacado roll $17   Really!!!!    Good   1  jalapeno Martini delicious but very spicy kind killed sushi tasting point  but good because hid super fresh tasting fish  Oh yeah $75 should almost still alive    the service good well    Lame  unless wasting your money  Places hate hotel restaurants even more  <EOR> Went GF dinner try Masa restaurant   Very big modern space which definitely does feel cramped   Servers very friendly helpful   Food above average but overpiced   Portions also generous   easily quickly spend over $150 two just full   Definitely splurge type dining experience <EOR> Barmasa little bit letdown boyfriend kept telling good NYC is  He's also bit sushi snob    Anyway 7 30pm reservations which figured would enough time eat light head Rio Penn Teller 9  Little did know would take 30 minutes time placed order time received first dish Kobe Garlic Soy Steak then another 30 minutes before received Sashimi Tasting plate 6 Nigiri sushi pieces  Everyone around seated ordered sushi before much faster  Service nonetheless could MUCH better  Granted place just opened 10 days ago price paying food expected better average service  unacceptable    The food other hand high quality sashimi sushi  Sure pieces small but many places selection fish outside Tsukiji fish market Japan  prices because environment you're quality food  Don't expecting same mediocre rolls see corner Japanese Sushi bar run non Japanese  other commenters below except Jen L  ridiculous expectations  high end restaurant high end hotel  If you're going try Barmasa or Shaboo matter expect significant price tag menu different kinds high quality fish and meats  kobe wagyu won't normally see    All in all hope service becomes more polished fast  food alone would warranted 4 5 stars but fact waitress didn't know she talking orders took considerably longer should keeps rating Barmasa greater 2  stick New York City  <EOR> The ambiance BarMASA spacious modern  food very good but little overpriced  probably same better sushi much cheaper  course price tag presentation very clean cut pretty  tried some sushi appetizers yakisoba  did yakisoba all  reminded Chinese cuisine's fried egg noodle soy sauce    The wait staffs nice but didn't check table often  hurry tried hard food out  But other needed attention all time    It's defiitely place sit enjoy take your time catch eat such  if you're hurry don't come here  <EOR> The food very high quality well prepared  payed attention price range expected large bill   ordered 2 rolls shrimp tempura alaskan king crab    they good  salmon sashimi great   very fresh   grilled cod delicious  Kobe beef skewers kobe beef fried excellent  Kobe beef tender tasty   eat again  Next time order Kobe beef steak I believe worth cost   <EOR> So Masa NYC reputed best sushi restaurant country    promote new Aria hotel MGM giving away $100 dining credits any Aria restaurants   hearing opened Bar Masa Las Vegas brand new Aria hotel figured we'd try out   $100 dining credit would least put bit dent huge bill anticipated   Because place very expensive    More expected  I absolutely love sushi really looking forward trying lots sushi   Unfortunately learned server right away orders nigiri piece normal 2   really took wind sails   ordering tuna salmon yellowtail toro kampachi jalapeno appetizer $100 dollar credit pretty used up   realized would super expensive if kept ordering sushi stopped   sushi selection very good though having lots things won't find most other sushi places   But stuck stuff knew first time knows when next be quality really great   However didn't think amazingly better lot great places eaten California    30 dollars 2 pieces toro alot   12 salmon etc   kampachi appetizer also salty potato bits which though took away    also ordered yellowtail scallions negi hama cut roll which great   wasabi great wife enjoyed ginger but should expected     We then ordered some hot food   kobe beef sukiyaki black cod dish   Both very good   wife thought cod dish Ame San Francisco little better but both very similar   kobe beef very tender flavorful good sauce   mushrooms excellent     I know others complained service but thought great   very attentive   food came fast server definitely helpful   He told before ordering sushi orders only piece     So overall different good experience   food very good but definitely pricey   $100 dining creidt helped alot recommend taking advantage deal MGM running   point though knowing very good suhi other places half price can't give place high rating   am glad tried though  <EOR> Only reason two stars instead great wait staff  food awful  Given value issue price don't expect 2 hour old Bangkok street food  ordered chicken skewers item  came served hot brick but skewers room temperature dull sheen since greases all gel together  When slid food bits off skewer all stuck together  Pre cooked set aside $28  5 skewers   sent them back redone hot shiny greasy should be   wasabi paste dumbed down another root vegetable very hot  asked real wasabi paste waitress said could custom grind off root would $10 extra  WTF!!!  She also asked if wanted edame when placed order but course isn't Japanese restaurant?  $5 added bill edame  Guess flown Tokyo  rolls average compared all storefront restaurants am use to  Masa milking name  AVOID ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!! <EOR> A few infos first read all reviews before therefor expectations quite low company expenses In contrast all other reviews tend give 3 stars    Asking why? service really attentive waiters recommend food drinks delivered nice starters perfect quality wise perfect main course adding water other drinks needed consulting desserts deliver quality stuff  OK bill where couple hundert dollars  But least worth half price So only if hungry honor good quality enough dollars your pockets <EOR> Excellent quality   Excellent service   Portions small very overpriced   am giving four stars small portions price paid   Extremely expensive  <EOR> I didn't think would read reviews yelp restaurant because its located Aria  If restaurant Aria would think suppose amazing place dine at   From outside looks fancy nice  walked seated  place doesn't look very elegant fancy  quote boyfriend   place looks warehouse some tables chairs  Lol  really does but some lighting hanging down   We really don't care expensive long taste good  ordered Sashimi Tasting Plate Kobe beef Uni  Surprise surprise waiter came back told ran Uni  run Uni sushi place barely any customers?
