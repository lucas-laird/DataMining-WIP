Such shame patio  <EOR> Let start saying typically DON'T Mexican food   Which why Dos Caminos fantastic!   I've read some other reviews give 1 two stars want start saying space isn't everyone   typical combo plates overly sauced quick plates don't appearance menu   Everything Dos Caminos made fresh order tell! The Guac just most amazing things could order   them spicy creamy delicious spiced just enough burn but much where ruined rest meal   mini meatballs delish tuna tartar bites   simply grilled salmon perfect!  husband fajitas   Amazing! We ate outside patio which packed sat near mini fire places which lit end meal when sun down   No rushed enjoy coffee dessert  Any kinks service others experienced attributed new opening  treated well!  absolute back bring friends! <EOR> I wasn't sure expect but pleasantly surprised! regulars Agave which occupied space previously look relatively same some nice updates reupholstered booths cool lanterns hanging inside over patio   The highlights Mexican street corn poblano cornbread  good! husband shrimp fajitas  Although more paella tortillas awesome! chicken fajitas also good not good shrimp but cooked red sauce wasn't traditional fajita  also house made guacamole pretty good well   We Sunday night wasn't busy maybe 1 4 full service excellent  Looking forward going back! <EOR> Some decent vegetarian options  queso fundido plantain empanadas veggie tacos  Micheladas good here  Nice decor service  Would return  <EOR> Came dad unaware new restaurant  seated soon figured mexican restaurant once knew! But decided stay give shot First thing odd waiter told isn't traditional Mexican old restaurant  Modern Mexican! apparently Modern Mexi looks  Undercooked chewy chips pay extra for  Bad salsa No salt pepper  no combination plates  high prices service slow staff bunch pretty faces lacking basic knowledge good service  sent back plates twice cold meals didn't even discount check apology    Maybe just opening week?? But many extra staff hand  girl actually stood front entire meal because she nothing do   Which made both very uncomfortable  [You'd think much extra staff shouldn't kinds problems being slow bad food sent out ] ? Oh Well    experience extremely unenjoyable   Just visiting area staying uncle's never come back eat here  we advised wife stay away too! <EOR> I hate say but VERY disappointed experience    Before deeper say guac very good but does save place any way    Lets start food  ordered version fajitas now saw cheese list ingredients dish meat cheese bad thing  did expect is mealy textured meat if defrosted wrong meat cooked flat iron no flavor its own puddle salty oily cheese disgusting  flavors balance worst dishes ever seen tasted  tortillas wet sticky side dry other mean screw up??????  Service started good delay getting first second rounds drinks but understand busy bar  fact server filled ice tea table away did bother fill water glass when empty good  But when she leaned across railing behind ask if wanted another drink where down hill  Three steps more she could table side  now forward telling server main course she takes away never see manager before could consider ordering desert coffee even finish second round drinks she plops check front face  asks Oh didn't want any thing else did you? WOW! never insulted felt being told 'Get hell out' life  mad could speak no manager ever bothered follow dinner   I am service industry work every thing Chevy's Micheline Star rated establishments far WORST experience ever had!!!! never return place!!!!!!!! <EOR> I work just across street good default place right work co workers  Dos Cominos replaced Agave but since only happy hour can't really compare two   They great patio area however wish would offer better happy hour specials  name few 25% off Sangria pitchers $1 off margarita's $3 Coors beer  better deals Summerlin  least give 50% off appetizers   At time top places happy hour places but sticks around option  <EOR> The place looked great but sat down downhill there!!   I ordered chicken tacos spicy could even enjoy them beans rice plain all ate taco    My fiance ordered chicken salad chicken over seasoned he only ate maybe half    Our friends ordered burgers actually said tasted great wish ordered but knew burgers Mexican restaurant would highlight!   To top off service slow took 35 minutes food arrive never return place                                          <EOR> Very disappointed     The place looked fun interesting but all let down there   The hostess cold standoffish   Flopped menus table left     The waitress friendly but odd drink options offered tap water left      The menu choices looked dismal   Lots good options drinks But  it   No burritos fajitas   Tacos odd plates only  N waited forever finally threw down few bucks tap water didn't drink walked out   Headed next door delicious meal good drinks     Will never back  <EOR> I braised short rib special melt your mouth delicous! corn very good well  happy chips but salsa okay  stand delicious margaritas! back those alone! <EOR> Used amazing franchise when Palazzo    but now am somewhat concerned   The ambiance felt much run down Tijuana joint    certainly potential but felt effort luxury Dos Camino's name used to   Food wise    Guacamole still fantastic    Mahi Mahi Tacos which also good but heard conflicting reports Tuna Seviche   My biggest concern fact although accepted Open Table reservations denied using OpenTable dollars meal   embarrassing show venue hopes using your rewards assist bill payment denied because Corporate doesn't allow use gift cards OpenTable checks     BS! Open Table just cash currency required use them    but instead admitting don't know doing denied advised must pay full price front   Needless say won't returning  <EOR> I waiting looooong time open Dos Caminos  roommate DEVASTATED when closed Palazzo     Being lover your guacamole pescado tacos toured valley mexican restaurants while closed trying look place satisfy cravings     Successful? even close  But then heard news    Dos Caminos open Summerlin?  Uhmm    Thank god!! gas bill driving Leticia's becoming little high twenty something year old budgets   My roommate made date try your new location fourth day being open public   restaurant much different your old location but think fitting   Although miss wall skeletons old location skeleton paintings now  The food lived expectations   found new love pollo asado   sauce amazing   mean    wow   craving smokey flavors days come   guacamole just remember perfect consistency spiciness seasoning   trio salsas always delight but favorite habenero   chips good remember them being tasted sitting under heat lamp far long   The only reason gave your new location four stars instead five because restaurants ambiance   staff seemed some anxiety mild headache watching them run all different directions almost bumping into each other several times    Sometimes waitress would run table asking if everything ok but REALLY listen say  <EOR> I read all reviews little nervous abt going  sure why now   Went friends  Each drink good  Tasted ordered expected margaritas mojitos and without Strip price tag   We each some version tacos  No complaints The fish tacos little spicy but sensitive palate   The chips sauces more enough three shared two person order guacamole little left over because food came before finished it   Sat outside patio  little windy turned fire place half hour sunset  As East Coast transplant always humored when 75 degrees = cold  Service totally fine waitress friendly quick meet needs more water shared dessert  Music '80s hits until abt 8 when dimmed lights put mariachi music  $30 piece tip shared dessert drink guacamole entree  Sounds average Summerlin  Really sure why many poor reviews  Agave once liked food but really don't see much difference  Feel others may splitting hairs comparing red apples green apples  <EOR> After hawking dos caminos website creep since abrupt shutdown while back finally enjoy delicious food sinfully craved  ready mission! Loose fitting clothing     Check! Somewhat starved family    Check! Husband prepared financial damage   Check! no way could fail!  Forgetting mission completed two parties!

Can't wrong guacamole! <EOR> Hey can't wrong brunch   around $12 pretty tasty meal drink included   great deal compared regular menu entrees which running around $16 $18 including drink   benedict brunch menu all honesty eggs very overcooked i e  runny all but hard cooked yolk but still enjoyed sauce potatoes came it   margarita 11 00 morning ain't half bad either  <EOR> We came try Dos Caminos hoping great Mexican restaurant close home   Started ordering Queso Fundido which good except only gave 3 small tortillas 4 us   Asked more which brought   also asked chips salsa   which already knew weren't free   and waitress felt need start quoting prices   No doubt they've lot complaints having pay chewy chips especially high menu prices   The skirt steak impressive odd spice flavor   mexican street corn very good nice surprise   chicken quesadillas good   enchiladas suiza weren't great nor smoked brisket enchiladas  chewy tough   meat hard cut even knife   salsas tasty despite being served chewy not crispy chips   The decor atmosphere trendy but noise level way loud   difficult time carrying conversation     Was disappointing dinner overall especially over $100 four people only sodas drink   Guess didn't good Mexican restaurant hoped for  <EOR> On mission try new restaurants closer home found Dos Caminos which recently opened neighborhood   chose eat inside but next time definitely relax gorgeous looking patio   guacamole made fresh order  traditional kind mango habanero   only regret ordering crab well   shared queso fundido chicken taquitos grilled shrimp quesadilla  mexican street corn side great presentation really fabulous smoky taste  loved all choices  Everything tasted really fresh vibrant  server knowledgeable cheerful efficient really enjoy experience   I'm really pleased restaurant quality opened side City rather having trek Strip   Looking forward returning try more menu sample another tempting Margaritas  <EOR> If Agave ugly sister name would Dos Caminos   I hard time rating between two three star experience  But many downers three star rating seemed fair first time experience    I'll start good news mole enchiladas kids meal sliders corn bread skillet 5 stars!    Okay now bad news Having fan old pink decor Agave wasn't fan brown dark interior   music vibe felt more nightclub restaurant really loud no Mexican music playing which tells me   not your typical Mexican food restaurant   We waited 15 20 minutes table sat near kitchen which loses its charm if you're outside kiva near bar     Waitress seemed overwhelmed she more order taker friendly waitress   No smile no Welcome DC your first time here?  Let recommend       Instead drink having guacamole? No didn't order guac   Personally many restaurants Vegas should going way welcome customers recommendations off menu   Kids menu offered mini sliders quesadillas tacos thought menu bit limited   bring bendos crayons menu color always plus me   Food took FOREVER come least 45 minutes! But least semi worth it   Definately made order meals premaid frozen slapped together mess just fresh delicious upscale presentations     I ordered Enchiladas Suizas good don't think would order them again though  very spicy served New Mexico style flat layers sauce spinach cheese but needed more sour cream     My sister ordered mole enchiladas wow!  Those winners!  dish looked amazing zigzag crema nicely sliced julienne radishes     Kids ordered sliders yummy   I know because took bite then another!  other sister ordered hamburger which she liked woman hard please   Menu bit different your typical Mexican restaurant lots hamburgers choose from   ?   Waitress did no favors explaining slant menu restaurant would able hear anyway since loud   Chips three salsa's came out   Nothing fabulous salsa just mild medium HOT taste okay but watery   The winner definitely corn bread skillet!  OMG should adding appetizers menu offering sample side because delicious! Moist warm tasty bit creamy little bit spice perfect share   hidden sides section menu  Order sure!  Overall wouldn't come running back  Maybe off night?  UPDATE did hear back restaurant always appreciate feedback! All very positive  so maybe stop Margarita give Dos Caminos more chance  <EOR> I excited hear Dos Caminos coming Summerlin  tried Palazzo few years ago loved guacamole    Walking    noticed hadn't done much renovating old Agave restaurant  still open spacious comfy booths all around huge inviting bar middle  Love outdoor space which would great cocktails appetizers    We ordered Guacamole Jumbo Lump Crab Chipotle    just good if better remembered  trio salsas good well accompanying chips crisp nice salty    Mom decided Grilled Shrimp Quesadilla which served open faced crispy tortilla  She loved    mean really loved    she doesn't usually Mexican fare  She even loved leftovers next day!   I wanted try little everything Dos Caminos Bocadito Trio  came two pieces each chicken taquitos molotes potosinas corn masa turnovers roasted pepper rajas spicy house made cheese pepita pasilla de oaxaca salsa plantain empanadas  found empanadas bland mushy chicken taquitos dry potosinas just okay  Definitely something I'd ever order again    We most certainly back close home would just guacamole salsa chips  then maybe sample those yummy sounding desserts! <EOR> I excited revisit old Agave   love outside patio  Unfortunately hot taste   seated door still pretty warm inside   did enjoy chips salsa   However sangria sample sized   order ceviche duo shrimp tuna   might two very small chopped shrimp few bits tuna   Since warm ordered chopped salad   bland   Won't back again  <EOR> A good value higher quality food   lot details correct    default fresh lime margaritas delicious sophisticated sauces very good presentations           yes few smaller teething problems   but all minor   great addition neighborhood  <EOR> We group eight Saturday night  expected service somewhat slower but THREE hours!  worst dining experiences ever  staff knowledgable management apathetic when expressed concern  Two three hours sat waiting food kitchen filled chips salsa  menu extremely limited flavorful when your entree  definitely better Mexican restaurants nearby would highly recommend overpriced sucky service! <EOR> I stopped yesterday sign door explaining closed  What!? didnt even 3 months? hope closing temporarily until air whatever show filmed Need good mexican place area Summerlin  <EOR> My husband Dos Caminos day wedding brunch  used come when Agave thoroughly enjoyed tiny bit apprehensive  glad decided give go!  I leave update restaurant because didn't BEST experience but wasn't awful    so just 3 stars now  First all seating patio much better under previous ownership  more tables outside feels more open  always loved patio but now much more comfortable feel   When server mentioned brunch receive complimentary cocktail if would all it  took advantage hubby ordered blended margarita ordered Bloody Mary  ended having send Bloody Mary back because tasted peppered tomato juice  no problem substituting though replaced mimosa which delicious    The part bothered ordered complimentary cocktail then found server drinks only complimentary if ordered very limited brunch menu section  already half way through drinks stick menu really only handful options  known would forgone drinks ordered lunch menu    We ordered breakfast quesadilla without bacon myself waited 20 minutes placed order munched trio salsa's front us  those don't spicy food STAY AWAY orange salsa  husband can't handle spice he mistakenly thought might mango salsa he wrong  incredibly spicy even loooove spicy food  both pleased meal portion siize quesadillas enough feed 2 people easily    I back mainly lovely patio but also want give lunch and or dinner menu try  <EOR> Our family ate Dos Caminos last night slightly nervous reading reviews  pleasantly surprised every turn  white Sangria fantastic chips salsa guacamole  family pretty picky when comes Mexican food thought wonderful  Service excellent  <EOR> Everything looks nice but lot aesthetics holdovers when Agave  lot other Yelpers excited place opening off strip but unfortunately failed live expectations  would give star except employees nice! Unfortunately happy hour menu unclear point sale system doesn't seem discounting anything correctly drinks aren't great food isn't any good  Everything ordered came without key ingredients like   chicken   just plain tasted bad  Probably coming back many other happy hour options area  <EOR> Everything OK but prices high correlation food quality   bloody mary guac both looked promising but left lot desired   Cinco de Mayo street festival but opted grab seats bar because only 4 tables outside no seating plus music deafening   servers bar nice prompt   Rio Grande Pancho Verde Chile Cerveza draft quite good  <EOR> I no idea Agave restaurant space before closed until good gal pal invited dine here   liked Agave cool decor ambiance including huge wooden doors patio even bathrooms all things intact change ownership   What's also same food just OK   What's different Dos Caminos small chain locations New York Atlantic City Ft  Lauderdale prices seem more expensive Agave   We had traditional guacamole crunchy veggies dipping Dos Caminos Bocaditos trio  We served complimentary chips three different kinds salsa tomatillo watery red salsa had slight kick tasty spicier orange salsa can't remember ingredients but didn't really eat it     Gal Pal guacamole veggies meal she liked just fine   trio which consisted two chicken taquitos topped some kind cabbage slaw two plaintain empanadas two molotes potosinas corn masa turnovers roasted red pepper spicy cheese salsa    trio listed menu priced $16 50 expecting six bigger pieces food  When platter served surprised small servings price   liked chicken taquitos nudged cabbage slaw off didn't taste all sour liked plaintains well   did care molotes only ate hoping would better didn't   just kind spicy tastelessness is word? When bill came trio only $8 25 must priced happy hour which good thing because dish worth $16 50   say service great sat patio enjoying late afternoon sunset   just wish food matched environment  <EOR> I sample many original appetizers guac salsa margaritas media night event patio  staff awesome made sure everyone try yummy drinks  plaintain empanadas tuna ceviche prickly pear margaritas delicious chips salsa guacamole   The decor changed while new lighting overall design bit more upscale miss old colorful look Agave  least didn't paint over hot pink exterior! patio still awesome new lighting some changes seating arrangement  Also new pillows maybe? They keeping video poker machines which told turned next week   I hope lots gaming promotions! listening Dos Caminos?? <EOR>
