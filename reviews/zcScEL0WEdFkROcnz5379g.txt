Another thing noticed take forever table cleaned previous boiling crabs soon guest leaves waiters table cleaned takes them no more 3 5 mins cleaned seat next guest  waiters took them 10 mins just started cleaning table there's no excuse say because they're busy more enough staff help half them slacking around just walking around  really disappointed when came looking forward but came home sick lol never coming back again those Los Angeles South Bay residents If you've boiling crab back home don't come unless want leave disappointed!

Over California all bags just halfway full if all way give some flavor   Lacking sauce! Lacking service!  Also why no option frozen crawfish? All other locations always it    Sometimes feel crawfish aren't cooked thoroughly since gotten sick times eating yet sure why come back  Maybe because every time come hopes having better day    What's management? <EOR> I never disappointed meal service here  coming years no matter food great well seasoned everything menu fantastic haven't run into anything don't like    What usually fried oysters shrimp mussels clams  bowl rice catch juices  Delicious!

No don't work own any stock company ***  After all rave reviews read heard friends decided give Boiling Crab try  first visit Hot Juicy literally 2 weeks ago despite typical high alcohol intake experience still fresh mind   Like Hot Juicy friend also visited Boiling Crab Friday night  place pretty big TVs all around  STRIKE 1 wasn't crowded or @ full capacity wait minimal 7 10 mins   shoulda sign cars drive street Hot Juicy but wouldn't fair leave without even walking inside right?

Why even still 3 strikes? 3 strikes you're right? Blame al al al al co alcohol!   Anyway food finally comes opinion just ok  shrimp didn't seem fresh one should fight w the fishies @ table those @ Hot Juicy seasoning nowhere near savory! friend said calamari dry crawfish also just ok  Don't remember kind crab obviously forgettable   Needless say pretty disappointed haven't decided if would even visit any other locations comparison  Granted amazing time @ Hot Juicy during initial visit would difficult any other place add comparison   My advice run wind Hot Juicy Crawfish where fantastic food fabulous service vino your meal! <EOR> WHOLE SHABANG shrimp crab clams sausage potatoes etc  etc  Cannot wrong any menu  Awesome fresh oysters fried items good too!

If you're reading there's good chance you're waiting line Boiling Crab driving there  means you're vicinity Boiling Crab making plans vicinity one  All situations much cooler mine because closest Boiling Crab over 900 miles away!   If you've never did really good job menu showing 3 steps ordering  Most seafood market price  basically  1 Choose your seafood 2 Choose your sauce 3 Choose your level spice   It then comes big clear plastic bag whatever shellfish drowning sauce your choice  peel crack shells then eat it  recommend re dipping sauce peeling cracking  WARNING! sauce HOT! immediate scalding hot but probably can't stick your finger more second   It's also good fries something because flavors intense don't want start getting accustomed it  need simmer down fries rice then shock system again sauce again!  SAUCE WHOLE SHEBANG The Whole Shebang essentially all other 3 sauces combined  Rajun Cajun Lemon Pepper Garlic Sauce all combined into 1   Seasoning great! Whatever shellfish decide drench sauce some added seasoning fill whatever small gaps might left shellfish alone  If things start getting salty eat few fries calm things down then again!  The flavors awesome! Honestly taste Rajun Cajun definitely taste Garlic but Lemon Pepper little squirt bunch  There's nothing lemony any flavor but if think hard convince yourself taste it  pepper definitely going individually picked since enough peppers creole seasoning  garlic awesome! There's no quenching lust garlic course I'd want more but there're garlic pieces floating around sauce sometimes    SPICE MEDIUM As spice love spicy foods! wanted try XXX just see bad but 2 people only couldn't tolerate spice but also long nights drinking sour stomachs  step lower Medium    Having said all Medium ain't really joking around either  sauce flavors all delicious intensely flavorful don't really complain much spice although little disappointed  Fast forward end meal reaching glass water! lips burning tongue wasn't exactly reclining La Z Boy  slowest gradual burns ever gets pretty hot  If Medium hot which 2nd hottest even more curious now bad XXX is!   SHRIMP The shrimp should considered filler  Even sauce starts little boring while but lb shrimp long way! Most cooked right but there're some little well done they're kind dry rubbery   which means MOAR SAUS!! If never anything else just started shrimp think you'd perfectly content  shrimp pretty clean but don't think really effort de vein  Since actually peeling nothing's hidden see line shrimp poop suddenly want little less  say though cleaner other similar types places to!  KING CRAB Oh wow! crab just awesome  Even itself great! Perfectly cooked seasoned well they're even pretty meaty! Then add sauce just can't enough!    and lies problem   market price quite pricey! 1 lb could $20 but 1 lb would hardly serve appetizer!  why some shrimp order leave full   BOILING GOLD I love place you're damn right back! just wish didn't cost much eat here  I'd say person could 2 lb crab  5 lb shrimp plus drinks sides something $60 80 meal! You'll satisfied but full you'd expect dropping much dough  any case pray win Vegas yeah right wait line best us! Now  if only convince them open here! <EOR> My husband craving crab   First going try Joe's Crab Shack only find couple locations closed down   then found Boiling Crab glad did   chicken tenders basket cajun fries since can't eat crab shrimp husband ordered dungeness crab garlic butter medium spice   He thoroughly enjoyed very much   $13 99 lb  he gobbled all no leg shell unturned  <EOR> Really great experience Las Vegas location! waiter very professional attentive friendly  food phenomenal!

I gave them 4 stars because first time came remember ordering calamari which 10 dollars  good but price small portion honestly person could scarf down even think twice it  recommendation would hotwings instead because actually more meat price  5 pieces 6 bucks 10 3 bucks more  two flavors lemon pepper cajun  No cant both flavors if order 10 pieces  would order separate both flavors  Why cant split dont know  server couldnt answer question   The most common question better Hot n' Juicy? answer would YES! Both similar but Boiling Crab more advantages namely 1 thru 5's above  eat both come your own conclusion but see already gave mine   So if seafood spices craving BC should satisfy! <EOR> My go to seafood place whenever coast even Vegas MUST EAT every time town!

Dry cleaning? wants come back give dry cleaning bill? waiter super apologetic well know sh!zzz happens  least comp sodas spilled your guests maybe come over table see if everything ok  manager needs lesson customer service    So star poor service manager boiling crab  <EOR> I'm giving 5 stars because thing people knock stars off wait table I cannot damn place being popular busy   This said love Boiling Crab greasy messy man o man good! It seafood lovers selection hot crab lobster clams shrimp more But warned whenever shrimp overcooked For newbies recommend your fish butter it's actually real butter and side whole shabang mild use dipping sauce  make sure grab plenty napkins gonna messy!  Also extra limes need them! <EOR> The service definitely hit miss restaurant  could take very long time small thing prepared if those waiters    Also careful your credit card  card used fraudulent activity going first time when back explained reason check IDs now because someone stealing credit card numbers    With aside love food love flavor  usually chicken tenders medium barbecue sauce which always delicious fresh dozen oysters 2 pounds crawfish 2 pounds shrimp whole Shebang sauce Mild flavor which still very very spicy sometimes  also order corn butter delicious    The atmosphere alright  Very busy every time usually least 30 60 min wait no matter but always Friday night expected  Prepare eat bags table paper  flavor addicting frequent customer no matter bad service long stays delectable! <EOR> We ate Boiling Crab last night  3 lb lobster 2 lbs shrimp  cooked them bag potatoes corn  No silverware ate Louisiana style!

After having somewhat disappointed competitors Boiling Crab really stood me  restaurant itself very open plenty seating while obviously smell seafood wasn't punch you in the face smell might expect  similar restaurants each table pretty basic disposable cover next nothing else  thought really cool let write walls too!  With places come generally two things only   crawfish shrimp  glad see Boiling Crab clearly differentiates between frozen live crawfish  There's huge difference those complaining work reward ratio just ain't doing right! P   I ended ordering 1lb each loved every bite it  crawfish perfectly cooked body cracking head sucking heaven  Even shrimp cooked close perfect get  couple seasoning choices if can't decide want they'll throw all together call Whole Shaw bang   opted crawfish although didn't taste much lemon pepper delicious  shrimp ordered Cajun seasoning which spectacular! Both super flavorful medium spice perfect heat level   If you're into shrimp crawfish several other options oysters lobster  little man some crab legs which happily made plain he devoured them  those don't eat seafood only thing offer chicken wings but wifey ordered those said pretty decent   When comes service no complaints  waitress great made sure taken care start finish  prices good too! while always wanting check new joints crawfish definitely back Boiling Crab when want amazing messy meal! <EOR> I love here  food delicious staff nice  don't eat seafood blasphemy! BUT chicken basket lemon pepper fries corn whatever flavor spice feeling day yummy! throw chicken pieces seasoning bag shake best  spouse loves shrimp crawfish  If thinking trying do  worth it  Prices aren't bad either  order seafood pound choose your seasoning spicy want it  usually very busy take reservations if you're super hungry need certain time suggest calling asking wait time  return again again! <EOR> Once step into establishment welcomed host hostess friendly personality your day  When your party settled your server's charm forget long waiting list in  server excellent job  Whenever would ask questions menu he would answer no hesitation  He those servers would disappear once order  He always checked ask if satisfied food  always food delicious    My favorite seafood crab high expectations place  whole shebang king crab legs side white rice  If describe meal word would heavenly  Remember some fancy restaurant  eat your food use your bare hands  just reminder down dirty      The atmosphere place amazing  only welcoming employees but room feel boardwalk California  Each everyone works always seem look having fun  bubbly personalities your server try best your experience outstanding   Overall restaurant incredible  your guests enjoyable time  recommend everyone especially all seafood lovers there! <EOR> Food good except fried oysters  If your ok 9 tiny little oysters size dime then ok  matters worse charged $10 instead $9 listed menu oysters  Service definitely worth price  completely screwed order  Took pulling teeth refill beverages  Place very chaotic unorganized! <EOR> I wish Arizona!

There much cayenne chili pepper dry XXX heat couldn't taste any food   All coating dry power overwhelm your taste buds     I would point probably important but feel its something worth noting    only give corn when purchase least 2lb  bag crawfish  Which fine    but where potato!?!? Yes know isnt Hot n' Juicy    but where it!?!?!  SERVICE Where should start    server didnt introduce himself only assuming name Spencer since check which may correct since half way through another waiter assisted us    He wasnt really friendly ask pricing everything   sorry if inquiring pricing wouldn't assume would inform should nice let know instead having pull teeth????  Our waiter talked fiance ordering XXX first time around which  fine took friendly advice   However when Med heat orders wanted something spicier asked if small side dry XXX seasoning more kick   told he cant but if wanted order something else such side order corn corn big soaked liquid XXX sauce    great if want season food liking you're going buy more    right    annoys most since he convincing order XXX first place     Anyway moving on    ordered Gumbo Rice didnt gumbo rice   whole reason going Boiling Crab cause craving rice lots sauce!  could satisfy craving saucey rice?? Gumbo! but nope didnt even hit stop   stop another waiter tell didnt correct order   Instead just bringing cup rice she takes whole cup back kitchen comes back it   when cup back looked someone took 1 spoonful rice dumped in   didnt realize rice such expensive item cant even more 1 spoonful     So all interaction waiter comes ask doing   fiance being nice guy he says everything great where said things werent good   pretty sure waiter thought being sarcastic since comment came fiance assume though oh its awful but still stuffing face  its obviously amazing food     nope didnt say mean that   He just walks off nothing happened     So writing review few hours visit Boiling Crab    group only three fresh crawfish    now all three arent feel well     That sums extremely delight experience never stop back place any other locations   EVER  <EOR> This go to restaurant type food because delivers everything    Location located Food 4 Less shopping center  Lots lots parking plus     Service awesome!

Lastly choose spicy want normally mild which just gives nice kick which overwhelmingly spicy  perfection! served bag sauce also request add other items bag such potatoes corn  add some additional flavor request lime salt pepper butter dip your nicely seasoned shrimp  Whichever dipping sauce prefer compliments flavor well adds little bit heaven your taste buds   In addition food always being delicious service also top notch me  They're always fully staffed everyone very friendly  always recognize coming out  servers consistently checking your table making sure they're tending  your needs    I've never bad experience whenever come here  However due being only location town sure check peak hours could wait long 45 minutes if come during peak times  When check won't seat until your whole party keep mind  But overall always pleasant experience which why always come back  <EOR> Loved clams shrimp! Those best items I'd say  served big chubby clams tiny ones  Loved give bunch sliced limes add some lime juice bags don't add much though because sour  But overall sauces really good super flavorful    I also tried King Crab this  just really bad  Crab legs weigh quite lot only 3 legs pound paid for  Worst part legs skinny no meat! shells soft can't even use crab cracker crack legs open  total waste money  actually funny crab worst item considering name restaurant  sure hope just off kind thing   Adding corn your bag quite rip off since just half corn charge $1 50 but its REALLY good! Mainly because its drenched all sauce flavor really sinks into corn   I didn't didn't provide disposable gloves though  <EOR> I LOVE BC  never come disappointed  Sometimes wait long but expect amazing restaurant this? always order pound shrimp whole shabang non spicy boyfriend recently discovered delicious cajun chowder is! place always consistent point everything food service! <EOR> So good! finally made drive always going hot juicy  service great fast! <EOR> Boiling Crab always good but Vegas stingy sauce  All bags BARELY any sauce most seafood wasn't even coated it  Extra sauce costs $2 50  Usually other locations California would take home leftover sauce use cook own seafood  case time  Also ordered whole shabang but definitely more lemon taste garlic should  Because all take off star    However largest location even though busy usual wait wasn't long seated food came fast  should probably slow down bit add more sauce bags     But I'd still come back give them another try  <EOR> We've many crawfish places Las Vegas  say Boiling Crab favorite  Service always fast friendly  flavors best  Right amount seasonings everything always fresh delicious    The location fairly big ample parking  Even when busy never waited longer 20 mins table  worth wait! <EOR> Anytime need seafood fix come Boiling Crab! whole shabang never leaves tummy unhappy  Service little challenging especially since big parties but other worth visit  usually shrimp whole shabang corn lemon pepper fries  delicious worth extra calories  <EOR> How Boiling CRAB crab?

I dont' recommend ordering crab despite fact called Boiling Crab because often times crab smells because they're frozen but because die cooks don't even notice    Also don't order crawfish unless you've never before  most people would say crawfish meat probably size your pinky worth entire bang your buck   Order pound clams instead  = still reminiscing meaty were!  A couple things particular location large open restaurant but don't use floor space very well  time 7pm primetime dinner many people standing line yet restaurant itself still floor space put more tables chairs but staff doesn't  There's also lot bench seats but they're uncomfortable = While long benches deceivingly look could seat lot people those could probably only seat 4 people max especially since you're going battling elbow space chicken pose prevent juices splattering onto your sleeves clothes!! <EOR> Very long wait   wasn't impressed crab crawfish   sauce very flat dimensional tasting   very very oily   Similar taking piece shrimp adding cheap oily hot sauce it   seafood itself good quality but you're eating pretty much boiled seafood sauce important   really didn't see appeal   surprised packed crowded   waited hour   love seafood but just impressed   New Orleans twice New York 3 times   There's no competition   Maybe expecting much    don't give gloves handy wipes either   Customer service very nice   probably just me     I recommend Boil NYC Chinatown instead   sauce amazing want drink lick every last bit   mind blowing   Very similar concept Boiling Crab but different level regards taste quality  Also give gloves handy wipes  <EOR> My family love place amazing seafood calamari die for  mussels Sha bang sauce awesome shrimp amazing  variety sauces choose your own spice level  <EOR> We around 9 pm put name two waited 5 minutes seated  choice booth table chose booth  wasn't packed but definitely good amount people    First thing noticed when walked all TVs  TVs everywhere  would perfect if came when game on   We nice server name David  decided 1 lb shrimp mild whole shabang boyfriend each catfish basket which came Cajun fries   When brought food noticed no plates shrimps no utensils  asked guys he said don't plates only plastic forks knives  wanted fork eat catfish  used eating hands   catfish good perfectly prepared fries yummy   The shrimps came unpeeled very hard time peeling them  wonderful boyfriend ended peeling them but between both probably only ate half shrimps  ended taking rest home   I definitely return when family town  There's location Massachusetts think parents would really enjoy place  <EOR> BEST CREOLE TOWN! love restaurant always look forward visiting while Vegas  service always perfect 10  Food outstanding   only compliant wait time  Order Cajun fries shrimp all works!

Lines long but worth it   Although see families rotate single table basically hold table over 2 hours  <EOR> I give place 3 5 stars  Mostly because seating technique really annoys me  understand when busy why want whole party but when first open no still wait  Then finally when sit down takes 10 minutes someone just ask drinks want    Basically service always slow always  But food good   My suggestion order extra pound then actually want order before your done current bag your still hungry  <EOR> The food amazing  But service sucked  waitress couldn't remember anything  husband asked hot sauce never even asked 3 different waiters  remind them also ordered fried oysters brought over 20 mins later  <EOR> Went first time celebrate anniversary feasting some crab  amazing  3 pounds snow crab original Cajun seasoning non spicy  bring bag full all juices spices  no need dip butter think already butter bag seasoning  can't wait back soon bank account allows lol  Cajun fries crispy delicious corn great also <EOR> I 6 times but first time written review   experience first 5 times good   flavor sauce good experiences   fact recommendation friends birthday party here   Everyone good time ended bill over $400 but worth it       Why 2 stars ask?

Staff friendly quick never wait thing  Definitely must if love seafood  <EOR> Same Boiling Crab know love LA except bigger space no waiting   Ordered snow crab whole shebang medium fried oysters gumbo  Just flavorful satisfying original  <EOR> Itokay  think prices bit inflated opposed Hot Juicy but can't say bad place eat  Services fast nice accurate  place clean  location great parking easy  <EOR> So past few times service gotten worse each time  skimp sauce  bag want charge $2 50 if want extra! We ordered child's chicken tender basket specifically told server bring first  fact ordered child's food before even decided adults wanted order  Well crab legs table before child's meal was  ordered soup bright before ANY other food delivered table! Does even sense?! Needless say Boiling Crab big disappointment past few times here  daughter excited try she visiting NC     pretty much ruined experience her  Can't say back anytime soon   take appetite business Hot N Juicy now on  <EOR> Went lunch based friend recommendation  Easy seated informed no blue crab dungeness crab  love dungeness greatly disappointed me   I ordered snow crab side corn cob friend ordered hot wings crawfish  Somehow hot wings forgotten delivered late dry good  Rest food good if nothing special  Service very good   I places perhaps parent place California few years ago pretty good meal  being similar those standards  <EOR> Always always delicious! usually medium whole shabang shrimp corn sauce  Yum! Try fries if want something keep your mouth cool <EOR> Hands down favorite place eat cajun shrimp   I know competitors such Hot n' Juicy Cravin' Cajun but place takes me  Its very spacious lot seating includes tables booths  tvs everywhere which good especially during sports season    The food amazing! Well shrimp anyway  only King crab once but boyfriend soon realized crab other places stuck getting shrimp out  always whole sha bang mild mine   find medium little spicy liking  also cajun fries  meal just isn't complete without fries  Don't forget salt pepper lime! takes shrimp whole other level   I love place continue coming back time time again  <EOR> Service always great every time come seated quickly which use always use waiting 40+ mins California     Dock two stars because    They always give such little seasoning pound shrimp never enough  Seasoning never settles into shrimp does Cal  use getting much flavor within shrimp lots seasoning  Spice level always consistent  fan spicy food few weeks ago when ordered XXX mouth fire week ordered XXX felt eating medium level    Their seasoning always consistent either  Always whole shabang seasoning normally bland just right   Cajun fries die for!   Also order rice don't let seasoning waste you've finished shrimp  Ha  Despite all always come back when want some delicious seafood  <EOR> Been many times food awesome!  service horrible  Asked certain time 4 different servers finally when done meal  Food dropped no server check back ask someone else refills   5 stars food 1 star service   Shouldn't any surprise always pack reviews mean nothing <EOR> Love joint!  The line wasn't bad  20 mins party 4  waiting area pretty decent people waiting outside called    As soon seated ordered food   and quite impressed fast food came shortly ordered   The spice level spectacular said Wife   She's spicy eater last place gone did met expectation  She pleased XXX Spice Level    The staff members friendly normally only certain waiter waitress served area but however everybody help another    So getting helped quick    The food price little more others then again crawfish couple big ones  Which plus!

I've already written full review take boiling crab   Take quick look if you'd like   Everything's just good Cali locations   Reason why giving place five stars cause service still sketch   place just opened couple weeks ago I'd imagine improve over time but mean time need step up   Although really friendly inviting seems many people just standing around   servers nice enough but keep asking shit should dropped even before food comes   ie  salt pepper limes spoons rice bib   When Cali take your order come back right away dropping all stuff needed BC consumption    No questions asked    25 cents filtered water whatever  50 cents condiments ranch tarter sauce etc    No liquor license yet but  expected cause takes while obtain   Overall still great place happy opened up   cravings nice finally fulfill   Cheeeeers! <EOR> Ehhh  staff sucks happy cool hot juicy  much look either  environment fun h j either  said would difference between corporate America independent biz  Once hot juicy corporate same shit  Ok now 3 stars  calamari 100% better then Hot juicy  clams awesome  gumbo good  u think sauce better  However shrimp all different sizes smaller side  em big juicy over all needs much improvement  Oh no bread  actually told waiters people bring own       over food less bought French bread  great  <EOR> On five hour drive home all could talk Mr  W 's ear off young fresh [just men?] those crawfish were!  far most favorite place crawfish hands down   Mr  W  originally wanted try Boiling Crab   all heard big California being Arizona HnJ AC BC temptress   friend said oily AC really put off notion   Ignoring warning BC turned second favorite meal Vegas trip!

Mmmmm food service great really boiling crab!  I am pleased announce boiling crab bumped 5 stars last review rating 4 stars  <EOR> Very disappointed service meal    The sweet potatoe fries  came first meal   10mins later crab legs came 8 mins later husband's meal came out   come bag shrimp potatoes mushrooms corn   1 potato 2 mushrooms 1 half size corn cob  25 mins later decided bring butter crab legs  crab legs old could tell frozen close being fresh   The manager told waitress should told portions   mentioned even menu reads plural veggies singular response Noone ever pointed before     They took 50% off bill won't going back <EOR> Looking fun experience?  Look no further!  However if super prissy going set aside meal!  No plates no silverware dig messy!  Wet naps enough meal! snow crab legs king crab legs shrimp whole shabang sauce medium spicy along sweet potato fries dipped shabang sauce  Service great!  Beer sodas only no liquor wine   Noticed lots large parties 10+   Loved it! <EOR> Way better Hot Juicy   price   location    parking    taste   The atmosphere very comfortable    Servers checking regularly    The Whole Sha Bang sauce delicious! shrimp crawfish   well three bags 'em   cajun fries world   am regular fries eater but scrumptious   Everything mild   that ordered   Folks mild   Love corn cob too     Overall great meal  o Very happy tummy    <EOR> This place BOMB  find myself craving boiling crab allllll time! just wish another location because weekends place gets seriously packed  usually always same thing every time shrimp whole shabang sauce mild catfish basket w Cajun fries corn whole shabang sauce no Cajun   BAM flavor explosion mouth! If super hungry mussels sausage good option well   The only thing say sometimes shrimp inconsistent  Sometimes small sometimes big sometimes over cooked hard peel but big deal    Service pretty good  server Thomas only he very attentive knowledgeable menu but he also very handsome man! <EOR> The food pretty good enjoyed but don't think beats Houston crawfish based restaurants  think Houston crawfish restaurants more kick spices more well integrated flavor which crave more  Plus price pretty expensive but guess because Las Vegas restaurant they tend more expensive?   But enough comparison Houston lets focus restaurant!  Like keep mentioning does good flavors service pretty attentive despite dining during rush hour overall good experience  If crawfish definitely try place out  believe chain restaurant if near its definitely worth giving try! probably am little more picky cause Houston spoiled but friends enjoyed very much they're locals here  <EOR> We wanted explore something different   found perfect gem middle Las Vegas frequent visitors   loved getting away Las Vegas strip just getting down dirty local style      It fun just roll your sleeves stuff your face everything menu   love served your meal clear baggies no dishes utensils clothe napkins   full chow down town no inhibitions night place    While you're Las Vegas definitely visit restaurant  heard wait extremely long but lucked short 30 min wait   Thumbs up! <EOR> I happy experience boiling crab location!! initially ordered takeout order when home shrimp over cooked  called spoke manager he told come back couple days would remake order house  when called back order spoke manager Jay he AWESOME!!
