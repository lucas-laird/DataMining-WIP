NO! WTF! possibly wrong when pointing A8 repeating 100 times! lady contested didn't believe until she brought menu back showed A8 was   At least pho made correctly but broth bland tasteless  added bunch hoisin sauce which helped little but broth definitely needed lot help  meat noodles fine  Just wished bowl contained little less steak more tripe tendon   because bowl ordered supposed all 3 but all saw 1 piece tripe tendon ton steak   When nem nuong cuon finally came ok  Definitely best although still tasted good  use cucumbers crunch instead egg roll shell crumbles Nem Nuong Bistro Brodard  instead especially because same price 2 $4 95 <EOR> The Pho hot delicious   Loved loved loved it!  Also tried BBQ pork sandwich   Although husband liked pho his first time second he really taken sandwich   service tremendous   servers friendly walk around place smiling   going again! <EOR> Amazing!

Next came main dishes grilled pork chicken bun bowls  dish really love but needs done right  disappointed last few times dish places Chinatown due soggy overcooked noodles burnt overly charred meat not so fresh veg   Viet Bistro does Bun proper  noodles perfect al dente amazing texture bean sprouts other veg crisp fresh grilled pork caramelized perfection just right amount fresh herbs    If nit pick con would say fish sauce could bit stronger  good but tastes little watered down compared normally it   Overall place easy 5 stars food friendly owner host   Side note Upon entering place immediately smelled very strong cigar pipe tobacco smoke  asked owner why smelled he explained cigar shop next door  He seated back where smell bad  also outdoor seating which would recommend if sensitive smell smoke   It's unfortunate cigar shop next door polluting surrounding restaurants shops  There's cupcake shop other side cigar shop same issues smoke smell  guys cigar shop should using better ventilation something  <EOR> I looking pho found hole wall place serves ox tail pho  Broth amazing   Grilled pork sandwich excellent well   Iced coffee best town   Friendly atmosphere  <EOR> I good dinner wife  2nd time eaten here  Although time Fresh Spring Rolls weren't quite fresh I'd like  wrappings bit chewy filling all lettuce few shrimp  But dinner good made it  combo bowl little bit everything over rice noodles  Service good everything clean  Although rolls Arny best meal overall quite good since its convenient continue eat when feel quick good meal  <EOR> This place right next cigar shop  while waiting order all could smell cigar smoke next door  Food okay  only Pho combination spring roll much say  Service pretty slow compare other pho place mention pretty dismissal both host waitress because way busy anything  She manage come table next ask doing refil water twice  other hand ask if Pepsi refil  should use now because most time asian place treat other asian  face light beam when white folks walk in  hate pull card sad but true  <EOR> This actually pretty good place eat pho! Only knocking down 1 star because when walk you're met pungent smoke smell  Which dampening when dining in  forgive them anyway because located next smoke shop  can't wait try other items menu wish open longer instead closing 9 lol <EOR> I way northwest today decided try Pho place area   based YELP tried Viet Bistro walked away very happy   1   If haven't read T  Paolo D review place yet so   used analysis visit happy!  2   Parking strip mall very easy   Odd near cigar bar which very distinct cigar aroma however once inside restaurant cannot smell cigars   3   Ambiance Small narrow place purple walls  Nice overall   Small cozy  Nothing fancy   4   Drinks always prefer fountain drinks over canned sodas definitely plus   5   Food Ahhh tried Bun Bo Hue based MyT Paolo D review great  spicy all fact very subtle   great overpowering always add more spices jalepenos   noodles just right terms texture firmness   serving size just right first time drank much broth  very very tasty   son P11 he enjoyed well Iced Coffee   I also ordered sandwiches take home taste great better yet aroma even better   There ton stuff menu  come back again although 35 minutes where live Henderson!!!  6   Service good gets   GK says check out  <EOR> Eh    first time came everything good  oxtail pho amazing  prices bit more expensive other pho places but considering location expected  Came again shaking beef w red rice bun bo hue  beef flavorful but rice pretty bland  seemed some sort tomato rice  bun bo hue really spicy rather lukewarm  Very disappointing!

Second reasons why gave them low rating because second walk whole place smells absolute ashtray  sure if cooks smoke back its smoke shop next but need fix problem asap! could eat rest meal take food home  Kinda sad because staff also very nice <EOR> The location perfect close office if craving some pho easily fix   same strip mall Panera Cupcakery Market Grille Cafe   The pho good lots meat it   broth flavorful used but price convenience satisfied   Thai Iced tea also good   many other items menu try those well   Service good food came quick   great those grabbing quick lunch area  <EOR> My first time today  name place Viet Bistro word cuisine sign  under impression would little pricier bit fancier ones Chinatown    wrong fancier part  need lose overused utensils  looked 10 years old  pho ok but broth hot enough cook bean sprouts  Overall experience 1 5  Food 2 5 back sure <EOR> I happened area decided stop try thai iced tea bbq pork sandwich   tea okay although bit weak side   didn't care sandwich   way much cilantro also quite dry  Little no taste bbq don't order expecting bbq sandwich might used because ain't it    wouldn't order sandwich again   Total very large Thai ice tea sandwich $10 50   pricey or don't     Maybe other things better?  positive side smoky air lot people complain coming cigar store next door really didn't seem much issue   There's slight hint smoke air but much all air purifier machine thing front shop cash register probably helping  <EOR> Ordered Take service good  better Pho  Salty  Maybe try again  <EOR> Food good  Service good  Disappointed  Perhaps food items ordered   maybe should tried other items  <EOR> This solid Vietnamese food Summerlin! close house when craving pork vermicelli pho don't want head all way Chinatown great alternative  also think portions decently large price  also enjoyed bun bo hue I am Vietnamese can't speak authenticity decently spiced spicy good chewy noodles just wasn't red before  missing some things menu usually see other Vietnamese places but quite few selections which nice  If dine serve soup banh mi too  inside used smell smoke shop which really annoying but improved bunch  <EOR> Take look food  taste amazing ca grew Westminster  bad Vietnamese well but here <EOR> I very skeptical place when family first entered  First all outskirts Las Vegas strip decor kind Westernized  But surprise food actually very good  bun vermicelli dish rest family pho  pho delicious! O lot places gone cheap broth just taste water but place  so good  sad didn't pho first place! bit expensive side dishes but pay get   Would definitely come back place  <EOR> Oxtail soup want try   Great cooks great ingredients equal some great Vietnamese food  <EOR> My family coming since day 1  original lady forgot name always very pleasant she still works but now there's new lady very unprofessional  Basically walked 8 17 P M  greeted Hi go? said No here  she told if eat done 9oclock  Cause go  don't live close place  drove no reason  worked Food Beverage over decade  used hate when people would come late  But never would say she said me  very unprofessional she should nothing company  She's bad business  occurred 12 23 17    P s  place needs music    P s s  Pho great  <EOR> Had Pho today awesome   Never disappointment  Only reason why give 4 stars because smell its having past two times ive here  wet mop smell  appetite shifty but food oh good  <EOR> Since moved North Las Vegas food options rated based location taste   closet real Vietnamese restaurant could find   and exceeded expectations   feeling adventurous decided try something different   I always see parents order bun bo hue when am Seattle but always afraid because congealed pork blood normally accompanies dish   ABC   so certain things still scare even though asian  ha    noticed bun bo hue menu BUT without congealed pork blood pork hock optional   lemongrass beef broth warm spicy savory goodness   beef beef tendon pork hock wide rice noodles perfect rainy day weather meal   broth wasn't quite spicy would but owner came dropped off extra spicy sauce   think tame flavors down due clientele optional pork hock scare people   fiance tried chicken vermicelli bowl   noodles cooked well chicken moist flavorful   Viet spot if lazy drive Chinatown! <EOR> I ordered Pho Togo cost $8 75 + Tax =$9 46 ? expensive pay Food no value  give meat less compare order Vietnam restaurant pay  before   It worth buy food   Won't come again! Here Pho picture which guy see give u ! <EOR> Thought place all right place some Vietnamese fix  Thought prices slightly higher considering however beats having drive ways way  more good 3 5 stars  personally don't prefer place would rather drive   but husband doesn't mind pho  He thinks isn't bad  more banh mi person which why don't prefer place because price ratio  We'd normally come if husband feeling pho ish wait kids faith formation class road    The owners however really nice welcoming experiences  used business back home in Hawaii all supporting traces 808  place pretty clean  just couldn't stand smell cigars while eating  smoke cigar   but just don't prefer smell when having dinner younger kids   Anyway I'd recommend them think they're sure bets around way  gosh knows dont much pho options around way  But if having serious pho crave doesnt want ruined   I'd say just trip chinatown  place isnt anything shoot across town for  More decent spot your vietnamese fix if your proximity without traveling far out  could squeeze stroller but think should keep trunk if possible    Enjoy! <EOR> Viet Bistro never disappoints! 10 times food very reasonably priced great portions delicious! other pho but place favorite  pho expert only few places but theirs best had  Never bad experience! <EOR> Service seriously lacking! Egg rolls overdone lettuce wilty  Pho average  very skimpy giving more basil mint when flag server down ask some  Prices reasonable  <EOR> This third time introduced place some Vietnamese buddies if mine   Enjoyed pho but still think Pho 87 edges then nevertheless above average   even white boy co worker hooked pho here   He recovering throat surgery needed something easy going   He always begs pho each time see him   #awesomeness     Moreover sets place apart other pho joints offers lot more variety menu mention more quality vs  speed eatery   appear put lot more love into dishes compared fast food eat home pho spots   However kinda disappointing learn bun bo hue does include pigs blood   most plus but type dude appreciates goods many tend shy away from   waiter explained health code violation serve it   Interesting know   Especially since tons violators if true   Nevertheless bun bo hue very tasty almost forgot no cubed pigs blood   didn't come veggies however but guess since rush didn't stress much   also added combo banh mi but never savor since gave hungry monster kept nagging me   she knows she is   Caution waitresses speaks very little english turn off but she very nice  <EOR> I don't find menu easy skim but husband really food can't deny amazing customer service  accommodate any all preferences allergies offering own suggestions substitutes no additional cost  <EOR> I satay pho  Ate also them plenty times but no more  Aside smell tobacco next door service slow poor customer services   ask spoons refills water  regular pho water down bland no favor whatsoever   rice dish dry favorful  bun bo hue nothing real bun bo i guess something better nothing   only come pho satay cause different unique  called place forgot basil leaves satay i always order pho satay u eat without satay side    started check orders next time when placed go  Happened again asked lady she back cameo handed half oz satay three large pho satay  then asked more satay she gave oz container satay   came home w half cooked rice noodle banh pho   Ppl food home cause don't want cook boil pot hot water dip all rice noodles again   want say place still but quality customer services now rather eat Thai food drive myself pho Saigon 8 better pho services aren't sloppy  being unreasonable happens many times   used worked pho place see unacceptable  <EOR> Stopped again since 01 2015 place still smelled smoke  Yikes!!! customer service bad  wanted something quick light  asked dessert menu Vietnamese clerk wasn't very pleasant knowing wasn't going spend lot money there  dessert wanted 3 Color dessert which she said she didn't it  Oh well! won't step foot again  <EOR> They no competition area maybe  why cut corners  more authentic Vietnamese haul Chinatown  Disappointing pho broken rice dishes  would compare place average Chinese restaurant  good  <EOR> This favorite pho place   Ever  There's something broth good taste water unlike other pho places Chinatown  serving pretty much same but prices probably $1 more other places around town BUT worth since much better tasting much better quality food ones Chinatown    I've never actually sat dined because always ordered takeout instead but owner employees super generous feel welcome right when come into store  basically welcome smile! Again unlike other pho places to  restaurant they're sure you're happy customer    Big plus don't drive aaaaalllllllll way Chinatown just eat some alright tasting pho but instead take five minute drive Viet Bistro!
