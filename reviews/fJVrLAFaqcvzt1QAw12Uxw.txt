Stalls included Beard Papa boba dessert place Fuku burger noodle stall some dim sum Chinese BBQ stall  dropped around noon Saturday check place dead  Walked Fuku burger peaked interest  eventually did come back around 1 50 am ate Fuku Burger really liked meal #5 jazz fries good drunk food reasonable prices   downside Fuku closes 2 a m  really should open until least 3 4 a m  club crowd sober at    Overall need totally rethink execution place bring some high profile brands LA's SGV let them set shop here  Boba Half Half desserts Bambu still overpriced  b c right now only option kind stuff Strip  point I'd recommend driving over Chinatown if want your asian grub on  Only if desperate boba if want some good fusion y burgers  <EOR> The concept great Karma Pizza good nothing exceptional  Boba tea something would recommend tried lychee lychee jelly watery then tried milk tea ran boba offered rainbow jelly accepted  Such horrible suggestion rainbow jelly tangy acid milk tea sweet creamy  huge very expensive <EOR> We only came try fukuburger    egg onion straws furikake flakes teriyaki sauce special white sauce   Tasted yummy ok price $7 99   All burgers same price ranging basic burger more speciality ones   wasn't very crowded maybe because rain?  ate around 5 pm   rest food places didn't seem great  <EOR> They C health department  wife son ate anyway shits!  FUKU burger where ate  now pronounce Fuck burger which very unfortunate given much wanted love it  giving them second chance good reason  meat ground served very rare  Food needs handled very carefully cleanest environment  bad boys could something there  <EOR> Great location interior  Food noting write home service poor  They tout Chinatown experience but 2x china town price   Don't if want Vegas food service experience because disappoint leave your pocket book empty not  <EOR> F A M E  stands Food Art Music Entertainment  However am missing something here? All saw food  somewhat awkward intrigued vendor looking booths background but can't actually order directly there  essentially sit down restaurant where gaze food choices  Looking menu prices astronomical  addition when received tonkotsu noodle soup came tiny plastic bowl  dawned point am being totally ripped off  Although noodle soup decent small plastic bowl really turned off   amount money spending afford real bowls utensils  Someone missed the boat developing concept  <EOR> Just tasting team  The owner Taiwan David Wu really cool gentleman more artist businessman  Their price reasonable if take consideration its location center Strip  The decor LOFT style Fuku burger food truck inside restaurant  Their Singapore noodles lobsters beef tofu soup pan seared dumplings really good  The variety amazing  dim sum Chinese food Taiwanes snacks ramen HK BBQ  It's economical place hang strip if craving some Taiwanese HK Chinese Japanese Korean food  <EOR> We decided try place because seemed cool concept but ended being huge disappointment  ridiculously over priced even being strip  probably should ordered burgers since  everyone else seemed ordering  Instead made mistake ordering off other menu  actually wouldn't mind paying $20 plate but if you're going charge much would expect taste good which didn't served normal dish ware instead styrofoam plates bowls  <EOR> I excited try place because fuku burger  always fan food truck but found taxing try figure where truck parked time if any food left  basically FAME food court linq  collection different vendors beard papa cream puffs Boba drinks pizza buddha fuku burger Asian place just Chinese character name see pic no clue why call food court FAME because think eateries Famous own right??? NOT! gave 2 stars coz couple times place wasn't packed plenty seats available  Also utensils condiments u could use each table  fountain drinks also self serve  If would've given 1 star   Ok 1  BEARD PAPA supposedly famous cream puffs tried chocolate vanilla cream good but no wow factor especially almost $4 piece  wasn't sweet which good  tried drinks well milk tea good mango slush good drinks huge only size comes avg 10$ drink  ya going pretty expensive snack!  2  FUKU BURGER all time faves always tamago burger spicy burger Naga dog togarashi fries  Please note cook burgers medium If u don't seeing pink your burgers u specify want meat cooked  am sad say though although food still good quality food day below par  asked spicy burger medium well came well done also fries bit overcooked side  top food coming 20 mins  Later shorted order Katsu burger which he forgotten dispute since hungry already kids driving nuts  $10 nothing  yes    burgers hot dogs avg around $10 per item no fries drink included fountain drinks available $10 drink coz called souvenir cup   better ur soda elsewhere  bottom line    impressed anymore craving system   3  No name chinese thai Japanese identity crisis ish place Chinese character name  think did purpose harder bad mouth criticize them  first time tried fried rice which only delicious item tried but wasn't even amazing standards definitely $12 amazing coz  much plate good 1 1 2 ppl maybe  Shrimp dumplings wrapper thick 2 tiny pcs  shrimp which falling apart when u bit into it  when u eat u eat big bite u mouth full wonton wrapper  Gyozas wrapper also very thick ground pork filling falling apart well  UDON SOUP soup base dark brown color did taste good all    least noodles edible  Ramen soup tasted fishy salty  BBQ pork platter worst took them almost 1 hour serve when tried BBQ pork SPIT OUT! just nasty! very weird taste could myself swallow fear might regurgitate  dishes range $10 $15 per serving  service also very slow bring ur dishes different intervals  place definitely needs train cooks better   So overall impression FAME    love ambience but way over priced feels all consumers money without delivering good quality service  Walmart pretending Nordstrom charging Nordstrom prices  Very slow service if hurry good luck you! Very disorganized also no sink wash your hands even hand sanitizer stations  expect tip them too? Tsk tsk tsk    am better off spending money elsewhere where least money's worth  <EOR>
