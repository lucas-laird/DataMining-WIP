Just away!    don't know deal but Pin Kaow kind place should cause traumatic dining experience this! <EOR> I totally LOVE Thai restaurant    Tom ka kai sp? Both coconut milk based reddish lemongrass based soup over rice staple when dining ordering go  restaurant though better serve hot pot over hot flame candle some reason think simple presentation alone soup much better lol  pretty sure safe say if thai food then you'll love pin kaow  service always fantastic always smiling beautiful face greet you  <EOR> Went wife dinner Friday evening   First all seated right away which hard come town   decor amazing traditional Thai   Even down dress staff!   And food     Let tell tried many Thai places time say absolutely best ever had!   We Pinang curry chicken yellow curry chicken papaya salad crab rangoon   wife regular Friday night outing sure! I would highly recommend anyone  <EOR> Used really good Thai restaurant but its expansion several months ago quality declined dramatically  ordered takeout them week wait 40 minutes time said food would ready  lot people waiting food while waiting heard several complaints diners received wrong food   Anyway once home food found shrimp shrimp salad cooked properly beef satay extremely rare shrimp cakes cold uncooked  calling complain said would reverse charge credit card  suggestion wait several months until kitchen hopefully expands accommodate orders larger restaurant  <EOR> My wife expecting much more   restaurant highly recommended friend   rushed ordering waiter helpful rude other bus staff   asked medium spicy gauge spiciness level received bland   ordered red curry ended being sweet milk wife ordered chili mint noodles their version drunken noodles which basically sweet fried tofu barely any mint chili   We tasted wonderful food NYC San Diego Dallas even Little Rock Arkansas far worst Thai food had  vegetarian would rate pretty low  <EOR> From look outside place would expect inside   really nice    We ribs chicken wings ginger chicken   all very good but think wings best part  <EOR> This place busy whenever been  bit surprising  curries disappointing  making them overly creamy bland satisfy white folks' palate? green curry isn't even green! cream colored  Maybe she misheard thought ordered cream curry?! ordered heat level 9 didn't feel any heat whatsoever let alone break sweat runny nose did believe could handle heat? maybe she misheard again thought said five? Also curries come plain rice if want sticky rice specify want instead plain rice otherwise both which waste    The service ok    I might back soup other non curry dish but now based non green creamy curry can't higher Meh  experienced better  actually made better green curry!   This place close where live but think travel down Sahara unless pressed time more modest but more authentic place Thai curry fix   gas money covered then some price difference well  <EOR> If read other reviews you'll see Thai food foodie  Whenever travel search Yelp Thai restaurants search great Thai food  keep mind comparing place some favorite restaurants    This place fast service   cachew chicken brought under 5 minutes hot generous serving sticky rice  ordered medium spicy two scale five    I would rate flavor three five  better worse    I would recommend place if you're hungry Thai food live nearby    This first review Las Vegas look least couple more  <EOR> I've coming 10 yrs   Obviously it  Food good  Prices fair   Complaints service normally very good except getting check ask early Spicy level think changes depends cook we little spicy but much   #2 more #4 once  Kids couldn't eat it    That being said never send food back complaint cleanliness   hard say days    From outside looks dump  because they're often busy  <EOR> Very expensive food wasn't even good  Ordered to go Mongolian Beef Tom Yu Goong Thai Tea  Portions small ridiculously high prices  Wait time almost 45 minutes  don't mind waiting long if food tasted good! Never going back place again! <EOR> The consistency does here   any restaurant off serving but many times quality consistently good   spice level tends mild side you'll your number two   Although less authentic then say Lotus Siam no comparison wine selection quality par   Great find Henderson area  <EOR> I'm biggest Thai food eater but place ok  didn't really blow mind  pad thai noodles shrimp #5 spicy ness good green curry beef #7 spicy ness spicy slightly disappointed  fact close loved Thai tea    The service good friendly water glass always full  also tried best seat everyone asap  <EOR> Quiet busy around 8 week night impressed food   gave spot recommendations enjoyed it   definitely back when Vegas  <EOR> I've lived Thailand  restaurant run native Thai people flavors quite good  Thom ka soup phad thai panang curry  All good  best ever but eaten lot Thai food   can't wrong here  <EOR> The perfect place lovely evening  featuring extraordinary service excellent Thai food romantic in quiet background music playing softly lit atmosphere  closest  authentic Thai atmosphere seen outside Bangkok   Highlights all food course but addition full bar great cocktails attentive but obtrusive wait staff we especially appreciate hover scoop diner's plate while others still eating taking drink appetizer orders before main entree orders serving entrees until appetizers consumed  We cannot wait back  new fave Thai place  even better Archi's! <EOR> I love place!  Best curry ever!  cant seem order anything else when eat here   Service great well!  YUM! <EOR> Last nights dinner take out disappointing   ordered couple times past remembered     perhaps just enough other top notch Thai restaurants since then?    We ordered Crying Tiger beef catfish green curry chicken pad thai     crying tiger beef ok  basically steak little heap salad big wedge cabbage    sauce good but would preferred if steak marinated more     Catfish Green Curry pretty good but little salty    Otherwise would back dish!  the Pad Thai well pitiful    Cooked well but hardly any flavor would expect pad thai      Added some own lime juice it did come any lime which made more palatable    Needed more sauce would good    Overall bad meal but probably won't back  Especially prices! <EOR> I've least more five times food always delicious! great lunch specials 11am 3pm which comes entree soup rice wontons egg rolls under $10  also love conveniently close gym nice post workout meal! <EOR> Food great  service excellent even if when busy  Thai style BBQ chicken yellow curry chicken  good  authentic Thai food you'll definitely try  10 10 restaurant  <EOR> Fantastic food   coconut milk soup shrimp   Service consistently good   Prices extremely reasonable quality  <EOR> We eat atleast 4 times week because its close house   order spicy basil Level 4 which just right amount hotness me   food excellent can't value  <EOR> Love place!  red curry great well mint pork  Yum! regular 1 10 spice level isn't spicy usually 10 just right   service great maybe overwhelmingly friendly but fine   interior would expect strip mallish exterior warm inviting  Certainly regular Thai stop  <EOR> I've coming long can't remember  hot pots duck sticky rice people everything place awesome  always favorite always regular  favorites  <EOR> Step into quiet traditionally decorated Thai house where all servers dressed formal Thai clothing almost feel naked jeans shirt  family calls place pink cow but only because adore much  Strap buckle down some spicy soup served bowl literally fire Wor Wonton Tom Yum Koong  though dad just describes soups shrimp spicy lettuce   Ordered Chicken Sat Tay  Delicious! Only comes four though might want more   Masaman Tofu level 6  spicy  Could definitely added few notches real kick face    Chicken BBQ  big fan but everyone else gulped down  just think spicy enough    Spicy soup shrimp noodle things  dad called it  no idea waitress brought I think wonton soups but pretty tasty  wonton soups don't give lot shrimp if your taste buds flamingo like tendency should order Tom Yum Koong    All very good  Top off Thai Ice Tea could only better if someone could figure put alcohol it  Kahula maybe? Cheers! <EOR> Went yesterday first time  restaurant nicely decorated really does forget Vegas  Very nice atmosphere   I ate Red Curry number 10 Shrimp also ordered Chicken Satay Red Curry Chicken three  food excellent  did think 10 wasn't very hot  hotter then three which seemed very mild me  may just tolerance spicy hot food though but other places eaten seemed much hotter even 7    The portions decent price came $50 bucks desert three drinks  price seemed reasonable  satisfied both service value    The complaint very minor but thought amount rice served meal wasn't enough  Still I'd recommend stop in  <EOR> Awful NEW manager named MON treated family longtime customers over 10 years incredibly rudely!  less 10 minutes late due holiday traffic she gave away reservation  No problem bad  decided wait since fault being late  tables opened she gave tables other customers NO reservations  She finally pointed table instead booth requested said  fine  Then she CHANGED mind gave table located near door where cold wind blowing through   Wow  Don't ever few minutes late if reservation  Sad say many years being loyal customers new manager named MON give pause whether should ever return  Terrible manager!!! <EOR> I Pin Kaow many times food very good  However last night 9 25pm immediately upon walking manager told restaurant closing 15 minutes   Clearly front door says close 10pm  However real issue should much more accommodating any customer especially regular customer  Instead unnecessarily turned down business  Gaati Thai restaurant right much more accommodating much better food  also close 10pm even though 9 45 still set table did rush meal all    I never back Pin Kaow no longer recommend friends family  thousands dollars lost lack customer service decency  <EOR> fast service nice atmosphere  friendly staff  thai style bbq chicken steam rice  food tasted ok chicken didnt fresh off grill taste  tasted its sitting fridge precooked microwaved  steam rice good  <EOR> This hidden gem great authentic food  Four dinner weekend night seated right away  Always good sign when consistent flow people waiting takeout food practically all tables already occupied    It cozy atmosphere where feel rushed  staff friendly quick refills check us  food leave very satisfied  Thai tea Pad See Ew delicious wroth getting again next time am area  <EOR> Really friendly service excellent food!
