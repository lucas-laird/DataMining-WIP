I would highly recommend following Gyro Tacos which comes lamb meat but probably everyone's cup tea those steer away meat tastes gamey  Veal Meatballs topped Foie Gras cream need say more? Bacon Jam Brie bacon jam comes sizzling hot melted slab brie cheese top served toasted bread  Fried Chicken Skin Honey Dip each piece crisp perfection friend order all herself  Butter Burger side Tater Tots flavor packed between two soft buns     Other things ordered worth trying Smashed Potatoes mashed pototoes baked potato sliced into 2 3 pieces sour cream chives top  Tempura Green Beans great appetizer munch on  NY Strip Steak ordered medium rare outcome exactly very tender    Will definitely paying Carson Kitchen another visit future when Las Vegas again  <EOR> This extremely loud place  Also way hipster us  asked burger well no pink least 1 2 burger pink although did know until eaten half it  Also called butter burger yet tasted no butter it  fiancée red snapper entree when came looked appetizer very small portion  expected  also did chicken skin appetizer! concept ideal although seemed over Cooked burnt  <EOR> I ordered Wellington Empanada found quite interesting   light flaky crust did disappoint   thought beef inside little bit bland but remedied sauce pour it   also short rib sliders which decent but tater tots very yummy     The only drawback seems super awkward seating arrangement inside but could say good because stir more conversations accidentally bumping into people chairs   Next time would definitely try seat table looks into kitchen but only day sweltering  <EOR> Good food  Seems always pack  upstairs patio pretty large but don't seem want use much because 30 mins wait seated when 4 empty tables available upstairs  specifically asked patio seating hostess tried sitting Bar inside instead  small loud able enjoy dinner night out  But she able outside eventually  wouldn't saw place good large parties  Overall cool place if rush dinner  <EOR> I see why place packed every night   decor great   service nice   food very tasty   little above everyday price point but appreciate ground breaking place caliber come downtown   Kudos chef team Kerry Simon  <EOR> Great atmosphere!

Special thanks Tara server delight  <EOR> What say hasn't already said?   Carson Kitchen should your Downtown dining stamp card if pencil in  wandered few bites before meeting some friends birthday party sadly third time Carson Kitchen but first time actually eating food    I Gyro Tacos Wild Mushroom Flatbread A Drink Ms  wash all down  Carson Kitchen killed all fronts tacos surprisingly light very fresh Mediterranean flavors really shining through Wild Mushroom Flatbread flavor bomb accented flaky crust die for  both great options if just plan snacking bar before heading into Downtown Las Vegas  A Drink Ms  isn't quote Mad Men episode but solid Whiskey cocktail very sweet finish  sweetness comes maple syrup ginger beer  mixed hefty pour whiskey  cocktail verge being sweet but salty food eating kept everything perfect balance    Carson Kitchen left palate wanting more most people nowadays hunger controls schedule  Carson Kitchen 1 Nate 0  <EOR> We hadn't planned coming whilst Vegas however whilst exploring sleezy side Downtown choice dinner options fairly limited if wanted nice venue    However found place amazing food options nicely paired bit tapas where more sharing choosing your own dishes! Everything very reasonable priced far cheaper any main strip restaurant highly recommend it! <EOR> I don't recommend place if vegetarian health conscious  And neither does restaurant represent itself being vegetarian health friendly  The bacon jam tasted good but visually appealing due its blackish color and even little gross because marinating its fat    The lamb gyros dried much even yogurt sauce didn't cover dryness  pita bread moist tasty though wonder whether would better vegetarian dish   The two dishes really enjoyed Cuban although did really need pork belly? mac cheese  Both flavorful moist   However can't good conscious give more 3 stars since only half dishes can't imagine calories cost achieve those flavors   can't ignore mac cheese probably very fattening dish so much fellow diners could finish small dish   can't ignore Cuban 2 very thick slices cheese 2 buttered slices toast  Just because choose eat doesn't mean want eat more 1000 calorie meal  If wanted I'd gone Heart Attack down street  Review edited accuracy being contacted business owner  <EOR> Outstanding off beaten path   Great menu chef   Eclectic drinks superb staff   If downtown don't miss out <EOR> Carson Kitchen best tapas restaurants Vegas  Always amazing  Try mac n cheese NY Steak  Won't regret it <EOR> Amazing find! must try when Vegas  1 street off Fremont ave cool old hotel  able sit outside deck enjoyed lovely service fantastic food  server knowledgeable engaged  great cocktails  dishes designed share all delicious   I can't wait back  prices great value quality  <EOR> Restaurant looked nice  sat kitchen bar no except hostess when she sat acknowledged came over all while server going people sat me  15 minutes gave just left  <EOR> How could anyone give place less 5 stars? numerous experiences food service ambiance price place stole little piece foodie heart  surprises Kerry Simon place would win over  mean staff wear rock roll t shirts  Would expect anything less?

Just Go! <EOR> Hip little Castro pub style spot delicious flavorful food along tasty libations    You'll used fact don't many small personal tables more large high tops seating other guests but fun way talk your neighbors see everyone else eating    We started few gin cocktails called Margarian  Refreshing slightly sweet gin hard taste cucumber soda helps balance sweet  Easy drink!   The menu changes seasons nice know always something new try  ordered trout blood orange root salad  trout tasted more salmon good! skin crispy fish moist seasoned well  came creamed kale also flavorful perfectly seasoned  salad also great  Different textures tastes sweet orange rooted vegetables olive oil celery leaves  Perfectly balanced great pairing fish    We finished meal recommend only server but everyone else yelp bread pudding! usually fan bread pudding but made donuts sounded impossible dislike  was  Holy donut deliciousness! tasty! caramel sauce served drinkable  Yum!   Or server Courtney took great care us  appreciated recommendations friendly personality continuous good service    Carson Kitchen fun spot look forward going back  <EOR> Went Friday night  long wait but decided wait drinks over Fremont  time fast! ended sitting bar  Service food excellent!! tried jerk turkey burger chicken sandwich well Mac n cheese all really tasty  I'd recommend checking out  <EOR> Great atmosphere located heart downtown Las Vegas  tried many items menu  sliders little salty tater tots but tempura green beans amazing shrimp damn delicious  gotta shrimp!!  Geronimo great bartender enjoyed time here  hope see rooftop deck next time visit  <EOR> Food inventive but above average taste  I'm talking turkey burgers chicken sandwiches mac cheese folks    certainly trendy  box water when ordered water  Seats bit uncomfortable no back support if sit bar   cool watching sous chef prepare your meal   clean neat  But service terrible   Hard hard attention your server   only gone lunch  Maybe dinner different   sure would special effort again  <EOR> Loved it! visited Ohio if ever back Las Vegas Carson Kitchen where eating  Really interesting menu knowledgeable friendly staff  whiskey cocktail Towns End delicious mac cheese best EVER had! Fun atmosphere too  Even Cuban tots great  <EOR> Husband stopped before decided take trip back Phoenix  Sat chefs table full view everyone going work  all talked made feel very welcomed!   Food ordered gyro tacos start  delicious! Only three tacos but saw another table 4  little disappointed that! Next came bacon jam Brie  Wasn't really fan more BBQ dish anything  Coming off those tacos excited but left disappointed  Next came deviled eggs husband isn't fan deviled eggs but try it  thought delicious! Caviar top great final touch  Pancetta really crispy reminded eating those fake red bacon bits  Maybe switch meat  Next came lamb chops  Wasn't overly impressed  good cooked perfectly  Just didn't tickle fancy    Service fantastic  Great job Chef team!   Would defiantly come back menu rotates  Which believe every great restaurant should do  Great place! Sit chefs table full experience! <EOR> WOW yum   Our server very friendly accommodating  ordered much beginning he helped removing items before came out  Since told intended share meals thought would getting somewhat small portions but wasn't case all good thing  As food ordered Cuban sandwich phenomenal  am thinking right now  bread crispy flavorful pork belly juicy perfect amount  always mustard pickles separately but recently very much craving them definitely hit spot  Scallops flavor very good but we shared came three little cold sad face but super delicious  other two apparently good temperature  Bacon Jam don't know describe flavor but try it  savory sweet best combo ever? comes more would expect  Mac cheese barely taste because full but really yummy  last thing then uncertain much could eat but could just smell delicious would taste to  think bf intended put leftover bacon jam leftover mac cheese can't even imagine     o  Can't wait come back here  only thing would remember bring jacket because keep SUUUUUPER cold here! Hopefully next time could try patio upstairs too  <EOR> Most important part review passion professionalism entire staff seriously impressive! Wife stopped tried 6 different options 4 Social Plates n 2 Farm n Garden goes   Positives Gyro Tacos great could spend all night eating them  Mac n Cheese well worth it  Beets very tasty unexpected surprise  Did mention staff great? Negatives Veal meatballs bland side  Expected more crispy chicken skins  Thoughts prices little high amount food received   Will return definitely  saw some items left kitchen wish tried them vs going small plate route  Overall solid 4 but look forward returning seeing if rating improved  <EOR> So finally chance visit Carson Kitchen Downtown Las Vegas few weeks ago lunch  really liked Kerry Simon's previous restaurant Simon Kitchen Bar HRH figured newest restaurant near Downtown Container Park would pretty good  thoughts did disappoint!  THE DECOR 4 5 5 Upon entering restaurant which seemed some lower ceilings seemed much dining area beyond few tables bar area seating near kitchen  However larger area upstairs rooftop patio which think would great parties  restaurant kind dimly lit but plenty accent lighting bar area kitchen kind liked it  hip but intimate vibe it  also outdoor patio area where waited couple seats open which nice although might little hot heat summer   THE SERVICE 4 5 5 So short wait outside patio seated couple chairs immediately adjacent kitchen where literally few feet away prep sous chefs not exactly sure title just   server explained many dishes shareable kind attentive needs when needed refill etc   THE FOOD 5 5 And did think food? thought delicious! couple social plates Bacon Jam which awe some     and wish would jar stuff because I'd buy few jars if did Devil's Eggs crispy pancetta + caviar I liked although think would've liked pancetta more thinly chopped preference   Then Pork Belly Cuban Sandwich which came spicy tator tots which great came tasso ham + manchego cheese     Next time going try Crispy Chicken Skins Black Rice Oxtail Risotto which really good friend mine also another foodie said really good!  OVERALL 5 5 Overall think Carson Kitchen more 4 5 5 but since Yelp doesn't offer any 1 2 ratings decided give 5 stars as 4 stars just isn't quite enough   if you're looking some really good food I'd highly suggest checking Carson Kitchen now GO TO spot Downtown  <EOR> Excellent food network watching foodie you  Erotic  I mean exotic menu selections arouse your palate    <EOR> Came dinner friends based great online reviews recommendation friend  Group dining way since plates perfect sharing  server amazing made helpful recommendations dishes try much order cleared plates way efficient but didn't feel being rushed door  Definitely 5 star staff  food OK but menu didn't offer many vegetarian options probably place would come back but everyone else seemed it   We ordered ton probably bit much group 7    Deviled eggs Four halves = $11  nice creamy bit space some type meat top Roasted beets $11 YUM! Caesar salad $12 fine good dressing but small side Lamb tacos 3 small street style size = $12 add more $4 thought just OK but shouldn't take word since big lamb eater definitely don't prefer ground meat Baked mac cheese $12 didn't really love this  nice creamy but wasn't very hot truffle oil seemed strong Rainbow cauliflower $9 love cauliflower am sad say first cauliflower dish think ever ordered enjoyed  didn't care strong vinegar flavor Wild mushroom flatbread $14 meh  pickled onions nice but didn't care tuffle oil  Other things ordered didn't try but seemed crowd pleasers dinner companions Bacon jam brie $13   Pro tip save some eat mac cheese Veal meatballs $14 Pig Fig flatbread $13 Black Mussels $14 Short rib grilled cheese tater tots $14 NY strip $20 Overall would say service great  Menu just style food  <EOR> Unbelievable  Never even opened menu  Just ask most popular items menu tell them keep 'em comin!
