Falafel clearly made some factory made rehydrated powder mix  Pita bread thin dry  Kebobs DRY DRY DRY  Chicken Shawarma bland dry didn't even remind Shawarma any kind  The Gyro once again same factory bought pre made frozen mystery meat many places serve days  Rice flavorless didn't even taste fresh  Hummus terrible could also made some powder bought some supplier rather made house  better similar Hummus your local market  Tehini sauce water  It's unfortunate Mediterranean Greek Middle Eastern food restaurants popping all  over place fast cheap catering public know should really taste don't know when getting vamboozled  Many places seem offer similar menu items similar prices similarly horrible quality!  This just another those  Don't fooled  food nothing Greek middle easterner would consider edible! If served Falafel anywhere middle east Mediterranean would fly unless flung right back angry customers  <EOR> Update*** young lady owner  She owners sister apologize but wrong  She hilarious lol! mistook dry humor crappy personality!

Only complaint little expensive  <EOR> I'm long time sultans grill customer tonight tried new dessert      Greek delicacy rolled shredded phyllo dough  ITS MUST TRY!  Everything sultans frill AMAZING every day but new dessert delicacy addictive!! <EOR> Well disappointing   Sultan's Grill years ago when lived Summerlin first time figured I'd give another try picking library books since remembered being good   ordered gyro salad bowl lemon chicken rice soup   First off prices gone kind hurt paying almost $5 soup but craving some good lemon rice soup did   still craving some good lemon rice soup   The salad just ton romaine lettuce four grape tomatoes four slices cumber 4 olives each corner carryout container along sprinkling onions   did good portion gyro meat though but little dry side   Honestly most likely back especially since great salad better soup few miles down road Market Grill  <EOR> Love place  new area but spot Mediterranean food  Everything tried outstanding  salad gyro meat even rice fantastic  pistachio baklava desert best ever had  service really good treated very well  Highly recommend! <EOR> The Sultan you  He provides Gyros upon request despite Mediterranean decent serves burgers fries well  Sultan able fulfill any sudden need shawarma pinch he good for  kingdom lies within village center cir where mighty Vons once stood before evil Haggen buried ancient sands  <EOR> Nice place but food meh best  kafta dry cabbage way sour rice didn't much flavor   tzatziki overpowering  only good thing hot flat bread  <EOR> The name Sultan Mediterranean however food definitely Mediterranean    I ordered Chicken Shawarma plate rice drink  pita bread dry rice did much taste asked some sauce told would cost additional 54 cents    I consider place very Mediterranean wouldn't recommend anyone all    They poster wall says your patronage never taken granted  aim satisfy you  serve real privilege  Yeh right! <EOR> Sometimes crave gyro meat   Sultan's grill very close house satisfies cravings when gnaws am lazy drive Kabob Korner downtown   Sultan's Grill average Greek fare   Good great food hit spot when you're hungry   really bugs pita but more tortilla sized thin flatbread   grape leaves unfortunately very oily   price very reasonable lunch combos which include salad choice rice french fries   Sometimes think teenage girl works needs put more clothes but just humble prudish opinion! <EOR> On phone asked if possible Gyro salad half Gyro half chicken person phone told yes  she didn't tell going cost additional seven dollars Anticipated  would think detail would mentioned there's no question most likely would ordered did though didn't wasn't looking tell them interested very hungry   review strictly based lack communication which if would've known absolutely would ordered something else  ironic part really more meat     Oh charged $ 50 per dressing which mentioned phone which think kind funny petty when woman actually offered phone try both dressings   When place now top list     The ironic part total amount meat same would 1 meat would cheaper side meat gave here    salad sultan plate which supposed only 5 99 told phone total just shy $30  Robbery word comes mind  Lame very lame    <EOR> BY FAR most flavorful chicken shwarma ever tasted bar none  marinated chicken breast slices distinct Mediterranean seasoning  opted rice over fries glad did because yellow rice brownish red seasoning sprinkled rice really accentuated flavor rice  pita bread comes top your plate only drawback hummus subpar but chicken rice good place deserves 5 stars! <EOR> I place take  love salad dressing ! gyro Greek salad   Yum!! <EOR> I less thrilled Chicken Shawarma but may because EXCELLENT Chicken Shawarma Chicago   However Tomato Cucumber Salad delicious refreshing   also hummus trio those delicious well   flat bread warm soft  <EOR> The food good service abysmal  asked friend pick some food while working he told two people came served first  Also paid baklava take out bag when home  Needless say impressed  Very disappointed which shame since live close  <EOR> Have few times takeout Gyro fries   tried other items yet but did try tasty  problem kind slow getting food approx  10 mins time order sandwich fries    if want yours phone ahead don't stand around long  <EOR> These other reviews must realtives owner  because if ever real greek food wont this  chicken dry  OMG  must new owners because chicken dressing hot sauce all diffrent bad  only thing good lettuce not salad just lettuce rice  people nicer old people there  but take bad attitude good food  want money back  could used $8 dairy queen roccos next door  thumbs down! <EOR> I come often would adjust past review  While best town doesn't deserve 2 stars previously gave <EOR> Sultans Grill little tiny restaurant specializes Mediterranean food  only twice both times ordered same thing Gyro Sandwich consisted seasoned sliced beef tomato onion wrapped pita  price sandwich $5 99 stingy all probably size burrito  sandwich served tzatziki sauce side only advice is   ASK EXTRA SAUCE  sauce seriously brings together flavors sandwich CAN'T repeat CAN'T without it! lightness freshness sauce balances vegetables meat contained sandwich    Like mentioned above little restaurant limited amount tables dine in customers however offer take out sandwich excellent choice you're on the go which was  Upon entering cashier seated table but she immediately welcomed service awesome  <EOR> I'm happy found place hard find type food Vegas  really good hummus chicken shawarma lemon rice soup fatoosh tabouli falafel comes lots bread sauces  always carry little pricey but totally worth maybe just order lot haha <EOR> Love it  Best Greek food wife memory   A+ rocks   Really more need know side?
