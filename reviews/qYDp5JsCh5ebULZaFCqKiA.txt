This place if you're Seattle Seahawks fan   summer wasn't open seat whole place though rather large restaurant bar   order nachos which less desired   They did some pitcher specials Pyramid   nice good Seattle beer available away home price wasn't bad all   give place rating beer selection pro Seahawks environment   Other just mediocre  <EOR> Probably worst bars Las Vegas  Smokey high prices shitty food really bad service  came first game NFL season last year follow Seahawks  only 2 people bar seemed hate way busy very unhelpful only thing place stressed clogging video poker nobody playing bar  spending $40 beer food decided would just buy Sunday ticket instead direct TV  Also TVs extremely dated projection Box TV super distorted  <EOR> Really? $9 pitcher happy hour special domestic beer only? Even no smokers around place smelled Denny's yesteryear when everyone smoked   Food nothing excited yet prices show think are    dissapointment   Should heeded caution other yelp review  <EOR>
