Food came quickly which awesome! definitely back again!! <EOR> I am HUGE breakfast lunch fan  tried all area just OK me  seated promptly arriving greeted very nice server  Red Velvet Pancake okay waffle its flower shape more entertaining look appealing tummy  But very pretty nonetheless    My major gripe charged $1 99 child's drink even though bought kids meal   pretty ridiculous me  Usually drinks come purchase children's meal  am very conscious pricing kids   really annoyed me  when  mama  ain't happy     its good   probably won't back    <EOR> Very good breakfasts very friendly service   almost every weekend visit family  <EOR> I love place! service stellar remembered only couple times in  usually skillet potatoes perfectly done  Buttery crust outside soft inside  biscuits gravy taken notch recently just delish! love don't nasty sluggish feeling eating either!

Great coffee low prices good quality food good sized portions  menu isn't expansive competing breakfast chains but think theirs more original certainly gets job done tastes! back late weekend breakfasts  <EOR> The food good customer service good  more ask for? Faster service! come lunch time usually less hour  place never packed doesnt more 2 3 tables time but some reason takes long time food come out  Just sure ask check to go boxes when your food  <EOR> Outside myself daughter only 4 tables guests 2 servers   I'd say weren't busy   sure why unable warm coffee ask meal check us   I know breakfast time but daughter asked Diet Coke  Standard you'd think   server told out   He did however someone run Vons p u couple cans which he brought over when meal over   The food mediocre potatoes skillet far cooked    Definitely going back again  <EOR> Griddle cakes does SuMmerline location      too bad can't update information site   wasted time looking place     went over Egg Works  <EOR> It isn't anything spectacular but isn't terrible either  Sometimes food little extra crispy sometimes just right  would give 4 stars but really must give 3 because isn't consistent every time certain things questionable  say though IHOP right across street but would defiantly choose place over them any day  still doesn't say whole lot place   I usually order waffles  If isn't overcooked very tasty  tried chicken waffles once but chicken just seems frozen chicken finger nuked put top   eggs usually only thing cooked perfect taste good  asked sides before such extra ranch mayo gotten weird extras cup brought in    Basically place isn't bad every once while but take family friends would t Rachel's Kitchen Bagel Cafe  coupon every now then mail when generally eat there  <EOR> Wow breakfast!  service amazing food perfect!  son eggs silver dollar pancakes then pancakes better expected   french toast which usually order when becuase inside usually soggy   best stack french toast years!

Coffee hot continuous menu isn't overwhelming but adequate   usually order omelet some veggies which comes toast potatoes  Never disappointed!  also skillets which huge! breakfast burrito many other places I'd recommend better burritos!      Very kid friendly girls happy face pancakes which quite bit p'cakes eggs potatos toast for anti meat unless its McDonalds cheeseburger child always over well!   Service usually timely nothing quick but very ordinary   atmosphere nice wide open decorated space   don't come sensory overload greasy bacon smell lingering your hair either    always bonus! Definitely worth try! <EOR> The pancakes large receive large portions  meals very reasonably price  Everything delicious!! <EOR> I mood good breakfast couldn't wait check menu  don't see lot places offer chicken waffles when spotted knew try it! When came wasn't expecting  waffle beautiful  kind looked flower but piece chicken disappointing  thinking chicken would drumstick chicken strip  wasn't quantity    I just think taste different  would rather chicken bones it  would give more down home type appeal   waffle fresh could tell wasn't frozen because crispy outside fluffy inside   I thought restaurant's decor could brighter  If going mustard yellow why step above sunshine yellow!  just think brighter yellow would remind more breakfast   say love bright colors!   The service fine  food came timely manner didn't hunt down waitress refills  just thought entree could better   <EOR> How recreate Griddle omelet experience home 5 steps 1  Throw all your seasonings spices window  Don't forget salt pepper  2  Use canned products whenever possible  Cook omelet until reaches consistency styrofoam  3  Roughly chop some potatoes cook only until slightly browned side  Remember step #1  4  Plate your creation  5  Lay Kraft Singles cheese slice top whole mess   Adding star because servers attentive patio nice  <EOR> I place hopping find sometime different breakfast honest little disappointed  food bad but didn't see anything special it  ordered benedicts eggs friend southwest griddle   plate great expected however griddle looked lot better   give place another chance order griddle red velvet packages which appear most popular plates   services atmosphere just ok  <EOR> The name changed Griddlecakes  all changed  quality food service gone down prices gone up  won't back  <EOR> We just moved found little gem   If down home cooking then place you!  ordered breakfast burrito 4 year old daughter holy smokes HUGE totally could shared   two hotcake combo again much more ever could eaten   food hot really fantastic   service great coffee kept coming   think Friday morning regular  <EOR> Tried place brunch day honey delicious! seated right away food didn't take long either  relaxing atmosphere very homey  food really good stingy portions! barely ate half food waiter very generous coffee  waiter really attentive friendly overall  definitely going back! <EOR> We stopped breakfast morning leaving Las Vegas  IHOP nearby but really glad ended here  eggs Benedict minus Canadian bacon pretty tasty  real points personality though  server really sweet efficient even though she brand new  saw lots folks suspect regulars having coffee breakfast  really mom pop feel it  <EOR> Bleh  Bland underdone diner food  Needed serious salt some additional time griddle  Soggy potatoes ok omelet  Wouldn't back  <EOR> Awesome service   best places Summerlin   Highly recommend if kids  <EOR> Stopped some quick eats but rained decided hang little kids area corner!  +1 Griddle being extremely KID FRIENDLY!
