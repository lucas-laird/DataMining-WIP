As waited steaks cooked fresh bread butter provided   think ate all bread before steaks served delicious   reason dine good steak house course steaks    Both filet's cooked perfectly tender juicy pretty much delicious    steak more flavor however pretty close top class filet overall   I'd no hesitation order filet again   worth noting price difference between 8oz 12oz filet only $8 would hard pass larger steak such little difference price!  also ordered both Béarnaise sauce Bordelaise sauce never Bordelaise sauce before really glad tried it!   tasted Béarnaise sauce well however used Bordelaise sauce almost exclusively      The service would expect price point very professional very knowledgeable menu food   never felt rushed nor did feel missing something when should it   did notice some other Yelpers mentioned service weak point simply experience    If suggestion improvement manager could more proactive coming over address tables ask everything going meal   actually called manager over compliment food service he almost seemed surprised great things say   If gentleman regularly interacting tables maybe wouldn't case     Overall Strip House very good experience quality food great service even price paid   inexpensive no mistake however pay sometimes them  <EOR> Loved warm garlic bread Gorgonzola fondue yummy!

Well anyway despite size question best chocolate cake ever? would venture say no  cake itself good sweet good quality cocoa flavor but wasn't quite moist expected  thin layers chocolate cream between helped bit counter this  Overall bad chocolate cake size isn't bad bargain $14  just wasn't quite awesome I'd imagined would be    Overall given price range place definitely worth money  Although food palatable price pay should way more that  Really think more 2 5 kind joint but bump 3 spinach cake  even though rates 3 star I'd give pass  <EOR> Tried it  Steak way salty  tried fix but next steak came way over done  Chocolate cake looked good  <EOR> Steak potential  salty  much pepper  scrape off <EOR> An absolutely excellent meal  service ambiance food   everything top notch!
