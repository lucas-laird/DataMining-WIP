But if feel congealing your throat every bite maybe time rethink your cooking technique   I would nicely ask them remake food except nobody ever bothered come check me  1 refill coffee despite sitting bar directly front full coffee pot  1 reappearance waiter see things even though food untouched  Twice thought someone going check but turned just taking break bar few seats down me  nice food cooked liked cups full!   finally some lady came over asked everything was  told greasy eat  honest god response? Next time tell cook less grease  Well if tell cook food edible can't warm your coffee point even eating breakfast here??
