Really?  just ahead ate burger then just ate fries when came later    But someone going around tables your restaraunt asking if everything ok if anything need?  Then only manager going around tables asked again?  double check sure Carl's Jr  nice touch fast food place  <EOR> The dining room smell only compare construction site portable outhouse  lack skill required work fine establishment amazing  cook figure sausage should part breakfast sandwich sausage it  cashier believe supervisor manager surprisingly slow could barely function  other employee very angry herself believe she even head butted wall  would steer clear if all possible unless torment anguish   I would most likely never return location last time washed restroom men's room believe due could only imagine explosion diarrhea  When sprayed restroom which flowed into dining area  smell foul caused several guests beyond myself vacate dining area  utter disgust  <EOR> Worst place ever! Slow service ghetto! Some guy ordered already he still didn't order 30 min! waited line 10 min line did move! Never coming here    <EOR> There dining room supposed open till 10 but when 945 doors already locked some guest left through door guy front claims manager says register time which guess must 15 mins more off then he says refuse service anybody helping order food  Terable guest service obviously don't care making sale eather least Jack box down street welcome us  <EOR> pretty good   love burgers fries always hit spot <EOR> Horrible ordered food waited ten minutes while employee's stood around  Finally food back where staying both hamburgers burnt jalapeno poppers hollow empty when called complain hung me    Stay clear place        Over priced bad food  <EOR> Do here!
