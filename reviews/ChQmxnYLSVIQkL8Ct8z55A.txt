Very poor  Avoid place  <EOR> If looking bread sandwich otherwise save your money keep walking! Service slow food weak <EOR> I just ate over weekend course read reviews ahead time probably would gone there   However pleasantly surprised place bad some reviews   Yes saw sign front am big fan Scotto Family's restaurants i e  Zeffarinos Venetian    think food certainly better however service great which reason why giving 4 stars instead 3      Perhaps good day?  perhaps making strong effort improve   whatever worth think deserve positive review experience  <EOR> Came quick appetizer bite   No wait table but waiting food takes long time  waited minimum 15 mins food restaurant busy all  can't imagine wait would if busy  I ordered half dozen oysters open face clams  clams delicious but oysters tasteless tasted frozen awhile   I also ordered lobster bisque which recommend getting    Come back again?

Ask Carlos bartender if inclined sit bar   He provides fantastic attentive service   If sit bar Happy Hour prices overall value outstanding!  Karen <EOR> The food place excellent  large party able accommodate quickly  drinks great taste weak first next thing know you're slurring  strong believe me  desserts very good  only thing wasn't fan waiter  He bit jerk friendly but arrogant  <EOR> The service worst  ask everything only could flag someone down  Food even good  Save yourself headache pass elsewhere  <EOR> Our waitress friendly  However waited long time food party 4 40 mins  seated 1 30pm weren't even lot if guests  All ordered 2 omelets steak eggs special bowl lobster bisque didn't expect take long! already each finished 3 cups coffee before food arrived  Prices average  $10 $13 omelets $10 $12 sandwiches salads $12 $20 pasta  $9 bowl soup  $5 mimosas bloody mart all day   Food taste quality okay I'd compare Denny's but smaller portions  did lobster bisque salty  recommenf just sticking specials they're also cheaper  brother's steak 5 oz ny strip eggs only $7 95   Overall bad great  Just okay  <EOR> The only reason giving them 2 stars because service food absolute crap  If breakfast freakin breakfast combo sense  <EOR> Sad see low reviews  group came twice weekend  once lunch once breakfast thought pretty good   **Lunch 4 1 Oysters half shell yummy  esp  lemon Tobasco horseradish! Lobster bisque needs little more salt needs pieces lobster! Chicken sandwich fries can't recall specific name menu item Fettucine alfredo Sex Balcony cocktails REVIEW Sat bar great time!

I say staff very friendly helpful once did arrive  restaurants good people  <EOR> This restaurant looks promising but ultimately food didn't deliver   New England seafood shack theme going which very comforting nautical decor decent selection drafts tap aquarium full oversized cramped fish looking bored over bar   If sit bar late night happy hour $5 beers some food specials   ordered lobster bisque mahi mahi but little disappointed them both   bisque salty but flavorful   mahi mahi though did taste mahi mahi me   very flaky skin thick oily   no expert but thought supposed meaty fish chewier texture  any rate other choices nearby another seafood place next door don't think I'd back    Service really good though  <EOR> Was walking around miracle mile looking decent brunch place  brunch menu looked simple unique decent prices  decor nice homey  decided special brunch item which french toast bananas special maple syrup butter  also added side 3 sausage links  wife California omelette    The presentation looked great but once bit into french toast something tasted burnt  All 3 pieces french toast burned  pissed off damn cook audacityto serve burned food server allowed served  acceptable  complained server took few minutes later she returned properly prepared dish  pretty decent but still steaming burnt toast  wife's omelette pretty petite much cheese  breakfast potatoes excellent   Service slow  cannot recommend restaurant because allow burnt food served customers  First impressions last lifetime NEVER back  <EOR> Yikes food TERRIBLE  No flavor avocado put omelet 5 different shades brown  don't even brown potatoes just boiled thrown plate haphazardly  <EOR> We rough start Vegas when arrived  Walked around PH   Found place  bar tender Frank amazing   told just feed bring drinks  He made day  Turned frustration into pure delight  stopping again before leave   Thanks Frank making day  <EOR> Wasn't impressed ice tea wasn't  brewed that''s sure   Breakfast  Denny's would improvement  hostess waiter good   Gave toast without butter but  did bring when asked   Won't eat again  <EOR> Since friends craving wanted something quick before watching Britney stumbled across place chose sit bar    The server fairly nice  little awkward times since only ones restaurant he tried break ice asking questions    There's special bar menu which decently priced  If remember correctly items no more $12  also recently introduced burgers but decided pasta instead  could choose pasta sauce wanted  food heavy decently portioned   It nice place  Seemed mom pop restaurant located inside casino resort  Definitely would come back if area see show needed something casual  <EOR> We came celebrate friend's birthday  party 8 ordered 2 dozen oysters appetizer then another entree birthday boy  3rd dozen live worm wiggling plate   When pointed waiter manager watched them pick through oysters behind bar find additional worms  YUCK!  Now concept fresh seafood lost me   I oysters just ocean may come few additional creatures but checking worms should part shucking process?    They took off 2 3 dozen oysters bill until protested   didn't pay any oysters but minds forever scarred!  quite sad since favorite seafood place Vegas  Time find new one! <EOR> Worst  Restaurant  Ever   Moldy food rolls should never green  notice before while bringing food?   Atrocious service  Then audacity charge it   This being Vegas let's odds happen first health departmet shuts them down incompetent management bankrupts them  place only survives sucker tourists  <EOR>
