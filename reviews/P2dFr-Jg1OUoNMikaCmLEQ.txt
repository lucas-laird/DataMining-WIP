Anthony server great attentive apologetic  wasn't fault  manager Eddie came over asked if wanted something else  afraid try any other disappointments them said no he walked away! He never introduced himself manager ask someone else  HE NEVER APOLOGIZED! kind restaurant manager does that?! manager server cook work team  If only 1 3 does job customers suffer  He took drinks burger tiramisu off bill  He should've comped entire tab  When hanging family Vegas avoid place all costs!! <EOR> Came take out    Ordered sandwich two lattes slice cake  cashier asked whether wanted everything together said yes  Two minutes later lattes arrive first cup 50% other 80% full  sandwich tell wait 15 minutes  7 10 minutes later bring ugly plastic bag order  take room realize never put cake there  total all slightly over $30  Very very disappointing experience <EOR> Love new renovation menu still similar old cafe  But wait time food come ridiculously long  Even if just order 1 thing even if there's only 1 2 other tables It'll still take them 30+minutes bring your food out  least food semi decent but because made wait long it   Don't eat if short time you'll forsure late  <EOR> Another great breakfast way Vegas   Complimentary champagne coupon Planet Hollywood room! <EOR> Sometimes criteria hotel restaurant Las Vegas suitable convenience relative affordability  Recently renovated now opened 24 hours brightly blue spacious cafe serves decent variety food should satiate your palate midst late night  modern take diner hosts plentiful number tables your dominating worry would wait food    While service slow presumably still fresh its recent opening training decor wonderfully new walls swamped nostalgic photos days Planet Hollywood restaurant fad  But course you're ambiance The simple menu mostly comprised typical menu your American dining restaurant but small section Asian fares  Fried Calamari Simple enough 3 4 people dish could benefit more scallions toppings  Citrus Kale Decent amount cheese nuts salad brings tart balance crunchy texture every bite  Singapore Noodles best dish ordered bowl noodles combines thinly sliced vegetables dry curry powder aromatic stimulating  Pork Belly Ramen dish does look picture carries slightly salty taste soup based seemingly flooded soy sauce bottle  definitely better dishes menu  Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo Blend slightly dry dish definitely should include more pasta would feel hungry devouring dish  placement herb might look enticing but would more flavourful if chopped sprinkled over dish  Thai Basil Chicken Though slightly chewy chicken certainly filling but could more flavourful more basil which isn't even sliced  BBQ Ribs Quite filling soft tender texture easily falls apart bite  second best dish ordered more expected table 8 couldn't even finish!   Food 3 5 5 Service 4 5 Ambiance 4 5 Environment 4 5  If you're instead nitpicking over acceptable variety food you'll probably more bothered useless lamps hanging over every table provides practically no luminosity hence poor lightning focus photos   But prepared food won't look same photos menu  <EOR> Went Saturday night meal   myself plenty two top tables available but staff seated split booth couple other half booth   place number TV screens around well pictures Hollywood stars   TV across room game wanted watch available two top table   asked if could move see game staff said no problem since hadn't ordered   then took seated two top table but another split booth another couple other half booth   Strange   food Rueben Sandwich very good   sauce served side rye bread mild but flavorful  fries while piping hot tasty crisp  <EOR> Breakfast sounds good l but dinner time  major where find amazing breakfast food dinner  Oh  right Las Vegas!
