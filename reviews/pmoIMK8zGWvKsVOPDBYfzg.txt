For dessert decided pistachio souffle white chocolate sauce   Completely fluffy moist sweet goodness bowl   stood beautifully wonderful crisp crunch outside oh so soft warm melted inside   last bite where white chocolate sauce fused melted into remains souffle complete perfection   Normally would scoff dropping much coin single meal but place now going built into Vegas budget   year away going again already craving food   already decided rack lamb Dover sole next round! <EOR> Very good food exceptional service ambiance  started champagne cocktails bar before moving downstairs dining room  dining room elegant forget completely only wall two away casino floor  lobster bisque beef tongue filet veal loin lobster chocolate souffle  food bit rich and tiniest bit salty but flavors perfectly executed  food equal quality enjoyed top restaurants Paris last year  lovely dinner would recommend place anyone looking excellent food service strip  <EOR> A must foodies fine sense attention detail!  good friend  wonderful wine paired dinner 2 months ago   both 5 course tasting menu   sure but may changed new fall winter menu but  talented Chef Gary LaMorte wheel see no hesitation anyone give Andre's try!   The first thing catch your eye restaurant your normal Las Vegas fine dinning eatery   stroll into beautiful bar into very intimate dinning room   would say 50 seater   really catches your attention decor room  Elegant but over top  room set lot space between tables often over looked when other restaurants try cram many tables into room   loved felt old school new school same time    I would highly recommend tasting menu wine pairings   Every course came table greeted Chef Gary coming table explaining dish!  think key see Chef come into dinning room greet guests!  know depending service Chef may every single table but fact other diners see Chef making effort guests something don't see everyday Las Vegas   Now food!!!!!!!

If looking romantic evening definitely place go! <EOR> I guess because old Andre's downtown which closed down now only give 2 stars course good downtown past  food didn't taste bad just meeting downtown could offer  don't know why  suppose same owner same chef why difference?? My husband Rib Eye steak dover sole  husband said Rib Eye steak bad but wow  dover sole okay but sauce sour couldn't really taste fish  sourness sauce overpowered taste beautiful dover sole  little bit disappointing   At end husband carrot cake souffle raspberry white chocolate souffle  But pour mixed sauce poured white chocolate sauce carrot cake souffle cream cheese anglaise raspberry white chocolate souffle the right order should white chocolate sauce raspberry white chocolate souffle cream cheese anglaise carrot cake souffle   remake other 2 us  The taste really funky when wrong sauce wrong souffle     At end charged $1 caring donation probably because remaking souffles  just stupid enough ask them spot  should asked if $1 due fact remake souffles  guess tired night brain didn't function properly  Now think even wonder why didn't tell them sauce dover sole sour????? Why didn't say something right away? Now only learn lesson fine dining tiring night  But knows other caring donation would charged if going remake dover sole! just don't understand why didn't state everything front     it seems wrong me  never asked pay someone's mistake past dining experience    We going back all don't seem doing business right way  disappointment  Even bigger disappointment when old Andre's compare with  Sigh      <EOR> Don't group earlier 7 30   arrived 6 45 group three awkwardly hushed romantic   However if  scene you're looking lovely   think maybe better couples groups   decor styling can't faulted   two foodies non foodie food fearful person group   Andre's great way introduce fine French food   courses nicely paced   Normally only order course time prevent kitchen turning dishes quickly   server Andre's politely asked if could order all courses start meal help kitchen prep then just inform when would them fired   iPad wine list interesting but working great when used it   However really broke wines nicely help selection process   apps included Cesar salad don't judge    escargot fois two ways   Treatment fois very nice though found fruit compote bit cloyingly sweet would liked bit more acid liven richness seared fois   escargots very nice   Entrees included hoisin duck venison rack lobster thermidor   husband loved lobster but again thought just rich without lot complexity   He voiciferously disagrees   non foodie friend really impressed hoisin duck   all split nutella souffle dessert loved wasn't sweet   Overall very impressed quality meal   elegant very professionally served   would absolutely back   If group would probably later reservation   think would also very likely sit bar right outside could people watch while enjoying full menu  <EOR> Went another couple take advantage travelzoo coupon  advised staff using coupon ready receive noticeable drop quality service  limited menu cod use due coupon ready taste b team  final expectation standard French restaurant would overly formal stuffy  restaurant did meet expectations   The service excellent  Attentive without being bothersome  expectations service exceeded   The food top notch  overly brash innovative daring?  No  however excellent very well executed  amuse bouche excellent desserts even coupon menu all fantastic   Finally atmosphere very fine classy refined  But stuffy  server light appropriate sense humor  bussers fun but irreverent   I think only two meals left satisfied every way did one  earned all five stars  <EOR> Andre's very special place restaurant heart  eating Andre's its original 6th Street location since 1982  Back '80s early 90's Las Vegas restaurant wasteland  exception Andre's   eaten Andre's dozens times never bad meal ever    The service exemplary knowledgable but no way stuffy snooty  selection wines cognacs extensive   The Monte Carlo location everything originl plus much better ambiance  <EOR> Pricey   Food good   Decor fine   Service good   took recommendations waitress   Lobster Thermadour tasty but extremely rich   Couple bites good go   huge portion share   enjoyed foie gras appetizer   souffles good big sinister your own   Overall jut okay   better options strip  <EOR> My boyfriend share same birthday decided try Andre's suggestion colleague based yelp reviews    As Charles Chef Greg mentioned reviews new decor beautiful  loved very romantic but three parties restaurant time party sat next very loud distracting  On bright side learned several new marketing techniques Italian neighborhood's New York  Ha! We started amuse chilled carrot soup shrimp balsamic reduction  delicious! never fan chilled soup but flavors melded perfectly and boyfriend eat vegetables hey bonus points     For starters ordered pan seared foie gras bison carpaccio  foie gras absolutely fabulous really well complimented apple tart! conversation followed took first bite BF Well it? Me Just try it   BF Tell is  Me tell try it    Needless say he tried loved it  Then told he wouldn't eat anymore it  Oh well more yay!  never tried bison looking forward it  very good nice flavor it  pesto accompanied bit overpowering but possible much bite  arugula pickled mushrooms standard nothing special me    For entrees filet beef potato wrapped salmon    filet very tender cooked exactly way liked hollandaise sauce extremely well beef asparagus   did potato onion confit aka caramelized onions top potato slice   felt if onion overcooked giving slightly bitter flavor although crispness potato nice lacked any seasoning    The salmon cooked nicely crust very crisp but lacked any wow would expect place caliber  think boyfriend wished he ordered something else    We ordered grand marnier souffle perfect  Very good  If  huge fan chocolate yes am female why ask? would recommend place  although waited until dinner almost over really didn't take long  But then again enjoying company    As drinks  beginning meal asked if wanted wine  Well did want wine but bf won't drink considering am petite young gal 25 figured didn't need whole bottle myself   ask if vodka martini when decide want order would appreciate some help pairing wine glass maybe even half bottle  Well martini came but help choosing wine didn't   stuck martinis which fine but considering extensive wine list little disappointing    Which brings next point  service little underwhelming   While decent only suggestion made foie   would think server would talk passionate food give some suggestions when prodded  decided order salads starters but she never came back before entrees arrived  enjoyed bread spread but ran bread never offered anymore  water served cold no ice sorry don't believe paying bottled water    sure why service table lacking clearly wasn't other two tables    I looking forward unforgettable memorable evening birthday left really disappointed  really really wanted love restaurant   recall when teenager grandparents would frequent Andre's downtown always raved it  waiting try Andre's years!   I want give another chance really but many great establishments try city   wanted taste buds dance wanted feel special just really didn't  <EOR> Great ambience service except some food quality malheureusement!  I ordered French onion soup duck entree  friend ordered Ceaser salad  sea bass  duck really great but few slides sausage came salty  friend's sea bass very fishy he able smell when brought over    I surprised food quality restaurant awarded Michelin 1 star  Since invited another friend inclined give any negative comment front host    We later cigar lounge which very lovely  Overall ok experience but back if dime  <EOR> This cigar lounge upstairs restaurant  ambiance exceptional just looking enjoy cigar away hustle noise strip  felt private club treated royalty  music old school classy Benny Goodman Frank Sinatra Edith Piaf like  Perfect puffing sipping  <EOR> I decided spend New Year Eve Andre based Yelp 4 star reviews even though some people did complain salty fish certain foods   After trying New Year Eve tasting menu very disappointing   None dishes made lasting impression biggest problem some dishes way salty   The main course roasted chicken filled foie gras   sauce way over salted can't taste foie gras anything else inside   Same sweet pea soup king crab   salt killed most flavors food   It $185 tasting menu dinner wine tips $250   Sad say place no where comparing French Landry even local popular French places San Francisco bay area much better French food much lower price     I certainly back again  <EOR> What gem!!!

Don't much better places Vegas <EOR> Top notch experience start finish   wife celebrated anniversary did disappoint   If into foie gras highly recommend foie gras martini which fortune night having truffle   combination fat foie gras vodka made interesting buzz   Worth every bit $18   would advise having more foie gras appetizer overload   rabbit excellent served bold reduction   Although bit small restaurant offered necessary ambiance occasion   Left feeling satisfied without necessity feel full doing so  <EOR> Food tasted good but service not    This fourth time Vegas meeting friends halfway around world decided treat ourselves nice dinner here    From researching online saw Andre's great reviews well located hotel staying at    Since friends could understand english asked waitress if she could patient first foremost if she could slowly explain some dishes interested in  She gave weird look then explained pretty quickly using food language people weren't normally associated hearing esp those still learning english  OKAYYY       Anyways ordered the  Lobster Bisque Prime Angus Ribeye Rack Colorado Lamb Celery Root Truffle Risotto and 1 Banana Caramel 1 Chocolate Souffle  and everything very very delicious!   Here tip main dish just enough person order but if anything want try order share your friends    The presentation amazing person bringing food super nice informative  really everything great except waitress  expected better service Andre's    I remember telling friends restaurant very well known though dishes excellent service bit embarrassing  seems other reviews liked service maybe mine having bad day  <EOR> My wife Andre's while vacation enjoyed very much  sat booth quiet corner but well cared for  chef's taste menu featured choice 5 7 courses  7 since included foie gras one wife's favorites   Each course two options which nice since could try each other's dish  corn soup duck very good risotto  best part amazing service  Each course perfectly timed never felt rushed ignored  Hard explain but great service fine balance between attention privacy  team Andre's down very pleased  If want impress your lady great meal don't hesitate try place  <EOR> My husband decided give restaurant try while Vegas some friends  Hubby Travelzoo coupon while friends ordered regular menu  would say all dishes mediocre other foie gras which pretty tasty  disappointing visit especially rated Michelin star  <EOR> This review only cigar bar upstairs but TERRIFIC!!
