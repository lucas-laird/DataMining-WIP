I  recently wanted buffet decided try Pacific Buffet recently opened area   i surprised many different food options buffet food good   should give try won't disappointed  <EOR> It seems previous reviews expecting fine chinese dining experience   buffets but don't expect them great   being able try many different items   reasons enjoyed meal Pacific Buffet   sushi items better any buffet to   enjoyed cream cheese wontons sweat sour soup fried pork shrimp dishes   deserts dry flavorless   didn't know pay drink but tab still only came $8 change lunch   did leave room mongolian wok   try next time   If come reasonable expectations enjoy  <EOR> Not bad   Not bad all   basically buffet 99% chinese food   other 1% consisted sushi which never trust buffet Jello  think $8 lunch impressive variety food choices price   Drinks included too!     They lot different stir fry's BBQ beef chicken fish dishes   There's hot bar where pile noodles veggies meats together hand chef where he cooks right front you   give 3 stars because first dish good but didn't feel going back more   Even though variety food oil stir fry meats just kinda gets if beyond first plate  just yelp rating says A Ok   <EOR> For money better Asian buffet part town   food ok overall   Some dishes quite good   staff friendly   restaurant clean   keep buffet full warm   Again money won't find better option around here  <EOR> Arrived right opening anticipating some fresh piping hot dishes waiting my family right off bat  However       Some dishes looked day before just heated up  Other dishes pretty tasteless even adding seasoning    My dad's only comment following least lemon wedges offer big slices  He squeezed lemon over few selections add taste    The service awesome  would hope less ten parties whole place  Plates cleared right away drinks refilled right quick too    If could give half star would rated place 2 5 stars because excellent service  <EOR> 2 1 2 stars give them little bit credit   Really Chinese buffet MEH   eat cheap Chinese buffets!  food just isn't cheap eats par   I can't explain it   The decor place funny because doesn't exactly scream Asian Oriental   restaurant think used steak house some sort shows   colors everything kinda remind log cabin   Talk confusing!  You'd think going some kind Asian fusion cuisine   Unfortunately far anything that   Service ok fast refills your drinks just don't expect lots smiling faces casual banter     I've lunch few times just good enough maybe full   food standard would find lots Chinese buffets Vegas Beef Broccoli Won Tons Egg Drop Soup Orange Chicken Mongolian Beef salad bar sushi bar tiny dessert bar   course your required Cheese Pizza restaurant which always very cheesy stir fry station where concoct your own creation  bad   few different items such Fried Frog Legs   Fried Chicken Wings which excellent I think because sprinkling MSG afterwards especially squeeze lemon dip some ketchup   Just sure them while fresh oil piping hot     If eat lunch weekend Pacific Buffet all day dinner menu things New York Steak oysters crab legs   However rest standard fare well    just standard   quality just isn't there!  low standards Chinese buffet!  Most food mediocre often times tastes sitting under heat lamp just little bit long   don't started sushi station   wee bit scared when your sushi just shade over room temperature   Salmonella start your engines!  Just thing   If you're going eat keep eye freshest trays food come kitchen your best bet   If all food rotated more often could see ratings bit     We continue only because closest Chinese buffet place   prices reasonable around $7 lunch weekdays $11 dinner   Saturday Sunday all day dinner menu $11   Drinks set back little over $1 per person   funny because 'Grand Opening' sign outside doors almost year now since they've open    Really only if you're pinch feel living dangerously every once while risking some food poisoning trichinosis!  Nah just kidding!  Well    I think am! <EOR> Why did waste money again? should just gone red robin's  My expectations aren't high when comes chinese buffets but gahh   C'mon   Wtheck    Usually would find least thing chinese buffet would like   something hot tasty oily   but no even close thing good Everything bland food seriously poor quality  Everything plainly sucked   All it!! plus could understand hostess new   but shouldn't run around chasing customers telling where sit without directing own place?   jeez  Sucky food    seriously thinking another reason five them another star butttttt total waste money  would just stick Buffet @ asia cheap chinese buffet  im sorry but NEVER AGAIN  <EOR> Well should read reviews BEFORE walked door   others said don't usually high expectations Asian Buffets but Pacific Buffet worst ever tried   first clue very few cars parking lot early Sunday evening   Most dishes looked if sitting long enough appear dried selection Sushi items largely flavorless mention 'risky'   ice cream selections dessert however patrons must dip scoops themselves large freezer containers ice cream scoop sitting bucket filthy water   UGH!!!  picked few items looked least offensive left hungry   Never again  <EOR> This now closest Chinese buffet house bound try some point  past Saturday night hearing many friends tell it  parking lot packed almost changed mind yet place large seated right away  service excellent drinks constantly refilled plates taken away consistently    The Mongolian Wok part really nice fact pick your meat well your veggies  shrimp calamari pork beef chicken  put alot shrimp little bit calamari then added some rice noodles veggies  Chinese food selection nice your standard buffet fare orange chicken honey chicken beef broccoli etc    kids loved BBQ pork spareribs  crab legs decent hubby said  tried raw oysters good too  fave green bean dish asparagus dish  both cooked perfect texture flavorful  soft serve ice cream selection cakes fruits none which room for    I googled restaurant found coupon same if plan going  Oh also started charging drinks which used include price buffet  price adults 11 99 kids 4 99  <EOR> HOLY SH*T   this worst place ever to  recommended co worker boyfriend took visit lunch  passing rows food just looked nasty decided basic chow mein eggrolls steamed rice sweet sour chicken  UGH  No good  Moving Bay now realize Vegas just does many quality asian restaurants or least yet find   Anyways boyfriend told absolutely taste french fries OMG freakin sick   how mess french fries? hurried left money table bounced  soon car only two waitresses working day bang passenger window saying didn't pay  UM paid  going back forth lady telling much left another lady runs says wrong table sorry  Never again! <EOR>
