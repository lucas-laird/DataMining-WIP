deal sent back but 11 other guys seemed happy enough meal didn't want guy complained slowed everybody down   But should have    I thought posting negative review few days ago but thought would call

We'll back thanks A+ service food! <EOR> ***The food Palm Restaurant great service awful visit***  I Palm Restaurant Downtown Los Angeles did enjoy much   lunch steak frites unfortunately using really poor quality beef a New York Strip but good one    use less expensive beef dinner serve steak but still achieve reasonable lunch price but most restaurants Lucques settle lower quality instead just showcase cheaper cut hanger steak   Since Downtown LA Palm lunch did chance try signature Prime steaks   could tried them recent trip Las Vegas location The Palm located Forum Shops Caesars Palace but opted other signature items instead  lobster   jumbo lobster tail actually pretty good   lobster huge  it almost pound  and lobster meat good  fresh moist lightly sweet fairly soft   seasoning lobster also good  flavorful little bit spice but overpowering   Almost everything else good though   crab cakes soft mushy   baked clams bad   clams small very unlike rest food clams just rubbery kind bland   The Jumbo Shrimp Bruno surprisingly good though   shrimp francaise sauteed butter sauce   shrimp incredibly soft while am huge fan restaurants overboard butter richness butteriness dish really worked   The sides ranged just okay bad   really creamed spinach but definitely creaminess richness creamed spinach fans would probably like   asparagus fritti deep fried asparagus fine   The hash brown potatoes also okay but nothing really special   green beans bad   overcooked bland   Maybe someone table asked them served plain because definitely seemed missing garnishes pancetta pepper flakes pine nuts   For dessert tried warm bag doughnuts very dense   doughnuts came dipping sauces including chocolate raspberry   While did try any steak steak did look good   Some cuts looked little small but cooking meat seemed very nice   center filet saw nicely red juicy   friend said temperature steak nearly perfect but seasoning great a little bland    Prices very high   Las Vegas restaurants tend overpriced given Palm features high quality beef no surprise food very expensive   Service awful   While would say food mediocre occasionally decent range service experienced very bad   server did seem server all because really felt he did know he doing   example big table he took first two drink orders left then came back just those two drinks   looked he going continue I guess because he only two hands but stopped told put whole drink order once   Putting dinner order took forever because server just seemed disappear long stretches time   when he present he abrupt approach little off putting   He also did seem getting everything down but restaurant also very very loud   food itself came decent pace maybe service would better under different server   As mentioned restaurant quite loud   atmosphere kind old fashioned supper club   Similar LA location celebrity caricatures walls   Given Palm multiple locations throughout country would suggest heading first high quality steak big lobster   Carnevino Palazzo offers very high quality steaks sides starters much more unique delicious Palm plus restaurant more unique area    think Palm really last option given high prices just okay food fact pretty big chain   As mentioned Palm Restaurant located Forum Shops Caesars Palace   Forum Shops offer both free self valet parking  <EOR> First world problem Oh no! filet mignon tough lacks any depth flavor  Silently pouts Trying typical LA food snob but hard when you're dropping serious money expecting least 9 10 foodie experience but instead you're getting 3   We palms 7 pm check menu outside restaurant   walk into mostly empty restaurant we're escorted booth back  Along way notice lot celebrity caricatures lined walls above bar which suggests lot celebrities come eat  think should treat   For appetizer ordered fried calamaris   main entree ordered 14 oz medium rare filet mignon creamed spinach   wife ordered sauteed Chilean sea bass   First assortment cold bread comes out  know don't bread but having warm bread table first thing little off putting  least Palms pretend fresh nuking microwave   Our fried calamaris came huge plate could easily fed least four five people  hungry dove in  calamaris itself properly fried oily tomato sauce good tartness it  However few pieces kept finding fried bell peppers mixed calamaris  Since bell peppers thinly cut breaded fried looked tentacle  Maybe chef didn't feel need use clean mixing bowl when breading calamaris but resulted bell pepper booby traps laced across dish   My filet mignon creamed spinach arrive caveman craving some bloody meat  thick filet mignon seared nicely but when took bite texture wasn't very tender tougher expected dry aged beef  Additionally meat completely void any flavor which calls into question minimum 35 dry aging process  expecting stronger beefy flavor notes ageing but all tasted age   The creamed spinach okay but supremely disappointed meat lacked appetite finish sad slab meat   As chillian sea bass easily largest cut seen restaurant  added benefit chillian sea bass don't need much fish should still stands its own   However when wife took bite sad puppy dog eyes face said all  sea bass perfectly cooked but only flavor mild salt waters caught from  true don't need much fish but can't just pull sea add zero seasoning either  However partly blame disaster because broke sacred rule never order seafood steakhouse    Our server noticed dissatisfaction did refund creamed spinach calamaris  But end day still dropped more $100 uninspired dinner still left hungry hangry when left    Clearly place attempts pass itself off legit steakhouse but characatures its walls feature greatly exaggerated  <EOR> Attending National Concierge Association Conference impressed service delivery attention detail  service spectacular  cuisine stellar  if want best both  <EOR> Not going give big review here   Palm chain restaurant sort basic   higher level chain your Cheesecake Factory smaller menu better items   They mainly good steaks seafood   seafood 3 pound 4 5 maybe even 6 pound lobster   may find many places   food good quality   If think restaurants scale line down middle would say Palm around 75% range   greatest but better median range  <EOR> My new favorite restaurant Las Vegas!
