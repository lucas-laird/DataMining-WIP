I've eaten lot burgers life! the Kobe's all way down golden arches! If want good value gourmet burger then spot! innovative burgers taste great! personal fave California style burger there   just straight cheese burger all trimmings! But then again usually try almost everything once! innovative side gotta love bacon burger fresh avocado Hawaiian along Mushroom Sour Cream burger! also change burger menu if item fails etc  Now say other places offer same etc  But cook burgers order here! Med Rare! rolls serve nice change regular buns!   The sides shabby well! Can't wrong sweet potato fries little cranberry dipping sauce! beer battered fries pretty good too!   The prices very reasonable! Pretty much everything under $10 bucks sides being couple there    The service you'd expect burger joint! Just straight forward!
