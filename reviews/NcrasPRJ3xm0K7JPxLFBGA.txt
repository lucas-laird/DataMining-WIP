All around would return because quality cleanliness  But need work customer service! <EOR> This far WORST Tropical Smoothie could be  Everytime come its 30+ minute wait drive thru!!! ridiculous! always say wont back location but its only around neighborhood! store should better management because really WORST!!!!! <EOR> Okay here's thing love food hate service  ordered two smoothies only gave one!!!!!!! order wrong 95% time very frequently  only order wrong but they're rude when correct them  read menu said island green nerve! She could said nicer  wasn't big deal until she worst attitude back talk manager <EOR> Once again increased price smoothies  They did last year just week ago did again  long time regular know staff love thier food but just can't support chain anymore  price itself isn't issue greed behind it  If gave decent  reason increasing sizes amount fruit into smoothie but nope just want more money  originally paid $6 99 smoothie flat bread wrap now paying close $9  <EOR> Everything tried menu excellent! just wish closer house <EOR> The smoothies great but wait time inside through drive thru ridiculous  20 minutes waiting only smoothie  only complaint  should more 2 persons working facility  <EOR> Customer service strange  Friendly yet disorganized  Disorganized sense workmanship priority  establishment tad messy  particularly dirty but disorganized  Tables partially wiped down  kitchen organized but floor business  grab mop broom please  Thanks  mention wrap left halfway finished because register low change pivotal restocked then   Not mention establishment wasn't busy nothing skew them tiding bit   Overall Tropical Smoothie never disappoints when comes food beverages but should consider retraining better management  <EOR> I waited 20 mins served before walked out  Tropical smoothie always SLOW but ridiculous  <EOR> After reading all Yelp reviews really hesitant place    but wanting smoothie 2 am won over hesitation  Since then place the drive thru three times all three times quick easy smoothies great remember Tropical Smoothie be  workers gone across all nice provided good service  sure if just lucky past three times   but no complaints! <EOR> I love meat free chicken every time wrap tastes good perfectly seasoned! <EOR> I location 3 times  love some trop smo but sheesh service worst every time  understaffed meaning only person working usually    I wait 15 plus minutes drive thru  conservative estimate   wouldn't bad if girl working actually pretended job smiled maybe   I don't blame if she's having pull shifts herself if  case   She's usually way busy even remember give all your order  Literally wait long forget ordered until home oh snap   she forgot give us      whatever  If more car drive thru   keep driving  just saved 30 minutes   you're welcome   Also Purchased soda once noticed flat  Yes expired  Check your soda expiration dates  Good luck fellow trop smo lovers  <EOR> I used come weekly basis   Every Friday would treat myself   prices gone bit already expensive lunch begin but I'd still come in   last visit really tested patience though   understand lunch hour rush gets busy but first put order quite literally last full meal  seeing bunch people came did entire meal leave asked lady front check smoothie which she confidently replied should right    When she rushed into back thought maybe she's gone check it   Nope   She comes back register help bunch other people order   food too!  Finally ask again status she says take care finally starts making smoothie   overwhelming but seriously  some pretty horrible customer service   If you're gonna spend kind money $13 Vegas practically into any type all you can eat lunch buffet decent meal might well where they'll recognize customer  standing around 20 minutes waiting food   agree other posts severely understaffed!  Also star lack observation poor customer service! <EOR> The wait time ALWAYS ridiculously long even if just line  really don't think should sit drive thru window 15 minutes smoothie  <EOR> Both smoothies taste bland free fruit   MORE ICY SLUSH SONIC!!! Terrible!  Highly disappointed   especially Acai Berry Blast  even fruit seeds strawberries etc  wonder if even fresh fruit all as made back !!! <EOR> This being few smoothie places any kind open 24 hours extremely convenient aside live east side close too  Everything great you'd expect decent business love but flaw wait time  Unfortunately poor workers graveyard long line cars 2 am  wait 15 minutes smoothie times but please don't blame workers time themselves doing best  very patient understanding person always fine situations just warn  others may want deal wait time expect here  <EOR> Im sure made drink but tastes horrible tampered with <EOR> I've gone through drive thru few times now  order always right normally pretty quick  <EOR> Most visits location leave pleased hunger satiated which why return  However early morning those times  profoundly disappointed service received 2 40am morning Monday April 24th  way home work stopped done many times over  stocky man mid 30's provided mediocre service fell short requests  First off smoothie icy sweet normally is and know because least 50 times   also requested extra pesto Chicken Pesto melt  only did he short pesto melt comes but he charged extra pesto barely put any pesto into extra container  even ordered Chipotle Chicken Club same way he provided same amout extra sauce   or lack of  I'd give man benefit doubt assume he's new because never seen before but hate feeling displeasure  just deplore all wary individual's service surprised if your expectations met  <EOR> Super slow service  took ten minutes take order no front me   45 minutes later received smoothie ordered   Staff super friendly but seemingly disorganized  <EOR> I love TroSmo love location open 24hrs  wide selection healthy decadent smoothies greens fruits chocolate peanut butter etc food options decent too  breakfast menu all day breakfast nut craves eggs bacon odd times appreciate that  quality smoothies also far exceeds competition   I've Tropical Smoothie locations across valley experienced same general wait time all them  seldom quick but worth wait  No shame most items fresh  But location takes wait whole new level  painstakingly slow  Something definitely wrong staffing darn shame  If even slightest rush avoid all costs especially drive thru! <EOR> Annoying!  considered all day why takes 30 minutes smoothie?   am annoyed  just think if added more person would improve customer experience   Whoever owns location should someone know location  could actually double triple income if managed well   Two smoothies hour would pay wages extra person but create opportunities way more revenue   am probably spending much time but pisses off  Why would waste money keeping place open if going run well   only smoothie place area right across street several county state offices   busy street next two other fast food places   together  Seriously bring people other stores   Just extra body less $60 day would absolutely improve situation   Now think many other corners being cut   When several locations rated badly would think would fix it  Ask other locations doing perform  If cannot quality people then pay more  30 minutes two smoothies!!!!   Come on!!! am officially angry 11 hours   Dang!!! <EOR> Unfriendly staff   No soap bathroom   No peanut butter smoothie wanted order   Ones ordered   not good   Very icy   First last time! <EOR> I Tropical Smoothie Cafe if work anywhere near family court MUST excited am place opened!!
