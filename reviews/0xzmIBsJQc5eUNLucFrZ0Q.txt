The food mediocre its sad know knew much food main entree sitting front would cost just run Whole Foods cooked myself  paid silly amounts it   Won't going back but experience won't keep trying some other Wynn Encore restaurants  <EOR> FABULOUS dinner!  basil pesto comes flatbread perfect start   husband shared calamari which perenially favorite appetizers but particularly flavorful accompanying sauce zippy without being overwhelming   ordered goat cheese salad which plenty fresh corn avocado while husband caesar salad   entrees sea scallops very good he linguine clams which he added some shrimp     It good thing reservations because even Tuesday night place packed   service excellent very attentive without being overbearing   Highly recommend! <EOR> Food decent  started Cesar salad pretty mediocre certainly traditional classic take  Linguine clam sauce good  many Vegas restaurants  won over 4 oz pour some standard pinot grigio 12 13 bucks  Service friendly attentive  but another pretty forgettable Vegas food experience  lots restaurants lots big names  but lot substance soul  <EOR> Been 3 4 times let down  Prices kind high but Vegas Wynn   Can't wrong specials filet medallions excellent love 4 cheese macaroni side  tiramisu always awesome  <EOR> During stay Las Vegas grabbed late dinner boyfriend completely blown away great dining experience and comparable low bill was      After long day drinking trying avoid cocktails all together but talked into splitting glass sangria   miss this!

Good food watching still intoxicated post clubbing crowd highly entertaining   We really enjoyed eggs sausage quatro formaggio pizza pesto   come back just fabulous pizza!    Service bit off   seated bar all tables full   bartender familiar menu computer system where he usually worked Wynn   He VERY nice but seems odd manager could take couple minutes familiarize dining options!    Highly recommend back!! <EOR> Wynn Encore Appetizer Crawl Part 4  Our fourth stop night actually Switch but menu didn't sound appealing  Before left saw walls ceilings change  Wow talk gimmicky underwhelming  $40 million doesn't much used guess  Anyway headed Stratta next bite   Despite being 3 4 empty tables Stratta lounge wait  When finally sat table remained empty whole time  wtf? guess making people wait no reason?  Their Late Night menu only food option  believe same stuff Lunch menu  order Warm goat cheese salad $11 underwhelming bland boring  Meatball sandwich $16 didn't try any but friend devoured pretty quickly Braised short rib panino $15 tasty sandwich  Tender meat glazed onions plenty cheese  big sammie should 15 bucks but still over priced   The service lackluster price pay whole experience food all underwhelming  Although does some good people watching Saturday night  <EOR> Bar Review           I didn't realize restaurant until noticed lot's people showing 6pm very nice clothes  stopped catch Dodger game because Cabana Bar wasn't showing Wack! swim gear little embarrassing first being only ones under dressed but few drinks didn't matter  LOL few Stellas $7 then bartender introduced new favorite drink world Kiroyale Oh man good!!!!!!!

Probably not  night XS? Good chance  <EOR> We stopped clubbing pick some pizza because friends RAVED truffle pizza  ordered 3 truffle pizzas which ready only 15 minutes let tell slot machines help wait time much less painful   Unfortunately pizza just okay me  Granted exactly piping hot since walk back Palazzo but real kicker size  pizza boxes probably medium size but when opened box each pizza probably size sheet paper! $18 each!! Look flavor great but almost $5 4 slice super thin pizza kinda ridiculous  friends also surprised said pizza used bigger  know  I might back  pizza good but more appetizer snack y deal meal especially shared one!   <EOR> Going Stratta time definitely made terrible experience first time came   Most due high expectations shitty waiter   Stopped Taste Wynn experience  Appetizer entree dessert 39 bucks person   deal anywhere but especially Wynn!    Ordered decently priced bottle wine enjoyed some bread cheesy bread crunchies pesto dipping sauce  Started Panzanella Salad bad  better at Panzanella Sherman Oaks actually but fine   Husband thought Caesar Salad decent well  dinner Bucatini Amatriciana Papparadelle Bolognese  bucatini much better first time it  tasted made cream though rather using good cheese  tad bit disappointing  wasnt huge fan Papparadelle but say pasta did taste freshly made kudos that   Dessert chocolate toffee cake tiramisu   full really enjoy them but tastes nice  particularly thought chocolate toffee cake yummy very rich   What most impressive think such small price received full portions same quality service if bill hundreds more  They've earned business again! <EOR> You 5 stars if fall love your pesto   OH EM GEE!!  The ambiance great!  service prompt efficient extra friendly   food yummy I lasagna special which same listed menu   not sure exactly different   but GOOD!    must said again   the pesto AMAZING   and bread came good too   party also ordered pitcher Black Bull which thoroughly enjoyed!

Perfectly cooked tasty   pizza covered mushroom pate sorts all right but didn't really taste any truffle oil   pasta terrible   sure decided very simple tomato sauce should flavored only buttload marjoram but pretty bad decision   likes marjoram much?? Certainly nor dining companions   pretty small portion     thankfully hate wasting food     $20     The omnivore group Caesar salad pasta meatballs he quite enjoyed apparently spared marjoram dish    also some pretty good wines glass      The service great even though quite packed no complaints there!

However pasta al dente liking  shouldve stayed water couple more minutes   Chocolate toffee cake really good!! super thick rich just desserts    Tiramisu meh  better tiramisu  light sweet but really lacked rum flavor desired  I'd chocolate toffee cake instead try gelato sorbet instead  <EOR> We came Restaurant week   originally plans visit totally different restaurants but decided last weekend wasn't going partake restaurant week much because trying pay tuition school  But happened score some tickets Le Reve last night decided check restaurant week offerings Wynn Encore show   sad see only dinner offering hotel would loved taste others   didn't huge expectations but pleasantly surprised enjoyed meal   most food eaten awhile felt more full when buffet felt $50 good bargain   We ordered cocktails usual Ketel Martini brought blue cheese olives yum   husband prickly pear margarita which delicious   Both very overpriced but mixed perfectly   They brought bread basket INSANE cheese flatbread couldn't stop eating   Instead butter olive oil balsamic bread some homemade pesto   husband both pesto sauce little herby tasting us   However pesto marvelous literally inhaled it   Gave whole new appreciation pesto sauce want try start making home   For appetizers pepperoni pizza warm goat cheese salad   Both huge portions could only eaten two dishes could done meal   pizza done more italian american style thin doesn't look anything special when it   But flavors very good ingredients quality   salad refreshing tasty loved flavors roasted mushrooms corn together creamy avocado goat cheese   For main course husband braised short rib barolo wine glazed shallot port wine seared sea scallops   short rib completely fork tender moist delicious   sauce very complex deep flavorful   don't eat lot short ribs because fatty rich but favorite   scallops seared perfectly first thing thought when saw them Gordon Ramsay would pleased served Hell's Kitchen   scallops seasoned fairly aggressively salt pepper which little overwhelming first but when paired vegetables zucchini tomatoes delicious   At point both full looking forward desert   never ever order desert but because restaurant week desert   husband lemon meringue slice vanilla sauce raspberries bombolini   lemon slice cool refreshing flavorful   raspberries majorly fresh   bombolini over top literally uncomfortable rest night   piping hot amoretti ricotta beignets nutella running them   Oh lord!  good   took long serving desert couldn't understand why until made them fresh me!  nutella eating molten lava whole thing tasted good homemade cream dip them in   A very good heavy meal definitely worth restaurant week price   don't know if would again regular meal prices pretty high   But very satisfied  <EOR> One favorite restaurants Las Vegas!  love when Corsa because pappardelle cooked lobster broth little disappointed when became Stratta took off menu but made toffee crunch chocolate cake!  still lobster shrimp pasta  good linguine clams always good too!  service great super fast but still relaxing rushed! <EOR> Strike out! Awful late night menu terrible pizza chicken breast looked just come mcdonalds  $100 waste! <EOR> This place golden gets automatic point being open super late night   going late being super hungry back Encore hotel stumbled down look food   Stratta looked better sandwich place across strolled in   We didn't wait table which awesome   ambiance nice imagine place being great place dinner     We ordered following Fried calamari something wrong place if wrong 'Corsa' salad warm goat cheese the only thing didn't lick plate!!! Jeez good   tossed just right I'd never those things salad   warm goat cheese   sauteed mushrooms French fries super thin yummy  I am happy stumbled upon place late night   def come back try other dishes   WYNN amazing!!  Nothing bad there! <EOR> I should give 2 5 stars beginning pesto bread end dessert terrific   came between adequate best   Given prices expected better quality Olive Garden but only marginally better     I fried calamari scallop main course wife pizza app bucatini main course   calamari heavily breaded rubbery frozen food service calamari frozen bad you'd Safeway   couldn't fresh   scallops tasty but over salted very small very large sea scallops used quality restaurants   My wife's pizza really good thin crispy crust very nicely done   bucatini peppery tasted sauce jar   The highlight dessert tiramisu toffee chocolate cake great!  probably bought do anything house? but really good!  So if back guess would pizza dessert   Otherwise I'd save your money Wynn Buffet Red8 Il Mulino if want Italian  <EOR> this great place business lunch    twice during time vegas popular enough people watch but quiet enough conduct business   try corsa salad roasted shrimp penne! <EOR> Ever since first visit Stratta earlier summer back every time  including past Halloween weekend  thought downgrading stars 4 because A hostess told dressed Santa could show midriff restaurant  She then proceeded stare down little bit while Lil Red Ridin Hood friend tied hood around waist  done b*tch now seat us   B restaurant less packed then previous times but service still slow   C ordered TWO bosco pizzas 1 BOMBOLINI  Bombolini   'Warm Amoretti Ricotta beignets filled nutella' [I'll back later] brought 2 orders Bombolini charged it  probably would returned except scarfed them down because    D served Bombolini before rest food came  Dessert first? Odd   However pizza bombolini fries all amazingly good   Perhaps just addicted mushrooms truffle oil nutella? hostess spread nutella all over ugly hater face I'd still eat it  Bombolini  I'm still thinking it  came before 2 am really know am talking now  think long order right food place place always worth visit  food baby once again happy satisfied  try visiting place next time naked  <EOR> Stratta know you're Wynn right?  went large party only ones could accomodate    Food overall OK but wasn't worth it   clam appetizer tasted great Steak solid but expensive Black Bass looked better tasted Pastas looked tasted microwaved packaged tossed bowl Pork Chop incredibly salty both orders sent back  Go somewhere else Wynn Encore dining usually much better this  <EOR> What the    *%$!!!  The Bosco pizza freakin' ridiculous   white truffle oil put over edge   Just when thought pizza couldn't any better found could  pizza good came back very next night Bosco again!  seriously crack BEST crack there! dessert Tiramisu Bambolini small donuts filled nutella icing top already VERY satisfying experience    Amazing food wonderful service open super late great ambiance!  Seattle needs Stratta   seriously  <EOR> this review strictly LOBSTER FRA DIA VOLO PASTA   I've coming 5 years just pasta  Yeah costs 50 bucks but dont care  Its best thing menu   I know other things meat ball spaghetti some other things but LOBSTER FRA DIA VOLO truly best seafood pasta ever!  It slightly spicy     put more red peppers even more spicy! yum  It comes big nugs lobster big rock shrimp   stratta pretty casual dining open late if 24 hours    i stroll nice buzz leaving XS     this vegas version dennys  haha    yeah guess fancy <EOR> I very good feeling lot Stratta's business comes fact open till wee hours night Wynn hotel guests return night debauchery its insanely convenient place refuel  convenience give place 14 stars but quality actual food just nothing special  Now staying Wynn pretty much guarantee end eating Stratta many many more times  suppose its possible execution regular dinner menu much better but 'm  sure  However if looking some late night eats Stratta likely your only convenient options just stick basics pizza pasta    you'll appreciate extra carbs next morning  <EOR> Refreshingly AWESOME service!  I'll mention ate right horrible experience La Cave also Wynn hotel  happy but little hurry eat decent meal   I say really didn't care salad ordered but service attention detail above beyond    My server's name Joe great attentive friendly service  chef told pretty new really way care patrons  He around every table greeted them thanked them dining restaurant asked food  ate alone same attention groups families dining there   Hostess bussers water service PERFECT!  It nice treated respectfully impeccable service  Stratta does right! beautiful spot romantic meal fun swanky dinner drinks friends  would come back again just service made all difference  <EOR> Ok dont even know where begin     ok know   BOSCO!!!! best thing ever eaten  Normally pizza person but Bosco you've changed mind  Coupled cheese bread mac cheese officially best carbo loading experience life  Yum yum yum  Stratta see asap! <EOR> I don't understand why place such low rating !! tried place Monday week craving ever since  bf steak eggs 2 thumbs fetuccini alfredo also 2 thumbs shared black truffle french fries those insanely delicious!!!! few places strip open late dinner   am super glad chose it! <EOR> The idea nice Italian dinner before night began sounded great  Unfortunately place disappointment  appetizers looked delicious buratta salads   entrees left awkward silence  had  However appreared jam late night    maybe if really really drunk drugs ordered french fries can fuck up? place would tight  Till then goodie  <EOR> Great for late night grub club place sit chill coz your shoes killing dancing 4 5inch heels all night watching all drunk people pass through Wynn casino good times decent food love desserts breakfast food 3am    MMM eggs sausages <EOR> Went dinner while wedding party enjoyed Bachelor Bachelorette dinner drinks  much anticipation must admit little disappointed overall experience   We started appetizers Clams Casino Beef Carpacchio Carol  clams just average while carpacchio excellent  Entrees consisted stuffed Pork chop which very good Salmon Carol which just okay  also ordered side fries sure why since both meals came potatoes rice  fries however excellent   Our dinner accompanied bottle Clos Pegas which excellent   All all nice experience but overwhelming  Prices little high portions felt dining area way loud maybe just getting old   Definitely give another try future  <EOR>
