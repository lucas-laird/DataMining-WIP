Anyone?  don't think staff Baja Fresh have     The staff making burrito lady ahead accidentally dropped some ingredients floor   staff quickly grabbed broom everyone came help remove rubber mats off floor while she sweeps   Ok far yes?  Well gross   After sweeping rubber floor mats put back into place did see any staff wash hands replaced gloves used handle food earlier rubber floor mats   Ok here's kicker     The staff cooking beef inside said other staff worry it   She'd only if someone saw it   what?  wash your hands replace them white gloves  used handle food serve people?  Oh ok then     check please!  That's just McNasty! <EOR> This Baja Fresh     GOOD      Only whole beans 5 30 pm????  Airport restaraunts usually sub par but BLAH  <EOR> it good  service quick  lady making food very efficient  even writing anything down  Baja special whatever was  decent  wished salsa bar though  salsa bars  food didn't give any food poisoning  always plus  known beforehand flight going cancel may just held eating here  but time good  oh way lazy feet hurt much walk over popeyes  <EOR> Passed through airport just time while breakfast still being served   Favorite Breakfast Burrito Bare style no tortilla wrap   Lots eggs choice meat some awesome bacon whatever else top  Love black beans Pico hot salsa even some mild sweet onion  Delicious  <EOR> I walked Baja Fresh Express Terminal D 7am Monday morning  clean dude behind counter  Being daring eater grunt order Breakfast burrito no meat  He says want papas like menu want eggs pico de gallo beans cheese? all 'yeah whatever just said want second one  Homeboy totally hooked up   tortilla huge thing triple wrapped  couple hours later floating home over clouds burrito coma  Damn place absolutely clutch  <EOR> Worked me! Baja Fresh nice quick burrito made your way while waiting flight  real problem however really no where sit down enjoy meal  All seating saw general area specific establishments attached to  some standing tables nearby but come  very close completely travel friendly very far away  LAS needs change this! <EOR> When Las Vegas two weeks ago way home caught early Hawaiian Airlines flight   Rushing hotel returning rental car did anytime eat anything wee morning hours          Lucky McCarran Airport's new Terminal 3 whole bunch places eat shop          they even slot machines some last minute gambling! Lol!!!  After checking Hawaiian Airlines passing TSA screening area catching monorail Terminal 3         it time sit down relax something eat before board flight home   After walking around Terminal 3 found place called Baja Fresh Express Mexican Grill  good place could grab something quick          food edible but course nothing would restaurant  But convenience factor spot on!  Ordered myself two Breakfast Burrito's two soda's             aaaah breakfast Champions!!!! All just under $20 bucks  bad airport food        as know prices little higher airport due convenience factor probably vendor's high rent taxes   The food      well breakfast burrito quite BIG loaded eggs potatoes type meat  ended taking bacon meat  Everything breakfast burrito okay exception bacon which kinda soggy rubbery  If cooked bacon crisp then loaded burrito sure would tasted little better      but expect airport food????  It's all convenience folks! <EOR> Sad face paid guac didn't put in  Also food great  compare Moes Chipotle say falling in between but closer Moes style food  <EOR> Preface airport  probably most ridiculous restaurant experiences ever try generally optimistic  five people behind counter preparing subway style  Ordering confusing guy taking orders next guy training just didn't know english all cause next guy trying run whole operation also explain spanish instructions everything  some fumbling confusion  presumable manager just standing behind them never said word didn't lift finger  Workers obviously stressed people line frustrated  Food mediocre but still seemed best option considering alternatives  <EOR> The food very bland overpriced  Don't eat here! 3 7 12 <EOR> Who runs bacon while serving breakfast? absolutely no sense urgency while serving guest  told would take 10 minutes cook eggs breakfast burritos seriously?? Good thing many other choices eat  <EOR>
