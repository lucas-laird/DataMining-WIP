ORIGINAL REVIEW Service somewhat confused slow but six buck steak eggs graveyard deal more made it   I arrived Tuscany Suites Marilyn's Coffee Shop around 4 40am then waited almost ten minutes register staring dining venue devoid any customers staff  Then ended going into kitchen find someone  told Marilyn's actually next door  wasn't exactly true  What's next door property's 24 hour Pub365 VP bar and restaurant    I told Pub Marilyn's graveyard shift shuttered due monthly deep clean kitchen  am buying either  telling there's separate kitchen pub shares wall coffee shop? why lights coffee shop no Closed sign rope off? bet? staff just wanted vacant coffee shop area without getting caught     save themselves some work keeping morning shift set place since VP Bar next door open all night no matter   Anyway just drink brought Pub365 table asked move BACK Marilyn's because the deep clean done 5am  Now am wondering if even going graveyard deal! When new booth Marilyn's there's some confusion whether order even taken  cleared     cleared graveyard deal going cash in  Then took well over 20 minutes food arrive  Even though only two other table tops working   Any there's service  Now food  $6 steggs deal cut meat pretty durn good  Now know isn't going Golden Steer Steve Wynn's SW Steakhouse going in  But price pretty nice cut steak  certainly seen far worse graveyard meat     buck two three more  eggs done well hash browns could bit more crispy  But again six smackers deal real bargain  plates heading other table tops looked pretty durn tempting well   And wait comped beverage consideration seating fiasco  Thanks dude!  OK mid market coffee shop going five stars  dish additional one star ding service seating confusion food quality gratis beverage balanced but ambient music  'Ambient' probably right word much word 'blaring ' blaring mostly 1970s hard grinding metal rock  During 5 30am dining experience enchanted no uncertain decibels 'Rock Roll Hoochie Koo' Rick Derringer 1973 'Stay Me' Rod Stewart 1971 'Black Magic Woman' Santana 1970 Janis Joplin wailing out 'Me Bobby McGee' 1970   am presuming management concluded ambiance required properly incentivize its target slot players of age drop coin  totally that business is business  But let's tamp down bit restaurant 5 30am OK?   Forgiving service seating samba     rowdy head banger music     3am 5am spot actually pretty decent graveyard deal option sure  I'd would much rather eaten Marilyn's dished would gotten Blueberry Hill twice price  Peppermill would easily dropped twenty  while Peppermill certainly great spot middle of the night people watching over the top retina numbing décor seems quality product Peppermill slipped recent years least when compared its price point   CONCLUSIONS Tuscany already offers nicely appointed vintage Vegas vibe lounge  Now discovered its coffee shop  if am looking again time frame     am looking price point     am general area likely swing through Marilyn's again    Especially if am trolling middle morning     still lookin' blue jean baby queen  Prettiest girl ever seen  See shake movie screen  Rock on  <EOR> I love place always come healthy section menu food always good consistent thank nice day  <EOR> Extremely good breakfast  food plentiful portions  wifes multigrain pancake delicious words very reasonably priced     Thoroughly great experience  <EOR> This second time disappointed  literally took 30 minute take drink order another 20 minutes receive another 20 minutes take orders btw 8 99 steak eggs 6a 11a only!   didn't even bring everything ordered until pretty much beg it   Overall worst service ever experienced Vegas servers no remorse but then again why should they  2 stars because food good give but cost know? <EOR> It Monday morning staying Hard Rock right around corner Steak Eggs girlfriend believe omlette    We paid same orange juice did meals haha pretty good  Obviously 5 stars but 0 wait good deals tasty breakfast night going out  <EOR> We came Friday night going clubbing strip around 2 30am  some reason PACKED  think when normally Saturday nights bad maybe people don't late night steak eggs Saturday but definitely Friday night!

Easy game  back real soon  <EOR> I've 3 times but seems each time less memorable previous visit   good deal crab but opinion many options Vegas surpass Marilyn's Cafe   Pros *  There's AYCE crab feast $15 98 per person Friday nights   *  AYCE option comes 2 side dishes    *  Free refills drinks    *  Service pretty good   manager restaurant even came by    *  Quality crab itself mediocre  Cons *  Outdated ambiance   *  No refills your sides   *  Slow service   *  Raised price AYCE option previously $12 99 *  cold throughout restaurant   Overall Since last time seems boosted price bit AYCE   main thing Marilyn's Cafe going them crab killer price   Since bit more expensive now in comparison before other places throughout valley offer AYCE little more money way better quality though more your money    also doesn't help extremely chilly inside restaurant   made meal less enjoyable   live Northwest side town always pain Tuscany Suites home especially Friday night    think coming AYCE crab anytime soon   Perhaps another night regular menu but yet try that   definitely update review once though   reading other reviews seems some other good deals worth checking such Steak Egss $3 99    unless changed price too?

Hubby ordered biscuits gravy eggs benedict 8 99 plain nasty  Canadian bacon rancid oil taste yuck hollandaise sauce wasn't good either  prefer hubby's version yum! mention coffee strong  Slow service waitress showed no care either   I guess pay but if really want cheap eats breakfast Vegas I'd Ellis Island  <EOR> Don't let Denny's like decor fool place bombbbb diggity   $5 dollar steak eggs SAY WHAT?!  really advertised just order only available 12am 5am  stay stay don't miss super awesome deal     You know say early bird gets worm!

Smoke slot machine area infiltrates cafe which adjacent open casino floor   Also walk through smoky area even reach restaurant  No thanks  <EOR> I'll start food  supreme omelette which good very large  Coffee also surprisingly good  overall quality price bad choice    Now experience staff  waitress great! Very attentive friendly  However experience manager duty did good impression  waiting seated waiter walks hostess asks question Spanish  hostess responds Spanish then manager walks up  She then proceeds say English only please   can't understand matters  seated then hear manager continue telling waiter now if your customer speaks Spanish  fine other want everyone speak English   First all Vegas hear tons different languages few awesome many people all over world descend work pleasure true melting pot  part Vegas much fun  Second wasn't being responded Spanish entire conversation hostess English she speaking English manager just butted way conversation made assumptions  don't understand why private conversation can't take place between two co workers language want  don't need know they're talking doubt they're trying hide they're saying guests ton people speak Spanish  Lastly if fair skinned Spanish speaker initiated conversation hostess before she arrived? Isn't kind dumb assertion speak English? really didn't appreciate she spoke hard working staff    So reason unfortunately 3 stars  <EOR> Best cafe breakfast meal Vegas date  breakfast croissant side grits delicious! probably back today  eaten before but long time  ended default because Ellis Island 45 minute wait weren't remembered place decided come here  waitress sweet however wait food quite bit longer expected  When food finally arrived literally shouted Hallelujah !! waitress just cracked laughing!

Mind 5 which informed waiter gave butter but she still only gave butter myself  She advised others wait waiter  When John finally made way table 1st time since bringing food asked where he butter crab? He didn't offer apology but instead poor excuse busy tonight  He refused take old cold Mac n cheese stating saw guys eat some already  Well course!  know tastes garbage! He didn't bring 2nd serving all eat crab legs until 40 minutes later! became desperate service asking bus boys please water more crab butter etc  course  job scope unfortunately stuck John's extremely poor service  asked manager advised isn't available  end if all waited additional 30 minutes bring check  bill $138 paid then ventured into Casino gamble usually do  surprise John waiter came into casino ask no tip service? replied don't tip non service  1st time didn't leave tip eat least 4 times week!
