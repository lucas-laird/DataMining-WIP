The service wasnt good    Good place but didnt people  working there   first time its gonna last one <EOR> The servers quite rude  asked if salmon because someone else having told menu could order it    Okay guess just take business somewhere else? would come back smoke infested restaurant  <EOR> The worst food ever  Bosnian Serbian food nothing people serve  If even think going might well wall into Walmart buy yourself tv dinner <EOR> Perfect grill pastas good service friendly atmosphere  5+ Fettuccini Alfredo delicious beef links also  Prices very affordable cheaper most restaurants area  <EOR> Thank much cafe Derbi dj Maia perfect night amazing food good music Mediterranean experience!!! <EOR> Do Balkan food Cevapcici Meat Plate Ajvar ?  This great real balkan restaurant town    The large meat plate price $13 99 very good deal  <EOR> I wasn't happy pizza no red sauce very greasy also 2 liter flat  <EOR> Ordered food off grubhub around 1215 am  20 mins later call telling dont pizzas late  lady phone said she new couldn't answer why took long them deny order  Why place grubhub when wont fulfill orders midnight? Dont waste your time  <EOR> A friend brought randomly stopped few drinks   It very interesting environment  On weekends music foggy club smoke  Okay don't much memory place but interesting crowd all gotta say  <EOR> Great food service if would try Balkan food place Vegas!! <EOR> They take orders over phone but deliveries which doesn't any sense ever lady answered phone rude mention she want date menu telling don't menus   She says only received orders online ask website but she couldn't give told look menu which didn't which even more annoying <EOR> Cafe Derbi favorite Serbian place eat drink socialize friends  menu big selection really good food always tastes fresh  place also great socialize enjoy great European music during weekends  Highly recommend place anyone looking enjoy Eastern European food music all around good time   <EOR> Pretty good!

Then when called inform management rude said would only offer credit chicken doing favor  She didn't even sound surprised situation! NEVER eat again sure tell everyone careful uncooked food   Gross <EOR> Well all started late summer night when friend trying some quality pizza reasonable price  While searched nearby pizzerias Cafe Derbi came up  ordered small pepperoni pizza slice new york cheesecake  delivery man came 45 minutes late nearly hit smoke infested Mercedes  took food inside tried manage finish pizza would honestly find better pizza hut  dove into cheesecake all could think tasted flan Cafe Rio cardboard slice cake  NEVER ordering again! <EOR> I few different times  Fine dining? NOT! would sitting down place where all smoke while eat? waitress takes half hour just come greet upon arrival self seating add she doesn't even smile when she finally gets your table  First time some food didn't feel good next day second time just drank juice coffee cuz scared eat again  Third time sat outside glass wine waited hour half dang bill then decided better ask check myself  <EOR> As summer's coming Vegas Cafe Derbi great place chat coffee course favorite Nutella crepes! I remember going 2 3 years ago before became vegetarian food almost good back Romania dish some cheese wrapped pork French Fries   was absolutely fantastic ! tonight actually pleased see its still menu recommended friends next visit  Tonight just night wine crepes something always come back  As much would give place 5 stars just can't ! because waitress bartender wasn't fast would liked but because smoke    I'm sure if would smoker wouldn't bother me   but thing don't smoke hate cigarette smoke   and people would eat drink while smoking no regards towards other guests     I'm grateful nice weather nice size terrace allowing friends enjoy evening outside almost smoke free! <EOR> WHAT COOL LITTLE HIDDEN GEM PLACE!!  love first site bar restaurant  decorated perfectly outdoor seating area rivals anywhere Las Vegas  Curious?
