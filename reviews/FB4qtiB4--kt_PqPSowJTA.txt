Decor very nice  wide open huge bar corner  seated right away    When sat down pleasantly surprised menu selection  reminded very popular Goyemon  husband asked if could sear lot fish since pregnant shouldn't eating raw  waiter said course! game changer! never restaurant accommodating  Basically would prepare 2 3 dish raw sear bit me  Isn't great?!  Not only selection great but quality rolls nigiri delicious! rice tiny pieces small  great AYCE room try lot other things  fish super fresh well    I also need commend service  ordered food came within 5 10 mins think!
