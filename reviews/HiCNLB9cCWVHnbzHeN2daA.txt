He holding pizza angle because when opened greasy bottomed box pizza actually discombobulated pull slices off each other   pizza cold trying pull grilled cheese apart   meats burnt meatballs just chunks beef little balls thinly sliced actual meatballs   sauce flavorless only taste truly resonated throughout burnt cornmeal used keep dough sticking oven   If want good pizza stay far far away place  <EOR> A pretty good Pizza live near North Cheyenne location but think South Eastern store better  Try them both decide yourself <EOR>
