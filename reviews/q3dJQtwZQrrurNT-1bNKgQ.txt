First flag someone down drink order then later someone else waitress FINALLY take food order  busser new own actually twice bar parents new beverage because waitress lost again    Two four food dishes INCORRECT  When attempted let know mistakes she argued saying items didnt come thought did  Since STILL MENU pointed right  she says mom she must grabbed wrong plate but tells bf oh don't serve mashed potatoes $40 steak anymore cause no likes them   Ummm something she failed mention when he placed order also menu said which proved again SINCE MENU STILL   She leaves mothers dish replace incorrect pasta roasted potatoes brings back same plate pasta still half spoonful side should originally been!!???    Let also forget mention stacked dishes edge crumb filled table neither busser ever picked yet stacked room dinner  Let also point mother father SHARED two butter knifes meals    Our waitress FINALLY checked sitting nothing front quite some time everything stacked edge table asked if wanted dessert which declined  sure why took long drop bill but when finally started keeping track two full songs piano player cycled thru    again started keeping track    When left almost took picture table stacked dishes MENU couple empty bread plates butter container when didn't even bread since BEFORE placed food order  So called today speak manager        immediately let know unhappy calling let know experience let them rectify instead blasting all over fb yelp which she thankful then asked hold moment    Toni the GM put phone down conversation someone else another phone   that could hear every word of!!!!!!

ALWAYS talk over them if want eat 'famous chef' dinner interesting fun always delicious dinner favorite italian place           When friends want famous chef dinner conversation continues choose many      doesn't always turn well all locals know    But always promise myself next time Capo's!      THEN those chose Capo's first time ALWAYS rave rave rave experience food ALWAYS!   always ask if think they've made right decision all tell should given them choice     I yet happen once famous chef restaurant experience     Wait except once mom dad visited Wolfgang Puck  Thanksgiving Day meal    mom loved but feeling she likes say Wolfgang Puck too   Also no 'rave rave rave' just nod saying better expected  Dad Italian raved raved raved Capo's mom tells friends oh take little secret Italian place tommy gun right wall    rofl <EOR> Very cool place  When walk looked speakeasy 20s  old telephone right actually door leads into restaurant  ambiance amazing  Very dim lighting dim give flashlights read menu! live singer reminded Sinatra  left happy full wanting back! <EOR> My wife anniversary because heard unique mob themed Italian restaurant  When first walk you're small room where need ring buzzer in  host opens opens small hatch see then opens hidden door behind pay phone let in  thought pretty neat because gave real speakeasy feel it    You walk through hidden door you'r restaurant  lights kept very dim which adds mystic place  allowing eyes adjust you'll see old mob photos wall chefs cooking open kitchen next bar    The level cheese elevated whole new level when saw music coming gentleman singing karaoke set up  can't up  He appeared regular attraction because all staff knew him  point CD started skipping while he singing Quando Quando Quando   told wife he must singing remix version! He started song over  only assume because he didn't want artistic integrity compromised  amused many levels    hires karaoke singer entertainment? more importantly    uses CD's anymore???  Once seated table staff seemed very responsive courteous  did good job keeping glasses full water clearing plates emptied them  quality food left lot desired  marinara sauce wife's pasta cold picatta sauce just so so  real laugher came side risotto  Rather taking time needed properly using arborio rice slow cooking steamed long grain white rice added some cheese mushrooms called risotto     If you're looking good Italian food I'd rate place somewhere below Sbarro's  If you're looking novelty restaurant so so mob theme then place you!

OK part atmosphere again seems little bit overcooked palate  money but if would take stuff down notch  suppose tourist effect who'll home saying joint 'authentic vintage Vegas ' something that   But actual dining spaces very MidCentury gourmet room lush easily overlook all other   I Italian house salad included 14 ounce no bone ribeye mixed veggies mashed potatoes  pretty durn good meal  salad dressing seasoned oh so well ribeye also charcoaled quite well juicy  $40 plate btw  took pass 24 ounce porterhouse 'special' $60  Those prices wee bit higher would marry overall experience but hardly enough difference call them deal breaker   There's Tuesday 2 fer $20 off deal if pony couple cocktails  am basically immune alcohol consumption didn't look cocktail prices     can't tell if $20 already buried them  there's also Sinatra brunch Sundays 11am until 2pm  Let's just hope Sinatra don't mean endless shots Jack Daniels chased bowl olives!  I liked place clearly core its décor its respectable food  think keep on the radar primarily solid atmosphere option during evening lady companion  <EOR> So   it's almost month since most recent visit anger finally starting subside long enough update past review place  I should also note eaten Capo's both locations many times since first review  become place take town guests celebrate birthdays basically favorites just because nights   also recommended restaurant everyone encounter looking great experience great meal  Well now past   When Valentines Day started approach year Capos front runner night out  made reservations two weeks advance then week before called add another couple guest count  all excited looking forward it!!

The only con prices  Even 2 1 entree locals ended shelling over $70 two us    Although food service great am thrilled price point enough rush back  see prices being justified because everything made fresh portions fair but Italian food ingridients generally don't warrant kind price unless adding seafood etc  <EOR> It difficult give restaurant stars because important things meal food atmosphere service above average   Unfortunately surprises bill end meal put damper whole experience   menu stated $5 charge splitting   understood but when food came table split asked another plate split myself   thought  that's good won't charged $5 now   only charged split charged $3 more $8 because recently raised price but didn't update menu?    top ordered spaghetti Santucci which good but thought meatballs included choices dish   added another $5 meatballs too   waiter manager when complained   He just apologized did waiter said management decision     So  I can't recommend restaurant due billing practices  <EOR> Poor response time door  waitress did great but understaffed  food less average bland  environment very sexy casual  bad food wasn't better because venue real potential  <EOR> Fantastico!!!!

In addition regarding uneventful night should point did contact Manager  spoke Dominic sp?   He very kind apologetic  He said next time we're town let know  He'll sure more enjoyable moment   cool appreciate offer  But doesn't erase fact happened night  worse wasn't just bad thing  three consecutive mistakes right other all same person server ASHLEY    1  When salad included your dinner order server read off choices  Easy right? Most know drill simple  Done  exactly  Ashley read off choices salads come dinner including Caesar Salad  ordered Caesar    2  Cocktails  ordered two Vodka Collins  Easy make  regular drink us  Unless specified unless call type Vodka establishment give House Vodka    3  bill   Just over $160 00  pay cash 2 one hundred dollar bills  Easy math  200 minus 160 forty dollars change  Give take loose change  But still simple math nothing hard    But here's thing    Although she reads off salads if choices come dinners Caesar salads actually extra charge  once did she say something along lines Caesar extra okay? If she mentioned promise would said yes  good  Instead she decided keep bit info us    Our Vodka drinks  Although did usual ordering Vodka Collins Call drink she ahead used Kettle Vodka house Vodka  other words yes extra charge too   Our bill  Knowing should receive approximately forty dollars back Ashley returned change  She left  opened double checked everything btw when also saw above problems  But top off    she didn't short change fifty cents even dollar  short ten dollars!   To three things happen all same night same server all money    mean really think  eyes mistake anymore  She clearly deceived us  Definitely good thing  accidentally give ranch dressing over blue cheese  Marinara sauce over Meat sauce  But state there's extra charge Caesar assume wanted Kettle One take additional ten dollars money?!!!!  However way want look comes down especially since ones unfortunate experience    Ashley told company this  she took upon herself take money  Big mistake    I'll say again did reach Manager  Dominic did offer things right  don't know entails but he seemed kind professional  experience worse ever ANYWHERE  However kids old school feel  if happen take trip Vegas soon maybe    just maybe we'll give another shot  But happened  really tough one  if all 100% better revise review but until then terrible way lose customers  Very deceiving  thought more happened trust them? recommend place would wrong part reader  clearly spelled easy one  If you're looking special dinner tonight weekend regardless if you're local  visitor say might wise extra homework browse many restaurants Las Vegas surrounding areas  said we're talking accidentally being served ranch over blue cheese    money  Money taken us  Because Capo's lost respect trust    And now you're deciding remember your money always your choice  <EOR> This place great!!! food outstanding! theme really cool! atmosphere amazing! yourself favor just go! <EOR> What cool place!

Apparently is   just bad but terribly stale   gobbled chewy stale loaf anyway because hungry waiting nearly ripping teeth process   The main course eventually came all sub par   Edible yes   Olive Garden quality kind way maybe bit worse   fettuccine alfredo seemed straight outta TV dinner box   added shrimp nice size   My Dad ravioli's red sauce meatballs   Again just edible   Especially since starving   But very generic taste all around   honestly felt embarrassed brought Pop eat this   This true Italian place   gimmicky eatery its speakeasy theme atmosphere   If ever real Italian food taste food total let down  <EOR> Caesar salad excellent Moscato wine excelllent garlic butter excellent bread     meh  Service terrible  Nice garlic sauce but overpriced ravioli  Only 5 ravioli $18 95  Wasn't good enough warrant price extra $5 average meatball  don't know why famous because tasted bread crumbs me  Food sat under heating lamp 20 minutes before someone finally delivered it  far longer needed waiting service missed planned event because it  No weren't busy Trying fun but put room showing website  side room wasn't very nice  if its authentic why don't authentic SWEET Italian sausage  Why hard find west? Lastly checking ID when use credit card but taking your license back necessary  don't trust it  Bring cash  <EOR> I found somewhat hidden gem Las Vegas 3 years ago now every time town  shopping center looks old Ponderosa outside first time almost didn't even because outside appearance but once inside atmosphere great  food great evenings usually Frank Sinatra type  crooner singing even magician comes around tables few tricks  easily  favorite restaurants Las Vegas  <EOR> Food goodish  Service BAD!!!!!  ordered corona served lemon?!  long delays between courses asked chicken pasta didn't it but still charged  just paid because didn't want wait updated check    Cool concept but really bad service  <EOR> Follow check in!

Fun place drink two!! <EOR> My review Sunday Brunch  deal off Travel Zoo actually low expectations  Typically when place groupon other voucher most places treat second class citizens  case Caop's  This best dining experience long time  service great food all really good  But just atmosphere live singer entertaining room  top off cheese cake bomb  brunch great can't wait back dinner  <EOR> Excellent atmosphere service  Food mediocre  want love place because its old school Italian setting but food really underwhelming  If picky your pasta then place try  <EOR> I really wanted place but poor service long delay food overall neglect table made disappointing experience    I think secret door cool idea theory love entire Italian mob theme restaurant but think asking if people reservations then making seem inconvenience seat if don't isn't smart business  showed before 4 pm host staff innocently argued front being unsure if could seat restaurant table people sitting it    My partners beer showed ten minutes ordered waited solid thirty minutes eggplant parmigiana sausage peppers  dish good very large portion which happy see hefty $21 price but sausage peppers overly salty taste   We didn't see server much she busy tending larger party seated us  water lacked refills weren't checked dinner dropped off when asked dessert menu she dropped off closed book but when opened no menu inside  She didn't come back 10 minutes decided even order anything because would taken even longer    I would come back live music but probably later then sooner  <EOR> My best friend showed dinner night    good! rented movie room blast    Went last night sangria husband whiskey drink  Both delicious server started great  Unfortunately toward end food came cold server didn't come back until around dessert time  When asked speak manager no came ended leaving paying bill  Based first visit more likely back but little disappointed  <EOR> NOTE decided place price range left before even tried any food     We drove past place five times day decided should stop here  few lights can't entirely tell if open night little confusing where entrance until saw giant entrance sign    I agree other reviews fun speakeasy entrance    We walked booth but watch few spots because seems wood floor starting rot spots  But can't see because place very dimly lit  music playing Sinatra ish live singer  music loud side but good    We given menus then realized simple spaghetti $18  if want share want charge additional $6  spaghetti basically cheapest thing menu besides appetizers  decided place price range left before even tried any food   little bummed cause atmosphere fun but just much pay little bit pasta  <EOR> I heard Capo's friend intrigued   and Capo's did disappoint! Great experience  Atmosphere food service   all excellent  Definitely would back  <EOR> A good example restaurant much potential many positives should no problem sitting comfortably 5 stars    but apparently whole place management staff doesn't care lick think place   The food great five star sure but sloppily prepared way overpriced presented air arrogance intimidation   if whole place saying Don't know Capo's ungrateful little punk  Now sit down shut eat your dinner we're gonna come over you  Now if you'll excuse need ready some thick necked guys really nice silk suits going paying visit real soon  <EOR> Love place   food delicious bartender Brandon very personable friendly   He excellent cocktails especially  martinis   Definitely back soon! <EOR> This Chicago old school mobster themed restaurant  Frank Dino tunes playing dimly lit plenty red vinyl booths love   The food fresh delicious service fast friendly  soda conniseur theirs top shelf  2 for 1 Tuesdays locals dinner menu only  <EOR> GANGSTA YO!

The Chef's Swims Fishes ! disappointed! <EOR> It's pretty dark inside atmosphere great mob style food delicious    I back <EOR> This definitely go to spot taking visitors me! pretty heavy rotation  Food pricey but usually some kind deal going keep eye Groupon usually lunch deal 5% cash back Yelp and or BOGO deal Tuesdays locals  Nice thing BOGO deal just take $40 off your total bill if bring visitors $20 each local     Favorite part entrance! always feel cool busting password  Ambiance inside definitely gives speakeasy feel dim lighting red tufted leather seats Godfather TVs live music 6pm piano Frank Sinatra singer   HH 3 6p Mon Sat if don't mind sitting bar    If salad dressing side since pretty heavy handed  Cesar w chicken also fave me  Try Italian Duck Egg Drop Soup if you're feeling adventurous bit salty but hits spot when there's word may e coli lettuce  also substituted lettuce w spring mix last night which nice  Crème brulee fave dessert!  Usually opt picatta dishes  Pastas all homemade meatballs ginormous really hard wrong w that  Great service ambiance decent food ongoing deals 4 me  <EOR> Food great  Service pitiful!!  ask everything  Waitress kept disappearing find her  think completely forgot turn order then made excuses why took 40 minutes appetizer  large party refused split check calculate bill tax tip  Then waitress attitude because she wait figure bill  Such shame  3rd time experience here  Doubt 25 people party return  <EOR> The best hidden gem Las Vegas  atmosphere spectacular  food great drinks delicious  Ask Nico drink won't disappointed   Also special bonus lounge singer actually sounds Frankie blue eyes himself  <EOR> Black velvet wallpaper red velvet chairs dark wood bar sparkly crystal chandeliers live piano music door dudes attitudes out of world service reasonably priced bottles wine   I totally fell love place  can't believe only just now found Capos thanks Yelp!    I highly recommend Capos romantic date night large groups friends  also reliable attraction your stubborn Midwestern relatives refuse eat hummus sushi   My husband intended enjoy Fuggedaboudit Fridays but Capos said fuggit happy hour special  But bar honored deal because they're cool that   My husband split shrimp scampi appetizer which only five pieces average sized shrimp set top bed delicious bread  soaked butter garlic  delicious but little overpriced  Order during happy hour instead  way interesting event happened while sat bar  mobbish door dudes fireman carried drunk man front door back  don't know if drunkard hired enter restaurant way but thought Wow  really completes mob atmosphere  dinner husband sat red round booths split chicken marsala I think bottle old vine Zinfandel $35   would eaten more if wasn't counting calories    Capos deserves least 4 5 stars based first visit  haven't tried enough menu give five  Right now though favor Capos over Nora's Herbs Rye  <EOR> Excellent place date  Food little pricey but well worth it  Chicken Alfredo best Alfredo sauce ever had  Plus if tues two one  Service extremely slow but made good live music  sure reservation  <EOR> I could possibly say enough great things restaurant  questioned choice when arrived but quickly reassured  atmosphere crazy cool food absolutely amazing  boyfriend said meatballs best he's ever had  expecting creamy garlic dressing spicy but don't care  am painfully full chicken parm fried ravioli! <EOR> GREAT CONCEPT BAD EXECUTION  The idea Speakeasy style restaurant dining great  dining experience itself much   I laugh when reading Steakhouse menu because just weren't many steak options  Shrimp caught eye few dishes clams did also  We'd heard great things meatballs but wanted seafood  Italian place right? Seafood pasta sound easy enough   Unfortunately 6 evening shrimp   Choice number 2 wasn't bad though  Gallows clams red sauce  good lot clams  sauce tasty  Would good if I'd shared over husband's alfredo because terrible  Flavorless sauce   meatball however excellent  very large tender! Exploding flavor inside! doubt we'll return but fun check out! I'd clams again he'd probably throw meatball top share  A salad red sauce preceeded dinner very good  Husband disliked sauce   tiramisu dessert finished evening great too!  We Groupon but still wasn't inexpensive dinner was  You're partly paying experience though  fun dining dark  Service room improvement! first heard place fake reality show supposedly took place there  wish Food Network would stop airing crap but glad chance check places supposedly featured!   If restaurant fails highly suggest owner start meatball production factory freeze 'em ship out! guaranteed customer California waiting day! <EOR> You need reservation end bar  Server professional  food fair  expected more authentic Italian restaurant  Music nice but little overbearing when trying conversation  temperature restaurant being sauna  back again most likely not  restaurant good place experience   Later night following day became sick food poisoning  <EOR> I never recommend any other Italian restaurant Vegas   Amazing atmosphere better food!  Simply amazing  <EOR> My partner came because high reviews Yelp  vacationing Las Vegas felt Italian  huge surprise!

He then opened hidden door  When stepped into door walked into 1920s!  amazing!  The atmosphere felt authentic exception large screen LCD where Good Fellas playing  walls decorated old gangsters very good singer strolling restaurant singing old Rat Pack songs   The food just good atmosphere!

Thank you! <EOR> Capo's experience takes back old Vegas  Provide secret password you've made reservations or take look website   speakeasy atmosphere starts moment enter extends host seats you    The pasta great but food definitely overpriced  lot people rave Caesar's salad which overpriced overdressed  Tony's duck soup extremely salty ridiculously overpriced $7 95 small bowl  Capo's known pastas favorites Scarface shrimp scampi  admit loved lemon butter white wine sauce well cooked angel hair pasta but five pieces shrimp  $26 95 wasn't worth price  top portion sizes relatively small unless lasagna   left still hungry wishing instead ordered 14 oz  boneless NY strip $10 more    However people come off the Strip experience which you'll get  fact might even catch act Magic V close illusionist sleight of hand artist  seen many tricks he performed but always amazed anyways  Apparently there's 9 30 show but treated table side experience  would probably come back if out of towner really craving pasta show  Just ready pay on the Strip prices  <EOR> I girls weekend Vegas!! Capo's being highly recommended friend mine made reservations! Although saw more bad reviews good yelp still decided take chance!   I really enjoyed you're checked in!

My bf bought Groupon first time dining spot  workers extremely rude then asked speak manager  He would accept groupon because said four ppl but other couple canceled last minute  groupon 2 people cost less money but wanted spend lot more 2 person deal but manger refused   So let straight     you're telling don't want business? Especially since told we'd spend lot more 2 person deal? Why does matter many ppl dining if just told we'd spend much more money?  RIDICULOUS  On top he tried swindle into paying waaaay more if wanted stay dine  He rudest manager ever met life  He attitude entire time extremely unfriendly  He basically said its fault can't follow rules   It's ironic writing such negative review because initially decided eat reading positive reviews yelp    but far awful experience   After left Craftsteak MGM GRAND spent 3 times much because knew we'd better service best food guaranteed  <EOR> Great place lot going on!

Next time remember order something more complicated   would say over all food 4   Service   restaurant crowded but server seemed running around she completely swamped   She may checked only once throughout entire meal   Before entrees came ordered wine could dinner but entrees came ate them server finally came back said bar backed drinks would coming soon   just told cancel them because done eating!  looked bar 3 people sitting bartender just putting glasses away chatting barback   Then she took forever bring check take put credit card it   Overall service kind sucked   would 3   So I'd give restaurant general 3 5 but since can't sorry Capo's round down because definitely 4 star experience   always loved restaurant because unique experience entry way Sinatra like singer ambiance but time mildly disappointing   I'd back but anytime soon won't top list  <EOR> Las Vegas best kept secret  Its time warp back 1940's speakeasy  knock door into secret doorway restaurant see frank sinatra look alike singing  music behind piano walking around restaurant  All staff play part true Italian staff especially Jeremy customer service outstanding food fabulous atmosphere intoxicating  Best place dinner canoli sure! must Vegas  <EOR> Absolutely fantastic every way!!
