Located casino floor beautiful Venetian Hotel V Bar decent sized place offers happy hour deals 5 8pm 7 days week   The inside V Bar dimly lit large L shaped bar quite few booths soft benches dance floor  9pm V Bar becomes nightclub features DJ hookah more  Once V Bar becomes club you'll pay cover charge before entering  Since much clubber left before 9pm     My party six showed V Bar 5 30pm partake HH deals    Their HH features half off beers well cocktails small percentage off specialty cocktails    The reason such great time V Bar even though showed during happy hour even though Saturday evening during Spring break weekend place ghost town  drank V Bar almost two hours pretty much place ourselves  awesome    I quite few drinks almost two hours V Bar  favorite drink evening Creamy Coconut Mojito  strong but still smooth sweet  also really enjoyed Key Lime Pie Martini Blueberry Stoli Press some crazy shots adorable server brought us   Since HH prices great  service also amazing  server super cute very friendly  She really helped experience V Bar enjoyable one      I'll definitely returning V Bar next time LV  great place start your evening before crazy night strip <EOR> Went private event Thursday night basing review solely as didn't normal night   greeted door confirmed list given entry stamps  When inside music pumping great DJ mixed old classics new favorites drinks flowing staff hosts footing bill more attentive  space beautiful ample comfortable seating throughout  intimate club feel Vegas place isn't large but yet still large enough people party never saw just because opposite sides event  favorite V Bar staff someone clearing tables also fantastic dance moves could tell he loved job he danced table next ensuring no empties sat around long  enjoyed ourselves and am really club person ! <EOR> small pretty fun when bring your own crowd ya no cover charge all door people really hot asian chick actually drank when she escorting people during last call the drinks may pricey but when your vegas expected drop something yeah those long waits into tao paying big dudes just let in every night vegas would club somehow end night over here there night then headed over scores didnt come back room till 9am good times which reminds call door lady back hehe definitely 'cozy' place chill hidden gem  great music small dance floor awesome drinks vibing atmosphere <EOR> Went Sunday night  mainly all sorts Hispanic Latin music playing  All types! Anything Swap meet music old new Latin radio hits along few English songs   This place isn't everyone   Since boyfriend likes little more low key great those want smaller crowds prefer ultra lounge rather overcrowded mainstream clubs    very intimate cozy yet hip atmosphere   would probably recommend coming start your night just did   Service awesome    There no cover   also given coupon buy 2 drinks 1 free special     Only bad part having walk such distance parking structure actual bar  <EOR> V bar awesome!! Great music great service  group best night V bar all any other night Vegas  danced all night  service excellent! All staff treated very well  def  again recommend place big time! Wooo hooo! V Bar  D <EOR> Dropped group friends 6 12 09   bouncer told cover charge $20 which didn't expect   checked website prior going   friend showed bouncer website phone which clearly read Never cover  should convince right?  Nope he then tells policy changed 2 weeks ago but website isn't updated yet   takes over 2 weeks Venetian change few words webpage?  don't think so   I don't care if need pay cover but shady enough walk away   Theres plenty other places goto Vegas anyways  <EOR> Short Review V Bar twice both times support home girl dancing there   pretty small lounge but okay spot just grabbing quick drink Venetian   Oh remember seeing meeting Quest Crew because table   that pretty cool night  <EOR> Terrible service bait switch happy hour!  could pay back very rude staff manger! <EOR> Looking relaxing contemporary spot some cocktails friends?

So left POS Tao headed down V Bar  Wasnt crowded but doesn't really poppin till 1am ish when people start leaving Tao come down here    Pretty chill place DJ point jams theres no real dance floor just open space near entrance people just dance there  TV's showing music video song playing   Overall enjoyed place should V Bar if two happens     1  Your night ruined because shitty ass Tao thats packed sardines   2  Your guest list connection fails no other place go   [BELIEVE both situations lol] <EOR> Friends visiting town other week  looking bar restaurant could watch NBA finals some drinks talk stories  walked around Palazzo Venetian  decided check place none been  way early place packed but actually worked perfect us  pretty much most part whole section ourselves front center widescreen above  service great hostess very friendly asked if showing game she server she great attentive never worry drinks running sure if all time give mix nuts munch drinks  place normally hang but always good mix things life  Smaller upscale lounge V bar pretty cool place hang out  <EOR> Nothing Special loud bar hookah service   Drink selection nothing special    Better options there  <EOR> Very lounge y place no lines no guest list no cover no bullshit!  It's Vegas mega dance club but wasn't designed think all patrons very aware that  Good few drinks sitting around people watching   soaking DJ's beats  There's even little open space front DJ booth event few people decide need let bodies limbs run amok   Beware often times becomes another outlet Cougarville swamped TAO Nightclub rejects late evening  hit miss   last visit seemed horde midwesterner type folks including guy apparently walked Marlboro cigarette ad all decked cowboy hat snakeskin boots  he dead serious too   Drinks actually cheaper big nightclub  Around $6 $7 cocktail  <EOR> Fun chic bar designed same folks did Lotus New York  upscale big city vibe complete w a velvet rope front big men all black  Located Venetian hence V fun place party but crowd changes depending convention town  <EOR> 10 7 2010  I attended latin night nice change strip   good experience some culture Vegas vs  most nights being same mix top 40 hip hop house   Beautiful venue $20 mingled some fyne latinas!  Thursday night crowded but  point couldn't move   B back <EOR> i wasn't overly crowded music great! maybe liked people because knew most them? maybe vibe just different  i fact chill then dance room move around  the drinks kinda strong but  good thing! <EOR> Was happening place Sunday night  Barely anyone kept asking Bottle Service but what? Everyone just bar  Thank god didn't pay in  Overall its place hang music bad  Maybe stop next time Vegas hope its more hopping  <EOR> First night ever Vegas didn't know where place friend  Just wanted drinks surprise hookahs too! super hard track down guy running hookahs even though lounge wasn't big service horrible  Because took guy 30+ mins back sat speakers hookah free  Perhaps free part made experience all sweeter and worth extra star   <EOR> Maybe crowd based two techie conferences being held time   maybe music loud ears ringing all night afterwards   maybe  no else seemed want sit near side room comfortable benches against wall   Hundreds people seemed jammed area right walk but no side room except rocking DJ   people supposed meet V Bar told couldn't because crowded   Am missing something?  Maybe because wearing jeans    <EOR> Maybe 3 5 dj decent  Saturday nite Vegas friends didn't feel waiting line tipping door man big money looked something else   Enter V Bar   V bar decent amount people no cover   No cover??  Doesn't sound bad until see price drinks  where catch you   Oh well want party head in   The place pretty small   two parts place left private booths pseudo dance floor right bar more booths but they're more open    crowd mostly young professionals though party cougars surprsingly drawing quite bit attention some younger men   The place never really reached capacity which nice while when place began clear enough room dance   guess should've planned evening little better but place wasn't bad just great   wouldn't say bar distinguished itself any other hotel bar   probably wouldn't back but wouldn't discourage peopel checking out   certainly some people watching done  <EOR> I group 7 girls looking somewhat low key night  V Bar much fun! bouncers friendly cocktail waitresses really attentive  sat lounge areas never waited more 5minutes drinks  DJ played great music danced most time there  crowd pretty mixed all all good time! Definitely if you're looking dance without being stepped groped! <EOR> Went 6 months ago lounge great if want break big box clubs Vegas offers  decor nice but nothing cutting edge worldly level  drinks priced decently service great  talent fluctuates best events happening around Venetian  beauty its location sits right middle stripe!  If talent more consistent decor little more avant garde would definitely give place 5 stars  Come Vegas!!!!! easy thing globetrotters expect this!!!!LOL! <EOR> Best place start your party bottle service starting  $200 plus great service great atmosphere  stop tonight ask simon door 7027427430 <EOR> i guess where those rejected tao come   j k horrible experience tao stumbled across place   saw short line formed outside entrance hesitated since no longer bear stand 3 inch high heels   but vegas bachelorette party to do list completely checked off before night over   inquired table service hostess turned much more economical anticipated $200 bottle minimum 2 bottles      this bar lounge small but enough sitting areas along walls   dj spinning top 40 songs occasionally michael jackson's c'mon billy jean classic    table service more adequate sufficient constantly brought new glasses cleaned area us     i liked place enough lighting   helped tremendously when picking guys help accomplish missions to do list since chosen purely based looks if bachelorette take body shot looks matter   trust me!   <EOR> After unsuccessful attempt trying into Tao ended finding lounge way garage   It's really nice modern bar without pretentious people snobby attitude would find other places   DJ spinning live drinks strongly poured waitress extremely nice ladies standing outside greet into lounge itself wasn't bad eyes   Very comfortable couches friendly people  even two guys hanging next area join ladies group dancing without being creepy!! No charge overall cool atmosphere  Tao what? <EOR> There many funny memories bar  Probably most notable watching election returns years ago seeing Florida called wrong  friend Shelly predicted market would crash she right    So last trip Vegas conference stopped into V Bar glass wine  There's very wide selection bartender's recommendation generic Pinot Noir    I realized V Bar really smaller thought  called tested few friends showed wonderful time  Nice place funny memories  <EOR> Always end good music good drinks kind hidden  Great people dance little hates big crowds    <EOR> I first heard place when guest Venetian  Every night stop dead duck  very laid back kinda bar ambient type music occasionally hiphop  seats super comfortable but boring empty here      If want some private time your significant other drink place might you  If want party great time look else where    *Tip Since place right before entrance Blue Man Group grab drink two before catching show  <EOR> On Sunday nights learned many exclusive clubs Vegas closed  led lot wandering around girls sore heels  Luckily just give passed front inconspicuous entrance giant V  sure cover going pricy  However when asked front desk asked whether wanted bottle service $200   reasonable vs  just going bar    We started bar but cocktail waitress gave big table despite getting bottle! Service A++  drink menu delightful mojitos orange cream martinis among other items    Probably BEST drinks ever Key Lime Pie Martini  two row which almost never food drinks  pie crust sprinkled around rim cup  If crave drink without having suffer through taste hard liquor drinks place you!  The decor spacious trendy  couch seating modern comfortable  music fantastic danceable but loud overwhelm conversation  Within 20 minutes everyone dancing people breaking floor having good time  Actually everyone mingled all dancing each other until club closed   Great find!! May different during week but Sunday night exactly needed  Amazing drinks good dancing social vibe  <EOR> I read some other reviews but experience much more positive  Sunday night perfect  wasn't super packed bartenders cool  Drinks weren't super expensive   comfy but room moving dancing  <EOR> I place  few drinks some folks before decided call night   wasn't crowded since weeknight nice chill chat  looking drink menu decided order strawberries cream since looked good  once ordered waitress she mentioned wasn't good i'd wasting money  wow  never heard before  but good  liked honesty  asked she would recommend took hynotised hypnotiq pineapple juice other stuff can't remember raspberry bellini  both really good strong  music great 80's mix fun people watch  place itself isn't big only imagine would weekend night  probably packed  <EOR> I always try spend least nights V Bar when Vegas   staff best ever seen Vegas feel your top priority  don't think another club lounge comes close  Ask Jorge vip host he man! <EOR> No cover no lines no strict dress code good music music video djing ding ding ding!!! great MOJITOS!!!!  Damn those mojitos $13    why am love sweet concoction?? maybe because IF they're made right  they taste good don't even know you're drinking something alcoholic  great job V bar making favorite drink taste damn good sad cause fricking wasted  Pre party cran vodkas don't mix well 4 mojitos   you  probably know night ended   Oh  and even though dj   there isn't really set dance floor  no dancing party start everyone boogeying away  also plus nice comfy couch seating those didn't want dance just people watch  <EOR> Yup fan place  much would loved Tao mood pay 20 30 bucks cover  if experience isn't same? least don't surrender arm leg drink    Music pretty good considering DJ friend buddy rolled with  result allowed VIP section which led some awesome bottle service  quite perk when know DJ    Its nice know there's no line wait staff super nice attentive bar isn't crowded drinks cheaper easy in and out access entire night  witnessed people stumble club bathroom down hall come back bloodshot eyes vomiting only another round inside  proud saying myself those people but then again its Vegas    As far aesthetics looks your typical dimly lit Strip Casino bar  Nothing special really  if going high end clubs isn't your thing anymore if you're willing cough money cover expensive drinks good alternate  Seriously  <EOR> Had great time weekend Labor Day!!

LOL drunk people great they no sense whatsoever! <EOR> If looking chill place casino would it     I think more hookah lounge bar   try sell VIP tables few times coming Las Vegas local won't need it   Its busy bar getting your drinks quick   think place more prefunk club party lounge     Usually music video mash ups when busy people watch video watch haha  <EOR> In city full bars clubs holds its own being dive bar   only las vegas style    people don't come jeans unless american rag but least somewhere jeans right? any case nice placeto set shop when feel going but going all out  <EOR> I Wednesday night   read reviews Yelp wasn't sure think   Anyway since first night Vegas girlfriends figured wanted try small bar lounge   definitely chill spot   fairly empty but good music beers reasonably priced   Definitely good spot first date if you're looking relaxing evening good music drinks <EOR> Exactly Lena B  said    Came alternative since Tao FAAAAT ass line past weekend   bad tho arrived around 12am   friends hooked front line but waiting sister bf brother still way   felt bad could've gone w ease but course asked move line   Oh wells   Vbar still crackin   Short line no cover   All good   Music cool   Basically felt any normal club SF since dance floor really small but great comfy booths   Bartenders nice environment chill   great time = <EOR> Avoid all costs!

Really great cocktails  Bottoms up! <EOR> V Bar basically just bar    over priced drinks    would earn 3 stars except COVER CHARGE     I'm sure why anyone would pay cover $20 each including girls! instead going much cooler Tao right upstairs  into discussion argument cousin when she generously paid cover charges    tried convince I'd just ask cover back but instead just in      We danced bit much older people dance floor and many people all that couldn't sit because tables just table service but again just small ish bar   drank bit least drinks good bartenders nice    I probably won't back definitely won't back if keep charging cover!!! <EOR> It's small   but cozy way   You'll fun  <EOR> Laid back lounge heart Vegas party scene but great find hold something intimate start end your night   Came catch some cousins  place wasn't packed Tuesday night everyone able sit around modern decor chairs light tables  servers came every 15 minutes asking more drinks  Music loud but conversation possible  Hookah also provided but did partake   Tucked between Venetian Palazzo  No cover when crowded meant way  <EOR> Fun relaxed club bar venetian  Drinks good prices fair vibe lot more chill most other places  Had drink buzz berry edible flower unique  say least  They offer hookahs rent well having amazing drink menu small dance floor nice place stop while vegas  <EOR> A nice little lounge no cover located right next Blue Man Theatre Venetian   Definitely very chill laid back place plays good music serves $10 drinks   Come relax before big night gettin hyphy hyphy somewhere else  <EOR> V Bar second stop part Las Vegas Club Crawl  You'll find Venetian say love it  everything bar lounge      Dim lights sucker 'em! bar overlooks comfy couches tables seating area good ratio seating standing area music stills allows conversation w your mates your date without ripping  apart your vocal cords smart chic dress code    V Bar actually reminds Brunswick Social Brisbane but dimmer lights minus food!   I think they've happy hour 5 PM 8 PM which pretty cool  lot! <EOR> Chill spot if wanna away BIG club scene  free no dress code  Place bit small   DJ played hip hop first then changed rave music  No thanks   I would gave extra star if played hip hop all night  <EOR> After partying hard night before great place hang mingle friends  ton VIP tables but every time come never seen place more then third full  Mixed drinks $10 12 Beers around $6 7    Music little loud but think  only downside  Waitresses very pretty super nice  added hookah which $30 bowl $65 unlimited bowls which great deal if plan being all night  There's cigar shop few stores down V Bar also smoke inside    Just really chill place hang out  surprised place  rarely busy but don't mind it! <EOR> This place cool! good music good bottle service  host hooked up  Met some cool people here  <EOR> This place sentimental fave mine   husband just gotten married having small reception Canaletto Venetian   seeing line Tao told $2000 bottle declined just happened find place coordinating something else friends   price right own booth just perfect celebrating   even through some comp shots champange   Service waitress excellent she would slap hand if tried drink    way bottle service should be!  asked DJ play wedding song first dance ended being Love Club    Awesome   He also through electric slide later nostalgic purposes   Fun fun night   best  <EOR> I loved bar  night cover charge guys only $10  dress code guys simple polo  hookah $25 which think cheap Vegas  drank champagne $9 glass  liked wasn't crowded didn't huge line in The place small but small area dancing  Overall its nice small lounge definitely recommend! <EOR> This tiny bar some couches seems try fancy  really don't know having drink chilling people would different your own hotel room  think its serves pretty good pit stop before going somewhere bigger better more interesting   So why 5 stars? Because 5pm ordered lychee martini they call Lotus Blossom think super good  PLUS 5 star part ate first decorative lychee bartender brought over TWO MORE LYCHEES! JACKPOT!!!!!  Yeah am easy that  Admittedly only people but felt connection V bar  lychee connection  <EOR> I place Venetian its few cool lounges decent happy hour prices 5 8pm   Its slow time night but drinks well made its good place start your night  think kick cover charge 9pm  <EOR> Damn it!!! many more curse words  Why did place shut down?!  If stayed Venetian Palazzo perfect place lounge dinner before dancing since Tao same property  Also solid place if just wanted relax chill environment good music    Drinks great  bartenders hot dressed lacey racey outfits  DJ always played music you'd want move always honored requests even if requested Britney Spears! medium sized dance floor which put much good use  Solid bar seating ample booth space lounge around in  served legit hookah  Overall happy vibes    I've never reviewed business  closed but feel great place just died  <EOR> Atmosphere good but hookah biggest rip off ever  quick light coal overly expensive  <EOR> Went bf celebrate friend wedding party  played mostly 90 music which loved   The environment nice but really crowded  Only good hangout if bottle service  This place also hookah there's different scent flying around  don't smoke if smoke probably wouldn't mind smell   One star off bc ran Hennessy Jameson          <EOR> Maybe hip cool but just didn't place   seemed bar trying club confused schizophrenia   sort of rope front if wanted start line yet walked right in   don't know if rope place look cool desirable???  sort schizo feeling continued into bar bar right? night club?    missing big dance floor possibly light show something   Moving on   the place some cozy looking couches tables but all reserved didn't chance test if couches indeed cozy   friend grabbed seat bar   bartender really fast friendly made some really strong drinks  Major bonus points she really cool  Once kicked back drinks enjoyed ourselves     I guess maybe kind place come pre club mood real thing but whatever   nice place relax long day well made cocktail  <EOR> Good place     fun packed which kind night bad        back again     <EOR> Very cool chill place some good music drinks!  ever dance little if mood catches right!  Great bartenders great ambiance! <EOR> I always place  Easy in  Great groups  actually carry conversation without screaming heard   Granted travel into casino find loo   but hey baby vegas least your drink you! So if you're looking fun night minus hassle big name club like studio light etc Try Vbar you'll glad did! <EOR> Very loud hookah bar more lounge  can't really carry conversation because music very loud  Service terrible drink server hard hold cause she walks away soon she sets your drink down music loud she can't hear if you're trying call back  Hookah service really bad ask 3 times hookah once finally server never came back adjust coals  <EOR> Inventive libations more laid back atmosphere those ultraclub daylounge nightlife whatever stop! Was private event hosts nice crafted some great martinis  early evening music tolerable level  best way experience bar opinion  could actually talk amongst ourselves! A nice stop try some superb martinis enjoy comfy seating areas escape throngs casino! <EOR> i really enjoyed first Vegas bar here  came twice during stay Venetian  service bartenders awesome fast   knew recommend stuff  music great too  definitely more crowded saturday compared friday night  liked opened very late  Great place meet people just chill  drinks strong some good  <EOR> Totally chill environment came Tuesday night discovered wack Pure was   Unfortunately time decided more hungry thirsty headed over Noodle Asia instead   place totally dead only maybe handful patrons there   But sure if more folks would brought party them! <EOR>
