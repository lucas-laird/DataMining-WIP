My only complaint taco shell taco overcooked hard  But everything everything else perfecto! <EOR> Another location pre cooking Carne Asada then reheated when ordered  Tough leather overcooked  trend only take them farther downhill! <EOR> Had couple shredded beef tacos Robertos lunch beef didn't any normal flavoring   Service good but food needs little work good some other Robertos town  <EOR> Best Robertos know around vegas excellent staff bean cheese burrito every time point <EOR> This store very clean always good thing! carne asada fries really good portion huge! place open 24x7 Vegas good thing  staff helpful order just right!

No!! Nay!! Love fresh cucumber slices side bar  Perfect offset best spices! Servings huge? More enough share always  Thanks Robertos! <EOR> Rude cashier asked if red salsa almost head snapped off  Super rude customer service  <EOR> Went yesterday noticed raised  prices 30% every item menu   Taped over old price    Tip jar fast food?    especially raising price that   Come Now    I know difference did employees    Sorry can't tip raising price that    Too many other Mexican fast food place better fairly priced    Looks going Real Mom Pops moving forward      Sorry bad! Roberto's talking off Eastern going towards Anthem     <EOR> Personal preference but truly enjoy Roberto's food gotten them  place cleanest such friendly employees working there    I far only come during Taco Wednesday LOVE chicken tacos only $1 29 each  fry shell nice crispy fill moist chicken topped lettuce two kinds cheese  don't skimp ingredients  Each time gotten tacos overflowing!  The two employees times come super friendly smiles face patient while look over menu always suggestions if can't find want  Also always willing something just want  Example friend wanted bean cheese burrito combo but didn't willing making meat bean cheese burrito without meat but still charge same even without meat    The inside restaurant super clean  Tables all wiped down chairs proper places bathrooms clean stocked necessities salsa bar clean filled up   Sad don't offer any pico de gallo but red sauce have  Sometimes pretty spicy but last time wasn't  so sure if use same recipe each time  always leave bagful cucumbers well  Yumm continue come back  <EOR> Service amazing  ended   See tip food  When home painted toilet over hour!  Nuff said right? <EOR> It's Roberto's  used love food here  Over years faded  also think overall quality food well  several locations all over Vegas  think Roberto's better lot spots eat  But trips mexico few world food truck street tacos robertos just average  average eat time time if am craving it  used love it  still good just great books  <EOR> Friendly staff super clean location   I am huge fan Robertos' taco shops  Love getting bean cheese burritos chips breakfast burritos recently fell love chimichangas   My only complain chimichangas some locations included smother your burrito guacamole sour cream  am fan because want crispness burrito shell  When smothered something wet sour cream defeats purpose deep frying burrito just soggy mess  Also burritos size small infant need split meal gets soggy gross sitting fridge guac sauce it   Easily fixed asking toppings side  <EOR> I could eat practically every day and almost do!   Healthy if want cheesy greasy if want!   Bottomless relish bar  favorite place! <EOR> First time eating location  Postmates deliver very busy  original order 2 shrimp cocktails three rolled beef tacos w guacamole side rice beans  When he delivered order he informed Roberto's told weren't able cocktails didn't shrimp  That sucked but ok actually made 6 chicken rolled tacos cheese bean cheese burrito    Damn Roberto's  most disappointing hang over cure ever! <EOR> Skip location charge debit card also 85 Rice instead potatoes owner 3 location Las Vegas <EOR> While waiting friend's doctor appointment decided grab quick bite Roberto's   several locations time but say best looking   place clean seats new bathroom!  bathroom spotless only used 1 coat antibacterial gel afterwards   Which should since appears particular location having its grand opening   much say food other ate didn't sick  prices great service speedy   consistency Roberto's pretty spot which always  good know expect same thing other locations  <EOR> I must say carne asada fries very tasty  However customer service great  job right around corner eat least once week  There's many instances when they've gotten order wrong way another thing bothers don't even apologize it  Customer service definitely lacking considering fact loyal customer really expect more them which why knocked down 3 stars  If customer service isn't good really think whether want keep coming back  <EOR> Love coming lunch especially 99cent chicken taco Wednesday great food never long wait too <EOR> Worst Robertos to   waited over 20 min tacos ask would waited longer   also asked if could refill horchata she proceeded charge me   She never even apologized making wait long   took baby she very irritable   Never coming again   <EOR> Love Roberto's food offer!
