Had tried Spicy Seafood Cream Chanpon well budae jigae    The spicy seafood cream chanpon normal chanpon noodles seafood clams mussel shrimp calamari but cream soup base  Slight spiciness hoped more but surprisingly tasted nice  Originally Cream meant heavy thick  case  Fairly light being cream soup  Best 2 dishes ordered  Due influx people ordered same time budae jiigae took while come out  Originally giving portable gas stove took while but early noted waiter   ramen cheese side jiigae hot steaming  haven't much experience eating jiigae's much but seemed LOT kim chi    pro? con? if love kim chi its your dish LOL    also 2 small bunches enoki like mushrooms sausage canned ham pork  amount kim chi made entire dish quite acidic kim chi  Least fav 2  prob wont order again    Service bit lacking since mainly only 1 waiter  cream chanpon decent especially only $11 while uh kimchi jiigae $20  Would come back chanpon  Wonder if request spicier? Maybe try other things sam gye tang korean ginseng chicken soup D <EOR> Very low energetic ambiance while lunch  Maybe dinner could better  Ordered noodle bibimbab both below expectation compare its competitions <EOR> Great food great service  ordered potstickers corn cheese appetizers kalbi spicy pork entrees  Everything delicious! would definitely eat again especially since only few minutes away house can't believe never come across until now! <EOR> good service good food  Tried cream seafood champong thing kimchi baby back rib soup  delicious  drink lot water personally but Simba the server very good refilling cup  <EOR> If looking fantastic Asian Culture experience without flying Asia take family exposure wonderful authentic Korean food experience  atmosphere open warm without high prices  Order different dishes share portions among each other  felt Thanksgiving without having clean messy kitchen  loved it! <EOR> Food great   daughter come often   Seafood noodle must try!

KALBI RIBS KIMCHI FRIED RICE Rated 2 5 5 bone in kalbi ribs fattier side but tender  Unfortunately kimchi fried rice oily liking  skip dish next time   Although everything tasted 5 5 still think place when mood comforting Korean meal transports friend's kitchen  Try might find new favorite! <EOR> Just sitting 10 minutes grandparents already complaining asses being sore hard bench sitting nothing accommodate us  don't think good idea business take long seating very uncomfortable    When waitress took order she seemed annoyed asked questions menu really just seemed annoyed we only ones    The food just ok  Nothing special   If find another Korean place eat  <EOR> Excited good Korean restaurant southwest side town  good selection dishes Tofu soup fav!

If you're looking nice place grab bite I'd recommend place  <EOR> With Asian fusion restaurants popping left right Vegas honestly did expect anything special when walked but man some nice atmosphere place going! decor simple but effective lights hang ceiling big bulbous balls which ceiling appear much lower place much more casual comfortable  no outdoor seating but benches tables reminiscent picnic tables anyhow  more private people some isolated booths which love     The food amazing  friend ordered Coconut Shrimp Seafood Chanpon Whole Chicken Ginseng Soup  ginseng soup good probably great thing order when you're sick but exceptional opinion  really coming back two other dishes The Seafood Chanpon described come thick Alfredo sauce menu  reality comes much sauce almost soup DELICIOUS  Wimpy am asked server chanpon mild possible when came wasn't spicy all  plenty seafood chanpon  definitely worth price    And then Coconut Shrimp appetizer  lovely delectable coconut shrimp  best shrimp tempura ever had  coconut aroma sauce just well shrimp no idea why nobody else thought but glad chef Mamaoh did  If come decide only trying single dish why would ever? coconut shrimp  won't regret it  appetizer comes four pieces but picture posted only two because good take picture first  Seriously  Trust me    Before keep swooning over food I'd note service exceptional well  only server when friend ate but she top all tasks routinely checked despite isolation booth  Props her!

Spicy baby back ribs melted cheese worthi it  definitely come back  <EOR> Came late lunch 2 30  When store empty  Just myself  booth nice but seat uncomfortable because two separate piece wooden bench   The side dishes nice just would SOYO  liked Kimchi because fresh  sour other places  The food came less 5 min!! Surprised but quick service especially when anybody ordered Dol sot bi bim bap  portion size 1 5 times bigger SOYO's Dol sot bi bim bap  could shared two people unless big eater me  liked sweet Gochujang sauce but spicy expected  delicious! food stayed super hot until finished eating because hot pot 20 min  The waiter guy very nice attentive  back when SOYO packed wait long time  <EOR> Great food great people great bargain  Cozy yet open layout  Tall dividers between booth gives more privacy   Stays open til 9 pm though mostly because liquor license yet   Give try  <EOR> Very good! Nice Service great food  particularly enjoyed bulgogi  potstickers good well  I'd never potstickers Korean style before bit thicker usual  <EOR> MAMAOH's uncomfortable seating didn't hamper dining experience but worth noting place isn't good people tender backs booths rather stiff benches oddly bolted down    Don't come traditional food relatively uninspired but just okay if just need some basic Korean food  only gone fusion  seem emphasize   First time bulgogi burrito which surprisingly very tasty  Bulgogi rice given but mozzarella kimchi really pull together  both delicious filling if little pricey  girlfriend creamy champon or jjampong? if referring korean version which extremely tasty  cream twist works perfectly flavor    The second time udon salad which refreshing tasty  girlfriend tofu soup which she said okay but great   They some issues service primarily just being little slow  give them bit pass new restaurant but don't expect anything come quick unless aren't busy  Prices tad higher I'd expect but nothing beyond reasonable  <EOR> The food amazing  Also service best  Mamaoh favorite Korean place  <EOR> The foods super good! best Korean foods ate town far  ordered spicy pork seafood pancake pot sticker garlic chicken wing  owner super friendly well she stopped table twice just check us  definitely come back again again!! <EOR> Good food nice service  love food should comer more often <EOR> Friendly staff good food!
