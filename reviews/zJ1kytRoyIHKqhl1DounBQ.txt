After suffering through lackluster breakfast stacked plates waited check  waited  waited  won't say server's fault he running around seemed quite busy although he clearly noticed finished more once   Come though  If need more waitstaff then hire some! Bellagio which supposed paragon luxury Vegas I think right? Am wrong? consistently disappointed them maybe aren't?   honestly waited least 15 minutes I feel 20 25 but friend says 15 generous estimate   only reason even check because eventually just flagged down  $60+ later finally way    <EOR> Great place grab quick lunch pool   Shaded tables misters made lunch noon bearable service great   gyro itself isn't amazing mainly due meat lack flavor seasoning   bit bland your local Greek place home probably better version   pita fries hummus come gyro AMAZING   burger also super flavorful tastes grilled over open flame   Yummy  <EOR> ***************************** 1430 ***************************    Located right side entrance smaller pools courtyards  Pool Cafe open Spring through beginning Fall      Light American fare serving breakfast lunch  Good cocktails food  Try smoked salmon grilled chicken sandwich chicken pie      much more relax Bellagio Cafe Garden Conservatory area  Plus see few hot ladies bikinis few old fat men Speedo quite view! <EOR> We oatmeal yogurt parfait  Both excellent  Service top notch   Atmosphere amazing   Highly recommend! <EOR> I'm glad took time read reviews different Bellagio options   other Yelpers spot thoughts Bellagio Pool Cafe   Ambiance great  swimming then stopped breakfast right after  Thanks casual outdoor setting nobody looked twice frizzy disaster called hair   Service friendly food came quickly  No complaints here   Food delicious fresh  two poached eggs side hashbrowns potatoes  daughter corned beef hash  Everything great    I hesitate mention only complaint which charging $7 50 glass orange juice simply ludicrous  But suppose should asked price before ordering it   Overall loved breakfast experience morning wouldn't hesitate return  <EOR>
