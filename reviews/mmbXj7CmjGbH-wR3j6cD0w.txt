Great salads yummy baked potatoes  Nice little dessert set well  <EOR> I love restaurant several reasons   food healthy fight kids eat it  request come here   VERY reasonably priced soups delicious  <EOR> I really concept behind Sweet Tomatoes salad buffet!  fun way your greens when you're about   addition salad supplement your veggies soup pastas desserts think homey cobblers brownie bites muffins    Sweet Tomatoes definitely cafeteria casual its clientele compromised young families vegetarians seniors my observation several visits    While appreciate freshness produce prepared foods  turnover seems very quick  think price little high $12 adult dinner without drink especially since hardly any protein options beans salad area cheese some pastas chicken chicken noodle soup consist all protein offerings    However pickier friends just can't decide anything want eat healthier typically suggest Sweet Tomatoes  <EOR> Hell no!!! just ridiculously sad  Healthy?  Nope!!! Nothing heathy  Nothing actually fresh!!!! really eating canned prepackaged foods  <EOR> I'm huge fan Sweet Tomatoes  alright but seems bit pricey soup salad  though other things besides choices still pretty limited  <EOR> It sometime since last visit  always fan Sweet Tomatoes many reasons since first visit  things simplicity buffet nothing crazy but simple food fresh really lot unhealthy food menu  all starts obvious salad bar first thing hit before even pay sit down  selection salad greens great choose head lettuce organic mix greens romaine greens more think fresh spinach two prepared salad ceasars salad them  toppings pretty diverse raw vegetables pasta salad garnishes something NEW never notice before premium topping  add salad price honestly none looked great just ify spending more plus still soups mac cheese more things menu even checked yet   salad dressings over ten different ones choose one  generally italian dressing guy creamy italian dressing  Once done salad seated unfortunately being holiday ended waiting ten mins most  Still bad wait  manager very friendly made short wait easy   The soups range four five usually vary day day  Most part all pretty solid soups  chili creamy mushroom soup visit  Both soups good hearty  Nice hot perfect cold day  cornbread LOVE it  Between Famous Dave Sweet Tomatoes could cornbread bliss  ended getting four pieces it!!!! mac cheese good  little running side which prefer more thick cheesy one  Still works me  pizza good but visit ran room    Another thing enjoy Sweet Tomatoes lemonade  says house made assume obvious  enjoy strawberry lemonade! nice refreshing perfect compliment nice salad light hearty any style choose   super sweet just right amount    The price very reasonable if looking light buffet Sweet Tomatoes way go      <EOR> Portions EXTREMELY small other salads  Other food really tasty! family place prepared see old people crying babies <EOR> It's don't Sweet Tomatoes still do  If asked year ago would've said 4 stars but now they've raised price few times since then really worth eat anymore unless coupon which usually available newspaper via email if sign e club  came last weekend shocked see lunch price now just under $10! salad buffet? WTF  The benefits eating build your own salad extensive line veggies toppings seemingly homemade dressings  also pre made salads pasta salads but none usually very good worth eating  usually try couple but then end grossed couple bites  Once end salad bar select drink pay your meal    In dining room soup pasta potato bar where choose 6 8 different kinds soup also load extra carbs breads pizza pastas mac cheese baked potato various toppings  usually just soup breads can't comment others   There also dessert area adjacent soup bar fruit pudding soft serve ice cream  only thing worth eating tapioca pudding ice cream  even realized last visit 2 things even better mixed!

Also last time didn't chicken available all day   made little sad since meat girl   didn't single meat item premium toppings selection   Besides non salad items also really yummy   warm muffins brownies deliciously heart healthy seasonal soups   Some soups like thanksgiving dinner soup November really really delicious end going back seconds   pastas mac cheese just okay nothing spectacular    also drink selections especially yummy teas   Overall going Sweet Tomatoes only salad but everything else   food isn't world phenomenal but great healthy buffet spot lunch dinner very reasonable price  <EOR>
