Sin City Wings met more standards expected see again   One thing bothered amount time took food  fresh but place when there's few people front there's no shade hot day  Though if there's time where sun isn't beaming down great place your chicken wing tender fit   I ordered box deal which $10  bit pricey but  expected food trucks food truck fanatic didn't mind  box deal included wings tenders fries sauce bread  fries served good amount made way crispy outside soft inside but burning inside   Sorry vague description fries  sauce just normal ranch served those plastic containers  bread just normal but more buck opinion lol  forgot name flavor wings but fantastic It said sweet spicy but majority sweet no spice but eat lot spicy maybe would try more spicy flavor   I would definitely come back recommend toward others  <EOR> I order  meal asked well done wings them regular fries soggy could barely taste sauce it    Wouldn't  waste money them again  <EOR> I yesterday beer festival MGM village SinCity Wings food truck  horrible  waiting HOUR order because apparently frying wings fries take long when finally order COLD TASTELESS  worst exparience ever restaurant business  Dont bother eat spend your money  <EOR> I wanted love Sin City Wings but didn't  drew large crowd during StrEATs  lengthy wait grub hand  don't often chicken bone tenders  couldn't decide sauce sprung second sauce 50 cents left them naked  Armed Feinberg Hot Buffalo sauce dug in    The Hot Buffalo sauce terribly hot tasty  dunk stuck Feinberg spicy apricot way go  However while breading crisp thick  prefer much lighter coating  homemade ranch very watery no better most bottled versions    The addition macaroni salad watery bread dry seems carb overkill  seem afterthought rather balanced combo  <EOR> Just last time StrEATs instead going usual suspect Slidin' Thru something new last time    The food itself = delicious everything else little bit mediocre    The line wasn't all long all wait food other hand over 30 minutes  food pretty damn good but don't know if say worth wait    I ordered tenders version buffalo sauce they give weird names all sauces seasoned fries  buffalo sauce hot nose started running because that might little much information know mild! same time strangely sweet kick it  could done without those leaves decorated chicken though cilantro? basil? really don't know since didn't taste anything   curly fries skinny greasy LOVED THEM   The price kind steep food truck standards but offered Shasta Tiki Punch moist towelettes wipe your hands done savoring wings   Oh way finally face face Misti first time probably thank food truck that! She Yelp booth which set right next truck kind hidden may never noticed otherwise knowing me    The Final Verdict Pros Well   they're chicken wings tenders! When tasty? Divine fries   They provide moist towelettes   Meeting Misti   Cons Long wait your food  Rather steep food truck only combo deal which involved yucky looking macaroni salad dry looking bread    Suggestions should least combo deal chicken wings fries mozzarella sticks  Although personally if ask seeing chicken takes hell lot longer cook burger first place chicken wing food truck isn't best idea world    Would return? Depends where probably Vegas StrEATs again though  <EOR> I really  am big fan wings am totally addicted Bobby Q travel far wide find truck! Hoping location permanently soon! <EOR> Pretty good wings try them Vegas strEATS impressed tastiness bone in wings  companion some wings friends fried pickles order fries  Upon getting front line companion feeling something spicy asked Buffalo Hot Oscar Ghost Chili Goodman sauces   Our buddy truck informed Buffalo Hot lets taste spice chicken whereas Oscar Goodman I love naming scheme much only tasted burning fire  ordered buffalo hot wanting able taste interplay flavors   The chicken meat tender juicy pretty good wings  However very disappointed spice! no kick all wings should intermediate 'heat' step between Oscar Goodman Buffalo hot option those Thai food 7 10! fried pickles amazing  Surprising? really  Fried pickles always rock  Sin City some solid wings gotta give love cool atmosphere food truck  <EOR> Usually food truck closer Student Union instead Lied Library normally don't but decided try day when closer where was   I ordered Bobby Q boneless wings because  roll enjoy most things bbq sauce it  wait felt rather long especially since hungry plenty studying do  didn't think would fill but did delicious  enjoy wings I'd come back eat food truck whenever least if time wait it  <EOR> I WISH COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS!! food truck community event attended owner extremely rude before even window place order  Although he rude still placed order because still wanted food  30 minutes order still called inquired much longer wait would again owner extremely rude  When food finally came ordered I ordered traditional wings served boneless   Instead owner apologizing KINDLY explaining ran traditional wings response very rude short ran   When explained he should've stated low traditional wings could chance would boneless he stated they've traditional wings 40 minutes which means when placed order did traditional wings yet he still let order them  frustrated disappointed whole experience  also witnessed being rude another gentleman also inquiring wait time because he waiting long time  Needless say refund  refuse support ANY business gives terrible service no matter good food smells looks  owner handled TERRIBLY he REALLY needs improve people skills if he's going serving public  Because treated poorly never even THINK spend money again  <EOR> Slow  SLOW  SLOW EXTREME  Even food truck wait times ridiculously long  understand good food takes time but ridiculous  doesn't help there's only chef truck trying pump all orders    Let's into portion sizes  $10 50 decent amount combo no drink  boy portions vary  Having three people order together seeing mad difference amount food prime way people pissed off    The flavor good though but don't know if prices wait warrant taste  don't know if just but when you're something doesn't sense cross off your dry erase menu?!  Pro Tip Pay attention people outside your truck saying  When people getting pissed when served order waiting 30 minutes probably means you're doing something right  <EOR> This 3rd time trying place say bit disappointed quality here  First 2 times good  But time just good all  20 wings hopes getting half boneless half bone in   No luck  don't understand why couldn't  ordered separately could done  Anywho  ended getting 20 boneless  able split sauces  Sweet apricot raspberry chili   sauces ok  Raspberry chili could spicier  actual pieces chicken nice meaty  did few pieces extremely smaller rest counted piece  ordered side crinkle cut fries which $5  only because event  But amount crazy small $5    When first tried food truck really did enjoy food it  seems now lost importance quality  also kinda bummed see sauces no longer names   Unfortunately last time buy food them  <EOR> This truck AMAZING  showed 5 minutes before close we thought closing hour later we're those kinds jerks proceeded order pretty much everything menu    pickles sweet potatoes  fried pickles delightful  Crispy crunchy pickle flavor enjoyed  rest party really loved sweet potato tots nice texture liked them until tasted sweet potato  According friend big fan sweet potato best she ever had    They also potstickers which sounds odd wings truck but awesome Asian BBQ fusion  Imagine really good potstickers classy Asian restaurant  drizzled wing sauce believe ranch sauce  mastered crispy outside soft chewy middle cooking style    And now main event wings  Oh dear mother God wings  Before even talk flavor need talk succulence chicken  never wings moist tender point start chewing just gets better  skin outside crispy all right places while still having little chewy spot  accidentally ordered two orders spicy instead spicy sweet didn't try sweet  spicy level 2 5 5  wasn't hot just sake being hot which big pet peeve mine    The first taste sauce smokiness then just pop heat  literally licking fingers despite pile napkins side  prices completely reasonable $8 six wings side fries portions generous the chicken wings all least 3 inches long meaty full basket pickle slices side ranch everything  If chance try truck it   I would happily give them 5 stars if bigger social media presence but stands update facebook twitter maybe twice month hard know where plan going  <EOR> I'm waiting order right now haven't tried food yet   taking forever     no front when placed order   wings amazing change review but doubt to  <EOR> Experience good guy taking order food truck really nice  wings crispy which great  Although asked hot when ordered buffalo bill wings tasted VERY mild  could just matter opinion though    THEY DONT SERVE BLEU CHEESE!! What's wing place without bleu cheese?! <EOR> So 2 visits place   Once First Friday once StrEATs still sure think place  review going average two experiences   A combo box $8 comes 1 lb  wings usually 6 because some serious chicken wings macaroni salad basic dinner roll some ranch dressing ridiculously good   The sauces pretty amazing 2 experiences   The 1st time wings OK but breaded fried which fan all when comes wings  Feinberg sauce which amazing opinion  Just right balance sweet apricot spicy  If wings breaded consistency soft full grizzle then may enjoyed them little more  The 2nd time wings Buffalo Bill wings which perfect They very spicy wings almost big around long  perfectly deep fried  Next time though probably just skip combo box since didn't even eat mac salad dinner roll  Just wings $1 cheaper   Other wings pretty unique menu things like Fried Potstickers Fried Pickles Mozzarella sticks course wings regular wings breast tenders   I'm going try place few more times few more options wings before more consensus conclusion  <EOR> So going consecutively every Saturday Food Truck Lineup Tommy Rocker's    lot Love Food Trucks different flavors bring  ecstatic find Sin City Wings going again even though nobody wanted join me    still went!
