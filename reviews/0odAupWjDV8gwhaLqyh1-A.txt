It's outlet mall It's better MUCH better food court junk Friendly burrito rappers Lots seating The food fresh The guac excellent And view all people taking selfies    selfie STICK  The only place eat here  <EOR> I've coming Chipotle years  always order same items never issue  past two times they've informed now count toppings sides kids meal  does really mean? Taco meal comes three sides choose your choice rice beans meat fair enough   However now stating extra $1 per topping count your sides cheese salsa hot sauce sour cream   I'd love hear topping equivalent rice beans meat? Also few sprinkles cheese taco $1? <EOR> Not sure why rating low here   far BEST chipotle ever too!   Great quality steak clean well air conditioned fast AMAZING customer service!  Way better any other location before!! <EOR> I swear @Chipotle branch Vegas stingy  ordered salad bowl there's 15 small lettuce slices  bitch bring your own lettuce to the restaurant day? <EOR> Worst chipotle to!  Quality food subpar compare other locations to  most all workers very very rude  would skip location future  Management should train workers specially location  <EOR> Stopped lunch quality food expected  steak bowl chips salsa  disappointing thing bag chips mostly broken  Service ok dining area clean  Overall good place grab bite avoid food court  <EOR> I see why particular Chipotle bad reviews lol  Earlier today wanted kids meal two tacos chips etc  know kids meal comes paper tray thats fine but asked very respectfully if rice meat hot sauce inside taco rather getting paper tray having myself  She swore couldn't but every time Chipotle kids meal always ask if just put everything inside never issue WHY ISSUE EARLIER? written rule customers don't know about? mandatory put own rice everything inside taco myself because kids meal? Because ordered over 100 same combo first time told NO  MAD just bought wife food just told cashier didn't want food he trashed it  cashier nice ask if anything he help but just ignored because angry  didn't even full pieces chicken taco crumbs lol  wife mad didn't order anything just talked into ordering again just order two tacos them selfs without getting kids meal cashier very nice comped order which would $4 dollars whatever  name Micheal  He should raise thank Micheal! Tell your coworkers stop talking each other while helping customers  talk listen music whatever when no making orders  Cmon now! <EOR> I guess when work hang play tic tac toe manager watching winning laughing it  While doing ALL co workers hanging telling each other bout doing last night   All going while tables leftover trays crumbs all over them    Buyer beware location extremely tight portions!! <EOR> For quick healthy meal little other options to  love convenience fast meal also pretty healthy    My burrito bowl steak guacamole  always brown rice black beans no sour cream cheese hot salsa guac  am big soda drinker but can't help but obsessed Dr  Pepper side meal    If never side chips salsa guacamole highly recommend stop reading review some! Ive said other reviews am picky chips salsa but damn  some best!   Also recommend burritos quesadilla style think? Where add layer cheese tortilla before wrap all if super hungry  good  <EOR> Eat atleast twice week food good most time sick sometime  sick least five times six months  believe should take more steps delivering quality product <EOR> I cant even begin app used said open until 10pm  find close 9pm  right 9 find door locked restaurant full people  called double check fact correct place we could see them answer phone talk us app said closed 10pm  showed them asked them honor fact app said 10 still food line  refused turned away specifically uber'd location because advertised closing time believe TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE received  Im pretty disappointed its no surprise such low rating  <EOR> Great food!
