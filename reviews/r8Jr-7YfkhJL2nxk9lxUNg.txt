The food always fast delicious  service wonderful  love homemade Salsa Carnitas Quesadillas  We back  <EOR> I think just found legit good Mexican cuisine restaurant Vegas!   I first discovered place when invited girlfriends family month ago April 2015  Once walking thought ran into head isn't going good  Call picky whatever but Mexican cuisine restaurants Vegas mostly miss mark taste bland  Sometimes think because easy beans rice burrito  Really?   I recommend try chile relleno something wouldn't order normally because don't more there's other stuff more  took girlfriends sisters recommendation also heard wasn't all super spicy ordered dish  girlfriend cooks probably best chicken enchiladas ever! tried just chicken enchiladas red sauce  She also tried something she normally wouldn't raved good was  taste indeed delicious  Nice balance spice overpowering chicken full flavor  rice beans also nice addition since somehow wrong other restaurants   Verdict pretty good  food tasted quite delicious felt homemade  chips salsa aren't world but come chips salsa before your meal  also added guacamole if your sharing say your friend significant other it'll do  good great just nothing complain   The service excellent  party 9 refilled drinks took order properly professional demeanor   Overall liked eager revisit  So did! Three weeks later   Let just say second visit just two just good might say better! didn't know Puerco Pibil! excited since probably most complex dish ever created own twenties wondering good would taste   People Yelp please try dish! AMAZING!  Just right amount citrus spice not overly spicy served tortillas rice black beans! so good  Damn stomach rumbling   This place hopefully continue surprise try something different every future visit    The ambiance perfect  feel your someone kitchen whipping some amazing Mexican food   I give 4 5 just because haven't tried most menu but promising enough earn business  <EOR> Had dinner friends because vegetarian menu options  personal diet very low carb moment resigned myself salad  ended having cochinita pibil achiote marinated pork baked banana leaf subbed side salad rice beans  delicious savory touch spicy all salty which downfall Mexican pork dishes    staff friendly attentive water glass never sat empty quiet mellow inside despite having good evening crowd  definitely visit again  <EOR> Great chips salsa nachos pork enchiladas   50+ times drive 25 minutes It   staff great too  <EOR> Always outstanding  Brett loves pork  but today conference call tacos  <EOR> The food very good really environment  dad lunch ordered couple margaritas  am necessarily margarita fan but mood tasty  Simple good  ordered some bean dip appetizer which excellent  such SIMPLE appetizer but perfect  melted cheese pico top  mixed little salsa man good   For entrees ordered couple tacos taquitos chile relleno  Everything delicious  Well seasoned  best rellenos ever had    The only possible complaint service  little slow two different servers  don't know if trying help another but would cross over service  example both them asked different times if finished ready bill  But other small issue happy  am definitely going back  <EOR> Not bad but great wither  food just OK  Service good if neighborhood again would probably give another but would special trip one! <EOR> Sorry knock your rating down but 3 4 times since first review guys just consistent  Sometimes food good other times there's brand new chef  Last visit stale chips watered down horchata waiter never came back table  won't back  <EOR> Frank Fina's best!

However if looking authentic Mexican food but actually dumbed down sour cream cheddar topped version definitely enjoy place  staff also very friendly which why am giving place another star  <EOR> This place awesome!
