Is subtle??? The barbacoa DELICIOUS!!!  A bit greasy side but nothing can't fix couple napkins   I say Burritos Juarez found new customer   Prices could bit cheaper tacos since use small size tortillas but charging Roberto's pricing and Roberto's uses larger corn tortillas I definitely recommend place anyone won't regret it     That being said review want add something place people talking Chicos tacos  Chicos Tacos restaurant El Paso Texas and also used Juarez Parque Borunda if recall correctly but closed down while back    think Chicos Tacos acquired taste people love them hate them   type style basically small flautas or people call taquitos served small paper container similar ones used nachos   then drenched soaked broth type soup watery tomato liquid topped off american cheese   I personally prefer regular traditional Mexican flautas cheese Mexican style crema not sour cream   <EOR> The food ok place but lady owner gossip says horrible things people ! want associated place ! <EOR> I stopped yesterday n reg chile relleno burrito w mayo tried steak sopes first time pretty good just wish used Mexican cream instead reg sour cream  Other sopes nice fried so little greasier would prefer but wouldn't real traditional Mexican other way! enjoyed it  <EOR> As sit across form Desert Breeze park waiting friend while using nearby free wifi signal enjoying tasty over sized Talapia fish tacos breakfast burrito w tasty chips salsa n realized write review worthy Mexican restaurant! Burrito's Juarez offers authentic Juarez Mexican food owner hard working mom 3 employees nice  Everything made fresh place kept clean convenient take park   Their Chico's Tacos told Burrito's Juarez only place making them Las Vegas Buche also available Horchata Jamaica made fresh powder   Ole' Burrito's Juarez thanks definitely back! <EOR> This bomb! typing thinking pico de gallo carne asada burrito   simple but family feel burrito shop   usually during lunch time staff always friendly polite  All ingredients very fresh beans told made daily   For mexican food small shop drunken late night pick something snack because always greasy but place isn't that   pico de galo BEST!! hate tomatoes if any sense but eat stuff days    When chance check place out  <EOR> Oh  Mah  GAWD!!!  So am ADDICTED nachos!!  *drools just thinking them*  Unfortunately nachos literally only thing tried so really review nachos in case ya haven't already figured out  hehe First off service GREAT!  family owned operated ALWAYS pleasant  an added bonus already know getting when see walk in!  place your order someone bring chips salsa   verde sauce best!  Wen your food ready bring your table of which 6 7 choose     The only drawback recently changed soda machine switched over offering canned soda water which guess adds authenticity but unappealing for order soda     So those nachos own chips of course little thicker then processed storebrand tortilla chip   good since withstand various wet ingredients still CHIP not pile mush! Piled top delicious chips is carne asada meat perfectly seasoned tender pinto beans not sauce just naked happy eaten mouthwatering pico de gallo sour cream guacamole queso fresco I believe    much person unless grossly overeat even when fiance ate fat people still barely finished TOGETHER!! Also nachos $6 30!!  great deal!  So check place if you're area  I'm pretty sure won't disappointed! <EOR> Well found little place yelp reading reviews decided fam just try it  When only table occupied figured would quick  Wrong  we ordered couple tacos burrito torta some chicos tacos everyone raves about  Took over 30 mins food  burrito good tacos soggy bland sauce chicos tacos more glorified fideo broth  top forgot two tacos order then nerve upset when called inform them coming back them  Overall burrito isn't enough keep coming back  disappointing!! <EOR> After walking TC's Ribs today place decided instead  same strip mall looked pretty promising    We walked looked reminiscient Roberto's though much cleaner inside  Dad ordered two Carne Asade burritos decided try Machaca  both thought strange place doesn't rice but still decided give chance   The Chips Salsa came first best part entire meal  tasted homemade pico de gallo AMAZING  can't say same other salsas provided which just alright   Both burritos extremely bland  didn't taste bad but definently very little flavor  also bummer put beans Machaca Burrito   the guy counter even asked if wanted them said no    I probably won't coming back again but say employees really friendly food cheap  <EOR> This place easy overlook  tucked away corner small strip mall off Durango if you're driving easy miss sign  never seen ad Burritos Juarez marketing isn't helping bring bodies in  shame because judging two visits place worth stop if you're area   The dining area small but clean large photos Juarez Mexico decorating space  other small taquerias order counter they'll call your number when your food ready   The carne asada taco $2 75 very good  beef juicy tender nice change pace rubbery meat served many other places  Each taco served 2 corn tortillas filled beans onions cilantro  Other stuff guacamole sour cream extra  only complaint tortillas limp little soggy  miss Taqueria Los Parados used crisp tortillas little cheese griddle  carnitas taco $2 75 decent but could used lot more seasoning   Their churro $1 50 pretty good but little firm   The chicken mole burrito $4 wasn't big other burritos around town but 4 bucks piece good value  mole some decent depth flavor  Burritos filled beans your choice meat  Anything else cost extra  If you're really hungry two   The guy behind counter also did some cooking seems genuinely nice guy  if don't speak Spanish don't worry  Gringos welcome  sure if I'd drive across town come but if want quick reasonably priced Mexican food Spring Valley stop by  <EOR> Props Sarah N  review otherwise I'd never thought coming here   Mexican kick lately dunno why     I've Chicos tacos twice amazing!

Really? Anyway probably should paid more attention menu    The burrito came pretty skinny  flavor beef wasn't great everything tasted pretty bland  Most flavor came cheese which very good btw sour cream  also give salsa squeeze bottles which nice never seen before Mexican place  red sauce nice smokey flavor green sauce OK though usually fan green sauces    I may visit place again  pretty close work prices reasonable $7 xx burrito soda would $5 change if hadn't opted extra toppings some other menu items look pretty tasty  employees super nice place really clean but based burrito great  <EOR> I props again boss suggesting eat Burrito's Juarez   reading review cousin wrote Mexican restaurant made want eat food   However way far where didn't feel driving all way   Luckily found location much closer   We ordered two Fish Tilapia Tacos each shared Tortilla Chips pico degallo ordered guacamole   did boss describe fish tacos? California Fish Taco's supposedly standards California best fish tacos   did agree fish tacos awesome   combination between crunch fish cabbage soft tortilla married well   They're huge two more enough each person     As Tortilla Chips different crunchier most places them from   pico degallo best guacamole well just mushed avocado   used having onions little tomato jalapeno   But still good   Tonight decided eat again tried Chico's Tacos   Taquito drenched red spicy sauce   wasn't spicy   enough kick it   If wanted hotter provide hot sauce add it   didn't need it  perfect way was   I'm definitely coming back because really want try corn concoction   think called Elcote   sure   probably come back review corrections  <EOR> Found place yelp right behind house whole time never in    All say food AWESOME service great atmosphere great   <EOR> Small little place stuck corner shopping center   sure if you'll notice unless looking   small curb side sign but dozen taco stands display same way easy overlook   I've couple burritos favorite carne asada beef tender juicy   also nachos which very different   chips layered your choice meat asado marinated pork beans pico guacamole sour cream cotija cheese   add jalapenos if like   Very good overall decent prices  <EOR>
