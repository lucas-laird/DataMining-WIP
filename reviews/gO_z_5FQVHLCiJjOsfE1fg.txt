What stands among other Brazilian restaurants town service standards  restaurant expectation any guest gets seat should come back folded napkin seat pushed back if left out  love concept dining being treated valued guest  wish more restaurants invested time winning patronage  Additionally managerially presents obtrusive guests  use hand signals eye contact keep watch staff draw attention details  excellent training because when guest motions servers more observant  dined restaurants eye contact body language ignored due ignorant waiting staff foreign customs poor training  prompts guests seat call restaurant tacky   My favorite server Fidel  usually ask when visit  Although all servers restaurant work seamlessly together Fidel stands among rest  When ask something lamb chops he puts order checks back when expect them  When am done he asks if want more  When tell am ready Salmon he kitchen well  He sure water never less half full he pushes pulls chair when sit down he never seems act though he rushed bothered  He never feel am eating entire restaurant lamb chops shrimp  He truly feel am only guest    Definitely come restaurant hungry!

WRONG!   I'll start off salad bar  very tiny compared its competitors  small section lettuce toppers your own salad some specialty cold cuts cheeses few hot items some cold salads  Blah  Nothing stood but obviously salad bar just filler  Skip if all possible    The sides  good selection but again nothing really stood also fillers  steak fries which thick fries actually skinny don't know why call them steak fries fried banana mashed potatoes yucca fries sautéed mushrooms  All served your meal unlimited     The rodzio style dinner left something desired  said all Sterling dinner  21 meats menu may tried 15  because did offer others  offered shrimp garlic bread flank steak ton times yet expensive meats such filet offered sparingly  When finally brought filet table everyone opted some  wrapped bacon which hardly cooked made filet chewy overly salty  Most took bacon off  When came around again asked if could filet without bacon said sure would 10 minutes  No problem  am joking when say did filet good 40 minutes even talked manager said she would asap  She did mention filet offered table 3 times which interesting keep track that  guess throw back your face when complain? sorry   $50 person enough warrant more 3 trips table prime meats? Disgusting    Side note place busy all Sunday night 5 30 maybe 8 10 tables am sure deal was  Most meats did good  enjoyed top sirloin filet without bacon  can't look past bad service fact weren't offered all meats paid for  Looking menu now never saw lamb shank pork ribs tangy chicken salmon Brazilian pork  sat big round table back restaurant corner kinda feel just shoved off side ignored  Oh another thing prepared eat dark  lights down low can't even tell which meat which your eating  Super annoying  wanting ambiance but little far    And finally icing cake told them grandma's birthday wanted piece cheesecake favorite dessert brought caramel flan  hell! She doesn't even flan  didn't care accommodate any requests all  paying dessert although should comped spending $350 but still couldn't right  Extremely extremely disappointing  expressing concerns manager she did take $10 off everyone's dinner which only why gave them star  But won't save them  Texas DE Brazil out  never step foot place again  <EOR> Same prices but nothing food Texas de Brazil   Would never opt come again comparison option Texas de Brazil   don't filet mignon without bacon least no garlic sirloin   Garlic mashed potatoes weren't awesome  <EOR> Ok family welcomed staff  meats delicious suckling pig could crispier  warm rolls but side rice veggies kept running out   We waiter 5 times keep plates filled  selection however very discerning palate  good kids all picky eaters since variety limited  Think alot cheeses weird pasta dishes    wouldn't come again unless some else paid desserts drinks extra  family four 2 adults 1 child 1 free infant drinks came $160+ tip  Yup   should've gone Carnival Rio  <EOR> The food excellent loved bacon wrapped filet great <EOR> Took granddaughter birthday   place marvelous   salad bar fresh varied  meat kept coming    servers friendly informative   come again   <EOR> We impressed   Service very attentive food excellent   Tuesday night when 1 2 price bottles wine   We highly recommend place   frequent Brazilian food top notch!

Round 1 Ambience may come down personal preference since definitely upscale vibe soothing waterfalls romantic lighting upon entering VB but sure if liked feng shui salad bar middle without any partitioning tables into separate little rooms added intimacy   TDB definitely more upbeat vibe casual bar area where await guests separate little rooms although definitely more crowded noisy since more bustling turnover guests    Winner Push  Round 2 Cheese bread If took most perfect cheese puff turned into bread form pretty much pinnacle transformation   TDB slightly cheesier flavor which gives slight edge   Winner TDB  Round 3 Salad bar For first timers or call them churrascarookies never want overfill your plate salad bar tempting may be   However good wet one's appetite some items balance meat fest come   felt overall quality superior salad bar TDB since offered lobster bisque focused more artisanal cheeses light seafood veggies options whereas VB many pasta options cheese ravioli other pasta salads which underhanded tactics fill limit your meat intake   Winner TDB  Round 4 Beverages VB took knockdown round since waiter sat down presented options water still sparkling? upon choosing still he charged two bottles some premium water 7 bucks bottle without clueing option tap water since assumed complementary   also failed carry Antarctica Guarana most popular soda Brazil something look forward anytime venture into Brazilian restaurant   TDB would never allow water fiasco occur always carry non alcoholic beverage choice    Winner TDB  Round 5 Opening meats Surprisingly VB opens baked salmon served passion fruit mango sauce    not expected but really good table side presentation nice touch   Usually TDB start off some non premium beef wrapped thick bacon some heavy pork chicken option   Winner VB  Round 6 Lamb Leg lamb sufficiently juicy came nice mint jelly but TDB offers multiple cuts including lamb chop which unavailable VB   Winner TDB  Round 7 Fowl VB definitely some interesting options including chicken duck chicken hearts upon request whereas TDB only single dry chicken option which tend pass over allow more room other meat options   chicken duck very succulent tender well seasoned here   Winner VB  Round 8 Brazilian sausage Like cheese bread fairly standard being huge sausage connoisseur best judge one   Winner Push   Round 9 Side dishes Taking intermission meats think VB offers some additional Brazilian sides fried boiled yucca root sauteed turnip greens which more stir fried crispy preparation compared stewed version soul food   Traditional favorites such fried bananas mashed potatoes present both   Winner VB  Round 10 Beef Maybe pace meats brought table but felt overall quality beef cuts superior TDB since few cuts overly dry tough VB although certain cuts very tender flavorful   WInner TDB  Round 11 Service Waitstaff definitely more attentive TDB pace meat parade more even didn't feel overcrowd plate lose track which meat which   TDB meat carvers also wear uniform gives them some more professional flare which appreciated   WInner TDB  Round 12 Value Somewhat tied into service server initially took groupon voucher beginning but conveniently left off final bill until reminded him   Taking account variety quality meats salad bar would give slight edge TDB     Winner TDB  By decision winner fight Texas de Brazil but don't count Via Brasil rematch   new fierce challenger recently arrived into town Fogo de Chao TKO may midst! <EOR> Excellent food excellent service really large selection meats  Huge salad bar few extra hot entrees   All eat reasonable price <EOR> After reading reply owner review clearly see why experience restaurant bad  only does she know write but she doesn't know run restaurant  She's also incorrect statement finished meat dishes  She came while tried eat flank steak sure she could see having hard time chewing it  She offered bring some ribeye never ordered she said more tender  more tender but half fat couldn't eat that  She ended charging flank steak spit ribeye didn't order short rib which disgusting  <EOR> we've eaten lot restaurants lot states   1  service  imperial  2  staff  imperial  smiling door table  table door gerardo louis   ohmygoodness  first both delectable delicious eye candy service     the staff sweet thoughtful caring      3  drinks  top line  tippie top line! management sweet loving fun exciting   im telling texas de brazil  second fiddle    we frequent flyers   p s  hubs filled comment card  first 20 years!  happy anniversary mr mrs aivin smith! <EOR> I figured since Newton C come often happy hour menu frequently changes why don't write another review?

Valentine's dinner?  Riiiight    So thank Via Brasil   you actually did huge favor  Rather waiting until nearly 10 pm eat your obnoxiously loud crowded restaurant across street Honey Salt sat right away   amazing meal probably half cost would paid your restaurant  Funny thing Honey Salt   they recognized couples eat nice restaurant Valentine's Day actually brought extra tables accommodate more patrons   GENIUS!

The decor upscale suggests kind place some snoot appeal where people may come seen but let's face suburban restaurant restaurant would risk alienating down to earth folks overly haughty attitude days?  Via Brasil gets just right 'hardware' upscale formal but staff service engaging friendly without any pretentiousness whatsoever   When arrived immediately noticed many parties children   although couldn't help but note all seemed seated front section restaurant maybe staff consciously trying keep back part large open dining area somewhat kid free quiet   didn't matter entire dining room beautiful food same regardless GPS cell your table in!

Oh because cheap brunch $29 but pay for    They zero business serving Brazilian meat    Their meat flavorless obviously cook meat super cold  meats never red nor pinkish always dull brown    If filet mignon eggs Benedict hollandaise sauce taste just lemon  filet zero seasoning    Their salad bar even worse   cous cous over cooked soups just everything POOR QUALITY    I honestly feel only older people enjoy place because price those really refined pallet    Has owner manager actually ate food? If still serve #SlapYourself <EOR> The food great! service very good  staff seem actually enjoy serving you  took some friends 28 year anniversary  really enjoyed trying different meats  Thanks Via Brazil making experience memorable  <EOR> There's already ton reviews just hit some highlights   If want meat dinner good choice   Yes salad bar lot nice items but vegetarians never full value place   said other Brazilian places town probably best   looks nice inside food quality quite high   price while high general sense pretty competitive within Brazilian market   So why five stars?  sure last visit quite recent quite good   But past experienced some knocks others noted   Specifically waiters seem walk right table while sit sometimes long time waiting more meat   Also past also experienced certain level grief when trying use coupon place sent me!  If problem don't send me!
