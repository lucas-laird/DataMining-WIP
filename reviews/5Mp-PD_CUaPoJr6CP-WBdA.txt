I love Rubios fish tacos closest thing real deal baja   when checked into Monte Carlo pleasantly surprised see Rubios there  Since store Vegas far mother ship southern California bit apprehensive  prices bit higher your stand alone restaurant   fish tacos 3 99   nonetheless try some  Let tell best Rubios fish tacos date eaten almost every San Diego L A   plus fish huge ordered 3 but should stuck two   my taste buds telling more more more but body screaming elastic   this store great <EOR> I don't normally review chain restaurants but Rubio's probably tastiest place Monte Carlo  ate walking lousy ramen joint here  Yes cafeteria food basically but knock park  fish tacos point reasonably priced  <EOR> The food decent but customer service absolutely horrible!  And pricing better <EOR> First credentials briefly native New Jerseyan but travel nation work  When first heard fish taco co worker L A  thought Disgusting! Then vacation tried behest friend Pacific Beach San Diego    changed forever   But bar set high   Thankfully Rubio's authentic fish taco maker   chain similar Baja Fresh other Fresh Mex grills but glaring exception fish taco   others fish tacos but Rubio's mastered art   Having Rubio's conveniently located food court Monte made more well liked casinos become preferred casino   routine back right food court DELICIOUS taco dinner 2 fish street taco some fresh salsas soda wash down then hit casino some great gambling lower minimums most strip   But food no brainer   Inexpensive easy quick relatively ever delicious Rubio's Monte Carlo visit several times each trip Las Vegas   well worth it  <EOR> I going Rubio's past few years use good however last night husband decided stop before drive back Utah DISAPPOINTMENT!  first time ever experienced such terrible food Rubio's     very surprised   food hot fresh   Typically Rubio's fresh menu but bad never back    drive different less convenient location but something edible $24 <EOR> Try fish tacos  Decent food fair price Vegas  <EOR> Lunch time  Satisfactory fast food  Citrus rice black beans lukewarm  Probably sitting under warmer but hadn't reached point where tell they've sat long time    I added cilantro onion mix dress citrus rice tastier plain presentation    The black beans satisfactory  say? big fan black beans but came meal   I ordered enchilada special which included shrimp chicken  Both came some cheese inside chicken sure think shrimp too  say yes because tasted very little shrimp lot something else which assuming cheese   The enchilada corn tortilla soft tad firm representing good enchilada liking  tasted if rolled enchilada cold tortilla warmed served  amount chicken shrimp minimal but lots cheese add your your fat cholesterol  Towards end unrolled hard tortilla picked meat leaving abundance cheese  Yes lots cheese imo good cheese    I'm giving two stars only because skipped breakfast having late lunch  hungry many times food tastes better is  don't know why tortured myself eating unhealthy   Did finish plate? No   Would eat enchiladas again?

The steak bacon tacos barely edible  wanted try something different since don't chain Windy City but impressed  food terrible McDonald's it!  Visit Date 11 16 09 <EOR> This place terrible chicken quesadilla wasn't great but only 30 mins before show seeing started  Moral story show shittin vomiting last 18 plus hours  being said give place two middle fingers hope shutdown  <EOR> Went good meal disappointed! Everything menu sounded good but decided salad such good portion ate off twice! great grilled vegetables which added some great dimension flavor could've bland salad different mixed greens savory dressing perfect! Also came good portion chicken huge pieces! All all would definitely again pleased felt satisfied salad! <EOR> About good gets fast food  usually terrified eating seafood fast food joints but exception Rubio's  fish tacos surprisingly good     fish tastes fresh supposedly raised sustainable way  quite few varieties constantly rotating new concepts onto menu  Burritos nachos also very solid options  Rubio's only short walk away Aria if need some late night grub don't feel sitting Cafe Vettro Rubio's great option <EOR> This place isn't really worth it  steak burrito especial  really stingy guacamole chipotle sauce all end burrito  Food wasn't very flavorful  Everyone table issues tortilla cracking falling apart point just ate fork  Steak juicy good however  feel $14 drink should gotten decent helping guac seasoned food  Better off going chipotle tbh  <EOR> The food decent but guy working register unnecessarily rude condescending  ordered grilled fish taco plate really seemed confuse him  Customer service seems worse worse  <EOR> Beer battered fish tacos win! amazing but sometimes overly fried though fish itself always tender moist  Add some salsa more flavor  bit expensive side simple fried fish tacos  would also consider trying burritos fish burritos shrimp burritos LOBSTER BURRITOS which all amazing    Regardless 2 tacos burrito comes w chips guarantee full! <EOR> This place does pay attention doing   ordered chicken gave shrimp   am highly allergic shrimp   brought them counter argue cashier give money back   All done open taco look saw shrimp   Eating would put hospital   place if allergic shrimp because stood watched cook cross contamination everywhere   Never again  life worth more taco  <EOR> Worst steak tacos life  Took bite nearly spit out  Chicken ok  Jesus steak though  Unbelievably bad  Dog food best  <EOR> After seeing prices Diablo Cantina $18 quesadilla insane! ate Rubio's inside food court  thought delicious different Salsa choices  far Monte Carlo concerned I'd recommend any places food court any other restaurants anchor casino  <EOR> How does place 4 star rating?
