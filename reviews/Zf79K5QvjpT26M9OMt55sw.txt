I became sick Tilapia today  waitress called over manager she bullied into own belief fish fresh?  became immediately vomited Restroom  treated guests never become ill during meal   embarrassing service received horrendous!! <EOR> The Mongolian grill all eat here  Unfortunately grill guy beyond rude  wife gave bowl received no noodles upon grilling  He rolled eyes said didn't tell nothing   Put chow mein over there  turn came ordered same thing  He clearly sabotaged dish swimming sauce  beyond salty   Like he was! The manager kind enough offer walking right but does coach correct bad employee bad attitude  He may spit food! They're probably union do? Shame Stations such low standards service  <EOR> So decided take advantage Two price coupons sent lunch buffet party 4   passed smoke filled casino things better  quickly seated hostess very pleasant smiles   waitress Sylvia extremely nice very attentive  never ask refills drinks she removed dirty plates quicker any other buffet experienced  food good  found nothing old dry  Everything quickly replenished cooks  plenty good choices every category  desserts exceptional well   also plenty choices! All staff wonderful  definitely returning again again  reason only gave 4 stars instead 5 because smoke casino floor tends wander into dining area unpleasant while trying eat  Otherwise great place eat definitely recommend it! <EOR> Where start? Hawaii buffet 12 99 players card good deal right? Nope food horrible  First off poi definitely frozen fresh those little serving cups made ridiculous   grab 9 those fill small bowl  poke fish same swear more onions fish  spam fried rice highlight dinner  bbq pork pretty good if fresh batch  Apparently know difference between roast pig kalua pig  basically pig looked liked hacked axe  No shredded pig whatsoever being just randomly hacked meat dry   On flyers door laulau mentioned  When asked where said don't serve there  let's move onto sweet stuff     malasadas definitely no Leonards but suggestion eat hot  Once cools may chip tooth  pineapple upside down cake ok but really mess up? Now haupia  Oh guessing way much cornstarch  couldn't stop laughing  picked bounced off plate ball  waitstaff nice though kept serving flat soda even mentioned it   But what's saying? paid for     well feel robbed  suggestion take your 12 bucks eat regular Hawaiian restaurant better yet wait till Saturday pay more Silvertons Hawaiian buffet way worth 20 bucks  All know gonna ask partial refund since all really ate rice  <EOR> I'm sorry say worst station owned buffet   selection very limited  food dried but still line  empty foods aren't replenished unless ask  won't visit again <EOR> Congratulations getting 1st star review  food buffet terrible  always seems bland wrong   The fried food tastes its under heat lamp all day  Sometimes meat tough sometimes its dry but usually never just right    I actually made vow never eat again even free comps  bad  If want something cheap decent check Denny's just few steps away  <EOR> good menu saint patricks day  food cold certain sections  waitress slow clear tables if your looking buffet budget don't care flavor would looking for    <EOR> Superb staff clean quality food great price   If your nearby place entire family  <EOR> I twice week disappointed   am limited eat right now due dental surgery but good selection choose from   Swai fish delicious!  stuffing also outstanding taste!
