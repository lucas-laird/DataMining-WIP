A previous highlight Scallop Shrimp Garlic Anchovy Cream Spaghetti  time started off Parma Prosciutto Mushroom Salad $9 75    now recall being any mushroom salad all   definitely prosciutto greens drizzling extra virgin oil oil salt pepper fresh squeeze lemon juice   decent but now wondering mushrooms   The Husband ordered Vongole Spaghetti Red Sauce $16 which ultimately pasta clams   offered dish red white wine sauce came off daily specials board   The real winner choice Japanese Pumpkin Chicken Cream Sauce $15 which also came off daily specials board   say really know cream sauces here   good fatty just done well!  Yum!  usually biggest fan chicken dishes but something tender perfectly cooked poultry dish   immediately impressed Husband equally surprised tender those little morsels were   safely say cream sauces just wow no end!   Service waitresses really nice job including bringing extra dishes could share things that   Things note soft drinks bottle don't come soda machine   don't forget your gift certificate restaurant com!    Like said stick daily specials board other unique entrees leave sushi typical stuff your regular Japanese restaurant  <EOR> My husband just lunch even though  didnt remember take pictures am pleased service cleanliness place  fried oysters  came salad rice little bit pasta  Very tasty!  husband sort chicken he also pretty happy  waitress really sweet  I'd would back there  <EOR> Great experience!
