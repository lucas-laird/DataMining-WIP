Cool right? place must try  #1 go to place when you're actually craving some great Korean barbecue some yummy sushi  D <EOR> Ok    kind indifferent place  food pretty good but opinion overpriced  atmosphere nice first but if really pay attention loses its appeal  waiter nice but barely spoke English being foreigner myself really annoys me  believe novelty places cook your own food but two waiters kept coming over messing heat flipping meat  am chef trust when say half time unnecessary  Over all good experience but must say extremely doubtful return  <EOR> I 3 years ago when throw farewell party couples going move Colorado  chose restaurant  honest food here To food except Japanese food tasted influenced western cuisine   The service pretty slow The bathroom clean The restaurant kind dark stuffy The price ok   I am kind wonder why rated 4 stars Yelp  am impressed  <EOR> Yes grand opening special $16 AYCE krn bbq great all but its still worth book    First off parking  IF place ever gets off where all customers park? everyone forced carpool? because literally only 20 spots its cramped lot  Gotta fix that  Secondly service  service didn't suck bad everyone else's but still bad  mean servers try nice all but did forget couple dishes  also don't mind them cooking however  much food turned burnt  boo  Lastly but most importantly food just good  really strong flavors both marinated bulgogi galbi bland taste  other meats also dry chewy   maybe indication stuff wasn't fresh? also lack variety AYCE appetizers  Sure gyoza steamed egg good all but wanted more  mean you're against all other AYCE krn bbq places Vegas   step yo  <EOR> This definately good place if you're craving korean food while vegas  Off strip which something love away being long    service eh    own menu took long order long food  only other table lunch  <EOR> Shilla Korean BBQ around quite sometime city Las Vegas  remember being first Korean BBQ restaurant I'd ever tried when family first moved Las Vegas 2005    That being said fell love potato salad which needless say only place town serves appetizers  nervous however ask Korean women sure secret recipe    I however recently back older sister Sunday supper place completely dead perhaps because Sunday everyone church I'd assume Anyhow order Kalbi Tang sister order Seafood Sundubu great  food point establishment clean tidy  place good customer service think only thing preventing Shilla getting more customers Sunday afternoon probably restaurant location  bit tucked away corner Sahara  <EOR> Came last week grand opening special during lunch thought ok  12 bucks AYCE Korean BBQ grand opening special great value thought meats some appetizers really good although service little lacking  Keeping mind business under new management might some kinks need ironing giving experience 3 star rating which really difficult because   well   just read review The interior little dated super hot inside most likely because grills every table everyone grilling same time  sure if big copper looking vents above each table work because silent but didn't think smelled bad leaving which good   We set crystal grill top when sat down thought pretty cool definitely retained heat lot better normal grill top non stick well  realized talking friends came subsequent days apparently 3 different types grill tops but think would still prefer crystal  still able grill meat 15 min flame turned off staff   this wouldn't possible traditional grill top  secret wait until crystal heats before placing meats top  staff did allow heat grill switching clean threw all meat top grill while still cold  pissed off especially because prefer cook own food don't appreciate them butting grabbing meat tongs off table especially if they're going screw wrong way  also kept trying serve cooked meat tongs used touch flip raw meat making little uneasy  sure why controlling!  Also appeared language barrier unable items needed such napkins water sauce refills additional orders  When servers came attempted communicate things needed each time  would confused look face acknowledge then never return item requested  asked 4 5 times more sauce before it  Same napkins  servers even blamed Michael K having plate even though she never brought one! WTF! If rate service alone it'd 1 star rating sure! bring Korean speaking friend expect ask 4 5 times everything need   Food quality better expected meats appeared fresh well marinated  favorites bone in galbi pork belly  Just don't let staff see cutting meat while raw give lecture waiting until cooked  Really? scissors tongs already touching raw meat? also them want cook serve your food you    if wanted then would gone Bennihana something    With all service issues am sure they'll ever good customer service rating   because they're definitely worth more grand opening special once price back normal would come back recommend place because you'll forever trying grill eat just 2 plates meat due service issues waiting your orders drinks napkins sauce etc   I also would recommend doing both sushi BBQ together   pick other sit designated section  Tony T sat room all table grills took forever sushi orders some them wrong confused something else  If want sushi sit sushi bar near front door! <EOR> I dont know its pronounced but always think http m youtube com watch?v=wbL2lMn34Oo   Due surrounding area Ive never thought trying Shilla until now  Since offering almost half off grand reopening special why not    When weekend lunch no problem parking even closest door  When left half capacity  If ever gets point where parking parking lot then theres some street parking along front   The interior seemed nice  3 dining areas sushi KBBQ another don't remember  could wrong but some decor seeemed more Japanese  Its just something noticed didnt bother anything   So down business  came chow down some Korean BBQ chow down mean eat until cant move kick out  Round 1 good quantity thinly sliced beef brisket  quality excellent  cooking surface clear crystal thing which kind doubting would cook meats but actually worked well no big raging flare no big clouds smoke gets your closes cooked meats same your normal metal grilling surface  Back beef brisket  taste good really didnt need any seasoning except if wanted little spicy dump some hot sauce it  Since thinly sliced cooked matter seconds   Round 2 short ribs! love short ribs especially korean style short ribs  dont even remembered many ate  wasnt overly marinated again excellent quality meat   Some people them cooked all way tough charred cook until right before charred   Round 3 pork belly  Its pork belly just cook all world right once start eating  gonna lie but completing Round 3 sweating little cause getting hot filling up  Took little break wipe sweat off face said Round 1 3 again same quantity    Round 4 5 breeze  Then decided offer some beef belly also brought plate full beef belly  Round 6 huge portion nothing but beef pork belly  pretty greasy Round 6 but good needed soda some salad cut grease  actually thinking doing all over again but seeing almost everyone arrive leave while feasting 2 hrs straight felt wanted STOP  Well didnt time limit but if later bad   The sides OK though really didn't try fill wasted stomach space  werent lot variety quality wasnt best Ive but edible   The service most part pretty good  occasionally placed meats grill cut them  refilled drinks sides plates meat  couple hiccups but nothing I'd ding them much on  When wanted start drinking soda middle eating elderly lady seemed forgotten ask another person bring it  When wanted bill took forever   Overall least AYCE KBBQ option give them 4 star cause thats only option mattered me  back again even when price regular quality better any other AYCE KBBQ places Ive Vegas  <EOR> Very clean  Very good servers even restaurant owner came table help cook meat   Excellent customer service  should try place  <EOR> Get down before August 1 grand opening special $11 95 lunch $15 95 dinner all eat sushi Korean BBQ if u want both add extra $5  Sushi Korean BBQ both decent extraordinary but nice able both same time AYCE  would consider meat slightly better Sura more meat selections better priced  <EOR> I yesterday best service ever restaurant  waiter helped grill constantly checked see if everything ok food great service everything A++++ pricing great well came around $18   I am going back Vegas Birthday next month try sushis  <EOR> Shilla Forilla!
