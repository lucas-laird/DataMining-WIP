Love place! <EOR> RUDE Rude Rude Nasty RUDE employee's  Never again  I work Airport send Passengers over  all time  Never again  Burger come  <EOR> Dude thought airport going horrible going starve death while waiting 8 hours plane flight again just worse planning could ever do but came Flatbreadz because seemed most sane calorie wise airport   I bit slow since much time but person helping wasn't pushy irritated   After yummy roast beef provolone sandwich perused condiment section which boasted all sorts insane condiments could ever want sandwich  slowly ate half sandwich then sat there   I sat because absolutely nothing do  People walked wondering why such young looking kid traveling alone Las Vegas maybe probably but didn't bother any  sat none workers complained me   You can't angry that! It also really good sandwich better ones ever eaten   Enjoy! <EOR> I use eat ALOT when use work airport  Mind worked Wolfgang Puck Chili's chose Flatbreadz restaurant choice lunch would trek side airport just favorite SOUTHWESTERN TURKEY BLT EXTRA CHIPOTLE MAYO!!!  Freshly made flatbread stuffed bacon guacamole lettuce tomatoe 5 slices turkey chipotle mayo       Who would thought simple type sandwhich would taste good???  When quit working airport would crave place finally visited year places JUST EAT BEFORE LEAVE VEGAS   IT BEATS GREASY CHILIS OVERPRICED BURGER KING OTHER RESTAURANTS B GATES!  Yah $11 combo but think its worth it! Just imagine all other money spent Vegas    $11 nothing all left haha     well place place spend your last dollar   I miss till meet again southwestern turkey blt extra chipotle!!! <EOR> I don't when flights Gate B area because aren't lot food choices there   360 burritos occupied spot another business use going but wasn't feeling them  Walked back Flatbreadz area made pick over Burger King   Honestly weren't bad being tiny pricey airport food   Spent least $10 roast beef provolone flat bread sandwich coffee  Right already ordered sandwich girl behind counter already started making sandwich tray some delicious looking breakfast pockets came oven   Kind missed those pockets line just those   roast beef provolone sandwiches came roast beef provolone cheese tomato thin flat bread horseradish dressing which them also add chipotle mayo  Enjoyed but could've used more maybe could've heated toasted melt cheese   wouldn't mind coming back if especially its only choice  <EOR> Had chicken pesto chicken noodle soup because didn't want Burger King    Basically sliced flatbread stuffed premade chicken pesto  actually wasn't bad but price expecting lot more  least option toasted? Chicken noodle good salty most  <EOR> From its name figured would use decent bread sandwich  Unfortunately bread really dry killed otherwise okay roast beef sandwich  <EOR> This review only breakfast pockets   We morning flight past Sunday hungry waiting board stopped place breakfast   ordered 2 breakfast pockets one myself husband    menu wall stated consists meat plus eggs cheese   Unfortunately sold those   Instead selling eggs cheese breakfast pockets   wasn't unhappy but charged full price which didn't think fair   When took first bite really good   hot bread chewy soft   Overall food good but need charge customer less if some ingredients left off item due shortages  <EOR> Never thought I'd write bad review pizza cause really screws pizza? but ew   Undercooked wayy cheesy and LOVE cheese way overpriced quality food service  Yes airport food but seriously   When dough more stringy mountain cheese somethings definitely wrong  Also menu unclear well workers  When order Bronx Bomber worker calls pepperoni am supposed know?! Because another customer accidentally ate pizza and super apologetic it only worker rude yelling everyone she made mistake now everyone wait because customer but she also extremely rude some reason  Should've gone Burger King instead  <EOR> We early flight 8AM passed Cinnabon smells good but decided eat healthier into Flatbreadz   ordered breakfast pocket ham cheese egg then breakfast plate scrambled eggs bacon biscuit potatoes   husband's platter cold food barely warm eggs when she scooped them pan she let them drain while yuck before putting plate   biscuit tasted nothing cold   Bacon ok  Cold greasy potatoes nope good thing   pocket heated heat lamp when took first bite almost gagged oil fried gone rancid   disgusting immediately said could eat gone bad   She offered egg cheese bagel instead which reluctantly took knowing husband's platter going satisfactory replacement   She heated wrapper panini maker which kinda strange but worked   cheese egg melted but tasted just gross don't know made honest   she left other remaining breakfast pocket under heat lamp I think she should thrown along mine   Checker kind friendly   rest staff seemed all break eating front dining room yelling friendly comments back forth back discussing purchase new tote bag gals   don't mind all early morning no big crowds but since first customers food should really fresh hot   instead am sure just left over stuff yesterdays breakfast    bleh!    Do yourself favor walk back Cinnabon  <EOR> There many things hate traveling    hassle going through security long waits long flight times    But really gets crappy food  McCarran worst airports far dining options concerned  Walking through terminal little excited when saw Flatbreadz  good concept but execution poor   I turkey BLT  deli slices turkey lettuce bacon tomatoes guacamole spread wheat flatbread  skipped chipotle mayo  whole thing underwhelming  something could put together myself $8 59 pricey as expected any airport food   Add water $3 19 tax total $12 73  <EOR> The absolute worst overpriced bland food ever  only majority breakfast items before 8am also coffee  really wanted warn patrons upon entry place bother  Complete disappointment  only item awful sitting quite awhile  Please don't waste your time  unfortunate because place looked very inviting  <EOR> Tried healthy bite eat instead junk food restaurants airport   Only person line ahead 4 employees doing nothing waited 5 minutes frustrated left   Why 4 employees would waste people's time beyond me   Instead Burrito place overpaid boatload calories didn't need   Will return?  might caught them off day try come again next time   now 2 Stars  <EOR> Airport food pretty ordinary but really enjoyed roast beef sandwich   liked substitutions big deal everything tasted looked fresh   friend turkey sandwich   bit bland thicker schmeer guacamole would helped  <EOR> The food surprisingly delicious  Sure doesn't compare Earl Sandwich however sure beats garbage eateries airport! Although price little steep very fresh scrumptious  recommend Turkey BLT Roast Beef Provolone  <EOR> Pesto chicken salad sandwich meal   Plenty pesto smothered lightly seasoned taste   chicken salad itself well balanced fun taste white raisins   works well cold sandwich   Recommended if want cold sandwich but hot one  <EOR> Not many options old terminal nice see them add something   Flatbreadz pizza breakfast deli sandwiches   opted southwest turkey bacon wrap   Cost $8 49 which airport isn't bad   sandwich good spicy quick bite before fight hit spot  <EOR> Rude horrible customer service! 1 Asian lady working ordered bagel cream cheese  She burns point black tries serve even bagel type ordered! She then continues mine process other orders  15 mins later finally received bagel also burnt again     Probably worst place ever visited customer service wise  YIKES <EOR> Pretty decent airport food  caught eye because sandwiches being prepared  TBLA Turkey Bacon Lettuce Avacodo sourdough bread  thought Avacodo spread nice transition traditional Mayo  didn't come Cheese which actually okay  lettuce Tomato good blended flavor  only thing didn't care didn't grilled heat bread pulled right bag  softest warmest sandwich    My Fiancé Pepperoni Onion Pizza  made order  Which really good  wasn't over powered Marinara sauce either  encourage joked food would recommend eatery light fresh   meal   <EOR> I don't expect much airport food expect less mediocre airport food Las Vegas'   But left hungry craving something Subway   Mind sure where better airport worst airports ever food  <EOR> It slowest service ever airport  There no start end place  sure order first then pay vice versa  Also isnt sure wait where sandwiches where want your salad ignoring salad counter  lady ahead fuming coz she unattended quite sometime just wanted pickup pepperoni pizza already made    About food though its mixed greens but since charge exorbitant amount just donot add arugula spinach toss over vinaigrette  joke when server put exactly 3 onion rings not even 3 full circular slices onion but when asked olives charge extra 65 cents  least provide food pay for   They dont trust customers lady al most told person making bill add 65 cents olives  wasnt going run away that  biller did open salad box even told exactly bought  shows much trust your customer   Rude service cheap food  <EOR> I wanted pepperoni pizza said pepperoni!  does pizza place run pepperoni? Anyway cheese olives pizza instead $10  fine came hot cheesy which all really ask airport pizza place  also offer sandwiches salads tiny fruit cups whooping $6 which cashier warned pay quickly returned its refrigerated shelf  Good looking cashier good looking out  <EOR> Taking time write review while rude staff insists making wait while talk friends  Then proceed help people line behind just arrived   After 10 minutes wife orders Uptown Works pizza  ordered nothing which standard practice when staff seems perturbed my wife said something them serving four other people behind first which didn't seem sit well    Will returning  <EOR> The Mrs shared turkey pesto liked it  Better other stuff around  lucky group people came still weren't served leaving  <EOR> Two stars only fact didn't food poisoning food edible  But honestly? SUCH high hopes place did live them! sandwich dry ingredients tasted little weird  Maybe fact mix pesto guac veggie sandwich their ONLY vegetarian option seems    kind weird flavor combo  lettuce wet made sandwich bit soggy  also wish they'd heated sandwich because cold would lot less gross if it'd heated  Anyway    place I'd visit again! <EOR> I use work Las Vegas Int  Airport D North Gates  place GOOD took shuttle bus through security all over again just eat lunch break! would always Sicilian Flat Bread Sandwich GOING GIVE SMILE END YOUR MEAL!  No words describe amazing sandwich is  eaten alot different sandwiches spots but HANDS DOWN BEST SANDWICH PLACE EATEN AT!!!  STOP TRY SICILIAN SANDWICH TRUST WONT REGRET IT! <EOR> I would give place zero stars if could  Ordered sandwich waited 10 min   went check if making order girl said would 3 5 min  Waited another 10 min nothing when asked second time where order she responded did order? Then needed manager order refund  All all wasted only half hour before flight  Save your self time o burger king   This place really needs evaluate staff  <EOR> This place fast food nice    I Cuban Tony    Which delicious juicy    But pressed menu picture was    real Cuban should be    IMHO    <EOR> 7am   at airport   where some veggies?  burger king   cinnabon   so figured sandwich place   ordered veggie sand   almost $10 figured best veggie sandwich EVER   well WORST ever   bread sucked   veggies all slimy   UGH   don't ever here    <EOR> They opened late 5 10 instead 5 00 took forever take order we first line unpleasant gave wrong order    We egg cheese breakfast pocket should ham egg cheese no sign any cheese breakfast pizza a twenty minute wait     The food okay  overall experience definitely subpar  <EOR> When eating airport restaurant know going expensive    no problem  But service guy making sandwiches needs help  He cheat sheet behind counter fix them STILL gets wrong  10 minute pizza took 25 minutes make  sure review but he needs more training  food bad just service needs help  <EOR> It amazing simple ham cheese sandwich satisfy your hunger such delicious way   At $8 ham cheese $5 Odwalla Flatbreadz bargain any means but if need quick fix before your layover then hits spot  <EOR> Well guess mostly mistake ordering salad airport restaurant but sure deserved food poisoning   I ordered kale arugula salad chicken actually tasted pretty good  leaving place walking back gate immediately started feeling off  long layover uncomfortable hour half hoping would pass    Then course 5 minutes before flight starts boarding things worse quick  rush bathroom pretty much barf whole salad  other stalls probably thought partied much Vegas!  The good news immediately felt better made onto flight few minutes spare   Won't mistake eating airport salad again definitely won't eat place anymore! <EOR> I Southwestern Turkey BLT sandwich Better other options airport Chilis Burger King ESPN Sports Bar heavy! $11 sandwich chips drink  sandwiches pretty bomb people sitting around agreed  know airport all but damn!!  expensive!! <EOR>
