More power guys! <EOR> If don't anything nice say then don't say The above phase something we're all used hearing when someone else unload beast criticism  usually tend avoid writing bad reviews but can't always play yelp hero right?   Lets even talk authenticity Filipino move straight food  tonkotsu broth well   terribad  smelled lot fish deep fried onions added slimy consistency each bite very strange  broth milky though      The chicken katsu curry well   also terribad  katsu very strange if made previously cut into strips skewered then deep fried upon ordering  Needless say very chewy  curry rice however very edible but same or maybe even better made blocks  If find yourself would just order curry   Skip water order beer    The decor cool very anime like service so    Unfortunately can't say adding Ray's ramen rotation but prices pretty cheap though! <EOR> Nice know people thinking giving east side peeps some culinary options!!  jonesin' some ramen glad hear spot opened right down street me   gentleman working told wanted start ramen spot east side because everything else far away chinatown   good that!!  opted veggie ramen outing miso broth pretty dang good despite initial perception Ray's walked into restaurant   because all workers speaking Tagalog Filipino customer base largely Filipino decided speak back same language!!  Kind tripping little bit Japanese decor set Filipino conversations dancing around all left wonder little bit   However ramen hit spot actually pretty good despite continually confusing cultural stimuli   also karaage appetizer pretty grubbin' well   Contrary people said earlier reviews accept credit cards now!  Big plus big sigh relief didn't any cash when walked in   Nice friendly delectably grubbin' food   back soon   consider upgrading 5 star when some beer along nihonshoku Japanese Food ! <EOR> We came dinner 6pm  place pretty easy find  hood becareful  When arrived only costumer  place very warm cozy  karaoke system guessing down certain nights  Plus place clean   ahead order tonkatsu shoryu ramen bowl  came corn bamboo shoots pork eggs green onions  food came decent time  soup good  But ramen noodles remind top ramen  side only costumer inside waiter didn't come once see doing  wave down when finished  Hmm sure if back  But give second try  <EOR> My review primarily based catering service partly food prepared us   Granted food mass produced food turned acceptable especially if don't know anything Asian food claimed Asian     In nutshell originally per contract supposed drop off food noon but due class schedules requested agreed food delivered prior students changing classes 11 giving time stage food prepare serving   Instead food arrived almost 1 pm    almost hour late   lady committee arranged services tried hardest avoid having direct contact guy delivered food because livid hell going give earful Please she begged don't say anything   We're government    Granted Ray's gave good price would've preferred another caterer paid full price could deliver    Ray's service made committee looked bad    experienced first hand Filipino time is   Filipino time uninformed means when agree meeting specific agreed time showed hour late think perfectly alright    Ugggggghhhhh!!!!  Asians huge saving faces but couldn't find way save ours people leaving event wondering where food promised them   utter embarrassment!  literally fuming mad    would try hardest convince committee use them future events   Discounted price won't bad service   saved faces think other parts event's programs     In fairness though received good feedback food   being nice courteous since eating free literally starving didn't care   battered chicken I refuse call them karaage because they're Karaage gyoza meat vegetable egg rolls pork satay chicken fried rice cold soba greens sesame dressing  ate them because starved   Everything tastes good when you're hungry   Just saying  But again NEVER AGAIN!    If any Ray's the owner chef wait person even busboys read care Yelp reviews hope reply review attempt redeem establishment future potential customers because  am pretty damn absolutely sure they're getting mine even if last caterers earth!  Whew!  felt good   and feel much better  <EOR> The Food DELICIOUS  Finally don't way some good Ramen! Servers friendly cost inexpensive atmosphere very nice  definately new favorite go to place GOOD asian food  <EOR> I really disappointed place really wanted it  practically no good Asian food eastside town 1  karage battered regular flour instead mochiko supposed essentially just fried chicken side soy sauce   2  no green tea day 40 degrees outside  NO GREEN TEA?!?! served Lipton black tea individual bags even pre brewed pot   3  seemingly interesting menu item chicken katsu creamy ponzu sauce which didn't have   4  place completely empty no other Asians except Filipinos probably because its owned Filipinos    5  tonkatsu ramen uber soggy noodles could only FORCE myself eat half awful! tonkatsu slices super DRY basically tasted old pork chops noodles didn't taste egg noodles cause didn't yellowish color egg noodles have   The dessert however quite delicious  deep fried Oreos Banana Tempura tasted lot banana lumpia   <EOR> Good people! Good food! Very good price! bonus fast service!  Banana tempura curry katsu must try  <EOR> I am glad effort serve Japanese style food also want support theihr business let tell honest opinion  ordered Sapporo beer Sappro light drink mernu but both out   Karaoge fom apptizer menu but also out  sign wall said Udon Oden Yakitori Soba  etc Japanese     might use decoration but its confuse Japanese  Miso Ramen tast miso soup noodle way different Japanese style Ramen   bowl use Udon Soba Japanese style  <EOR> Best ramen ever don't listen haters  Free tv cool servers great food! Going give them $20 tip  <EOR> Its ok  pet peeves getting apetizer same timw food  Food decent though  <EOR> I'll probably hardly ever area don't know when back again but liked most part   There your usual shoyu tonkotsu ramen dishes  ordered Tonkotsu Shoyu it thin noodles really liked noodles  Much prefer opposed noodles used other places  don't usually try broth but quite enjoyed one  Plus chilly helped warm up   There hardly any other patrons service wasn't issue  Even if call them assistance wouldn't big deal   just she made feel  They also area live music albeit very small but nice know some nights where quite nice there  0 <EOR> been 4 times first visit great every time come back quality become  less less  love soup place very close house but rather drive further satisfied graving for  <EOR>
