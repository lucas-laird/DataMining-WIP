There many great restaurants strip but Carmine's them  Treat yourself right anywhere but there  food quality poor service bad atmosphere busy  <EOR> If looking large portion entree look no further! give large portions share them family style! food taste good much better Buca Beppo! atmosphere great Friday nights very lively full energy! cheap going but if want authentic Italian food great atmosphere it! <EOR> Hands down best meal while Vegas! stopped while passing looking somewhere stop dinner  seated promptly greeted right away several people  server fantastic!

The calamari came first initially thought we'd no problem polishing off  three all all pretty hungry  calamari delicious crispy piping hot good flavor both batter squid meat  didn't try marinara sauce but others seemed love it  preferred throwing dusting parmesan cheese top which made even better   As putting dent into platter calamari waiter came platter Angel Hair pasta Bolognese sauce  He then started dish all some reason ended largest serving    Maybe because clapped bounced down seat when he set down table?  The sauce just good remembered being which huge relief  tend very bad luck things experienced once end craving  never quite add know? But wasn't case here  sauce meaty mildly spicy without being tomato y  word? Tomato y? now   It wasn't long before realized only failed clearing calamari not so small portion pasta left over  all hotel rooms without microwaves weren't sure wanted take leftovers but then decided see if could find someone   in need   to give to   I'm glad found location before trip Vegas  perfect pre race meal loved everything service quality food    Once again left overly full impressed Carmine's! <EOR> This place just awkward! couldn't wait leave!

Don't order it  pasta carbonara actually tasty  Would recommend based parm dish  Salad okay very tasty  Head Capo's Palm instead!! <EOR> Not bad  Huge portions plenty share  chain restaurant pretty impressed  would recommend going if Vegas most restaurants pretty iffy when comes quality  <EOR> Two stars following reasons 1 when walked greeter totally rude us  Didn't even look faces when she talked told place full next two hours  When checked Open Table openings every 15 min she totally lying she didn't job she actually hired for    So able reservation within seconds would allow seated within 15 min  However able find seat bar which allowed bypass dealing again    2 Food incredibly cold! ordered chicken parmesan some pasta  waiting 20 25 min expecting least little warm! serves cold pasta chicken?!?! <EOR> What say Carmines Las Vegas?

My advice would add couples menu menu  Many couples Vegas  different market feel large massive portions alienate couples want eat there  would want carry doggy bags around them mall all night? lot people refrigerators hotel rooms well  Price two $130  pricing exactly cheap    Was solid meal w o smaller couples menu only return when family friends town want eat traditional red sauce Italian   I also lunch submarine sandwiches also MASSIVE! Italian mixed tomato mozzarella sandwich both tasty well made  bread super fresh don't hold back meat  Two people split more enough  <EOR> Veal parm very good love milk fed taste  Meatballs good  Comfortable seating  Good service  Big portions  <EOR> This establishment worth wait hype  linguine meat balls   food hot all sauce very sweet little overbearing linguine tasted straight can  asked bread waitress literally gave bread soon food bread sucked   meat balls very mushy very bland  Would highly recommend coming establishment  <EOR> Excellent food! best Italian food long time!

Linguine Shrimp also very good shrimp more prawns quite generous amount given  shrimp cooked perfectly linguine wine sauce delicious  But favorite dish Chicken Parmigiana seasoned breaded cooked perfection!! nice layer Mozzarella top well yummy marinara complimented well although would tasted perfect itself  If full point surely would big pieces  Lastly tried Italian Cheesecake dessert definitely different  very light airy typical cheesecake bit lemon flavor    Overall restaurant amazing food amazing definitely top 5 Italian restaurants  gladly back when town  <EOR> Very disappointed  Came family  Everything  super salty  sad because just came back Grand Canyon hungry  Ordered he chicken parm ziti pasta meat sauce  didn't finish food barely touched it gave someone streets  waste money  Terrible experience  Even server kind rude  <EOR> Wow Olive Garden quality food wine 2 1 2 3 times price!  The Chicken Parmesan just OK tasted everyone else's except if remember correctly $35 00!!! let waiter pick good wine bitter neither finished glasses   Asked see manager told he busy    <EOR> So family looking authentic Italian restaurant because never able find decently priced one  tried Carmine's reading reviews seeing averagely priced compared other restaurants  eating definitely could use some improvements  A major negative restaurant surprised don't menus looked weirdly when asked them menus  mean 99 9% restaurants menus don't why weird asking it  don't think any Italian restaurants ever gone don't give menus  suppose meant save costs but just don't logic behind strategy especially when new customers come easily turned off weird lack menu experience  Now say everyone doesn't mind however when saw least two tables sit down leave walking back forth look menu wall  mean when into restaurant expect see menus way converse people eating eat such especially dishes share  once sat down said menus big screen wall If wanted menu needed take picture phone stare table look it  Problem menu wall only covered certain portions restaurant certain tables couldn't clear view menu phone almost dead day full sight seeing  When menu wall sure everyone see table way people talk each other want eat especially since all dishes shared  way customers don't keep going back forth risk higher chances collisions waiters staff other customers even cause accidents spilling food drink other people all dressed nicely  There's higher risk accidents occurring when many people moving around finite spaced environment  menu wasn't even overly complicated could easily page even used place mat eating  many ideas available when deciding your menu  Then certain tables occupied near menu wall because imagine obstructs view menu people would hate idea people walking back forth around while you're trying enjoy meal  Kind waste real estate restaurant loss revenue when those tables easily filled  lot problems could solved if just created menu   Now another minor negative food  wasn't terrible but wasn't amazing either  pasta meats veggies even seafood all exceptionally fresh  taste it  Nothing feels mushy dried sitting fridge months  Everything exceptionally fresh  only problem food wasn't really hot  warm  family ordered Prime Rib special Saturday warm  delicious but warm  If hotter food would've easily 9 10  mean if paying kind price food expect certain level quality    The prices insane  Just ordering two dishes easily top $150  ordered 3 dishes imagine expensive was  prime rib special Saturday $95  But said could feed four people  If your family big eaters mine then 2 people could easily finish that  Pastas start mid $35 range but adding substitutions adds another $15 it  Portions average price would say major positive Carmine's waiter  He decent constantly helping probably only decent staff member whole place  Especially when wanted new table because typical 4 person table wouldn't able accommodate 3 full plates food  remember ask bigger table if you're big eater   And said earlier some tables absolutely no view menu could really tell which good tables which bad ones    Would again? Maybe  wasn't anything memorable especially price  <EOR> NATALIE must your waitress!! often meet someone attentive especially when very busy Sunday night   This first time dining here  enjoyed ambiance music plus sat bar top more away crowd  bar menu smaller portions but definetely enough two plus lot left take enjoy  recommend blood orange Italian soda fried zucchini  hearty  Bolognese sauce your favorite pasta!!! <EOR> I came family during business trip   reservations promptly although traffic  awful   service extremely slow taking over 45 min just appetizer   Once stuffed mushrooms very soggy very good $18   main course came 30 min later   portions very large family style   food average soggy pasta thin rubbery chicken   sauce very thin   whole meal took 2 hours three people   If you're trying feed large group reasonable price might ok but small family better higher quality options money  <EOR> Service great food hot flavorful very tasty  came two kids 7 5 welcomed kindness  look forward coming back next time town  all great meal fantastic dining experience  <EOR> It might little bit expensive but probably think because just other person  Carmine's really place shouldn't visit unless four more people   We ordered salad balsamic vinaigrette strawberries arugula candied walnuts much more  MASSIVE   After ordered dish multiple types meat such chicken sausage potatoes   I would definitely come back again just need more people actually eat all food  Those two dishes cost $100 drinks  <EOR> This delicious! came rather large group 10 people easily sat middle restaurant    The menus walls pass them pack your glasses if near sighted  share wine menu cocktail list table squint read labels    We ordered Caesar salad split table absolutely plenty 10 people  Then ordered two pastas two meats table  Again absolutely plenty even left overs  Listen server when advise much order because know better believe me    The food delicious! wine great atmosphere lovely  wonderful Italian restaurant would definitely suggest if looking place Caesars  <EOR> We ordered wings meatballs spaghetti   wings good just bit salty   meatballs good   Family style dishes   Bread basket varied bread   bit confused server because more come table which caused miscommunication  seems  work there   would nice if would told before hand   Overall good meal pay for   check em out   Plenty leftovers another meal  <EOR> I took risk place having wedding dinner held without tasting food first never before  best friend recommend place trust judgement good thing did dinner great family orientated style big dishes lot food  year later family until day still talks food tiramisu cake   year anniversary husband came back celebrate tried porterhouse steak best steak ever just melt your mouth pricey but worth it  <EOR> This place delicious   huge portions but Wow!!! worth it   lasagna die for  Totally recommend Carmine's   Bread basket great too!!!! <EOR> My favorite NY restaurant back home comes current city?!

No way  <EOR> We happen come across restaurant while shopping  serves food family style portions feed 4 6  If sit bar meals generously serve 2  ravioli best ever had  sauce excellent!  also Carmine's salad which awesome  Great ambiance  Definitely place bring family  <EOR> We trip stopped since fan Carmine good experiences New York New Jersey so  Good food good service big portion good selection wines  noodle came bit mushy over cooked well maybe busy but wait said if anything didn't cook right send back cook new Well good favor hope next time remarkable meal talk about  <EOR> I Carmine's NYC few years ago  until recently hadn't realized become chain  extremely weary chain restaurants but figured we'd give shot because boyfriend never tried  In short service straddling line between mediocre poor  server showed little interest making impression come find end shift  food brought she whisked saying leaving finish you  Gave brief smile left  No thank no asking if needed anything else  boyfriend sat empty drink nearly remainder meal before replacement server came check us  Nice   We vodka penne   it good Americanized Italian sort way  also weary Italian labeling because seldom authentic Italian  No exception here  draw portion size Cheesecake Factory  guess we're just people sacrifice taste heaping pile bland food  also add many reviews done before bread cold  Like   not hint warmth it  Yuck   If you're feeding family opt Trevi instead  Much friendlier service better food can't argue that  <EOR> Super yummy able no reservation which surprised  place crowded  Very large portions expected family style restaurant  Great place large groups  small group left some food behind  love atmosphere music well  <EOR> We ordered lasagna chicken saltimbocca chocolate cannolis  lasagna good but better   chicken saltimbocca very good  chicken cutlets very thin chicken itself tender  also skimped Prosciutto topping  cannolis ok but taking into account resturuant originally based NYC in which NYC NJ metro area some best cannolis find anywhere world Carmine's cannolis disappointing  service slow but Saturday night when place very busy really can't fault them much that  decor nice but place come if want nice quite dinner    the sound level crowd very loud more being crowded bar rather restaurant   Carmine's very similar Maggiano's serving large family style portions  Maggiano's several years but remember food atmosphere far better Carmine's  Overall think Carmine's ok maybe if ordered some other dishes little less crowded noisy would give higher rating  However best rating give today just 3 stars  <EOR> Service great   Mussels red sauce ehh greatest  Meatballs angel hair pasta good  Portions control just plain waste food even when two people sharing entrée  <EOR> We walked Carmine's earlier day when walking through Caesars Palace  girlfriend  heard before wanted try it  show decided head back over give shot  maybe 11 1130 no wait table    The seating little unusual because where sit decides type menu order from  suggested sit bar because just two us  guess if sit main restaurant only order regular menu all served 'family style' huge portions feed many people  Even bar menu notation portions would large enough 2 3 people    The last couple hours before close included Happy Hour deals appetizers drinks  decided try Calamari appetizer then ordered Rigatoni Sausage Broccoli split  Both appetizer entree served fairly quickly surprisingly both portions huge  Calamari could fed 4 people Rigatoni would easily fed 3  Everything great fresh  Everything red sauce Italian Sausage seemed made house  ate much could but could fed another person two leftovers  Seriously don't let your eyes bigger your stomach    The staff all friendly restaurant clean  prices higher end but portions enormous  Try come during Happy Hour times cheaper meal  <EOR> The restaurant itself stunning cool decor throughout place  waiter kinda blah but watching other tables waiters tell top work   Our food amazing!!! orders penne alla vodka white seafood mix chicken Marsala  Each fish very good  only thing would change stupid menu wall     if charge $30  plate afford menus each your guests    don't care people walking closing hovering over table because can't see across restaurant look menu  <EOR> This place stupid   Family only   Don't take date   mean can't feed 2 people want? <EOR> What fun time Super Bowl! charged $50 per person all eat buffet  large tv's set every room  Everyone reserved tickets table watch game party  food really good  Service very good  little trouble tv sound first but fixed quickly  only bad thing party Denver lost  bet them couldn't believe outcome!

Portions HUGE    hence why cost much arm leg  <EOR> I've Carmine's large group pretty excited whole family style thing going on  disappointed it  food far good restaurant overpriced was  served overly salty plates burnt broccolis overcooked pastas  price made much worst much better food lot less trip come on    Vegas! good food city   star service pretty decent   If looking good food Vegas skip one  <EOR> Came lunch  calamari spaghetti meatballs  portions Huge! More enough 4 people  Calamari pretty good S M ok only   made dinning experience stink Abigale server she took order didn't see again until meal  bread water refills other servers  <EOR> Family style dining  Great large groups 5+ share large plates allow variety   large plates definitely family style   Spaghetti meatballs fabulous!  Kind noisy because bachelor's party upstairs but sounded fun time there  <EOR> So two came into Carmines eat Tuesday around 4 so very weird hour ton people   always smelled delicious when passed wanted try it  portions huge two I'd recommend coming groups five more  most disappointing though lasagna ordered completely bland  tasteless point sprinkle salt myself  no hints oregano basil really anything matter food  only tasteless but huge portion came matter seconds  wasn't hot middle cheese melted inside  When complained waitress completely disregarded said  She also told spaghetti meatballs lasagna made order which why those two come fast  waitress just terrible  Other servers relay messages because she no where found when wanted pay leave  left entire dish missing just two servings which also half eaten clearly unhappy  Yet no discount no offer something else menu also no apology? Just shocked restaurant strip such terrible food treat customers poorly still paid end  Left hungry feeling robbed money  <EOR> I wish took pictures food   calamari fried zucchini sticks eggplant parm roll   FANTASTIC!!  wanted try Carmine's years two cookbooks great   Vegas location did disappoint!! <EOR> When Italian friends own pasta company NJ suggested come dinner trust them! boy did place deliver fine evening  food served family style coming group six perfect! Here's shared     Bread Basket featured assortment three different breads olive oil butter it  Two breads reminded focaccia onions other tomato  favorites! light fluffy moist! last Bread didn't try but hubby sure seemed enjoy it!  Caesar Salad Ever since giving birth two months ago constantly craved crunch romaine  salad particularly attractive me  croutons huge but weren't many overwhelming  just right amount dressing everything covered without being soggy  plate three anchovies served side  think moms only ones indulge those    Shrimp Red Sauce seafood fan all but least try this  shrimp quite firm didn't unappealing fishy taste  really enjoyed full sized cooked tomatoes sauce!  Veal Parmigiana never parmigiana life glad finally have! crispy breading provided nice texture melted mozzarella  think most flavorful all meats table    Penne Ragu meatballs ragu probably next most flavorful meat  sausage pork bit more simple took back seat delicious tomato sauce  crazy past! cooked perfectly seasoned perfectly    What wonderful evening sharing friends family  such great place special evening! <EOR> This place fun atmosphere pretty good food  family style dining ordering your party interesting compromise we'll all eating    We Caesar salad carbonara pasta both quality delicious choices enjoyed entire party    Two items kinda bugged 1  menu wall stare afar difficulty seeing appeared starting adjacent table sitting under menu  would nice just menu table   2  hate when restaurant insists making u reuse your salad fork your dinner  forks finished salad plates server took them off salad plates put them back placemat reuse  price per entre I'd think could given clean fork next course meal  Small things big difference  <EOR> We visit LV couple times year!  ABSOLUTE favorite restaurant!  12 year insists eat each time visit   Love food love service! <EOR> This located Caesar's Palace Thanksgiving dinner here  dishes pretty pricey but serve family style  calamari die steak  ordered medium but end coming pretty well done  Think place nice Maggiano's  also ordered salmon which came pretty plain Carmines salad really delicious chock full lot goodies ham salami  enjoyed rigatoni meat sauce well  perfect amount food six adults child  full dessert but Tiramisu looked delicious  half sizes cheesecake  <EOR> So good twice Kyle server night 1 Michael night two really great service food consistently delicious family style bring your appetite serve big plates bosses bday man did Michael special great entertainer server side <EOR> I Carmine's 4 times group 10 40 while working Caesars   good?

Food amazing but word wise portions Extremely large! wife together even requesting half orders more then two eat  primary focus family style large groups   said going back no matter what!  Caesar salad best ever pasta simply perfect    They said if eat bar menu more designed two people  <EOR> Horrible experience  Groups SHOULD COME HERE! Vegas town  Made reservations large group celebrating aunts bday  never restaurant doesn't food menus but drink menus instead?!   To order food take picture menu board phone  Then back table order  Most plates menu averaged between $20 $30 which ok since servings big  normally ask waiters suggestions new places  waiter not friendly tall Hispanic guy black glasses suggested seafood plate bc great according   took word it  time bill dish $70!!!!!!! reviewing menu board taken picture phone dish menu!! supposed nice dinner turned horrible instead  felt mislead waiter  Why would he suggest something wasn't menu even mention price? If menu hands would most restaurants wouldn't ordered dish  felt he trying add bill increase tip percentage  only but seafood made sick food poisoning    I never recommend place anyone  did tell all close friends bad experience now sharing yelp warn others plan group dinners here  Worst experience bad food didn't appreciate getting screwed over waiter  need menus all other restaurants do  Only reason giving them star simply bc to  <EOR> Cut star huge sizes  seen any reviews without word huge? Food good if cannot take leftovers really feel guilty leave behind such good quality taste mention waste    We two people warned advance chose same meal  Meat balls still talk tasty were  Salad also fresh feed table 6 8 easily    Why some consideration smaller portions? <EOR> Came dinner last night family husbands birthday   Usually service great leave impressed   Unfortunately football game while dining  didn't usual attention   order wrong while asked food packed servers response doesn't travel well well actually local fridge home   icing cake when server asked if wanted dessert   said no thank which he responded birthday dessert being said turns down free dessert   $329 later dessert $30   Which probably would gotten being husband prefers strawberry shortcake   Lesson learned Carmine's come football playing because then your employees would work   Thanks server making sure would probably Rao's spend extra money but would worth   <EOR> Went birthday celebration  private dining room which awesome  back restaurant very secluded  waitress good  She made sure drinks plates cleared timely manner  set menu portions huge but known being family style type place  dessert absolutely amazing presentation beautiful  Carmine's made birthday very special  Thank you! <EOR> Sabrina absolutely amazing!
