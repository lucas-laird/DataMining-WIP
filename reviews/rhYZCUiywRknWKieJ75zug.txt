We ended ordering quite few delicious things all filling super cheap  appetizer nachos chicken side  huge portion only few dollars  boyfriend ordered pulled pork sliders they come fries ordered Mediterranean pizza no olives   The pizza perfect portion boyfriend liked sliders quite bit  fries PERFECT  can't stress enough  could order those bucket  crispy outside but crispy inside  Perfect taste!  The only reason don't give place 5 stars because service  didn't noticed few minutes but only other party 6 people there  waiter nice once seated though! <EOR> We Groupon try place first time    first indicator should worried NOON Friday gave them try but single other car parking lot usually good thing  entry doors big sign advertising Prime Rib Special $9 99   Inside dark bar usually but well decorated more dozen 4 person tables separate dining area  greeted sole waitress hostess serving only other customers told pick table  didn't see bartender any time while there  waitress ADEL brought menus took drink order  When she came back asked whether she recommended Prime Rib Special she said great but also shrimp special day too  love prime rib trusting very positive endorsement ordered 'double cut' $14 99 friend French Dip sandwich  When asked baked potato offered sides Adel said pre baked would microwaved heat but would still very good! cut chase asked rare medium rare piece grisly pan seared meat truly tough even cut knife  Under 'main' piece meat which medium well done much smaller piece seared meat well done guess supposed 'double cut' serving! Only once 60 years sent piece meat back but even friend tried meat agreed edible!  called waitress she took look apologized said she would another piece meat  said if also going pan fried would rather just burger instead  Sandwich prices high stated my special anything but special! Even though server truly nice lady would never back even Groupon  BAD experience  ALWAYS pay attention parking lot = rest people area giving hint! <EOR> Came because purchased Groupon  live part town but wish nearby because decent enough neighborhood spot  bartenders super sweet attentive  Many tv's ESPN fix  ordered prime rib which only $10 did disappoint  chose shrimp albondigas soup really liked it  Broth y but generous shrimp meatballs  prime rib came garlic mashed potatoes veggies  Great service decent prices  <EOR> Great drink specials but great food    Happy hour 3pm 7pm half off ALL alcohol appetizers  Let say again HALF OFF ALL ALCOHOL  Pretty unbeatable drink specials    The food another story  ordered mac n cheese balls flat breads fried calamari nachos   Mac n cheese balls These aren't you're thinking  two giant balls lightly fried mac n cheese covered marinara sauce  marinara sauce super overpowering some really mediocre mac n cheese   Fried calamari Such shame  Very very very overcooked  Barely any breading it  super tough eat very rubbery  finished only because hate wasting life any animal found its way plate   Flatbreads Not great  Crust burnt places  Ordinary marinara sauce giant blobs mozzarella    Nachos Exactly could them home    The food incredibly disappointing took long time well  much better Steiners Rounders similar  hate write bad review but honest quality here    I would most likely come back awesome happy hour  wait staff friendly funny quick drink services  <EOR> Mattys burger!!!! All way  oh ya Johns cool xo <EOR> This place sucks besides shitty food bartenders worst especially bartender beard thinks he gods gift  bunch cry babies hope stay slow cause suck don't deserve service  <EOR> Why change good thing?? known your Prime Rib special very good albondigas soup I actually thought your soup better mexican cantina restaurant suncoast better Juan's Flaming Fajitas  But when came few nights ago your whole menu changed removed prime rib should've left on party 4 several several times time all walked out!   I regular bar food ANYWHERE!    Who ever making changes better fix something real fast because you're losing customers    READ YOUR REVIEWS!!  You're only place city decent prime rib dinner     Now you're nothing special same bar menu every place town no reason come now   BYE     <EOR> Lived Vegas 30 years  First time here  Ordered some sampler appetizer wine two us  Gambled comp wine  Sampler $5 bucks happy hour 3 7 half price  Jason cool  30 machines  <EOR> I only Marty's once but tell vet place   definitely feeling older Las Vegas gaming bar tavern   Frequented lot locals all servers knew names almost everyone there   There middle island where sat played attach some photos did!

Would totally come again if lived closer   The only reason wasn't five stars because tad bit smiley but when hitting jackpots doesn't matter! <EOR> Just stopped relax work w a few friends  changed menu little skeptical bc always ordered same thing eat but no longer menu  surprise new menu offers lot great food  caprese salad flatbread pizza some calamari   all very good  service w Jason Katrina excellent always  <EOR> Lots machines large bar great food service  coming years When close always swing breakfast lunch  <EOR> The food offer menu honestly trash  even good when your drunk catching buzz!
