Well looks same but definitely same  all    My family eats EPL often because always hurry all come home late work school just order things nearby home  first times eaten location good    I ordered night through drive through 2 hours before closed  service fast  chicken warm  asked sauces but didn't give any  brought home  chicken location did signature taste EPL usually has  actually quite flavorless appetizing    Most fast food restaurants usually already start average ratings but sadly starts below  <EOR> The new chipotle great!! Super fast friendly drive thru last night!!  Love avocado salsa!!  returning French fries meals!!  super picky eater 10 year old lady bed chicken strips too!! Thank adding those too!!   Super super!! <EOR> I never El Pollo Loco before no idea expect  going Taco Bell Del Taco? Turns completely different aforementioned fast food joints  When walked huge grill behind counter loaded suprise pollo  unexpected because chicken looked fresh supermarket quality  Plus just shit ton it  also liked fact actual salsa bar    I coupon stuffed quesadilla combo came drink chips $5  ordered quesadilla enchilada style pretty substantial tasted better expected  wait time longer would liked  took 10 minutes  gave buzzer order  WTF? buzzer fast food joint? Anyways since took little long food gave free brownie!  Customer service great  think greeted 3 seperate times  brand new location tell employees still getting hang things  All all El Pollo Loco bit pricier say Del Taco but food higher quality  <EOR> Slow service usual El Pollo Loco cashier very friendly staff new probably needs more training saucers spilled into bag twice when brought cashiers attention he proceeded give more sauces already spilled bag  <EOR> Are kidding me! seriously getting sad! Every time come location never know going end with! tacos cut short insides then received wrong quesadilla ugh!!!!! annoying! Why oh why can't people follow instructions amount food needs into taco!!! <EOR> I'm typically fan crazy chicken every other time chicken dry   Today grabbed meal take home husband some lunch when tried piece jealous chicken!  moist flavorful  perhaps another chance give them next time  <EOR> This el polo loco very clean staff excellent    I'm confused lower stars other reviews?    I've many different el pollo locos far best ever to    The young man working counter friendly even answered questions had   He eager help all answers   The salsa bar clean offers many choices    We came lunch around 11 30 wasn't busy all    The bathroom didn't mirror weird but very clean bathroom!! <EOR> I wish could give more stars but can't point  When best El Pollo Vegas but when aren't pretty bad  Messed orders food good employees issues  almost 2 different restaurants  When good entire experience good  When bad entirely opposite  Hope find magic when good keep it  <EOR>
