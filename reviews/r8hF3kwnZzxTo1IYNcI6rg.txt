assessment might bit harsh place very popular local Mexican American people though really wonder if appeal more down over the top decor   guess really bugs just seems over priced $14 very meh burrito no sides etc  just kind crazy me   also don't really any lunch specials you'll paying dinner time prices no matter time day go   say though staff nice if flamboyant decor room lot flair it  <EOR> My new favorite Mexican restaurant!    The boyfriend heading down First Friday but weren't feelin' food trucky yelped places nearby   El Sombrero popped few blocks away  read description being around since 50's but only 111 reviews   we confused yet intrigued   pulled didn't look much outside   empty hostess stand front didn't feel promising but stepped inside anyway   WOW   didn't expect dining room look way did   felt modern hip clean  wasn't all expected     We seated waiters quickly brought bowl chips salsa took drink order   chips nicely seasoned although thicker typically prefer couldn't stop once started   loved salsa generous serving received   ordered guacamole which perfect size 2     I mood fajitas but asked server which dish he recommended   He recommended Del Patron platter recommended 2 people share 3 cuts steak Mexican cream corn potatoes rice beans   Sounded perfect came recommended took server's advice!    The platter arrived generous serving each type steak  If remember correctly filet hanger rib eye  Everything delicious!!!  salsa variation favorite platter unlike any other place to  There's smokey salsa chimichurri super duper spicy one   all good but favorite chimichurri  Mmmmmmm!   We ended dinner version bread pudding   No complaints! practically licked plate clean We just back other night another round El Sombrero!  couldn't help but order same thing again    increased price Del Patron $45 $55 but honestly $45 wondering going stay business portion sizes give!  brought daughter time well she ordered chicken enchiladas   Throughout meal she raved food decor atmosphere place!   good sign coming VERY PICKY CRITICAL 10 year old The ONLY negative which would rate place 4 stars 5 both times food extremely slow come out   to point server come apologize extended delay  ordered meat medium rare definitely due cooking time steaks but maybe they're failing prep lot sides salsas EVERYTHING dish upon order   hope more kitchen staff figure cut waiting time!  maybe if everything fresh should just communicating upon order extended delay expected  If fix minor service issues they'll 5 stars across board me!   This place around while but think they've done great job modernizing space more relevant today's diners   All servers dressed nicely which rare ANY Mexican joint vegas   truly love place encourage everyone try out!! <EOR> One best decisions all week  Gorgeous atmosphere delicious drinks  sangria traditional lime margarita EXCELLENT  skip place  Wish could take back Nashville us! <EOR> The best find ever!

Food GOOD very Mexico City  Service warm informative  Sangria perfect ambience great  can't wait back always stop when visiting LV    Viva! <EOR> Easy find but small enough if you're paying attention drive right El Sombrero   hiding plain sight   The dining area very small only seating 50 60 people making fine place party four less but good place large group   dining room very clean appears recently renovated   While bad thing decor gives almost sterile minimal feel place   impression want food atmosphere food!  The food served very hot just prepared   tasty but kind fare I'd rave especially given great assortment other Mexican restaurants available Las Vegans visiting guests   leads criticism food overpriced   probably double ought giving impression restaurant trying establish itself based pricing something bit more high end trendy actually is   Because price almost rated El Sombrero two stars   Even time tell if they've priced menu appropriately   To counter cost food though waitstaff excellent   greeted genuine smile host waiter waiter just nice   food came other waiters helped ensuring all food arrived together   Because small size waitstaff ever present good way never overbearing   drinks never empty   service definitely above average caused review edge closer four stars   additional criticism though music little loud even distracting times   There's dedicated parking off street private lot along side restaurant between restaurant taxi service next door   small lot but there's sufficient room accommodate patrons even if restaurant full   Keep mind lot pretty tight   If drive large vehicle you're comfortable maneuvering narrow lot may find parking difficult   For all pros cons mentioned think El Sombrero solid choice Mexican cuisine if you're nearby   While wouldn't strongly recommend wouldn't warn people stay away either   you'll need try yourself decide think   I'd love know! <EOR> Great meal! loved small place huge flavor  Extremely authentic Mexican food modern twist   wife definitely back   way food POLITICAL VIEWS  <EOR> Beware may your salsa!!
