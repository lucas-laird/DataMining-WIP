Also cannot substitute clear noodles white noodles soup?? don't know place even still business  <EOR> I've couple times first time menu better pricing lunch  think because convention didn't serve lunch menu because think $15 95 Bibimbop little overpriced even dinner  very little meat mainly vegetables fried egg top  tasty side dishes offered ample but worse part husband ordered Korean soup short ribs eat all time short ribs should tender fall off bone  Well couldn't even chew meat rubbery needed another 2 hours cook yet    I venture another Korean restaurant next time visit  <EOR> First foremost bbq meats unlimited side salad sesame oil little spice it very tasty!  It all you can eat BBQ but second time around opted since much food last time there  love side dishes except cucumber salad little sweet usually prefer more tardy side kimchi fermented  However those shortcomings does overrule fact bimbimbap point! If you're just going ambiance decor place you  But if Korean food lover myself yourself favor indulge! <EOR> This second attempt Korean food first attempt beyond Korean BBQ say really enjoyed it  place may best but solid service good fast  noodles sweet sour pork  say enjoyed noodles quite bit more pork dish but excited give Korean food another try soon  <EOR> We hard time finding place since inside tricky shopping center  very clean service very good  busy time but very nice    The food decent  would back again  <EOR> This place amazing! employees really nice well owner  food great! came Culture Cuisine class UNLV ban chan kimchi soup makerel seafood pancake beef bulgolgi sweet potato noodles veggies hot pot tofu veggies  all really good definitely going back another time  Please check place its hidden gem  Love place! <EOR> We really liked all eat deal  meat good owner really nice coming over talk during meal  big group plenty room place  Korean restaurant where service top priority thought fine    Definitely recommend it! <EOR> Yelp 2017 100 Challenge 2017 Review 45 100  A decent place Korean food but quite expensive single dishes  food good but overall experience did anything outstanding want return    Being LA surprising Korean BBQ places Vegas charge extraordinary high individual meat dishes $24+ but then offer ayce all eat BBQ same price  guess part strategy people just ayce all types meat eaten  just usual being LA  <EOR> This place amazing Korean BBQ   meats delicious kimchi spicy very flavorful veggies fresh everything delicious   well worth trek off strip this! <EOR> All say restaurant staff rude unfriendly  reading previous reviews AYCE came find $22 person  little bit more thought overpriced  waited long time served when tried order food AYCE waitress already placed order herself without even saying word  She Okay want bulgogi kabli brisket?
