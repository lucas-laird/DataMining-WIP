I havent Roberto's Taco Shop least 5 years decided try again  can't remember why skipped Mexican food places but now think remember why  great but if quick Mexican fix this'll do   place simple service fast fairly clean decent place quick lunch  observe lot people coming but time none stayed  Maybe its me? Hehehe  Oh well  <EOR> Terrible! Usually good ol bobbys but time no Bueno! tomales ehh drowned cheese  More cheese tomales sprinkled bit meat  Also worth noting ordered polo beef  But worst part constant jibber jabbering laughing espanol while waiting food  laughing me? Probably  ok though  won't lose sleep over Mijos  Maybe less chatter more cooking would result better tomales correct orders  Orale vato locos! <EOR> Late nights lead hunger   when if you're Vegas find Roberto's   Each every time folks treat well feed well also   yet bad experience nor bad meal   Carne asada fries mmmm mmmmmm MMMMMMMM!! Rolled tacos also good    last visit   cannot wait until back place eat all foods!! <EOR> Came ordered quesadilla burrito  45 mins later other guest getting food first asked lady why took long food come she just said sorry cook noticed whole time just taking time when she asked order he just shrugged  really don't appreciate having time wasted waiting order wasn't even made  money back just left  If didn't think he'd spit food would've asked meal free but just upset hangry over it  Terrible experience  cashier lady good customer service all cooks fault  He literally skipped order made everybody else's  disappointed because love Roberto's never want location again despite being down street house  If could zero stars would  <EOR> Tacos expensive tasted bad   Mom spent $12 4 large tacos which absurd taqueria  only ate because hungry late least greasy spoon fast food   food best quality did hold well time mother brought meal she far away UMC where was   tacos cold tasteless tortillas fell apart easily when eating   vegetables taco did taste peak freshness even if still edible   good quality fresh tortilla should warm soft hold its shape eat it   red sauce milquetoast  <EOR> Disagree previous reviewer   Robertos's good solid chain over the counter Mexican food restaurant you're likely find town   fresh prepare food real ingredients order open 24 hours what's like?  This particular location seemed cleaner nicer few others around town     If you're carnivore highly recommend Carne Asada burrito   great flavor all lacking anything terms much steak get! <EOR> Food satisfactory  going blow your mind  generally order California burrito good  But if your looking something authentic look elsewhere  However does job if your looking something cheap filling  <EOR> We'll bad experience co workers office cashier cook talking badly son  call another Roberto's summerlin order reach someone  We'll manager return call but could see self going into store  manager didn't believe much paid food which prove  Then talk Spanish your employees  off mind when Racist stuff stop  <EOR> It's time update view   Since first review location once twice month   learned take early lunch 10 00 AM order truly rush   Ordering seating never issue when stopping by   Ha!  Looking previous see empty threat saying would return   AM slave convenience   Every order deliciously accurate   The best part customer service   little smug cashier no more   She smiles friendly most recent visit called first name   JOY!  same visit more helpful when coworkers later called field order   line long but kind ladies slaving ass girl saw asked needed told time made front chow waiting me   These acts kindness equal loyalty followed update   Yay!  fan  <EOR> The colorado meal very good  husband tongue taco delicious well definitely come back try others  <EOR> I ordered food took home find messed order  drove back corrected  home started eating food found hair follicle attached  returned again only accused putting myself  very long curly hair I'm bi racial hair food inch long black straight  food wasn't worth gas used drive 3 times only accused very loudly sabotaging food because wanted free  disgusted horrible service  <EOR> I came taco Tuesday on   Sadly no deals taco  I instead found deal breakfast burrito Tuesday   myself breakfast log carne asada coworker   Took awhile them order out   While waiting packed few spicy sauce mild takeout   Pick fairly easy since number system receipt     Back office unwrapped log amazed already size   Took bite burnt hotness   Even though took 5 10 mins back log still hot!
