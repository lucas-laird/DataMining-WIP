Service It ok most part  Waiter came quickly enough food arrived relatively timed manner but nothing special   Price Vegas standards it's     ok but if paying price elsewhere would freak considering quality it  $3 bowl rice? If come back it'll definitely satay  sure better Thai places especially ones  strictly Thai instead combo things Lemongrass does  <EOR> Bit disappointing place packed thought must good  wait 45 minutes table  Prices very fair Las Vegas standards portions humongous none three people party finished plate however food same before mentioned Las Vegas standards  Meat both curries extremely hard I would call shoe sole German sure if translates English though   am still marveled produce tough chicken inside curry  weakest meal while here  <EOR> I restaurant staying Aria looking lighter meal referenced zagat ratings restaurants Aria  sure restaurant rated 26 zagat which pretty high  found decent but found much better thai restaurants elsewhere  octopus appetizer which breaded fried while light no distinguishing characteristics  main dish green curry chicken which eggplant its main components different but ok  Service slow lackluster night which busy he restaurant  regular use zagat ratings would put place 22 23  <EOR> So glad ambiance food lovely  appetizer dessert food excellent  advised duck but lighter noodle dish   wish tried duck!

saying lot    Our curry salty side he insisted getting remade even though told fine keeping it  Food coming really slow because short staffed but Bank continued check update us    Three stars food five stars service  <EOR> overall OK best Thai restaurant ever  tasted much better  Also portions very very small  would recommend couples  expensive side   By way would definitely recommend reservations if reading this  concierge Aria said didn't take reservations   but did wait 45 mins  The service very good first all  family tried few bowls could share dishes but didn't give until asked million different waiters exaggerating course   wondering why waiters standing around chilling when asked bowls   ?!  Anyways ordered Tom Yum Goong Tom Yum Tay something that basically tasted same  Tom Yum Goong little bit sweeter though  choose spiciness level want    We also ordered soft shell crab fried rice satay chicken creamy red curry prawns I forget name Thai    Fried rice thought good just bit bland  family thought nothing special  Comes fried crab pieces side   Satay chicken chicken good but peanut sauce wasn't  bread good though   Curry thought probably best part meal  Delicious  Creamy  small came only  few maybe bit more prawns   The restaurant very high class Aria bit formal dress probably good necessary though Hope enjoy review helpful!!

But everything delicious including drinks  Service great too  Came late lunch Monday restaurant very quiet just right way  <EOR> I Lemongrass grab bite eat once during each  time stay ARIA   The food good wait staff attentive restaurant nicely decorated  However nothing other when dim sum served lunch stands out   Again food good but really better any other Asian fusion restaurant found other parts country  If near Lemongrass give try  checked in 6 times dined many more  If when dim sum carts yourself favor dine there! dim sum good Beijing Shanghai  Yep just good authentic  <EOR> Party 4 early lunch  Ordered 4 dishes  appetizer  Spring rolls great  2 4 dishes very good two 4 bland did finish those  Chicken cashew should fabulous but notable meat cuts appetizing kindof odd shaped firm texture  When she dropped check she noticed empty glasses asked wanted refills well now    Beef satay very very tasty!!! Overall expected more fun flavor such prime location price  <EOR> I decided try lemongrass learning previous visit  great tip   the restaurant does take out   so ordered green chicken curry drunken noodles  green curry pretty tasty nice amount heat whereas drunken noodles terribly bland  price good   2 dishes + rice $42 finding Vegas best kept secret! Just ask medium spice drunken noodles <EOR> We stopped before Cirque du Soleil's Zarkana show @ Aria   more logistical reason why ended Lemongrass   Otherwise would chosen cheaper and more authentic Thai restaurant   Very very very expensive Thai food   Four people + no drinks = $100   understand supposed high class restaurant but expecting better experience overall   Everyone's meal came fine   Everyone enjoyed meal   Service okay   waiter disappeared long periods time but water girl frequented table every few minutes   Ambiance nice   Relaxing low light   scale   lot rich white guys taking escort dates dinner   I would much preferred mom pop Thai restaurant   Better food better pricing  <EOR> We Tai Chen Chicken Pad Thai 'J'  Bottom line cook better Thai food home  2 stars decent selection wine appealing design layout restaurant  <EOR> We didn't really know expect Lemongrass   just wanted some Thai food figured Lemongrass can't bad!  After looking through menu tell Lemongrass isn't true authentic Thai restaurant   There's more a    Thai Chinese fusion going here   Still pretty damn excited since all last few meals fast food!  + Tom Kha Chicken chicken coconut lemongrass galangal   Solid tom kha   best but solid   4 portion good bowl soup each! $8 + Panang Duck coconut red curry duck ground peanut lychee   favorite all ones tried!  think duck fried crunchy skin very good red curry   No bones!  VERY small portion though curry more paste   Lychee sits side  $20 + Drunken Noodle spicy rice noodle prawn scallop squid Thai basil   Good share   Lots fresh seafood   actually surprised amount seafood! $20 + Three Cups Chicken bone in chicken ginger basil sesame oil Shaoshing wine   Yes yes know Thai but did want something Taiwanese whatever reason decided it   Biggest disappointment all   chicken fried then stewed pot ingredients but flavors garlic ginger didn't really penetrate through   Maybe just little picky since love dish normally P $16  The Thai dishes ordered all pretty solid definitely going route next time   knew gonna expensive sorta is   $20 noodles curry $16 chicken $8 soup   also ordered jasmine rice brown rice meal each portion $3   We didn't try any alcoholic drinks since still sorta recovering night before   Fountain drinks $4 50   Again little high but least free refills!

Why? discusting! 18$ something 4$ all others big City? No thank you    <EOR> The food pretty delicious although only complaints service bit slow mango sticky rice no where near good other places tried NYC LA  <EOR> Despite reading reviews often into restaurant open mind because conscience everyone's taste different    Unfortunately quite disappointed ordering Red Duck Curry ! Almost want say worst Thai had  remember recently saying friend don't think there's things such bad Thai proven wrong tonight    I often eat Thai food including northern southern CA New York Canada London Paris course Thailand know bit Thai food  Ps hardly ever write reviews but felt compelled write given visiting Vegas where majority restaurants overpriced   I think should guaranteed good tasty meal!  Of almost forgot Thai ice tea actually good  <EOR> My friends staying Aria only restaurants didn't require reservation during lunch  right pleasantly surprised    All decided wanted Dim Sum almost every single dish came off cart delicious  favorites happened Pork Buns Shanghai Steamed Dumplings Vegetarian Roll  really recommend getting most dishes your first around decide your favorites seconds   beauty small plates!   Our bill would've extremely reasonable gotten multiple rounds mimosas    oops! Overall really wonderful experience highly recommend  <EOR> Nasty food?nothing taste good?the worst restaurant ever feel sick  If last restaurant Vegas still won't go! Bad bad <EOR> Good Thai teas give some extra pep tables while cooling off   food fine good    staff very accommodating   fun adventure    only complaint seemed only few 'treasures ' entrees   mean curry featured lychees cashew nuts three lychee whole dish   few more maybe roughly chopped disperse them would better received  Same story cashews   sauce nicely done medium spice level think panang curry good but quite next level   husband pineapple fried rice favorite Thailand again just little more pineapple would made dish better   restaurant bit hidden but nice place try  <EOR> Waiter rude  Food just ok  Nothing special all  Restaurant ambiance very nice but doesn't live expectations  ordered black pepper shrimp which arrived cold  Ordered coke zero which arrived flat  other dish green curry arrived spoon  normally used people eat soup! never seen dish served kind small spoon  <EOR> The only reason didn't give place 1 star because good service  Food worth money  noodles use disgusting  chicken bland fish texture  pork used all fatty parts  curry watered down  seriously salmon egg rolls? What!?  The price outrageous taste does justify price all  hands down worst Thai food years   I would compare food someone ethnically Thai tried Thai food very first time very little no instructions  <EOR> I'll start beginning  30 minute wait two people  menu looked promising even though aren't many good options vegetarians  restaurant itself pretty nice looking server unremarkable I'm sorry   everything else sad overpriced disappointment   appetizers took while nothing special  vegetable fried rice pathetic  something made middle night random things found fridge  don't think Asian person made that  embarrassing call Thai food  red curry also mediocre best didn't even come rice order extra! Wtf  wide variety Thai places all over country most disappointing place ever to  only way could worse if sick  <EOR> Lemongrass definitely catered toward Americanized tourist hoping find something believe authentic Thai but still satisfy taste buds   came Saturday evening ordered quite feast party 6   Among popular dish three ordered Drunken seafood noodles   Being only Asian table found dish completely soaked soy sauce lacking all other known Thai spices   two other people demolished dishes   I loved Tom Yam Hed soup far   used fresh mushrooms rather dried mushrooms which really brought smooth texture mushrooms   broth perfect level spice flavor   I also Jelly fish appetizer which would avoid   weird taste left weird tough texture tongue   Jellyfish should melt mouth would say mine undercooked   One con When announced birthday table waiter said he would bring some dessert   Little did know going charged it!  little strange because if going pay something would nice choice ordering it   Perhaps lost translation  <EOR> Great traditional Thai! highly recommend Lemongrass <EOR> We stopped into Lemongrass Aria City Center quick lunch  offer assortment Asian dishes appetizers entrees desserts    My wife noodles rice dish  I can't remember names don't online menu   Regardless names food very tasty   But dish made top experience Sweet Rice Sweet Mango Coconut  could should have ordered 2 more those    Though better restaurants around place good won't disappointed  <EOR> 90$ 4 people drinks entrees 1 appetizer  Huge portions too  Talk DEALIO vegas standards prices   I'd highly recommend restaurant foodies budget since although Vegas tremendous set fancy amazing restaurants offer within most people's price range plus extremely hard book reservations places die Robuchon! run towards middle Lemongrass  strangely dim sum lunch hours   but besides offer comfort food $20 less  Satisfying delicious  restaurant beautiful too  If stay Aria again would def venture over again again! <EOR> The service great food delish decor nice  order your food hot scale 1 10 depending your ability take heat  Really tasty good quality  <EOR> Amazing pho probably best since most places suck local DC MD VA area compared restaurant! <EOR> 5 stars food drinks!   2 stars service! waiter forgot we huge group 8 hard miss literally wave down just bill  <EOR> Ordered Pad se ew no flavor  Very disappointed price  would think beung huge hotel Aria would better quality  <EOR> You find way better food China town  Very plain nothing special average down   <EOR> Arrived Saturday around 2p 20m wait bar full hostess took phone number called when table four ready   eat quite often know exactly order immediately   starving!

Entrees Yellow Chicken Curry w Brown Rice Ribeye w Tamarind Sauce Sticky Rice   Shared each course w family came out     Lots food $135 which includes tip no drinks since full drinks casino still took home small doggy bag beautifully packed   Enjoy <EOR> This place okay  came Lemongrass because 7 00 show Zarkana needed quick fix before in    I really decor small but intimate restaurant  Very cute design  However if end being seated booth those booth chairs SUPER uncomfortable sit at  booths shorter kind forces sit straight entire time  couldn't relax rest back onto without sitting straight  guess  good posture but man imagine sitting straight entire dinner! Sure would made mom happy!!  We ordered various kinds food  Green curry pad see ew shrimp soup cashew chicken  All good but nothing spectacular  prices you're paying I'd say nothing great couldn't smaller cheaper Thai joint    Like said okay  enjoyed green curry but don't enjoy price paying it  Would come back?

Anyway food  food good decently priced especially Vegas   pho $12 bowl? Double pay Oakland but said    Vegas beats paying $70 small steak  friend ordered soft shell crab I think fried rice DELICIOUS  Everyone table loved it  also served dim sum which nice surprise comparable Oakland dim sum  NEVER said GOOD Oakland's dim sum    but exceeded expectations   I would highly recommend restaurant those looking inexpensive bite if they're Aria any reason   OH! Avoid pho though  extremely bland    <EOR> Several REALLY delicious vegetarian options Red curry we added tofu vegan Pad see ew tofu great!! Deliciously spiced    Great ambiance low light but dark   Great ambient background music     lovely expensive quality experience  Close $14 curries       One favorite spots when staying Vegas isn't trashy food nor ridiculously overpriced stuffy fancy    Elegant yet comfortable  Love it  <EOR> I sat bar lunch service great food AWESOME! soup huge craving ever since left there! would highly recommend  <EOR> The best bang your buck Thai Asian fusion strip!  I love food  Vegas despite being culinary hot spot hard find something right me  buffet person  Fast casual great but every meal  same high end dining something special but it'll break bank if every night  Lemongrass hits rare sweet spot being somewhere middle  sit down restaurant nice ambience provides tasty food decent portions all while being reasonably priced   Speaking tasty food Lemongrass carries favorite dishes ever  Mee Goreng  Consisting wok fried yellow noodle fried tofu egg potatoe chili tomato choy sum chicken or your choice beef shrimp hits all right notes  sauce slightly tangy sweet while egg potato chicken add savory flavor  served hearty portion ability choose your level spice  When visit Thai restaurant first time always wonder if going white wash spice level  case level 6 nearly burning palate off just it!   Last time visited waitress even said more Asian her! If mee goreng isn't your thing it should be Lemongrass also offers variety other dishes such rice curry even lobster steak  good appetizers  huge fan spring rolls they're fried don't come right before pool friends swears jellyfish   Usually isn't bad wait reservations advance  staff always prompt friendly  can't say enough good things place  always must when come Vegas! <EOR> The best meal Vegas trip  flight home cancelled sitting plane two hours being told bunch crap  Couldn't fly til next morning  staying Aria arranged come back stay more night nice discount  starving hadn't eaten yet  food AMAZING  husband love Thai food eat often always down try new places  best Thai food ever had  took mom back during birthday trip she loved too  decor beautiful service good prices quantity quality very good  kinda high end but relaxed  <EOR> It 1AM Sat night just left Haze because way crowded couldn't find other friends inside  Hadn't eaten dinner yet met another friend because staying Aria decent sounding places still open wasn't greasy side   Very dimly lit decor along ceiling weaving loom really intriguing  Fairly quite atmosphere but easily accommodate large groups   Our Order Tom Kha Chicken $12 Chicken coconut milk lemongrass galangal abalone mushrooms Chilean Sea Bass $28 Deep fried sea bass fillet shallots scallions Yu Hoi sauce Drunken Noodle Seafood $20 Spicy stir fried flat rice noodles prawns scallops squid Thai basil Kachai bell peppers Ginger Peach $14 Absolut Peach Vodka infused w Black Tea Canton Ginger Liqueur Fresh Sour served tall over ice Watermelon Caipiroska $14 Grey Goose Vodka Fresh Limes Fresh Watermelon juice  The Tom Kha surprisingly strong mushroom flavor overpowered coconut  instead more tart flavored soup fairly earthy tasting which interesting but didn't love it  love mushrooms = I ordered Drunken Noodle w Seafood due reviews saw it  Honestly greasy tasted chow mein  Nothing special wouldn't order again   Why would come Lemongrass? Chilean Sea Bass  cooked perfectly wasn't dry very soft   They drinks good very strong  better $14 drink! Even though came small glasses pack punch  friend's light weight drank little more half cup tipsy  nearly finished both drinks but friend far back room   Wouldn't way come since many places eat Vegas but if same predicament certain wouldn't mind  <EOR> Service bar borderline rude   Prawn appetizer greasy     I told bartender going bathroom right back   When back food thrown away   The decor included drunken girl slouching asleep bar next me   Not expected  <EOR> Absolutely no taste whatsoever foods very plain cold meats tasted marinaded any ingredients added   service very slow lousy busy period  don't recommend it  never come back unless change different Thai chef  <EOR> For Thai restaurant seems lot Chinese items menu  bad thing since still Thai items  Lemongrass option order main menu order dim sum menu both   The wait Christmas day party 4 10 15 minutes which bad all since packed  decor around restaurant elegant well placed Asian vibe  booth where seated very large table enough probably 6 8   condiments available soy sauce which little strong taste hot chili sauce  liked generic restaurant music played background captivating yet subtle   My party ordered dim sum before ordering entrees  Each item dim sum menu ranged 4 50 6 50 which little reasonable  total added final bill  chicken feet four per order very tender flavorful  sticky rice 2 servings per order good flavor nice hot inside slice sausage mushroom pork I think pork   scallop dumplings I think five served per order juicy tasted just right scallops supposed to  also Siu Mai 3 per order which very tender meat filling but lacked flavor  steamed buns 3 per order good flavor bun itself cooked just right but better  Something caught off guard would carts served dim sum did normal rice  off guard because rice staple starch food all Asian cuisine while eating dim sum felt something missing I know actual dim sum food but having wait rice come entrees little disappointing    From main menu ordered chicken chow fun $16 tofu pork Forgot name actual price but $15 20   portions big enough give each person table serving  also offered rice which then ordered bowl brown rice bowl white rice  chow fun did lot flavor all  Even adding soy sauce chili sauce did bring lot flavor  tofu pork did much flavor either  matter fact more tofu pork served us   One thing restaurant would silverware  option use chopsticks but serving utensils silver awkwardly heavy bottom  Whenever would want rest silverware plate heavy handle would force end silverware hit table  caused few accidents moving plates around   Our service OK  served drinks quickly even round refills  Unfortunately whenever waitress would stop she would quickly leave before could ask refill  Even done eating wondered where waitress give check  Despite shortcomings dishes quickly cleared bussers totally ignored  little bummed offered dessert   For restaurant Aria would only high expectations restaurants  best part dining experience dim sum but think much money paid best part should entrees main menu  feel Chinatown order same food would taste better made would only cost fraction price  Service said OK holiday but going place Aria only expects something better everyone else offer  Lemongrass absolutely amazing but left little disappointment  coming back here  <EOR> I try Thai restaurants every city visit far worst come across  mean Thai restaurants strip malls just outside Vegas serve way better food place  Penang Curry bland some reason chicken very chewy both entrees friend did feel good afterwards  Jasmine rice served any entrees even though cost $20 place only if no other restaurant open midnight  Save your money some time visit Lotus Siam instead <EOR> I really place  Girlfriend takes every time LV   Great food fills up   careful spicy rating eat plenty hot wings but ordered Pad Thai level 3 spicy through beer 2 waters pretty quickly   Food very good atmosphere service first class   Really place <EOR> At first very surprised its three star review  realized why meal progressed  Decided come lunch since wanted something inside hotel save time most other restaurants closed lunch  Promptly seated when arrived informed still dim sum being served pretty excited  food Chinese Thai even though call themselves Thai restaurant  So actually pushed around some dim sum cart  ordered bunch things guy pushing cart pretty good salesman because ended bunch stuff he spoke Cantonese well  Most dim sum dishes b n $5 7  Definitely more expensive most restaurants  Chicken feet 3 5 stars

Cold prepared jellyfish lobster prawn satays red curry chicken which ordered 6 10 heat index sweating! Try cold unfiltered sake round flavors  If you're around Las Vegas City Center should try lunch dinner  <EOR> Are people crack? food downright awful! First time Vegas ready some awesome food  staying Aria Thai favorite cuisines thought we'd play safe eating Lemongrass   We started calamari favorite foods chewy bland all around blah  other appetizer jellyfish which probably only thing would recommend  loved sesame flavor  entree Drunken Noodles horrendous  Flavor bland even though requested very spicy seafood even worse  seemed just cooked separately threw top wasn't even fresh  Maybe Southwest just isn't Asian food mecca but didn't think Central Pennsylvania much better Thai food back home  food isn't just Americanized gross especially price I'd definitely recommend getting your Thai fix elsewhere  top off service little pushy taste   they kept trying order more! creepy!

However such disappointment some time before feel need try another restaurant Aria   Especially since second time dinning both places mediocre best  I take some responsibility though having bad experience because we're rush something eat before Viva Elvis   quickly searched before left house just idea type restaurants choose from   Being fiancé visit Thailand least once every year really love Thai food   Therefore excited try place eager replace last memory English pub wasn't exactly delicious    We started off bad foot admit being such hurry only worse there   basically argue waitress spicy wanted food   know round eye but kind scale 1 10 2 3 being medium huh?  always order around level 7 all neighborhood Thai places comes perfect   few minutes bantering back forth waitress finally level 5 papaya salad curry     When ordered peppermint hot tea food instead earlier when she came drink order look received spelled trouble   served green tea instead peppermint then took quite awhile finally wave someone down could fixed   Then food came out     Ugh! The papaya salad seriously worst ever had!  spicy all seemed missing ingredient   curry also very bland thank goodness decided need some veggies last minute because really only good thing ordered     street vendors Thailand could definitely teach cooks thing two    Like said hate focusing negative but save your money small neighborhood Thai place Jasmine Archie's where food authentic service friendly! <EOR> Okay loved everything but especially chili lime steamed cod  Wowie  could eaten two these  good  ordered spicy definitely was  Delicious!  The ambiance great service efficient if little orderly emotionally detached    Prices Strip aren't bad  seen higher much less quality  I'd return! <EOR> The food delicious service very good   Everything ordered cooked perfectly still craving days later   recommend steamed cod thai iced tea drink rum     They some kinks work menu pricing which why won't give them five stars   example charged extra rice which thought weird   portions huge maybe could reduce portion size bit include rice?  But overall very good experience  <EOR> Food good but great  Two meals specialty cocktail glass wine $140 save your money find locals restaurant <EOR> It last day getting ready leave hotel starving spotted place figured would order some chicken Pad Kee Mao go  menu only seafood but girl front said she would substitute seafood chicken also asked sure really spicy   $20 later fair sized order for $20 bucks did expect lot more SEAFOOD Pad Kee Mao cab way airport nothing could bringing back just eat it  say very flavorful perfectly spicy seafood fresh but would preferred chicken ordered  <EOR> Wonderful ambience  innovative decor  open yet warm   Service friendly though Friday night when restaurant quite full fastest place ever   I variety dishes which all quite good * Tom Yum Soup  6 ginormous shrimp great broth lots super fresh sweet mushrooms * Pad Thai fresh delicious  I came back lunch * Pork Satay fragrant tasty * Shrimp roll  tasty   fried noodle wrapped around both great looking delicious * Beef Satay little dry * Dim Sum siu mai stuffed crab claw chives shrimp dumpling whole baby shrimp all delicious * Beef Pho solid but nothing write home about   Lacking certain umami broth  A bit pricey but restaurant Strip casino isn't? but lovely ambience awesome food! <EOR> This great great place late night bite @ Aria!

Idk hypothesize   I gave third star ambiance because beautiful venue  <EOR> After some great experiences other eateries inside Aria hotel decided stop Lemongrass lunch   Being right outside Sky Suites entrance must walked past restaurant dozens times  However noticed never really busy possible indication quality?  decided try ourselves   We walked host stand asked table two lunch   sat promptly   where promptness service ended   seemed longer normal amount time server came over took drink orders   ordered hot jasmine tea water   another extended period time received drinks placed order   appetizers well entrees brought different times but regulated course approach but more bringing prepared   seems reflect poor execution timing kitchen's part   For appetizers ordered Jellyfish Potstickers Chicken Satay   jellyfish dish delicious   Crisp fresh hint sesame but much overpowered dish   potstickers chicken satay unremarkable but good   Our lunch order consisted Phad Thai Basil Fried Rice   Both dishes good safe prepared correctly nothing remarkable any different better any local strip mall Thai restaurant   all reality better certain strip mall Thai restaurants   I expected more restaurant within walls Aria   When compared likes barMasa huge difference quality service food  <EOR> Service slow   Tables booths uncomfortable sit in    but place looks nice food really good   Tom Kha Chicken probably best coconut soup something usually order most Thai restaurants oh man    yellow chicken curry     wow   couldn't stop talking tasty was   Mmm   If you're mood Thai you'll Lemongrass   Just don't expect great service  <EOR> This place utterly amazing!  service world!

Anyway she kept doing awhile before she finally decided look acting somewhat annoyed   When asked table two she responded you'll wait hostess back keyboard   definitely hostess desk there's no mistaking she only there     but ok   waited awkwardly 5 minutes when another woman walked up  Again asked table two she advised would 20 minutes   Fine we'll wait    ended waiting 40 minutes during which time other two came asked name least 3 separate  occasions   Talk short memory   also saw several people walk then seated while waited    What deal?  dressed casually?  type dress shorts t shirt upscale restaurant just because Vegas   dressed Stripsteak night before  But listed CASUAL restaurant category Aria   all  hotel restaurant listings Aria tv channel categorize restaurants formal casual casual   casual   wearing jeans polo type shirt   wife dressed failry nicely she always does     Anyway once finally through attitude door seated service actually very good   food good but nothing spectacular   Being Los Angeles we're used good Thai food 1 3 1 2 price here   If live city where good Thai hard find might good spot try if don't mind attitude  <EOR> Panang curry world  Nice aesthetics good food all around friendly staff  pad thai wasn't best pad see ew super delicious too <EOR> My girlfriend staying Aria excited hear concierge most authentic Thai restaurant strip hotel  stopped late ish snack getting table smooth enough   We ordered shanghai soup dumplings course pad thai   The soup dumplings worst soup dumplings ever had  came strange foil cups suggesting steamed authentic fashion  tasted much more frozen regular pork dumplings contained little no soup far authentic below average best  suspect trader joe's frozen soup dumplings better   Secondly pad thai portion decent but flavor mundane  didn't spicy but certainly shouldn't hold back  no sweetness no tangy ness contained veggies never encountered pad thai before     I wonder if all asian staff ashamed food  <EOR> Even thou pricey food well worth 5 star review  read few review regarding service but experience very good very attentive service clearing dirty plates bringing  fresh plates  ordered beef sate portion little small but very tasty   lemongrass coconut soup also another greatest dish but 2 favorites duck pan Penang curry Thai basil chicken  <EOR> We stopped restaurant heading back room Aria sky suites ftw!   keep short since bit tipsy night lol off two Midori Sours sad know!

My friend sesame chicken $17 small bowl rice $3   pretty good didn't detect any MSG  good  place pretty big definitely enough two people chicken still crispy despite being coated much sauce   Service great food didn't take very long cook although hardly any customers since around 1 30am morning  waiters quick bringing drinks nice enough box unfinished entrees  also refilled waters frequently considering much drank due spicy noodles   Overall really place  spacious inside there's booth regular seating I sitting booths! tables spacious  They're also accommodating larger parties even late night  If you're craving Thai food Vegas looking cheap fill satisfy your munchies then place you  They'll seeing again  <EOR> Food hit miss  salmon spring rolls bomb but cashew chicken sweet sour chicken really bland  Overpriced all around   They also seated table next waiters' kiosk or whatever called basically where waiters input food orders print checks   entire meal waiters hovering over restaurant even close full  asked moved  waiter came back said hostess told he couldn't move because nowhere else could sit  Literally three tables open entire time ate  just view seats  There's whole other half restaurant  Made feel really bitter whole experience  Throughout dinner felt protecting meal waiters standing above me  <EOR> This place really nice decor  just wanted visit Aria since new stopped early dinner around 5 PM  service very good very attentive  even asked chop sticks!!

I find hard Thai place mess Thai food  being said wonderful food! First came last minute reservation rather large group 20 people  Within 30 minutes VERY accommodating would great choice if come convention need last minute group dinner reservation    Food expensive well within budget many people  Especially given Aria many restaurants but rather expensive welcome change  Great food pricing great tasting food    Service staff very accommodating doesn't hurt place itself looks beautiful highly recommend coming here! <EOR> This authentic Thai     very disappointed  Ordered traditional Pad Thai which very sweet noodles heavy mushy <EOR> We find ourselves no matter where staying  Amazing food service drinks  favorite drink watermelon drink menu  refreshing  always start spicy asian cucumbers  Just right amount heat  Next satay chicken satay favorite  If spicy food place you  basil meats amazing  prefer chicken shrimp  Yes heat scale 1 10 but does change play safe  love hot food even much  learned never over 5 6 but again depending peppers feel fire  taste food amazing  never trouble getting lunch but weekend dinners require reservation lengthy wait  bar area open seating  If you're near Aria sure try wonderful restaurant  <EOR> Had good meal tonight Lemongrass Tsingtao Green Curry   Food 7 curry awesome mini asian eggplants they look tomatillos tons creamy yet spicy I ordered 7 flavor     Service 8 Ate bar bartendress very attentive friendly   Location 4 pain ass even 1 hotel over   recommend eating if you're staying Aria otherwise walk home terrible terrible thing      Other bar STOCKED imagine any drink made could ever want   expensive though bottle Fiji water $9 Tsingtao $12  <EOR> We stayed Aria every Thanksgiving week since opened  35th straight annual Thanksgiving Vegas seen HUGE changes culinary offerings Sin City over years  During six nights staying least three dine Lemongrass  pricey? Yep but crazy Las Vegas Strip restaurants  quality selection dishes offered GREAT! yet find bad dish  change order each time always leave full happy  Service always good definitely back back again    <EOR> I thought food pretty good service excellent but wouldn't come if wasn't only places open Aria 11pm   ordered crab fried rice chili shrimp   crab rice good chunks crab meat but dish overall little bland benefitted some chili sauce   shrimp cooked perfectly but overall only marginally better any neighborhood Thai place but 2x price  <EOR> The food great! served timely manner hot  waitress attentive kept checking us  drink never empty someone always came refill it  definitely back again  <EOR> Came place thinking going Thai food seeing Thai restaurant but found actually dim sum every day week couldn't resist  live Southern California plenty restaurants authentic Chinese dim sum place actually held its own them  dim sum exactly other quality dim sum restaurants  drawback dim sum 3 people ended costing over $80    Kind pricey lunch  <EOR> I should gave them higher rating but finished dishes back hotel    straight toilet and    stomach did feel good  think maybe because dish oily  taste ok  ordered stir fried mushroom over rice yellow curry I one <EOR> Ate before going Haze  Unique dishes very flavorful  Overpriced get <EOR> It alright   much better Thai food  good decore but pretty much only thing memorable  <EOR> Ordered take hit spot long night   fried rice $20 but plenty 3 share   ordered 7 hotness scale 1 10 hotter expected    staff seemed annoyed when called takeout when picked but weren't right rude  <EOR> Lemongrass little hidden gem Aria  food delicious quite variety pick from  Chinese Thai even steaks Lemongrass something everyone  personally tried Ribeye Steak delicious! However rather ordering alone did Signature Tasting Menu which included starter appetizer entree dessert $49!  I saw some people saying place overpriced not  Being born raised know quality food Lemongrass offers price great deal Strip  Anywhere else extremely expensive charge fortune    I definitely recommend restaurant! best Aria! <EOR> Panang mediocre  Heavy sweet curry   very spicy   roast duck good crispy but very fatty   Lemongrass soup also disappointment thick no subtle taste chopped lemon grass made eating chewing tree bark   Beer selection minimal   Draft beer consisted Bud Lite    And course prices very high   sure better Thai place found around here  Keep looking  <EOR> Favorite thai Restaurant!! Service amazing! ordered Chicken Satay Shrimp Phad Thai Chicken Curry Fish Cake Yang Chow Fried Rice!! Price pretty reasonable! much food table take home some    Thai iced tea btw win I definitely recommend lemongrass  <EOR> Went during conference  Cuban sandwich lunch  good but bread soggy bottom meat little dry  bad but better options nearby <EOR> Beyond delicious  Waitress very attending atmosphere very relaxing  Sesame chicken delightful  <EOR> Most restaurants chosen Vegas happy but Lemongrass much  Overall Aria slightly strange place  rooms amazing comfortable amazing touch screen technology control everything room bathtub shower area etc  said hotel lobby gloomy casino very dark club just okay casino tables lucky!  Back Lemongrass though  thai fusion all I'd hoped especially much love thai food  I'd happier more normal thai food spot  tried seaweed salad start but send back because strange fishy  other dishes memorable wasn't inexpensive  wine which pretty good but food just worth it  If stay Aria again I'd choose other restaurants sure  actually bit surprised Lemongrass still there  <EOR> First off if customer intends order 2 entrees believe waitress no right tell customer otherwise  husband starving intended order 2 dishes The first thing waitress pointed serving portions really big there's no way he finish it  waitress even pointed another table inform size dish  Anyhow he only ordered 1 entree Won Ton Noodle Soup ended ordering appetizer pot stickers   appetizer arrived very disappointing  pot stickers no flavor very dry  100% sure but feeling pot stickers Costco  Moments later entrees arrived  Won Ton Noodle Soup disappointment well  bland no flavor  Luckily dish Drunken Seafood Noodle tasty but very oily  wouldn't return establishment 2nd try  experience just okay could better  waitress older lady accent  wait staff brought water younger much friendlier   We only tried establishment because food credit staying Aria  <EOR> I liked place mainly atmosphere  also very large menu plenty things choose from  husband pad thai pork neck jasmine rice shared spring rolls appetizer  both some wine which good selection well   The same most places strip over priced food  husband eat lot Asian cuisine opinion just much better more reasonable price  service very good either  weren't insanely busy but took 30 minutes rice ordered meal  ask 3 times before it   I'm sure would eat again but only if convenient  <EOR> We ended boyfriend's father craving Asian wanted something cheaper end Vegas dining  also love Thai food frequent patrons Thai restaurants  place still Strip priced expect $16+ fried rice chow mein but decent where were   The atmosphere nice dark booths dim lighting  service friendly but attentive would liked    I ordered vegetarian pad see ew which comes flat rice noodles broccoli egg tofu  Simple  also green leaf next menu indicating vegetarian options which loved appreciated  Regardless when meal ravenous just dug in 1st bite mix white tofu white CHICKEN!!! UGH!!!

Oh well decided ruin night just because just started scooping soup spoon  hmm    Nice Resto inside 5 star hotel yet couldn't afford laddle   few minutes same waiter came back ladle but half way done scooping soup! He probably realized stupid excuse was! main entree came next  the food mediocre but give 5 stars Thai Crab Omelette really enjoyed one  also Garlic Lime Steamed cod  looks good! but taste total opposite  actually  returned cancelled menu because fish fresh cooked well    am mainly giving them 3 stars because overall experience   <EOR> The only reason giving place 3 stars because customer service  waiters waitresses very attentive always refilled waters checked constantly  food however rather disappointing  already expected everything overpriced because  just is    We ordered something light before flight back home  Chicken pad thai dan dan noodles  already feeling dan dan noodles weren't going taste very good because restaurant supposed Thai restaurant  Dan dan noodles Szechuan cuisine  Just looking dan dan noodles once placed table knew something wrong  Where chili oil flakes minced pork? looked more peanut noodles me  probably worst dan dan noodles ever had   tasted nothing all  pad thai pretty good  strong flavor but very generous its portions   The flavors still however cannot justify $18 per dish   lol  Overpriced unsatisfying  <EOR> This place absolutely superb all around   ambiance great service top notch food best all!

Then came again again last time sorry but weak  First all REALLY Thai food when walk pretty much know ordering  people eating asked server which two dishes he recommended he obliged recommended green curry while basically trashing yellow curry  Well guess likes yellow curry? Yep me! He noted down green curry order but made change cuz he ordered he wanted wanted  first mistake! He suggested rice curry okay expected  Then he suggested order soft shell crab fried rice  guy just wanted pump money! really annoying  2nd time wasn't happy leaving Lemongrass  think find somewhere else upscale Thai fix  <EOR> Went 1 am some freshest highest quality Thai food imagine time  Waitstaff great despite ungodly hour great portions vegetarian selection  Ambience lovely  <EOR> Have this  Asian know Thai food  Bad food wrong order average   service! <EOR> Came during last day Vegas trip  food ok  better Thai food but definitely pricey which expected since located inside Aria casino  Tom yum soup favorite portion enough share 2 3 people  pretty surprised portion soup  expecting individual size but came enough 3  <EOR> This place pretty good but amazing  bunch friends all tried bit each other had  pho just okay  much better! Sesame Chicken pretty good but tasted more Sweet Sour sprinkled sesame seeds little heavy sauce  bad but just would call Sesame chicken   friend vegetarian dish good  rice doesn't come meals ordered chicken fried rice share table pretty decent  chicken itself wasn't great but rice egg good  cashew chicken real winner table  Generous portion lots amazing veggies! could easily shared! wouldn't priority coming place again anything but if you're staying Aria its good food open late reasonably priced compared other Vegas restaurants  <EOR> We craving delicious Thai food sought place definitely glad did!  Located inside lovely Aria hotel Lemongrass bit walk lobby but totally worth it  didn't wait long seated all staff super friendly  decor intimate interesting warm environment   Let's cut chase food drinks  We each different drinks enjoyed each though recommend watermelon    The appetizer let down  Marinated jellyfish which enjoyed before blah  But main courses made that! absolutely ravished spicy basil tofu girls loved curry dishes  <EOR> Very nice wait staff   Good food quick service   ordered take enjoy hotel room   Very nice ambiance too  <EOR> I came 11 other beautiful ladies friend Jen's birthday  sure reservations work because table ready when there  girlfriends met someone all Vegas perks gambler completely free meal minus tip! Free dinner 12 girls + 1 guy? HELL YES!  Since such big group each girl ordered own cocktail  also wine share   For appetizers satay grill sticks accompanied peanut sauce cucumber relish ciabatta bread  chicken lobster beef  also fish cakes delicious   We shared coconut soup didn't really care but  probably biased since prefer tom yum soup over coconut based soups   For main course fried rice pad thai  sure exactly which ones but good   I place because mostly Thai food other Asian influences  Definitely something would come back to   The service great all left happy full <EOR> Pretty much worst Thai food ever had     all dishes miss flavor  Don't waste your time here   My husband ordered Tom Ka Kai soup ok really lacking vegetables spice  also ordered basil chicken panag curry    basil chicken really oily greasy just bad flavor really didn't it  panag curry also lacking spice vegetables flavor just wast there  <EOR> The food tasteless service terrible  no intention returning place  Overrated overpriced  <EOR> Was happy find place open such late hour finished working event off strip    I yellow coconut curry AMAZING! only reason giving 4 stars because added thai iced tea some rice bill over $30  understand Aria but paying much curry just seems much  <EOR>
