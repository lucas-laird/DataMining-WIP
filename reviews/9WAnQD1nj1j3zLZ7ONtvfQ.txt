place weekday no wait good sushi  <EOR> The servers great though food Asian fusion which understand obviously business move Vegas  experience overall good especially since near clubs right casino tables   The chef working time first gave party special sample some cucumber salad which turned absolutely delicious hyped meal    My boyfriend ordered chicken lettuce wraps appetizer which also ended very good addicting    Then Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon came which looked good even though getting pretty full previous foods sake  When tasted however felt deceived because tasted plain cheap being dry  boyfriend's roasted duck also tasted sub par even Asian fusion foods   I ended disappointed entre enough quietly refuse eat but did redeem themselves delicious coffee flavored creme brule  <EOR> got $50 groupon place bunch friends decided come check out  very cute space its dark intimate  would definitely good place take date  service good  food good nothing super special it  definitely pricey  ordered beef tataki fried shrimp calamari ahi tuna flat bread pizza spicy tuna avacado roll i think thats was   didn't any drinks try if come back  <EOR> This place takes your breathe away  decor ultra chic decorated Asian inspired themes  times felt Tao  same buddha statues adorned throughout each room but Little Buddha two gynormous statues sitting back room    I wished lighting wasn't dim was   wanted see all details interior decor  also ran into some trouble reading menu  all good though  all doing whatever takes set mood   I came group girls ordered assortment dishes shared  ordered chinese chicken salad wok fried chicken lettuce wraps korabula pork potstickers spicy salmon scallop roll philadelphia roll little buddha roll buddha's house chow mein w beef   The chinese chicken salad delicious  salad itself made super fresh vegetables  crispyness freshness  sauce came drizzled throughout made salad nice sweet  even good anti saladers myself  didn't piece chinese chicken but friend did mention tasted duck    The spicy salmon scallop roll ordered  Let tell each rolls comes 6 small cut pieces  special rolls comes 8  If you're ordering roll thinking suffice think again  pieces tiny hell  should've known when waiter looked surprise when said all I'd having  Overall rolls weren't all special  much better hole in the walls  wasn't completely dissatisfying but nothing great   The beef chow mein came pretty decent portion  able divide 6 ways  quality noodles beef good  oily heavy normally use to  Again nothing special  probably because Chinese exposed some good chow mein    The service great  No complaints  waters frequently filled waiter came often but much point where annoying  lot men walking around look beefed body guards  totally tell top priority great service  sure if I'd come again but experience memorable  <EOR> possibly 3 5 stars  skeptical but only options while @ palms however left impressed  food very tasty slight twist your typical fusion cuisine  drinks kind sucked though  <EOR> Great little sushi bar inside plams   Only open dinner but dont let deter some really solid rolls including several inspired specialty rolls   A couple friends also ate chinese off dinner menu ornage chicken mongolian beef both looked great anyone cant down raw fish   bottom line If sushi you'll love place  <EOR> I've ate before food great sushi excellent  Last night boyfriend ordered cho mein boyfriend magolian beef really bland needed more flavor  wasn't really good time  cho mein lot better  However l'll still come back sushi dessert great  <EOR> Came Travelzoo voucher 4 course dinner two  We ordered wok fried calamari shrimp ahi tuna pizza appetizers side roasted shishito peppers Peking duck New York strip steak entrees  All dishes pretty good but ahi tuna pizza favorite  each served three different shots sake along meal  actually never sake before nice introduction it  ended meal kona coffee creme brulee  Being avid coffee drinker lover creme brulee would perfect dessert me  But didn't nice crispy top expecting didn't taste any coffee flavor   I liked setting atmosphere restaurant  Overall service good  Although place fairly packed waiter took time explain everything checked every once awhile   I would back again ahi tuna pizza but sure if would bother going back anything else because prices pretty steep  worth going Travelzoo voucher  <EOR> Checking into Yelp earned Calamri app  flavors great but way chewy   We ordered almost same meal ordered Nobu paid $50 less  yellowtail Jalapeno even half good nobu  Plus covered flakes stinky tobiko  All other dishes sashimi good but worth raving about  would play roulette table few more minutes hope win enough upgrade dinner plans Nobu  <EOR> Food gooood!  Ambiance excellent!  The only thing noticed everytime usually groups 8 12 more give small booth leaves no elbow room enjoy meal      even tho open tables back better sitting     dont afraid spreak ask better spot think filling front tables look busy ??? dunno     but didnt sense sit 12 people booth fit 8      decent table back   other service food excellent!    btw cocktails great also   the fish dishes very fresh !  dont miss grilled spiced edemame     yummm! <EOR> When think Vegas think over top   Really nothing ambiance vibe feel Vegas anywhere else world     The decor breathtaking transportive just everywhere Vegas   almost think everything mirage middle desert you're hallucinating due number margaritas pool earlier     Little Buddha asian fusion joint ok but great     Fish most part clean sweet   salmon roll tasted little off me     The highlights King's roll George Roll named George Maloof     But lighting dim can't really see anything   Service excellent calamari shrimp appetizer     Everything else remincient RA HB which don't need travel Vegas for  <EOR> I think LB more experience just dining moment if really nitpick its price point might inclined less generous words  But girl Megs lovely time end feel lighter wallet totally worth it!  10 minute wait beautifully laid classy decorated dining room immediately sushi bar? C'mon         come on  Although idea omakase tempting such lush revered spot Megs offered pass since she self proclaimed noob  Knowing dove into appetizers few rolls just smattering nigiri course cocktails!  Megs opted Tru Blood martini duh chose Lychee Martini  Both delicious perfectly complemented meals  If must starter HIGHLY recommend fillo wrapped tiger prawns  coconut basil sauce comes greatest dipping sauces ever encountered reals  rounded first course tempura veggies forewarned  tempura sauce more savory sweet which nice change IMO  Also  tempura baby bok choy change your life   One house specialty rolls comes marinated lobster top shrimp tempura roll favorite both us  Megs requested try spider roll seriously never soft shell crab tasty fresh well fried  also enjoyed rainbow roll which added order yellowtail nigiri Megs compare contrast common fish types sushi  Lastly just tack order spicy yellowtail albacore perfect  nicely spiced fresh tasting neatly made   I think last sentence pretty much sums up  lovely server helpful but overbearing sushi chefs kind but left own devices  restaurant dark intimate but look occasion see some lovely touches decor  But best part place just fresh everything  no isn't all eat quality most used natch  but much higher therefore tastier pedigree  yellowtail melted mouths TM Megs rolls hardly required anything else other efficient chopstick usage still walked full happy  Yay! can't afford LB every time stop but certainly once in a while treat enjoy! <EOR> We incredible dinner started letting server Justin  take over order us  filet satay great portion super tender  lobster tail grilled perfection  sushi unmatched Vegas Palms role super white tuna sashimi good ordered another one  wasn't live DJ Saturday night music playing very low didn't give great restaurant vibe deserves  back sure! <EOR> Went Little Buddha girlfriend last weekend really disappointed   pretty excited reading reviews but visiting food marginal service average atmosphere kind blah       Saturday night!

Food=0  Service=0  Attitude= 10  Crowd=Normal  Consistency=No  Bathrooms=The best part experience  Overrated=YES  TOP 5 WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCES      For little Buddha manager big napoleon complex  victim Waterdog large party massacre  18 people took taxis Wynn    When arrived restaurant 1 2 empty manager decided split group  He triple threat total liar bad attitude worse breath  When told would Yelp experience he said don't threaten me   No threats many good restaurants Vegas save your money your taxi fare    <EOR> I liked atmosphere Little Buddha   warm relaxing upscale classy   The service very strong   I started bowl miso soup   $5   very good   lots seaweed which gave bit ocean taste   would liked little more tofu   Next platter called king's roll   made rather ordinary things for Japanese restaurant combined way thought unusual   roll several shrimp tempura   wrapped around rice seaweed   then layer spicy tuna finished layer avocado   tasty interesting but didn't really wow me   10 slices $20 bucks   think finishing rolls avocado just made much avocado   pretty rich  <EOR> Comparing other sushi places around town definitely fancy smancy   But food just standard ish picky sushi eating Asians   friend n ordered miso soup edamame king roll sashimi combo ahi tuna pizza   miso soup biggest bowl miso soup ever served Japanese restaurant its almost triple size regular bowl miso soup   tasted bit water down tho   almost if its made ease people into getting use flavor miso   only thing ordered really stood ahi tuna pizza which never seen any other sushi menus   teriyaki aioli type sauce which creates harmonious flavor profile pizza dough ahi tuna sashimi topping   Overall fish decently fresh service nice friendly left place satisfied   probably won't going back unless its special occasion mainly because bill $80 ordered  <EOR> Little Buddha great ambiance very romantic feel it   But other impressed overall experience   servers hosts good but great   food mediocre   portions extremely small high price   Basically much better smaller budget   don't think plan going again future   Things ordered sorry no favorites Kobe Beef Tataki Sizzled New York Strip Steak Spicy Lettuce Wraps  <EOR> One clients brought dinner while town    After looking menu few minutes decided three appetizers split  tried Chili Rubbed Beef Satay Wok Fried Calamari Shrimp Bamboo Steamed Seafood Dumpling   Oh god  shrimp world  beef satay little bit spice but overbearing  other guys loved dumplings much he last one  Darn    As entree decided little daring try Mongolian Beef   little apprehensive mainly because tend shy away spicy food  host gushing much he convinced 3 4 try it  came HUGE platter while dish itself tossed vegetables along side white rice you could also choose brown rice if inclined  The beef perfectly cooked spice overwhelming  also decided try Japanese beer   the name escapes moment  complemented beef well distinct flavor just cannot find bottle Budweiser Heineken  Speaking bottle huge! able 1 1 2 16oz glasses nice buzz well   Loved decor place  seemed would ideal spot take date  Small groups work well music isn't loud prohibit conversation   As most people know Palms located off Strip  Definitely worth trek if ask me  <EOR> The ambiance Little Buddha amazing   no denying place very cool sexy   dark red lounge  inside really nice contrast day glow decor casino     My friends came light dinner before going out   food service very good   Definitely fun cool way start night  <EOR> Intimate trendy delicious  tad bit dark we use light camera phone read menu but adds intimacy atmosphere  sushi delicious  Some best had  price reasonable  also plenty non sushi choices menu  just something really special Little Budha  added places always visit Las Vegas  <EOR> We great service Sunday night before going Playboy Club   husband agree best Orange Chicken long time and order lot!  didn't cocktails bill super reasonable everything ate and love Buddha Bar music! <EOR> *Note actually 3 5 but decided round down due value component evening    Atmosphere   awesome   Service decent  place definitely feels trendy asian fusion moment walked in  BUT #1 most important thing food does food somewhat justify its cost    Cocktails Quite happy them but many incredible $10+ cocktails Vegas hard  give them extra star  godzilla dragonfly reference   Appetizer Rock shrimp tempura  always favorites but bit much mayo  Presentation cute in chinese takeout box but Shibuya just tastier  Decent value size $15   Sushi requested twice all sushi no wasabit all  both hate wasabi  ended ordering yellowtail sushi Toro sushi Palms roll  Yellowtail sushi awesome Toro   fresh buttery chewy fishy! yum! However Toro did wasabi it  Palms roll wasn't good all  know some people no rice thing but thing tasted gooey fish ball  weren't able finish    just wasn't good    Duck Very yummy however $30  rendition duck PF Changs honestly JUST GOOD but $12  realize freaking Palms complaining   just point out    Overall nice evening I'd eat again    but only if dragged friends  many yummy asian fusion places Vegas where drop $150 dinner frequent mediocre spot  <EOR> I love place!  Besides being favorite hotel red decor music most   sushi service top notch well   water glass never reached half full   twice now never bad experience service food drinks   interesting drinks Fortune Cookie Chai Tea Martini Green Ninja   great way start off night date  <EOR> Ext Int Design Classy Service eehhh    Food Presentation Nice!
