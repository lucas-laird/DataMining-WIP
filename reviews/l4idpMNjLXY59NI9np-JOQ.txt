If correct open restaurant middle small mall Chinatown  kind odd setup  Anyway think you'll want skip ahead eat Sam Woo BBQ same plaza  plates traces oil spotted few dried particles food bowls  food just ok  can't really remember which might saying something   I recall some tasty string beans nice servers  <EOR> It's christmas eve definitely crowded everywhere but no organization place whatsoever  Just crowd entrance table no waiting list  Bring your own utensils because definitely aren't enough when bring six plates instead four  best part two tables came ordered food first  wait food usually pretty quick  5 min so  couple adamant requests check food tell order lost  Woot! Tip work your organization skills first  gave free app mistake but when you're super hungry doesn't really anything  quite underwhelmed food  decent but nothing special  you're busy  waiters running around chicken head cut off sweating profusely  give +1 star effort  However busy still excuse lack organization forgetfulness  Yes rant  Don't come when busy  <EOR> I place simply because oddly placed very underrated   I also love fact open late least remember! Until 2am believe  My boyfriend used frequent place much late night cook doesn't speak much English actually recognized last time gave free ice cream dessert!! especially sweet that!  The food always very good! can't say if authentic but flavors just right! would definitely recommend spicy eggplant spinach garlic  fried rice noodles bad either!  Decent prices decent service! They're alright me! <EOR> Yummy tummy   Environment looks hole wall but food count I yummy noddle big bowl hot sour soup fed 3 $1 00 DoLLA!! yAY! post some pictures soon  <EOR> This solely review boba  only boba because mistaken No 1 Boba which across here  3 boba shops serve boba Chinatown plaza alone    Its those things pay for  $2 50 medium drink cheap but still feel ripped off  couldn't boba because ran out  coconut just okay  Could worst  main issue close half drink ice left  know its only $2 50 but loading chunks ice just feel you're getting ripped off   You Volcano Tea Tea Station within couple yards away  shouldn't any reason come boba  <EOR> I sucked into place because 109 degrees outside buy free milk tea boba thai ice tea sign calling name    The thai ice tea milk tea boba refreshing! couldn't tell if seriously good if just thirsty  But way great job boba!   We ended eating dinner here  Ordered four dishes decent portions  No big complaints taste factor  way more satisfied food portions price taste food Sam Woo which complete rip off!     I still feel probably better Chinese places Vegas place Sam Woo   but would probably local know where those places are  meantime if deciding between Sam Woo place would totally come here!! <EOR> This place hit miss  Sometimes food superb sometimes could just average  say come every now then Taiwanese food fix    My usual suspects far dishes ordered 3 cup chicken braised fish pork chives bean curd various cold dishes noodle dishes    Not bad spot eat usually  <EOR>
