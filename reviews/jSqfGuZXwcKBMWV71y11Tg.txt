Do Wiener's Circle Hot Dog! The roll all fix ens great but Hot Dog small almost non existent   Hot Dog pencil thin more 2 ounces beef  I return! <EOR> Great food good value   bought two value meals fries drink char burger char hot dog   definitely return  <EOR> Only time really impressed  Great customer service very clean environment  Angus burger cooked perfection super juicy! friend char dog said amazing!  back!! <EOR> Disappointing give place only two stars being Chicagoan but poker player am continually disappointed fact rarely open!  Yelp page says open until 11 poker room thought open till 11 when tried order food 9 05 boarded up!  am currently sitting full poker room over 100 people closest easiest restaurant closed??  WTH? <EOR> Mediocre  used Pinks space failed  I'd meet moron thought Oh hotdog chain brand recognition didn't work here    let's try generic lower standards that'll trick! doesn't   Double char dog overly charred point almost jerky hot dog  bright side bun didn't fall apart but took two bites no interest finishing thing  good reaction considering $7 hotdog immediate reaction 7 11 place beat  Add mediocrity being cheese  cheese fries likely going only redeeming factor meal but they're out  Monday  Here's idea maybe stock up? Except employees don't seem give crap  Service dismal throughout visit  <EOR> I come Red Rock watch sports hang multiple times per week  small fast food place right next sportsbook expected very little it  food actually incredible  Everything fried perfection despite ordering chicken fingers 10 times now still haven't those dried bites overbreaded pieces just don't taste right  hot dog options taste great pigs blanket perfect fries just way them on thin side but potato y somewhat similar Five Guys   BBQ sauce honey mustard even good price $7 combo fries drink  Great spot  <EOR> I looking forward eating reading online newspaper but sadly disappointed   Made special trip Red Rock casino try Saturday June 28   pretty empty especially weekend   husband ordered polish dog very disappointed don't sauerkraut   originally ordered coney dog disappointed don't serve chili   never heard hot dog place doesn't serve sauerkraut chili!
