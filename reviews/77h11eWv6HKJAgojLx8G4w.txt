Come on!  Eggslut amazing!  best food ever   right outside Marque Cosmopolitan when come club     your egg awaits you  <EOR> DON'T BELIEVE HYPE!   Tiny portions!!! Expensive prices!   Visiting Vegas first time relying yelp brought place    I love good breakfast brunch place being UK visiting regularly always expect good food large portions   place that!   We arrived Egg slut around 11 30am line huge expected     I already decided going 'the slut' famous menu   however during wait line noticed small portion size looked others eating   shocked nearly $15 could consumed average person less minute    little jar eggs slice bread side cardboard container    shocked disappointed then decided change choice menu     I ordered sausage egg cheese sandwich   $12 expected decent size   however left disappointed when food arrived   tasted good but size wasn't great   could eaten least 2 before being content     Our total bill $25 two sandwiches   stupidly expensive simple sandwich batch roll    I seriously don't see big hype   <EOR> This eyecatching naughtily named restaurant famous trendy chain located restaurant area heart Cosmo  Seeing staying Cosmo try it  early morning 8am and   stood line  short line took forever  restaurants fault really more slow people and line cutters blame but if you're rush pass this   Their offerings basic medium easy egg bread devilled egg bread Mason jar steamed egg? 'tates  menu simple which normally love but expected more egg sanity #trademark offered    I ordered breakfast sammie turkey patty medium easy egg cheddar cheese toasted brioche bun eggslut sauce  $8 50 quite affordable given hope expect quality ingredients  Anyone wanting breakfast sandwich should definitely over McDonald's but really didn't see hype about    The turkey patty overpowering larger would've preferred  egg while deliciously runny bright hue orange awkward centered  When myself eggs bet shape them yolk falls middle white  cmon ES  brioche bread though perfectly buttered grilled    brioche pairs extremely well egg eggy bread itself  But beware sandwich packs heavy caloric punch! guessing 1000cal guy    Anyway didn't try anything else  hear Mason jar egg the namesake item special amazing but interested trying it  would pass eggslut  just shrug  <EOR> Worth crazy long line  Waited 25 minutes but man good! sandwiches all great but biscuits just amazing! Service fantastic once counter very quick  Don't scared line because  moves relatively quickly food fantastic! <EOR> Food atmosphere quality all excellent   need recycle disposables   Price also high but Vegas casino  <EOR> Three stars might even generous   totally underwhelming  understand hype over place  buttermilk biscuit bland  say maple butter came very tasty  wouldn't eaten much biscuit without it  also Fairfax did husband well Slut  Slut best item but even underwhelming pretty bland mention small  siracha mayo Fairfax tasty but could've made sandwich home  opinion place worth hype price  <EOR> We found Eggslut when Grand Central Market when first tried it  Ever since Las Vegas location opened become tradition eat Eggslut breakfast brunch item weekend  favorite menu item pictured Gaucho sandwich $15   Although most expensive items menu worth it! seared wagyu steak along over medium egg chimichurri sauce great sandwich combination morning  brioche bun definitely nice touch which even more awesome sandwich choice!   Recommendation definitely worth least try Slut which house specialties cage free coddled egg over potato puree inside glass jar which comes along baguette bread side $10 50   Although name establishment menu items may risqué  beauty remember sandwiches  <EOR> Eggslut must go to breakfast joint when Vegas  Yes lines long during peak hours try during slow times   Best avoid weekends if can! few times between hours 1 7pm during weekday wait line no longer few minutes  favorites Fairfax  slut   scrambled eggs Fairfax creamy onions sriracha mayo cheese brioche bun just overall great combo  portion size slut compared cost may seem pricey but potato puree magicalness worth it! prices bit more expensive LA location but taste just same  restaurant keep original quality 2nd location gets 5 stars book! <EOR> Eggslut far favorite breakfast places  First all name amazing  someone loves eggs relate  menu very simple limited choices easy decide  All meals delicious really sang wrong  sandwiches gooey messy warned  But worth it    Yeah there's long lines  Yeah might lot seats available  But again worth it  <EOR> The slut amazing  sure couple bites dig deep your spoon potatoes  Quick wholesome bite food sure  heir coffee which good but didn't really come coffee hence 5 5 stars still  Def coming back if come through way again!

Eggslut rekommenderas helhjärtat! En av de bästa ställen jag varit på för frukost faktiskt  Dock så är kön oerhört lång varje dag så var redo på det  Men den som väntar på något     <EOR> Delicious egg sandwiches   Fairfax bacon avocoado well worth waiting long line moves fairly quickly  <EOR> If could give review 2 5 would  rounded 3 because staff really nice  review short  let straight it  extremely underwhelmed Eggslut  food isn't horrible but worth 25 30 minute wait line    I ordered bacon egg cheese sandwich  presentation lovely but whatever reason messing AF  sauce kept oozing eventually messed clothes  taste rather bland left lot desired  does Applewood bacon taste good?

Only downside wait line which lengthy but moves decently  Definitely try place if you're Vegas! <EOR> Finally tried place see why there's much hype around but doesn't much me  Avoid lines going mid afternoon 2pm  Vegas should just getting around time anyway  It'll hit spot if you're looking greasy breakfast sandwich fresh oj but I'd rather mom pop breakfast place any day  <EOR> Delicious  should expect line when but moves quickly worth wait  Try orange juice biscuits! <EOR> To compare food theme park food realistic  over priced salty  $4 20oz bottle smart water $4 50 10oz cup simple coffee? even Starbucks charges much  food prior ordering just assemble request rather cold breakfast sandwich  Totally worth it  bacon egg cheese sandwich  Seriously could paid fraction price something similar donut shop  only difference ciabatta bun sauce put which wasn't anything special  think worst part experience husbands sandwich  He ordered Fairfax sandwich  First thing he noticed big fat hair sticking sandwich  cashier requested fresh sandwich  She literally turned around another premade sandwich  no don't recommend place anyone  <EOR> I loved Slut! would've thought over medium egg puréed potatoes AKA mashed potatoes would pair well together?!  20 min line well worth it  turkey sausage egg cheese sandwich amazing too  chipotle mayo perfect along brioche bun  would definitely recommend place but order 1 2 items 1 probably won't enough  <EOR> I've always wanted try place but Los Angeles specifically since San Diego but since convenient when visiting Las Vegas gave try    Fairfax Sandwich scrambled eggs chives caramelized onions cheddar cheese sriracha mayo brioche bun Added avocado extra $2 The bread good soft hard scrambled eggs fluffy good amount avocados very subtle flavor   Overall good but amazing  <EOR> This place definitely hype   sandwich decent but better   few seats coffee really less average   wish picked real restaurant breakfast instead spending fortune fancy McDonalds  <EOR> Pretty bland  amazing  terrible  Long wait small expensive meal wasn't mind blowing  really worth wait but experience guess  <EOR> I've dying try Eggslut LA but super turned off lines  while Vegas decided give try  everything hoping would be messy flavorful taste heaven  bacon egg cheese sandwich without chipotle ketchup   filling absolutely worth trying  <EOR> As name suggests place menu dedicated eggs  first two visits drunken nights downtown  Both times came around 3am  3am there's line  Eggslut Las Vegas located Cosmo second floor across Marquee hence line 3am Sunday morning  Third visit Christmas day  pretty busy food quality definitely decreased    You order Slut if come Eggslut! Its favorite item menu  Prior going no idea mashed potatoes it  give good amount bread but feel free ask more  usually order Fairfax sandwich add bacon  Ive also tried biscuit    Overall if you'd rather super early breakfast night Vegas over Secret Pizza then why give Eggslut try  Better drunchie food versus hangover food lol <EOR> I wanted see myself hype name EggSlut intrigued  am kidding dying literally dying try EggSlut since before even knew getting Vegas somehow dreams came true    Conveniently located inside Cosmopolitan EggSlut found home opinion no other better place then there  Ok much anticipations came before concert hunger mission  Slut mind didn't realized run mornings those  ordered sausage egg cheese burger sandwiches  soon cold brew which amazing added cream sugar    The prices bit step but surprise sandwiches actually quit big  both came signature Brioche buns warm toasty slightly buttery very good  chicken Sausage juicy yummy  Topped cheddar cheese runniest egg little bit if aoli some sort mayo perfect sandwich  burger delish super juicy patty sweet pickles break all savory  tasty surprise    All all good filling gotta love branding  probably come back Slut which didn't try but don't know if pay price daily  $30 something 2 breakfast sandwiches ice coffee pretty hefty budget  Regardless fan would definitely tell people  worth it  <EOR> Really disappointed customer service  Contacted them month ago ignored its almost two months no contacted me <EOR> Heard lot good things place people said must try sorta spot decided check w bf since conveniently located inside hotel staying at  around 10am long line  moved kinda fast though  front maybe 35 mins later  the    Sausage egg cheese sandwich $8 50 Cheeseburger added bacon $13 50 Gaucho sandwich $15 Slut $10 50  When picked food lady asked if first time  slut she told break yolk mix around  particular item pretty good unique coddled egg potato puree chives gray salt but felt other items just average tasting  nothing special sandwiches burger  Service everything fine but pretty pricey bit overrated opinion  <EOR> The breakfast sandwich good but wait far long it  When asked cup WATER person sandwich delivery counter said ONLY BOTTLED WATER !!

P S  apologize calling sandwiches sluts   <EOR> On strip very few choices inexpensive light breakfast tried Eggslut  day before ate walked because line extremely long very limited seating  morning did eat wife egg salad sandwich $15 00 Arugula side salad two bottles water total $34 00  saying worth judge but definitely expensive  <EOR> This best egg sandwiches ever tried! friend shared fairfax slut fresh OJ  really delicious combination flavors  Visiting NY actually heard eggslut SoCal  came very pleasant surprise see them Cosmo! probably good travel far them bc really imagine them becoming regular craving  It'd hard resist! <EOR> Came Sunday around 2 pm line wrapped around corner   Line moved pretty quick!  sausage sandwich very flavorful enjoyed every bite it!

New York eating BACON EGG CHEESE most life there's nothing corner store bacon egg cheese  add ketchup B E C which didn't like  expecting blow mind but didn't  food isn't bad but honestly 3 dollar B E C Any Brooklyn corner store better then B E C  line super long waited 30 mins just order  If your staying strip your fan breakfast sandwiches then should definitely try see yourself but wasn't liking       3 5 Stars Music #SuperLitPlaylist  1 star B E C the buns bread <EOR> After waiting 35 minutes line said Slut! 8 items menu store called Slut  run it  sandwiches average nothing special  Totally over priced  guy didn't even try accommodate inconvenience ! never come back  <EOR> Yes line long  But terrible  wait probably around corner when arrive but should only take fifteen minutes counter  Please your order ready when counter main reason line seems take long people despite having line long access menu still don't know want when counter    We bacon egg cheese sandwich gaucho  Both very very good  taste freshness ingredients used  Also coffee orange juice  husband says coffee great strong while did care orange juice weird taste me    A little pricey but understandable considering ingredients location  Would come again  <EOR> I'm Cali never Eggslut until Cosmo hotel  love breakfast food breakfast sandwiches hit spot long night  Came around 6am Sunday AM buddies  Menu pretty simple    Perfect type food hangover satisfy those late night early morning munchies pretty much staple when Vegas  bit line even hour day  Ordered Sausage egg cheese sandwich  Service relatively quick  breakfast sandwich totally hits spot  Earl Sandwich usually early AM munchies  Now Eggslut added list favorites hit when you've all night! <EOR> I'm slut Eggslut  old hip hop tunes perfectly cooked sausage egg sandwich officially always available good time  BAM! Enjoyed cold brew sandy The brew chocolate undertones smooth finish  Plenty seating delightful customer service  feel though transported back '90s currently supporting character Smith music video  Enjoy flavors friend  <EOR> Love coming breakfast whenever Vegas! Located 2nd floor cosmopolitan pretty easy spot only place ever longass line   ! Line moves decently fast though food comes steady pace  Compared line LA which take hour!!! wayyyy easier   I usually sausage egg cheese sandwich which always point but sometimes soft scrambled eggs fairfax sandwich really hits spot  Both good if appetite try both!!! They're packed flavor even though they're both pretty simple breakfast sandwiches   I think slut basically potato puree egg isn't worth it   super expensive nothing special  <EOR> Went before 8am but still lineup  Moves pretty well  Ordered regular sandwich water  $14  sandwich great egg little runny melted cheese bacon soft bun  Only counter seats managed seat  opposite chandelier bar few seats over there  <EOR> All hype    It potential good but missed mark  Ordered 2 sandwiches added bacon both avo one biscuit cost $36  little pricey simple sandwiches   The line pay 10 min wait food another 30+    I ordered fairfax which sriracha mayo grilled onions  Didn't taste either  much bread enough spread inside  love grilled onions which why chose over slut but meh weren't enough difference  husband easily pleased simple food  He didn't complain burger but didn't rave either  bacon good  biscuit good  Nothing special    I think if less expensive less hassle order they don't take call ahead orders either! then maybe would come again? think side mayo some salt packets could've maybe helped but didn't want ask poor girl counter  She working hard orders while 30 people intensely stared her    Cute concept  Great menu  Just missed mark  <EOR> This place overrated but good  steak egg sandwich which ok  fairfax onions cheddar better but best bacon egg cheese  crispy bacon truly took combo next level  Would come back only if line wasn't long  <EOR> Great concept simple yet focused best   bacon egg Cheese   it best breakfast sandwich had   Also sure cookie they'll warm heaven   If live good OJ you'll love theirs  <EOR> With name Eggslut visit while staying Cosmo! Long lines trendy prices shouldn't keep away breakfast joint  bacon egg cheese sandwich enjoyed very much but $4 50 cup coffee    <EOR> Eggslut exactly needed long eventful weekend Vegas  I'd heard lots good things location LA but never around trying it  pleased learn location Cosmopolitan while friends searching place eat before long trip back San Diego    We parked parking garage inside hotel which costed $7  If brave scorching Vegas heat I'd recommend walking avoid having pay!   The line really long stretched all way towards bathrooms hallway  friends waited half hour  all pretty staying all night two nights row really couldn't wait grub  Thankfully thought food worth wait! food seemed simple  thought they're just breakfast sandwiches right? but sandwich  really good was  Plus love eggs all many ways cooked knew right place  Fairfax sandwich  scrambled eggs fluffy light soft brioche bun came made match made heaven!! flavors shined way chives sriracha mayo  would again sure  boyfriend sausage egg cheese he let bite but think Fairfax more memorable   It's bit pricey sandwich isn't really big but worth trying would probably come back if Vegas again  <EOR> What's better listening your favorite Biggie jams while chowing down fairfax? whole lot  breakfast sammy life's perfect hangover food    Those eggs made oh creamy melt slice cheddar caramelized onions  sandwich would complete srircha mayo? one    The line seems long but moves fairly quick  healthiest breakfast sandwich market but damn sure tasty  <EOR> Oh goodness! wait well worth it  Eggslut delicious food tastes fresh good flavor  fair fax added turkey sausage  loved could your own choose best fit your taste    I suggest going earlier later day  around 10AM peak hour  Still worth every minute waited    There isn't lot seating right outside Eggslut but lots spots sit if walk around bit  two tip sandwich also killer! partner let bite boy happy! <EOR> AMAZING! Only complaint waited last day didn't buy more Slut!  I Fairfax which amazing  almost line elsewhere but someone said moves faster looks which correct  Most people want Vegas shows gambling me! Eggslut why want back  <EOR> Pretty good food slut tasty but very small  unfortunately drinks expensive  $5 mediocre small coffee $5 small bottle pepsi <EOR> The line waiting order just just indication yummy place plenty selections all 3 happy quick informal breakfast   only drawback price very high but very yummy  <EOR> 4 5 Location Eggslut located Cosmopolitan Las Vegas  hard find but if can't just look place long line!  4 5 Service say? If good busy  staff really friendly!  5 5 Food just breakfast sandwich right? Yep but certainly takes #1 all breakfast sandwiches ever far   If ever stop Vegas again Eggslut definitely list visit again  worth wait 20 30 minutes eat something less 5 minutes? Yes  <EOR> This place recommendation friends good  line long but moved pretty fast only took 20 mins front  food good but little overpriced is  ordered Fairfax avacado while good forgot put caramelized onion  Seating area limited well tables also very tiny  Its worth trying but probably again <EOR> While being Vegas recommended must try eggsult  TBH expecting mind blowing  personally that  something new eaten but mind blowing  thing did biscuit honey amazing  <EOR> Save slut Fairfax came midnight craving something savory spicy Fairfax egg sandwich fix  soft scrambled eggs chives caramelized onions spicy mayo cheese but also add bacon avocado sriracha best egg sandwich all time  place consistent really fun vibe  line super long but worth wait Fairfax  don't really recommend slut bc basic  $15 Fairfax way  expensive but still worth it  slut really worth price because master home  <EOR> A visit Eggslut while Vegas or any locations really must! Fairfax sandwich + bacon + avo grilled onions go to Slut side  Yes might seem overwhelming first but just believe cannot leave without trying Slut  Stir everything eat itself baguette smother all over your Fairfax  simply can't wrong  unless don't order all  just plain preposterous!  Some tips line long but  any place Vegas  little early around 8AM catch breakfast line won't wrapped around corner back again  Seating limited  party 4 less unless don't mind being seated together  also Cosmo couches but would recommend sitting table scarf everything down  Skip OJ worth $5 imo  also cannot cup water bring your own bottle  carried around bottle ice water stay hydrated 100+ degree weather anyway didn't bother me  enjoying your Slut remember return glass jar wall pick area! <EOR> Swung while waiting room ready  Even 1 30 dozen people line ahead me    Ordered cheeseburger egg over hard though menu said over medium  Runny eggs thing  Anyhow good juicy burger  Messy grab some napkins  hangover cure sure  suspect ordered before mind    Took 15 minutes burger  warm salted chocolate chip cookie first  Maybe over hard take longer  Couple people received order first  No matter! We're Vegas until wee hours hit town    Burger $10 plus $2 avocado choice avo  Burger came alone  No fries chips etc  Yet decent deal especially Vegas  <EOR> I believe hype    Stopped weekday brunch ordered slut  many other reviewers noted creamy mashed potatoes topped perfectly coddled egg some seasonin's chive grey sea salt jar along slices toasted buttered baguette    The line wrapped around corner quite restrooms but women ahead did take long time ordering which bit frustrating however cashier manning two registers order taken efficiently    I don't typically order orange juice but did delicious! fresh squeezed? Possibly!  I concerned seating but people tend eat since type place lounge time order came within several minutes secured spot along high top    At first taste salty but  because didn't mix supposed to  egg yolk right amount ooze warmth  When did stir whole thing good its own spread onto bread which perfect amount toasted chewiness    I would say if starving would filled up  feeling might peckish perfect amount food    I debated keeping jar but nothing discerning any other jar left designated recycling shelf  Otherwise waste compostable!   Very happy made last meals Vegas  <EOR> Fairfax sandwich just promoted hotel room channel tv  mine turkey sausage avocado  PERFECT egg sandwich! eggs creamy tasty! Highly recommend! 6 50 am open 7 already line 10 deep  Worth wait back tomorrow! <EOR> Very disapointed  Dry nothing special worth wait  single egg bacon cheese roll wuth chipotle ketchup   When walk look most people don't finish food  Sorry guys me <EOR> PRO Delicious fast line reasonably priced food items except beverages    CON limited menu comparison LA restaurant limited seating    What see you'll get  Full deliciousness  Add other items especially avocado  <EOR> So good!  Very messy sandwiches   Lines long   Price fair staff friendly   If busy expect wait several minutes but food worth waiting for  <EOR> We discovered Eggslut last year when came Vegas now must stop every time go!  I tried Slut under specialties menu once haven't able convince myself try anything else! poached egg perfectly cooked which sat top potato puree glass jar  Topped salt chives there's perfect combo! also came couple slices baguette which just little tough side  love poached egg potato puree leave alone but maybe try put potato puree next time!

Hence 3 stars  <EOR> The hype over place silly sandwich wasn't anything write home fan over  fan place over overpriced even Vegas really any better then Jack n box breakfast sandwich under $5! Don't wrong its horrible but just didn't leave going wow amazing  size sandwich left hungry  line ridiculous long 15 20 min wrapping around corner probably more cause hype  Plus wait varied all 3 ordered 1 other 5 7 min difference order being ready  kitchen appears efficient but its not  Skip save yourself $10 Jack n Box off strip  But if want improve reduce cost sandwich buck two offer side hash browns work efficiency kitchen eggs bacon sausage ready saw them  Work getting orders faster line moving quicker  <EOR> There's usually line reason sausage egg cheese sandwich unreal  cold brew also great  wasn't crazy biscuit I'd probably skip next time  friend Slut very impressed but didn't try myself  <EOR> Yesssssss     Eggslut!!! enough its own although lovely simple ! sandwich myself friend split Eggslut  Perfectly placed Cosmopolitan   any Vegas hangover cured concoction     fixed    ready round two three! <EOR> I'm pretty sure Eggslut LA location tastes slightly better  sausage egg cheddar although brioche bun nice soft cheese perfectly melted egg left something desired  Maybe left stove longer necessary    The line short 10am no complaints customer service only down side location much la hardly any seating    If Vegas I'd stop some breakfast late snack nice break away buffets burger joints  <EOR> Eggslut pretty popular new breakfast spot there's another LA specializes egg dishes breakfast  came hot air balloon ride since meet drop off spot close Cosmopolitan  actually ended dropping off Cosmo which really nice    The goal food eat food then back hotel nap since gotten 4 30am morning  line long but very quickly  ladies counter super nice very helpful    I split Fairfax Sandwich cage free soft scrambled eggs cheddar cheese sriracha mayo warm brioche bun Slut cage free coddled egg top smooth potato puree poached glass jar topped gray salt   honest both super delicious own way  really hard decide which better!

LOL The sandwiches good  Eggs cooked perfect!! would totally keep going back breakfast <EOR> I egg sausage cheese sandwich   good but feel place hyped making expectations high when food waiting 15 20 min line wasn't good thought going but still good   Small cup OJ $5 maybe  just because location strip however   If you're going early day skip line  <EOR> Awesome breakfast sandwich   ordered mine biscuit instead brioche bun literally best Breakfast sandwich ever had    If line long no worries because does move fast worth wait  <EOR> I definitely see popular spot  Great young college kids people looking spend grip buffet breakfast  Nice breakfast sandwiches fresh bread  recommend asking no ketchup comes standard sandwiches don't ketchup  Right outside club affordable  $8 50 avg per sandwich  hoping would more menu but popular egg slut specialize in  buy coffee  $5 good  Just grab Starbucks your way right your food  <EOR> Yelpers really ganging giving slut quite pounding   I know Vegas all but there's something said easing being stiff    criticism times    For last few years getting breakfast Earl Sandwich Planet Hollywood welcome having Eggslut just across street Cosmopolitan alternative   Earl's tends slightly burn buns whereas Eggslut's brioche buns bigger better   I recommend FAIRFAX $8   Although breakfast sandwich comes fork because really ahem loose messy soft scrambled eggs other ingredients such sriracha mayo cheddar cheese caramelized onions coming it  also added avocado $2   sandwich doesn't blow me   away nor expect that but packed flavors nice another quick casual option Strip   I'm fan long lines especially slut already hit   up few times LA but only 10 min wait Monday morning around 8 30  Sometimes when restaurant expands there's concern they're spreading themselves thin but food tasted same LA which basically food truck style    MAIN DIFFERENCES DTLA LOCATION no bar counter seating but communal table rather having Broadway backdrop Chandelier longer hours open til 7p slightly higher prices  The best part Egglut being inside Cosmo? Instead finishing spot take slut back room  Woooooooo! <EOR> Probably some best eggs while! Namesake eggslut basically poached egg top creamy mashed potatoes served toasted baguette slices when dip them into egg yolk oozes forms sublime curry mixture  side salad arugula red wine balsamic dressing manchego cheese which felt very well Eggslut  husband Fairfax Sandwich turkey sausage which also really really good  scrambled eggs sandwich ooey gooey seasoned perfection   Breakfast champions!! <EOR> I ordered bacon egg cheese sandwich  few delicious bites realized something missing egg! gonna call yourself Eggslut include egg??? back counter tell them really nice it  made another sandwich free charge decided omelette slide    Despite eggless fiasco would come back place next time Vegas  also tried friend's Slut order tasted instant hangover cure  orange juice refreshing well  <EOR> Just good original La  Even better when its comp'd  <EOR> Easiest 5 stars EVER! talk fairfax?

Ordered mine avocado bacon  little overpriced breakfast sandwich but still amazeballs  brioche perfection  soft scrambled eggs mmmmm  Must try!! <EOR> What say eggslut     tough one  Los Angeles tell location over much better essentially reason reason only PRICE POINT  same time sense because Vegas location itself cosmopolitan!   The sandwich itself extremely good  sausage egg sandwiches added avocado  total came 15 dollars sandwich cup orange juice  Nothing amazing juice itself but sand which definitely hit spot long night partying  Just right amount applewood smoked bacon avocado ketchup extremely good well    All all would recommend if plenty time  line always stretches around place itself take 30 minutes order your food  worth wait? personally don't think so  4stars sandwich being good  <EOR> Eggslut just type breakfast place needed add into life! Love LA brand made Las Vegas!! If love egg sandwiches much must have! <EOR> It pains but     After coming few times great experiences chose Eggslut breakfast while having friends town  waited line then when came turn order should run hills  I ordered Gacho sandwich no bread no dairy  specifically asked if any type cheese she said no  cashier asked if wanted turn into salad said sure  friend ordered bacon eggslut sandwich  Upon receiving order asked guy delivered white stuff covering salad was  He said cheese  I returned because told them couldn't dairy I'm very strict diet right now he cashier come over  She told she said wasn't dairy sandwich she never said wasn't cheese salad   Now does any sense  understand sandwich $16 didn't want lose but going argue paying guest? front ton other guests mind you  told I'd gladly pay another order but absolutely cannot dairy  said no would just new one  15 minutes pass finally receive correct order   I bit into meat ice cold egg luke warm  Even boyfriend Andy NEVER complains commented cold was  Also friends bacon sandwich burnt could pinch fell apart  Completely charred   Fast forward 5 hours later    food poisoning  never return  <EOR> Was looking breakfast brunch place found yelp  disappointed! Gaucho Sandwich tasty!! wagyu cooked perfectly chimichurri sauce just right touch  also never wrong brioche bun  Just soft perfect sandwich  Wanted try homemade biscuit but thought much bread try next time come back  There little wait  down hall but did take long person line told us  Maybe 20 minutes top before food hands   Will definitely come again next time town! <EOR> Tried place last day vegas really good!

The soft scramble tasty melted cheese but $2 charge avocado bit overkill considering wasn't even sliced bruised  overall package quick tasty satisfying breakfast but expect line wait your order prepared  7 45am Tuesday  If you're staying Cosmo don't want far safe and overpriced bet  <EOR> Don't mislead long line wrapped around restaurant reasonably fast worth it! ordered Fairfax $8 50 avocado +$2   also add fresh cut bacon the guy literally cutting right front us for extra $3  sandwich hit spot  love fresh brioche bun served with  chives caramelized onions melted cheese chipotle mayo all paired well together  would definitely order again! <EOR> love love loveeee it!!! came dancing drinking marquee! opened 24 hours! would definitely come again!!! everyone should try it!!! <EOR> Eggslut located Cosmopolitan Hotel Casino  really love name thrilled give whirl  line relatively short Thursday noon ish  service okay however happy specialize sandwich no meat added arugula  orders prepared correctly didn't wait long  lunch date thought presentation could better but casual to go type eatery fine seemingly eco friendly containers wrappers  reason three stars because brioche bun dry stale? really impacted sandwich big way  fresh soft bun BIG difference! would try place again but if another stale bun I'd probably ask redo even though hate gal guy   <EOR> IMO good super stellar world but good nice change usual breakfast fare  when no line  sure I'd wait long line food  Ingredients fresh good quality  Fairfax soft scrambled egg caramelized onion cheddar brioche added bacon nice hearty sandwich  bit much sriracha mayo though  odd experience Slut poached egg over potato puree jar chive sea salt served toast   really did first bite   but kept eating more bites more liked it  Lol  eating decided liked more Fairfax  figure  also salted chocolate cookie  good but seemed expensive $4 50   Counter service  Limited seating   Overall good place egg sandwich if line isn't long  Expect Vegas hotel prices like $8 Fairfax sandwich $11 if add bacon   would back try other sandwiches  A OK  <EOR> Line wrapped into hallway restrooms  1 hour line  Food good but worth money all  50 bucks 2 breakfast sandwiches sodas bit much  Even Vegas  <EOR> I am officially obsessed Eggslut  Serving delicious egg sandwiches course namesake restaurant Slut place gets long lines if try you'll see why   My favorite sandwich Gaucho which involves wagyu tri tip chimichurri sauce  bread all sandwiches soft fluffy perfect breakfast bread  also love getting Slut  mind blowingly good  coddled egg placed top jar Robuchon re SUPER buttery mashed potatoes  mix all together egg kind cooks potatoes  Spread provided toast party your mouth  getting arugula salad put top that   The only bad thing Eggslut can't really without spending around $20 person grab breakfast  Also line  Just try off peak times afternoon early morning    aren't many seats head Chandelier bar nearby if can't find seating restaurant  <EOR> This hangover spot year    ingredients all fresh Oj very good   line long but 4 am where place ingenuously located opens 12am!!  really breakfast sandwiches convenience  key! <EOR> Overpriced overhyped underwhelming but still solid hangover cure  Stick sandwiches skip Slut    The lines long when visited 11am morning wrapping around counter where customers order    The sandwiches pretty expensive additional costs customization  tried Slut Bacon Egg Cheese   The food came pretty slowly  Overall took around 30 45 minutes order food definitely fast endeavor  Additionally don't cups water only expensive bottles  only bar table 10 seats    The sandwich honestly pretty good but amazing  Slut mediocre bland   I won't coming back  <EOR> Everything delicious!

I'm obsessed place plan coming much every time Vegas!! <EOR> After intense clubbing night Marquee friends decided grab quick late night snack before heading back hotel  Even though live LA actually never opportunity visit Eggslut try its menu  Pretty buzzed ordered Slut which essentially coddled egg potato puree mason jar couple slices toasted baguette drizzled olive oil side  aftermath mixing egg potato puree together rich thick mixture super flavorful  acts spread put top crunchy baguette  someone never really eats midnight snacks finish entire order myself    I'd say Slut pretty damn good! <EOR> Came breakfast during trip LV  Heard good things place   cosmopolitan hotel   Easy find park    Quite crowded   glad came here   Surely food did disappoint   Ordered slut sausage egg cheese sandwich   The slut tasty   Lightly salted bread dipped into jar egg mashed potato   Quite innovative tasty  sausage egg cheese upscale egg mcmuffin pretty good too   definitely fulfilled      I recommend getting early  line long  But overall decent breakfast experience  return if town again  <EOR> Went place only because downstairs  fan sandwiches but end finding tasty  Soft bread melting scrabbled eggs perfect each other  should married Vegas  <EOR> In words Mr  Peabody adequate but hardly extraordinary    I did relish placing order cashier slut please  easy know  kept straight face  picking found few seats remaining sat down  Across three rotund black women all enjoying own breakfasts well  lady middle asked eating? A slut answered  bet didn't know gonna eat she began laugh  did I  She there    Ok fast food done reasonably well  ignore all reviews costing much  Tell something doesn't town  come fun never mind cost  Having said Eggslut might opted small Mason jar instead teeny weenie size  But selling plenty them don't imagine upsizing anytime soon   maybe larger jar would require two eggs egg potato ratio just right  then charge more not know anything restaurant business    The slut doesn't seem mashed potatoes soft boiled egg but rather just potatoes cooked right puréed chives salt added  Potatoes could little warmer  Egg properly coddled  All all good enough    Did also biscuits  okay but perfect  But might them    Not sure I'd way Eggslut but neighborhood? Sure  <EOR> Not gonna lie pretty love place  don't store NYC now craving it!  I Gaucho seared wagyu over medium egg red onions arugula  Just reading ingredients alone salivating! would definitely recommend getting this  I also side salad orange juice  lot arugula though since side salad all arugula which also comes sandwich    With almost only crazy expensive options Vegas great place quality food affordable price  <EOR> It's all hype! Just another hipster place people flock too  unimpressed  line curving around building thought treat  WRONG! Other brioche bun special ketchup sandwich average  bun just way thick eating bacon fatty had remove bunch sandwich egg nothing special just over medium egg    The side butter milk biscuit disappointing  texture   We ended paying $35 dollars 2 sandwiches biscuit split two iced coffees    Pass!!   Bye Felicia! <EOR> Definitely think place little hyped up  Don't wrong items delicious! doesn't love good egg perfectly runny yolk? just find place slightly pricey is  friends ordered several different items shared everything  eggs cooked perfection expected but burger patties buns very mediocre almost dry  Most importantly still hungry finishing full $10 15 burger just petite 5'2 girl regular healthy appetite   Verdict Come give try if line isn't long but I'd say experience more enough  <EOR> It pains but     After coming few times great experiences chose Eggslut breakfast while having friends town  waited line then when came turn order should run hills  I ordered Gacho sandwich my favorite salad instead bun  When order came bun immediately took cashier she asked if wanted remade  said yes  watching them remake slid meat off onto bed lettuce handed back me  meat cold then asked if could heated up   she said expect remake whole thing? Now does any sense  understand sandwich $16 didn't want lose but going argue paying guest? said no would just new one  15 minutes pass finally receive correct order   I bit into meat ice cold egg luke warm  Also friends bacon sandwich burnt could pinch fell apart  Completely charred   Fast forward 5 hours later    food poisoning  never return  <EOR> LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED!!!  Perfect wake greasy awesome amazing filling necessary freaking cool breakfast hangover Vegas'ing     Eggslut LA good   Eggslut LV   could be   yes is    BETTER!

We came lunch Sunday then came back again myself right before early Tuesday morning  But before into food let's some details way   Location Cosmo huge pretty easy lost looking Eggslut  closer east side hotel grouped together other restaurants eateries  SECOND floor third directly across main entrance Marquee the main club Cosmo   If follow signs restaurant area Marquee then should able find Eggslut pretty easily   Hours Eggslut some weird hours sure check before going  noticed over weekend open Sat Sun midnight till 7 pm assumed would similar hours throughout week  But nope hours only Tuesday so random! addition Sat Sun  close everyday 7 pm though come early if want grab dinner here!  Lines place popular but lines all really depend when come  first time when came around 11 15 Sunday ended waiting line hour before turn order  second time came around 1 30 am Tuesday hitting Marquee time practically no line  if you're planning come peak lunch times definitely expect long wait   Seating very limited seating within restaurant area itself  lot people took orders sat down nearby hotel couches eat  Just keep mind more casual dining spot fancy sit down restaurant full service   Food tried both sausage egg sandwich well Fairfax sausage addition thoroughly enjoyed both  warm brioche bun along great egg sausage  friends all ordered two while zero talking all busy savoring deliciousness sandwiches  Now  know food good! I also tried signature side dish slut but much less impressed that  essentially sous vied egg + potato puree served glass jar 3 small baguette slices  mixed sous vied egg potato puree together jar could taste egg all only potato puree  You're supposed use spread baguette slices but puree salty just wasn't enough baguette slices it  don't understand side dish pricey but would recommend unless really want give into hype   Price Eggslut definitely pricey side though think sandwiches worth it  Eight dollars sausage egg cheese sandwich seems reasonable especially given Vegas prices  However signature dish slut worth $10 paid it  <EOR> The wait long Monday morning service pretty quick however location nowhere comparable LA  Everything extremely salty especially eggslut  <EOR> THE FOOD AMAZINGGGGG new favorite place ever!!! literally crave it! <EOR> This great quick stop food  reasonably priced Vegas but line usually pretty long  egg sausage sandwich honey mustard aoli perfect  egg cooked medium some yoke broke but didn't overcome sandwich  <EOR> Long line snakes around corner brunch but wait time approximately 20 minutes if stand line next restroom  Seating bit limited offers trendy seats  Just split stand line look seats  Gaucho sandwich which Wagyu tri tip steak egg brioche bread AMAZING  star deducted because meat could more seasoned but tender chewy all  $15 totally filling worth it! <EOR> I never thought would ok spending $20 breakfast sandwich orange juice until came eggslut  fairfax orange juice goodness amazing  combination soft chewy buns creamy savory eggs juicy sausage crazy  never breakfast sandwich orange juice weird people would eat them together  having them together eggslut always pair breakfast sandwich orange juice <EOR> **$5 Coffee ***  Soooo     yea      bought breakfast sandwich coffee which totaled $18  pleased myself but say    crave breakfast eggs all day  made peace reminding myself price similar SF Oakland    The sandwich amazing     savory scallion taste  quite filling !

Line usually wraps around corner down hall   guy taking orders kept line moving then really stalled waiting food  Turns ticket skipped    While best experience I'd probably still recommend maybe try sandwich next time  <EOR> We breakfast 2 3 days town  colleagues also dinner evenings   My favorite fairfax eggs scrambled beautifully    Coffee average  <EOR> Eggslut amazing    gaucho long night drinking dancing heaven mouth   bachelorette party all girls raving food   standing line write review noticed mostly negative people review things wanted give positive perspective if want some deliciousness your mouth eat Eggslut  <EOR> I'd visited original Eggslut LA's Grand Central Market few different occasions found bland overrated every single time   When friend insisted visit its latest incarnation Cosmo skeptical   Turns skepticism justified   The food essentially identical what's served LA occasion but  necessarily good thing   long ish 30 min wait order Thursday morning quickly received egg salad sandwich took seat neighboring Chandelier bar chow down   Unfortunately sandwich decidedly average   My gripe Eggslut food transcends all locations blandness   egg salad sandwich undoubtedly fresh high quality but tasted nothing   Any seasoning all would've made sandwich better   Some salt maybe?  little pepper?  Maybe crazy add some heat acidity?  realize goal eggs star but eggs pretty basic flavor wise   need seasoning need desperately   I also cold brew coffee   very good strong  markedly better cold brews most casino cafes   But cold brew couldn't rescue experience   Until Eggslut starts giving its food some flavor doubt back  <EOR> So really wondered hype breakfast place does eggs waiting reasonably sized line breakfast agree place delicious  egg slut fairfax basic egg bacon sandwich share  slut delicous combo mashed potato egg crostini  fairfax really well cooked scrambled eggs bun  sandwich price really good  solid breakfast las vegas wont cost much place worth visit  <EOR> Probably favorite breakfast place Vegas BUT love egg sandwiches little bias here  drawback little no seating  If you're planning stay Cosmo take room then you're cool  Don't pass place up  amazing! <EOR> Pretty good but very limited options   Gaucho  warned lot bread all sandwiches runny egg very difficult eat   suggest getting egg cooked over hard over medium   Coffee good but warned drinks expensive    Water cost four dollars   place far expensive is  <EOR> I very excited finally trying Eggslut  waited 30+ minute line experience  However soon next line order 3 guys walked cut line  Patrick manager allowed said fine because called ahead yet still placed order spot  incredibly disrespectful all waiting line guys somehow preferential treatment  coming back   And sandwich only okay  <EOR> We stopped Eggslut breakfast morning impressed above beyond accommodate husband's gluten allergy  food amazing! definitely eating again! <EOR> I would definitely suggest going Eggslut if going Vegas!  husband early around 8 8 30 only couple people line   sat eating food line kept getting longer longer would suggest getting early if don't feel waiting   pretty quick line moves fast   bacon egg cheese husband sausage egg cheese   sandwiches delicious!! also both fresh squeeze orange juice which wasn't huge fan but husband really liked it   Eggslut must try if going Vegas need breakfast! <EOR> Stumbled upon place during very early and rare morning walk through Cosmo   Gaucho ive never breakfast quite this   excellent   friend simply bacon egg cheese   Very very good   If breakfast buff love meal try place some point   definitely back <EOR> It good sandwich  turkey sausage egg cheddar  wasn't worth $8 50 30 minute wait   But good <EOR> Line ridiculous! bit pricey small sandwiches but else new Vegas  enough seating rush hour  But food good was  orange juice super sweet! <EOR> If your hurry want quick delicious very affordable breakfast spot!

Maybe fact close closing time  sure   The other problem since loose scrambled eggs omelette style keep falling sandwich   For prices don't want any weak links chain sandwich  <EOR> I surprised crowded random Thursday  maybe 10 people line ahead us  Fortunately line moves fairly quickly  chooses few egg sandwiches signature offering eggslut  opted egg cheddar bacon sandwich brioche bun  almost many workers diners which impressive  many people might reasonably expect sandwich would arrive hot but sadly case  cold egg bacon cheese thing envied  really sure even happens considering many folks fast serving food  top featured chipotle ketchup thing found neither necessary nor value add  enjoyed he experience but would rush back  Oh freshly squeezed OJ wonderful  <EOR> Not gonna lie line sucks!

Orange juice really good fresh little pulp  Also tried slut mix coddled egg potato purée first time trying type dish liked except very salty  order comes few baguette slices asked extra bread  Limited seating but found open spot chandelier bar eat  <EOR> I feel location better LA but same time drunk sure   The line longgggg but long secret pizza decided just food instead  sammiches come hot burned myself taking first bite   Sammiches delicious! <EOR> The eggslut something akin coddled egg over mashed potato great concept  execution visit didn't quite arrive advertised  The egg cooked perfectly well  maneuver way back cook station salt pepper  chives salt missing order salt pepper tables  ??? Eggslut really busy place wasn't happy working way back through crowd  The mashed potato good flavor if watery  The fresh orange juice didn't taste fresh  said companion flavor exactly same well known frozen orange juice concentrate  ??? My friend liked Gaucho Sandwich order   I'd definitely again  Next time double check order before sitting down enjoy breakfast   4 stars concept vibe great people loving staff  Short execution price  <EOR> If you're looking light flavorful breakfast MUST come here  Even though looks small perfect portion   ordered specialty called SLUT cage free coddled egg top smooth potato puree poached glass jar topped gray salt chives served slices baguette  delicious flavorful just perfect size  Yummy  very hot seemed fresh made order  also ordered buttermilk biscuit house made biscuit served butter maple syrup   biscuit average butter sweet my kind butter    Eggslut seems very busy place regardless location because seen line location Downtown LA  Eggslut location inside Cosmopolitan hotel  around 11 00 am huge line I'd say 20 30 minutes wait left   really wanted try made sure came back hotel 3 00 pm hour before closed    This counter service style restaurant so    Unless no itinerary willing stand long line probably should  If don't want wait suggest did come right when opens before close  loved can't wait try other stuff menu most likel Fairfax  Gaucho  Enjoy! <EOR> There lot hype behind place  Pretty simple menu but presented very unique way  Fairfax sandwich great signature slut creative yet simple  Really hit spot very nostalgic childhood days sipping soldiers into soft boiled yolk  Prepare yourself decent wait worth getting coffee Milk Bar around corner before joining line <EOR> This delicious breakfast sandwich  line but moved very fast   Easy find Cosmopolitan which isnt true all restaurants inside casinos LV   bacon sandwich loved it   sister enjoyed sausage one  She did care meat used  think flavored sage which over powering but otherwise yummy   Did try slut itself but looked odd dont know if could eat it   But next time am Vegas definitely back here  <EOR> The line long which normally would minded  However waiting all time sandwich luke warm  <EOR> Wanted try sausage egg sandwich but ran sausage 8am???  guess open midnight   fairfax   good   Rich   cookie because craving one   hard crunchy   guessing tried reheat it   hoping it'll crisp chewy but really disappointing   Would come if line long?  No  <EOR> I've heard lot hype egg slut decided try while Vegas  say little disappointed  When egg slut line wrapping around but only took 15 minutes order area  slut gaucho fairfax  ordering took another 15 minutes food  thought fairfax gaucho both okay  felt pretty greasy  honestly food combinations before friend commented could same sandwich home if tried  Obviously both couple steps fast food breakfast sandwich but wasn't spectacular  slut basically egg top mashed potatoes  Again okay but think place overrated  would rather try other breakfast places then come back again  filling but didn't match everything heard before coming here  <EOR> BEST EGGS VEGAS HANDS DOWN! dont even eggs but needed good protein fueled breakfast long plane ride  <EOR> Despite anytime come prepared wait sure your phone fully charged bring reading material because long wait but rest assured wait totally worth it  friend husband decided come brunch 2 weeks ago Saturday morning night somewhat hard partying Vegas  all cranky need carbs cheese grease soak activities night before  waiting seemed seemed life time 30 Minutes finally front line order food  Fairfax sandwich cookie biscuit  hubby Gaucho  sandwich absolutely amazing !! sriracha mayo mixed scrambled eggs exactly needed funk give kick wake snap bad mood  Probably best breakfast sandwiches' ever eaten entire life   Due martial obligation give husband bite sandwich which did reluctantly  He totally blown away he even said sandwich much better his  biscuit unfortunately cold but tasted would amazing if heated up  absolutely recommend place breakfast brunch lunch even snack  Delicious !!!!!!!! <EOR> Me Hubs venture Strip every often just come here  We're crazy cause there's always long wait place always packed  would think all simple egg breakfast sandwich? But tell there's nothing simple sandwiches! Fairfax which scrambled eggs cheese chives caramelized onions Sriracha mayo brioche bun  simple sounds delicious!!! only giving 4 stars because last time ate eggs shells scrambled into them    <EOR> Hella good! Simply put  Woke time spare before flight back home  headed over cosmopolitan check highly recommended trending place  girlfriend follows instagram page! Hellla good  friend bacon egg cheese cheeseburger avocado  cut them half best both worlds! yummy fulfilling  <EOR> So LA hearing Eggslut past couple years but there's always giant line figured I'd check fuss while we're staying next door  still pretty big line but nothing LA moves pretty quickly took 15 minutes line several dozen people Having now tried give 5 stars *only* Fairfax + turkey sausage ordered easy decent scrambled eggs but next impossible *perfectly* scrambled eggs scrambled eggs Fairfax *perfect*  fairly substantial sandwich tasty  Worth standing line which good because be  tried bit wife's classic bacon sandwich which I'd only give 4 stars good but agree *that* much better basically same sandwich just less expensive base ingredients any fast food place's breakfast menu several dollars cheaper  would way Fairfax much other sandwiches    And solid 0 stars $5 biscuit which just tasted biscuit  told would but she no love biscuits bet theirs amazing price  Nope good biscuit but really 5 bucks just regular sized pretty good biscuit?   They also apparently gave order someone else exchange sending order back front queue tossed free cookie which nice them cookie tasty enough clearly fresh but again nothing special certainly worth $5    So if average everything tried together I'd probably give place 3 stars  Luckily total control don't feel doing because Fairfax good  just    don't those other things Fairfax instead? p <EOR> Yuuuuum!! hearing eggslut long finally try it! line around corner took 30 minutes order  Fairfax sandwich yummy  added avocado bacon some texture heaaavenly  only sandwich light perfect afternoon late lunch  ordering food ready within 5 minutes  <EOR> Well say eggslut    life party!  I told several people must breakfast  dragged husbands wynn all way cosmo test out  bit disappointed when saw 15chairs available line size circus waiting  Damn  Clearly everyone memo  Typically turn around somewhere else but since made trip fight out  45mins later ordered brawled 2 chairs not really but story better  I fair fax husband sausage egg  also biscuit share  meals great besides tasteless biscuit BUT worth wait! hour breakfast sandwich hay didn't blow mind just worth it  I'd only return if stayed cosmo no line    otherwise sit down restaurant do   Still giving 4 stars good food! <EOR> I heard great things Eggslut staying Cosmo wanted give try  line super long when arrived around 8am figured good  waited line around 20 mins  didn't realize once ordered another very long wait another 20 mins  all great things heard overall disappointed  decent breakfast sandwich but certainly worth wait  guess others must different experience because very popular but could without  <EOR> Located Cosmo  Open late  Such yummy food!

Honestly McDonalds Dunkin Donuts breakfast sandwiches nearly good half price   included those experiences cup coffee hash browns decent customer service without shamelessly asking tips   I'd opt next time  <EOR> Yes line long  Yes seems takes forever especially if until 5 6am  But moves faster then looks worth it  cookie whatever breakfast sandwich desire  classic biscuit can't wrong with  isn't place just tastes good because your hungover really taste heart soul fun put into food  gets people going when LV! <EOR> I excited see no line eggslut midnight  actually thought closed  woman nice even showed jarred egg specialty looked but decided since actually hungry should bacon egg cheddar sandwich  Wow perfect! came fast hot right amount cooked runny egg  Love!

Located Cosmopolitan modern edgy breakfast counter totally fits right in   When arrived just before 10am line crazy long almost deterring   But slightly hung over craving glorious yellow decided tough out   line moves fast 10 30am placing orders register  Here's scoop  *The Slut $10 A quick impulse add on order but probably highlight meal   Soft cooked egg over hot smooth potato puree garnished salt chives served baguette slices   DELICIOUS  *Fairfax $8 +Sausage $3 Soft Scrambled eggs done perfectly!  overcooked dry regular scrambled eggs get  Sirracha Mayo added nice kick   Brioche bun soft buttery   sausage add must don't think would enjoyed much without added salt protein element  *Sausage Egg Cheese Sandwich $8 50 husband's order   He said good but he better  just your basic breakfast sandwich   He also mentioned would better sourdough although am big Brioche fan actually agree   sour tang would paired great creamy egg yolk   But then again San Francisco home famous Sourdough  *House Made Buttermilk Biscuit $5 served butter syrup but would better warmed up   piece slightly dry crunchy   $5 would skipped one  I should also mention purchased coffee $5 which size Starbuck Tall nothing but simple brewed coffee   Definitely overpriced  Everything Eggslut great!  If ask husband okay   But still worth IG pics  If nothing else definitely Slut!  Pictures descriptions justice! We back again Eggslut! <EOR> Not cheap but best bacon egg sandwich ever had  Period   Sometimes expensive worth it    them <EOR> I'm sucker funny name Eggslut  fun chicken tracks imprinted floor recycle sluts sign garbage referring glass jars Slut comes in   food par humor   I Fairfax added bacon avocado brioche bun  ingredients fresh held own all other flavors  lots reading space but couple trebles there   There line but didn't take long everything fresh made right there  <EOR> Delicious!  line bit daunting but moved really fast  $5 coffee little excessive but food totally worth it  Fairfax Slut worth every calorie   Want back try everything menu! <EOR> I'm always good egg sandwich breakfast   such wife give Eggslut try   arrived around 10AM Monday morning   short line but moved fast since menu very concise weren't many customization options consider orders taken efficiently kitchen pumped food very steady pace   wife shared Fairfax $8 soft scrambled eggs chives cheddar cheese caramelized onions sriracha mayo brioche bun w bacon add $3 Slut $10 coddled egg top potato purée cooked small Mason jar topped chives served toasted baguette slices   Fairfax hot fresh satisfying but messy somewhat difficult eat trying keep all together   light airy brioche bun true star sandwich   Slut simple yet delicious   Honestly outshined Fairfax country mile   Eggslut bit overpriced?  Perhaps but thought use fresh quality ingredients justified price   Eggslut horrible name restaurant?  no prude but may off putting some which would shame since Egglut easily best place breakfast Cosmo  <EOR> Food good but patient line warps around corner  need every city  <EOR> The prices bit high side would want pay food but Vegas must pay Vegas upcharge   I ordered bacon egg cheese sandwich Gaucho Slut bringing total almost $30  sandwiches aren't anything write home but Slut pretty good I split friend wasn't filling   coddled egg served little jar keep memento if feel washing all egg bread grease it!

While price would prevent visiting often think every now then when feeling rich I'd stop delicious egg creation  <EOR> I start description place saying wow!!!  loved concept eggslut   wife wasn't crazy soft boiled egg   However even if you're all need stir you're good go   fairfax sandwich insanely tasty both times went   wife egg salad sandwich   second time she fairfax   She liked fairfax much more   service slow because high demand   However totally worth it   much twice 4 day period  <EOR> Basic best  Definitely most expensive breakfast sandwich paid for  bacon egg cheese sandwich  Restaurant nice but isn't something come back for  <EOR> Tried the slut $10 GOOD!

All menu items just sounded convincingly good especially egg sandwiches  <EOR> As avid Vegas traveler very difficult find affordable food spot within Cosmopolitan hotel because things way pricey far walk I lazy ok??   Eggslut opening probably best things ever happened entire city Las Vegas   The line varies depending hour restaurant but overall line moves fairly fast  menu offers selection sandwiches other breakfast items price  definitely competitive other restaurants in around hotel  regular order would bacon egg cheese sandwich add avocado ask scrambled egg instead sunny side up   it's PERFECT    There extremely limited seating space don't expect always find seat easily  would best find seating area within hotel bring your room if seating crowded  <EOR> This place lives hype  bacon cheddar egg sandwich which delicious  husband sausage egg cheese sandwich  both liked much 2 other times ordering same thing on different days course   sure fresh squeezed Orange Juice good! <EOR> I haven't LA since stayed Cosmo Vegas trip convenient come here!

But he said also really good if needed more info   I little antsy food establishments where you're sure if you're going seat but people move through pretty quickly many other places sit if end having takeaway   As might might expect vibe younger side  Even if you're hungover person sitting next likely is  You're good company  <EOR> There comes point your Vegas adventure where begin crave normal  Something  shiny marble sparkling marquee decked crystals but rather something  just straight good food without flair  Enter Eggslut Cosmopolitan hotel   Crazy name aside just place serving darn good egg sandwich  egg cheese sandwich  Fairfax also looked really good but when given choice between fried egg well fried always wisest opt fried egg  Keep mind don't packets salt pepper which bit weird breakfast joint but they're happy give some salt pepper little plastic cups   Oh important note coffee pretty terrible you'd much better off walking Starbucks lobby Cosmopolitan  <EOR>
