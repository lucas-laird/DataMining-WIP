You can't 2 dog special fries $6 when other places town charging $6 + single dog!  Their beef sausage combo good any Chicago  hadn't almost 2 years really good stuff although bit expensive   I think just recently added gyros sandwiches menu other night  other stuff portion ample made care  only gripe using pre sliced gyros don't whole spit rotisserie setup  would encourage them whole setup  know must expensive outlay originally but having good gyros lineup completes Chicago menu nicely   The restaurant looks family run place  All people behind counter real Chicagoans put necessary care into food really respect tradition  shows quality taste   If want your own Chicago cook even sell all dogs beef sausages buns fixings pound take home   I'll continue back when can  opening Henderson location? <EOR> This best hole wall mom pop restaurant! highly recommend making Vegas must visit place  <EOR> Love place quick bite lunch time weekend  Great food good service character  Good prices  sure check specials calendar each month fun promotions free hotdog today if your name Dan Diane awesome daily specials food  Also carry some Midwest soda lot people vegas never had  <EOR> This place good reminder great all the fixings dog be   much Chicago rocks!  problem put sweet peppers dogs  exactly abnormal know  burst bouncing betty mine all over every time bit into hot dog!

We ordered two corn dogs #4 best both worlds hot dog 3in beef sandwich #8 chicken wings mild ranch special day 16in sausage fries drink   Everything pretty good! fries soggy nor burnt  chicken wings aren't smothered sauce which appreciated  gives chance put much little want  even enjoyed little ones because spicy    We around 3 30pm dined in  only 2 other parties eating there  However while 4 other people came did orders  <EOR> Dipped!  If know beefs know mean      So they!  Nuff said  Authentic hot dogs polish sausage     Maxwell street style  Pizza puffs!  If you're new never tasted TRUE Chicago hot dog sure without all junk just ketchup  <EOR> On last visit experimented little tried Hamburger ordered medium rare   Although burger came medium fresh lettuce tomato onions exceptionally tasting dressing still very good enhanced Tomato Ketchup Mild Yellow Mustard soft Sesame Seed Bun   Spicy Mustard also available     Fries greasy but hot tasty   even though lunchtime course would leave without first ordering then downing entire Italian Beef Sandwich well   time impressive sammie 7 1 2 inches greatness featuring beautifully seasoned dipped beef oodles zesty Sweet Green Peppers   Tables regularly cleaned soon diners left   service friendly before   Another 5 star lunch! <EOR> May found new favorite lunch spots  remember trying few years ago wasn't all impressed  Being Chicago area trying find some good food decided give another try found enjoyed much better  Hot dogs sausage sandwiches very tasty especially price  100% authentic being Chicago? No but closest found town <EOR> Interesting  order item without making combo total over $12!   Normally don't take into consideration price but didn't help food tasted bland  Felt waste money  sandwich literally came just bun beef sausage  Anything else somewhat flavorful pay extra  asked them thing still forgot it!  Maybe tried wrong item but compared actual Chicago food no comparison! <EOR> They wings amazballz   sauces delicious   usually Chicago heat however today decided try habanero sauce  Another wonderful flavor best wings Vegas    The chili fries good   try hot dog    Both worth it  Yummy!!   I also enjoy corn dogs  can't forget cheesecake stick  <EOR> I usually eat other location near house Henderson which also serves Pizza but location just good 95% authenticity scale    Gonella brand Italian bread most places Chicago use but impossible find west cost prohibitive ship  probably another brand bread  available around  more Gonella which would boost authenticity rating notch two but all nit picking aside Windy City great choice opinion even better more authentic both Rossatis's pizza pub Al's which supposedly Chicago tradition recently closed 2 years business Las Vegas <EOR> I Lake Mead thinking trying Hanshinko's tacos getting frustrated Windy City's boy am glad did! fries bomb  chicago <EOR> Best fast food burgers Vegas   am local but Chicagoan food reminds Chicago fast food grew with  <EOR> Disappointed beef definitely roll  roll supermarket quality  <EOR> Consistent great food  Grew Chicago beef sandwiches  best   hot dogs beef products straight Chicago don't disappoint   Each visit consistent food quality friendly staff leave full stomach  <EOR>
