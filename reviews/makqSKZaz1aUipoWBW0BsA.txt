STAY HERE! <EOR> Don't fooled closest walk strip    good 10 15 minutes if walk briskly  might sound bad but when multiple times day gets old really quick    Also check most aggravating thing world  You'd think when late checkout your room key would continue work until time but no ours cut off almost two hours before checkout time subsequently locked out  really fun riding elevator down entire building waiting line front desk 25 minutes trying keys reactivated  basically made late checkout pointless since spent entire time outside room trying back in   The real kicker? 25 minute wait front desk getting key reactivated riding elevator back 10th floor    KEY STILL WASN'T ACTIVATED  TIME ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!!  The hotel clean staff decent would better if cleaning team room across ours didn't just stare entire time we're dealing say sorry can't let into your room     even watching down front desk 25 minutes only key STILL INACTIVE but most certainly wouldn't stay again    Seriously crap hotel  <EOR> We always enjoy Westin chain  hotel just off strip block Flamingo Bellagio easily walk down catch water show which runs every 15 min night  don't fancy lobby any attractions Westin but don't mandatory gaming machines small bar  If looking Las Vegas 4 5 star hotel then Westin doesn't quite meet Westin standards simply because high end hotels Vegas tend much more spectacular  But if all want quality service quality Westin heavenly bed then hotel conveniently located all Vegas offer  When stay also find convenient use back road runs parallel strip quickly hotel wherever want go  hotel does outdoor pool heat 24 7 but  kids  lobby almost entirely taken bar gaming machines very little space where kids allowed     hence 3 rather 4 stars    <EOR> I crashed boyfriend's room because he conference can't comment price but hey hey hey pleasant experience here! 2 minute walk Ellis Island $6 99 steak potatoes veggies beer!!!!!!!!! pretty close Strip  plenty parking  beds comfortable! blankets keep warm  Don't smoke your room!

Since happened read other reviews Yelp Trip Advisor people experiencing same problem  unacceptable needs addressed  mention needs some customer service training handling types situation  When $478 mistake customer definitely needs feel being taken care of! Whoever dude answered phone told call Hotwire     left horrible impression really Westin look bad   If booking directly them don't expect experience problems     very nice quiet hotel  small casino lobby well Starbucks bar restaurant  Customer service experienced prior situation great  errors came lady checked charged card instead taking payment Hotwire dude totally did take care did know handle situation  <EOR> I know happens Las Vegas should stay Las Vegas but can't resist telling world won mini jackpot machine called red hottie   1 star Found teeny weeny little blood stain long narrow pillows which very untypical Westin Hotel chain   felt completely grossed threw pillow ground   Normally Westin hotel feels very clean fresh but felt thousands people stayed room before me   Ewww Yuck <EOR> Understand if looking Vegas experience don't come here  here  Even if put items aside still experienced issues stay   First even though facility appeared undergone bit face lift   well just didn't lift quite high enough me  rooms   even if decided put flat screen television which did does mean room better  carpet worn over air did work very well  Frankly sauna no matter many times tried turn down  beds okay  just couldn't past worn room seemed  addition very small  lot wiggle room two full size beds   oh  right size bed  am five foot five inches  When spanned arms across bed hands dangled over  Weird  am happy did share   On plus side 24 hour Starbucks site coffee maker ROOM! locate geared towards business travelers  24 hour gym which quite nice actually considering just come place where gym closed down 7 pm    I know Vegas should drinking causing general chaos 7 pm trying work out   WiFi spotty much wound turning own hot spot rather deal it   As stated before Vegas experience  located few blocks strip someone mentioned before don't believe would walk myself night strip back hotel  fact didn't someone  grabbed cab rather then debate whether may uncomfortable   So nutshell if business traveler wanted nothing else other business amenities then would probably check place maybe   Oh   and stop saying casino location   just because splattered few machines your lobby floor okay maybe more just few does in head course qualify casino  description disappointing especially when using third party site attempting describe facility  <EOR> The Westin Casuarina started off wrong foot  Nobody checked in time 4pm yet checked 11am still no room available official check in time 4pm   many other people waiting lobby well  Yes very busy opinion just bad business hotel  service however outstanding very apologetic gave $25 dining comp   whoopy  recommend hotel restaurant  rooms very unmemorable but Vegas never really room anyway  many other Yelpers said bed very comfortable  plus place very small hotel don't walk mile find exit many large Las Vegas hotels    If looking glamorous lights flashing music pumping casino bells ringing Las Vegas stereotypical kind hotel it  bad choice however if want something more low key relaxing easy access strip meetings etc    I ended Westin Casuarina due Priceline and 4 star hotel all    I probably would stay again because Vegas glitz but if want something more low key place may you  <EOR> Overall good experience Westin Las Vegas Hotel Casino  friends taking quick weekend trip Vegas stayed Westin first night   We arrived middle afternoon spent rest day Strip really only spent time hotel sleep shower    Upon check in front desk clerk very kind helpful  room good condition met basic needs  room didn't great view however fine didn't spend much time room   We didn't any bars restaurants hotel nor did use any amenities spa pool gym etc  but say casino portion hotel really small therefore suggest going somewhere else gambling    Also hotel off strip  10 minute walk strip   If you're looking basic hotel suggest going Westin  However would stay somewhere strip closer fun stuff  <EOR> So if you're staying Strip time said  Westin it'll probably still fine said   Nope  to clarify stayed recently business trip didn't choose where stayed PROS room clean nice view the High Roller well Palazzo Wynn the a c nice cold albeit noisy it nice toiletries also some essential oils type stuff use before bed  bed comfy comforter complimentary water front lobby although temperatures 100s kind need that  easy uber Lyft pickup drop off right front hotel   CONS arrived pretty early first day around 11 a m  room wasn't ready  wasn't super surprised but did put request early check said sold both days would text when room ready  Check officially 4 p m  texted around 3 p m  because change more informal outfit business casual outfit conference did downstairs bathroom  accidentally left sweatshirt last time saw it  contacted security but call them 3 times before even called back only tell could find sweatshirt  obviously wasn't fault couldn't find but fact contact them three separate times ridiculous teeny tiny casino 20 30 slot machines if that  signed slot club right before left because $5 free play  tried two different machines wasted $5 each them never $5 free credit  asked cashier insisted already used $5 did not  FYI they're also getting rid casino which would explain why half machines dead non functioning  fridge key which could see being useful if also minibar but not  Therefore every time wanted water fridge open key  floor room uneven which rather strange ie if put marble down floor would definitely roll  check in efficient first time checked only regular front desk person two Starwood Premiere whatever called front desk people  Eventually Elite front desk people started helping other people  When check in second time still took 10 minutes  hear your neighbors write sounds person next door blow drying hair  Luckily mostly quiet neighbors   For someone used staying better located hotels Bally's Paris Strip hotel very disappointing me  group rate $120 per night feel rate could stay somewhere better location least  especially disappointed considering Westin Westin Starwood Hotels usually pretty good  There's also $24 99 day resort fee which laughable pool  it  Guessing also pays wifi two free bottles water room which replaced daily say nice    Overall just meh hotel  <EOR> Stayed just past weekend two nights  two nights stay housekeepers walk room 4 different times without even knocking  Might add all late night    <EOR> I past weekend one night stay  booked Westin based most affordable price along comfortability  checked Saturday process fairly quick easy even given complimentary upgrade bigger accessible room  room restroom spacious king bed comfortable  loved ammenities bathrobe even lavendar balm promote better sleep  only stayed night sure if ideal those want around action strip  big party goer would probably stay again quiet hotel  <EOR> We stayed New Years Eve weekend found hotel adequate   price amazing compared major hotels strip charging   entire staff dealt very friendly helpful   room slightly dirty but nothing even worth reporting time   ice machine broken floor which caused minor inconvenience   did use hotel amenities mission party!  Westin close many things though which nice   valet folks super friendly nice   I also enjoyed speaking Michael Concierge   He doesn't technically work hotel but he provided ton useful information   I'd stay again right price if needing place near central part strip  <EOR> Horrible stay away  pool towels asked twice towel never one  Mind your paying $29 amenity fee day amenities  room housekeeping came 1 asked if could come back later said could come back hour made sure left when came back still clean down front desk six house keeping back  took 45 minutes being phone them figure charge card apparently supposed charge $50 night incidentals only charged night $15 76 cover amenity fee second day  Hard ahold managers literally simply connected manger's phone ten minutes just voice mail  call back multiple time manager  rooms popcorn ceilings room shower handicapped person which might nice if wheel chair but if then literally hold hoes hand hold could put another shower head non handicapped people  <EOR> If looking decent internet hotel don't bother Westin Las Vegas   wifi isn't even fast enough decent video chat connection   multi week business trip wifi seems only good text email   Even trying load video takes good time commitment me     The Westin markets Heavenly Sleep but wish wifi would wake up  <EOR> On way back hotel dinner saw sign said $3 dollar craps only during certain hours whole day which extremely hard find near strip  westin isn't exactly las vegas blvd might little hard find but across street bally's next bill's gambling hall which now being renovated  decided stop play  casino pretty small but okay size because wasn't busy  If wanted play bj craps roulette just walk play w o waiting which pretty cool  lot people associate westin just hotel casino maybe  why wasn't busy   Anyways reason give two stars because problem crap's dealer particular woman  She extremely unethical misleading  She would try look newbies take advantage them  She would help them play same time tell them put couple dollars down thinking bet made but she really doing making bets herself  example if button 8 she would say give 4 dollars put hard 8 but she did put 2 dollars hard 8 she would put 2 dollars hard 8 her  When button off she would say give 4 dollars put yo 11 she would put $2 dollars put $2 herself  She doing throughout whole night couple  play craps lot know bet she tried same but caught moved away she stop hustling stealing money bets herself   She pretty attractive lady she accent think she Europe something  Watch her  She very sneaky  may think she being nice trying help bets but really she just making bets herself  played crap's almost every major casino strip well old strip never any dealer unethical stealing money people  feel bad couple she took advantage all other customers she took advantage of  Hopefully pitt boss finds she doing stop  4 5 dealers crap's table she only asking money people place bets herself dealers  <EOR> So when writing review property can't think normal property resort setting  LAS VEGAS  HAWAII  people who've reviewed hotel way did actually feel embarrassed you    I've GREATEST STAY!!! NOONE rude some stated rude you  Internet wasn't issue some stated  lobby does smell stale smoke some stated  really think those who've reviewed hotel need stay Motel 6's Travelodges  Reviews yours embarrassing people LEGIT reviews things matter    STAFF = WONDERFUL  INTERNET = WORKED FINE  SMELL LOBBY = WESTIN BRAND  PERFECT  SMOKEY    As someone works hotel find appalling people arrogant smallest things hotel    LAS VEGAS WESTIN    I'll back!!!   Moses concierge desk = AWESOME!!!!! <EOR> Nice hotel love location  casino great much hustle bustle  Clean rooms being platinum members nice view  <EOR> This hotel could lot better but decent    There seems truism Vegas hotels if inexpensive probably isn't renovated surest way tell looking TV  Casuarina room given recent trip Las Vegas stocked relic Zenith CRT which tells pretty much things went    The carpet rooms torn near door some places very obviously so  small tears but big rips floor look huge gashes much neglect  room poorly erased graffiti which looked product drunk stoned adult unsupervised child maybe even both  surrealist semi erased poetic musings provided interesting couple showers  way markings visible all over tile bathroom shower wall parts bathroom exterior   There's also resort fee which standard fare but no free WiFi internet accompanying it    A few friends also booked rooms checked theirs same kind general neglect   The Casuarina casino but honestly why would when many more lively options block away?

While wasn't during terribly busy time seemed relatively easy locate parking space adjacent parking lot garage no matter time day  The WiFi very reliable  I'd actually probably rate hotel 4 5 if Yelp would allow it   prevented 5 star rating? I found elevators little rough   insert your room key then press your floor   key would work two six elevators   little annoying   also noticed several elevators graffiti them   Nothing major offensive but just don't expect see high end hotel Westin  I wasn't impressed Starbucks lobby  morning down ordered coffee frappucino made almond milk   tasted terrible wasn't fully blended   sure if coffee used burned if almond milk date   don't blame hotel but if going Starbucks site should consistent other Starbucks aim high standards catering Westin guests  Lastly asked check in approximately time would leaving day check out   noted would probably early work trip   When plans changed called guest services line request later check 11 a m   told check fact 11 a m  would fine leave time   noted phone when checked asked provide check time concerned note made house keeping   told would note change but low behold morning check housekeeping knock attempt enter room while still there     None three items noted above would prevent booking Westin again though   overall wonderful experience definitely keep them mind future Vegas trips! <EOR> was beyond disappointed  Friendly check but room small box room view nonexistant shower no water pressure couldnt decent reception much less wifi cell top off when asked receipt given one  dont offer receipt if nothing billed but yet charged 50 resort deposit   resort???

Aside gambling *else * 110 degree heat other visit pool? very well done Westin  appreciate tried gussy live DJ few lovehandled cocktail waitresses nice attempt Starwood but when only 30 people anywhere around pool given time hardly worth it  If car sneak into Wynn did   I also EXTRAORDINARILY happy hat non smoking hotel  didn't wake each day smelling death  Yay!  One last thing  don't let Westin people pull $10 day hotel services scam you  If book through Priceline negotiated total  when you're ready check see staff surreptitiously slipped billing notice $10 day hotel services march your Vegas sunkissed ass downstairs nicely demand told meaning letter then sweetly but firmly refuse pay it  Because bullshit  price gouging   just hope you're drunk and or hung over notice  They'll probably tell ok we'll waive but JUST ONCE say ok then remind yourself stay again  way your righteous negotiating least save some money if you're staying anything longer night  <EOR> We stayed last night Las Vegas road trip Utah back   little bit off strip behind Flamingo Linq Hotel   small casino lobby some slots few table games   early check into room played little slots then couple cocktails bar   Being early afternoon Sunday bar practically empty but friendly bar tender made some good drinks even comped first round   front desk valet staff very attentive customer service friendly   Being Starwood Preferred Guest automatically booked high floor once room ready   better room originally booked   only staying night looking anything fancy but did appreciate upgrade   love Westin Heavenly Beds   so comfortable!  Also full service Starbucks too   would definitely stay again  <EOR> I feel kind bad complain hotel   Kind guilty even   dont really know why   totally clean comfotable updated tell trying chic fun but really wouldnt stay again   Its bad location definitely younger crowd   casino small restaurants stay open late     However really liked pool  <EOR> Ahhh Vegas     This time around group girls decided Westin  strip but close enough walk it  Remember if heels does count end calling taxis strip as did     As hotel It smelled beautiful when walked in  floral arrangements everywhere which instantly made place  decor absolutely beautiful The rooms clean modern ours KILLER view strip  check smooth everyone very accommodating    The staff incredibly sweet met every need  doorman housekeeper everyone simply amazing! cannot stress comfortable all felt Westin!   The hotel free happy hour snack reception guest amazing!   hotel happy hour casino hours which fun  casino tiny compared rest casinos strip but then again cares Westin primarily hotel  Overall experience great  hotel overall peaceful calm not regular insane Vegas ambiance   personally loved Westin! Peace calmness crazy Vegas! Five stars!  Viva   insert cliche ending here  <EOR> I deal off hotwire specials where don't tell hotel name until booked  bummed first but happy trip  don't know why place rated low  girlfriend just came back two days everything very pleasant moment walked moment checked out  service very friendly room clean beds HEAVENLY  didn't want mornings    Yes pool small music kind mellow but easy find place put your stuff down best part it didn't spend $400 bottle $20 liquor just place lay  I'd also recommend some better airconditioning casino area air thick smoke eyes became irritated immediately upon entering    It's also very short walk strip  behind Bally's if hot day enter Bally's straight Paris Planet Hollywood there!   I'd stay again recommend anyone else doesn't want deal mega casinos crowds  <EOR> I've seen better  Hotel standard lack cleaning maid service shitty   I called down house keeping come clean room she said didn't clean it?  told no time usually clean your room she said before 4pm told well just room its 4 35pm right now she apologized said ill send someone right up  gym little over hour phone call when back room beds made  thats all nothing more just beds  didn't empty trash replace towels floor just made beds    Horrible House keeping   The rest Hotel seemed pretty nice Gym clean Fresh fruit cold towels when done working out   The casino lose lose situation you'll never win even come few dollars  Maybe its luck table but entire party 28 people same luck little strange   As SPG member id look else where    <EOR> Very good location being off Strip  Extremely friendly staff  Appreciated free bottled water supplied being Starwood members  room end hallway pleasantly surprised quiet was  Room clean comfortable  Would stay again! <EOR> We great experience! Check easy rooms clean rooms quiet needs met  Reasonable price close strip    I would also love give shout maid did best leave room decent shape but killed it  Organized toiletries towel bathroom picked few things left floor  felt room well taken care absents without feeling space violated    5 stars 2 thumbs up  <EOR> Albert front desk did fantastic job helping front desk  He corrected reservations issue  food excellent hotel restaurant lunch  Marcus waiter very helpful <EOR> Choose your own adventure! hotel perfect people excitement Vegas but aren't looking 24 7 party relax well!   Its such short 5 minute walk strip! friends all stayed @ MGM same weekend probably 10 minute walk just hotel leaving room walking down loooong hallways waiting elevators walking through crowds past theaters casinos etc  happy calm lobby Westin welcome home each night!  This hotel all amenities bigger strip hotels but smaller scale without crowds  small casino area where seems odds better bigger hotel casinos Starbucks hotel restaurant breakfast buffet great! gift shop pool even spa which excited try next time! also a convenience store just 1 5 minute walk front doors yes yes very convenient! Plus if decide want huge flashy casino drunk frat boys smokey atmosphere strip right block!  Some other Yelper's complaints seem unwarranted me  stayed hotel 5 6 times various floors never any problems  don't see many signs wear tear all  rooms decorated very modern no hideous flowered bedspreads here! hallways painted carpeted calming nuetral tones  beds super comfy  Plus love getting two free bottles water room the ones sink ones entertainment area!! cause desert gotta stay hydrated people! Staff extremely nice very helpful directions recommendations etc   The $15 day fee uncommon many reputable hotels charge  should always ask additional taxes fees when booking hotel room actual price you'll paying  If don't  your bad!  Additional pro's 10 minute walk Miracle Mile Mall @ Planet Hollywood  Mall huge stays open til 11pm  10 min walk Bellagio see fountain show! When u walk strip nearly dead center its far end North strip south strip direction! <EOR> Not sure why many hating place  rooms little dated lobby reeks smoke it's vegas afterall   staff all friendly  Room service very affordable same cheaper inexpensive Saint Louis Kansas City! Most quite tasty well   Of course annoying block further off strip but aren't many chains secured spot strip expected  <EOR> Lame  Forced stay work function  Really really far away anything cool Vegas  Okay well maybe just kick bar before going out  Super lame crowd  All conference goers airline battlehags  Skip place all costs! <EOR> My brother in law sister stayed really nice stay   entire time though   visited once played casino but luck night   The property seems nice enough but location isn't great being far enough Strip away action but far enough away completely away action   Does sense?  guess am saying would rather much further away Strip directly during trips Las Vegas   I called hotel another hotel during same visit bottle champagne sent room   did exactly asked took credit card over phone   impressed that  <EOR> Stayed late July 3 nights   Reserved room double beds when arrived given room king bed for family four!    gave cot free charge said list if room two beds became available   Needless say never called give room originally booked stay room bed   tried calling next day see if anything available but given same run around   night before check called request late check told could since fully booked day   NEVER told late check available any hotel ever stayed even if only hour    Toilet flushing upon arrival but corrected quickly called front desk    There lots construction going looks hotel getting whole new facelift   Location bit walk main strip if plan walking strip prepare some good exercise   Resort fee applies hotel any Las Vegas   Valet free  <EOR> Things hate Las Vegas I hate casinos desperate deluded poor people mixing hopefully rich people far more money sense all chasing same brain chemical thrill     I hate lines any system requires reservations then wait line broken     I hate stale cigarette smoke  Just YUCK  I hate seeing flocks scantily clad barely 18 yo young women desperately prowling bars lobbies search men willing pay them mediocre over acted sex    I hate cab lines  See lines I hate paying much money mediocre food    I hate casino buffets  nothing literally NOTHING love casino buffets  casino buffets hell  I hate viscerally racist cab drivers  aren't all way but Las Vegas WAY many them    I hate valet parking in LV elsewhere fine  See also lines  I hate paying $25 WiFi    Things Las Vegas I Cirque Du Soleil    I desert    I Red Rocks stunningly gorgeous    I people work Las Vegas  some few but notable exceptions most polite hard working sincerely dedicated workers world    I Westin Flamingo  Things hotel no smoking self parking  NO CASINO free WiFi  one decent good even restaurant very good for Vegas prices  Adrian bartender top 5 bartenders ever privilege being served   In conclusion if all wrt your feelings Las Vegas but come Las Vegas some reason stay here  won't regret it   Four stars instead five because there's just no denying it come Las Vegas stay here  <EOR> A peaceful high quality alternative Vegas veterans   If your first trip Vegas if looking proper Vegas experience might want stay elsewhere   simply no substitute big resorts hotels middle strip   should only stay if fully understand hotel small casino but proper Vegas casino resort hotel   The biggest upside hotel offers 'stress free' experience only 10 minutes walk away strip Bally's   There's no attraction night clubs sports bar hotel which means throngs tourists club goers loud sports fans loud bachelor party groups partying here   Even though there's only restaurant property there's never line either   The room Nicely appointed come expect Westin 'standard'   During recent stay May 2012 seems also upgraded TV's large flat screens   deluxe city view approx 200sqft   coffee machine safe lazy chair included amenities  All rooms smoke free even though smoking allowed casino floor adjacent lobby    The location A lot people might put off 'off strip' location   However honestly feel hotel's location good 'on strip'   located 10 minutes walk behind Bally's   Due fact Bally's center strip means Caesars City Center complex under 30 minutes foot   big plus busy holiday weekend since pain those casino's cab due traffic wait line   would argue location hotel better 'on strip' hotels far north south ends strip   Service Nothing left desired     pretty much line what's expected Westin   Check in agent seems authority offer 'freebies'   mentioned we're Vegas celebrate engagement given free bottle champagne cheese platter  There 24hr restaurant starbucks also open 24hr location   players' card comped $ used starbucks  Free beer wine hour during 'social hour'  Price Weekend rates $125 $150 per night   sometimes found Yuupon discounted rates managed rate $100 2012 memorial weekend   In conclusion should part your short list if need hotel rest night strip due convenient location good value money offers but you're looking stay 'Vegas' style suites resorts  <EOR> As far hotels Westin great deal those want right near Strip but want avoid staying right it  located just south middle strip off 2 blocks east easy walking distance  Check hit miss pleasantly efficient sluggishly long common still cleaning call when your room ready speech  place luggage huge deal but just beware  rooms themselves standard  Smell good modern looking clean cozy  Noise level problem most part  Considering price pay compared other hotels great value  casino inside Weston other hand complete joke  usually dead until weekend evening even then nothing special  lowest minimum seen Vegas though if come over  would see better service check in  seems only issue parking structure could use remodel least new elevator  Overall Westin may glamour fame strip other properties but really best bang your buck when budget  Definitely worth especially if last minute weekend getaway  <EOR> Without doubt worst Westin hotel ever stayed at  context spg platinum  given room smelled smoke first try  Moved different room  room smelled musty pretty sure being poisoned mold spores  Moved another room which finally didn't smell! But right next outdoor air conditioning vents heard banging all night  guess tradeoff having room reasonably clean air  <EOR> My sister booked hotel sure sure big popular ones strip  place nice crowded  gamble upset casino floor  cute little bar area floor  Starbucks  consider myself pretty shape person walking strip okay me  rooms nice comfortable clean  place pretty good cost  spend most visit bar hoping strip  nice hotel back wake up  also enjoyed little sandwich stop next door gas station quick bite  mind staying again save buck enjoy strip  <EOR> I booked room Westin last minute Vegas trip  most affordable options via Expedia reading interviews decided take chance  without doubt pleasantly surprised  loved non smoking hotel   thank goodness  review specifically Billie above beyond birthday stay incredible one  She upgraded room sent bottle wine room   unreal service  can't thank enough going way impact  Billie rock truly appreciate very much  room clean bed incredibly comfortable everyone worked helpful kind  being said  just few minutes cab ride strip Westin top choice future returns  <EOR> I family friend connection friend rate room hotel Vegas bachelorette party   thought holding 5 rooms when guests checked could switch hold credit card    little did know   they charged 5 times 155 00 credit card CHARGED HELD   When called customer service guy gave runaround said should actually quoted rate 119 00 night x 5 then said needed speak billing   Called back speak billing   girl rude   She said actually charge first night advance because issue people canceling rooms   said according email received until 2 nights before cancel point maybe should charged but until then   She told nothing she could didn't offer review supervisor   When said i'd cancel reservation no questions why no way repair situation just lost customer life   Horrible customer service no attempt solve problem   Never using hotel again  <EOR> The Westin some good things some bad things it   I usually stay when business travel suspect most guests too   seem lot airline employee guests flight attendants etc well   Good supposed smoke free   mostly see below   fitness center decent  pool hottub open until 3AM   No seems know rarely anyone late day  If SPG floor rooms rooms upgraded normal Westin standard  walk around corner Ellis Island which great BBQ own beer pretty good pizza  Starbucks open 24 hours but hotel Starbucks overpriced  Free happy hour I think sometime around 5   Beer wine chips   Hey free don't complain   Bad casino first floor allows smoking   lobby area hotel smoke free   bad other hotels but definitely completely smoke free hotel  Westins far below standard  There's really nothing around here   know its Strip but example Hard Rock Hotel the other place stay business right across almost dozen restaurants shops etc   I highlight standout front desk staff Dalarie hope spelled right super nice most competent Sheraton employees pleasure dealing with   hope managers read recognize value hotel  <EOR> Enjoyed fantastic Swedish massage Spa! Highly recommend beautiful peaceful modern spa  Top class staff made experience trip highlight! <EOR> Likes rooms decent size nice clean casino small breakfast buffet downstairs just down block Vegas strip  Dislikes don't anything bad say but nothing really wow hotel compared others but still nice CLEAN I'd say 3 5 stars <EOR> This great off strip hotel   The key statement off strip  Its Paris Bellagio but rather tranquil spa like experience happens 1 block away strip   The rooms small but very well appointed  dream beds incredibly comfortable relaxing  color scheme slate grey soft greens blues pure white linens room feels much airier cleaner rest Vegas  feels escape   There no smoking allowed hotel    It near liquor store 7 11 Baptista's Ellis Island casino cheap fast food liquor snacks  pizza place Ellis Island blew away honestly   The staff helpful friendly but no cabs seem come hotel  think because push hotel car service much which am big fan of   It isn't usual quality starwood hotel but comfortable tranquil sea non stop madness! <EOR> Close strip    beds comfy  staff if very nice    bed   see sights  just place put your head down      didn't come Vegas stay hotel whole duration your trip   Smells nice  clean work room awesome  No B S  Hotel!!

Let's say cheap = under $100 night holiday weekend  The hotel quiet clean rarely smells smoke anywhere  employees all very friendly  pool tiny but fully stocked fresh towels   Now let's important stuff room! best Vegas views but room actually walk around vs  just walking around bed place great! give welcome package gum shampoo hair gel hair ties Neat! room comes Starbucks coffee tea well   Although off strip would sure come back second stay! <EOR> Some friends met Happy Hour Craps  wanted learn lose less money slower way   croupiers staff accommodating friendly really helped blast   Everything putting NCAA tournament game asked TVs where could watch having fastest best sign clubs making good strong cocktails especially lessons dice craps bets   bled hundreds dollars swore great time doing it   friends says Westin highlight trip  saying something because she great time LV  several days doing some crazy shit but she's that   nice classy smallish casino floor very comfortable big ass living room   Less neon LV tackiness more well appointed serious gambling hall   Can't offer opinion rooms parking etc yet but plan stay sometime because emphasis service hospitality Westin   Right behind Flamingo definitely short stroll off strip if close Flamingo walking distance   definitely recommend Happy Hour Craps would also come quiet drink watch some games  <EOR> When ended Westin bidding 4 star hotels Priceline really disappointed end only non party non themed 4 star hotel also located off strip   stay found really bad    probably nowhere would stay purpose but bad  The Westin small non smoking hotel small casino Starbucks restaurant small bar   caters primarily business clientele noticed lot elderly people staying there     The first negative point hotel fact charged 15 dollar resort fee despite fact bid Priceline   When asked included he told included pool fitness center maid service bottled water all stuff most hotels include cost    bummer tell until check in   he failed tell awesome FREE happy hour    if hadn't Yelp reviews would've missed biggest perk   Well let tell you   this happy hour awesome   5 30 7 30 everyday all you can drink wine beer soft drinks    and sangria!  frirst day just included chips salsa chili dip   second simple buffet quesadillas pizza fruit veggies chips cheeses lots other odds ends   best part shared tables other hotel guests private reception room hotel choice Delta put employees met group pilots night flight attendants next   it fun new friends start party   even sangria go! Otherwise hotel lot fun  rooms comfortable but special   beds comfortable showerheads massaging but rooms small tub some mildew   staff really friendly all wore cute cowboy hats honor rodeo town   told would switching santa hats soon Christmas   Because hotel small easy find way around able avoid any long lines   may off strip but close doesn't matter   less block Balley's short walk Ceasar's   Keep mind charge daily Internet service no ipod jack radio bring your own speakers  <EOR> My friends loved every bit stay Westin!  just looking slightly off strip quiet clean smoke free   other words isn't your typical loud crazy happenin' Vegas hotel loud lobby gazillion guests   if  you're looking probably best elsewhere   We booked Westin $105 night through Priceline during July 4th Weekend such steal compared other hotels strip     So why did love Westin?  1   No problems Early Check in   quick accommodating   2 hours before check in time rooms already good go     2   Smoke free lobby casino area   large but relatively empty casino area    but since all non smokers really appreciated fresh clean air   3   Starbucks lobby   Gotta cup daily joe before head endless fun!  4   Beds   slept baby plush luxurious pillow soft beds   No complaints   all   5   Shower   water pressure AMAZING!!!  TWO showerheads water blasting heats easily     The only negative think wanted lay pool but realized Westin pool pretty small   anything you'd find Mandalay Bay Bellagio   However some quick research discovered gazillion pools Caesar's Palace open general public FREE charge   Good thing Caesar's close Westin   The Westin only 10 minute walk strip which isn't bad all   see Caesar's Palace hotel room Westin located cross street between Flamingo Caesar's Paris Hotel    actually pretty prime location!    I'd more happy stay again  <EOR> We ended getting decent deal through Priceline Negotiator it holiday weekend but place definitely 4 star hotel  Yes close strip but area around underdeveloped shady   The lobby hotel relatively nice appreciated quiet smoke free  However front desk staff friendliest check in process quickest   The rooms very dated views nonexistent  carpets other Yelpers stated quite dirty sure don't forget your flip flops  bathrooms clean but tub floor could cleaner    TV relic but gets job done  plus side beds comfy   We hated provide free wifi addition phones could connect internet own data plans while hotel either  Very annoying  Also annoying fact express check out does work still front desk   For paid would stay again  <EOR> I would say am fan   why * Very friendly service   Everyone really nice   person checked bartender serving drinks casino really nice person Melissa? behind bar Saturday pool   Service perfect   * really nice walk into hotel traverse obstacle course casino elevators room   * $5 Crap table haven't seen years   * great location across street Bally's   * Extremely fair low prices rooms   * decent size room appropriate amenities   However would consider only being A Okay because * room faced street could hear sirens Police Fire Ambulance whatever all night Saturday night  Maybe request room facing street? * did bling big time strip hotel and none hassles    * Pool area small but just fine wanted nice So overall would say yes am fan   would certainly consider staying next time Vegas calls  <EOR> Not sure exactly ended hotel   I used website where type amount willing pay request location such strip once pulls something committed must book pay  gave Westin which more money typed even strip! know some Westins nice looked big beautiful pictures thought wouldn't bad  But once totally disappointed! rooms really small ugly pool also really small ugly  also really mean black jack dealer embarrassed front whole table constantly teased through whole game  What's funny he never checked ID before walked away told under 21 just scare him  course fun because still Vegas! But don't take chance hotel over priced experiance find just good deal fancier hotels strip! definitely does live Vegas standards boring small  don't know those pictures look good but maybe should hire photographer something! <EOR> Suede restaurant Westin great   very nice staff service expected when visiting spot   found most dishes offered menu quite yummy   suggest Ahi Tuna Burger served grilled tofu which must say quite tasty   If tuna your cup tea also suggest Thai lettuce wrap which very similar P F Changs chicken lettuce wraps very yummy!!!  Pasta dishes also great   Desserts place also very good   suggest coconut ice cream rustic apple tart   only dessert menu did care crepes nutella   Great bite if nearby staying Westin Casuarina  <EOR> We stayed part trip because free easy access conference Flamingo and much nicer Flamingo    While off strip close faster walk strip through other massive hotels onto strip   room very nice very Westin ish nice decor heavenly bed remodeled bathroom   even rubber duck take home dog     The hotel quiet which nice change hustle bustle strip   Honestly except fact guy checking no idea he doing no real complaints   did problems elevators   apparently or process being upgraded     The casino happening but take walk hop quick cab middle everything   Note did check restaurant spa pool   However Starbucks Lobby which saved life early morning conference  <EOR> My room windows infested bugs pool side view  AC night gave major allergies might very dirty  Other then all good over priced is  breakfast Ricks cafe sucks but dinner good  Beautiful hotel might stay again sure  <EOR> I stayed Westins but first time staying Las Vegas weekend   WOW love location   block off strip   Good walking distance other hotels strip   Service excellent    from check in check out   from requesting additional items room   excellent   Accommodating friendly staffs   The rooms spacious clean nice design   bed comfortable  at least didn't hard time sleeping toss 'n turn!

Going back Planet Hollywood Sheraton they've now completed renovations  <EOR> GOOD comfortable bedding clean shower heads! BAD off strip elevators slow  <EOR> Having traveled lot work love Westin    but Vegas wasn't best choice    Pros if Westin    pretty consistent service great  bed comfortable per usual having wifi included resort fee great   Cons its half mile walk strip currently construction along path annoying  Since major resorts Paris Caesars etc  food options limited probably don't want spend much time gambling hotel    Given all during time stayed also priced comparable saying Strip at Paris sure why would deal inconvenience if weren't doing SPG Westin brand  <EOR> This 4th year row returning property  heard renovations thinking stay would even better  Sadly WORSE prior years!  Our renovated room wasn't great condition  Cracked missing grout shower lumps carpet  attention detail wasn't there   One day housekeeping cleaned room took towels didn't give any new ones  Kind problem when hop shower your race    didn't appreciate having call downstairs midnight ask this   The toilet made funny sound each time flushed kinda sounded doorbell    Wifi wasn't great room end hall    dropped frequently   I given free breakfast amenity platinum member SPG     which consisted buffet hotel restaurant  literally exact same food all three days    no variation  Sometimes eggs overdone   In previous years Westin Experience manager contacted advance stay as part being platinum member     year   If anything renovation seemed decrease experience here  Disappointed  <EOR> I booked online thru third party rate really reasonable    the concierge nice Miles    He good suggestions pleasant   Karina checked in   She pleasant she helped much she could   manager Eeaster nice too   She checked early which appreciated because tired   lady counter check into players club   not nice she kept spelling Mom's name wrong card      My room    nicely kept   clean   I am fan AC unit though   I old school ones   new ones hard moderate   slept comfy room   ate cheesecake downstairs   it okay but manager Jeff restaurant pleasant     Things didn't like The resort fee    the hotel isn't even located strip    but offer alot few extra bucks day    water internet pool spa    all things already hotel pay extra use them    I thought lightweight foul but okay      The girl check decided just charge card w o even checking me   that pissed off because wanted pay cash     The machines paid okay    my total experience okay      The plus side hotel close strip   easy walking distance but could use shuttle service   that would nice   but would no doubt charge too     <EOR> A lot people criticize hotel because modern updated many new newer hotels strip judgment justified  But does mean hotel good place stay  if don't running water heat  does show its age times but overall perfectly fine place stay  concern pets proved unfounded    The rooms spacious bed quite comfortable  room clean service perfectly fine  location cannot opinion just minutes strip without all noise congestion  offer free parking internet speed pretty fast  enough electrical outlets charge phones tablets  general four day stay perfectly fine don't any complaints  room facing mountains very quiet room except neighbors absolutely obnoxious child  brings tiny baby Vegas New Year's anyway? Plus because strip prices more reasonable  definitely would consider staying again  <EOR> Yelpers right probably Westin lowered its standards location  hotel pit stop flight attendants everyone else flying business    Saw more then plenty them coming out  hotel bad but great  across Ballys off corner surrounded scary ghettoness  boyfriend almost mugged first night when he liquor store right next place  avoided area  Tried calling taxi wouldn't wait told some available when down search taxi nothing apparently think limo taxi wouldn't refuse it  wrong  wait 20minutes taxi fit 5 w o splitting us  most stay just walked across street Ballys catch cab since more then plenty catch FREE shuttle Rio back!  The beds Westin comfy according bf more Trump which thought comfy couldn't tell difference but both comfy  hotel still TVs early 90's those big bulky box looking ones but anty having basic cable  rooms small bathrooms  dual shower head which did impress much  did slots tables gambling but did play  did check pool pretty small low key but cute  place all other fellow yelpers said party seeker more low key  would say enjoy amenities pool gym coffee room etc b c new trend hotels charge service fee each night stay  Starbucks inside nice coffee drinkers      Would stay again?

All around great price level would back   definitely recommend people looking something along lines! <EOR> I know noone Vegas stay Westin but really missing if overlook hotel  everything could want if want strip but strip  tranquility Vegas much possible still within walking distance several locations clubs  took taxi MGM 12 dollars  <EOR> I never thought staying but snagged last minute room 70 change two days over Christmas  Since checked around midnight slightly less par room end floor   But price last minute buy fast hotel 100 percent booked room solid   GOOD Westin five minute walk Strip all rooms non smoking casino small but nice staff very helpful 24 hour food on property restaurant pretty good well priced   BAD Small stuff  stain bed cover queen size bed king size bed enclosure some parts property look unconverted Westin standards whatever hotel before    For right price would recommend staying if want near Strip action but little way  <EOR> First impressions last forever    Disclosure staying because hotel usually stay available close conference venue    The hotel definitely needs updating  room spacious though decor could use huge facelift  room seems dingy although obviously unclean  If you're going white linens should ALWAYS WHITE  off white  When stains won't come time replace them  HVAC could probably use some repair  room feels someone just took shower every time walk through door    Mostly pretty standard far hotels rooms go  There's no wow whatsoever  Even lobby underwhelming off the strip hotel  Vegas  Everything should pop!  They 24 hr Starbucks spa which nice  Hopefully check them later    The worst part probably loiterers front hotel parking lot  familiar East strip Flamingo taken aback anything  Although city worker peeing bus stop new  just bad business people basically living sidewalk near your parking lot 24 7  guest woman don't feel safe  Regardless whether anyone would actually harm  impression something seedy could happen outside WESTIN possibly being flashed perv   acceptable    The staff seems nice enough  did place call concierge last night places hold several minutes which hung up  But  most terms interaction them    Overall good earnest facelift could something  Right now wouldn't stay again when town nor would recommend anyone    I give two stars  close strip rooms aren't horrible  update review again when trip over keep honest  Maybe more good reports  <EOR> This corporate conventioneer's hotel   hotel obviously uber fancy Westin fare Mariott convert some sorts   window hotel could watch shady goings little apartment complex next door   people milling all hours night   guess air conditioner window units apartments no match 114 degree Vegas heat they'd rather outside socializing   The pool tiny hot tub free germs hopefully since nearly full strength chlorine water!  Luckily hotel just short walk Atomic Testing Museum   Honestly highlight trip!  Vegas huge compact version Orlando would become if gambling legalized within city limits   I say heavenly bed indeed heavenly   think provided 10 pillows some crazy number that   One word caution if even remotely sensitive skin repeat use hand lotion provide rooms   loved sage aroma other toiletries but contact dermatitis caused lotion more counting on   I can't say I'd recommend hotel price but said business trip getting reimbursed when all said done   picked hotel no smoking rooms fact Starbucks lobby  <EOR> I stayed hotel during first weekend March  heard new management team took over earlier year its gearing towards positive direction  summaries stay  Pros 1  Turns down back  Its good clean room when back your room night  2  Flat Screen TV finally here  But HD channels still missing 3  Attractive Weekend rate ability earn starwood points enjoy elite benefits  4  Ease walk room parking lot when comparing mega hotels   Cons 1  Internet did work during stay  tried contact tech support but still did work  Both friends' PC Mac able connect wifi its computer's problem sure  2  cut back social hour it used 2 hours but now 1 hour   biggest pet peeve just reduced terms food offering  used room inside Suade restaurant which quite relaxing able enjoy drinks snacks but now its just big bowl salsa chips located between hallway spa pool  3  Inside spa used offer bottled water juices but its all gone  4  wish spend some time ask engineers clean lents inside bathroom also pipes drainage  Good maintenance keep room lasts longer since no known room renovation plan announced yet  surprised see long took waters drain down pipe  Its embarrassing   I hope hotel seriously improve offering along other issues more likely return property choice hotel whenever visiting Vegas  <EOR> Beautiful hotel! I room amazing view city lights  Great Staff! definately come back next visit vegas  <EOR> EASY PARKING ACCESS!!!  Staff excellent answered all questions had  sure issue smell running through hotel sewer pipes backed something  room clean ready you'll asked if would no room service exchange 5$ voucher take it!!! still ask towels toilet paper if needed   And 24hr Starbucks available big plus!!! <EOR> This go to hotel Las Vegas  easily park find car  No hassles long line check larger casinos  Everyone works very helpful nice  hotel lobby small enough walk quickly elevator long day room  Best all love rooms on smoking don't leave smelling ashtray    Love Starwood points too  Also can't Westin heavenly beds!   An additional perk Starbucks 24 hours day  pick coffee iced tea sit down gamble anytime want    Another plus love restaurant here  typically only eat breakfast very nice buffet  menu items spectacular too  <EOR> This place undervalued gem hotel following reasons Check in breeze     There's handful desk people but only handful customers   clientele varied too just your run of the mill tourist   Sitting bar noticed huge contingent customer base comprised airline pilots flight attendants   Those people check during off peak hours meaning less lines tourist      Another group people come through merchants salespeople business people   happened see Shark Tank winner check in!  Cool huh?!  In contrast If you've ever stayed behemoth MGM Grand before going through airport security again  It's quiet   Yes might want near all party action Wynn Cosmo but don't eventually want bed?  Don't want see half naked drunk people stumbling through your hotel lobby? The casino afterthought    In case feel those other hotels' casinos complicated maze like labyrinths Westin's casino tiny strip real estate hotel   surprised people even gamble   Don't want gamble somewhere cooler Westin?  Maybe not   Hard say since gambler  The location ideal   It's just off strip but very easily walk there   Orleans Hotel where pay shuttle onto strip   middle all chaos away madness when want to  The rooms spacious clean updated   The rooms look magazine quality pictures  Reasonably priced   It's appropriately priced doesn't gimmicky Las Vegas image maintain   visit those hotels instead  In short Westin place if Vegas place want see  <EOR> Outside Las Vegas would solid 3 4 star hotel   However Las Vegas there's lot competition Westin just doesn't live  only reason stay Starwood Preferred Guest even tenuous benefit   The rooms pretty small Las Vegas  approximately 1970s hotel standard globally  while well furnished pretty boring   CRT TV I haven't seen years! limited additional facilities   plus wired wireless internet although non platinums price pretty extortionate usual   One major negative platinums only 4 suites property no upgrades   A big plus smoke free I believe still unlike rest Las Vegas   Still I'd stay somewhere else Venetian Wynn etc  if wanted Vegasy experience Four Seasons Mandarin Oriental if wanted non Vegas experience  <EOR> This first time Las Vegas first time fancy hotel  Roadtripping usually means roadside hotels motels but decided splurge  happy did   First linens  Wow  only ever gotten own bedding clearance bin those cheap department stores because possible difference could thread count make? All difference world turns out  Slept rock felt refreshed next morning   I appreciated provide ashtrays near entrances  know impolitic smoker but customer service isn't politics   Also off strip but within walking distance  played saw show didn't need cab back once safely ensconced room could hear see pandemonium block away   I buffet breakfast way out  good but little spendy   Overall favorite hotel chain  pleasure staying Westin Memphis well good Las Vegas  <EOR> We excellent stay Westin  stayed three nights June over weekend  room upgraded SPG members lovely view High Roller Ferris wheel  room clean larger compared average hotel room  checked couple hours early no problem but did notice quite line actual check time later afternoon    The gym pool spa all lovely clean  pool outside which fantastic  whisky tasting desserts offered daily which nice touch ? may just SPG members   NOTE free happy hour pool area other reviews previously mentioned  lovely water reception area changed every day oranges lemon cucumber  Please drink desert! Another thing really liked eco program where could opt daily fresh linens towels save energy return SPG points money back selected restaurants    Overall clean less busy quiet hotel off strip  prepared short walk 10 15min strip no problem all  If want right action then stay strip  yes resort fees don't surprised when selecting stay here  common Vegas but certainly find hotel without  <EOR> Time updated review someone doesn't unrealistic expectations! This GREAT location Vegas far enough away hot messes directly strip accompanying noise but close enough easily walk it  feels close business hotel Vegas experienced but still Vegas  place wasn't overrun screaming children strollers people who'd many cocktails  felt perfect balance some slots card games tables food Starbucks all inside ground floor hotel great pool plenty places lay enjoy hot Vegas sun very sharp clean comfy rooms wonderful beds LOTS see nearby   Not sure else people want but favorites Vegas back no questions asked  Hope reviews reflect people's honest experiences more review update outdated and whiny ones! <EOR> I love any Westin hotels beds heavenly rooms well equipped  never any complaints when staying Westin    One great things hotel 6pm 7pm pool side happy hour even though free sure tip bartenders <EOR> I booked hotel off Hotwire early little disappointed Hotwire stated hotel located center strip nope weeks prices down! Oh well nothing could it  Also if you're all into party scene plan being loud don't eeeeet  more place business family mostly business   day arrival check very short wait time very attentive staff  attempted early check but room wasn't ready  offered free extended check time would send text message once room ready  inquired awesome happy hour heard free drinks snacks?! nope  good true did hand complimentary cocktail voucher stay we two people room but counting? valid between hours 5 7pm  informed Strip pretty close strip hotel does provide shuttle  Yeah Strip walking distance but opted drive anyways  valet staff very professional prompt  bummed no microwave but later found could  rent two hours security deposit  also complimentary fridge room free charge use  Awesome  But ended even using working temperature set very low setting  No option change that   cleaning crew also slipped $5 voucher use stay since opted cleaning service  attempted redeem Starbucks  located inside hotel told wasn't valid use directed use gift shop  When arrived gift shop told also did accept voucher  Okay  don't know vendor participating gave up  left card top slot machines next lucky person  Keep mind casino also very small limited least  won't wait play  keeping eye card case receive any extra charges! <EOR> The rooms cheaper strip casino small but gets job done if want gamble cheap anything else know much other hanging there   place great if wanna near strip gotta do   personally hate strip hotels because THEM why would spend money it   try use more services products review much better   only vouch casino   casino overall needs slightly friendlier competent dealers along some better comps xD  Otherwise screw trying something back  <EOR> Extremely dissatisfied!  Long story short staff seems nice but real incompetent  don't recommend Westin Las Vegas! <EOR> Pluses great location close Strip but pay off strip prices 5 10 minute walk Ballys Paris Westin Heavenly Bed Heavenly Shower nice if u want rest away city's hustle bustle plenty free parking  Minuses Small pool small spa it's nice but doesn't all amenities you'd find big spa surprised didn't iHomes room  Also disappointed some customer service  wanted leave bags bellhop because room wasn't ready yet  He wasn't but concierge all 4 people check desk weren't doing anything  know saw waiting! long before someone even acknowledged literally seconds putting bags back car! Even if your job should least say he'll right back  let find   even better help yourself! hard put ticket bag! uncalled for    Disappointing <EOR> The location Westin very convenient booked recent trip Vegas some R R  Priceline made selection price reasonable  really 4 star hotel?!   As actual hotel check in prompt staff friendly  room nice but cleaning staff left some hairs behind bathroom  walls must made paper neighbors right must Spring Break did understand concept quiet call front desk quiet fools down twice same night  neighbors left twisted sense humor mocked having sex maybe actually did perform deed but commotion only lasted 2 minutes  Premature ejac   ? Sad anyway! experience exhausting only saving grace mattress Starbucks adjacent sad smallish casino  Steer clear unless Westin decides reinforce walls! <EOR> My only complaint pillows   Way soft   5 days probably most ten hours sleep   need better pillows  Other staff very friendly  <EOR> After staying Westin Las Vegas last weekend would rethink hotel book at  put disturb sign door maids still knock door many times  understand why hard look down door knob realize there's someone here  morning's decide use iron iron board come find ironing board wrinkled  never any things happen other hotels  Next time Bellagio! <EOR> This nice enough Westin  nothing really special but well maintained staff helpful courteous  few points note decent job making compact fluorescent room lamps blend nicely decor  the rooms don't seem harshly lit most  many Westins bathrooms guest rooms very attractive  They're well designed appointed stocked  may only hotel visited Vegas actually puts coffee pot your room  no forced run lobby Starbucks which course has coffee morning  also computer lobby use  at no cost  for printing boarding passes etc     Now bad hotel likely gets lot business travelers there's outlet room  easily accessible without crawling floor  Nowadays people need place charge mobile devices  desk lamp outlet SOMEWHERE   ? Also tack additional services fee your bill each night your stay top fee itself taxed  sign lobby explains amenities [you'd expect hotel this] including pool spa etc  call bulls***  cost doing business should included room price hidden surprise line item  tacked onto your bill  Reminded phone bill all fees carriers don't want include price   And finally major drawback hotel its location  far Strip but requires some walking  If use monorail around Vegas and if don't WHY don't you? signage announcements indicate Flamingo stop closest Westin  lie  not  Flamingo station may physically located closest hotel but must walk all way through Flamingo casino Strip out  all opposite direction hotel  Lesson Bally's stop really closest  off Bally's walk through shopping arcade exit sports book  Westin across street just short walk down street  <EOR> This review casino experience    I place   low key   smoke free casino area but take over other ones because sinuses lungs hate right now place little kinder me   My liver still likes just feels elite event   light weight good drink two   I'm into gambling but when father law tendency play   folks say only smoke social occasions   joined player's club membership special slot play table play first time members     I played black Jack first time dealt two aces   Hmmm  split just hit   split won first hand  Sweet    It's clean casino   Starbucks located hotel good know cup Joe available me   It's small casino but slot machines pretty new ones bigger casinos   Cocktail service slow making rounds but once you've established your booty seats ladies end coming around   What caught attention big dogs owners roaming hotel owners  YES! They're pet friendly!  only pet friendly allow bigger dogs comparison other hotels weight limit  wifely noted may staying near future  <EOR> So frustrated Check in   first Starwood number system which means room high priority list morning 9 30am   so told wait till 4pm   thanks!  typically stay Vegas Hotels anywhere Strip given room any time day   Total Fail Westin!!!

At 4pm room still ready  finally talked guy VIP desk  He told ridiculous room wasn't ready waiting all time  He worked computer able find another room   Finally someone Westin cared    There other problems too  dry cleaning never delivered room even though paid $2 delivery  search 7pm no where found  figured bellboy would find but when returned room later still there  called down little upset   dry cleaning arrived 1 45am   thanks   I don't need sleep    One day maid threw away newspapers neatly stacked desk moved all toiletries   gross uncalled for   She put razor toothpaste toothbrush  Please don't touch bathroom stuff   Every few years run into maid does just hate it    Upon check out two door guys total jerks   needed taxi airport told no taxis available  did 30 dollar town car could take airport  Wow!!! first trip Vegas  told guy if he wasn't going help just going take Monorail MGM taxi there  All sudden changed tune cab 10 seconds   Then second guy started making small talk because he knew limo scam did work  just made more upset!  This hotel did some good moments but sad few bad moments ruin everything    The Heavenly Bed amazing Workout room great!!!  Daniel Happy Hour hardest working guys ever  Westin should proud incredible employee he deserves 5 stars !

Lobby nice but smallish because most taken away casino inside which known Max Casino see below    restaurant didn't really eat but supposed decent fairly priced but only choice although there's more food poolside   Bar basically standard square bar TVs adjacent casino   sometimes free breakfast 2 restaurant thrown if book through Yelp know otherwise reserve deal website   There's also Starbucks inside hotel but don't full selection food items prices marked extra 50% other Starbucks inside Vegas hotels Planet Hollywood example    This hotel really kids basically cater adults couldn't really see any reason stay if kids   but wait  pretty much Vegas especially strip   Pluses Free business center printing event concert tickets send quick emails etc  No smoking hotel itself!

The rooms small even double deluxe small! Walls extremely thin could hear neighbors arguing dog barking music playing its very annoying!!! shower tub looks dirty!   The pool smallest pool ever seen Vegas there's absolutely no wow factor pool hotel!! <EOR> I've stayed many more well known hotels Strip when Vegas over the top themes bumping club scenes  But admit Westin actually nicest experiences looking for!   My girlfriends able good deal room when decided take last minute trip Halloween weekend first concerned way  But actually JUST around corner action which convenient actually really nice bit removed craziness when wanted be    The rooms perfectly clean similar other Westins seen spacious bathroom those wonderful Heavenly beds  took advantage spa where use sauna steam room free guest ate Suede restaurant downstairs which really impressed review come later   also course use late night room service full night partying came super quickly smile    So while Westin may first hotel comes mind when think Vegas very pleasantly surprised helped friends wonderful spontaneous trip! <EOR> Even though hotel located directly Strip only block away   rooms clean dream beds VERY comfortable!  shower two shower heads!

Also note 24 hour Starbucks win! <EOR> I very pleased ambiance service Westin Casuarina Las Vegas    It's little bit off main Strip but  why able save more $$    The rooms clean smoke free    The buffet brunch delicious Krispy Kreme doughnuts part buffet! Good Times!   They fairy small casino  appreciate great gift shop Starbucks lobby  <EOR> Overall weren't very happy    stayed years ago when beds actually heavenly definitely same beds    room service breakfast awful! toast muffins hard rocks cold  People working all nice but overall never come back here  <EOR> I love Westin   but God sucks!  can't even believe people good things say?!  casino really small dirty    rooms partied few many times   furniture worn down old bath tub gross   attitude people desk concierge horrible   Oh   if book third party   Priceline charge extra $15+tax per day enjoy services   parking I thought all casinos free parking gym spa daily newspaper happy hour they free beer wine 5 30 7 30    If take advantage none still charged it   Ridiculous!  I could paid same price Priceline stayed Wynn   Sucks   Btw those pics shown below really MISLEADING  <EOR> This second stay less two months biggest compliment staff fantastic  Special kudos Randy valet Mylin Albert front desk well Spenser helped much last visit  several delicious meals Jake Eli's all served friendly enthusiastic staff  best things Westin offers casino free smoke free environment yet close strip  <EOR> The hotel clean conveniently located 3 minutes walk off Las Vegas Blvd strip   The check experience bad  line disorganized even sure if could call line  No hotel facilitating front desk   Food room service bad  liked crab cake   The room clean but small ish  bed very comfortable  There's no fan bathroom   The pool tiny  workout area small but guess lot people work when Las Vegas  okay LOL   There Starbucks store inside hotel liked that  <EOR> I used place  Basic clean comfy  However last two times right now 5 days ago A C just doesn't works only 70's during day 50 night  Can't sleep  come back week  Let's see if strike three  Luckily hotel boss books hotel  Otherwise doubt I'd come back  Working environmental controls must  Including fan which works enough white noise drown out outside noise  <EOR> Rooms clean slept ROCK bed  bar area fun if you're playing machines drinks house  Nice Starbucks house too   I didn't chance hit pool but area looked fun jacuzzi workout room well    The Strip madhouse IMO  nice stay Hotel Westin  only block off half crowds   all in  <EOR> Wow disagree majority reviews  love Westin!!   Great location just off strip everything walkable doesn't come huge on strip price tag    The casino quiet but crowded    The rooms big beds comfy!! even bring your pet!!  Over all think place really good value  Highly recomended  <EOR> I spent four nights over recent holiday weekend    last visit Vegas involved disappointing stay mile away no in room coffee nothing interesting close hotel other Hard Rock restaurant  Having good Starwood experiences since joining SPG 2004 figured couldn't wrong here    I didn't wrong    The front desk staff always helpful Marcus Suede remembered name very courteous attentive needs room comfortable clean breakfast buffet best buy breakfast loved being able hook HDMI cable in room LCD TV second monitor laptop    They green program SPG members where if forego housekeeping day $5 off food drink 500 SPG points  If you're staying more three days I'd suggest choosing option checkin    choose card your door each night if want your room cleaned middle but every day still benefits I think other cleaning day checkout day  However when needed towels coffee just asked front desk delivered promptly    As other reviewers mentioned a block Strip  If come normal city think 4 blocks corner where Bill's is  You'll find Bumblebee Transformers or reasonable facsimile rest Las Vegas strip  There's liquor grocery store two normal blocks away halfway Strip gas station next door reasonable convenience store case miss 10pm closing gift shop    Main upsides * Courteous staff  Never bad experience personnel   * Breakfast buffet Suede great  cheap might shopped around if hadn't company expense but pretty good start day  * 24 hour coffee availability in room Starbucks lobby   * Nice in room amenities linens towels robe    The only downsides I'd report would be * TV HD but cable channels not  upside HDMI use your laptop portable DVD easily  all things could bad take one   * hotel computer being worked message when trying look folio tv  sure if fixed if because corporate plan but unexpected   * Parking structure bit cramped  Always free space    free available free no parking fees    but could scary if crowded car weekend  * Mini bar bit sparse  Beer wine soda bottled water snack two  But if can't find drink Vegas otherwise need help  Next time head Vegas whether work again pleasure likely stay here  <EOR> Very disappointing unsatisfactory experience weekend booked 2 rooms buddy's bachelor party weekend back March  Only told being moved another hotel because overbooked rooms email phone call notified change long tiring drive because cajon brush fires frustrating load back move another location then following day come back check again only held half hour sorting room details told would reimbursed cab fare Friday night since further away  Never it  told would complimentary bottle troubles tell 4 different staff hours later them send up <EOR> If want noise congestion strip long disorienting walks pretty much everything surcharges routine activities indifferent staff   then Westin you  old Maxim de Paris Hotel block off strip which 1 2 mile    away bright lights   but easily visible any vantage point   The hotel cozy intimate Vegas standards 500 rooms   the rooms cookie cutter comfortable   the views better upper floors   with great beds decent bathrooms   Fair room rate  Complimentary breakfast free bottled water room complimentary access gym pool Platinum members  pool small but gets great sun   PSA   the water pool 50 degrees   no joke   I think saw icebergs forming  If could take more minute your muscles would sieze  hot tub 104 degrees   so quite contrast   The service top drawer   the best Vegas mile   its service stay keep returning  <EOR> No hotel isn't bellagio paris but enjoyed it   experienced exceptional customer service  pool area pretty nice happy hour good  Friday left Sunday  When needed dress steamed event Saturday night  sent someone promptly  Saturday around 3ish called asked when dress would back because needed before 6  said would ASAP  down pool 30 minutes when back dress hanging room    I complaint   Someone set fire alarm off around 4am night loud  no fire took them 20 minutes more turn off    The hotel five minutes off strip  husband don't mind walking good location reasonably priced  <EOR> My husband likes tell people if someone lit cigarette Seattle I'd smell home Watsonville  OK REALLY am bad cigarette smoke originally chose Westin because practically only smoke free hotel Las Vegas could find   This mostly true except bar casino  course casino smack dab center 1st floor lobby can't avoid if you're going Starbucks eat Suede pick souvenirs hotel gift shop catch elevator your room  other words must contend cigarette smoke any time enter lobby   That being said smoke annoyance minimal  notice still gave Westin 4 stars  but maybe because hotel wasn't crowded maybe lot more non smokers staying didn't smell clothes hair all time  *SIGH* until pricier fancier casino hotels barr smoking COMPLETELY and ain't gonna happen any time soon keep spending money Westin   The restaurant Suede excellent except dinner all meals there  think someone else said pricey yes pricey but Wait Staff way above expectations eaten more few those Celebrity Chef restaurants Strip better service Suede  No complaints service food  People front desk friendly helpful too check in check out breeze   Our room clean didn't smell dog Westin pet friendly ewwwwwwww! establishment  heavenly bed shower wonderful well  stayed three nights ONLY complaint couldn't room cooler 72 degrees  called front desk repair person 15 minutes English first language however but when he left he said fixed  Never did room cool down below 70  Guess should consider self lucky since wasn't hot season Vegas yet   Like others already said fact Westin off Strip parking self park free unless use Valet   Overall hotel clean quiet comfortable  also right next door small liquor store easy buy bottle wine snack if wanted without having pay room service prices   Like said if hotel REALLY COMPLETELY SMOKE FREE I'd absolutely no complaints  back Westin if ever Las Vegas again  <EOR> I chose hotel due fact status Starwood literally looked map thought hotel good deal wasn't far off strip  arrived Vegas batchelorette party noticed hotel very much off strip  roughly 10 minute walk strip  Take into consideration when think you're going walk whatever club restaurant bar want then realize heels on  short probably won't walk Westin strip unless you're shopping sightseeing  said homeless people begging some change randos wandering down street tipsy drunk occasional stray dog walk hotel  sketchy  dealt both HOWEVER don't people walking dropping cans soda then yelling top lungs startling really close distance  that'll someone's eyes burning special little seasoning love use foods   The hotel itself little slow check in  Other very friendly  Starbucks premises  open 24 7  may want check out  rooms need some updates  nothing wrong beds but rooms need some modern features brighten bit  Ordered room service food turned perfectly very surprised  rooms dark bathroom should've bit bigger  seems Westin older hotel order attract customers certainly need provide hotel massive facelift  stayed plenty Westin's feel property falls short when comes modern aspects it   When return Vegas stay closer strip love Starwoods but feel property isn't convenient modern some others at  <EOR> Dont bother book hotel never ever book hotel u thankful listen advise   We paid 400 bucks single night first no lobby mean Motel level lobby 4 star hotel lobby never saw 4 star hotel lobby such tiny cheap    We waited 45min checked because Room ready when checked 7pm sat night  long long wait finally into room which tiny old maybe worth 100 bucks  come drama show   ROOM NO AC!!!  Imagine no AC July day Las Vegas Yes AC remote but stayed 81 degree forever no matter set called room service spent another hour half back forth Tech came said nothing he customer service said all room sold nothing she eventally serveral phone calls exchanged anther room    For sure wont come back Westin anymore never ever <EOR> My family including two young children recently stayed when town family function otherwise wouldn't brought kids Vegas! couldn't happier choice stay here! First all price lower any hotels strip just st behind strip very nice  Because busier bigger hotels those strip smokey crowded loud  smaller easy leave your room downstairs gamble Starbucks inside hotel back your room without getting hopelessly lost  recommend hotel anyone but especially those children! Oh beds amazingly comfy!  I'm bit hotel snob love hotel! <EOR> Great hotel! Loved room staff awesome  come back future live strip! Thank you  <EOR> I glanced negative reviews say didn't any experiences     Let caveat saying a am business traveler b *HATE* Vegas   Sure when young cat liked heading Vegas Vegas thing but am young cat anymore   hate lights bells   hate smoke   hate gambling people gamble   hate no trees   could but suffice say hate Vegas   But end having come Vegas business fairly often place stay   Since discovering Westin Casuarina trips now bearable   The casino area tiny good thing minimal noise lights   bar area small relatively tasteful I don't partake but nice walk past tacky smoky bar area room    Coming off elevator colors neutral muted  not Vegas electric   when your room Westin room VERY good thing    Great bed great shower great room   unlike most Vegas hotels room service food actually decent quality    The only thing would mark them down certain times year taxis kinda forget place   isn't really knock against hotel just caveat overall stay experience  <EOR> After three nites Planet Hollywood reviewed 3 stars looking forward move traditional 'quiet' business hotel   you'll find Westin despite casino lobby   In contrast your typical Vegas mega casino resort  you won't charged $20 $30 day fitness club access   unlike Planet Hollywood's 9AM pool opening time Mandalay Bay's 8am pool opens 6AM doesn't close until 2AM!

Friends Family rate discount no longer applies room service Wahhhh! and only available restaurant  service still very friendly Front Desk but operator cold when called in  Due being bad car accident night arriving didn't until 4 morning  When called let them know happened sure didn't give room away operator sounded she could care less  someone worked hotels hospitality years expected least some concern  But whatever   We actually ended cutting trip short wasn't sad leaving hotel  may just stick other usual hotels moving forward  <EOR> My family stayed mother's birthday weekend  arrived 1am Saturday person received very accommodating  fan resort fee pay each night per room but overall price reasonable enough considering proximity strip fact didn't feel overcrowded most places feel weekends  Since strip travel less congested when take uber or taxi suppose   enjoyed pool which plenty seating both sun shade  husband checked gym although smaller side gave pair earphones use while he worked out  also noticed sign New Balance workout clothes shoes rent out  didn't use service but  kind cool  music downstairs solid mix pretty convenient little Starbucks  parents lunch restaurants downstairs content meals price  casino isn't huge but served well all great time  rooms clean beds comfy TV good size  far favorite part room rainfall showerhead    won't want out  We'd come back  <EOR> Spent Halloween weekend here    Never again!

Your signs ask clean towels sheets but why can't keep bar soap opened?!   I moved bar soap into shower hoping wouldn't take it   Didn't realize no soap until shower  step new unopened bar soap vanity  Annoying    The bellman valet conned into taking unauthorized limo service airport even though insisted 3x cab  reluctantly agreed only driver ask tell oops! since he isn't authorized serve taxi  call back hotel resulted conversation bellmen supervisor someone customer service  thought handled call very well   $5 just log Internet print boarding pass? Seriously?   Oh   to reviewer felt duped conned $8 bottle water dresser tag attached bottle clearly states price  Overpriced? Yes  Conned  No  <EOR> I stayed conference  staying Imperial Palace which recommend everyone avoid all costs may giving Westin nicer review would normally   Overall thought hotel great  smoke free except casino area which pretty much impossible find Vegas  standard room stayed fairly large  bathroom beds really nice everything looked clean  bed nicest comforters used hotel fairly comfortable definitely good night's sleep probably because tired weekend    All all great business hotel  did prepaid deal no refund if canceled which gave great rate room  internet pretty ridiculous $14 per day but guess  expected  <EOR> I wish could give 3 5 really do  torn reviewing because there's lot great aspects but item kinda knocks off 2 stars me   I've stayed multiple times LOVE location  close strip but close  also quite close light rail which convenient if you're partial taking vs  cabs    The rooms decent sized comfortable  love Westin Heavenly Bed bedding  Always equals great night sleep me   One feature hotel yes there's casino but endless miles miles slot machines large hotels right strip  smaller square footage limited main lobby  restaurant bar right next there's no reprieve if you're looking beverage but  why enjoy pool   ! We always grab chaise pool whenever we're town  fun hang enjoy cocktail pool side pool parties SLS Wynn Encore  far more sedate scene    bring book  mellow good sunning  Partying? much  NBD though   On trip celebrating special occasion someone super special sent cheese platter room service  Oh fantastic! knocked park  strawberries perfectly ripe sweet  grapes also  cheese selection impressive excellent quality  We're cheese fiends score! I'd definitely recommend ordering it    The downside place bathroom under par  grout kinda funky see photos  did decent job cleaning place overall but failed expectations  Also bathroom ceiling height oddly low  knock off 2 stars shower condition   I also wasn't thrilled reception when checked in  needlessly made wait which annoying  sure all spare deets   I'd come back though  good value location good nights sleep  Just don't expect immaculate bathroom  <EOR> I really appreciate front desk staff especially Karina Albert  Thanks Karina found room safe   super helpful  did mini refrigerator   Since Westin bed home nice bed   bath  tub bit drop climb   Luckily didn't fall  Nicole did polish change makeup which stayed great thru sweaty appointment  doormen also very nice helpful  Can't wait see remodel completion it Las Vegas Nevada hotel D C <EOR> The Westin conveniently located short block east strip nice property  Staff front desk waiters room service top notch super polite helpful   Rooms pretty standard clean bed comfortable   Starbucks lobby although gaming isn't smell smoke everywhere  only downside walls thin bit noisy especially outdoor concert happening LINQ nearby  All all would stay again  <EOR> Had Vegas client meeting booked room Westin  discovered Heavenly Beds years ago when stayed Westin Minneapolis    and dying sleep every since  Now remember why loved them so        one day when run into large lump sum money promise myself purchase lovely bed all trimmings come it      Plus helps Westin just really cool hotel anyway    3 stars Westin      as much despise Las Vegas would come herea again      <EOR> Decent rooms very clean great quality money   The only downside its location   heel friendly you'll definitely taxi if wearing heels   The foodcourt downstairs okay   restaurant serves decent food but prefer eat elsewhere  <EOR> The Westin quality found throughout its other properties shows through here   It's Vegas everything sold glitz   Yes snazzier more glamorous places Vegas   Definitely but Westin rooms actual accommodation Westin delivers very comfortable place lay your head   To Vegas aspect Westin Casino small   Just few tables few dozen slots   It's pretty quiet too   The Casino doesn't look place anyone seeks but apt snagging some guests way other more vibrant ways lose dough   The restaurant does respectable breakfast par other similar properties  <EOR> This bad Westin closer 4 3 stars  Off Strip craziness pretty well updated friendly staff reasonable rates  Good sized rooms decor ok pretty nice outside pool spa fitness center  Breakfast buffet included case SPG Gold adequate  Bathroom room could better  Bathtub needs some paint work  course quite noisy  People could care less if asleep 2 am loud talk laughter  Somehow take saying Vegas never sleeps literally!

If can't your bottle wine open guy works hotel help you  He'll just come right your room which way charming country cottage robe share  But enough hotel  The bar reasonably priced according married pilot bought coworker drinks  all flying high end night  Try quesadilla said Randy name made pilot  <EOR> Stayed twice now basically because few hotels accomodate pets  first time much better second  Most recently even preferred check line ridiculously long wait  Rooms weren't ready time promised difficult situation when pets involved  also stuck lower floor because though turned positive later on    The elevator situation just ridiculous  bank 6 cars 2 operating fully limited service seemed used hotel staff more own back elevators  Two freaking working elevators 14 15 story hotel? Ridiculous   And solution? apology supposed discussion staff involved points  Boy sure made it    <EOR> Date stay July 29th Aug 2nd 2017  Was excited stay Westin Las Vegas because aware comfort past experiences hotel  However Westin LV didn't Westin Hotel feel all  started stay arriving 9pm check told room wasn't ready couldn't tell when would be   Apparently didn't lead overbooked hotel hoping checkout put in  associate non apologetic didn't seem think poor service when room should ready check 4pm  finally room 10pm help high roller friend called spoke manager multiple times    room decent but older building obvious slamming doors woke early every morning     Very odd   about hour into room housekeeper unlocked door walked unannounced surprised room  guess don't update housekeepers soon enough!! Good thing still dressed!   pool beyond small  and website pictures deceiving    making look much larger  If your looking nice pool lounge would say stay clear Westin LV!!   Both steam rooms service     elevator parking garage service all 3 days  So   imagine carrying your luggage 3 flights stairs!   bar seated maybe 5 people  no lounge separate seating drink conversation  Above bat old cashier sign weird      If anyone remembers Maxxum Hotel   it's same building    and remodel Westin insufficient    wish could give hotel better review  really hoping nicer stay  <EOR> Great spot off strip  Staff friendly efficient  <EOR> Okay definitely fancy Vegas hotels more more more over top mentality if  looking then would quickly suggest quickly move along   However if looking book place accommodating small budget but still nice great location then you've found your place    booked room hotwire com blind booking luckily pleasantly surprised   While hotel technically strip very close strip centrally located which ideal cheap cab ride pretty much anywhere would go   rooms nice clean everything would need  really you're Vegas much time actually spending room?  Stay save money would spend luxury resort treat yourself something special  <EOR> Checked time long night las vegas back room door doesn't open contacted desk wont anything because don't want take care accommodations anywhere else but cant room  WTF  place sucks  think denied accommodations paid people establishment say bad  complain too? don't ever stay !!!!!! <EOR> I should break down into two posts but oh well  hotel conference PERFECT  5 stars  conference style breakfast great hotel clean off strip  worked    But don't hurt building  shower floor bathroom almost foot difference  shower expecting difference fell  hit counter sink lucky hand head  When advised hotel staff offered incident report complete 911 call  While hand swollen could wedding ring off declined  incident report included form waiving all liability Westin  ok  Then man helping offered stool  degrading  Then that  No phone call check no apologies happened NOTHING!
