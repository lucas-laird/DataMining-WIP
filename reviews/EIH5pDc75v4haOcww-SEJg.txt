Nicely spiced rich robust flavor served over healthy bed rice   made perfect hot meal rare cold day Las Vegas   only downside wasn't anywhere warm sit eat nearby! <EOR> When first walked glorified food cart Urban Turban worker smoke break best impression! almost walked away but smells coming food itself good couldn't bring myself leave  employee washed hands before serving which good enough me  food isn't being made right then anyway being spooned heating apparatus into your plate    This description sounds two star review four  However despite characteristics Urban Turban very favorable overall opinion place  tiki masala curry plate  expensive compared sit down place off strip but expected that  wasn't ridiculously priced paid $15 dollars bowl mango lassi  delicious!
