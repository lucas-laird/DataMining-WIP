Anyway fast forward when seated she did complete 180 attitude actually smiling acting friendly   probably real believable glue on lashes  Food pretty good came quickly but way treat customers really took away all  <EOR> Best ramen Las Vegas!! very close authentic ramen Very cheap Long line but its worth wait <EOR> I biggest stomach boner just thinking place  More sushi more even n does place want commit suicide via ohm nom nom   Some People b*tch service but servers aren't chit chat entertain which completely fine they're in order your drinks food order refill drinks food delivery accept payment then shuffle f*ck stuff face shoyu extra egg    nori      extra pork chashu     And     and     FAPFAPFAPFAP     <EOR> I use Yelp often but never written review before  However disappointed last visit Monta feel needs some sort review service  many times because food good   not just good but craveable  also good value price never takes long cook    But  problem Monta  problem service lack thereof  visited today April 28th 2017 around 1pm  two cooks two servers all seats filled  Everyone food nothing being cooked  put name list  lady waiting before kept looking around  few minutes she left looking distraught  No greeted us  tried several times catch attention younger waitress but she kept looking away  sat down  Stood up  Tried speaking when she three inches away refilling waters  She ignored me  understand if place busy she might time but she did  cooks cooking thing  Everyone eating  even hello  All wanted order food go  Finally literally stared straight across room said excuse me  She came over reluctance going ask why couldn't seat sooner  When said wanted order to do she immediately took order  less 5 minutes point   Just remember people come food but return service    On last visits witnessed another young waitress scream patron ordered over phone  She confirmed order but he said he ordered something different  He did seem very confused but she basically humiliated front whole restaurant  She changed order but said price would change  understand frustrating someone works both job customer service second job restaurant industry  But no way handle simply fixable mistake   I am simply giving feedback customer experience  place continue successful because delicious food  look elsewhere ramen  stop recommending place friends  Las Vegas countless restaurants why should somewhere where feel unwelcomed hassled? worth very good bowl noodles  <EOR> Drools    Amazing ramen  introduced two friends loved everything tried  <EOR> We stepped comfort zone      very busy hole wall restaurant   Great food great service! <EOR> I dont understand Hype all about  craving ramen cause raining Jinya spot  Everyone keeps talking Monta tried it  Straight point   it's good  Ramen salty charge extra spicy  The fried rice burnt taste it  Maybe would've somewhat ate if taste but No taste  Menu sucks service sucks  said goodbye while still eating dropped check   I also ordered oolonghot tea  Came hot ass  waiting lawsuit top didn't give hot tea cup  gave regular plastic cup   Atmosphere also sucks  After eating still craving ramen   Never coming back again  Just Jinya Ramen avoid disappointment  <EOR> You must sign wait list door good thing another customer told I'd NEVER guessed that! food amazing although yes salty some stated especially toward end bowl  added mustard leaf  very salty worse  almost ordered extra noodles $1 50 compensate but full just couldn't  menu very simple service quick  I'd gladly come again    but many great places try even very plaza doubt chance  <EOR> Place excellent  Great food decent beverage selection  Only problem restaurant itself kinda small  Other great spot  Wouldn't recommend large groups though  <EOR> Always delicious  Usually wait but worth it  Ramen small order Pork belly rice always delicious     always take visitors always love ramen  <EOR> Delicious!!

The last dish which kimchee fried rice $6 95 yum though still think could done slightly less oil   Unlike rice bowl sized portion often comes fried rice came rounded square plate size could've meal itself   SERVICE Service friendly efficient brisk without making feel rushed  But did devoured meal super fast left quickly courtesy long lines people waiting   Two thumbs place   ANECDOTAL COMMENTS OBSERVATIONS mostly rhetorical Why most ramen house most 'house rules' posted outside window?

Finding parking kinda annoying since parking lot shopping center small  actually surprised able seated right away party 5  When left line going outside door I'd come early expect wait because place super tiny inside there's few tables then bar style seating     Looking over menu shocked cheap ramen was  But then realized ramen very basic  broth 2 slices pork green onions ramen bamboo shoots  If want extras egg extra pork corn kimchi etc  you'll pay extra  But even adding toppings food still came $10    We started off sharing pork belly bowl table  pretty good! meal ordered Miso ramen asked spicy paste side  also opted add egg corn   adding spicy paste Miso ramen tasted great full flavor! miso ramen also thick wavy noodles love    Service quick efficient  kind vibe wanted leave quickly paying bill but can't really blame them line door!

Found noodles thinner prefer but cooked perfect al dente  Shredded nori into small pieces distribute throughout bites  broth lacked depth elsewhere but pleasantly surprised use brown garlic oil table robust improvement flavor  Potential new favorite condiment alert! Sad note chashu somehow lost among kicked broth sea shredded onion  usually highlight ramen experience just mediocre cut fatty nor particularly flavorful either   I likely back because service great other varieties try menu but slightly underwhelmed bowl today  Location everything though noodle house conveniently located likely result repeat visits  <EOR> I took friend Gerald when he said he itching ramen  first going take Togishi Ramen come didn't know place closed!?!? sad! but once discovered closed tried place recommendation friend  second attempt place because first time packed  There's little bench front restaurant least four people sitting three more people waiting    When seated immediately  place very small tight but definitely Japanese feel it  ordered Shoyu ramen cha shu pork green onions  Gerald same thing but instead green onions he added soft boiled egg saw wanted egg too!!! service quick pleasant honestly expected  disappointed   As ramen   it delicious!!! perfect temperature just enough flavor hit spot!! only two disappointments 1 limited menu enjoyed but think would liked see more choices   2 Feeling rushed staff but people waiting  just stood table felt rushing because party seated right next me  restaurant's fault but perhaps should come seating system take reservations large parties peak periods    I definitely try place again! give ramen 4 stars but until try something else menu stick 3  Yummy ramen if you're craving it! <EOR> Some best ramen ever had  Although seating very limited worth wait  <EOR> Finally Monta hearing long dying go  good!

The gyoza pot stickers ordered not photo gyoza   Nothing special   Frankly better gyoza better 30+ years professional cooking non professional experience    However specialy ramen  Tonkotsu Shoyu difficult balance first place   taste pork broth shiitake mushrooms hint something    Japanese   May Chinese perhaps hihachi pepper Okinawa?  Great job Monta!  Their other ramen miso base shoyu base always good  Ramen soups always fascinating because many things it   no fixed  Orthodox style whatsoever   taste good your first sip soup hence very challenging   Furthermore always loved way workers  energetic small busy place should be  <EOR> I absolutely love place but nowadays way well go  being chinatown lines long place fills FAST!

Overall favs Vegas   giving four stars comparison other Ramen places not necessarily Vegas      Tips *  good place come group friends   Very casual atmosphere *  eco friendly save yourself hassle trying carpool if possible  <EOR> Went few days ago during weekday BEST chasu pork ever tasted! literally melts your mouth  They're thin slices recommend ordering extra your ramen   The wait bit long prepare that  group 5 2pm still wait almost hour seated  definitely small cozy place great food hence wait  <EOR> My first experience Monta wasn't very good despite all gleaming reviews read  tonkatsu ramen tasted slightly gamy way salty  gave them another shot lot better  Gone gamy flavor broth  good but amazing opinion  kind broth want drink up  chashu pork slightly smoky flavor OK  nice wait staff cheap ramen help see attraction place  However compared other ramen places don't believe Monta's ramen stands presentation flavor  <EOR> I love ramen looking place try Las Vegas  catching late show having dinner prior show wanted something would heavy filling  searched Yelp tried Monta based positive Yelp reviews  tonkatsu broth very robust flavorful yet heavy  served thin noodles some greens added corn which provided something sweet compliment saltiness broth  definite member repeat list when back Las Vegas  <EOR> Mmmmm   Monta    The wait always damn long but worth it    It turns Monta Marugame Monzo run same group which does surprise bit   Both exceptionally delicious Japanese noodles  <EOR> Hands down best most enjoyable Ramen Japanese noodle house!

Best Ramen life! black garlic  Great staff fast service <EOR> I would give place 5 stars if some decent air conditioning  ramen amazing but place small line door source A C  Don't come afternoon especially large party <EOR> Not big fan noodles but broth okay plentiful amount chasu bamboo shoots  mini Chasu bowl amazing though <EOR> Yay yay yay kimchi! places kimchi alone keeps coming back only dollar!   I tried all ramen choices think all delicious  favorite tonkatsu ramen thick wavy noodles instead thin noodles  All very hearty comforting perfect nights need good fill  All add add ons very cheap well    I also tried gyoza kimchi fried rice  Both very good although would prefer if chopped onions tad bit smaller but complaining much it    Although location very small very busy really know turn over tables fast love it! <EOR> Been coming years     but man wait now  Therefore encouraging counter Ramenism   They use pork Ramen     They rush even serve cold noodles     They remove your shoes door barefoot     They serve imported Japanese beer Canada     They add much flavor your tastebuds shut down     They add noodles soup fill bowl     They put your name list     then wait! They sit table people don't know     They refuse park your car     And favorite Tonkotsu broth thick creamy can't even drink      10 reasons hope see your     <EOR> What treat knew going good but no idea would doing happy dance every bite!

Maybe bathed butter prior adding your Ramen  lol   4 stars = egg add in   eggs bomb dot com!  Great addition any ramen menu!  5 stars = portions huge!  I also tried regular fried rice wasn't impressed   But Ramen yum! <EOR> Good size ramen bowl! Reasonably priced well flavored  Ramen well textured broth well balanced  oily but creamy  Recommend! <EOR> I'm glad gf found place yelp final lunch Vegas!  We ordered Tonkatsu Ramen Absolutely wonderful smooth milky pork based broth  favorite ramen shin sen gumi bowl ramen very comparable if better  also added toppings hard boiled egg extra slices pork gave 6 extra slices addition two slices pork came bowl default  decided avoid kimchi because didn't want Korean toppings dominate Japanese broth  Noodles cooked perfect order extra noodles $1 50  Shoyu Ramen darker believe miso soy based  gf tried broth seemed equally delicious  Gyoza lightly grilled potstickers Fried Rice typical fried rice expected something die but good  Kimchi Fried Rice Pretty much exactly fried rice except bit tangy flavor kimchi added Pork bellow bowl favorite fried rice bowls  Lightly cooked tender moist juicy pork belly strips layered top white rice  Definitely worth getting along ramen   Service fantastic  group 5 sixth waitlist but moved pretty fast waited maybe 20 minutes   Cliff Notes Tonkatsu Ramen hardboiled egg extra pork  Pork Belly bowl  <EOR> This probably best ramen ONLY Las Vegas area but very small margin every other ramen place town   some yesterday because felt it   don't know but food Las Vegas sucks most time place heading toward way   Honestly really want stop tipping people because don't deserve Why should pay salary when only minimum amount service each table?  Anyways hate sitting under AC wall unit because making ramen cold fast charge two dollars your damn broth ruined crappy AC   can't wait till day when don't tip restaurant  <EOR> Very good ramen   canned green tea   There's still no hot green tea but latest visit able come sit   Last time more people waiting outside actually sitting inside eating   miso ramen good   extra meat mine since last time two pieces melted mouth quickly   ordered extra ramen pour bowl   broth miso ramen isn't drinkable downable others but love flavors compared shoyu ramen     Even though menu limited ramen very good  <EOR> We found place yelp since restaurant better reviews others  But both didn't it  ordered 2 different kinds Ramen both salty soup hot enough  always wait but worth it  would recommend place  <EOR> Very impressed certainly back   many Asian restaurants area if aren't local know someone could easily overlook place   While small seats more you'd expect also L shaped counter additional seating when come in   Always good sign when greeted warmly there's sign sheet waiting kids folks regulars since waitresses knew some them name    We tonkatsu ramen shoyu ramen corn shredded green onions   noodles perfect chewy broth top notch   also fried rice pork belly bowl   Don't miss these!  food does come fast kitchen   Compared bay area prices pretty reasonable plenty eat   Service excellent   If don't wait true vegetarian probably place you   5 30pm Sunday place just 1 2 full   6 00pm packed more dozen people waiting   guessing if there's line somewhere usually good bet place worth wait   located strip mall parking but also many restaurants well   also called taxi when done which awesome   back sure  <EOR> Monta Ramen delicious! tried Monta Ramen SF Ramen Fest when came Vegas last weekend just another bowl!

Fellow yelper Vicky L  recommended made first stop Vegas right picking rental car   We arrived around 11 45 extremely lucky seats counter because place filled quickly noon lunch crowd   I tonkotsu shoyu husband tonkotsu  broth both extremely creamy delicious  If things bit more flavor suggest tonkotsu shoyu  ramen noodles thin angel hair type which nice change usual ones SF    The egg  how could forget order soft boiled egg? actually still bitter that  please and yourself favor add soft boiled egg your ramen    We also smelled fried rice aroma neighbor couldn't help but small order share ourselves  perfect portion hit spot  <EOR> Not tasty  Minimal amount noodles bit hard  soup isn't savory  servers nice courteous  Very small restaurant noisy  <EOR> Best ramen city  Period    We also ordered pork belly bowl which simple but delicious  only complaint egg ramen cold which sort weird yolk bit overdone despite this  Nonetheless can't wait back! <EOR> This favorite ramen places!  service friendly food very good inexpensive  lot people complain broth sometimes salty which agree with   If think send back them add some hot water your dish   definitely recommend place all friends  downside very small location seating limited   If you're heading dinner Fri Sun definitely expect seating delays  <EOR> I love place  Small spot but worth wait seat bowl yummy ramen  favorite ramen spot Vegas hands down  <EOR> Ordered go  Absolutely horrible   never ramen bad  noodles cooked! Never going back  called shop same day am still waiting Owner call back  Total rip off money  <EOR> Not sure but pretty upset stomach eating place dinner  meat really good but everything else wasn't  Perhaps just big fan ramen  definitely much better ramen compared this  <EOR> Get ready wait while table we waited almost hour two people   place packed tiny  However food fantastic  Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen ramen broth incredibly rich thick tasty  creamy which isn't texture normally associate ramen broth  noodles delicious toppings point  friend Kuro Ramen Black Garlic Oil which even better mine  well worth wait! <EOR> Never Japan eat ramen but fair share ramen SF Bay area    far best ramen ever had!  Perfectly cooked noodles served rich flavorful stock       Also tried fried rice pork belly rice which just good      This only place dined twice during visit Vegas    We'll back next time town     Tip Avoid long wait getting early late    enjoy boba tea next door while wait  <EOR> Craving ramen deciding break away normal habits boyfriend decided try Monta hearing many good things place  Tuesday night small space packed brim  put name waiting list seated 15 20 minutes coming in   I decided Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen  food came decently fast even busy thats plus  food absolutely delicious nothing bad say it! But kind tasted every other ramen before wasn't anything special   Overall place great place when you're craving good bowl ramen but don't busy night  space insanely small most likely wouldn't seated over hour  ramen good but isn't worth wait  <EOR> Monta Ramen very intimate simple small ramen shop small menu well but good because easier choose eat even scarcely appetizers only thing really gyoza other ramen rice   We've spicy tonkotsu ramen tonkotsu shoyu ramen  serve most ramen selection thin noodles  found interesting broth offerings differentiated chicken pork combo both  spicy tonkotsu ramen comes pork broth spicy sauce thin noodles exact same tonkotsu ramen but $1 spicy sauce extra fee  alright less creamy oily usual  tonkotsu shoyu ramen mix pork chicken broth comes thin noodles broth flavor quite light lot less creamy am used which appreciated slight syrupy consistency pretty salty towards end  chashu pieces extremely tender fragile much pieces fell apart upon being picked which funny enjoyed them but also thin small slices  also interesting dark brown jelly like coating edges  kikurage mushrooms bamboo shoots finely chopped good plentiful amount fresh green onions generous  also ordered kaedama which also generous extra portion noodles which basically used rest soup within original bowl ramen   Overall prefer many other ramen places  However great value place especially since currently grab bowl ramen $7  creaminess tonkotsu broths am used replaced saltiness which became intense end  experience easily skipped but nowadays tough find ramen good price  best part eating watching chefs cool soup ladle movements ramen bowls  <EOR> Everyone raaaaves Monta good but Fukumimi really takes cake me! Maybe Monta popular because Chinatown also busiest plazas great restaurants around them  Don't wrong bad   Monta good  usually tonkatsu ramen add seaweed  indifferent Monta think because last time weekday 10min closing   know restaurants hate when come when they're close but still good chunk customers eating  rushed minute sat wouldn't let order gyoza because takes 15min make  fine once placed ramen came less 5min  didn't realize time but order wrong  felt rushed ate noodles less 5min  time sat time left restaurant total 20min  Definitely stomach ache night too  <EOR> My Girlfriend asked day try ramen house  initial thought something lunch your college days  blown away depth flavor broth authenticity deliver  menu simple short  Four different broths few additional toppings couple rice pork options appetizers  usually line but great food always prepared wait 20 30 minutes place isn't very big  don't square feet exception service great authentic ramen flavor  <EOR> You hungry but you're budget? Well never fear Monta here! under $10 delicious meal no comparison town  Tonkotsu Ramen literally best tasting noodles ever   PERIOD So if ever feel Tyrese say yourself Hungry! Ask your friends Did anyone suggest Monta yet? ever thankful you've enlightened them ramen should really served  would know once used guy  Now customer life   Ask for Ray men $10 Tonkotsu Base Miso Men Wavy Noodles Extra Chashu Corn Chili Powder  Optional Garlic Not recommended dates Asahi Goes well PB J <EOR> Came lunch other day mediocre experience best  Arrived 11 35 am wait first batch folks finish ramen!  Started off Gyoza which mediocre  wasn't super fresh although acceptable     nothing special   The tonkotsu shoyu ramen w chashu green onions okay  Added nitamago hard boiled egg which made ramen much more tasty! other Yelpers mentioned use skinny noodles here   so less substance chew on  chashu tender although fattier side   The hard boiled egg probably highlight meal cooked medium  $15 person tax tip lunch  <EOR> Ramen always good idea especially if Monta!  I always miso ramen corn  love flavorful yet light broth! Come check them out! <EOR> HOT! sure if air conditioner normally off but 94 degrees inside! Hot room hot ramen good combination    The noodles husband salty  Mine were   ehh  could done better cheap pack noodles home few eggs   For $42 worth it just NOODLES! <EOR> This ramen place could well LA area  miso ramen spicy flavor point  charsu delicious basically melts your mouth Very quick service course great feel restaurant  Definitely stop again when town  <EOR> Everyone needs aware place SMALL  think even using word small inaccurate but tiny  Absolutely no waiting area wait inside place crammed parking lot itself isn't big either  miso ramen which yummy but salty  pork served it    to die for! place would lot better if simply more space! good thing opening new location next year Green Valley! Yay  <EOR> Amazing find Las Vegas visiting California! Black garlic oil ramen best ever had!  saying lot husband even ramen JAPAN! husband shout Tonkatsu which also delicious!! ramen shop small which feels authentic most traditional Japanese ramen spots  service quick waitresses sweet friendly! restaurant located Chinatown off strip area walk around any means  But worth trip if want some Uber delicious ramen!! <EOR> I tried ramen handful times always good flavor filling  But high sodium side  Cool spot little tight seating but if want 5 star seats somewhere else  Overall good service point  <EOR> GREAT food!!!  I love gyoza they're crispy outside warm juicy inside   I always tonkotsu ramen extra chasu never fails amaze me    what say Its just tooo good miss out  <EOR> This small bustling hole wall serving some best meals under $10 Vegas    There's only handful small tables limited bar seating almost always queue  well worth usually short wait time   The kitchen steaming cauldrons busy cooks seen over bar creates fun atmosphere    The menu straightforward uncomplicated  love simplicity   The gyoza crispy delicious ramen always cooked perfectly chashu pork tender  some killer sides rice bowls   Everything reasonably priced   The pork belly rice bowl phenomenal  meat slow braised into buttery tender melt your mouth goodness   The waitresses friendly accommodating especially considering busy place is    They could probably use larger space more tables eliminate wait times but small space part charm  Enjoy it  <EOR> Never really thought try even find ramen house Vegas considering typically drunk just walking strip all day long but place DEFINITELY good find   Chanced upon quaint little establishment while visiting friends Vegas recommended should eat because loved noodles much   Definitely comparable favorite ramen places   5 stars far Vegas concerned! I little skeptic first but walking into tiny little place which probably seats no more 20 30 guests pleasant little surprises trip     Ordered Gyoza Tonkotsu ramen hard boiled egg   gyoza   typical   ramen actually quite good   noodles nice soft broth flavorful much   yolk egg pretty salty even taste and LOVE salty but Chasu   MAN don't know exactly cooked but frickin good   ate all ramen fiancee's leftovers full but would've still eaten some more just because liked much     I definitely see place getting quite busy peak times considering size all come outside meal rush hours     Service good   No complaints nothing especially ordinary either     Parking fine place shares large lot several other establishments    <EOR> Delicious Tonkatsu broth great noodle consistency topics fresh  must try! <EOR> QUICK DIRTY Before stuffing your face silicone boobies butts Vegas fuel bowl deliciousness Monta Ramen   ***** My chubby Filipino Uber driver  transporting friend airport hotel  tried selling strippers room night  decided steer conversation man where does Asian homie down some ramen Vegas? He replied Oh Monta Ramen dog   spot  yelped course corroborated recommendation four star average overall glowing reviews   Things know *****  I  LOCATION PARKING small restaurant resides strip mall off Spring Mountain Road  sits adjacent Kung Fu Tea Big Wong  Could shopping area any more Asian? haha    The lot doesn't lot room parking harder ascending top rope end just every Ninja Warrior course    God speed   II  FOOD DRINK simplified menu ensures speedy service  serve six different kinds ramen your base each added topping course costs extra  also offer cold noodle dish appetizers ranging gyoza three different kinds fried rice Ashai Budweiser beer  carry tea Coke products too    I tasted Kuro Ramen Black Garlic Oil which garlic flavored pork broth thin noodles $6 95   toppings ordered soft boil egg $1 50 chasu $2 50 The savory broth nice depth it  other ramen places where just tastes watered salt  also enough garlic    This bowl also comes thin noodles they're bouncy chewy might receive traditional tonkotsu  However still enjoyed eating them   The slices chashu pork melted mouth  regret getting another order    The soft boiled egg came soup cold assuming cook them beforehand then refrigerate order save time  Maybe? don't know  Maybe pouring ladle two broth over egg before bringing would've helped  big deal though    III  SERVICE efficient setup food came fast  Also host server treated nicely  No problems there   IV  AMBIENCE DECOR small shop seems only fit 30 people if that  wouldn't recommend Manta though groups  Rather I'd recommend place those wanting eat solo couple other people MOST  I'd also recommend Uber drivers trying hook passengers strippers too  Haha   V  PRICES Affordable especially when considering other food options Vegas  I'd eat weekly if lived close honestly    VI  OVERALL ramen blow your mind?

Now tonkatsu shoyu all fixings except greens side kimchi! always find myself thinking noodle soup ratio off need more soup!!!! always sure thinner noodles because taste better! Sometimes broth way salty sometimes leave feeling just drank bunch pork fat but keep going back strangely addicting LOL   The gyoza kimchi fried rice good but nothing special The negative really small restaurant AC best  There's most likely always wait  order keep flow going please courteous eat your ramen leave! place lolly gag you're done eating quickly give your table next hungry group suffer consequence angry looks!!!!! LOL   Hot Tip If don't want wait really odd times 3 00 5 00 there's usually never wait <EOR> My homie Lutz took past weekend Vegas   and he ranting raving good spot was  He claimed best he ever tasted      and admit   it all then some tall dark handsome tribe called quest reference hehe jk anyway The Venue aka Vibe Clean Quaint Accessible small groups   I dig face food don't bother while eating environment! usually when huge spot gang loud mouf mofos its hard enjoy your food! but then again Japanese loud period  The Service server made everything pleasant being informative menu great but anything complain about  Plus food pretty quick  Considering officially first real meal 4 5 hour trip huuuuuuuge plus! The Food ordered Tonkatus Shoyu Ramen   with extra chashu extra flavored egg  definitely flavorful broth amazing noodles soft easy gobble !!!!! very tempted order some more noodles but amazingly full pretty quick! 've pretty good ramen all over Torrance Honolulu must say ranks there    Maybe because Vegas considered 9th island   the local Japanese Hawaiians right everytime    If you're South Bay am its pretty comparable Yamadaya Hakata   but overall still another those would come back Vegas first pit stop some bomb ass Ramen yo! <EOR> Okay crazy ramen kick last few weeks   can't seem sick which really needs happen soon because all sodium condusive eating clean healthy   I know said Sora review probably would back Monta falling deep passionate love bowl ramen Sora but wanted eat myself today knew if Monta could probably seat quicker Sora since Monta counter top seating   used Monta every Saturday lunch myself noticed lot people eat themselves which easier faster seat   Today busy!  busy fact still wait 15 minutes before getting seated  only couple servers also double triples? hostesses bussers ladies running around crazy   Sora just find myself exremely impressed quickly turn tables over without making feel rushed when you're eating   love sit counter top watch them making ramen   guys super nice usually chat little bit when Saturdays but today he constantly running around getting those delicious bowls steaming ramen kitchen      Anyway don't anything against Monta   just think Sora way better   However did leave today feeling extremely happy satisfied   always Tonkatsu Shoyu chasyu nitamago   bowl ramen usually more enough me   If someone usually also gyoza which good but nothing special   Today however decided try something new adventurously ordered kimchi fried rice   sure why regular fried rice comes small large but add some kimchi only size which large serving   But glad because freakin' wonderful!  seasoning just perfect kim chi just subtle enought doesn't overpower fried rice taste   can't wait eat leftovers!  I still can't help but compare ramen Monta ramen Sora though falls short still really enjoy Monta part ramen rotation continue every once while  <EOR> I've tried lot ramen places really one   bad Vegas   I black garlic tonkotsu ramen   came 2 super thinly sliced pork   RECOMMEND another 5 slices pork chashu because give u littleee!!

Glad find place!!! <EOR> As you've probably seen lot reviews Monta Ramen located tiny heavy trafficked complex Chinatown area Las Vegas  Parking almost always pain location probably seat max 25 30 people once hence looong lines   said if looking quality good ramen think worth try   The most recent time tonkotsu ramen egg had order extra because included standard order gyoza appetizer share  pork broth delicious! Definitely hits spot  wish bowl came more meat  order extra pork may try next time  gyoza honestly just pretty standard nothing memorable   The customer service good every time gone really try efficient quick lines moving  <EOR> Really nice place worth long right when opens off hours   This third visit Monta but first time review     1   lines place typical Ramen shop limited space eat wait but worth it   suggestion when opens all good   2   food had a   Miso Ramen Bean Paste Ramen very tasty  noodles perfect  b   Shoyu Ramen Soy Sauce flavored broth nice stand by  c   Tonkatsu Ramen Pork Bone broth favorite   All noodles just right al dente broth piping hot would expect but tasty overall   Perhaps believe western palate does prefer hot broth but piping hot perfect   soups perfect blend roasted pork slices tender tasty   3   Price Very reasonable approximately 7 00 depending if put extra stuff noodles   Check place out   disappointed  <EOR> I am now ramen believer! restaurant completely changed perspective ramen  before but first time truly enjoyed bowl ramen  Everything tasted fresh broth very flavorful    I visited Friday 6 pm large group  lucky enough arrive early because otherwise am sure if would seated  place small sits very few people  no wait time time but time left around 7 pm long line    I ordered miso ramen added green onions egg side kimchi  portions good enough satisfy  am definitely visiting establishment again  <EOR> I looking some good eats Vegas Dru C recommended place  THANK DRU C!!!!!!!!

The price worth compare most places near strip   To sum good food decent price but don't expect anything extraordinary if Japanese ramen before <EOR> Excellent roast pork slices   broth noodles good   Service atmosphere you'd expect popular noodle house packed but efficient  <EOR> Get  out   random find such amazing ramen middle Las Vegas but LOVE IT!  now every time area drop by   My dad's friends brought he suggested place even took blown away   arrived before opening 11 am they open 11 30 find people already lined waiting in   heat ridiculous but people waiting inside cars AC running   Yes  place good   Luckily snagged last table very first round seating upon opening  The restaurant definitely smaller side  There's lot great ramen LA but Monta left craving its ramen   Tonkotsu total winner chahan BOMB   Service great too   no BS ramen order eat leave!  most definitely back already can't wait  <EOR> Came location good friend first time  Never really saw interior restaurant Yelp but damn pretty small if ask me  would always hear hype place AMAZING ramen here  When arrived wait 15 minutes which tolerable    Parking problem area but Uber'd time didn't worry that    I ordered Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen  Starting prices pretty cheap extra toppings add  added extra tamago egg extra pork  Long story short  add ons definitely add costs your ramen    We ordered fried rice also which really good pork belly which comes small large  all honestly food good but BROTH different story  broth thick liking creamy couldn't even drink all broth  feel broth salty side asked friend he agreed    Funny thing whenever group friends crave ramen would always separate different ramen joints  Half them would Monta other half would Ramen Sora  But all honesty depends person because all different takes ramen  Monta good but broth just ruins me  <EOR> Ramen little cold side  butter did melt  If warmer would've 4 5  broth thick meat tender  Added corn egg side of course!   wait weekend least 20 minutes don't come hungry  Limited seating  <EOR> My black ramen awesome  Fried garlic created aroma delivers energy  The soup might little bit salty finish but overall good  <EOR> My wife love place  3 times now both love it  Even 11 month old eats noodles broth  personally tried The spicy tonkatsu ramen tonkatsu ramen miso ramen tonkatsu shoyu ramen  far favorite last one  sides tried gyoza kimchi fried rice  Both very good  Kimchi fried rice better two  authentic korean but ok because Japanese restaurant korean  When come kaedama more noodles  feel give more noodles kaedama comes original bowl  Can't say enough good things place  Oh cheap! <EOR> Service quick friendly definitely 5 star there  Food ok  Ordered ramen broth just ok sure where all 5 star review food come from  better tasting ramen there  <EOR> I must say all ramen places tried Monta definitely sticks out  ramen NorCal SoCal New York  don't call myself very knowledgeable but sure hell know eat  best ramen place tried Ippudo which located Manhattan NY  However Monta does come close    Monta quite small restaurant those homely feels it  thing didn't quite stuffy was  during warm days wasn't even hot but all fans couldn't even feel them  place pretty poor circulation stuffy  I'd hate see during actual summer temperature where hits over 100 degrees     I tonkotsu ramen corn  definitely recommended  broth rich full flavor  yummy  However because rich yummy broth don't suggest adding egg it  Because once egg loses its flavor broth overpowers it  no point     I would've given place five full stars if waitress helped us  Oh service fine throughout meal  When first took orders down she offered Would everything check split checks? party 8  Obviously some cash some didn't would prefer latter  answered Split checks would nice But then she responds could but could please 8 separate checks? little bit much  SORRY? Really why did even bother offer?   I didn't feel arguing bothering just check  don't offer something then take back your offer  least lay your own terms down before finish offering  Thank you     But hey  Food's good  Just tiny bit irked me  <EOR> 5 stars ramen cost! always tonkotsu shoyu ramen sometimes corn 50 cents extra bad all considering paid $2 extra before YIKES!

Did just train locals back Japan? Maybe busier restaurants harder maintain original flavor  TRULY SAD  Publicity overrated reviews messed place up  <EOR> friend recommended hear alot buzz place  and sure enough immediately became fan  The broth very rich good  The ramen smooth thin tell freshly made  The spicy salmon roe mini rice bowl yummy  Excellent customer service  Strongly recommended <EOR> This place awesome!
