Also would given zero stars if yelp would let me  Stay away! <EOR> My wife eat Forte every time visit Las Vegas food very good  However most recent visit last  excellent lunch left 18 percent tip  When received charge credit card 52 cents added tip  generally tip dollar addition mistake  called restaurant twice asked manager return call  None forthcoming  restaurant experience beyond food if restaurant condone adding money tip management can't give customer return call doesn't deserve business  <EOR> I never reviewed any place before but experience bad to  star only because no option no stars    Horrible service!!!! We sat down waited very long time till even asked drinks  ordered something brought another thing  happen but when asked difference between Serbian Bulgarian Grill just because first time familiar serbian bulgarian food description menu different language answer just different sausages then she rolled eyes  made write review  rude!  Overpriced considering size portions paid drink never which didn't even mentioned because time just wanted there  <EOR> Really good unique dishes friendly staff  Very cozy inside too  friend ordered several items menu  Everything great  <EOR> We decided late night appetizer decided stop into establishment   Upon entry welcomed sweet hostess friendly waiter   great variety dishes choose but selected few   tried MIxed Tapas Plate Pitcher Sangria Stuffed Grape Leaves Chicken Shich Kabob and dessert    Tiramisu Baileys coffee easy whip I thought Mixed Tapas plate mediocre exciting establishment's environment   tasty kabobs flavorful grape leaves striking sangria definitely made it   would back try other items menu but would definitely order sangria grape leaves again! <EOR> I can't say enough good things Forte  tonight wife   both thought food great service great price meal reasonable   waiter answered questions made thoughtful recommendations attentive needs   shared bacon wrapped dates great cucumber tomato feta salad clay pot dish assortment Bulgarian sausage   food perfectly seasoned very tasty   well worth cab ride off strip great ethnic meal   whole meal only cost $35 just right two   well definitely return when Vegas recommend friends family  <EOR> Awesome cocktails Eastern European tapas!  Service excellent owner accommodating sweet  Definitely great hidden gems Las Vegas   Definitely recommend Gypsy Milk cocktail Sweet Peppers  <EOR> We tried place because saw Triple D really enjoyed it  must say never eaten Bulgarian food feeling might always which says even more place  very good normally kind food I'd but very tasty  wife liked even more I  don't even remember know those little clay pots  Both quite impressed  friendly local dive atmosphere too  imagine every person Bulgarian decent must surely come eat place  recommend it  <EOR> On whole restaurant does give new patron great slice  European cuisine worth noting if you've never before should try because most food now delicious but having past knowing foods really really soured experience   It's long time since back place since its first inception  Back then place only occupied storefronts dead strip mall  place menu meat cheese heavy showcased wide assortment Eastern Bloc varieties   The appeal place addition great food tell tale sign great hole wall joint Authentic European food sketchy European groups men women engaging non English conversation woman running show knew good made sure ate it   The most notable things were Shopska salad It creamiest Bulgarian feta cheese  Don't mistake feta Greek feta  incredible   Cevape Homemade fat finger sized sausages served lepina type yeasty flatbread   Artisian Charcuterie Plate Cheese Plate 2 definite musts light eating drinks  Leskovacka pljeskavica similar cevape flavor but served over sized burger  There also few kabob like meats few other sausages similar cevape delicious   So why poor rating? Mostly due fact described hoping find most recent visit today   Our waiter informed he brand new didn't know much menu wine selection  He also pointed each trip back table nobody assisting he learning  point whatever reason he waiter end meal   We Beef Stroganoff Ragu Thracian Clay Pot Chicken Soup Chebureki Bacon wrapped dates Beef Lamb Confit  really interested Thracian Clay Pot recently featured Food Network show   The Stroganoff ladled over wild mushroom plemeni kind Russian tortellini  stroganoff lot creamy goodness but completely lacking meat   I'll Thracian Clay Pot shortly  Chicken Soup desired kids ages 8 6 well bacon wrapped dates  chicken soup quite chunky big chicken flavor  first round dates looked spent 1 minute long pan where side cooked good other burnt  informed cook likes cook way which reply Please give unburned bacon wrapped dates  very good getting order back rest items come out   The Chebureki akin samosa where flattened dough item filled something deep fried case delicious meat filling topped some dill chopped scallions  Fairly standard flavor served any type dipping sauce   The Beef Lamb Confit tender tasty served atop small scoop dill scallion rice  While tasty distinct one  son said corned beef? know what? He right  did taste lot type corned beef I'd find chunky hash Hash House go go  But  another review   So now back Thracian Clay Pot  would seem during shuffling waiters table waiter put order incorrectly given another table because didn't during course them bringing rest order  When questioned why long wait told takes while  didn't hour initially ordering 30 minutes reordering it  can't tell melty delicious looked would taste but table next seemed really enjoy it   I'm vodka drinker please read other ratings extensive vodka menu   This still doesn't really warrant low rating based food  Where really lacked overall experience now versus where was  place used people knew food wasn't afraid give locals some food couldn't pronounce keep true themselves  Now waitstaff don't know product don't feel excited food   If your looking something new Vegas haven't your experience most likely 4 5 stars  something find anywhere else unique  displeasure seeing restaurant jump shark  <EOR> This place amazing great food  clay pot stuff dates bacon favorite lots flavor   also tried Octopus olive oil amazing!

The section Spain features variety chorizo sausages amongst other items  chistora bilbao each $2 50 which fantastically charred fantastic value  rivaled Polish links Costco far sausage bargains much better opinion   One note selections included chicken skewers $3 25 each sauteed shrimp $6 50 Bulgarian shopski served adorable clay pot $6 99   Though few minor flops thing love most place try lot different foods you've probably never heard if don't them haven't spent enough regret having given them whirl   Coming back wine ordered glass Spanish Cosechero Blanco which told cannot found anywhere else Vegas  Guess much? $4 50!! owner restaurant waitress second visit gem herself offered sell bottle wholesale cost when mentioned liked it  bottle later cost just $8 20  pretty much sealed deal me!
