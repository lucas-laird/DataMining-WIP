In addition food always fresh fast hearty sized portions leave satisfied some leftovers take work following day! Over time  tried dozens items menu never disappointed  look forward warm bread butter serve soon you're seated TIP Ask side shredded Parmesan cheese bread dip buttered slices into cheese! WOW!    It very uncommon but instances where mistakes order did occur such forgetting remove chicken when asked having dish served cold  But when brought attention always extra sincere apologetic always reimburse your satisfaction won't take points off that!  When all said done yet find restaurant quality food service particular Cheesecake Factory offer! <EOR> Went Cheesecake Factory first time long time  Boy mediocre! wife walked 3 30PM almost entirely empty  wife currently walking cane she recovering knee replacement surgery  hostess greeted promptly told would five minute wait please seat  WHAT??? five minute wait empty restaurant???

How? wasn't even busy when there!! finally told we're leaving  No manager came talk us  Obviously staff doesn't fall far pathetic manager  No gives damn  <EOR> Ah Cheesecake Factory  Every time come stick rotation dishes including jambalaya buffalo blasts occasionally salmon never disappointed  Throw delectable selection cheesecakes always heaven  mention gigantic portions   Recently CF added small bites menu which perfect size if want sample bunch random tasty treats  don't think I'd ever purposely come if given choice but once while truly hits spot! Did mention cheesecake? Good can't forget it  <EOR> Cheese cake = delicious Other food = bleh  The Kobe Burger burnt even though asked medium rare  tasted cardboard  dried dead leaves  cheese cake however delicious Red Velvet but time ate dessert already full unsatisfactory burger fries  <EOR> Excellent!  The menu extensive hard time deciding wanted because much looked delicious   The kids pizza huge! kids pizza three kids split some left over   Service average   And course cheesecake amazing Hershey cheesecake  <EOR> Upon arrival informed hostess celebrating 10 year anniversary  picked cheesecake hostess said would decorate plate send candle end meal  She said she would pass message along server  saw write everything down   The server friendly greeted timely manner  He over soup day well daily specials  ordered Eggroll sampler all egg rolls greasy dripping oil  chicken madeira excellent usual  herb crusted salmon okay    When full server kind enough pack food but he failed crumb table left dirty silverware small plates middle table  even moved everything middle table would easy pick because knew he would bringing cheesecake wanted take photos  end lunch server handed dessert menus gave eye  He said 'I it'    brought cheap birthday sundae pure whip cream  He put right middle all dirty dishes  really ruined me  Cheesecake Factory FAVORITE RESTAURANT   should say WAS  honest service 15 years ago significantly better service received within past few years   especially Summerlin location  drop dessert table dirty plates food crumbs everywhere?? I'd add even busy  where cheesecake preordered hostess said going decorate special occasion?  I over 20 years restaurant hospitality experience yes! am restaurant service snob! maybe service expectations high   but wouldn't expect anything else Cheesecake Factory  am truly disappointed recent experiences your establishment  few years ago  server refilled water another water cup saying she couldn't find any water pitchers anywhere    only Summerlin location kind service! <EOR> I normally would Cheesecake Factory green valley where never issue but since area friends came location    I really blown away level horrible service received barely even know where start  First took probably 20 30 minutes drinks come iced tea!

Before sandwich finally came managers came sort apologize quickly left table before could even express unhappiness  final straw when waiter clearly trying rid moving quickly hand boxes boxed cheesecake he knocked over half drunk overly expensive drink all over phone all down front me  He barely apologized rushed off    I really never complain let alone post anything but service received today totally unacceptable returning location  If could would given location zero stars  <EOR> Second time returning infamous cheese cake factory  location pretty settle atmosphere ambience 10 10  Stopped cheesecakes today  three huge slices cake  way many choose from  Ordered 3 slices $26  Well worth price  Dug right into cakes super sweet= HAPPINESS  Always pleasure !! <EOR> So last night hubby cheesecake factory highly disappointed  give only 2 stars  cheesecake only good thing   To start server Shannon D think she doesn't job  server myself enough attention she didn't stop ask aour food tasting  Cause sure problem calamari good  no idea kitchen did half them sticking together big clump seamed cleaned right way too  Our server more concerned much tips she made big party right across then taking little more care other guest  dink empty while sure busy cause big party already left  way if iron your shirt pants might look little more professional then looking crumbled head toe  really nice look remember your service job!

Man sollte den Cheesecake aber besser als Hauptspeise und weniger als Dessert bewerten  Ansonsten könnte man Gefahr laufen dass man einfach platzt  Die Portionen sind ordentlich und der Kuchen selbst wird mit einem dicken Schlag Sahne serviert  Diese braucht man aber eigentlich gar nicht der Kuchen selbst ist saftig genug  Service und Location waren auch Ordnung Parkplätze ausreichend vorhanden  <EOR> We family lunch Thursday pleasant experience  three asked seated booth  promptly escorted booth six without knowing intended spending lot money there  We ordered avocado egg rolls two Tuscan Asparagus chicken skinny DELICIOUS menu Americana Cheeseburger strawberry smoothie Mojito Pineapple ultimately Tiramisu Cake!
