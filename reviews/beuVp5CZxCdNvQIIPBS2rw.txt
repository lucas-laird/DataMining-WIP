been twice gotten great food each time  beef seafood fishbowl veggies combo table 10  sit separate tables but put next each other server deni great help   would come again friends family   p s  give free ice cream <EOR> Very warm friendly restaurant  called advance check seating greeted kind employee assured belly hungry night hehe   Upon arriving she thanked calling advance  nice remember!   I reccommended place friend no doubt satisfied  Las Vegas basically no conveyor belt restaurants but Chubby Cattle happened exception! still wish included sushi well though  Anyways good stuff  restaurant hot pot based side dishes rotating around motorized conveyor belt  LOVE IT  Different dishes different prices usually ranging $1 $4 believe but its all pretty affordable  ordered house pot which tasted mushroom chicken broth which delicious  conveyor belt decided take sliced beef tteokbokki korean rice cakes chopped spam spinach looked buckwheat noodles  All made delicious combination  only thing watch temperature soup  When aren't cooking ingredients sure deactivate heater else quite tongue searing ride    Between Pho would definitely choose hotpot  Why so? Hot pot customizable heated right your table  plus conveyor belt truly ended off shopping trip bang  If coming eat sure bring some friends! If don't then no fear bar like seating area those riding solo  CHECK PLACE OUT! <EOR> I excellent experience chubby cattle  Everything delicious  favorite lamb chop  best  also love unlimited free sauces mix your own  atmosphere great servers especially Kwan Gillbert friendly nice  <EOR> Super awesome!

The only thing would warn customers parking lot  fills real quick but many great food spots plaza  bound happen  <EOR> My friends decided come Thursday evening try since highly anticipated long while  heard rumors Little Sheep styled Hot Pot would come vegas supposed it   My friends arrived earlier told hour wait tables next conveyor belt because almost purely reservations ONLY opening hour  friend put phone number down District snack  1 hour later returned  hostess states she tried calling phone number did work  Another friend looked number tried calling  Worked perfectly fine  Does hostess know call state numbers land line? Does she know use phone? She doesnt seem much experienced customer service attitude towards customers very poor  No apology excuse  Just chugged along headless chicken    We waited another 10 minutes cramped space entrance others coming through door squeezing behind front before taken table which still incompletely set up  person setting apologized incomplete setup which appreciated fault taken incomplete table    We sat around 10 minutes before server came asked drink orders brought 1 menu  menu's designed non traditionally mounted paddle  holding bit weird    While deciding order waiter asked soup bases would like  But he said house original house spicy only mushroom seafood tomato available  almost walked out  manager came  said would ready 10 minutes if willing wait  did  asked server difference size between going around conveyor belt combos menu separate orders  He manager help us  manager told difference 5 oz 10 oz combo  asian highly confused math totally did add up  $11 lamb shoulder beef brisket told waiter which combo consisted but $17 combo  HUH!? order came window he showed size  large plate lamb shoulder piled high he said single lamb shoulder order  thought oh wao    Single order lamb shoulder actually pretty decent sized $5  Assuming beef brisket same $6  Manager seemed quite clueless too  We ordered 1 order each along 2 large orders watercress napa cabbage large order fresh thick noodles    When soup bases arrived looked bit clear friend  quite used white herb y broth little sheep surprised us  slight transparency fully white  When tasted felt watered down tasted more salt msg like  Thats disappointing  Smelled great ! tasted meh  We some oyster mushrooms enoki mushrooms glass noodles conveyor belt but nothing else looked good  friends said some oysters look going bad some turning yellow  Selection wise conveyor belt quite minimal seemed repeat quite often nor seem many people going either    When meats arrived  Give take maybe 12 slices meat per order NOTHING compared plate he shown earlier  he shown round white plate meat rolls piled high  Ours long rectangular plate meat flat layered  hell? asked size waiter said dependent slicer worker back  joked friends could tip meat slicer quite bit more  lol cos didnt but quite tempting    The veggies did look fresh  Especially watercress  Bunched together cup quite hard separate share some parts turning yellow  Napa cabbage bowl cut  Kind hard screw up    Most disappointing fresh thick noodles   definitely fresh  nor thick  LOVE fresh thick noodles Little Sheep  incomparable  large order 3 bundles noodles  all dried  thickness maybe somewhere between angel hair spaghetti  definitely thick  Fresh? uhhhhh  In end waiter apologized well confusion minimal amount info knowledge he had  He stated he only started working 3 days ago apology willingness help much appreciated    Definitely wont coming back any time soon if ever again  Won't recommend anyone try <EOR> Craving some hot pot friends came through but didn't know hot pot place worked  waiter Deni best he took time explaining order recommendations also brought some extra special dishes which favorite  don't write reviews but waiter Deni awesome acknowledge taking time helping being very attentive  <EOR> Bad service  Orders arrive lot faster when speak Chinese    Spicy soup base 75% oil contained  <EOR> The resto good  wide selection soup base your hot pot  Other having hard time park sometimes gets really busy u wait food amazing meats veggies fresh     <EOR> Amazing!

Nope   We've quite few questions menu  specific meats beef lamb combo? lamb shoulder beef brisket difference weight between ordering combo vs each item individually? combo $16 99 lamb shoulder $4 99 beef brisket $5 99 server did know answer weight question ask manager responded 10 oz combo 5 oz rest     Wait what? doesn't add up  Why would pay $16 99 combo 10oz meat vs $9 98 10 oz meat when ordered individually? party opted individual orders meat along some napa cabbage watercress 'fresh thick noodles'  veggies also confusing order menu listed 'small' 'large' prices which differed conveyor belt prices same veggie  Soup bases wanted order 'House Original' soup base 'House Hellish Spicy Pot' Mid Level Hell 12 spicy  told server sold House Original well Spicy soup bases  original soup base? almost left then but manager came told 10 minute wait if wanted those soup bases  What's 10 minutes compared wait already right?  The soup bases came first  surprised clear was  bit bland but added some garlic all good  Can't wrong garlic! Next meats veggies came out  $4 99 $5 99 believe give decent sized portion  course always cheaper supermarket but restaurant price wasn't bad  quality meats just average  could better quality elsewhere  veggies bit not s fresh side some leaves starting yellow brown  Also when 'fresh thick noodles' came dry thin  don't know but 'dried' noodles does mean fresh vocabulary  Items saw conveyor belt when entered nowhere found once soup base  Keep eye restock please!  When asked bill server apologized lack knowledge he started working three days ago  All all interesting concept try but probably returning any time soon  <EOR> Since opening quality beef gone way down along service  used favorite mine but leaving evening very very disappointed  asked beef brisket it came it basically all fat  Upon asking check server noticed didn't touch brisket asked if liked which replied no fatty but still charged  Very unhappy won't returning  <EOR> Have honest conveyor belt part restaurant drew attention  completely curious check out  all hot pot places around area now looking something different    I individuality meal pick between two soup bases  spicy looks milky while other spicy spicy understatement  love spice but ieven take  heaping amount chili peppers various spices put into broth  even warn shouldn't drink soup which bit bummer BC enjoy soup broth end  just took cup full peppers spices able drink some broth   servings meat small opinion  seafood presentation beautiful however  many choices meats vegetables noodles etc  don't order take off conveyor belt  Unfortunately everyone restaurant enjoy conveyor belt feature if going strictly experience reservation don't during peak times    This place become quite pricey is  Especially since another hot pot place down road which offers more food less price jist good  say experience unique check least once  <EOR> For most important part perfect hot pot meal soup base  although enjoy bit spice dish usually start restaurant's original soup base first visits taste flavor without any other ingredients shadowing it  broth very flavorful right amount seasoning nice herbal kick  Absolutely delicious! try luck spicy soup next time come back    As menu items restaurant offered good selection quality meat seafood  friends ordered whole array dishes ranging beef brisket crab everything fresh presented beautifully  favorite would Kobe beef oysters  Highly recommend both!

Interesting experience but probably never would back  <EOR> This such fun dining experience! original broth surprised much flavor had  great selection veggies meats your own sauce station great! only reason giving 5 star rating because server slacking bit  wasn't busy when came yet took awhile order he forgot bring dish  Overall really enjoyed dining can't wait back! <EOR> I ate much but hard when every morsel food gets soaked fiery flavour  Deni server he very accommodating made sure hot pot base full spicy enough  <EOR> Where else city authentic Mongolian hot pot  Pretty damn good price too  lady sat down quickly  came 6 30 Sunday night   Xiao waitress she very attentive  She guided through menu made sure drinks ordered just enough food  She fast friendly  menu sizeable caters every palate including vegans funny think Mongolian vegan  he probably rode rainbow unicorn   meat good portion great quality  broths flavorful tried half half  If needed more flavor dipping sauce bar nice touch   sat separate booth but conveyor also interesting feature  stuffed ourselves $66 42 before tip   bad night! <EOR> This GRRRREAT spot  Found post @eatervegas tried @chubbycattle  your own hot pot ingredients come conveyor belt  yummmm!

Based all Yelp reviews decided give try did but wished didn't  <EOR> Pretty cool concept!

beef tendon balls pork belly spinach mini pork sausages udon noodles pumpkin rounded menu  Everything fresh tasted amazing!! sauce bar filled lots options sit everyone's tastes  Lychee mojito refreshing pairs nicely everything  <EOR> First foremost believe rating false high   server tells half way through your meal if leave review Yelp while show end meal free desert   He then tried clear food while still eating asked if ready free dessert   When finally done he approached again dessert which replied didn't want dessert     The actual food just ok   broth little boring both spicy broth little spicier husband   sauce bar which pretty awesome your own sauces well couple prepared sauces   end day just kind stressful meal experience   very little room try recommend meat platter vegetable platter seafood platter didn't seafood   no room really much cooking your own stuff can't move much while trying cook   mention if want anything off conveyor belt no room put it   only two items off conveyor belt both times didn't know where put dish   two ladles broth regular holes scoop chiles such   last hot pot restaurant little container put your utensils which very convenient well pair scissors cut things something might want look into     We've hot pot before Yojie really good time   Overall think place just doesn't good job little gimmicky hip   think way sketchy when pushed reviews front staff wouldn't back   final note very intense smell kind cross between body odor bad fish almost left before seated because kind wish had  <EOR> Good enough food especially group friends  Pricey food cook yourself    customer service need improvement especially people handle telephone inquiries reservations  First lost initial reservation then group increased 17 told group large <EOR> I ate Chubby Cattle last night family did disappoint  first time eating Chinese hot pot cuisine Kwan explained everything perfectly recommended original broth which delicious  Sylvia also extremely attentive helpful she knew first time well  definitely back everything fresh absolutely decadent  <EOR> Ugh such high hopes place but coworkers agreed wouldn't back  around 9 30pm Thursday night buy free happy hour  Even bill came around $16  tomato broth beef brisket enoki mushrooms another type mushroom tripe jelly noodles j luo   Maybe think expensive because used eating 5x more food AYCEs $25   Another reviewer recommended tomato broth $4 99 got  hated it  tasted tomato paste really salty  coworker original broth liked much much better    For meat option beef brisket $5 99   cheapest option menu but still tasty  Came 7 slices  beef definitely star meal wagyu kobe options  Honestly if ever come again I'd just splurge combo skip all other stuff    The 2 mushrooms $1 99 each jelly noodles $2 99 tripe $3 59 pre happy hour discount   expensive  also really wanted chrysanthemum greens but $2 99 single serving  Chinese market enough chrysanthemum greens 10 people price  definitely wouldn't come without happy hour discount  I'd only come if weren't hungry  If you're really hungry all eat    The conveyor belt really limited options  didn't qual eggs variety fish meat balls  also didn't really look fresh  Maybe basically late slow night   I say service really good  waiter refilled waters beers even split bill which much appreciated  <EOR> This second time same experience which can't understand why doing such stupid thing big return customer  I visited few times tipped lot hoping remembered staff but already second time hard time seated since half restaurant empty  guess playing busy renowned restaurant game something  asked nicely seated conveyor side before visiting phome confirmed but when arrived even though 2 3 restaurant empty  telling seat bar   Very bad way treating customers  NEVER back here  <EOR> We found place yelp tried first time yesterday  yelp checking offer 70 percent off waygu beef  ordered soup bases vegetables wanted order different meats

However staff very clearly inexperienced  Some don't even really speak English well either  speak Mandarin don't mind because just switch languages accommodate  But don't really know own menu fact soup children 12 under marked half price menu  they're new but part hiring process should include hiring experienced management teach lead successful staff    training staff prior opening    When came last week hostess gave business card call check progressing 45 min wait quoted  weren't planning going anywhere didn't need call day  Today did call because knew took reservations  Guess what? phone number printed business card wrong  number Yelp correct though still able call  When mentioned error hostess then pointed manager no idea typo  He even grabbed phone try calling number himself though would think most people should know phone number job just recognize typo   Did everyone owners management wait staff etc notice this?? more reflection staff doesn't care?   Now let's talk dining experience  both visits took while between getting seated until anyone acknowledges take your order in 20 min ballpark   Once you've ordered take equally long soup  stuff order menu won't come together even relatively same time  example today ordered 3 plates meat 3 large bowls noodles off menu  noodles plate meat came quickly but literally done all everything took conveyer belt before last 2 plates meat arrived  drinks didn't come together either! 4 only juice came before food  food came asked 3 waters    which met waitress bringing walking away  Which led having hail down again 2 more  Really? also saw waitress talking table next us    bussers interrupted helping those guests show comment tip left next table over  probably conversation could saved when waitress wasn't table middle talking customer  Whatever case all delays service both visits made turned 2+ hour ordeals which excessive hot pot  today we're totally motivated come back anytime soon  Based service alone we'd rather pay more drive further Red Pot even though food quality isn't good  <EOR> Came Sunday night no wait  ordered combo Wagyu brisket rib eye  another dish beef lamb combo  service fast nice  price bit overpriced but meat quality pretty good  unlimited side dishes bar which contains variety sauces  would come back again! <EOR> This first time visiting chubby cattle  didn't reservation wait around 20 mins which isn't bad Saturday  hostess friendly  waiter Gillbert Kwan very attentive  satisfied service  individual hotpot  Flavor broth good quality meat  Some dish pretty price portion  fact management really take customers feedback very serious  Definitely back again <EOR> Came friend Monday night try conveyor belt hot pot themed restaurant  inside nice  decorated Halloween theme right now  There's bar seating table seating conveyor belt raw ingredients floating your hot pot  There's also sauce bar off side where build own savory dipping sauce    When sat order waitress explained restaurant works  Its individual pots per person  pick broth spicy level  Each broth 3 99 6 99 depending type spicy level  Next order all big items meats veggies hand made meatballs her  items conveyor belt smaller items mushroom bean curd tofu raw fish veggies etc  two meat combo veggie combo recommendation small portion shrimp paste  conveyor beancurd quail eggs fishball roe inside  friend also mango juice bowl rice  flavors broths good  Very flavorful  also very generous refilling it  thought ingredients fresh delicious  Meat good veggies good    The reason why give three stars price  two 80 bucks total   whopping bill hot pot  might well all eat hot pot restaurant less 30 bucks person  charge everything   Broth rice  Don't think urge try again  <EOR> Chubby Cattle best hotpot restaurant ever better Hai Di Lao Hotpot far! wonderful server Xiao Xiao incredibly courteous patient guiding through easy to use menu explaining convenient conveyor belt which contained numerous goodies including fish balls beef balls scallops even salmon sashimi not put hotpot   service fast presentation beautiful Kobe beef even came dry ice separate pot dramatic effect! just melted your mouth  in fact everything did  lamb beef chicken all sliced thinly delicately  immaculate dining experience  <EOR> Chubby cattle some really good deals! host Denny more then accommodating did great job setting atmosphere!
