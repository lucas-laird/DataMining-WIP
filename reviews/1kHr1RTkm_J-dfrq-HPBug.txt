This second visit here  I don't know if coincidence first visit ordered when alone   Second visit husband half black way came me   Anyway ordered same last time Chilaquiles no egg    I don't know if think ridiculous order chilaquiles no egg fact husband black fair toned   *I've eaten places seem single people come OBVIOUS STARING JUDGING just being there  think just happened AGAIN different way  last time Tacos El Gordo way  Racist!   Anyway waited patiently order some 15 people ordered BEFORE order   After 10 Carne Asada Fries came order asked lady register where food was? She said wasn't ready yet  Which obviously true  know because work food know takes longer put together  takes much more effort build 10 Carne Asada Fries 2 orders Chilaquiles NO EGG! Where world would ever take total 45 minutes simple breakfast dish? Nowhere! If happens you're getting played! just played! Let just say she did single care just waited half hour while others getting served before us  decided wait counter until food ready  should've already anyway   After another 10 minutes she slides order didn't even say word she greets next person line  If wouldn't asked if ours wouldn't even known  rude! No thank you  No sorry  even excuse wait  No nothing  asked again why took long food when ordered before all those people? She said well next time should call your order in! just most ridiculous thing ever heard honestly unprofessional her  Also she did apologize compensate wait any way any other decent food establishment would done  really hope management reads does some changes lack care those work customers customer service total lack compassion  particularly but sake others because come back again    This written January 14th 2018 very upset pregnant half white woman married half black man   The end  <EOR>
