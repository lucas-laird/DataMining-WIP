They lots vegetarian options those aren't meat eaters those won't disappointed options available either   What impresses most place though ample selection vegetable toppings different types sauces   This place definitely worth visit! <EOR> A previous reviewer described franchise subway pita sandwiches  What's major glaring difference? food tastes ten times better   It's exactly cheap pita tends run anywhere 6 8 bucks  extra meat whatever if you're feeling extra hungry  Obvious bear says what? What?! particular location largely caters UNLV crowd right across street workers appear students themselves  They've polite helpful everytime stopped  making sure answer questions describe menu items unclear  Business seems modest but imagine getting just fine during rush hours   The basic business model  pick type meat then customize front assortment chopped vegetables ala subway  love offer wheat pita alfalfa sprouts  Other choices include romaine lettuce roasted tomatoes cucumbers banana peppers  Among sauces opt tsatziki sauce a good idea chicken souvlaki hummus various other sauces including chipotle mayo ranch etc  Among cheese options wisely include feta pepper jack  The local special barbecued chicken grilled jalapenos onions  well chipotle mayo green peppers  I've also tried chicken souvlaki thoroughly enjoyed grilled steak  Depending much sort sauces choose add your creation leave something pretty darn healthy fast food doesn't taste half bad  If all conscious sort foods eat you'll find place refreshing choice  <EOR> I haven't eaten yet didn't know Pita Pit Las Vegas!! loved eating when lived East Coast just decided today look if Pita Pit Vegas I didn't hopes since never seen one   pretty excited find write update once hands delicious pita  <EOR> I love place  close work very fast  everything veggie meat options cater everyone's needs  print online easy take coworkers' orders    I usually just say veggie add whatever want no additional cost  place never really busy service always fast  hate sandwiches but LOVE pita  mine veggie light stillthey huge filling  <EOR> I hadn't Pita Pit since living Gainesville FL where introduced chain  When Vegas decided order some  drove hotel Pita Pit took 15 20 mins  place oddly empty big hit Gator Nation Pita Pit just slow Mondays something     Either way food good service good only person working around 7 30pm but nothing write home about  gyros wife chicken souvlakis daughter hummus pita  <EOR> I haven't actually gone into Pita Pit location review delivery  delivery fee only $1 but now think free but way super cheap delivery  first time used delivery delivery guy wrong apartment but luckily saw outside able food second time he came right place  food simple but good bad price get  usually soda chips whichever pita decide getting  fact pick want put pita  Pita Pit perfect quick food  <EOR> I've heard place word travels fast space     fast inexpensive easy no waiting clean friendly place grab quick bite  Oh good too  said already repeat sandwich shop decent selection toppings spreads sauces   The only thing little disappointed expecting more Mediterranean items exception souvlaki chicken which quite good humus feta cheese majority pita options your typical deli style choices roast beef ham etc  doesn't mean good just bit different expecting   I souvlaki chicken breast meat but still good grilled order warm soft pita fresh tasting  more ask pay less $7 for? Yes if free it'd even better but way enjoy if you're area! <EOR> It OK  Tuna Pita combo 9 38  Kinda steep  Your choice Chips Cookies  cookies otis spunkmeyer saw them taking them little oven  tuna mixed control much mayo appeared only shredded cheese no slices  lot veggies but shredded lettuce white no color all  spinach which appreciated   also SUPER loud took food use Cafe Rio's chairs which saw some others doing  can't say back value Jason's Deli Caprioitti's better   <EOR> I love place!!!   Pacific Beach San Jose San Diego them all! Bring JEKYL HYDE chicken steak pita VEGAS! <EOR> Tonight first experience true mouth orgazaim customer serviced sucked major ass male employee didn't seem alive  food made much becoming back once week won't last experience employee also works next door 3pm which find tacky  <EOR> Love pita sandwiches good  tried most flavors can't wrong it  favorite buffalo chicken because choose inside pita everything made order which nice  Chicken caesar second favorite  nice filling worth every penny  Great  quick service well  <EOR> I really add certain toppings no additional cost avocado roasted red peppers artichokes hummus  variety sauces doesn't compare subway chose jalapeño ranch delicious!   Service bit slow side but say good things happen those wait  <EOR> Not bad great  Would eat again? When need gyro chicken souvlaki hits me    perhaps if area    It's chain used Pita Pit college when attended University Nevada Reno know true  remember being highly addicted pitas based off fact could many add ins no additional money  could basically stuff pita full romaine lettuce spinach banana peppers mushrooms cucumbers all kinds tasty sauces wouldn't eat whole day because I'd full  kind point poor college student paying almost $10 combo meal Pita Pit like    half beer budget happy hour bar down street    As adult heh heh now college student Pita Pit all right  Even all stuffing veggies fit into bad boys still just all right  no means chicken souvlaki pita bad good but definitely better Greek food elsewhere  But again Pita Pit chain also serves Dagwood pita really base opinion off while comparing actual Greek places specialize *Greek* only dishes?   Overall service extremely friendly guys working absolutely fabulous  accepted LivingSocial deal quickly ease  also chatty while making pita making feel welcome  Food somewhat bland but chain guess comparison more authentic Greek places somewhat moot  Therefore Pita Pit A OK book  Check them if you're UNLV area least feel good stuffing your pita lots good greens veggies end! <EOR> Creative but flavor nothing world unfortunately  Conveniently right across Greenspun Hall place cosy  subway pitas  ordered gyro pita  gyro meat sliced fresh looked threw few pieces rubber grill chopped up  actual pita really thin thick pitas usually used to  option between white wheat pitas  Just subway pick ever toppings want  choose lettuce tomatoes onions feta cheese smear hummus tzatsiki sauce  hummus gritty sand kinda nasty  tzatsiki thick but needed salt more cucumber pretty much just yogurt  gyro meat actually some flavor but wasn't crunchy juicy oily soggy  don't even think real gyro meat sadly enough  just sandwich close $8 which worth price all! I'd eat again if $5 maybe  offer rewards program earn points every dollar spent but need 90 points free pita sandwich highly doubt ever eat again  going try Stefano's same plaza when crave gyro again  <EOR> So happy bought LivingSocial deal here! Lots positives negatives though   This Pita Pit extremely clean lot options  Though expensive found pita's didn't fill up    I fan person register making pitas while simultaneously taking orders sanitary    I found Pita Pit doesn't great system because people crowding around fillings waiting trying tell employee want pita very small area  restaurant needs more spread everything clumped together  <EOR> I just home enjoy Pitas little critical  think kid helping sweet but maybe needs bit more training  Very nice kid though! gyro meat needs cooked more  waaaaay mushy  Just let sear bit would great  romaine bit wilted missing crunch but  easy fix!   love flavor pita whole concept  definitely back try more things  Everyone behind counter friendly very personable city customer service industry people super important! <EOR> This place should able call itself Mediterranean all  Frozen gyro slices even frozen deli turkey slices  Meat cooked all way through like microwaved burrito where still little frozen middle   Oh where plates? Service strange putting kindly  Would definitely eat again  Blegh! <EOR> Was pretty disappointed  gyro bad mistake part tasted really bland  fact lot more toppings more healthy options both vegetarians meat lovers Subway but prices expensive  <EOR> Before discovered Pita Pit used regular Subway since only convenient vegan vegetarian option thought around especially UNLV  After coming completely RENOUNCED Subway   Actually fact Pita Pit Subway both exist same time kind confuses angers me    Pita Pit gives WAY more options variety ingredients much fresher  add avocado hummus tzaziki no extra cost   They freshly prepare meats grill right front you  They vegan section menu always order black bean pita which always stuff full ingredients until really huge  taken plenty non vegetarians love it  Every time    What really gets COSTS SAME Subway  Especially since Subway hiked prices  Blows mind  <EOR> I Pita Pit enough   don't LOVE Pita Pit   don't really know why   food okay service slow but friendly    wasn't bad anything    but just didn't me  don't really motivation try different things   falafel pita which okay   would probably something else better but    meh   just feeling it   almost feel bad because once lacking any explanation it!  just don't it  <EOR> **3 5 stars**  Pita Pit great find search healthy bite eat     We greeted very friendly gentleman counter   He took order began making couple people's order   When he ours he calls over asked specifically want your pita love customization!  veggie pita good all ingredients fresh least pita   husband gyro which meat frozen then cooked grill order      Prices reasonable parking easy service friendly food good! <EOR> The Pita Pit chain most expensive university food  I'd eaten chain when Oklahoma State I'd say sure most overpriced sandwich shop near UNLV  good $9 $12 meal  Granted if actually put vegetables your sandwich I put literally everything offer mine won't need eat rest day but still  cheap students    I've gyro good Dagwood meh  I'd stick gyro meat  love bevy spreads sauces but again definitely charge it    The place clean but also noticed employees switch between jobs without changing gloves which defeats purpose gloves   Although food good expensive student regular stop me  <EOR> The Pita Pit commercializes reinvention sandwich  routine basically same would hear any other sandwich place whether want white wheat toppings etc but few refreshing differences   I ordered gyro pita pocket   There lot more choices spreads including tsiziki which picked  honest tsiziki wasn't anything very special but nice offered it    There also lot stuffings too  Some found appealing feta cheese alfalfa sprouts artichoke hearts! Yum!   After building your pita pocket wrap sub paper you  Personally would appreciated eat mine bowl fork knife because pita pocket pretty stuffed but managed well enough   The Pita Pit place stop if craving fun healthy meal  Mine definitely filled up  <EOR> I've twice far each time pita amazingly delicious   Dagwood first time Chicken Souvlaki second   great thing place choose type pita bread want then want your pita Subway style     variety veggies sauces   avocado does cost extra other restaurants which nice   meat cooked fresh front placed inside pita   convenient location right across UNLV coming back more often! <EOR> Looking something go? Pita pit fast better then other fast food joints  Pick your toppings  chicken Slouvaki If you're area  Stop in   I'm huge fan pita wraps! Parking lot  Casual  Great customer service! <EOR> Imagine Subway but Pitas instead bread   that basically sums Pita Pit  may gone expectations high maybe bad time day but just didn't place much I'd hoped would    On way home Thursday evening stopped Pita Pit dinner  ordered Chicken Souvlaki wheat pita  good but wasn't great  place pretty dead only guy working toppings Pitas hummus lettuce mushrooms etc looked they'd sitting quite some time  disappointment because I'd kept hearing fresh ingredients place are  server however both friendly helpful taking order  Pita decent  definitely try again because nice alternative subway really want place but time order falafel   update posted time  Until then all say is    ok  <EOR> This great affordable spot grab quick bite eat any time day  Although haven't breakfast steak eggs next list try  stop using UNLV gym location very close campus easily within walking distance any residence halls  pre configured items menu but best part place everything customizable! nearly two dozen sauces adorn any type pita like  Certain pitas come different meat choices vegetarian options  Once choose base your pita customize wide selection veggies spreads cheeses course sauces  healthy indulgent want which something love restaurant! would definitely recommend Pita Pit eaters any taste preference  <EOR>
