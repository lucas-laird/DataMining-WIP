Unfortunately best thing said place nice interior more upscale your typical Indian establishment  Otherwise food decidedly mediocre service absolutely atrocious some worst experienced long time  But let's start beginning     On big banner right outside restaurant advertised 3 course dinner two $29 99  Upon inquiring option waiter informed special no longer being offered they've meaning take down  However did 5 course tasting menu served family style $45 per person! Now waiter bullshitting website which advertises same special out of date well  way call classic bait switch FALSE advertising! should taken hint walked then but hungry  Unfortunately same thought would recurring theme throughout rest evening  asked included 5 course tasting menu terribly excited heard didn't seem worth anywhere near $90 two us  asked few more minutes peruse menu   After 5 minutes decided sweet apricot raisin naan $4 chicken tikka makhani $13 seven spice veal $25 baby eggplant $11 2 side dishes chana massala aloo gobi $7 each   Oh pay another $3 single order rice because none entrees came any! ended waiting another 15 minutes before another waiter spotted looking bit perturbed asked if needed anything  told ready order  thought he going take order but instead he just told original waiter ready would right   waiter running couple's credit card those portable terminals right table  receipt signed waiter continued idly chat them another 5 minutes so  Then waiter disappeared into kitchen God knows where another 10 minutes before finally coming take order  He apologized waiting a few minutes yeah right try half hour   would more understanding if really busy but less 1 5 tables occupied  know know should've walked already   So finally order but wait wait wait some more  continue watch other customers sat down ordered food first case actually pay bill leave! point am incredibly green envy customers other waiter   half hour finally bring all food once  point absolutely ravenous but spirits lifted hopes would worth wait   Unfortunately while food satiated hunger pangs substandard Indian fare  naan crispy all but rather thick gummy  didn't contain very much apricot raisin no chutney tamarind mint any kind condiments offered  chicken makhani usually favorites kind bland  lacked spicy complexity good curry should have  chicken didn't seem marinated all  dry probably cooked separately then tossed into curry end  aloo gobi mostly potato contained very little cauliflower  both bitefuls undercooked semi raw potato well  chana massala veal baby eggplant dishes fared no better   During time no stopped ask food was  Nobody offered refill nearly empty glasses water until ready pay check  asking check waited over 15 minutes before waiter returned expecting collect check  When explained still received check he disappeared another 4 5 minutes before finally returning check  usually pay via credit card but decided better settle cash lest want spend another half hour waiting  almost never leave no tip but thinking rare situations qualify  However friend lobbies hard leave least 10%  we're walking back cars Black crack whore tries solicit us  Ah fitting end such memorable evening!  Here's executive summary nice interior ambiance over priced mediocre food horrendous service  am sorely tempted give 1 star but since food least edible except undercooked potatoes suppose just BARELY merits 2 stars  Take advice save your money time  Don't it  Just somewhere else Mount Everest Namaste Samosa Factory  <EOR> This response Raja M  post  Are owner?

Every time Vegas sure stop grab lunch yes lunch dinner  Lunch almost half price dinner serve same portion food    My favorite chicken Mak Markani  love spicy food always ask INDIAN spicy AMERICAN spicy when comes spice level    The decor just OK  much brown which gloomy but staff really nice  Ask seated Abel's section  <EOR> This restaurant BEST Indian Restaurant ever Las Vegas  ambiance food service everything 5 5  always eat when am Vegas  MUST GO!!  Warning Its bit pricey    $$$ 1 drink bar main course  No appetizer   $$ just main course  No appetizer  <EOR> My boyfriend ate 3 13 restaurant week wasn't expecting much since Indian restaurants vegas sub par best    Well appetizers disappointing  chicken ok nothing write home stuffed mushroom really gross lamb kebab way spicy fish dry luckily brought mint chutney tamarind sauce    I relieved entrees better  tandoori chicken excellent! Lentils ok lamb pretty good  Couldn't keep hands off naan yummy    A piece advice skip dessert  panna cotta tasted jello bf's doughnut holes tasted pancakes ___ Service wasn't great decor alright  Probably won't back  <EOR> I consider myself curry aficionado  grew Vancouver which its large Indian community amazing curries  lived London several years which some best curry houses there  know good curry Origin just doesn't it   Perhaps fusion menu somewhat better traditional menu but mood curry stuck traditional  ordered 4 different dishes 2 mains 2 sides  curried lamb shank prawn dish mutter paneer dal mahkani    Let clear curry necessarily bad just wasn't good  Each dishes tasted exactly same looked much same  food bathed some sort bitter tasting dark colored gravy  would fine stand alone dish but getting 4 plates exactly same flavor texture just didn't me    The other off putting thing place turn burn type service  rushed even though reservations wasn't busy  server didn't come back once except bring check  Also bus boy came take plates away 2 mins being served before even started food! Oh overpriced too   I say am disappointed  high hopes reading fellow yelpers' reviews  search good curry Vegas continues    <EOR> YELP COUPON USERS BEWARE! We read all fine print coupon before purchasing $20 $40  When arrived lunch buffet only option  presented coupon told couldn't use lunch nor could use buffet   IT DOES SAY ANYWHERE COUPON   After bit arguing waiter reluctantly said he'd accept coupon off buffet  The food excellent  Everything tried good quality well spiced  eaten many Indian restaurants all over world better ones   Personally don't love using coupons even if purchase them  Dunno just feel cheap  But way feel even crappier using coupon   That bought!  After ate presented coupon another waiter argued again gave attitude when explained other waiter said he'd accept it   Bottom line is If restrictions your coupons put freaking coupon fine print! noticed fact coupon actually states Business owner Deal must honored according terms certificate  No additional restrictions may added time redemption  why customer feel crap?!?!   It's really bad because food delicious but attitude turned off  <EOR> Wish could tell food but poor service overshadowed meal  staff friendly enough but failed provide most obvious necessities  Exhibit A drinks  requested glass soda two but three different staff members  Finally when still no sign drink asked them just bring when food arrives  waiter said could remind that? Umm isn't your JOB remember that? seemed inattentive customers yet spent great deal time arranging silverware tables weren't even occupied  focusing attention warm bodies sitting now?  Exhibit B bill  point pretty annoyed obviously no mood leave big tip  But waiter stands your table credit card machine processes your bill right then there  AWKWARD   To Love sorry taken your special day  Happy effin' birthday  <EOR> Chicken Tika Masala amazing manager very helpful attentive  Love place  <EOR> I getting married Vegas wanted some Indian food catered reception  initial menu tasting Origin India delicious  Saag Paneer Butter Chicken rice naan  really tasty  also loved ambiance place! ended getting lunch dinner catered big day  Everyone absolutely loved food! rave reviews great Indian food was  definitely gonna back eat Origin India when visit Vegas next  None guests disappointed  <EOR> Food exceptionally good!  buffet decent selection loved goat curry tandoori chicken especially   staff prompt friendly  coming back next time Vegas  <EOR> We Vegas lunch 5 14 14  Buffet good  ordered items  Mutton biryani looks sambar rice Chicken Curry tasted worst  authentic Indian restaurant  Dont disappointed going there  <EOR> The service great both times visited food consistent flavorful! sure visit whenever vegas! <EOR> The most horrible terrible experience   I place family lunch buffet buffet over priced $14 99 per person following items buffet   1 veggie soup flavor less watery  2 cheap appetizer   3 Chicken tikka 4  steamed rice 5  lamb curry 6  Fish curry  7  veggie curry no salt veggies uncooked raw  8 lentils flavorless no salt  9 rice pudding   Service very bad middle aged waiter attitude problem   The decor good looked expensive therefore seemed want feed customers garbage expensive rate decor cost    For kind money charge could better meal casinos   The very thought place enrages family because spent nearly $100 crap   Will never ever place owners place <EOR> Amazing  loved it  Joseph bartender mixologist made amazing cocktails he artist alcohol  food great service  <EOR> Love place  skeptic first but trying if your trying Indian first time great start   The black pepper chicken perfect now 2 3 times week <EOR> Some little part life wants dedicated eating best indian meal is  eat lot cook lot love lot   So far Vegas big disappointment indian food  Gaylord's wasn't great nor Tamba  Origin India however everything hoped for    For appetizers  Bhajia girlfriend Aloo Mattar Tikki  first time long time ordered better appetizers  huge bhajia fan but done perfectly  Aloo Matter Tikki also delicious presentation both dishes also great   For mains  deciding between Paneer Shashlik Paneer Shabnam $15 manager recommended Shabnam  girlfriend ordered Chana Masala $13  Both dishes came rice naan small daal which didn't realise seems great value money  Since hadn't realised also ordered daal palak accompaniment   The Paneer Shabnam absolutely delicious texture paneer also perfect  girlfriend's Chana Masala until now best most well rounded Chana Masala ever tasted  Then top dark daal came meal called Dal Bukhara perfect extremely dark tasting  manager asked everything said daal best daals ever tasted then 5 minutes later he brings another house    The naans also cooked perfection crispy underside very soft air bread top   The only small dissappointment Palak Daal Mango Lassi  Palak Daal vinegary tasting couldn't through it   mango lassi more mango smoothie Lassi but still tasted good taste might swayed lassi being served cocktail glass which seemed strange   Lastly inside very very nicely decorated service extremely attentive    All all best Indian eaten Vegas third best Indian restaurant ever too  Passe thru Indian Malaysia #1 East Z East Manchester England #2    Highly recommended  <EOR> My favorite restaurants Las Vegas  Tried 7 other India places area don't compare  only thing curry slightly different each time depending cook keep changing portion sizes  <EOR> Great food Exclnt  service  seem now hooked chicken garlic naan  back  <EOR> If your looking Indian food flair spot! decor beautiful plush service excellent background music soothing food   Delicious!  ordered tasting menu which gives u variety meats veggie dishes curries etc  also comes gorgeous naan basket traditional accompaniments   The price little high but well worth it! <EOR> This place great!
