The service great! friendliest waiter food excellent definitely going back! <EOR> As driving around looking something eat around Summerlin area stumbled finding place  yelped check if good amount stars read some reviews  why give try myself?   I came New Years Day pretty busy but seats available glad no wait because place itself very small  workers didn't seem friendly because running around everywhere plus took 15 minutes someone acknowledge us  Finally seated handed menu  did notice prices prices little more expensive then most small Chinese restaurants   Everything menu looked good but thing caught eyes Seafood Hot Sour soup  haven't seen hot sour soup seafood any other place gone to  soup good but really spicy  love spicy food but while mouth just started burning  if you're spicy fan would highly recommend trying it  Salt Pepper Shrimp sounded good decided give shot  lot shrimp shrimp loaded flavor  If want rice sure tell server  <EOR> This second visit  thing found serve lunch until 4 might good way try without spending lot $  <EOR> Great tasting food great value lunch special $5 95 can't beat   dined Chicken hot garlic sauce Pork garlic sauce   Both fantastic came piping hot just wok!  portion enough two meals did doggy bagged take home   Place clean service prompt friendly   back many times  <EOR> In many respects China Tango your typical neighborhood Chinese American restaurant take out dine menu immediately recognizable all staples    What sets place apart everywhere else especially Panda Express staff quality food exceptional lunch menu    Every employee encountered absolutely wonderful takes great pride service appearance attitude  last visit seated behind very typical  Summerlin family teenage twit  felt job sure everything 5 star quality mean chicken isn't free range? Why don't serve Bling water? never once did waitress lose let level service rest full section drop    I'm sure is perhaps combination smell ingredients higher quality most neighborhood eateries but food simply amazing  5 times now every dish delicious perfectly cooked  personal favorite mu shu pork wife huge fan volcano shrimp I disagree other comments soup great So long story short if live area definitely check place out! would say even worth drive if live further out  <EOR> Great location Summerlin Albertson shopping center  Prompt seating service food  prompt felt rushed  why rated 4 5  Food great  Very fresh! Venue clean  did lack condiments though  Great lunch specials $6 $7 soup rice entry  Free fried noodles sweet sour dip upon seating  Free fortune cookie  would definitely return  <EOR> Last night 3rd time gets better each time  Lemon Chicken superb CT become favorite  <EOR> First curious note   restaurant seems refrigerate its dishes hot tea served icy teapots promptly rendered tea insipid   Delicious hot spring rolls cooled off immediately   Very odd   My wife vouches excellent entrees can't   wait staff chaotic could only watch eat while ran crashing around restaurant   flagged them down repeatedly but amid frenzied prepping to go orders serving other table guests never order out  I cancelled order when she'd finished meal left   much hilarious wringing hands over cancellation but simply could wait longer   We hope staff gets adequate rest stops mimicking Keystone Kops  If restaurant ever organizes itself likely winner  <EOR> On whim tried place  Singapore rice noodles overall pretty good  Food came fast  Can't speak staff take out  again  lot food money <EOR> Ordered favorites go sizzling rice soup egg foo yung   Neither tasted good remembered   Soup bland egg foo yung missing bean sprouts   When called told new owner food changed little   bad   favorite Chinese restaurant   No longer  <EOR> Decent Americanized Chinese but Rude Service live very close only Chinese places area stopped eat takeout couple times so so results  dining food usually pretty good but service extremely casual slow major language barrier English first language any employees  Takeout pretty much same  last two times ordered delivery such poor experience never patronize establishment again   The first delivery food arrived quickly but forgot white rice comes dishes  called said would take least 45 minutes rice bear mind literally live 3 minutes restaurant talking WHITE RICE which scoop already made giant vat asked if would prefer credit order use next time  said OK since didn't want wait figured would easier own rice  asked if needed anything credit she said no would system   The next time called asked credit no record and did honor it even though able pull name address info phone number  Ok whatever hungry ordered anyway  food took forever arrive probably over hour  food quite dry fairly cold but expectations delivery never very high  then pulled Hot Sour Soup find actually Wonton Soup  disappointed figured least would good and care Wonton Soup called tell them  first incredibly rude woman said SURE  ordered? said Yes course  never ordered Wonton Soup life  Then she says snarky tone Well  why always read orders back sure correct  said Well husband spoke but heard order Hot Sour he says DID repeat Hot Sour back him  last time ordered also made mistake and    she then cuts off Well see your fault then your husband if happened twice cannot take responsibility that! Obviously point getting heated say No! forgot white rice last time  There's no way  fault  bickering several minutes until finally say saying you're going take responsibility this? she responds No am going take responsibility  say fine never order again  she actually replies Fine  then both hang up!
