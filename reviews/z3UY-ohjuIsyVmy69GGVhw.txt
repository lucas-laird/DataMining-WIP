When duck landed table huge platter  could easily shared dish wife considering 24 bucks would come pretty well    The duck perfectly roasted pieces skin crispy Delicious  platter comes white fluffy rolls almost taste underdone but guess  Chinese bakery thing  Hoisin sauce super rich dark creamy used very sparingly duck  sauce most likely some MSG but good luck finding awesome Asian sauce doesn't    All all great Chinese restaurant reasonably priced Vegas casino  <EOR>
