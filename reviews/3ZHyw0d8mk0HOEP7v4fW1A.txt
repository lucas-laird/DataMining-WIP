As Shrimp Pad See Ew  Ironically ew part real  moved dish closer plate smell distinct odor raw shrimp  wasnt cooked all way enough  first thought imagining but once started eating all could taste something close raw shrimp verge spoiling  wife same reaction  point requested another order Pad See Ew but beef instead  new plate because odor lingering it  5 minutes receive new dish  soon took bite faintly taste same thing just last dish  point thinking maybe cooked food same wok washing it? Why else would raw shrimp taste still there?  By point wifey just ended finishing Pineapple Fried Rice Fried Tofu  ended boxing Pad See Ew  Why don't know  Maybe try again later see if just us? Umm    nope still tasted nasty  know guys thinking  Send back? Take off bill? No type people keep complaining especially if gave second chance already   This does take away service which good  server refills redoing second order etc   In closing don't think coming back any time soon  Maybe just caught them off night  Hopefully next visit if better update review accordingly   Yelp 2015 review #5 Lets Krung?
