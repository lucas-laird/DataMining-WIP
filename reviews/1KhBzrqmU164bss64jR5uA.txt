Well if gave everything away free that'd nice but then RRRSBBQ wouldn't exist anymore  <EOR> Omg reading reviews surprised no complained price! really thought Chumlee needed bail money again! 2 Sandwiches 2 sides 2 sodas $40 bucks!!!! thought being robbed since cashier didn't even ring order! She said 40 even put money side register! Mediocre Sandwich compared ones buy Scottsdale AZ lot less! place completely empty I should've known! <EOR> Went bunch co workers   15 all together   usually Memphis Championship BBQ   Nobody impressed   Most disappointed     Burnt ends = Excellent!  Baby back ribs = Tough chewy  would take Chili's TGI Fridays Tony Roma's any day over these   Pulled pork = Co worker said spicy even no sauce her  Would even eat it   Mac cheese = Co worker said tons pepper it   Would even eat it    Spicy sausage = sausage dried tough cooked hours ago    Loaded mashed potatoes = Sorry ran out  Loaded baked potato = Sorry ran out  Cornbread = OK   Collard greens = OK   Prices high get   Portions small very small    Sorry Rick love guys     but think we're going stick Memphis Championship BBQ  <EOR> So many different takes bbq amazing brisket ribs chicken hotlink pork loin pig shanks pork belly meatloaf  tried redneck nacho which version Frito pie addition your choice meat beans cheese some mamas sweet sauce sour cream covered fresh spring onions  Another plate ordered bbq tacos potato salad pork grinds house rub  way bar most breweries seen tap while  if don't might tall your favorite brew  All all would definitely give them two thumbs up  <EOR> We love trying new restaurants whenever Vegas mood some BBQ  Rollin' Smoke nearby decided try out   I say before walking thought would touristy BBQ joint  shares parking lot Pawn Stars shop building looks little hipster    We greeted guy behind counter commenting t shirt  He began talking basketball he seemed genuinely enjoy job   Looking menu could see place knew brisket  options chopped sliced burnt ends  half sliced half chopped  worker grabbed full slab meat cut front us   The sauces included sweet sauce which tastes better sounds  Unlike other sweet sauces isn't syrupy cloyingly sweet  Then there's Arkansauce which truly unique perfectly concocting pepper tomato meat sauces one   The chopped brisket flavorful moist didn't even need sauce all  But if choose recommend sweet sauce  runs over nicely only adds amazing quality meat    The sliced brisket almost good  less fatty but you'd never guess easily your teeth slice through it  Both meat options reminiscent genuine Texas brisket every way   My only gripe price  $16 per 1 2 lb brisket  so $32 per pound   little steep  realize Vegas meat fantastic but think charging pound would smarter  maybe $25 per pound  those don't eat lot BBQ $16 per half pound doesn't seem much but very far above average  If combo $20 comes side drink  sides usually $4 la carte  so basically drink free   For sides highly recommend mac cheese  baked sweet potato which extra $2 really worth it    Each meal also comes slice Texas toast smartly placed underneath meat gets nice soggy trust amazing    I definitely back but perhaps only order meat itself larger portion side share instead both getting meal I don't drink soda     It's great Vegas quality BBQ spot locals some brisket cooked right way  <EOR> Rick's just good say is     Good honest BBQ plenty savory sides   Service quick   sides skinny side but tasty     Take your meal upstairs enjoy dozen micro brews     sure call but order draft beer rib slider all hooked together fancy drink  <EOR> Great BBQ place  highly recommend coming weekend paying $40 unlimited meat PBR   price pretty pricey if you're going meal side beer might well unlimited package!  The only negative sometimes take while your beer because insist bringing you   Also important note locals 20% off! prices lot more reasonable IMO  <EOR> I came back Ricks Rollin Smoke BBQ Las Vegas Blvd  quickly becoming favorite BBQ place Las Vegas  ordered trio meats chose Burnt ends pulled pork chicken ribs  sides Mac cheese Cajun coleslaw  OMFG MEAT DA BOMB!!!!! definitely taste smell smoke  Love that  If going smoke meat then smoke hell did freaking good  tender flavorful  Then dip into yellow chesse goodness just divine  cried ate it  LOVE MAC N CHEESE!!! Seriously eat place  insanely good  <EOR> Nothing disappointment dinner!  Surprised see all 5 star reviews   Hmm?!?  I talked into getting special 2 meats 1 slice white bread 1 side souvenir cup drink $20 discount if you're local   I shocked see meat given literally 4 pieces thinly sliced hot links 3 pieces thinly sliced beef brisket smaller normal size side small souvenir soda cup which nothing but cheapy thin plastic cup    Waaay OVER priced quantity food top off quality subpar lacking    The bbq sauce runny bland  brisket dry flavorless  hot links nothing but hot   that literally all taste overpowering heat!

Ok maybe shouldnt qualify but hay making rain does hungry hoppin over RS should no brainer    Sorry stray off main subject guy tend easily distracted strip clubs tend them  Unlike original location new place does serve beef ribs moment  beef ribs mainly number reason RS because havnt anything them anywhere  limited menu  prices seem marked well but should expected since technically strip still    What ended getting 2 meat combo $19 99 which comes side drink  Your meat choices pulled pork beef hot links chopped brisket smoked chicken st louis ribs  Your side choices bbq baked beans cole slaw mashed potatos mac n cheese  chose chopped brisket st louis ribs  usual both meats point  brisket little bit greasy time around but still good  ribs tender fall off bone smoke flavored goodness!

But food just me  Between myself 4 friends everything seemed similar kick   spice really made everything hot literally all food Mac cheese mashed potatoes ribs sandwiches even salad all mouthes burning! Through spice could taste good food but right when stared enjoy bite took your mouth assaulted another punch spice  Also felt menu very repetitive know BBQ place but felt your only option some kind pork BBQ sauce super corny typical BBQ food  would love seen some different types food done BBQ style new concoctions made random types food  don't know maybe crazy never knew just don't BBQ food  way atmosphere really fun people work really really awesome but between myself friends none liked food definitely wouldn't recommend it  Maybe come drinks good hangout spot but skip food very very clear don't want anything any kind spice see if anything off menu  overdone traditional BBQ  <EOR> watching 'Pawn Stars' every week last year  learning history behind items people bring into pawnshop  actually pawned ring once woman sent while 'Jerry Springer ' really gaudy  Steve Wilkos  Personally kinda wish could pawn flavor left taste buds   Let start off saying food original location Rollin Smoke BBQ pretty special  would think food location would just special   My younger daughter here's surprise she wanted eat mac n cheese  wife took bite mac n cheese  side dish cost $8 00 she wife said tasted came can  daughter age seven impressed well    My older daughter age nine choose eat cheeseburger  portion size fine but she favorable taste  took bite thought taking bite meatloaf sandwich    Myself ordered BBQ Taco $12 00  meal came side dish cole slaw  also ordered some baked beans  liked side dishes more liked tacos   Service nice establishment inside very clean  Then again only 11 30am   Located brand new shopping area right next shop made famous television show Pawn Stars    I love food other location but Rick's name something missing  wife agree didn't bang buck  feel payed name along location much food  <EOR> This place amazing! pulled pork must try sauces best land  Located right next pawn stars  <EOR> 2 stars solid BBQ joint glaring problem   After checking famous Gold Silver Pawn Shop television show Pawn Stars headed next door BBQ shop owned show's star Rick  joint called Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ Tavern 2 story venue looked take area bottom level bar outdoor area top level  venue's style BBQ joint well executed made Kansas City boy feel he back Midwest   We sat down table bartender came over say hello bring menus  She also let know Rick himself would bartending tonight free stick around see come back see would sure able drink him  appreciated she very friendly overall provided good service    After looking over rather extensive menu including good sized beer list wife decided couple beers some sliders  While dinner reservations kept ordering more both beers sliders received rather solid  venue service food all corresponded venue's 4 star status    What unfortunate while venue's food experience merit 4 star reviews and would gotten takes extremely inappropriate step manipulating its rating  does little sign table listed picture below offering free PBR mystery shot exchange being willing Yelp out  Since sign instructed ask server details asked server she told would only receive free drinks exchange good review! SERIOUS?! absolutely despicable policy hurts Yelp posting inauthentic reviews insults Yelpers look provide honest input venue itself because less likely receive constructive criticism would help improve  thing encourage people write review drink a little shady its own right since people would most likely avoid criticizing venue since could jeopardize receiving free drink but outweighed benefit getting people write reviews but offering free drinks review requiring reviews good crosses line  saddest part venue would almost assuredly good reviews repeat business based its merits but policy harmful insulting refuse back location recommend everyone avoid until policy eliminated very least reworked remove positive review requirement  While official policy may involve positive review requirement servers would need instructed isn't requirement sign updated reflect content review wouldn't impact receiving drink   Overall Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ Tavern solid BBQ location great atmosphere menu full good options  Unfortunately abhorrent Yelp policy place must avoid any self respecting Yelper  <EOR> Boooooo!
