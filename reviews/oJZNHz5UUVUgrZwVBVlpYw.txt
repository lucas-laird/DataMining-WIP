A good girlfriend if mine hosted tea party Sunday August 3 2014 approximately twelve guest!  The seating bit awkward perhaps because small tables such large party!  Larger parties if seven more pick choice tea chef pics your sandwiches    The ambiance nice definitely worth experience    I admit $35 per person plus 18% gratuity $45 restaurant dinner Tea Party over  guess say use English sandwiches although delish!  Overall venue success!! <EOR> We proceeded Bellagio specifically because I'd wanted try caviar Petrossian  wanted try last time but couldn't because lil guy wasn't allowed since served bar  managed find daycare while ran off sample 'black salt' as hubby calls it    We opened 12pm settled into comfy seats  both ordered Perrier $4 50 faced sour faced server  WTF?? We're paying customers regardless order  However when ordered 30g Alverta caviar $185 hubby shot Christiania vodka $10 same server's entire demeanor changed  Fucking hell  mean seriously  Just because weren't dressed nicely doesn't mean vagrants  Give break   Well kind disappointed caviar  $185 30g I'd expected far better quality got  tried many types caviar before really preferred Osetra caviar Alverta but dammit wasn't going pay $350 30g it  Screw that  serve caviar 'bread basket' toast triangles baby blinis but problem warm blinis served together toast created steam which meant toast soggy when reached us  Also carb caviar ratio ridiculous  enough toast blini 500g caviar   Still great hubby finally changed thoughts caviar  caviar Petrossian starts $145 tops over $1000  Maybe day feel generous enough plop down $300+ 30g caviar whim but day isn't going any time soon   1 star off two faced server  <EOR> Very much enjoyed cavier sampler cachuterie before wedding!
