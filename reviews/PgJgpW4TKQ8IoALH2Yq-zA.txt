Luke warm mediocre food best   Caesars buffet actually good  <EOR> Went dinner  Terrible doesn't begin describe it  food sitting HOURS   but even if hadn't still would terrible  demanded money back  Think Old Country Buffet but worse  kidding  <EOR> Best place ever! Thank u Bayside Buffet! dessert bar amazing fancy yet delicious  Pretty good variety delicious foods buffet place  Although some employees understandable while conversing they're very friendly help whenever can  <EOR> Seating really tight   much room booth 4 people   I thought place overall chemical kind smell it    It difficult food back area onto plate without making mess everywhere  whole process awkward  Would better if could both sides food instead only one    Food okay  But found hair pizza  sanitary!  Service good though!   Will returning here  <EOR> VERY disappointed! don't usually reviews but wish someone warned me  Almost ALL food tasted same also generic overcooked stale canned eckk variety extremely limited price getting attention waiter challenge  We dined several hotel buffets during various visits Vegas particular still least desired! thought would give them another chance last weekend but shame  really need total revamp spot  such nice hotel but whoever charge restaurant needs grip far most disappointing tastless awful food entire trip  The only reason single star because overburdened waiter cover 8 tables himself really tried friendly  Do waste your time money deserve more refund! <EOR> Really disappointment   given tickets Michael Jackson decided day going buffet prior show   Mandalay Bay premier strip casinos looking forward buffet   Mandalay Bay should great!  terrible   much selection food luke warm old food mixed fresh disguise it   giving 2 stars because setting nice although weren't given table back windows overlooking garden   If want best buffets town largest freshest M Resort Casino  <EOR> The food selection decent taste food good enough complain but nothing write home about   Examples include only bud beer option best item would breaded shrimp although lot breading breads hard rock   Service real good quick par   Deserts definitely snuff much selection yogurt melts few seconds   Check if area but would trip just this  <EOR> I before ok buffet dinner Vegas  good place when just off plane ready eat   Atmosphere really good thing Vegas hoping  little more atmosphere price  <EOR> What time alive!?

<EOR> Terrible terrible buffet  would think Mandalay Bay would turn place knotch considering prices actual hotel but nope  very much food choose from  All food messy unappealing  Everything tasted came box cabinet home freezer  Usually when come buffets am immediately rushing towards dessert section  area buffet honestly dissapointing  Nothing bought little mini dry cakes some cookies ice cream bar   Step Mandalay please  <EOR> I thoroughly unimpressed Bayside Buffet   The buffet rather small poorly laid making difficult navigate bumping into people all time   The food selection severely lacking lots Asian Stir fry very little anything else  Basic salad bar didn't even shredded cheese croutons   What did poor quality 12 00 noon height lunch hour most foods lukewarm best   The service ok but guess didn't really ask lot   I hungry hour later MUCH better meal burger fries poolside Beach Bar Grill   As buffets on par Excalibur slightly better setting  Aria much better terms atmosphere selection overall food quality  <EOR> The food good all  Don't try Japanese Maki Sushi !!!

The staff encountered frantic though helpful when needed them beverages  Other chaotic feeling getting we large group reserved advance sure craziness about   perhaps because everyone hungover arriving different times    no heavy complaints    I'm just into smorgasbords food upon food upon food       but crab legs pancakes! <EOR> This buffet place some great food! very diverse terms choice tasty unlike some other buffet places  really appreciated omelets other egg based foods made order instead being premade some other places   I bit disappointed desserts  very tasty could some more fruit options instead just pineapple cantaloupe slices    The service nice however seemed bit rushed taking away plates second finished even though buffet full  But still very nice amicable    All all great place lunch day going Las Vegas! <EOR> Mediocre food price bread area dessert area bugs flying around food food  top off bird flying around wait staff did care  Overpriced cafeteria food recommend all  <EOR> If you're looking great seafood buffet look no further! Best buffet LV hands down  friends lost count many plates crab legs ate lol  Crab legs prime rib great say least  Didn't give 5 stars because its still buffet all  <EOR> Like other recent review another spot Mandalay Bay hotel   this very average and expensive breakfast brunch lunch buffet spot but extensive selection food dessert items choose from   I chose made to order omelette side bacon   chef prepared egg dish planned but came kind runny not fully unexpected given number dishes he making simultaneously    bacon crisp but more chewy side sitting around some amount time   I did sample few desserts while looked good flavors bland side a chocolate chip cookie piece oreo cheesecake    I've gotta believe much better alternatives within reasonable walking distance don't cost nearly much   but convenience quantity place could certainly fit bill  <EOR> I Vegas wedding rehearsal dinner night before Bayside   didn't actually rehearse anything but didn't stop stuffing faces!  The layout neat never feel huge crowded buffet but mazelike can't find your way around   I actually skipped salad which first straight crab legs   bit difficult eat no tools all but tasty overcooked horrible expected   All all decent buffet hear pay once eat all day deal going if want stick around Mandalay all day  <EOR> My friends decided whim sure did good job disappointing    There poor selection food quality food wasn't good all  think filled seaweed salad smoked salmon day  desserts joke  they just looked something brother made and no  necessarily good thing     Do yourself favor save your money someplace else  <EOR> This buffet awful  Small tell quality crap  did Cesar's buffet earlier week fantastic  pay for  <EOR> Eh buffet alright  ate three times redeem couple free meals included stay weekday breakfast $19 99 weekday lunch $29 99 weekend brunch $25 99    I felt general cooked seasoned meats pretty well but unfortunately found many vegetables some starches overly salty  Both lunch breakfast selection pretty extensive although thought options breakfast tasted better overall  normally super light breakfast eater since least favorite meal day but liked variety here  your typical American breakfast fare addition Mexican selection  enjoyed French Toast sticks Chilaquiles addicted crispy tater tots! During brunch even offered quite few meats turkey steak salmon kielbasa    As lunch expectations may high but bit disappointed  Again all fine meats highlight lamb Osso Buco  Sadly didn't find anything else special among American Italian Asian selection  There's station where they'll cook custom made to order pasta but serve HUGE servings sure request just small plate if want sample all other offerings  During breakfast cook fresh omelettes instead  dessert counter various cookies simple cakes other sweet bites  heard sticky buns amazing must try!   For most part during all three meals service consistently good friendly  received drinks quickly staff constantly came clearing empty plates  buffet appeared clean well kept overall but unless given another free meal would choose dine different buffet hopes better food quality  <EOR> This buffet   in land buffets    is pretty standard  Hubby able walk seated fairly quickly dinner  dishes weren't bad   but nothing really stuck either  carved station featured both prime rib turkey  prime rib bit overdone tastes   but didn't bad flavor  turkey pretty good hubby really loves turkey  He deprived turkey kid Thanksgiving other holidays   as family doesn't he ga ga turkey did king crab legs well snow crab   I course king crab he surprised snow crab  king crab legs kind mushy   and just very flavorful   kind bummer me  He busy cracking away snow crab   and offered bite it  Wow   stand evening! shamelessly ditched sad tasteless plate king crab legs   and bee lined snow crab  sweet flavorful   really melt your mouth goodness shell  indulging more snow crab probably should perused dessert section  offered ton items including sugar free items   sadly nothing remarkable   Service kind miss night  first hubby ordered pineapple juice water   he water     and took 3 times asking pineapple juice before finally arrived  sat empty water soda while   but noticed poor server party hell    20 top     with 15 kids definitely cut major slack once refills pineapple juice service kind picked up   plates removed promptly enough given circumstance  All all just a ok only few dishes being good great rest kind     in middle  don't think would return buffet only because vast amount food Vegas   but cheap eats nice time guy  <EOR> Went Bayside Buffet celebratory lunch yesterday been over year since last visit left disappointed!

Hands down worst buffet Vegas  anything tasted decent  Most food dry over cooked bland  Service crap too  silverware ourselves  first waitress only drinks half table  bus own plates  third waitress asked four times if fianc wanted another Coke but she never actually brought it  only thing experience worse if food poisoning  <EOR> I staying THEhotel Mandalay Bay parents lunch Bayside Buffet   This buffet lacking lot things  Very limited selection  steak while looking cooked nicely rare tough  trying think did like   Yeah wasn't whole lot like  didn't sick  good   Oh funny story  brother raspberry iced tea  normal amount ice begin with  When waiter came refill drink he added bunch ice  brother started laughing little  He finished he did while waiting another refill joked next refill would fill glass entirely ice  Well exact scenario happened  lost sh*t laughing  <EOR> We came day pool before concert  Everyone encountered very friendly welcoming professional  waiter Todd phenomenal constantly checked other tales assigned him   food assortment pretty good  jumbo fried shrimp very good stone crabs claws  seating area nice good vibe  would come back similar situation  <EOR> Meh  love L V Buffets but just meh  Chinese food offerings all stale tough sitting way long steam table  Ditto pizza enchiladas hot dishes  carved prime rib better typical L V buffets however  crab legs huge plentiful  dessert table very weak relative L V Buffet standards  If part hotel package course eat hearty  If serious good buffet experience cab Wicked Spoon Cosmopolitan Wynn  Worth trip fare effort  <EOR> came wedding decided eat here! food amazing! lina amazing! felt home! she above beyond customer service!!  highly recommend place definitely come back again <EOR> It decent buffet but nothing spectacular   very nice no hour long wait line place any time   Your options span basics   italian asian american mexican dining options   don't serve any breakfast items 12pm which really sucks   prime rib ok   carnitas pretty good   enjoyed fresh fruit yogurt   very good dessert spread but didn't try anything can't comment good any tasted  <EOR> This very poor excuse Vegas Buffet  food mediocre  service average 8 30pm pretty much stop putting fresh food most desserts gone  Save your money anywhere else eat  Including tip over $40 per person  Last time ever waste money here  <EOR> Please don't eat here!!! Las Vegas first time stayed Mandalay Bay happened try buffet      surprised lame buffet     ordinary Chinese buffet sorry saying but really disappointed  Seriously don't eat same price best buffet Cosmopolitan  <EOR> For $34 99 can't believe low quality food here  better food higher quality your average generic Chinese buffets 1 3 price  dessert looks come straight your neighborhood Walmart    Checking yelp before came expecting much  But worse worst  place should closed long ago  don't understand still remains open  <EOR> Very disappointed selection quality food  Can't believe charge $35 person when Chinese buffet pay less more variety well quality   yourself solid walk buffet before paying  Dont believe hype  <EOR> I visited location few days ago June 7th because staying Delano  am very loyal MGM brand usually only stay Signature when travel Vegas  experience sadly say far worst experience ever Food Beverage establishment    I seated immediately arriving immediately food  received drinks moment forward server did stop table once  2 small table once finished first plate placed them side  grabbed some finger foods meantime since drinks  plates didn't picked over 20 mins server assisting other tables but just ignoring ours  He looked table which thought indication he saw everything never came back  manager walked table picked plates  finished plate finger food walked over host informed situation  said would send over server he again never came  15 mins waiting server come asked left  most frustrating part all fact other tables being assisted ours wasn't    I spoke manager time waited manager plates drink cups remained untouched  well over hour point  manager said she would refund buffets 1 paid 1 comp   showed room charge paid refunded but according MLife desk couldn't comp back  very upsetting but oh well do? ended going different buffet much better experience  night day!   I returning stay Delano again  But honestly am unsure whether returning buffet experience  most likely take time walk different property eat buffets avoid another experience one  <EOR> Lunch buffet impressive  Carved meats Turkey sausage  Deserts cookies soft serve mousse  Seafood consisted peeled shrimp salmon filet mussels  Harrahs better this  great variety  return  <EOR> Went twice breakfast  huge variety quite tasty!  Almost all buffets bland boring food since mass produce dishes   delicious!  Highly recommend! <EOR> Had dinner tonight   $26 99   nice buffet nice dining room view pool area   Everything tried good but nothing just stood absolutely great     They both hot crab legs that crack yourself cold ones already cut half   Many other dishes choose well   deserts very good      I noticed close buffet down between lunch dinner times can't come little early pay lunch price dinner offerings     I'd certainly back if area but think liked Bellagio buffet little better  <EOR> The WORST buffet ever Vegas! Spare yourself money ANYWHERE else! tried many things all awful! Should asked money back but help save yours  PASS place! <EOR> Food okay nothing special dessert area good all super basic cheap tasting cakes ice cream money charged worth it  Customer service good  Some employees texting while assigned into food station instead greeting customers clean station      Food counter dirty should maintain food presentation because just regular $12 per person restaurant  Well atleast waiter friendly  All all going back  <EOR> Not biggest buffet ever but good deal seafood pretty tasty  solid 3 star which would 4 if price little lower $26 $20 if Shark exhibit which did !  Check but if there's line don't feel bad if keep walking  <EOR> We able find plenty things tasted good  staff also very friendly accommodating  only thing would if take long picking your food while leaving your table unattended might find other people sitting your table  <EOR> My friend made promise could least buffet while Vegas    Buffets aren't really thing but decent    Food pretty good thought pretty cool tamales    It wasn't overcrowded but Saturday night would think should more then cashier    I tried few things didn't but  just taste buds  Except rolls those rock hard    Our server nice helpful when questions  <EOR> Prime Rib? Check!  Alaskan King Crab Legs? Check!  Pizza? Check!  Salad bar? Check!  This not so impressive buffet Mandalay Bay  picked because thought otherwise  Everything else Mandalay Bay great thought bad could be? While wasn't horrible just wasn't memorable  Most offerings standard buffet fare  understandable because sort buffets need accessible all people     The highlight dessert offering  tiny lemon meringue pies chocolate chip cookies macaroons bread pudding soft serve ice cream etc  even least two sugar free cake offerings    In end money's worth which buffet nature designed do  <EOR> Great food!  Nice variety choices! <EOR> A little bit better most buffets Vegas due fact a never busy b seem fresher food other buffets  those buffets where sure if casino hungry then yes might well eat there  But don't any special arrangements would quite upset  <EOR> It's decent buffet but lacks wow factor when comes presentation varieties foods offered   Quality prime roast good many other Vegas buffets decent selection Asian dishes  <EOR> Bayside Buffet's food seems better since recent remodel  wouldn't given them more three stars if couple years ago but definitely stepped things apparent attempt live flash those colored lights automated kiosks front  eggs omelets very well meat selection good  Lots crab legs  Desserts hidden far side dining room but worth walk  most buffets Las Vegas occasionally leave foods long continue cook trays hard don't enough heat cold  juggling act staff   dining room tropical nicely decorated   Bayside far better wretched MGM Grand buffet within MGM family par offerings Mirage Treasure Island notch two below Bellagio  <EOR> Much ANY BUFFET going positives negatives self  pay kiosks service excellent  did  care much prime rib thought tuff but crab legs sushi shrimp mussels made it  Tried several salads also very good  eating years dinner always very good think weekend lunch 27 00 per person bit pricey  <EOR> One best well priced buffet strip  husband may cheap but cannot stomach spend $50+ buffet meal  Bayside food always great wide variety food  would give 5 stars but anticipation upcoming trip saw website unlimited alcoholic beverages now separate cost  doesn't happy however food still good  MyVegas slot rewards buy free free altogether making well worth visit  <EOR> Wasn't best buffet  shimp tasted rubber Chinese food overly salty sushi tasteless   crab legs really small  Nothing king crab other pictures  Only thing good deserts prime rib open bar  Very pricey $30  <EOR> In Nutshell Warm not cold king crab legs! Oxtail $32 99 Adult Dinner price  NO LINE   Overall come those reasons above b c those very hard find any buffet anywhere   other buffets strip more expensive super long lines don't above    ENOUGH SAID now eat  <EOR> Great buffet price  $30 includes wine nice selection salads Italian Asian American type foods  Quality good no complaints any offering  better worst but great value buffet  <EOR> This very pleasant place weekday breakfast lunch 2 separate days   Both times waitresses exceptionally pleasant attentive  Unlike preoccupied parents young children ripped ran through room day visited  Good selections wonderful fruits omelet station apple crepes breakfast  lvoed warm Pecan Syrup!!  I'd recommend if South Strip much better buffet Luxor  <EOR> Weekend breakfast buffet $26 per person while there  okay food definitely overpriced  3 5 food items tasted bland made cheap ingredients  manage ruin something simple scrambled eggs cheese beyond me  fruit fresh  mini waffles French toast sticks tasteful  Service good but probably won't returning eat here  If you're willing take risk it! <EOR> Worst Buffet to   dinner Sunday night  only reason don't give 1 star because food selection good  problem food itself DISGUSTING! Bland way under cooked way over cooked nothing just right even tasted good  desserts sad unless love chocolate  Chocolate cake chocolate raspberry chocolate that  berry tart key lime? chocolate gross   mess chocolate??? cookies however delicious surprisingly enough   super under staffed even when section no longer busy waitress did nothing  Constantly forgetting drink water ask napkins 3 times when table behind asked something she came letting know didn't it   piles plates table them being cleaned up   they're charging should decent food better service  never back recommend anyone  W Wynn  Stay away one  <EOR> I several bones pick place   1 cashier really talked fact free beer wine dinner   Yeah TWO wine choices just beer  2 When did beer which happened Bud Light guy drink station said he didn't limes but should ask server   asked server entire buffet did stock limes   KIND RESTAURANT DOESN'T LIMES??? 3 Mexican food station some taquitos which ended being crunchy but bland    ask chef behind neighboring station if sour cream guacamole   He looked if asked meaning life   He call 2 other chefs over confirm no did guacamole bummer! sour cream likely salad bar  4 asked lady dessert station if she could point toward some desserts without nuts   only ones she pointed sugar free ones   time she plating some type chocolate cake she held piece face said probably doesn't nuts either  then she business   am sick people finding sure just brushing off question  don't ask fun   I ask because literally stop breathing die if eat nuts   They did some killer garlic mashed potatoes going it   Honestly love food am picky but place just good all   Just don't here  <EOR> I don't understand why bad reviews!  ate buffet tonight pretty impressive especially Wednesday night  tend gravitate toward favorites when saw beautiful prime rib huge pile crab legs knew where needed go!  prime rib perfectly cooked really well seasoned   crab legs tasted fresh   Other only really ate dessert   took two cookies two small pieces cake   cakes disappointing    Really dry   cookies good though service great   don't see all fuss over Wynn   prime rib better crab same price twice much Wynn   would definitely come back especially now know coupons there! <EOR> We made few bad buffet choices recent trip Vegas    On last day walked Bayside Buffet hotel Mandalay Bay decided give try  They all eat all day $35 per person The food very delicious refreshing compared other 2 buffets ate earlier week Excalibur Sahara were real crap shoot!!! The crab dinner awesome super fresh   It definitely worth money eat there!!!  The only think would say desserts good buffet MGM Grand  Although ice cream waffle cones great!!! But overall good experience  <EOR> Buffet pretty average  Reasonably priced Vegas brunch however pretty limited selection  Some items heavy handed salt example Brussels sprouts   am sad say Golden Corral runs side side Bayside half price    One positive service 4 stars  <EOR> It's biggest nor does exotic selections some other buffets town but Bayside vote best breakfast buffet Vegas     food always good service attentive never disappointed   The dessert bar hidden far side room sure seek if pastries your breakfast  <EOR> What hate most going buffet? No guilt stuffing food down your face gaining 3 lbs  hour  Really not  Ok maybe fatties but me  hate most waiting line pay cashier into buffet  When buffet you're already starving  last thing want wait half hour or more line while people front decide they're going split bill between everyone groups  Delegate person pay everything god's sake! Decide much each person going pay later! Ugh  Anywho people run buffet smart set self paying kiosks place cashiers  Tap touch screen few times insert money credit card take your receipt show hostess lead your table  Genius! Pure genius!  There's great selection food tender tasty prime rib delectable sweets  But man those kiosks sexy    <EOR> Food service quite good  I would give 5 stars but think its bit overpriced  But don't eat buffets often maybe im wrong  <EOR> Decent buffet price   Priced better then upscale bellagio wynn similar foods   drawback drop quality noticeable  <EOR> Interior pretty clean  pretty buffets wynn but still ok  If sit next windows nice view beach   Exterior inside Mandalay Bay  Pretty nice    Service best all  two people working cashier two lines combined once front  first then? Well common sense wise customers should take turns family left line first then right side then left side  When family's turn though family next rushed front people line annoyed other family did that  When finally cashier woman's attitude best  Won't complain much since dinner service she must tired but still   ? little smile something would ok but all annoyed tone  Water refilled often good  friendliest people chefs    Food price would say worth it  Places wicked spoon buffet wynn charges high price lots food  place charges slightly cheaper price but less amount food  much variety sushi terrible  salmon sushi no crab meat  Only hard rice cucumber  tuna somehow almost dark purple instead red  Other food average  Limited amount desserts too  huge dessert fan say desserts best either    Overall Mandalay Bay nice hotel chef buffet made experience nice  But overall food quality first impression cashier line didn't leave best mark me  <EOR> ***Friday Brunch review*** Warm snow crabs !!!  This first time found WARM SNOW CRABS Vegas!   We love warm crab legs down Biloxi MS always wished find same Vegas   Now did!!!  Food warm snow crabs just made day hence 4 stars    otherwise would given buffet 3 stars   Everything else just OK   Very nice but OK   prime rib very nice but liked Bellagio's better some reason   Apple crepes fried rice all pretty good   However selections very limited   very disappointment eggs benedict   I guess standard practice use hard eggs keep shape but hmm      Price $25 think   We $20 person vouchers sure EXACT price   sorry   Ambiance = Very nice   Typical casino buffet style restaurant strip   Clean nice   nothing special   Service = Umm     ask straw every refill piles plates just left alone long time   think short staffed???    not sure  <EOR> A stinker  know having hard time trusting people's review especially when user's average review rating four five stars several hundred reviews  Does mean majority buisnesses winners? guess gullible   Bayside Buffet prime example why shouldn't eager try place recommended Yelpers  yet Im writing too! Double standards am fail   Anyway bitching aside lunch super meh  20 dollars paid kiosk then briskly seated facing away window wut? then hoarded buffet line both sides room  Immediately nagging feeling experience would super meh  How?

Meats few starches but mainly stuff jammed protein   Lambchops Ugh  Below super meh  lamb gamey foul tasting instant spit out of the mouth and eat somethingelse to purge the mouth type thang  Minus points  Pork ribs Wow surprisingly soft but lacked flavor  best entree buffet  Turkey Eh thanksgiving turkey cut your choice dark white meat  carver very nice but meat quality very poor  Braised beef better soft else leaving! Fortunately beef soft though weird aftertaste soured mouth  Flank steak Worst meat  couldn't steak down mouth because texture way chewy  CHEWY  Inedible  Even beef jerky softer flank steak  Mash potatoes Wait yelpers crap? Buttery? Yummy? Uh    give up    Dessert Forget banana pudding fruit pudding cakes brownies best dessert frozen yogurt  YES  Better McDonalds frozen yogurt barometer tasty creamy consistent goodness  vanilla custard yogurt far best part meal        and saddest part experience  Deserts over meats entrees? Bayside Buffet fail    And oh your service sucks  <EOR> Worst 35 dollars ever spent  Poor selection  Poor food  Taste awful  Eating samples Costco would more enjoyable  <EOR> I've always liked coming buffet whenever Vegas   Heck even gone myself during business trip   favorite dish have prime rib   always 2 3 slices prime rib   Plus aren't stingy giving cuts either   also tamale beef whenever it   also shrimp cocktail crab legs any seafood enthusiasts cravings fulfilled   price relatively low compared other hotel buffets  <EOR> I would've given 5 stars if crab legs weren't dry hell! buffet in laws California   Personally better crab legs Santa Fe buffet additional $7 99!! much fresher juicier there!! grew massive lake side ocean other  know seafood if you're going pay seafood shouldn't dry hell!! <EOR> Awesome  pricey food good  Grab legs all way rubbery  Takes forever grab meat out  Decent Vegas Buffet  <EOR> Not large selection   Chef would omelette 1130am time pasta even though he zero pasta customers  Wont come again <EOR> Great buffet excellent choices  did open until 7 am but well worth wait breakfast    Every breakfast food could think including but limited to   eggs Benedict waffles pancakes salmon desserts sausage gravy omelettes order turkey pork chops sald bar fruit list on     forever   The cost $18 99 however normal sized meal another restaurant site Mandalay may another 10 15 dollars more plate  Well worth price  <EOR> Plain simple    Denny's IHOP blows water being nice   wouldn't eat again <EOR> My husband ate before Cirque show Mandalay Bay   hesitant when read some comments but pleasantly surprised   able Buffett free myVEGAS app which bonus   also took advantage all drink beer wine 10 98 per person   crab legs weren't best selection isn't seen other casinos but very tasty   enjoyed Asian fare while husband Prime rib lamb   top off staff very friendly well! <EOR> Used great  Just ate again disappointed  place still beautiful look but food underwhelming exception dessert   sushi horrid but understandable women sushi station speaking Spanish each other   cheese cubes even fairly bland   Mandalay Bay beautiful resort favorites but bad representation dining options     On way back home stopped Primm ate Primm Valley's buffet much better Mandalay's   just sad   Actually Sizzler Hometown Buffet better   gladly stay Mandalay Bay Four Seasons but Mirage buffet  <EOR> Food ok  am fan Buffets but when Rome    service fine  restaurant appeared clean  would maybe back breakfast   recommended vegetarians most dishes even beans meat it  <EOR> WHAT HAPPENS BUFFET STAYS STOMACH!

I breakfast 2014 left very favorable impression mind  excited last meal buffet during recent visit  sorely disappointed both service food   The service Did check often  Did refill juice even when asked!   Seemed only come table clear when back seconds thirds    The food sad sad sad    unable cut through pancakes knife  very rubbery  huge disappointment  Omelet bar good but less options remembered  couldn't cut steak butter knife finally flagged down server told steak knifes    I feel money's worth sad chose last meal trip  would said something manager duty but he eating walking around    <EOR> A little spendy decent selection buffet style foods  gentleman carving station prime rib obviously mastered art deli thin slices  Steamed snow crab legs good but partial pre cuts drove lot shell into meat few pieces  Service attentive kept ice teas full table  Nice variety desserts  very conveniently set up  ramekins au jus opposite side carving station  steak knives meat dishes close meat stations  Watching people right now grabbing food then searching condiments utensils  <EOR> Ill honest   I wanted breakfast   But planned brunch noon noon apparently its breakfast all day kind buffet    just bad say though because three mimosas would tasted much better do it myself omelet waffle bar   good regardless but delicious bacon wrapped pork fried shrimp just didn't belly wanted happen   wanted magic   wanted taste explosions   wanted stomach thank personally   But all happened full belly $20 never back some wasted food multiple plates some nasty gas   Three stars each mimosas  <EOR> Yuck   We directed someone strip since best seafood buffet around   even close   As walk pay kiosk instead person   request tip point which thought strange but whatever   walked counter give ticket rude hostess stated needed take myself over there  Ummm    okay?  hostess sat pleasant     We sat waited few minutes lady walked told eat taking drink order     Walking line excited see all seafood two different selections fish   Thats it!

Overall give place 2 5 stars max  <EOR> I buffet family Friday afternoon around 1pm  no line    should first sign walk away try something else    but before wasn't bad   The prime rib cold crab legs hot crab legs star buffet  Other isn't much tasty  liked beef empanadas but little salty  shrimp tempura good but tasted exactly kind buy Costco  desserts area lacking but very tasty cookies    especially white chocolate cranberries! also really enjoyed vanilla sauce bread pudding   The service ok  plates stacked 3 4 dishes before being taken away but drinks brought refilled timely manner    I wouldn't suggest coming if only going vegas buffet during your trip  But bad just good Bellagio Wynn Buffets  <EOR> Vegetarians take note $30 buy all wilty iceberg lettuce overcooked white rice baked potato oily asparagus your heart desires  just ask your money back someplace else  <EOR> Decent enough but worth any wait    No complaints food but nothing exceptional  place understaffed server inattentive stressed thanks another party being difficult  Unlimited mimosa     More here's forget until very end meal when ask if want another then take forever bring you  <EOR> Came breakfast 10am 12 21 2014  Was little pricey taste breakfast but hubby can't say no buffet    It really wasn't Par book      wasn't huge variety breakfast items  lot fruit offered kept looking muffins bread didn't find any until eating checking dessert area    They put all hot rolls muffins sweet breads over there  full then eat any that    They also offering lunch items time didn't care any food did get    Will remember skip future  <EOR> If could leave no stars would family came last night hardly ate anything all bc food overly cooked hard couldn't chew but daughter did eat ingest some very sick   EMT come check horrible side pains nausea   informed wasn't very good idea eat few another restaurant later realized hard food most likely old over cooked   took room wheel chair   never return eat buffet   <EOR> Let start off saying Mandalay Buffet might many dishes some other buffet's but quality   Upon viewing selection food kinda itching bit more but taking few bites well cooked steak perfect crusted salmon instantly gave high approval even less selection  sides very tasty everything just good quality taste it   Dessert wise few pieces cake equally outstanding    The ambiance buffet very relaxing slight dim light some nice scenery outside windows   For price $30+ tax very happy choice once again quality gave high reviews easily made lack major selection food  <EOR> Your average buffet    Poultry options scarce    if you're sea food lover then you're heaven    food decent filling   nothing ordinary  <EOR> I visited during holiday season paid $32 60 per person holiday special which lasts all day  If you're coming interesting food options then you're better off other buffet places Strip Wicked Spoon Cosmopolitan  Lastly if you're dining during day ask seating next windows bask warm sunlight   beauty being desert winter  <EOR> The prices good  Approx $20 per person  food okay  Its fresh matters most  prime rip nice medium rare  other dishes spectacular but better simply edible  service good but waitress thought switched person  She asked husband if he same guy sitting moment ago  guess people try cheat places but c'mon    It over halfway through meal    After thought waitress forgot request steak knife she didn't say anything when she serving table next ours she really didn't  just took while  felt bad mentally berating ignoring request   The dessert section probably best  Nice chewy cookies  oatmeal cranberry one  also really good peach cobbler excellent vanilla frozen yogurt top  <EOR> There lot food stations compared other buffets strip buffets general  food choices very limited if massive seafood fan  even any tomato's put salad    The food also very average    If looking good buffet chances disappointed  <EOR> Paid almost 80 bucks 2 adults 2 kids breakfast  Lots food choices  Everything looked clean fresh  Great omelette bar  Waitress keeping drinks filled  Kinda pricey but pleasantly satisfied end  <EOR> Monday morning breakfast   $20 person   Food pretty mediocre   terrible but would definitely back  <EOR> What great buffet!

<EOR> You would think Vegas casino Mandalay Bay would sufficient buffet hosted hotel but sorely disappointed Bayside Buffet   I because some online site said served little bit seafood  only seafood saw your typical shrimp cocktail soup very little crab legs buffet should categorized more American offering seafood   I ate around 12 pm which prime lunch time  Being disappointed no seafood picked bunch standard things  However food already felt dry sitting long  ate could limited selection   I may may give place second chance  service okay but food just wasn't very good  <EOR> This place gave food poisoning  never buffett again even if its free  menu change food needs better  also more items menu sure everything prepared safe keeping! <EOR> DEFINITELY definitely best buffet Vegas!  really cheap probably best thing it   can't remember any item really enjoyed   just remember boyfriend disappointed first plate filled last plate struggled finish   Never again  <EOR> The selections dishes offered minimal variety especially compared other buffets    The quality food basic   best tastes good cafeteria food    However biggest complaint both sister food poisoning eating brunch lunch  think crab legs which dry salty <EOR> This review breakfast only Twice breakfast price fairly reasonable Las Vegas  food mediocre but good Vegas  tip Tax buffet $17 50  selection fair   very Denny's like  much way juices coffee average only few types fruit  egg station features really unhappy dude rather bitch job co workers focus delivery   Our table service generally good though waitress table ratio real low    One tip open 7AM if early much better place becomes zoo  <EOR> This worth money! just typical Buffett nothing special all! disappointed take daughter first Vegas buffet food mediocre felt cheap  did salmon but salad bar weak food seemed prepared quickly some cooks seemed annoyed unfriendly  would recommend anyone  WAY overpriced!

Save your $30 dine restaurant instead there's plenty within Mandalay Bay Border Grill House Blues Slice Vegas  <EOR> The crab legs prime rib delicious!  buffet decent Mexican Chinese food section   really bummed dessert station caramel sauce bread pudding     late 8 30pm guess understandable   However price should stocked everything  <EOR> This absolute worst experiences entire Vegas trip food horrible poorly cooked prepared only nice thing say place nice view pools    Do suggest anyone actually wants enjoy meals <EOR> I would probably give 3 1 2 stars because waiter really attentive replenished drinks when empty    Like any buffets some great parts some really crappy parts  salad bar which seemed rarely touched great  vegetables crisp could pretty much any salad imaginable all ingredients    The pizza never touched looked good but didn't pay $29 including tax nosh pizza  highlight buffet probably crab legs prime rib  doesn't love prime rib?   Definitely lot carnivore options!  The stuffed chicken pretty good well sides such mashed potatoes gravy  short ribs succulent    The Asian Indian part buffet pretty pathetic untouched  As spanish mexican part buffet  Sorry looking beans tikka masala paella etc  probably wouldn't back    They some table window look side more comfortable booths  desserts weren't all great looking fabulous chocolate cookie but otherwise  If weren't delicious prime rib great service would 2 stars  <EOR> Best priced buffet Strip really good  amazing but pretty good  liked sushi carved turkey soo good mashed potatoes  great selection soups but then again buffet soup?  Dessert best part <EOR> Definetly typical buffet would boring Ohio  only buffet Vegas but duly impressed  huge selection food all rather good  Especially prime rib recommend check out  around 11 still breakfast some lunch    Kind pricy though  I think paid around $20? But server very friendly funny  <EOR> They didn't huge selection other buffets to  food ok   The only item really enjoyed oxtails! OMG tender flavor perfect  would probably back just item alone   After done checked dessert table  ALWAYS creme brle did disappointing  just grabbed chocolate cake something coconut but tasted mostly marshmallows plopped onto pastry cake shell   Again 3 stars because oxtail dish alone! <EOR> Overall pretty good buffet experience  very little wait dinner price reasonable  staff hostess waiter all pretty friendly  pasta chef super kind maintained good conversation taught little bit pasta sauce he making which thought cool!   They many food stations seafood pasta Asian thought menu covered pretty good sized range  custom order pasta station probably best part    While wasn't anything particular super phenomenal good food atmosphere place could come back future  <EOR> I high hopes coming into bayside buffet  variety quality food disappointing  only good thing could eat hot crab legs  taste Chinese food horrible  Every other thing looked looked extremely greasy  beef sliced mostly pure fat  never come again  <EOR> Worst buffet ever to  Over $71 2 NOTHING hot NOTHING flavorful  Ended filling 3 glasses tea some bread pudding! pieces prime rib size 50 cent piece only lay 2 time Seriously nothing good!

Talk let down  Basically just some soft serve couple little brownie bites    The best thing buffet Todd waiter kept drinks full super friendly    I would skip much preferred Aria Bellagio Wynn over one  Don't waste your walk down there  <EOR> Few years ago before  good w lots choices appropriate quality  This time Sunday morning champagne brunch really good which nice saying being nearly BAD   No line wait should suspicious but paid in  server really nice helpful quickly brought champagne soft drinks  But food terrible much choices nice display quality really sucks  I tried usual things prime rib lamb ham say wasn't average below  Don't even if hotel guest me  definitely better places spend 30$ more brunch  <EOR> The buffet fairly expensive but actually liked place while Vegas  stayed Mandalay Bay breakfast $17 99 dinner $35 00 both during week  Fresh made order omelets morning course prime rib night  wait staff very friendly kept table clear dirty dishes  Pretty good variety food choose but surprised didn't favorite french dressing salads  Other only other complaint prime rib being extremely rare taste  quality food fairly decent ambiance pleasant  Despite negative reviews I'd definitely come back when town again  <EOR> So 28 99 tax lunch buffet  liked it  definitely coming back  chinese Brazilian American breakfast sushi station well omelet bar made order  Chinese food section boasted steamed pork buns pot stickers fried rice chow mein orange chicken beef stir fry  American station flank steak cooked perfection rib eye steak ham made scratch mashed potatoes beef stew then some  breakfast bar amazing  Poached eggs English muffins bacon sausage beef country fried sreak grits biscuits n gravy chilaquiles cheese egg scramble green salsa  Chorizo eggs  if course where seafood options  Swai shrimp crab legs your hearts content  Champagne buffet 5$ more but opted out  course side dishes garnishing galore  definitely coming back  We'll Worth it  <EOR> Great buffet!

Apparently is  Take word it  <EOR> What really say buffet Vegas hasn't already said  second time Bayside Buffet  actually better ones but buffet food never going amazing    Some pluses     free champaign beer wine option limited but still counts     crab legs score!     dessert options plentiful though all very good     The pasta bar great though expect wait bit   Everything else so so  prime rib bit rare but apparently them grill some more which aunt did knew?

City Sin! FOOD! FOOD! FOOD! Sometimes feel very guilty eating all food while town     hmmmm    ok   over guilt!  What's next?  The next Bayside Buffet Mandalay bay!  I'm sort surprised some reviews place because every time whether just 2 people party 6+ always great meals   Although understand buffets starts look all same while but still taste if food done right should main focus reviews   had    it's party 5 time around lunch! Salad Little disappointed time around because bomb spinach salad    now nowhere found but just your own salad   Oh well shouldn't main focus anyway   Pizza Decided try BBQ chicken   Very comparable CPK's BBQ except doesn't all onions other little veggie groups CPK but still tasty     Hot meat section Unlike other buffets where eat stations named differently don't recall name each areas but just simply wrapped around line food call hot meat section! Osso Buco extremely tender flank steak actually moist soft!  No dry all!  Then thick piece beef can't recall now but literally soft using fork flake off entire piece meat!  Everyone group very much raving this  I think part shank which why juicy soft! Then typical prime rib ham etc     Custom pasta station chef behind 4 stoves all toppings would want your pasta served believe 3 different sauces Alfredo Marinara olive oil Very fresh delicious looking but passed carbs move bigger better things      Hot Seafood Section Some typical Salmon fried shrimp steam halibut etc   Everything decent tasty but nothing crazy except battered shrimp   fried perfection each them XXL sized shrimp!  really shrimp instead having breading just many other places   Ethnic food section some reason wasn't into today     passed Chinese Mexican Japanese fare exception having couple pieces sushi California roll actually tasted good fresh rice because some sushi Vegas Costco like rice which really nasty   refreshing see least buffet having good rice even though sushi restaurant Dessert section only gripe dessert didn't offer much ice cream selection   However did trio sugar free purees tiramisu Hazelnut Pastachio All absolutely wonderful tasting right amount creaminess right amount aroma infused into them     since small 6 them!  LOL!  But dessert could little better others strip hotel such Mandalay bay hosting buffet   Final Verdict Everyone still enjoyed buffet again no complaints   did however less usual because took many small samples all wasn't hungry moment   I'm sure all probably thinks crazy now!  LOL!  Like   what's guy?  Does he endless stomach talkin'  much food?  LOL! But Bayside Buffet still more enjoyable buffets strip if ask me! Also while casino sure take nice deep breath coconut air!  Just stay away more smoky part casino   actually pretty refreshing! <EOR> OPEN BAR  This review start end two words   I never wedding one any kind function matter such glorious opportunity    We arrived dinner somewhat late according hours   little did know didn't much time waste   We took time peruse goods food options  wide selection pizza seafood prime rib ham Chinese Mexican Middle Eastern Yes am working visual memory selection salad options     then found it     The bar manned newest best friend and only took few seconds David    At Mandalay Bay pay dinner we used girlfriend's discount coupons MLife's app MyVegas bogo admission dinner  $33 dollars two   bad all but if wise use something app 60 dollars does feel lot buffet   Anyways   came discover   pay for  best friend David and can't stress enough awesome guy was informed open bar both beer wine  Well Canadian leaped joy asked beer two   let know he'd see soon    The food probably aided liquid consuming some best stuff whole trip  some low points  Corn Cob soggy bland   Alaskan Crab legs impossible into fault looking seeking solution My best friend David amazing around ensure every table fill bar he closing down hour before actual buffet closed    I did 5 beers dinner took 6th road  Because when Rome   OPEN BAR <EOR> Went buffet Easter brunch  everything craving more! wasn't huge buffet but  okay because if any bigger would gotten overwhelmed   also very affordable  worth it  <EOR> I've started coming since few years ago dinner  Great prime rib good variety seafood excellent dessert   The rest food above average but nothing really memorable  All all Bayside Buffet pretty good its price  <EOR> We dinner Friday night during low season Las Vegas   No waiting line   every many people here   We awesome attentive waiter refilled drinks without needing asked   Delicious pineapple slices fresh salad   The quality prime rib pretty good buffet place   My favorite dish oxtail  YUM!

Then would rather drive other free parking casino      <EOR> The food plentiful wide variety   Just best gourmet meal around but good enough price     Lots breakfast options <EOR> This pretty awful $25  food really did taste sitting hours  stayed away seafood co worker looked unpleased but thankfully wasn't miserable later on  <EOR> I two friends spontaneous weekend trip Las Vegas ended lunch  sure price $20 lunch but decided take risk try out  ended eating over three hours because everything good  food great quality  enjoyed very tender prime rib melted because good  Also enjoyed coconut butterfly shrimp lamb mutton two types salmon many different sides dishes  desserts best part  various individual sized pies cakes pastries  tried them all  especially liked coconut cream pies fresh fruit tarts raspberry chocolate cake tiramisu  But best part vanilla custard soft serve waffle cone topped fresh blueberries  received outstanding service nice window seat overlooking trees hotel pool  definite must revisit  <EOR> I always try stay Mandaley Bay hotel when town  eating buffet even sweeter vacation  yum yum yum <EOR> Went lunch   Cost $19 99   Now lets see     service good   Everything very clean   pasta station which must me   Though wasn't big @ Bellagio   pizza fresh tasty   meats all pretty dry which typical     These seafood bouillabaisse really good   Fried butterflied shrimp good well   variety cold seafood including ceviche octupus shrimp     For dessert fruit tart which great well   I don't know good place dinner but A OK lunch   Didn't blow water buffet wise but pretty cheap   I would again if side strip  <EOR> My people ate breakfast three days row mid May no complaints must good  experience dinner buffet Thursday evening  server attentive drinks clearing plates  But buffet star!  I really zero complaints food dinner buffet  If know  bit unusual  Sometimes buffets *phone in* common dishes but didn't notice here  Literally every single thing tried delicious  While love critical only *note* would include more vegetables or non meat entrees  only say because noticed plate nearly all meats  But picky eater so      This only buffet experience during most recent Las Vegas trip may slightly biased  mind know buffet fan  Bayside Buffet excellent buffet dinner actually *almost* regret missing breakfast spread each morning except enjoy sleeping  <EOR> The food mediocre   Not bad but super good  If you're foodie choose wisely  everything buffet good but must pick choose  some diamonds there   My husband came Friday lunch few months ago  scored BOGO tickets meal  meal GREAT deal! two for lunch buffet paid $23 total  would definitely come back place heart beat  value phenomenal price  But course next time I'd same thing pick delicious things and trust some including yummy Lox! sea mediocre food  <EOR> Enjoyed food here   Seafood luxurious would expect $35 per person   steaks chicken great selection magnanimous  Also buffet layed handle large crowds making short lines   Ulimited beer wine champagne huge plus  <EOR> Some MGM properties offer buffet day passes where pony few Hamiltons dine buffet morning noon night   We tried Mandalay Bay's Bayside Buffet recently where its $43 all day pricing set save $21 apiece  planned spending quiet day hotel anyway  relax property's 11 acre beach between breakfast lunch playing some slots visiting shark reef aquarium before dinner  did feel trapped there   Breakfast well  house coffee beyond expectations bacon nice crispy could find all usual breakfast suspects scrambled eggs waffles lots lots smoked salmon  What's more surprising inclusion south of the border Mexcian fare served well including some very delicious tamales just could stop eating  Maybe best tamales ever had   Lunch just fine  Prime rib crab legs now available some scrumptious barbecued short ribs  selection decent but very exciting  no wow factor  flavors good but great   The choices time day also infused many Latin American flavors including chorizo beef sausage pleasant tomatillo salad favorite tamales  however bit disconcerting see darling meaty corn husks piled same hotel pan left them pining gullet several hours ago  same ones put breakfast?  Supper lot less impressive though maybe because still full eating twice day already  Unfortunately nothing new spectacular offered evening did see lunch time   Sure couple new Asian dishes curry two some flank steak that just bit tough bite but nothing else really worth mentioning  Even pasta station full swing night nice selection sauces came short serving pasta quite al dente   After getting fill breakfast lunch felt another meal overdoing left feeling stodgy couple bites ended quelling later that night hunger pans couple Belgian beers some items off bar menu Tender nearby Luxor   Did money's worth?  I would happily pay $15 breakfast even more if managed transitioning lunch just before 11 am   also feel $16 fair price lunch but again would try brunch visit would eat both breakfast lunch never mind three full meals   That said you'd value dinner $12 least one day pass worth could if don't mind lots routine want stick $42 a day food budget  <EOR> Very slow inefficient cashier  Once table all staff friendly accommodating  Food below average except champagne  didn't expect good sushi buffet but even worse  salmon serve smoked  would liked cream cheese crackers but sushi rice  Champagne steamed crab legs meal  would back  <EOR> Sorry give place two stars food    Service good  machines front made quick pay pretty quickly considering around 7pm Friday  waiter good getting drinks refills timely fashion  setting bad pretty new ish looking interior relatively appealing eyes   However food where started downhill  started some seafood  shrimp cocktail relatively good but sauce wasn't very good  crab legs cold ones horrible tasted quite old  rest food area looked messy didn't taste all great    The hot dishes other side alright well  best part meal probably roast beef but then again better other Vegas hotels well    The dessert pretty good almost saved meal  But all stuff seemed coming refrigerator instead people actually making it  know probably doesn't happen much Vegas but just didn't add already hurt Bayside Buffet   Overall probably come again  expected more Mandalay Bay! guess half empty dining room during peak hours should sign  <EOR> When think Mandalay Bay certain quality comes mind  nice hotel very aesthetically pleasing however buffet entirely lacking  Mandalay price more circus circus food choice  Don't wrong food wasn't horrid     just expected more  nothing special food  Nothing made say goodness need come back here  did pasta station where cook your pasta made order     but cosmo same thing   Three stars because staff really awesome  Lance great  Even though he manning pasta station  he very attentive other stations well   Point story don't high expectations  okay buffer but if want bang buck bacchanal @ Cesars way go!!! <EOR> The best buffet Vegas far  Sunday u mamosas crab legs  All food really flavor  worth money  Dessert superb  love eveything  Set service staff top notch  Wait isn't ridiculous  Love love  <EOR> This buffet just eh   I came Christmas dinner different menu normal   general most things ate pretty overcooked   prime rib dry well turkey other roasted meats   crab legs okay if them fresh but many them smaller didn't really much meat it   I saw section buffet where customize pasta they'll you! super excited try but unfortunately pasta bland flavorless   Salt made slightly better     The pan fried scallops looked great but dismay very overcooked tender all     Maybe just came wrong day most food happened overcooked   Although would expect Christmas dinner better quality    The line pretty long well seemed long most days walked buffet    A couple good notes service decent pineapple juice! <EOR> Great food! Its bit pricey but kids under 4 don't pay evened us  breakfast lunch several days staff super friendly food amazing  wouldn't exactly say kid friendly but made work  5 stars totally! <EOR> Wow     pay same Wynn buffet but So much LESS    The food disappointing having eaten other Vegas buffets    food didn't taste fresh anything  wasn't anything special amazing  sushi worse you'd grocery store  Ate plate stopped there    sad  <EOR> Screw prime rib crab legs where at!  I came long time ago first Las Vegas' buffets Mandalay Bay   when came back while ago decided try again   wasn't disappointed all    Sure prices may increased over years but quality  food still opinion  <EOR> I'm fan writing negative review  simply because if nothing nice say don't but case just feel write share experience  First all fan buffets believe all same cafeteria tasting food but once while urge prove myself wrong opinion buffets  looking somewhere eat decided eat but before did online check lunch diner menu  showed item caught eye shrimp salt pepper which definitely enjoy  payed $30 per person walked right service wasn't  bad but walking around check couldn't help notice didn't item  asked workers she no clue talking pulled phone showed menu which talking myself because she still didn't know  decided try some other food but no flavor over cooked just enough options  30 dollars per person definitely recommend place  Won't eat again  <EOR> I highly enjoyed selection quality items buffet    Arriving 10 30am seated immediately didn't even opportunity but hit pleather before waitress came take drink order   She attentive throughout entire meal always replacing empty water glasses juice glasses    My favorite items included Mashed Potatoes people aren't kidding  They're buttery delicious whipped perfection! Fried Chicken the skin crunchy meat tender fell off bone  Perfect  Desserts I few tartlets all wonderful well fruit cobbler  Didn't try cakes but certainly looked delish! Fruit selection fresh juicy hit spot! Pizza it certainly wasn't CPK but wasn't gross either   Very suitable buffet  Potatoes Au Grautin practically licked plate these   Everything else so so except pancakes which actually lable gross inedible   Certainly would mind returning next time staying Mandalay Bay! <EOR> What nice little surprise!  Mandalay Bay far south end strip hardly ever stop regular Vegas trips   Since staying MGM able hop shuttle Excalibur     The food little above average buffet   really enjoyed taquito's   corn tortilla's tasted homemade   saw chef checking food overheard guiding folks making food   wouldn't say big some other area buffets but quality new favorite  <EOR> We excited buffet whole stay   only buffet hotel Laughlin AMAZING   thought Vegas would step even up     Oh   Hell   No     As someone allergic seafood doesn't eat meat virtually nothing eat   Cheese pizza?  Cheese lasagna?  crappy salad bar school cafeterias better?  I thought Oh well some fruit some rice more carbs just head dessert side more carbs because screw it  Rice terrible   Fruit hard ripe   Desserts dry flavorful honestly left wishing McDonalds chocolate chip cookie     I am disappointed entire experience EXCEPT server   She very sweet  <EOR> Golden Corral 5 star experience compared buffet   Crab over cooked sushi dry terrible choices limited   could only tolerate few plates mashed potatoes trying almost everything looking diamond rough  <EOR> Since staying Mandalay Bay decided try buffet second morning  The food mediocre best  Nothing really stood being spectacular  My advice skip buffet Raffles cafe instead  much better  <EOR> We sunday lunch few months ago   remember yesterday i'd rather not  Nothing else Mandalay Bay appealed me  Everything seemed fancy overpriced  Nothing called except place  Eek  wrong  lots meat dishes few veggies besides salad bar  lots breads even more desserts  liked sugar free options nice but neither SF nor regular desserts tasted very good but pretty    just very pretty bland  Seemed almost no taste? hmmm  would back   bf again recently but he coudlnt remember if he'd before  but he came home said he'd eaten place horrible @ Mandalay Bay  When strip recently fight night parked @ Mandalay Bay b c MGM super packed didnt even want risk trying find parking he recognized becon night!  It!  place ate @ horrible!     heck even Sam s club Orleans better food much cheaper prices  <EOR> Really great thinking talking buffet Vegas  selection very limited  Price bad  <EOR> I personally think best buffets las vegas because crowded no line small line reasonably priced fresh food good service! Lunch mon fri 19 99  wide variety foods favorites being prime rib ask put girl omelette pasta making service lots shrimp seafood selections  <EOR> Food ok price  Sushi horribly fishy tasting   Prime rib well marbled tender but probably should asked them warm grill little   Mexican foods ok  I'd come again if only interested prime rib salad kids but price I'd probably someplace else   Flavor ok  more family area expect might crying babies around you  bothered since expected nor lowered rating it   The deserts ok  Nothing really blew mind away place did read other reviews before going didn't very high expectations begin with    I don't drink but if other review said open bar  might worth cost    It would great if more sushi types choose but very salty fishy tasting all am  used real sushi place  <EOR> A OK  Absolutely A OK   Since $40 00 Breakfast Lunch Brunch Buffet Voucher staying MGM brand hotels boyfriend decided give Bayside Buffet try!  Total $43 28 $19 99 + tax per person pay only $3 28 own pockets!

They're buffets    For price great   But last dinner Vegas just saddened it   I first headed over crab legs prime rib since they're pretty much most expensive things there   crab legs alright but man when they're lukewarm cold just aren't good   Some meat stuck insides legs too   prime rib chewy again cold  Blah! point keep trying tell myself buffet buffet    pasta station next   LOL maybe insulting but reminded pasta station some dining halls UCSD  *flashback moment* okay over  Yeah some flavor but haha pasta already par cooked kind came overcooked when put boiling water   I tried stay away asian section but mean give everything try right? don't know why fish  Fish = dry buffets  stupid just don't fish  YAY coconut shrimp can't screw up!   I actually really did seafood cioppino   don't know REALLY supposed taste but liked flavor  Spicy tomato y lots random seafood things there   Desserts   kind sucked   Cobbler maybe 2 3 crumb topping 1 3 canned fruit   Cakes meh  Frozen yogurt like   ice y vanilla paste? Cookies soft bad   Honestly think could desserts little better   Why am being picky buffet? don't know buffet   Come if want crab legs 'cause  pretty much saw everyone else getting   But going buffets when Vegas <EOR> Food selection quality bit above average buffet   $42 99 all day pass definitely bargain but you'll end eating much wondering why heck couldn't just satisfied plate since just good   I'd recommend filling shrimp salmon beef skipping sushi greasy looking options  <EOR> A solid average buffet Vegas  Decent selections although found some food borderline cold  Don't expect much won't disappointed  satisfied overall but wasn't something write home about  <EOR> Attended brunch experiencing coolest Elvis wedding niece new groom John!  This buffet step other tried   Fresh omelets fresh veggies can't argue move   Chorizo eggs which huge plus me  Some other surprises but buffet all bad  <EOR> Only if Vegas budget would place acceptable     Pros  Cheap Lots food  Cons  Assembly line Low quality food <EOR> This buffet must come vegas 10 years  ago classy wonderful quality food wide variety    stopped improving menu now seems just ordinary even Luxor buffet Excalibur WAAAAAY better  <EOR> The food good there's pretty decent selection which choose  Almost four stars but service mediocre best  Definitely better other buffet options Strip  <EOR> Vegas full buffets   probably more buffets square mile entire state North Dakota  Not North Dakota populous but point  tons buffets outside Vegas   say say pleasantly surprised Bayside Buffet Mandalay Bay Hotel   What nice variety food quality food good  many places beef oxtails buffet lines?  many unless you're Jamaica place specializes Caribbean food  Everything fresh servers took care never let glasses lacking   much more expensive buffets can't say food same quality wait staff took care better   food tasty catered variety tastes  E g  Chinese Mexican etc    Everything tasty FRESH   Did say fresh?  Yes because think volume food served buffet lines grimy certain amount time food isn't refreshed often should be   here!  time!  still can't think favorite food tasted but oxtails rice crab legs stand out  I know most buffets serve crab legs shrimp but theirs very fresh tasting  I would definitely recommend buffet based upon quality variety food price cleanliness  <EOR> I am never big fan buffets but located Mandalay Bay Hotel where stayed work few days row lately finally try week  turned better expected! following tried liked braised veal tender flavorful ox tails tender flavorful Prime rib sliced your order medium rare slice juicy flavorful chicken corden bleu very juicy chicken meat just right amount melted cheese cooked ham filling Smoked salmon Seaweed salad Seafood cioppino not spicy though Braised green beans Chocolate cookie one best tried date soft chewy chocolaty Red velvet cake moist cake creamy frosting overly sweet Cheesecake rich creamy overly sweet Chocolate fro yo good  What tried thought just so Crab legs plain no tools help crack shells gave trying Mussells found mostly shells fish meat sauce tiramisu much cream which very bland enough cake which itself did taste much no coffee syrup detected Bread pudding tasted savory steamed egg dish nothing dessert dish Paella bland Salmon panko coating plain  What didn't try care Chinese egg rolls fried rice gai lan stir fried veggies buns etc   selection small anyway save room stomach other things anyway  Sushi only two types rolls no sashimi other smoked salmon slices  Mexican just some regular looking pulled pork refried beans rice jalapenos etc  Pizzas pastas huge variety looked plain  There much more items such green fruit salads way more desserts dessert station  but could only eat much meal     $30 per person dinner  limited selection wines included  <EOR> Bayside nicest dining areas among Strip buffets   food selection average good quality   Iced tea brewed a big no no restaurant evaluation criteria    Compromise dessert quality if need cut corners but sure fresh brew iced tea     The best item day visited prime rib   tender nice flavor bloody know roasted while   food selection vast Bellagio Wynn M Resort but price commensurate selection     The service good even server shift change     There ATM style kiosks beginning line automate payments   user interface simple     Bayside A Ok 3 stars  <EOR> People picky reviews embarrassing figuratively sick  If can't find something eat Bayside Buffet then really ought broaden your horizons   Bayside Buffet offers vast selection breakfast lunch foods around brunch time  found nothing could truly say disliked though some sort Asian chicken orange chicken? bland  Other solid buffet  breakfast Mexican options probably favorite part but all decent better  mostly better   The only reason I'd consider giving Bayside Buffet three stars service  pile plates table took quite awhile them taken away us  Maybe buffets ought just area where bring your dirty plate set it?

Overall great buffet!! <EOR> This place beautiful entrance beautiful window openings outside feels very tropical   Most stars atmosphere  The food good  selection decent much comparison some other buffets   dont many options fresh makings chefs   dinner buffet only guy pasta place which way watery al dente bland despite loads sauce it And sushi hard rice!! ugh   sushi hard rice gross  I probably wouldnt eat again but decent selections  <EOR> Decent food decent price  Servers nice long wait even weekend  Good selection global foods  nothing really wowed but also nothing thought terrible  <EOR> The meal service outstanding  Margaret especially manager Jordan exceptional  glad came friends certainly back! <EOR> We ate last night probably worst food buffet  The decorations inside facility first rate  Also table service excellent  no wait refill  problem poor quality some food  Instead slicing off nice piece beef server just plopped chunk dry over cooked meat plate  large piece front guy no better  $35 00 each didn't expect same quality Bellagio  did expect good meal but disappointed  <EOR> We came because conference staying hotel plus wife loves buffets   wasn't greatest buffet Vegas but definitely best customer services buffets Vegas  <EOR> We Vegas Thanksgiving didn't feel dropping $60 per person Bacchanal buffet Thanksgiving prices especially party 12  $30 per person food bad all  12 still breakfast items available well lunch thanksgiving lunch items well  food excellent but pretty good more fill  prime rib tender though little dry but still pretty good  All food hot could see staff constantly checking food temperature sure all well  much choose but able try everything wanted  good selection though probably much Bacchanal buffet Bellagio but you'll definitely your money's worth  staff attentive always making sure drinks filled tables cleared  Also no line buffet  Give try if don't feel waiting other buffets  actually bad all  <EOR> Basic buffet   Food isn't bad   But awesome either   Came brunch  few surprise items i e  oxtail soup chilequiles but otherwise your basic buffet fare   Food good but no wow factor   Actually  lie   COOKIES  mmmmmm    They're big soft oh divine   white chocolate cherry favorite whispers took some home   <EOR> Such disappointment!   Bayside Buffet Mandalay Bay several years ago enjoyed it   Sure wasn't best buffet ever but clearly ranked near top    But seems buffet changed over past few years now I'd rank near bottom list   positive note price only half better buffets charge   just show pay for  <EOR> For price food worth it  lunch came 32 dollars person   tip plus tax  10 more dollars Aria which 5 star buffet during dinner   place old stale same run dishes find any other buffet 20 bucks  <EOR> I won comped lunch buffet off MyVegas Facebook game  I'd never Mandalay Bay figured it'd good excuse come check all out    After having mLife desk comp loaded card headed over place around 1pm Friday    There plenty food   no doubt that  Nothing really stood though  did enjoy sushi but thought some meat drier should've been   Drink service good though   the guy kept filling glasses faster could gulp them down    All all probably wouldn't way visit again  <EOR> Customer service worse   paid set waitress took almost 25 table almost star plate  without no ketchup no Tabasco sauce  No glass water  orange juice but hostess waitress talking  personal stuff ask service   She came desapier again talking  Now another waiter   good all until respect full <EOR> I am fan buffets  brunch while visiting family   Really average all around  Nothing memorable  Just lots boring food little taste  <EOR> Lunch brunch review   For $25 some change bad all   If price exceeds range wouldn't come back unless food quality options rise   The food no doubt tasty but wouldn't say fresh   After some heavy proteins wanted something light refreshing crisp texture   so salad bar   I sort through salads pick foul pieces   Nevertheless everything else pretty good tasty  favor inexpensive buffets no lines while food being atleast decent   The hot coffee good nice touch end meal   I stayed Delano quick easy access decent buffet   I satisfied  <EOR> Don't breakfast  Everything bland  line long omelet bar muffins costco think  Maybe lunch dinner better  Also holograms way creepy  <EOR> This buffet horrible dinner! Bland food very little options poor quality  am sure people rave being best buffet Vegas  extremely disappointed buffet  never back  Try buffet Aria Bellagio  Those truly best  waste your money here  <EOR> Had brunch  decent  french toast sticks good quality  <EOR> Food good but best  Server did great job getting drinks plates way  But wouldn't recommend going there  <EOR> Been couple times only because MYVEGAS resort credit  2 1 lunch dinner  ok  much selection but it'll when don't pay full price  <EOR> It alright  never really hit spot really satisfied cravings  Wish gone lunch dinner instead  during brunch more breakfast lunch  worth $25 person  Pay few extra bucks elsewhere  food lacking flavor  Meats rubbery very hot  Most food looked sitting while under warm hot lamp  least say ate but reviews true  Unless free meal pay extra few bucks something something worth telling your friends about  <EOR> Unlimited wine champagne beer! Need say more?     Food 9 10 Tasted great freshly prepared   Service 10 10 Waiters Waitresses very attentive polite   Variety 7 10 Was lacking department comparison some other casino buffets visited   Price $30 per person Very good price considering free unlimited alcohol great food excellent service   Had good experience overall would definitely recommend visiting buffet   *September 2013 <EOR> was disappointed brunch $28 didn't anything tasty   since staying mandalay easy choice but wouldn't come back even if did stay again  <EOR> Tons variety unlimited champagne!!  This definitely worth price opinion  Some food better others but average everything good    They seemed almost every type meat think various food genres  specific night american asian mexican italian  sushi station setup custom ordered pasta  dessert bar also quite extravagant  full various pies cake puddings soft serve ice cream cookies both regular sugar free    The only reason why didn't give place 4 stars table service little slow things drinks extra silverware but no way impactful enough come back next time am here  <EOR> When Vegas    buffets  tried    but no avail  token buffet spot managed check time around eh   It Friday night    tired desperate food last resort   It 8 30ish crowd gone  maybe just bad buffet?   We seated right away    server asked drinks    town  Mind last time buffet cruise ship weird being buffet setting looked much cruise ship did sense? Anyway guess wasn't buffet zone b c hardly ate anything  two pieces braised beef which decent    tender right flavoring string beans mushrooms steamed rice it hard eh    I walked around waiting food items scream me    pick pick but failed  did dessert bar even eh  good but WOW    Overall guess once you've best buffets Bellagio Wynn    there's no going back   Go if your desperate liked us    but if time energy money Bellagio Wynn    really    there   PS service prompt friendly    no complaints there  <EOR> I've WAY better   only reason ate because Hotel hungover anywhere else   Hardly any options you'd expect Vegas Buffet    You expect endless amounts food pile plates totally wasteful because just want sample everything! Yeah don't expect when come here   more school cafeteria world class buffet   I'd rather gone Wynn Bellagio Rio  <EOR> This probably least favorite meal Vegas last weekend   I remember excited seeing price only 17 99 around that breakfast buffet but over plate  put exact same food items both sides buffet initially think there's going double options actually available  Also sure if all buffets but annoying giving tip before even know service going like  Maybe  just though  <EOR> I would expected little more Mandalay Bay  food OK prime rib crab legs being 2 leading items but nothing compared Bacchanal Ceaser's  wait staff made lot mistakes  ordered iced tea brought pink lemonade  10 minutes before he came around again could ask correct it  told ordered iced tea lemonade  does he do? He comes back another pink lemonade which promptly sent back  also slow pick dirty plates table  would save your money pay extra eat Bacchanal Ceaser's instead place  <EOR> Mediocre best! lot options  only tray assorted sushi dungeon crab legs which gross dry  Everything sucked honest! <EOR> We stayed Mandalay Bay fun getaway ate convenience day left  Well fact Free voucher eat compliments MLife  also B1G1 Free voucher MyVegas wanted use kids  Well because they're cheaper   However under no disclosure kids price honored use coupon    Anyhow if your kids over age 4 $22 change Friday champagne brunch  None kids drinks champagne nor eat more $5 worth    As food noticed some meats ie  Flapmeat terribly dry burnt marks  char marks burnt marks difference   only guessing but would say tasted food night before   also many other meats similar effect morning brunch    Other selections included oatmeal salad bar breakfast food waffles bacon poached eggs omelet station even crab legs     Selection very limited Brunch would probably come later morning hoping would more choices    I would say GOOD cold food Lox Cheese Cold Cuts excellent  fresh blackberries blueberries fresh though when replaced Strawberries instead   kids milk plastic disposable cups   champagne tasted quite good though just 1 2 glass drive breakfast  pastries croissant some desserts ie  bread pudding excellent well   would say $30 breakfast tad high side but unfortunately came Friday instead Thursday morning only choice available    The service quite good did leave server deserving tip  Unlike other reviewers experiences Since stayed parking the new fee already included bill thought would most stay try here  <EOR> Went team buffet around 35$ but taste horrible ! boiled crab legs taste less  rotten ! sushi smelling bad  desserts all sweet ! No taste just pure sugar  Asked refund lady speaking broken English ! think machine sucked all taste food ! Don't eat food unless desperate  <EOR> Food eh  long wait Friday night least  Why does prime rib taste ham?? <EOR> Mandalay Bay's main buffet nothing made impressed  unlucky stand very long queue 30 minutes  When paid wait another line 15 minutes table  food okay but much more  Much focus seafood queues even there  big plus drinks included price even champagne which price $ 35 affordable  cheerful very pleasant waitress best  <EOR> Over priced  understand casino allowed charge more because consumers willing pay it  But come powdered eggs?? Really?! $20 least real eggs    This place should last resort  McDonald's serves better food  <EOR> Horrible don't waste your time  Nothing choose all looks old  Omelette station sucks  Only meat ham       it  No fresh hash browns tater tots     really? Tater tots  Surprised didn't pop tarts really bad  MGM buffet instead  ROCKS brisket Tri Tip steak fresh everything $5 less dump  <EOR> A few months back stayed Santa Fe Station Casino outskirts Vegas  Honestly buffet better less expensive Mandalay Bay  Seriously  breakfast Monday morning Bayside Buffet crowded food cold mostly inedible  Tons country gravy everywhere but biscuit found! someone needs tell folks MGM cold Tater Tots don't people want come back your buffet  bad breakfast cost lot money  <EOR> Average food average price  Nothing brag about  did manage give upset stomach  food just ok deserts great  <EOR> Where start ? Prepackaged pancakes frozen french toast triangles maybe its best start mug mud    mean coffee  dropping 40$ wife very disappointed shocked subpar breakfast buffet was  food quality i'd imagine prison food tastes like  2 stars delicious orange juice waiter finally brought us along delicious bacon  highly recommend any fastfood joint over place  Im sure lunch dinner but luckily wont find out  <EOR> **Summary** Quality can't say enough much better quality food is  Rarely wow feeling biting into buffet dishes  Selection buffet bit smaller selection little less varied other buffets  said also better items wouldn't find other places  Attention Detail More little surprises scrambled eggs lox pecan syrup actual pecans your french toast  little things show chefs place put pride into menu  **Price** $15 99 Breakfast 7am 11am Mon Fri $19 99 Lunch 11am 2 30pm Mon Fri $27 99 Dinner 4 45pm 9 45pm $24 99 Weekend Brunch 7am 2 30pm Sat Sun **Ate** I came brunch items brunch buffet Prime Rib never seen prime rib overcooked  always soft tender  Crab Legs usually hit miss  time dry  Cocktail Shrimps Large plump  can't just one  Clams clams bit fresh  little sand them though  Braised Ox Tail Ox tails lot meat them good flavor  Beef Short Ribs Not kalbi kind Thick fatty pretty tasty  Baked Basa fish cooked perfection  usually see fish cooked much bit dry other buffets  **Recommendations** I'd definitely recommend place weekend brunch buffet  dishes higher quality then even Wynn Bellagio  <EOR> Decided try new buffet would say isn't best however service great compared other buffets!   They variety different types food however quality weren't great  also Pasta Bar but kind let down  Dessert opposite sides where hot food was    Everything okay haha but rather elsewhere  <EOR> Service good but food horrible $36 dinner  Asian section worse baos hard rock gyoza  fried rice meh chow mein decent  only thing worth eating tiramisu cups  eaten almost every buffet Vegas they're all waste money price better restaurant outside strip  Buffet gotten inflated price quality par price  <EOR> Good bad   carver took new roast because wanted close rare possible   Bad snow crab legs dry dry little crab all work   Las Vegas Buffet Flamingo better crab 13$  <EOR> Overall Come crab legs salad shrimp cocktail fried shrimp corn cob free champagne tiramisu! Other buffet isn't anything special compared other ones  Wish better dessert selection the ice cream those machines Souplantation although waffle cones     Compared other buffets feel Bayside lower end wow spectrum  eaten Rio's buffet Paris Spice Market feel all three those better Bayside  only reason came because Mandalay Bay offered $75 spend any dining facilities   $50 four people pretty decent meal    The price may cheaper regular days but Vegas really spicing things taking advantage Christmas season  No longer buffets only expensive Christmas DAY but they've taken whole Christmas week jacked prices $10 $20 dollars! Because weren't many people night ate here  Granted arrived around 5 30 dinner but seated fairly quickly    They different dining areas but mom wanted table its own rather sitting booth connected two other tables  very nice table close salad bar very nice elderly waiter  Throughout night felt very sorry just giving all plates uneaten food food just wanted try because he much many other people serve    Anyway there's salad bar lots different toppings turkey corn mushroom etc plethora dressing Italian station sushi breakfast shrimp cocktail Asian food Italian pasta station prime rib turkey chicken station crab legs dessert champagne beer bar section    The champagne beer included fee pay  excited going asking champagne didn't even card me! Anyway food selection pretty good but food itself isn't great  ribs icky cold prime rib tasted fake just Victorian Cafe! pasta wasn't tasty either    The best things shrimp cocktail salad fried shrimp hot crab legs sure big ones people tend take those right away hot corn cob tiramisu! Loveeddd tiramisu all other desserts  think ate four five those little small cups  Left tip waiter left slightly happy because tiramisu slightly disappointed mood  <EOR> We decided try $35 eat all day deal just fun   best idea very full!!  Breakfast pretty good usual omelettes waffles bacon fruit etc   Bagels cold hard but smoked salmon good wish toaster!  Good pastries hidden back!    Lunch dinner very similar   Mostly same things except more seafood night   Dinner Saturday really busy wait long lines just see had   Braised short ribs really good   thought prime rib salty me   Crab legs good   Fried shrimp baked salmon excellent   Rolls also cold hard butter frozen   need warm bread products!!  Sushi so so   also pizza asian food potstickers good! various meats Mexican etc     I would again but 3 meals day!! But good bargain heck right? <EOR> I quick breakfast kids   waitress seemed it   orange juice bitter even kids would drink it   pricey 15 99 adults 13 99 kids 12 under   would say food comparable buffet Circus Circus    enough said  <EOR> Self check in kiosk pretty cool definitely helps speed line  no line all anyways when but still insisted using kiosk   There few standout items mind  Prime rib decent oxtail good  Everything else just okay  did king crab but huge fan it   Unlimited beer wine included your meal  Totally awesome aspect there  <EOR> If want it  enjoyed Bayside Buffet two breakfasts while staying Four Seasons located atop Mandalay Bay  endless selection overwhelming fun first time stay Las Vegas  Whether want breakfast lunch even dinner Bayside Buffet something 8 00 morning  tried bunch enjoyed everything  wish would've able try some more desserts though looked delicious  <EOR> When think Mandalay Bay think high end  Lots great restaurants shops etc   when hurry wanted buffet near chose here    I always regret looking Yelp first but no way nice upscale hotel would bad buffet right? WRONG!  The place 2 3 full yet waited least 15 min seated  food selection minimal could tell wasn't turning regularly many dishes looked over cooked old  expected taste same  Cold once under heat lamp soggy hard    With such small amount choices would think would easy keep name tags front proper food but most items wrong tags many none all   The short don't eat here  other restaurants Mandalay if want buffet find different down strip  Very strong chance any them better  <EOR> This only buffet eaten Vegas love it! around $25 all eat buffet good quality food  am sure if regular feature but house wine beer also included cost  Score! staff really helpful hostesses way find house wine when noticed already closed down bar  Upon entering pay your meal kiosk which super helpful if you're group want separate checks already taken care of! Then seated eat until your waistband can't take anymore   They don't take reservations but no line when friends arrived  <EOR> Holiday pricing during November 24 27 December 23 January 2  Children 5 12 years old  https www mandalaybay com en restaurants bayside buffet html <EOR> I came because free hotel reservation  Christmas Eve wait almost 2 hrs   Prices really expensive compare variety food served here   Bar looks long but just repeat menu side other   For free good but if paying sandwich front Citizens such better! <EOR> All say WOW!  hot food salad bar King Crab Legs dessert service just amazing compared most buffets Las Vegas   Only other buffet I'd give thumbs would Bellagio but  special occasions when visit   tend judge buffets stomach feels afterwards I'm sure everyone does too      Mandalay Bay Bayside Buffet never gave body reason rebel because all food ingredients fresh overall cleanliness excellent!   Only thing disrupted nice buffet dinner well dressed family snuck hijacked vacant table while pretending dirty dishes theirs but luckily server remembered left security escort free loaders away        Thanks Mandalay Bay providing hungry travelers gamblers best buffets Strip! <EOR> Loooove buffet  Everything great such variety  come everytime im Vegas <EOR> $24 99 brunch    Food soso expect much better Mandalay Bay    <EOR> Back day 4 star but economy took hit all buffets did quality buffet  I would categorize mid tier buffet     <EOR> A good place fill some decent food but don't expect wowed anything  boyfriend decided brunch aunt uncle since majority places still weren't open yet Bayside Buffet because figured they'd decent spread food none would complain!

Terrible service VERY inefficient  settle some other selections all which mediocre best  Fruit wasn't ripe ALL  realize seasonal but then don't include buffet if just bad  point towards end meal notice only couple seated within eye shot drinking OJ wearing wrist bands  Hmmm   I call little Asian waitress over tell drink debacle she just giggles offers husband son soft drink  manager refund stupid wrist band purchased unknowingly when DON'T DRINK!!! Poor service once again  decide dessert may only redeeming factor left head dessert bar high hopes  dismay NOTHING FRESH  Just stinkin' food  Everything looked sitting hours  Counters messy  Cookies hard rock  took each just see literally sat table slamming them against tabletop without much crumb cracking off  Bread pudding completely empty no working counter  wait good 20 minutes enjoying $8 root beer husband pays dessert bar visit just find everything same when went  no dessert  let's recap no alcohol no soft drinks until end meal when ASK WAITRESS THEM BEING INCLUDED EXPENSIVE PRICE TAG no meet no veggies no fresh fruit no fresh desserts   and $113 plus tip!!! imagine? Most expensive meal NEVER eaten   because left hungry disgusted  PS way tried stop front talk manager but everything closed off explains why nothing being prepared fresh  closing! Total epic fail VERY UNHAPPY MB  <EOR> We came breakfast good  better then Stations casino buffet    I flank steak lox capers salmon pizza couscous salad panko salmon endless supply blueberries black berries  fan breakfast foods happy able cater taste bud dilemmas  If want fancy buffet Bellagio but good enough us <EOR> Okay price great service  food selection leaves something desired during lunch food itself wasn't great  lot things cold tasted made few hours ago  <EOR> I'm Vegas binge sometime soon review supposed come earlier but busy whole year! Anyways digress some quick tips 1  time writing Bayside Buffet does still discounts through MyVegas facebook iphone app    2  Strategic timing key  If come 10 45 AM Breakfast M F $17 99 then stay lunch when bumped $21 99  just common Vegas buffet savvy though! However DOES work dinner does start 4 30 PM regardless day   3  Brunch begins 7 00 2 30 Saturdays Sundays    We rolled lazy Saturday afternoon around 1 00 PM towards tail end brunch  knew might lot people waiting but weren't prepared see line pretty much completely empty  Regardless walked presented MyVegas discount 2 1 without problems then walked buffet   I remember around twelve years back heading Bayside best crab best desserts strip  lot changed worse  seemed though almost everything lukewarm cold  Even things supposed under heat lamps still cold!  Still being hungry decided sample offer  picked various pieces meat grill some italian dishes tried sushi  things figured quickly really low quality steaks mostly tasteless full gristle   Furthermore pasta sauces watered down sushi complete utter joke  Then again sushi Vegas buffets usually really top notch all but just seaweed covered disgusting cold hard rice   The dessert section any better  Most stuff melting leftover chocolate streaks stuff already taken other guests all over plates  Most places least replace plates food taken off of   Anyways upset girlfriend most particular dish  baked rolled piece salmon seemed going hot  cut into opened discovered inside seemed raw  Note some sort fancy salmon tartar salmon sashimi supposed baked piece salmon fully cooked    Anyways notified waiter promised talk chef  watched interaction see would happen  chef talked waiter looked fish set down back laughing talking another coworker  waiter came back told chef said cooked but when asked waiter's opinion he told he wouldn't eaten because looked raw    At point asked manager  couldn't believe chef would careless guests  If he truly believed fish cooked then he should come back served piece fish me  Instead he didn't even come hear feedback anything  Anyways manager chewed chef took note really almost everything cold also comped meal  props manager deserves 5 stars but rest buffet deserves 0 stars   I would come back Bayside Buffet but perhaps your experience better! Best luck all! <EOR> Compared other food establishments Mandalay thought place pretty good  certainly would way eat any establishment Mandalay Bay but when staying good option  Why? Well breakfast 17 99 person lunch think 23 99  first time champagne brunch 25 99 unlimited champagne $5 add on good  Crab legs lots seafood options  best? No but kinda working food crack small but really sweet crab legs  Shrimp farm raised good  hubby concentrated yogurt fresh fruit all you can eat bacon  When missed breakfast still oatmeal grits fruit breakfast    There decent crowd when group Latino Gangsters not being racist just being real hubby black staff we're willing move quieter more peaceful spot    There might better buffets but when don't want far great  <EOR> I really Bayside Buffet Mandalay Bay  Recently friends food very good  live pasta station favorite 3 pasta options few sauces quite few meat vegetable options along shrimp which LOVE pasta  usually just Pasta + light Alfredo sauce + shrimp + chicken + mushrooms  Chinese selection also very good but desserts just OK  certainly room improvement but overall solid dining experience  <EOR> This only buffet ever tried Vegas 3 times love it!  I LOVE sitting windows  sunny day wonderful feel warm sun shining your hungover pounding head sit sans makeup your sunglasses sipping mimosa or bloody mary   Just sure guard blinds shades your life some family children come sit nearby servers close them   PEOPLE If don't want sun your stupid brats sit AWAY windows  understand when place full there's no place else sit  Otherwise sit shade ruin breakfast  first TAKE AWAY SUNSHINE!!!   The food good  Some stuff icky french toast sushi subpar but lot VERY good chicken fried steak build your own omelet all breads     Mon Sat $15 person but Sunday $25 person not including drinks mimosas   Also during the holidays $25 person everyday which SUCKS    it disappointing cuz really only reason sleep Vegas wake morning MIMOSAS!!   Whenever lines very long all  <EOR> Their cocktail sauce best ever before used rock crab but didn't time settled shrimp but steamed crab butter die for! sugar free deserts cookies great coffee best even better Bellagio   Chinese food gross most buffets sushi looked old but smoked salmon roasted tomatoes freshest most tasty ever had! baked salmon also fantastic  pasta made order nice pizza only OK but service excellent  ate much burst never problem any buffet! <EOR> $20 lunch buffett pretty good especially nicer hotels   no crab legs prime rib   only outstanding thing dessert bar great selection  <EOR> Yummy! came right before leaving Vegas Sunday afternoon  tinkering machines pay entrance whisked inside  Hmmm    champagne brunch?
