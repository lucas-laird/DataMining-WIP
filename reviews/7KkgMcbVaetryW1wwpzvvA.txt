It great fast food large portions  seem fresh server friendly  gone many time alway good  burritos usually big only eat half save rest  am recommending all friends  choose want any items menu  <EOR> I used really place    But must say converted chipotle  Cafe rio much less healthy chipotle since am allergic gluten almost nothing gluten free menu  Even rice beans gluten them! no reason gluten rice beans  guess put lot extra stuff food  <EOR> Great place eat good food quick easy! All family loves it! <EOR> Had lunch Cafe Rio while waiting Laptop Exchange finish repair  pretty busy but liked atmosphere  Cozy casual comfortable  food great but see few times figure want your food  Also feels little rushed  why need know want before otherwise hold line up  far price goes   it reasonable  back  <EOR> Their burritos end soggy compared menu served didn't even come close  Workers bust butt ensure nobody waits long but quality food average fast food quality don't expect food epiphany  <EOR> This place always disappoints 2 hours before close always meats corn tortillas come 2 3 times week walk always think would know demand things maybe little more <EOR> This place okay  didn't wow anything  Just pretty run in the mill place opinion  way crowded liking  stood line 5 minutes before even order food  give bowl 2 3 times size chipotle but instead filling rice beans meat salad items skimp rice beans pound lettuce  shredded chicken good but nothing special  Honestly place okay but must try anything  <EOR> I prefer Cafe Rio over Chipotle Qudoba etc  feel quality food gone down little bit year ago  frequest location once week daughter little ladies lunch outting  Daughter loves Kids quesadilla  generally order salad  sells most both Coke Zero Diet Dr  Pepper  small addiction soda both types enjoy LOL  <EOR> I ordered online came into pay girl took money then turned around did something else  waited 5 minutes ask going order  She said being made another few minutes before food  What's point ordering online when food isn't ready when there? Also employees need communication training  might back  <EOR> Always great!!!!! Yummy!!! Never anything did like   Join card savings free buy 10  <EOR> This favorite place eat   sure order cilantro house dressing put whatever order   prefer pork over chicken steak   If order tostada soft tortilla perfect size version cafe Rio salad much smaller price point   regular size salads huge!  kids live place too  <EOR> I felt extremely rushed weren't even  busy when in  guy put chicken rice burrito barely put any then only asked if wanted lettuce said no thank he then passed girl working  asked sour cream it  She just wrapped up   not wanting rude didn't say anything just asked put some side me      asked two green sauces only gave one  asked second some major attitude  personally work customer service say last thing want customer feel interrupted doing especially when paying $9 burrito   I very dissatisfied <EOR> I've cafe rio multiple times always burrito everything apparently tonight allowed both black pinto beans? Well guess can't regular order anymore hopefully just location  <EOR> The food good awesome taste but fact 95% time rush thru line dont understand im telling them   gets nerves   Besides language barrier ive never seen place dirty least inside knw keep alot alot trash next back door  dont understand why its hard just take dumpster its right infront restaurant anyways!! <EOR> This place consistent   Food good   definitely weekly dinner stop family  <EOR> Sadly location going down hill fast   such rush even if no line don't listen your order just slop ingredients your plate prison line  beans salsas drained turns whatever eating into soup  <EOR> Their fired grilled chicken AMAZING! Along mild sauce! Love place!! favorite fast casual Mexican restaurant    even more chipotle    Crazy right?      I ordered somethings Cafe Rio never order again    if given place try didn't it    Try something different! Promise you'll became addict me! Ha! <EOR> Stopped first time today  If there's thing can't resist good plate Mexican food! Unfortunately disappointed almost go!   Service mediocre best  constantly let young lady helping know first time cafe rio she seemed more agitated then excited new customer  She really no help all  asked sour cream cheese pico burrito she said could only cheese because put oven  explained didn't want oven she basically said no choice  told just something since obviously don't understand order can't telling want  Instead offering assistance she looked relieved just made something    Not very good tasted microwaved honestly  Kinda sad    Basically experience food undesirable won't back  $20 burrito chips guacamole drink    Best part bottomless horchata!!  why gave star   dam good horchata too  ironically <EOR> Online ordering pointless because still end standing restaurant 20 minutes  Also when picking food failed read receipt ordered  gave bag only two items ordered  third time still messed order did give extra sides ordered  left because done sitting ended paying more actually got  Very unsatisfactory service  <EOR> Cafe Rio isn't bad  great prices punch card system where free meal 10 visits  only problem all employees food differently  Sometimes you'll much cheese while other times there's enough  would think would great place groups families  also different daily specials priced well  <EOR> First time eating there  over 10 employees behind counter no any direction  only 6 customers dining area already eating  only ones line rushing taking order   I stated first time didn't know things order here  still didn't patient change un needed speed sloppiness  Didn't even ask if wanted corn flour tortillas tacos  making food girl redo order bc wanted corn tortillas   Upon check guy didn't even say thank great day just rushed through transaction confused look face if burden something   WORST fast food experience very long time    I've experienced better customer service young boy Mc Donalds drive through himself literally taking making ringing orders long line cars behind front me  he still organized time thank tell great day smile face    Ps why NOW HIRING sign if o b v o u l y WHOLE staff behind counter!? all bad  someone should definitly take some leadership location  think all that  <EOR> Bad bad bad customer service  Came friend lunch yesterday both say thanks try convo cashier she just ignored us  Then found hair inside salad  Pretty much would say don't location  Won't back  <EOR> Worst service ever   Every other person handled order wrong then rolled eyes when asked them right way then then charged extra teaspoon guacamole regular portion cheese   Staff literally throwing food around then using filthy towels clean themselves   top off when later called speak manager she expressed zero interest actually fixing problems but instead kept insisting take voucher free burrito   didn't want free burrito   wanted restaurant polite competent staff manager cared fix problems staff  <EOR> A cut above other fast Mexican concepts Cafe Rio always favorite place mine eat at   When enter line first thing see fresh tortillas being made hand   While 3 4 spinning wheel getting delicious rest some form dough mixing blender partitioned lumps being prepared heat   end result always fantastic   The pork barbacoa signature meat its favorite most know eat regularly   very unique sweetness well any form choose salad burrito even nachos   really can't wrong other choices but pork barbacoa offers most memorable experience   They mild medium hot sauces your dish   mild basically salsa verde tomatillo fan its something opted often   medium oddly sweet but warm sauce hot your typical red     If side dish chips queso also very good   queso given very nice quantity along metric ton fresh chips aren't salty   Holds well if cheese still very hot when your table   If opt order extra meat entire staff yell Exxxxxxtra Meat!! which fun   My favorite meal would fire grilled steak burrito enchilada style extra meat  chips queso side   Mild sauce tomatillo day hot sauce flavor enhancer mood     They also offer loyalty punch card program if frequent free meals periodically which plus  <EOR> For amount money pay salad hoping better service  people working line friendly but cashier extremely rude unwelcoming kids I  better service save money going actual mexican restaurant  <EOR> Nobody crowded  Darn food Cafe Rio   Big servings wonderful flavor quality ingredients   freshly made tortillas beyond compare   just wonderful   If rate place purely food would 5 stars   Unfortunately knock off star other factors   First even though said big servings positive they're also negative   no idea single people eat here   wife always split meal because there's no way could each eat anything child's menu   Yet see bajillions young thin women meals bigger heads   no idea it   second negative prices high   Yes big servings excellent food made quality ingredients cost   But place where stand long line order your food eat aluminum bowl plate plastic utensils   Because always split single entree prices fine us   But again lone individuals think lot money but then old    Then there's environment place usually jammed people unbelievably loud   just uncomfortable place   So wonderful food few other factors knock down star   Still very good place eat  <EOR> Don't even call pick up! put your order last minute! wait till all customers line gone complete your order  JOKE! <EOR> Really good food  recommend getting burrito! choose want it  If near restaurant recommend going it!! <EOR> The only thing really salad grilled steak   pretty big shredded lettuce   Other everything else tried good Chipotle's offerings  <EOR> After reading several other reviews obvious just poor experience staff  first girl spoke nice enough but further down line staff just ruder ruder  No actually paying attention customers all talking each other back goofing off  young man checking end Venecia very rude  come very often but when staff location always terrible customer service would know also work customer service industry  Just note management improve your team's customer service just continue lose clients hard  <EOR> i Tuesday special coconut shrimp tacos mango sauce   Good portions   Sauces delicious   meat nice moist   tortillas tasty fresh    just careful because try add stuff if want guacamole extra sauce  don't tell some stuff extra  95 cents until ring cash register  <EOR> What disappointing visit  Employees distracted very slow  No ice machine  Put toppings didn't request meal  used location  However rally bad visit  <EOR> I  Tuesday special coconut shrimp tacos rice beans   good but wow !

Half time don't know whether you're going ordered! pretty fun game if must say myself  <EOR> There's only reason truly love Cafe Rio most amazing Salad meat Sweet Barbacoa paired creamy tomatillo dressing  There's nothing freshly cooked flour tortilla fresh crisp greens all fixings comes it!  The Sweet Pork Barbacoa perfectly balanced sweetness spices  generous amount meat salad well portioned  always omit beans rice but request more greens surely accommodation  greatly appreciated!  The service Centennial location always plus me  staff works hard speed line always order right  price pay salad no extras under $9 free refill drinks surely bargain  me!  weekly specials another added bonus! <EOR> I just say location always exceeds expectations  also add am very glad location area town worth few extra minutes way if means avoiding customer service abuse N  Decatur 215 location   Last week most recent visit  completely wow'd  making way home decide don't feel cooking call location place phone order 3 meals  Two problems though     I just picked furchild Camp Bow Wow sweltering hot outside  am going inside pick food?

Would recommend place anyone  <EOR> Hated it   don't know else say  never ever send food back  Maybe three times life  asked them remake burrito did  Which nice them but next just gross    I am fan  <EOR> Very average food  several items menu nothing stood out  horrible but places Zabas Chipotle similarly priced w better food no desire back here  <EOR> How people LOVE place!! Best ever!! All those hot sauces fresh made food friendly service  good  Yelpers outta your minds! <EOR> I haven't while but remeber everything being extra  salad no tortilla little Rice black beans ans asked if green sauce spicy said no asked little said extra        I like     okay      then asked else  usually use guacamole being extra asked little cheese  said extra salad  Well guess saved more calories  said no  lettuce times tastes bitter just happy  Later looked receipt home charged less  made being little annoyed felt going charge extra everything  really disappointed time  But won't turn away forever  <EOR> I love food great price amount food serve     What want manager Renzo  neighbor's daughter quit said others quit due sexual harassment manager  He  reported corporate office she said nothing happened  Does Cafe Rio allow behavior? If back! <EOR> This best cafe rio location town! all them depending side town running errands only consistently good  visit location once week during lunch rush even though line always really long staff does best keep line running smoothly  staff always friendly always order just it  <EOR> Pork barbacoa taco pinto beans rice side guac   nuf' said   crave this   a lot   kids two teens devour chicken nachos!  Great place if shopping running errands don't want drive thru   <EOR> I love Cafe Rio but today am impressed ever  home getting burritos eating bite into something solid instantly grossing out  pull mouth item isn't edible turns inch long piece cardboard  cardboard into burrito no idea but disgusting absolutely unacceptable  only ate quarter burrito before found cardboard just threw rest away  Beyond unsatisfactory Cafe Rio  <EOR> I lunch getting nails done  Chicken Tortilla Soup amazing good fill without making feel gross  <EOR> Placed online order   needed bad  ordered fire grilled nachos kids meal chicken quesodillo 8 Oz guacamole 8 Oz quesodillo  completely forgot guacamole queso didn't include any extras come kids meal  call Chris answers wait  When he comes back he hums hahs but can't figure solution  response come back next time refund asked if supposed just rely them future date  He also verified sides come kids meal lettuce Pico De gallo but then started should added them extras?!?! part meal but should ordered them separate? worse case incompetence ever seen  definitely never return ANY cafe Rio discourage others! <EOR> Love cafe rio  favorite spots hit lunch  Tortilla soup best  Whenever Yelsy always helps exemplary customer service  continue come back! <EOR> I tend more traditional Mexican food first couple times wasn't impressed but many friends love Cafe Rio gave more chance   day discovered Pork Barbacoa when did clouds parted rays sunshine poured down while harps lightly played   Really GOOD!  Since then pork salad burrito favorite enchiladas   far other meats they're good but outstanding service just average nothing stellar but bad either   also very crowded but pork worth all! <EOR> This location ok  often your order wrong because they're paying attention miscommunicate which cause wrong order  I'd recommend watching your order closely beginning end sure didn't accidentally switch someone else's   Other usual location compared other Cafe Rios  basically choose small menu items burritos tostadas salads nachos tacos then choose your veggies toppings  usually pork tostada w no tortilla rice black beans veggies house dressing   The line always long if come during prime lunch dinner hours! Sometimes line literally door! <EOR> New decor higher prices smaller portions  Employees don't listen turning your order into mess going through line phone! location turned dark side  going Decatur location near Costco now on  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised place! Texan always skeptical when Vegas relatives suggest Mexican food  portions big delicious! Also cheese dip salsa amazing! <EOR> I love Cafe Rio salads  never Chipotle again  Food delicious here  Food rating I'd give 5 stars  sweet pork barbacoa great new green chili pork great too  huge portion full flavor  getting mine wheat tortilla    However service would only give 3 stars  just renovated location since then service gone down  few times they'd some things salad because hour before closing wouldn't anymore  ok that  They've also specialty drinks  seems they're always something    also tried order online pick but never luck wirh them getting order correct  Now just order go  location gets super busy  waited line over half hour before  prepared if during dinner time  <EOR> Food always great buttttt       seen them super busy   tonight busy  placed order online ready pick 8 30  paid 8 32  20 minutes still waiting  could've stood line left 10 minutes ago  Frustrating when little baby home back to  What's point online orders? <EOR> Another great Cafe Rio location!  stopped dinner during vacation August ate outside patio dog   location very busy but staff handled rush well   enjoyed pork barbacoa enchiladas rice beans   so deliciously good! <EOR> I love salads !!

A must Las Vegas ! If Chipotle then love place less complicated chipotle better tasting food !!! 2 snaps twist likedididid lot!!!!!! <EOR> I mean Café Rio  know food going absolutely phenomenal each every time consume it  also know line going long slow  You've take good bad   I find line worth wait  if know you're heading should definitely just call ahead possible just grab your food even pick sit table  Removing stress entire situation  <EOR> My wife used live near cafe rio located near where Eastern met 215 always awesome food  Now live new place luckily found fairly close yet another cafe rio! Yay! real strange though seeing located such empty shopping center    such stark contrast other location which insane mind numbing experience when comes finding parking  surprising though considering such small lot some really awesome food spots    *ahem* Nelson's Frozen Custard anyone? Anyway back cafe rio! lol   Food pretty good though tend occasional errors     forgetting lime no guacamole etc  Never anything huge though if point politely them fix immediately without problem  Customer service always big thing probably things constantly brings back here  NEVER problem employees service always super kind helpful!   Our favorites salads typically without rice beans just ask extra lettuce pico  wife usually can't finish just barely squeek lol  Huge portions giant homemade flour tortillas very satisfying meal  Occasionally burrito if mood more carbs  hottest sauce put burritos isn't all strong if want something more spicy sure grab sauces next drinks extra kick pants  If want try something bit different though always try daily specials! Every day but sunday different unique item monday chile rellanos example won't find menu any other time  specials come drink included price    Lastly sure stamp card if plan coming back 10 stamps free meal plus drink! lol wife already 2 meals saved special occasion when REALLY broke! <EOR> So cafe rio lunch because coupon figured why now? pretty full tables but no line greeted nice Hispanic girl friendly professional  Ordered grilled chicken salad tortilla side she even asked if wanted cheese it! Cheese yes!!! She passed register girl also friendly showed coupon paid left! Great quick experience good staff working today! Food tastes great fresh very please! Thanks cafe rio! <EOR> No  authentic Mexican food  Did really expect be? don't obsession place either  chain extremely popular Utah everytime visit struggle see why    I consider place few notches below chipotle  here's why 1  wait  Cafe Rio does exact same thing Chipotle  burrito salad quesadilla  long does take throw some toppings silver bowl? most waited 5 min burrito Chipotle  Cafe Rio line 15 min before even order    2   blood pressure rises every time eaten here  say salty food?? rice pulled chicken  Lay off salt!!   3  Ok give extra star giving scoop guacamole  Including price good idea    4  much salad?! $8?! Wow  most expensive salad ever  think layering bottom bowl tortilla warrants extra $2 more chipotle salad?!  So basically expensive fast food joint where food so so  guess if aren't any other options it'll do   The service extremely slow  <EOR> I'm biggest fan but give 3 1 2 stars   I've heard before Café Rio puts Chipotle shame   Café Rio better Chipotle   Café Rio liiiiifffeeee! Okay didn't hear last one   but sure did see viral video Chipotle   way getting same thing   AN EXPENSIVE BURRITO   I Chipotle do   Doing right environment blah blah blah   Doing right consumer blah blah blah   Doing right carnitas blah blah blah   responsibility   appreciate it   appreciate overstuffed grilled chicken burrito   Sometimes just want change see else there   Hence mosey down Café Rio   Décor very Southwestern meets Latin unlike Chipotle more modern style   But ordering process very much same   See menu down factory style line choose your entrée meat beans cheese fillings extras then pay cashier   Café Rio Chipotle very similar aspect   order ASAP   more people process per hour more money make   Capitalism side guacamole it   This where much similarities end   food itself both places vastly different   come accustomed over years easy order process Chipotle   grown speed convenience   Café Rio easily much more choices menu but cost speed   Sometimes don't want wait long line   Café Rio lines long which takes time   appreciate many choices but almost seems more sit down restaurant fast casual joint   Food menu bit confusing Café Rio left bit pressured order quickly especially line building rapidly behind me     Of course ended going easier choice burrito fire grilled chicken   Burrito chicken black beans cilantro lime rice pico de gallo salsa fresca sour cream cheese extra lettuce then extra lettuce side   use round foil trays service well take out   Overall wasn't bad      It definitely missing something though couldn't put finger it   enough seasoning?  enough cilantro?  salsa choices Chipotle bit more flavor burrito Café Rio ended somewhat bland   OK     But know pi$$ed off most food?  price!  already $7 79 burrito but extra DOLLAR chicken  thrown grill?   $8 79 before tax!  Chipotle gives just hearty burrito $6 95   friends big difference me   quality burrito Café Rio does equate extra $1 84 least opinion   Wifey taco meal which included rice beans but didn't impress much   kids salad which actually very good because comes tortilla underneath more taco salad see Taco Bell but again price kinda kills it   $8 49!  But give props tasty cilantro lime vinaigrette tangy sweet   other kid meat quesadilla off kid's menu but didn't fill up   She ended sharing food us   ordered side tortilla chips salsa guacamole share table   Chips guacamole great very fresh   On plus side Café Rio stands drink department over Chipotle   Coca Cola everyone!  Plus partake more traditional drinks horchata which pretty good all included     To sum Café Rio isn't bad but far favorite fast casual place   food OK but prices much high end scale ends being comparable eating sit down restaurant   would come if really needed change pace Chipotle but didn't want grease Del Taco Taco Bell  <EOR> Cafe Rio Centennial 2017 Yelp Review #237 I gave In N Out Lent   know means  means eating more chicken salmon   Café Rio both   meals Café Rio couple servings Fire'd Grilled Chicken w Cheese couple sides Salmon   Don't expect much salmon filets   usually over cooked lot nutrients visibly cooked off   Taste wise okay   usually stick just chicken cheese  dish very good sure beats chicken breast home   also healthier burrito substituting white tortilla wheat   just skip starches protein beast   ordering process simple quick   lines rarely long staff efficient   am fan Café Rio   lifesaver during Lent  <EOR> I live location but tonight stopped buy dinner 7 45 closed  No signage early closure  least place next them said closed Easter  <EOR> It hit miss   son loves but personally prefer Chipotle   son ordered Tostada all times   cousin ordered kid quesadilla but now stopped coming because sick food here  They lot turn over some servers now some don't  Check your receipts too  <EOR> It really isn't great high praised people seem  expensive little food give you  give little food hella lettuce look big full but really isnt lot  Youll full off lettuce alone even then theres little rice beans you'll able eat too  Its very loud incredibly crowded busy  If nachos seems only thing actually give lot of  <EOR> Love Cafe Rio!!!!
