Let preface review saying did eat here   did eat because upon arrival host wasn't stand when came but wait several minutes appear just walked said flatly There's no room here  We're full  mother sister all well dressed very presentable stared shock rudeness he said trivia tonight there's soccer game  place indeed very full come hoping play trivia and 20 minutes early trivia but better ways handle such merely being nice potential customers   Needless say total turnoff ever try coming back place  <EOR> You going traditional Irish pub Vegas just going happen  would saying Venetian feel just floating down canal Italy New York New York Big Apple your eye  Hell if true could all just flock Vegas come home saying traveled world   and save lot airfare process  No possibility    What Vegas suggestions small glimpses places actually exist done bright lights dash tacky facade real thing might slightly resemble    The farther away strip less inherent qualities since bit way McMullan's bad rendition Irish Pub  pour good Guinness few places carries Magners Vegas many menu items traditional pub fare  however seem many establishments Vegas trying hard overdoing bit    Nice switch glitter glam strip priced more local friendly variety bands most every night week  bad place but if want true Irish pub Ireland would good place look  <EOR> Enjoyed Farmhouse Irish Breakfast which consisted eggs sausage Irish bacon baked beans grilled tomato breakfast potatoes  Delicious food coffee delicious  server very friendly worked b*** off  Unfortunately she only serving if needed anything wait bit  also took while before cooks prepared food    I didn't give 5 stars because service wasn't best because restroom needed much attention  paper towels overflowing trash The food delicious but expect slow service mornings clean restrooms    UPDATE Visited restaurant second time food delicious once again but time service outstanding  nice hidden gem Las Vegas! way place open 24 7! <EOR> What cute fun place! Reminds much authentic little pub Ireland  tables small give such homey feel  great atmosphere!  The food delicious! ordered half portion Irish nachos   great 5 7 people  large would seriously need party 8 more  mini would perfect 3 5 people! would recommend getting extra bacon them meats give little more flavor!   The fish chips chicken Florentine shepherds pie steak mushroom pie incredible! fairly large party 6 adults 2 kids shared four entrees  portions HUGE well worth it! even leftovers!  The servers kind helpful  service itself slower side  waited long time drinks appetizer food dessert  wasn't super busy when ended being 2 hours  slow experience which might good thing since food good heavy   For dessert sticky toffee pudding chocolate cake! Both absolutely wonderful! <EOR> Fantastic food! look forward hitting place every time town  live entertainment which pretty good kindly seated side room where slightly less loud could even enjoy it! Seriously order some Irish foods won't disappointed  told Irish Nachos which didn't it late but told integral experience guess next time  <EOR> The food amazing!  never disappointed anything ordered   service other hand great   place quick bite we're usually least hour because service  only dinner time though may quicker lunch   9 times 10 they're very friendly either  Seem more fun each other bothering patrons   John  Windsor hilarious talented though would definitely recommend place weekend  Darby O'Gill Little People plays often lot fun too! food entertainment definitely where service lacking  <EOR> Went last week before Wranglers game because close arena because fellow Yelpers gave high marks   As usual Yelpers true word   Great Pub!  Low lighting dark wood great beer boisterous group lots memorabilia = Good Irish ambiance   What's even better Smoking side Non Smoking side  We started Irish Sausage Rolls    YUM!

My stew hearty savory big chunks lamb   brown bread perfect dipping stew   companions' curry also very good without being overly curry ie   Theirs served Jasmine rice might expect curry might be   think base curry same stew think  why liked as am curry fan    Service spot on!  All All GREAT meal quick tasty filling   definitely going back McMullan's before Wranglers game again  <EOR> OH MAN! Returned medium Irish Nachos beef  good much food ate until button jeans flew off nearly took wife's good eye! <EOR> My friend lives Vegas suggested McMullan's when picked date drinks catch up  She arrived few minutes before did she bar getting drink  ended grabbing large tables back room since group 6 she friend brought Vegas crew     Drinks super affordable if you're during happy hour which appetizers very cheap too  Irish nachos which basically hand cut potato chips mountain cheese sour cream  really really good but such huge portion couldn't finish between 4 us    They also live music we Friday night 10 30pm which nice  bit far Strip but just means less touristy! <EOR> Shepards pie amazing   Fish Chips pure money definately start warm curry chips   waitress Irish which really added ambiance   only caution give Guinness close fresh tasted side Atlantic down very easy   few nights live authentic Irish folk music   twice 4 days Vegas  <EOR> Thanks Pokemon found hidden gem near me  always gone happy hour deals great 1 2 off appetizers $1 off drafts think  also beer flight $5    Hands down best lemon pepper wings EVER had  Granted only wings few places including Buffalo Wild Wings wingstop but wings come super hot crispy outside very well seasoned  Plus 12 wings $6 7 during happy hour  But sure count your wings because last two times 1 2 wings short  didn't catch first time until almost finished entire plate but notified server second time same thing happened  server apologized brought missing wings    Irish nachos ok ordered half order  Full order HUGE  potato chips again very hot came bunch cheese sour cream  wasn't fan cheese but enjoyed chips  However probably won't order them again   Fish chips sisters favorite but felt fries inconsistent  Depending cooking could overly salty soggy  way sister BF enjoyed them  downside don't give enough tartar sauce!   It's pretty dark crowd kind loud but expect? love looking all decorations  Service great good specials entrees well  <EOR> McMIllan's best Irish Pubs ever well atleast until finally Ireland then all bets off     The food McMullans really really good usually opt Irish Nachos homemade potato chips covered cheese bacon sour cream but time opted full meal    Every day 4 7 happy hour which includes $1 off draughts well drinks well small assortment apps $2 99 but wanted give winter menu try  I know old review blog moving bunch them over here}  There 3 things debating between Shepard's Pie Irish Stew Meatloaf then noticed Irish sampler included both pie stew plus corned beef cabbage decided give try   I wondering all 3 would served didn't want them mix together anything then brought out  came big plate each entree ramaken looked amazing  first Corn Beef Cabbage am huge fan usually but beef carrots broth amazing big fan cooked cabbage few pieces good but didn't finish all  Next Irish Stew huge chunks potato carrot celery beef if great brown gravy hands down favorite night then time Shepard's pie better worse wasn't anything write home but then again could spoiled stew it good!!!

In addition appetizer menu items regular menu pretty damn tasty well  love Grilled Blackened Chicken sandwich which provides pretty filling meal $9   For most part service place pretty good  couple bartenders less talkative others but most everyone rather friendly    I recommend avoiding place Friday nights loud particularly great band plays covers all night Darby O'Gill Little People   Other you're golden! <EOR> we stop bar 3 times week work reason crack head Jason he favorite bartender super funny  He treats every single guest respect comps much he allowed  He works weekends late night shift   The only healthy choice pub salmon meal   everything else fish chips type food  would give them another star if big screen instead bunch small screen TV which best watch game   <EOR> My favorite every other Friday happy hour hang out!

We McMullans finding nothing worthwhile inside Orleans Hotel dinner   assumed would just typical pub food but once started looking menu hard time deciding order  Every item menu sounded delicious  eventually settled Grand Irish Rueben which indeed delicious red onion relish came really help set itself apart typical Rueben sandwiches    This most impressive thing place buddy ordered  He Irish Monster Burger which pound Ground Top Sirloin burger cheese lettuce tomatoes pickles bacon onion rings 1000 Island Dressing  also comes abnormally large sized bun  challenged buddy eat whole thing surprisingly he did    This truly better Irish Pubs definitely come back next time am town  <EOR> We big group reservation put own room  server Chris quick water drink orders all trickled awesome splitting bill each family  Bits Fish very good plenty food lunch! Batter light greasy  Fries point  Texas BBQ Burger very tasty char burger  Easy cool bar scene music some nights  I'd back! <EOR> Great place come drinks apps friends!I love Irish Nachos! <EOR> I invited eat cute boy met same night  irish nachos tasty ambience chill super late evening company amazing  Five starts no question  <EOR> We came no meat Friday parking lot packed even early dinner  located next Orleans  outside looks your old plain ordinary bar but when dining area cozy  being your Irish grandma's home yup making up   I obviously don't Irish grandma  seats plush   They Guinness Smithwick's Kilkenny Harp   and imports such Chimay Crabbie's Ginger Beer Wells Banana Bread Beer  Yum!  All ordered fish chips  good  best ever  Huge portions too  batter perfectly light crisp  fries weren't seasoned season away  fish fries weren't greasy gross    We also ordered sticky toffee pudding but didn't try I'd come back lent  <EOR> I ended coming see Georgia Bulldogs play while Vegas  place pretty nice your typical Irish bar but noticed lack windows establishment  decor pretty nice lot Irish flags various counties   If you're bulldog stand place watch Georgia game actually own room where actually hear game  portions rather large although service little slow    I tasted Irish nachos potato chips instead corn chips which very good plentiful  also ordered Scotch eggs  first time trying this  hard boiled egg rolled sausage various Meats breaded deep fried  very flavorful quite substantial would definitely order again   I also best Irish coffee ever served glass goblet delicious cream powdered some cinnamon shape shamrock beautiful sight see   Usually impressed Irish bars but definitely impressed one  enjoyed food atmosphere definitely really fun place hang watch game  <EOR> The decor really great   quite few different places sit bar tables stools few booths really private alcoves then different seating areas bench type seats regular chairs groups   also some outdoor seating prepared winter chills upright heaters   live music pretty regularly   is    sure one man band called Finnegan's Wake   last band saw did some pretty cool Van Morrison Flogging Molly covers   I know blasphemy drink Irish pub but don't drink all can't really rate drinks   heard friends Guinness tap good Irish Coffee ok   Bit o' Beers which run $5 sampler of    think 5 beers   3 kinds but beers listed all can't substitute anything   similar offerings whiskey always beer special $4 pint   I start chips   homemade come two different sauces   rosemary favorite but curry isn't bad either   Irish nachos but basically just nachos potato chips instead tortilla chips   Ground beef cheese potato Irish staples which could better ways   In winter favorite dish Beef Guinness Stew   Unfortunately seasonal currently being offered   saucy stew obviously tender vegetables course course potato   If aren't sure dinner entree called Aon Tri which if say loud Two Three Irish accent   sampler Corned Beef Cabbage Diddy's Irish Stew Shepherd's Pie   Quite good exception Irish Stew which found bit bland     I enjoy fish chips sure ask Heinz Malt Vinegar side  Crispy fish crispy french fries   meaning try Reuben but comes onion relish something know feel onions   My friend slice chocolate cake dessert birthday rich decadent delicious     The reason doesn't 5 5 because service   servers nice orders come correctly but sometimes insanely slow   nights where wasn't crowded nights where walking through crowd couldn't tell if really packed getting groped   Although doesn't happen every time occasions regardless crowd where meal taken insanely long time   don't mind because friends no problems chit chatting but if hurry less easy going it'd frustrating   last experience made reservation least week prior 7 00 birthday party came find when arrived tables given away   didn't actually seated until 8 00 they put outside sit wait where pretty hot   assume owner came apologized but nothing really done compensate appetizers ordered didn't until almost 9 00 food took forever come once ordered   assume because packed Friday night but jeez wait really something else   continue when Irish food craving bites but sure Friday night   shudder think wait times St  Patty's Day  <EOR> Simplicity way McMullan's  few friends stooped happy hour since few offer Sunday  Without further delay announce happy hour 7 days week 3 6    The savings drink since beers averaged six
