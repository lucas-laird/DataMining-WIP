Silk Road shares area Benihana sushi restaurant well  Each areas defined but all fairly common area  Just vision restaurant outside enough tantalize into entering experience meal   My friend fairly early dinner evening promptly seated lovely table overlooking lovely waterway below  very accommodating friendly waiter promptly greeted brought requested beverages  giving time choices menu he took order  chosen shrimp tempura appetizer friend chosen noodle soup pork belly  both chosen split almond chicken meal steamed rice   The tempura shrimp which accompanied vegetables asparagus sweet potato zucchini mushroom delightful  can't recall if three four shrimp but wonderful   My friend delighted soup  took taste but just wasn't cup tea pardon pun   really nothing wrong but just wasn't realm favorite flavors   The almond chicken WONDERFUL! both totally enjoyed agreed flavor excellent   Our waiter extremely attentive friendly  service total 5 stars!  So ask why didn't rate Silk Road five start? earned four stars because all food came time which created issue where impossible proceed through appetizer almond chicken without them becoming cold before dinner complete  would earned 3 stars but waiter flavor food brought 4   Silk Road thank good dining experience please educate your chefs timing sending food your patrons definitely help your reviews  <EOR> OK Vegas nothing real here  But Asian Bistro take fake Asian food whole new level fake   bento box dare say no Japanese recognize such   Mine Kung Pao Chicken  Really?  Japanese?  price Vegas level $25 plus tax   If option somewhere else  <EOR> Stayed resort convention gave place try  ambience restaurant nice Asian theme  servers really nice well  seated right way speed service just right  However satisfied food  Chinese expect clay pot ordered cooked traditional way  received just sautéed vegetables fish put clay container  vegetables fresh salmon quality good yet cooking skill there  <EOR> We sushi   Service super slow   Sushi didn't taste fresh   wasn't even busy  Looks tourist trap convention people   Definitely worth price   <EOR> Meh friend came restaurant  located Westgate former Las Vegas Hilton around 8 Thursday night dinner   hungry sushi hanging wall next entrance Silk Road there's full sushi menu   Perfect!  We hostess station stood waiting talking few minutes before someone finally stopped ask if wanted seated then waited few more minutes before being seated no line could see number open tables inside place sure why wait?    We seated drink orders taken given menus   problem no sushi?!  buddy back check sure enough sushi menu entrance   When server returned drinks asked if sushi menu she said no separate restaurant within same general space contains noodle bar Benihana sushi place  OK? We'd already ordered drinks able find few dishes liked Silk Road's menu decided stay   We ordered app ordered wagyu beef dish main course   While food good must say service absolutely dreadful all night  took forever server take food orders appetizer delivered same time main courses when wanted second round beverages wait few minutes before could flag down server then several minutes later ask someone else dinks obvious server forgotten us   When time bill pay again took forever     IMO place good great outstanding service night nonexistent  <EOR> Delicious food seated right away great service absolutely gorgeous atmosphere!  mother daughter dinner but would fantastic romantic celebration  originally tried into Benihana but fully booked night  very glad chose Silk Road instead! <EOR> Not sure where some other reviewers ate but restaurant located inside Westgate resort flat awful   Also should note rarely post Yelp unless food great food awful   if its middle road don't think its determine whether someone should try restaurant   with being said     I made major mistake eating lunch Silk Road Asian Bistro  would think other buffet restaurants some pretty decent but most food fairly vanilla cheap casino restaurants would fairly high end    this possibly worst Asian food experience ever had    The waitress hostess very nice served fairly quickly considering packed lunch  Then all down hill    The egg rolls showed up   nice toasty warm outside   cold ice inside   They brought replacement order which very nice them crisp outside much inside they obviously frozen variety ordered Chicken Lo Mein main dish   if large pile mushy over cooked noodles rubbery chicken very little taste then place you  half cost lunch soda tip just under $50 could ordered decent take family 4  very disappointed love Asian food eat least once week  <EOR> Excellent Asian cuisine inside Westgate hotel  Take advantage monorail system if staying btw  Because pretty far off main part strip! But actually because bit quieter  Anyways back restaurant   we came because Benihana's next door only took reservations  took chances came here  red lanterns ceiling   nice touch! ordered Wagyu beef baby corn broccoli steamed rice oyster sauce  Very delicious filling meal  friends lo mein another friend ordered chicken pho which looked absolutely scrumptious came piping hot  manager kept checking she very friendly  bar adult beverages well  Overall excellent service great atmosphere! Also some best Asian food quite some time! <EOR> The atmosphere dimly lit medium noise Asian inspired    Staff wonderfully polite ready help any way possible    Food reasonably priced above average taste  Waygu Beef Pho highlight me  sure ask your server side hot sauces hot oil rep pepper sauce sriracha add some more depth   dishes fresh point  spring rolls also great   This little gem must when visiting Westgate! <EOR> We come state many times year service impeccable   always come duck but no longer menus gm way duck entire party   General Manager Donna Meyers outstanding asset  hotel   She way continually offer spectacular customer service made entire party comfortable perfect overall experience  She table numerous times  major casino players people definitely want continue eat Benihana Silk Road  <EOR> Well disregarded negative reviews came because convenience  Unfortunately lived negatives then some  First server took appetizer order  long wait another server came take dinner order if original server never come  said already ordered appetizer she said would come  Dinner came instead yet another server  Then asked appetizer finally came stone cold  Dinner hot but edible  Rice side only half full asked more rice since sparse  He brought bowl full but then charged $6 even tho he never mentioned additional charge  Finally appetizer came hot dinner well underway  No manager ever came check sending food back either   Service hotel fantastic but restaurant does follow same customer service model  bad because restaurant low point otherwise very nice stay Westgate  <EOR>
