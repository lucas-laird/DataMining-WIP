Perhaps location intentionally limits coffee drive customers faster   I dunno why else restaurant would tight w coffee   Oh location doesn't participate $ 99 pastry add w breakfast sandwiches Wi Fi ULTRA SLOW just another reason skip location all together! <EOR> I tried soup salad last week good gave some bread dip soup  Delicious! Clean friendly ready when pick up  back again  <EOR> Didn't eat just wanted use restroom  eaten other locations chain   However 1st impressions matter mens bathroom smelled whoever cleaned run detergent also opted dirty water mop bucket instead clean  any case made wonder other short cuts half attempts made elsewhere business  <EOR> First off  food very good worth 4 5 stars price quality   service 3 stars  low grade cleanliness  No table wiped many covered spilled food  kitchens very messy  empty boxes used rubber gloves food paper towels all over floor  counters mess well  restaurant wasn't busy overwhelmed either   place little over half full  really need clean up  <EOR> I given panera multiple chances every time come am disappointed feel waste money  outside patio tables always filthy dirty dishes lettuce always wilted don't even dress sandwiches correctly never fail mess order  <EOR> Another great location  service friendly fast  place also clean well kept  location better patio outdoor seating areas encountered  Another plus location Boca Park which opinion nicest areas city  Highly recommend  <EOR> Unfriendly unhelpful employees location very odd other Panera locations  <EOR> They slammed food timely manner  New chicken tortilla soup diverse flavorful shredded chicken strips bell peppers think lime also bought caramel apple thumbprint pastry breakfast tomorrow!

Cafe prices food here  cheap place sandwich if comparing Subway but flavor quality food good gets opinion  Panera TWICE different locations food served consistently  Cashiers know menu helped choose items  Paninis crispy warm loaded chicken  YUMMY  I ordered Pick 2 which runs $7 95 I think   Choosing Signature option add $1 combo  French Onion soup Frontega Chicken which signature option  Worth it  $1 cheaper lunch combo sandwich soup salad other places Yard House anyway   Feeling fancy breakfast brunch but dont' want sit down menu type restaurant? Panera instead ] <EOR> I dropped last night satisfy late craving panini   Fontana Chicken panini first time   tasted chipotle mayo chicken cheese don't know else but sure satisfied craving   going new favorite sandwich Panera     I almost made clean away but while waiting sandwich Chocolate Duet Walnut cookies began calling name   louder louder   wanting scene restaurant decided submit call Chocolate Duet Walnut cookies took home two huge cookies sort resembled brownies   MMM semisweet chocolate chunks white chocolate chips gasp!  managed just eat 1 2 freeze rest later   But omg decadent   mean some things just don't need know about   But once taste cookies lid off Pandora's box!  haha  Everything great Panera like?  Moderation            Can't wait visit sit outside friend! <EOR> I love panera already but employees location super nice always big smiles faces  Also manager above helping staff clear tables <EOR> Hawaii does lot Mac n Cheese places jump opportunity eat when mainland  white Mac n Cheese hot AWESOME!!!

Crap service over priced food  Better portions would help <EOR> Long lines Panera Bread unattractive place eat   busy Saturday restaurant only 1 check stand open   Restsurant finally opened second check stand but really needed third check stand   manager really needs more top it!  Otherwise food atmosphere pretty good servers efficient  <EOR> Cold soup absolutely filthy conditions those really highlights     I say food usually above average but particular location entirely skippable   If try because you'll stick seats if don't   Unless your kitchen home dirtier then feel free enjoy slime here   Also if helpful no functioning highchairs when visited  <EOR> I cannot understand location always busy  chain restaurant quality isn't bad but place way visit  BF's craving soup prompts most visits   Their pick two lunch specials good value pair anything white cheddar steak sandwich you're pretty much guaranteed least half way satisfying meal  bread bowls huge carby indulgence well priced $6 best clam chowder broccoli cheddar    Service okay  Line seems move slowly nice use GPS beepers bring meal your exact table but several tables dirty patrons clear trash leave place set encourage people bussing own tables but should still staff around wiping down didn't see happening  few seating options rush  <EOR> Meh  First things first parking horrible  Panera crowded strip Boca Park which always busy  came around 6 30 Wednesday evening  ordered Asian chicken salad  young girl took order nice she asked name said would let know when order ready  short time later she started expediting orders did call any names thus resulting getting wrong food  Why did even ask name if weren't going use it? quickly remade salad but all all ended taking over 30 minutes food which okay    The salad pretty basic  chicken crispy wonton strips sesame dressing  dressing very good but enough it  can't say any reason come back here  <EOR> out souffle 10 am  but gotta give props bringing breakfast table which pretty cool  Food same any other Panera  bigger stores lot square footage very interesting decor  Very clean looking staff appears quite attentive  <EOR> Decided try Panera Bread lunch   heard great things guess expectations where high   Parking nightmare   waited line order   soup salad drink   First disappointment no Coke products only Pepsi   Second disappointment Pepsi order   unsweetened black tea very cloudy tasted old   sat table instructed waited food delivered   girl delivered food asked silverware   She said your food l left   All plastic spoon   No fork knife salad   but could find silverware   waited counter silverware finally given metal fork plastic knife   employee seemed irritated asked silverware   sat back down eat but then could find salt pepper   looked salt pepper but could find any   again waited counter ask where salt pepper   finally helped told under soft drink machine   salad soup good when finally eat them   However service awful employees encountered stressed rude   recommend Panera Bread return   Zupas much better experience less money  <EOR> This place hot mess lately! usually don't review franchises businesses   But ran bowls single cups baked potato soup use plastic spoons metal forks same meal staff always confused place always mess   What's going on?! <EOR> Dirty gloomy  bring myself even sit down dirty place  Employees must mistreated badly no gives crap irregardless treatment  Draining even thinking write review  Yuck  <EOR> This Panera just opened prime location Boca Park   no stranger Panera having made many visits during time grad student back east  pick 2 deal always satisfying pick any combo half sandwich soup salad extra $0 99 add cookie   baked goods dry side which little disappointing tea selection use few more herbal options   Service friendly if bit slow staff mainly comprised looked high school students??

Good place walk pick pastries drink but dining in may worth reconsideration  <EOR> Great service great location  food consistent other locations 4 stars  Would nice patio more trees bit doesn't  Patio bit close traffic  <EOR> It's while since eaten Panera Bread bummed when learned Turkey Artichoke Panini discontinued Pick Two combo might well kid's meal    Maybe isn't case other Panera Breads but sandwich tiny   recommended Roasted Turkey Avocado BLT substitute Turkey Artichoke  Can't say fan  held toppings but then again much fit two tiny pieces bread? also ordered Caesar salad  Definitely did receive more salad sandwich  If there's lesson learned experience order full sandwich rather going Pick Two  boyfriend ordered Italian Combo Sandwich looked more real meal rather snack    The service fine restaurant much more spacious other Panera Breads visited    Overall won't returning location  <EOR> The parking always rough but tomato soup worth it  paired half sandwich salad happy camper  always found funny choice apple bread side  Especially when order sandwich  Some food dog but enjoy baked goodies! <EOR> A great place grab lunch during week some work computer good food good environment  <EOR> I am fan Panera Bread whole support feeding hungry donating end day inventory supporting non profits  don't very much because am trying cut down carbs but kill 2 hours before hair appointment next door   I ordered Ham Cheese sandwich which served very soft wheat bread  Soft good because tooth issue can't bite into anything hard another week   They offer two side choices  apple piece hard crust baguette  asked substitution because teeth would bend  Setting aside apple option right mind would order full sandwich which 4 pieces bread side crusty bread  Maybe soup but side offering no sense  <EOR> Went today during lunch rush understand busy but ordered salad name number wasn't called  young associate actually looked bag looked bag walked away  finally counter said oh yeah  your order  baffled why associate didn't ask if order when clearly standing right front holding number  Big fail train your employees better service  guy took order great star front house service  <EOR> This location awful! eat location again  ordered Fugi apple chicken salad minus cheese nuts tomatoes  looking forward apple chips salad  didn't tell out  also butter apples chips side  must nearly chicken because needed magnifying glass find chicken salad  don't think ounce chicken salad  If buyout Panera Bread anything all problems then count good  eat Panera several times week  Also never added points card last 3 times ate gave them correct phone number look info  gives Panera? very very unhappy customer! no longer recommend Panera  <EOR> Ordered corn chowder bread bowl which pretty good   Love soups seating  Service fast friendly   Would come back again location  <EOR> Nice location large eating area  Very friendly staff always food came fast  Wasn't thrilled roast beef sandwich however  Even horseradish which must've weakest stuff around bland sandwich  other sandwiches other locations much better saying location sucks just particular day sandwich sucked! Tomato bisque creamy called it tasty wasn't really hot enough  Good thing incredible baguette save day! <EOR> When did Panera take such horrific nose dive? used chain quality ingredients everything fresh    somewhere along way stopped caring   I dropped quick lunch hair appt salon next door  starving  Took more 15 minutes simple to go order no changes completely menu turkey sandwich apple side bowl broccoli cheddar soup baguette  no store wasn't busy   When home opened bag found rotted apple talking visibly rotted just bruised oozing spot dents all over rest fruit  sat aside  Unwrapped sandwich sloppily assembled WET  mean turkey sickly gray color could've wrung soggy  disgusting inedible fear very likely could've made sick   The soup bread if you're wondering fine but certainly nothing write home definitely worth price   I complained Panera didn't even bother apologize  Instead said they'd send treat which questioned further $10 Panera rewards card don't even have  $10 towards $20+ purchase rotted food  Here's hint apology serving someone slop long way  Pretend care  polite thing do   Panera lot learn customer service food quality  suggest some training your staff maybe colorful chart detailing apple should look like  mean should'n't tell turkey isn't meant look waterlogged insulation but hey maybe your carelessness cause epidemic health dept explain words understand namely FAIL   <EOR> Ah Panera!
