Price good compared quality customer service super fast great! definitely when comes eating sushi! <EOR> Was told theres wait 15 mins ended waiting almost hour because skip name call other first same amount parties  No apology anything    First time last time there  speak manager why because service BS  <EOR> First all spelling mistakes already turn off  specials board stated salmon cappacio  stripped bess  When entered no greeting  sat down menu  mean busy no reason why could two menus automatically but ask  First time waiter did explain anything just threw menu table walked away  two menus clearly says AYCE but other did not  regular menu? no idea  when another waitress came told first time she said ok  Thanks welcome explanation AYCE  ask found everything other menu included but weird because curry plates alcohol don't think all included  She just said all included  true because regular drinks tea even included  Within few minutes sitting down heard people behind ask where all items waitress sounded clueless them even ordering those items said she would put in  said already waited long time just wanted stood left  Another turn off original waiter coughed hand two times then pick plates serve food  ask wash hands  Could why rest night downhill but heard cough forearm wash your hands since serving food?  waitress no personality did half orders follow many times when reminded she did apologize even seem she aware she made mistake  Maybe twin sister ordered from    My friend asked Yelp review would since she knew few dishes  actually felt 3 stars said let tell more dishes  Well end down 0 stars me    Out all items ordered slow times recap each other ordered missing  Most fish came time plate  Would more sense if put bunch nigiri plate maybe could keep track sent some other system since does work    Quite few raw fish pieces looked throw away pieces  took team put mouth tough large slices looked through garbage disposal  Uni off color friend said taste bad  Some fish would come plate all different colors but same fish  consistent  Ocean trout soaked sauce rice fell apart pick fish  asked majority items without sauce except yellowtail yuzu since yuzu  When yellowtail plain no jalapeno no sauce but wanted sauce yellowtail  told them seemed angry but did order regular because yuzu  never salmon cappacio many other orders  ask clear never put somehow lost because waitress would write down again    About sashimi salad different both times ordered it  time good very light ponzu sauce tempura  second order heavier overpowering dressing which strong tempura gone    Waiters really odd no customer service skills all  tall guy never spoke word waitress perfect candidate Clueless waiter wreaked cigarette smoke would throw food slide plate table whisk away quickly  did encounter friendly all together rare waiter but until end  He best all them wish whole time  only second day    I but summary food good all service terrible     The only part whole meal liked salmon belly salmon  super white tuna also different but liked it  hope hire some better staff work bringing all orders well timeliness otherwise don't see them lasting   We over 3 hours enjoyed time friend but should take 3 hours bring things ordered week night  <EOR> Sushi really good but omg service incredibly slow Wednesday night  slow review borderline 2 stars  sister came last before 7pm didnt leave until almost 9  When first maybe 5 other tables 3 servers  thinking servers shift ended its down 2 servers within 10 minutes lot people come eat  first all nigiri comes very fast but waited super long rolls  forget some apps 2 rolls ordered  point full annoyed care   Our server never came back check tell busser  Ask check dessert only bring dessert forget sisters  Idk if should feel bad understaffed server almost 10 tables but should least bussers start taking orders   I felt sorry table next us  done all food time entered waited 20 minutes check dessert  Overall come lunch  Dinner price wait isnt worth it  Everything good except salmon nigiri which tasted flavorless  <EOR> This first time AYCE sushi place pretty bomb! place empty when stopped because they've only open 2 weeks  Great decorations good sushi considering only $27 per person 80 minutes eat    The service slow  so slow dampened hunger But since place empty let stay past 80 min  Love generous fish rice ratio! Highly recommend salmon belly no  1 chef best best sashimi roll double dragon   Important note sushi roll but don't that! They'll just serve same rolls served AYCE crowd  made mistake convert AYCE first roll came out  small!   Note eat raw fish am hate sushi sashimi being Americanized having lots sauce  I sauce  complaint some fish pieces came icy hadn't thawed all way through  would just dock half star but Yelp won't let that  <EOR> Favorite AYCE sushi place Vegas hands down   A few co workers tried place when first opened probably 2016 loved it! don't know why but fallen off hadn't eaten while   Last month boyfriend craving sushi came back least once week since! fish rice portions nigiri absolutely ridiculous in best way possible   fish tastes fresh  favorites lemon salmon white tuna albacore! boyfriend only gets rolls favorites Lobster King Popcorn Lobster    The variety desserts really them unique! mini honey toast perfect size tastes great  also tried green tea ice cream tiramisu mochi affogato birthday cake!

They're really good if you    know    them        Salmon Tuna Garlic Tuna Cajun Tuna Nigiri Salmon just OK nothing really great  In all sushi places never disappointed any variation Tuna Garlic Cajun Regular but Sushi Neko managed impossible    regular tuna just bland soggy pretty hard finish  Cajun Garlic Tuna or should say Cajun Tuna Garlic Ponzu Tuna equally bad only fish really chewy but DRENCHED sauce which made even more unenjoyable    Salmon Belly Limited 2 orders per person pretty much best thing Sushi Neko IF it  Very fatty juicy flavorful just Salmon Belly should HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  Fish Rice ratio very good    Other food being mediocre service some worst experienced well  guys started serving great Carlos knew everything menu very friendly helpful  Halfway into dinner he replaced Lady very bad attitude helpful any way strangely enough around time orders stopped showing fast stopped showing all total missing 7 orders  Carlos stayed I'd give Sushi Neko 4 stars  Very unlikely coming back anytime soon Sushi Neko still new give them some time overcome growing pains before try again  <EOR> Wow  place amazing!

Apparently quite few Vegas but alas only time one   This fantastic! glad ended coming here  came early Wednesday afternoon no problem getting table in fact when arrived just before 5 PM only people    The service bit odd  Despite being only people being 2 servers seemed preoccupied  also seemed much language barrier speaking barrier  difficult understand servers because weren't very clear explanations mumbled spoke softly could barely hear them  first confused included AYCE deal  turns EVERYTHING menu! some items where limit table ordering per person  also BOGO alcohol  took advantage ordered sake  ok but $10 2 bottles complaining   We ordered ton rolls!! good come group people order bunch things try everything  others mentioned good job fish rice ratio actually enjoy fish instead just stuffing yourself rice  Additionally rolls come smaller portions which ideal trying bunch things  example some baked rolls only 4 pieces  weren't really sure since servers would bring dishes then whisper mumble names rolls  Regardless nearly everything fantastic   The few standout ones names actually heard were SHIT appetizer no idea what's as mumbled whispered but really SHIT lemon shrimp roll Adding lemon sushi brilliant! refreshing actually felt aperitif could stuff ourselves more sushi lobster baked roll some seriously oooey gooey delicious stuff  Fried rolls fried need say more?  But seriously Shit good! <EOR> Neko Korean restaurant Korean sushi place truly good!

All eat worth it! servers little slower lot new trainees seemed but main thing fish prepared tasted fresh definitely some menu choices bit more unique other sushi joints! Coming back sure  4 stars due slow servicing  Hopefully change rating next time again  <EOR> Our party 20 came throw down whole section under tree sectioned off us   Knowing sister restaurant Sakana expectations weren't high  decided someone party  atmosphere pretty cool all but overall experience kinda sketchy   seems they've fooled ALOT people sushi rice ratio but seriously need more rice when comes nigiri otherwise JUST SERVE SASHIMI!!! Another fail saucing anything everything here   very common Korean run AYCE sushi joints least experiences  Nigiri terrible mess already having enough rice top awkwardly long slices fish   not fan style all  Some side dishes pretty good though   Cheat sheets given TABLE NUMBERS ordering easier well waitstaff but did help? NOPE   Plates being delivered wrong tables and would constantly hear Oh didn't order throughout evening  Take advantage 2 1 alcohol offer you're gonna need if end having similar experience did   ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter \uuu \uuu \uu  2 5 <EOR> ALL HAIL FISH RICE RATIO!!!   So wanting try place because everyone told small ratio rice fish ratio  actually don't crave AYCE sushi much before because just filling!   So place replaced old shuseki  definitely upgraded though because some cool decorations artwork?! ambiance? restaurant very nice    The service excellent attentive or because seated right kitchen but overall checked bussers kept refilling hot tea water total plus Do favor order oysters white tuna fresh water eel seared paprika salmon nigiri  <EOR> It irritates much 180 Sushi Neko second visit    My first visit acceptable experience food unique enough set itself apart saturation AYCE sushi places Las Vegas plus no wait time  array hot items menu variety satisfy parents any means hardcore sushi connoisseurs  Almost all nigiri some type sauce dressing did most other dishes preferred choice but acceptable  service really lacking servers bit quiet but efficient enough    This second visit holey moley am even same restaurant? Sushi Neko hit 3 strikes really quick made point may food poisoning  Fish delicate requires more sharp knife handle all know also know fish isn't supposed chewy  uncertain origins super white tuna whether its authentic even just escolar its scary take bite fish chewy  scares same consistency squid octopus  Consistently having scales multiple different fishes orders drenched sauce both rice fish fall apart  Second lot things ordered did show confused ie seaweed salad seafood salad  If don't something let customer know rather them just sit wait it  Third service pretty bad its hard satisfy tell you're bringing refill water  restaurant wasn't pack serving any big parties can't imagine its hard 2 servers 1 busser let know you're serving me   I know Sushi Neko part same group owns Sakana 99% same menu apple fall tree far? would embarrassed if any friends came through recommendation experienced did foreseeable year stay away  <EOR> Just literally other night   Lemme start telling place prettty awesome rolls  apps  Because weird guy loves sushi place's apps  Rolls well made look pretty appealing   Its new expect? Hopefully better over time next time might better experience  want enjoy lots different things Neko Sushi but amount attention received didn't allow partake nearly many things wanted to  <EOR> About month ago came dinner costumer table across b day server bring mini cake candle table sing happy b day song  moment really experience restaurant b day costumer head thinking come back dinner celebrate b day  Today came back girl b day almost end servers come ask desert pick mini cake b day only give b day person only!!

 On food nigiri overall very good   Salmon belly unagi favorites absolutely did disappoint   fish rice ratio amazing which thing sushi restaurant break experience   Unfortunately yellowtail little icy frozen fish perhaps    fan would again reason   appetizers average miso soup salad calamri   miso little salty side   Salad nothing special but refreshing   calamari served generic sweet chili sauce which mediocre   Unfortunately most disappointing actual rolls   drenched sauces mayonnaise excessive ruined experience eating fish   If come back I'd stick just nigiri pick rolls didn't come some sort sauce   A big perk handful desserts choose end your meal   mango mochi tempura ice cream which both very delicious!  An AYCE meal costs $21 lunch $26 dinner which pretty typical any AYCE sushi place   sure if Vegas better AYCE sushi places but place pretty good I'd definitely come back ton nigiri  <EOR> Very fresh good quality sushi  love sushi believe truly best sushi place Las Vegas  Highly recommend salmon yellowtail spider roll  sushi nigri give big cut fish very little rice  AYCE eat rice along fish but rice portions small    Green tea ice cream mocha ice cream tasty!

Its first All Eat throughly fully enjoy  Compare All Eat japanese restaurants ate NYC still better huge range!   The price lunch $20 95 think dinner $25 95? price compare NYC price same  only tried lunch didn't try dinner yet due other plans but next time definitely dinner  dinner menu lunch menu only few selections more but those few more worth because includes no rice rolls too!   The quality nigiri world amazing! Rice fish ratio perfect! rice very small fish literally wrap around it  sister ordered udon she can't enough she ordered 3 bowls! also tried few appetizer only wasn't crazy cucumber crab salad  boring but flavor wise fine  didn't really order much rolls since love nigiri but still pretty good  eel cucumber roll gave eel sauce dip ourselves instead pouring onto roll which new  plum ice cream nothing special didn't really taste plum but still good different  Service also amazing  Very attentive almost only lunch which shocking me  place amazing! decor also very cute  name neko means cat everything everywhere cats!

Trust nothing tomatoes!  Any rice less rolls change day day depending fish availability chef stuffed tomato?   Popcorn lobster meh much yum yum sauce same problem coconut shrimp roll  could taste anything but yum yum whatever sauce was  both drowned it   Lobster special same sauce pang except seafood which awesome  Don't recommend coco shrimp hardly any coconut drowning yum yum sauce   Things note you're browsing Yelp no longer Kalbi  don't afraid pull Yelp ask! <EOR> taste nice price fair  nigiri very generous  customer service awesome don't wait drink refill  overall very great experience can't find any dissatisfaction  <EOR> This great place bang your buck because rice fish ratio  probably should sharing because don't want popular but selfish  fish excellent fresh but don't limits salmon belly kind odd because every likes it  lot baked dishes small order large variety them  If really into raw fish then might some better places  very satisfied meal didn't leave full many other places would have  finished ice cream coffee dessert pleasantly surprised coffee strong enough leave good taste expecting disappointment instead pleasantly surprised around every corner  <EOR> Love place! sure dinner AYCE order salmon belly amazing melt your mouth buttery goodness  last visit added few dinner specials also order part AYCE which included salmon canapés ordered waitress apologized having cream cheese said replacing guacamole instead   um no apologies needed substitution!

Big cuts fish basically 12 grains rice seriously  Hubs awe  Your excitement might actually deflect reality  mean easily excited myself until started eating nigiris  Chewy cuts greatest quality fish  mean AYCES   one shouldn't expect top grade fish but all saying is   please don't feed chewy ones  Just dang luck tell you   Service suppppper slow however friendly  did usual order salmon skin spicy tuna because basic helps gauge place   and disgusting  Salmon skin tasted cooked day before  Matter fact seemed barely any salmon skin  rice rolls wet  Eek  lousy experience same two selections another sushi spot reignited old feelings  spicy tuna right spicy but just lacked flavor  ordered few other things non sushi related just meh    Also failed bring 1 husband's order forgot name   but quite all right because then   the husband spit few nigiris yet full other orders anyway    Honestly best thing experiences edamame mochi ice cream   nothing sushi nigiri wanting return 3rd time  If friends wanted come eat course I'd come   not much party pooper wasn't thaaaat disgusted  Just know there's other solid sushi spots to    Decor layout certainly cute! favorite thing place  wanted love considering rice fish ratio  disappointment us  husband sucker sashimi nigiris pretty easy please   was disappointed himself  if garbage disposal spits food back out   just saying   The ayce actually pretty good price  probably where see why people rave it  But wonder many times need come back warrant same 4 5 stars?

WORST PART first time boyfriend's brother gotten sick eating here  TIME boyfriend sick  put pieces together now very much believe food poisoning place  He hasn't worked almost week because he hasn't feeling well eating Sushi Neko  read other reviews claiming they've gotten food poisoning surprised  Customer service trash place food overall disgusting  eat sushi all time various places but most traumatizing experience  waste your time money risk your health eating here  I'd recommend Island Sushi Oyshi  <EOR> Even though Sapporo Sushi now freshest town still wanted try location because radar long time everyone talks portions fish    Yes portions great! variety good too  Lots rolls nigiri extras    However freshness hit miss still level non AYCE places which shouldn't surprising but still hope  Most disappointing uni sea urchin   When fresh soft unique creamy sweet taste  When fresh basically seafood diarrhea  sorry say visit latter  inedible could eat it    On flip side ama ebi best ever here  yellow tail also good  tuna just okay    Towards end getting really busy little more disorganized slower service but bus boys always top water plates    I would return AYCE try variety but Sapporo continue favorite more freshness  <EOR> Terrible customer service  only reason giving star because decent rolls   I hoping would great tried stay positive during entire experience but cousin found long a** hair roll!   We nice didn't care  A server kept bringing orders weren't ours   They would deny ordered certain rolls continually bringing same roll didn't order   The lady serving rolls didn't even know name them would just drop off plates without saying anything  Even if would tell them roll!   I am sushi lover many sushi restaurants most unwelcoming worst customer service All Eat Restaurant    The part rude would just continually drop off random plates didn't order  Expecting eat it! want ordered some random stuff charge later    They only asked once if doing okay ask water refilled    You know restaurant bad service when can't even keep your water filled    If want good sushi good experience down road Umiya Sushi  service sushi worth it  <EOR> When first came Neko almost year ago actually thought very bad service subpar sushi   never thought I'd come eat again   Now happy say love place!
