Refrain eating service horrible  just walked told close 2 30pm yet Yelp says 5 30pm  informed careless cashier website said 5 30pm she replied oh  old website well then update it! <EOR> Definitely caught eye when read SUSHI ASIAN FUSION check out    I LOVE sushi always hoping place near court house  walkable distance   could easily ordered regular sushi roll would satisfied sushi craving but wasn't paying attention menu only thing could ask popular   things server listed Mexipanese Carne Asada Tuna it   think mix?  Very diverse combination   She recommended bowl style along too     The mixture very different but all ingredients rice black beans asada tuna slaw nori terichipotle sauce very good   bowl felt wasn't enough rice   felt bowl overwhelmed black beans but all other ingredients perfectly proportionate entire bowl   Don't wrong beans tasteful very good but think just much liking   could probably without beans   bean rice portion much enough   terichipotle sauce slight kick it   think if mix Mexican Japanese together try overwhelm mix much other ingredients   Keep simple      Overall would give place another shot  <EOR> Okay super nervous try place because Mexican Japanese just sound odd  duo but food amazing! service great top that  Try won't regret it  <EOR> I wandered found spot just opened today  owned operated Sin City Sandwiches which next door  signature Mexipanese salad mix carne asada tuna poke next door your choice salad burrito tacos bowl  salad mix romaine spinach kale super fresh! See photo    Service spot food tasty  The dragon fire sauce spicy but easily fixed siracha definitely return try other options    I lucky since missed 12 pm lunch rush order pretty fast  missed added guacamole but fixed immediately  Owner onsite open suggestions  Thumbs up! <EOR> With name restaurant its very obvious expect  however unfortunately tad disappointing  poke tuna salad ordered didn't really seem blend two cultures food together well  just came off very bland any flavors present overpowered kale   I taste Triple Pacific Burrito much better although think Sushirrito fusion down better   Nice service but probably wouldn't stop again  <EOR> I keep going back taking co workers friends converted  Really hope place keeps doing doing  <EOR> This place amazing! must if area heck even if area!! menu very creative  staff very friendly  tried carne asada chicken burritos delicious  sauces awesome  Great portion sizes decent prices  cant lose!
