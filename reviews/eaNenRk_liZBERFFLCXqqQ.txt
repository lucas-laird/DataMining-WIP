Its very nice place  decor nice dig re purposed warehouse look  bathrooms equipped disposable toothbrushes tooth paste mouth wash if feel need  Plenty walking room some places try pack many tables its hassle around them   All all great place  We'll probably back mother's birthday next month since she wants come back already haha  5 5 stars! <EOR> Great restaurant! sever Exo best  Definitely best restaurants Vegas! <EOR> Food good BUT place absolute WORST SERVICE seen any restaurant any kind anywhere  All guests all around saying generally same thing pretty good food remarkably BAD service seemingly intentionally bad Korean hipster wannabes   never again highly recommend avoiding place unless being treated shit bunch loser 20 somethings   <EOR> Absolutely phenomenal  Where else basically buffet food cheese fondue grade meats dessert  Definitely coming back again!!! Bravo Hobak <EOR> Awesome authentic Korean BBQ    must say Managers staff top notch    Get early you'll waiting heat   though provide FREE lemon cherry slushies 0 Even though customers clamoring never felt pressured hurried   shows care customers experience over making few extra dollars   The only negatives would need banchan game egg dish slightly overdone  As meats    extremely fresh marinated really well    we both marinated not  We liked variety family set    1 large 1 medium accommodate 6 adults 1 child   beef pork combos    Rice complimentary but request it   If new Korean BBQ waiters cook your meats default unless choose yourself    Come casual don't wear your best because you'll come smelling smoky  <EOR> Best Korean restaurant town  5 star rating well deserved  good  definitely come back  <EOR> This second time coming establishment  first experience great but wait way long  time busy did enough staff  large beef combo $90  wasn't even enough feed two let alone 3 4 advertised  Overall value price paid worth all  Also service terrible many times ask items waiters  worth hype? Probably not  <EOR> The servers cook your food always hovering around depending your dining style could negative positive  really appreciated server attempted small talk shows he 's putting effort customer service    This good place group friends someone celebrating birthday  birthday celebrant play music overhead servers sing happy birthday bring ice cream sandwiches sparklers    My husband beef pork combo two felt just enough satiate bellies  seasoning meat flavorful    Lastly details such toothbrush station bathroom ice cream sandwiches remind exerting effort stand place personal stamp your dining experience    Overall felt even though little more expensive other restaurants customer service flavoring atmosphere made worth it  awhile restaurant enough quirkiness smile    Pros customer service atmosphere taste ice cream sandwiches!  Cons price <EOR> I guess white people version Korean BBQ  food tasted okay  would say probably better Korean BBQ places Vegas but  saying you're valedictorian summer school special ed because most Korean BBQ places suck  price little high  said white people version its good them  someone came Korea  <EOR> We tried large combo family 4  lot food but probably meant 3 4 adults  Everything good kids really liked ice cream sandwiches included  just took long time servers come back ice cream order bring check  ask assistance since call button didn't work  Other servers really attentive  almost felt server break something didn't see again    <EOR> Excellent quality meat service town visiting family happy stumble upon place! friend ordered small combo beef pork  Also loved ice cream dessert end! <EOR> Great meal great service!

It's hard describe good place but back 3 times 5 star meal every time  <EOR> This review based entirely lack service poor procedures  waiting approximately 40 minutes buzzer off  handed hostess told would seated next    During next 20 minutes 4 additional parties seated  When asked why told next yet other parties being seated ahead told because party five needed wait round table    However two round tables only two people seated them  fact party seated just prior buzzer going off party two seated round table  addition she asked party 2 party 4 if would willing sit together large table during 20 minute window   The manager came told just needed wait round tables large enough 5   asked why parties two being seated larger tables he said seat parties 2 large tables despite fact two separate examples right there!   When asked much longer would round table told perhaps another 20 minutes  left without trying food    I'm sure food excellent worthy some higher star ratings however management needs know seat smaller parties smaller tables seat larger parties larger tables rather larger parties wait twice long   In addition hostess followed car ask buzzer which turned over 20 minutes earlier  believe she already handed again another party  <EOR> Great meats great value!  only reason why didnt give 5 stars cause thought side dishes only okay   beef chicken pork all awesome! <EOR> Hobak delicious  service good too  love Korean bbq place top 2! <EOR> Hobak offers great selection Korean BBQ side dishes  gf tried combination but found beef peculiar aftertaste    The amount food lower end spectrum much pay  Usually isn't issue where quality offsets quantity but aftertaste just ruined us    I particularly enjoyed bento    If aftertaste wasn't would easily given place 5 stars  <EOR> Great YELP find late night! remote plaza little further Spring Mountain little gem doesn't offer AYCE only la cart items combo sets  But no fear good food fill up!
