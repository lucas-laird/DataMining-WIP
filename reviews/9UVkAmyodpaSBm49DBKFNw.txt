I decided regular bowl white rice  regular huge portion but large well if super hungry  great offer brown white rice  all you! Select your protein  ordered raw salmon ahi tuna spicy tuna  Next choose sauce sauces many like  chipotle mayo wanted house sweet poke sauce they out ended yum yum sauce instead  Then toppings! ton! loved give avocado free your bowl  cucumber mango pieces red onion  Now charge extra mango salsa improvised   Sweet Poke great raw fish  amount fish rice could slightly better but overall very satisfying  sauces ended excellent but chipotle mayo needs little kick   If neck woods again I'd definitely give them try again  <EOR> Came friend pit stop Costco glad did   love poke place!  First off feel price very reasonable here   2 scoops protein less 10 dollars!  Also love give more options other places base   options include white brown rice salad spring mix romaine spinach kale tofu combination above   picked spinach salad tofu   also offer variety sauces popular chipotle mayo eel sauce   nice balance spicy sweet   Their salmon tuna very fresh   didn't any chewy pieces fishy tasting pieces bowl   top your two scoops also offer complimentary scoop spicy regular crab meat spicy tuna   spicy tuna delicious well   also love avocado comes free!  Usually charge extra that   topped bowl tons veggies including seaweed salad corn peppers radish edamame etc   Everything delicious definitely come again   recommend creating your own bowl rather picking bowl off menu because tailor just it  <EOR> I am bound determined sushi burrito! tried another place little adventurous hated it! friend told place try it!

Lots choices very decently priced  always own but order preset bowl burrito when always check sure want each item just case  feel prices VERY competitive never left feeling anyone skimping any proteins  spicy tuna considered topping two scoops fish + spicy tuna still regular bowl  If line moves very fast   Entering exiting parking lot little crowded busy testy but always parking fairly close large parking lot  <EOR> Awesome service thumbs Shirlene!  great food!
