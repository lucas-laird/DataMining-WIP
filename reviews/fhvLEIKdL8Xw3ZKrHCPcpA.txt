Cheesecake good but fight amongst ourselves it  wish would say won't ever again but try again later down road   Last but least overpriced because name  pastrami sandwich rye wo fries cost 19 99  Bagel cafe Weiss Delis better service best cost significantly better food now   If keeps Canters no chance <EOR> My wife great experience  Food good service good no complaints  noticed lot inaccurate yelp commentaries price  Anyone complains price does very often  Its still less expensive Carnegie deli nyc 30 years ago  3 x avg $30 per visit  <EOR> Took son birthday lunch dined Canters restaurant before looking forward great lunch  waiter Wade he did great job seems lunch items start 11 1045 but he made happen   pickled tomatoes cucumbers wonderful tasted great even some coleslaw which awesome  Ruben son sandwich Ruben but coleslaw vice sauerkraut  food arrived together hot tasty   going back again try breakfast open early  Highly recommend it <EOR> So glad close home  Love Canter's Deli  Pastrami world staff fantastic  <EOR> Canter's pretty famous deli hailing Los Angeles  offer huge variety breakfast foods served nice restaurant Tivoli village    The Jewish deli served tasty food attractively served  Service amazing t speedy efficient    I also some really decent coffee  brought almond milk coffees another brought milk cream  also tried chocolate coffee cake very satisfied!  There free parking Tivoli village usually easy park around here    Canter's provides generous portions decently priced  probably come back again if am west side area  <EOR> Disappointing  The service good maybe little overbearing but between busy times think servers being trained  The pickles bland ripe enough  green tomatoes yummy  The pastrami Reuben just ok  Nothing special though rye bread pretty good   Onion rings fine little over cooked   Definitely worth $50 repeat  <EOR> Great spot! Chilly night matzoh ball soup  place  waiter Eric spot recommendations too  Great atmosphere  Super clean  Check out  <EOR> So disappointing  First time here  try matzo ball soup New York cheesecake  matzo ball soup very salty no chicken noodles hard matzo ball  cheesecake pretty good but very very small  return here  When told waitress soup tasted terrible couldn't eat response am sorry next time come don't order soup  kind response that??

Anyway really different good  cole slaw great too  We'll definitely back  <EOR> I normally try let service significantly affect reviews but entire ordering process customer service wrong order really affected it  If see reviews hard good review me    The deli staff did know menu when ordered appetizer pastrami sandwich  consult someone back  When woman rang order she left off sandwich ring second time  checked yelp supposed black whites  She yelled back bring black whites  order took 15 mins handed two bags go  When home black whites bag  would say nature verbal exchanges any staff members never hospitable friendly just monotone unexcitable conversation    For almost $30 appetizer sandwich soda hoping experience would better  Good thing pastrami bomb because I'd tempted give two stars  <EOR> After all months waiting Canter's disappointment   Don't if you're expecting menu similar Fairfax Canter's know love   Bakery case unappealing sparse   matzah ball soup Canter's favorite Fairfax soup   No adding rice kreplach no getting just broth no chicken pieces which something made Canter's stand other delis   Kitchen backed server busy take order runner attempted take order but didn't know answer any menu questions had   The only plus clean   Hopefully appropriate changes before official grand opening   Otherwise won't returning  <EOR> We extremely disappointed food  all delays waiting excited give them try  wanted order Reuben but told corned beef  Canter's corned beef?
