Food wise wings good  Very spicy but that   some burger bites pretty decent too   However suffer scourge all tiny burgers easily cooked well done    Overall decent spot bite   If you're hurry might want pass though food took some time come out  <EOR> Stopped airport breakfast sporting migraine headache  Disappointing all counts  6 choices breakfast  breakfast burrito omelette variations 1 classic breakfast  Coffee $3 39 cup served coffee grounds those flimsy plastic stir sticks  ask spoon never appears  restaurant  did someone steal spoons?? Ordered veggie frittata sans cheese  TexMex but doesn't mean spice food much your mouth still burning 10 minutes later  Service marginal  stopping again  <EOR> It's Chili's     airport     obviously wasn't expecting much but give 4 stars because am good mood pleasantly surprised breakfast burrito  some tasty breakfast potatoes which clearly steak fries seasoned cut into bite size pieces   but hey good! guacamole tasty included price extra looking Chipotle   feel great solid breakfast before heading onto 3 hour flight  <EOR> Not great first impression   Of course stopped hoping grab quick breakfast before flight   place busy looking sit bar   no open stools hostess sat right near bar told server would right me   I sat close 15 minutes never approached even acknowledged   ended walking still hungry waiting gate until flight boarded   That unacceptable! place seemed fully staffed yet just let people walk out   other options airport avoid place next time fly out  <EOR> Bartender Fred barely slinging drinks more paying attention hockey game 4 beers 3rd beer guy gives glass lipstick other smudges grime it To admission didn't notice until 4 5 sips try discreet clown giving beer dirty glass    Fred we're asking sling quality signature mixed drinks   Obviously beers clean glass tall task old fella     ***Steer clear*** <EOR> Only eat if 3 hours  took 20 minutes see server ordered immediately  45 minutes into wait burger asked them box order could board flight  Most order wrong all cold no apologized  airport location would expect service under hour  case here  <EOR> This place pathetic   if server annoyed all   never seen take long first beer   Hello?!  Hint people eat drink tend higher tabs higher tips!  Food mediocre quite same regular Chilis   Menu abridged well   thought eating tier above sketchy fast food places terminal but apparently place no better    just alcohol server tip  <EOR> Expect mediocore airport quality service food choices  long time since Chili's sure if would normally expect Chili's nowadays but remember experience being quite different past  Service moderately slow so don't come if hurry your flight   Menu much more limited stated Yelp  Food expensive chincy  all 4 pieces sliced shouldn't shredded? chicken breast nachos small dollop guacamole each $2 extra piece  Music irritating loud  haven't received bill yet nachos margarita but thinking $30 35 including tip  BUT airport considering alternatives    this isn't bad  If look other Yelp reviews McCarran you'll notice similar low ratings most restaurants   bright side full bar 4 TVs let stay long time your table without hurrying service attentive but neglectful I nice bowl salsa when asked it seasoning freshly fried tortilla chips TDF is acceptable understandable abbreviation?   Margarita so so which really sums experience here     <EOR> This second experience Chili's  wasn't very hungry decided try small loaded potato soup  amazing fresh tasty  service very quick too  host door welcoming everybody 5 star restaurant  Excellent experience! <EOR> Terrible service  Ok food  kept pressing call button check 15 minutes server busy chatting another customer  asked another waiter please bring check he did help us  server bald sure name  He needs learn take care tables if he can't handle just two unacceptable  <EOR>
