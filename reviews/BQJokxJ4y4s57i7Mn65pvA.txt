Right off bat knew might completely happy  wife asked if shredded beef barbacoa waiter Hispanic didn't act he knew barbacoa was  Then when asked pina coloda told didn't those  wife instead ordered beerita waiter looked she crazy realizing called that  called name   When she glass small she couldnt flip beer into still straw she drank beer maragarita seperatley  looking good far!  We chips salsa green sauce pretty good red sauce tasted odd  bad just odd  also table side guacamole 90% reason giving many stars did  awsome!   My wife ordered short rib tacos steak fajitas  flour tortillas mine came corn tortillas  Both tortillas tasted bad killed taste meats  fajitas bit bland but wife said short rib tacos pretty good she ditched tortillas  Beans rice average best    To sum if your looking place beers some pretty awsome dipping guacamole dont mind ear numbing loud music then place pretty good  If want full dinner dinner environment expect good mexican elsewhere  pretty convinced someone could killing vegas authentic mexican resteraunt  <EOR> We took group while conference MGM great  much better expected   Terrific friendly service   Tableside guac!!!!  Try spicy version     Pitchers margaritas fun loved fajitas   Great groups  <EOR> The most expensive unimpressive bland chicken tacos ever had  Staff nice but food price <EOR> Always amazing experience tastebuds! yet bad meal service  Food service definitely top notch  Pricey course but isn't everything Vegas? Definitely worth it! Tamales mojitos amazing! don't forget fresh made guacamole! <EOR> I recently found gluten intolerance worried finding legit gluten free food Vegas since always risky eating out  scared being hungry whole trip because restaurants only having options chips salsa salad  found restaurant during gluten free search decided check out  menu very clearly labeled GF options lots them! Both appetizers entrees  enchiladas beans rice nachos delicious! portion size good well  ate both days stayed Vegas because most options GF menu conveniently labeled  Staff very friendly well  definitely recommend restaurant anyone but specially those trying eat gluten free! <EOR> I didn't actually eat here  can't comment food  finally left waiting 45 minutes seat  plenty tables open needed cleaned off  Monique hostess kept telling getting set up  45 minutes 4 conversations later finally left  3 girls hostess stand just standing around  Terrible customer service! <EOR> Best Mexican food ever enchiladas world!!! food fast fresh guacamole salsa chip dishes excellent well  bartender great courteous very helpful knowledge local locations! ambiance restaurant awesome definitely back!!! <EOR> Excellent spot Mexican food  Though inside MGM actual sit down spot extensive menu extremely well priced  taco salad chicken which cannot recommend enough! Delicious cocktails well! <EOR> Food mediocre  Prices attached photo  bad restaurant hotel  table side guacamole best thing had  Although fair warning only avocado  fine 2 but you'd need order more larger party  fish tacos I'd rate them 4 5  husband steak burrito which actually made chicken accident  He said bland  food could definitely use more salt overall  service Sunday night service great  actually comped burrito told them made incorrectly only sure charged lesser priced burrito kudos them  Also chips salsa $6 95  would definitely upgrade guacamole because free salsa salsa isn't great  chips amazing though! give 4 5 prices comparable other causal dining hotel restaurants 5 5 service 3 5 food  <EOR> Good getting fed gone  Average food good drinks    Made 6 30 only find didn't Happy Hour deals week ever?   Ordered fish tacos bonus carnitas taco  Nothing spectacular but carnitas second best week didn't appear reheated fifth time Yard House tops believe Cabo Wabo worst   Kitchen lightening fast cool busy week when huge trade show town      My advice? Grab drink small app before hit road    then hit road  <EOR> Coming Texas skeptical but disappointed  table side guacamole excellent Herradura margarita sublime  love being able take because casino floor just can't compete real margarita    My husband split steak shrimp fajitas  all flavorful between fajita guac full  fajitas only came 3 shrimp but survived  course bit overpriced because inside Vegas casino but happy overall  <EOR> The shredded beef nachos incredible  ordered fish tacos way salty  told waiter respectful way wouldn't recommend dish  He saw didn't eat them came back tacos off bill no questions asked  Great service would come back again  <EOR> Amazing tostada salad! ordered chicken much food  could done without meat  ordered sangria which good but didn't come any fruit  husband enchiladas white sauce amazing  Great food but service amazing!!!!! would definitely return  <EOR> Service horrible very slow wasn't even busy when came  Food mediocre best over priced  <EOR> Pretty good margs chips but nothing write home about  <EOR> I am very partial Mexican food excited try Hecho en Vegas  huge restaurant all Vegas but seated corner table which made little more intimate  celebrating friend's birthday server made sure acknowledge birthday flan end meal nice touch  start guacamole prepared table side just your liking it delicious! all bunch tacos shared them all good but especially partial chicken al pastor  margaritas good but sweet side  mine little more sour side but each own  stellar super creative food but ingredients fresh service good whole experience refreshingly unpretentious  <EOR> Wandered into Hecho Saturday night slammed  Unbeknownst time night Madonna concert  Somehow able seat bar  ordered beer took look over menu  menu lot great looking choices wanted try them all but stomach only big  salsas came nachos good munching them ordered fish tacos  really good! came refried beans which barely touched only because wanted sure room tacos  say prices little high but vacation really didn't bother much  Nick bartender great! Very friendly attentive accurate! <EOR> A OK food 3 stars but service horrendous beyond belief 1 star    Our waiter epitome douche  Throughout entire meal he rushing didn't bother listen say  example asked which seasoning sauce he recommended three choices enchiladas he basically just mocked asking didn't answer question  WTF? He lucky automatic gratuity which probably why he thought he could act way since party 6  Otherwise would've left $0 99 tip   Anyway free chips salsa two kinds red green which yummy  Then ordered two orders guacamole mild medium which front you! think only $10 which steal compared DC prices when guacamole front you  medium basically mild    No hint spiciness all   Me friend split ceviche  included both types ceviche  hated them ahi something  wasabi but long days nights drinking tasted Jose Cuervo me  Blech  liked other kind though! traditional Limey shrimp cukes etc   Everyone group seemed enjoy meal steak fajitas chicken fajitas ahi ceviche taco salad   I beef enchiladas  just okay  rice highlight dish which reality isn't even good  just hungry <EOR> Honestly best experiences food life  table ordered nachos chips salsa fajitas tamale platter several other items all amazing  sangria just ok though  <EOR> Get table side guacamole! incredibly good   they fresh right front you  best guacamole ever had! ordered grilled chicken fajitas incredible  chicken tasted freshly cooked backyard grill  portions very reasonable did leave feeling stuffed uncomfortable  pricey but worth Vegas fresh food!
