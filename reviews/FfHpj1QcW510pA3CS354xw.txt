Wir waren hier während unseres Aufenthaltes zum Frühstück und vietnamesischen Abendessen  Wir haben immer sofort einen Platz bekommen die Bedienung war immer freundlich verstand auch einen Spaß dass Essen kam zügig  Alles schmeckte gut und wer günstigere Preise direkt einem Hotel am Strip erwartet kann ja mal die Umgebung abklappern ob er fündig wird  Von uns gibt es 4 Sterne  <EOR> I love vermicelli but much going menu  some spring rolls peanut sauce really watered down fried spring rolls vermicelli tasted bad  wife turkey sandwich put no mayo cheese flavor matter  should probably cut down menu focus making couple things really good instead making allot things  really shitty  <EOR> I've eaten breakfast twice while staying TI haven't disappointed  full if add some salt pepper your entree pretty tasty   Service good food came quick   Typical breakfast 2 including juice coffee ran $55 tip which pretty steep   kicking myself company paid it! <EOR> Ate breakfast Friday morning   service TERRIBLE   only waited few minutes seated but getting someone come take order took almost twenty minutes   Water refills took forever well   When restaurant full empty tables shouldn't happen!  The food standard breakfast fare quality decent   However two entrees coffees tab over $50   expected much Vegas but if paying much food could anywhere would nice if service top notch  <EOR> Do waste your money  Terrible service  3 orders toast gave them plate  Waitress rude did provide any service ever  <EOR> they horrible service! took really long food    came eat because only thing open hotel 4am lol  but anywhoo wasnt alot people    how long does really take grilled cheese sandwich?? top off food wasnt great!  <EOR> Located Treasure Island opened 24 hours day American Diner Theme Eatery place  convenient diner food which all remarkable facility    The service could better slow during visit  dining hall dead 0630 Tuesday morning took least 15 minutes place mats additional flatware water? then another 15 minutes meals? Some think staff needs caffeine injections    Food ok swimming heavy use butter everything  diner place all don't expect anything healthy here  Just fill then rush tradeshow  <EOR> To say food bland complete understatement Seriously cheeseburger absolutely no flavor?  last night before seeing show  daughter myself ordered cheeseburgers wife pho    A cheeseburger works lettuce tomatoes pickles onions should some kind taste but nothing! took bite couldn't taste anything all  daughter said same thing too   My wife said pho okay but she loves watery crap no matter tastes  didn't seem very busy but service really slow  Also charged additional $1 50 little side order ranch dressing fries    seems slightly outrageous couple ounces salad dressing   Needless say going back  <EOR> I vaguely remember trying find place drunken frenzy wee hours morning ridiculous night drinking  Sadly alcohol best failed find it  HOWEVER still craving next day sobriety side found it! eggs benedict but instead your ol' run mill benedict w canadian bacon   it filet mignon! OMG  Heaven mouth  Really  Enough said  <EOR> The hostess Katheryn total fucken rude bitch! She bad attitude problem eyes since she kept rolling them  food good but bad vibes hostess made bad experience  Hopefully next time she'll better attitude more pleasurable dining experience  <EOR> 12 15pm Visited Coffee Shop based Treasure Island light lunch   Service    Server very friendly however seeing almost full plate left over food she did question why ask if wanted something else  My thoughts perhaps  she used people leaving full plates food which very worrying disgraceful coffee place restaurant hotel   Food  Ordered Qusedillas which came Pico De Gio Sour Cream   I asked no sour cream  When arrived poorly plated soggy tasteless  all crispy fresh tasting  The chicken hard find stringy lots onions thought might stringy green pepper stuck cheese  Quite frankly worse ever tasted anywhere considering starving tells lot  <EOR> Mushroom omelette crispy hashbrowns  service prompt delightful   especially attentive Keno girl  Gotta love winning money over eggs toast  If stay treasure island want quick breakfast without leaving casino recommend coffee shop  <EOR> Standard diner easy access  Good size portions but little overpriced  Omelettes all priced over $18  <EOR> Si mangia discretamente l'hamburger è buono ma non è sicuramente il migliore che io abbia mangiato negli Stati Uniti    You eat burger fairly good but definitely best eaten United States <EOR> The food pretty good but service god awful  stayed Treasure Island bachelorette party every staff member hotel phenomenal but ate twice coffee shop due its convenience waitresses horrendous  Nohemi beyond rude us  She took over 15 minutes even greet beverages  snotty when asked ketchup pepper  took forever checks never brought boxes when asked  When she brought checks back she given someone else's card friends missing!!

Yeah   I didn't   I chose pancakes w bananas caramelized almonds   bad   Factor lame Denny's atmosphere should really avoid being drunk desperate enough eat here   Note offshoot neighbor specializes Pho   Weird   But would try hearbeat before going back here    open 3 AM Friday Saturday midnight Sunday Thursday  <EOR> Ouch overpriced food! But hey Vegas guess!

Staff isn't very attentive either    <EOR> I wouldn't come optionally but if 2 morning rest your group incapacitated walk anywhere but your own hotel TI then spot   My friend craving steak eggs which came toast hashbrowns   $20+  steak itself cooked medium rare requested but severely bland privy adding salt steak cooked   What made trip quite unpleasant long wait  4 5 people table fell asleep I survived!   thought things could moved along but sure if being tired made more impatient  Nevertheless would avoid unless don't any other choice! <EOR> Here's thing always known Coffee Shop serve Pho! super convenient night Strip order hot bowl Pho also convenient morning after! HOWEVER serve Pho until 11am!! learned hard way excited bowl Pho first thing morning help cure headache however informed Pho wasn't served until 11am  disappointed but lazy anywhere else ended getting omelette  Obvi everything super overpriced it Strip duh! but service great food came hot fast!   Another plus food ordered if you're staying TI room service    <EOR> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  WORST place ever Vegas right when walked VERY rudely greeted lady right away told because group large if don't split we'd charge 18% tip which appreciate telling but caught off guard said excuse could repeat that? she rolled eyes repeated herself   okay whatever hoe let go   We sat fairly quickly group table 4 booth outer side decently tall guy 6 feet when sit booth size meant midgets legs stick bit edge server came kicked foot   HEY MOVE YOUR FOOT INSIDE obeyed orders bit shocked but whatever YOLO HO did  she walked away discussed friends agreed maybe English wasn't first language just let go    but course leg slipped bit again she walked table kicked foot again REALLY? AGAIN? REALLY PUT YOUR FOOT AGAIN? replied bigger guy can't keep leg inside completely under table mind wasn't STICKING nobody going trip over food then she starts lash can't keep foot inside finally fed said REALLY GOING KICK YELL ME?!!? she said KICKED JUST KICKED wtf r u serious?!?!?!?! wasn't even moving foot whole time talking she accused kicking when foot wasn't even moving?! lick nut lady you're effin crazy!!!   I made point wasn't going take yelling she replied OHH JUST TEASING YOUUUU then walked away yea no lady shit ain't going fly house  usually VERY courteous servers know tough job but when you're going YELL ME?! accuse doing something didn't suck it    got rest tables we 3 tables total stood left we're BEGGING eat take your peasant food elsewhere  <EOR> Most expensive Chicken Strips ever! $16 only came four strips   $4 strip! mean hella good but definitely worth price! also Cheeseburger $14  fries point meat burger cooked just way it!! Everything delicious     BUT then again drunk  doesn't taste good when you're drunk starving?! food definitely WAY overpriced which why took star away  Another star taken away slow bad service  <EOR> I glanced through other reviews agree overpriced but exception buffet possibly think everything Treasure Island overpriced  few things irritated me  am needs given free things though love free!   However server forgot put orders only 6 us then other friend's food cold she asked heated  server left something forgot her  next time she saw server remembered took reheated finally   place dead time way  both those incidents fault server would nice offered discount free dessert something but none that  Overall think all fairly satisfied food though mine little oily   friend breakfast sandwich Denny's night before she thought DISGUSTING Coffee Shop made it  server while slow very nice  selection good seated right away thank goodness because took forever decide where eat   would eat again pinch but isn't first choice  <EOR> After night Vegas last thing want travel far find breakfast your way downstairs voila! Coffee Shop greets near base T I  elevators  never expect great things casino's cafe but usually does enough hit spot  Coffee Shop lived expectation neither impressed nor irritated me    I ended deciding sandwich sounded more appealing breakfast since noon time stumbled downstairs  chose French dip side fries  sandwich good but best ever had  asked side ranch wonderful waiter whose name meant remember but now forgotten brought huge bowl ranch  He knows way ranch loving heart!   My friends ordered assortment breakfast lunch items  heard omelette wasn't great but oatmeal pretty good  waiter further impressed offering split bill five ways which made lives much easier    At $21 tax tip way more think sandwich worth but guess  price pay Vegas convenience  <EOR> Since didn't steak eggs dinner night before made point come down breakfast  Prices gone didn't realize till bill  $20 measley steak eggs plate  Nice buttery eggs crisp hashbrowns but steak sinewy rimmed gristle  <EOR> Didn't pleasure dining place because service horrendous ended leaving before even ordered  waitress came take order gave drinks quickly  She didn't explain she taking drink orders but waitress  When asked order she told she would send over waiter  totally fine that   waiter gentleman standing looking 5 minutes  saw waive woman off continue nothing she told request  complained host he completely unhelpful  He simply said server big table  He handled completely wrong passed buck manager  overall lack teamwork part terrible customer service  <EOR> When you've little much drink night before need come Coffee Shop bring back speed  Located Treasure Island TI hotel homey diner feel  restaurant open concept people TI lobby casino see see them pass by  waitresses second moms always checking making sure we're doing ok  love when restaurant doesn't rush leave allows take your time eating  Take all time want Hon  Did mention liked spot lot?

Seriously REALLY needed caffeine! But don't stop there  ordered Italian omelette served large portions side hash browns generously buttered toasted wheat bread  knew didn't eat anything else until dinner  food delicious too! mention Tapatio sauce! friend introduced recently hooked  similar Frank's red hot sauce except spicier  doused entire omelette hash browns Tapatio sauce! Heaven! Surprisingly diner also served Pho other Vietnamese dishes  if you'd rather eat morning much drinking then all means! Next time we'll definitely give part menu go     Overall really liked restaurant  relatively affordable it's still Vegas serves good brunch food comfortable atmosphere practically gives several coffee refills allows sit long periods time while people watching  back! <EOR> We great experience here  food pricier side but keep mind you're strip  restaurant clean they're fast The entire staff friendly very accommodating  favorite waiter Arron always asked sit section   Arron highly exceptional customer service skills friendly positive personality main reason why kept going breakfast  Arron made feel home wonderful host waiter  returning  <EOR> Since place hotel came lot pho  nights missed window order pho because part seperate menu  literally just served last bowl  heartbroken  don't remember time stopped serving pho but if wanted some next morning available 11 am    The bowl pho itself very generous bowl coming Texas says alot  also lunch special offered pho appetizer but waitress said bowl alot smaller just ordering itself  Anyways night where did order pho ordered french toast hated it  egg taste way strong  Hence why only ordered pho  <EOR> My wife did stay Treasure Island breakfast coffee shop shared Swiss mushroom omelet coffee food hot good  hash Brown's crispy everything great  good friendly service  <EOR> Pho soup flavorful needs improvement  California roll rice hard refrigerated  Service good  Clean environment  Food good value many other Cafe eat at  Ate breakfast here  Sandwich pastry average  <EOR> over priced sure  Checked T I came bfast before road blah dad raving waited but just eh      i ordered Fresh Market Skillet eh came soggy hash browns eggs could totally tell where powdered kinda disappointing wasnt salted   mean blah <EOR> i think ordered salmon platter  forgot called  but everything presented beautifully platter  came cream cheese chives a bagel cut half TONS salmon capers red onions and tomatoes  whew! all hard work just lox sandwich! really good! but $13?! dont think its worth price     oh dont forget play KENO!! = <EOR> On pricey side your standard cafe    We ordered coffee which came huge pot left table refill own  Columbian blend watery light side  practically drinking hot brown water cream    The mushroom omelette good  comes hash browns toast  hash browns dry side which good thing because its less greasy  short stack pancakes tasted battery returned them    Service okay overall I'd say good place eat least once if you're staying TI  Otherwise don't bother  <EOR> The best thing place? If you're hungry middle night and you're staying TI probably most convenient place satisfy your hunger  Unfortunately  just only good thing place    In middle night limited menu few breakfast selections well few appetizers burgers sandwiches choices  most if all previous reviews stated all overpriced  But hey Vegas    when you're hungry you're hungry right?  My friends ordered wings Clubhouse sandwich  wings larger side however sauce tasted little odd  definitely wasn't just buffalo sauce     all say that  Clubhouse sandwich good    great sharing! comes small order fries lots ketchup  Great munching  Oh    service? Eh    Five minutes sat down woman came take drink orders  She then let know she wasn't going server he'd around shortly  Ten fifteen minutes later server arrived  Normally don't problem if server takes while us    but when he did he wasn't very happy it  He short looked he couldn't gotten away table fast enough  He might having bad day night but really     good attitude especially when you're service industry  2 stars Hm    sure if back  Maybe order room service next time here  <EOR> Service slow nonexistent left 15 minutes server still hadn't stopped even though weren't busy  would rate night staff negative stars  <EOR> Rujee rude she ripped food hand because wasn't cooked right couldn't even finish fries because she took off bill ? won't eat place again <EOR> Spacious indoor dining tables outside pool  didn't serve pho till noon n early ended ordering ham n cheese omelette though wasn't preferred   Service friendly but food took forever year half  waiter felt bad comped drip coffee  Okay place grab bite but pricey fabulous eat  <EOR> I stayed TI past 4th July weekend happy first visit but thrilled second time  First off room description says average cost per person $12    um maybe 10yrs ago cause both times bill over $20 just myself  Which opinion WAY expensive breakfast  asked cheddar cheese eggs came back square piece melted American which disappointed with  asked bacon well done came well done  send back coffee because watery  btw   second day if experience first day would gone back  first day sitting next table 8 people seated then forgot about  entire table ended leaving upset   that should sign!! bad every restaurant damn expensive TI     disappointing  <EOR> This your average breakfast place but far more expensive  all American breakfast which included two eggs toast hash browns $17 95  added bacon $2  food standard  no real reason paying price  once didn't care back  Three fine food but don't come save your money  <EOR> My family breakfast pho lunch   really service food  Love American breakfast Vietnamese pho place  both very tasty very original  sure again  <EOR> The service always sucks  think old ladies rejected casino waitresses die   Most food mediocre meant eaten when wasted   being said stuffed baked potatoes awesome   always cook hashbrowns perfectly  <EOR> I usually don't write bad reviews but very disappointed food service here! husband came last night Monday around 8 00 before going see Mystere   ordered classic hamburger cheese for $16 $5 special margarita  burger VERY bland! under seasoned overcooked  margarita ok  worth $5  husband said Philly cheese steak sandwich good but he ordered coke which he never received until he food because waitress forgot  food waitress never came back table husband needed refill coke  both finished food before she came back table husband ask refill check  She never apologized refilling coke sooner just acted flustered when husband asked it  Btw busy Monday night  When she came back she refilled coke put check table  coke flat  literally tasted watered down syrup  thought sure she would taken coke off bill but she didn't  coke $3 75!!! feel would better food service cheaper price Denny's! guess should said something but hate complaining when just want enjoyable time  understand ate cheaper places Treasure Island but $16 burger felt should tasted better would hospital cafeteria  coke cost $3 75 should refilled when still food flat! $45 overall bill waitress should least friendly  didn't tip ALWAYS tip even if experience isn't great long servers nice food ok  would tipped if coke taken off bill  Also walking away table saw bus boy counting money left right table front all other guests! taking counting table! Seriously? expected restaurant Treasure Island  need step up! <EOR> I LOVE COFFEE SHOP! late night!  This might best establishment food Vegas plenty better options   However when hungover its 5 am just want some hearty hangover food spot when you're staying Treasure Island!  I love french onion soup here! remedy  <EOR> I liked food but wallet did not   In Vegas getting over some mild food poisoning different restaurant bf cold bodies couldn't really handle going anywhere fancy even hotel   definitely did want buffet food already tried pho hotel decided give coffee shop Treasure Island try some simple food     My appetite coming back decided fried chicken dinner   came choice soup salad opted French onion soup which $1 50 extra    bf ordered spaghetti meatballs chicken noodle soup   The spaghetti edible nothing terrible but nothing spectacular but never find spaghetti spectacular anyway   meatballs very large plenty food eat   chicken noodle soup good though very cold salty   fried chicken dinner yummy!  came four pieces chicken fried sort southern style   also mashed potatoes veggies   potatoes yummy  veggies ok   chicken really flavorful juicy though   saw lot other tables also order everyone seemed happy   could only eat half plate maybe $18 price tag almost acceptable   French onion soup also ordered delicious!  little salty but I'd rather soup more salty sweet   really savory finished bowl clean!  Food decent but sometimes you'll wait long time   Plus prices expensive food you're getting but guess since open 24 hours better nothing   I'd eat again if didn't want leave hotel  <EOR> It's really coffee shop despite its name  more Denny's because serve variety American food they're open 24 hours    The food itself wasn't very good  3 friends shared chicken pot pie which more thick chicken noodle soup bread bowl cobb salad chicken caesar salad quesadilla  salads okay quesadilla very average  Nothing really memorable  But pretty dang overpriced  guess  expected restaurant inside Vegas hotel    Service super sweet though!
