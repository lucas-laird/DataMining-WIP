Looovvvveeee yum yum sauce!! rad also long wait comparable prices!!!! <EOR> It very rare give place 1 star review but given circumstances must done  why    1  walked asking table 6 server immediately asked your first time here? replied Yes  know thinking she going Oh welcome!! We're happy tonight! Instead she responded Oh next time just sure call let know big group coming in? see we're quite small just better both if called in    Did just tell first time? supposed know small restaurant? thought any typical restaurant walk party 6 accommodate even if meant wait little? o_O?   2  checked Yelp received free sake what's some sake without some Asahi amirite? order bottle Asahi  Almost regrettable because completely confused crap server asking coworker if allowed multiple times  Back forth she asking questions thinking looking free bottle Asahi sake when repeatedly told just wanted order beer sake  ! Just take money already give bottle Asahi!   3  server continued remind she new  first time pass understandable but mistake mistake mistake excuse being new does fly me  give benefit doubt you're smart cookie don't keep telling you're new  understood first time  Just better  better don't mean spilling water phones   which exactly she did ___ ohh laawwd    4  upside downside if wanted any roll wrapped cucumber but only roll when you're doing AYCE option  Bummer because those only type rolls fancy    5  Obviously server wasn't favorable but just general feel place rather small where all servers taking care all tables  personally attentive server when dine because then run into multiple servers asking if you're doing okay 5 minute rotations  But wasn't problem just seemed no being attentive  If possible just dine sushi bar your orders right away deal mess   6  Lastly reason why EEK! Methinks not! Sasa because don't live area don't see myself driving 20 minutes visit again  food OK but service really left bad taste mouth  <EOR> I called prior leaving home asked time close  female said last call 10 15 but if before then you'll fine   family arrived 10 pm sharp wouldn't let said closed WHEN ONLY 10Pm  just lost business forever   2 20 17 10pm <EOR> Great food atmosphere service close home!  glad found place   We AYCE uni amaebi salmon belly besides others impressed freshness small size rice   Some places nigiri much rice fill but just right   even fried amaebi head without asking   very pleasant dining experience would highly recommend place  <EOR> Nothing special  better AYCE elsewhere but decent  fish rather bland only thing boyfriend really enjoyed poke  delicious  Otherwise pretty lackluster  <EOR> This review regarding Yelp Order Online option Sasa Sushi  ordered food 1 5 hours before restaurant closed paid via credit card received email confirmation pick within 10 30 minutes   Showed restaurant 20 minutes placing order restaurant wasn't open likely closed some time since no staff closing restaurant everyone left already   I only assume closed early cuz dead but now paid food late night stuck trying figure still open dinner going money back    I called restaurant refund they've redirected Yelp guess Eat24 run online orders  we'll see goes   So would recommend using online ordering service if even couple hours before restaurant closes because may open when try pick your food   Edit eat24 responded promptly refund  <EOR> I used come all time great! last couple times gone place filthy cockroach wall    Menus never wiped down sticky sauce all over them service gone way downhill  might changed management something?

Thanks guy working sushi bar great! <EOR> I really enjoyed food here! fresh well prepared nice aesthetic  only reason why giving 4 stars believe very small restaurants shouldn't taking reservations small parties    Not only weren't even sure which seats bar area actually reserved not  waiting 35 mins first available two once sat down halfway through meal hostess looked 4 bar seats next that available since before ask chef if even really reserved not  extremely irritating hear weren't even actually reserved anyone! waited 35 mins seated nothing    All aside food great am definitely willing come back try again  Hopefully service more capable next time around! <EOR> Pros waitress nice extremely polite accommodating    The sushi rolls did come quickly but only customers Saturday around 1 pm    The price reasonable $25 all eat The mochi ice cream cheap decent   Cons They need fix booths  booth sat hole   The rolls weren't very impressive  rice dry sticky    When asked spicy mayo one myself another boyfriend mind small containers cook based off pictures he wasn't usual cook told waitress only bottle  Rude much! shouldn't addressing waitress customer that  Plus pretty sure if sushi restaurant should more spicy mayo back  I also disliked menu  When order all eat don't give sheet like most sushi spots do easier order    I'm sure why place 4 stars  <EOR> Best Sushi crew come across Las Vegas    all choices great more accommodating  feel family Laci such great hostess     everyone needs try them amazing! <EOR> My place AYCE sushi  eaten lot AYCE places day says lot   Pros 1  first most important thing quality fish  exception where bad batch mackeral which chefs now running joke now never once disappointed fish served  Always fresh always generously portioned never over temperature dry  Fish rice ratio also always right point    2  staff great especially chefs  If sit bar they're always point getting taken care really fun bunch conversations while eat  Manny rock star  Seen owner handful times she's very nice   3  AYCE pricing fairly standard but real deal comes AYCD bonus only $5 extra  Even without house sake super cheap $1 50 small $3 00 large  Most place charge double triple that  also nice fairly priced selection cold bottled sakes well   4  place clean doesn't smell funky  There's lot sushi places where walk smelling abandoned fish factory but here  Never dirty table  Bathrooms well maintained  most importantly knowledge never once health department grade lower A   huge deal town   5  shiso  isn't something you'll commonly see reviews most people don't even know but  big deal me  Also known perilla its plant leaf really enhances flavors certain nigiri items especially squid yellowtail  even really rocking appetizer called Japanese Nachos deep fried shiso lovely fish mix top it  favorite things there    More often if ask other places don't charge extra don't even know blasphemy!    Cons 1  Generally appetizers aren't bad but aren't great either  Some things calamari popcorn scallops overcooked small rubbery  job done but could improved  Selection them also bit limited  minor complaint though primarily sushi Japanese Nachos stated above more happy enough really care appetizer wise   2  Sometimes lot reservations seating limited  Kind bummer when you're walking Friday Saturday night there's really long wait  Can't really knock them though more just FYI call ahead those nights sure there's seating available   3  Minor quibble but there's no menu options riceless rolls i e  ones use cucumber instead rice    In summary happy frequent customer continue long they're around  <EOR> My friends long day wanted Japanese food   Someone looked Yelp places eat found Sasa place hadn't to   Saw sign front Free bottle Sake if check Yelp   did   Food so   Shrimp Tempura sent back luke warm   don't know where shrimp comes but its small tasteless  Chicken Katsu much breading little dry chicken pieces cut big     Only server evening he moved pretty quick orders cleaning tables   I still haven't found good Japanese restaurant  <EOR> This where all friends sushi!

Shrimp Tempura big but Tempura Sauce die for! probably best Tempura sauce ever tasted  Definitely recommend Tempura selection if sauce alone    Now rolls  two specialty rolls regular roll  First Spider Roll  never seen presented this  wrapped yellow soy paper as per chef sweeter most Spider Rolls had  soft shell crab didn't taste natural I guess before  say wasn't fresh tasty just didn't soft shell crab taste familiar with    Then Volcano Roll  which baked scallops sauce top  Another must try! baked selection kind distinct aftertaste comes off burnt foil guess but only noticed scarfed down because just good    At point getting filled last order classic  Rainbow Roll  much bigger expected tasted awesome thought would  gotta say raw fish selection nice fresh  dessert Red Bean Ice Cream only because starting tired Green Tea everywhere there's green tea flavored something but digress  also Mango Mochi which aside being firmly frozen amazing  recommend it!  That's it  Parking available right front TV bar  bathrooms nice clean chefs awesome attentive  place definitely worth try  Overall give them 4 5 star rating  <EOR> Been before ownership name changed wasn't really fan  Now back again seeing pretty decent reviews but still wasn't 100% expectations     Service PHENOMENAL  I'd probably back JUST service    Food sushi really bland  Didnt enough flavor rolls rolled tight fell apart  pork belly appetizer delicious but comes many pieces sure over order because does heavy your stomach  **They also offer order sashimi when AYCE but unfortunately did know until full eat any more   That's really all say place  <EOR> I honestly haven't sushi spot impressive long time!
