Does open until 7am??? serve breakfast coffee busiest intersections Vegas don't open until 7am?  Rediculous! <EOR> I half caff 12 ounce latte  very nice rosetta tasted milky latte exceptional also bad  love red ceramic cups use   feel place reminds Starbucks terms layout fact baristas wearing headsets    just totally changes vibe place feels more plastic less genuine  very business efficient transaction  If looking indie coffee shop soul isn't your place  <EOR> Favorite coffee spot  Wish more locations drive thru's  Best coffee Starbucks look chump  <EOR> Love Nutella cappuccino fact location drive thru which fairly quick however requested breakfast sandwich without meat which stated could change price  $8 sandwich  Never again  <EOR> Although location doesn't carry same charm Boca Park find more welcoming comfortable convenient   It's located Jones just off 215 next Tropical Smoothie near Sierra Gold Kyara  Small inside but ample outdoor seating shade  Working drive through those go    Baristas awesome very consistent  drinks taste very milky other location but drinks perfect balance between coffee milk  always opt nutella latte nutella cappucino chocolate cappucino almond milk  Heads shots espresso large enough count two according baristas  No tall grande ventis size availabilities 12 oz hot drinks 12 oz 16 oz iced lattes    If cards 15 drinks your next free  only complaint your tab rack here  drinks pastries pretty pricey  <EOR> Very disappointed two visits location   Premium prices almost 5 bucks 12 oz  coffee demand excellent service premium experience   sadly case here   staff did want specialty coffees because would take longer just pouring cup big urn house coffee   Also did through effort select full size piece biscotti   3 4 size fragment full price   order took more 20 minutes complete   Another note cups use impart unpleasant taste odor coffee   Philosophically buy new trend complicated ways premium coffee   am also weary lazy staff untruthful long urn coffee sitting there   simple pour over premium beans fully roasted clean water proper temperature all required     said better experiences Summerlin location despite old school biases  <EOR> I coming Sambalatte 3 years now  morning baristas very knowledgeable really know craft! highly recommend place if want awesome latte! Definitely try Nutella latte Red Rock latte  <EOR> The specialty coffees good but overpriced  Lackluster pastries blaring soundtrack just average cafe  <EOR> I love cappuccinos those definitely deserve 5 stars    But am REALLY bummed close 7pm  isn't Summerlin where everything closes down early  same complex two 24hr businesses restaurant closes 2 3am  10 people just leave more coming because said close 7  don't stay open until 2am though I'd love it but least until 9 10pm most other things area  Even Starbucks stays open late block away    I've waiting months location open great just hope change mind hours! <EOR> Great spot  Great coffee  only thing could Sambalatte better if Henderson location  d <EOR> The coffee everything good  don't very large breakfast lunch selection Starbucks beats when comes that     <EOR> I just love coffe spot  Best cappuccino coffe art  tell all friends all agree other places Sambalatte  yes free coffe 10 times  <EOR> Sambalatte blows starbucks water! Amazing flavorful QUALITY drinks food  Jones location once twice day  bit more expensive other places but worth extra $2 $4  <EOR> i ordered nutella latte  good priced  $6+ 12oz!!! totally worth it! based taste i'd pay $2 it! disappointment! but fair ordered soy   and add disappointment drive thru wait longer normal  <EOR> The coffee great!!! Beats other chain stores!! few unique drinks highly recommend  <EOR> Wish everything menu  quick breakfast 8 50am ordered oatmeal told they're also ordered peppermint tea also told they're out  <EOR> Compared Summerlin location one's meh  look place very nice especially love wood counter facing view strip  customer service seems hit miss here  morning ladies looked less happy foam latte bit off weak few bubbles   thrilled thought replica Summerlin location coming South end Vegas but unfortunately when places expand often lose sight originality all important facets entailed awesome café  happened here  But late! Bottom line locale hire better help technical friendly passionate baristas Summerlin given isn't ritzy neighborhood Summerlin should adjust prices accordingly especially competition area Coffee houses  <EOR> I love Latte here  strong thick  Little bit expensive but better starbucks  Hopefully some extra large size  <EOR> This best place study  shop big open  don't going small place full people talking  Weekend normal packed but usually come weekdays before school  outside tables sit chat your big group friends enjoy summer heat  Oh well know fall coming enjoy best weather Vegas time year!  I love Nutella Iced Nutella latte favorite summer coffee  used order Nutella cappuccino when weather colder  Oh don't forget try matcha if milk greentea  also smoothies fav Acai smoothie which Brazilian berry    Desserts good but little pricy  If sweet chocolate crunch awesome    The staffs awesome friendly  When busy might little slow  But give them times  don't come good coffee shop rush somewhere  Come hang out  good coffee great conversation friends  put your headset study    Too bad close 8pm kinda early Vegas  night owl would love stay till midnight later  <EOR> I gave Summerlin location 5 Stars  Jones location just opened going give few chances since love coffee  All foods drinks great  give those 5 Stars  3 Stars because service price  don't mind $5 price coffee but $8 ham cheese croissant! Really?! service VERY slow moment  understandable IF busy if they're under staffed but there's 5 people behind counter 3 people coffee section 2 cashiers  found myself waiting acknowledged finally someone took order coffee took forever made  because baristas just socializing talking plans night! Really?! Come on! hear see you're doing doing! Then ask cashier much some pastries respond don't know  least employees know prices small amount pastries top head! going give them chance though because coffee! really hope themselves together! really want them succeed close later time! Closing 7pm ridiculous when there's Serenade close closes 3am  <EOR> This far BEST coffee shop ever to  used going Starbucks every day having just mediocre lattes but coffee shop opened near house drive thru thought i'd try it  am hooked  come three times week  iced nutella latte best coffee drink ive ever had  Also muffins size boulders and quite dense one   chocolate muffin blueberry muffin  delicious  also tried almond croissant  Incredible  dont post yelp alot but felt being delicious place is  never Starbucks anymore  really no comparison  Seriously  Oh staff super nice also  gets 5 stars easily  Try it  wont disappointed  <EOR> The coffee great but prices overly expensive even clientele cater to your moneys worth  only offer 16 oz  drinks some drinks only 12 oz  When asked 16 oz  drink sales person said give but only add more milk additional coffee  am sure best customer friendly approach    I think stick Coffee Bean Tea Leaf  Coffee quality same but reasonable prices  <EOR> I always enjoyed Sambalatte Boca Park am elated opened new location off Jones 215S   decor unique great customer service outdoor seating inviting  cafe lattes served real cup favorite   Expensive? don't think prices comparable mega chain coffee stores  big difference  local cafe local owners some big chain where all profits Seattle! <EOR> Not extravagant boca park but location drive threw!!! Nevertheless location still relaxing samba vibe when walk inside    For first timers nothing Starbucks coffee bean use too   coffee tea more authentic more exotic flavors Nutella latte       If chai fan chai latte best ever had   more spice taste layers unlike other places where consistent flavor <EOR> I recommend Chai Latte! them add almond milk tasted amazing! latte calming perfect!  Definitely back again try other drinks menu love drive thru well  Very nice inside too! <EOR> Yes there's no doubt coffee good but pretentiousness place overall never want set foot again  cheesy music covers play uniforms baristas wear constantly changing wifi password overall bad service  not mention overpriced is  just scene  veggie quiche $8 but tiny served plastic silver wear  open mind leave generally annoyed  Sunrise Coffee House legit local vibe fair prices great service  <EOR> This place offers good coffee lattes yummy but price pretty steep vibe really stiff   almost dont enjoy your latte should because stiff vibe   interior decorated nice plenty seating   would 5 star if pricing better and or drinks provided cheerful smile  coffee shop without comfort? <EOR> Was hoping location rampart  But very disappointed location  food pastry choices horrible  walked all butter croissants muffins doughnuts cut half  could wal mart  walked able anything unfortunately since nothing choose from  Rosalie cafe better location  location needs step up  slacking  Sad believe  <EOR> I coffee shop mainly flat white   convenient location friendly staff qualify product   wish quicker making orders clearing tables  <EOR> Great diner style breakfast place  Clean  Well cooked eggs  Fluffy pancakes  Service attentive super friendly  go to spot when Vegas  <EOR> Stay away!!!! place sick spoiled milk latte!!!

Nice snacks too  <EOR> I Sambalatte just rainbow latte but return fun latte flavors rose petal pistachio  inside seating isn't quiet plentiful cozy other coffee shops but coffee itself very good lattes extremely smooth point flavoring isn't needed missed  several baked goods muffins turnovers croissants fresh eats sandwiches quiche   Though Rampart location closer easily preferred large patio drive thru option friendly counter service  <EOR> The Nutella latte AMAZING Teddy fantastic! Not sweet am glad am no longer stuck Starbucks  place real deal  <EOR> Second Sambalatte location same mall Kyara   Since moved San Francisco hard time looking great coffee shops offer consistent high quality espresso drinks  Sambalatte Summerlin great but crowded loud   This location much quieter neighborhood which big plus   Prices high end but quality well worth buck   I'll come back often  <EOR> prices what's expected trendy spot but baked goods tasty coffee definitely worth it  Nutella latte point  ask ice bomb too  Starbucks ? <EOR> My favorite local coffee shop  Great customer service fast personable  Latte cold brew cortado bae <EOR> I start saying love coffee tried many places other then normal Starbucks  drove past place other day decided give try  First off noticed pricing completely ridiculous    5 50 16oz??

Nicely laid laid back  No hectic vibe but still very quick  Everyone seems green store 2 small mistakes nothing big but super attentive apologetic it  Seems once staff gets into groove top notch spot top notch coffee  So kind cut them some slack first few weeks  sure am! <EOR> Had quiche Lorraine pumpkin spice latte  quiche delicious think egg white quiche but 100% sure because good  crust flaky pastry crust often used croissants very delicious  pumpkin spice latte didn't taste overly pumpkin like but savor taste pumpkin purée  perfectly sweetened didn't need any additional sweeteners first sip little bitter black coffee but that  Best cup coffee ever had    Great atmosphere meeting friends work  There's music playing background loudly mean hear but doesn't distract you  probably grab another before leave cafe  <EOR> Such horrible service such nice establishment    Stood line least 8 10 minutes acknowledged all  even hello right you   Especially being service industry really expected more place this   Extremely disappointed service did come back again  can't even give star because even acknowledged    Well leave star post comment but if say would one  <EOR> Spacious clean large window walls shaded patio seating it's tunnel catch breeze good quality food yet try hot beverages tropical iced tea isn't great multiple plugs available but few minutes 7 45pm closed already  I definitely consider returning study time frames during day  <EOR> I thought Starbucks bad  Sambalatte worse  Stopped large hot vanilla latte  cup best 16oz $5 50  don't mind paying good coffee but barely warm very bitter  Want better local coffee shop sunrise tipsy's much better coffee  <EOR> Hmm group friends came interest getting some coffee snacks play board games  quickly found would ideal place because really much room since tables tiny  fact if two people pastry dish enough space put both pastry holders same table  short space but think could couple bigger tables help issue   Alright now onto food drinks  Mmmm all food sitting behind bar looked tasty but didn't know much most was  already spent 5 bucks smallish coffee could only imagine prices food  did opportunity sample friends nutella bomb devoured 30 seconds eating it  know tasty   Anyways white chocolate mocha coffee great  perfect drink sip read book  But due spacing issue found myself quickly chugging could relocate another place find space board games  <EOR> Lavender latte incredible  Great taste super fragrant lavender undertones  macarons probably best Vegas  would strongly recommend check place if you're coffee connoisseur me <EOR> Imagine coffee  shop where walk door hear angels singing all glory smell aroma coffee fanatics think heaven earth    Smooth coffee brewing sugary pastries filling air!
