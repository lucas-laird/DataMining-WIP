Good food great service   what more need!?  Ok   the atmosphere cool too  Certainly hidden gem worth checking out  <EOR> Stopped quick lunch   Far exceeded expectations   portions huge seasonings distinct flavorful everything fresh!

Which probably fresh UNpasteurized which unfortunately cannot right now  back inside was sitting outside patio asked employees  said should but seemed question themselves  sat back outside employees came back said safe side probably shouldn't eat happy bring back brand new without feta  awesome careful sweet were  Can't wait come back eat feta cheese next time when finally can!  Note Salad yummy but traditional greek flavor which more vinegary garlicky  Instead does more asian soy saucy flavor  Still really yummy but then again asian prob taste yummier then some people               Was craving Mediterranean decided give place try glad did! price pay portion itself unbelievable  Most other places pretty generic portions cost  plate $10 assumed most other places goodness plate enough feed 2 people! See pictures We ordered ground beef chicken skewer mix plate which comes side bowl salad  meat flavorful tender  dry all  salad also generous portion dressing delicious! Simple yet flavorful  rice say only thing could little better  wasn't flavored enough shall say enough butter lot places but exchange its much healthier way  don't mind  We also ordered chicken shawarma plate charred perfectly  own tahini sauce recipe atop shawarma plate  itself tasted bit plain bitter nutty twist but sauce chicken wonderfully! even asked extra sauce side   They also pizza and huge pizza oven well which ordinary but since didn't order any can't rate much that  Maybe next time   Service They great  think its family owned operation  does take little time prep your food but thats most Mediterranean style restaurants all working hard  did hope would warned big portions could've ordered differently    Ambiance A little small shop little outdoor patio seating area thats pretty nice  Parking plenty thats plaza  totally come back again!! <EOR> Great lunch spot! Service could friendlier! Lunch menu well priced portions large  expecting salads before lunch nice plus  few lunch today each ordered something different  All dishes great  Tasty food good quality big portions  <EOR> The food great best Persian food ever had  Nice environment food always fresh  Great prices friendly services  <EOR> Their service horrible  gave fliers people street come while couldn't handle even portion them  brought half order  checked 20 minutes realized forgotten rest order  even refuse apologize bringing your food hour!  These aside sticky tea mug check picture below average food quality   My suggestion don't think going place! <EOR> I twice both times food great  tried vegetarian meals cooked animal carcasses  Every time gone food flavorful decent prices! <EOR> First time ordering catered food let tell you  requested food delivered 5pm hotel suite surprise bday dinner family member received call 4 58pm saying he downstairs lobby ready all food ordered  Talk punctual! tandori beef chicken kabobs all tender tasty all dips flavorful! Definitely eating again thank your wonderful service on time delivery! <EOR> Have lunch love menu  Great taste!!

Wrong  You're much better off buying store bought hummus  <EOR> I ordered online order confirmed  paid full waited more 30 minutes message order canceled food  good guys  <EOR> Sadly most recent experience Chickpeas wasn't near enjoyable prior one  falafel ordered did taste fresh nor did texture fresh falafel  it tasted something came package opposed something made in house  Very disappointing  shawarma also tasty last time lamb bit odd taste chicken more palatable  But both also tasted salty once again using fresh ingredients  give them 3 average initial 5 star experience 1 star experience but probably look other restaurants particularly falafel  <EOR> Wow! All say!
