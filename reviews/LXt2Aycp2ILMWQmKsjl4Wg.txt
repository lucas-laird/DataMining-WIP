Then when told sandwiches supposed free agreement supervisors Amanda made husband due previous botched order she stared blankly mumbled coworkers situation   2 minutes where she just stood silent asked if discount going applied because fine paying sandwich if then would take Amanda when she came back work she rolled eyes just said Wait  Finally she said could swipe card which responded guess means yes?

I know if return location  love company frequent two other locations Las Vegas  all locations good company  location just added itself bad column  Today's business brought part town decided eat again  few times before never this   If high school kids you've hired mature enough run your business efficiently while away perhaps should left unattended  <EOR> Firehouse giving Jersey Mike's run its money top chain sandwich place town    The place very open no cramped feeling even if ton people there    I ordered NY Steamer sandwich very high quality sub  did sandwich Fully involved   brisket pastrami combo outstanding  cole slaw top icing cake! did foot long Large sub which $2 00 more  Well worth couple bucks    The famous soda machine over 120 soda styles  did peach cherry Mello Yello  Peach soda awesome!

Nice amount spice yummy melted cheese top   However location's claim fame speak reason why location specifically soda machine see pic    Very high tech but when actually used realized just bunch flavored syrups which appropriately inappropriately mix your favorite soft drink   Some combinations pretty gross opinion   wants vanilla flavored Sprite?  I appreciate non caffeinated no calorie sodas Sprite Zero Dasani Sensations   But keep mind if add flavored syrup diet drink anymore   Plus hard figure getting if drink nazi me   example Dasani Sensations Lemon no calorie version lemon syrup calories?  Finally people enamored damn machine stand front taking sips every possible combination   only machine gets super annoying   But enough drink machine   cashier food prep people friendly food good back  <EOR> I cornbeef sandwich  tastiest sandwiches while  Just right amount meat  don't much meat little  Everything tasted fresh good  good come back next day  time ordered sweet spicy meatball  reminds pizza but sandwich  Customer service excellent  greeted immediately smile  place looks clean too   I'll back again  <EOR> I think discovered new addiction  never tried Firehouse Subs prior opening location but boy am glad did! fan hot sandwiches perfect place me  first few visits ordered Turkey Bacon Ranch delicious  only wish bacon crispy says its description  another visit ordered same thing go  Same taste but little disappointed fact time home 10 minutes later much bread turned bit soggy due dressing put it  Maybe next time should ask dressing side    In attempt branch try another sub ordered New York Steamer Sub hehe   Again YUM O! meats subs definitely sparse pile meat lot more bigger sub sandwich chains town ubway Say ort of subs Pay D   Also meats very juicy!

The fast food set ordering belies time takes actually order   sure but takes along everyone else 10 minutes order combo #10 Smokehouse Beef Cheddar Brisket sub bag chips soda   Big plus million choice soda machine choose Grape Fanta time   Love machine   $9 combo which seems bit high but surely sub must fantastic   Anyway 10 minutes later sub first bite somewhat    underwhelming   Now thought bread really good great but really good   meat cheese inside also seemed fresh well made   But combination didn't quite work because taste bread basically overpowered stuff inside   having really good bread     size also underwhelming causing question whether should paid $9 this   biggest question all why did take 10 minutes prepare this??   Firehouse certainly huge step two aforementioned chains if hurry probably come back here    give 3 star rating but certainly room improvement   Maybe ordered next time should try something more ingredients them   But before think try Port Subs next which also across street  <EOR> I live work close location frequent quite often  know most people only inclined use Yelp when problem wanted take time write positive review because LOVE place  only food great but love people  mentioned work close  location lunch often possible which would MUCH MORE OFTEN IF DELIVERED all work wishing day! often stuck another sub place just because delivers but all yearn your sandwhiches staff friendly tell attract good clientle  few regulars always come which know name welcomed just whole place feel nice  manager woman whom cant remember name right now it  She nice welcoming always pleasant converse came business park promoted company coupons  SMART  We just such small office don't meet quota catering would!
