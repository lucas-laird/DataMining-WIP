Then why did hostess tell happy hour when she seated outside bar area? Why signs table awesome happy hour prices when table outside designated happy hour area? Anyway ray sunshine waitress told tables open over if want move which agreed do    After grabbing novels Friday's menus follow K*** over promised land where she proceeds wave hand open table walk off  5 minutes setting no service walked   suck Suncoast Friday's   you suck!
