Happy hour 7 days week 5 10 bar 30% off all   alcoholic beverages  <EOR> We first place earlier year when opened loved it  typically always steak salad but tried various other appetizers entrees desserts all tasty!  I absolutely LOVE decor restaurant well outdoor space    much when fiance stressed trying plan wedding decided restaurant host reception! worked Andy created wonderful menu experience wedding guests  He very patient understanding just wanted sure happy  day reception he majority time made sure everything smoothly  really could better experience Andy staff  Although nervous first since traditional wedding reception spot pleasantly surprised elated professionalism everyone involved  Since still relatively new I'd say 99% guests never most them raved good food hope return own continue keeping place business!  The cost reception VERY reasonable inflated wedding industry  If handle wedding reception would definitely recommend restaurant any private event  <EOR> Ok hardly anybody restaurant Saturday night first clue  made reservation based good reviews but clear didn't need since practically empty  say pretty nice decor nice atmosphere but then again food  just sub par  But New York pay bread came only enough butter slice bread really put over top no salt pepper table couldn't find waiter when needed extra Parmesan   husband we'll never return  I'd say skip it  Zest much better  just saying New Yorker  <EOR> Just ate based off other Yelp reviews   looking restaurant off strip close where parents live Mother's Day dinner   Wish experience other reviewers but some big red flags here   1  Sunday night restaurant wasn't even half full   suppose could argue Sunday but don't think 8 30 late especially weekend holiday   could also argue its new perhaps people don't know but manager said open seven months     2   Very strange decor dig high ceilings exposed rafters industrial looking fans   But then there's huge crystal chandelier middle space   There's other modern touches but then there's always some strange old fashioned thing mucking tacky gold frames more gold light fixtures multicolored pastel painted walls   someone wanted decorate restaurant inspired apartment Friends  Add bizarre layout  it's almost big room much privacy your table but then again when walk there's gigantic piece floor real estate could dance floor     3   Menu all over place   don't know why thought going Italian based off other reviews photo saw menu pasta section   But definitely Italian nor any specific cuisine   Italian menu along French American even Hawaiian said waiter   fact when questioned waiter told no real theme try give everyone bit everything   seems unfocused generic me     4   Biggest red flag while three still appetizers eating waiter brought three mains same time   waiter nice guy but could he such faux pas?  mean surely he would known he taken apps plates  that Hell hadn't even finished them yet    terrible sign restaurant because means timing wasn't right wonder much entrees pre cooked re heated them come fast?   sure blame lapse etiquette but way doesn't look good kitchen wait staff   Plus waiter didn't apologize even seem aware just can't that     As food itself pretty mediocre   Clam Spinach dip intensely rich could've used less cheese especially since half order came deep fried pita bread   Zuchinni sticks ok   French onion soup opposite dip  not rich enough   salmon entree while salmon cooked perfectly thought cream sauce served old fashioned cloying Mom linguine clams which pretty hard mess up Dad braised short ribs which served cold   suppose restaurant can't cook short ribs order obviously need re heat cooked earlier but you'd think could temp right especially since rushed entree mentioned above   I feel bad write negative review because really wanted local restaurant  great location people want avoid Strip   But certainly wouldn't back unless minimum menu revamped refocused  <EOR> I came long ago place lovely  service pretty great food  only sad part friend really bad stomach ache next day  <EOR> This place cool atmosphere but food lackluster  tries emulate trendy places LA but food definitely falls short   bad cause inside cool    should consider brunch menu Sunday  <EOR> Right around corner don't know why waited long try it! little gem kind hidden but new faves! Very cute inside food phenomenal! very late night concert sat main dining room all other patrons bar area  ordered Tomato Basil Soup Blackened Rainbow Trout  soup flavorful rich  Rainbow Trout tasted fresh bright portion size just right  server believe bar tender since late  He super friendly chatty made sure forget dining room  heard many great things place all definitely true  Highly recommend place! <EOR> Similar vibe menu selection Honey Salt which why chose it  waiter owner founder very kind friendly attentive conversation cherry top great meal  Great drink appetizer selection above all  Highly recommend pesto gnocchi  Calm open friendly ambiance  <EOR> I came lunch friend  decor really nice put service good  food just okay  didn't really find anything memorable  server said gnocchi best dish but friend found really bland  couple items including flat bread grapes tuna tartare  Everything just okay <EOR> Love atmosphere love food love staff! MUST portobello fries  delicious reasonable price especially appetizer  crispy gnocchi also point  turkey cranberry sandwich nice twist brie cheese all flavors marry beautifully together  spicy seafood pasta also delicious  far disappointed anything ordered off menu don't think be  <EOR> First off place such obscure location  But if gather energy over worth it  menu offers type items always looks new American restaurants  interior design place also super eclectic feels very homey    The bartender super friendly well waiter manager  drinks really good creative  loved combinations menu  wanted try every single appetizer but sadly isn't realistic  ones did try good  Some them weren't executed well hoped  But still wasn't extremely disappointed  pesto gnocchi far favorite thing ate  highly recommend well fried zucchini  Mmmmm good! <EOR> Love place!  Super cute gem tucked away spot would never guess   friend tell never would gone  Nice atmosphere some fun decor   lots different seating postures find like sofa lounge chairs regular dining table bar seating booth seating     The food good well  Didn't knock socks off but definitely worth trying    The only reason didn't give 5 stars bc service slow  sitting lounge area bar perhaps just need server cover area rather bar tender   I definitely back! <EOR> OMG!!!!!!

But when meal came thought perfectly fine without sauce   The salmon tasty moist  Serving size maybe around 3 1 2 oz nice presentation small bed rice  think slightly overpriced $20 though  big enough portion $20  didn't need capers opinion enough flavor    My friend satisfied app meal  only ordering water sun all day  Unfortunately friend ask water refill glass almost empty bartender didn't even fill glass when he refilled hers  Sort basic fill both them once isn't it? He didn't ton people wait but whatever reason getting check taking money took very long time  Sorry aren't drinking today   ?

Refills several times  we all water  Asked extra place settings where server returned just utensils  specific ask plates too? Server disappeared table upon taking orders   Sometimes people need more time decide want eat  especially big party  proper excusal such Would more time decide? would nice   timing food bummer   Once last person food everyone pretty much done  Upon paying check gave 1 pen share amongst all pay portion  hospitality industry you're suppose anticipate needs  biggest party restaurant why overlooked behooves me   Dude embarrassed recommended place because great reviews  Such bummer  <EOR> We little together when walk place decor pretty cool walked bar few drinks greeted smiles which always good ordered some appetizers entrees food overall good but thought scallop appetizers little small side but delicious only concerned place super dead ?? mean no there? think time only 3 more tables walked ?

Wonderful food drinks service!!   Thoroughly enjoyed experience received here! food amazing super fast service!! <EOR> Overall pretty decent   While pricing good portioning commensurate pricing   Overall pretty good but since portions little small side left wanting   ribeye looked same size would steak eggs file maybe 5 6 oz   bar looks worthwhile happy hour specials looked good value  <EOR> Came last night dinner bookmarking place awhile back  atmosphere place definitely seem more expensive actually is  big main room bar side room but room used sparingly gives really big open feel which pretty nice  server Jason he great he very interested little baby quick order refills making conversation  wanted try some different plates calamari scallops appetizers  calamari pretty basic but gf asked remoulade which thought better then marinara  scallops pretty good but don't feel enough since half pieces rice  actual menu chicken wings she Cajun chicken shrimp pasta  chicken wings alright but some people said think would better some crisp them  Pasta quote good but since fan spicy opted out  dessert course trio sampler creme brûlée delicious although flourless cake id really rename fudge all all come back eventually  Cheap food expensive feel great service  <EOR> Went Sparklings eat very nice decor clean good food very affordable  *salmon* which delicious  <EOR> This cutest restaurants gone while  interior well designed unique  spacious modern fancy  perfect date night just group friends  perfect spot birthday dinners too  Food comes well presented without being overpriced!  always love!

Beautiful establishment prices very reasonable  back!! <EOR> Great food great server  bacon wrapped dates gnocchi Caesar salad clam chowder chocolate cake  Caesar could used more dressing but otherwise everything delicious  flourless chocolate cake perfect ending   Our server great  Good sense humor  think short handed though few times waited server then he brought check before see dessert menu  He quickly apologized brought right over good thing he did  said chocolate good delicious  Looking forward having again  <EOR> I don't know maybe came off night   certainly willing give them another try but experienced visit    On first impression love décor feel restaurant  100% right  However something missing couldn't put finger on   that night Wednesday wasn't very busy no hustle bustle give place warm vibe maybe sound system music didn't really fill room   sure but felt last table restaurant close night  Just little quite   I'd actually give food 3 4 stars  decent  think favorite crispy gnocchi would love see meal   it darn good    Where night wrong partly due staff   wasn't friendly just inexperienced professionalism seemed forced which if new serving tables understand takes time your mo jo going  appetizers came time when asked person delivered them not server type bread came spinach crab dip two different types served answer don't know  ask chef if want    feel if work restaurant people brings food table should well aware menu it  Maybe first night job   who knows  least he offered ask chef guess    After appetizers soup came then shortly he said entrees would shortly   then delivered entrée followed 10 minute wait   there four party waiting 3 more entrees   then delivered more entrée still nothing other two just apologies wait   even asked waiter hold entrees which he answered sure let ask them    Hummm   we've waiting now 15 minutes + just entrees served apologizing but don't know why apologizing  When entrees finally did come manager I assume finally gave reason   our steaks over cooked redo them   Which if would told right then would understanding wait   Also while waiting during all manager brought free appetizer spinach crab dip which already had   nice gesture but also shows no communication between server manager   Why bring table something they've already tried? Why ask would prefer considering ones inconvenienced    I hope does improve back another time over weekend perhaps see if better experience  <EOR> Party 30 please! Came Friday night friend's birthday dinner  only restaurant twice  first time okay  think second time better    So came around 8  lot im sure confusing group people serve lol  But didn't start taking orders until 9  practically sat hour waiting    sure if cos waiting every single person party come what  least wasn't alone waiting hour  Anyways friend ordered appetizer forgive idk called but picture posted  flavor amazing! wouldn't wanted order just looking description lol but glad she did  ordered spaghetti bacon mushroom cream sauce shared that  Hugeeee portion pretty heavy meal but definitely must try  other friend ordered crispy gnocchi since saw favorite Yelp  didn't really care much it  guess high expectations but weren't met  dessert tempura ice cream coffee   very well fried  much tempura overpowering ice cream crispy floury    Overall good experience! Didn't think would come back first time but changed mind  <EOR> Everything delicious here!! drinks appetizers entrées!! Staff super friendly management really cares service being provided <EOR> This place horrendous service  First all no idea server since each time someone came table someone different  larger party reservation  think common servers just automatically give everyone water then asks separate drink orders  only gave few people waters asked refills some people did drinks ordered  cocktails very diluted multiple drink orders remade  servers all seemed very rushed did provide welcoming environment  person party ordered steak wasn't cooked right sent back  entrees did come same time guest did entree until 10 minutes everyone else food  also brought cake birthday  No informed party cake cutting fee charged one  only staff lost box cake carried home without box  recommend place nice dinner  <EOR> Such lovely Secret!!!  food amazing !!!

Husband obviously liked he saw when ordered mom  following week he order go! Service staff attentive perhaps even attentive   appreciate more less can't complain much   restaurant wasn't busy coming around lot ask things if wanted order more   owner one partners came around see doing too  appreciate when owners take active part new business ventures because show genuine interest clientele especially if become regulars   He mentioned family friendly restaurant which appreciate and noticed kids' menu available    Overall Sparklings but bit confused   very upscale appearance but mix casual menu   think actually expand menu bit more perhaps time   But time being just couldn't find anything entrees interested us  Items ranged sandwiches Philly Cheese Steak $8 50 Shrimp Po Boy $8 50 pastas salmon meats ie  Rib Eye Steak $25 Filet Mignon $25    They offer happy hour lounge bar area 5 pm 10 pm daily which means discounted drinks   Only those over 21 years age allowed into restaurant 11 pm  <EOR> we Saturday night late night dinner because daughter off work late birthday  server Tim he very nice helpful  nice amount people nothing took long either  food good drinks my daughter turned 21 good too  daughter isn't drinker she didn't know order Tim spot patient whole thing  think great!! Only disappointment when asked other locations owner told only side town northwest side where live  but maybe hopefully open centennial hills  <EOR> We finally chance try tonight glad did! hidden gem desert would highly recommend checking out   Atmosphere classy relaxing  waiters menu suggestions attentiveness needs right mark  ordered house salad start two dinner entrees short ribs cajun shrimp pasta  Mmmmmm both good! We'll definitely back  <EOR> This place would better ratings if bartender didn't such catty rude attitude  Also drinks made consistently  Should probably consider having two bartenders before 9pm since current can't seem keep everyone drink wait time way long lack bodies building  <EOR> I absolutely love place!! cutest decor amazing menu! recon cheese platter share raspberry mojito!! <EOR> I loved dining experience here  husband moved Chicago feel truly difficult find nice restaurants neighborhood without having downtown  You're left lot chains suburbs but Sparklings really hit mark food quality service          Now when typically just two us  also reservations advance overall try avoid peak times  all things simply common sense if want ensure expedient service     If big party your food take longer because all orders your table being made isn't chain prepackaged foods  why came instead your local Outback whatever          If didn't reservation walk Friday night you're going wait table    If come Sunday morning bottomless mimosas every other Becky restaurant don't expect refilled instant  guzzle bottom barrel champagne because want your moneys worth     Now admit places never return based repetitive occurrences poor quality just absolutely abysmal service but reading some 1 star reviews believe entitlement   Most reviewers give 1 star find basically always give 1 star   Honestly can't take anyone serious more half reviews being 1 star    Like if always bad service experience when look common denominator!

It looks unassuming outside but inside nicely decorated great ambiance  girlfriend said cute least 10 times while there    They also nice little bar area filled up    The menu lot appealing options  Pretty upscale cuisine but prices very reasonable  Food excellent    Lastly waiter Jason awesome very helpful  Knowledgeable friendly    Loved place! <EOR> I Sunday brunch veggie benedict  flavor good more around four stars  overcooked two eggs but replaced when alerted them  dessert bit disappointing  out three trio items creme Brule bit more tart chocolate brownie type item only average ice cream just standard ice cream  I'd say based desserts may strong point  service professional  bad just most impressive  <EOR> The inside restaurant beautiful  entered waited host stand several minutes before wandering into bar find someone seat us  did gave menus  20 minutes passed waiter arrived took drink entree orders  Someone else brought food out chicken sandwich minimal toppings bun exceeded sandwich lacked any flavor  $30 pork loin tasted bed Uncle Ben's rice  No came back ask meal until time ask if we'd dessert  restaurant only 3 other tables serve which large unclear if server many people help wasn't enough staff service strength  <EOR> This place hidden gem    decor very pleasing beautiful colors paint walls beautiful flower arrangements sitting areas    love fact thre various rooms where book larger group offers more privacy   thought booking celebrate special Birthday other occasion    food very reasonably priced   Service good pleasantly surprised   glad tried it  <EOR> My husband absolutely love place!!! love much decided wedding reception here  food always   and mean always delicious!!!

Does sense??  First all seen some yelp reviews bookmarked place  While Rainbow decided those places wanted see all about   When seated almost your Internet Cafe everyone lap tops phones! Well free WiFi why not?  Anyway decided appetizer   crab spinach dip which $8  Sounded good! When came waiter made sure say if did enough pita bread could order more  course fee Pita Bread 3pcs $1 6pcs $2  course enough order more  very good! Hot great taste  2 different ways serve pita fried grilled  Both good but fried really addicting dip! Just small triangle pieces plate full  plenty dip worth trying   Then ordered Spaghetti Meat Sauce which $11  came pretty good size bowl waiter added some fresh grated cheese if want  also good  Came ala carte   nothing else it  No bread no salad nothing  If request bread charged   So why 3 stars? Because places nickle dime everything  If want fine dining restaurant then charge bit more but give people reason want come back! Bread pasta common thing almost everyplace serves pasta always serves bread usually always unlimited   Then appetizer why charge $10 include enough pita don't pay more because did enough   Great atmosphere nice chandelier hanging but won't bring back  food good service good hopefully some changes menu   Would back? Maybe sometime  anytime soon  <EOR> We came engagement dinner also lunch  place great food good selection  decor amazing very tasteful yet casual  only thing keeps them five stars came guy host bartender server halfway through lunch busser came in  Last time much more organized but other great place  <EOR> Spectacular! service great food outstanding  shepherds pie amazing! haven't anything didn't enjoy   This perfect place girls brunch romantic dinner large gathering  <EOR> The Sparklings reportedly gets its name immense atmospheric chandelier prominently display center restaurant but might well describe incredible flavor value just everything menu   Such extensive menu specials rainbow trout served light portion steak entree everywhere between menu nicely priced high quality  barstaurant open until wee hours morning serves familiar fine dining food comfort food prices   The atmosphere old school country club Rat Pack Frank Sinatra Sr  Sammy Davis Jr  friends meets movie Cocktail' young Tom Cruise Elizabeth Shue Bryan Brown meets television serial comedy Cheers   bar area integral experience but subtly segregated dining room providing different environment dining room  If your crew need intimate setting unwind bar place  If couple date without toddlers tow dining room might more your liking  discrete environment where jet set aren't bothered paparazzi young neighborhood folks acknowledge each other politely   Obviously neighborhood locals kind place where everybody knows your name employees working beautiful example New Vegas culture demonstrate pronounced culture treating every guest Brown Derby everybody movie star!   I recommend cheese platter aforementioned Rainbow Trout if available Pan Seared Salmon if not Ribeye Spaghetti Meat Sauce French Onion soup Lobster Bisque Caesar Salad many more Food Network worthy New American cuisine treats  bar recommend Angel's Gin Tonic extra lime  <EOR> I don't understand why place always dead because food delicious prices pretty good  thought when first ate bad place going business because really it   I've gone back few times help keep business but think it'll need more help  Go! <EOR> Really cute place good service good prices average food  probably back friends but food something would ever crave  <EOR> Trendy classy decoration newly opened restaurant  same owner Oyshi sushi  Very spacious dinning area bar lounge private rooms  Great cocktails Happy hour 30% off everyday 5 10 pm  Reasonable price  Tasty ribeye flat bread honey  <EOR> The sparklings place visit friends weekend brunch during day business lunch weekend nights drink friends  interior stunning definitely doesn't match exterior harshness  expected something attuned lodge presently surprised when wasn't  FOOD! truffle corn pretty special  sucker feta truffle all  standout definitely mushroom portobello fries  came two sauces just doctor ordered  back friends  <EOR> I came sparkling twice    The first time really enjoyed dinner services great    Second time horrible  large group fiancé going away dinner med school  steaks cold  food all tasted bland  happy experience  <EOR> Food good  Service friendly  Restaurant slow  Nice place nice atmosphere  <EOR> Delicious food fantastic flavor  loved mix match sliders we meatball fish Bloody Mary kabobs apps  meatball delicious fish cooked just right  kabobs sautéed mushrooms perfectly cooked full great seasonings  Next Caesar salad dressing tasted mix traditional dressing hint Italian  great  Steak Diane which amazing mashed potatoes fried onion strings green beans mushrooms  good won't soon forgotten  husband enjoyed shrimp chicken Cajun pasta best flavors ever tasted  hot but very tasty  If haven't you're missing out! <EOR> I really don't understand place such high ratings!? Worst food EVER restaurant! ordered gnocchi sliders ribeye steak walnut beet salad chicken fingers kids  Gnocchi ok sliders worst ever salad dressing bland served beets chicken fingers looked came Costco's frozen isle side Hidden Valley ranch cannot mistaken steak embarrassment them even send out! asked steak prepared medium far past well done  Because steak gray color lacked flavor thought may boiled it   gross! addition service horrible since 2 waiters entire restaurant while quite busy   decor looks really nice entrance but minute sit look around nothing sense  Never going back!   Ps soap dispensers restrooms work <EOR> My wife Anniversary  Very appealing atmosphere wait staff excellent  dinners top notch definitely coming back! <EOR> The Sparkling wonderful cozy intimate dinning experience won't sorry decided patronize  say intimate its perfect romantic date night but does few larger tables even separate room larger parties   The wait staff warm approachable ready recommendations based restaurant told them push   I Jambalaya regular readers know much love properly cooked Cajun food  being said when tell 2nd best Jambalaya since moving Vegas know its damn good   The Fiancé clam linguine wasn't impressed  pasta cooked perfectly but sauce itself bland Clams little itty bitty shriveled Clams if served customer should pulled medium sized shells just prevent extra work remove them cause question why clam meat shrunk size?  She sent dish back refused all requests remake dish refund cost meal  didn't say no cheese cake brought over though  delicious   We shared two appetizers fries almost perfection flat bread dishes Fiancée loved dish only let little taste    Highly recommended!
