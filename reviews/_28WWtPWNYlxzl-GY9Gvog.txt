Taste bad service bad slow  forced give tip  bother come! <EOR> Living Texas yet find decent xiao long bao place meets standard decided hunt during Vegas trip  Despite reading low reviews mostly bad service family decided give place try  Spicy City's darn tempting poster caught me!   The highlight experience absolutely NO spoke English  called ahead lady could answer simple yes no question  She told English wasn't very good then awkwardly hung phone  When arrived waiter also didn't speak English  waiter kept speaking Mandarin me  could understand bits pieces he said made effort order rack little Chinese Mandarin knew  waiter scoffed scold broken English knowing Chinese when Chinese kept telling Chinese both Mandarin English  brother joked if no speaks English then did paperwork?? top off he's screaming Amigo! Amigo! worker while madly waving arms throwing crazy sign language him    Aside pork xiao long bao served its purpose! juicy broth tasty  best compared Joe's Shanghai NY but satisfied craving  beats most  called xiao long bao other restaurants where broth absorbed into dumpling there's no drop soup coming out  place gets EXTRA star decent xiao long bao!  In conclusion now understand why Spicy City deserved its low ratings service  found experience more HILARIOUS MEMORABLE anything  entertaining story tell over over Chinese friends  Although only xiao long bao food seemed authentic see mostly Chinese families Chinese tour buses eating here  highly recommend coming someone speaks Mandarin least having Mandarin speaking friend FACETIME order you  Hopefully won't scolded speaking Chinese even meeting halfway trying your damnest communicate!!
