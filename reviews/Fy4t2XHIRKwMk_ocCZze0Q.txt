price meal outstanding  steak equal greater quality Ruth Chris other higher end joints Vegas ther service price coupon can't place   The only negative things place ways off Stip  least 15 minute walk Encore 10 minute walk Las Vegas Hilton  Also place dead around 7 15 Friday night  didn't stop having good time tho but did wait 15 minutes dinner cab  <EOR> I little bit mixed emotions restaurant   I franchise but really nothing unique it  wait person Josh excellent  He awesome personality he knows stuff he's worked decade  obvious he loves he does  main chef also came around introduce himself check diners  think I'd back because wonderful service   It's very typical steakhouse dimly lit elegant pricey  Just any higher end steakhouses $45 65 only meat any sides purchase  side dishes $10 12 only good 2  We ordered 8 10 oz steaks peppercorn sauce any sauce extra $2 sauteed spinach popular creamed corn which found just ok glasses moscato chocolate souffle la mode topped ball choco rice crispies i thought crispies necessary maybe goal add texture dessert but souffle icecream fine themselves   appreciate offered butterfly steaks = less wait time I recommend check when Las Vegas but then might okay miss too  <EOR> My husband couple nights ago Thursday 530p  1st customers  Service great  used $75 restaurant com certificate drinks included  Must spend $150 $75 off  ordered yellow sashimi Caesar salad appetizers  Sashimi great salad so  Entree ordered Seabass hubby ordered ribeye  Both entrees excellent  sides signature creamed corn truffle fries  Fries good but couldn't finish

big spread those hotel buffets strip but food did pretty decent quality  Pretty damn decent I'd say   The traditional breakfast foods  eggs very well done however sausage bit tasteless   omlettes making order seemed big hit decent wait them     The seafood probably worst part buffet   say bad  just wasn't great  oysters great crab legs mediocre best shrimp slightly above average     The desserts didn't but friend ate every single dessert she she made take picture clean dessert plate was    The best part everything unlimited alcohol form wine champagne mimosas     The whole meal accompanied old dude playing old American beats grand piano something 30 60+ year olds clapping along continuously toasting     Overall I'd definitely back Envy just cheap but good meal especially if want headstart towards getting myself plastered  <EOR> Service slow inattentive overpriced  Walked breakfast standing counter 5 minutes  Had actually lay down booth act sleeping any attention refresh

Doesn't much better that   We split Envy Signature prime bone in ribeye $42 which good piece meat if little fatty even ribeye which tends fatty itself but cooked pretty perfectly we ordered medium rare but came little medium around edges    Oh did charge $5 split plate fee   We also ordered two sides truffle mashed potatoes $11 bourbon creamed corn $8    mashed potatoes very tasty compliment steak plus love truffles doesn't?    While obsessed creamed corn girl indeed best creamed corn ever had    bourbon flavors melded perfectly   Both highly recommended although truffle fries looked excellent well   All all going 4 stars   better steakhouses but legitimate option would prefer patron smaller restaurants opposed chains although Envy downstairs hotel also within walking distance Mortons Lawrys    Service good food good prices reasonable Vegas $120 cocktails tip although split portion portions large even splitting both uncomfortably stuffed ambiance nice   I'd back    <EOR> We celebrate birthday nicest time  ordered scallop chicken lobster bisque lobster Mac n cheese bourbon cream corn mushroom carrot cake chocolate cake  LOVE everything food delish staff nice place nice comfy  would back celebrate special occasion again sure  <EOR> Fancy pricey more hardware glassware count  Extremely attentive polite staff  heirloom tomato appetizer hard green tomato flavorless  extra firm red tomato  heirloom mattell family  Caesar salad nice small but nice  Shrimp cocktail three colossal shrimp extra firm  tough cut  guess impressed three stars generous very generous  Each dish photo perfect some would impressive  think did enough read none drink precursor dinner   guess just move along  Sorry ENVY  <EOR> OMG Chef John Walsh Matthew waiter totally turned most hated food brussel sprouts into culinary delight taste buds!
