<EOR> This first time Crazy Pita beyond yummy   staff very nice sweet food delicious ! also excited sell Kind gear support Josh Foundation too! Keep great work guys back soon! <EOR> I'm surprised all 4 5 star ratings   lunch Town Square location few years ago wasn't impressed all forgot it   when boyfriend DS hungry pita sounded healthy option there   restaurant clean food looks good photos   both ordered chicken pita he ordered side salad ordered side fries   took while probably 20 minutes food thought would fresh hot   Instead pita lukewarm   chicken pita flavorless dry veggies pita watery   whole sandwich mess   reminded I'd before because eat sandwich knife fork   fries very small portion probably frozen fresh although better frozen fries home because least hot   bf's salad pretty much same veggies put sandwich   remember didn't care place next time run into it  <EOR> Food great! Definitely worth wait  I'd rather wait good food cooked correctly   Just remember Mediterranean food can't done right 5 minutes   Just wait we'll worth wait  <EOR> I waiting fior day come F   ok!!! No chicken really dinner time too   First timer never back   Oh BTW when come ASK receipt otherwise you're  waiting nothing until figure out!!! <EOR> Oh gosh love Crazy Pita frequent all three locations town  truly local business trio locations owned guy  All three strengths weaknesses but all three serve absolutely delicious food    If you're looking healthy eats your place  Sure plate french fries if must but grilled skewers Mediterranean vegetables hummus olive oil Greek salad fluffy couscous good your body! go to mixed skewer plate $15 chicken shrimp  plate comes hearty skewer grilled chicken breast skewer grilled shrimp couscous tasty veggies including squash zucchini amazing feta salad topped olives chopped tomatoes cucumbers feta little side hummus pita bread white whole wheat     The portions may hearty but prices certainly hefty  eat before movie dinner two sodas runs little over $40 00 tax   almost much eating sit down full service restaurant!  But old adage pay food seriously top notch  Quality ingredients happy tummy  also noticed employees all locations cut above most fast food workers  Think In N Out quality employees     There couple minor negatives however  First let's talk hummus  know Crazy Pita probably wants dumbed down hummus appeals non adventurous eaters but version pretty lame  also watery thin doesn't even taste resemble traditional hummus I want thick hummus topped olive oil ! provide communal olive oil container soda machine but low quality oil least tastes it  Second really really hate when place order register pay via credit card system automatically prompts add tip  tip? what?! despise many places guilt tripping customers into tacking 20% more reward person simply doing job  tip someone taking order? No thanks   Overall Crazy Pita tops  can't wrong anything menu  Yes expensive pricey really quickly if order soda sides   But give try know you'll love it! <EOR> I'm digging place!!! tried chicken steak skewer dishes absolutely amazing!  Everything fresh tastes great moderately priced  staff always friendly keep place pretty clean   So far no complaints hope stays way  love fact open just little bit later other restaurants mall   Even though Yelp says open till 9PM fact they're open till 9 30PM least Friday's    Another great thing place literally less 3 minutes away house if ever graving some Mediterranean food then know exactly where go!  Perfect place perfect location great food service    more ask for?  2 thumbs way Crazy Pita!!! Woohoo!!! <EOR> I really enjoyed food here  shared plate boyfriend 2 skewers plenty us  Definitely tahini side try some pita it's good!   restaurant itself fast food atmosphere but employees way personally serve food smile  <EOR> When comes rotisserie chicken think place great choice  GREAT marinade chicken could probably stuff face once week    The hummus decent falafel average  combo family plate comes whole chicken sides great value meal  service amazing  nice option healthy lunch during your shopping time! <EOR> I wish could give place better rating because service fantastic start finish but all food    We kefta plate hummus vegetable cous cous salad side falafel  Meat falafel dominated cumin which favorite ruined me  Salad lacked flavor could easily brought life added vinegar fresh lemon salt  rid cous cous rice  horribly dry lackluster  Hummus good  Tzatziki horrible  Tastes store bought onion dip  Highly suggest google authentic tzatziki recipe follow it   filled bellies between shopping but won't back  Some easy fixes could massively improve flavor most dishes  I'm food snob  love good flavors  Sorry sorry  <EOR> Yum! smell meet being grilled needs bottled sold cologne! staff great even when line door things seem track food amazing! love steak kabobs humus awesome too! Glad see close home! pita bread warm fresh! Going try some more things when back! Lunch always packed before 1150 am! <EOR> Very mediocre   Coming Detroit area where fantastic authentic Mid Eastern food almost every corner found place sub par    Hummus thick flavorful   watery bland   When asked side Tahini Falafel waiter told already Hummus Duh  hummus   Israeli salad ok but call something else  Don't see going back   Can't win em all! <EOR> We tried Falafel pita lamb pita falafel spicy but overly overall tastes good  lamb meat soft pretty good too  Both came fries side little overdone  servings smaller side plate sections filled ketchup hummus would nicer more authentic  Overall good experience sure would way return  <EOR> I've Crazy Pita twice now  vegetable skewer first time falafel platter second time  also dolmas  loved food  service good restaurant very clean  wish two fountain drink stations because wait line drink  fancy coke machine add flavor to  prices reasonable   going again  <EOR> Second visit Kefta plate Veggie amazing Hummus perfect! Staff bonus super nice quick clean Meal good know want eat hungering before even  Quick service open kitchen see right while they're cooking I choose your own soda machine beginning see more often cool being able switch between ton different drinks been rockin caffeine free sparkling water lately <EOR> Decent spot some quick Mediterranean food    Was pretty packed around 6 pm when in  Crowd started dispersing quickly though  food within 10 mins ordering    Got Crazy Pita Salad added chicken  Salad great size everything chopped small loaded cucumbers! Made very easy eat  However chicken skewer pretty overcooked charred dry  Didn't really care feta cheese either  sure kind use but your typical crumbly variety  mushy sticks together  very hard put your food if side  Overall everything decent    I love pita here  your typical whole wheat hard floury pita more fluffy white bread  Comes warm which really nice    Key lime pie amazing!

Though confused dug in  Immediately realized lamb served HUGE chunks should cut down three four smaller pieces so watch that most pita full cut cucumbers which tasted slightly odd   pita would much better if wasn't constantly cutting lamb chunks spreading tzatziki every few bites if served feta cheese!
