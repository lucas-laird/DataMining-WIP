Really?  all say  world live in?  Food fine  But handcrafted ice???? <EOR> Zuma love zuma dooo    But real good ridiculous  feel spoiled ourselves pretty much every other sushi place ever because just top notch quality  Your taste buds sing  praises your wallet cry  But WORTH!   Note portions minuscule! basically tapas but smaller  Example ordered king crab believe 42$ came 2 ounces meat finger licking butter sauce  If afford pay teased if skip plate crazy small lol said would eat again again again?   The semi fatty tuna salmon nigiri  still dreams it  ribs literally fell off bone delicious would insult    Only thing didn't salmon tuna tartar actual fish yummy but accompanied rice cakes use dipping things tastes just clashed    Talking accompaniments use eat everything comes meant way! Except rice crackers lol  Example lime came ribs squeezed all over ribs elevated taste    Soft shell crab amazing came wasabi mayo which best mayo    How here? cosmopolitan hotel park self parking near area signs Boulevard Tower Elevators park ! There's signs know floor restaurant exit elevator super close easy don't walk across entire casino if factor    Super comfortable bar seating both high low chairs! <EOR> My friend treated place food amazing  When steak first came warm juicy oh tender  Then when cold surprise still delicious  lobster mmmm just smell enough fill stomach  Overall truly satisfying experience Vegas !  Special shoutout to SungHa Heemo! Super chill people <EOR> My wife came Friday night expecting some good Japanese food which favorite   ordered Premium Omakase menu which tax tip 2 drinks ran around $500     Now price expect meal absolutely perfect but few things found poorly executed brought experience down notch   I think thing bothered most noise level which extremely loud dance music   know Vegas but simply louder expected such high end meal   come expecting quiet romantic meal     The food all very good but $500 meal level good   presentation spot but various itmes sub par   sushi portion example good but transcendent would expect price point   Food volume pacing also issue   literally served 15 separate dishes   made very uneven pace meal longer 2 hours long gaps between courses wife felt going die much ate   wish gotten fewer dishes higher quality   The service immaculate can't say enough nice staff were     The decor great especially main bar which solid tree trunk cool!  All all good food but worth price imo  <EOR> We staying Cosmo decided try place out  food AMAZING  Everything ate cooked perfection  service great too  eat quickly take all plates wipe down table you're sitting talking drinking all your plates all over table  Definitely would recommend come back!! <EOR> Ambiance dark trendy overall very nice  Food excellent  favorite dishes tomato eggplant salad  spicy tuna roll actually spicy unlike most places  Service attentive friendly  green tea banana cake dessert very good  only downside prices very high  <EOR> Bryan bartender worth going Zuma  He friendly much fun watch  drinks some best Vegas  saying lot <EOR> Very nice place definitely feels escape mega resort casino which sits   All staff friendly attentive food fantastic   standout wagyu sushi cheap but good enough ordered seconds   All sushi above average Hawaii spoiled probably very good better description signature cocktails worth try   There certainly lot Sushi places Vegas its hard say I'd back short order want try others but would recommend place sure  <EOR> Zuma Sushi inside Cosmo is  if best  best dining spots Vegas   most amazing sushi ever tried ambience perfect   If you're looking ultimate Vegas experience celebrate something special recommend spot!
