The best part Baguette Cafe perhaps unsurprisingly bread  Everything else wasn't quite top caliber  solid neighborhood cafe see why people fans but I'd only consider if passing highway rare because live Henderson planning trip newly opened IKEA store nearby likely happen sooner latter   definitely destination might expect Top 100 spot be  <EOR> Baguettes done right!  After being told many people Baguette Cafe must stop finally found myself area time stop by   Using google directions through yelp takin little off course  If your using google directed other side cooperate buildings  Simply turn into car park drive through closer highway   Visiting weekday during lunch time expected line blew through pretty quick  owner very nice time chat  He recommended chicken curry  Both amazing!

Baguette Cafe extremely easy because not super sweet sweets beautiful look taste!   I must start savory! very decent sized menu includes quiche breakfast sandwiches salads cold sandwiches grilled sandwiches usually 2 homemade soups  those soups almost always vegan  Today Brussel Sprout Creamy Pumpkin  opted Brussel Sprout FANTASTIC  savory creamy VEGAN  would put money fact least cream chicken stock velvety perfect green soup  tried chicken pesto sandwich delicious today 3 Cheese chicken  LOVE goat cheese put perfect amount pair tomato basil pesto  3 Cheese prosciutto before well next time doing bacon not actually menu just sounds good ! sandwiches come simply dressed mixed greens  If you'd heftier salad recommend Crunchy Green often find jicama salad!  Okay now tarts!!! pretty infamous chocolate tart which decadent! enjoyed amazing mixed berry apricot too  But today lucky enough run into plum cinnamon tart two flavors together perfect  crust made GREAT butter! If know anything baking especially French treats use amazing butter  place beautiful pieces seasonal fruit beautiful egg custard then into perfectly semi salted buttery crust  recommend starting crust beauty then working your way tip  only way better add perfect iced americano!
