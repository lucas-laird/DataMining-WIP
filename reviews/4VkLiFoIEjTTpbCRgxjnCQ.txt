The adults ordered fish entrees Salmon Pink Vodka Linguini Cod Fra Diavolo   start saying fish both dishes amazing!  salmon moist firm vodka sauce creamy delicious   cod dish perfectly cooked!  Light flaky very rich spicy diavolo sauce   spicy some but very garlicy rich!  The portion sizes huge would expected any real Italian establishment   waitress brought dishes immediately brought to go containers set them side us   no quitter finished plate into pasta coma later sofa but other 2 dishes barely noticeably dented before packing leftovers tonight yay   no cooking 2 nights row!     One most impressive things notice loved every order placed gets personally prepared view customers   watched ladies behind counter carefully prepared each dish served them up   No mass production here!  If any criticism all say patio furniture type chairs somewhat uncomfortable   When eating pasta tend almost stick face dish mitigate twirling pasta sauce projectiles reaching shirt which almost inevitable  also considered hosting kids b day part but tiny quaint space pretty limited   Very intimate small groups conversation   Maybe more suited date night couple glasses wine   Overall nice place delicious food!  Definitely back try some other dishes  <EOR> Just three year old today  Place small looks busy  Waiter brought water 15 min sat down  waited another 20 min before made hand gesture waive them back staff saw knotted  right door watched two tables water fast then ordered before wow! Attempted waive them down again nothing  yes busy but only maybe six tables whole place  Maybe because gym clothes dressed fives other patrons but damn! really looking forward trying food again but guess didn't feel serving today  place must making much money pick choose customers now  Hit miss good luck place enjoy wait time    P S don't come hungry ! <EOR> I came talked owner bit before ordering food  He suggested special which point  Afterwards talked some more he told he initially tried cook authentic Italian food but people didn't he switched recipes resemble something in between American Italian authentic Italian  special he cooked more authentic Italian which why he suggested me  Yeah spot on  American Italian terrible  Terrible  hard find authentic Italian restaurant States when should definitely order all time over American if prefer American Italian style need really work your taste buds because authentic Italian food awesome  long really well owner when come order tell cook authentic Italian  <EOR> Daaaannngggg!

Seen though server oblivious fact upset decided speak manager the same gentleman seen earlier talking customer next us   Come find name Robert  When explained problem Robert didn't seem really care  then ahead asked if owners available he proceeds start bashing them unprofessionally  He tell no longer he new owner once asked if he manager     He then starts spewing information previous owners didn't pay bills books upside down all stuff which a none business customer b shows type people running place  Needless say EXTREMELY unprofessional!  The funny thing when he first approached table asked if he spoke Italian I am Italian myself disgust answers no! rude!  He then leaves doesn't really apologize few minutes later waiter drop off to go container table    My husband bit confused waiter dropped off  opened bag to go tiramisu  asked waiter he didn't even know himself! put two two together figured probably some sort apology Robert  Robert never even stopped table telling he sorry he giving tiramisu? just weird! He did walk front table quite few times but never even looked nothing    We also noticed food changed previous owners  fresh pasta raw calamari slimy  pretty horrible  such shame previous owners left  always friendly best food truly unfortunate someone Robert feels right spread such mean private information such humble respectable people! Just Robert's behavior never return!! <EOR> Great! Great service food   Right start smell pasta air outstanding clean Grade 'A' establishment then quick delicious meals course fantastic price large servings food   know favorite Italian food restaurant now takeout also place easy plenty parking   Loved it! <EOR> We've going Spaghetty Western since first opened  food always amazing flavorful Italian dishes just Italy  However when expanded quality food service changed  usually order Chicken Piccata Chicken Francese  Now dishes NO flavor  bad because best Italian restaurants off strip  <EOR> Let preface review saying grew Italian household grandma made BEST sauce EVER  sure lot people understand sentiment even own person best sauce ever  Now being said say place comes solid second which good gets   I LOVE tomato sauce  favorite dishes Chicken Milanese  simple dish however its simplicity really allows all flavor come through delicious! Another dish really enjoy Pasta Carbonara husband loves Pasta Diablo   The staff also great just love coming here! even brush little basic Italian skills which happy  xD Great hole in the wall Italian place! <EOR> Food ok but last time ordered lasagne  no bread just piece lasagne  Ok but seems gone down hill  moved other italion restaurants where more bang buck <EOR> Food really good authentic Italian made fresh right then there  though  place aiming high end would think could work ambiance  definitely par prices food    One more minor complaint tiny little bag Lays brand chips does accent amazing sandwiches have  need better sides  hey know PASTA?!

Very sad! Considering guys seem authentic Italians mention am half Italian grew Italy am disappointed way choose represent culture!  Deplorable customer service  Management couldn't care less  Legitimately shocked place managed somewhat decent reviews  <EOR> I tried restaurant first time great definitely back! dined lunch time chicken parmigiana sandwich  came timely manner amazing  huge portions left stuffed! <EOR> We because neighborhood decided try out  restaurant itself really small only few tables   service good but food just ok bit pricey side  definitely better Italian food  <EOR> Cibo Squisito   Now does tell legitimacy italian restaurant if want google language something witty begin review with? Ha ha   I don't know where start honest much touch upon but bottom line place legit top contender area years come! strip mall located quite echelon when comes culinary gems Spaghetty Western no exception!  I'm quite sad Dad moving area but being introduced some top notch food certainly parting gift even deal with  family owned he does frequent enough he able build rapor owner family  rarity something can't teach nor replace when comes type stuff  opportunity meet them well first impression alone tell put hearts into making place run well oiled machine    From remember visit instant popularity people everywhere being such small venue turned people away didn't stick waiting table their loss   take reservations which hearing above should no brainer ensure your experience 5 stars beyond mine  Dad mentioned expanding into vacant business next them right tells aware issue put every inch good use    The menu itself pretty much something everyone any walk life but set myself success going simple selecting spaghetti meatballs  partnered penne pasta occasion meatball enough slap across face yell Ciao Bella rooftops each bite digests  pasta soft seemingly melted away consumed  Between marinara sauce meatball those alone blew away  marinara thick texture but really coated pasta well came swinging flavored masterfully  All left say which wish culinary turrets MEATBALLS MEATBALLS MEATBALLS! off chain honestly best ever date  MUST TRY! bit spicing but very moist circular slabs delicious here! apparently giggle magnet table even gave appearance once retired Kobayashi wiggle first bite  know you've ace when your food does your body!  Another highlighted point which would disservice if mentioned lobster ravioli  wife stopped talking good 2 months now stop tracks crazy  amount lobster does equal price tag even shocked amount used maybe piece whole lobster famiglia! seven pieces total but filling no less  sampling myself put last meal list when die feeling royalty!  If ever neighborhood need escape strip life 10 minute drive won't sorry any means  hope continue grow within area cross fingers them branch California someday  doubt would case though but testament them I'd drive 4 hours event meatball meat sweats  Ha ha!
