Will back  <EOR> We came Sunday night only other table  interior looks clean new but really should turned around left moment stepped inside  particularly sensitive greasy smoky restaurant smell well place smelled rancid grease  sure going ventilation system if even functioning one     Service wasn't bad  sitting down getting water ordering server relayed message kitchen wait longer expected due large takeout order   We thought just leaving then tipping water service  Usually don't mind little wait but smell agonizing  Ultimately decided stay food but outside cold couple times some fresh air    The food came within timeframe given server okay though nearly good enough sit through another meal inside  If weather nice might convinced come back dine outdoor area  Seriously though decor looks clean someone put some thought into why cheap ventilation?! <EOR> Hit spot  ordered tekka don chirashi bowl him  Both bowls definitely constructed love  Each roughly 8 pieces fish including large flower piece  good place dinner if need quiet spot  <EOR> Went lunch Friday  opening time lunch 11 30 am not 11 am noted yelp   business changed opening time some point times clearly edited door   needed done 12 pm felt little rushed  BTW two other parties also showed around 11 am so think time changed recently all using yelp   Restaurant clean cozy nice decor tables  all ordered lunch specials each $8 1 Salted saba mackerel 2 teriyaki salmon 3 beef teriyaki  All came miso IMO could hotter warmer but likely because just opened small bowl rice entree all great flavor fresh salad plate homemade honey mustard dressing not Japanese ginger dressing FYI but very tasty fresh     Good meal but hungrier usual because skipped breakfast found myself hungry hour later I think partly could solved more rice bowl seemed bit skimpy     Would return? Yes think so  <EOR> So happy find Ichiban again Ballys!!!  Always good food good service    NEVER fails!  Everything always fresh good!!! <EOR> We came dinner Saturday night month ago place dead  No front when walked but employees quickly ran greet us  first thing she told new restaurant didn't thier alcohol license yet  Then she asked if okay us  decided give them try plus didn't apply since don't drink alcohol anyway  walked table noticed restaurant empty  think husband even said wow no loud  server explained real busy during lunch but dinner because everyone wants drink  Obviously LOL  restaurant very clean but no decor  Even TV behind sushi bar unplugged    The food alright  Nothing outstanding but wasn't horrible either  ordered Zaru Soba Spicy California Roll  gave good portion soba although definitely tasted better  California Rolls never anything special no matter where but took lazy route put some type hot sauce roll  wasn't actually mixed crab meat  husband ordered Katsu Don sushi roll forgot name nice presentation  He said food ok  Service friendly attentive as should since only customers     Apparently restaurant used Bally's  Thier chopstick wrappers still say Bally's them well  Nothing special say place  think good service clean restaurant but need maybe step thier game when comes food  good potential but thier restaurant continue empty if serve mediocre food! <EOR>
