Not sure if shorted drink #2 combo if somehow doesn't come but adding cheese essential maintaining WC taste  $6 four piece meal bad lunch  <EOR> Ordered Grub hub today wasn't sure expect  werent disappointed when food showed up    The burgers exactly expecting very similar white castle sliders  Pretty tasty though  real winners though fries easily some best fries long time    For price some damn good food  <EOR> This place terrible! Save your money anywhere else! place open few months now seeing Groupon decided give try  When looked location realized located inside Arco gas station Craig Rancho   that should first red flag right there  When presented Groupon told couldn't accepted because Groupon system down  Ok    but paper print right here   But still cashier refused  some convincing along few choice words he accepted Groupon placed order   About 5 10 min later received order which pretty reasonable given cashier appeared only working joint  pretty much hole wall back gas station convenience store isn't pretty place all  only good thing prices dirt cheap however food garbage basically inedible  Expect your order because only enough counter space stools maybe 4 people   I'm sure anybody mess burger slider but managed to  sliders bland meat low quality lost appetite  fries would decent if weren't over salted but put much salt them basically salt lick  shakes terrible too   they basically tasted concoction ice milky water bleh! barely ate any food before stopped trashed all  absolute crap disgusting  If award Worst Las Vegas would #1 pick   I would come back even if food free would never recommend place anybody unless you're purchasing feed dog something    <EOR> It gas station burger place   Slightly better gas station microwave burrito but much better   Made stomachs hurt but least know where if am constipated   going give 3 stars but employees working without gloves lost star  <EOR> We excited try burgers made 30 min drive  shocked find dirty gas station  play safe ordered before ordered whole family  Took bite tasted microwaved burger super gross  ended driving totally disappointed    <EOR> Ok tried place first time today  saw groupon deal used that  located inside Arco gas station  Small window type place 2 bar seats available eat there    Their sliders supposed White Castle   Very similar look come onions pickles  choice cheese no cheese    I wanted love burgers  can't say did  patties tasted plain cheap frozen   add mustard ketchup disguise taste patties little  vanilla milk shake reminded frosty vanilla pudding  Nothing amazing    This place potential great idea  Maybe some tweaks food bring them next level  service fast friendly  gentleman helped seemed really excited enthused business  Kitchen counter area looked clean  more 2 5 review just friendly fast service  <EOR> Love some sliders fries awesome! Would nice if place sit but still worth 5 stars value flavor standpoint <EOR> Okay yes  am spoiled White Castle cause originally Chicago  did however keep open mind when visiting place drove all way Henderson experience   No matter tried could'nt come reason come back establishment   The location dismal really dirty gas station no parking nor drive thru no indoor seating   Upon arriving placed order given drink cups directions drink cup another customer   Food comes nondescript white brown paper bags  No logo anything indicated where food any packaging  should'nt matter though if good   It mildly remeniscient sliders White Castle but customer front two behind still wait ten minutes food   made think least would fresh  NOPE!  Stone cold dry!  Anyway come find man standing four feet whole time   thought he loiterer just obnoxious patron dressed street person   Come find he owner he made focus offend all seven people place before left   WOW!  If want disrespected sold low standard food there  Otherwise wait real deal future when White Castle opens strip   I really wanted good experience cause love sliders but    Oh well! <EOR> I really wanted place definately would everything wasn't salty  Fries completely unedible all salt burger meat heavily salted too   suggestion business would new salt shakers maybe holes big ones using offer salt free alternative  Shake very good no complaints there  <EOR> The fries way salty  stop eating them would gag salt  never salty any food anywhere gross  Ease salt  Burgers just ok  <EOR> This place closed  ordered Grub Hub pick blocked off inside gas station  Grub Hub called check if I'd gotten food then took them offline  Bummer they're still listed open! <EOR> The first time  came closed early some reason decided give them another chance earlier day     Today unfriendly cashier waited until paid food tell diet coke   Actually say drink then she let know only coke    no customer service skills extremely slow    Well rude reply owner certainly doesn't  help   dead issue far concerned because never give place another penny   However employees shouldn't say just ran something carry  <EOR> I now many times **so much ive almost filled punch card dozens  yipes!   service always great staff super friendly  delicious little cheeseburgers delight cant enough of! Its almost dangerous 45second drive house   so easy swing by  If havent  check place out! <EOR> Really much great comparison White Castle even frozen ones    give 2 1 2 stars although opening week maybe quality assurance better now   Was excited hear some White Castle 'competition' coming town Quickee Burgers   note no actual Quickee Burgers restaurant find jaunt into AM PM corner Craig Rancho home same strip mall where great Thai food albeit bar     Quickee Burgers located inside small area   Really only takeout no real seating anywhere unless add few stools eventually   order take home eat standing up   Found Groupon would feed two folks $10 but managed stretch four   Comes 10 Quickee Burgers cheese 2 orders fries 2 milkshakes we opted Black White combo vanilla chocolate    also picked free slice Red Velvet birthday cake when checking Yelp not sure if  still available    Order quick but prep really slow   Granted grand opening folks still trying learn communicate each other   15 minute wait order ready go   Honestly really disappointed quality Quickee Burgers burgers   tad larger ones White Castle but damn pretty flavorless   Buns good but cold side would helped warming grill   Burgers?  Dry bone lacked much flavor   Would benefit if cooked White Castle does poke holes burgers steam grilled onions below moisten flavor patty   Easily patties all overcooked lifeless   really sure if even used salt pepper them!  Condiments norm cheese some sort cheddar although bordering Kraft singles some onion bits pickle mustard ketchup   But still overall burger dry   ended adding some mayo mine them back par   Fries OK though   Thin salty but quite cooked enough   All limp before home   Maybe bit more time oil would made them much better   But taste good   Shakes pretty mediocre   Shakes light having much air mixing machine   close thick shake all but cheap soft serve   Plus cloyingly sweet!  Really artificial taste them probably shake mix   Wasn't favorite   Although looked super cheesy Red Velvet birthday cake actually pretty good   just plain sheet cake covered birthday frosting but cake itself moist     Was good effort Quickee Burgers   But think stick waiting until White Castle actually comes Las Vegas soon baby soon    just opt buying frozen ones local warehouse store reheat them pan   Unless quality your burger improves few bounds sure back anytime soon   Taste need taste!  THE QUICK DEAD  <EOR> I didn't food couldn't past server   burgers must made advance sit wait couldn't them without cheese  top no other customers site chef over 20 burgers grill  If want dried old food here  Otherwise even burger king burger when order it  <EOR> Seen establishment listed Groupon didn't think could eat ten hamburgers thought would stop purchase few  single double fries chocolate shake  Cheeseburgers tasted exactly White Castle  Call crazy but same great taste  place minimart which horrible location no seating  chocolate shake just vanilla shake chocolate syrup top  said burgers shake fries awesome  Cheeseburgers only 69 cents  wish drive thru  also 5 00 box 4 burgers fries drink  back!!!!! <EOR> If plan purchasing groupon keep mind does work online ordering  also cannot changes any order uses Groupon if allergies anything comes burger probably shouldn't purchase use Groupon  Cash only inside store  Good luck <EOR> Went tonight did last week dozen sliders no cheese 7 99 plus tax   pay guy said 10 something !!! said your sign says 7 99 !! He said now 9 99 plus tax !! said sign clearly states 12 quickie burgers without cheese 7 99   He would budge !!! told did want sliders if would give advertised price   did seem fair ? left without sliders !! Quickie lost good customer !!! <EOR> so tried picking some hookah supplies since same shopping center lets say worst mistake ever  fries stale salty  burgers tasted left freezer long time taste just weird  no reason come back  and honest since white castle opened vegas really isnt reason come unless your going gas arco   BTW anyone else noticed owner actually replies these? dude hire some knew cooks real   oh yea first review mainly because Ive never bad experience anywhere else <EOR> Nothing having multiple things wrong first time visit place   I came pretty much hour opened   groupon order 24 burgers 4 orders fries something 4 cakes   I told right off bat didn't any fries  asked if fries burger ratio could worked out    I notion getting burgers made fresh no pickles but also wasn't cards today  told between recently made big order getting supply shipment yet wouldn't able any freshly made burgers without pickles    Fortunately cashier able work decent fries burger ratio she threw couple extra burgers cakes   The burgers tasted frozen then microwaved White Castle  red velvet cakes tasted grocery store sheet cakes  honestly think since happy birthday type decorative frosting it   I expecting much food all tasted expected to  Frozen patty burgers gas station  some unforeseeable snags but good customer service made it  won't way eat again but might swing if am area hungry strapped cash  <EOR> I back give place another shot because don't want just give new business mediocre experience  time ended just leaving without buying any food because they've apparently changed rules any modifications burgers  sure if cashier just being lazy if really norm now  Please    food establishment people food allergies! won't very far if you're unwilling exceptions  <EOR> I want give place higher rating because fabulous young lady took order but unfortunately food wasn't good   Quickee located inside ARCO gas station corner Rancho Craig   Believe me    this prime location some people watching   if know mean!  The menu limited cheeseburgers fries soda black white which version shake   cheeseburgers small White Castle   onions pickles cheese mustard them    For fast food guess ok   don't hold fry In Out burgers sure   bread soggy patty pretty flavorless  fries came lukewarm weren't anything above average taste   The service great though within 10 minutes    best thing shake   would back them if hankering shake again   wouldn't return location dark however  <EOR>
