Haven't back very long time  <EOR> These people far most uneducated rude people ever met  service terrible  ordered probably 8 times give them benefit doubt every single time wrong  absolutely no customer service skills far worst place ever seen  Lost business life  <EOR> Heard good took chance ordering  got BBQ chicken pizza  to surprise good   ordered potatoe skins stuff jalapeno fish chips  Got home realized no stuff jalapenos   called them    I stuff jalapeno another BBQ pizza just trouble  Great Customer service! Great Food! ordered again no problems   things happens  they fixed it   would returned if didn't provide good service  am satisfied customer! <EOR> The staff very attentive didn't seem pay attention front counter all  pizza bit cold side curious methods keeping pizzas hot while waiting picked up? much box wasn't even warm when held bottom  boneless wings sat sauce rather being coated them average taste but also cold temperature   However opinion pizza indeed very tasty although sauce didn't seem present visually taste spot on  crust also very enjoyable    All all may order again but would recommend waiting around picking your food once finished avoid getting cold product  However just don't think food service worth money spent  <EOR> The food might good wouldn't know  ordered combo appetizer potato skins salad wings cheeseburger fries  completely forgot ALL dressings condiments    I called asked them deliver 3 ranch dressings sour cream marinara sauce medium buffalo sauce ketchup mustard mayonnaise forgot  female said she manager simply said No offered $2 credit paid $3 50 extra sauce I told paid xtra sauces items edible without dressings salad dipping sauces now cold appetizers burger included fries but no ketchup mustard mayo  told fault  worked F B whole life $2 credit wasn't acceptable  She asked address name simply said OK bye next time give $2 credit hung up   So $62 dinner untouched called credit card company disputed charge services products rendered  understand drivers forget things mistakes made but management chose handle situation unacceptable business less 2 miles home    Never Again <EOR> This BEST pizza since living Vegas 10 yrs!   pizza snob NY  wings still crispy when home  very liberal cheese pizza  Absolutely best! continue here  impressed!!! <EOR> I don't know  usual pizza place food pretty decent but always something wrong really place hit miss  gone pick arriving estimated wait still having wait good 10 minutes restaurant bar  when I'd already paid online would still ask payment when restaurant  When would tell waitress already paid she just said oh nothing else  if knew? Why would ask pay again? if didn't wouldn't least verify indeed paid? Something missing there  then course more occasions they've gotten order wrong only discovered when did home  Today instead wings chicken fingers which did care for  pizza also unusually dry lacking enough cheese never any problems pizza before  Very disappointing say least  don't think return even if most times food decent  <EOR> We've ordered place twice now  Best thing they're open super late your late night cravings  Which could bad thing    Two things made give place 3 stars Service quality food   On service seem take very long time delivery  took over 2 hours first time 1 1 2 hours second time when told within hour  last time ordered took hour half contact them status  When pizza wings came pizza cold    The food Garlic knots bites  Delicious  If you've seen other reviews know favorite things  Buttery garlic bread  hot marinara  If don't you're missing out  ate 10 them  worth pain   The pizza Merh  good but think lot sauce vs toppings cheese  good even amount  boyfriend loves pizza but favorite   The wings very tasty offer more just buffalo sauce! They're super meaty wings but they're good    The pricing pretty decent  serve VERY large pizzas if you'd prefer prices them very reasonable  last time ordered 12 wings garlic bites 1 14 pizza 2 toppings 1 18 pizza 1 topping  think paid $65? Which shit ton food    Overall pretty good place order  offer online ordering your convenience again they're open much later other places deliver which always nice when run food parties  <EOR> So biggest beef place ingredients terrible pizza soggy    really soggy  wraps super loose don't expect melted cheese your nachos something cheese flavored maybe but gross  Don't wrong people super nice guess appeals some people some reason but chef I'd never eat again  <EOR> Neighborhood pizza spot  Love serve late night food  food decent bf thought pretty good though  Wouldn't way but work late night pizza craving <EOR> Up until last month would rated them 5 stars   ordering them years   But last month flavor gone down considerably   Don't know if care but consumer I'd want know this   looking new place order from   understand once while things aren't should but twice row means something changed don't change  <EOR> Angelina's should definitely win award awesome calzones strombolis  Now pizzas   let's just say decent once dunk housemade Ranch dressing  garlic knots superb! Very glad 30 pieces come order you'll finish them all    Lastly place pretty popular to go orders take 60 minutes  Just heads if your starving when place order  <EOR> Fantastic place can't wait come back   food fast yummy would recommend all friends family <EOR> The pizzas very no well cooked am sure if change owners managers but ever order delivery told going 3 hour girl phone keep putting hold    phone 30min trying order <EOR> The service fast food plenty but music loud  Also don't know away smoking bar right next table no divider  <EOR> Nice neighborhood pizzeria when munchies   impressed pizza wings antipasto variety menu including Italian dinners   Delivery good well service   Right next Putters if need beer   Hours long prices right  <EOR> I ordered speality pizza 8pm night only live block take out  arrived 5 minutes said would done  greeted employee told would pay another employee working register she would food  then sat 10 min without any word employee just same lady come ask if helped yet!??
