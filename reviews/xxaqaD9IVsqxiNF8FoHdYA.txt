If wanted avocado would ordered avocado  She acted she doing favor giving avocado  Just because ordering veggie sandwich doesn't mean want avocado it  Also correct thing when only forget half someone's order but also wrong apologize snotty  Clearly girl needs more training   When delivery person returned order correct sandwiches delicious  Thank Jamie making right being nice patient me! <EOR> Love some port subs   Love family running particular!
