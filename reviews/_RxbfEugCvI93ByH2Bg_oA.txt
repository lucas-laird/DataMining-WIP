Pad Prik King extremely flavorful pungent dish contains green beans meat fish sauce basil red curry paste kaffir lime leaves  sauce always bright orange color  NONE things meal served me    not even green beans! asked server sure indeed Pad Prik King she said was  But front plate mixed vegetables greyish colored rubbery mystery meat served flavorless brown gravy   like kind would buy jar put mashed potatoes   filled huge chunks aforementioned rough chopped raw garlic  No fish sauce no kaffir lime leaves no fresh basil    nothing but meat veggies brown garlicky paste   And mine served lukewarm   Ugh!!! <EOR> We came twice dinner during weeklong trip Vegas over Thanksgiving   Both times only table   Kind weird first but realize undivided attention Tippy waitress food fresh well made big deal you're only ones restaurant   This place recently opened Sept still new locals   local but found them through restaurant com   Used certificate first night but second night 15% discount   First thai tea $3 95 but $2 95   Still expensive but really concentrated big glass actually mix w water least 2 glasses it   ours sweet able share w 3 ppl    Here's list some favorites Pho the first can't remember name but delicious  Fried Snapper Basil sauce fish fresh Panang curry beef Fried Banana Mango Ice Cream YUM place situated across Mercedes Benz car lot Sahara   isn't most ideal location hope more advertising more patrons   wish them best definitely return near future when Vegas again  <EOR> Yum! glad decent Pho restaurant isn't Spring Mountain!

Well menu large but food seems little sweet Thai tastes   would explore some other menu items though  <EOR> Thank all support but no longer location  current location 8470 W Desert Inn Rd Suite H 3 lilly's Thai Vietnamese Cafe  Hope see there <EOR> Went family last night food good service very friendly accommodating   ordered Pad Thai noodles little over cooked mushy Yellow Curry good order spicy!

Restaurant Com certificate more savings If order Calamari don't let sit more 5 minutes Lunch specials! <EOR> The service Lilly's really good   Tippy waitress she really does try best   However food just a ok   Nothing special worth remembering place   many Thai restaurants Vegas Lilly's would probably rank lowest terms good food is   Pin Kaow Archis Komol far superior long shot     The panang so so pad see ew ok best   didn't ask level heat preferred any dishes which strange thai restaurant   ordered Lilly's appetizer sampler $14 95 3 pieces calamari teeny tiny pieces two whole egg rolls cut half two pieces fried shrimp 3 little dumplings size quarter     The amount food quality food compared you're spending worth it  <EOR> Had try once but won't back again!  Stopped Friday afternoon quick lunch midday   another table seated before several other patrons came us   Our orders simple Iced Tea Soda Tom Ka Soup both chicken broccoli both luncheon menu The soda canned not end world but great indication wont free refills iced tea good   We promptly served spring rolls also quite good hot fresh    The soup came piping hot quite tasty   certain 'funk' mushrooms couldn't pinpoint but good nonetheless   Then came entree   very simply chicken broccoli which quick glance around appeared ordered multiple people      I could smell odor raw fish steaming dish   took couple bites completely overthrown  stench overpowering taste fish my guess fish sauce    The wait staff didn't speak enough English try send back negotiate another dish   didn't eat any settled check leave disgusted smell taste     Sadly wont returning establishment  <EOR> This restaurant kinda hidden  only knew through Groupon  Lighting bit dark there's no lights back restroom! Also sure if its normally way but AC probably broken  felt eating sauna  only guy working he sat down didn't come back until 15 20 minutes later take order    We ordered Vietnamese eggrolls which pretty good  However Thai dishes horrible  ordered Phad Thai no taste well Garlic Chicken Yellow Curry  would probably give restaurant another try Vietnamese dishes  <EOR> We just last night   first little nervous because literally only people restaurant but waitress really friendly   menu pretty ambitious  they Thai Vietnamese Chinese   Restaurant com coupon spend least $35   Because Chinese Vietnamese bit cheaper ended getting Thai dishes along appetizer dessert two Thai iced teas   prices fair portions big   only thing seemed little off price Thai teas which $3 95 each!   definitely high drinks weren't big anything    But everything else really good   return! <EOR> I lunch ordered calamari salad tea   calamari really good   salad veggies tasted fresh   really liked nuts gave nice crunchy mix   dressing very good but thought little much salad     left bit aftertaste    did fact could hear kitchen making salad hearing everything being chopped mixed fresh homemade     For some reason didn't care tea   Perhaps wasn't hot enough   service thought OK great but bad either    Functional but lacking warm friendly factor think important types places     Also think physical presentation factor place could improved   looks hit or miss outside if weren't good yelp reviews doubt would given shot   Inside think probably small things help increase atmosphere factor   Right now lacks something   That said think place potential   little more attention detail 4 5 star potential  <EOR> The food delicious   wish could remember name dish my husband ordered while business call but whatever delicious   tasted very close Massaman Curry though know not   Also husband's pho delicious   Very herby aromatic  flat all most pho had     The waiter seemed very invested food think he may owner manager   He asked he could improve dishes even though already delicious   told would try something *better* before could critique it   He very friendly very attentive wonderful experience   definitely back  <EOR> We stopped try restaurant driving several times reading some Yelp reviews   also Groupon wanted use   We ordered Chinese style egg rolls   quite good served very hot such let them sit quite awhile prevent mouth burn   For main courses wife ordered garlic stir fry chicken   just way she likes lots garlic good amount chicken some vegetables   ordered soft shell crab garlic curry sauce   didn't ask spiciness level didn't specify one   mild curry but very good   crab top asparagus some yellow squash zucchini   presentation both dishes very good   For dessert tried custard Thai style   more piece bread pudding   very flavorful quite enjoyable   wife some green tea ice cream   We enjoyed meal lot!  place small  the sign says Maximum Occupancy 49   server very efficient   small language barrier but overcame numbers pointing   After meal he asked two things  food?
