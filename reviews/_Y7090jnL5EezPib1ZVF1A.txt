I've going Cowboy Western themed Roadrunner Saloon 5 years  those places seem visit streaks then stay away awhile  location famous least observation very high employee turnover  When see then know its actually management problem  fact issues send away usually some new management idea change opinion sucks  thing keeps coming back despite frustrations enjoy most food    So stopped lunch today around 2 30pm  guessing ever current manager might reading some reviews Yelp  Over years service varied greatly location  However day service great  greeted friendly hostess took table then waiter  contrast some past experiences  sat table past then hostess took off back station without ever informing server party seated  tend pick off hours when things slow informing server issue  glad she took time because actually somewhat hurry today  server promptly came over took drink orders  He quickly came back drinks then took lunch order  ordered Texas Dip which made sliced top sirlion jack cheese creamy horseradish sauce served side Au Jus french fries  sandwich delicious! Au Jus usually comes very salty however version wasn't salty did dip sandwich into au jus few times  fries terrible  2 3 then left rest  some kind terrible fancy cut frozen fries  If management does read then please take drive over Whiskey Dick's order french fries   french fries suppose made  Homemade fresh delicious! I'd gladly pay little more great fries     Just little warning if late night dinner  happened 2 years ago  sure if still rule here  won't going back late dinners find either  However past sent servers home early no matter many customers may seated tables  gone many times late night beers food  change little surprising frustrating  those changes sent away awhile  night around 11 00pm some beers grab some food table bar section  10 minutes manager getting off duty stopped let know just sent home last server would bar order food  really? Why would that? lot people sitting tables  counted over 25 customers sitting tables moment  asked manager why? Can't money many customers sitting your tables? Heck know bill typically runs $50 60 alone  did seem care place busy  told manager would rather take business night another establishment focused keeping customers happy rather saving $20 30 employee costs  Heck if managing place would stayed myself served all tables until slowed down  <EOR> I'd give negative star but would still good review dump  Said could accommodate party 9  Gathered whole family into two cars including 93 year old Grandma 10 7 year old drove all way rudely stated couldn't seat us  smelled dead rodents anyway  worked lot restaurants stink dead rodents never good sign obv   staff LITERALLY cursed why renovating?

Drink prices right average $20 bill your head spinning pretty well  bar staff great very little turn over   My only knock Roadrunner food    thus far   Recently Dr  Pepper Taco's   Now    sounds amazing but culinary standpoint beast pull off   am quite sure expecting but certainly did it   When plate came presentation much more fajita style dish taco   fact tried numerous times taco ingredients failed   meat very sweet I know Dr  Pepper but even bit strong glaze slightly tough   little no cheese provided am firm believer when all else fails drown cheese    rest plate drown beans rice   issue but expected taco plate   price bit steep well right around $14   If rating off food alone would compelled give them 2 stars but atmosphere definitely helps case   Not accuse all food failing meet expectations also hamburger Roadrunner   While certainly surpassed Dr  Pepper Taco's reason come back     The only other tip would avoid place around 10pm Wednesday nights   kickball league comes while all really cool turns into 3 ring circus very long wait times  <EOR> The decor caught eye right when cute old west theme  Everyone friendly greeted walked Hi right bartender later found Collete  She funny friendly but some people look people mad  decided sit booth lower level could watch sports let add GIGANTIC screens behind bar enough every Saturday Sunday football  must give mention food am Chef reason ventured there  Comfort food large portions GOOD!! did anything off happy hour football special menus but looked them since know back see love place! <EOR> I always forget cute country ish looks inside RR   They mini bowling alley pool table darts couple other fun games   even seen people play beer pong there  little stage performances karaoke  love semi covered patio area   lots comfy seats fire pit its own bar lots pretty twinkling lights   other bars also separate dining room away all action but prefer sit many booths main bar   server friendly food good   We tried the Vaquero Steak Salad_ thought just OK   don't ice berg lettuce next time would probably ask Romaine   steak slices impressive olives overpowering   If you're watching eat ask salad without fried onions won't pick them out   Blackened Salmon Filet _ delicious! nice sized filet tasted fresh deliciously grilled veggies   YUMMM Sliders Wings _ previous visit tried sliders wings   both tasty came some nice crinkle cut fries     My BF put $10 machine left $50   other friends came 1K machines definitely somewhat loose HOT TIP Happy Hour everyday 3 6!!! Half priced apps $2 Jose Cuervo shots Runnerritas $3 Dos Equis $4 Heineken Rolling Rock ]]] <EOR> The few times came place taken care very well  staff takes your order refilled drinks checked back few times brought bill appropriate time  food always hot never look waitress because always needed when needed it  <EOR> Review $5 95 lunch special  I always see place exiting Flamingo off 215 banner advertising $5 95 lunch everyday also caught eye   friend decided check place because hey doesn't love lunch special?  The lunch specials include pulled pork sandwich grilled chicken sandwich BBQ chicken pizza burger chicken salad   Our waiter seated gave menus ask special lunch menu   He takes few minutes bring over friend decided share pizza pulled pork sandwich   waiter super slow throughout whole dining experience here   Slow enough point your friend look each other Hey while since ordered  Wow slow! food 20 minutes really worth wait? BBQ chicken pizza 6  inches   4 small slices tasty but small pizza   pulled pork sandwich least came side wavy fries   Both meals okay nothing rave nothing special    Honestly don't order pizza your lunch sad kid's meal   if even that   If going lunch   I guess pulled pork sandwich would okay   sandwiches probably least come fries    I honesly don't think would come again own will   Roadrunner remembered your slow service! <EOR> New rule any establishment nice patio automatically gets 3 stars because can't really mess beer if sit outside enjoy frosty bev noteworthy Vegas  Apparently bars want inside giant dark boxes feeding video poker machines kudos those actually let escape into sunshine fresh air    Road Runner does just well  patio quality open fires lots space swing  Yes swing  only bad thing isn't really view but given location may bonus because only real view would cars zooming down road   One other odd attraction couple mini bowling lanes behind bar  isn't cheap but novelty perhaps worth trying   As food stuck nachos ok  ingredients seemed fresh but prefer nachos cheese sauce least solid effort equal cheese distribution  shredded melted cheese which never quite delivers perfect cheesy nacho bite    My verdict Solid place cold beer patio 24 hours day  would definitely return  <EOR> Decent food  Cute atmosphere  Good service  <EOR> Pretty typical neighborhood bar Las Vegas  food okay  drink prices okay  Service little slow times plus ordered Nachos when delivered ran away without giving napkins plates forks  Nachos pulled pork decent but nothing special  decor full cowboy southwest themed works somehow  few pool tables other games available play your amusement  place busy weekend night but there's lots room cool patio away crowd  <EOR> It gets bit loud but its also bar expect  love Dr Pepper steak tacos! amazing everyone should  try them! Also french fries yummy  definietly back dinner again  boyfriend enjoyed restaurant well  <EOR> I'm actually really surprised place  seat yourself bar area all times taken awhile staff acknowledge but atmosphere it  Its really relaxed place whose decor just keeps your eyes wandering  cowhide upholstery some seating bar area  Haha  pretty funny definitely ironic  billiards video poker some video games even virtual bowling bar area  outside patio seems relaxing well seating around some bonfires wooden swings  Seems really great place spend some summer nights cold drink  appetizers macaroni cheese REALLY cheesy  Definitely something needs shared  tried steak which delicious  also add lobster tail $10  lobster tail little over cooked but overall pretty satisfied main course  desert definitely need try mini donuts which covered cinnamon sugar caramel dip  hear making new changes menu  Which definitely reason return place  <EOR> This roadrunner most others gone waaay downhill past year  used favorite bars hadn't gone while    We happy hour ad mail decided go   advertised happy hour $2 drafts applied only PBR NOT stated ad    ended getting pitcher $8  great deal Pabst   add insult injury beer also completely flat    The advertised happy hour premium drinks $4   were just domestic beers!  $4 pint bud light during happy hour really!?  We decided some food because happy hour apps listed half off   course only included half appetizers menu even though no restrictions stated ad   sliders chicken tenders   chicken tenders used amazing but obviously kind buy frozen bulk reheat   Ew   fries came them crinkle cut pale soggy inexcusable   sliders mediocre   paid $4 50 happy hour half off price just 3 them didn't even come fries   only imagine ripped off would felt if paid full price $9 each crappy appetizers   took server full hour remove empty glasses dirty plates table  I've dealt slow service before when busy sitting outside   When sitting inside 3 feet bar generally expect little more  Roadrunner used awesome service great bar food   never any issues paying full price before   Unfortunately since decided cut back service quality won't coming back   even half off  <EOR> Sometimes food good sometimes not   bacon burger can't remember name delicious but other items its mediocre   think depends cook   This place hardly crowded drinks always awesome   Where else mini bowling?  Love it!! <EOR> Went first time last night Friday night 10 dead! head thought would more Stoney's room dance fun upbeat music cool environment  atmosphere neat very country chic liked pool tables bowling back  However wasn't impressed bartender blonde girl black framed glasses   She seemed annoyed any time friends order drink  planned staying couple hours chill enjoy girls night but music depressing 30 min go  When played upbeat tunes having blast pool tables singing dancing but 20 min straight slow depressing want cry your car during rainstorm music  all started yawning night started drag on  point knew time go  bad music sucked because would stayed much longer invited more friends probably would ordered couple rounds shots  Oh well  <EOR> This place very unique  Very cozy bar 2 pool tables few game machines ping pong mini bowling alley which thought pretty awesome outside patio 3 fire pits swigs very nice  didn't eat but ordered few drinks bit pricey much loved atmosphere sure if regular spot us  <EOR> We see Broncos v  Patriots  two stars given food which delicious! fried pickles amazing  Sadly service slow so slow leave table bar another drink   bar charged different price drinks then server did! asked server manager  Although hour asked see manager  they never came table nor did server offer another drink  game even into over time sat empty cocktails  <EOR> The cowboy theme works RoadRunner  Great patio probably best only area lots space indoors  Gaming bar nice variety menu even faux bowling!
