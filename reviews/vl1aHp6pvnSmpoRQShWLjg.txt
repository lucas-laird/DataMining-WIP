However portions think but overpriced  come back dine in  Quick takeout service even busy house!! <EOR> I've dined both Lucille's locations multiple times Vegas because am fan beef ribs onion straws amazing biscuits apple butter spread  However must say prefer Henderson location over Red Rock Casino location due food preparation customer service management  staff Henderson location seem more attentive efficient experience   In any restaurant especially barbecue always consider time day when dining freshest batch succulent bbq ribs when made fresh  location hit miss beef ribs  am moo rather oink kinda gal sometimes tender juicy other visits some parts beef ribs edible friendly  However both St  Louis baby back ribs always tender flavorful  prefer flavor St  Louis ribs over baby back ribs!  What ribs Lucille's smokey palate compare other local favorite bbq places around town  offer lots southern style sides delicious! Lucille's 3 signature sauces tables which original sauce easily pick! also refreshing fruit flavored lemonade garnished fresh fruits! Some may think prices overpriced but portions decent some overwhelmingly huge which Lucille's great place sharing  family's favorite place BBQ  yourself favor call ahead online reservation especially weekends holidays  place super busy! <EOR> I Baby Backs over St  Louis  Food really good  expensive side 3 all ribs 1 appetizer 2 alcohol drinks 1 soft drink  tip over 160 00  <EOR> Came again tonight time just girls partay 2  Only 5 min wait arrived 5 15 pm didn't lawn table sat moved nice booth next outside window over looking water features kinda cool  know what's cool also? didn't bitch seem irritated that let anyway asked moved    This time server Amanda  She awesome  Kept peach teas filled  great demeanor  never left hanging  Always smiling  She great    Thumbs cousin! <EOR> Very good service food   Great server set tone meal    brisket sandwich very good wife's salad   Worth revisit nice casino  <EOR> Great waitress it  Very rude hostess  Food tasted came crock pot drenched mediocre sauce  Expected much more price  return  <EOR> Heard lot good reviews BBQ place  impressed food  service ok atmosphere good  first time Texas brisket  Which came room temp very dry! <EOR> First time location pretty big place came around lunch time   There some people busy waiter nice  ordered Jambalaya which some kick it   yummy <EOR> Both locations Lucille's pretty good book  favorites every time biscuits apple butter which give refills on peach lemonade served mason jars  could drink mason jar mason jar delicious nectar The desserts also equally good  love banana pudding wafers also served mason jar!

Third bar  mix drinks stronger  simple that  Everything ordered District delicious  Everything ordered strong tasted mildly flavored booze instead mixed drink where alcohol fades into overall flavor  some people may great but don't taste well quality alcohol having background otherwise delicious drink welcoming way good night started  <EOR> 11 23 16 Thanksgiving dinner  NOT fan thanksgiving dinner year  quality food same last year  turkey ham very fatty extremely chewy  sweet potatoes many fibers them every bite hair it  would mouthful fibers chunks having literally pull them your mouth bite bite  smooth all  Super gross feeling eating hair  stuffing very spicy  much kids couldn't even eat it  favorite part! mashed potatoes chewy bites bacon them something even gritty potatoes properly cleaned  chunky smooth texture expect mashed potatoes  am disappointed  don't think ordering next year     Thanksgiving dinner 2015  We pre ordered Thanksgiving dinner holiday family feast all fixins picked day prior Thanksgiving  came cold took only hour heat all oven  came 3lbs ham 3lbs turkey all fixins' $159  packed neatly huge box  food really good quality amazing! ham turkey flavored smoke comes extra sauce gravy top with  much food enough feed 8 10 people  service excellent  only complaint ham sweet sweet potato soufflé sweet potato pie house biscuits topped sugar apple butter sweet spread cranberry sauce lot sweetness would prefer regular butter rolls  Other then definitely order them again next year  Yummy!!! <EOR> Bland bland bland oh wait sauce sweet drowned smoky flavor! cook ribs can't taste anything but dang corn syrup  sides also good! <EOR> By far WORST service ever received any restaurant  only reason getting 2 stars food good  called ahead table 8  told 45 min wait  Fine show waited 15 minutes longer total 60 min seated next large group kids wall  ordered drinks tight wait staff couldn't even serve water us  While waiting beer appetizers We never received complimentary biscuits asked hostess if could moved another larger table seemed very put let know disruptive staff  change servers since new table 6 ft away  moving waiting 15 yes fifteen asked server if could please beer lemon asked water  also reminded biscuits  told coming  Another server brought appetizer sat table walked away  supposed eat off table? waited until someone came asked plates again asked beer lemon  brought salads messed too  time gave biscuits  excused myself asked speak manager  expressed concerns he apologized said he would stop table  finished dinner apologized server being apparently difficult  Before leaving asked biscuits should've received beginning meal go  manager NEVER came say anything family  many other instances poor service refills being offered additional plates kids no warm towels offered end meal on  Very disappointed particular restaurant but still reluctantly tipped server minimum 15% gratuity  won't back  Ever    guess since LV assume won't regular guests but dismay sister lives near Red Rock strongly suggested she never eat again  bad since regularly try support business's neighborhoods  <EOR> This location due manager response issues brought service past actually drop review 4 3   Aside some best baby back ribs town if order them dry   other bbq places town sauce over powers natural flavor ribs   baby back ribs little salty but really work well shoes string sweet potato fries garlic mayonnaise    Almost all food tried location great  <EOR> Love place  many occasions  usually pulled chicken sandwich which die for  wife love atmosphere kids love multiple flavors lemonade  wife usually gets beef brisket comes amazing sauce  great overall experience recommend place anyone looking BBQ Vegas  <EOR> We love place  The fried chicken actually some best ever jalapeno grits very addictive asked sample order side every time back    The ribs good great  The bbq chicken better good   The muffins serve super addictive also <EOR> My boyfriend gift card place Christmas decided try it  says no free food right?

Great time great food great drinks  winning combination ! <EOR> Came some friends must say food over priced    Now   the food good but nothing write home about  <EOR> The Skinny food okay but definitely special all pretty generic actually 3 service generally good lunch 3 value kind pricey quality unless discount 2 5 starred review    I introduced Lucille's BBQ hubs  first time location Henderson which pretty delish  However over time quality food definitely degraded point didn't anymore   Enter Summerlin branch Red Rock Casino  local Red Rock periodically sends coupons entice come visit them  couldn't resist BOGO lunch entree coupon twice check out   The biscuits taste little bit Bisquick biscuits  But when served hot guilty pleasure all same   I would say lunch entrees BBQ lunch platter $17ish   Just note portions very generous price  general BBQ meats tasted kind generic enough smoke meat  Hence all multiple bottles bbq sauce table  cover relatively bland flavor meat  best thing tried sausage links   The sides tried potato salad peanut slaw BBQ baked beans  BBQ baked beans probably best side there  peanut slaw potato salad both very uninteresting could probably without them  All portions rather small considering price   I tried BBQ chicken salad entree $10 totally worth it  Basically consisted small side salad hunks cheddar few onion straws less 10 pieces chicken approximately size half chicken thigh   WTF! tasted okay but seriously could provided more reasonable portion  Even Weight Watcher's probably would given more probably minus cheese onion straws    but counting? The BBQ pulled pork sandwich $10 more reasonable size but again meat overall pretty bland lacked smoky flavor   If you're looking some good finger lickin' BBQ really place hit  food okay but if factor price portion ratio pretty expensive is  Unless BOGO lunch coupon Red Rock I'd probably skip joint 2 5 starred review   <EOR> Liked rib tips potato salad   everything else seems pretty basic   sides great   BBQ sauce good    carrot cake terrible even though bartender said really good   best thing shortcake which seasonal available another month   <EOR> Since moving Vegas whenever topic BBQ comes someone always mentions Lucille's   Despite being very close District location never made trip   Recently Red Rock Casino around lunch time thought time try some Lucille's   Since casual lunch didn't want spend forever dining room opted sit bar   Normally sit bar avoid waiting table but 1145am Saturday maybe 20 other diners other words empty   The bartender took order soon enough   She knowledgeable she pleasant she tried sell few things   She offered biscuits but manner suggested complimentary or apparently delicious seemed last long string sell   Our food eventually came decent   best BBQ ever had   wasn't best BBQ Vegas   good satisfying but  extent it   DC's mac cheese pitiful attempt mac cheese   stringy mushy flavorless   chicken sandwich ordered ranch dressing side also came healthy slathering ranch sandwich itself   The bartender checked once right taking first bite   Despite fact she never more ten feet she never checked again   fact only time she acknowledged again when laughing something TV she turned around asked what's funny? laughing me? odd question ask little off putting   always nicest person but dont laugh loud someone when he she within arm's reach   All told just mediocre experience Lucille's   food alright   service questionable especially since quite empty    may still give Henderson location try but keep moving past Red Rock version  <EOR> Well say Lucille's corporate point getting customers   previous review being pleased service received establishment sent complimentary card give them another chance  took them opportunity few days ago good friend difference   server phenomenal!  Very attentive courteous happy genuinely seemed good person   Promptly took orders let know specials going did everything smile   Thanks Christina coming back place again   food good always but service always taste better  <EOR> Baby back ribs cooked perfection  weren't slimy greasy just darn good  French fries thin crispy although did request them extra crispy   Service very good  Seated fast food came sooner expected   Sometimes little things instead those stupid little wet wipes foil packages brought full blown warm wash rag  great touch   And best all probably most reasonably priced full rack ribs ever eaten  <EOR> I am updating review previously wrote! manager reached apologizing experience host she appreciated honest review team improve  Taking time read review experience good food all about! Thank listening your customers!   Such good food!! If love BBQ place go  food amazing waitress super friendly great suggestions when torn entrees  If love pulled pork try pulled pork queso dip! haveeee biscuits apple butter! OMG!    The only reason giving 3 stars because host front  didn't catch name since he didn't name tag but he warm welcoming which whole point having host! asked where restrooms he completely ignored question began talking headset he wearing minute before saying did say? good way start meal but other then everything else great  <EOR> Ok lets start off positive friendly server  Now negatives 1  took precisely 1 hour 35 minutes food arrive! 2  When food did arrive freezing cold  3  food didn't taste good ordered barbecue chicken sandwich applewood smoked bacon which sounded appetizing menu yet when received sandwich chicken dry bacon similar texture cardboard far worse microwavable bacon frankly didn't even think bacon just some fake processed bacon flavored plastic  4  food didn't arrive all once normally does most restaurants came dish dish when person finished dish another arrived ironically being only yelper group dish came last  understand swamped due being christmas day all but flat unacceptable  However decent ribs  only reason gave place 2 stars because extremely nice server empathetic fact kitchen delayed food also because speaking manager lovely christmas dinner he offered comp meal  If ever come again ill sure arrive 2 hours earlier then when plan eating  <EOR> I big fan Lucille's GV stoked when heard location opened  decided Thanksgiving good day any check place some Thanksgiving dinner   even though lunch  take reservations both online via phone which great because ensure enough time eat then work afterwards    Lucille's Thanksgiving dinner meal consisted turkey honey ham of half each which gravy green bean casserole stuffing mashed potatoes cranberry sauce biscuits w apple butter small personal pumpkin pie  food delicious even leftovers because couldn't finish it  best part personal pie amazingly creamy served tons whipped cream   The staff nice work team instead customers only being able flag down assigned waiter waitress traditional restaurants  also loved TVs everywhere dining area able catch glipses Thanksgiving Day parade football game while there  Definitely back some more traditional BBQ grub! <EOR> I crazy barbecue but when crave NEED some Lucille's!!! just die baby back ribs potato salad!!! am really crazy much else menu but those two favorite!!! place location perfect because no longer drive all way Henderson <EOR> Said 30 minute wait  Waited 27 minutes   Meat great quality  Full juicy goodness   Ordered half rack ribs corn cob x2 mixed veggies more zucchini half chicken burnt ends rib tips corn mashed  Hubby take chicken home portions big  Worth $ quality   And resist hot towels? Waitress overcharged extra tea but quickly fixed  Hence 4 stars  <EOR> Just finished lunch here  Took 20 minutes + just apps came cold  send order back warmed received when done eating pointless  Also when being served salad waitress reached over grandfather sitting next instead walking three feet side table properly serve me  Um when ok? When unintentionally gave  weird look she super rude  Definitely last time well family friends  Hire intelligent people! <EOR> Great BBQ restaurant located inside Red Rock Casino  ordered Texas beef brisket macaroni cheese baked beans  While disappointed baked beans macaroni cheese probably best ever had  brisket excellent! <EOR> We feeling BBQ today decided try Lucille's  Although located Red Rock Casino stepping into restaurant transports Las Vegas into swanky Southern dive    Service nice but definitely slower side especially considering dinner rush wasn't busy yet  meal comes complimentary biscuits spiced butter  Biscuits topped sugary crust butter okay but didn't taste anything me  first place serves sweet bread starter rather savory one    The food tasty  Memphis style pulled pork sandwich which potato bun mustard slaw  Side sweet potato fries  meat tender though would preferred regular coleslaw instead mustard one  Boyfriend half chicken brisket rib tips  good well chicken being most flavorful three meats    Price wise expensive side probably because casino location  If bring your family easiest wallet but quality food portion sizes Lucille's decent dining option Red Rock  <EOR> Cheers Lucille's surprisingly good bbq service  brace yourselves tri tip burnt ends chicken corn cob Mac n cheese salad lemonade! Everything really good  sure if really good because free work event entire company but depending prices sure would enjoyed just much  cant comment fees each item costs but tell belly happy! <EOR> I love BBQ! love BBQ don't travel far for  want good BBQ! Luculle's deliverable some extent  really hit miss more service wise but sometimes food wise  majority dining done day here  come conclusion sitting long big booths beside bar cursed  But restaurant world mind know why usually crappy service here  bartender  bartenders section day bartender always sidework completed night bartender  tables forethought mind  But see looking corner eye she's thinking let finish last lemon let just finish prepping garnishes re filling mixers   but took long finish while quick speedy lunch always fails  often ask biscuits tell ready order which she probably already knows because said saw looking refills check box  soon check dropped she all smiles thank you's  Nope don't fall am happy educate people know better shall taken advantage of    The food good  portions small ridiculously big! Once BBQ chicken salad lunch served soup bowl  UGH! Half ended table having cut large lettuce pieces  $10 salad soup bowl  lunch prices items decent selection   On another visit think special BBQ chicken lettuce wraps  Could some more toppings lettuce  Thank you! But overall lacked flavor anyway didn't finish it  best things Fried Green Tomatoes Red Pepper Sauce! yummy!   Let say though dinner location once everything great night service food!   Their drinks probably second best thing   their GIANT quart sized drinks give sugar stroke if drinking pop but if iced teas good!

The Peanut Slaw good but sure Stingy amount served   The Tri Tip Pasilla Pepper Sandwich good flavor general   Meat tender juicy tasty  The slivers Pasilla Pepper Jack Cheese added flavor meat   However again stingy amount meat slivers Pasilla Peppers    They many Sandwich places pile most meat center when cut half appears adequate amount meat? But center pile very high move some meat center area edges where no meat existed    At first though sandwich going whole Pasilla Pepper stuffed Jack Cheese which would great but turned only slivers pepper very limited sparsely spaced amount   You'd think $14 49 would little more meat adequate amount peppers use somewhat larger slices bread?   The advertise thick grilled sourdough but would prefer regular thinner larger slices! They use thick sliced bread sandwich appear bigger but reality just Small Fat $14 49 sandwich!  I'll try ordering same sandwich District location determine if same not?

Even sweet potato fries very salty over cooked  can't remember called but husband ordered some kind meat combo said tasted fine  sure if just happened come day pulled pork pure crap?   The only highlight place sweet tea Totsie Roll Pops 2 stars that! finished eating flies flying around food  understand restaurant no control over since come whenever someone opens doors but still annoying  least weren't around while eating   Well gave Lucille's another chance but won't back! definitely better bbq places Vegas! sad chain gone downhill  <EOR> Stopped take advantage happy hour   seated booth given choice happy hour menu table but told could order happy hour because bar ?!?  asked moved bar ordered happy hour appetizers   Guys don't put menu table if can't order it   Once reseated bar area where could enjoy happy hour discount thoroughly enjoyed food drinks     Deducting star large happy hour special   Started off poorly but made BBQ  <EOR>
