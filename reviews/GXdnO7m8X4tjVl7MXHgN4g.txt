Might B 3 star but gotta balance all those crazy 4 stars!  OK good kinda pricey 10 15 more    There's gotta B better LV! Should try Barrio? If best LV Mexican cuban feel them! Help yelp! <EOR> I'm sure if place called Mamacita's Mamita's    sign outside says Mamita's yet could menu says Mamita's Mamacita's  No bid deal  really matters food service right!?!?!  When walked restaurant quickly transported back childhood when visited abuela's house  smelled house decorated just gaudily knick knacks other various decor  Right away could sense some authenticity   Food great! did take longer am used however believe Cuban food prepared properly inevitably take time  waitress happily substituted fries came meal platanos  When meal looked though given whole banana  Everything cooked properly seasoned well   The service good  waitress attentive enough  If needed she there  She pleasant  No complaints here   I definitely going back! <EOR> DO RECCOMEND!!  Chimichangas hard rock  Chips Salsa free   Service eh decor dreadful  Also DJ posted window? Why? sure guess want suffer through pit bull songs while complain crap tacos  Downtown some good spot them  <EOR> Funky place   nice break Vegas    Service slow but food great and huge portions   wife appeared only native English speakers place which speaks well its authenticity  <EOR> With stroke luck randomly strolled into place getting hungry walking Fremont street   couple shady looking characters wandering outside but where Vegas not?  My girl ordered shrimp cocktail papano fajita platter I think name    going order chimichanga dinner but lady told getting much food canceled chimi sure enough shrimp cocktail cuban fajita platter plenty two   Really really tasty   service wasn't great but food price more made it   We twice   second visit finally did chimichanga perfect   also tried old laundry Cuban soup ropa vieja which awesome fried platains which great     This place great down home feel  <EOR> Horrible service!!  If known shut down health dept  wouldn't come here  Waited 15 min waitress wasn't even busy   table next waited forever when asked more chips charged them  own refills  Stay away find another place eat!!  Didn't even want leave 1 star but there's no lower rating!! <EOR> I've few times since initial review food marginal   Guess avoid while   Bummer  <EOR> Horrible service horrible wait time   but admit food good site e if  worth waiting two hours your food husband ask drinks we sat 25 minutes before even took order  also saw several people walk allot more frustrated because wait time  <EOR> No  Just  No    The decor little loud taste same Selena dvd played three times while which old real fast  also best part town but hey happens    The food good give them that  ordered ropa vieja enjoyed would if they'd gotten order right  states quite clearly menu ropa vieja comes papas fritas french fries   plate came white steamed rice bowl beans  When asked waitress politely fries she told rudely meal did come fries  protested saying menu she told outright wrong walked away  no menus handy would showed her  Half reason ordered did because craving some french fries  don't think ever told flat WRONG restaurant before  only but ordered pitcher margaritas but she brought another over course meal which did drink order  margaritas awful  don't think used real tequila  No table finished glass  Then told being charged $24 pitcher when hadn't even touched other pitcher  Um  No    Not only but rather large party  understand difficult small restaurants  However when arrived only other table occupied  But people came starting receiving food before quarter people table received meals  Come on! don't serve new orders before you've gotten first table done!   Other people table wrong food too  father in law can't eat cheese he specifically requested NO CHEESE enchiladas beans  He received cheese both send back    The service AWFUL  waitress surly never available except when she brought plate food which once every ten minutes   absolutely recommend place especially if group people over four  bad cause food good  <EOR> Loved place  Food delicioso  Atmosphere caliente!

For those know least come more familiar years reviews wore know greatly dislike giving star reviews   opinion must some seriously egregious offense warrants one star review  typically something extends beyond food beyond service beyond ambience turn your back any establishment   friends Mamacita's aka Mamita's aka COME ANY REASON done just  definitely threatened take weekend's awesomeness rough into little bitch   The tenets good service very plain simple take care your customers   more important your people food   Apparently Mamacita's did memo   Once realize badly you've duped into hoping could someone's attention receive your food take look around restaurant   You'll notice same thing  anyone doesn't yet orders being intensely doted upon while anyone else being virtually ignored   We received chips drinks almost immediately put orders Cuban plates appetizers  margarita Bestie Coke opted plantains croquetas tequila chicken fried pork platters   Unfortunately did read Yelp reviews prior coming  just damned excited walking distance hotel  were   We food drinks it   I planned order another margarita but desire quickly faded once refills Coke water myself   I another table Tapatio bottle since done sitting around waiting check never came   Another Yelper said she requested garlic sauce side because dish dry?  never far   We plantains which think everyone gets anyway no croquetas   No chance ask them until end   There large party same time could see frustration mounting also along everyone else place    The thing food decent   Bestie liked tequila chicken sauce granted pork pieces dry still nicely cooked recovered bit salt hot sauce   Plantains slightly oily but still fried well drink half bad   black beans bit underseasoned but soft bread divine   But when simply ignore your patrons food or least most it only downhill there   kept looking back service stations just could figure where kept going!  Just don't bother coming here   know fact just down street going back toward Strip far better Mexican Cuban just general food serving establishments deserve your business more Mamita's does!
