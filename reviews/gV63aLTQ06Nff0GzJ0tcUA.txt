However first course came already disappointed  basically dish nicely sliced melons tomatoes  thought Did just pay 1 7 $125 dish did even cook? Unfortunately dressing served didn't bring anything more    As rest meal unremarkable  basically smaller portions classical dishes would see listed menu any typical fine dining establishment  menu made appear going take new twist classical dishes but wasn't case It your typical foie gras risotto lamb fish etc  sauces served did add anything either!  What really surprising many dishes overly salty! wasn't just quite few  don't remember which dishes particular because mentioned meal rather forgettable  Also fact noticed sorbet palate cleanser pre scooped refrozen only left more negative memories place   Service I know some people didn't service but personally amazing  well staffed above beyond expected  example any crumbs gently swept off each course  glasses constantly refilled water  Also when came restroom waiter already chair waiting tuck back into seat  surprised attentive service but no point did feel attentive eyes intruding privacy  A++++++ service!  Other notes The dishes came very fast! time checked downstairs when elevator again meal took 2 hours flat maybe even less!   felt barely time breather between dishes  times felt only time quick chat sip water but both before next dish arrived  would've appreciated more time relax talk reflect just ate etc   The view spectacular! gorgeous panoramic views see strip also see red rock canyons behind  bad rushed meal weren't able stay long enough see beautiful night lights illuminating strip  <EOR> Amazing view service  can't wait back tasting menu! <EOR> This place gets 4 stars because food view service all incredible however did 7 course menu dinner drinks approx $600 2   portions very small found ourselves very hungry later evening   wanting try place because heard its best Vegas however fell short expectations  <EOR> In Las Vegas?

We ordered Summer tasting menu early September '14  Fall Winter tasting menu January '15 another tasting menu May '15  consistency unmatched  Each course came near perfect timing  Dirty dishes stay table long seems staff members lurking darkness waiting put utensils down  won't over each course individually creative menu changes season could possibly quite different when go  But state certainty plating combination flavors view service entire experience memorable    If complain something let's face there's no 'perfect' place course called Etorki  recall dry cheese course just didn't work well palette tasting menu    Also unless did recent remodel but men's restroom looks belongs truck stop  small dark dingy old paper towel dispenser  very unlike whole Alize experience  But didn't use restroom  return indulge whole incredible dining experience provided incredible chef team Alize     Highly recommended!   Notes * Top Palms  Depending time year reserve table when sun sets  Strip view incredible sky changes color during sunset  * If ask nicely table facing Strip during reservation process might accommodate because just awesome!  * If you're driving Palms remember which garage parked at  Apparently 3 exits few drinks forgot where parked   * Weeknights tend bit less crowded * Excellent place any type special occasion  <EOR> Amazing view palate cleanser amuse bouche cleansed palate Gluten free rolls! foie gras amuse bouche creamy tangy   wanted more foie gras terrine perfect   Smooth rich apricots complemented perfectly Dover sole solid   Prepared traditionally large capers dash lemon provided perfect tang mild crusty fish cheese board decent although couple items just didn't i e  some kind congealed burnt bacon spicy sweet almonds Excellent service! <EOR> Excellent!
