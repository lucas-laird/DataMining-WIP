She then explained different menu items even though did questions    I ended getting Kalbi meal kalbi salad banchan rice side soup $19  Initially happy price but figured would still try anyway  pleasantly surprised portion sizes which made price tag meal  actuality price very competitive Korean restaurant business all extras included your meal    The soup good very flavorful  sides pretty standard bad  kalbi however     was    different  Now lot kalbi  favorite meal family  tried all Korean places number places town many  flavor pretty good but different texture all over meat marinaide wasn't pure liquid but maybe some spices flavors pureed puree cooked onto meat  Again flavor good but texture no go me  still able eat most but don't think would order again    All all really decent place just prefer others  If invited join friends family would likely but probably wouldn't initiate going dinner  did tell boy though he might better luck lunch menu time around    I also ordered hot corn tea porticha sp?   VERY mild barely any flavor  Basically hot water which know lot Koreans drink would nice little bit stronger    What did find very refreshing during visit while eating I think only other table time chef prepared new menu item I assume wasn't close enough hear whole conversation he explaining staff detail everyone trying new item  gives staff actual first hand knowledge describle meal terms preparation flavor  <EOR> I've Kitchen Gangnam 3 4 times first experience here    Every single time food consistently fresh absolutely DELICIOUS    The beauty courses available easy decision making   I brother order mushroom meat cream pasta which die for!  Every single time visit however business slow sure whether location but owner definitely knows he's doing decor attention detail    I love everything place! always recommend friends but we're always only ones which experience much more exciting    To all Korean food fans MUST TRY  <EOR> Awesome atmosphere awesome food service! wasn't busy all which worries maybe nice restaurant area?? but during holidays hope endure through slow season  prix fix courses impeccably presented just right amount portion each course  Bulgogi very tender pork dish sumptuous would pass spicy octopus next time though bit chewy slightly over seasoned    Wish more culturally authentic desserts sweet rice cake etc rather gelatos tiramisu but yummy anyway  Definitely spreading word getting friends try place! <EOR> First things first! GREAT customer service!  Awesome environment! Decor point! Lunch specials affordable! back sure! <EOR> I dropped lunch family place really good! Bibim Noodle  patty nice soft potato starch noodles soft sticky my first potato starch noodle experience   Korean miso spicy filled lot ingredients  brother bulgogi sweet savory  dessert Chocolate Truffle ice cream ball rolled truffle dust Mango Ripieno mango sorbet served mango skin really cool   definitely recommend place if want authentic great tasting Korean food! <EOR> I excited try place because LOVE Korean food having lived couple years  walked interior very nice modern Korean pop music playing mixed other pop songs  waitress friendly really looking forward great new restaurant tell friends about   However first sign trouble came when noticed charge $1 50 kimch'i  never ever ever seen Korean restaurant charge kimch'i  always comes meal even if cost built price always kimch'i your meal  Seeing made realize likely would no other side dishes every other Korean restaurant serves and weren't  The lunch menu very limited but reasonably priced  Bibim rice  worse food day but  hardly rave review  patty top which seared nicely but something tasted strange  would preferred traditional way  Also does come egg top order extra  meal wasn't terrible but rates bottom Bibimpap town elsewhere    So sum Atmosphere great  Service friendly albeit understaffed  Food substandard  likely won't return  <EOR> OMG avoid time being    No Hostess confusion Wazoo! soft opening no workers ever know doing?? Wow! Wow    ever reviewed place     reviewing? fact only there? Maybe u service but talk unprepared   crazy! tables but no knew doing floor mad house!  We checked Out!

This really fun experience would highly recommend place your largest group! <EOR> I haven't much exposure Korean food always wanted delve more into past Korean BBQ Bibimbap Jajangmyeon figured Kitchen Gangnam would good place try expose pallet other Korean dishes  would probably help if Korean friend though   I tried beauty menus dinner chef recommended it  lettuce wrap created yourself spread various leafy vegetables seaweed house made miso paste boiled pork belly radish rice  also came bowl Korean Miso soup  all very tasty always fan pork belly isn't really?   soup little spicy towards end I'm awful when comes spicy food though probably spicy normal people but tasteful bits squid tofu   The decor restaurant really beautiful  all very well thought executed really enjoy restaurants put effort into overall aesthetics whole business  pictures display actually pictures owner took himself when Korea  staff all very friendly attentive  <EOR> Sometimes drive around aimlessly looking food because don't know want eat   weird moods where anything nothing sounds good   But time lucky because place all Ssambap!  It empty when came restaurant fairly big   server nice gave 2 menus   I'd asked Barley Tea but Solomon Tea instead   menus bit confusing first   many courses choose well ala cart stuff   ended Spicy Chicken Dakgalbi Beauty Course order Bibim Noodles Japchae    under impression courses would sent intervals but instead they're all served together   Should known better Korean restaurant all  when saw all leafy stuff  when knew fav!    [I first introduced Ssambap Lettuce wrap usually involving meat rice earlier age   friend's mom would set whole table full different type Banchan lettuces portable grill middle cook while eat   Most time Korean Short Ribs Kalbi itself already tremendous amount flavor    why accompany rice Banchan side dishes pick at  Furthermore adding lettuces Ssamjang Korean Chili Paste + Fermented Soy Bean Paste + etc you're able enhance your dining experience combining everything into compact bite  almost aways ask side lettuce leaf every KBBQ thrilled know KG offers wide variations wraps]   My Beauty Course Spicy Ck $14 95 Salad [which all Ssam bap Red Lettuce Leaf Steamed Cabbage Pickled Kombu edible Kelp Pickled Daikons Baby Bok Choi Baby Butter Cabbage? Sesame Leaf Shiso aka Kaenip aka Perilla Red Cabbage Carrots Celeries]  w side Ssamjang red bean paste + soybean paste etc Korean Fermented Bean Soup Daenjang jjigae Bowl White Rice Banchan case Korean Bean Sprouts Kimchee some type eggplants Korean Style Spicy Chicken Dakgalbi The Dakgabli delicious   chicken some nice charred sauce spicy   good enough eat itself rice but whole boat lettuces didn't want waste   made use all time use them all full enough take home half order both Dakgalbi Japchae   Japchae burger pattie underseasoned 6 99 lunch menu ok    On next visit Korean Style Rib Barbecued Beef $19 Kalbi    ala cart item charge $2 99 side Ssam wrapped    Kalbi surprisingly pathetic   Korean establishment flavor quality far below standard  But because assortment Ssam able salvage meal   Pretty much every Korean restaurants lettuce wraps but KG offerings just another level!  If you're new Ssambap suggest start off basic   lettuce leaf dab your protein into Ssamjang add little bit rice  Next try adding slice Kimchee favorite pickled radish your Ssam   sure don't overstuff because you're supposed fold all into bite   Also don't limit yourself just wrapping  Pick your food between tongue always entertain   Build your wraps differently diffErent sides before know you'll getting full while having fun creating your own flavor bomb    *note*  consider courting if Ssambap someone else while eat   don't wash your hands see much back <EOR> We love Place!!!!!

Sizzling spicy beef patties tingled tongue usually I'd set uber spicy stuff aside but loved flavor seasoning way much let go  When rice tofu soup finally made table used them excuses finish patties  Yum    Wait though  Despite great food honestly can't quite put finger whole concept restaurant was  Decor food presentation traditional but Kpop playing background name restaurant altogether didn't exactly reflect kind vibe once inside  put simply some things did fit right but pretty sure  going fine tuned time by  understand still new probably still shaping up  Those who've given place give another chance  Everyone else come round! <EOR> The food service great   Belle nice making sure everything more satisfactory   really enjoyed new Korean restaurant can't wait back   already let several friends know way over there  <EOR> This place Korean food Outback Australian food   wanted write place perhaps more importantly not   First good  service fine food arrived quickly   Also interior quite nicely done     Ok bad   expecting authentic Korean food but  just place serves   example no Banchans small side dishes served virtually every Korean restaurant   Also rice wasn't typical Korean fare little flavor   Also serve barley tea kimchi wrong type cabbage   Unfortunately place more rough interpretation Korean food if owners Korea snapped few pictures ate few meals then decided open restaurant state side     Vegas needs more Korean restaurants but expense Korean food delicious  <EOR> Lunch don't bother unless want overpay   eat lot Korean food   Lunch beauty menu's spicy chicken horrible    First didn't order Mexican food full jalapeños   Super Mexican hot   Also only 5 small pieces chicken 1 2 inch less diameter   Nothing but onion bell pepper sauce      ton jalapeño         Poncha great   Service great   Atmosphere great   Very clean  <EOR> Very very good all eat sushi! head sushi chef Chris very conversational made such great rolls! eat lot sushi around Vegas price best  Recommended  <EOR> Went check place friend's recommendation  restaurant very large comfortable well designed  Nice visual effects TV projected opaque film sandwiched between glass panels  people side panel watch TV images  The staff SUPER friendly helpful  brought group 11 run entire restaurant  We pretty late around 10PM owner took photos even gave some free appetizers   Anyway food very good quite reasonably priced  something called Beauty Course 3 which includes some best spicy squid ever had  spicy enough hot but still flavorful enjoyable  Light sheen sweat forehead told good! warned though Korean handle spicy your mileage may vary   I liked lot definitely back  <EOR> Came Thursday night open when Yelp said was   Probably no longer business      now 10 12 pm  <EOR> Seeing place finally opened two co workers decided give shot  wife half Korean exposed plethora good Korean cuisine  co workers seeing full blooded Korean lady also knows good Korean food  other co worker just loves good food   I absolutely amazed transformation place taken Asian buffet formerly occupied space  put some time money thought into gorgeous interior  cup high quality chop sticks nice addition   We seated handed glossy lunch three course lunch menu  $11 95 your option salads sides which sitting table middle dining room some curious entrees choice style mandoo   Asking if could just main course without other items said could $7 75  all opted chicken fried rice which $7 75 extremely expensive didn't wait long food arrive   When first bowl arrived great looking bowl small ish portion hoped best  first bite was    absent  white rice more flavor chicken fried rice  OK let's try some chicken    stringy dry chewy equally bland  Even slices onion flavorless  request salt pepper hot sauce all Tabasco Chipotle give some semblance flavor dish   After simulating Snowpocalypse 2012 pepper over chicken fried rice finally something taste there  helped underwhelming disappointing dish but did price lack flavor gate   When asking  staff if dinner menu included flavor politely offered some feedback only open since Friday today Monday still working kinks dishes  would think well thought decor layout restaurant beautiful benches CNC cut partition art suspended projection tv systems would tasted current recipes like    If open another 6 months may give them another try now though other places near offer better food better price   Also $12 lunch 115 degree temps outside would kill them turn A C on? sweating almost much if outside sun   Oh when looked under chair when dropped some rice saw dead cockroach chilling back  <EOR> I stopped lunch today whim  lunch specials extremely reasonably prices enjoyed Bipim Rice very similar traditional bipimbop lot  Plus when asked meat left off subbed eggs instead instead making pay additional side     Overall very much enjoyed lunch experience look forward coming back dinner much more extensive menu yum ! <EOR>
