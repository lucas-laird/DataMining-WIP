Scraped bottom barrel didn't nearly order normally is asked manager he's just useless leave Not retuning greedy location! <EOR> I always Panda Express! pretty good can't lie  lines may long but trust fast  Most time food pretty fresh! going 2 years now still solid! <EOR> This Panda Express does care quality food  ordered couple times delivery  Recently last two experiences horrible used Uber eats past left detailed instructions supplying sauces silverware  Each time food wrong food old when call told fresh if come down?  horrible  never order here     Updated review 4 4 2018 So once again tried Panda same result except time left two things meal 1 wife's  clearly see can't even fill boxes label   but course want invite in? what? other people see care? lost valuable customers now refund money! <EOR> Very slow service take sweet time offer samples when people don't ask when long line people waiting order <EOR> I very pleased visit Panda Express! tried multiple locations some good experiences  Kung pow chicken best chain far  very spicy used quality chicken some other locations use pieces chicken very chewy   also tried sweet fire chicken  fresh very tasty well   Cream cheese Rangoon's crispy hot  definitely visit location again! <EOR> Ordered 2 plates 3 entrees each disappointed portion size attitude server  Usually staff very friendly but server very impatient rushed order  Very annoying! small amount chicken pan instead serving full amount she made sure give spoonful bite more other Panda restaurants would offered whole portion since wasn't much left   When came another entree server basically only scooped veggies  When mom asked she simply held plate air! She did offer reserve portion  When home put plate literally saw only piece chicken rest green beans! returning location  <EOR> I meeting family small lunch local park  running errands placed online order  ordered bigger plate Kung pao chicken Beijing beef broccoli beef  also ordered two side chicken egg rolls  When arrived restaurant online order pickup  10 minutes past pick time order wasn't completed  sides order  waited 10 minutes handed order left  When park began setting food  opened big box noticed only two kinds sides  chicken being beef  Th broccoli beef no where seen  checked through bag again nothing  love Panda Express why chose them over other fast foods  park lunch wasn't relaxing incident  am very disappointed establishment think twice before ordering again  <EOR> Panda GOAT bruh  Orange chicken always popping beijing beef % Grade authentic Chinese food  never China but watch lot Kung Fu films pretty high  standard Chinese food  Panda express kicks ass every way <EOR> I panda express vs other location simple reason staff actually talks all uptight when ask sample  I ate pacific shrimp it amazing  the portion good  my kids Angus steak loved it very tender   <EOR> Angela hopefully  correct the glasses ponytail always nice joyful when taking order  second time getting order she's still extremely sweet fast order  She always smile face very smart job too  another girl taking order well but she quite slow  But believe other new worker because other workers quick feet  Luckily Angela came nowhere quickly finished order amazing aura hers  <EOR> Can addicted Panda Express? Cause think may Panda abuse problem   or just convinced myself its good cause only way myself eat veggies! <EOR> I know Panda Express probably any healthier any other fast food restaurant  However when eating noodles rice just feels better choice french fries burgers  love orange chicken fact usually every time come  find highly satisfying although seem hungry quickly eat here  Still find myself coming back couple times week because food great  Everyone seems good mood must jobs  <EOR> Over 40 minutes until closing but doors locked employees standing around talking no acknowledging someone outside during OPEN business hours  Inexcusable! <EOR> This location right around corner house location panda more few years now  Always friendly staff offer samples right away  Sometimes if dish running low offer fresh coming instead old stuff  sitting awhile  Always good service  <EOR> The only reason someone read reviews place because service  food always consistent always look taste same So darn tasty   Now since obvious way    The service little off today  Please sure if order double anything actually give 2 servings  Just tip  If going order 2 more entrees please them only put your plate  them package your other entrees separately  <EOR> GREAT JOB AVIE AMANDA SONJA STAFF!!
