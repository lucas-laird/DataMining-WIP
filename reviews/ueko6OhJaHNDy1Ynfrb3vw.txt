Reasonably priced good food    definitely back!  Pictures follow    <EOR> We wanted snack before buffet later night stumbled upon here  [+] samples chicken tenders boy good choice part b c ended getting 20 pieces! [+] chicken tenders amazing actually tender!

Since dining exact establishment over past 2 years decided Chicken Now no longer deserves business    I watched prices inflate portions smaller management attitudes grow rapidly! employees look happy anymore quality food decreased friendly frequent visit card disappeared employee meals increased $5 $6 49 less plate  When management questioned why prices raised  He states    done homework  Well well lot other employees  other food court options give 50% off select dates without shrinking portions include certain percentages off other dates bonus items well value business    The taste food good Chicken Now but raising prices slashing quantity only mean thing      Someone needs some true homework!   I hope when visit Chicken Now think other restaurants surrounding pay for  Customer service also KEY! <EOR>
