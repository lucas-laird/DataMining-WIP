Chef SU kind cut baos half friend could share !!! Congrats Chef SU great baos !!! <EOR> steamed pork belly buns   they're amazing   only problem location kind drive dont nearly much i'd to   dream those darn buns   fantasize   drool   obsess   darnit now want some  <EOR> delicious! absolutely must when ever you're town  prepare your taste buds rocked! <EOR> After reading Clint's review next lunch trip rarely eat lunch during week anymore Great Bao   only mile office very convenient   Gotta admit far quirky locations restaurant   the food 3 bao combo includes soda chips though didn't chips duck pork belly beef   Shot shit owner he prepared meal   guy good attitude entertained food truck adventures but food ?  The duck very flavorful beef decent pork belly winner   only gripe don't much $10 gotta take star off that   still come back sure ! <EOR> I bought almost all flavor Great Bao   Pull Back pork Pork Belly Roast Duck   delicious but portion small opinion   Its awesome offer free chip when check in   didn't provide fifth star because food handler wearing glove while he preparing food  something should consider doing  <EOR> The Look Feel Restaurant This place located inside Touch Spa Salon just back   only thing really bothered smell chemicals salon   place few small tables chairs sit dine but last time checked only 3 tables two chairs each      The Service The service outstanding   owner place very friendly   food took while come but someone would let know every few minutes status order   most part order your food service yourself napkins straws condiments etc  whatever need cashier's counter     Ordering I bao special which means 3 small bao + drink $10 that includes tax     traditional ball like bao see regular chinese restaurants   more bao sandwiches  ordered Roast Duck delicious   Very tender   kind stuff chinese restaurants  Pork Belly Nice juicy full flavor  Beef least favorite beef dry cold   Each bao little bit scallion cilantro oyster hoisin sauce but could used some more sauce   order took 20 minutes come which long time considering weren't many orders made time    presentation really nice   bao came lined wooden shopping board  felt fancy eating it   even when food didn't seem piping hot anything   just warm some parts meat even cold   flavor definitely good though    At end meal still hungry   just great appetizer ready main course   Even girlfriend finished whole order bao special   almost never happens sure sign portions small   Usually finishing food look forward girlfriend saying babe can't finish this   finish me? But time never came   never came   serious note outstanding bao found any dim sum restaurant cheaper which strange considering place located nail salon you'd expect prices Great Bao tad cheaper since operating costs should lower    Conclusion I'd give place 3 5   bao delicious but anything extraordinary   price portion really put off   know 3 bao + drink $10 doesn't sound much money but honestly each bao could eaten 2 bites   left still hungry wondering if should more food elsewhere   probably would return unless lower prices $7 50 max bao special offer bigger portions   reasoning?  would pay any more $2 bao   drink should cost around $1 50  <EOR> For first ever Yelp review decided only place deserves honor Great Bao  believe best places eat Vegas hair salon? Well true  Located small space middle salon Tropicana Decatur Great Bao  Run very talented Sheridan Su doing some amazing things very tiny space  only small table two stools counter sit but no way let detour coming immediately  offer variety  bao which perfectly steamed white puffy bun filled meat vegetables  all bao favorites being pork belly tofu  also offer perfectly done Sesame Noodles which also missed  hard everything menu suggest going friend sharing  <EOR> We heard Great Bao Asian Cafe Las Vegas Weekly  husband totally trying new places hole walls  certainly feels hole wall  enter into salon where cafe center it  quite interesting    I wish smell acrylic nail salon strong  very strange smell delicious baos mixed acrylic hair dye    But food husband tried all baos! baos Great Bao delicious   actually think 2 3 each kind    individually! pork bao bit fatty husband's liking but thought still very good  favorite duck! crispy duck skin just fantastic  husband does duck but he really really liked duck    The service excellent  dined since didnt know could order phone pick up  owners nice gave duck consomme like duck broth while waited  baos very reasonably priced also  careful if late night eater  usually only open till 7pm    seen status FB say even 'sold day' few times   Thank baos!!

Excellent food!!! Thx Jenny Sheridan wonderful lunch experience! <EOR> Great Bao hole wall extraordinaire   located most unique location all small corner beauty salon   opinion Chef Sheridan takes approach much IN N OUT taking few items doing right   course restaurant names says all most popular items but he also serves other delicious sides   On bao's Have ever family dinner where peking duck served only 8 fluffy baos 10 people really couldn't indulge juicy meat light sweet bao?  Great Bao definitely many bao's want share   Hubbie tried duck beef pork belly   pork belly bao favorite juicy warm   duck bao next favorite   Chef little bit crispy skin tease want more   also overheard he gets bao's baked fresh local bakery no no pre packaged frozen   The other goods His sesame noodles light tangy   chicken rice give comfort food fuzzies   Conclusion Great Bao you've right  <EOR> Definitely lives all 4 5 star ratings!  I walked into salon greeted Jenny  Very friendly hospitable asking addressing every customer name  ordered trio $10 which includes drink  She even asked heard Great Bao course told rave reviews read Yelp  Very tasty  bun extremely soft I'm bread carb lover   Even though pork bao very tasty I'd say liked tofu mushroom best  know know should've ordered duck  thinking attempting semi healthy ordering?! Next time will   There no other customers while ate Jenny spoke food business  She very nice I'd say probably received better service 5 star restaurants recently visited  She explained ingredients thanked giving food try invited back  Being service industry most life you'd think sounds easy but you'd amazed many food industry employees days  She made first visit very enjoyable!  Highly recommend it  strange salon ordering food but won't regret it  some time great word mouth awesome baos hopefully won't long! <EOR> Another Great lunch Great Bao!  Each bao made perfectly just right amount meat accoutrements each bite deliciously balanced! <EOR> Love!

Love definitely back if rent car next time! <EOR> I tried yelp deal which comes 3 baos drink your choice bag chips $10   I tried duck chicken pork belly baos raspberry italian soda received bag sun chips   The duck chicken relatively similar delicious though preferred duck little more chicken since slightly more tender   In terms pork belly if salted mustard greens come most taiwanese dishes such minced pork rice then bao  Otherwise may fan  Since mustard greens aren't favorites wasn't overly excited bao   The raspberry italian soda great  if aren't sure drink order   Overall pretty impressed experience gourmet food drinks served here  If you're confused location hair salon same plaza 24 hour fitness  sure why hair salon right now but good food good food regardless location  <EOR> Next time ask friends hair salon hope don't think want haircut because taking them eat !   I know against every fiber your body actually believe place located inside salon    maybe just me  What? heck wants eat food inside salon?!   I !!   But only because food amazing service  despite some may think end forgetting salon   Like most others did three bao special comes drink  duck beef pork bao  while all good probably wouldn't pork again  just wasn't good duck beef one  Hell next time probably just going 10 duck one  far favorite    The only down side place unless more three baos probably leave still bit hungry  left wanting more but unfortunately did time wait another order    I hope eventually expand tiny space salon  food service good enough own space without having share people getting haircut probably judging those trying eat hair salon  <EOR> I am big fan new gourmet food trucks see everywhere   saw new farmer's market downtown Fridays   duck bao man delicious!  came soft little white roll kinda dim sum made duck meat kinda sweet sauce vegetables   would try pork belly bao chicken stick   waitress nice even said bye when left remembered   Very cool classy little food truck! <EOR> Great Bao closing brick motor location which til now wasn't keen going due its odd location inside Salon    I mean does actually work?
