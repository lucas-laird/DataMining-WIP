Was worth $2 99 each when throw away  Don't shake drinks here    The fast food may pinch but palabok wasn't even close should rather just skip it    This those places feel more brand name quality  prefer Red Ribbon much better if Seafood City  <EOR> it's just okay restaurant honest  tastes nothing home country but guess best do   ambiance 3 just okay but sometimes smells cleaning agent which turnoff  limited seating but thankfully long line   service 4 preparation pretty fast but bit slow when taking orders   food 3 halo halo pretty okay which grant place two stars  breakfast tocino bangus  pretty disappointing because tocino pretty tasteless  favorite  should really consider cooking buying fresh foods instead frozen foods   I say because tocino seafood city next door 100x better this! <EOR> ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh              use having real chow king Philippines  states Chow King Jollibee Red Ribbon all those filipino  food chains all taste different   If tongue tasted Chow King Back home Philippines expect taste same  menu  different well original chow king back home   sure if ingredients same but sure taste major difference  would rather eat regular chinese restaurant noodle house  But guess better then nothing   The only thing now TAHO filipino dessert delicacy  believe its made tofu its drowning sweet syrup  would suggest ordering sure!
