Yes <EOR> Pretty decent food very friendly service  The waitor seems overwhelmed though serving many tables  <EOR> The best Szechuan food west US! tried Szechuan food across including NYC SF LA FL TX NO D C  Seattle     This best other Flushing NY  <EOR> In Nutshell If tired eating Vegas buffets steaks burgers prime rib etc   and craving spicy Chinese food then Chengdu Taste place eat  Chengdu city located central southwestern mainlaind China  You've probably heard region's style food which called sichuan more commonly szechwan   If love HOT SPICY type food you  Usually poorer areas around world spices used when resources i e  protein scarce  Why?  When eat spicy foods want eat rice which cheap fills up  Anyway back food Chengdu f*cking GOOD!  Overall take look two dishes below when Vegas again stop authentic meal here! <EOR> i chengdunese endorse restaurant offering best most authentic sichuan cuisine entire Vegas area!! Very delightful customer service! <EOR> Szechuan food known being spicy but complexity sauces combinations peppers lends itself depth much better that  building heat all unpleasant actually  first time experience mouth numbing mala may bit uncomfortable though  without saying may hard best experience if bring friends don't enjoy spice heat   Their specialties toothpick lamb guess guess shrimp way go menu large most good but standout dishes noteworthy because can't found elsewhere town  pork and or fish green sauce rave reviews friends but haven't yet made way through much menu  <EOR> Taste traditional Chengdu taste  And service really bad!!! The waiter even shouted customers  worst Chinese restaurant ever  <EOR> Not meant American palettes   Very very authentic packed but just didn't suite me    Super super spicy hard eat  many bones chicken made much work through barely any meat shrimp super oily tasted funky  Barely picked rice vegetables  Apologized server didn't dish ordered couldn't eat it  But still charged both  If authentic tripe intestines most popular dish <EOR> It awesome!  Good food friendly service affordable food enough space parking except maybe comment probably management maybe hiring more staff? wait 10min  check boxes to take left overs   servers very nice but felt if more server? would way much better  Fyi  work 10min means lot   gotta run   !! Anyways Thank good food service!    Food Good Price Good Service Good Parking Good <EOR> This restaurant definitely authentic Sichuan food  I multiple times felt food quality degrading They always don't some popular things which listed menu which quite bummer Also food way more salty spice sometime fresh Since many different restaurant choices  Las Vegas am sure whether come back <EOR> It good definitely did disappoint    I didn't experience wait all either!  Overall food spicy everyone built be   I didn't try enough menu though take grain salt    The flavors very unique felt authentic   We sat along some chinese people actually area China said good gets America   They apparently visited 3 times 4 days Vegas!   The skewers most interesting thing although hesitant say best tasting thing     Overall don't scared  Try all!   P S  chinese numbing  peppercorns really strong think favorite part meal  <EOR> I today first time food good here  most tasty double cooked pork  liked most recipes ordered  Spices perfectly complimenting meat  good place eat  <EOR> The flavors overpowering fish fillet but peppercorns really numb your tongue  Service just average Chinese restaurant  <EOR> One best Szechuan food had  Loved loved mungbean noodle started  Must try wonton chili oil Szechuan pepper  deliver mouth numbing taste  meal good plan back again next day  Must visit whenever u come Vegas think several other location California! <EOR> I really place lot! tried 3 dishes all bomb! back soon try rest <EOR> Like local  If want some real Chinese food place should go  sure spicy food before go! <EOR> We waited hour 5 30 6 30 Friday night  service good seemed impatient people waiting outside  not sure if because Thanksgiving still work    I seen lot good comments place but foods just ok bit far high expectation  chicken ???? fresh sauce weird  Spicy shrimp fine but doesn't seem fresh neither  only thing vegetables  <EOR> This real deal   Expect restaurant filled Chinese people   alone but able share food two others sitting table allowing try several dishes all them fantastic!  tastes flavors only remember visit China   prices very reasonable   serve alcohol but bring your own  <EOR> Solid Sichuan food  but while enjoyed everything hurry come back   ordered * Mung bean chili appetizer thanks Yelp recommendation would normally never order this   Soft noodles topped nice sauce enhanced crunchy beans   4 5 5  * Shrimp crispy rice crust waitress recommended when waffling between crawfish dishes special shrimp   crispy rice crackers much tastier anticipated shrimp flavorful fresh   4 5 5  * Toothpick lamb cumin Wish bit more cumin   lamb tasty but could packed more punch   3 5 5  * Spicy boiling fish filet Good rendition nice spice   4 5  * Wonton chili sauce soft skin juicy wontons   liked slightly more chili wontons Mian which previous day since juicier   4 5 5  * Baby bok choy restaurant surprisingly doesn't much offer green leafy veggies   rendition nice counterpoint spicy dishes   4 5 5  While looks many dishes rated highly don't think would reorder any them if visited again since didn't fall love any them   But overall good choice if you're craving Sichuan Vegas  <EOR> My parents raving place ever since moved Vegas if you're looking some good Sichuan food place definitely hit spot!

The first two items must!  literally order able down 2 4 bowls rice Chinese comfort food  sauce secret trump card nearly divine deliciousness sadly vegetarian friendly  But does affect me  pork sliced thin cooked chef obviously perfected dishes  wonton good but version Red Chili Sauce superb!!! Major nom nom time soon servers dropped off two dishes!!!  The Toothpick Lamb Cumin decent but pale comparison #1 #89    The Boiled Fish Green Pepper Sauce ??? listed being spicy but nice flavor overwhelmingly spicy we asked them spicy great recommendation waiter   Overall place probably opened more few days Las Vegas already predict major success story  food good shut take money good   Servers busy number tables wait but did admirable job it   Menu price higher expected but superior execution dish easily justified   Plus whole time dine clear restaurant packed only super informed Asians mainly Chinese patrons major indicator superiorness    I highly recommend all come check them but preferably am sick dining two month am already seated table waiting food   So keep DL  Only share wonderful recommendation your dearest friend intend marry  Otherwise everyone hour wait just people visiting Alhambra Rosemead locations   So hush x4  <EOR> One best restaurants Chinatown  Authentic cuisine unusual flavors large portions  spicy side  <EOR> Love lamb toothpicks beef tofu  Definitely recommend choose it   The place used another restaurant making similar food but now under new management  new owner remodeled place looks lot cleaner  whole store brighter  food very good  peppercorn numbing  food isn't just spicy but many layers flavored  Everything very fresh    Will come again when Vegas  <EOR> Best Chinese food if spicy ! popular busy  Small restaurant  Sometimes wait 30 40 min during dinner hours  Great service! Food always fresh delicious very very spicy! <EOR> Good some dishes wonton hot oil tasty authentic  Bad some dishes mediocre horrible service owner dismissive when asked move another table the right door sun beaming right face    When asked multiple times he basically told shut suck up     If willing forego service decent customer service consumer food come here   Personally won't return rudeness  <EOR> I am officially big fan Chengdu Taste  eaten five six occasions last few months am always pleased experience    The restaurant small but take reservations which happy  very busy weekends if plan accordingly won't long wait table all    All dishes tried great slowly getting through entire menu  Slowly because end ordering few key dishes each visit musts  cumin lamb guess guess shrimp tan tan noodles Chongqing chicken garlic pork  Everything else great come varying degrees spice level forewarned  discovered new favorite dish ordering regularly well  stir fried intestines delicious great crunchiness adds interesting texture   I'm usually big fan super spicy food but flavors sometimes subtle spice more heat all taste bud attack fire    Definitely favorite restaurants town am regular point  <EOR> I love Chengdu Taste Alhambra excited finally try Las Vegas location  brought group 5 first party opening time 11am  indulged Couple's Sliced Beef Chili Sauce Cold Noodles Boiled Fish Green Pepper Sauce Boiled Beef Hot Sauce   Couple's Sliced Beef excellent  numbing sensation chili came through perfectly  love cold noodles didn't disappoint  two boiled items all agreed green pepper sauce much better hot sauce  soft tenderness fish excellent  authentic Chinese food Chengdu Taste solid option  <EOR>
