Tucked strip mall across Omelet House  <EOR> My first time place fellow coworkers sushi goal tonight  heard another coworker thought would try it   Please know don't seafood but love Japanese cuisine part Japanese myself decided along  personally actually craving some tempura Gyoza   When walk little place decor alone take would imagine small family owned place native Japan might resemble   It all eat sushi but mind mission favorites amazing surprise many other offerings which includes two items craving plus more!  The waitress wearing more hat she also cook while partner made sushi rolls   One thing liked restroom located back near kitchen when wash hands passed said feel part family going through kitchen! jokingly offered help dishes she laughed graciously   The meal came timely fashion  ordered Chicken Katsu Gyoza Vegetable Tempura   I impressed plating food  work art everything looked glamorously delicious but once started eating just wanted continue   The atmosphere calm quiet patrons already just intimately engaged own personal conversations group was     Because its laid back ambiance stayed longer expected checked out   I would definitely recommend place anyone looking quaint dining experience offers great selection Japanese food friendly atmosphere   Arigato Zai Mas <EOR> i love bento teriyaki chicken   oh ! lobster rolls pretty good     bad tiny location but well worth effort lunch time because fast service everytime <EOR> Stumbled upon Nozomi while looking pharmacy strip mall behind it   If blink you'll miss it    What gem!  wasn't crowded but decor feel if you're Japan   ordered shrimp tempura tonkatsu croquette dish udon shrimp tempura   Wow EVERYTHING delicious!  dressing salad I could just big bowl salad magical dressing! udon broth everything tasty   Even green tea ono!

Womp womp woooommmmp   I found lunch section menu excited because WHOLE ENTIRE POINT lunch menu draw customers during typically slow time day cheaper priced meals    I don't think place memo  Most decent lunch specials Beef Teriyaki Sushi Lunch $13 $14 bucks! real?

For $12 95 chicken beef teriyaki came tempura four piece CA roll   lunch came piece shrimp tempura three pieces veggies beef chicken rice pickled daikon side salad creamy dressing miso soup   beef chicken okay heavy teriyaki sauce   tempura just alright well   But CA roll pretty disappointing  never order but long time since actually seen kani sitting piece  Nowadays usually chop mix little looks tastes lot better  For $14 95 Big F two combo lunch chicken Katsu fried scallops   also came miso soup pickled daikon side salad rice sunomono   He remembered fried scallops before which why he ordered them again   He less impressed time around entire lunch   There only official waitress working maybe lunch crowd filled more time   But she running around lot wasn't until almost done did someone back come help clean dirty tables     Overall experience first time much better  food just wasn't par   definitely wouldn't eat again especially without coupon!   pretty average Japanese restaurant   CA roll excited try sushi   2 5 stars  <EOR> The prices cheap afraid wasn't gonna great but really good better lot places charge way more  back definitely recommend  <EOR> Had lunch client  server ayce minimal  Good food extremely slow service return     <EOR> I really WANTED place!

Despite yummy spice tuna roll teriyaki salmon skip place next time  <EOR> Very good service great food! stopped all eat lunch special very fulfilling!

Highly recommend eel lover spicy salmon roll soft shell crab! Friendly welcoming atmosphere reasonable price too! definitively come back if stop Vegas next time  <EOR> SLOWEST SUSHI PLACE EVER TO  Seriously    Granted came fairly large group 10+ ppl but restaurant only 2 other tables most ordered chicken teriyaki lunch combo   took long drinks order pay considered leaving multiple times during meal  top off person ordered sashimi salad food last! DISH did require any cooking!!! came 10 mins all bento boxes and each bento box came if cook back preparing each time    Food mediocre best great price   only reason gets 2 stars instead 1 star because walking distance UMC because food clean did sick    <EOR> If spent more time LV could see being 'lovable' neighborhood Japanese go to   Excellent overall selection menu   sushi good but better rolls main draw   If saucy creative tasty rolls you'll spread   non sushi items ordered fine well namely chicken katsu which daughter devoured  Soups salads nice well   surely return when LV  <EOR> Really good food!  Really quick friendly service!  waitress extremely nice helpful over phone inquiries attitude carried over into restaurant chef waitress always smile!  food great generous portions but also great quality!  Nigiri thin thick rice quality great appetizers good size everything fried oysters down mackerel nigiri delicious!  definitely spots side town! <EOR>
