But  all he sat together person he made several suggestions cake design  He convinced brown fondant gold trim full sheet instead half sheet he could fit all design elements nicely  agreed  even found sample cake Pinterest follow  When picked cake open drinks cooler uncovered unwrapped meaning any could touch sneeze it  Why?! cake white turquoise trim  happened brown gold? military retirement cake came looking practice cake baby shower instead because colors     There huge creases fondant corners folded over he failed attempt cover them frosting trim  Some parts cake glitter sheen others didn't  He left half cake blank all artwork only 3 4 corners convincing buy larger cake enough room fit everything  trim turquoise! Ugh! slapped crooked did look professionally done all    Now say cake itself moist chocolate tasted good  fondant way thick eat though bad customer service inexperienced baker poor workmanship still made cake awful  hated never kind experience many events hosted  back recommending work never give cafe food chance this!

This place won't tickle your fancy if you're looking full sit down restaurant experience but if you're more into cafe vibe don't want need really really great ingredients exceptional service do  <EOR> I've passed place several times since opened kept saying wanted come based off few pics yelpers posted but disappointed 2 items wanted order  all brisket baker come yet most pastries very limited  cashier nice cafe gave u feeling being lil cafe somewhere other Vegas which refreshing      all being said husband ordered sirloin burger which might add huge he enjoyed it! however ordered avocado burger which advertised w pretzel bun which wasn't  Now might seem very minute some but agreement u can't just serve burger sesame bun even acknowledge u changed bun all together       All all husband enjoyed meal wasn't food bad but need fix some inconsistencies  <EOR> Trying new place breakfast ordered 4 item omelette pancake could give try  omelette good size taste came nice country potatoes also  pancake light fluffy tasted great but such nice French style place served Country Crock fake spread   spring few more cents serve real butter  girl helped morning very friendly helpful   So come give place try <EOR> Wonderful customer service Nelly!!

Put cold plate? Maybe crepe wasn't heated through completely?  Perhaps because chilly day yearning something piping hot   Still I'd file under Minor Infraction food wasn't cold   delicious spite temperature    I LOVE café uses REAL plates flatware! might big deal some but me  When pay $11 meal don't want eat plastic fork  Major Cool Points Staff friendly albeit bit more chatty deemed necessary but young made concessions       Ordered few pastries nothing short SUBLIME!  Husband some heavenly apple creme filled pastry he let bite   ordered raspberry macaroon Just though measure good chef ability perfect egg judge good pastry chef ability perfect macaroon Let's just say if rated restaurant 2 bites macaroon would given 5 stars!  probably best eaten    So giving Honey Cakes 3 Star rating A OK but think good foundation build great customer base  definitely back try other foods menu  Hate rate person place thing just experience   If work few minor kinks think restaurant massive potential growth! <EOR> Good service! waiting little long bu other liked placed  <EOR> Really great place!
