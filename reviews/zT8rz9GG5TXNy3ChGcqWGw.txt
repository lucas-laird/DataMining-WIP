Why would manager dissuade people ordering?  Today order took hour half didn't drink stock Amanda says she's sorry but offers no solutions   live less 1 2 mile location but driver decided take other order first which least 20 minutes away even though mine way   Delivery time said 36 minutes max but called hour order hadn't left yet     Very disappointing location amazing!  Guess Pizza Hut getting business now on! <EOR> I sad read reviews Dominos  ordered them few times loved it! fact family big Papa Johns liked Dominos much started ordering too!  I order 3 21 pm today don't order till 4 13 pm  first problem  tip guy because its hard find house he found no problem   now regretting that  Only because pizza cold when received it  Then asked light cheese pretty much dough veggies barely any sauce probably enough cheese just keep veggies pizza  pizza thin could better pizza myself!

If dominoes teaching deal customers?? sure hope but decision return business pretty simple  <EOR> I ordered pizza hotel room  took hour there  After inform walk the Valet pizza because can't deliver room   That's fine but if  case why asking room number?
