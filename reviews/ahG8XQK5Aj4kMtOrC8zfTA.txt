widescreen rooms  <EOR> the name place says all   Terrible don't tell until check pay $100 deposit room  room okay but worth  wait  NEXT TIME JUST SLEEP CAR  <EOR> I've only buffet but pretty damn good cheap  If venture off strip looking some cheap eats check Terrible's buffet  <EOR> Great stay secure clean affordable  Easy access strip fraction price  staff very responsive personable  new favorite place stay  <EOR> I could write novel place  short if could control casino smoke smell pour decent drink would five stars  stayed room twice size mega hotel third price    Pros    Low price    Perfectly clean room checked UV light Large room    Convenient parking ten feet door Low priced buffet   Cons    Casino old school cigarette smell    Cannot buy decent drink any price  Suggestions     Buy very reasonably priced bottle booze gift shop your own drinks  <EOR> I looking affordable place stay St  Patrick's Day weekend came across Terrible's Hotel Casino hoping wouldn't 'terrible' place stay  Its location within mile proximity strip shabby someone doesn't mind staying off strip but far same time   As set foot door friend lungs overwhelmed heavy fumes cigarettes would smell lobby  think might need look into fixing ventilation system if still want keep families coming in  Then again local's casino rather visitor's luxurious stay  Compared most casinos strip rather small limited selections games enjoy  hardly people casinos which almost place seem ghost town relic past    The rooms however different story  someone isn't looking anything fancy other comfortable place sleep night might find place hidden gem  rooms compared casino downstairs more modern beds super comfortable  Given strong scent cigarettes casino coming room literally breath fresh air given floor non smoking    The buffet cafe bad  $10 steak prime rib great deal was  expecting USDA Prime cut price but taste buds happy worth even though prime rib came way saltier 2nd night cut first night's stay    Overall wouldn't mind staying again if other places booked over priced  room cafe gets satisfactory grade along price payed them  Terrible's true its name dire need remodeling new furnace keep place crumbling  If cigarette fumes weren't strong I'd probably give place another star  Most likely seeking other places room next visit Las Vegas  <EOR> Good place value    Flight overbooked decided inexpensive room near airport   $23  room skeptical   Room clean sheets clean bathroom clean   More or less quiet   cafe provided T Bone steak eggs hash browns soda $13  steak thick large but slightly tough overall very good price  staff nice helpful   WiFi free   Shuttle Airport also free runs every 15 minutes  Ignore complainers feel much more paid for  <EOR> Terrible's exactly its name suggests downtrodden hotel chain bottom Las Vegas resort barrel   name isn't some oxymoron gimmick visitors but named Terrible Herst corporation which operates gas stations Nevada Arizona California   truly stroke irony know Terrible's named someone's gas station company among most terrible city   The casino very slot heavy only handful blackjack tables 1 Roulette Craps 3 Car Poker table   heavy emphasis slots not surprise given Herbst Gaming largest slot operators state ideal location chain smoking senior citizens boozing sleeping chairs   Casino staff nice though seemed more cocktail waitresses personnel   some point gets downright depressing longer few hours   Because casino property itself smaller no fancy restaurants any signs nightlife here   They've little cafe diner Bougainvillea cheap buffet don't think could eat again even gun pointed head   The suites small standard rooms even smaller   non smoking room certainly converted smoking room odor completely stained into carpet   claustrophobic feeling coupled noise people creeking down hallway thin walls made very unpleasant stay   That's say place isn't deserving any stars   giving 1 generous 1 due cheapo prices place boasts   Getting comp'd hard thing accomplish but nearly paid more meals did actual room rate   If wallet nearly empty places be   Otherwise stay far away     downtown  <EOR> you definitely cannot g wrong $4 99 late night menu which consist steak eggs spaghetti meatballs chicken sandwich whatnot  service restaurant friendly quick  setting rather dated but didn't expect much eating 4 30am mile two off strip however casino floor     unless you're smoker don't mind stale air isn't place you  bad filtration system something but whole place wreaked smoke cigarettes  pit boss think ron name  older asian guy nicest people  no smiles  no joking around  just glares every statement joke made  even marty dealer agreed guy dick  i'd come back if starving across street but outside i'd rather chinatown ihop mcdonalds late night bite gamble matter  <EOR> its cheap casino if near strip don't want spend much gambling spot go!!!! lot table games all 5 dollar cocktail waitress extremely nice very attractive drinks cheap bingo  diner upstairs plus buffet both okay but its super cheap  <EOR> Who names hotel chain Terrible's ???  What trying say??  I don't know   Because place pretty damn un terrible   nothing fancy at least part in but very reasonably priced being pretty close everything   restaurant downstairs also reasonably priced great service pretty good food   great place stay if you're planning being bump log inside your hotel room during your Vegas trip   If planning most time need clean comfortable place sleep when finally around getting some shut eye good place you  <EOR> Wow say  truly hidden gem  only food dirt cheap breakfast buffet 4 95 its actually pretty good well  No fancy frills anything if you're looking cheap place eat hot shower bed sleep your spot  Its tucked down flamingo far walk main strip but money you're saving staying think worth it    Like mentioned really cheap buffet 24 hr coffeeshop  Perfect drunk munchies because once again its REALLY CHEAP  <EOR> W Terrible's Buffet cheap buffet  come every once while because cheap food bad  time though little disappointed  First didn't usual fried rice  Second wasn't many good meal items select time  Texas BBQ night  smoked BBQ brisket absolutely delightful very tender flavorful  turkey quite good dried out  sage stuffing also worth mentioning  But good food  rest dishes good  corn looked sitting while even though steam water butter solution looked quite dry  fried chicken overcooked deep fried fish  But can't complain less $6 00 person having few good dishes all need  wife tried banana cream pie quite enjoyed it  also non fat yogurt ice cream  nice way end meal  <EOR> Reasonable place located mile away strip!  Rooms bad either!  Wish waiter service better! <EOR> my grandma lived las vegas past 30 years she only likes going neighborhood establishments which ended place   place casino version dive bar   kind sketchy but good way   fact lot pretentious d bags walking around   buffet decent table games alright  <EOR> I haven't stayed just walked eat grave yard special's cafe but just say find hotel very cute? environment clean doesn't feel grimey unsafe here   slot machines fake trees growing above them cute!  Even outside looks cute   <EOR> If Terrible's meant theme location akin Medieval Times then would best hotel experience life   didn't notice theme figured tv would only flicker on off every channel nor did notice theme taking shower worst water pressure ever   know low flow shower heads supposed save water but when stay shower twice long actually water take off any soap kinda defeats purpose as bonus shower head came shoulders    began realize theme weekend when abruptly woken 9am Saturday morning 30 second long piercing alarm sounded building fire alarm emergency exit alarm   followed 10 15 second reprise just few minutes later   Anyone Vegas weekend knows sacred those few hours sleep rest your visit now fully awake free use above mentioned shower woo hoo!
