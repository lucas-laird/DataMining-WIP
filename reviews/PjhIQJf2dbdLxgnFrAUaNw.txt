I wanted Chinita badly but just couldn't it   live right around corner when saw signage going initially thought going Mexican Chinese concept similar Chino Bandito Phoenix which btw amazing if you're ever down area    Hmmm maybe should gone direction   I arrived 6 Friday night half way full restaurant three other groups waiting seated   plenty open tables but whatever reason waited 15 20 minutes before being seated   understand wanting overwhelm kitchen 6pm rush but seeing all open tables while waited definitely didn't help   The waiter very attentive overall provided very good service   Chips salsa brought table pretty quickly dove immediately Unfortunately salsa very bland tasted came jar La Victoria sounds right    asked something spicier waiter brought something even worse   dinner date opted fish tacos chimichanga traditional American Mexican course    fish tacos pretty good overall but couldn't past rice beans   terrible!  Again beans tasted came rice very bland   Mexican restaurant rice beans should your bread butter but here   chimichanga decent but could certainly find better Roberto's other similar places   top all off prices bit steep opinion   Fish tacos chimichanga without drinks just used $30 groupon  The only things saving restaurant server decor   Inside place very nicely decorated good feel it   bad food didn't live things   would probably try again future if menu revamped   Seeing just opened don't think late but until then staying away  <EOR> There party going night came all service focused them  took 30 minutes drinks another 20 food   45 minutes restaurant wasn't busy! also don't know use open table reservations! person working first 20 minutes here  impressed! <EOR> We very excited find Groupon new restaurant New us   seeing movie Village Square headed over  9 30  Sunday night Mother's Day  Seated waited  waited  waited  Finally small basket chips small bowl salsa brought  Waited  waited  waited  15 minutes initial  arrival waitress asked if would order drinks  busy least 85% empty  receiving drinks waitress asked if wanted order  stated Gluten Free if menu item interested gluten free  She no idea talking about   does story end? waiting return when said needed more time she busy talking friends come in laid Groupon printout down left  <EOR> Summerlin locals    restaurant single handedly created reason come Village Square instead returning Boca Park Tivoli Village week week  Don't fooled humble exterior place huge inside! bar manager Venny feel right home soon walk in    Bar A nice sized bar area dozen stools + casual table seating  Great Sangria good selection Draft beer some great happy hour prices $2 3 Beers $3 Wells $5 Sangria Mexican Bulldogs + $1 Food House made guacamole perfect fresh gets  I suggest grabbing 3 taco plate trying few kinds $13 Carne Asada tacos best ever had  The pulled chicken good but little overshadowed awesome Carnitas Carne Asada were  $2 Street Tacos during happy hour     enough said  Atmosphere Chinita's great balance class style while still retaining light atmosphere  place doubles great date spot place unwind long day  night live music Toto Zara which nice touch   This place no doubt become regular destination happy hour dinner seekers area  Locals need before HYPE sets in  derp <EOR> One world describes Chinita Mexican Bar Grill AMAZING   We first time last night  greeted seated moment walked in  even opened door us  pleasantly surprised upscale trendy decor  definitely your ordinarily Mexican Restaurant  started appetizer wonderful Avocado Bacon Chicken wraps  Nice portion amazing taste  3 4 servers fast friendly accommodating  main course Chimichanga    Sorry if misspelled pork soft outside flaky It best ever eaten  happened during Karaoke surprisingly everyone sang very well actually thought live entertainment  Then desert Apples Ice cream Dont remember name but remember taste  best desert every eaten   and only $6 50 To sum op evening meal entertainment kind dining experience back MORE  Thank Chanthy staff your kindness  <EOR> Went first time today lunch  enchilada shredded beef taco  great! accidentally brought cheese enchilada instead beef  waiter caught brought beef even though said fine cheese  Service prompt friendly attentive  can't wait back dinner now  <EOR> The most bland tasteless Mexican food ever Vegas let alone anywhere else  Cafe Rio Roberto's instead save money end regretting steep amount would've spent Chinita  Wife pork chimi if dogs could sit table they'd probably cock heads side think alpo? disgusting looking tasting  I hambergesa all tasted hamburger corn salsa no chorizo  mushy fries highlight plate   Food = worst mexican probably ever had Service = excellent staff very nice attentive star  Sorry drew such look shock oh shit react look staff when asked everything never compelled give opinion because very nice   As friendly neighbor gesture plead Robert Irvine visit place quick does fail  <EOR> The owner I think waited really nice  Unfortunately food great took way long come out   only other table restaurant no real excuse   The best item daughter's quesadilla which tasty but just cheese tortilla can't messed up  wife ordered chicken burrito she said bland didn't care sauce it  Mahi tacos which just ok  fish fried crisp but still felt mushy difficult explain  best item plate chipotle aioli   The $5 sangria tasty potent   I'm glad waited post review because wife upset stomachs entire night into morning   Chinita please improve speed quality your food prices charge  <EOR> Great service Sam  Food fantastic menu gave plenty choices  heading back soon  Thanks again Sam great service  <EOR> I've Chinita twice   reviews site necessarily inaccurate but impressed enough service wanted sign add own two cents   Until recently found difficult find good Mexican food Las Vegas   Chinita fills void   various tacos offers flavorful ingredients other dishes shrimp ceviche guacamole fresh haven't found anything wanting   service prompt friendly attentive   Numerous other restaurants town should take note   Even if don't Mexican food would worth going refreshing surprise excellent service   value proposition thought Chinita very reasonably priced received   The only issue see restaurant space being tucked away corner Village Square   restaurant does lot try overcome bright signage outdoor seating but seen anyone dining outside yet   restaurant's interior very nice more modern would expect   However because floor plan there's lot open space front before dining area   result venture good distance into restaurant before being flagged down hostess seated   seems small issue but having hostess present sends important message right someone walks into restaurant   Without creates impression chaos reigns dining experience disorganized which again case all great service even more surprising when effectively allowed seat ourselves    I'm going deny there's better Mexican food LA elsewhere country but pretty close   certainly good enough happy within reasonable driving distance   would consider using room back restaurant hold small event future  <EOR> We loved Mahi tacos!  This great spot lunch before dinner movie Village Square   service great Shanti owner delightful   I can't wait come back Taco Tuesday all eat tacos $10   <EOR> Meh  really excited try place out   The inside lot bigger expected decor lovely  service really good too!
