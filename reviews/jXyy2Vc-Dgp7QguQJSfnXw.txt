 don't know but become accustomed falafel Halal carts NYC another addiction mine Lazeez falafel simple does measure up   Otherwise definitely add restaurant your must try list  <EOR> My boyfriend visited location over weekend  inside quite nice decor minimalistic tasteful  ordered chicken gyro bf ordered tandoori chicken  food very good but service less exceptional  offered drinks upon arrival waiter just came over asked if ready order  He took order tablet which apparently instantaneous system because he seemed very annoyed when made change it  He came back rushing off cancel previous mistake finish taking rest order  asked garlic naan he scoffed request assuming because hadn't ordered curry dish anything which usually accompanies naan  Anyway he told remind naan when he came back food    boyfriend kind confused if he making point he would forget it? he brings food leaves   Moments realize naan wasn't coming anytime soon ask another waitress it  She very nice right away  waiter comes seemingly irritated says told guys remind me    2 3 other tables    some other stuff couldn't understand  Literally only people besides another couple walked long ago  complete awe  Also ice water almost completely melted when them   Needless say probably won't coming back  shame because food very good nice location     P s  receipt revealed wonderful staff member's name Faheem  Thanks your service Faheem maybe next time try little patience kindness?

Maybe indulge well  <EOR> The food okay but service excellent  food wasn't good just okay but would definitely recommend anyone try it  <EOR> I am vegan loves Middle Eastern food best places tried plenty vegan vegetarian options! Great food service  <EOR> Updating last review  once again   I craving Indian food   and decided give place second chance because close house  time inside instead take out  staff very nice food much better! Dine take out  think because if dine say something them  If take out really going drive back down say something? No  <EOR> Am visitor Las Vegas last few days and  trying all restaurants Lazeez best  Every item ordered good especially chicken wings  Interior place worth mention  <EOR> First time came today waitress Lola she friendly nice  food yummy yummy  recommend place 100%  back definitely  <EOR> I excited find Indian restaurant neighborhood  greeted sweet girl  wanted try Tandoori chicken opted ala cart instead meal  5 00 ordered side Baba Ganoush  She said would take 10 15 minutes  15 minutes order still ready  two people restaurant  other person asked order well she said ordered same thing takes little longer made order decided order chi tea wait out  40 minutes finally order  waste money  baba ganoush extremely bitter chunky  No spice all  piece maybe 2 bites edible  <EOR> I found love Indian food few months back while Lazeez's isn't polished some other Indian restaurants around town food far favorite  Everything little rough around edges but always try accommodate guests  use more self service restaurant which preferred thought worked better vibe but now full serviced servers  staff always polite accommodating  frequented place since discovered definitely returning  <EOR> The food service Lazeez wonderful!  dined ordered pleased quality dishes   place must try! <EOR> The place great food fantastic Lola best  Fast friendly made great recommendations! <EOR> I came lunch family  good vegan options  apps good  family very disappointed meat platter ordered  said quality wasn't good  chicken good  service wasn't good either  let waitress know before didn't but she didn't really say anything  don't complain paid  mom said something because clearly didn't eat it  gave them 5% off coupon next time  All all place mediocre better options Indian food  <EOR> Surprisingly upscale interior relatively traditional menu apps wraps plates even Halal desserts round menu featuring currys other Indian specialties weekends  also several vegetarian vegan options   Interior very nice fact walk counter kind odd and two them?   sure why layout chosen over offering table service  Pricing fair most items but some need come down $8 10 wrap without side little steep considering fast casual setup chose implement  But adjusted pricing some items doubling originally 2 piece falafel app 4 pieces same $5 price tag  But $10 wrap should side   Falafel good but falafel wrap dry highly suggest adding hummus babaghanouj moisture added flavor  Unfortunately drizzle tzatziki sauce doesn't quite cut it   Veggie samosa tasty sided red Lazeez's sauce surprisingly balanced combo fruit based sauce balances heat filling  But don't understand why 1 smallish veggie samosa $2 50 while order 4 chicken samosas $5   Tip management even if don't offer table service away red plastic baskets serving your meals they're cheap looking  Invest real dishes silverware  remove Bus your own tables! note above trash tacky  <EOR> I'm fond curry never much Indian food but saw banner outside restaurant thought lunch buffet would great way try was! great! Nice selection including Tandoori chicken chili chicken chicken curry which mild didn't mind curry chicken makhani aka butter chicken which fave! aloo saag which potatoes spinach okra vegetable samosas potato pea filling rice lettuce salad sauces tzatziki rice pudding dessert  bring huge serving plain garlic naan which delicious! started just spoonful each item try pretty much filled up  did back extra makhani sauce scoop naan which wasn't waste! second little bowl rice pudding w pistachio bits top which skeptical first but totally grew me! only thing missed hummus but probably mix menu different days  If headed home would ordered order later  bet good! Place nicely decorated clean service wonderful  myself didn't feel awkward anything  least other solo diner half customers looked Indian decent  probably good sign well  happy broadened tastes! <EOR> Brief Overview simple Mediterranean Indian restaurant provides good variety menu options reasonable price   Pros simple yet stylish decor interior The owner staff very friendly food good flavor love vegan vegetarian options nice private room hosting parties entertaining guests  Cons use styrofoam plastic utensils food  know cheaper them and maybe customers but would ceramic bowls silverwear used environmental impact home feel standpoint   Final Verdict Would recommend anyone looking nice environment good Indian Mediterranean food  countless times classes teach recommend them if fence  <EOR> Had lazeez chicken burger husband lazeez beef burger amazing!! juicy tasty!
