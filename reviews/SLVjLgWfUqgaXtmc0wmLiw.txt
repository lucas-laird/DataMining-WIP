Bartender Coors Light all tap right now   Me OK   Give large   How does biggest chain bars Clark County forget stock basic things domestic beer?  Does delivery person accidentally bypass specific location??  wouldn't blame them   open well over year yet still sport red white vinyl signage   could imagine corporate meeting regarding bar If becomes profitable should put white van parking lot say 'BAR' arrow pointing left increase exposure  Then there's food   Pizza 50% off during happy hour   ordering bartender on own free said pretty good unless you're snooty pizza east coast  Well gollygeekickmeinthenutswhiz could pumped now??  Upon first bite safe say pizza none I'd before   disgrace   When cook gets order barely edible disc recipe card probably says 1  cardboard  2  Add canned red sauce  pepperoni product  cheese product 3  No need heat 4  Serve  If weren't enough people smoke dying heart's content here   seen patrons leave bar halftime since goddamn smoky   sure why allowed   Marge Simpson's sisters would give place 5 stars  <EOR> Ok place watch football games  small crowd Patriots fans every game some times lively bunch  If close place watch them play  Bartenders always friendly attentive  very big crowd  <EOR> My husband location very unhappy experience  bartender myself don't understand woman doing she personal friends drugs  all around bad experience  much trying different locations still normal location staying local bar around corner <EOR>
