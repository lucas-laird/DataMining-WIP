Perhaps some best Las Vegas   Let's start bread basket   mixed variety carb loaded treats   Olive focaccia soft pretzel etc     We ordered Spicy Mambo Salad Ocean Club House Salad table   Both portions very generous each enough individual meal   Both delicious but own individual personalities   Spicy Mambo Salad no protein reminiscent caesar salad hints wasabi   Ocean Club House Salad bits lobster shrimp well balanced   also order side macaroni cheese table  side huge plenty table   fact some left over party seven   Again delicious   For entree 12 oz  filet   ordered medium rare normally do   cooked perfectly tender point could peel off pieces only fork   arguably best steak ever had   friend order sea bass unlike other fine dining restaurants to    portion huge   sea bass lightly seasoned crust super white color throughout   flaky yet melted your mouth   far best sea bass ever had    The reasons didn't give Mastro's five stars?  Three reasons   First waiter seemed little attitude when guests requested separate checks   second band playing night   sure if common nightly play   But I'd rather listen 70's 90's cover band while eat fine meal   Lastly couldn't overcome fact every time looked around    still retail shopping center   love views but shoppers walking Louis Vuitton Prada etc  <EOR> Comfy bar tables almost every entree excellent   The Filet perfect best pieces meat ever 5*+ but NY Strip average best  All sides excellent service great too  Overall great experience back sure  <EOR> My family celebrated Christmas Eve 2017 Mastro's Ocean Club staff welcoming happy attentive  food delicious!

He also jokingly asked if drunkie friend would also cup agua puuahaha <EOR> Wow huge disappointment!  always heard good things chain including location Vegas   high end very pricey steak joint expect a REALLY good steak b prompt efficient service   Ocean Club failed both counts during recent dinner   pressed time definitely would candid blunt discussion manager regarding disappointment   party 12 promptly seated two waiters handle large party    Failure #1 drink orders taken ladies those came quickly within 5 10 minutes didn't take drink orders guys another 5 10 minutes waited good 15 minutes before came out   messed two drink orders stuff shouldn't mistake   Failure #2 screwed steak orders ordered rib eye sitting right next knew he ordered apologized profusely said would expedite correct steak   10 minutes later guess comes out?  WRONG steak again!  Fortunately most guys larger steaks shared friend wouldn't left eating alone  Failure #3 ordered steak medium rare but came much closer medium well   high end steakhouse should never happen steaks should come consistent match customer ordered   The only positive note side dishes all very good   Other reviews consistent rave reviews sides   Given much spent dinner massive disappointment     8 31 Update posting review did personal call GM restaurant   He very apologetic believe he sincere soliciting feedback ensure risk happening other patrons minimized   gesture good faith he did offer gift card use any Mastro's location   honest call happened would never set foot restaurant chain again   But because gesture did Beverly Hills location AMAZING meal post separate review location   <EOR> Jean George's closed aria host recommended mastros  All perfect  way see everyone satisfied  Great customer service  Restaurant looks shell boat hokey 1st but grows you  Crystals 10 steps aria crystals  However 117 degree temp pacemaker made seem longer  Worth it  <EOR> Insane collection meat seafood  guess find stuff nibble but why?

Regardless kinks sad puppy because other yummy steak mixed connective tissue bits everything else just average compared other Mastro's experiences   Mastro's did rise occasion reputation   back?  love butter cake more time passed particular establishment   [side note If try particular Mastro's asked sit nice atrium mollusk looking wooden structure right outside it   think better service   seems if table sitting blind spot    servers liked walk over peer over railing next chat stores patrons below if weren't there ] <EOR> At first glace menu photos website yelp all seemed very appealing could choose come being exposed all that? able easily booked reservations Mastro's OC same day on Sunday through yelp open table   After sealing deal place somewhat high expectations experience food going like  Mastro's located second floor City Center surrounded endless amount high end stores Prada Gucci Jimmy Choo etc  etc  visual cues added high expectations  date comfortably seated along edge where able gaze into nicely holiday decorated city center well watch 90% people window shop   guess expensive right time year treat yourself classy brands?  Anyway down cool service location but food OK wasn't liking wasn't disliking either   My date ordered bone ribeye medium rare came table sizzling hot right temperature or thought until he down middle  warm but cold either   just weird temperature didn't seem right  least able replaced ASAP    I decided 2 lobster tails  I regularly prepared vanilla battered  should just  reguarly prepared because battered wasn't really anything special didn't even taste vanilla   or perhaps might hint taste buds unable pick on    And sides   geez expensive nothing extraordinary! felt could chosen potatoes mushrooms myself made garlic mashed potatoes sauteed mushrooms myself  Actually think could actually Mastro's items not saying some kind professional chef anything just emphasizing items nothing impressive     So 2 ice teas 2 entrees 2 sides bill came $160 without tip  can't say price food quality ratio appropriate though again service top notch  Oh artisan breads delicious well  also say appreciated follow call did next day never happen thought nice them do  guess might come back again but purchase something else might tickle fancy  <EOR> Went Ocean club dinner last nite Las Vegas had before loved it  Well time even better remembered!

I've interested visiting Maestro's Ocean Club quite some time  seafood lover lover fine dining right alley   Located Crystals layout interesting  simultaneously feeling being mall yet separated it  dome sorts ceiling shoppers cannot see inside gawk diners but diners somewhat see into mall  Tables smidge close comfort but  just personal preference   Service expected wonderful  server friendly personable knowledgeable professional without being overbearing  extensive cocktail list enjoyed cocktail Strawberry Dream which very sweet but sweet drinks   For appetizer split lobster cocktail which ended being more meat originally expected based presentation  Although server warned heat kick atomic horseradish actually quite bearable complimented lobster well   I opted crab cakes entree also quite good  Perhaps best crab cakes ever but certainly fine showing  perhaps could used bit more seasoning some horseradish but full meat little filler held things together well  side Gorgonzola Mac cheese wow!! Huge portion holy cheese batman! Super cheesy!! Really good very mild though    For dessert split butter cake melt your mouth good  Seriously  homemade whipped cream along ice cream may overkill but if you're going dessert might well all out!   Of course Maestro's expensive side things but if want solid seafood fine dining experience wouldn't shy away it  <EOR> Pretzel bread amazing  Must try seafood tower! Even lemons point freshness! food family style waiters come around serve food everyone table   Mac cheese delicious !!

I seated hostess   then waited   waited    waited   menus   making continuous eye contact wait staff displaying need service ignored   Then maybe 10 mins received menu but still ask water   Shocking supposed nicer restaurant   would think prices would come service   Also during dinner numerous times where looking empty champagne glass   no fast drinker    If going place bottle ice bucket stand other side table please mindful when fill glass    know may sound snobby but no problem pouring own glass   however believe should keep close eye especially since plenty staff just standing around   The mussels probably best had! nice surprise most steamed mussels quite standard white wine garlic parsley   But some sort light creamy sun dried tomato sauce! thin enough compliment under sea delights but hearty enough dip bread!  crab cake also divine!  Definitely no fillers here   instead cake shaped form literally pure crab!  Chilean sea bass prepared really great especially white fish!  Overall would definitely check place ESPECIALLY if food bev comp through MGM hotels   However still prefer Sage over place   service really stood HORRIBLE!

Visited January 2016 <EOR> My husband huge mastro's fans! dined frequently Beverly Hills location thought would perfect date night last trip Vegas experience Ocean Club  location restaurant crystals shopping center which little bit disappointment   dined tree house which beautiful but view people shopping mall did take away ambiance thus four stars  am sweet wine type girl moscato which smooth sweet    appetizer ordered scallops which cooked perfection tasted amazing  entree husband ordered chicken ordered bone in rib eye   Ocean club sea food version traditionally restaurant but offers many beef variations   Most appetizers seafood options but offer regular sides additional seafood options  mac n cheese garlic mashed potatoes great always  <EOR> I ate Michelin Star Restaurants very high end Steakhouses   Mastro's Ocean Club best!  ribeye plate hot could hear sizzling   assumed just plate   minute put piece steak mouth OMG heaven!  way all steak should come HOT cooked immediately bought your table   also two seafood plates too   also hot too! Most restaurant know part right  When multiple orders cook where all plates delivered Hot   drinks amazing   service absolutely best!  must place Vegas now on   Just hope consistent   Michelin 5 Star  <EOR> WOW all say   Mastros Steakhouse Chicago able always hoppin  since Vegas decided give Mastros Ocean Club try   disappointed   restaurant located City Center shopping area fits well high end shopping swanky décor city center surrounding hotels   décor simple contemporary   would simple if wasn't amazing bar set but more tree house structure   If visit Mastros request sit tree house section   also lounge singer piano player   volume fine as read other review extremely loud but sitting tree house area imagine if tables next singer booths behind them would pretty loud   Regardless singer very good sang songs all genres   Now important part food   Everything ordered amazing   all higher end restaurants all sides ala cart but big enough share   entrees delishous ahi tuna sea bass scallops   no complaints all cooked PERFECTLY extremely flavorful   portions quite large   sides equally amazing big enough share between 3 4 people   sides mac cheese AH  MAZ  ING   If we're ever back I'd happy dive into Lobster mashed potatoes   wedge salad enourmous enough share between 2 people   lobster bisque which very tasty   before other places sometimes fishy taste but this  big chunks lobster   Service supurb expected   menu pricey but worth it   definitely checking Mastros Chicago  <EOR> Fantastic service fantastic food cool venue   Portion sizes great wine list extensive cocktail list large  Nothing negative say Mastro's   reservation ask table overlooking balcony bird's nest     We tried little bit everything   begin bread fantastic   baguette pretzel rolls standouts but love restaurant begins assortment complimentary   tuna tartare heavy avocado but surprisingly each bite mixed well tuna   mambo caesar salad best salads kick wasabi flavoring dressing clear sinuses   For entrees table sea bass tartare lobster steak big eye tuna   also shared sauteed spinach crab gnocchi   Everything unique spice rub made sharing ideal   lobster some thickest freshest had   tuna very good Asian flare black sesame seed rub but dish also presented appetizer if want half portion   sea bass fantastic fish but little bland all   Steak just well prepared steak nothing more nothing less   spinach fine green but gnocchi chunks crab nice accompaniment fish its creaminess nice dipping alternative change flavor palette meal   Finally butter cake   Top 3 dessert all time   Don't know don't wanna know   just want enjoy again again   Fantastic   All items come la carte sure feast sides   Also inquire half orders restaurant surprisingly accommodating changes fish cooked changes ingredients orders sizing   Mastro's best  <EOR> Mastro's Ocean Club fine dining establishment located Aria Hotel Casino  ambiance set well architecture particularly astounding service exquisite  server Joe game  water glass wine glass never reached half empty or half full   Ordered Bone Marrow Lobster Bisque Ocean Club Crab Cakes Sauteed Broccoli Gorgonzola Mac Cheese 22 oz  Bone in Ribeye Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake    Bone Marrow Holy Donkey Punching Jesus astounding  never Bone Marrow before but its alluring presence menu enough sample it  Bone Marrow comes half charred split bone serving toasted baguette spread on  flavor texture taste everything amazing  order every time should well   Ocean Club Crab Cakes Hearty crab cakes more crab cake  fact cakes fall apart softest touch chunks crab meat separating ease only minimal amount filler used  Flavor spice more enough accent cakes   Lobster Bisque Oftentimes Lobster Bisque comes heavily buttered even most finest dining establishment  Butter easy thing add dish increase its flavor without actually improving its originality substance  However Mastro's Lobster Bisque does perpetuate rather full bodied bisque generous portion lobster inside  thickness akin bisque should be   Sauteed Broccoli Opting slightly healthier route dishes still impressed but course sauteed broccoli only much done while keeping true   Gorgonzola Mac Cheese perfect compliment Bone in Ribeye hearty side that  shame hotel fridge monitored scale restocking fee otherwise would no issue taking remainder me   22 oz  Bone in Ribeye finer Ribeyes had  generous amount fat seared salted well enough exceedingly juicy  Cooked perfection rare cool red center while black crust searing iron still present    Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake Fuck   Amazing   The servings sizes sides plentiful prices you'd expect such establishment  wary those giving Mastro's bad review due price service such establishment would careful hire only proven servers would wager reviewers themselves standoffish party  <EOR> Delicious beginning end  appetizers steak fish sides all made perfection  dessert warm butter cake absolutely

Ordered bone marrow 3 MASSIVE shrimp appetizer served dry ice well   bone marrow comes bread never before but since everyone raved thought would give try   it very good but don't know hype all general   it's just delicacy? shrimp delicious but fan cocktail sauce   waaaay strong me    Ordered lobster tail impressed all  However if smoky taste seafood then all means order it  fan least very disappointed  sides Gorgonzola mac cheese chic peas  Both buttered perfection definitely worth fat calories    I also happened birthday surprised Butter Cake ice cream whipped cream everyone couldn't stop talking OMG completely understand why  would never chosen order but say confidence hands down tastiest most well made desserts ever eaten  lived until try it  <EOR> The food unbelievably amazing  service awesome very 5 star elite  location always busy always recommend place even if franchise  those restaurants remember taste food more presentation  always treat bringing friends families truly  i never tired  crystal's location adds star because am happy located inside crystals mall instead casino stand alone   Your must tries * any steak cuts  * bone marrow  * wild caught fish selections  They also accommodate your share plates if need it <EOR> I'm shocked place averaging high is  ate second time last night meal best defined overpriced mediocrity  oysters good steak ok desert waste calories   1st time part hosted corporate event food bad  hoped if eating table vs private room would better  Wrong!  Save your money eat elsewhere    Preferably City Center though all those restaurants seem overrated  <EOR> One best seafood restaurants to  Definitely must if city serve  King Crab legs must get  Dungeness crab cocktail all large chunks nothing shredded  Lobster bisque outstanding actual pieces lobster it  <EOR> One favorites now gone gutter   Lack attention detail regarding reservation celebrating special occasion lame excuse credit system handling chase visas overall unappetizing experience    frequent customer Mastro's annoyed way management handling consumers due fraud alert credit card   Very impersonal humiliating overall disgusting   did enjoy meal but don't feel ever return any Mastro's near far future   even told trying pay chase visas issue   eating is    BTW credit fine all resolved but treated lepers leave   HORRIBLE <EOR> Over rated over priced!

Such genius idea  $39 side    expect something amazing was! flavorful lobster pieces each bite  definitely again  Cream corn nothing stands other cream corn tried before  Though could tell corn cut fresh corn rather using canned corn which plus    Complimentary bread variety    probably 4 5 different types   Service 1 10 I'd give 7 5  Server wasn't personable attentive   1 appetizer 2 sides 2 steaks came $188  <EOR> Best food EVER  Steak perfectly cooked lobster mash die for  Didn't really creamed spinach but BUTTER CAKE YUMMY!!!!!! If reservation ask sit Linus section  He best waiters EVER!!!!! <EOR> Before heading night partying XS buddy found ourselves wandering around Cosmopolitan looking good restaurant try   While rest friends grabbing dinner literal hole in the wall pizza counter upstairs wanted take advantage opportunity trying something little more unique   Well assuming could find somewhere didn't crowd each first few tries met wait times 45 mins longer   Hoping better luck mall City Center next door eventually worked way over Mastro's Ocean Club check things there   Greeted friendly hostess opportunity immediate seating search came end   Score table seating bar!  For while now heard number good things Mastro's friends LA   service food they've all mentioned great experiences were   end meal could certainly see mean   perusing through menu seafood steaks ended going grilled Chilean Sea Bass side order Garlic Mashed Potatoes friend split rather wanted myself but needed share justify getting it    Now know   ordering fish dish first ever trip Mastro's pretty counter intuitive considering reputation steakhouse   However given two Ocean Club spots figured maybe should give seafood shot since don't know if it'll readily offered pure steakhouse spots   When orders brought table admit wasn't stunning first glance   Although cut larger anticipated which never bad thing wasn't much terms frills dressing   Since everything la carte literally just fish plate half lemon side seasoning   Despite lonely may looked though there's no questioning quality   Although Chilean sea bass generally more forgiving when comes cooking because its fatty nature done perfectly regardless   meat soft tender moist throughout   Flavor wise couldn't ask much more modest seasoning great buttery velvety sort flavor fish   Excellent   As sides Garlic Mashed pretty good   liked consistency thick but gloppy thin flavor wasn't potent   While would generally prefer stronger punch worked well overpower sea bass   addition friend also slipped order skinny fries let tell basket fries really basket fries   order huge mound fried potato goodness even chipping away throughout meal still plenty left other friend snack when he joined us   Oh can't forget mention bread basket all served hot soft salted butter   All ones tried good but favorite toast like bread cheese   so good   As rest experience everything else spot on   server Sarah awesome really attentive friendly pretty damn cute   Now sure last part MIGHT something but seriously really cute   While kind odd located mall really liked vibe place   main dining area sort semi open balcony check pictures   quite distinctive look while piano singer bar   While music conversations little tough no worse if sitting large group    While somewhat regret having ordered beef instead fish no complaints plus still under damn zero reduced beef pledge    said know back try more menu anyways saw several tables seafood tower well table tree house section   Great ambiance date well while cheap meal certainly worth price   But then could just waitress induced bias doing talking too   <EOR> **This review bar area only**  I've heard many great things restaurant reading other Yelp reviews decided better time try place birthday? better way sitting bar partaking some artistically created adult beverages?  For starters place located smack middle Crystals Mall can't miss it  big wooden orb shaped thing seams floating center all action  pretty neat but other reviews mentioned sure I'd want spend $200+ dinner mall atmosphere  None less quite unique experience did great job at least bar area making sure music drowned most mall sounds   I knew drinks would pricey prepared but others may shocker  extensive list specialty drinks starting $16 but most $18  told in house specialty lemon drop which came over dry ice didn't actually try though  did try Chocolate Martini $18 which won over because giant chocolate covered strawberry side glass  truly dessert martini glass! Other views correct when order martini give shaker along your drink refill your glass almost 2 drinks 1  also tried Banana Foster $18 delicious but expected  whipped cream expected top but shaken inside gave drink bit lumpy texture   The bf tried Mastro's Mojito also $18 honestly very good  came served tall glass no shaker side  wouldn't recommend ordering one  mom tried Dragon Fire $18 which very tasty but yes hot spicy something quench your thirst  She rounded off evening Flur de Blu $18 considering well  She liked but tried glad dessert style drinks instead   The service good  bar wasn't busy much attention wanted  able watch them drinks fun part experience  saw all kinds great food coming kitchen asked food menu elected order anything since we'd already while run tab $100  However bar tender offered bring bread basket  bread great basket came several different types bread super soft butter  Note self next time ask bread basket when arrive free   I think drop some time again when mood dessert martini afford $18 drinks  <EOR> Every single time Las Vegas sure reservation Mastro's right hotel reservation    love eat bird cage    Service EXCELLENT!!!  everything possible feel welcome all time  <EOR> Mastros always special place heart can't come Vegas without making stop dinner night    The service always great along food  always following Burrata salad Bone filet Grilled asparagus  Scalloped potatoes Moscow mule  I've also tried Truffle gnocchi on salty side just FYI You can't leave without having amazing buttercake! great ending meal  <EOR> Great food!!
