Love resort pool but bar mere shadow once was   Used great drink menu plenty options but now much if any  Friendly service though  <EOR> The bartenders rude unattentive ordered took over hour food terrible service <EOR> Cute little Pool tiki bar Tahiti Village  Flanked waterfall serving cocktails wine beer typical pool bar grub  quesadillas nachos chicken tenders burgers hot dogs sandwiches pizzas salads fish tacos  All pretty reasonably priced  $6 11   Drinks $10 12 oz best deal 32 oz sports cup $15  Beer $4 wine $6   Didn't Mai Tai but mimosa sea breeze good  Also didn't kids' strawberry slush plastic fake tasting Kids mojito better $6 each pretty pricer $4 would seem more appropriate     But great enjoy drink bite eat poolside hot Vegas day!  NOTE Open Tahiti Village guests only need room key in  <EOR> Not bad pool bar resort  Would nice servers attend pool area drinks  Might something consider if trying boost drink sales  <EOR> I don't care if weekday   it's summer vacation time 111 degrees pool packed pool bar CLOSED!  Give break   see only having open weekends during off season but during summer or when resort sold out should open   real pain ass walk down restaurant drinks there  <EOR>
