Only complaint hard hear drivethu  Other give place 5 stars!!! <EOR> Farm Basket used many locations around Vegas Valley but Tropicana location losing its lease only left   Farm Basket essentially drive thru restaurant specializing poultry products  around decades several locations Valley if see some sort establishment around town shaped small barn chances Farm Basket once occupied property   The food itself very good filling  portions good size good fact order off kids menu STILL often much food and no problem if order off regardless age  The menu itself quite diverse featuring variety poultry products  Want straight chicken fingers fries? They've that  But if want something little more exotic also Gobbler which features real turkey signature Cluck E Tos which essentially taquitos poultry instead meat beef   The big complaint only location left great part town  remaining location near West Charleston campus College Southern Nevada unless you're area expect long painful commute here    All thongs considered Farm Basket delicious just shame don't variety locations once did  If you're neighborhood swing but don't your way it  <EOR> Maybe can't Chick Fil Vegas yet but still awesome chicken sandwich Farm Basket   babies haven't changed since kid awesome!  clucketo's also dee lish!  little pricey but worth it   Puts other chain chicken sandwiches shame!  used several around town but only seen recent travels   while rumors swirl over possible arrival Chick Fil A still sate your desire Farm Basket while wait! <EOR> A little expensive but Cluckitoes light crispy covered cheese  Mmmm     Super Clucker Great Gobbler delicious well   fries seasoned perfectly   sure child could order except chicken finger meal   owner sure everything perfect when he's otherwise check your order  Small only 6 tables inside drive thru small parking lot   No vegetarian choices offer desserts ask when order drink some come cans  <EOR> I coming entire 21 years life  once problem until today  cook simply forgot put season salt fries  returned counter asked side salt  young women counter rolled eyes didn't believe cook forgot salt  Infront she argument cook said said she didn't know talking about  young women needs customer service training  cook fixed seconds could still hear back round talking salt  <EOR> Got Gobbler Sandwich    batter taste stuffing!!!!

Forget KFC Popeyes all those others flat fabulous  Support small businesses keep them busy!!!   Yum <EOR> Farm Basket? eating thought headed towards warm casket   The fried chicken family fried chicken dinner absolutely fried day or days earlier then thrown microwave  made mistake reheating leftover fried chicken microwave before reheat job  Never such thick soggy coat breading piece fried chicken slid off greasy mess wet disgusting piece  Thick soggy   and tasteless! And comic relief inside meat dry  Just worst piece fried chicken ever had  dare find elementary school cafeteria could produce worse  Even girlfriend agreed wow bad    To elaborate rest meal     The rolls fresh The cole slaw dry tasteless The fries INSANELY over salted     and better mashed potatoes lunchtime Chinese buffet   I really hoped could far yelp without tossing one star rating as soft spot business owners but touch handing across counter ridiculous   I might eat fried chicken joint twice year but options such Popeye's KFC Church's everywhere   how anyone justify coming beyond me    I would love dine someone gave place 3 more stars just see could possibly feign compliment any level  <EOR> Sorry  tho Farm Basket used favorite places eat  forget now!  Ordered Chicken Fingers  yukkkk!   breading pealing off greasy disgusting hell  Didnt take pic cuz yukked out  the fries didnt taste chicken used either  I met owner once party he said fries made special chicken flavor  not anymore tho  they didnt taste good greasy tasting  yukkkkkk  sorry guys your act together! <EOR> THIS PLACE CRIME! Ate many times kid  store neighborhood under Tropicana did too  10 years drove past W  Charleston decided rekindle old love affair  Not!!!

Killer chicken baby!  We dinner champions tonight   6 piece special comes incredible tasting fried chicken 2 rolls 2 mashed taters gravy side salad coleslaw Mac salad   Cesar Q stuffed little piggies!  chicken delicately fried over seasoned   rolls sweet glaze brushed over tops   Something between sweet savory   good!  mashed potatoes gravy taste fresh almost thanksgiving dinner!!!  opted macaroni salad enjoyed too   If your extra hungry would suggest order cluckeetos! little spears shot down heaven!  Little taquito rolled chicken corn tortilla   light crispy!  add cheese lettuce hot mild salsa   I'd back just little critters    Love place open year round  quick easy drive through process well seating inside   guys assisted window friendly efficient  <EOR> Fatty delicious goodness! sad last remaining location    sucks far house or maybe best!     They so called diet fried chicken  Somehow claim less fatty less calorific because pull off skin THEN fry it  Hmmm   don't buy stuff healthy but damn tasted awesome  Plus loved let 2 legs unlike most fried chicken places require leg thigh combo    We also tried cloqueetos ok doesn't look right but spelled something that!    basically just chicken taquitos tons cheese lettuce salsa  Delish but definitely could used some sour cream    Mashed potatoes gravy heavenly    Biggest disappointment gross cold rolls came bag  Fried chicken places typically YUMMY homemade rolls bisquits   SOMETHING    wtf crappy grocery store sh*t guys?
