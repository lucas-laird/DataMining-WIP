When arrived two people line food within 10 minutes ordering  5 minutes ordered did 3 4 customers ordering all food extremely quick well  gyro took almost 30 minutes table  used waiting long Greek food best experience first time here  <EOR> I wanting try place lunch coworker's recommendation  Since little over 10 minutes office decided try ordering Grubhub first time  Before placed order said total time 30 40 mins   placed order turned into 90 mins! Yikes! So   decided cancel Grubhub order just place directly   I drive 10+ minutes park when walk inside huuuge line only person working counter  waiting least 10 minutes which seems silly why least more person working register handle crowd more? top person counter also taking ordering calls wait finish making line move even slower  almost ready bail but since waited long and made trek decided stay   When finally front ordering thankfully fairly smooth  food when asked told would another 15 minutes ready  wish lady behind counter would volunteered information instead having ask placed order  But once again already committed might well      Ordering food to go kind weird because don't give number there's really no where sit wait  didn't want take spot table people dining since already crowded but didn't want stand because gonna least 15 minutes? whole thing just felt weird clunky  saw lot people to go orders would thought they'd better process   After few minutes decided check order found original Grubhub order actually made instead being cancelled  panicked because just placed order same exact thing  lady register assured order cancelled wouldn't charged even though made   same time order placed few minutes ago came she packaged that  While thought she would just give second cancelled order nice gesture since already ready she instead put side zero interest offering me  huge disappointment other places happily offer mistake orders all time  mean food wasn't cheap begin with  But since back work didn't want fight it   And food? just okay but definitely worth hassle  steak decent but lamb super tough  medium which lady recommended don't know if should cooked less what  also REALLY hyped feta fries but when them way cheesy  also didn't taste very feta me? If love cheese then you'll fine but if you're looking more crispy fries feta accents like other places to think you'll disappointed   Overall hesitant recommend place lunch  If order ahead prepared long wait  <EOR> Happy see business thrive Las Vegas community   Serving great food!  quick service great quality friendly service   Restaurants Gusta Tacos Great Greek coming into southwest part valley great thing!
