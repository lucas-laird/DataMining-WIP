The first thing noticed good smell when walked   little hesitant but wasn't buying followed friendly host back where she seated us   I impressed large amount selection had  also huge dessert bar included lot flavors icecream  The food probably luke warm am sure when last changed dishes   The potstickers hard but good flavor good sauce   Loved seafood delight stuffed mushroom beef broccoli but disappointed cream puffs which odd flavor   It bargain but something back for  <EOR> Ok first off just rating location would given four stars   location very good wide variety food all which highest quality but price disappoint   highly recomend getting down steamed clams!  Yummy!  Now location north cent absolutely terrible   bad bring star down other place just because same people   north barely food variety lol shrim cooked five different way along crab  legs   Trust want stay away place   However location worth it   Hope did confuse guys much <EOR> It total disappointment  Mongolian BBQ done Mexican spices horrible! buffet bad meat poor quality cooking lousy  eaten Chinese buffets restaurant food hundreds times never disgusted  If hungry care quality fill but don't expect more! waitresses rude she spilled sauce over Dad's jacket left trail floor but did anything it  Just sad                  <EOR> My first review oh shame  disappointed place sure describe just knew write review Yelp! warn someone     The FOOD One word  SHITTY if your taste buds don't serve trash them  usually never picky food but wouldn't recommend place anyone  left feeling unsatisfied  only food fresh looks hours upon hours  sauces food dried up  around 5pm if helps anyone   They pretty good selection dishes but everything bland tasted worst buffet ever let rephrase worst Asian food ever   taste food before putting out?  Not everything bad did few good things stuffed mushrooms crab stuffed oysters nothing memorable    The SERVICE Now some more complaints  workers seem never worked server before no refills entire meal   can't believe this!  would understand if place actually busy but swear only 5 tables sat 2 servers working   guy servers literally looked he trying sleep standing up   your father's store?   The RESTROOM Fucking disgusting!  walked looked around washed hands   swear felt hands dirtier   toilet horrible outside gas station toilet never cleaned   used toilet seat cover still toilet probably fresh diarrhea toilet   God does anyone work place?

Ok would no problem tipping bitch if she refilled drink once but think she deserves anything more $2 service received bullshit   mad shitty food service just wanted leave place even complain taking extra money  <EOR> This actually pretty complete Asian buffet good things other Asian buffets gone to  example actually sashimi though meat kind dry  also large selection ice cream frying station large selection dim sums soups because during Christmas tons crab legs lobster    The service pretty good too   it little overpriced but guess seafood  fair warning though    you FIGHT your lobster  Right when seafood come huge crowd people gathered around seafood area  bring new plate every 10 minutes but food gone minute    it actually pretty amusing watching Asian parents grab lobsters off tray soon can    it's real life hungry hungry hippos  <EOR> When Yelped wondered really trust 8 reviews 4 stars? hesitant but added list possible dining locations list anyways    The food decent mainly Chinese though thus restaurant name  mainly interested if sushi Chinese food satisfy both sisters parents  place fancy other buffets elegant but hey only $9 99 weekends decent!   Although clearly see them making sushi fresh ones tried but still good some okay  But just because love sushi expect something more  Other food good general     The best part end! expecting some soft serve ice cream almost every other buffets but all  variety ice cream choose if you're buying outside vendor tub ice cream all   green tea red bean strawberry mango mint chocolate rocky road think few more fruit flavors  Quite lame rant much just ice cream but just made experience much better!

Don't expect much buffet otherwise you'll unsatisfied  Keep mind buffet only $9 99 per person those high class 5 star food  your gotta save money but still want something decent won't later regret while sitting bathroom  Bottom line need something cheap keep wallet bulky?

no lack variety must say only tried half offer  Didn't quite sushi Mongolian grill but didn't look bad  Overall give restaurant meh  <EOR> You'll read original review place   still come all time cheapest buffet decent sushi town   But tonight around 9pm almost everything made no effort refill since closing soon   it    buffet super cheap but if they're going neglect buffet much before closing time give some sort don't give fuck customer discount   keep review 4 stars hope just late night problem earlier menu much better  <EOR> My sister said place pretty good but she also came off night once didn't high expectations  husband wanted try place he likes Asian buffets  $7 99 each dropped $9 99 dinner you don't pay first unlike Buffet @ Asia   rating posted wall rating which good thing   The food thought pretty good garlic shrimp burped all night coconut shrimp surprisingly yummy teriyaki chicken good flavor fried scallops good bbq chicken sticks good flavor mushroom chicken more mushrooms chicken but  wanted anyway california roll fresh rice hard usually buffets cheese rangoon hard mess though fried fritter not greasy just enough sugar sprinkled     The string beans tasted funny you know sometimes veggies taste metallic dirt   husband said he could gotten more taste takeout container lo mein noodles very bland  He also said won ton soup worst he ever had    There mongolian station but didn't see raw veggies though but then again didn't check other side ice cream station same general area see mean kind weird setup? the mango really good almost tasted Magnolia Filipino brand found asian markets green tea some ice particles   other dessert available lychee mmm bananas some more bruised others pineapple green jello no hardened outer skin red jello chocolate cocoa cake really good actually macaroons cream puffs    Some dessert food right next salads little awkward setup but suppose works  Some dishes didn't sample include shrimp heads crawfish not fan sliced sausage sio mai pork bun noodles fried rice salads   The Pinball Machine effect call it many asian diners 85% 90% diners later saw tour bus outside parking lot actually running food if going disappear immediately just watch out   Yes just warning bumped  line skipped well  If space quickly other well  Just letting know expect  husband couldn't wait over when all clear    Sticky floors denoted Caution Wet Floors signs all over near food stations  careful if wearing boots heels  saw employee mopping floors which nice constantly being tended BTW but still careful walking those areas  food stations messy but seemed some containers completely food  noticed man kept going cooks asking something  also noticed man seated near asked something brought over table because second time he asked they didn't know happened it     The decor inside totally transformed when used Black Angus steak house dark rich woods dark lighting semi private booth seating adding anonymity factor  Basically main dining room wide open pretty bright lighting   seating two lanes being booth other tables chairs narrow side food stations well located near bathrooms  where seated but employee sweeping away all food heck food ended floor must mean slobby customers still kinda gross sweeping   busy hostess asked if ok  husband wanted booth   Final verdict husband thought Buffet @ Asia better agree  think solid three stars though  know good least know avoid  Though employees seem rushed still pleasant attentive refills   <EOR> I came lunch thinking would much better Krazy Buffet but wrong  When started munching items noticed barely warm  food picked under heat lamp long! noticed Lotus Balls could only eat half because most hard chew  pot stickers crunchy edges  pastries toasty  only positive thing Green Tea Ice cream stuffed mushrooms price  $16 00 two people  If broke don't mind mediocre food would come hold dinner buffet looked little more promising  <EOR> Disclaimer am qualified write unbiased review Pacific Buffet because if comes Pacific am really jazzed stuffing mouth it  other words AYCE crab legs don't heart sing  Couple inherent distrust buffets am pretty much guaranteed fall love place named Pacific Buffet   However husband adores both seafood buffets ended night when weak content wherever he wanted go  service kind  quality decent but really probably ate total 33 bites  Everything greasy carby fried fishy which probably describes several people's dream meal but mine   My husband did consume 4 plates clams even thought those tasty  I am generally clam consumer  Other clams ate some vegetables soft tofu red bean desserts  green beans solid but spinach tasted fishy  salad turning brown left number buffet  red bean cookies ice cream surprisingly good  think ate 4 cookies husband proclaimed them worth price buffet alone  darn delicious    As left realized should probably given create your own stir fry section whirl  Still given eating habits personally sad star experience  burrito bowl later evening  <EOR> So reading reviews place figured would give try  wasn't expecting exceptional but other hand wasn't expecting sitting 3 hours later listening fiancée puke guts out    That being said impresses all food while there  would probably received 2 star rating only because cream cheese wontons fast drink refills decent ice cream but everything else horrible!   I knew going $9 95 dinner buffet but could least try something semi edible isn't fried already made shipped frozen    I usually trust yelpers but must say guys let down one  <EOR> This good Asian style buffet   food presented fancy but cooked well nice flavors   price very reasonable I am sure making much money charging $9 99 + tax + tip dinner    Service efficient staffs friendly   What didn't care for 1  sushi preparation   rice overcooked overworked most likely case point solid layer rice NOT good eats surrounding fillings    2  Dinner plates should washed better!  Why take few extra seconds check plates cleaned before bringing them service  minor detail reflects lack care some staff leaves negative impression   What thought good 1  Vegetables cooked very well seasoned perfectly  2  Mongolian Wok style noodles  3  Cold foods served cold chilled properly hot foods served hot kept warm steam table  4  Wide selections foods desserts  <EOR>
