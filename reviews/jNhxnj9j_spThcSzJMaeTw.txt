Nonetheless came bit 9 pm noticed steady stream Chinese families dinner too   Specials menu all Chinese though   waiter couldn't much translating beyond 'beef chicken etc ' ended giving Midnight Specials menu which happily English!  All items $4 99 each!  Score!  We ended * Deep Fried Salt Pepper Tofu $4 99 Little cubes tofu deep fried spicy   both enjoyed this    * Steamed Chicken Mushroom $4 99 very simple dish exactly described chicken mushroom  * Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodle $7 95 came off regular menu ordered noodles separate sauce  Y'know noodles stay crunchy don't soggy underneath fast  Overall find ourselves when we're looking some authentic Chinese food without all frills   Sure service expect only waiter working need wave down when want him   But works especially when we're given specials menu!  Update! 12 11 10 Drove evening shut doors!  Nearby Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli confirmed CLOSED! <EOR> I am always skeptical trying new Chinese food restaurants but definitely back Kan's Kitchen    I tasted following Yang Chow Fried Rice rice very tasty hit spot! only request bigger pieces meats   Beef Pan Fried Noodles certain expectations plate met all them  noodles crispy gravy delicious  Together made perfect dish   Spicy Salt Pepper Pork very generous Spicy Salt Pepper awesome mix your fried rice  YUM! can't forget mention pork very tender   Strings Beans XO sauce If don't vegetables you'll change your mind once taste dish  You'll finish plate you'll finish bag M M's    Overall food greasy salty but just enough authentic Chinese food  <EOR>
