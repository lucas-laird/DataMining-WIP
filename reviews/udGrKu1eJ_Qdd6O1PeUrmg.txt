I usually LOVE pt's Sahara but other side town tried location    There drunk couple bar arguing being Las Vegas  bartender named 'Tip' entertained argument instead trying calm couple down  He also used profanity loudly during conversation  made atmosphere feel chaotic slightly aggressive    We arrived happy hour ordered 1 beer Tip charged 6 50 beer  asked happy hour prices why over charged he seemed frustrated us  But then realized he indeed overcharging proceeded put 2 bucks cash counter irritated manner saying just GIVE 2 dollars exist happily rude unprofessional   We weren't being obnoxious customers  Especially obnoxious compared drunk couple Tip kept arguing with   Lastly Tip talking guy next said very clearly can't wait until game over hate crowd watch game he referring us? all yelling customers around bar?   Either way bartender performance attitude negative unpleasant  returning <EOR> Favorite PTs Vegas  Actually feels local bar  Love bartender! Wish caught name   Sunday around noon she awesome  Never heard pt cantina but definitely come back  <EOR> Love going location its close house very convenient  Nice friendly atmosphere Good drink specials especially 12 2am Happy Hour  long day job its nice unwind  I'll definitely returning <EOR> Pretty cool atmosphere here  Cool place hang friends boyfriend girlfriend even new dates  drinks great pool tables few arcade games  Great bar relax cool prices  <EOR> Sarah bartender great! Always great little place grab few drinks work  Grab some nachos carne asada fries next door enjoy your beer! Half off drinks during happy hour! <EOR> I PLENTY PT's around city   some pool tables some kitchens others just bars your shitty Roberto's Tacos other no name Mexican spot attached it  favorites ones kitchen buzz order food without having into another building keep drinking   This place that  fact PT's random Mexican food place attached it  why five stars? Well three stars because bar bar any establishment supply alcohol A OK book  FOUR stars because when walk into place instantly feel LOVE  walking into PLENTY places where first thing hear your ID kid? mean yes look 16 but say hi possibly smile while you're it? Alicia quick say hello   SO quick sister feel welcomed    So FIVE stars because Alicia SO  DAMN  AMAZING didn't care into another building order food   I didn't care TVs bit smaller side when watching Knights game   I didn't care wait bit another round drinks  100% certain anyone else serving night probably would back bar  But now certainly would place see myself becoming regular at   Also when almost Alicia's birthday  happy belated    hope your vacation awesome hope whoever served drinks met your expectations CUZ GIRL DESERVE IT  <EOR> Eh    went happy hour  couple decent beers tap but nothing special  food half priced but service slow  Only two bartenders taking orders kitchen kind backed up  food decent but again nothing spectacular  sure I'd back  <EOR> What terrible PT's is  moment pulled into parking lot bad experience  Upon walking immediately felt unwelcome  bartender Tip continuously argued 2 customers  customer kept nagging childishly but he continued argue insult using profanity bully  He should taken high road ending conversation sake customer service  When ordered drink which during happy hour advertised half price bartender over charged me  asked drink price he responded 6 50  skeptical beer 13 00 before happy hour prices asked if supposed $3 50 $4 75 he charged me? He became upset going through math me  He exclaimed loudly very annoyed manner right  He even took two dollars pocket put bar aggressively saying could it  very rude seemed though he looking fight  just wanted watch baseball game drink happy hour  He continued argue woman husband complained loudly throughout hour he disliked crowd tonight he couldn't wait till game over people would leave  If he hates job much everything bothers he should there  extremely negative aggressive environment   returning  <EOR> This PT's loses stars because don't serve food but gain back attentive friendly bartenders  generally only come location bet sports but if anything wrong machine bartender always quick help offers hello welcome back every time walk door    Unfortunately location always smells ash tray regardless actual amount smokers bar  Because barely want stay more few minutes before retreating fresh air  <EOR> I'm usually guy disregards haters skips negative yelp reviews because people emotional bias opinion based experience     time heeded negative warning would saved me!!  I 1 30am Monday way home holiday party completely sober  dead empty walked bar sat down moment read Vegas weekly before ordering  30 seconds glancing between menu paper before first encounter bar tender zero etiquette  She treated drunk retarded asking um focus second demanded order immediately gamble immediately if going sit empty bar     After short conversation during which maintained winning attitude let know going sit look over menu settle before ordering she bluntly forcefully gave third option door  gladly thanked gratefully exited God awful bar    I represent lot money big tips referrals long term customer those right offer personal prompt service  Unfortunately whole PT's brand lost at least customer tonight  If option zero stars would pick because never customer  <EOR> So work down street live 5 minutes away too  Thus come simply convenience because place awesome    This PT's does serve food some other ones do  However they're connected Don Tortaco a Roberto's type place where order your food they'll bring inside PTs   good book because sometimes number Corona's need taco three    The service PT's ok though nothing write home about  They're always prompt drinks don't think ever wait more few minutes drink order taken   no complaints all    Ultimately come place when need drink work  really convenient regard service ok too  recommend come all way grab beer? No may other equally cool PT's your area serve you  <EOR> I great experience when stopping drink play some video poker  bartender awesome! He very attentive did well making drinks  gambling actually loose PT's  able play while win some money  juke box great variety music suit drinking habits lol <EOR> We came play awhile few drinks  Alicia amazing!
