Then she just allowed minors gamble order alcohol   The food drink experience   Drinks fun part   bypass initial checkpoint sat couch area but still confused if order your food sit down table service another thing didn't ask when busy saying over 21   waitress came menu but  seemed bit zealous where felt rushed decide drink   know if she felt bad she earlier she want place but definitely did help mindset place    waitress took drink orders two check pastries have  part may just bit odd ordered told only 1 paper bag left hold pastries asked if she put both one  fine since order  However friend behind order pastry separately actually paper bag when supposedly ran minute ago wait did she just lied me???  She also moved very slow seriously never seen someone taking long cookie muffin  could've chopped down tree processed paper bags within time  part peeve don't think ever place when order drinks let alone alcoholic drinks place napkin acting coaster then drink  Isn't basic 101 knowledge?  ask napkins only find waitress sitting down smoking clock   even allowed?  If allowed state NV then apologize least solved smokey scent issue here   Sometimes forget places aside casinos also allowed smoking inside   Anyway only speak 2 drinks since didn't try others   Chai Martini Soymilk drink menu recommendation  Apparently chai martini now requires no mixing  Top layer chai tea alcohol bottom layer soy milk   distinctively see separation   would nice mix myself but oh wait nothing stir with   chai taste bad but definitely say best chai martini ever had   good if alcohol but want drink martini glass   Tangerine smoothie should apologize all smoothies   felt really refreshing when first drinking but aftertaste sugary burn similar ones when drink slurpy icee    Redeemable point +1 star muffin cookie ordered bad friend thought drink okay     Overall never set foot place again since don't seem care returning customers    hoped could've nice change other coffee houses potential lunch spot future  Oh well another place  <EOR> I stopped quick lunch recently 2 00 afternoon  woodsy metal decor made comfortable modern vibe  ordered wrap iced white mocha counter took seat near window  plenty natural light room which plus   All sandwiches salads wraps hand made they're ordered difference  special wrap kind augmented chef's salad crisp fresh tasty  iced white mocha exceptional   Great service friendly folks behind counter serving  <EOR> I hope become regular! came breakfast 10 a m  Sunday empty!

Then noticed some cool coffee drinks chalkboard he said he only does coffee  When people ask something fancy he gives them coffee because he doesn't care learn fancy stuff  asked food he said just bar food nothing good  Wow worst salesman ever  Seriously guy complained everything other job job  won't ever back here  Ain't nobody time that  <EOR> Ack bummed place  Used absolute favorite coffee over Starbucks over anything!
