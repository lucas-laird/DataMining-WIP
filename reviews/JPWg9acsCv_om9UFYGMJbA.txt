So thing most remember first visit Fleming's food which probably good thing   However expected more skill enthusiasm server especially when paying pretty penny dinner  <EOR> This great neighborhood steakhouse!  service food always consistently good   Plus sign Friends Flemings give little perks every often including gift certificates free wine tastings!  petite filet mignon Flemings potatoes glass cabernet   You'll heaven!  try mints way out   yummy! <EOR> A big disappointment  My fiancèe decided dinner Fleming's day special Prime Rib soirèe  first time Fleming's easily drive ten miles hotel west side location   We met table nice looking waitress whose beautiful smile seemed able turn off quite easily  ordered drink two glasses wine asked prime rib dinner  choice salad arrived Caesar's smothered garlic   I thought moment those italian american restaurant where garlic seems everywhere But still think italians around smelling garlic? Come your lost time warp   The entrees arrived some waiting  prime rib? asked  No answered miss cold smile clearly isn't  Just finished prime rib broght steak   Ah    Then she said something being bargain getting steak same special price prime rib special   WOW   I fly Roma Vegas 2 3 times year business leisure gladly spend some money wonderful city indulging shows shopping fine dining   Saving 10 bucks having liked bargain  The steak good however literally covered black pepper  But why? such decent meet need over top unhealthy dressing  took some time brush pepper off steak then cold  We excellent crème brulè end   All all back  Pity charming smile but stick good old timer Delmonico SW Steakhouse next time  Maybe CUT Palazzo which really want try  More expensive Fleming's but probably more professional  <EOR> I am giving three stars because service great  food other hand    disappointing  ordered petite filet fiancé orders most expensive steak menu  Both flavorless  am complain especially birthday Valentine's Day ate half steak  very nice waitress could tell wasn't loving offered new steak  declined simply because felt would replaced same quality steak  manager comped meal which very nice  BUT morning woke very unhappy stomach    I returning  appreciate service but quality did match price point  <EOR> My boyfriend Ohio extended visit craving good steak  kind last minute reservation preferred steakhouse Smith Wollensky's Strip going happen  looked steakhouses yelp found Flemmings  happy reservation online looked forward dinner The bone rib eyes good but dry aging S W hard compare far everyone failed  company keeping made dinner remember meal very good well  If can't into S W again back  <EOR> Wonderful service pretty good food   Friday night restaurant busy but annoyingly so   ordered drinks bar seating pretty quickly that     We ordered Chopped Salad which recommend Mozzarella Sweet Tomato salad which little sweet though I'd clearly warned    Filet excellent lamb chops okay   Fleming's potatoes just potatoes au gratin jalapenos which couldn't taste   Kinda meh   ordered chocolate lava cake dessert which amazing   Overall place recommendation   pretty good wine selection well  <EOR> Let first saying If having bad day don't feel being work but work general public should probably come work  very least check your troubles door     That being said first experience Flemings terrible! Aside food being mediocre Mastros much better server seemed extremely bothered when he asked questions menu  bringing wrong drink wrong side times  thought clear  until bill came  split bill seat using two cards $120 cash  server took upon himself charge majority bill card $145 put another portion bill another card $50 use $60 $120 cash towards bill pocketed rest tip! looked over bill before leaving he would've received $170 we already planning tip $60 top $50 tip he already received  tip person would've wound paying 4 other people's meals  When pointed check wrong he proceed throw money table tell he didn't care walked away  Luckily Kate manager figured everything every thing squared away  <EOR> I feel bad writing review but underwhelmed dinner Flemings  haven't years but used think Flemings more upscale steakhouse but last nights dinner feel common steakhouse expensive price tags   The good filet mignon tender delicious  Flemings potatoes creamed corn delicious but super salty  desserts yummy   The blah lobster very fishy tasting   Flemings salad messy plate lettuce sloppy toppings thrown top  felt someone made salad off salad bar odd ratio tomatoes other toppings lettuce   The shrimp appetizer super disappointing  thought shrimp flavorless   The bread loaf boring bread little overtoasted stale   Service fine no complaints but nothing stood out   With many other fine dining options Summerlin can't think reason why would come back Flemings  <EOR> Flemings all great high value happy hour dinner service befitting higher end steakhouse happy hour burger drink specials fantastic value high quality dinner items albeit indulgence well prepared thoughtfully presented   Nice touches abound such chocolate covered strawberries presented special occasions other such niceties   No peccadillos here!!! <EOR> Had group Great Happy Hour Service  Unfortunately several ordered $50 RibEye extremely dissapointing  Thin Cut over cooked slathered think butter? Could'nt understand why steaks where poor quality  Person group equated them much lesser quality restaurant  became obvious afterword why bar area busy no dinning room  Stick Great Happy Hour only which itself 4 5 stars  <EOR> I really think phenomenon where when someone pays exorbitant prices something automatically think better something less expensive  Dyson vacuums example  Mine seriously doesn't clean any better $80 Bissell but people SWEAR things themselves feel better spending $500 vacuum because just think must better because price  consumers placebo effect  think Fleming's falls into category sure   My parents wanted anniversary dad chose place because someone recommended him  mom called made reservations told them anniversary  When arrived greeted  promptly seated immediately which nice  first thing noticed stench sewage  bar under construction maybe something that  Since parents chosen place didn't want say anything but smell would made walk immediately  sat down both parents mentioned smell also  hostess wished parents happy anniversary presented them anniversary card  waiter came over things started off pretty well him  He seemed quick attentive  dad ordered calamari appetizer which moist mushy  dad ate most but couldn't stomach it    My dad both decided filet mignon while mom chose salmon  prices HIGH which wouldn't bad if getting lot quality even some quantity but found neither really there  entrees averaged over $50 did include anything other meat no veggie even sprig parsley  wanted baked potato meal baked potato side cost $10 50! Seriously?! 10 cent potato $10 50?! ahead ordered because couldn't imagine having just slab meat nothing else  $10 potato tasted baked yesterday then microwaved re warmed today  filet cooked nicely although lacked much way flavor  tried sauces sickly sweet pretty nasty  service downhill considerably once food placed table  server stopped 2 minutes food put down then never saw again  finished meal busser brought dad box leftovers waited server come back check  waited      and waited     and waited some more  He never came  Eventually dad grew impatient wanted leave hostess station bill  Even she couldn't find server  no anniversary extras some other reviews no dessert anything that  even see ya waiter   For comparisons sake preferred restaurant tonight would Kona Grill far here  Usually when order filet  filet Kona same size tastes virtually same  only difference would say Fleming's maybe more seared taste which opinion neither good bad  could take leave it  Kona your filet comes garlic mashed potatoes veggie side topped sauteed mushrooms  costs $29  usually order some California rolls appetizer $6 95  same price piece meat Fleming's could gotten filet MEAL not just piece meat THREE orders California rolls Kona would virtually no difference quality    Lastly atmosphere more reminiscent fancy restaurants late 80's early 90's  really loud really dark very appealing  Aside smell sewage which also smelled trying cover smell patchouli oil hostess kept walking back forth food line hacking head off tuberculosis patient  crowd restaurant mostly 70+   lot oxygen tanks walkers canes there  Definitely spot someone younger  think aside staff probably youngest person 33  <EOR> This steakhouse amazing! food always great staff awesome!! did remodel few months ago looks wonderful!!! definitely back!!! <EOR> Great service atmosphere food except called King Crap legs  expecting huge legs sliced half easy access meat but 5 maybe 6 legs smaller side difficult eat  But but still great time family  <EOR> Got came burger nice glass wine  Great atmosphere  Just higher expectations burger coming such nice steakhouse   fine but great  but good enough back  <EOR> This weekend having Steak Lobster dinner $50  incredible deal! girls greeted reception desk could sweeter   The first course salad terrific  Pick Caesar Seasonal  each  Both delish  Then steak lobster  heated butter dish brought before entree heat lobster butter  Both steak lobster perfectly done  best filets had  lobster very good  couldn't even finish it  Then choice any dessert  warm lava cake ordered ahead  comes raspberries 2 scoops vanilla ice cream little crispy wafers  turtle pie favorite  served warm splash caramel Chantilly whipped cream side   The food wonderful but server Schuyler Best!!

stopped Tuesday night hopping 15 minute wait  apparently fine folks around master planned community well aware good eats here   The atmosphere just any other traditional steakhouse  You've your white linens dark wood accents mood lighting etc  just other steakhouses you'll find typical steakhouse fare example wedge caesar salad French onion soup some seafood variety steaks  familiar comforting most importantly good   The crab cake appetizer $15 95 consists two small jumbo lump crab cakes lime butter sauce  They're lightly seasoned allowing sweetness crab meat shine   Unfortunately butternut squash soup $9 50 miss  Thin watery runny aren't good qualities any soup   The 14 oz  bone in filet $54 made it  While could benefitted more charred exterior seasoning spot quality beef well worth hefty price tag   We two sides  sautéed mushrooms $9 50 contained variety most which slightly overdone which actually prefer  sautéed sweet corn $8 50 average best   Surprisingly kid's menu  little guy tow he gladly ordered plate chicken tenders $14 95   came massive mound crispy fries topped several strips chicken  plate easily could fed two three kids  meal also included appetizer celery carrots apples ranch  kid's ice cream sundae additional $1   Splitting entree usually means wife room dessert  chocolate lava cake $10 95   You'll definitely want share dish  big mound cake oozing belgian chocolate  vanilla ice cream chopped pistachios provided wonderful contrast temperatures texture  Countless restaurants version dish but truly memorable  fresh whipped cream side didn't hurt either   The meal wasn't cheap but much cheaper similar Strip  may play safe menu but won't leave disappointed  If you're looking traditional steakhouse experience good know don't travel far it  <EOR> Had bacon wrapped filet crab stuffed shrimp only $33 yesterday   Good food service   special good until 15 th <EOR> We came couple friends late last night    The location pretty easy to  Lots parking if incline valet front door  I'd suggest making reservations since place could busy   The ambiance nice quiet    We sat newly remodeled expanded bar   We looked happy hour menu called Eight Nine Ten where select any small plate add 9oz  Big Pour just $5 8 10 pm nightly  My bf New Zealand Lamb Chops Fleming's Lobster Tempura   The lamb chops tender tasty  breading lobster tempura little thick   The menu well balanced wine selection list good   We really enjoyed dinner definitely back  <EOR> Nice interior layout bar higher dining area  Nice ambiance   dress code more casual laidback expected   dress your normal happy hour outfit   won't feel over under dressed   thrilled free starter bread   calamari cooked bell peppers onion instead just itself   little saucy used calamari but very tender   tried both PORCINI RUBBED FILET MIGNON PEPPERCORN STEAK   portions smaller some other steakhouses which perfect me   actually finished filet mignon   cooked perfectly   peppercorn steak little dry nothing really special   service top notch   also received small box chocolate because birthday  <EOR> Our server Logan provided excellent service along everyone else helped table  food great especially Brussels sprouts  Logan offered buy dessert compensate steak being over cooked but kindly declined bc wasn't fault  great dinner  <EOR> I came over Labor Day Weekend specifically Happy Hour heard specials bar all night  Happy Hour menu 5 $6 until 7 follow 8 $9 until 10 holiday weekend 5 $6 until 7 available until close addition regular 8 $9   quite few options both menus   Blueberry Lemon Drop French Twist Lemonade Bourbon Peach Martini   prefer drinks off earlier menu taste falls sweeter side   appetizers ordered sweet chili calamari pan crisp pork belly prime burger lobster lettuce wraps   favorite definitely burger   came side fries well worth just going burger alone   lobster lettuce wraps disappointment because weren't put together well making them hard eat because just falling apart   Service would expect Fleming's   bar quiet intimate   look forward coming back try some other menu items  <EOR> The service Fleming's impeccable  Better even some restaurants fancier pedigree fame   hostesses greet warmly relatives theirs but without false cloyingness gushing   servers greet immediately your main server right there  Ours friendly capable woman knew menu well enthusiastic food but also cared having good experience  Don't miss Fleming's cheese potatoes whatever they're called   creamed spinach top notch all sides  steak certainly cooked well high quality   blow away good but quite good  Certainly surprise comes high price   desserts the bread cake chocolate lava cake bit rich rich meal but decadent good way  But main thing come feeling going very good Steakhouse comfort Cheers where everybody knows your name  <EOR> I mind place all  Seafood tower kicks butt  forget else but good  very well many Old Fashioned cocktails which pretty much rocks glass full whiskey slice orange fool passer ers  <EOR> We ate very first time last night  few people suggested saying really good    I ordered wedge salad start very good although better    For dinner ordered dry aged New York lobster tail  ordered sautéed mushrooms green beans garlic mash potatoes sides    Everything great surprised no idea quality food very nice place    One thing need mention lobster tail sautéed mushrooms both amazing best ever both cases    The service also great  favorite things eating very nice place service did disappoint    We definitely eating again! <EOR> Where begin heard few good things Fleming's steaks decided check out  waitress greeted warmly letting now she hung over before ordered alredy off good start  surprise plates still remnants last diners chocolate lava cake it  proceeded look onto plate guessed more lava cake  Most people point would've walked but no stuck around  figured accidents happen biggest deal  waitress let know she informed manager situation manager jokingly said she would buy lava cake her  amused  alone constitutes star rating but anyone made any effort reconcile issue its waitress manager both found situation amusing   glad gentleman sitting next equally disgusted situation handled those reasons Flemings deserves zero stars  Stuff happens but don't rude it  Thanks <EOR> This favorite special occasion date night spots  wife loves seafood tower steak house  Upscale dining without being pretentious  Food consistently good service always friendly efficient  All told wonderful evening out  <EOR> I'm continually surprised ratings place    Service decent    Food average    Price high    just don't it   This review won't long enough score  epic because say word meh <EOR> Service substandard fleming's location  Wine list very good but service slow  Scalloped potatoes porcinini rubbed  fillet very good but soft fillet grainy  haven't encountered before  knock star off  char porcini sauce made steak meat itself  Something seemed wrong   The night servers dawdling around placed closed early  salamander turned off half hour before last table time  infuriates me    I don't know restaurant charge prices area away such bad service  generally happy Fleming's location think prices San Francisco Bay Area actually cheaper place   The ZD Cab excellent Italian white very good    I underwhelmed meal price point  Super high end food getting harder find quality dropping across board deal rising food costs  <EOR> We three times because love food each time service less stellar surprisingly since prices 5 star high!  must say move right!    Food awesome!!!  Kitchen strained  came Mother's Day waited 45 minutes salad  food came 20 minutes forgot mother's baked potato  Really great server but service terrible  Guessing kitchen understaffed added menu Mother's Day weren't ready that!  My brother LOVED Prime Rib! Said probably best he ever had  mashed potatoes parsley truffle divine! really enjoyed Ahi Tuna       would definitely order again   short ribs YUM!!!!  We dessert looking forward too! <EOR> How well steaks prepared friendliness bussers extensive wine list only reason why place gets 2 stars   randomly decided tonight dinner because places wanted try years based all hype created around it  Needless say very disappointing   service server Monica prime steaks   tone voice sounded very condescending she did care   Hospitality unrivaled website boasts   think she passed table 5 times before ask another fork mine missing busser clearing table before main course arrive   Normally server periodically checks patrons sure everything good if need anything else   Instead she more interested holding wall while heavily engaged conversation manager co workers several times throughout 2 hours there   Another thing which kind bothersome overheard another server give nice introduction party over special night party   None happened when Monica approached table   She just approached table asked if wanted wine   only way knew name because hosted told server would be   The other steak which wasn't prepared asked overcooked   going assume because wasn't properly communicated chefs prepared   price dining expected because so called reputation preparation steaks   However if am going pay fine dining prices steak then should accompanied fine dining service   would raised concerns manager but never opportunity meet being she table touched every table except ours   see if busy type service but wasn't even busy restaurant  <EOR> Latest experience much better!

The pork belly delicious but minimalist  came little bit looked grits something else didn't recognize   The mushroom ravioli 3 raviolis covered sauce again big dish but WOW good  best sauces tasted! must try opinion   The baked brie also delicious because perfectly cooked croissant pastry came apple pieces greens walnuts top pastry  All those flavors combined perfectly melted cheese and plenty it made incredible dish   The salt pepper shrimp also really tasty tempura light fry it  also came fried asparagus bowl    The Sam Adams pretty good fan IPA's but 6 bucks 2   I'll sure heck drink em!
