If they're not     well start opening them because you're really missing some awesome alternatives help keep planet fellow animals happy! already dreaming next meal here! <EOR> BEST VEGGIE BURGER yet!  taste traditional meat burger texture grill flavor offered several different ways   bun isn't gluten free those wondering but wrap salad   opted sweet potato fries instead side salad fries seasoned overly done     hummus bowl another hit   good creamy texture overly dry served pita bread veggies dipping topped sesame seeds  <EOR> Food delicious    wish another location near Downtown! <EOR> I am regular next door Sambalatte favorite places grab cup coffee knock ton work  downside don't many food options people vegitarian gluten feee employees told Panacea which right next door  Let tell if health conscious eater allergies restrictions aside place should try  menu looks little intimidating items wouldn't generally see typical restaurant but don't scared give try  Everything far phenomenal can't wrong anything menu! Also atmosphere perfect date lunch dinner even getting some work done your laptop! just wish more comfortable seating upstairs maybe few table games  <EOR> If you're looking nice modern spot juice maybe healthy bite eat you're area bad  good variety drinks two tried nice but definitely other juice places similar vibe bigger variety better product  <EOR> A NON BIASED REVIEW great food service first time just terrible food service second time especially Cheesecake Factory pricing  Burgers sunchoke aioli chocolate cake first visit phenomenal! Albeit $9 small dessert seemed bit pricey but understand vegan substitution mean higher cost margins  fresh spinach fettuccine second time around waste $15 complete disappointment  way undercooked sticky greasy just bland  wonder why even menu because very amateur just because pasta fresh doesn't mean good yes?! husband's side fries cold stale extra side aioli forgotten  also ordered regular black drip which cashier said off menu then served charged $6 50 small cold brew beyond bitter regular coffee let alone cold brew no cream sweetener offered either! Lastly taking plate bar asking to go box girl behind counter just handed box instead boxing actually take plate ended boxing myself over cash register while she waiting then handed plate  very awkward rude! Staff needs more training especially Thursday night staff taking orders correctly hospitality  Basically prices charge meaning sit down prices hip cafe style dining hope see great improvement service least! Deducting 1 5 stars service  5 stars pricing relation cafe dining POS says all remember receiving receipt being asked if wanted second visit   However would finish good note say burgers gourmet worth every penny just love sunchoke aioli very reasonably priced   recommendation owners add more reasonably priced light seasonal items menu sunchoke frugivores compared omnivores don't need much food feel satisfied change bistro small restaurant style dining experience waiter if least designated hospitality employee gourmet experience bit off moment   Will visit again update review if notice change service  <EOR> The best vegan burger ever eaten  ordered two different burgers shared them great other even better  YuM!
