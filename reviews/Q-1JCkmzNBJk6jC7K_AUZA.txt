Anytime would try attention seems own little worlds busy just hanging   Really good look business but guess whoever owns place doesn't seem care on   Another thing noticed subpar bar The drinks watered down overpriced might well ask non alcohol drink  I must admit hookah great but  only good thing say Hookah Masters  The place pretty big but feels freezer there  I feel bad those girls working walk around close nothing which way think tacky  You've girls walking around asses hanging wearing fishnets  Kinda whore house esque  Another thing I'd point DJs average  There's really nothing special whoever behind booth pretty much supply background music because no gets dance floor  Boring   Overall would recommend lounge anyone   The two stars great quality hookah  <EOR> My boyfriend visited lounge based reviews saw Yelp place itself okay even though outskirts strip   visited place Sunday night ordered pizza first must say unpleasant    good all no flavor  didn't eat half way when hookah ordered arrived pineapple flavor   hookah great but some hits unfortunately threw right where sat  didn't restroom sadly threw all pizza right side  recommend place but surely don't recommend pizza all  Although appreciate customer service! helped now creating big scene incident  <EOR> This place awful  customer service worst ever experienced server bartender over ten years all over Orange County   So three came smoke hookah two just hang eat    First walk single person greets us  sat ten minutes before anyone even acknowledged us    We told pay bottled water unless ordered food  Then told order two hookahs even though only three smoking  Then told order food extra hookah leave  Then she didn't even bring all drinks  Then she took food order trip time  Then she wouldn't tell flavors special hookah mixtures  Then she openly rude talked 5 years old when she brought hookah telling knock over    I'm sorry your place clearly struggling money can't find quality human beings work you    Good luck everyone decides come here  <EOR> Hated walked playing lame movie lights full blast staff slow weren't even 5 minutes before left somewhere else  <EOR> Hookah Masters Lounge say great place be  Karaoke night Tuesdays  Chicken shawarma wraps unbelievably tasty  don't forget Hookahs hookah girls  Currently smoking blackberry x raspberry x vanilla  lasts forever  Hookah  girls constantly checking making sure bowl hitting right  Thank HML making every Tuesday much fun me <EOR> $77 35 3 AYCS burger fries drink  A little pricy personally since most places $35 AYCS 3 people  The hookah girl pretty but she's very attentive we ash coals ourselves majority time seems family owned place though there's that At first obscure movie ESPN cool! heard place supposed music but unfortunately visit The lighting nice lounge big didn't sit close anyone nice They only let change shisha hour keep smoking even when started harsh we could waited but waiting 20min+ new flavor just seemed much waste Overall nice place if don't want bothered starbuzz great if attentive staff! staff really chill but don't really smile come all really kind flag them down The food good!
