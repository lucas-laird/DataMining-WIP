Let's start off least liked item ordered    truffle chips blue cheese sauce  mediocre  didn't over powering blue cheese taste however strong smell truffle oil  Also potato chips fries    Second item ordered Caesar salad  wow delicious  isn't classic Caesar salad because dressing use garlic dressing  But wow really really good  Mouth watering am typing review   romaine leaves chopped but more rustic approach  tomatoes top  few croutons top   Third item ordered spaghetti meatballs!! Holy moly!!! best spaghetti meatballs ever had  meat balls homemade  them split two man lot food! couldn't even finish it    They also give complementary bread however opted out  Didn't try dessert but am sure great since everything else fantastic  staff very friendly  Would def  come Back! Great vibe beyond delicious late night dinner  <EOR> I'm big fan place although few fixable flaws     the crabcake appetizer creole mustard sauce good worth $18 price   pizzas good but linguini clams better taste italian bacon brings flavor   lasagna very good but clog artery     Wine selection glass very small unimpressive   servers overly friendly 4 times less week same bartenders didn't seem recognize me     tip look menu nearby Joel Robuchon before looking menu prices seem reasonable comparison  <EOR> Chinois Chicken Salad O love thee  midst heavenly mustard vinaigrette rests mound hand picked vegetation poultry cashews  dramatic presentation reasonable cost dish absolutely blow your mind   The fusion two worlds into salad dish shouldn't overlooked  Roasted sesame seeds peanut oil soy sauce sesame oil Napa cabbage carrot thins snow peas   the list on  Asiatic Americana perhaps?

Pear Drop left disappointed   Having bar tended before using free pouring method bartender consistently under poured despite generous tips every round   Any martini such two ordered should fruit sweet n sour its dominant flavor   would loved give more stars but when drinks weak say?   How stick beer  Stella Newcastle draft which alone should warrant few stars! <EOR> Had mushroom ravioli some drinks  drinks ok but ravioli really greasy not cheesy weird way overpriced!! Really bad experience <EOR> After long day Vegas checked MGM Grand looking casual restaurant close eat at  Although heard Wolfgang Puck name throughout years many times never ate any restaurants any frozen meals  ordered mussels very surprised when came because 50+ mussels plate  good but great   kids Spicy Meatball Pasta it little spicy son although he does spicy foods Homemade Spaghetti daughter loved it   wife steak which good but did leave lasting impression  service great until time check when didn't see waiter 15 mins  Bottom line Wolfgang Puck Bar Grill nice casual place bite eat at MGM Grand just don't expect blown away food  3 1 2 stars  <EOR> it's 5 star restaurant don't expect 5 star service but pretty upscale  thought bit pricey bar grill ended paying well over 300 bucks no did order lobster champagne but food excellent! <EOR> This place perfect example overpriced food    You would think restaurant named recognized chef would somewhat satisfying right? Well wrong here  experience Wolfgang puck where wished shake shack down street instead wasting time money here   For all entrees menu priced 25 40 expect something would 4 star restaurant  Unfortunately flavorless food dry underwhelming all aspects  feel whoever cooking food just puts grill wishes best  no seasoning food all  food putting mouth large solid nothing water more flavor food water only lemon it    I am no attempt trying bash place all but if presented fine dining restaurant then serve food one  <EOR> Wolfgang doesn't disappoint  Another plus close really late basically only place MGM open past 2 am  Really great those late vegas nights late munchies    Stayed MGM conference kind didn't want far  place good  lunch event food decent  late night came back spaghetti meatballs which good  meatballs huge!

Sparkles? I'd another  More please    All all wait wasn't long  take reservations  If theory don't want wait    Our waiter okay  Pretty attentive  But   occasionally chase down  all good though  <EOR> Brought 30 people last night staff fantastic booking private space gave great service  Everyone enjoyed appetizers main courses desserts cocktails  I'd highly recommend restaurant large groups coming Las Vegas! <EOR> Tonight seeing KA MGM  Last night disappointing dinner Mercato Della Pescheria Venetian see review   Tonight visited Wolfgang Pucks Bar Grill across KA theater  difference  Excellent food Best damn chicken wings ever had! Chinoise salad delicious  Wife linguini clams  Pasta cooked perfectly  even brought little clam fork  Service outstanding waitress Natalie training always attentive friendly but imposing just right always checking us other team members made sure water glasses always full bread available dishes taken away promptly  Those guys Mercato very big shoes fill former Puck space hit mark  <EOR> You know restaurants see airports? ones seem refuge comfort when you're hungry but know your heart they're just all great? Sometimes they're really pleasant appearing but undoubtedly still become aware fact you're airport    That's feel Wolfgang Puck  would choice last dinner Vegas but great albeit long concert MGM garden arena going take nearest restaurant available sheer exhaustion    The menu covers basics you'd expect bar grill type serve pizzas pastas burgers salads etc  Extensive alcohol nonetheless but where Vegas automatically assumed?  I really hard time deciding rate restaurant  food pretty good first admit  spaghetti meatballs those balls fire  Very light but exceptional flavorful    But just doesn't cut Vegas  When want something  gonna eyes pop skull  Something over top elicits those uncontrollable sounds throws food passion  something  pretty good large price tag slapped due name location  taco trucks side road more excitement    I don't know guess partially fault  should known better should maybe looked harder  guess whole establishment just struck boring  There's nothing inherently wrong any means just think price point plethora better options your finger tips  Seems most people enjoyed meal take will  <EOR> It's inside MGM gotta good right? Nope  Wolfgang let down big time  Flavors reminded more Arby's rather high quality cafe  ruben tasted sloppy joe salad pathetic  Greens oil them? Come on? some texture? tomato? carrot? cucumber? nuts? anything? You're cheap Wolfgang   Service fine though  <EOR> EXPENSIVE! Ok honestly am huge fan Wolfgang Pucks cuisine but since place seems only option open 11pm MGM Grand forced eat twice   I chicken soup Greek Salad first time  Both very small mediocre flavor  $10 cup soup should size head  Its just chicken soup   The second time Chinouis salad which Wolfgangs famous chinese chicken salad delicous  pizza eh    The service good first time terrible second time  Please dont special trip just eat but prepared some serious prices if hungry 11pm dont want leave MGM  <EOR> I staying MGM some friends looking nice sit down restaurant wasn't expensive  spotted Wolfgang Puck knew he prestigious chef but almost swayed away fancy looking decor because thought everything would overpriced   We checked menu outside saw everything pretty reasonable $15 $30 most dishes   hard decide order because everything sounded good!  I bite everyone's food loved every single dish table! I'd say favorite everything tasted BLT because bacon wasn't your ordinary bacon thick slices pork belly glazed perfection friend kept saying!  I ordered Ham Turkey Club which know sounds boring haha but good! PILED meat third slice bread middle probably keep all ham turkey sliding around  bread crispy portion huge! cut sandwich into four sections only ate two took rest back hotel   My friend's pizza also delicious! believe Prosciutto Goat Cheese Pizza Prosciutto Kalamata Olives Oven Dried Tomatoes Basil Pesto Goat Cheese   I highly recommend going Wolfgang Puck! prices aren't outrageous considering Vegas food superb  <EOR> Had lunch here   It's beautiful restaurant opens casino   Chinois Chicken Salad many times before   good medley greens topped crispy wonton strips candied peanuts   wish dressing bit more flavorful but overall good salad lots moist chicken!  BLT husband order because menu described pork belly   It looked scrumptuous thick bacon arugula tomatoes between two grilled pieces sourdough   IMO sandwich decent but could tasted WAY better if some sort maple glaze smokiness bacon   tasted rather bland     side pasta salad delicious tho!  tossed salume feta chesses some veggies   Oh appetizer calamari pretty good   arrived looking little undercooked but did rather nice crunch it   aoili dipping sauce wonderful accomaniment calamari!  Prices decent think good spot lunch especially if you're convention      Well really no other choice because all other places open only dinner   Guess I'd back but only if other choice   Or someone else's dime = <EOR> Came couple nights ago because mom town staying MGM Grand did want another property arriving  originally suggested try Pub 1842 but decided eat upon suggestion friend she came with   The menu choices okay but great opinion  mostly pizza pasta couple other choice such burger steak  try stay away foods containing gluten weren't much options chose didn't want pay much steak  I ended getting Heirloom Tomato Caprese appetizer menu $17  good but don't think really worth $17 hungry few hours later  It wasn't bad but wasn't great  I think would rather somewhere else  My mom friend burger she said pretty good  <EOR> This Wolfgang Puck restaurant very pleasant     My ROI above average most part   food excellent   But anything else Vegas    very expensive      <EOR> I came vacation bunch friends away decided Wolfgang Puck's Bar Grill  Unfortunately friends sick flu trip he wasn't able eat most foods  restaurant fortunate enough Bradford waiter  casually talking told friend sick he decided give chicken broth help flu  Bradford thoughtful caring! sure come back hope Bradford waiter again  <EOR> Stayed Vegas ten day vacation ended eating twice here    best meal options MGM since really good food without having wait long   stuck restaurant service   Everyone worked superb did   first time going ordered mushroom ravioli which superb  good experience night seemingly shared everyone else party   second night still great experience however couple downsides   ordered gnocchi told I'd probably want order something else because enough food despite being $30    Another person table told burger would take approximately 35 40 minutes if wanted cooked medium which seemed bit outrageous    food received night again very good   elected salad gnocchi which tiny big shout waiter being honest    friend elected burger but enjoyed soup salad well   bread bring before your meal great too   Overall factoring price taste service overall experience I'd rate restaurant Wolfgang Puck's 4 5  <EOR> Food really good  wings salad mashroom pizza  Wings pizza good  place shoul 2 5 3 stars  <EOR> Ordered prosciutto pizza extremely salty   mesquite grilled steak skewers overcooked hard chew  Very disappointed    place cheap    higher expectations any other smaller places around it  <EOR> Came back Wolfgang Puck Bar Grill 3 years   still worth it!

Vegas! Ok bring two four plates food then drinks then other two plates over 8 9 minute stretch  Frustrating!   My mushroom raviolis good $25 00 friends gnocchi soft mushy  Spaghetti s fine    Manager happens stop table asks things are  decided tell bad experience having  He apologetic said he would better  He asked if needed more drinks kind pushed all another  said ok  if he going buy round troubles The waitress never came back he served rest meal    Bill comes he did comp even thing  He acted if he going then nothing  Whenever manager gets involved usually least think comped  actually shocking  explained business she ruined whole vibe   anyways  then said disappointed whole night especially bill when he pushed drinks then didn't even comp them  He said he took waitress equation thought enough  didn't leave penny tip definitely back next time Vegas!   Go Asian Express food court tasty cheaper food! <EOR> I highly surprised good Wolfgang Puck's Bar Grill was   much came 3 times 5 day 4 night stay   Obviously little pricier side because Wolfgang Puck but thought flavors super good consistent   definitely paid quality taste   Actually portion sizes generous well   The first time friend ordered Pork Belly BLT Garlic Chili Glazed Wings   Holy hell   Both really good   BLT delicious especially use arugula instead typical lettuce pork belly very flavorful   Even though good still felt lacking something   Maybe stronger sauce more pork belly?  sure   But pasta came lackluster next time would ask them sub fries something   barely touched better save calories more tequila As garlic chili wings really yummy good sized wings   liked flavor them   much ordered them again night Tabu Lounge   friends different salad each time she she really enjoyed them   favorite Caesar salad no white anchovies   cheese accompanied potent but such good way P  able split salad three ways no problem I can't say anything drinks since didn't order any but service very good consistently refilled water glasses   guess know drunkies dehydrated P  would definitely come back try some other fare menu  <EOR> Overpriced taste!

The server raving pastas special lobster ravioli wife ordered grilled salmon roasted corn salad   Sounds great right?  Well much   lobster ravioli actually three 3! cheese ravioli served bland lobster sauce chewy bits spiny lobster langouste actually much crawfish lobster    ravioli chewy not al dente langouste rubbery sauce little no lobster taste     Three ravioli $36 $12 apiece undercooked cheese ravioli chewy rock lobster bits   waited long food show would sent back   The salmon small but well cooked   Flavor pretty good but corn salad accompaniment nothing special   Cost $33   The basket breads good seasonal soup chicken tortilla really well prepared only item worth price $12    Two half star food four star prices   Rated R Ripoff    So would eat breakfast lunch  If insist eating dinner order lunch burgers truffle potato chips etc   Avoid pastas wary specials   <EOR> Another decent choice when don't feel driving neighborhoods bite   your comps ready!  I ordered prime burger decent deal $18 which includes fries!  Temperature perfect medium good quality juicy beef heard prime rib    Nothing complain here  <EOR> During two half Vegas trip boyfriend places passed tried Tuesday night   We asked hostess favorites currently which chicken wings chicken milanese  ordered pepperoni pizza   The wings $16 which little expensive but tasted amazing  lightly sweet Latin fish sauce chilies which brought entire dish together   5 5  However only thing meal good   The pizza came when tried taking bite toppings cheese all just slid off  Granted hot but prefer eating pizza fork knife  3 5  The chicken milanese overcooked dry  chicken milanese before flavorful  WPB lacking seasoning flavor tenderness  salad top overdressed overly salty  did try together did me  feeling instead being pan fried deep fried dryness it  1 5  We didn't order cocktails places more reasonable prices  mean $17 muscow mule which is vodka ginger beer little lime  just whiskey down amazing whisky price   I would say wings maybe some fries then worth price quality food  <EOR> the staff very accommodating made reservations party 16 service amazing    food though? disappointing    i tried some friend's truffle chips good! chips perfectly fried truffle oil cheese complemented potatos chips very well   i also few bites friends mac cheese delicious! no crispy top layer but cheesy subtle   three people side table ordered linguine clams dish and   it terrible  basically linguine clams some chili flakes pancetta  just reading off menu all sold   but then disappointed  barely put dent into meal because EXTREMELY SALTY  pretty sure blood pressure rose each bite  thought just mine but others agreed salty side unfortunately think salt tolerance lower theirs really wasn't edible  thought saying something but didn't want difficult    pasta salty sure pancetta bacon!!!! didn't help  didn't taste heat chili pepper either  pretty disappointed pay nearly $30 dish  didn't even bother taking go    TIP SHARE!!!!!! really wish looked other people's dishes would've realized each dish hefty portion  think assumed it'd those other expensive places charge $$ tiny portion but place gives good amount  i'd highly recommend sharing   !!

In nutshell place good  Go  <EOR> Such lovely experience  weekend really subpar Vegas meals welcome change pace  While food delicious service really made stand out  friend each ordered flat iron steak bf's ordered halibut  also ordered tuna tartar calamari apps  calamari brought when notified waiter bent over backwards it  offered delicious dessert free  steak perfectly cooked seasoned halibut very tasty well  waiter Robert really made nice experience us  <EOR> This place okay   it's great bad   staying MGM bachelorette party convenient   wouldn't way dine here    Of course being bachelorette party came late night   Truffled Potato chips good crispy fried calamari   Nothing WOW but actually pretty good drunk food   Add glass wine more drunkedness = good sleep  <EOR> Sat bar    Food yummy! Drinks refreshing! Service excellent  Atmosphere little loud though <EOR> FYI thread referring Wolfgang Puck Bar Grill  restaurant open platform across Cirque Du Soleil Ka theater serves decent pasta also offers meat burgers dishes seafood dishes assorted appetizers    Came around dinner seated water glasses filled drink orders taken almost immediately  unlimited complimentary bread which delicious! Majority menu spaghetti pizza meat burger fish steak   all ordered different type spaghetti  I'd highly recommend linguini Manila Clams Garlic Pancetta Chili Wild Oregano because all four dishes best  friend did add lemon give little kick   We ordered two marinara sauces Housemade spaghetti spaghetti meatballs  They're your generic spaghetti basil tomatoes garlic only differences type tomatoes meatballs did not  Both dishes salty drank three giant gulps water per spaghetti bite  normally LOVE salt BUT pee crazy pregnant woman afterwards  o___o much salt!  The last dish ordered Wild Mushroom Agnolotti Sweet Peas Caramelized Shallots Parmesan  pretty good if more dough y lightly sauced pasta  personally did felt could more flavorful but each own  Also don't put salt pepper shakers table arrogant? doing classy look? did offer parmesan even though offered table next parmesan  hmm why?    Overall food 3 5  Service 3 5 5  <EOR> When hanging MGM deciding amongst all overpriced options nice lunch low key dinner think place stands above rest  Prices *fair* food very good  enjoyed paninis particularly steak well pizzas  Service always least decent  place middle MGM lacks *ambience* but easy lunch dinner won't break bank place great  <EOR> I ordered salmon dish asparagus other vegetables  nothing wrong quality food but literally took 30 seconds eat because portion size small  really spending $26 dish doesn't come close filling up  eat somewhere else afterwards since still hungry  <EOR> Love pizza great desserts decent wait staff  Its little loud but seated right middle MGM casino guess best expect scenario  always point coming restaurant when stay MGM  always busy because good  <EOR> You decent meal here  Nothing stellar mind you  feels pseudo gourmet cuisine  <EOR> Went seeing cirque du soliel mgm  Pretty good food  Steak delicious but nowhere near best  would rather hit another steakhouse since there's many options Vegas  Hubby liked lobster pasta Mac cheese good too  Service good place nice fancy ish which prices reflect  Overall good meal but far better options Vegas! <EOR> I've MGM Las Vegas visitor since 1998 Wolfgang Puck restaurant located MGM grand amazing! price point spot food delicious! waiter Jeremy amazing he sound radio personality lol beyond tour duty lunch experience great!

<EOR> This place bit expensive but all entrees great  try rare tuna  Unfortunately waiter horrible  waiting nearly hour check refill managed track down chatting table friends  Hey understand he trying hard date but expense blowing off rest tables  rest MGM Grand place lacks customer service  <EOR> My FAVORITE restaurant tried during trip here    My boyfriend came Thursday night dinner before seeing KA located right across hallway   no wait table setting very nice  wore leggings felt very underdressed but place    Service wonderful food excellent  ordered spaghetti meatballs boyfriend linguine shrimp  Everything perfect probably best pasta ever had    Drinks very good super happy finally Moscow Mule copper mug! Everywhere ordered never copper mug but Wolfgang Puck didn't disappoint  boyfriend ordered Manhattan perfect  lot other bars tend use cherries tons ice instead orange peel just block ice but bartender did right way here    I would highly recommend place anyone  think beats long buffet line unsanitary people grabbing food hands hot tray any day  <EOR> Sometimes simple things   wander miles Strip need sit down want pleasant one    recent Saturday afternoon before big fight   they busy!

A bit pricey side but which nice restaurant isn't Vegas   least wont disappointed food here  <EOR> Besides getting amazing service food absolutely delicious   loved location very large comfortable chairs    Highly recommend   Even thought wait long only waited 5 minutes   complaining! <EOR> Really disappointed when came here  chose because MyVegas reward  ambiance strange high end restaurant  nice open but when you're paying much food expect something little nicer  friend tomato mozzarella salad really good but price really worth it  margarita pizza very disappointed  assumed based every margarita pizza I'd ever before would fresh tomatoes but only marinara mozzarella basil really just cheese pizza basil  food ok but price I'd somewhere else  <EOR> Truffle Potato chips w blue cheese ROCK!  OMG    OMG    OMG   DIE FOR! Salmon delish   Meatloaf killer w mushrooms pancetta     Expensive?  Vegas Wolfgang Puck    worth it   HELL YESSSS!!!     I eat hear again no doubt   LOVE IT! <EOR> my wife dinner  wrong food! its very tasty  very nice waiter but food expensive  if date celebrating occasion good place  <EOR> It's long time since super pushy ungenuine waitress Kristin fully fit bill  Seriously we're still talking weird experience here   Maybe wait staff told customers them spend lots money them fast possible   We came late meal 10pm  plenty seats    When ordered just two appetizers Kristin pressed very hungry? Maybe two could split salad too  Umm no thanks  know hungry are    Making review two stars because least food good  wings solid though best LV crab cakes moist  But way over priced size which basically 4 mini bites  Thank goodness hard bread eat   More 3x did someone come try take plates before done  Kristin quickly put down bill said There's no rush smiled quickly but quick see scowl    Maybe she having bad day but little attitude long way  meal memorable good reason  <EOR>
