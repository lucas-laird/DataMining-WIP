coming favorite restaurants Las Vegas  several times now each time tried something different  always surprised  sure reservation because place usually packed  shrimp tamales great  <EOR> http thesoloreviewer blogspot com Ok anyone read last review Bobby Flays Mesa Grill knows much loved raved lunch made respect Mr  Flay lot  Now feelings changed  recent Michelin Star lose see no future regain star unless things greatly approve    I seated within 5 minutes arrival lunch which seemed pretty packed house  Now when restaurant expect bread basket within 5 10 minutes once seated  seated 10 minutes when placed order 5 minutes later brought bread  But enough that  course oh good corn bread muffin which still day favorite corn bread being southern around ! tempting order favorite dish Tiger Shrimp Tamale but wanted try something new  Yucatan Chicken Tacos grilled Onions Peanut Smoked Chile Barbeque sauce  Once arrived kinda put off basically tacos yourself  Now far lazy but when somewhere eat don't want put together own food because well relax put trust Chefs  But aside flavors very bold together perfect  Peanut Smoked Chile Barbeque sauce very nice smokey taste good kick which EXACTLY kinda flavor like  chicken very fatty which wouldn't expect EX Michelin star restaurant but guess thats where EX comes into play  Overall dish good but MUCH better local mexican restaurant down street which pretty sad   Overall lunch nothing first  service very decent besides bread arrival  While left excited couldn't wait back first time time around find myself only going back if someone else paying  <EOR> This awesome restaurant great food ambiance knowledgable staff  salmon dinner shrimp appetizer   Presentation mind blowing flavors food unbelievable  husband visiting Vegas 3 nights restaurant created memories us   Awesome awesome place eat  <EOR> I restaurant several times Bahamas location always far best restaurant to    Vegas past weekend 5 girlfriends girls weekend away   convinced them dinner because amazing   ended leaving quite disappointed still bummed think experience    First off appetizers took long time come but just figured oh well enjoyed them immensely    Next came main courses    3 6 dishes came 2 filets 1 salmon barely warm   kindly told server she took them back brought new hot plates   paying plenty money food come hot    manager came over midst gave good fake sorry yada yada yada He came off he just going thru motions could care less issues   Again just blew off eating newly delicious hot meals    3 4 way thru noticed looked dark black hair inch inch 1 2 long middle sauce mushrooms over filet   instantly made stomach turn done    All SIX done point    server come back over she took plate without saying much    She came back 10 minutes later giving bill saying manager took off 2 plates back investigated hair thought bristle brush used kitchen   Almost trying justify problem   15 minutes passed since finding hair manager FINALLY walks over again says sorry good night    2 girls servers many years said he incredibly unprofessional all blown away manager handled situation    definitely fell younger side crowd feeling he just kind disregarded since just younger maybe he thought just looking trouble   really sure   all dressed looked classy nice dinner out    all grew going nice restaurants know expect    Overall food amazing but manager handled situation made experience extremely distasteful  <EOR> Came lunch first day Vegas  Service great food drinks came quickly  place closing soon mostly empty    We some great Partido margaritas  a little sweet side but still delicious   They bring assortment bread instead chips  cornbread muffins jalapeño cheese bread raisin bread    For food shrimp tacos  comes six smoked shrimp two tortillas some small sides mango salsa salsa verde so good guacamole  portion size seemed bit off price $25  complaining though because good  also ordered pork tenderloin sandwich fries  tasty sizable but nothing write home about   Overall happy selections would return but some items bit pricy  <EOR> weapon choice     GRILLED MAHI MAHI Roasted Pineapple Cascabel Chile Sauce + Caramelized Pineapple Green Onion Salsa <EOR> The place packed good reason   take back all snide remarks made wife Bobby Burrito Flay    man kitchen Bobby Flay both excellent chefs meal testiment honed skill presenting wide span flavors food     My meal consisted meatless items menu loved them all   wife pork stole some cooked perfectly     We did wait 10 minutes past reservation time but wasn't problem   place popular people take time enjoying food don't wig out   take your time wait your table because it'll great meal experience  <EOR> By far worst meal Vegas   When arrived place reservation person no answered phone ignored several minutes two hosts having personal conversation   Our waiter took rude whole new level  He didn't even acknowledge wife close ten minutes speaking solely making eye contact only me  He actually dropped game face before eyesight leaving table rolled eyes   The meal started off well decent margaritas although bar only accepts cash room charges   meal then quickly deteriorated  enjoying some good bread muffin one muffin two people chicken quesadilla appetizer which tasty but overly salty  ordered lamb medium rare came raw purple  wife ordered sixteen spice chicken which sickly sweet  Tried cioppino   it edible best  Overly fishy smelling general mussels certainly past prime  Overall food overly sweet generally bad   If want experience good $100 plus meal vegas don't eat here  much better places worth your time money  recommend B B Ristorante Venetian  <EOR> WOW   Mesa Grill now become must place whenever visit Las Vegas  dinner Sunday 7pm   service great impressed all servers assisting table knew food allergies mentioned only server   Very attentive   I Fire roasted Veal chop   fantastic highly recommend ordering it   also soup I can't recall name but seafood chowder great  <EOR> overly priced menu  expect Las Vegas strip  aggressive service staff lacked tact food service basics such server displayed appetizer menu 4 times once beginning drink selection another time when serviced drinks then again while made meal choices yet again while eating brought cold refrigerated butter ripped through warm fresh great tasting bread  <EOR> One favorite restaurants ever !!!!!!!!!! wife location Bahamas always something new delicious  SOUTHWESTERN SPICE CHICKEN SKEWERS great flavorfull MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN wife ANCHO CHILE HONEY GLAZED SALMON both dishes where GREAT wished would remember waitress name she great all know she Argentina she recommended really great tasting Sauvignon Blanc  Cant

  ordered two burgers Mesa Burger myself husband ordered Green Chile Cheese Burger $16 each      Then waited    waited    waited   waiter apologized delay    waited some more   Finally asked speak manager   time manager came received food 55 minutes later two burgers   husband explained situation   manager very nice apologized told would no charge burgers    The food great   fries absolutely perfect maybe best ever had   only complaint burger big could hardly fit mouth   enjoyed food much took chance ordering dessert hoped wouldn't take long entrees did   ordered Chocolate Pretzel Tart  Spicy Peanut Butter Chocolate Swirl Ice Cream   amazing   usually into spicy food but somehow spicy ice cream perfect compliment tart   most interesting desserts ever had     When asked waiter check he told meal house entrees dessert drinks everything he hoped would come back   gave very nice tip I don't think food delay fault all    top off manager approached again way apologized service he invited come back again   At time wait food really really frustrating but very satisfied manner which manager server handled situation food delicious   We'll definitely return again  <EOR> Oh Mesa

Started tiger shrimp tamale pork tenderloin  side brussel sprouts  Definitely return  Also great location  if attending show coliseum  <EOR> Service always great  eat probably 3 4 times year  menu something everyone  prices higher end but feel worth it  food especially different sauces very tasty   This week enjoyed food much did service waitress Brenda super attentive all around excellent  <EOR> We tried Mesa Grill lunch weekday  only few groups dining seated quickly  server knew menu well recommendations service very good   We both Mesa burger fries  burger itself cooked perfectly  did care horseradish mustard came overly spicy  burger very large little awkward eat  Even cut half hard bite into without everything falling out  average burger  did care fries all   spicy little kick them which really enjoyed but fries very crispy soft all  only few them more eating potato chips   Overall service good but food nothing special  Being big fan Bobby Flay's heard speak restaurant many times excited but won't back  <EOR> I filet mignon which tasty but could more flavorful  menu described coffee rubbed only thing think would taste worse coffee filet ruined being rubbed it  chef accomodating made filet without coffee rub me  assumed would add some other delicious spices maybe sauce take place rub but very basic just tad dry   good? Yes  better? Yes  advice would look menu advance sure selections appeal since Tex Mex Mexican kind place  All all decent meal good service  <EOR> OK overrated!!! Bobby Flay more fame culinary abilities!  Nothing tried memorable    Service friendly yet nothing remember  The decor fun location great  For money spent think many much better places Vegas here   think back  Good luck Bobby! <EOR> We party three ordered all appetizers  all very good   3 goat cheese fondue world   best waiter trip   chocolate tart spicy chocolate ice cream beyond any previous thrill  <EOR> I must preface review fact am huge fan spicy food  that being said love Mexican flavor profiles   ordered Crimini Mushroom Quesadilla  which outstanding!  Delicious fried egg top just pushed over top     Main dish world famous pork tenderloin   Unfortunately spicy crusted outer layer way spicy  brought tears   slicing off crust tenderloin tender but flavorless   sauces delightful   tamale accompanying tenderloin medallions delicious   My friend lamb chops    chops lot gristle hard good bite   Again spice also heavy liking   We shared spicy sweet potatoes  which layer upon layer upon layer thinly sliced potatoes just right amount heat   Service excellent  we arrived 6 00 pm Sunday night   highly recommend white peach margarita  two helped fend off heat!    I probably return due hot spice  but enjoyable experience great presentation  <EOR> Sunday brunch great! husband pork sandwich which perfectly balanced all flabors  spicy chicken sweet potato hash moderate spice great brunch dish  both enjoyed meals but noticed other tables offer daily special weren't worng meals weere brought initially but quickly fixed    otherwise good service! <EOR> Average review average food  looking forward eating Mesa Grill because Bobby Flay  Quite let down  husband burger egg dish  Both average best  Service also closer below average  two party table 10 seated next ordered  received food prior staff all over them much  food lukewarm  did send fries back but just ate other food  cross Bobby Flay restaurants off list  High price average food  <EOR> i wen't Mesa Grill  lunch earlier year excited blue corn pancake did sauce  then steak sandwich very good also unique  because only served  way  medium rare room temperature desert flan  good any flan before service fine  don't going same restaurant twice because many big restaurant  but just  might come back day  <EOR> Always favorite but tonight!

Unschlüssig wir wählen sollten ein Roter sollte es sein ließen wir uns beraten  Drei Angebote blieben dann letztendlich im Raum stehen und wir wählten den Zenith 2010 aus Oregon  Wir bezeichnen uns durchaus als Rotwein Kenner hatten aber noch nie gehört dass es Weine aus Oregon gibt  Das Servieren wurde zelebriert und schon der erste Degustations Schluck ließ die Augen rollen  Köstlich! Und noch spannender wurde es als wir Ruhe das rückwärtige Etikett auf der Flasche lasen Es wurde exakt der Tag genannt dem die Trauben für diesen Wein geerntet gepflückt wurden dann auch der Tag wann sie Eichholzfässer kamen und schlussendlich der Kalendertag als die Abfüllung Flaschen stattfand  Selbstverständlich trägt jede Flasche eine Nummer und ist somit individualisiert  Diese Flasche war nicht mehr nur ein Glasbehälter für Wein sondern mutierte für uns zum liebevollen Leben  Was haben wir eigentlich diesen Tagen gemacht stellten wir uns die Frage  Leider hatten wir keine Kalender mit um sie zu beantworten  Der Preis Erschwingliche $ 80 ++  Und damit nur im mittleren Preissegment der Weinkarte  Wir konnten uns nicht vorstellen welchen Mehrgenuss die angebotenen Weine für mehrere hundert Dollar Flasche bringen sollten   Fazit Der Abend hat uns rund $ 200 für zwei Personen gekostet  Wir haben es uns gegönnt und waren sehr zufrieden  Wir verstehen jetzt warum das Mesa Grill einen exzellenten Ruf hat New York eh aber seit vielen Jahren auch Las Vegas  Ein Top Platz für einen besonderen Abend  Fünf Sterne  <EOR> This place permanent fave Vegas! always order cheese fundido chicken taco appetizers both incredible  main course opted 16 spice chicken chile relleno  chicken fantastic although pesto potatoes real star but relleno eh  better local taco stand  churros dessert delicate anise flavor just right  should noted typically avoid flavor but churros worked  If looking best dang margarita ever then order signature marg Mesa    one ya going  We agreed might best just order appetizers next time but way coming back!

Plain bad  Every dish ordered saturated strong sauce rendering actual food duck calamari chicken tasteless  diners right overheard voicing same complaint  husband Jon's Venison overcooked dry  He complained received coconut layer cake free charge dessert  Ironically cake reason booked dinner restaurant first place dry disappointing  much prefer European way where restaurant chef chef actually kitchen overseeing cooking being active part  Bobby Flay owns operates restaurant  Sure he probably cooks also time time  But given all know he does Food Network Cookbooks other restaurants    he's business man chef  food reflected that  <EOR> Smoked chicken black bean quesadilla dinner menu delicious  honey salmon lunch menu impressive  <EOR> This surprisingly good dinner budget breaker either!   I give 4 stars excellent friendly wait service yummy food beautiful decor overall experience   We cremini mushroom quesadilla appetizer   it delicious! never quesadillas these   a twist traditional but good!  The ancho glazed chile salmon good   not great but total letdown either  Hubby cornmeal crusted chile relleno   he wasn't much fan but thought scrumptious! also side spicy sweet potato gratin   neither really although may personal taste thing   Overall definite recommend   the quesadilla highlight us! <EOR> I agree lot other reviews  LOVE Bobby Flay TV personality really excited try restaurant  food really good but price point   I wasn't really wow'd general  However corn tamales served shrimp appetizer veal chop excellent  If southwestern style food love food worth going if love Bobby much do! <EOR> I know should expect spend lot money Vegas but better food better prices better service elsewhere    4 ladies ordered 4 drinks which came food 3 appetizers didn't tuna quesadilla duck only saving grace total $115 <EOR> Wasn't bad but nothing jumps me  Actually can't believe but sent scallop salad plate back Bobby Flay's restaurant! scallops grit them  Thought might heavy pepper seasoning cut edges off no luck still grit  something would expect such restaurant  rest salad scrumptious  friend green chili burger fries  Burger cooked well but little boring no sauce whatsoever burger accompanying fries  The server noticed didn't eat did best rectify situation which appreciated  Also service quick friendly  So decent place but prob won't back  <EOR> Just principle won't reservation restaurant where guarantee credit card   if don't cancel within 4 hours your reservation time charged $50 per head   Sorry Bobby much wanting taste your food ain't happening   missed party 5 but probably don't need money anyway! <EOR> Let state first hots Bobby Flay long long time  came Vegas honeymoon husband knew Bobby Flay eatery    What friggin bust!  First off giddy school girl inside came right asked if Mr Flay obviously knowing 99 9% chance he wasn't he wasn't  host came right asked Why he full himself such dick Yikes someone yelled saw something TV doesn't show  If your staff talking then  problem   So sit don't see anything really want eat  apps  The waiter glared ignored probably because weren't middle age upper white class  20s tattooed middle class    sue me! he finally comes over cheddar biscuits pretty good   We duck tamales something that    lets just say right through sick last 2 days trip   So Bobby Flay Your staff called dick Your staff just pretentious you Your food wasn't good possibly gave food poisoning  And met year later book signing all came together just fantasy seemingly nice guy TV but think you're host Vegas said best      Will never back  <EOR> Great Service! Everything delicious     portions just right! shrimp tamale amazing shrimp  perfect flavor! <EOR> Service perfect  If your meats straight off grill piping hot  place you  chefs let meat rest serve less warm  don't particularly this  pork tenderloin almost room temperature  very flavorful sauce great but gross pork aftertaste  tamales hit miss sometimes moist other times dry   Newbies should try it  Blue corn pancake okay  breads aren't great  Margaritas average  <EOR> This restaurant delicious!!!

Well dishes excellent but sister ordered grilled chicken brother ordered veal chop   Being food curious family shared food   grilled chicken just ok   Think properly grilled piece chicken some fancy buffalo wing sauce   veal chop recommended cooked medium that   Well may medium tip edge but raw bone     Looking back waiter did say excellent choice when ordered lamb chops   suppose means other items ordered good choice  <EOR> Everything expected more Bobby Flay's restaurant  surprised casual saw many people decked jeans t shirt  But hey right sports book area Caesar's Palace    Tiger shrimp garlic roasted tamale extremely tasty  Might liked better entree  salmon wife tuna steak  Both very good  salmon fantastic crust semi sweet ancho chile sauce  jealous wife's tuna steak  prepared rare sashimi grade course bangin!

New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which very rich but also very delicious  Everything top notch which why keep going back    This restaurant 5 star quality but necessarily 5 star budget  Lunch less expensive dinner understandably more  Entree's run anywhere $15 $50 depending when get  If want cheaper definitely lunch  If want fancy easily run tab over $150 two people appetizers drinks dessert etc  Basically trying say eat budget don't let menu intimidate you  When salmon tiger shrimp lunch fiance usually slide around $50 tax tip included which basically just expensive buying ribs Applebee's   The only critique would place sometimes sit little close your neighbors  But food good enough knock down star    *SIDE NOTE * remember eating Bobby Flay's food Food Network experience your taste buds  must eat all things your plate TOGETHER  all different sauces blending flavors  Especially when ate pork very rich but when added together other things plate totally mellowed some flavors added something new! flavor epiphany  <EOR> Food decent but way overpriced   felt trying hard   hubby wanted lamb but soon he ordered ran out   he 22 Oz steak huge good spice it   ordered Tina steak seasoned well but cold which made taste off  <EOR> had pork tenderloin which fab    friend's filet mignon better because spice but much spice  she also sauteed spinach which bland  side chose chile relleno which ok  bobby flay?

The decor upscale approachable   could wear nice jeans nice shirt feel comfortable here   only wish right casino   Although restaurant beautifully decorated nice details if look  beyond glass windows could see betting monitors   Mesa Grill needs better location   maybe Forum near Spago's where view much nicer    My friend started Blue Corn Lobster Tacos appetizer    order gives three mini tacos but wow!  Those little guys packed flavor!!  could eat 20 those!  price though   Haha   We each ordered entree splitted them   Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon spectacular   cooked perfectly melt your mouth tender full depth coffee rub   mushroom ancho chili sauce perfect rustic accompaniment its rich deep flavors   My friend's entree New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin world!  never eaten pork tenderloin that   still pretty pink but trusted Bobby Flay knew he doing wouldn't give salmonella   Well glad because pork tender filet mignon   seriously could tell difference tenderness between too   For dessert shared Chocolate Pretzel Tart   best part dessert spicy peanut butter ice cream came it   heat smack face type heat but rather slow warm heat back your throat   tart pretzel cylinder pool chocolate sauce   moat tasted flourless chocolate cake   Delicious!    Overall really liked Bobby  Flay's command spices   If something described spicy always deliberately controlled amount spiciness just slowly warmed back your throat lingered   beautiful orchestration flavors blending into perfect symphony    Truly amazing  <EOR> Everything would expect Bobby Flay The 16 Spice chicken best chicken ever vealchop wonderful well   Great service   restaurant noisy packed 6p reservation taking walk ins Tuesday night    reservations definite must   margarita wonderful well  many tequila choices! <EOR> I party 3 lunch  did allow hats dining area but allowed small bar  Highly recommend roasted corn soup appetizer   amazingly delicious come expect Bobby Flay spicy flair  Just right amount heat zest lightness     For entrée chose New Mexican Spiced Tenderloin Sandwich   sadly underwhelming   Thin slices pork crazy pork flavor   Dessert shared nice big piece coconut cake  big coconut type person but dessert amazing  Great deep rich flavors  <EOR> I hate Bobby flay  hate show! screw throw downs!

Try burger tell different  <EOR> I came sister while whirlwind trip Vegas am glad where decided dinner    Both she feeling rich starving because opted order slew appetizers few side orders addition many partida margaritas  Phenomenal margaritas way nicely balanced no sickeningly sweet cloying mix taste $12 pop better good! Everything ordered blue corn pancake w duck tuna nachos queso fundido chile relleno mashed potatoes queso sauce freaking delish  personal favorite blue corn pancake because duck perfect tender smokey sweet without even hint gamey ness  also very surprised good chile relleno thick hard cornmeal crust bean rice mash middle  your average deep fried cheese stuffed pepper    And yes all ordered dessert  coconut cake ridiculous  mean seriously good waiter literally pry off would show time  Each layer soaked some sort coconut cream concoction every bite full toasted coconut flakes gooey cake icing  kept thinking all night  still thinking it!   This definitely luxurious treat I'd highly recommend anyone else looking nice dinner while Vegas  <EOR> I'm Bobby Flay fan finally chance try Mesa Grill most recent Vegas trip   originally tried walk dinner Friday night but told booked night   restaurant almost completely empty didn't really understand   returned again next day try brunch   The brunch menu didn't seem very appealing but starving didn't want searching something else   start ordered hash brown quesadilla   thought amazingly delicious   bacon nice smokey flavor fried egg just added flavor   For entrees scrambled eggs chilaquile sweet potato hash mesa burger steak eggs   steak eggs served tortillas where build your own mini breakfast burrito   steak cooked beautifully right amount pink   Chilaquile served blue corn tortilla creme fraiche   blue corn nice bold flavor whole dish meshed very well together   Mesa burger nothing special   fan sweet potato hash but might because big sweet potato   However no particularly fond dish skipped opinion   highlight meal hash brown quesadilla   Overall thought pricing bit high brunch would return again brunch   would possibly return day again dinner though  <EOR> We kicked off Restaurant Week 2010 Mesa Grill  When arrived 5 o'clock very few diners pretty sure just two other couples  But meal dining room quickly filled  noshed bread basket while waited appetizers blue corn muffin wasn't appealing bottom looked moldy  fruit bread favorite expected least   Then started first course Roasted Corn Soup Smoked Tomato Salsa Blue Corn Pancake Barbecued Duck + Habanero Chile Star Anise Sauce  soup decent unusual hint flavor thought squash maybe but husband thought tasted more seafood  Obviously weren't same page  blue corn pancake duck very tasty  Again blue corn does nothing its appearance   For main course Blue Corn Crusted Halibut Salsa Cruda Sweet 100 tomatoes capers jalapeno Fresh Oregano Basil New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin Bourbon Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale Crushed Pecan Butter  fish nicely prepared presentation different thanks blue corn looked liked asphalt glistening off filet  pork flavorful long crust every bite  tamale unlike your traditional tamale still tasty however   Lastly finished Coconut Layer Cake Banana Cream Pie  Both good but nothing particularly memorable   Service very good throughout meal  All all fine meal just nothing particularly notable  can't say I'd return but happy took opportunity finally give try  <EOR> THE RESERVATION!

OK guess check out  time did consider fact neither companion nor myself particularly cared Bobby Flay but ignored fact because hey he must famous reason   his charm only far   Perhaps man cook   Plus mood mexican like food   Lesson learned your first instinct   We brunch date Mesa burger which small but presented very nicely   flavor just OK burger itself mediocre but grilled onion horseradish mustard burger very tasty   Southwestern fries bit firey little greasy side but OK complement OK burger   I ordered Sophie's chopped salad asked waiter give quick run down veggies it   However when came found olives which he failed mention   Because olive flavor overpowering and dislike olives send back   date dug into sandwich replacement salad did come until he nearly done meal   Check minus service     I wouldn't upset delay time getting meal fault   however when put something olives same mushrooms onions chopped salad diner inquires should sure remember list components strong polarizing flavors   He may just forgotten but busy hour bit ticked and hungry    Side note bread basket some decent items   blue corn cornbread muffins really dry jalapeno bites hit or miss heat factor depending which ate perhaps some mild others spicy? mini breakfast pastries very good sweetness consistency   Stick those your pre brunch calorie consumption     The only redeeming part meal cocktails   tequila Fresca cocktail light refreshing sweet  delicious   date margarita which he claimed best he's had   don't know helpful though he's generally margarita guy   Overall food mediocre high points awful low points service spotty drinks great   would say expected more Bobby Flay but said above he just never really style really expected mediocre delivered just that   Expectations met  <EOR> I wasn't feeling well blacking night before but veal chop dinner pretty satisfying   Portions really big no table finished food maybe because everyone hung over sick no appetite   Service excellent  <EOR> Very good food great service!  The waiter really nice helpful when didn't know wanted exactly he gave really good suggestions ended following  suggestions great because no complaints food food amazing   For appetizer Garlic Shrimp Tamale  delicious shrimp perfectly cooked sauce well shrimp  Also tamale really shrimp   We 4 things Pork Tenderloin Veal chop Lamb chop roasted Brussels sprout salad   Pork tenderloin very soft sauce well it  also liked all meat dishes came tamale each different taste it  quite while since ate Mesa grill forgot Pork Tenderloin think sweet Tamale  Veal chop moist soft  ratio fat meat perfect  reason really liked Veal chop really juicy but juices don't flow meat but instead stay chop  think tamale Veal chop cheesy one  Lamb chop also really good which saying something don't normally taste lamb  brussel sprout salad also delicious  brussel sprouts perfectly charred pomegranates added nice sweet touch   I highly recommend eating here <EOR> One best meals ever had!  Had blue corn pancake duck YUM! 16 Spice Chicken Spiced pork tenderloin Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon Roasted Corn Sauteed Spinach Roasted Tamale  I know dessert but can't remember was   Everything delicious service superb but prices pretty high however worth every penny! <EOR> Food excellent! Highly recommend porcini mushroom quesadilla appetizer  spice chicken salmon also excellent  Overall excellent experience would definitely return  <EOR> Good drinks good service killer coconut dessert but entrees disappointing salty mess  rabbit she ordered 16 spice chicken  meats dry far much salt   High hopes left high dry  <EOR> Like others really looked forward eating here   thrilled leave credit card reservation but over it    Lovely decor but nothing spectacular  Having Vegas eaten some other celebrity chef restaurants expecting high prices   food did live expectations here   Big bold flavors I pork others table veal chop venison same those perfectly cooked pork delicious tamales although little sweet well very spicy pork delicious sauce   Portions great almost much   Unlike apps small portions big prices   Duck taco 1 small blue corn soft tortilla 3 tablespoons duck $16 00   Hard share 3 other people tiny bite each!

Good job Bobby Flay! <EOR> I over labor day weekend family visiting town   restaurant itself good feel classy without feeling pretentious    Our waiter arrived shortly seated over food drink menus  He left give some time but came back 3 minutes later  He asked if ready apologized asked give just few more minutes  Big mistake   I think he annoyed weren't ready 5 minutes couldn't find him  Another 5 he surfaced because table next just seated  He did same menu review left  Then he came back order dad finally attention  He told he would back he other table's drinks   Wouldn't take drink order well???   Fast forward another 5 min finally placed order  drinks arrived relatively quick along bread basket rather impressive  Great selection truly unique flavor combinations  known excellent margaritas however really wasn't impressed them  good but compare all others against good    It wasn't long before entrees arrived  tuna steak which comes bed cous cous  Overall really quite good  only downside would some bites such high salt concentration wanted spit  respect margarita came handy 3 members table sixteen spice chicken which supposed most recommended popular dishes  All 3 complained chicken dry really disappointed dish  Another family member pork tenderloin which he enjoyed but didn't feel all impressive    After finished waiter came over dessert menus said he would give time look over   I'd say minimum 10 minutes passed before he returned   going order dessert but lack service finally made decide just leave somewhere else dessert    My father seven stars member well over decade almost every nice restaurant caesar's entertainment family generally received excellent service  note Mesa failed horribly service would still sub par even if he wasn't 7 stars   The hostess other staff friendly but no should spend $300 plus tip waiter attitude treats table inconvenience him    I don't think we'll ever returning stick Ruth's Chris Old Homestead Gordon Ramsay's restaurants now on  <EOR> Was excited try Mesa Grill enjoy watching Bobby Flay TV am fan southwestern cuisine    Was greeted lunch service very rude hostess told needed take off hat before she seated me  dressy fedora style hat course wasn't going sit on    The attitude didn't stop there  server extremely short when didn't order appetizers start meal i ordered ham eggs while girlfriend pork sandwich  pork nicely seasoned but overall nothing else really special  ordered coffee finish meal never offered refill  Seriously $4 00 cup coffee  No refills   Based solely poor service attitude Mesa Grill won't returning  shame because Bobby Flay ALWAYS smile TV but none employees could even bothered  elsewhere  <EOR> The food delicious   ordered tuna nachos which delicious tuna appetizer   quite nachos   tuna poke chips served separate bowl   But delicious   also tried lobster taco appetizer   Tiny little tacos guacamole garnish taco tiny bit lobster   main course ordered chicken mashed potatoes   mashers pesto tasty   chicken great sauce it   Everything delicious  <EOR> Flay Slayed it  loved lunch definitely return  don't normally eat fries but   these amazing  Lamb cobb salad unusual dish see menu give whirl  exceptional  ordered ahi nachos  found chips distracting main star dish  Dining mates burger crazy good  Even wine menu reasonable marked 300%    I'm glad Bobby's place winner! <EOR> I tried really hard but given expectations I'd say sorely disappointed   Not say stuff wasn't tasty because was  But  all really was  religious experience anything haven't before  decent unadventurous food prices flabbergasted me  If paying name expect distinctive meal unfortunately didn't visit   I liked ambiance restaurant though course since Vegas occasional rowdy cheer betting area  Servers fine but didn't seem professional would liked dinner service did poor job blending into surroundings made some odd seating decisions shoved friend into back restaurant when weren't many guests time   Speaking lighting very back restaurant bit underwhelming though rest restaurant felt just fine  seating back bit closer would people seated next during course meal far close leaning over any way would contact could easily listen other conversations which don't think appropriate type restaurant is   So onto food Bread basket consisted muffins jalapeno bread raisin bread  raisin bread vaguely fermented scent slightly soggy wasn't quite sure that  muffin quite crumbly didn't much distinct flavor which would theme rest night jalapeno bread also lacked any semblance heat perk tastebuds  bread basket really nothing write home about   I started off Blue Corn Pancake BBQ duck  Flavors balanced well if bit reserved  sauces straightforward somewhat banal  BBQ duck sweet meat flaky though felt duck really lacked sort gameiness distinctive flavor associate duck  If texture mouth feel someone could told some other mystery meat probably wouldn't made much fuss  blue corn tortilla would expect though bit thicker would liked  microgreens topped appetizer really unnecessary contributed nothing dish wonder if maybe another decorative herb would some impact flavors rather just appearance plate  All all fairly well decorated plate but average tasting dish  Portion extremely lacking   Since holidays server informed serving exclusive dish consisting pork chop sweet potato apple  intrigued opted original entree choice  plate itself decorated nicely really homey straight grandma's house feel which liked   wasn't sure if made right decision choosing but pork chop dish tame best  server did inform wouldn't much spice pork tenderloin dish serve but double cut pork chop itself didn't even strong porky flavor  meat drier would liked  If did any other sort marinade preparation meat couldn't taste it  ancho chile sauce paired good but again very reserved match  dish almost non existent heat  can't call anything dish bland seasoned fairly well just nothing particularly distinctive elevated ingredients  sweet potatoes sliced served simply is  guessing sauteed flavored butter some sort still very firm didn't taste exactly would expect sweet potato taste like  expecting more thorough preparation least mashed sweet potato fit holiday theme bit surprised see served  but surprisingly flavor very unique almost nutty  roasted apple stuffed walnuts cinnamon probably star night tasted great  tart fragrant particularly sugary all  wonderful holiday treat  portions dish all well sized balanced appropriate   So while Mesa Grill probably worth another visit part could tell exorbitant prices didn't justify served  don't doubt could off day but hoping dishes would really pack significant flavor everything just small blip tastebuds  Given Flay's reputation stronger bolder flavors expected more  even if wasn't Flay's flagship restaurant would still give same verdict good but great food  <EOR> Came per recommendation foodie friend weren't disappointed  surprised see hamburgers menu because  thing Bobby Flay known for  Ordered amazing lobster taco appetizer green peppercorn tuna steak lots whole yet soft peppercorns rabbit carrot cake ice cream sandwich pineapple caramel sauce butterscotch cake  All AMAZING!!!

Mesa Grill truly worth experiencing if you're Vegas  swanky southwestern decor dishes sensational   sing text write dance Mesa Grill praises some time come  Maybe day try New York Bahamas location <EOR> Mesa talked those MUST eat places when Vegas  Maybe off night but sorely underwhelmed  Poor service meh food   service very solid though  hunch restaurant booked solid most nights because chef well known but honestly worth it   suggestion head over Bradley Ogden Spago food better service isn't restaurant really about? <EOR> Food amazing service outstanding   wife point Mesa each time we're Vegas  ordered rabbit couscous best meals ever eaten second only pork tenderloin ordered previous trip  truly amazing restaurant experience can't wait back   reservations ahead time prepare spend lot money but worth it  <EOR> The atmosphere nice  place middle Caesars itself maze through especially couple drinks   eaten many times  first few times many years ago fell love  Cuban pressed burger!!!!! don't need say anymore other then   it's gone!! I other dishes but most recently Mesa burger  really good very juicy large enough big appetite  Even though favorite burger all time no longer available hasn't years still come Mesa burger very good   PLEASE BRING BACK CUBAN!!!!! <EOR> I could care less Bobby Flay he back slaving over pork tenderloin   We reservations arrived seated right away Friday night  far good  Drinks big strong  appetizers arrived presentation flavor wonderful  same could said main courses  Everything everyone party ordered fantastic  servers helpful friendly fast  little worried Southwestern Cusine might hard pull off but while flavors bold tastefully done overpowering all  great restaurant  <EOR> As great fan Bobby Flay happy say meal matched expectations  ordered salmon cooked medium rare  flavors just perfect would definitely back  <EOR> Good 5 Stars most amazing meal ages thought Bobby Flay's restaurant would just trade celebrity status but really food phenomenal  Also reasonably priced quality food Bad Service waitress just wanted chat seemed like  don't know why but seems if she spent half time just standing over talking Los Angeles did etc      Ugly group tipped $50 $300 meal which just north 15% which thought generous considering service non stop chatting getting leave she says did mean only tip $50? Normally last encounter waitress would ruined evening but food just good!!! <EOR> Mesa Grill pretty much embodies Bobby Flay's personality bold cocky yet knows shit no matter much wish he would flat fail prove right he hidden soft side well hope wife's sake he does    I already hyped going during EZ P J Ho's birthday celebration weekend aka EZ Ho weekend    looking any crack hull sink Mesa Grill's ship but simply couldn't find one   Scurrying through dining area peered through big kitchen windows see if Flay house and he wasn't    loved place relatively casual pretentious   Decor simple nothing really distract away your meal   wait staff attentive informed friendly even precognitive couple times!  Chimay beer list causing eyes well sheer joy   shared shrimp tamale signature dish which impossibly bold delicate same time   lamb porterhouse chops chimichurri sauce great nicely medium rare seasoned well   sauce well executed though must say chops didn't taste good tried EZ P's signature pork dish which extraterrestrial far flavors go   back dish then   Ehh hell Chimay     I would've loved see Flay fall face but dammit guess time! <EOR> Can just appreciate perfection tiger prawn tamale?   For 2 tiger prawn tamale start spicy chicken sweet potato hash romaine salad entrees    As good spicy chicken sweet potato hash imagine bbq tex mex eggs benedict kept wishing just more tiger prawn tamale  tamale very moist fluffy good amount sweet corn kernels texture prawns perfectly cooked creamy but heavy sauce    The hash quite delicious but eating half dish sufficient bbq spicy sauce + sweet potatoes bit sweet overwhelming brunch dish  Salad good balance hash fresh lettuce good dressing   5 stars tamale haunts dreams  <EOR> Bobby Flay why oh why won't let chain kitchen? I'd even gut entire house give kitchen worthy your gifts  would also expand doors accommodate inevitable obesity   The pisco sour ketel gimlet? Both wonderful   The tiger prawn tamale appetizer? Amazing   I ordered chile relleno basic sounding but stuffed grilled eggplant manchenga cheese all basic  friend ordered Ahi  Both fantastic  Perfectly made  food unbelievable  decor cute  service top notch if beyond  even blankets available those ladyish type outfits may led bit chilly  no thing wrapped red blanket kept food coming   Damn near perfect meal  <EOR> Some friends came Vegas wanted Mesa   kind last minute since Saturday night figured better call reservation   put down 6 00   course traffic horrible called back asked if could change reservation   informed since didn't secure reservation credit card fact didn't one   person spoke phone helpful very rude  She proceeded argue whether reservation till finally asked if could just please one   made new reservation 6 30 she let off phone without credit card   Then when arrived restaurant Hostess rudely told didn't reservation she adamant till pointed name written down sheet next 6 30    I beer corona tecate? Lobster Tacos appetizer sesame crusted ahi   alright   portions very small   daughter cheese quesadilla milk   bill just myself daughter came $100   The service good but wasn't lot it  <EOR> I real worried eating due reviews saying food bland  anything but  blue corn pancake duck WOW  entrees pork tenderloin sandwich green chile burger  pork incredible burger lot flavor but green chile probably most tender burger ever had   We ate lunch because concern  definitely worth going dinner back  <EOR> Was absolutely great until bill came  15 minutes seperate 4 meals?

Started off Tiger shrimp +roasted garlic corn tamale which bomb lobster hominy cakes topped Fresno chile butter sauce which worth every damn penny! desserts ordered chocolate sticky toffee pudding cake pistachio brown butter cake  If you've ever wanted foodgasmn suggest try chocolate sticky pudding cake tiger shrimp tamale  all ate off each others plate everything Mesa grill point! filet Mignon crusted pork tenderloins pesto mash potatoes cornmeal crusted chile relleno drinks    all delicious! waiters knowledgeable funny service great!

Five stars well earned  wish could add another review brunch excellent  <EOR> We my husband mother I Mesa Grill last night dinner   very excited because he such famous chef however all very disappointed   waited 45 minutes dinner note did order any appetizers which probably issue them    watched others around appetizers main dish asked dessert before even served meal   charged well over $100 meal but food just average   last meal Las Vegas should picked another place because entire meal left bad taste mouths   literally   recommend restaurant never eat Bobby Flay owned restaurant again   wish someway actually contact through website give some feedback  <EOR> We MESA grill once before few years back but some reason visit really stood out  hubby flew Vegas morning starving around noon decided try MESA grill again  opted prix fixe menu while hubby chose New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin  I started Blue Corn Pancake which consisted barbecued duck wrapped blue corn pankcake absolutely heavenly  could totally ate 3 them lunch alone! Then Yucatan Chicken Tacos which also really delicious  smoked chile barbeque sauce peanuts divine   The hubby really enjoyed pork tenderloin sandwich well  He said lot spice flavor it  definitely say french fries came sandwich some best fries ever had  perfectly seasoned crispy soggy either!   The only reason why review didn't 5 stars because panna cotta desert didn't really wow me  fair first time actually panna cotta but pretty sure won't getting again  texture just wasn't very pleasing me  If could would give MESA grill 4 5 stars time around <EOR> Great service great atmosphere great food  little pricey $100 00 dinner four appetizers two drinks but  Vegas  Crusted Avocado Tostada absolutely amazing margarita ordered best ever  worth $15 cocktail price point  If you're staying Caesar's Mesa absolute must  <EOR> I suckered in   Bobby Flava' Flav!

Best part meal! Thanks Athena!! <EOR> As veteran Food Network groupie visit Bobby Flay's Vegas restaurant! onto Mesa Grill went!  I ordered Chile Relleno which actually eggplant chile  never before but scurred going overwhelmingly cheesy  impressed wasn't! Maybe because use manchego cheese something heavy  crispy cornmeal outside nice touch sauces complimented overall taste   Yum yum   The only bad things lunch menu very limited  8 10 appetizers 6 8 entrees  it    The other limiting factor only vegetarian dish so   technically didn't any other entree option  <EOR> The food great service lacking   aware GREAT GROUPS want more check   group 4 brunch everything going well until check arrived   server asked if could bill split looked children said could but would take 15 mins manager would back room  Really? modern day POS system doesn't allow split checks?

The seating leaves lot desired  two top seated cattle tables refer them   you know where sitting top strangers much could share dish? facing wall zero atmosphere take in   just Mom's beautiful face red orange wall  matters worse far cattle table concerned people right fond each other weren't speaking preferred listen conversation  point woman physically turned body towards looking while dining  EXTREMELY uncomfortable    Our server bit attitude didn't appreciate   heard suggesting Halibut table next us  When he came table asked he thought Mahi Mahi  He told already heard prefer Halibut  Ok yes did  First all weren't speaking shouldn't held accountable your recommendation another table second all didn't ask compare Mahi Halibut asked was  didn't care own instincts Mahi which delicious! rice served also delicious!  Mom chopped salad which tried extremely tasty!

I extremely bummed find restaurant only offers brunch menu Sunday 1 30pm expecting full choices lunch  advertise lunch menu outside until you're already seated find brunch your only option  hardly any choices all!  We ordered 2 appetizers entrees burger spice chicken salad  All food bland  honestly better burgers Burger Lounge chain LA dare say even Applebees Chilis restaurant  Seriously! WTF?!

Every single aspect dining experience stellar  Mesa Grill radar before arriving LV boyfriend decided reservations dinner around 9 30P Friday evening  sure there's SOME room walk ins but would definitely reservations advance if you're planning going during prime dinner hours    Bobby Flay really put together incredible menu start finish  started roasted tiger shrimp + corn tamale which kicked off meal perfectly  All flavors dish just worked together perfectly  opted nab two sides instead second appetizer decided roasted corn cornmeal crusted chile relleno entrees  corn could quite possibly favorite foods ever  beyond delicious seriously MUST if you're ordering side  chile great though didn't quite same impact  Being pescetarian tuna steak pretty natural entree selection couldn't better choice  surprisingly big portion all around amazing plate  should say though entirely much food  could JUST entrees would satisfied  app + two entrees two people probably enough unless you're particularly hungry  end meal point where beyond full but couldn't seem stop munching because good! Dessert wasn't even option over ordering  When pop keep mind portions actually pretty good sized which pleasant surprise order accordingly  All around amazing  would definitely come back again next time Vegas! <EOR> Did know Mesa Grill serves amazing brunch?   Okay dinner fantastic but let's talk brunch  You same luscious breadbasket brunch dinner but includes coffee cake thing crumbly topping   yummy  The goat cheese queso fundido appetizer both brunch dinner menus   cheese heaven portion ginormous four people easily share it    As far brunch entrees both chilaquiles tostada fabulous   love eggs love spicy doubly love spicy eggs   Next time am going try enchiladas  The brunch entrees come grits potatoes   am big fan potatoes always grits always rock world   rich am sure anyone eat whole bowl but wow tasty! Then full dessert menu brunch which changes every often   Very smart!  time dining companions share because full but desserts perfect end perfect brunch  <EOR> ***Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill showcases several good starters entrees generous portions but menu hardly changes good option if never but if Mesa Grill return visit might leave disappointed restaurant lacking ambition challenge itself try new things you cannot really blame restaurant though given its popularity well customers' satisfaction Mesa Grill's signature dishes ***  I Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill few times consistently delivers tasty well prepared food   Unfortunately menu also just seems never change   case lot Las Vegas restaurants for example Picasso's tasting menu features two courses forever    Still almost entire menu Mesa Grill remained same since first visit long time ago   The familiar menu pros cons   going lot dishes tried true   addition most guests come Las Vegas rarely would likely only dine Mesa Grill once limited changes menu would impact most customers   other hand menu feels tad dated Mesa Grill does really capitalize latest trends progression cooking techniques popular protein cuts produce   I started tiger shrimp roasted garlic corn tamale   popular dish good reason   tamale hearty tasty moist cornbread like texture   shrimp good plump cilantro sauce also nice though personally would preferred spicier   For entree New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin which served bourbon ancho chile sauce sweet potato tamale crushed pecan butter   Unlike shrimp corn tamale entree incredibly spicy   pork rub lot heat the sauce some heat    nothing really cut heat kind dish tired bored eating and may struggle finish    The pork tenderloin a very underappreciated cut cooked very nicely here   pork tender good amount moisture which rare given limited amount fat cut   sweet potato tamale noticeable sweet potato flavor but lacked more tamale like texture corn tamale starter   My dessert sticky chocolate cake   very similar Mesa Grill's previous sticky toffee pudding   cake similar glaze  warm mix salty sweet   cake itself great  a standard grocery store like cake similar ordinary chocolate flavor similar texture would Ralphs Vons    also just much cake especially given ice cream almost ridiculously small portion   Service fine   staff pleasant food came quick pace   felt staff could more attentive   Prices actually bad Mesa Grill   Prices very high but common most Las Vegas restaurants   least serve very substantial portions quality ingredients good   The dining room contemporary showcases open kitchen   very comfortable dining room   Unfortunately restaurant completely closed glass may appear   quite few open areas where large glass panes meet   Given proximity casino slot machines cigarette smoke does waft which might create undesirable dining experience if close restaurant's outside wall   There definitely some good and even great things Mesa Grill   few delicious items menu most food well prepared   If never Mesa Grill worth visit restaurant also feels more worth money other celebrity chef backed restaurants Las Vegas   If already though Mesa Grill exciting menu does change much does kind feel kitchen really just going through motions   Mesa Grill located Caesars Palace   most major hotels casinos Strip Caesars Palace offers both complimentary

Now if only done triple take Michelin list realized 2008  Mesa Grill lost star Chef Bobby Flay's only Michelin star 2009  Oops! Oh well 2012 Yelp stars better anyway don't we?  Lunch 12 30ish busy many patrons looking brokering some kind big shoulder pads deal table but also plenty tourists wearing ordinary clothes nice jeans pants nondescript shirts etc  guy bar baseball cap on  woman bar dressed Pussycat Dolls audition  typical range casino couture   We only wait few minutes before seated many two tops upper elevations restaurant  Remember those tables last cruise? Mike asked  He meant ones where could hug people next table without hardly stretching  closeness tables Mesa Grill disappointing next time I'd wait something little more side four top when things less busy  Being distracted neighbours' conversations well repeating ourselves safe broadcasted murmurs part ideal dining experience   The good news food delicious can't wait back    Our meal started complimentary bread basket Jalapeno Asiago Corn Muffin Raisin Bread   I figured corn muffin yin yang mix yellow blue corn meal would best  Mesa Grill specializes southwestern cuisine all   Meh okay  bit flat  Maybe tiny tiny bit metallic? Then tried jalapeno asiago slice   Oh Em Geezers  A MAAAA ZING!  How could unassuming white porous fluffy bread pack much sharp sour flavour crusty edge?  I only little nibble raisin bread sweet crumb very bitter crust because appetizers arrived  Chicken Black Bean Quesadillas Mike Cremini Mushroom Quesadillas me   Two words could just copy paste 100x into review would subtlety  layers  every bite everything ordered Mesa Grill would new flavour discover  sure ate half meal head cocked tried taste everything gone into dishes   Nobody adores cheese more know some people criticized Mesa Grill offering very cheesy fare but quesadilla perfectly cheesed  fact kept peeking inside until could figure but cheese melted such way completely cover blend tortilla create thought first just thick bottom tortilla  Harmony Mesa Grill does it   Contrasting pillow bottom overall crispiness  Crispy but burnt whatsoever  I don't even suggestion burnt taste  Between perfect cheese crunch light layer mushrooms didn't dominate dish yummy dollops cream top each quarter slice any praise left fried egg top?  Oh but must because genius  fried egg just added very simple edge quesadilla's taste without interfering any flavours already going on   My stomach full heart broken couldn't eat last three bites but did main courses coming  Gah! Next time just starter dessert skip corn muffin  absolutely no room any exciting dessert options trip  Mike ordered Yucatan Chicken Tacos which interpretation satay sticks tortillas peanut chile sauce  let talk own review  ordered only vegetarian item main dish section Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno  Note more vegetarian appetizers  Often find chile rellenos greasy samey gloopy but good  wanted see Flay's people would do   Short version best chile relleno life    say even though thought cornmeal coat absolutely bland if bit yucky  If any seasoning couldn't taste it  But once peeled back chile itself and all complex cheesy yumness inside delicious  herbs top drizzled sauces underneath every bite just intriguing new quesadilla   Yelp says characters just say Michelin needs bring back Las Vegas guide bring back Bobby's star  <EOR> Bobby Flay fan  don't your show find your SW cooking inauthentic severely overpriced pretentious  fine margarita however   If want severely overpriced southwestern food even Vegas believe doesn't properly represent authentic southwestern food then give place try  Personally save money travel Arizona New Mexico Texas eat real thing  might actually cost less well      In not so humble opinion much better placed blow $100+ dinner drinks Vegas  never understand people overpaying crap food    <EOR> We amazing meal here   Starting lovely bread basket especially blue corn muffins everything really just solid   shared prawn tamale starter perfect   Very tasty something incredibly simple   Moving mains two filet mignon which say amazing   dont' often find filet flavorful but perfectly spicy crust mushroom sauce complimented but didn't overpower     firends scallops both pleased meal   sides pesto mashed potatoes which creamy tasted great spinach which unfortunately nothing special   wine list nothing special   too bad because would better selection   service absolutely excellent   would recommend   lot times Vegas outlets good restaurants don't live original but most definitely does  <EOR> My friend said quote Mesa Grill you'll hate yourself if don't  enough convince give Mesa Grill try  Please note dress code men no exposed shoulders aka no tank tops   I loved wonderful array colors cascading around room overhead wood beams gorgeous  Recommend Shrimp Tamale sauce simply marvelous tamale fresh equally packed flavor  admit sure pricey tamale but its worth trust   Ribeye quality meat superb many complex flavors going balanced harmony  Roasted Corn Mashed Potato sides best corn side dish ever had!!!

All all definitely would give Mesa Grill another shot but wouldn't feel compelled order veal pork tenderloin again     But definitely sweet potato tamale! <EOR> Visited 8 18 2014  I never really cared eating salmon restaurant since consider fairly common fish supermarkets  Also personally cook best salmon ever tasted  Well best until some Bobby Flay guy serves Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon waitress recommended  appalled idea any salmon any kind could only cooked perfectly but cooked presented almost level which only reserved swordfish  very impressed lunch Mesa Grill  want venture into world gourmet seafood see if any other fish could challenge mantle swordfish  <EOR> I blue pancake duck BBQ start good!!

Must try this  supposedly signature dishes really can't wrong this   Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops Smaller portion compared tenderloin but still amazingly well made dish  Serrano pepper sauce mint chimichurri  Comes blue corn tamale basil butter  complimented dish really well although preferred tamale came pork tenderloin    Side grilled asparagus wasn't anything special but complimented dishes very well   Give place chance sure reservations beforehand  well worth trip! <EOR> Had Mesa Burger burger good but nothing earth shattering good   did horseradish mustard dip fries in  <EOR> Yes love Bobby Flay most things food network   love place   scallops good!  tamales good  steak good  am very good spicy things   Actually am huge wimp   But plenty menu wimps  just all tasty! <EOR> While sitting outside La Salsa waiting Mr  WTF back show tickets browsed Yelp phone discovered didn't need settle mediocre chain mexican food could next door Caesar's try Mesa  Bobby Flay eh names don't impress but good food good reviews do   We without reservations just before 5pm  place pretty empty yet hostess said would 25 minute wait  couldn't wait eat over TI Cirque show  opted eat bar   Hubby Mango + Spice crusted Tuna steak  tried bite okay but couldn't hold candle meal  Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin  Gotta give dish 5 stars probably best pork life  spicy but over top full flavor juicy sweet tamale served perfect companion offset heat  think should rename Perfection Plate  Porkfection   no wait doesn't sound good  Anyway if ORDER PORK   We did receive bread basket full goodies knocking off star  bartender super nice she made killer Lemon Drop  pretty pricy sure we'll back  many restaurants Vegas choose haven't even scratched surface  But pork tenderloin remain good memory  <EOR> Their steak REALLY good! I rabbit ok but good steak though A bit pricey  Good date night  <EOR> Went lunch April   when restaurant just opened first customers but filled shortly after   waiter Ichabod   He friendly helpful   asked recommendations he through good portion menu explained each dish   first serve three different kinds bread includes jalapeno corn muffin   All three types bread very good ended getting refill    tiger shrimp tamale appetizer  Thought good not off charts but very overpriced 19  Normally would never spend much appetizer but figured vacation why not   then ancho chile glazed honey salmon   previewed menu online before going restaurant thought going pick but Ichabod sold this   usually am pretty picky salmon rarely order restaurant but wow am glad this   amazing   could eat every day   Would highly recommend this   Best thing Vegas   Just thinking want fly back Vegas just lunch   I've TV chef's restaurants before disappointed   watch Bobby Flay several cooking shows including Bobby Flay   now understand why he beats almost everyone competes him   He truly legit  <EOR> Random surprise    looking food while randomly walking around last afternoon Vegas    hey isn't owned Bobby Flay?

Tasty tasty items menu but buddy server's recommendation Burgers Sorry forget names but 2 different ones both All say negatively place removes star price   Now before scream Man Vegas!! Everything expensive! hear out   I expect mark items Vegas do   also expect mark when restaurant celebrity chef attached such Bobby Flay Mesa even though he doesn't step foot building   That being said burgers already $18 which FAR much burger but then server asked if wanted bacon wouldn't then brought 2 slices thin Hormell bacon me  which ended being $4 bill   Ok   there expensive $2 slice  SLICE bacon   If thick pork belly style bacon something  then understand   but legit breakfast diner   So left slightly bad taste mouth bill   but overall delicious pleasurable meal  <EOR> I lucky enough  stay Caesar's Palace once year company conference   Whiled try eat all restaurants area   Mesa Grill favorites   Every time food quality service absolute best experienced Vegas   fact given choice going Mesa Grill going Gordon Ramsay's Pub right across hall would choose Mesa Grill every time   selection quality food just step above Gordon's   Overall food just ton flavor just right amount spice  <EOR> Got eat during Las Vegas Restaurant Week  delicious!

<EOR> My second time Mesa Grill  Phenomenal food phenomenal service  Highly recommend if you're Caesar's Palace Las Vegas  <EOR> This first visit Mesa Grill Las Vegas  Always BIG fan NYC location  Everything seemed quite similar Manhattan version but grander scale expected exceptional decor trendy crowd solid menu  Quite overpriced well above NYC prices but hear all nice spots Vegas when high rollers comped feel great value haha   Food maintains highest standard starting awesome jalapeño bread cornbread  grouper topped crab meat cherry tomatoes simply phenomenal  Chorizo goat cheese tamale nice side   My boss co worker enjoyed tuna immensely medium rare    Shrimp appetizer also very good  <EOR> We ordered tiger shrimp appetizer which good but only came four shrimps albeit big ones bit disappointing  entrees pork tenderloin which amazing  Super tender flavorful came yam mash  also rabbit which surprisingly really good because never fond rabbit meat  also salmon which good great also 22oz steak which good but didn't come anything else mashed potatoes anything  having huge steak nothing kinda great side spinach which pretty good nothing but spinach  also baked potato which super different your standard baked potato  between mashed baked really soft  TONS flavor flavor horseradish bit strong but really good  <EOR> On three day work trip Las Vegas joined team Mesa Grill lunch first day  completely embodied feel Vegas general   The walk restaurant through Caesar's Palace forum shops long twisty needless  Made wonder if more direct route people just wanted shopping  walk OK did increase appetites   Once Mesa hostess sat down gave some menus waited rest party show before being shown table    Our table sat dozen comfortably long enough  waiter give speech twice cover each end table  looking forward meal seen Bobby Flay Food Network countless times   I started Gala Apple Salad baby spinach Maytag blue cheese toasted pecans spicy orange vinaigrette   salad spicy but lacked enough spinach really enjoy salad  vinaigrette dominated everything point where couldn't really taste individual ingredients  much it  did texture  wasn't wowed   Next Mahi Mahi fish tacos  Again food good  sauce dominated  serving size big why did ask more tortillas? When two ever enough?  I ordered off menu dessert  did enjoy egg shaped scoops toasted pecan ice cream   For meal didn't pay good  company great  service attentive first 3 4 it   There's no way clamoring back anytime soon    And all feel Vegas  look forward things you've heard years  There's lot waiting wondering  glitz super sized overshadows everything  Without good people really enjoyable   Not disappointed  Just should known better  <EOR> Goat cheese queso fundido Margarita! Worth visit alone  If your date aren't all hungry I'd recommend splitting main dish   especially if pork steak <EOR> I don't know wasn't amazing? pork tenderloin signature dish but wasn't impressed  pork really chewy    also bite duck wasn't amazing either  Maybe just don't impressed easily when hungover    ever  <EOR> The food perfect  Everything best ever eaten  came brunch  husband chilaquiles salmon  salmon grilled crunchy perfect crust outside  chilauiles world  didn't know scrambled eggs could taste that! tomatillo sauce    like no other tomatillo sauce had  good  also side mango glazed bacon  Again best bacon ever had  bacon!!!  The service also exceptional which would expect more upscale restaurant this  server knew all dishes very polite just really lovely experience top food  Now taste why bobby flay master chef! <EOR> Mesa Grill The restaurant decor absolutely stunning  wait staff abundant place teaming high rollers gorgeous people then again why Bobby Flay's place Caesars Palace  We only appetizers plan going back dinner later year    $14 00 Goat Cheese queso fondido rajas blue corn strips  better goat cheese but idea goat cheese fondido sparked curiosity unfortunately dish did satisfy curiosity  rajas rajitas meaning sparse  blue chips thin broke when dipped them into fondido  Did mention presentation awesome    Next Crispy Squash Blossoms $15 00  Filled Ricotta Cheese Corn basil yellow Haberno sauce  think remember 3 4 plate  only appetizer completely devoured  fresh crisp very tasty  Wish two orders Blossoms  reminded chile rellenos without pepper  Encore!!  Next Blue Corn Pancake $15 00  BBQ Duck habanero Chile Star Anise Sauce  Nice idea but someone spilled Hosin sauce into Habenero sauce ruined whole concept  duck dry side pancake tasted corn pancake  little oil butter batter would done wonders pancake  Nice try but needs re worked change price two bucks    Wild Mushroom Quesadilla came white bean hummus white truffle oil  $14 00  home run but would say least double  tasty moist  some magic chile powder sprinkled top tortilla needs reformulated  call McCormick should remedy this  think little garlic butter instead chile powder would earned triple me    I'm looking forward going back sooner later  appetizers good but can't wait try steak lamb  really love open kitchen action behind three dedicated grills plain view all customers witness food being grilled fresh    I'd estimate place does 15 17 million annual sales given number tables bar advance notice give just reservation   Great Job Bobby!

I definitely back try rest menu soon! <EOR> My boyfriend previously tried restaurant mom's coworker both parties said place great!  always wanted try restaurant since then   My family lucky happened come during Las Vegas Restaurant week which means special menu good cause   appetizer ordered blue corn pancake which BBQ duck inside crepe drizzled habinero sauce something sweet   wasn't spicy anticipated but instead very sweet   also paired arugula which delicious   Another thing mention bread Mesa Grill gave before meal very unique   3 different kinds being cheesy another cornbread     My entree pork tenderloin mentioned Zagat try it   really enjoyed it pork very tender good flavor it   remember finishing almost all which pretty difficult  also came sweet potato tamale which also liked just because different   Super tasty but point only take much starch!  For dessert mixed berry creme brulee   dish lovely sweet super silky floppy   Service restaurant probably best ever had   remember dad just finished sipping Coke right he placed empty cup table waiter behind handing another Coke!  Also upon entering restaurant 5 6 waiters just stand waiting stairs which stood me   The only reason why wouldn't give 5 stars because I'd probably back   Wasn't type restaurant big Southwestern food   More personal thing Bobby Flay issue  <EOR> I think Bobby Flay gave food poisoning   or least Mesa Grill did during recent lunch   one star review because became terribly ill eating here   going contact restaurant but haven't yet just back   I Spicy Chicken Sweet Potato Hash poached eggs green chile hollandaise    decent but exceptional  waiter said spiciest thing menu but didn't seem spicy all   wondering if poached eggs made ill     My cousin burger she liked it   husband had   well forget     Anyway very disappointed experience here   looked forward having lunch Mesa Grill being sick nearly two days because meal rewarding experience   can't think anything other food poisoning given symptoms which spare you  <EOR> party 10 saturday night 6pm  service great he made sure ask if going show were   he kept time ushered could time     the best thing all night shrimp corn tamale great flavor unique dish     we ordered several things off menu but lamb porterhouse chop large serving cooked medium rare   tasty but didn't blow mind   friends ordered tuna steak rabbit salmon dishes all ok   price pay you're really just getting big portions little flavor technique originality     overall very expensive steakhouse   mediocre nothing terrible nothing great   given many good places vegas eat would recommend spending your money one  <EOR> This place Vegas staple sure come every time am town   fanciest but food LEGIT   Start specialty margarita Zuchini Blossom appetizer then treat yourself best freaking pork loin ever your whole blessed life   literally every time  <EOR> The food delicious swordfish great husband rabbit friend 16 spices chicken all good server sucked  She poured champagne several times  <EOR> I wish would've written review straight finished meal but ll try best accurately describe joy felt each bite    I preface review saying never urge try any Bobby Flay's restaurant b c thought turn Southwestern food flavors into fine dining especially being Texas  Boy wrong   We started Shrimp Blue Corn Tamale Chicken tacos quesadilla  shrimp perfectly cooked tamale delicious  fave appetizer Quesadilla  love goat cheese love truffle oil  combination electrifying  must try    I veal chop let tell each bite sent shivers down spine  let slight moan every time would put piece meat mouth  veal tender flavoring  Succulent  Each bite sent closer closer nirvana    My friend duck which asked order  OMFG Excellent  Divine  Fantabulous  could on  duck perfect  tender but just right amount gamey ness it  When back again don't know if veal duck  Both excellent    Bobby Flay always known robust flavors say m hitting myself head trying restaurants before  Every dish tried just amazing  Each bite fireworks your mouth  <EOR> I've Burger Palace Paramus

Due experience  meal     The deco fantastic very good location  Great service all around next time back try something littler hotter tastes  <EOR> This first time frequenting Bobby Flay establishment wasn't disappointed  service impeccable point where borderline creepy on point entire waiting staff was  All say nice guy charged watching water glass better raise ASAP because he redefined term attentive  Due several factors okay fine factor Vegas taking more money expected ended dismissing many delectable looking meat entrees ordered Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon  holy mother food sublime    On more minor note bread also gamechanger  might gaudiest most hyped restaurant Strip or Caesers matter but Mesa Grill top notch option anyone looking quality fine dining experience  <EOR> Our

Service very attentive accommodating  TIP Order pork tenderloin medium suggested waiting staff  members party ordered well done definitely tough point  <EOR> I really wanted give place 5 stars  usually love Bobby Flay's recipes place really really good but quite perfect   I stopped lunch 11 15am but said only serving brunch  lunch menu available until noon  No big deal brunch menu good combo between breakfast dishes lunch items   I ordered seasonal pumpkin soup Mahi Mahi main dish  Both outstanding  also brought awesome assortment breads muffins cranberry cornbread etc  ate all them !  The only issue although wait service very good when cleaning table next bus boy waiter complaining another employee  Certainly isolated incident likely would experience but unprofessional front customer opinion    The waiter otherwise great but offered dessert menu which found odd   Maybe just don't dessert brunch menu    It also less expensive anticipated since such famous place  gave 4 stars because food fantastic if back other small issues isolated incidents I'd bump 5  <EOR> This kinda place! Upscale but stuffy  Great vibe  Talented attentive servers  Interesting menu  Delicious food   friends going Vegas next week raving Mesa Grill  know they'll love it  <EOR> I great experience friends family   larger group reservation   arrived few minutes early but promptly seated     We greeted waitress more willing offer suggestions quite reliable based upon smiles faces end meal   When asked wine she made some recommendations but also she wine guy Bernardo come over greet us   He fantastic   He spoke well made great recommendations group six very distinct tastes   Our meals served timely fashion   surprised items made medium rare barely warm but figured part way food served here   flavors each dishes amazing   Nobody left disappointed  <EOR> I freakin love tamales place some amaaazing shrimp tamales!

I ordered spicy chicken sweet potato hash w poached eggs green chile hollandaise   eggs hollandaise great  would order again if could them some other starch   chicken sweet potato hash incredibly sweet  enough savory heat offset sweetness   way way beyond average sweetness baked sweet potato  sure added sweet   ended eating eggs etc  off hash leaving rest   Then time leave  ever attentive waiter disappeared   ended doing leave credit card table trick attention didn't even look bill before he took credit card  but just happy swipe card going   The Tendeloin tartar all Chef Flay but signature MG Burger far short expectations and  sure Chef Flay's expectations would believe burger fluke   chicken sweet potato hash needs reworking far concerned   enough heat flavor profile offset sweet     Go back?  Probably  Las Vegas enough other wonderful restaurants inclined start repeating until gone through most other ones   shame  Chef Flay's cooking even though joke plethora chipotles   Chef Flay  please look into comments  realize restaurants all over country  but when your line cooks can't your signature burger right  wonder   truly hate give 3 stars hoped would out of the ballpark 5 star brunch but high expectations high standards sure set your kitchen staff more slightly disappointed quality character food received  <EOR> I group seven people just ordered bunch different things each course everyone sampled  immediately What's Blue corn pancake Pumpkin Tamale? those over now   Both good but actually really liked Raw tuna nachos Pork tenderloin even better  also recommend cilantro mashed potatoes  only thing wasn't great seriously gross tequila ice cream  love tequila pretty open but all say Yuck !

Maybe lunch  Dinner wasn't worth $325 4 ppl opinion  <EOR> I hate leave subpar review because know many enjoyed it  Most food great drinks awesome service definitely adequate  group seemed enjoy place quite lot I'd still absolutely recommend it   What took exception New York strip ordered completely full cartilage super tough honestly just very bad strip  eaten all types steaks dozens steak houses quality strip no better maybe even worse something you'd find Outback Applebee's  want see price point   My advice would apps desserts even steak  ribeye looked great filet looked great though spicy but don't strip  <EOR> Love Resturaunt everything wonderful wouldn't mind if lowered prices though exceptional service 3 people serving Delicious food Dessert ! If your ever Vegas Treat Yourself ! <EOR> Goat cheese app die for  BF said he couldn't speak moment  Served black tortillas  Yum  The chille relleno eggplant amazing  Panko fried  Bobby Flay definitely did disappoint! <EOR> Ate 1 2 marathon!  Here's rundown dishes ate thought First off well deserved cocktail margarita course!  good  Bread basket only ate slice since didn't want ruin meal but thought bread average butter served noticeably good though   Appetizer 'Rough Cut Tuna Nachos' no idea 'nacho' appetizer but if tuna tartare love appetizer   capers mango puree little chips served scoop all super delicious   tuna high quality   Entree 'Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon' delicious!  steak cooked perfectly great cut meat coffee ancho chile outside really added lot flavor   big win me   Side 'Fresh Corn Tamale + Jalapeno Pesto Butter' fan this   tamale very moist basically tasted plain corn tamale would any regular Mexican restaurant didn't really any flavor jalapeno pesto butter either   can't believe paid ten bucks crappy plain tamale!    Dessert 'Churros' great   churros pretty weak fluffy no slightly gooey center crispy outer   sauces also very good barely any sauce served churros dunking impossible neither sauces strong or notable flavor would preferred small creamer pot good mexican chocolate dipping   Service very good waiter right frequency checking very tolerant being last people restaurant   Really want give Mesa Grill 3 3 5 stars because inconsistency quality dishes across all parts dinner but strength appetizer main dish ahead give them 4 stars    found pricing appropriate slightly high side but expensive where felt food overpriced   <EOR> Expensive but worth it The filet delicious even though normally would never spend 52 00 steak meat ice cream  Very yummy!The queso very well cooked also   I enjoyed food time but being local probably wont back due cost  <EOR> got 1 40 Saturday   serving Brunch menu   serves Brunch menu time Saturday??  We've before     had tuna nachos app  had lamb salad me  forgot wife had   Tuna Nachos awesome  absolutely best Tuna type app ive ever had  sushi mini nachos side  some heat   some tang  great   My Lamb salad great  kept finding myself trying pick things instead eating whole    impressed all    Also mesa burger last time came here   wasnt impressed either   So menu item wise place solid hit    solid miss  <EOR> Super yummy  goat cheese sip blue chips fantastic! chicken absolutely perfect  back! <EOR> Bobby Flay impressed  Poor quality meat ribeye   Your dress coast says business casual but hobo could walk off street table    pack them Burger lunch rush   Very cramped loud atmosphere  <EOR> I don't know why but I'd always reluctant try place     Maybe because close casino floor?   Maybe bright colors?   Maybe because kept thinking Mexican restaurant realize wasn't when actually *was* looking Mexican restaurant just wasn't radar steaks meat?   Maybe because sort no man's land where expensive casual meal really upper tier fine dining restaurants strip?    Regardless finally around trying Mesa when friend's choice dinner     Took little hunting find something really stuck menu me   No doubt just personal preference but quite few items menu seemed polarizing experiments meaning they'd start off sounding great before having deal breaker ingredient don't care for   usually fan substitutions trying alter chef's creation     When did finally decide meal very good   Much better expecting   Portions smaller side though wouldn't put Mesa top tier restaurants strip     3 5 stars rounded me  <EOR> Everytime  am Vegas put Mesa Grill rotation   5 times each time wonderful   Mesa burger huge amazing   can't wrong any seafood dishes   Love atmosphere service Southwestern touch all dishes   those drink nice Tequilla selection some fun cocktails   Your Vegas few drinks gamble little   haven't brunch no comment brunch but great place lunch dinner  <EOR> Went last night BF because huge Bobby Flay fans heard family place good   experience unfolded mixed feelings     FOOD I ordered special restaurant week menu going three courses just over 50 bucks which great deal   salad chose course  number top notch!  hefty lettuce crunchy white blue corn chip pieces perfect amount type cheese great dressing   Then ever raved pork tenderloin   Perfectly cooked good balance flavor but insanely spicy   southern gal spice but wow     should warning it  tamale comes does ok job balancing heat absolutely delicious itself but glad plenty water yummy white peach margarita wash all down   Third course chocolate pudding salted caramel something other   tasty also could easily made home    BF rib eye   looked good   Flavor great   Unfortunately cook way off   He asked mid rare super duper rare   bordered undercooked   BF side corn which didn't care but he loved which surprising because he hates cheese   So    Mixed thoughts food  SERVICE AMBIANCE Amazing!!  Perfect balance casual atmosphere fine dining   entire front house staff spectacular   Kind professional caring timely without being stuffy overly doting   tipped big because found everyone deserving hostess waiter guy water     So all all pretty fine choice  <EOR> A comida é maravilhosa e o serviço foi excelente  Um pouco demorado talvez pelo que pedimos  Um coelho e um carneiro incriveis  O muffin de entrada também é maravilhoso  Vale pena visitar o restaurante desse chefe famoso  <EOR> I lamb chops balsamic Serrano chili reduction sauce  chose ordered medium rare  plate saturated sauce which incredibly over powering vinegary really needed reduce longer use better quality balsamic  taste mouth days  edible but don't feel executed properly cost would expect that  When told waiter he said everyone  explained issue vinegar over powering if properly done should more sweet vinegar  lamb chops little over done cooked medium well ish effort cut  tamale served underwhelming best    My friend ciopinno phenomenal   very  very jealous dish he lovely share me  flavor broth sensational could drink broth  seafood quality   We hibiscus margaritas which loved!   The bread served beginning interesting  Some liked more others  jalapeno corn bread felt just weird flavor taste baking soda intense  husband didn't seem notice    The ambiance definitely leaves something desires  feel more if am some high ceiling ed cafeteria table cloths  romantic special more cattle call  think design could lent little more intimacy experience enjoying food  Again price better less    Based experience cost place would say expected more   Ciopinno saved experience  might try place again if group person insisted going but would lamb most likely wouldn't seek again  <EOR> My new FAVORITE restaurant!!! Excellent food! Excellent service!! Please know spending some $$$ $50 $100 per person depending order   But Mesa Grill well worth it   I ordered Tiger Shrimp Tamale appetizer think said Wow! least 3 4 times  main course Pork Chops BEST ever had  restrain myself gnawing bone  wife Salmon extremely flavorful but glad ordered chops!!

Mahi Mahi done perfection  Partida Margarita     heaven cocktail glass!!! lunch if dinner menu seems pricey  must Vegas! <EOR> I passing restaurant evertime Ceasar's Palace Las Vegas usually use hotel accomodation  Mesa Grill close food court close Casino those restaurants long time really made mark  some reason thou would always pass Mesa Grill look menu move along  honest if just Menu says would wake your taste buds items listed simple sounds  ehhh    But time time again would always wish tried Flay's restaurant when back L A  especially since am avid cooking channel watcher self claimed foodie  weekend wife quick getaway made point table Mesa Grill very high expectations since just saw kick ass Kitchen Stadium throwdowns    I AM GLAD FINALLY WENT!  Looking Menu outside decided start off  some Tiger Shrimp w Roasted Tamale wife Blue Corn Pancake both tasted wonderful really set mood mains  Although browsing menu nothing really looked exciting luckily saw some tenderloins the bourbon it  wife wanted some fish but all night scallops Cioppino both likings she decided Filet Mignon medium rare some spicy sweet potatos side   Let tell first bite Tenderloin Mesa Grill me    meat soft very tender spices really taste them but does overpower meat  delightful  wife's filet holding own taste department rub mushrooms something behold   Somehow star meal spicy sweet potato way prepared something seen nor tasted before  potatoes cut rectanglein thin sheets piled high instead mashed  texture potato changed spices unbelievable something taste believe  Bobby did dissapoint all restaurant continue cheer TV until come back restaurant  <EOR> This second time dining think solid four stars  much love Bobby Flay Southwestern food just wasn't impressed first time however boyfriend looking nice dinner didn't break bank all while offering great food cocktails decided give another mostly because all other hot spots closed before Christmas but digress    I say excellent service  wonderful waiter both polite prompt  started white peach margarita which came perfectly slightly sweeter traditional but much overboard  terrible margarita before which really turned off but think Mesa Grill redeemed itself cocktail part white peach one  other reviewers said nice complimentary bread basket both enjoyed  meal ordered Sophie's chopped salad tiger shrimp roasted garlic corn tamale appetizer boyfriend New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin  food great but quip just enough it  honestly felt appetizer portion equal pork entrée which kind sad  really really good just sort small  sure if just pork dish if all entrées but little off putting  should order meal still feel hungry eating sorry   With said actually recommended Mesa Grill few other people traveling Las Vegas they've all great experiences  Perhaps but just can't say favorite place city full many ridiculously good restaurants  <EOR> Once again Bobby Flay did disappoint! Mesa Grill before but probably since over 5 years ago must say experience time just great first!   We actually arrived 45 minutes early reservation because overestimated long would take park walk parking garage 84 year old grandmother  staff accommodating upon arrival no longer 5 minutes checked reservation seated us!   After ordering drinks server brought bread basket some absolutely lovely little samplings! cornbread muffins just enough spice crumbly blueberry coffee cake perfectly moist nice crunchy streusel topping  complaint because restaurant tucked into casino Caesar's Palace cigarette smoke surrounding areas wafts into restaurant became pretty noticeable while beginning eat  overpowering just minor inconvenience    We tried 5 different entrees Sunday Brunch menu would definitely recommend any 5! phenomenal! 5 ordered were 16 spice chicken salad lots smooth yummy goat cheese! good Spicy scramble not spicy very thinly sliced jalapeño peppers it Spicy chicken sweet potato hash comes two deliciously runny poached eggs! Mesa Burger Bobby Flay rightly called Grill Master  Excellent burger Spice rubbed pork sandwich Large portion yummy! A word caution spicy chicken sweet potato hash AMAZING full flavor but spicy person party ordered ended swapping dishes them but thoroughly enjoyed because love spicy food   Service great! No complaints there  Drinks filled without prompting any time starting low server checked many times sure allergies discussed upon ordering properly handled kitchen   All all food extremely reasonably priced considering portions truly satisfying delicious can't wait back! <EOR> This place worth hype  am sure into french fries but am addicted!  I twice both times ordered New  Mexican Pork Tenderloin Sandwich  first time spicy nearly couldn't eat it  ordered again recent time heat much more mild sandwich pretty good  cactus pear margarita amazing white peach margarita little sweet taste    Overall ambiance OK but food amazing  say if dietary restrictions check menu before come  only serve brunch Saturday Sunday afternoons normal lunch menu  <EOR> Skip place no really skip it   margaritas okay but food sub par especially town Vegas     Went restaurant week friend ordered shrimp tacos   Usually when order taco plate restaurant list many comes it   Mesa didn't funny feeling would only 2 instead 3 which find most places     Not only right suspicious but when came she put them together herself   someone threw ingredients plate cooked expected diner put them together   Really?  I ordered burger okay but $16 burgers half price twice good countless number times     Mesa only bad restaurant Caesar's don't if don't to  <EOR> Are ready throw down? Apparently tummy sadly Bobby Flay personally accept challenge   We brunch no lunch weekends  just brunch avoid paying $$$$ dinner  Cheap know  Given Mr  Flay iron chef just try cooking  The restaurant tex mex keep mind  read shrimp tamales best thing here   but sadly did it   The bread basket nice perk its filled your usual baguette French loaf  blueberry bars cookies mini biscuits  dishes carefully thought plated beautifully   I personally felt home fries which french fries btw little tooooo salty   I admit place pricey  You'll pretty much spending $20 more per person  But Vegas! Splurge little! <EOR> We good time loved ambiance waiter fantastic  He recommended some good wine really knew stuff    My gf's salmon kinda funky though    very fishy didn't think tasted great all  steak excellent  bread shishito pepper appetizer   tiger prawn tamale tasty but no mistake those tiger prawns   More something grocery store  Meh  <EOR> I absolutely LOVE Food Network when wasn't mood full on buffet friends Mesa Grill brunch  looking forward meal but disappointed  ordered Barbequed Lamb Salad lamb dry appetizing all  only reason giving place 3 stars Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles amazing  <EOR> Love coming brunch!

Oh well Joe's seafood  <EOR> We Vegas special occasion chose Mesa Grill because Southwestern menu good reviews  enjoy sharing small plates chose appetizers side dishes  Lobster tacos $20 3 tiny tacos tasty but overpriced  Sofie's Salad major disappointment anemic oxidized lettuce canned beans mealy chopped tomatoes cold refrigeration  Blue corn tamale side dish dry cornbread stuffed into corn husk  Chile relleno cauliflower gratin best dishes tried but nothing special  love coconut cake but Mesa Grill's version didn't any coconut flavor really didn't taste anything  ambiance service 4 stars food 2 stars best  huge disappointment  bad night kitchen ? shouldn't happen high caliber restaurant Las Vegas  <EOR> We Friday nite busy all  really liked decor  Good service rock shrimp tamale good bread basket liked corn bread jalapeno bread crust  spiced rubbed tenderloin sweet potato tamale tenderloin dry ask more sauce  tenderloin accompanying sauces yummy  sweet potato tamale reminded much thanksgiving <EOR> Ok just returned vacation think first time written Yelp review vacation   boyfriend HUGE fan Bobby Flay tries emulate own cooking Flay's style   don't cook am very picky eater but amazing fun experience Mesa Grill was!  don't eat meat but love seafood happy see spicy tuna salmon tartares appetizer menu   Every ingredient enhanced fish combination various spices herbs symphony flavor!

A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++A <EOR> I'm huge Bobby Flay fan but combination perusing Forum Shops hunger pangs Spago being opened lunch yet 11 00am rum buzz made take chance brunch Mesa Grill   I only describe decor place southwestern kitsch because festive colors clear plastic wheelbarrows yup wooden accents  interesting setting but really style  menu was  surprise  southwest but hints new flavors such Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon Spicy Black Bean Sauce Spicy Chicken Sweet Potato Hash  Vlad ordered latter ordered Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad no goat cheese vinaigrette side     After taking orders table bread arrived which IMO really highlight  basket came jalapeno cornbread dried fruit scones blue corn muffins      rather your average bread looks feels sitting all day  Vlad really enjoyed blue corn muffins both sweet savory all same bite  While waiting mains looked over table next only see most gigantic burger ever  Mesa Burger does mess around! looks literally dislocate your jaw order take bite  Luckily lady ordered cut half shared man  retrospect maybe shouldn't closely observing poor patrons lab rats? Whatevs Vegas    Vlad pleased dish while mine bit bland  taking goat cheese vinaigrette really nothing salad but chicken spinach  Actually chicken atop mini blue corn tortilla but  it  pull off sixteen spice fat each chicken strip which believe intentionally included flavor   Once fat taken off just season less chicken strips  think waiter felt sorry substituted dish brought 3 vinaigrettes add variety  helped little  green onion best tasting     Overall I'd come again festive table bread but definitely order something else  Perhaps Roasted Pumpkin Soup Smoked Chiles Pomegranate Crema? <EOR> For all Shrimp Corn Tamale!  It's unlike any tamale you've ever had  gourmet twist all  When business trip Vegas usually walk sit myself bar order cocktail no fuss  If starving might burger these    Tamale must  <EOR> I Mesa Grill every time Las Vegas   Bobby Flay does disappoint   favorite cocktail all time black widow mojito   filet fantastic   All sides yummy   Even bread basket hearty unique the blue yellow cornbread muffin delish!

Because he's such arrogant ass   All those Food Network chefs last nerve   personally know guy but let give example   He's into race horses   He bought race horse named himself   Yup    Bobby Flay's horse named Bobby Flay   any more arrogant that?!    Anyway 2nd time lunch trips Vegas both times enjoyed meals immensely   dishes bold flavor feel your tongue just dancing around your mouth   Spicy sweet salty fresh     he just hits your tastebuds smack   The service professional polite   sat bar couple cocktails while ate couldn't any happier   Well    maybe I'd happier if wasn't Bobby Flay's place   man horse  <EOR> Since am 50% population hate cilantro see Hate Cilantro com waiter said only thing kitchen could offer burger!  Come Chef Flay you're kidding right?  Everything already pre made nasty green herb   Such disappointment lunch never return  <EOR> Barf hated place  most pricey pretentious Mexican food ever enjoyed  Bad service craptastic food stay away pork cost much even Vegas    I'm roll            1 star  Ding! <EOR> This restaurant southern   expecting some gumbo jumbalaya some sort mesh favors hit miss   much restaurant chemistry experiment   dishes good interesting combinations favors haven't before   Because restaurant seems just experiment test people's tolerance someone's best idea crazy chem lab you'll try yourself   It isn't southern anything   lunar  <EOR> I fan Bobby Flay long time really excited try place out  two friends Australia wanted show them bit southwest cuisine  Coming Arizona very high expectations southwest food    We decided lunch since reading review dinner busier  atmosphere pretty laid back all customers where shorts flip flops  strange hostess told friends remove hat because strict dress code uh everyone shorts flip flops??? knew exactly wanted reading yelp reviews but decided test waiter  asked he would recommend  He then proceeded tell everything    OK seriously would recommend? He then pointed some fish thing said looks good Test failed!!!   My two Australian friends ordered shrimp chicken tacos  decided order pork sandwich  waiter told cold sandwich warm bread  Uh throw oven something No decided give shot why Bobby Flay should know he doing  waiter extremely prompt refilling waters maybe little eager every time took drink he refilled    The bread basket came being carbholic excited bread  tried Jalapeno first thought OK  Tasted something could local grocery store bakery  then tried famous blue corn  super fragile lifted fell apart hand  piece did mushy looked undercooked  did finish rest  Australian friends took bite said tasted funny    The food disappointing!!   The shrimp tacos came literally 3 pieces shrimp two small tortillas  Uh where heck rest food! Same chicken tacos  two Friends ate them matter minutes  pork sandwich considerably bigger  But weird being cold pulled pork pieces fat  Pork fat cold tasty all  give them Mexican fries came tasty but anyone throw cilantro some fries same thing    I disappointed mention friends hungry 5 min left restaurant  being such big name Bobby Flay needs reconnect local level cuisine  Come Arizona experience real southwest cuisine taste like    If want mediocre southwest cuisine Mesa Grill other wise save your money try different restaurant    PS am no longer fan Bobby Flay!!!!! <EOR> The only thing could made trip Mesa Grill better would eat BEGINNING latest trip Vega$   probably would splurged more apps desserts drinks but walking deep hole failed adventures craps table blackjack table sportsbook awesome trip spa stuck cornbread entree   Regardless everything ate delightful jalapeno cornbread filet mignon mushroom ancho chile sauce cornmeal crusted chile relleno cilantro pesto mashed potatoes   margaritas also excellent pretty strong   muy bueno!  loved colorful decor inside well! <EOR> Does disappoint! grill kick!

Appetizers Rough Cut Raw Tuna Nachos $15 rather small portion but each bite full flavor looming unexpected but anticipated spice  Came only 6 pieces nacho chips!   Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale $16 very tasty bigger portion expected  didn't eat much it   Entrees Pork tenderloin spicy thought going slightly disappointed that  However pork really tender portions just right  Really good use vibrant orange sauces   New york strip steak didn't come anything  menu didn't mention it'd come anything  but guess just assumed? large plate hunk meat ontop drizzle vibrant sauce  steak very good  But   it just piece steak nothing more   Dessert Sampler which included warm chocolate cake burnt orange cheesecake warm caramel pineapple empanada  All them good   but empanada   I guess just wasn't fan  kinda reminded apple turnover  = Overall though place very good  Each plate food very solid explosive flavor nice sauce  7 left extremely full  <EOR> We've Mesa twice last year impressed both times   creativity flavors excellent execution service great   Mesa located just off casino floor Caesar's provides good but great ambiance   The flip side however feel business casual versus formal which great Vegas trip where don't want something high brow   Expect full house plenty noise   The food delicious   queso fundido chile relleno couple sides dessert cannot recall last time went   Everything cleaned off plate   We felt price also very reasonable relative Vegas pricing   Overall great Mexican restaurant impress highly recommend   PS don't expect see Bobby   hear he doesn't often  <EOR> I good dining experience Mesa which more confident Bobby Flay actually legit those Throwdowns If opportunity come tamales corn shrimp margaritas if alcohol two MUSTS  Both really good  usually don't tamales no offense maybe only bad ones because always dry but moist full flavor  corn perfect accompaniment too  margarita custom create your own list tequilas choose concocted mix  white peach margarita which fantastic   We chicken sweet potato hash steak egg  first very unique very Bobby  little spicy basically two huge mounds chicken hash mixed together  Very creative  steak egg more traditional pretty much just your own fajitas guacamole sour cream egg peppers etc  Also good although spectacular because fresh ingredients    Service slow although server apologized because really busy  would return but before try other places strip  <EOR> Fabulous steak  Cooked exactly perfect  Shrimp Tiger app good  corn relish delicious  Nice atmosphere  Sticky Toffee pudding  Nice wine list  waiter delightful   Bread lovely  <EOR> Known its gorgeous drool inducing bread basket Mesa Grill culinary must stops Vegas!   My husband then boyfriend actually visited NYC location prior its closing 2012  remembered loving spiced chicken sweet potato hash  decided order again honestly better remembered! Every component beautifully assembled perfectly made     way overate meals prior and course famed bread basket yet polished plate clean! did however wish entree little warmer    Tiger shrimp tamale tbh bit disappointed thought dish just okay  sauce really salty tamale reminded remnant corn muffins  Definitely worth $19  probably would happier if ordered second spiced chicken hash    A side grits grits deserve paragraph its own  sure add into but texture + spice + flavor spot on  didn't think stomach but happily managed    Service major kudos two servers handled awkward seating situation professionally  Side story table near two young kids threw soiled themselves some time during meal  sure when but servers able accommodate new table further away without embarrassing parties  New plates utensils drinks even bread basket all brought over new table  Couldn't asked better service    Overall definitely stop famed brunch service! Won't disappointed! <EOR> I dined 3 4 times before over last three years  excited come again enjoys great meal  Came past weekend only extremely disappointed food  three others joining me   My entree chicken  Really Bobby?!

My experience Mesa Grill last night confirm really actually amazing!  I quick dinner review based item  However item blew away enough run Yelp share experience  smoked chicken quesadilla which actually world    The size itself pretty small but unlike your average small quesadilla still packed gooey cheese chicken where actually taste smokiness each bite  guacamole creme fraisse roasted garlic shavings ensured every bite absolutely loaded flavor  even believe tortilla itself sprinkled some smoky chipotle magic  heaven every moment until last bite   I quip though ordered glass cab quesadilla when bill came noticed only DOLLAR less meal pardon? waitress bartender case explained only glass cab  why 16 dollars  Would liked warned would paying virtually same thing meal but whatever  best quesadilla life cut losses  <EOR> Sadly disappointing   many great options Las Vegas   Looked inviting but cocktails food under whelming   Sorry Bobby  <EOR> I am writing review before reading any other reviews place   opportunity dine took it   New York strip well shared blue corn duck appetizer bottle wine   steak easily far best steak life   actually closed eyes while chewing   love steak am bit cook myself but just heaven   could eaten two them   appetizer very nice well interesting   Even bread served some chili taste nice   also sampled pork tenderloin thought very good but am steak man usually would order something ribeye which pretty much guaranteed flavor but Bobby Flay being New York all decided New York strip   Boy life changing steak!!!!  48$ steak think two joint around 200$ appetizer dessert bottle nice red wine   would absolutely back eat same steak again   came red green MESA sauce    I probably order bottle think sell separately   Wow steak!

Filet mignon outstanding! <EOR> My girlfriend Las Vegas last weekend birthday  soon room Monte Carlo naturally began searching Yelp nearby restaurants  When found favorite Food Network Chefs Bobby Flay restaurant Caesar's Palace instantly shot top list    We Mesa Grill last night going Wolfgang Puck's Lupo Emeril Lagasse's Table Ten nights before  location very convenient since Caesar's Palace middle strip restaurant itself absolutely gorgeous very clean modern  Everything could possibly want classy Las Vegas experience    Personally still some doubts because Tex Mex girlfriend's favorite type cuisine never seek but would say don't much knowledge either  didn't find whole idea Tex Mex appealing   I started getting even more concerned when found wait staff little pretentious more little snooty  main waiter particular made feel didn't belong since we're young couple blowing all money short getaway some rich established older people really afford place without worrying making rent  Anyway he seemed rather annoyed amateur etiquette overall ignorance regarding such extravagance  But think won over charm end   The man took cocktail orders far best giving all kinds knowledge menu making friendly conversation sharing personal preferences just really making time stop few times just see drink experience specifically going  drinks absolutely delicious   Be excited some pretty good free bread help prepare journey ahead  bread grew ate more but nothing to  We actually tried save money getting two appetizers Tiger Shrimp Tamale Blue Corn Pancake only getting entree Chile Relleno one favorite dishes life conveniently most inexpensive entree menu   But when tasted appetizers instantly ordered another Entree Pork Tenderloin  Tiger Shrimp Tamale especially tasting heaven  shrimp zesty bold pairing perfectly creamy garlic sauce  texture tamale very pleasing consistency  tender but still substantial  Blue Corn Pancake also delicious flavor more simple duck very juicy smothered succulent dark deep rich velvety sauce  very aromatic just truly seductive dish   The Chile Relleno most stunning presentation opinion  cornmeal crust perfect amount golden crisp oily  satisfying cracking open Creme Brulee unleashing cheezy melty spicy explosion within  many textural layers experience eating dynamic just adds diversity flavor  never anything it far best dishes ever tasted entire life  eating art   The Pork Tenderloin also breathtaking look girlfriend would say prettiest presentation but would both agree best dish whole meal  never knew meat could prepared such way where every nuance every single note flavor possible achieve universe sing harmony together immaculately  Every single flavor ever excited taste buds came flooding back brought back friends never knew existed danced danced danced! Pure ecstasy  kind blur  All know eaten best thing ever tasted   And wasn't even end  drunk pleasures food drink ordered dessert Toasted Coconut Layer Cake  coconut shone throughout dish cake incredibly moist icing soft delicate Crème Anglaise just took cake another level decadence    Overall meal best whole life  experience also best entire life but wouldn't call restaurant experience perfect because service  general Las Vegas service lacks attitude  all right things technically but attitude personality say always leaves lot desired  There's rarely genuine friendly service restaurant sadly no exception area  But still give restaurant five stars just being breathtakingly delicious restaurant's atmosphere beautiful clean service still professional fast insanely efficient when ordered another entree still came same time only minutes told them   Yes here!

Vegas work met colleage decided check out  knew Bobby Flay's restaurant anxious try I'm OBSESSED Food Network  started off interesting but tasty bottle Rioja  believe Spanish wine  Kind peppery taste  eyes bigger stomaches decided start Rough Cut Tuna 'Nachos ' came almost pretty eat  muli colored corn chips cut perfect circles  Then nice rare piece tuna nicely chopped drizzle chips  Followed mango hot sauce top  Delicious! service great! waitress would fill glasses just little low  Very friendly attentive! She even made several great entree suggestions  Everything looked great but guess just mood more tuna  ordered Mango Spice Crusted Tuna Steak  ordered mine rare  tasted though infused cinnammon absolutely best tuna steak ever had! Then gave side toasted pine nut cous cous  nice coating crisp cooked perfection  colleague ordered Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin  took bite being big pork fan hooked  just melted mouth  full plates still more food thought best meal ever never wanted stop   Hahah very good choice  Mia even left new cookbook  <EOR> Nothing wrong food entrees delicious very filling  lamb cooked perfection  location however horrendous   it food court feeling lacks intimate dining experience would expect place this  Good food but probably would look somewhere else next time around given myriad options LV  <EOR> I image Bobby Flay through Food Network Southwestern chef  Because when dish says spicy expect some heat  Everything ordered described spicy far good flavors but no heat   I ordered item didn't think described well menu spicy chicken eggs  items included description like  Hubby loved dish steak eggs  also shared shrimp tamale appetizer   The dishes seemed well executed looked nice when arrived table   The service impeccable  very well taken care of  Great iced tea selection biscuits breads table we brunch    Definitely most ever spent breakfast  <EOR> Stopped steak dinner assumed would great because price $45 for just steak no sides first Bobby Flays restaurant  Well wrong would rather ate Fat Burger saved money    I ordered New York ok nothing special also ordered $8 sides corn which great twice baked potato terrible didn't even finish horseradish mixed some orange sauce across top which really threw off    My man ordered pork loin sucked sauces put meat all taste made nasty same thing filet mignon  cioppino green cilantro sauce all little bowl    I would never eat again definitely rip off didn't even taste good all impressed  <EOR> While Las Vegas couple weeks ago mom dinner Mesa Grill   LOVE Las Vegas mind hard awesome time   service impeccable   Just watching place operate exciting   We wanted try few different things instead getting big entree shared two apps Tiger shrimp roasted garlic corn tamale awesome Blue corn pancake barbecued duck good but found duck little tough then side roasted corn chipotle aioli lime cotija cheese amazing    Everything came table piping hot which love     The only thing stops 5 star rating cocktail   ordered Mesa original margarita   wasn't able finish because way much lime juice   couldn't even taste tequila part bummer  <EOR> I dined Mesa Grill four times since living Las Vegas very pleased meal every time   often enjoy meal strip most strip restaurants overpriced serve average food celebrity name it   Bobby Flay created great restaurant think very telling chef Bobby Flay is   Many don't conceited attitude but he great food does while running many restaurants     The decor very unique perfect location   located Caesar's Palace right next sportsbook   restaurant scattered mosaic rusty yet bright colors   colors represent southwestern theme restaurant influences South America    The service Mesa Grill top notch   When your water even close done full   When your drink almost gone ask if want new one   corkage fee $35 which bit steep place but bad considering Las Vegas   waiters always great suggestions very knowledgeable menu terms Southwestern cuisine     There several signature items menu must order items   them Blue Corn Duck Pancake   BBQ duck shredded put into blue corn pancake topped Habanero Star Anise sauce   best appetizer   Another great appetizer Queso Fundido cheese dip made goat cheese easy whole table eat best cheese dip ever had     The best entree signature entree New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin   portion pretty big pork cooked perfect every time it   served sweet potato tamale bourbon ancho chile sauce   3 times every time best thing table    The other entree recommend Lamb Porterhouse Chops served Red Chile Lime Rosemary   If any dish could better Pork Tenderloin Lamb Porterhouse Chops   Although if fish try Spice Rubbed Tuna which also very good    If want steak 3 steak options menu   All them very good but unique other menu items   chipotle glazed Ribeye Coffee rubbed Filet Mignon New York Strip Steak served w house made Steak Sauce   If looking sample signature Bobby Flay cuisine steaks   But if person group wanted steakhouse bad second option great steak     In conclusion let your opinion Bobby Flay steer away eating Mesa Grill   may guy but cuisine he cooks full bold unique flavors combines those flavors perfectly show why Bobby Flay popular  <EOR> I heard many good reviews Mesa Grill  made reservation month ahead  interesting part Mesa Grill required customers provide credit card numbers  If customers didn't show reservations would charge credit cards $50  interesting but don't mind it  think if people really want would willing through trouble   I love ceiling flaming painting  Nothing would match better Bobby Flay's cooking style chili peppers spices  Before going Mesa Grill very worried couldn't anything eat because don't eat spicy food all  When talked server  He said most Bobby's food spicy chili add flavors  He gave couple suggestions WILD STRIPED BASS  husband New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin  shared BLUE CORN PANCAKE appetizer   The BLUE CORN PANCAKE served shredded pieces duck  first bite definitely reminded Chinese Peking duck  duck good juicy  Even though Habanero one most intense chili pepper world wasn't spicy all  very flavorful  husband loved it! pork tenderloin placed nicely plate  rubbed definitely spicy  Bryan said bit spicy but edible  side SWEET POTATO TAMALE sweet delicious  perfect balance spicy pork  WILD STRIPED BASS crispy outside cooked perfect inside  favorite Piquillo Pepper Clam Chowder under bass  packed different layers flavors spicy! Fantastic!  The meal great  two check $120  food very good  Bobby lived reputation  definitely respect more  would love back again  time save some rooms dessert! <EOR> Thank Restaurant week would known menu  Highly recommend making reservations even if just lunch  Everyone point hostess server  Ordered Bloody Mary spicy good corn bread serve unique taste course spicy ordered queso fundido even though going take advantage 3 course lunch  queso fundido best cheesiest thing ever had common theme comes blue corn tortillas  first course ordered sweet potato soup creamy sweet spicy Second course ordered famous green chile burger seasoned fries perfectly seasoned dessert lemony sorbet fresh fruit oh refreshing cleanse palatte yes slight spice sorbet bad way Overall all left place uncomfortably full but table all agreed FAR best lunch all ever had!!!

Just awesome! <EOR> I've Mesa Grill Caesars palace several times dinner admit clearly infatuated Bobby Flay's style cooking even if he ass   atmosphere comfortable dress casual place hopping every time been   definitely recommend making reservations couple days advance if want eat reasonable time but if don't bar waiting area where few tasty Mesa Grill margaritas   The service very good times think found best waitress ever here   only she very responsive knowledgeable menu she told just alright genuinely friendly   talking someone sit down next engage bit instead just feigning interest listlessly read through specials   In short food flavor explosion your mouth   starters recommend very rich Goat Cheese Queso Fundido flavorful Yucatan Chicken Tacos even though portion sizes small price   selection complimentary breads comes meal quite unique   Use caution Blue Corn Cake Muffin though because very crumbly likely end all over if aren't careful     For entrée can't rave enough New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin   never Pork cuts butter rests perfect amount spicy goodness   Other contenders Coffee rubbed filet mignon chipotle glazed rib eye   side dishes don't pass roasted corn Chorizo goat cheese tamale   Salmon usually favorite dish but Ancho Chile honey glazed salmon just alright   The last time couldn't find dessert time before   When asked told new pastry chef   decided try pineapple buttermilk upside down cake new dessert menu divine   don't need menu anymore automatic order   So why 4 stars instead 5?  First reservations when call ahead give them your credit card number charge $50 head event don't show without cancelling before 3pm same day   seems ridiculous considering would no problem filling seats walk ups   Second food pricey quantity   know its Vegas but little bigger portion appetizers wouldn't hurt them much   Finally if come big party stick attractive back room large folding table covered cloth   Aside being bit tacky feel isolated bustling atmosphere main dining room   While none show stoppers enough dock them star   I'll back try rest menu  <EOR> Great job Bobby Flay!

Definitely plan ahead dining experience  <EOR> So delicious! love place  definitely regular brunch spot when town  eggs delicious  bacon unique but good  wasn't potato left any plates  drinks very good well  Highly recommend ! <EOR> Bobby Flay rock! finally dined MESA grill friends overall very happy pleased meal!

Negatives First off server absolute snob unlucky there   would given post 4 stars but took away because server  pork tenderloin sandwich served meat freezing cold   very surprised this   sandwich would much better if meat wasn't cold  When server brought Flay's famous bread basket table only two cold muffins clearly left night before   favorite parts Flay meal past variety breads basket   tables around variety expected get   attribute sucky server   Overall meal positive but don't know if back Mesa Grill future but definitely recommend restaurant any Bobby Flay fans would experience southwestern flavors  <EOR> I chose Mesa Grill hearing Delmonico's way overrated  Having eaten Bahamas location despite aversion Bobby Flay decided give Las Vegas MG try   1  Awkward seating arrangement table six seemed put table middle seating arrangement order fit us  would've perfectly fine if wait staff wasn't continually bumping into friends' chairs then asking them move way  uncool   2  Food great  Everyone really happy dishes  Amongst six ordered duck ribeye pork tenderloins  sides pesto mashed potatoes baby carrots tiger shrimp tamale sauteed spinach  wait bit couple sides because waitress forgot them but wasn't bad  Food came hot tasty   3  Desserts okay  enjoyed spicy chocolate creme brulee Bahamas more profiteroles had  thought really stingy iced cream which put off bit   4  Service alright  waitress chatty came around few times check us   Mesa Grill Las Vegas didn't disappoint wouldn't against visiting BF's other restaurants  <EOR> Loved place! tamales shrimp favorite!! But chicken hash poached egg also unbelievable delicious! <EOR> Went Brunch  Ordered spicy chicken sweet potato hash poached eggs green chile hollandaise scrambled egg enchiladas chorizo red chile sauce goat cheese   The enchiladas tiny looked taquitos  two extremely small tortillas filled barely any eggs plate some sauce  $16 expected LOT more    The poached egg hash concoction inedible  spice totally overpowered dish  could taste any flavors sweet potatoes chicken egg    This ended being super disappointing experience  <EOR> Yes! Definitely 4! Inching toward 5  wife son stopped mostly dessert but 20 year old son hungry something special because earlier fabulous sushi dinner wasn't quite filling enough  He debated himself over menu wife took opportunity order drinks  Especial Margarita Gand Mariner floater top notch according wife perfect Margarita snob  Bitter Frenchie grapefruit drink should never mistake Margarita! along comes moment truth son torn between many items waiter staring down food order  told waiter son eats everything especially appreciates creativity food  waiter didn't miss lamb?  Yes!  Order lamb porterhouse!  Yes! Medium rare! When arrived son took bite eyes grew big he smiled  Best lamb ever! tasted it  No gaminess  Slight char  light layer delicious Argentinian chimichurri just enough tiny slivers cooked serrano peppers give little punch  Quite possibly delicious perfect any steak anywhere! Seriously  lamb served plantain tamale which most restaurants way much corn masa nearly enough filling  wife ordered banana cream pie dessert  Creatively done  No real crust just sliver thin cookie crust like layer balanced top pie filling  sweet  Very good but overly memorable  Overall Mesa definitely worth going back see other interesting things store us  <EOR> I absolutely love Mesa Grill!
