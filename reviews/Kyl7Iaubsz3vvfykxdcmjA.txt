Competitors eat hot dogs advertise Nathan's brand win cash prizes  myself empty wallet unsatisfied pallet   From last trip Vegas wanted try popular Nathan's chain  Once saw quick stop  When place order no line all  took few minutes browse through menu decide wanted eat  place order chill dog crinkle fries friendly cashier  placing order handed those huge pagers let know when order ready  10 minutes later buzz pager pick food   For around $14 plate looked bountiful fast food goodness! Apparently meal didn't taste $14 quality   chili hot dog tasted bland but salty  expecting some sort kick chili but no magic happened here  crinkle fries only decent tasting items meal    I just can't see eye eye competitive eaters Takeru Kobayashi Joey Chestnut  hype just blindsided me  <EOR> Why place famous again?? self proclaimed  Im saying BAD but Im saying GOOD either  hot dogs thin PLUMP doggy! your basic WIENER no frills no thrills  <EOR> Nothing better then having Nathan's right side casino! Nice dog between hot streaks blackjack tables   But   $8 plan dog Lemonaide  I don't know that' <EOR> I've seen Nathan's hot dog's grocery store but didn't know restaurants   stopped Bjork show Pearl considering getting late night dog but just couldn't pull trigger   lemonade fine examples food sale present check kind disconerting does anyone really need see cheese steak know they're going order? <EOR> I love place but your manager check girl personality wall  She seems she doesn't want which understand because work but still    little more chipper lady  <EOR> Ugghhhhh      Just     Ugh   I'm sorry  all say place  work Mandalay Place decided against better judgement walk over food court place Luxor casino     The girl rang nice enough even gave employee discount just showed Urban discount card! thought pretty cool  But  pretty much where all coolness ends    I ordered bacon cheese hot dog  Pretty simple right?
