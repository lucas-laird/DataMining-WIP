Careful though easy leave stone unturned if your devoting your full attention! don't want miss any nook unique crannies nestled down each secluded aisle  Taste test Turkish ice cream try Superdry apparel even reminisce visit Swatch watch     more! all    <EOR> I recently visited shops very impressed   people very nice engaging   Yes some expensive side but all all great opportunity small business owners   loved it   am business owner looking Pop retail locations   think look into further  <EOR> As local hard want come down strip think all potential traffic crazy tourist! Could why never even knew Grand Bazaar Shops? ended down exploring shops default because Elite Yelp Event taking place  Located right outside Bally's Hotel Casino find place  Restaurants Shopping Dining sometimes live entertainment expect  Don't yourself thrilled though because big may think  fact find website bit misleading manner boast luxury kind feel exact opposite  tab bit underwhelmed options shops dining here  think place cool something quick if want stop bar type setting  little outdoor shops becoming more more common Las Vegas just wouldn't top list visit  <EOR> I'm becoming fan Grand Bazaar Shops  could easily given 2 star review back when lot empty businesses terrible food options  Now good variety food options most spaces filled tenants  enter Grand Bazaar Shops Strip but usually enter through Bally's  Swarovski Midnight Celebration light sound show every night 9 pm  You'll want your camera ready when see Swarovski Starburst lit beautiful! Swarovski Starburst 14 foot diameter custom designed LED light fixture can't miss it  food absolutely recommend Pisa Pizza instead definitely Giordano's some amazingly delicious deep dish pizza instead  Ramen Ya Redneck Riviera Wahlburgers notable mentions once Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken opens you'll want try Mac Cheese  Even though Grand Bazaar Shops open market closes certain time depending if weekday weekend nice some restaurants bars extended hours  <EOR> This shopping area took over landscaped shallow pool enter Bally's strip   may solid buildings but most part same kinds hawkers see kiosks shopping centers   day elevator into Bally's broke sign pointing also broke escalator sign pointing elevator   stairs was  <EOR> Even though half stores still open still fun time browsing new shopping area   stores uber tiny but great because essentially window shop entire store without even walking in   stores also pretty unique   nice see items can't find your everyday shopping center    looking forward going back few months checking when more stores dining open  <EOR> I really wanted grand bazaar shoppes  see beautiful lit roof balcony Cosmopolitan speaking me  because going dinner  BLT steakhouse Bally's  Wow disappointed  concept new trend Vegas which put shopping street level people walking all casinos  only problem stores kind expensive getting  only even considered cute doggy clothes named Celebi Paws but dog won't where clothes  <EOR> We loved here! Namely because Native American jewelry shop some amazing finds turquoise pieces good prices Giordano's Pizza Subway Starbucks Alex Ani jewelry shop highly regarded ramen noodle place froyo Dole Whips Hawaiian ice cream tiki bar   rest shops just ok but definitely come back! <EOR> I idea more lower budget mall shops strip but far place fails enough want come back   Hopefully changes soon better shops come up   also cant help but think waste prime real estate place is   couldnt think something more note worthy develop lot thats right middle strip? <EOR> You'll likely stumble upon shopping center if walking down Strip Bally's  most exciting variety shops but worth quick stroll through if passing by  Another major perk clean bathroom back shopping  definite perk if walking don't want maze through casino bathroom   The shops tiny similar shops Container Park  shops include goods purchase well food spots  Some notable shops Honolulu Cookie Company Waffle Bar Lush  middle shop comfortable outdoor furniture rest bit    I wouldn't way come but worth stop if area  <EOR> I love Grand Bazaar Shops! love all shops restaurants most them small businesses ! also there's light sound show 9 pm 12 am! totally recommend coming your free time if your Bally's nothing do  mall very clean sometimes pretty crowded but mall strip expect crowded everywhere  only gave place 4 stars because mall seems there's something missing it  <EOR> The Grand Bazaar doesn't exactly scream grand but okay open air area stroll through  basically collection shops pop ups concessions connected Bally's  During day hanging mist machines cool place down strolling around little more bearable summer heat  Still isn't exactly popular gathering area  night little more activity since  when everyone passes through area   The middle part Bazaar plenty seating some large patio umbrellas could just sit around hangout awhile  Waffle Bar Ramen ya sexy ladies running mini bar there's little bit everything here  There's Starbucks near escalators Wahlburger being built opposite side  Aside few rather overpriced clothing stores souvenir shops novelty stores could find ticket office for shows Strip Marash Turkish ice cream stand free phone charging area among others   P S  If you're going use free phone charging system don't use your real email use secondary one  need your phone number order open locker charge retrieve your phone  <EOR> Makeshift kiosks built into storefront structures would describe shopping area   dining options retail locations seem try look local places but fall short   bar store front type place just seemed odd people would sit cocktails bar   hot dog shop ample outdoor cozy seating which enjoyed bit while people watching   For just don't understand lure place when much better shopping areas take advantage same price   only place seemed worth visiting Starbucks amazing hot coffee which rarely ever say Starbucks nice patio ample outlets charge your electronic devices  <EOR> Looks good night but weird opened majority stores ready months away  Should decent option low cost food strip once its done  Low footraffic now <EOR> When first opened empty feeling claustrophobic  now its worse just place bums seedy people lurk around  Its long past time pull plug diasaster  Even poor people working tiny cubicles give please save hell look when hurriedly walk by  <EOR> I'm sure place looks during day but night pretty dead dirty   I thought looked pretty afar but when closer bit disappointed    I hope place improved since visit back November  needs it  <EOR> If you've ever red light district Netherlands retail merchandise version     Stalls might small pony another another     It particularly pleasant experience stroll through although clearly going open air bazaar feel comes across seedy sweaty enough space move through maze offerings     Hold tight your belongings because could easily bumped lifted jostle outdoor venue  <EOR> For vino Vera facial shop dragging potential customers inside demanding buy your crap horrible business practice one  Secondly raising your voice asking why did come then proceeding shout obscenities them down corridor leave also totally  inappropriate borderline harassment  Surely all desperate thirsty begging doing must understand why nobody wants give 500$  shop here <EOR> We love little plaza  little everyone  Gifts food jewelry course drinks! Our favorite store Red its small liqueur convenience store little bit everything  Since outdoor mall very hot during summer months  mists help cool things down    We can't wait try Wahlburgers which just opened up! <EOR> I lived Vegas several years never seen super cubicle shops  wish better directional markers find small shop you're looking though  When Tokyo Nail Art Bar Las Vegas Blvd works show where shock because tons them! <EOR> The concept fantastic  Pike Place style market smack dab middle Strip? wouldn't love especially comparison grandly underwhelming  steamship entrance fronted Bally's past    It originally intended open September but delayed repeatedly  week ago finally opened  Suffice say wasn't much less underwhelming past    Imagine four rows boring yet pricey stores much bigger your average mall kiosk  Unlike Linq architecture atmosphere quite sterile boring  looks nice night since stained glass roofts gleam lights indigo  daytime roofs look hot mess    Well disappointing    The Final Verdict  Pros Fantastic concept   Cons Fail tastic execution  The umpteenth location Sugar Factory Strip  Everything just blah   Huh? You guys aware daylight color scheme roofs doesn't match rest Bally's right?  Return Factor 4 10  Maybe might better summer  <EOR> Terrible experience security forced buy something Or said leave  started throwing money trash bought something  also video if hard believe don't lie  big white guy supervisor tattoos  <EOR>
