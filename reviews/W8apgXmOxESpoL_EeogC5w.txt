So if ramen place STILL very good choice  should very delicious nice ramen dining experience  <EOR> Was little iffy place first soups aren't really thing especially ramen   But really surprised amazing tasted not your ordinary ramen noodles live off college while sick remember     Nothing really special place's look  Just little hole place next Walgreens but well priced worth try    Highly recommend honey garlic chicken appetizer    amazing  Craving again speak  <EOR> In race monopolize booming ramen fad Vegas Fukumimi created splash ramen ya scene    The quick dirty Fukumimi Ramen shio based   Your taste buds thank you    The long delectably disgustingly delicious My friend's first reaction seeing Fukumimi Ramen Wtf black stuff floating there?! response black garlic oil noob! if any guys hesitant layer questionable black oily liquid floating your broth know good your tummy your heart your soul   But seriously loved black garlic oil put broth only adds more depth deceptively simple tasting broth  hearty some tonkotsu broths tried past but still packs punch taste wise  Best part broth overly salty some other ramen places   *cough* Monta *cough*  The only noodles available thinner egg style noodles regularly come tonkotsu ramen  Even though prefer thick noodles Ramen Sora!! noodles perfectly al dente soggy all   The egg always perfectly done yolk still half runny  Chashu bit well done compared prefer  love when delicious pork belly melts your mouth!  Soboro bowl seasoned minced meat egg rice green onions  Very simple dish  felt dish just okay really memorable something would crave  I'd liked bit more sauce juice gravy minced meat wouldn't dry   Karaage deep fried chicken  While very juicy fresh felt bit under seasoned    If intend come regularly sure stamp card your server  every four bowls ramen free appetizer gyoza karaage   Overall great service clean restaurant  definitely coming back more ramen try other bowls  <EOR> So another Japanese Ramen Ya graced city time ain't Chinatown! in mini mall Tokyo No East side UNLV where most students hang out  any case just opened once while good break away usual haunts I still love best Monta but wanna see others offer   Monogamy no place F B world when comes glutton   Fukumimi means 'Lucky Ear' when arrived off peak time period place crawling Japanese people first good sign    interior cheery warm environment aka actually looked someone put some thought into design   I appreciate that     good sign #2  I love when weather gets cold perfect time piping hot bowl full Ramen   particularly cold day Saturday running car into steam filled restaurant warm up!  Inside bright atmosphere new restaurant feel kinda new car   didn't want use smell reference    seated counter where could see all action   owner working line the Ramen component while another gentleman worked fryer both working furiously dish orders   I parked seat down bar stool hoping warm when realized much colder counter air vents blowing cold air counteract all steam emanating open kitchen I freezing time left   must remember eat Summer   and sit counter!!!

And when boiling hot cauldron noodle soup arrived front icicle hanging nose enveloped face into hot breath inhaling fatty oils feeding fifth sense   ordered Miso Tonkotsu blend find most palatable   My first visual long thick slices Pork Belly cut most unusual way which seen before Ramen not complaining ordered extra Chasu Pork practically whole bowl full score!!! As Broth the most important component Ramen humble opinion smooth lighter thought didn't unctuous almost greasy quality anticipate hope then somewhat regret eating buyer's remorse   case could finish soup sans regret   Now another Ramen Restaurant Vegas fold getting very interesting people decide favorites alliances formed friends become enemies families torn blah blah blah      just glad there's more choices already favorite list but  another post!  Ratings Out Five Stars Food 4 Ambience 4 Service 5 <EOR> Beware shape bowls!

I Tonkotsu Ramen soy flavor broth decent  wasn't big fan noodles I prefer monta's thicker noodles   broth came slice pork belly chashu half seasoned egg green onions bean sprouts piece seaweed   pork belly really big slice good proportion meat fat   would preferred whole egg but since included free soup isn't any complaints there  Everything else pretty standard  If wanted any extra toppings which did available EXTRA charge  say extra all caps because opinion some them bit pricey   I friend ordered Tonkotsu Ramen salt well karaage   broth tasted bit off black lines visible throughout  sure kind 'salt' used but guess type black salt? Update told 'black lines' black garlic oil   Looked pretty odd me  Oh soup also thick gooey texture top if let sit long   karaage pretty standard  Nice juicy should be!  I would definitely back try more items menu update review then  now give 3 stars due weird thickening top soup  wasn't really appetizing look your bowl see solid layer top  =X <EOR> This place when mood ramen! favorite Tonkotsu Spicy   girls always friendly chef nice  love reward system too! give card every time buy bowl ramen signature your fourth bowl free appetizer! place really favorites!

Also tender  highly recommend tonkatso miso ramen love nice thick broth  filled corn green onions medium boiled egg    The noodles nice chew it  soggy under cooked either  broth full flavor  pork nice consistency chewiness ramen all together full flavor    I also recommend fried gyoza side homemade kimchee  ramen  highly RECOMMEND Chasu bowl pork white rice ginger   delish full flavor  very subtle sweetness which love also very tender nicely marinated  think if ramen doesn't win over Monta I'd say Chasu bowl does    The vibe also brings nice grassroots local Japanese feel small establishment wooden seats specials hand written posted walls  location very off most typical Japanese restaurants bit way but if you're side town nice gap between classes UNLV would nice place lunch  yet try sesame broth which think also signature ramen bowls  fond sesame flavor though those flavors typically strong taste buds  If definitely let know is! <EOR> Came quick lunch boyfriend sick insisted something steamy help sinuses  Fukumimi Ramen choice choice great one!  The restaurant small but cramped per se making intimate atmosphere  surprisingly busy Monday afternoon but seated last open table almost immediately  imagine there's quite wait during dinnertime weekend!

Very small expect wait but well worth it   chicken based Ramen which delicious! Although only came 3 slivers chicken more enough food   opted extra egg which meant 3 total halves! also spicy paste which didn't really add any heat broth but Sriracha available doctored up    The 2 unsung hero's however house salad sesame ginger house dressing delicious although just greens dressing could eaten pound it! other unexpected hero kimchi  portion small but quite possibly some best kimchi ever had   good pretty sure could convert non kimchi liker into lover!    Definitely coming back some more Ramen kimchi! <EOR> I ordered fukumimi Ramen topped egg green onion dried paper seaweed pork chasu   noodles thin good chew held its texture till last bite   broth nice strong flavor overly salty  oils good sheen it  add more spice oils accommodate your own taste buds  pork pretty fatty egg more hard boiled having runny soft yolk    Try appetizers such Agedashi tofu gyoza honey garlic chicken! very much compliments your entire meal  Overall price bit steep get  portion size smaller most Ramen spots but still satisfied meal  still filled up  plus side bonus stamp card lead free appetizer when complete 10 visits  atmosphere welcoming overcrowded all  walk sit without having squeeze through your spot   P s  no dessert end your meal  Lol but always next door Baskin Robins ice cream after  <EOR> I Tori Ramen delicious!

Still nice chew them  favorite  friends also recommend Fukumini Ramen which sounded shio salt based broth  most popular bowl believe! also several rice bowls appetizers accompany your meal    Parking issue all since big strip mall  right next Baskin Robbins case lost! <EOR> I came when first opened issues plagued broth since initial launch yet addressed when came dinner couple nights ago  spicy miso ramen flavorless chashu similarly tough bland  broth foundation build upon any ramen but ultimately just ends tasting lukewarm water spices floating top instead imparting any flavor  chashu pork paradoxically needs ton salt even any taste  noodles nothing worth mentioning portions meager   Our server placed bowls edge table scoot center myself  attentive pouring water but made no sense why didn't place bowls front center us   Really Fukumimi needs revisit fundamentals building solid broth which build upon  would much gain learn Monta Jinya much richer flavorful dense broths tender salty pieces chashu larger potions   Until then Fukumimi isn't worth single visit  <EOR> Love Tonkontsu Ramen Chicken Karage !! soup base very rich chicken tender     will definitely come back again !! <EOR> They wonderful rich broth  run average price ramen around town nice drive other side strip good ramen  <EOR> Ordered karaage which served side lettuce  Unfortunately found substantial amount rotting wilted lettuce mixed greens  ordered fukumimi ramen broth quite good sweet rich while avoiding bitterness plague other restaurants  noodles bit undercooked liking require quick rinse avoid starchiness clouds flavor broth  Service prompt friendly  <EOR> My new favorite ramen place which perfect because live area yay!   place opened almost year now only twice first being August second visit few weeks ago  Kind odd see legitimate ramen place side town but always welcomed me! Since east side patrons eating more diverse unlike eateries Spring Mtn  which tend attrack mainly Asians   pretty small only handful tables last time came pretty packed  Service good both visits considering small area  ordered tonkatsu ramen both times it! particularly corn  prefer Fukumimi much more Monta but  just opinion  friend ordered Tantan really reminds Filipino karekare peanut butter stew little different but very similar  She enjoyed gave bite which delish remember  Last visit also chicken karaage good greasy  also love fact stamp card 4 ramens earns free karaage unfortunately didn't first visit else would gotten free karaage already!

Good portions good price  Great ramen  Curry good too! <EOR> I've lot Japanese noodle restaurants Vegas restaurant far worst   don't give lot    there's only piece meat soup broth tasteless          Try KABUKI Town Square you'll it     <EOR> Small yet inviting ramen specialty restaurant  Handful menu items wouldn't take more 3 mins choose from  Very flavorful thick miso soup base  ideal place lunch   I've eaten countless ramen places including Japan Korea Asia EU handful other states US   Bowl itself small but deep  immediately noticed ingredients noodles drowned soup when ramen bowl  working bowl felt disappointment all noodles gone 7 mouthful  Dont wrong soup base pretty good 4 5   For price average $8ish felt wasn't enough feel full satisfied Im skinny guy  Ratio between ingredients soup 1 2 5  found myself fishing solids spent twice longer trying myself full drinking soup  Extra ingredients little pricey add    I would loved if ratio 1 1 25  Little more generous portion noodles ingredients  actually think business better if things improve future   Best wishes  <EOR> I just moved Vegas craving ramen  originally Bay SF CA WOW! blown away  Bay Area some greatest ramen places tried trust fair share   Miami NY CA definitely par   I Tonkotsu Miso Ramen $8 20 kaarage which basically Japanese fried chicken  Super yummy delicious! three times far greeted great customer service each time    Highly highly recommend great ramen! <EOR> I haven't always liked ramen but must say really love place! try come atleast once month since work over airport its just 10min drive  favs fukumimi special agedashi tofu? Oh gaaaaaaaaawd  <EOR> Went girlfriend's late Saturday lunch place packed  Well does fill fast since seating very limited patient when go  ordered Fukumimi ramen shared honey garlic chicken  can't remember friends ordered but want back order again!!! <EOR> This new go to ramen house  am amazed quality food service  place small but worth food  Portion sizes little small but able full off bowl   The waiters friendly welcoming  definitely recommend place everyone  back! <EOR> I am quite amazed Fukumimi impressed me  friend started karaage wow! definitely brought back some memories  aunt's tasted if didn't order ramen could've ordered more! Now onto ramen ordered Tonkotsu Shio salt friend miso  thought much garlic oil bowl but didn't foul ramen no complaints  noodles thin kind big fan Sora's thick noodles but long noodles cooked perfectly all good neighborhood  broth delicious  rich flavorful  never finish drinking soup any noodle bowl ramen udon pho etc  but first time finally reached bottom  also taste friend's miso broth thought pretty tasty well  much intend order miso next visit  miso fan serious haha! friend disappointed wasn't togarashi available  thought standard condiment ramen  come back several more times finally decide which favorite ramen ya    ON SIDE NOTE feel Monta overrated since dominated ramen scene Vegas long time now  People forget alternatives other executions ramen die hard Monta lovers become stagnant taste profile said it   Maybe just feeling way because last three times within span 2 years broth always freaking salty! Even mini bowls also salty  But always willing come back hoping fixed salt happy ways actually broth way when first opened  miss old Monta!! <EOR> Eh Fukumimi isn't bad  But doesn't satisfy craving ramen  Broth just OK charsiu isn't best town  I'd much rather drive down spring mountain dine Monta Sora Ramen   It's located somewhat sketchy area  wouldn't come alone dark  On brighter note karrage chicken bomb  Better Jinya's  hot juicy crispy just right amount fat inside  I'd come back that  But taste other ramen dishes  Next time give cold ramen try  <EOR> Love fukumimi! replacement monta since closed hendo location  say give way more noodles other places which amazing  Only problem wait staff just aren't most attentive  also little dirty too  But ramen always point  <EOR> I did chicken karaage mini salad came ps  dressing salad awesome   However ramen wasn't super memorable  the broth salty kind hard past that  menu somewhat limited ramen some appetizers drinks  <EOR> We tired waiting Monta reopen Henderson     found Fukumimi absolutely amazing!!! favorite new spot!! Ramen delicious also try karaage pork bowl  good!! <EOR> Hole in the wall always excellent friendly service garlic chicken awesome  <EOR> Really good Ramen feels very authentic Japanese Restaurant  enjoyed soup only knocked off star because wasn't good favorite ramen place Austin called Michi  Very affordable pricing refreshing stop visit Las Vegas  answer broth   it! <EOR> Solid 4 stars   Cheap quick friendly service tons parking     For some reason thought chicken curry would fried chicken cutlet but just pieces chicken curry sauce little disappointing but huge deal   Shared bowl ramen along tasty   Definitely give place try also inexpensive  <EOR> We came lunch   no wait food delicious   Extra ramen $1 00 which awesome  Waitresses friendly service pretty quick   highly recommend place your ramen cravings  <EOR> Definitely ramen place town! Hands down favorite  broth salty but also flavorless   Downside located East side near UNLV bit drive anyone area  Also venue quite small expect wait if you're going around dinner time especially weekend   Generally speaking waits aren't long  think most ever wait 20 25 minutes but party 6 such teeny place   Do note place does include bar option sit if no tables available  Onto food    Well tried just every ramen plate menu labelled spicy each every one  personally prefer thin noodles over thick ones may notice some bias favorite dishes hint they're all thin noodles   Luckily menus table should list thin thick   My favorite dishes order 1  Kogashi menu describes fragrant flavored ramen 100% true  Drinking broth side side other flavors ramen broth strong flavor which personally prefer  topped fragrant garlic oil fried onion  favorite  If garlic y onion y flavors bet your favorite but trust isn't overpowering still delish 2  Tonkotsu prefer soy over salt though salt good   simply but very delicious  Again Fukumimi because unlike other ramen places broth salty but same time still enough flavor enjoy! 3  Fukumimi Ramen say most popular dish maybe because name restaurant? way this!   This place stamp card loyal guests rewarded free karaage which Japanese fried chicken lemon juice also very delicious! <EOR> Great food price   Ramen better average although bit more salty liked  However did order tonkasu salt ramen   Fried chicken good   Chasu rice bowl very good   Server nice quick    Would back again!  Thanks! <EOR> Respectable ramen joint  Service fast friendly  customer loyalty punch card which cool those live close jones Ramen regularly  only complaint sewage smell smacked face soon walked can't really hold against them cuz knows deal was obnoxious loud pop music playing   But yes Rhiana shine bright diamond while slurp noodles  <EOR> First off am die hard Sora ramen fan  when wife wanted Fukumimi skeptical first  place small atmosphere nothing note    like typical japanese ramen house  ordered spicy miso ramen without reading description menu my fault   didnt realize ramen didnt come nori corn which im fan ramen  noodle good noodles Sora nice thick perfectly al dente  spicy miso broth alittle sweetness kind disliked but still delicious  Sora much better spicy miso broth opinon  why did give them 5 stars might ask? fukumimi ramen which wife ordered friggin delcious! broth super hearty flavorful  dont know if spicy version soup but if im there  highly recommend fukumimi ramen  When im east side town want Ramen Fukumimi's spot! <EOR> Tantanmen Chashu bowl I ordered tantanmen hit spot  best broth but still good  Personally  tasted tad peanutty but still something I'd order again  Noodles aren't freshly made but cooked al dente its ok  loved really Chashu bowl  Just thinking hungry! Awesome service five stars    All all try tantanmen chashu bowl  won't disappoint  tonkotsu ramen good well  place definitely must try! <EOR> This place always provides decent quality real Japanese ramen other appetizers  And cost performance believe beating anyone class taste!!!  Japanese come twice row which sense really good <EOR> After reading few reviews very excited try ramen place way back LA  Arriving sometime early afternoon group 7 people immediately seated back    The waitress very nice rest staff also seemed very friendly  However less impressed food    Gyoza many people raved dumplings reviews thought must try thing  personal opinion gyoza less appetizing frozen pot stickers purchase Costco   Mini Chashiu Bowl think meat topped rice could even called meat   let alone pork  rice also tasted bit over cooked soggy     Ramen broth good but nothing worth travelling to  noodles mediocre only really great thing rave bowl soft boiled egg think harder mess egg delicious!   If really close there's nothing else really want then coming OK  But if fence would maybe try another place  really wasn't anything stood here  <EOR> YES! finally Ramen spot East Side Vegas well South East but take it!  Food Kara age Japanese Fried Chicken 5 5 Very delicious comes side mixed greens house dressing grey salt  actually didn't even need grey salt because Karaage already lightly salted but nice compliment gourmet salts      Fukumimi Miso Ramen 4 5 LOVED broth very smooth flavorful without super saltiness Monta although still love Monta   If know read reviews know SPICY  drown soup sesame oil Japanese chilli power Togarashi  Tamago egg delicious! just wished soaked marinade bit longer looked very light but still delicious  soft boil perfect yolky  Cashu pork equally delicious soft just wish gave more just 1 slice but much felt if order extra 3+slices would've over top    Service 4 5 It surprisingly empty when around 5pm Saturday but staff still very nice attentive even if slow  waitress very nice explain questions very well  Except table didn't any straws waters friend said other tables given straws  dislike drinking water restaurants rim cup where multiple people mouths too  lol  Location 5 5 Love location East Las Vegas needs some Asian flavors  Seriously its hard find sushi restaurant anything area  say PRIME SPOT!

WHAT? Why menu if serve let alone carry it? eat ramen accompany gioza! ordered tan tan mein noodles much anticipation  When bowl arrived bowl looked liked poured milk it  noodles creamy?!?! Real tan tan mein noodles composed spicy broth spicy milky broth if curry  understand many versions tan tan mein but wayyyyy creamy ground pork alright but did great consistency bit sand opinion  tan tan mein fix if anyone knows better place please tell  <EOR> Must faith find place  woke craving ramen looks Yelp place good 10mins away  much menu choose from    Pretty simple which like  order tantan men because seen someone Yelp mention it   glad did    ramen damn good    appitzer rice curry good enough just order alone  making regular spot    Especially long night drinking <EOR> All friends raved I'd say options thick versus think noodles along different broth options unique  love creativity twists broths expect surprised!   I would give place more 3 5 honest wasn't exactly fan broth had  Something felt missing   I spicy tonkstsu ramen maybe spicy overkill point could appreciate broth itself eating  spicy just masked all other flavors ramen  Could causing why giving 5   Noodles definitely fresh perfectly chewy  good! Next time back try thin noodles thick ones bit overwhelming well   Either way does warrant another visit verify but believe first impressions   Things look for They lines monta if come early do    No reservations   It's shady part city near empty plaza  sign didn't turn trouble finding it  way next ice cream shop side grocery store! <EOR> So going place while  Now only Ramen restaurant now  usually Spicy Tonkotsu  downside pretty small restaurant busy times but wait times aren't long  <EOR> The place hole wall but all food delicious  would definitely recommend anyone want try something different!!! <EOR> This vegas ramen hit spot  Vegas strip but definitely taste better lot strip foods  Prices typical ramen spot prices  But faves tried   Worth drive  Some wait  Delicious <EOR> Tried place while biz trip   Food quality decent price reasonable service good   would come back again light quick dinner  <EOR> Today's visit first time here    ordered Tantan Men honey garlic chicken   I wasn't sure white stuff drizzled top chicken was    When found mayonnaise quickly told them put any yuck   When food came pleasantly surprised good tender chicken was    come back just dish alone  ramen noodles okay    broth spices delish    found myself ignoring noodles just drinking broth  charge extra if want them prepare spicier normal    charge extra just everything even water    the service okay greeted when walked everyone nice     kind where stopped  flag waitress down each time need something never checked during meal  Overall everything pretty good  If come back it'll to go only    <EOR> Ramen 110 Vegas Summer Day misty humid evening prejudice year long ramen  hit almost every spot but there's always something jumping come back however think Fukimimi might exception  only twice but everything tried good  Agedashi tofu Fukimimi ramen honey garlic chicken very Japanese style don't assume karaage chicken ramen gyoza  Yes tried almost entire menu LOL  hope add apple juice menu children expand possibly even smaller most already small ramen spots! <EOR> the venu look way better kitchen dining area two sheets blankets covering kitchen part  barely any space but dueable  custmer service good but could better checking simple refills drinks  garlic chicken appetitizer spicy meso ramen entre         starters garlic chicken very fatty crispy which should be  dressing gets drizzled top chicken really compliments crispy chicken!

brother lived Japan said ramen authentic reminded being back there  <EOR> I actually prefer place over ever popular monta  always fukumimi jinya to  If feeling hungrier usual always Fukumimi Ramen  comes bean sprouts 3 pieces seaweed extra pieces chashu green onions half egg thin noodles  Price point wise think more your money place other shops  There's usually always wait if around 7p 6 if don't want wait but does fairly fast  Try gyoza agedashi tofu  also best stamp system seen  4 bowls ramen bam! free appetizer  Pretty simple achieve    just never remember bring stamp card lose it  restaurant most random plaza next nothing basically tgey still busy   when know place good  <EOR> Strip mall whattttt   people trolling storefront but once inside legit Japanese noodle house  Warm clean inviting    Staff humble menu easy understand good options just wish menu traditional pictures    ordered Miso ramen only complaint could scarfed down ten pounds Pork    Price met value only complaint its small watch say your neighbors hear haha   back  <EOR> Definitely best raven ever U S  soup extremely rich much flavor  Highly recommend place  <EOR> Two stars based comparison other ramen bars to   Its cute little neighborhood noodle house but soup just barely passing  soup very basic  Nothing special   gross inedible   just nothing special   Would come back    nah   Id rather stick Monta Chaya Jinya  <EOR> WOW best tantanmen karaage town!! small little place old plaza next baskin N robbins ice cream place  Real authentic japanese ramen found here  Price fair food obliviously good  try come every week but its little far distance place but if close would heading every DAY!!!! <EOR> Ordered miso ramen  service speedy  broth seasoned perfectly  noodles soft firm  forgot add egg  prices decent  only thing would change place leasing bigger building  <EOR> My boyfriend wanted simple soupy dinner before heading airport found spot off strip decent price  ramen $8 20 which reasonably priced  waited around 10 minutes before seated since dinner time started packed  seated ready order Kogashi Fukumimi ramen  garlic oil broth super rich thin noodles deliciously paired flavorful chashu  fried garlic pieces  egg bit saltier end but still good  boyfriend also liked ramen spot definitely solid  wanted hot tea since windy cold today but unfortunately only sell cold drinks  Would recommend if want solid ramen meal  <EOR> This may just East Coast talking but better ramen before  hankering for  Ramen because sniffles Las Vegas work  quick Yelp search flat tire later finally found them  guy behind counter gracefully trying remove belligerent vagrant entered place  He could mean she swearing storm but he calm kind which really made good impression me    But vagrant relations purpose visit food!  karaage Japanese fried chicken bits $3 90 tantan men pork miso sesame paste ramen $8 95   Both superb price right    My craving satisfied no angry homeless people blocking exit left happy customer  <EOR> My friend recommended Fukumimi really excited try ramen! But all base Tonkotsu mixed additional flavor such soy shoyu miso salt shio etc  didn't really solid flavor  ordered Tonkotsu Miso Ramen wasn't quite sure main flavor just all jumbled together    We also ordered appetizers Gyoza chicken karaage  absolutely love karaage super excited try them! But EXTREMELY salty bite drank more half water had  salty when ate ramen all salt flavor  tongue still burning home drink several more bottles water rid burn had  painful never wanted eat karaage again    The waiters okay never asked anything but weren't rude mean  Just very friendly? really disappointed Fukumimi probably never come again  <EOR> I love place come almost weekly Boulder City salad agedashi tofu  best ramen place far! <EOR> Went Fukumimi lunch some friends having converted delicious joys ramen Monta earlier winter  While can't say Fukumimi quite much Monta wonderful delicious ramen very fast   Pros Unlike Monta wait maybe 5 minutes opposed 45  Prices very very reasonable full happy less $10 Seriously delicious toppings most ramen comes them already added don't need look confused white person quite much   Cons Something thinner firmer noodles compared Monta just wasnt enjoyable  Almost little salty broth  Either way definitely coming back again when towards Henderson once winter once more  <EOR> Pros closer house china town  Cons little salty only type noodle thin kind expensive portion don't gyoza! <EOR> Great food but third time brought only orders say didn't know ordered two things   why would watch other person eat lol  changed way order just case fault might've heard but alas happened third time  verge losing some regular customers  together please  used love recommending place people   Update friends said last visit chicken served raw   <EOR> After seeing many great reviews hearing great things Fukumimi bf decided give try  Ramen favorite dishes always trying new places  thought maybe would able find new ramen spot  When first looked menu surprised low prices lowest seen  Especially coming corn chashu?! thought awesome  ordered Tonkatsu miso ramen nori which server didn't refer nori seemed bit confused until she realized seaweed     After short wait being served realized why prices low  bowls really small actually don't much food them all  first sip broth sadly let down  almost no flavor  entire bowl maybe 10 kernels corn 1 piece chashu  wish known  would've asked extra paid extra  bf ordered Kara miso spicy miso ramen he disappointed  broth tasted hot sauce  He ordered chashu bowl well honestly more excited that   After finishing food awkwardly waited 15 minutes someone come back bring check  new server even took couple's order next ignored took care two other tables before she acknowledged brought check    There honestly nothing special here  ramen tastes instant really hope ramen Japan something better offer place  left feeling very unsatisfied  <EOR> *SUPER* SMALL PORTIONS ZERO SPICINESS  I'm really unhappy meal here    First ordered tan tan men  menu said spicy  asked spicy sauce  waitress gave some chilli flakes zero spice  Then ordered chilli PASTE  paste wasn't spicy either! pretty much gochujang just made soup sweeter  I literally finished noodles under 5 minutes!! few small bites bowl then done  shocked!   I ordered another bowl because wasn't even full yet  I don't even eat much btw Then spicy miso  spicy either    !! egg pork good broth sucked! hurried ate there    I spent $20 full small girl small appetite   Oh guess what? charged  50 'spicy' paste    What joke   <EOR> Still consistently amazing  bring all visitors something new  No complaints hit all friends never real Ramen before    and no little cheap salty  processed Ramen packs grocery nowhere near same  If think then need visit Fukumimi  <EOR> Noodles inconsistent quality  Half well cooked while half little cooked    My first time last time here  Never back <EOR> Wow just wow  many wrong things ramen  Compared LA just falls really short  Hadn't eaten ramen while since moved LA  Thought place would good place try cuz good reviews  ordered spicy signature ramen  First all price bowl small portions small  coming girl    Seriously only slice pork? Didn't know pork expensive   ? They're wasn't any ginger chili oil   ordered spicy   but just plain salty  normal? quality ramen noodles also very disappointing  tasted looked instant noodles buy market  only hope other ramen places Vegas better this  <EOR> Got Kogashi ramen  Omigurd   so garlicky savory  definitely back try other flavors  Plenty noodles just right amount meat green onions half hard boiled egg  much finish sitting but weird    The service perfunctory  Neither bad nor great  restaurant must sushi bar its past life because  set up  Small no frills many decorations much character  loud 90s pop overpowering conversations completely different station blasting kitchen making disconcerting stereo effect dizzy   The ramen alone however enough bring back  order next time  <EOR> Came Saturday night man friend pleasantly surprised emptiness restaurant   really hate waiting   doesn't? Any who   already knew wanted before coming here     Karaage _ everyone already said   delish!!! Crispy but oily good portion !  Fukumimi ramen_ asked add some garlic oil but don't know if even made difference  thought pretty tasty   Pretty rich but porky   overly salty Monta's     Noodles cooked perfectly   Tan Tan Men_ first time trying dish thought pretty good   some sort deep nutty flavor it   don't really nuts much LOL good just stealing couple bites bf Kimchi_ BF really liked kimchi haha more fresher variety didn't fermented sour taste like     Nice waitresses chefs fast service!
