Totally unbearable The only explanation system shut down loose all orders especially mine!! Last time proposed shake money back but no getting near wanted just burger some French fries!!! My conclusion Don't order midnight!! <EOR> I'm originally St  Louis love Steak 'n Shake   Unfortunately experience location extremely disappointing   took probably 15 minuets seated even though half restaurant empty   Ordered cheeseburger fries shake   girlfriend ordered Frisch melt fries   When order came very disappointed find shoestring fries normally Steak 'n Shake   also asked fries cooked crispy well done   crispy!  Frisco melt supposed come toasted sourdough bun   bread barely toasted   told manager going come talk but never did   I wanted show girlfriend Steak 'n Shake better but Steak 'n Shake worst fast food establishment ever to   This place highly unorganized needs reboot!!! <EOR> Probably worst place could eat Vegas  only thing worse quality food service  Please yourself favor stay away  <EOR> Horrible experience came grab quick bit ordered 1 burger fries  45 min passed when asked see much more take waitress came back told 20 30 more min  place empty! when told think might somewhere she said ok cancel order stormed off    I mean guess can't expect anything more place this  <EOR> I excited put Steak 'n Shake close where work way home well  excited until there   The restaurant just off casino  Smoke everywhere  Open 24 hours arrived around 11 30 pm  place messy very messy  no host stand where sign stated wait seating items floor tables bussed  Finally acknowledged seated  Server breezily came said she would just moment  restaurant busy That moment turned into 6 minutes  left  Also menu quite different South Point restaurant  told counter server franchised some liberties    If craving S S drive down South Point  <EOR> Waitress needs improvement waitress  made four trips take order still forgot ordered overall food good  lot employees doing nothing <EOR> I visited Steak Shake since college 20+ years   When realized across street MGM Grand quickly made plans for dinner  Food great  Service attentive but hampered lengthy  time between ordering receiving food 1 hour 10 minutes then waiting shakes 35 minutes time ordered   Restaurant only third full weekday evening  know location having soft opening may fully speed pun intended but need act together  <EOR> I ALWAYS LOVED Steak n Shake!! Being military seperates quite often but while visiting Las Vegas weekend remembered could once again live best life favorite restaraunt    and was Perfectly nestled entrance Hooters Hotel Steak N Shake greeted warm hug  favorite sandwhich delicious parmesean fries cocoa krispies shake life complete!!

Thank Anthony!! <EOR> We came Saturday St  Patrick's Day second day soft opening  seated right away  nice server took order immediately accommodated request eg if could grill onions guacamole burger instead raw specified want burgers made etc server asked cook gladly accommodated requests  Service fast efficient friendly  Even offered 'to go' cups when server noticed could finish humongous shakes   Food very good what's expected Steak 'n Shake   The Staff  still ironing some bumps encounter which expected still soft opening  Cashier couldn't take gift cards  yet but stated future   Overall come back recommend friends family  really tasty burgers delicious shakes very reasonable price place very clean really spacious the Biggest Steak 'n Shake world! And excellent service! <EOR> I during opening week  food great quality  But prices expensive but considered strip didn't mind  <EOR> I burger take counter  wait wait waiting 10 minutes finally hostess comes over ask if able food within 6 7 minutes she laughs says no   So ask manager he tells some excuse slammed should 2 people there  person would enough! Saturday night especially fight just happened MGM  Staff your restaurant properly day week time day    Alas cannot properly tell if food any good    This first visit didn't Steak N' Shake   last  <EOR> Dismal best  No signage staff indicating seated  30 minute wait seated  at dirty table  10 minutes later someone wiped table thought menus clean wet table  taking order Waitress nice long chat next table none which food then place order  When food finally arrived mediocre best wife's order wrong  Waitress blamed cooks but receipt showed clearly she entered wrong  All all epic fail  Never again  advise anyone reads skip location entirely  <EOR> First time Steak Shake food very good hamburgers fries  Saw some folks eating good looking salads  prices quite reasonable especially Vegas  eat again  <EOR> Super nice staff very attentive! Food served within 10 15 minutes prime burger excellent  Try cherry limeade  <EOR> Overall new location nive spacious   really way inside looks   Food would expect Steak'n Shake   obvious opening night staff working things out   However all very friendly   location better South Point   Only downside local down strip   guess  plus tourists wanting decently priced burger  <EOR> Good burgers but server terrible  Unnecessary attitude she really slow  Very disappointing  <EOR> Great food even better service! Damaris H  awesome  Really attentive all around wonderful server  Definitely pleasure having server  First time coming most definitely recommended others  Burgers delicious service fantastic  Can't wait back! <EOR> My second interaction Steak 'n Shake  ordered Triple Steakburger shoestring fries  really hate shoestring fries wish use steak fries instead    all named business Steak n' Shake  ordered two Steakburger shoestring fries coffee  Coffee $2 45 free refills  Steak 'n Shake new coffee shop alone especially since Hooter's free Wi Fi  two orders Triple Steakburger enough fill up  appetite velociraptor attitude match  say Steak n' Shake worth going breakfast lunch dinner anytime day  am satisfied favorite casino Hooter's  <EOR> Slow    as     heck!!!!  mess rootbeer float?
