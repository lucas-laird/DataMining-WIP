Oreo shake tastes better chocolate shake very rich   I won't returning  <EOR> I twice now  Once own once wife  own able seat counter right away  wife made effort line 10 30am could sat soon open  When going expect wait  very popular good reason  located Planet Hollywood north end casino    Service excellent both times  burgers extremely flavorful  bun delicious  many good options choose from    On visit wife Gordon himself actually stopped in  very impressed first thing he did walk around shake every single employee's hand thank them  Clearly good guy work if your job right    Plan accordingly wait think find place worth it  Plus 30 minute wait really no big deal  <EOR> My gf hour before show going start wanted grab something eat  walked over Planet Hollywood saw no line 6pm  gf craving burger always wanted eat off went  wait 5 minutes which avoided sitting chef's table  Normally love sit chef's table but table different  sat right next where servers roll silverware  staff would dump silverware into bucket nails chalkboard over over again  did best ignore but tough sure  looked back outside now line 20 people!   The benefit sitting chef's table see all food comes out  addition plenty staff help if need more drinks items just questions  When server greeted he immediately let know 30 40 minute wait food  decided chance order food possibly missing few minutes show  Plus most places over estimate those times cover themselves usually half time    We decided w specialty burger day which only certain amount of  sharing due knowing if only serve particular days week certain months if time thing  wouldn't want your hopes up  addition burger ordered 'Hells Kitchen' burger asadero cheese roasted jalapeños avocado roasted tomatoes jalapeño aioli  We kept watching food come hoping ours  starting close 30 40 minute mark  hadn't see server since dropping off drinks taking order  magic he appeared when food arrived  which quickly asked check  manger duty came apologize wait ask if needed anything else  informed lack attention server gave sat waters weren't refilled during time them until time burgers   Once started digging into burgers realized worth wait  Typically hard wow w burger particular price but maaaaaaaaaaan burgers good! specialty $25 Hells Kitchen burger $16  Both well worth wait price    If craving burger strip def check place out!

Located Planet Hollywood place casual sports bar vibe along open kitchen people all different ages group sizes eating busy restaurant  started meal parmesan truffle fries which came spiced ketchup truffle aioli side  didn't find fries particularly special distinct lack truffle aroma flavor but truffle aioli chock full amazing umami unctuousness though ketchup just dominated sweetness   And then came for  the burgers! Hell's Kitchen burger must order came melted asadero cheese roasted jalapenos roasted tomatoes jalapeno aioli avocado  Plenty fire spiciness indeed and burger itself nice juicy but otherwise flavors burger weren't all interesting bun turned overly greasy butter  much preferred Forest burger which came salty tremor cheese forest mushrooms arugula duck bacon  flavors burger very umami thanks mushroom cheese bacon combination refreshing arugula worked very nicely! Again however bun way more greasy necessary   The burgers Gordon Ramsay good but can't say best necessarily worth celebrity chef price tag  won't rush come back but perhaps some Gordon Ramsay's other restaurants Vegas would worth try! <EOR> Came Sunday Night late line short but wait 15 minutes   Young female hostesses laughing things life customers wait even greeting estimate anything  definitely felt no caring customer wished Gordon Ramsay walked causing hostesses stand attention people seated  burgers excellent maybe best ever tasted but onion rings 100% done bit doughy inside  price hamburgers would treated little bit more respect   Just feeling anyone cared  <EOR> I'm huge GR fan first visit restaurants  However pretty disappointed    My waitress asked wanted burger done said well done  don't pink burger  grosses out  ordered Hells Kitchen burger  also ordered truffle Parmesan fries  cocktails very strong! yummy   In less 4 minutes burger fries came out  burger looked delicious until bit into it  raw could mush all thought moment cow literally walking bc rare clearly am obsessed Ramsay   However ingredients definitely fresh bun perfect  avocado huge impossible eat burger without making mess  mushed avocado then put burger  No big deal because delicious generous amount avocado  fries bit dry somewhat crunchy needed some salt but tasted good once dipped them ketchup  bunch French fries share $11    I ate brown enough  waitress said manager took care burger which really generous  would come back sure  But would probably choose different burger hopefully well done next time Vegas  <EOR> This best burgers far   loved ambience place   amazing over prized all   Burgers ranging 15 22  Also try wings fries apps  <EOR> BurGR always staple during all Vegas trips  When passed most recent visit saw rebranded Gordon Ramsay Burger little surprised but total sense seeing GR seems taking over strip new places   The menu revamped  definitely new items aren't Total Rewards discounts anymore  shakes also redone aren't just named numbers anymore  All being said quality food just good was  Juicy medium rare burgers heapings mouthwatering toppings just barely fit into your mouth   Farmhouse Burger  Still classic go to  juicy burger topped bacon fried egg  know just case burger itself wasn't enough protein you  bacon upgraded duck bacon mangalitsa bacon which we're told kobe beef pork  What's mangalitsa ask?

Probably most absurd thing even though $95 person sent list set menus couple three course meals $70 80 each  means pay $1500 front? means every person drink? Well 5 children couple family members don't drink   So when tried talk Sales Manager Heather she just happens vacation week  popular Gordon Ramsay name can't believe function when someone tries book party ahead time  There's no way going pay money ahead time food haven't ate can't believe people actually would  Even though expect great food great service people's business all takes person bad day ruin experience  expect pay advance? <EOR> Always wanted try this  Went lunch   Quick seating if sat bar   What Ramsays restaraunts menu shows ingredients  knowing plate   Had bleu cheese burger which lovely truffle fries which fine    I would recommend anyone willing eat burger fries 30 dollar budget <EOR> I'm giving restaurant only star because expectations high best gourmet burgers ever   Coming Midwest where best beef world expected gourmet build perfect juicy tasty burger which even know cook    also very excited see poutine menu husband birthplace poutine Montreal GR could only better right?

But Patriot Burger amazingggg!   Because celebrity chef owner line long  put your name down they'll text when your table ready  basically means time gamble casino shop around stores nearby    Would come back? Probably but if find yourself dragged Patriot Burger  only worth menu  <EOR> I'm never down wait more 30 minutes food if you're impatient then SKIP long line order burgers to go    Food wise Hell's Kitchen burger definitely lives name  usually wheat bun along patty done medium well  burger comes huge pieces avocado jalapeño aioli which comes surprising but tasty kick  Everything cooked perfection burger itself just effortlessly melts your mouth  However huge fan fries  Think thick cut steak fries soggier side no seasoning all  even pinch salt pepper lacking some love I'd say  Plus curry ketchup very much acquired taste  flavors just didn't mix well all opinion  Skip fries but Hell's Kitchen burger must  <EOR> This location save few bucks compared some other options area but if you're careful definitely blow your wallet   The burgers really top notch quality! Lamb burger super juicy moist! Just prepared fork over some cash   The irish nachos subpar cheese sauce amazing but pork inedible chunks fat them  <EOR> Going bit skeptic having burned celebrity chefs past but anniversary special burger unique flavorful while onion rings verifiably TDF!!

Me if buy them here  Beer selection really good  The blue burger well above average  <EOR> I found best burger spot ever! many options which typical  knew pescatarian could find both veggie burger lobster shrimp burger! Resturant waiting line most time Resturant very busy however staff very attentive happy anything needed!  defiantly seek Ramsay Resturant NYC next month   Resturant decor may scare someone off because presentation would lead believe would very expensive        but honestly menu priced quite modestly quality food exceeded expectations!

Cool restaurant seated quickly being prime dinner hours! Hells Kitchen burger Crown burger both excellent awesome flavors textures  say most popular Hells Kitchen burger but personally liked crown little better! going more Gordon Ramsey's restaurants future!! <EOR> Solid burger joint man myth legend Gordon Ramsay slapping name famous  seated immediately because 2 30 afternoon but warned isn't large restaurant wait time bad  ordering burgers take 30 minutes come option your fries coming before your burger    My fiancé Hog Heaven which pork burger BBQ pork tons other meaty toppings  Although he huge appetite he could only polish off little more half  ordered Patriot Burger which turkey burger smoked Gouda cherry chutney spicy mayo crunchy topping  LOVED peeling off over half bun totally able finish mine  fries tasty found more enough share order    I would certainly back during non peak times but interested steakhouse now too! <EOR> Had try Golden Ramsay time! Located inside casino line super long even weekday early! believe if 3 more people bypass line front check hostess  honest expected more restaurant named Gordon Ramsay  Waitresses nice but sort unprofessional talking calling sick such  Also service slow know busy but shouldn't take 10 minutes just order water  Food took over 45 minutes ordered which bit long  looking forward chicken burger but replaced some other burger disappointed  ended getting cheese burger which pretty good wish came side fries which ordered separately   <EOR> Excellent burger here  Wait pretty serious here  They text when your table ready within 10 minutes show unless give your table next  happened us   So wait another 45 minutes but worth it! It located side Planet Hollywood  <EOR> I honestly underwhelmed restaurant   If Gordon Ramsay actually hope he would sent food back   I don't know burger bacon egg cheese bland but managed it   patty itself seriously underseasoned which sad burger   fries thick wedge style also completely devoid any salt actually did send back because tasty all   It wasn't good burger definitely worth waiting 40 minutes line for  <EOR> Well waited line long time good burger but certaintly won't eat again  still just burger  fries onion rings different typical place far above average  say seats surprisingly comfortable  Otherwise louder more crowded would sitting casino tables all day  server excellent other servers all helped each other out  <EOR> Wasn't overly impressed place   thought 25 dollar burger would amazing but just tasted very beefy   couldn't taste anything else burger   say serving fries burgers huge   definitely way much food  <EOR> I wait 1 hour seat another hour food but food delicious hamburger great natchos really yummy! think  he should open another location would crazy busy reason give 4 stars 5 because wait joke  <EOR> We waited almost Hour seated which took even longer time food   minus 1 star A menu present near initial line able decide food even before reached table   The FARMHOUSE BURGER great though fried egg could little more runny  proteins blended together create very satisfying taste  The HELL's KITCHEN BURGER super delicious yet heavy midst all goodness! Avocado + jalapeños great combo Both burgers worth wait  But sure I'd come again short visit entire experience takes LOT time  Could due popularity its Vegas all! <EOR> Great atmosphere good service best burgers ever had  try Gordon Ramsay restaurant while town opted burgers lunch  most family friendly place wouldn't take little kids but older kids just fine  fries excellent two orders fed six group  Try Hog Burger if your challenge think upscale Cheeseburger Paradise  <EOR> I Hell's Kitchen burger kettle chips nachos beef  nachos great kettle chips mixed sauce beef great blended taste   The burger however major disappoint! All could taste avocado  took over entire taste burger  bun soft delicious but everything else inside not  patty cooked just liked but couldn't enjoy because dominant avocado taste   Came disappointment place wasn't anything special <EOR> I typically am basic burger but branched little here  ordered Farmhouse Burger which bacon egg cheese   I disappointed! also truffle fries which great! People traveling loved sauce dip came fries  <EOR> Everything exceptional  think meal mouth starting water    RECOMMENDATION if you're going small party even another guest would recommend getting two different burgers splitting them  many delicious options pass on!   Truffle fries thicker cut fry sprinkled parmesan cheese comes ketchup another dipping sauce  Perfect sharing perfectly cooked meaning weren't soggy over cooked  other dipping sauce touch garlic which made French fry experience much better    Blue cheeseburger Holy mother flavors  Comes blue cheese manchego fig jam cider vinegar reduction spicy mayo  first bite last explosion flavor  sweetness fig jam compliments savory two different cheeses while heat mayo gives extra kick didn't even know needed  far best burgers ever had    Hell's Kitchen burger more classic style burger extra heat  opted roasted jalapeños but jalapeño aioli more enough bring burger notch  <EOR> The presentation establishment nice even if no thought environmental impact taken into account 24 hours day flames  fries tasted stale burger meat bit dry side  <EOR> Literally BEST burger ever life! still salivate thinking it  <EOR> Shouldn't hard rate establishment  While would rated higher if comparing Guy Fieri's place night before  became number all time ever visiting Gordon Ramsey's Burgr Guy's still number 1  fact sorry can't say Gordon's all time number 2  Don't wrong good  But best    So if best compared you  think happy honest burger opinion    <EOR> Second time trying burger place very impressive again  truffle parmesan fries foie burger  could taste foie gras spread  patty cooked perfectly but quite bland  fries thick cut really crispy lack truffle flavors  tried friends onion rings surprisingly good  Sorry but worth over hour wait   <EOR> Go burger! Ha! place self explanatory  flames very eye catching mesmerizing motion draw towards long line people waiting bite mouth flavoring burgers    It's conveniently located near entrance which great if want avoid cigarette smoke when walking through casino area  <EOR> I'm torn place  love Gordon Ramsay perhaps expectations high  burger good but value wait wasn't worth it  First only burger price  No fries side items  deal but $15 20 burger  Second desserts sucked  some pudding tasted very plain 99 cent pudding  line very long waited but if place popular kudos them  staff nice place clean no complaints department  fire pit thing front nice touch well  would give place 3 5 good great considering name has  <EOR> This good burger  best had? No  meat great flavor but dry me  did ask cooked well done probably mistake  always meat well done very juicy burgers  But wasn't way  loved batter onion rings but Parmesan cheese added top    it made salty  Service outstanding  would eat again  <EOR> I high expectations considering Gordon Ramsey's name it  burgers outstanding we farmhouse ultimate cooked perfection  truffle fries definitely sharing size don't let $11 price tag deter you  beer selection could little better but some decent staples  Now great   the service  Even 16 year old recognized server clueless  He kept forgetting said seemed totally distracted  relatively new place but perhaps bit more training would help  <EOR> Atmosphere fun service great    The onion rings big hit table  Unfortunately two three burgers ordered overcooked  Outside good restaurant fun place eat  <EOR> We Hell's kitchen burger Butter Pecan Milkshake Beer battered onion Rings   Onion Rings good could improved portion though   The burger best ever had  2 cents  Add Roasted Jalapeno   The milkshake good ! 2 them day definitely worth 2000 calories though Highly recommend !

The food itself played beautifully  chicken bit dry  But say very much pleased flavor design  idea creme brule milkshake brilliant twist classic beverages! delicious  chicken sandwich made feel journey Mediterranean almost gyro burger but without tsatziki sauce   The onion rings also great dipping sauces good too  <EOR> Excellent service food well worth 45 minute wait had  ordered truffle fries hot wings burger foie gras sure hat name all delicious   Probably best truffle fries ever quality burger top notch  would definitely recommend place back next time town  <EOR> The first time 2013 fell love place  Food superb every time come vegas sure eat here  Suggestions come time open don't wait before peak lunch time before peak dinner  Just keep mind always wait  very popular restaurant  smaller party better but if large group expect wait long time  <EOR> Went Wed night seated 25 min  farmhouse burger onion rings  Both them great! little pricey but your getting amazing burger! <EOR> The food excellent but service very slow  took hour table then another hour burger!!

I decided forest burger classic bacon cheeseburger but tremor cheese forest mushrooms duck bacon !  When came burger looked gorgeous onion rings huuuuge haven't ever seen them size thankfully sharing them!  So burger itself did feel mass produced but best tasting ever eaten onion rings very crispy but more then 3 would probably blow stomach definitely good dish share  I really say lunch perfect experience Vegas!

When hostess Evelyn greets such warm friendly manner sets tone incredible dining experience  IMO Evelyn should put fast track management training  She certainly people skills   And course food dining service always marvelous  <EOR> The fries oreo cookie creme brulee shake came somewhat quickly delicious  burger tasty appetizing but seeing though ordered little 11 just barely served 12 20 even thought told burgers take 20 25 minutess sure worth it   especially when you're really hungry  <EOR> Everything uniquely delicious put together  Lobster shrimp burger spicy margarita  hubby Hog Burger shared Parmesan onion rings which fried perfection  picky shrimp happy lot filling lobster shrimp patty  <EOR> There huge line when came across GRB night Vegas  alone hostess asked if bar seating available  which Kitchen Bar!

We essentially didn't see server rest meal wait quite while check    With everything said still Burger food great well priced plus poor service seemed relatively isolated incident  tables other sections near seemed pretty attentive servers server last visit also extremely friendly attentive  Overall I'd still recommend stopping if you're staying Planet Hollywood just craving burger! <EOR> It seems place always busy  came 8 pm night told would two hour wait  decided come back another night  When arrived came group four 9 pm waited hour half table  time front line super hungry but told party four would take 45 minutes longer ended splitting party into pairs    We ordered Hell's Kitchen Burger Kettle Chip Nachos  burger really good! beef patty tender juicy cooked perfectly  However extremely disappointed nachos chips basically drenched oil  chips soggy all oil dish  relatives felt sick stomach eating dish she sick next few days trip    Overall would line again wait eat those nachos  If come back Vegas heading over Ramsay's Fish Chips instead! <EOR> Meh  Ordered burgers fries shakes  Waited forever  Food fine but nothing special  Even strip seemed incredibly overpriced  long delay two orders wrong even though nobody ordered anything special  time brought re do orders everyone else cold food  re do orders still wrong  All took more two hours nothing above average  Except perhaps shakes  Those tasty  waiter never apologized which seemed tacky just kept saying loud hear anything  <EOR> First burger GREAT!

Alle Burger sind großartig und mit viel Liebe zubereitet  Preis Leistung ist ABSOLUT gerechtfertigt  Ich habe hier den besten Burger meines Lebens gegessen  <EOR> I came across restaurant exploring Planet Hollywood course being big burger snob decided check place out  I found exterior super exciting cool looking  wait max 10 minutes    Once walked seated quite impress fast however when saw big restaurant expectations quality food decreased  Thank goodness ending disappointment   Being huge burger snob course asked extremely kind gentleman assisted recommendations  He gladly recommended seasonal burger off menu  He provided details ingredients convinced ordered forgot name but beef short rib amazing!!!   also ordered fries came along curry chipotle ketchup  being fan curry chipotle nor ketchup thought didn't fancy interest addition already front still ahead requested regular ketchup  ended wanting full experience touch fries ahead tasted both curry chipotle ketchup resulted making taste buds tingle ended being able stop dipping fries curry    wowsers    Let's cut long story conclusion     The burger exceeded expectations   Yes did!! Would try place again   Yes would definitely come again next time Vegas!!  Excellent Service even though warned would wait little while food wait bad thought    From Beer Snobs point view only downfall don't quite large variety Craft Beer don't support any local breweries    boo!!!! But 1 DIPA available tried comfort beer burger snob ways    <EOR> Best burger service had  meat combination perfect burger choices  Really hit spot  <EOR> 40 minutes wait then 2 hours finish eating  Service very slow  Food decent  Overhyped opinion  <EOR> If standard Gordon Ramsey then wouldn't try higher end place  much he talks seasoning certainly wasn't any burgers fries except cumin ketchup which less appealing  just plain Backyard burger hoping good flavor but apparently need slather 3 different cheese sauces bacon taste good   I would skip place straight Shake Shack  <EOR> Great service food fabulous atmosphere British Invasion sound track  Love fired signage  Sat bar where addressed name  All details! <EOR> I extremely impressed Forest burger cooked perfection  exceptionally juicy burger topped tremor cheese arugula grilled mushrooms duck bacon  combination arugula cheese duck bacon flavor explosion  Again duck bacon such unique twist traditional bacon burger  Everything point including service  must go!

Wheatberry Quinoa Salad best salad ever eaten life! Perfect amount dressing  All flavors complimented each other  Tons greens but balanced all other vegetables delicoius grains salad  guess m saying very large salad  good!!! also Hummus Pitas  Yum!   My husband mood salad I  When suggested Gordon Ramsay's Burger restaurant husband salad?! But he humored me    After finished eating he said salad we both same salad superb  He really thought salad restaurant specializes burgers would lacking  But he happliy surprised find salad really good   The only downside restaurant big downside don't take reservations  very early wait fire sign not ideal Vegas heat eat time most people won't lined just wait long takes  line fairly short when arrived 5 30pm Saturday night  But still would taken 35 minutes just seated show catch    I asked if could takeout order instead did  saved us! super delicious I'd eat again sure!   The staff friendly very helpful  Thanks awesome dinner! <EOR> The hype reaaaaal   The burgers aren't bad tasty but definitely worth pricetag  servers super slow  reason always long line outside  plenty tables inside just dont turn them over efficiently  Maybe plan   trying seem more busy is   It such popular place Vegas because its probably only moderately priced Gordon Ramsay restaurant all Vegas  Try once but really nothing special  <EOR> We Mother's Day lunch fantastic! Food service both outstanding  <EOR> It pleasant experience dining here  seated right away Sunday afternoon 4 30pm no line yet   food service little slow side took 15 min bring appetizer another 15 20 min bring burgers but due fact kitchen cooks everything order take time ensure high quality  Plus asked patties cooked well done which did perfectly!  Blue burger 5 stars! Loved complex flavors! Hells Kitchen burger also 5 stars but prefer Blue burger more if choose between two   Chips curry dip 5 stars    super fresh potato wedges big portion delicious yellow curry dipping sauce   Worth hype but probably won't wait line this  Come during downtime! <EOR> This great burger joint but Gordon's name attached expecting something bit more    We able table without reservations moderate wait only 30 minutes  Which expected place popular    The drink menu creative delivered flavors promised  nothing tricky but hindsight should just gone beer    We ordered poutine onion rings things started  onion rings amazing  Usually onion rings limp soggy almost immediately but held up    The poutine however just mess flavor  Poutine simple  Fries brown gravy cheese curds optional meat  needlessly complicated dish tried hard disappointment    The burgers served delicious but entire table ordered them cooked same way medium rare based servers suggestion  When arrived however burgers ranged rare almost blue almost medium  rarer burgers while tasty just became wet mushy mess few bites in    The service great  ambience cool would expect  bit noisy crowded but Vegas all  <EOR> The first time group friends no wait service amazing server above beyond  Literally would recommended place anyone because food just delicious! Second time around today more specific left completely disappointed  disappointed food because just delicious first time  Disappointed because some reason staff kept giving friends unwarranted stares talking group other staff looking right us  Mind friends far being rowdy obnoxious see reason why staff would act way  may dress richest people world but does mean okay assume money  made whole second experience very uncomfortable honestly much love food would really think long hard before stepping foot establishment again  Food deserves 5 stars  <EOR> We took Uber specifically eat because craving good burger  arrived 11 30 close midnight  turned away because the kitchen having issues however people still served food kind issues would be? spoke manager said can't keep business long ticket times close early  kind restaurant name Vegas understaffs cooks closes early? <EOR> The burgers shakes always dope  Hell's Kitchen Burger  meat cooked requested med rare   fries sauces great  Some fries came little soggy but alright since only couple them nothing would cry about  also ordered Brown Butter Caramel Pecan Shake  always order to go sip while wandering Strip since drink pretty chilled weather hot  Every time Vegas always point eat never miss great burger   I am professional food critic chef but enjoy good burgers  always top list #1 burger  highly recommend also reserve table advance since always crowded here  If coming solo lunch time probably find bar spot without reserving around 2pm but afternoon evening night times require reservation quickly  <EOR> Disclaimer happy camper spouse once walked into place looked menu prices  gave look   OK  start off family another family Spring Break trip Vegas don't judge   wife charge most itinerary she chose place knew nothing about  guess she seen TV friends what  Well once walked glanced menu place price friendly kids 3 kids us  Ex  hotdog $17 I think   Anyways just frowned until point food arrival   I ended ordering Cheeseburger known for  Again wasn't happy price but along planned  place very elegant well thought layout  Live fires burning all around  could see kitchen distance food prepared  wait staff exceptionally polite friendly  actually held 2 3 minute conversation pleasant well  ended changing order placing waiter upset all changing also offered if don't something let know she exchange it  impressed feeling little more ease price issue above     The food arrived I left part spouse suggested order 1 french fries entire family 3  Once waiter placed fries table wow  should listened her  Ending result left several fries uneaten hate waste good french fries    Now burger  burger size decent size  meat looked hot juicy  Quality remaining burger looked great  impressed  Once bit into burger all could say Hmmmmm  pretty good  juicy tender looked  Those damn fries sweet potato fire not literally   VERY delicious  wanted sure ate all those before helping regular fries ordered    Hotdog Yes $17 hotdog  thing huge  thinking no way son able eat half it  weenie wrapped bacon  notion really wanted taste it  once did delicious  could ordered myself happy  son able finish half he enjoyed it  all stuffed   I recommend place food mostly amazing ambience offer  cleanliness wait staff   All amazing  <EOR> I thrilled food here!

Hubby wanting check place past year during last trip Vegas over LDW thought heck let's try out   We waited line 20 minutes when hostess asked if wanted sit chefs table  didn't really want stand line anymore since starving took it  admit made sound cooler experience when telling chefs table little disappointed when just bar counter  Fine let pass expectations little high   This where things pretty sour  First took 15 minutes server say anything another 15 minutes drinks 45 minutes food  Considering starving pretty hangry mood  couldn't believe slow place was  give cooks moving pretty fast times but other times just standing around waiting food cook  noticed burgers would all come time 5 then cooks would just standing waiting more food cook  would cook food shifts rather being constant  Why just consistently cooking rather putting everything together then waiting food ready together?   Now food I Tendori Chicken lettuce wrapped  All asked chicken cheese wrapped lettuce  complicated right? Well chicken some kind sauce took away goodness it  But since starving just let ate it  But wasn't fan sauce  When asked server sauce she didn't know ask chef looked liked he didn't know then just settled being marinade   Umm no cooked chicken  tossed top chicken  difference   Hubby Backyard burger no complaints him  He thought ok  High quality ingredients but really worth price tag   We decided share order sweet potato fries which huge btw! both weren't fan powdered sugar added  don't powdered sugar fries  Whats point it?   Overall don't think come back  better burger places around Vegas  least hubby off back trying place out! <EOR> Gordo!!

Burgers simple far having many toppings  husbands bacon floppy  Awesome truffle Parmesan fries! Decent pricing expected  burger wasn't quite well done but  ok! <EOR> It hard walk into restaurant without any expectation when see most famous names restaurant business  Walking into Gordon Ramsay Burger expectations very very high  Once seated greeted table setting reminds British Flag simple menu top very minimalistic fonts name restaurant  physical Menu self even felt lot thought design elements interaction put into compared regular menu majority restaurants  drinks dessert separate tablet menu server brings seems bit place don't see use but feel its because limited space actual menu     food  Anniversary Burger which also seems F Word burger wasn't menu  patty blend 27 day dry aged New York strip Bone ribeye barbecue short rib  topped frisee pickled shallots lemon vinaigrette  seems design isn't very sophisticated simple yet flavorful is  People might ask whats point all best meat patty won't taste it   but truth made whole lot difference  actually taste dry aged quality meat each bite  Parmesan Truffle fries cooked perfection subtle yet enough seasoning flavor both Truffle Parmesan every bite Fries  hands down best gourmet burgers had     Service bit slow due place being damn busy but understandable since place jam packed  only gripe place waiting system  5 people party kind enough take down number text when table ready but party 2 less said physically wait line  Though didn't wait line just didn't any sense me  If already system where take peoples name phone number down why can't everyone enjoy little bit Vegas instead waiting line next window full flames?
