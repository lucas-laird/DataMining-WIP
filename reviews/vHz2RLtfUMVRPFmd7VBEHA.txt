Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen just good really great restaurant!  really wanted them screw something just could call bland send back!  But couldn't all great!  doesn't mean perfect could see some people may feel let down because still lot hype surrounding opening Hell's Kitchen Las Vegas   But if look meant does great job!  personally think Gordon Ramsay Steak Paris nicer better restaurant   But need explain why   Gordon Ramsay Steak fine dining restaurant dinner moves very slow pace many more options pick Gordon Ramsay Steak!  Hell's Kitchen designed very high volume restaurant   designed give Fanny Packers Tourists all over country all over world myself included opportunity try some Gordon's dishes experience restaurants   menu very limited just TV show   But each dish executed perfectly everything tasted amazing!  Lobster Risotto best ever had!!!  loved Scallops well cooked perfectly pretty straightforward   Beef Wellington perfect totally lived reputation!  tried Sticky Toffee Pudding which before always good!  also tried Pineapple Carpaccio   really fun dessert served liquid Nitrogen   But Pineapple under ripe super tart bit let down   wouldn't order again   server also great somewhat ignored most time he even screwed bill   didn't bother correct because he busy   couple little missteps really crowded busy restaurant bad experience bad restaurant?  all!  Overall great experience!  fun meet Michelle moment last season Hell's Kitchen   food great am sure back again soon   But if want much slower paced fine dining experience try Gordon Ramsay Steak instead!  Hell's Kitchen much more fun fast paced needs crowds standing front!  hope your chance try Lobster Risotto Scallops Beef Wellington some Sticky Toffee Pudding soon!!! <EOR> Overall good experience  Made reservations few months ago 30th birthday  host very accommodating when there  15min early seated almost right away  restaurant full  If watched show did then you'd appreciate environment pretty spot on  kitchen line chefs red chefs blue sous chefs all! ordered salmon potato scallops  Very flavorful! husband ordered beef Wellington mac cheese OMG! tasted absolutely amazing! also shocked affordable bill Gordon Ramsey's BLT inside Bally's during last visit amazing way Hell's Kitchen half cost! absolutely recommend Hells Kitchen Vegas! <EOR> We came back second time trip again flawless wagyu meatballs starter  decided Hell's Kitchen Burger which Fresno chili jam ghost pepper jack cheese  serve breakfast all day asked if could add fried egg burger  told couldn't     We also couldn't lawash bread offer dinner  Apparently no customization allowed though removing things tomato sandwich okay   Disappointing   This time service wasn't crisp  water guy ended doing most work refills catching waiter clarifications meal  He did stellar job but waiter shouldn't just take order give bill other people delivered food   often water guy find waiter   The burger tasty just spicy enough without being overpowering but also ice cold time it  waiter quickly took back remade  took 5 minutes flawless  guacamole fresh tomato balanced spicy elements could still taste beef perfectly seasoned chuck   The chicken Caesar salad grilled chicken sandwich New York strip rest table ordered prepared properly without issue  But  because being made while burger sitting getting cold   Still worth return trip but little disappointed issues $182 bill and no offer comp otherwise mistake burger   <EOR> Really enjoyed checking new Hell's Kitchen Caesar's  replaces old Serendipity spot front Caesar's  Ambience cool lot pitchforks decor  Ended sitting high top bar would much rather sitting table middle facing kitchen  3 4 ended getting prixe fix deal  thought great deal considering included famous beef Wellington toffee pudding  Specialty cocktails great server ox great energy vibe elevated experience  would again but hope more options main dish since tried beef Wellington previously restaurant Paris  <EOR> We Tues night 6 celebrate anniversary mostly excellent   Britney server outstanding   She prompt personable professional   scallops lobster risotto waygu meatball apps great   Caesar salad bit much lemon juice but bad   NY strip Caesar salad shrimp rack lamb filet entrees all excellent well   beef wellington bit bland   problem red quinoa salad which believe may bad wife sick all night she alone ate item  Bring your wallet just bit pricey   Overall nice place don't quinoa  <EOR> Fan eponymous show love your dining experience  almost dinner theater massive dining room wide open kitchen including chefs dressed red team blue team  great job bringing fire theme smoked cocktail shrimp flambé dessert served dry ice  say food isn't star show  foie gras dish many levels lamb cooked perfection  Ask sit Charles' section  He's incredible waiter very attentive complete pro   Could done without blank expression Palmer girl 'hostesses' red dresses barely covered 'assets'  Vegas but IMHO just doesn't fit theme  <EOR> I amazing experience Hell's Kitchen  someone both fan show skeptical restaurant would live hype pleasantly surprised treated both fantastic service food  If sure ask John F Gil  team servers gave some best service ever experienced  Thanks both those guys    Drinks table ordered ice teas which come liquid sugar delicious  refill every chance waiter assistant waiter refill  never empty drink   Food we quite bit food  break down below   Lobster Risotto start thought weakest dish  tasted ok but watching Hell's Kitchen many times feel just didn't live hype  tasted bland never before lobster tasted undercooked  wasn't hot but more warm cold side  told server he took care it   Cauliflower Side absolute surprise us  FANTASTIC! seasoning cheese delicious  Piping hot  loved much ordered second side   Mac Cheese Side pretty good!

Upon entrees arriving beef wellington wasn't very warm server taken away knife replaced search knife which frustrating  water glass remained empty quite while all drinking eventually asked server if could more water she never bothered fill glass remainder time even asking  issues which should resolved during soft opening phase most basic server responsibilities! am such huge fan hells kitchen local very excited restaurant but came away very disappointed many ways  <EOR> What say high expectations met all way around  Service perfection  food delicious loved all five group  reservations weeks months advance  Many people eating 3 five hours because didn't reservations  walked immediately sat  atmosphere great  Beef Wellington $49 but worth is  Mac n cheese better anything ever had  <EOR> Having grown watching Hell's Kitchen when heard opening knew go!
