Also if check free side  Garlic feta fries seriously amazing! <EOR> We ordered gyro pita Greek salad side Garlic Feta fries all yummy!! definitely come back! <EOR> The food good prices reasonable conveniently located  only reason give 5 stars because unless owner quality food down  Also size drink cups laughable give customers bigger cups  <EOR> This place always favorite mine   All need know Gyros best ever had   lamb meat tender z sauce perfect   $8 but big tasty   You also nice combo fries drink just $2 more   Give place shot   feels small ma pop shop but don't know if corporate not   <EOR> The chicken shawarma amazing!! Hummus little runny but everything else great! <EOR> I absolutely LOVE place! number saved phone order pickup almost once week    The lamb gyro spicy garlic fries yummy!  Staff nice food always delicious <EOR> My wife several great Greek lunches little shop    The food very fresh  enjoyed both hummus baba ganoush  pita bread really good cook perfectly   We gyros Greek Salads  Both great  gyro meat really good fries very tasty  <EOR> I haven't awhile finally ordered take order coworkers I  place used good sure happened! veggie plate some gyros  gyros ok but price  portion size veggie plate small kids meal lol worth $10  place definitely pricey worth  sure if coming back anytime soon  <EOR> I feel place really great atmosphere small but crowded   some reason sitting waiting scene head played out   felt if being drawn into reality where people seemed family oriented serving gyro's right near beach   All right back reality     The guy took order seemed lovable    he more happy take order     I ordered Combo $10 95 little pricey lunch but gave try   came gyro choice lamb chicken falafel I chose chicken regular fries greek fries being took greek fries soda     The gyro very bomblicious could without onions maybe take sour cream down notch    but other amazing   never tasted gyro's before nothing compare too   greek fries interesting little spices did give kick but nothing brag about     This place indeed another return   hope order something different but gyros = DELICIOUS! <EOR> EXCELLENT!!!!!  grew kind food good gets   Falafel pita perfect   Just right amount Tahini sauce Falafel greasy Pita very good   service people nice could want    Can't wait back try something new <EOR> I used think place best gyros super packed fillings flavor layered such way every bite even perfect distrabution everything    However last time meat dry wasn't much garlicky sauce used really present taziki sauce barely just dry flavorless   top kinda dropping ball service competency   just getting gyro pick charging two combos   When boyfriend told them right then gave price combo he correct them again point price ala carte item finally charged properly   Maybe new owners sure haven't while   used awesome house fries loaded spicy sauce feta garlic but knows if same anymore   really am bummed  <EOR> I think may just start making all Greek food home    The hummus lacking flavor pita came stale    The tzatziki watery no where near enough gyro  gyro also disappointing because meat just salty  common problem  Chefs often confuse salty being properly seasoned  Spice racks more spot reason    The baklava inedible  dry stale but pool ooze bottom    Yanni's food terrible music produced man bearing same name  assault your pallet  <EOR> Ordered shawarma pita baklava go! Probably biggest pita ever life don't skimp shawarma  flavorful authentic tasting Greek spices such nutmeg  baklava delicious well  Cant wait try other traditional Greek items  Staff very friendly order ready fast  <EOR> I'm Chicago eat real gyro meat off stick place Frozen strips cook  good very disappointed <EOR> Yum yum yum    need say more?   Expected fast somewhat mediocre greek food    got most delicious lunch!   sure grilled chicken salad! <EOR> I exhausted starving being car all day  snacking fast food during mini road trip vegas going family party night    I huge dilemma wait party food keep getting hungrier and crankier something really quick close family's house! boyfriend drive around nearest plaza decided eating Yanni's  BEST DECISION EVER   I ordered chicken gyro basically devoured all during 4 minute drive home cousin's house down street  boyfriend also couple big bites  first he said didn't want any but when he saw gyro he basically ate half because smelled looked delicious   Such great greek food establishment! Chicken tender juicy flavorful! Pita toasted just right! tzatziki sauce point! huge fills leaving very content! Im disappointed didn't try more menu   but next time back vegas know where go! <EOR> Overall Yanni's Gyro ok  good atmosphere casual dinning takeout   Food surprised wasn't meat spit gyro all meat magically uniformly sliced  we suspect ingredients pre purchased product I also find strange buffalo sauce garlic Greek fries since never knew buffalo sauce part Greek cuisine   Pricing spending $22 00 combo meal salad   Portion sizes Filling 2   Although food good aware Americanized Greek food   If you're yearning traditional Greek food may scratch your itch  <EOR> Been several times during last few months yet disappointed  gyros best ever had   lamb well seasoned sliced thin  tzatziki sauce creamy garlicky just enough dill  hummus good but great   babaganoush however stars menu  being familiar particular dish expecting something entirely different pleasantly surprised good was  soup lemon chicken very refreshing  perfect compliment rest menu  When first saw prices little sticker shock but once food served quantity given feel price justified good value money  <EOR> This place fantastic  shawarma gyro delicious buffalo feta fries stupid good! <EOR> Their hummus basically everything menu point !!!

On whole tasty but unfulfilling sandwich made high quality ingredients  Overpriced but super friendly staff  said mixed bag  <EOR> A microwave? Really? uses styrofoam anymore? NO comparison Greek Bistro Henderson  meat precooked dry owner weird  <EOR> Food very flavorful  Temperature nice hot  love fact remembered eating utensils  price decent  felt above mentioned attributes excellent  Especially considering fact food delivery gym no less felt awesome  demeanor delivery man bright enthusiastic  only criticism guess could delivery fee 5 99  But over all no big deal  just feel amount delivery fee could hinderance some  But loved fact healthy food delivered  would definitely order Yanni's again when visit Las Vegas Henderson Nevada  California can't think anything delivery Greek beats Yanni's  Highly recommend restaurant others  <EOR> I've Greek Mediterranean food awhile   craving gyro baba ghanoush   ordered combo platter each item   disappointed see use frozen thin pre sliced strips packaged gyro meat   menu said meat lamb   When say thing shouldn't contain blend   gyro meat certainly blended product   Typically bad      While sat looked gyro best it   pita fresh warm   Other gyro meat rest internal garnish product fresh crisp tzatziki sauce refreshing   The baba ghanoush ok   lacked color texture   would hope fresh made product crossing fingers one would bit more robust chunky   could accomplished fire roasting eggplant  tried best dress dish nice floral arrangement sliced  cucumber   sadly add touch hot sauce give little flavor      For around $12 gyro side drink   bad   would nice see them utilize better gyro meat product     I'll try again     I stay away gyro meat try other dishes <EOR> My hubby love place!! very fresh cooked order  may wait little longer other spots but totally worth it  made order just sitting around  especially chicken kabob combo Greek fries  also deliver now open Sundays!
