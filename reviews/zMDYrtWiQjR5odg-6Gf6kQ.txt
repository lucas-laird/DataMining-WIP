Good coffee friendly workers   Much much better then previous owners brew  <EOR> Their coffee quality significantly gone down over past year now sometimes don't even finish drink even though usually only grande  even sure if serve illy coffee anymore since just use regular cups now   they probably don't which why no good anymore  still find myself coming because work next door convenient just come versus driving Starbucks  pretty decent breakfast sandwiches bagels but  all really can't comment any other pastries  lady nice if know otherwise probably wouldn't agree  also validate your parking if buy something <EOR> So update! staff really nice coffee good  Service sped hence bump stars! also tried chicken caesar salad lunch good well  lunch special price really good! Overall happy place  Hope stay around while! <EOR>
