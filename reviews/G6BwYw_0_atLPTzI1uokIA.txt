Truth told visited Nacho Daddy off basis Groupon   Without teetering fence visiting here   Mainly because even though love some nachos usually no problem making home and pretty mean one    But end saw some flavors Nacho Daddy menu intriguing   hard happy when comes nachos mean even ones local 7 11!    The fam weekend lunch bit surprised place fairly empty   football TV!  Nachos!  Beer!  Women tight tops!  Would thought Nacho Daddy would more filled sports day   only 6 8 tables taken when fairly empty bar area   We seated promptly nice corner table near windows   server very personable fairly quick   Looking menu all decided two nacho entrees share salad along it   decided on *Nacho Average Burger Nachos $10 95 seasoned ground beef applewood smoked bacon yellow queso sauce red onions tomatoes shredded lettuce over house made corn chips  *Florentine Nachos $11 95 grilled chicken breast sun dried tomatoes bacon spinach topped Asiago Romano Parmesan cheese sauce all over spinach corn chips  *Kale Salad $6 95 Nacho Daddy favorite kale cucumber corn grape tomatoes mushrooms red onions avocado agave citrus vinaigrette  You might think advert house made chips Nacho Daddy would complimentary bowl them along some house salsa each table   Isn't chip supposed your strong point?  Why sample?  But case here   If want Bottomless Chips Salsa offered $2 95 every 4 guests   big deal but did kinda bother bit   Oh well price doing business suppose   Didn't take long orders come maybe around 20 minutes   All looked pretty fresh!    Nacho Average Burger Nachos good   Basically cheeseburger nacho!  While delicious didn't think really something couldn't attempt home   Chips crunchy fair amount toppings top   But could done more cheese them maybe healthy layer shredded cheese middle chip stack BEFORE adding queso sauce toppings?  few spots where chip didn't any cheese them   The Florentine Nachos pretty look all Italian colors red white green   Thankfully tasty well   Grilled chicken wasn't dry sun dried tomatoes bacon added some good contrasting texture   white cheese sauce yummy but again wasn't quite enough around!  Some spinach chips ended being bare spots!    Surprisingly best thing table Kale Salad!  would back Nacho Daddy just this!  Possibly meal next time addition grilled chicken breast top!  salad downright great even though rest fam didn't red onion it   think vinaigrette made kale salad really good   sweet sour tangy good mix hearty kale meaty avocado   just wish sucker bigger!    The manager Nacho Daddy came table towards end meal asked doing if food liking   politely made small comment cheese placement he told would definitely look into making change that   He also suggested next visit try Thai Chicken Nachos current favorite   Pleasant guy thanked coming in   Overall Nacho Daddy going good direction niche theme restaurant   nachos tasty but needs some work getting more cheese those nooks crannies   Also maybe serving tad?  When think nachos think big pile chips smothered goodies   Adding another little layer chips would wow factor guys add value pricing   wish salad bit larger well but enough three share smaller servings   I'd come back again Nacho Daddy if another Groupon handy   sure if I'd back right away without though there's just many other places dine if you're spending kind money   However nacho combinations hard beat   Nacho ordinary joint! <EOR> I ordered pickup location am very very disappointed  excited try vegan chicken nachos but when home saw no chick'n!! ate them anyways because vegan cheese pretty tasty but halfway through found very long dark hair presumably host gave food  Thumbs all way down! <EOR> Large portions great service but music loud awful killed experience  Foo fighters every other song losing mind couldn't wait leave! never coming back  food good but great  Enchilada nachos green sauce incredibly bland might well it  Huge selection very interesting beer unbelievable selection margaritas  Prolly best drinks during happy hour cares food kinda thing  But face it    Vegas very long list much better food environment here  <EOR> Great time golden knights watch party  Great staff amazing food  Knights Go! <EOR> Love place  Happy hour awesome great food  Large vegetarian vegan selection tequila Tuesday buy one   always sit bar can't talk dining room but Zack Jasmine fun friendly always good recommendations food drink  <EOR> I excited try place   1  Because love nachos Mexican food   2  Because vegan options!

Thank toy Zach! <EOR> I find Mexican Food Vegas lacking overall none places Tex Mex which preference  family 3 adults 1 child over $100 which think totally outrageous  cheese enchilada plate $15 00! didn't even order drinks feel violated    The food better average Vegas but amount money portions small chips salsa free    Service excellent however willing give another try  Perhaps lunch more affordable  If spending over $100 then headed strip gourmet vittles  <EOR> Came last night late night snack night cap  Sat bar bartender attentive made great margaritas encouraged food choices    Two stand moments take friends when visit 1 bar plays call Pandora music videos  Such great variety   2 kitchen staff finished sitting bar  He befriended regular I think bought shrimp taco try since gentleman never one   type cool friendly vibe think runs throughout location    I can't wait back full meal  Also wide variety tequila THANK GOODNESS no slot machines bar  <EOR> Very disappointing almost nothing visit lunch yesterday right   check in margarita very good then all downhill   $10 Daddy Margarita glass which 1 thick packed ice   literally 4 sips liquid total $2 50 sip   place filled ate lunch way understaffed   food delayed long time once brought could tell nachos under heat lamp while   did bring guac smothered burrito ask did bring chips salsa which included well ask twice   No salsa fajitas ask 3 times box near end meal  am almost positive dirty dishes still table ignored until standing leave   Also shrimp nachos pretty skimpy bland   Overall nice experience return  <EOR> Food surprisingly good its great location Village Square which lots great restaurants shops!!!  Sunday brunch chorizo nachos Mexican pancakes breakfast sausage slider   Everything great!  back same items try other stuff since large menu  <EOR> Went Sahara location yesterday family town  Uncle Jersey heavy accent server condescending kept mocking accent  sure if she thought cute not  Then father proceeds order Beer Battered Lobster tacos server argued down guys don't those menu  legitimately point before she believed us  add insult injury she then non attentive ask another staff member refills  Extremely poor experience especially since brought family town show them favorite spots kinda embarrassing  food stellar always but service specifically server ruined experience  <EOR> I hoping service better location but non existent  very few restaurant waited seated  table dirty  server took long table  He also bartender but still no excuse  food took ridiculously long come when did order wrong all things requested it   sent back upon return same plate all remnants didn't want  didn't even re plate it! onions all mixed plate asked side onions  all food amazing including dessert! ask check charged onions   There appeared manager sitting corner laptop whole time  highly suggest he pay attention manage place because service sucks  <EOR> We came Sunday afternoon family  4 tables occupied took forever food   My husband both ordered Patron skinny margarita  HORRIBLE! thought maybe if added some orange slices would help but nope  both few sips couldn't tolerate sour gave up  drink them other places never bad  worse part waitress never noticed being consumed inquired were   The food ok  husband both chicken fajita salad  large serving  seemed lacking flavor but wasn't horriable   One child Pull finger aka chicken strips another tacos 3rd tamales  all enjoyed food said spicy all  <EOR> Great filet mignon nachos waitress Sarah very helpful knowledgeable  IPAs limited beers par  However Sara doll very nice  <EOR> Fiesta Nachos scorpion shot  dare you! Great happy hour  Best nachos you'll ever no dry chips!   Friendly staff! <EOR> We came quiz night few weeks ago first time Nacho Daddy  called ahead time check quiz starting time  told 7 30  arrived 7 15 quiz already started but over played catchup before reading menu   When waiter came over gave drink order said needed more time consider menu  he brought drinks then ignored us  told host wanted order still took waiter another ten minutes before he came back without even much apology   He said he thought didn't want anything which made no sense because all ordered water     We shared plate shrimp nachos  totally gross crazy expensive  $15 pile soggy green tortilla chips I just find using festively colored chips really odd covered thick salty cream all things  few diced tomatoes jalapeños sprinkled top course some shrimp there  tasted pile wet chemicals  pretty sure nothing constituted fresh foodstuffs    The waiter came back ask desert  friend asked coffee  waiter said Well cappuccino machine broken  coffee maker  require REALLY hot water coffee  see need really HOT  really bizarre  course no apology again just another disappearing waiter  Eventually he brought check taking shot table near us   put down card again waited waited until finally gave threw down exact change cash took off    A seriously horrible experience  Quiz host cool but no multi media type rounds venue even without rude service yuck food isn't really suitable quiz  <EOR> Total bar food  Food tasted microwaved  Henderson good such disappointment  Fries cold fish chips bland  Tyson way better frozen wings  <EOR> I'm back logged reviews but put front line because say major disappointment experiencing place   usually wait till try place few times before going star crazy but stated things need say   reason two stars instead zero escalation   when called ask wait times when seated both female answered gentleman seated both sadly didn't names friendly informed    Food  quality booze good even if experience    let's yelp rage review another those hangry yelpers shall we?    So driving down Sahara way Indian Friday night drove past nacho daddy recalled tried them originally yelp event fell hard Mexican corn offthe cob course decided before movie date Saturday time margaritas some Mexican nachos    Fast fwd evening nacho daddy experience      Shawn waiter set tone Saturday night meal where place going tabled quite sometime before try Them again   which lame cause totally planned bring someone isn't square bear my bf doesn't drink much drink  shoot Scorpion shots when photo ready cause admittedly cozy clothes prep three hours movies fancy cute tourist selfie scorpion shots       My biggest pet peeve when dining being left thirsty    need soda usually diet water refills often lol server failed jump that   asked some questions premium margaritas    He didn't really say much but jalapeño spicy  cucumber chili he recommended which wasn't menu but he told guy raspberry both which tasty imo 11 12$ price tag but service all bad when Shawn left those without asking if need water but also having prompted some    Worst thing he only brought margaritas before water requested but ask water again continually saw walking around talking other co workers    Being friendly   I'm sorry he love co workers but service should prevail especially when need water     He didn't recommend stuff digging just responded don't anymore old really fast    Now when date night occurs typically app two entrees dessert plus booze     situation already  gone downhill fast     gous entree maybe Shawn thought due attire wasn't interested spending money thing usually still eat food spend money but escalate issue    However being date having guy prefer scene another route which order stuff lower tab which helps feel less horrible tipping well but leaves where hangry upset     If check  yelp you'll free house margarita   delicious  may back bar sometime but     Be advised only free margarita sure he knew checked but also cause thought maybe manager supervisor would authorize come cause don't usually top shelf if give thumbs up So  fair say good bartender   Filet nachos won entree choice due recommendation dude seated nice    18 something huge shared those fine but lack meat way many beans but taste good     Those beans where Shawn point no return cause going try another premium margarita let guy dessert but   My  meal ended boyfriend waiting long Shawn check back excessive beans nachos no meat spread dish Shawn comes says done playing your beans? Which   A  guess if aligned related would cute but didn't  B  see eaten don't ask happened everything was  C  enough time watch lurk but check in    My boyfriend really wanted try churro banana split  but he due Ben Jerrys redrock   Why? Cause couldn't handle Shawn sight beans any longer  it also delayed finding good movie seats thanks Shawn win!! But seriously   Overall just good experience but quality food bad meh    <EOR> Mom driving home Connecticut mine LA landed en route last overnight  Nacho Daddy 30 second walk hotel  Checked menu online see if anything vegetarian mother eat  vegan menu actually tasty sounding items?
