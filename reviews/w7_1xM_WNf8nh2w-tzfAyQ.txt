Larry G  <EOR> Been passing Volcano Grille lot days Husband finally decided check them out  Didn't hurt gift certificate restaurant com either  definitely surprised got   First off Volcano Grill fast food Japanese restaurant   Walking there's counter register right front you   put your order pay first then grab your condiments take seat   food brought containers despite fact 'dining in'  The Plate options include your choice protein filet mignon shrimp wild alaskan salmon shredded crab chicken breast vegetarian choice white rice brown rice fried rice lo mein choice cucumber salad ginger dressing salad choice grilled vegetables 3 chicken gyozas   Your price determined protein choice   For two choice three plate options   * Filet Mignon Plate Brown Rice Grilled Vegetables Ginger Dressing Salad $9 85 beef tasty grilled veggies mostly consisted napa cabbage     * Shrimp Plate Brown Rice Gyozas Cucumber Salad $9 85 Generous shrimp tasty too!  gyozas enjoyable well   cucumber salad pickled salad   * Wild Alaskan Salmon Brown Rice Gyozas Cucumber Salad $9 85 Although wasn't bad salmon least favorite   They did orders mixed bit wrong side wrong salad protein choice but did everything wanted  Not big deal since sharing more concern if you're picking bunch different people  Although price says $9 85 think he may rang higher price   double check   I also ordered two regular soft drinks $1 49 but he rang two large ones $1 79    Which wasn't big deal since dining cool iced tea machine soda fountain help yourself to     In condiments section bunch different 'special' sauce help yourself to   Ultimately don't need them but nice have  Hot Lava Yum Yum Ginger Teriyaki Spicy Teriyaki Hot Magma Sweet Garlic Sweet Onion Chili Japanese Salsa Spicy Miso They pride themselves menu nothing over ten dollars which true   also offer cheaper The Bowl option which comes white rice grilled vegetables    Overall food good   more lunch option some place you'd dinner though   long know expect won't disappointed   far teppanyaki experience though!   3 5 stars <EOR> I lunch break day try bento boxes   ordered brown rice garlic noodles diced salmon diced filet mignon   tell pictures posted Volcano Grille tries bring menu filled healthful options salad choice carbs protein   While may case flavor should compromised  actually bit disappointed because food packed flavor   understand bunch different sauces pick take but least flavors actual food stand themselves   no seasoning garlic noodles rub fish did really help     Besides food being level two above borderline bland staff really helpful   noise level bit average loud all   dining area very clean appreciate that     I would say if really want impressed looking just ok food just smother bunch sauces sriracha consider going here  <EOR> Brand spanking new place right neighborhood! located corner strip mall most part vacant see why first review it    It's teppanyaki type restaurant but without all fancy tables onion volcanos  think actually good idea since teppanyaki but sometimes don't need whole show weird people sitting table annoying birthday songs  took them 5 minutes to go order considering just opened seemed fine me   I ordered Ckicken Teppanyaki plate Bok Choy Fried Rice  all cooked right front all ingredients looked tasted fresh   not shabby seems lot healthier Panda Express   The price little over $7 without drink guess seems fair  decor simple modern dark brown reds  kind cracked Teppanyaki chef guy still add little flair even though don't think neccesary guess old habits die hard   Overall back very new place hopefully it'll well  <EOR> thank ye internet gods yelp otherwise never would've discovered gem located just stone's throw new apartment  volcano grille shut DOWN today Bento w steak chicken noodles gyoza threw  79 side salad bomb ginger dressing good measure  delicious tender juicy meat amazing house made dipping sauces very sweet and cute! boys workin' counter  literally best meal eaten weeks all piddly $11  used seeing unshowered mug boys cuz definitely returning frequently   kinda sucks place located totally dead ghost town shopping plaza they're getting traffic rightly deserve  yourself favor pop meal week won't regret it  <EOR> Great lunch quick dinner great different food joint area filled fast food options  favorite lunch spot when tired usual lunchtime food   Located currently barren strip mall tucked behind Brentwood Tavern Volcano Grill literally middle nowhere!  What really Volcano Grille hearty meal  fresh healthy pretty decent price  All food cooked order  bento box 2 proteins way last time  Steak shrimp choices next time am just going ask double steak     shrimp wasn't bad just steak good! think marinade sauce just perfect  Mix your rice savor every drop!!  While dining feel little awkward I prefer takeout still places sit eat  Although when April ate air conditioner wasn't working very well pretty hot very fast   They've changed menu couple times over past few years but food still same great stuff   It definitely worth looking trying! <EOR> Volcano Grille tucked away little shopping center bar  friend told two years stunned  does business does much traffic stay afloat long?   The reason most likely solid food  better healthier fast food  prices little steep serving size but healthy portion  bento boxes good amount adult but big other restaurants    Each order starts protein choice  friend shredded imitation crab meat 6 95 filet mignon 9 95   Next choice starch  options being white brown fried chow mein  both brown rice no extra charge  +1 charging brown fried rice  Then comes veggies gyoza  order each  prefer veggies  steaming hot retained crunch without being hard  All boxes come salad well    While waiting order looked around sauce bar  such large selection hard pick one  Luckily bar open many samples want  sweet garlic spicy teriyaki hot magma sauce probably favorites  also yum yum hot mustard sriracha ponzu lava regular teriyaki unlabeled sauce onion bits it  cool see Asian restaurant salsa bar style amenity guest   We also order shu mai because wanted dim sum but missed time window  good  Next time pass those  <EOR> Food presentation 2 5 taste 3 5 price 2 5     we ordered 2 steak bento 1 chicken bowl   Chicken bowl joke    80% rice    15% veggies 5% chicken   Serving size just joke   Rice Trax    we coming back YOU!!!  place needs also clean sauce bar   sticky everywhere mess   service   lackluster  Bleh won't back! <EOR> This nothing Benihana style teppanyaki place big fan uber teppan chain  teriyaki chicken bowl fast food place  Walked didn't smell look appetizing left  FYI Fellow Yelpers teppanyaki place typically cooks flat grill front seated customers look up  <EOR> Come expectation fine dining traditional Japanese establishment more fast food take joint   very limited menu items   tried filet mignon garlic noodle gyoza bento combo filet cooked perfect tenderness flavorful! gyoza standard fare   definitely home made   only gripe really garlic noodles really lacked any kind flavor    but perhaps why unique sauce bar concept    10 dipping sauces available ranging spicy teriyaki teriyaki fuji yum hot magma japanese salsa ponzu etc  sauce stood fuji yum   I felt dipping all food including filet =    noodles ended pouring spicy teriyaki over spice bit  really would give place 3 5 star rating perhaps didn't understand pick own flavor noodles sauce bar    but generally prefer food pre flavored rather having myself   Overall would probably back if needed order quick lunch   Food comes fast but may due fact busy   really no service rate since pay front grab seat kind establishment  <EOR> Never bad meal   Once some long wait food  But boxes sauces any waiting do    We usually bento box chicken steak fried rice pot stickers   Can't wrong    Small place early best seating  moving soon sure visit new location  <EOR> abolutely love place  owners guys serving know your going something great  only complaint shumai isnt really traditional more frozen box type  way highly reputable  small place mddle nowhere kinda easy miss if dony know where look  some outdoor seating should added possibly but other very nice place food fantastic <EOR> Excellent experience!  enjoyed visiting place recently surprised well guys quick delicious Japanese cuisine     I ordered bento box filet mignon fried rice veggies   price great quality dish served me!  love sauce bar especially Japanese salsa   Overall service attentive personal   visit place again says lot since live across town  <EOR> Thought already reviewed place but turns just left tip  love love love place  Food reasonably priced realtively healthy if opt brown rice  Steak tender tasty! Hoping more people figure them they're 95% empty strip mall always pretty empty when stop dinner afraid they'll business  eaten regularly since discovering like once week never bad meal  <EOR> Overrated  fish off definitely worth price  sauces ok wouldn't come again  <EOR> Thanks all fellow yelpers great reviews   I area craving rice  sick all week looking comfort food   Went open mind  I ordered steak shrimp brown rice veggies side salad  pretty much ate everything but walked disappointed still hungry    This location really random hidden    no dining employees looked bored   For price point friendly customer service menu options    okay  If live work area decent lunch spot   Would back? Probably not  Not keen serve yourself sauce bar    where everyone touches sauces   Lunch 2 set back around $20  <EOR> I also puzzled someone could review restaurant without eating there      The Volcano Grille superb food  owner chef incredibly skilled Japanese cuisine shows everything ever eaten there  food seasoned perfection cooked beautifully sauce bar perfect compliment spectacular meal    Don't judge book cover  no franchise chain fast food    fresh delicious Japanese cuisine    best all very inexpensive prepared order!
