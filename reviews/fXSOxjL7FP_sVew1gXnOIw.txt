UNACCEPTABLE   annoyed point took back asked them as nicely could muster put back oven   Several minutes waiting I'm sensing pattern ha ha finally dug into pie   flavor okay but still  undercooked   WTF!  Service Sirrico's beyond horrendous   only ones put through ordeal   least 2 other groups waiting pies everyone seriously pissed off!  can't believe place still business   Stay away all costs!  if absolutely must pizza 3am while you're already NY NY casino only order slice!!! <EOR> I'm actually bit surprised all negative reviews place but agree long lines inconsistent quality main culprits  However whenever Vegas anywhere near NY NY hotel try Sirrico's  But don't necessarily come away buying slice pizza  Let explain    If absolutely craving any type pizza see long line then all means wait out  But if there's no line counter check pizza display  Does crust look pale lifeless? Does pizza look fresh? does look sitting couple hours looking cold limp? don't know but if forking over $4 5 slice waiting line it'd better worth it  pizza New York east coast know want    The key slice piping hot straight oven  Look crust slightly charred should look crispy  Sometimes you'll ask sausage mushroom dude give wannabe New York attitude say don't any  Just brush off  doesn't matter small sacrifice just take whatever type pizza just came oven  Wait if to  Usually pepperoni  almost always pepperoni  <EOR> Every time Las Vegas sure stop Sirrico's two slices pizza beer  place centrally located smack down middle NYNY  pizza fantastic reasonably priced Vegas  slices huge juicy quite flavorful  pick slice anytime day  Afternoon sweating your buns off walking strip dawn seeing neens peens bounce around watching Zummanity three morning being denied booty tranny midget      only thing sucks staff  tell hate job  feeling tough old Italian woman back giant belt beats them regularly  <EOR> A slice pizza approximately 5 95 which includes tax  two slices pizza throughout day pepperoni jalapeno pepperoni mushroom  Well pepperoni jalapeno okay  trick ask them reheat slices probably sitting while public display  would imagine slice pizza would better warmer  later long night partying decided grab another slice soak alcohol  time remembered heat tasted fantastic  quite accommodating putting slice box even though ran smaller boxes  <EOR> Their pizza VERY good! Love Sicilian style pizza  haven't tried any other menu offerings but next time there   I bent rules bit  When leave pizza shop turn left sit little cafe` table around corner front Gallagher's restaurant  offer full bar wider selection beer  cafe` tables great place people watch too  <EOR> Overall sure what's others but hands down best pizza  eatin Vegas under stipulation only if fresh oven! love pizza beats many local favorites bay area    Plate dream soft doughy crust smoking hot melted cheese slightly crisp pepperonis   Really really good late night party food    Recommend 5 STAR if freshly cooked  sure lots people front if slice just came out!
