The verdict?  aiite      Earlier day new buddy Mike H  whom met Vegas Yelp event warned extremely high expectations tapas   still full lunch wasn't overly ready dive into tapas bar but restrictions ended being placed did help counter any potential bingefest    guess   Here's works 1  Once seated large group server instructed only person would able order    fellow yelper Kathleen W  designated conch shell  2  Only two plates tapas would allowed per individual any given round ordering   Since ten meant only 20 orders time   Sounds lot huh? 3  Drinks included   Our server dead set only responding designated driver well which both good bad   relay all orders case but admit gave better control foods actually order   Overall food good but all impressive compared other well known tapas bars   The Hits Smalls Balls    tasty full flavor even small bites  Tuscan flatbread    mozzarella cheese tomatoes?  hell yes! Poona Tuna    seared ahi fantastic dressing   ordered over six plates! Tuna Sashimi    can't wrong raw fish ponzu sauce   The Meh Grilled PB J    sounds more awesome nostalgic actually tasted  Mac Cheese Daddy    way heavy filled fast Asada Tacos    enough meat lacked lot spice  Given your options people try much can!

The Bad * Chicken Waffles Disappointing  chicken tasty all  didn't breading once again overcooked  waffle fries pretty good though  * Octapussy don't tapioca batter use  Skip   The Ugly * Tater Tots might truffle oil but smelled tasted gasoline  nauseous   You view entire tapas menu web site http bit ly jsmalls  I'm going rounded down A OK Johnny Smalls  I'd return if someone suggested it  decor trendy definitely some tasty items here  $20 good price  <EOR> How place many 4 star reviews? would rather McDonalds place  only think edible menu lettuce cups    The sushi made want gag rice dry its made week ago salmon fresh all least looking because give little couldnt taste it  hollywood roll fried mess   The lobster pillows greasy dry much taste it   Chicken satay extremely dry   Small balls ok if ate just id give 3 stars   Save your 20 bucks else where  If anyone considers food good feel sorry you  <EOR> Definitely worth it   love tapas but tapas restaurant   Yes serve small plates but generally suck     We gambling ordered several dishes   served mac cheese slider buns   Awful   chili dogs utterly disgusting   lobster roll frozen Geno's pizza roll   actually cheaply made egg roll material   Caca   Tuscan bread pizza only bright spot  then waited 30 minutes next 2 plates told waiter we'ren't happy all     We nearly left when last 2 plates salty glazed salmon lettuce cups   lettuce cups pretty good   4 shitty dishes 6 2 pretty good   high batting percentage   Finally if you're Hard Rock's players club discount meal   waiter forgotten club tried slip bill without discount   Nope don't there   If want excellent tapas Julian Serrano's Aria  <EOR> Pretty good food definite change other dining options Hard Rock    Johnny Smalls take small plates creative but also tasty  tried few different things pleased most choices   The menu small but when just 2 people dining menu overwhelming since want try many things but probably only room 2 3 each    We for Chicken waffles fun take dish  syrup covered waffle fries tasty  Guacamole Okay  Probably better over Pink Taco but Pretzel Dip originally wanted   Chili Dogs eat lot chili hot dogs but good  Grilled PB J Really good  Definitely need eat jam    The service pretty good  Worth another trip back next time am town   I back August tried few other items The Finger the salt vinegar chicken tenders bit salty but pretty crispy tasty Cheesecake Pops They sound much tastier really are  disappointed these  Beer Cheese Dip We really liked this  All flavors work pretty well dip   Mac Cheese Flatbread Pretty filing enjoyable  pesto dip gives some flavor probably better if pesto  <EOR> Came Friday around 6 seated right away  Its cute little place nice vibe  Jessie B ordered  few small plates  Since sat table did HH prices  o well  wanted comfy sit bar  So started crab artichoke dip  it real chunks crab super creamy came toasted bread slices  Next sashimi  I know its tapas style place but only 3 pieces  yummy could eaten 3 orders!

I'd back try Sea Bass skewers some other sandwiches   Convenient if you're staying HRH  <EOR> I think seafood items really place bargain AYCE option player's club discount  definitely least par strip buffet food   really something everybody but really wish place more traditional tapas stuff   Made wait half hour seated reservation but once seated food pretty quickly   Service table bogged real easily because all damn plates   Items pretty good   Napoleon salad goat cheese lollipops defiantly favorites   Sushi raw fish items decent   chicken waffle fries interesting but mostly filler    The honey walnut shrimp came peanuts instead     To discount player's card good 2 eaters though waitress very nice borrowed somebody else's me   Drinks pricy   Had sea bass which give them pass time  <EOR> Ehh    great  awful   Was staying HRH tower boyfriend thought would try out  Short ribs AMAZING  ordered twice  Definitely shining star  Seabass good  mind blowing  Mac cheese sliders ehh  Boyfriend loved them  guac flavorless  Don't think seasoned all  honey walnut shrimp good  grilled pbnj great  Would ordered again   Overall pretty hit miss  Service okay  glasses never empty  Good price players card  Okay food   We only made through round half  some reason both ended feeling really sick while eating leave    Ehhhh     <EOR> My husband ate night while staying Hard Rock both really enjoyed it   all eat option good deal if players card discount especially if pretty hungry  If want light meal just order couple items per person then share everything  Some plates larger others  love idea serving American food tapas style   menu varied everyone find something like   service good but found ambiance bit offputting  furniture decor seems going sort club vibe which does match comfort food menu   am sure if just your typical Hard Rock thing trying edgy  maybe gets more bar ish crowded later night    right when just opened dinner  did perfect martini tell much   Unfortunately waited long write review don't remember exactly ordered   standouts remember bacon wrapped dates goat cheese lollipops   loved both those   husband's favorite braised beef short ribs   twice since first time he didn't even share   service very attentive but crowded   think great addition Hard Rock back  <EOR> I thought AYCE tapas fantastic idea is  The food ok   Definitely great   short ribs very good but everything else sweet just deep fried tasting   fish dishes weren't good  Service wasn't very good waitress trying cover many tables  town Firefly other good tapas places won't coming back  <EOR> A lot hype lot payoff   I actually really excited try place  heard pretty good things friends fellow Yelpers but Johnny Smalls fell flat me   The food service just blah  came party seven Friday evening all shocked see empty place was  already boding well mind  seated quite enjoyed seating situation  Comfortable plenty space lighting chat amongst group  took quite bit time before waiter even approached us  He took drink order yet another long gap time until he returned take food order  drinks took some time come he forgot requested lemons even being asked three separate times us  finally just gave up   I started pineapple mojito while fella draft  friends all ordered cocktails well  pleased cocktails unfortunately probably highlight whole meal    With group big able sample just everything off menu least lot it  Most dishes completely unmemorable but some good some bad some ugly tried   The Good no standouts but just ok edible menu items Pineapple Mojito little over carbonated but tasty  Phillyish Best sandwiches  Wish little meltier  PB J Sandwiches Highlight meal  Sad huh? Chicken LIttle NIce spicy kick  much bun   Shorty Tasty but needed more flavor  Jack Coke Overly sweet gritty but ok  The FInger Perfect chicken finger  Blue Cheese chip terrible flavor  Don't try it   The Bad just good Bruschetta Oily bland  Meat Lovers Flat Bread Bland doughy  Toppings flavors didn't together well  Octapussy Batter bland dried out  Nuttin' Honey Overly sweet overall just good dish   The Ugly horrible Poona Tuna EW! Bland flavorless horrible texture  Asada Totally inedible  bite worst thing here   We tried ordering tater tots corn dogs but two items  Other notables friends felt Cow Pie bland just overall horrible burger hummus almost inedible thick consistency  heard another friend table meaty balls surf turf just ok nothing they'd recommend but horrible   The service would The Ugly category well  roped into 18% gratuity since party 7 but waiter very inattentive hard track down long periods time he definitely deserved less   When would request refills he would take forever come when he did he would only refill few glasses leave half them empty wander away  When he did stick around he constantly pressuring order beverages  understand attempting sell drinks but excessive little annoying     Overall place big disappointment looking forward all week  Save your money try buffet town M Wicked Spoon if you're really mood tapas just head straight Firefly    This place really worth your time  <EOR>
