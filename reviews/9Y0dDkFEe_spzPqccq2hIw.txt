Absolutely LOVE place  4 99 wings 1 topping pizza! Used square pieces better but now switched normal triangle cutting  Love service prizes! Prefer Patron over Ceasers any day! <EOR> Mediocre pizza  OK  wings   pizza cold greasy tasted dough frozen instead freshly made  person took order over phone hard understand loud music playing background  expecting better pizza info website  website needs updated badly  Probably won't eating again  <EOR> I come alot especially wings damn good   dont believe come down try some if dont oh well more wings lol  <EOR> Got pizza 15 piece wing sampler all three flavors Lime 'N Pepper Buffalo Garlic Con Queso Loved all   Especially wings!   It's nice having some place good eat when work side town   BRAND new time writing only complaint relative cluelessness staff  But friendly which good enough me   It's gonna regular place eat lunch me    <EOR> I can't really tell if having pepperoni pizza tasting popcorn good thing bad thing   even more odd because know wasn't intentional   For $5 pizza would expect be   But would actually prefer going Little Caesars over this     I more likely won't coming back again  <EOR>
