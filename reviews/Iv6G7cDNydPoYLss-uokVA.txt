Watch particular location  never stocked lazy employees <EOR> The people nice but Chicken tacos didn't really taste much kind blah   could used more seasoning it <EOR> First time ordered carne asada fries but meat tasted funny   didn't back while but gave another shot since living right there   time diarrhea   looking people giving good reviews maybe caught bad days??? <EOR> Wow today all wanted tamale Ok no rice beans fine two tamales  The guy taking orders idiot  He acted stupid because Im guessing English now second language Vegas  Tamales weren't menu board  My friends order 11 00 mine 6 45 just two plain tamales  I watched microwave them overdone hard couldn't eaten  SKIP Robertos Their quality sucks  friends beans cold hard well     As said STAY AWAY LOCATION <EOR> The food good always but customer service needs improve  called place because couldnt find where store plaza  person picked phone speak English period  However understandable  ended finding myself 10 mins circling around plaza  ordered carne asada fries $8 50 tax? around there  guy didnt tell would extra $1 charge every card transaction just happened notice smallest post stating that  Now carne asada fries 9 50? Seriously? ok fault seeing it  THEN waited 30 mins food    why? because ended doing order people behind me  <EOR> Picking few things around corner CVS Bear trying figure dinner   He found Fatburger across way but neither mood THAT  he wanted good Mexican food which sounded alright me    when remembered co worker mine also local RAVED Roberto's   We'd already seen few them around but hadn't yet taken plunge settled   NOW raves   Quality wise DA MUY BUENO BOMB DIGGETY  Bear chicken burrito which HUGE while settled chicken chimichanga which REDONKULOUS  Paired beef quesadilla looked and felt like enough feed army   and reasonable price! Yet unlike your typical fast Mexican food say place bell chihuahua? good stuff yet all heavy greasy   took some time finish didn't leftovers which couldn't taken anyway but didn't feel needed entire defensive line Atlanta Falcons help roll ass outta when done   The place pretty clean service surprisingly fast place run just two guys behind counter   local myself now sure am glad there's bazillion Roberto's around town find whenever need one! <EOR> Love place !!
