I actually really liked China Olive first few times even if little inconsistent sometimes very fresh other times much   I live close easy stop when doing shopping week   Mrs decided trip Wally   other day right when switched dinner many many empty trays food which very disappointing   eventually did fill some trays but all   waited waited waited some more them fill dessert trays but never happened frustrated pay mention hostess   So find came health department came shut them down while  why no dessert   violation something food think pertaining storage preparing said right violation warned before   So guess claims people getting food poisoning true just lucky   worst offense charged full price over 10 bucks person even though didn't really eat very much!  only confused why health department didn't come into eating area tell everyone      So nutshell    eat your own risk!   lost me   freeloader gladly pay meals but if aren't gonna refill food give dessert don't charge full price! <EOR> Gross   The plates pretty gross  seems just wipe off top plates before put them back  bottom plates seemed dirty  Why bottom plates matter? Think when plates stacked eating surfaces plates contact with?  The food very disappointing   I didn't sick though   always nice  <EOR> This most disgusting place ever am seriously surprised health department allowing place stay open found unidentified object soup place nasty windows cannot see filth food GROSSSSSSSS  just depressing environment place waste 10 00 meal  <EOR> Never actually ate but ordered some dishes once disappointing  ordered some shrimp chow mein some beef dish both dishes filled filler  shrimp dish those little shrimp usually find fried rice rest dish all basically frozen vegetables  Everything seemed came cheapest bulk bag product could find Costco  don't know buffet but nothing ate made want back  place open least 7 8 years now must doing something right  Maybe buffet rather cheap good selection but food them nothing would want more of  Chinese food Boulder Sam's Town buffets down street much better pretty sure there's better Chinese food surrounding area  always seems families going parties 5 more probably priced cheap enough family come look other way when comes taste  <EOR> Don't worth money  Closed multiple times health department   owners can't seem figure out  <EOR> Closed without  any explanation  <EOR> I hear place REALLY bad    But tried anyway    They just added mongolian grill  know  Where pick your veggies spices then choice meat would like    That wasn't bad all    the rest buffet kinda questionable  But grill good  <EOR> I wish I'd consulted yelp  came past week eating entire day    super pissed friend insisted finishing crappy $10ish meal while sat sipping sprite trying forget horrifying food I'd just sampled  there!
