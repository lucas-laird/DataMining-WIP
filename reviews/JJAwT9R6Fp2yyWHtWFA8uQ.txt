Tempura ice cream really enjoyed fried batter decently light  ice cream average  Overall sweet taste but still loved it    Overall took away star due them putting way much sauce vinegar based pieces made hard eat  bang buck perspective place definitely 5 Star  Most things fresh AYCE fish quality really good  expected don't use Japanese sushi rice mirin  gone numerous AYCE Japanese buffets Hong Kong US  pretty good bang buck ratio  <EOR> AYCE sushi sounds little sketchy  But place every bit good typical sushi restaurants  thought sushi might pre made but order  couple rolls ordered came crab but more crab 'salad' bit surprised but still very good  wait little long put your order but  atypical when you're eating sushi   What would 5 star review if based food value became 4 star because service inaccuracy  ordered twice both times server forgot put rolls kitchen  <EOR> This place great!!

Sushi favorite food way guys know difference between spicy crab regular crab soft shell crab    I decided try piece just sure but sure enough no soft shell crab no spice all! politely tell waitress believe soft shell crab missing she takes plate away talk sushi chef  However when she returns table she asks even know soft shell crab is? Then she explains chef said soft shell crab should able taste crunchiness throughout roll    I am idiot! should taken picture evidence but seriously just looked California roll no avocado tuna yellowtail top   The service horrible here! <EOR> So good! new fav sushi spot! All employees all nice welcoming too! <EOR> One best town found!

Glad limited just order per person because would've greedy ordered more just because name   Haha  The salmon skin hand roll really dry took quite while finish but everything else ordered good   The food probably 3 5 best but bumped 4 5 because waitress best I'd ever encountered   She super friendly accommodating   don't think ever met anyone good doing job   Sadly didn't name  <EOR> Yes did see place some local dirty dining exposé recently but assumed meant probably working overdrive turn around decided try out  glad came in! selection lunch cut short dinner menu  Everything person dinner lunch  options include lots appetizers well deserts dozens sushi roll options  really enjoyed couple riceless rolls tried especially Johnny roll would HIGHLY recommend it! roll perfect mix inside orgasm sauce die for! egg roll great and vegetarian friendly  also really enjoyed Hot Juicy roll it explosion flavors your mouth spicy but still provides great little kick! rainbow roll also delicious great filling topping thick! few other rolls but those ones stood most  finished mango strawberry mochi which great palette cleanser  service quick friendly  look forward coming back any time come Vegas! <EOR> Gotta try Sex Bomb Love Sushi rolls     delicious!

The service both good bad  male waiter very nice attentive while Korean lady really needs brush customer service  called over just order seaweed salad cucumber salad since wanted something refreshing sushi rolls  first thing she says oh but already ordered lot  First all orders all half rolls only ordering two light appetizers  Secondly doesn't she realize doing AYCE menu? I'd more understanding if ordered bunch stuff but being rather conservative first round  Luckily she took order but never kind experience before  just sucks she take orders while guy only clean give more water  If service better lady's end would considered giving higher rating   Overall would recommend place  food alright but would recommend going Sushi Twister Sakana  Trust  lol  <EOR> Great price all eat wide selection  Sushi fresh prepared prefect   Friendly staff Easy parking  Clean <EOR> Friendly staff great menu  mom hard sore sushi eater staff way find something she would enjoy   would back  <EOR> First time here  Service good food excellent! much rice excellent grade sushi! new sushi joint! <EOR> Ok first all many places eat sushi just top list far!

Eat24 did great job repairing mistakes but quite clear Sushi way yet prepared accept delivery orders   Presentation D+ Not effort made present attractive delivery order  Plain standard styro boxes no adornments even annoying plastic grass! ordered wasabi ginger three only quarter sized serving each  did more expensive throw away chopsticks though 'em d d+  Food quality C My husband loved tuna deep red very little sinew generous fish slices  However said many times heart sushi isn't fish rice  Sushi Way's rice isn't good  No coherence if order some sushi special sauce ponzu instead standard soy put directly fish before sending out  Guess rice when finally it! Yep soggy no cohesion very difficult eat  But again quality fish very good   The bottom line? Clearly person responsible contracting Eat24 didn't consider ramifications offering sushi delivery  hope person charge social media instruct staff proper delivery prep technique  yes presentation  order them again prejudice though  <EOR> Ahhhmazinggg!! decided check check Sushi Way because great reviews  Wow  did disappoint  greeted Alicia she absolutely nice  took care drinks  Then Jay came along    boyyyy   did he take good care us!! let choose everything  feeling quite adventurous super glad did  selections amazing!! attention detail simply excellent  can't stop raving  Kudos chefs!
