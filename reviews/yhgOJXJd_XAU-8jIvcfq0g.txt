Nothing physically printed all iPad based pictures but labeled Chinese  Pictures any sort order nor did seem waitresses spoke much English  Luckily two spoke fluent mando mine listening only other wasn't even paying attention  LOL       We ordered pig ear cold appetizer chicken gizzard skewers bbq shrimp skewers lamb skewers sausage skewers corn skewer duck tongue skewer chicken heart skewers plate grilled squid    The pig ear cold appetizer nicely done  Nice light flavoring mild amount Sichuan peppercorn numbness    Chicken gizzard lamb skewers seasoned 'Sichuan style' that's im calling it w chili powder grounded Sichuan peppercorn powder  numbing effect definitely STRONG skewers hence why im calling Sichuan style vs xinjiang style uses chili powder cumin    Duck tongue nice  Just beware bone can't eat  lol   Grilled shrimp skewer seasoned well but different seasoning other skewers    The grilled squid super soft tender  Little bit underseasoned but still good    The sausage skewer pretty decent  reminded longanisa Filipino sausage  Plump juicy sweet  probably longanisa skewer  Lol sausage something wanna eat rice  XD   I mean food pretty decent  punch numbness skewers unexpected but something I'd dock rating for  But menu omg PLEASE FIX ! ITS DIGITAL ! ORGANIZE ! ADD ENGLISH ! Don't know English? use google translate ! D literally pissed off during meal  ordering should hard D even if normal menu items listed all Chinese only wouldn't mad  Grr  Lol   On bright side brought full container ice water w lemon every time ours empty pretty promptly  <EOR> Came later night catch friend  place well lit clean   Asian karaoke playing background  we such hard time reading menu off iPad   categorized they're simply pic stitches items available pictures other yelpers shared   Personally since iPad would suggest categorize options example folder named Skewers    containing skewer options folder named appetizer containing other smaller items  Also menu consistent language  Some photos English some don't  speak Chinese but don't really read Chinese almost ordered garlic flavored fish thinking just mild version spicy based photo shown   Luckily waiters very friendly helpful!  Now food   fish ordered average  also ordered chicken skeleton duck neck squid  Which all same flavor strong cumin   love cumin but didn't want everything ordered taste same   The private karaoke rooms occupies half restaurant very well sound proofed! Didn't bother all well done!  In conclusion bad experience  Clean friendly average food  originally wanted give 3 stars because truly think they're just average but decided 4 because return probably just chicken skeleton Togo pick while watch tv home something  <EOR> i myself when walked 3am  said closed  even though open sign posted hours says otherwise  guess cuz white <EOR> Well bar pretty cool    The food?
