However still great idea place that! <EOR> It's just couple blocks away Fremont St Experience downtown Vegas  Monday afternoon   place dead   park really small shopping center park middle  There's playground stage   only busy store Cheffini's hot dogs   The unique aspect place shopping center made shipping containers  tried take some pictures but guard said wasn't allowed take pictures   last location where told couldn't take picture because currently lawsuit  shopping center corner entrances each side but side locked guard other entrance  area seemed safe but now wondering safe  <EOR> The brainchild Zappos' CEO Tony Hsieh lovely little mini shopping park nice break degenerate gambling habits   No doubt businesses well restrooms ecologically made recycled shipping containers  businesses all operate modular metal squares instead traditional brick and mortar spaces   There handful stores selling anything jerky art decor bath home goods toys restaurants slinging tacos 'Made real Mexicans slogan advertises' BBQ joint candies   The center park contain giant tree house playground even sitting area stage projection screen perhaps late night movies   It's far walk Fremont Experience  Just look giant praying mantis it breathes fire night! entrance  <EOR> Pretty interesting place would nice some casual dating spot   lot different shops visit see  <EOR> The Container Park nothing anything ever seen  concept building stores shipping containers mixed vibrant colors elaborate children's playground stage lawn great combination    If extra time downtown always where hang especially night  If kids definitely spot would take them  almost feels little urban oasis    My issue Container Park number stores store hours price ranges stores  While each store seems very unique seem enough stores  easily blow through them all twenty minutes  stores also close before park if come night don't expect browsing anything  stores also seem very high prices  Even candy ice cream food overpriced    The first time came made special trip but bit mistake  should waited until area more things do  <EOR> I just review place!

I would liked more variety existing shops   range recycled jewellery housewares artsy women's apparel goodies frozen desserts cupcakes art galleries   Fun browse but enough interest keep attention very long   Then again perhaps shorter attention span most other people    ?  We ended visit Container Park chilling Coffeehouse just short walk away    Great way conclude afternoon another plus favour Container Park! <EOR> Wow! park exceeded expectations  Clean family friendly perfect parents could use glass wine or 2 watch kiddos climbing down coolest tree house  beautiful day catch girlfriend could stop commenting perfect park is  Very relaxing fun people watch side Vegas definitely worth bragging about  normally don't downtown 6 year old diva because questionable neighborhood but all positive changes definitely worth drive support local businesses well ever growing city  <EOR> Great place hang family! shops Restaurants around giant tree playland  play land isn't just kids its fun big enough adults kids again!   Great spot everyone bars adults enjoy drink restaurants feed hungry shops buy some goodies    Downtown Las Vegas spot every age! <EOR> I'm definitely fan Container Park  container architecture cool fun walk around  feels very inviting cozy  lot places sit relax   But far perfect just yet  many stores right now but I'd surprised if most them survive long  few seem unique but many them very run of the mill tchotchke psuedo style stores don't sell anything real substance   And Pork Beans? $13 some sausage beans? Really? Ridiculous prices container restaurant   So hopefully park survive  Essentially really nice environment hang at   I just hope figure alternative fuel use fire breathing praying mantis whose burnt fumes don't give people headaches  <EOR> First time visited Container Park thought interesting concept   recently family staying downtown probably only fifteen minutes   Even though Friday night pretty dead there   place suitable many return visits unless really love restaurants there  <EOR> I think coolest idea  immediately intrigued when drove saw praying mantis spits fire! However when actually sound fire terrifying!! way loud    I loved all little stores inside  Although pretty cold walk around cannot wait summer  great area live music jazz band playing music plays around whole center  <EOR> For 100th review wanted review something gets 5 stars  place would more but 5 limit  p  Whenever Vegas find myself doing things aren't typically Vegas y   place falls right into category  Family friendly all way 9pm place boasts many neat features    1  neat touch sensor game played solo multiple people  free! 2  lawn concerts comfortable patio furniture blankets large lego like bricks kids  3  best tree house!

multi level tree house slides want deem life sized bop it  kids both blast live music plenty people people watching if  your thing  arrived 5 extremely crowded but time 6PM rolled around died down quite bit  may time when hipsters begin standing line down slides perfect photo OP but children didn't mind  just kept trying convince down slides since kept seeing many grown ups down them  Unfortunately stomach little sorts first visit  certainly try them next  Thanks building container park!

 Nice one  <EOR> I idea Container Park but really misses mark  Store unique but small lacking ability any decent amount items doesn't lot stores  also bit eyesore  Parking horrible especially busy times  <EOR> This place pretty cool   Bring kiddos!

If shop making killing imagine sales per square feet as long rent isn't bad ! great! But shops confined those containers although all perhaps risk making it  shops selling food drinks may well enough but boutique shops afraid empty buying customers  Disney art shop some nice art sell but just see lot shoppers just look    It's nice concept  consumer good place burn hour two  But destination park shopping center  see myself going drink grab something light eat although probably same things elsewhere but definitely shop    The place kid friendly nice tree house play place center but no kids allowed 9 00 PM  Oh irony  why such good portion real estate kids when only limited time  Perhaps best safety children downtown all    The performance area nice  There's even barbershop behind it  Why back there? know but nice use old boxcars  course cannot miss fire breathing preying mantis park entrance   It's industrial art urban setting its retailers hoping generate enough sales stay business years come  art part but thing may trouble staying relevant town never mind making enough money  Even Mayor Oscar Goodman tried very hard Las Vegas city art but just isn't  People don't come Vegas art  There's enough locals fully support art aspect alone  Art struggled town   It would nice day true art museum town different art installations exhibits display  am just talking art galleries inside mega hotels  But realize once again Las Vegas  <EOR> went secret walls once before but during day when kids allowed  Much more fun night 21+ crowd  The place aesthetically really beautiful lots look admire   Drink prices steep wouldn't recommend getting alcohol overpriced just average tasting   The actual event though really fun! pulled stage won free shirt  It's cute place sure coming back   If want free parking park few blocks away walk  pay  you <EOR> Visited today group friends enjoyed wonderful restaurant Perch   Location setting inviting great way enjoy Park    menu really nicely balanced   enjoyed Power Salad !

Only entrance exit?  carded walk into here?  No outside food drink?  Kids allowed but leave 9 00pm?  great they've tried create family friendly environment but once leave you're quickly reminded you're still corner Fremont 7th   My favorite aspect Container Park focuses showcasing local businesses   seems decent mix retail food drink spots along spaces reserved art galleries   sure stop JoJo's Jerky   Later night curfew into effect which allows adults fun playground   Neat but really something feel needs repeat visit   First time visitors though sure check ninja game three story slide!

After all hoopla say am disappointed  must missed lot visiting day time all 4 star Yelp reviews something going on  lol  What hell least checked know now  honestly say survive crazy world without another visit here    I am happy positive new vibe given Downtown community though <EOR> Love he people atmosphere great kids play parents relax food really good entertainment great <EOR> Love having spot downtown  present within present within another present  mix restaurants bars boutiques stage performances  even kid's play area center    Surrounding parking pay hour unless you're lucky enough grab something few blocks down    Check events calendar because ton events hosted throughout year    My only complaint still haven't energy exploring some higher level boutiques which means other folks might either  Laziness  epidemic  <EOR> In heart feel best places visit Vegas  Since lived less year place least once month  Dude outside mechanical praying Mantis plays music he shoots fire air testicles  night turns into adult only spot  bars cool plus night play movies huge screen some nights  <EOR> This favorite find weekend Vegas trip! Well worth walk down Fremont Street imagine more locals spot   The Container Park just named several shipping containers stacked 3 floors top each other repurposed into shops restaurants large clean play space nicely landscaped open seating area middle venue  containers large enough people walk large windows open garage door style bay doors feel open inviting  wandered into several restaurants bars drinks relaxing less hectic Friday night typically thinks Fremont street  <EOR> Just sold place  It seems morphed into giant playground shops restaurants etc  secondary attraction! I'm sure done heaps improve Downtown's image ? offer alternatives nearby residents but 4 times still feel lukewarm it  imbibed many establishments serving adult bevvies but heard good things most them! I mention place visitors since fairly unique may worth showing towners  <EOR> Not sure why taken long review container park but better late never   First off when first heard container park intrigued once opened definately become staple downtown place end taking lot if town friends   The first thing you'll notice container park giant praying mantis art car outside  If you've burning man familiar art you'll notice love it  all other friends always such giant shock when flames burst it   The concept container park entire shopping center made shipping container novel concept works better some stores more others  There's several restaurants few bars clothing art boutiques  perfect encapsulation new downtown Vegas   One factor really bumps dual use  During daytime great family friendly park where kids play slides grass but 9 21 over only place know where drunk adults playground themselves   There's also staging area where concerts live band playing lot during summer they're goin doing movies   The only real downsides opinion parking horrible but  atypical downtown when first opened some businesses weren't really made run such limited retail space but definately improved love coming here <EOR> I really place  offers variety things people all ages  something different locals don't want always walk fremont surrounded crowds  subscribed events emails lot different things participate in  Spring wine walk year GREAT  park kids nice since closed am worried them running off  <EOR> Honestly pretty   meh  lot people seemed somewhat abandoned other poor shop owners minimal traffic  Tried weekend week day much difference  <EOR> Great place come if kids  play secure kids area no worries  Great vibe especially early evenings  Cool little shops eateries inside  Hard believe downtown Las Vegas! come all time never bad experience  <EOR> I'm first timer gave 4 stars! enjoyed fire mantis front noticed people gathering steps perfect distance fire view all  park very creative modern something new Vegas  greeted security which great secure bring little ones during day  There's many establishments inside whether you're vegetarian vegan there's many place choose can't see everything visit but perfect place meet browse stores kids little play date cutest tree house middle huge screen movies music videos  Such enjoyable place be! <EOR> Wanting away typical canopy vibe decided cross Boulevard over Fremont East afternoon made way Container Park  very neat looking place some attractive looking retailers restaurants  respected encouraged recycling everything used park including compost friendly plates dinnerware  playground courtyard made appealing many families observed    I would definitely return night when enjoy park's scheduled performances along meal  <EOR> I don't really it  isn't much Container Park entice stay more few minutes  only place any interest coming visit here   The stores small since entire place essentially made shipping containers  much bang your buck low expectations you'll good enjoy novelty move on  <EOR> I visited downtown container park year ago almost day couple girlfriends  looking reason away strip during day decided take trip into downtown just walk around see all neat new stuff down there  final destination container park perfect place grab bite eat sit outside rest feet while enjoying some music people watching then some shopping before heading back strip  highly recommend place families because great play areas kids  really neat concept hope spreads more towns  <EOR> This Place great fun!
