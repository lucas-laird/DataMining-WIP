I would love come back again try coffee food items   Only side wall decorated flowers greenery while other side pretty plain  Wish decorated other wall well everyone isn't fighting tables flower wall  Café Lola opened month ago hopefully they're still adding some finishing touches place   Also wanted try Lola's Signature Vanilla Rose Latte but thing cost $12 18!!!!!!!! latte!?!?! oolong rose tea organic rose water milk vanilla crushed rose petals served rose macaron  Why heck expensive!?! because there's organic rose water!?! __ oh geez  swear minute word organic something   the price shoots straight up! kind price better lose 15 pounds IMMEDIATELY drinking this!  This really 3 star review but bumped more star because décor  <EOR> Super cute new cafe ! hazelnut latte soy milk   crazy amount options milk varieties reminds LA  breakfast sandwich super tasty loads avocado no skimping !  The price steep but willing pay quality   pretty inside cafe but missing coziness  hard put your finger   <EOR> I dying check place since seen all over social media  place defiantly cute place take cute pictures enjoy upbeat atmosphere!   The place PACKED when limited seating small building general almost made want leave but dying try place stayed  customer service honestly good pricing menu items little pricey just coffee food items  know workers over whelmed place packed sure customer service would better less stressed atmosphere!   I berry toast which absolutely amazing! Very sweet very yummy  also lavender latte good but best lavender latte had  would again but would later day avoid crowd I around 1pm Sunday would fancy cocktail drinks try avoid morning brunch coffee time    Overall think very good cute place too! defiantly cute spot meet girls days  But little overrated worth hype  <EOR> My boyfriend just checked place lunch  place crowded people when walked in  decoration super cute modern high end feeling  There's also DJ  place  ordered Barneys Toast Butter green tea hazelnut latte cookie  food very fun unique taste  really it! drinks bit bland but willing try again  Cookie light sweet  REALLY LIKED IT  enjoyed experience LOT would come back try other stuff  definitely recommend everyone come try out  <EOR> A super cute coffee brunch stop  ordered egg sandwich pretty surprised much gave comparison other coffee shops  cupcake drink tasted pretty good added cupcake bite   only downside would bit pricey  However expect super hip coffee shop Summerlin?   I'm also into taking selfies whatnot but customers come definitely are  majority customers saw mostly busy trying perfect picture filter before even touched food  almost funny watch because many people obsessing over it! those Instagram lovers your spot    Overall love environment  I'd come back another egg sandwich maybe day try those vegan donuts  <EOR> This place more being Instagram worthy less actual quality    I really wanted place  Don't wrong adorable set super cute decor but if end spending $63 what's essentially toast bougie tea expect more supplier  no problem dropping cash something deem worth price tag but no way could justify paying much did product turned Cafe Lola    My friend each ordered Vanilla Rose Latte which supposedly signature drink theirs  tasted water very faint essence rose  Definitely worth equivalent $12 96 paid each drink  also ordered Butter toast which basically single piece toast almond butter some fruit top  If spending $10 18 piece TOAST expect more served maybe thick artisanal bread baked morning some kind garnish side  something could've made home half price    My friend Let's Avocuddle toast which looked little more hearty but still didn't warrant paying $10 56  She also salad probably only thing ordered felt price matched product    For 5 items total $63 felt flushed money down toilet when paid it  absolutely worth all  Again no problem paying amount if product turned matched quality far it  Basically if all care Insta worthy food drinks your place  I'd personally suggest saving your money place turns more quality product your dollar  <EOR> Cafe Lola such sweet decor going on  pink flower wall neon sign adds such touch minimalistic chic theme  many opportunities take some pretty hip pictures here   When entered place packed but luckily group just left empty table   Although wall menu employee gave paper menu  She pretty nice way  They offer coffee tea wine champagne baked goods food   I ended ordering 20 oz Matcha frappé over $7 tax 5 macarons box $14   The drink actually tasted blended unsweetened soy milk  did whip cream top though  macarons soft delicious  favorite would probably raspberry flavored   In opinion Cafe Lola bit pricier side but would come back try tea  <EOR> Honestly place really cute   really disappointed customer service  Took girlfriend today breakfast  Ordered Avocado toast salmon lox toast   Food really good but overpriced  disappointment comes guy making coffee  Totally rude   ordered chai literally tasted water   asked more dirty chai he Seemed irritated  making drink   still tasted awful   didn't bother asking again   Didn't want deal poor customer service  just read another commenters review same complaint he      coffee lattes tasting water downed  <EOR> Cafe Lola super cute!  menu small but trendy    different toasts salads baked goods and champagne wine but coffee!  Both sister horchata latte which made almond milk honey cinnamon   with latte art!  usually stay away flavored coffees because tend super sweet but wasn't  put just enough honey add flavor but overly sweet   cinnamon also cut sweetness honey   both enjoyed it!  The place SUPER crowded but staff top it   runner picking orders delivering them tables immediately   several people working counter line moved quickly   having just opened week ago top things!  The decor totally cute could see people having bridal baby showers there   definitely place Sunday girls brunch date vis vis Sex City     back sure! <EOR> The epitome mediocre! Over priced drinks food don't fooled instagram able interior is  Paying $10 small latte taste Starbucks Coffee bad day  However cheese platter pretty good  Could use more 2 pieces bread stingy bastards <EOR> Great environment beautiful floral blush pink white interior ! lavender coffee amazing     salmon toast okay nothing really special but tasty ! Highly recommend! <EOR> SUCH cute place grab small bite eat coffee tea  pretty busy when almost no available seating but would've waited because knew wanted try place  Kind hole in the wall type cafe if wasn't google maps wouldn't recognized seen where just driving by  berry toast super yummy! iced mocha boyfriend breakfast sandwich fresh squeezed OJ  Everything great but boyfriend wasn't full off dish which why mentioned first sentence 'small bite' eat  held over hour two but then he needed something else fill up  When ordering quiet few workers behind counter which great but all seemed pretty frantic busy hurry stressed etc  friendly but just felt little rushed when ordering  heard them apologize table next wait down barista  All in all great place! back  <EOR> The cutest cafe ever to!! Super clean very cute chic  love decor there! employees really friendly takes while your order come but probably because made love froze really good tea okay could flavor tea stronger but other love!!! <EOR> I really enjoyed place! Lovely decor great menu selections  ordered salmon lox toast horchata iced latte almond milk both delicious made promptly  Total came $19 which thought little pricey but understand you're paying nice ambiance well  friend ordered breakfast sandwich which came bounty avocado biscuit thick fluffy definitely could split between two people  can't wait try more items! <EOR> This morning came cafe Lola ordered few things try  While aren't critics girlfriend myself kiddo foodies heart  shared few things see all may started Beauty Beet salad Berry Delicious toast best friend lemon tart two year old vegan sprinkled donut  She matcha peach tea everything ate perfect  even sure if house made gelato menu yet but good refreshing  also shows business even though its infancy working hard continue evolve serve its customers  beautiful quiet morning pretty busy week day  owners interacting customers family  tell work hard love do  did see tip good place kids let note    responsible enough call ahead bring own personal booster seat isn't changing table bathroom but maybe soon they'll booster seats don't see high chairs future but could come perhaps    I'm going say mom very well behaved potty trained two year old if don't child would sit quietly use soft voices  during 1 2 hour movie theater wouldn't take them smith center show    probably save special cafe adult outings BUT couple other moms walked daughters under 5 all behaved sweet see something beautiful restaurant brought many people enjoy cafe predominantly women couples  Even some ordered counter left because always enjoy great food drinks home kids all ages among chaos right? haha    If came work meeting quiet if came Date chic if came lunch delicious you'll glad stopped by    but blown away hospitality back  people found water soil  keep Cafe Lola blooming!

Nothing special cafe  drink avocuddle toast bill came $15 avocuddle simply just whole avocado sliced toast  positive note clean place nice decorations pretty fast serving drinks food  <EOR> Ok if all want toast wine  No sandwiches anything substantial  Won't backo <EOR> We Cafe Lola since followed them long Instagram waiting them open  cute cafe decked millennial pink honestly sucker anything themed well  owners helping run food orders generally checking people     We weekend before large rush grabbed few drinks food  price kind expensive get  vanilla rose latte macadamia milk croissant  bill closer $18 20  friends toast charcuterie plate pretty pricey   The vanilla rose latte comes macaron which isn't bad deal but definitely worth $12  put rose petals top foam which nice touch  latte itself kind watery but think might macadamia milk  Since real milk doesn't nice fluffy foam usually whole milk  latte still didn't ton flavor  okay but great   The toast charcuterie plate really good but definitely worth price  might toast again if feeling zesty but charcuterie plate probably somewhere else better deal   Overall Cafe Lola nice cute cafe hang your friends chit chat  staff friendly owners help orders  made good experience overall  wouldn't say place best terms value flavor your food but same time great place enjoy company your friends family  <EOR> This place gives off ultimate fancy brunch vibes  cute modern little cafe serves more traditional coffee  starters they're doing great! Especially advertising however some kinks still need worked on    Although products picture perfect  tastes aren't quite yet  ordered lavender latte where could taste bit lavender but ultimately    just tasted watery  Similar iced vanilla latte ordered    Also staff menu don't advertise great machine creates adorable designs lattes  think maybe giving customers option could improve place bit    The menu however pricer side  don't wrong good quality products don't come cheap  But don't think signature featured drink should vanilla latte rose petals  $12  mean if some alcohol then maybe it'd attract audience even more    2 watery drinks bit relieved didn't try signature latte    It also gets fairly busy rarely any spots  suggest coming morning weekday rush since many normally work  There's much seating fairly warm inside    The staff great they're all friendly dressed theme attire  walking into little france cafe  all extremely attentive towards detail  TRUST ME  when special event reserved entire wall signature cafe lola neon sign    The staff literally shuffling back forth during entire visit just move tables centimeter  Kinda sucked since ended background ALL photos since tables reserved weren't able take any other great pictures cafe lola sign floral walls  <EOR> Be prepared spend upwards $40 mediocre food drink if you're trying feed two  But least you'll Instagram cred when post photo flower wall  <EOR> Definitely prettiest most feminine coffee shops Vegas! menu serves unique lattes light meals avocado toasts parfaits croissants cheese boards etc teas even some alcoholic beverages  space itself huge many 4 seater tables ok studying but more suited socializing  Prices higher side taste wise everything good but nothing mind blowing  If love color pink want super cute instagram picture definitely here! <EOR> 50 Shades PINK   I'm uncertain if Cafe Lola wanted crazy obsessed insta photo junkies but definitely she's getting! coffee shop damn cute full sassy little decor wish living room  favorite unfiltered dame stopped quick look coffee go    The concept sophisticated chic lets honest millennial's don't mind over paying avocado toast coffee long selfies poppin!
