However worth unorganized trouble through    This restaurant would benefit changes need made! looks recently changed locations maybe doing worked them previous location but current location set building doing definitely doesn't work  main suggestion setting drip coffee station front person taking order gives them mug directs them drip station right next them  Another suggestion possibly allow people sit down before taking orders if staying placing order go  order process very confusing even waiter trying keep organized all over place! few adjustments could definitely see myself enjoying experience more  <EOR> This place great !

I ordered Sonora which filled Carne Asada guacamole  flavorful taste freshness  soup came light good compliment crepes despite 100+ weather outside    What's more appreciate good service friendliness staff say felt right home place  Lou owner came over asked everything made sure enjoying food   Aside food nice eatery  decor nice  only downside reason lost star fact open during hours normal working people would able enjoy food  Since they're opposite side town I'd deliberate effort trek eat some crepes  Regardless definitely worth it! <EOR> I came brunch fairly busy but packed  mom greeted asked if ever before  Since said no waitress explained could order counter seat ourselves dishes would brought us  She very friendly!  We ordered Rosarito chorizo scrambled egg cheese guacamole Berry Delight strawberries blueberries blackberries   Rosarito came side bananas cottage cheese which wasn't listed menu bit unprepared choice register since sharing it  Anyway ordered cottage cheese crepe  sweet crepe didn't come any side  option adding potatoes but figured portions might big finish if ordered it   My first impression crepes huge come hungry! Rosarito crepe okay  picked because seemed bit more fillings some other offerings under breakfast crepes  chorizo dry tasted ground beef me  didn't notice egg crepe much only really noticed other ingredients especially chorizo  gave fair amount guacamole cool but wasn't really seasoned seemed just smashed avocado  Berry Delight also just okay  liked gave lot fresh berries didn't skimp but strawberries bit sour wished more whipped cream side powdered sugar  I'd probably opt sweet crepe bit filling think other crepes goat cheese Nutella just fruit inside  If want try multiple crepes company friends family recommend splitting different crepes sample  Basically main savory crepe dessert crepe!  Overall crepes fair wasn't super impressed another trip back out  However service good place seems pretty popular even weekdays  <EOR> Carne Asada Guac salsa Crepe    Did your head just explode??? place blow your mind    Think anything awesome then wrap crepe becomes even more awesome  any awesome sandwich burrito but instead crepe used  bbq clucker etc   Amazballs! already know sweet stuff going good    I read reviews knocking owner but kind owner edge  thought he cool made plenty recommendations  place busy weekends prepare wait unless roll your lazy behind bed early  <EOR> Crepe Expectations exceeded great expectations! menu great would even customize your liking  staff very warm friendly checks sure all well   Sit bar watch them your crepes watch monitor above bar   such great experience back more time before driving back home   great way end vacation! <EOR> I am glad traveled quite distance strip enjoy adorable place  husband both mood some fresh delicious crepes zero desire walk Paris hotel casino  looked crepes Yelp really impressed 4 5 star rating    This adorable little place nestled strip center ton other restaurants  nice little seating area outside interior isn't big  ordered Monterrey breakfast crepe bacon eggs peppers cheese chilies Crepelete Swiss eggs thick smoked ham Monkey Nutella sliced bananas whip cream chocolate drizzle  Each crepe totally different delicious  generous fillings  given healthy dose cheese  Monkey super good perfectly other crepes coffee  camera over crepe griddles see them each order  eggs even made order no scoop warmer here    They offer fresh cucumber lemon water drink along variety mimosas beers soft drinks coffee  even mimosa flight!

Perfect Combination heaping full fresh strawberries fresh whipped cream chocolate drizzle powdered sugar   Hubby William Tell which sauteed apples caramel fresh whipped cream powdered sugar   WOW!  The restaurant itself located large strip mall next indoor exotic car dealership   small inside but every space well utilized   being said building does face west during evenings sun blaring making restaurant warm side   color inside mainly black purple eggplant'ish accented marble stone glass very classy contemporary opinion   Somehow managed fit small coffee station where sugar honey creamer tap water cucumber water complementary available   Speaking coffee also full service coffee house serving Illy's think??? cappuccino espresso latte coffee hot teas   Feeling little tipsy?  also beer wine!

I came because saw place mentioned food network  thought would great place when visiting Vegas wrong  inside daughter party 6 arrived  all ordered sat down  wasn't very busy all  However cashier orders wrong upset owner Lou very much  He furious started yelling insisted never order wrong said would pay again if wanted new order  Well didn't sit party 6 very well owner other guest into full blown argument  owner guests all yelling cursing each other  never saw such terrible customer service ever life! movie! owner came behind counter walked towards guests 5 women 1 man and he charged them if he going hit women  disgusted even more  mean cursing yelling while children establishment bad enough  But once he walked towards women called them bitches done! he told them leave scared bystander because guest threw all food ground attempted push over table! owner should never allow situations small wrong order hand! customer service beyond terrible! guest walked even broke some wine glasses left table previous customers! When owner came back inside he rude everyone never even apologized terrifying altercation just took place!  If want come possibly caught cross fire angry customers battle disgusting owner place you! If recommend going somewhere else because only matter time before he's rude someone else into another terrifying brawl  never back! <EOR> Perfect experience every time go!  food delicious but customer service second none!! Try mimosa trio    white peach amazing   Best thing savory crepe sweet share   Best both worlds! <EOR> Oh gosh   I seriously can't say enough good things place!

Most standard beers only $3 pretty extensive wine specialty drinks menu creperie   also offer treat all you can drink serve yourself water infused lemon cucumber   Yum   If want plain water think might request specially   Bother flavors subtle enough think even finicky folks handle it   Warning crepe per person sufficient   expected street food style where may want couple each   Bad move    discovered three crepes two people far much food     I tried Sunday Morning which just hoping Sunday morning egg seasoned potatoes cheese wrapped crepe   yummy savory breakfast but honestly such hearty filling crepe itself kind fades into background   said much prefer standard omelet primarily side bites mostly crepe   love eggy crepes     also tried Avalon pears goat cheese walnuts honey   flavors pear goat cheese walnut rich delicious   However honey bit overwhelmingly sweet   guess eating three bites instead 30 time better anyway   More later!  Summary great variety food friendly staff ample creativity dishes good prices just wish crepe food ratio little higher    enough deterrent keep away though  <EOR> I love Sonora lunch followed delicious sweet crepe split dessert! <EOR> This place great selection sweet savory crepes coupled excellent service!
