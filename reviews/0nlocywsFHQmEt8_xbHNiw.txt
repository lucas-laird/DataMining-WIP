Overall definite spot add lunch rotation would revisit dinner well  Chinese spot anyone appreciate even P F  Chang's crowd  <EOR> While coworkers swear place must say initial experience was   meh    I placed order house pan fried noodles  lady answered also believe owner let know price menu actual price food  While thought strange didn't care because starving   When picked order timeframe stated food wasn't ready  big deal but lady then told house special pan fried noodles which menu reads shrimp chicken beef could only 1 option  forced choose shrimp  pretty annoyed point because only started order when came pick up   When finally back office looked food sitting pool grease  wasn't very much sauce flavor matter  oil flavored fried noodles shrimp lot broccoli top  happy   Maybe one time boo boo rare unfortunate experience  way won't catch trying place again any time soon  <EOR> First off probably cleanest Asian restaurants quite ALOT since San Francisco   Before ordered greeted asked if wanted start off any drinks all cup iced water  When arrived MUCH cleaner typical Vegas tap water 95% restaurants Vegas served  When asked why way owner Lily told because used advanced filters also UV bacteria killers   Lily continued tell new energy drink started serving pretty recently brand XS   She brought information sheet compared XS Red Bull Monster many other energy drinks  XS much lower calories sugar sodium calories  decided try pink grapefruit which amazing woke instantly  Caffeine usually very little effects prefer only strongest coffee find but learning XS healthier because extremely high Vitamin B made take look healthier options   Onto food ordered sweet sour pork beef lo mein rice seafood soup honey glazed shrimp walnuts beef eggplants fried cream cheese dumplings  food definitely fresh good quality which made extremely tasty  fried cream cheese dumplings very crispy cream cheese added just right amount balance dish  beef lo mein very tender eggplants slightly crunchy outer layer  soup slightly spicy tasted great!  I'd definitely come back early lunch next time Vegas! tons parking spots although may 5 10 minute drive strip nice part Vegas bit more peaceful  <EOR> We ate last week wasn't anything excited about  Lots food usual  Nothing very good  decent best needed salt  know salt needed Chinese food! Yes!! won't back! Customer service great <EOR> The food very good!!! sure come back    The service excellent place cute! <EOR> We always look good Chinese something different unique   husband read reviews decided should try place out   hadn't chance review didn't know expect but if he excited menu then knew must good   So usual he'd given menu once over made selections   only server woman she very  friendly she took order off turned obtain pot tea    oolong wonderful  three choices all seemed inviting    In little she pulled table cart loaded beautiful display big plate set four steamed Chinese buns sliced scallions hoisin sauce   four thinly sliced crispy duck skin pieces placed bit scallion onto bun dab hoisin sauce smells terrific crunch skin bun even better    They served rest duck cut into small pieces bone served plum sauce   several other dishes all good duck!  very simple restaurant great service terrific food   Just right something new! <EOR> While waiting takeout order party 4 seniors non Asian leaving big smiles faces   females then said favorite restaurant town!  Everything always great!    She then grabs all business cards sitting cashier walks door saying some more business!    I stared takeout menu good 15 minutes   freakin Chinese food!  know like!!  didn't know taking long but ended ordering ma po tofu house special lo mein   then think can't remember last time ordered ma po tofu driving home   NOW REMEMBER why don't   Everything takeout bag total mess sauce   won't mistake again   tofu dish great   used ground chicken instead pork which made taste bit lighter usual rest sauce stayed container pretty good     The noodles other hand sub par   wish read Clint B's review before making order   totally agree opinion lo mein wouldn't order again   Excessive oil   Chef's gone wild!  I fully plan coming back Peking duck which most likely change whole opinion place  <EOR> I quite few Chinese restaurants   really wanted place but just couldn't based food had   only ones restaurant ordered following 5 dishes lunch beef chow fun sweet sour pork crispy sole filet HK chow mein chicken chicken mushroom   only thing tasted good beef chow fun   s s pork okay fish didn't taste fresh dry but still edible   two chicken plates funny taste kind sour maybe used old chicken   The guy took order also cooked food   took while cook food   But taking order bringing food no asked food asked if wanted anymore water   Considering only ones though service would better since seemed family run restaurant   The only reason gave two stars clean restaurant since most everything else below average  <EOR> Delicious food  surprised see ownership changed planning going Tiger Sushi but REALLY glad LongJin gave try  service beyond amazing   bothering much but still checking you  some salt n pepper tofu shrimp fried rice  Both delicious!! also recommend firecracker shrimp appetizer  <EOR> Honestly impressed  firecracker shrimp good but spring rolls lil soggy  combo meat entree would pretty good except steak chicken strips quality meat which main thing look any restaurant but esp Chinese    <EOR> Okay probably soon write rave review place but just ordered weekend really good  Best mongolian beef outside PF Changs  Just right amount spicy scallions onions really really tasty  Fried rice pretty good although don't understand why chinese restaurants all insist using frozen peas carrots  just aren't good people! Other good items included Roasted duck house lo mein salt pepper calamari probably better right fryer and    coups de gras    Nutella Banana dessert Eggrolls? Yep just read right  more delicious could every imagine! Definitely ordering again  little pricey delivery took lot longer she estimated won ton soup mediocre    thus four five star review  <EOR> For place  supposed your typical local neighborhood chinese restaurant highly impressed  restaurant's interior design pleasant television  came during lunch most outstanding lunch specials seen chinese restaurant    Depending vegetable lunch special  came eggroll your choice soup choice white fried rice entree itself filling! only thing didn't vegetables soaked grease    Service point felt guy table whenever done plate if looked wanted question  Felt most important woman there! Great experience if you're looking local chinese restaurant  little more upscale looks service give place try  <EOR> It should sign when walked only customers sight  surprised time however completing dining experience understood why  location restaurant itself looks nice spacious comfortable booths  service lacking lady served may Owner well  Anyhow wanting stop check spring valley area  read yelp reviews seemed promising boy disappointed  both ordered lunch specials decided sweet pungent shrimp which hard find Las Vegas some reason? lunch special $9 consisted cup egg flower soup which just broth corn very bland cup rice 7 tiny shrimp  Sweet Pungent sauce delicious just enough food enjoy on  lunch special mere appetizer $9 bent over teased without full penetration  also hot sauna there  understand trying limit A C consumption but discomfort your patrons sweating during meal  ridiculous bland food shitty service no personality high prices no A C think should just close shop call day  business apparently doing well lost all hope just don't care  won't around much longer guarantee it! Good Riddens! <EOR> I place bookmarked since opened  located neighborhood excited another takeout delivery option choose from    Today lazy Sunday fella decided order some food delivered dinner  know best way judge restaurant's food cut them some slack that   decided Szechuan Eggplant Kung Pao Chicken Sweet Sour Pork  food ordering process efficient friendly  promised delivery within 30 minutes true promise doorbell rang 30 minutes dot    The food packaged very neatly tightly bag  included all sauces napkins utensils would need meal well    The food pretty tasty basic Chinese fair  hoping saucier kung pao chicken  chicken tad bit dry more sauce would beneficial chicken quite bit  spicy eggplant good texture  wasn't overly soft good meaty texture enjoy although wish tad spicier well  favorite sweet sour pork  All food pretty solid   I'm definitely interested trying food person especially well priced Peking Duck menu since restaurant  com certificate burning hole pocket type  <EOR>
