Apparently first somebody asked substitution   The chicken fried steak itself middle road compared others had  eggs fried potatoes par but little put off biscuit gravy underneath CFS  ordered iced tea drink  waitress never came back offer refill  layout same other Lodge location whereas dining area surrounded glass looking into bar area    It OK experience but many other places area don't think would special trip back  <EOR> Probably worst experience 2017     came lunch 12 30    didn't food until 1 20   only 4 people dining room    bartender mess no idea customer service    only saving grace food tasted great      seriously need take place off your vista schedule     owner needs redo front staff   driving business away    spent last dollar there     should too     many choices Las Vegas    one      <EOR> We've gone handful times recently Kerry Kahana wonderful always welcoming soon walk in  Tonight steak quesadilla tater tot nachos the aioli delicious! sliders  food good!

No comps anything outside bad steak?  While liked Holly vibe probably would return knowing don't comp players  <EOR> Went shoot pool never offered drink   bar bartender black hat ask  want very ruid  told wine she said but send over waitress  waitress came time   gamble never ask if wanted refill  back seats waited waitress  20 minutes she phone whole time   two bartender well taking pictures only catering men   Very disappointed  Never come back in   bad because bar cute much better  <EOR> I $12 99 TALL CHEESEY BURGER   1Lb Burger meat great tasting big fan 3 Texas Toast bread slices herd fried onions   take couple buddies when visit but just regular bun   11 30AM dead there   Waitress said picks 2 00PM  <EOR> Great place wish more people would catch on  yet anything bad menu  Great atmosphere kozy surroundings seperate family dining area  <EOR> Our Bartender Karey may spelling wrong amazing! first time definitely back! Food great drink prompt great So happy found place! Thank all! <EOR> I wish would read other reviews before going in   may chosen somewhere else   Clearly good customer services priority   food okay but bit overpriced beers cold but service slow   $25 play full tilt didn't warrant single comp   When asked bartender much play receive comp she said $30  Since higher ANY other place town might good information give me    know $25 lot play but never enticed play more   bartender never asked if was wanted member players club never told any promos etc    Also took 10 minutes change because bartender more concerned payout GM drinking bar   unfortunate because place lot potential close home but won't back   am sure stay business since total 10 people bar 9 11 PM Friday night clear welcoming new customers  <EOR> I love here  Food great bartenders fun feel party log cabin!
