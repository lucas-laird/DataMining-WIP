Well go  Taquitos mixto Every them tasted different very inconsistent  I know all different flavors but im saying chicken good hubbys chicken dry crunchy chicken inside all soggy but guess  ordering delivery fried food     sogginess understand but would suggest plating fried food bed lettuce delivery put holes containers condensation doesn't build up   Chicken asada torta Bread hard hubby thought gross took bite thought ok thank putting beans He HATES beans  Shrimp Cocktail Im trying nice but made throw tasted someone put Kool Aid tomato sauce shrimp  Alfredo nachos made mad!!! hubby wanted most didn't say no beans because menu doesn't beans it!!!!! Open there??? BEANS!!!! All over whole freakin thing course he wont eat it! He did manage stick finger spot taste alfredo he said good took bite tasted pretty good but own food didn't want he did! AGAIN all soggy maybe delivery deconstruct containers just put chips box youll better outcome think people would rather assemble themselves although lot idiots would probably need instructions then them soggy   The Tacos Shrimp weird good bad just weird carne asada tasted reheated over cooked very dry hard eat carnitas pretty much same dry hard   Salsa Most white people would think super spicy eat habaneros fun ok spice pretty good flavor  All all ordered 50 bucks worth inedible food threw most sucked cause people nice might try stop sometime give them try maybe give them better review!
