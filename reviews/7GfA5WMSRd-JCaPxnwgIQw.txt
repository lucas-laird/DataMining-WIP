I day fresh tasty combo wonderful next visit combo skimpy taste old dried hard   This closest most convenient location house gets most business sometimes visit OK sometimes sucks ass   The shrimp dishes rip off charge additional $1 however give just few pieces shrimp which mostly vegetables whatever shrimp mixed with  If order shrimp item give some damn shrimp OK!  Get your free sample don't guess wonder if item new ones time time  crazy new surf turf item am glad sampled ordered something else   I really honey walnut shrimp however always made same way sweet less sweet more just plain mayo taste  When order something taste good then come back taste completely different issue me   I much prefer authentic Chinese Cantonese food however trick American style Chinese food    Consistency key don't unfortunately! <EOR> We all know authentic Chinese food  But hey Panda Express around years always liked them because cheap fast food keeps full!    This location isn't bad  many parking stalls outside restaurant clean  However feel sorry employees working here  seems every time stop only employee behind counter deal long line customers no else around help out  But even under all stress try friendly always asking if would sample any entrees    The main problem Panda Express don't know long food sitting don't fresh batch until run something  Sometimes fried rice dry egg rolls crispy some other entrees may lack flavor    Over years become fan Pick Stix  But since don't any locations Vegas Panda now  <EOR>
