Just dinner Daniel Boulud before Le Reve show   Good prix fixe menu $42 three course before 7pm but expecting more michelin star restaurant   started parsnip soup spicy bread good but amazing   main entree steak frites house burger both cooked well but blend taste   couldn't taste truffle burger consider myself truffle hunter!  setting relaxing big window looking lighted pool pond most romantic place take date but  comfortable enough yourself   Service very slow call waiter few times  <EOR> Wow really? People actually give place 4 5 stars? read some reviews say don't think same restaurant people  standards high  But honestly shouldn't standards high restaurant  a Michelin Star restaurant Wynn? completely underwhelmed food service atmosphere say least    My husband live Vegas but decided stay Wynn romantic weekend  chose Daniel Boulud because menu because rating Michelin Star highly regarded Vegas locals read heard perhaps most importantly because Alex booked    I chose prix fixe menu because planning ordering skate anyway  $10 more prix fixe included appetizer dessert  husband chose steak started meal Caesar's salad  also ordered half dozen oysters start off meal  oysters absolutely awful  some worst ever had  When waiter asked if preferred large small oysters responded large  he forgot bring right type oysters he forgot magnifying glass because bad boys only minuscule but completely tasteless  $3 pop deserved better  course three received noteworthy  assumed prix fixe items would spectacular considering chef specifically chooses items menu probably items most often due price  dead wrong  pumpkin soup ok but consistency off  soup actually pool oil separated rested top  Totally unappetizing  skate ok but again nothing write home about  dessert hazelnut fondant coffee ice cream absolutely disgusting  hate blunt but seriously screw dessert? huge sweet tooth Cover anything chocolate usually eat enjoy it  dessert bad took bite left plate  husband's steak ok but didn't hold candle steaks he's other Vegas restaurants Nine Mon Ami Gabi Rosemary's Prime heck even Ruth's Chris   price should taken next door SW Steakhouse  No Michelin Star but everyone talked both restaurants prefer SW over DB  Shoulda woulda coulda right?   Even atmosphere stunk  very few tables available  All unlucky diners fortunate enough receive table piled middle restaurant sardines side table against bench seat other facing away show  Despite fact made reservations 3 weeks advance put special request table view request honored  don't fault restaurant since realize just request guarantee but others hoping romantic meal should definitely aware poor seating situation    Don't eat sorry  especially true yelpers frequent finer restaurants Vegas  promise if good food disappointed  <EOR> $42 star Michelin rated restaurant 3 course meal Daniel Boulud restaurant Wynn   outstanding!

First off burger ginormous   asked bartender most people stuff mouth   He said just press down but scared so   juices patty?!!  anyway managed press down took bite   say heck burger   going compare Five Guys In and Out because different class   fine dining restaurant darn fine burger great stuff   taste all goodness every bite slices tomato frisee parmesan bun all awesome together   served some pommes frites which good nothing world   Also comes side ketchup mayo deli style mustard which must add rather good   Don't dip your burger though want enjoy is   Overall great burger   Would again?  Probably anytime soon but I'd definitely keep mind couple years now   $32 but all foodies recommend it   bar service great can't complain anything  <EOR> In retrospect really regret ordering burger  ask myself why did order John Dory? White fish white fish  going taste whatever cook in  then waiter walked burger  When saw $30 burger menu truffles foie gras crammed into thought gimmick tourists  Now know next time Vegas won't even remember eating because didn't order gimmicky $30 burger  <EOR> Um     Service excellent but expected     gotta say tough bit disappointed food  Textures bit off had salad soup swordfish family style course     dunno     just didn't it  Cannot rave enough though everything else  Staff ambiance     fantastic!!!

next visit sure  <EOR> i don't care plastic veneer casino restaurants but truly matters food  service  both great when went  come daniel boulud he knows he's doing  he's definitely done great job staffing location  no don't work there  <EOR> I've big fan Boulud's restaurants New York particularly Bar Boulud excited try restaurant outposts Vegas  also fan Wynn decor DB Brasserie done same classy way nice view onto waterfall where weird funky shows half hour    For starters ordered half dozen oysters off Share portion menu but order them individual appetizer specify exactly many want  waiter really helpful explaining menu difference between east west coast  oysters I more 'oystery tasting eastern ones   oysters great pleased see follow entree duck confit excellent well  really easy overcook duck duck confit but skin mine super crispy while meat still remained relatively tender    The waiter also overheard  birthday sent complimentary dessert small cookies table which nice  sommelier helpful picking champagne wine cocktails the Bitter Frenchie great   any vegetarians also mushroom risotto which isn't menu along salads  risotto actually really good wouldn't minded having entree even non veggie myself    Vegas full four five star restaurant outposts Craft etc but I'd say DB Brasserie worth try  <EOR> I've few times   located lake level Wynn hotel over the top even Las Vegas standards   seated promptly arrived inside view waterfall   wine list extensive quite few French choices we St  Emilion    entree keeps bringing back artery clogging hamburger $32 September 2009 stuffed fois gras short ribs   must have  <EOR> Inaugurating four night vacation meal Daniel Boulud's Brasserie made good introduction Las Vegas gastronomy  Sure brasserie does sit same mantle Daniel New York but one half price opportunity experience Boulud empire  prix fixe menu moreover runs 5 30 7 offering enough choices satisfy any non vegetarian's appetite    We greeted oyster topped osetra caviar cauliflower cream chives  pate start each accoutrement dijon chanterelle paired well pork liver accentuating its smooth texture    Ordering fish occasion end pyrrhic success great tasting yet woefully inadequate  rejoiced well portioned skate came way  skate burst flavor comparable lobster crab only better when include pan seared skin  dining companions alas forced tolerate overcooked steak    I enjoyed red grape clafouti which provided perfect flavor balance sweet but petite ice cream scoop allowed several worthwhile deviations mild custard  <EOR> As someone fortunate enough experienced share wonderful fine dining restaurant enormous disappointment   wife very high hopes expectations restaurant bearing name such world renowned chef   started wonderfully greeted gracious hostess given great seat view spectacular waterfall scenery   waiter also seemed very point   Everything seemed great but then ordered food   My wife ordered foie gras escargot starters   She huge foie gras fan but fell flat   cold presentation ok but lacked beautiful creaminess desire foie gras   escargot started phenomenal   easily best dish evening   Nice presentation great flavors   However even dish flawed bottom dish salty really enjoy   The entrees   Good grief   waiter convinced new lamb dish which just added menu day before arrived bursting North African flavors   Wrong   again OK   reasonably well cooked but completely lacking any type wow factor   wouldn't quite categorize bland but definitely lacking punch expected   My wife ordered beef tenderloin med rare   first came horrendously overcooked between med well well done   sent back   second came pretty close med well again   When paying top dollar type experience would expect Wynn's signature restaurants pathetic unacceptable   leave Le Reve incredible show! wife just deal it   Obviously experience expecting   I believe restaurant would employ such utterly inexperienced line cooks Saturday night   Needless say return establishment  <EOR> Grabbed early dinner before taking off airport   Getting reservation day of wasn't problem 6pm dinner    though year ago   ordered duck yummy   Everyone else really liked orders well   am big fan DB Bistro Moderne NY expected good meal when walked door    Daniel Boulud Brasserie did disappoint  <EOR> Food excellent   Good place special occasion   also weekday pre fixe

manhattan    i db burger which quite experience but likely try again  aged beef kind tough overcooked fois gras middle bit flavorless  new york truffles which think supposed but couldn't find them

Nice looking restaurant nice few waterfall quot show quot The 3 course still $48  app main dessert   i pate steak frittes forget dessert name basically foo foo kit kat   roomie corn soup lobster skate  sorbet    posted pics items   i guess vegas foodie comparisons between DB Bouchon   give slight nod Bouchon but just slight nod   The pate rustic flavorful little cutesy presentation but no biggie   corn soup sure if agree served cold crab puffs served tasty   the skate decent big flavor   steak perfectly cooked great taste didn't care pile greens served it   frittes decent bouchon's definitely them the desserts also good   roomie's burnt carmel sorbet feeling gelato little burnt taste   I'm undecided whether $48 person tab value   Given location food quality yeah worth it   definitely back try burger ! <EOR> this paper mâché Disney facsimile brasserie   If you've ever restaurant serves mussels pommes frites no reason here   never such disappointing experience any Daniel restaurants New York   As far food basic Brooklyn Boston brasserie fare just amazingly expensive  wine prices disgusting bottles $25 wine stores Boston NYC over $100 bottle here    The staff amazing   Wonderful service great team  Unfortunately working shadow restaurant   There many wonderful restaurants Las Vegas days no reason Daniel unless want waste LOT someone else's money   Then could fun  <EOR> Ambience 4 stars Food 4 stars Service 4 stars Presentation 3 stars  The scoop I ordered caviar foie gras duck confit  say all dishes quite exquisite  skip review caviar there's really no special preparation it although say nice set condiments sides including blinis toasted bread triangles crumbled hard boiled eggs separated into yolk whites onions course creme fraiche   The duck foie gras excellent quality would expect such delicacy  Cutting into cutting through air pieces just melt your mouth  Most French restaurants smother foie gras flavor but nice dish sauce minimal most flavor meat  Eating akin biting into juicier more tender steak   The duck confit most tender duck life  never use knife  foie gras barely swiped duck fork pieces came apart without hesitation  seasoning perfect complex flavor yet did overpower flavor meat   I can't say much presentation food  decent dishes didn't look sloppy but wasn't anything special gave sense food fine dining  Presentation really factor overall score though really just icing cake me   The ambience top notch but really depends looking for  Some might disagree but wouldn't say restaurant very romantic  primarily because room loud  If want more intimate atmosphere wouldn't recommend place  But if noise isn't concern everything else very nice  would say place itself little bit above your standard candle lit restaurant but place feel grandeur color changing waterfall outside  moment looks scene Avatar another moment you're taken cherry blossom fields Japan  alone place extra star above average ambience    Don't much say service  didn't wait long menu order check waiter came periodically check water  <EOR> My fiance dinner July 4 weekend  heard many good things restaurant but say bit disappointed  Of course food service bad all but compare all those Michelin restaurants not     let's say meeting standards   Money really issue    and expensive but feel worth afterward     <EOR> Sitting terrace restaurant great except crazy light show Wynn place   DB Burger definitely interesting once but probably never order again didn't really taste short ribs foie overcooked definitely didn't taste truffles   fries really good though   pork chop though super yummy   BF said bed lentils bit salty but still pork chop dish yummy   Beet salad good pate bad also   hazelnut parfait dessert okay only   Overall bad meal but nothing spectacular   probably more 3 5 stars  <EOR> For $58 all inclusive tax tip included excluding beverages 3 course pre fixe meal I'd say Daniel Boulud definitely solid bet 15+ girls celebrating bachelorette weekend Las Vegas  service impeccable throughout entire meal    until server forgot dessert wait another 15 minutes it  But really overlook dessert mishap given fact meal delicious  warm pear clafoutis definitely worth wait    An overall great dining experience    although might note while lakeside show entertaining though times bit weird eerie  having off every 15 20 minutes quite distracting interruptive  <EOR> I give 3 5 stars because restaurant better A OK but experience didn't meet four stars here's why     We gf three course early bird dinner   early bird menu said foie gras terrine but seemed duck pate which also regular menu    Perhaps don't know food well enough but seemed pate foie gras   course wasn't delicious tried finished   both steak which well cooked   problem gave steak medium rare gave steak medium    Dessert quite ordinary thai ice tea ice cream if remember correctly chocolate dessert which heavy taste   shouldn't ordered 3 course meal should burger DB burger     The service restaurant so   Perhaps because ordered early bird dinner only ordered cocktail   felt rushed didn't feel waiter wanted wait just wanted through motions next table could come in   Next time try regular dinner menu early bird dinner  <EOR> Very solid though bit overpriced   expense report didn't cry but perks place   wine list good happy see favorite inexpensive wines Cosentino's Cigar Zin yum! list   food above average but service excellent never empty glass   desserts decadent definitely best part meal  I'd back own dollar dessert don't much sweet tooth   Also BEST view water light show Wynn  several banquette tables faced over water watched 2 runs light show   Thoroughly entertaining nice know special view while good bistro meal  <EOR> Ah yes DB Wynn  When check menu food pricey but sounds quite yummy  bf comped dinner although free sure sucks know restaurant eat free gambling losing few grand  decided try petit seafood platter $35 which ok  lobster far best piece seafood platter  firm fresh without fishy taste  main entree chose split signature DB burger stuffed short ribs foie gras black truffle bun $38  hmm   the taste different but good  food overall very disappointing  only good thing DB entertainment  If sit outside window enjoy waterfall view show every half hour featuring singing frog  bf also able partake magic show nearby table whom assume some vip guests  magic tricks awesome waterfall show romantic  Overall worth eating just enjoy view b c good food way more important memorable 2 minute show  definitely giving Daniel Boulud 2nd chance  <EOR> I extremely disappointed restaurant only food but also service   First all waited least hour before food came kitchen   absolutely unacceptable restaurant renowned DB   Secondly food unbelievably mediocre   don't remember name dish ordered but remember fish dish fish dry broth sauce salty mention portion ridiculously tiny     Even though impressed food enjoyed bread lot especially fig bread     I expected more restaurant place definitely failed live its reputation  <EOR> I agree Jen C light show place restaurant maybe Wynn itself  Seems more fitting Universal Studios Wynn's first rate persona   Getting back Boulud very good dinner here  Would nice if enforced dress code alittle but non the less enjoyable   My wife started 6 oysters 3 3 East West Steak Tartare  Both very good   Our entrees Duck Conti nice crispy skin moist inside Pan Seared Tuna Steak  Again very good   Service also very good professional   The 4 because though meal very good didn't WOW annoying to us light show  Just glad weren't seated patio  <EOR> This Las Vegas Fine Dining all about   best part semi affordable if your research   awesome Taste Wynn Prix Fix $49 person three courses no matter order minimum getting free dessert case ordering Steak Frites original $43 basically first third course free    being Michelin star restaurant UNHEARD of   catch?  between 5 7 everyone knows little hard stick schedule when Vegas   since staying lighter earlier now may miss Frog show everyone talks about   Though didn't see show waterfall lights background still provided beautiful backdrop dinner     I've handful Michelin star places dining Las Vegas since parents dragging little girl place could favorites   food perfect mix unique creativity while still having comforting recognizable flavors   dont just slather sauce everything call French   actually use quality ingredients leave surprises throughout dishes    even Prix Fix HUGE portions point where carnivore considering leaving some left plate     On dishes   started off ordering broccoli soup Duck Terrine first course   soup honestly best soup EVER broccoli soup steroids creamy silky bits fresh veggies some kind pepper topped huge French bread croutons melted cheese them   French onion soup concept broccoli soup   GOOD   duck terrine very tasty well its fatty thick slice cold cut came red onion marmalade thick mustard spread variety cute little pickled veggies   some thick bread cut down all fat salt duck good combination   really hard finish esp first course complain getting much food but really dish must share else might full main course   second course Sonoma chicken steak frites   chicken literally half bird skin topped delicious crumble topping thick sauce potatoes other veggie goodies    steak frites good huge portion again frites piping hot all uniform shaped no dinky overfried pieces served garlicky aioli sauce   almost seemed tossed fries light amt vinegar LOVE kind flavoring    thing bit upset ordered steak medium came medium well   If wasn't still juicy tasty would more upset   Now onto desert ordered apple tartin chocolate hazelnut fondant   Usually don't expect much dessert restaurants since don't specialize it   But guess should known better since French place thy GOOD detailed   example apple tartin display 5 different ways eat apple apple poached apple chips dried apple apple jelly apple sauce   chocolate thick delicious coffee ice cream surprise chocolate piece under ice cream   chef sent petite fours true classy French style    As service waiters servers very informative patient pleasant   weren't snobby overbearing checked just enough times feel comfortable but many times bothersome   brought dishes quickly timely also tended every request particularly turning heating lamp   only DISLIKE place snobby hostess    no smile no welcome only downward look beady little eyes   She ushered sight barely listening seating preference   She barely squeezed thank walked only did bc looked RIGHT eye   No hostess right condensing customers   may look young but most likely older then would come restaurant if couldn't pay food   all she knew could saving month saving DB special occasion just hit jackpot splurging    No matter don't treat customers that  don't care if 5 ' 10'' perfect body still hostess your job   In summary Vegas dining experiance   Over top beautiful borderline tacky atmosphere BIG portions detailed delicious food free things thrown big side snob  <EOR> I'm going two stars  Sorry Dan   Had meal ended appetizers and before Water Show might inclined give five   As stands though waiter upsold entrees  didn't need telling apps won't enough  sure sort behemoths he thought but clearly he thought without food weeks   Then show started  Wow  hideous  <EOR> The prix fixe deal star Michelin restaurant  $49 each tried pumpkin soup melting marshmellows pate forestierre unctuous short rib truffle burger coq au vin desert tart chocolate   Impeccable service   wall waterfall display mesmerizing though bit Asian woman's face projected tendrils vines weird weird  Apparently window seat show seated 5 30 pm  <EOR> If anyone asks favorite restaurant is  it   best meals life here   Literally everything world   But taking cake Duo Deux whatever name i can't remember its while still dreams dish basically its petite filet braised short rib   filet awesome expected but short rib steals show only dish but anything ever tasted   Resist urge order burger because sounds amazing unique but short ribs      O mannnnnn  I

Hours check least restaurants   first time came DB Burger which best burgers had   enjoyed burger though can't say whether fois gras black truffle added much burger     The second time came prix fixe dinner pate course chicken course berry dessert   enjoyed every dish everything cooked perfectly     Overall would say pay DB   great restaurant especially if sick buffets strip   little bit more money great dining experience Daniel's  <EOR> My first visit Wynn!

burger $32 ordered prix fixe menu pumpkin soup steak frites ice creams $48   Pumpkin soup reminded Trader Joe's Pumpkin soup box  am sure fresh but wasn't great flavor  Maybe adding ginger doing something more Michelin ratish would help  Steak Frites steak sirloin cut  wasn't bad but wasn't memorable  french fries ok nothing compared McD's  Ice creams favorite  coffee pistachio flavors fresh flavorful creamy  Fantastic   Service superb meals prompt efficient staff friendly down to earth  stuffy place all family appreciated that    Next time book prestigious restaurant Alex   But impressed here  <EOR> We ate DB Brasserie part Restaurant Week  Even though showed ten minutes before reservations happy seat us  proceeded show table patio  2 top high traffic area asked them if more intimate table available  said wasn't problem showed new table tucked away far left corner patio  Unfortunately right next server station where piled dirty dishes but figured still better table first  still gave decent view lake  seemed server large number tables deal service little spotty but he trying best  sommelier quick stop table ask drinks  champagne wines glass little pricey around $12 glass but seems norm higher end restaurants  Everything drank great  champagne albariño wife malbec meritage me   As food ranged average fabulous forgettable  Appetizers Summer Salad really good light refreshing Short rib ravioli best dish night  Tons flavor combination meat tomato compote  wish two orders because didn't last long   Main Entrees Moules frites wonderful clean flavors but way many mussels which something never thought I'd complain upscale restaurant  much good thing   Really nice presentation deep cast iron dish  also gave two bowls mussel shells if gives any indication many were  very quick take bowls filled up  Steak frites good sized cut beef cooked perfectly  little lacking flavor when eaten itself but sweetness onion compote very good dish  fries surprisingly good  thought might little dense but weren't all  outside fries perfectly light crispy while inside tasted soft fluffy   Desserts Crepe Suzette light dessert w decent flavor texture but nothing special Chocolate hazelnut fondant ok  Nothing spectacular  looked better tasted  coffee ice cream accompanied best thing dessert  Petit fours mostly forgettable but coconut macaroon favorite group  Overall meal good but didn't live expectations thought Daniel Boulud restaurant would like  expecting blown away every dish but found them hit miss  I'd give them 3 5 stars if could  side note wish restaurants Wynn Encore used OpenTable  much more convenient reservation online opposed calling having person other line try convince stay night suites buy tickets Le Reve  <EOR> My boyfriend took celebrate anniversary best restaurant entire Vegas trip  second star Michelin rated restaurant think other which also star good planner Food 4 5 Food presentation 5 Service 5 Decor 4 5  First all place beautiful especially if sit outside  There's great view biggest waterfall pond if eat during dinnertime you'll even see occasional water light performances which kinda thought lame but maybe you'll it  especially nice sit outside since slightly warm breeze which really 65 degree AC blowing inside  Note** Some better seating reserved since sort tree blocking view waterfall  Nevertheless still really nice     This definitely more pricey restaurant but portions lot bigger expected  huge but definitely tiny lot other restaurants  Wynn Taste Wynn option where fixed menu choices which think great  both ordered fixed 3 course meal which honestly considering michelin rated restaurant thought deal only $42 frissee salad country pate appetizers salmon steak frities entrees chocolate hazelnut fondant icecream sorbert dessert  frissee salad country paté YUMMY! salad comes warm just really love paté  salmon entree delicious steak cooked really well  desserts great! gave complimentary desserts which really just looked bits cereal decorated dessert Happy Anniversary! cute  hazelnut fondant GOOOD  really liked icecream  sorbert really good too  If dessert good chocolate fruit  Oh yeah presentation everything just really pretty   Lastly service great  Everyone just your waiter very attentive but don't overly it  They're really friendly cater you   Also if you're staying Wynn Encore just charge bill your room    Yay place! <EOR> I wanted wait few days let brain come review fair Daniel Boulud    I pretty disappointed here's why 1  restaurant does thing where even if reservations wait 20 minutes bar spend even more money drinks  really annoying noticed all other couples getting same treatment  said did really good drink pleased  still no excuse keep starving people gettin fed   2  seated pretty darn good spot  facing Lake Dreams saw great laser music show every half hour  Couldn't asked better seat without having grease maitre'd    3  Apps ask bread which clearly given every party soon being seated  more server later  Seafood Platter great value  shared small size which easily large enough 3 people  came 6 raw oysters 2 clams 2 mussels 2 giant prawns half lobster tail 2 different tartares  surprised generosity Vegas restaurant only $36!!! might highlight evening  I another app which pretty average  expected blown away every dish here  point meal where starts slipping   4  Entrees blame myself getting DB Burger but does mean entree gf's entree should so so  when paying price paid   5  Service Bad  waiter would terrible waiter if he worked Applebee's  sure he even job  water point where dangerously low asked more  does happen place caliber? Water should refilled soon take sip  wine list taken away table without anyone asking if still needed it  Don't want order ridiculously overpriced glasses wine? sure willing to  Hey waiter    when ask check because hurry meet people don't continue clean table  Stop you're doing check worry table later  teach Applebee's  all ticky tack complaints but compound inattentiveness throughout meal expectation price paying service receives 0 stars    I'm sure another night another set dishes another waiter would yielded better resule but Daniel Boulud deserved 2 Yelp stars  <EOR> $32 hamburger! in?   So did it  tried infamous $32 dollar burger  definitely tasty super high quality meat but $32 still stretch  impressed more awesome seafood tower  crab oysters amazing  Some best had    The restaurant two levels  Ask closer window upper level made feel bit disconnected  bar also great  Perfect some champagne oysters  <EOR> A beautiful restaurant amazing food beautiful free show!   I filet perfectly cooked medium rare course  just melted mouth  black truffle fries came divine  girlfriend couple friends seated patio front row seat waterfall show Wynn Las Vegas  wonderful experience  Everyone enjoyed food friend said burger best he ever had  kobe beef burger stuffed black truffles foie gras    The wait staff point  only complain hostess seemed little snooty when asked table patio  reservations showed 30 minutes early figured could accommodate little problem  did perfect patio table but without little bitching hostess  All well won    Anyway top notch meal  else expect Michelin star restaurant  Definitely would return if wasn't many great places try Vegas  <EOR> the french bread good  butter accompanies it  think favorite part meal although did also enjoy heirloom tomato salad db burger  speaking burger shared few other people don't think foie gras short rib portion but only imagine OTT over top combination must be  tried friend's short rib steak both tender delicious  duck confit fairly good but little salty  overall think DB bit overpriced side but don't regret dining there  especially since afterward manager walked past line tryst right into club  SCORE! <EOR> I tried restaurant very long time ago sure food now but when 2005 food wasn't expected Daniel Boulud restaurant  Living NYC he's demi god when comes food but he obviously wasn't kitchen I checked food wasn't all memorable   We ordered few more French dishes crispy duck believe chicken  Again expected bit more but then again expectations always high Daniel restaurant  Next time check prix fixe special well famed burger might just NY for  <EOR> A really fun place dine  Foie Gras burger decadent carpaccio amazing short ribs NUTS  already crush short ribs general but short ribs probably best life  WOW <EOR> Please left hed down winding escalator under beautiful parasoles find entrance Danial Boulud Brasserie    We reservations 7 girls nice dinner bride bridesmaids kicked off amazing weekend  did right Boulud!   The atmosphere inside seemed bit dark but classy  seated outside waterfall which amazing  great cocktails watermelon mojito flirtini great classic martinis great presentation    Many items ordered few highlights were The lobster salad bit busy plate but great citrus flavor lots elements keep wanting more    John Dory white fish delicious buckwheat cake  Steak sure which she but she said very good    2 orders pasta clams delicious    Moule Frite Great sauce! Finally place well  only complaint french fries terrible  Soggy tasted Freezer bag  definately needs redone  Fresh potatos cut them thinner crispy please    2 orders Jadori Chicken Very moist tasty    It really helped table sent over $500 bottle Rose Champagne which fantastic    We also tried Chocolate cake souffle mint rasberry tart  All very good    Our table enjoyed little shows going throughout night  loved flowers  Some bit weird but its Vegas its ok    The price meal $80 per person including tip    I would definately recommend Boulud groups well couples  <EOR> We dinner Daniel Boulud Brasserie Saturday evening    arrived early seating 7 PM promptly seated wonderful table patio could admire water show starting 8 30 PM    While originally hoped meat dish lamb veered course instead seafood dinner starting lobster bisque following moules frites generous portion mussels side wonderfully prepared french fries    Overall thought meal good great    service however absolutely stellar   My lobster bisque wasn't quite expected    presentation perfect generous pieces lobster bathing watery broth    Yes read right     While menu described bisque found soup much watery sophisticated palate   course left longing creamy silky texture which simply did find    lobster bit rubbery taste   wife tasted agreed she'd better lobster     did privilege tasting torchon de foie gras which very good although served slightly cold    very good solid but didn't quite meet expectations had    Let's just say if know Foie Bouchon Yountville then you've tasted better Foie Gras   Once again thought presentation service perfect   plenty attention waiter water wine glasses refilled promptly    All all service 5 stars    mussels fries though closer 3 stars    Again easy critique them having just same dish week early Bistro Jeanty Yountville   Chef Jeanty trumps Daniel Boulud    When menu description evoked dish mussels served thick aromatic broth found dish instead served plenty greens top but very little creamy goodness      Perhaps merely Boulud's attempt serve clean healthy food discriminating Wynn crowd    Still hoping French Chef's Brasserie would indeed thrown heavier more cholesterol laden creamy goodness way   Would come back?  Most certainly   food very good newly adjusted expectations would disappointed next time    Still place no match Picasso Bellagio    two worlds apart  <EOR> Came dinner thing mind famous DB Burger! $32 9oz beef patty stuffed foie gras braised shortribs http www yelp com biz_photos qmh6zxtJ8C8 YiUPv7ySlw?userid=F_5_UNX wrAFCXuAkBZRDw reading rave reviews Yelp try it   Didn't even bother looking rest menu though pretty sure everything else really good   yeah laugh paid $32 burger   ashamed good!!  Burger fries glass Muscata    the perfect dinner!  restaurant itself really nice inside   love open close view huge waterfall show outside Wynn   shows trippy though but helped enhanced ambiance place   also very good waiter   liked he guaranteed muscato would very delicious else he'd drink himself if didn't it   apologize because liked it   Nice overall dining experience would definitely come again try other entrees  <EOR> An easy decision great dining experience   group nine blast   Towers seafood fresh tasty    Caesar salad best find!   Most importantly two words short ribs   Melts your mouth cooked perfectly amazing    terrific meal  <EOR> I highly recommend place if you're looking high class establishment    situated inside Wynn which totally beautiful amazing high end shops   Although thought place bit overrated very empty probably because high table minimums still loved restaraunt   table 4 8 pm seated right away   service prompt friendly tons recommendations   best part cheese cart me   moules frites which little above par but nothing I'd write home about   menu stacked many options hard time choosing one!   There's cute little show going outside while dine changes every 30 minutes  <EOR> Beautiful romantic location  food expected perfectly cooked I halibut hubby braised short ribs very well seasoned balanced  dessert raspberry pistachio Bavarois tart nice well  But say really made Boulud's Brasserie aside fact chefs kitchen really know cook service  good wine recommendations even GM came ask everything was  also time Spamalot   What didn't unfortunately weirdo water show  all about? <EOR> The last time  trippy vegas show complete waterfalls lighting theatrics giant frog singing Louis Armstrong's Wonderful World  Hmm   Okay   seems crowd pleaser though     But  Vegas right?  What's Vegas without interesting entertainment?  say Give people want! Anyway here's run down   pre fixe menu equals affordability   service great   However food memorable which disappointing   sister's birthday she chose place   and well guess important thing she liked it   at least think she did     Oh well still pleasant watch giant green frog lip synching Yes think myself wonderful world Oh yeah  <EOR> What could better eating star Michelin restaurant? Eating another star Michelin restaurants span two days course! love fine dining restaurants Vegas ask if show catch dinner  particular day actually did great timing dinner wouldn't late Kà all way other side Strip MGM Grand  early reservation could catch three course prix fixe menu before 7 00 pm    We seated great view waterfall overlooking Lake Dreams  decided order using same strategy employed previous night Michael Mina  Two ordered prix fixe third ordered la carte because could never finish dessert anyway  started off pair oyster shooters since Michael N  never tried oysters life  came fresh clean expected needing only little bit lemon juice dab cocktail sauce    My three course meal started off duck terrine  don't think type foie gras before all pan seared turned into pâté  reminded more meatloaf but soft  made spreadable toast  more thick cold cut itself lacked bold flavor but pickled vegetables along chutney jam really brought everything together  addition sampled Michael N 's country pâté which tasted eerily similar terrine  also tried Jessica L 's onion soup which quite cheesy in good way masterfully flavorful    For main course Sonoma chicken which prepared sous vide  am big fan style cooking because thick cuts meat easily dried chicken breast cooked evenly  drawback used pale color which look still raw undercooked  chicken cooked perfectly if overcooked texture very rubbery liked simple vegetable ingredients  steamed mussels also done very simply h ad great tasting broth  also very generous large amount mussels  crispy duck confit also perfectly executed well lentils    By time dessert rolled around companions already full two desserts between people worked great again  chose chocolate hazelnut fondant Jessica L  pastry tasted very similar lemon bar served Thai basil ice cream  Don't let flavor ice cream scare you  delicious actually liked lemon bar dessert more fondant  also fan lemon bars quite some time nice fancy version favorite baked goods  fondant good but didn't really enough coffee flavor ice cream might due richness hazelnut chocolate    Overall meal another satisfying but liked main course lot more previous night's rack lamb  also thought dessert better Michael Mina's  service waitress attentive but didn't seem knowledgeable other waiter  But never ask water refilled either  would nice receive amuse bouche especially since first people seated dinner almost empty dining room but enjoyed dining experience food ambiance  <EOR> I only call wait staff name when they're exceptional   With said Dominic review you   I'm going start review writing service mainly because think waiter Dominic best wait staff ever pleasure meeting restaurant  alone gives Daniel Boulud two stars  food ambiance add star piece but touch those later they're really no real importance    It's hard finding good service high class restaurants  need someone enthusiastic but fake just enough charm night run smoothly  Dominic only all but he insightful knowledgeable enough he able recommend fantastic bottle wine boy I   Grade service long way someone usually stickler service   As food boy started off lobster bisque steak tartare  bisque very light well seasoned little bits bacon which added nice smokiness dish  boy really enjoyed steak tartare since he's never tried before loved since love raw meat   For entrees of course ordered signature Daniel Boulud burger specials day which soft shell crab over three types tomatoes one which fried green tomato   I don't remember other two   personally thought burger funny texture probably due short ribs stuffed inside couldn't taste foie gras all which highly disappointing love foie gras   soft shell crab nice presentation but flavor wise again nothing really amazing   All all experience though guess  counts  Come overall experience service let food just compliment that   **SEE PICTURES POSTED** <EOR> The DB Burger exceeded expectations last night craving today burger wonderful could unfortunately finish it  boyfriend able but he completely stuffed end  swear Wynn Encore best fries ever  am love room service french fries order fries anytime stay but say Daniel Boulud Brasserie could possibly best fries ever had  interior restaurant understated sure due being next waterfall show  note bathroom restaurant pretty fabulous   Unfortunately service hugely disappointing  Waiter #1 took order Waiter #2 brought food  ate food sat 15 minutes waiting someone stop by  Finally Waiter #3 packed food asked if wanted dessert which turned down home  asked check  15 minutes asked Waiter #4 check us  Waiter #3 came back another 5 more minutes gave check then 10 minute wait Waiter #5 took check gave change   The service extremely unorganized hope just fluke especially since Michelin star rated restaurant  guess see when come back another burger try other items menu <EOR> Heard many great things Boulud but place par  service good great food average  worth money  Presentation considered much more food  best course cheese palette ice creams  <EOR> For service would give 4 stars but food disappointing lowered star rating     ****  ambience love outdoor seating area Wynn's hourly                                              live entertainment front waterfall  ****  service seated promptly surprised   made                                       reservation   waiter attentive knowledged timely took care unsatisfying experience                                      orders   ****  Fig Bread never bread figs baked very tasty   ****  Caesar Salad romaine crisp fresh over dressed even croutons very tasty portion generous  **  Moules Frites steamed mussels impressed flavor       light could taste natural sweetness mussels nor the      ingredients sauce  *  Bass don't remember full name entree ordered        excited it   sea bass gnocchi rock shrimps sounded      yummy   most disappointing one   bass served     skin on which normally doesn't bother if flavored pan fried but neither   think because skin light flavor entire order tasted fishy    couldn't taste anything else fishy taste   Gnocchi rock shrimps all ok   bass tender     but flavorless   ***  Albarino good   ***  NY DB Burger very interesting concept someone         normally doesn't appreciate burgers tasty   However        don't think gourmet ingredients burger complimented         each other   tasted big meting pot mouth     **  Fries mediocre nothing review about  * Spinach Puree mushy but guess  why called puree to    overcooked spinach enough flavor  My friends wanted take dinner because experience Daniel Boulud 3 years ago   very pleased experience   time disappointed too    suspected chef changed right   There's different chef Daniel Boulud Wynn since 2 years ago  <EOR> i dinner group 15 girls during bachelorette weekend   all ordered prix fixe menu also bottle wine   server fabulous very funny attentive us   despite amount people food arrived timely fashion   foie gras good but bit salty   filet mignon tender salmon   others ordered mussels which smelled heavenly  the patio seating another plus treated few shows throughout dinner   all all great dining experience! <EOR> Came best girl friend foodie really enjoyed experience here  $49 3 course prix fixe menu  only offered before 6 30pm but definitely great deal    +FRENCH ONION SOUP omg good!! definitely best french onion soups ever had   the cheese melted well soup just perfect!! mouth water just thinking it! +SALMON waiter suggested definitely good choice  salmon seasoned very well cooked nearly perfection  +CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT CAKE very delicious although would say 3 dishes probably least impressive one  still very yummy great choice dessert   I really liked ambiance restaurant  sat inside but very close patio area overlooking gorgeous Wynn waterfall  service also very good  waiters very friendly helpful  Also want mention give 3 different types bread   which liked since variety = Sadly going close soon open seafood restaurant especially glad try before away  <EOR> This weekend Vegas friends came dinner based very high recommendation  great

girl    Earlier day friend discussing term brasserie where comfort food should [ideally] done well  figured what's more comforting roasted chicken? Mr  Boulud passed test flying colors palate very pleased simply prepared chicken breast perfectly savory succulent atop creamy potatoes  also taste delicately buttery Loop de Mer another option prefixed menu  Another great dish pork trio roasted pork ribs sausage though regular menu    For appetizer liver pate  Being Vietnamese love pate especially VC sandwiches perfect me  Served really cute pickled sides soft wheat toast see pictures devoured 5 minutes flat  Unfortunately almost made full eat yummy entree  Heheh almost  dessert peach clafoutis would much better if didn't top ginger ice cream   I hate anything ginger  However milk chocolate parfait deliciously rich chocolatey    To top off caught Wynn's light show  Strange but somewhat entertaining  Then again probably more fancy shmancy crowd  <EOR> I didn't know restaurant earned michelin star review it   table right next water basically having high roller friend gets VIP access your experience better    The service decent but wouldn't give excellent   We seafood platter which good   steak OK nothing remarkable   just feel everything pretty average here   Michelin star restaurant should've done better   Steak   pretty average  find better steaks neighborhood joint    Other view   I dont' know keeping coming back  <EOR> Everything perfect cocktails fromage plate  Oh wish fromage plates right now!! die hard cheese lover thought died gone to    cheese heaven   I ordered creamed asparagus soup because knew why there    cheese  Frommage plate We Tour de France really no room left over entree  date bought some sort prime rib dish fabulous melt your mouth  would again even though still many places Vegas explore probably just fromage plate  <EOR> I past April  Daniel Boulud Brasserie definitely deserves its Michelin star    Flat bread great  Salad great  Chicken mussels chickpea fries all three deserts ordered cheese everything excellent  chicken particular extremely moist    Coming made want try Chef Daniel's restaurants New York  <EOR> I such high expectations restaurant   watched all Hours Daniel grew NJ NY area etc   only negative previous night gone Picasso    which knew would set bar high DB Brasserie   Other very odd waterfall show Wynn every half hour decor environment restaurant nice   All tables inside close window you're guaranteed nice view   food though left lot desired   started pumpkin soup which alright but memorable   biggest disappointment entree DB Burger   DB burger three signature dishes Daniel such high expectations   burger juicy but little overdone couldn't taste truffles accompanying fries lukewarm   pear clafoutis nice end meal arguably best dish meal   service okay but suffered having primary point contact   waiter but some point during dinner least 5 people serving talking me   wouldn't back DB Brasserie think money better elsewhere  <EOR> This restaurant fantastic exceeded expectations completely!
