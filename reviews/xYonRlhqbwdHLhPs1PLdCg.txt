Surprisingly  food delicious   I ordered vegetable samosas which beautifully spiced seemed freshly made Palak Paneer also very good lots fried paneer making very hearty dinner    The prices reasonable portions large  certainly come back sample more menu   Why five stars? Although restaurant seemed clean cared for environment neutral point being bland  Certainly every Indian place needs fancy tapestries images Hindu dieties  Modern more Western decor fine   But only things even suggested India window facade cutouts TV screen silently playing dance numbers Bollywood movies  Personally I'd prefer bit more 'character'  dining experience more food  <EOR> This place 5 star price quality food combo   food really good lunch buffet price great   lots really good veggie options staff friendly attentive   naan only OK but still solid choice Indian food around here  <EOR> I've craving Indian buffet found place close home  many veg dishes three chicken dishes two rice dishes goat meat  flavors all great every dish tried  Overall enjoyed food service great  thought price $9 99 but when sign price $13 99  told weekday price $9 99 weekends good know  <EOR> Samosas palak paneer basmati rice garlic naan gourmet cupcakes  Wait what?!

The food      I never indian buffet did serve samosas  disappointing  chutney available wilted salad but other small amount salad ice no appetizers  plain white rice did taste normal basmati    probably plain uncle ben type rice  vegetarian options chana masala which fair  only discerning flavor pepper  hot but no flavor cumin cardimun curry tumeric    just hot I'd give 4  potato curry dish ok   again nothing special  All could taste black pepper  paneer vegetable dish no vegetables except mushrooms of which never eaten mushrooms indian food before   Usually dish made cauliflower potatoes sauce ok but no vegetables  dish right put buffet  seemed trying save money just serving sauce! dal ok  say nan good we requested plain instead garlic   food buffet mostly empty particularly hot  Most indian buffets serve kheer rice pudding disappointing kheer  bread pudding pretty much absolute grossest thing ever tasted  bad spit into napkin  Same thing desert balls gulab jamun     horrible!  We never return restaurant  Everything lunch experience made very disappointing experience  <EOR> Finally proper Indian place  chicken biryani mid lvl spice meant people India  If accustomed eating indian food please ask low spice  place legit!

Dinner menu more elaborate definitely recommend giving place try dinner   Perhaps only little improvement would request mark dishes better far vegan vs vegetarian vs non vegetarian  But pretty responsive when just ask them   Great place can't wait keep coming back! <EOR> Would nice if posted correct business hours yelp    came all way down just realize they're closed 3 5  I came because said open now which wasn't  <EOR> First time food excellent varied buffet style lunch  Can't wait try them dinner  Chef owner William very attentive  would definitely  recommend place! <EOR> The lunch Buffet amazing dining experience best Indian cuisine ever tasted  food tantalizing exploding flavor! ambience beautiful service great  must place  Check only open 2 weeks  <EOR> Met owner asked surprise us   Chicken Korma  Chicken Chilly   Best surprise ever  <EOR> This new Indian restaurant only four miles home   increase people India living Las Vegas number new Indian restaurants opened near neighborhood don't university area enjoy Indian cuisine   came today lunch buffet   $9 99 good deal   I seated promptly mostly empty restaurant brought water mango lassi ordered   then first choices   silverware area where pick your plate took back table then look food     A cursory look showed most dishes vegetarian  chose first plate   Outstanding things first plate chana masala palak paneer dal tadka  chana masala palak paneer nice spiciness them am big fan dal almost all forms   end buffet naan   disappointed because somewhat rubbery sitting warming tray first piece no butter taste all   addition end particular piece thick slice pizza   made impossible rip off piece grab some dal   Instead use fork   For second plate some goat biryani chicken korma onion fritters   goat so   Nothing I'd again   chicken korma good flavor but again trying piece naan wrap around chicken pieces next impossible   onion fritters more dipped onion rings thick bread batter rather normally thinks when see word fritter   For dessert tried two things  bread pudding rice flour halvah   both interesting something new   bread pudding more moist soft normally thinks bread pudding   better two halvah which quite good different anything before   did look gulab jamun but none   didn't want cupcake ended lunch sweet note   The deal breaker naan   no lunch buffet area where naan left cut heating pan keep warm   Naan should fresh brought when ready   buffet consisted mainly vegetarian dishes which OK   3 meat dishes  chicken korma goat biryani tandoori chicken     I try place evening meal but elsewhere lunch buffet   NOTE communication chef owner Paradise India evening explaining some staff didn't show work today why he put naan buffet   never way doing things he host cook today   explains lot gives faith next visit more enjoyable! <EOR> Wow really good buffet amazing  wish Somosa but  ok  waiter very nice greeted smile very top keeping water filled  place 1 2 miles house buffet lunch only 13 99  sure back  <EOR> Not quite substitute normal Indian food haunt     I found Paradise India really just OK   normally Indian buffet literally same street Sahara but few miles away   thought Paradise India would good change case tired other one   But   I don't know that   Wifey lunch date Friday decided visit Paradise India   Upon entering surprised place wasn't busy other Indian buffet to   maybe only 4 5 tables taken   Place quiet!  Where TV?  Where Bollywood music dancing?  could hear pin drop   Took few minutes seated because no front near entrance   once did seated no silverware near plates wait basket refilled   At usual Indian buffet frequent every time enter always smells spices bread something wafting air   mistake Paradise India none that?  Indian curries stews don't most them take ton time make?  Hmmm   made wonder any stuff buffet line actually made FRESH today??  no expert Indian food but something just   OFF   I suspect freshness meter somewhat correct   Almost everything tasted FLAT no burst flavor spices other Indian food tasted   flavors muted leftovers yesterday   course can't prove but excitement enjoying spice just wasn't there   all kinda MEH   Chicken Tikka Masala really kind plain Tandoori Chicken near cold dry   Spinach Cheese very lackluster barely any flavor   Goat Biryani OK but parts rice undercooked sitting around heat long   really where HELL samosas?  trying funny some samosas chutney tamarind sauce!  Thought would standard fare   Most disappointing me?  naan bread!!  Why didn't each table fresh baked basked naan bread included buffet meal??  sitting buffet line instead   more limp Ron Jeremy party   Just kinda SAD   no fun trying dip almost rubbery naan bread into lifeless entrees   point just ate meal in   The chef owner approached asked everything was   and mean just couldn't   couldn't tell all very bland me   maybe off day?  Maybe regular cook out?  just don't know   just kinda told pretty good left that   We enquired cupcakes which strange because well   not many Indian places actually serve CUPCAKES   looked pretty but taken aback when found each $3 think   kinda figured would included buffet meal but  OK   Perhaps we'll try them another visit?  If indeed visit again     Price par other Indian buffets area $9 99 per person plus tax   Service very slow though took while plates cleared water refilled   probably because server hardly ever present dining area ours kept only going back forth kitchen mainly staying kitchen     Sorry Paradise India thought would welcome alternative usual Indian haunt   but guess we'll stay them now Indian fix   Keep trying! <EOR> This place sucks  Food horrendous  Owner rude  Started fight customer  He doesn't know treat people respect  <EOR> I buffet variety ok service seemed slow   Only biryani best rest Chana pakora bread pudding naan rest buffet didn't all service looked slow slowly refilling eating buffet bad stomach upset 2 days <EOR> We Friday evening pretty slow but server very attentive friendly   liked big screen TV playing also   overall portions very good while wasn't fan biryani thought flavor korma spot rice nice subtle flavor too   definitely back  <EOR> The food pretty good atmosphere great serve liquor  impressed selection  <EOR> Worst customer service ever !!!! 2 50pm before sit down asked server served should leave she said no seat serve right 5 minutes when order naan she said cook left no naans !!!
