Def improvement last time here  Service good attentive but 5 star  Met expectations  Would come back next time town  <EOR> STAY FAR AWAY place   horrible worst all Tahiti Village which fairly nice resort right next recommends crap food its guest owners   REALLY!! can't serious!!!   The place smells when first walk in   food horrible wouldn't feed dog! <EOR> I say food okay however when comes service disaster! ordering food took 37 min never refill water server two attempts failed deliver correct salad dressing!

<EOR> Good pay for  Nothing special  Good lunch while hanging around resort  Menu very limited  <EOR> I always find Tiki bars lot fun curious one   It's no Frankie's put rest   drinks okay   decor pleasant staff though most knowledgeable Tiki mug sold certainly staff seen mug least once able give better vague description it friendly enough   The food is    okay   prices large under $10   chicken fingers cool   cold but hot warm even lukewarm either   portions provided however ample   There pool ping pong tables bowling arcade game   ping pong table surprisingly active more often kids fishing ball underneath table   don't blame kids they polite apologetic frequent visits but table needs moved more dining area   The restaurant halfway full when all but empty time left   food needs prepped little more Tiki bar would think staff would little more aware product   don't pushy salespeople especially during meals but if someone asks show sample able describe item some detail   just display whether bar actually very nice looking menus   I may try them again   I'd mug very least   good place could work but need try environment lot more fun inviting   Trader Sam's Anaheim come mind  <EOR> So broke rule eating restaurant  totally empty Friday night shouldn't have  place obligatory 'I guess restaurant timeshare pitch resort' restaurant  resort mouth watering pictures yummy looking pulled pork sliders all over place but some reason aren't actually menu  place called Tahiti Joes Tahiti decor but only generic food  No coconut shrimp even burger grilled pineapple it  Total disconnect between concept food  potato skins clearly freezer stock overcooked barely edible  There's reason why Denny's below them packed Tahiti Joes empty  <EOR> There isn't much wrong Tahiti Joe's give horrible experience  all positives pretty good clean environment large TVs showing sports mood lighting right property Tahiti Village decent selection beers tap  The thing small things really bring place down  Things like strange butt smell when visited even mentioned workers no audio all TV watching sports less impactful completely dead even 8 PM  It's bad place location itself very convenient if you're staying Tahiti Village  problem much potential place feels fairly depressing without people   If bar imagine your own place catered your needs then place good you  But if you're person enjoys drinking crowd getting into excitement football game all audio entact then search elsewhere  <EOR> It amazing experience highly recommend it  soon walked felt Christmas warm atmosphere all staff floor Greeted warm smile  surprised diverse selection menu  pretty much everything think of  order chicken wings appetizer shrimp Alfredo pasta dinner  fresh absolutely delicious  food deliver timely manner European waiter awesome  desert ordered chocolate cake die for  diner stayed bar use $20 coupon  Bartender Randy super nice made awesome cocktails  <EOR> Saw magic show which each one ticket = coupon buy free drink   made drinks cheap enough enjoy   liked mai tai coke coke which fine   bar some video machines built classic Las Vegas large dining area tables abound   very empty when Friday night but then again off strip main action     Parking kind pain when crowded there's structure park but distance away   Outside parking even some covered available if all spaces taken    <EOR>
