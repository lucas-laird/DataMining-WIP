I ordered same thing before cheesecake custard waffle cone time   delicious!  shared little angel she loved too!  Yep!  glad found place!  Great people indeed! <EOR> Well reviewed CJ's awhile ago later decided close account realizing review would gone      back   What say?  lived small town thinks big city since 06' having born raised east coast Philadelphia   FAVORITE childhood memories Pop's Water Ice South Philly   staple every weekend visiting dad back then only lemon cherry chocolate vanilla brown      For past six years missed water ice dearly especially when hot outside  happy when tried place come back least once twice week   The owner staff personable friendly provide great customer service    The flavors great overly sweet compared places Rita's where your ice turns into watery syrupy mess      I'm still partial chocolate ice but tried just every flavor now they're making all time favorite mint chocolate chip cream ice can't any better   Prices won't break bank loyalty cards boot     EVERYONE should try CJ's oh normally custard girl but custard great well   Side note reading some other reviews never bad service place perhaps guys gal bad attitude? always treated smile day 1  Mmmmmmmm love pink Amoxicillin childhood favorite   sure try watermelon ASAP  <EOR> My husband Philadelphia wanted check place since he missed he back Philly  Previous review saw which trashed place seemed know Italian water ice was  Italian water ice completely different Italian gelato  If anyone likes Rita's water ice strongly recommended    Location great since right park grab wanter ice before take dogs park!   My husband said tasted Philly! personally did really know expect store but really enjoyed it  know isn't place try something healthy  enjoy something once while too! <EOR> I'm definitely no expert when comes ice custard but something just doesn't quite work right here  Being huge fan Rita's review probably little biased but honest possible   First off customer service pretty much non existent  walked looked across menu few minutes employee's said First time? but nothing more  Even telling yes unfamiliar menu she didn't offer any help samples suggestions even say anything all  also never offered punch card read either    Now far product ok   Rita's number times absolutely love gelati  CJ's  opinion just doesn't compare  ice extremely artificial taste cherry ice which tasted sno cone syrup  custard definitely creamy flavor wasn't bad but very strong egg taste which threw off  also frequent Luv It custard no where near offering  All all wasn't horrible but also wasn't great  Neither custard ice natural taste flavor several other places town   I'm edge giving place 3 stars cause few things really did place  first thing amount custard flavors offer  ton choices but huge downfall don't allow use flavored custard gelati  terms gelati itself other thing really stood amount custard use  If you've ever Rita's know use very small amount custard bottom section gelati but CJ's custard ice ratio just right  last thing enjoyed amount seating available  hate but going another comparison Rita's because only 1 bench sucks having eat outside curb especially when fairly large group  other hand understandable considering space work with    I'm fan making comparisons but when other places town offer exact product much higher quality in opinion hard too  Having Yelp $5 $10 nice way try CJ's but don't think we'll going back anytime soon  slightly further drive Luv It Rita's well worth it  <EOR> This dessert place tops! Lots options Italian ice gelato pudding   BF bypassed Wendy's try highly rated place while visiting Vegas  Watching others order trying decide want sample  both set concrete suggested customer ahead us! Regular size more enough check cup sizes <EOR> Custard gelato?

Very friendly service  Already filled stamp card 1 night 5 stamps ! SCORE <EOR> The Italian ice custards delicious  favorite custards simply because taste heaven cup  Just imagine custards being ice cream served same way if ice cream machine  However instead having soft consistency ice cream custards slightly thicker richer  custards extremely creamy aftertaste eggs use it   add various flavorings buttery goodness all sorts best way describe eating chilled butter cup    deliciously rich is Everyone favorite flavor going into details each specific taste  CJ's over 30 different flavors combinations mix match but find standard vanilla chocolate taste best  watch them when order you'll notice actually use vanilla custard base add flavorings mix your desired flavor  standard custard  flavors itself well balanced when comes sweetness but opinion more uncommon flavors such apple pie etc overly sweet bluntly generic tasting  keep mind when order unusual flavors   Just because listed menu doesn't always mean should made    IMO strawberry best have  <EOR> Wide variety ices custards! Sea salt caramel custard recommended! Strawberry ice also tasty  counter service but also quarts pints wide selection  Would definitely back  <EOR> My husband couple times  custard Italian ice good staff super sweet  closed 10 rolled around 10 15 still let order great attitude it  become go to dessert spot  CJs awesome! <EOR> I love place custards mainly  Love flavors options  Italian ice very sweet  Always super friendly  <EOR> I enjoyed frozen custard regular  cup vanilla banana mix  very creamy smooth texture  No complaints just looking dining Pan Asian few blocks up  thought price good also $3 75 regular cup  Way enough me <EOR> Mango favorite flavor   Today saw strawberry chocolate tempted try chocolate custard   But since mango it     I enjoy cold sweet treat am wondering winter going affect desire wonderful treat  <EOR> Oh  My  Goodness!!!!! place amazing!! came because saw video Facebook    let tell disappointed! tried bunch different flavors hard choose which with! pretty bummed only location  girl helped friendly!
