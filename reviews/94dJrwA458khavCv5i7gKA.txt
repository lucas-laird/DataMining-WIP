I pleased all returned dish     My kid's cheese pizza OK but outstanding  My main concern waiter made situation known owner sure looked owner once did he come  apologize say anything  He opportunity only 5 customers inside  including daughter I   They did take dish off bill owner did say Bye leaving but personally addressing issue hand just left don't care come back feeling  <EOR> This location where Don Antonio's used be   Thus can't help but compare Don Antonio's   The menu isn't big Don Antonio's prices bit more expensive well   Don Antonio's lunch special included soda salad   no lunch special half orders include soda salad   I spent $7 half order fettuccine alfredo   Pretty average tasting   Sauce thick it    Free bread served tasted okay   No oil vinegar but suppose maybe some just didn't ask   The immediate concern staffing   just isn't enough waitresses working   looked kitchen could use extra hand well   waitress polite worked hard but just many customers person   Anyways nothing really wrong place but definently going way like did Don Antonios Oh beware other reviews Yelp   six reviews all giving 5 stars all reviews 3 10 11   Seems little fishy   feeling fake reviews written employees  <EOR> My husband dined last Friday just average Italian food best   pasta fagioli soup tasted straight can   also Mediterranean salad menu didn't list feta ingredient but covered it   bad because listed never would ordered since husband don't really care feta   dressing watery bland   entree split tortellini rosa   really slow coming probably good 15 minutes time salad soup cleared   served hot but everything else nothing special   sauce average tomato sauce dash cream   felt could made comparable meal home   bread probably best part   served warm butter side   would really good balsamic vinegar olive oil     I am sad wasn't better   high hopes another great neighborhood Italian eatery   husband willing give second try but personally would waste time money  <EOR> I dinner two friends other night  really far away house which sucks because food pretty dang good!  We each pasta marinara sauce  friends meatball sausage those your options meatball sausage   all pretty good! kinda expected something more Ragu versus authentic but wrong! food good service good prices reasonable three dinners two sodas two glasses wine = $50     You're probably wondering why if liked place getting four stars five? You're smart wondering that  tell you when m'lady ordered glass white wine ordered red just brought some house stuff kinda warm  Neither those things huge deal it being warm being cheap but together kinda wasn't best    Having said would definitely come place again  <EOR>
