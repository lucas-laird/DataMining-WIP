He replied yes stood waiting patiently Eva ask would   entire time standing she never looked gave any eye contact even trying say good morning addressing name  next thing know another employee whom assume lunch break walked counter  She immediately acknowledged start speaking Spanish started making  omelette  Still giving benefit doubt  thought maybe she didn't see stood directly beside him  She completed omelette gave turned around walked away   point realize being blatantly ignored turned look manager initially saw behind counter  Before could say word  planning just ask if Eva spoke English he into rant saying we're working working new promotion   I guess referring omelette station didn't no idea new old   such shock next thing he said kind eggs want? point appetite ruined felt disrespected  looked dad just sit down eat food told leave it  Then asked manager immediately refund  realizing mistake he tried apologize but late  then name he just gave card no response asked name again then he blurted Tomas no handle Dissatisfied customer  problem would've easily resolved he said station open when asked did fresh eggs  Eva Tomas could've simply said station wasn't ready  <EOR> LOVE BACK!

It's around $12 per person which good price   So finally place filled capacity   scanned all offerings gotta say wasn't much   extensive dessert area but more interested having dinner   Off top head saw 1   Popcorn shrimp 2   Fried Fish 3   Steak fries 4   Pizza 5   Meatloaf  6   Pasta 7   Ribs 8   Ham 9   Salad bar  It okay quality  popular stuff often left empty   tried some things listed okay tasting having fight rude folks cutting line just hogging everything   I guess people really offer steak its supposedly cooked your desired temperature [which wasn't]   portions given 1 inch 3 inch rectangular piece   know hard satisfy masses but having multiple times piece together steak annoying   The staff actually really nice  really don't know deal crazy rude greedy clientele  think I'd headache each every day worked there   All all wasn't worth wait  similar Hometown buffet   I'd rather just some cheap Chinese buffet locally  <EOR> Have dined weekday lunch weekend dinner price little complaints Golden Corral!   I've spoiled Asian themed buffets Vegas nice change dine eating various types food  love variation BBQ pulled pork mashed potatoes cheeseburgers sliders on    But favorite thing eat   multiple plates would be    yeast rolls  Yessir YEAST ROLLS  softest fluffiest pillows bread heaven   paired whipped honey butter  would pay $8 just unlimited amounts bread    Everything else though A OK  Nothing special but said good change am used to  price can't wrong  Especially if end your meal big cloud cotton candy    What say? easily amused  <EOR> Ok go  Being TX Golden Corral popular choice because all other great buffets such Furrs Ryans  Golden Corral big chain all over place but being said tried because no Furrs Ryans CA heard place just opened  Everything typical TX  except 1  long lines unheard of 2  don't bring rolls your table 3  service good all  hardley ever tip service must awful my tip waiter  smile act want happy food selection expected much  choice compared Furrs  cool if some time spend chat friends family but caution long lines    Tip If plan going dinner take some chairs blanket books pack lunch! lines horrible never seen such long lines Golden Corral ever! <EOR> It would first last time  literally pay would rather pay eat somewhere else  place just plain disgusting dirty smells bad  couldn't myself eat really don't know if food even good  Maybe if pass dirty place is     could try eat  But why would even want try food if place dirty? Eek! Methinks not  <EOR> The line ridiculously long! see why herd people come price incredibly inexpensive variety food available  food quality notch higher Hometown Buffet  really tasteful steaks made your liking cotton candy real ice cream soft serve but real authentic ice cream  bad whopping $12 so  Would come again? Maybe but sure won't anytime soon  am claustrophobic thought having through whole waiting line ordeal squeezing derriere through crowds just food items pretty anxiety inducing me  price food quality right but worth anxiety attack just worth it  <EOR> We've twice good experiences both times  bit drive but great place kids because two kids completely different eating habits  Last night son chowed down popcorn shrimp grilled fish sauted mushrooms veggies  Then options picky daughter French toast macaroni cheese haha   something everyone chocolate fountain dessert always fun  <EOR> I Golden Corral boyfriend swear every time more expensive last time  Right now all shrimp shrimp shrimp  wrong shrimp but more variety meat would nice  food OK  Nothing more nothing less  staff very nice though especially waitress Samantha  She amazing  end food worth price  <EOR> Have several times each time horrible experience  Poor food quality very tasty selection establishment poorly ran <EOR> Came lunch shit  No steak  But only 8 99 can't complain  definatly good place overweight people  All kinds fried foods mac n cheese  bathrooms suprisingly really clean   but some little shit standing next stall whole time while there  Little black feet stall shit  refilled beverages very well but lunch can't say anything dinner   wait can  took fucking white chocolate fondue! ! If you're looking white chocolate fondue look somewhere else   but all just advice whatever    FUCK wanna do <EOR> As American buffet places good amount variety here  True there's long line when enter but expected   the wait 30 minute plus   interior fairly big   There's fish section Mexican section beef section dessert section salads etc  etc     It's shopping plaza there's plenty parking   quality certainly beats Hometown Buffet  perhaps around level Wood Grill Buffet   three friends came two $20 special going on   meat juicy loved chocolate dipped strawberries general variety all really place   layout interior isn't best admittedly  lines snake around haphazardly where people would accidentally find themselves cutting line while getting meat   Pretty good buffet place   Admittedly tend avoid buffet places  <EOR> Ok   read number reviews first thing say why would buffet then disappointed buffet?  mean     duh? Oh your friends family someone else's fault dragged here!  what?  buffet?  choice could said no! The first time into modern style buffet wasn't Hometown but same concept knew conceived military mess NCO   mess hall food  Food cooked en masse lot hungry people same time   When cook eggs case don't personal chef touch can't expect cooked taste   rest food   The bottom line if want nice quiet setting food cooked your order then DON'T BUFFET ANY BUFFET!  As buffets best which eaten!  The quality food cooking better far Hometown any other Cal   selection better wider actually steak cooked basically order   All eat steak $14!  Claim Jumper Outback but then $35 either    The cleanliness would expect place  constantly filled capacity most day   far each time seats tables wiped off clean plates cups utensils all clean   The negative well only problem sole reason four stars instead five although regular announcements over speakers children must adult them all times station employees monitor counters enforce rule all people don't monitor kids   small children often getting own food demonstrating exactly why shouldn't be   I even small problem yesterday afternoon  minor issue but manager handed business card coupon free dinner next visit   My recommendation if you're looking nice sit down restaurant somewhere else but if want all you can eat buffet best! <EOR> Go early late avoid long line  But don't fooled line food definitely isn't worth wait   In addition long line into restaurant gotta wait them refill half food items  mean see tons people working yet they're really doing anything  items salad bar edible  Most food items below average tasteless overly high sodium  lighting harsh whole time felt cafeteria   Tables placed very closely each other barely any room people walk by  Even skinniest girl would walk sideways still brush past shoulder   The only thing worth praising attentive waitress seemed always pop table right times when half empty cup needed refill when plates emptied when done meal she asked if needed coffee dessert   Other wouldn't give place single star if option that   Needless say wouldn't back there  even chocolate fountain  <EOR> Foods surprisingly good! Salad bar though  The type people come pass  Super crowded weekday cant imagine bad gets during weekends  People costantly cut infront while your still serving yourself while your walking just around place   Had big tattooed girl insult she passed me  Yeah no thanks  dont need feel uncomfortable some jerk elbow elbow with  <EOR> My family 9 last night only location Las Vegas stunned upon entering  bottle necking entrance poor design  ever decided good idea families drinks first then parents fumble between drinks kids  wallet pay should fired  Jon Taffer Bar Rescue might able provide some scientific feedback proper flow into restaurant  Seating crowded mention space between tables buffet lines wide enough allow guests properly pass another without bumping elbows  should condiment locations specific locations both ends easier access  food over all good but ambience layout poor    Suggestion relocate self service beverage bar past cashier continue let self service  wait server refills he pre occupied clearing dirty dishes cleaning tables  <EOR> This ALL YOU CAN EAT buffet fondue fountains action! start dessert because place now triple fountain!!!

Salad bar fresh fresh ingredients all lined mini grocery store behind counter see    The hot food okay despite some tasty sounding dishes food itself pretty mediocre  Nothing terrible but pay for   Dessert average nothing stands out    except fondue fountain cotton candy! chocolate took advantage myself  huge fan cotton candy but kids nuts over it! took little cousin she loved it   Place clean though staff working hard things moving  <EOR> Worst food ever  hardly ever complain but but bad walked hungry walked sick  never ever such bad experience   service slow  facility mess  soda fountain broken   Every thing tried hard stomach   brother law spent $41 but honestly way much pay food taste came sewage treatment plant  <EOR> There isn't really much say place because didn't enjoy much   but don't really enjoy any buffets outside vegas price paid guess 2 stars  Regardless   you wait long line I'm assuming due cheap price drink   I prefer drink because don't even refill yourself 1 99 which alright but flagging down your waiter waitress just another drink kinda missing point Buffet? Anyway entirely sure drinks price but think friend paid around $11 lunch soft drink sounds right   Regardless don't find any dishes memorable all tasted bland salty  honestly don't know if really complain cause shouldn't expect much but yea  memorable part dessert cookies cream pecan 2 other flavors ice cream unlimited  something look forward even though best ice cream you'll ever taste but certainly beats having only vanilla chocolate ice cream all time   Anyway   my tastebud spoiled give try if want but don't see myself coming buffet any time soon  <EOR> Let first say looking reason drive try because eaten several GC's Nebraska when vacation each year Omaha Bellevue Lincoln locations really nice place eat  always surprised selection fresh fruits veggies nice meat options figured CA location should better even yet  did see reviews most which hot but decided would check weigh against locations enjoyed   1 SALAD BAR leafy items lettuce spinach etc mushy soaking wet assume water but ended being soggy pretty much edible i believe its pretty hard ruin fresh lettuce spinach isn't it?

Very fresh vegetables lots choices very clean   Even though servers lot tables plenty refills drinks!  would definitely recommend Golden Corral!!!! <EOR> Well when lucky spared long lines usually see  food good being buffet above average  only knocks give place seating horrible feel cramped seating also when walk around wait line u literally walk around few people back your table  other knock place waiter which more buss boy suppose give u refills waiter only refilled twice each time waited long time those refills  wait terrible refills walked beverage station told them refill because rather myself then wait  place ok food good family would come back again  <EOR> I spent few years south FL GA SC Golden Corral always favor when am craving fast cheap AYCE southern comfort food  Once even twice week normal me   After returning Cali craving Golden Corral long remember  Before which safely say ONLY entire LA basin opens Victorville across border Kingman AZ fix   Before continue reading review I'd state am limiting review few items consider Golden Corral signature items  somehow briefly touch other subjects well review fair possible   I buffet Sunday afternoon soon arrived parking lot saw line actually turned around LOL NOPE then head home  48 hours later there  No line outside establishment nor any waiting inside well  put bluntly try visit if weekday before lunch dinner rush if possible   Most patrons found drinking fountain provided before even pay intriguing  However please aware south when hot humid outside first thing want soon step into Golden Corral grab cup fill ice sweet tea chug down sigh relief  tea provided fountain? say pretty close provide south   My first plate include southern style cabbage much wish collard green pot roast mac cheese corn bread some fried chicken pieces different sauces  only thing close back south pot roast cabbage  very disappointed corn bread  guess just difficult southern signature item Cali  Mac Cheese alright fried chicken pieces actually pretty good   My second plate consist meat loaf fried okra chicken wings which advertised TV bourbon street chicken over rice  meatloaf slightly better Hometown Buffet offers  chicken wings? Well I'd avoid them  bad but fried chicken pieces first plate WAY better  fried okra    tell okra frozen then thawed improperly before frying  bourbon street chicken? All taste salt seasoning  No flavor detected all   My last plate piece fried chicken drum stick more cabbage piece fried catfish hush puppy  fried chicken pretty much spot except salty  catfish? Surprisingly decent  going frozen fish but able keep flavor seasoning identical offer south  hush puppy? Well sick dog bad way   I didn't any dessert  know even though offers pretty close counterparts south but sure baked back there  skipped dessert all together   The biggest problem most food WAY MUCH SALT  aware southern cooking heavy compare rest country but amount salt sodium dishes just way overwhelming    Yes kids run wild but some said affordable family buffet kids going present sure   As size restaurant? average other Golden Corrals least ones to  Oh layouts almost identical   Services? Please give servers chance  very limited walking space clearance work while avoiding running into fellow coworkers patrons trying clean plates refill drinks fast can  Treat them want treated   Cleanness? par  sure health inspector frown upon certain things but can't expect spotless when nothing but constant foot traffic  trying clean though  Notice hand sanitizers dish stations wrist hook restroom doors   Hype? Well some hypes associated Golden Corral  Then again being only around offers great price going busy   Bottom line Golden Corral below par other Golden Corrals  However compare other chain buffets? still kicks other places groin price to food ratio   Will back again? Only when craving some cheap southern comfort food   If want something different your buffet offerings LA basin give try  Pick off peak day time try some southern stuff instead other dishes other places making if better well   The only thing  missing hot humid thick air brushing against your face when walk out  <EOR> Ate dinner family today honestly okay  wasn't expecting much since just all eat place American food but wasn't bad    They huge selection foods range Mexican American stuff between    Nothing tried really stood other steaks made order  think highlight whole meal  choose want cooked tough some steaks    Honestly better going hometown buffet reason chose place cause there's always bunch people trying okay    Would back?

Some might consider good customer service but left alone try enjoy meal  dont having 2 3 servers constantly hovering over while eat  10th interruption finaly bit rude said away already     Another thing kind sucks charge extra 1 99 per drink top buffet price  several buffets where price 7 9 dollars drinks included  servers other buffets jobs most part leave alone enjoy youre meal  If plan going place way system just bring youre own bottled water     Golden corral seems crowd tables close together  Over all enjoyable dining experience  <EOR> With many reviews sure add except say Golden Corral moderately priced family buffet restaurant serves variety reasonably good food     There 45 minute wait inside place   afraid line outside might lead Disneylandish labyrinth endlessly circling lines inside but thankfully wasn't bad   The items all fine steak meatloaf mashed potatoes peas carrots fried fish chicken tenders chocolate covered Rice Krispy square chocolate chip cookie     The lines inside fairly quick only line cutting incident surprisingly chocolate fountain     So want affordable buffet hungry enough worth it  <EOR> Fatties Reunite Golden Corral  When stepped into wondrous buffet which commonly seen commercials but eluded thus far life knew ready surprise  huge line rather obese individuals couples families  knew belonged here   2 $20 4 pm Mondays Thursdays  Oh lord  Someone save myself  When first stepped saw huge buffet much bigger Hometown which comparable but think Golden Corral definitely edge   There better quality meat food desserts also pretty good well  love cotton candy  also great fatty points Horchata  Service good place fairly clean well   Skip Hometown Golden Corral weekdays if feel being fat spending only little money  <EOR> It probably could good experience if place wasn't such zoo  mean having lots customers isn't bad reflection retaurant but buffett really puts damper things when wait line every helping food  4 afternoon weekday! waited maybe 15 minutes just in when left line much much longer  mention many people really loud not fun TGI Fridays way hard just move around which todo lot since buffet    The food comparable median quality Hometown Buffet gone HB better food times worse others  other words terrible but good  some special offerings pan seared seafood steak but if experience representative norm which according many reviews is probably won't try them  because just small pan time each taking several minutes  It' worst both worlds wait sit down restaurant except buffet rather sitting your table having someone bring when ready even having number called just he stand line while cook hope you'll able some   The thing waiters bring your drink reviewer said it may Google Reviews practically beg refill  Seeing you're AYCE buffet full salty fried food having them more top refills or having self serve drinks Hometown Buffet would big help   Overall very unhapy experience  would try Golden Corral again sometime but am hesitant  Some things improved drinks being self serve least refilled reliably but if never time dinner lunch limited menu where line isn't door place more corral restaurant sure done short opening second nearby  <EOR> The pot roast yeast bread really good   however long wait definitely worth it   and really crowded Tuesday! thought line would died down since open 2 months but nope still waited 45 mins plus table!

Grill possibly Italian station? also small breakfast selection where some crispy delicious bacon    The line Grill long because serving steaks  don't even whole steak just small piece stingy pieces  really disappointed steaks because gristly  whole bottle steak sauce could give steak flavor  baked potato small salad done  grabbed cotton candy dessert station way too  best thing ate there  worth price $13 even more if drink  far many buffets town same price much better  <EOR> Oh word  place pretty great  wanting come since location opened but scared long lines   and more scared packed would inside  finally enough courage late lunch family Tuesday still pretty packed!!  But see why packed  food pretty great  favorites roast beef OMG YUM mashed potatoes pumpkin pie enchiladas weren't bad either    I might wait another month back because busy is   even weekdays  people work anymore?? hated more food because super stealth navigate around customers looking where going kids running employees frantically walking around  <EOR> Yesterday first time still ask all hype about? food certainly did add expectations  Everyone told basically Las Vegas buffet  no where comparison Las Vegas buffet  Granted lot variety food cater many different tastes though sure Asian section but overall food okay  Nothing particular stood out  group 14 quite accommodating wait long   Parking okay because dinner time around 8 pm Saturday  Once line heads into door actually another shape before cash register  But before drinking fountain etc set which find quite odd because no instructions whether clear cups fountain drinks only if also used water  lot never before confused quite bit some people only wanted water no soda  ended just using cup filling water station near cash register  tap water did weird taste guess because really tap water  If want refill anything you'll flag down your waiter which quite taxing times    I only mid section buffet which consisted corn fried chicken mashed potatoes fried shrimp steak etc  did anywhere near salad Asian section  dessert section did lot variety nice baker's corner  fountain section bit confusing barely anything laid next fountains which use  lines also sometimes confusing people would line certain areas only steak etc  plates also very clean could feel some grim there  Overall think would ever come back again  Definitely worth wait  workers really nice waiter very attentive! <EOR> Golden Corral general just see tv bottom line  only thing liked service  Im never coming back here  $18 00 literally cant believe it  food quality cheap gross  Took more then 2 bites dinner proceeded   fruits sweet section  Even favorite bread pudding feel its good everywhere but here    dry just eh  dont even started ratchetry location even though know its just location but still  <EOR> This best buffet Vegas  very affordable variety good tasted great  cost around $120 7 eat dinner time  Definitely going back  only reason why am giving 3 stars because issue below  busier day  table next larger family time done saying good byes 3 children ground literally rolling around  wasn't server area quite sometime noticed  way children still ground rolled section before mother attempted pick them up  total liability someone could really gotten hurt  fine dining parents should kept closer eye kids but servers management should kept closer eye  worked food beverage industry know very stressful chaotic but issue should take back seat  <EOR> I damn excited see Golden Corral open hometown  much hype just based exclusiveness blew up  Since opened tried eat 3 times every time walked away because line insanely long  last time finally patience wait all way  First all parking isn't problem plenty lot room  surprised why didn't just expand restaurant use some parking lot room   Food wise home town buffet would crying  gave slight memory vegas buffets but personally felt quality wasn't all there  don't know if come back choice atleast wouldn't crave place  But wouldn't mind going over home town buffet  <EOR> It ok me  Definitely alot options  Would different options far breaded fried foods  Server attentive <EOR> I heard lot hype place  friends really hate buffets especially buffets similar Home Town tell good place pretty high expectations   The food definitely above Home Town level  taste quality ingredients because don't taste cardboard actually flavor  Some favorite dishes Mango Shrimp Steak  Desserts very good well   Pretty solid price but beware crowd  <EOR> The food good but dessert bar gross compared Arizona  enough pie!!!! pies no sugar added  Gross  only good dessert option cookies   Note start salad bar  Its really empty! You'll understand why when go    Service good  <EOR> This place great when first opened but quality service food definetly dropped since then  took kids other day server didn't come table time until complained manager  wish place would step especially considering cheap here <EOR> Don't really know why line door   The food really heavy felt rolling outside  door afterwards because bloated  Figures mean DID buffet But all seriousness simply Hometown Buffet    chocolate fountain  Nothing spectacular  <EOR> I've tried staying away seeing crazy long lines freeway but worked time!   No line weekday afternoon    First time GC pleasantly surprised   Everything really fresh flavorful   ambiance better Hometown bright colorful   loved people manning stations instead someone running around refill food   feels extended Souplantation   Here some highlights meal Fried chicken perfectly fried flavorful Fried okra really yummy Cotton candy fun eat Sweet tea good but lil sweet Mini slider perfectly charred  Not great items Chicken soup Clam chowder thick Caramel Dark Choc White Choc fountains thin but apples yummy  All all I'd back if weren't line  <EOR> Not entirely sure big deal Golden Corral but guess buffet super low prices   say good value money   I mean $10 eat pretty much anything including steak?  Yeah even old fat kid approves this   The quality food slightly better Hometown Buffet definitely more options   But all hubbub steak didn't think particularly impressive   Guy cooking doesn't even know cut it   general though food good buffet no complaints   Also fan structured steak line   it's pretty much right middle seafood section   confusing   I don't know if I'd come again though   don't think stomach waiting hour any restaurant anymore  <EOR> Was really impressed place   High quality food surprise buffet   steaks made order quite tasty   some favorites but didn't try everything steak fried shrimp fried catfish texas toast mexican rice   dessert bar awesome 6 different flavors ice cream chocolate fondue strawberries frozen yogurt cookies pies   salad bar look good but didn't chance try out   service phenomenal   didn't feel rushed waiter very attentive drinks clearing plates   Yes line ridiculously long we waited hour weekend probably wouldn't stayed line if wasn't niece's b day   You're best bet weeknight   told take reservations weeknight but weekend  <EOR> Came packed   Busier any other buffet Las Vegas   LARGE selection choices   Problem placards label food weren't accurate all   Sometimes could easily tell other times couldn't   Tons kids without adult supervision running around even though kept announcing signs saying let your little hellions run around   try again   Food quality decent  <EOR> If love steak don't want spend much your spot all eat steak    Line long but worth wait if craving steak    everything else average    Definitely back more <EOR> Although particularly FINE culinary experience definitely interesting one  Worth checking least once fun factor  personally would avoid any seafood isn't fried  looked okay but better safe sorry  <EOR> Wow!!!!! Thats all say dont want offend anyone just say wow!!!! say made attempt being seated decided NOPE just good  refund walked door  Enter establishment your own risk    personally id rather pay few more bucks eat someplace NICE    <EOR> Not sure what's great Golden Corral why such long line place  just seemed any other ordinary American buffet  If anything lot seats chocolate fountain  Food quality fine but didn't really find anything special  did enjoy chocolate fountain though! Yumz  <EOR> Came friend family  Gotta try place since its all over tv commercials  Food imagine Hometown Buffet but way better  looks thing everything super fresh themselves  bread pasta  would recommend getting steak first cause if its busy which always then long line but line moves pretty quick no worries  plus freak load don't worry them running steak  soups pretty good too  myself clam chowder some good chowder  Fresh bread every often  everything seems its cooked spot   Oh dessert pretty darn good  its something talk but hey own chocolate fountain  plus  also ice cream which scoop know no kids adult would sticking nasty ass fingers them  oh drinks self refillable  ask your waiter waitress refill them   OK    Service say busy place service pretty darn outstanding  waiter introduced himself very kindly  Very attentive  since its busy bit hard getting attention but did attention  good thing  cleaned your tables quickly possible  plus   * every time would come back table all plates done no longer did exceptional job*  Location im glad opened somewhat near where live cause before would San Fran San Diego which ever another would border mexico California  yea good place   side note drinks waiting line  water soda same cup but charged less water  iono if notice getting water then refilling sprite something   in total price dinner drink would 14 99 exact <EOR> Their no line which nice but layout confusing  looks little more let down person tv  Large salad station desert station but actual food much selection  server Pablo very polite actually why 3 stars  <EOR> I  Golden Corral locations Calif  Utah Las Vegas although buffet person am impressed amount food selection   First must say no line when last night   shock that   But very happy considering every time always line   least 20 30 minute wait      Last night family Specialty night Wednesday steak wings   disappointed only flavor wings don't spicy food   pass that   But rave reviews other people abut steak   liked Meat loaf fish fried okra   Still all all plenty everyone find something eat   dessert bar sweet persons paradise   now cotton candy wow!!!

Other then everything else great  <EOR> The day come which Southern California Golden Corral within reasonable driving distance!  No more drooling over those enticing commercials only online google nearest Golden Corral 100 miles away!    After having both lunch dinner think say buffet better version hometown buffet but nothing special   Maybe just spoiled all those Las Vegas buffets   What don't place First off don't having start off drink machines carry drink while waiting line   then carry drink all way tables   then when table when run soft drink coffee tea water need flag down waiter order refill   Why?  Because once inside actual buffet only dispensers operated servers only  fail   Second actual buffet area poorly designed   never know line because often times lines fuse together   Third most importantly   lot golden corral advertises t v  restaurant   perhaps because just starting out?  But felt selection wasn't great should be   What like Even though lot items fast all let someone know they'll nice try replace item quickly possible   servers friendly well buffet staff which nice dining experience   Food expect standard buffet   Some items taste better others but nothing going blow your socks off   Just decent food okay price   All all would come again?  Sure would but probably same frequency visit someplace Hometown buffet which really 2 3 times year if even that   no reason people should dreaming golden corrals anymore   folks believe stopping isn't something craving for  <EOR> After seeing commercial TV finally try place   kinda hesitated when saw reviews yelp three stars still better Hometown buffet only two   When saw line thinking long take   However also convinced myself if food wasn't good no reason people wait line long   Right?!  The wait wasn't bad 25 minutes think   variety foods yummy!! roasted chicken much juicy soft   cooked just well!! clam chowder pretty good too   foods very decent really enjoyed it  I'm very picky The desert section pretty good   scopes ice cream provided you   tried cookie cream good   best thing cotton candy just seconds   really liked that   beverage $1 99 each but didn't know until paid   Because saw everyone getting drink  LOL   But refillable reasonable  <EOR> This place da bomb!

Because Lamb Blvd  location nice part town relatively speaking  <EOR> Terrible service! Half servers cannot understand English  Half plates dirty unclean  Half food missing buffet line  Sorry say returning location nor recommending anyone  <EOR> I am fan buffets never personal health reasons    I came group celebrate not idea place crowded 3pm lunch  people gave unfriendly looks small run down joint business pick some pop corn shrimp fried fish veggies other fixings   What say? Food taste better hometown buffet  given but don't buffets all because generic cheap greasy unhealthy food something am huge fan of   If your idea good time celebrating occasion unfriendly dirty disgusting establishment all means I won't come again     Just keep mind price also comes type demographic environment  If expecting nice quiet peaceful enjoyable breakfast lunch dinner might want throw down your chips somewhere else    A dinner date here? If really want cut short your personal relationship then place it! <EOR> Muy buen servicio! La gente muy amable y despus de las 4 pm buena carne para el precio! Los felicito! <EOR> I really wanted location better  traveled AZ UT many occasions dine locations state locations fared way better   With being only location Las Vegas anticipated long line  Sunday late morning  wait time 15 20 minutes  helped drink fountain located area where wait line  cashier friendly host seating us   With being busy location time frame mind disappointed  restaurant set buffet style   Certain areas messy where people spilled items all over serving trays workers fast enough keeping trays looking clean tidy  a quick glance wipe down would take 10 seconds but many workers stood behind stations moving double checking anything    My son dig into mashed potatoes tray when worker quickly swiped tray scrape tater remains into another full tray taters without much quick smile 'hold second fresh taters instead' acknowledgement  just stood serving spoon dripping tater remains mouths agape   Had husband reviewing restaurant instead would guess he would give place star  More once he came back table disappointed look once because ranch dressing twice because dish looked most delicious kept running worker station responded less friendly manner when he asked wait time would be    Another observation no way affects rating gave place restaurant patrons RUDE  cut line serve themselves something  let kids run dessert area dip desserts into chocolate fountain which results splatters spills mess kids shoving each other  hectic!   PROS desserts chocolate fountain cotton candy favorite  CONS employees SMILE acknowledge patrons  <EOR> Food excellent  big fan fountains but everything overall tops!  Funny stand outside line crazy but through ready fast  Roast delicious didn't seem lot variety but full great  I think first Golden Corral Vegas great  Hopefully  stays tops!    plan going back when bit quieter!! closed Christmas case wanting go!! <EOR> All say WOW! sure if its good wow though  seen many years now all commercials TV Golden Corral try myself  considering there's few them Southern California must try   I pass City Industry Golden Corral every time travel into Los Angeles  always busy   The other word really comes mind visit Golden Corral SODIUM!!! Boy everything really salty  honest food wasn't bad place this  buffalo chicken wings pretty good bourbon chicken not good fried chicken good salty roasted chicken good salty steak slider dry hard bun Southern style fried fish fish tender but soggy cornmeal breading fried okra same problem fish pork steak very good but salty    Overall I'd say better would expected  sure reminded Sizzler meets Home Town Buffet Steroids!! <EOR> The place ok  enchiladas dry some fries same issue dry felt they've sitting while  Mac cheese ok  place similar hometown buffet but Golden Corral tad bit better  Didn't try fountain but next time sure ill try it <EOR> It good but wouldn't back  food okay  during all eat wings advertise because there's much selection  many people really enjoy it  lot kids running around people cutting line buffet line overall cluttered  worth going once try it  <EOR> Uh am mad whole family eat under $50! am mad finally Golden Corral Las Vegas  Although if am being all way honest am bit mad put east side  Come ghetto travel $12 buffet promise  But same token lonely ol' east side grew needed some good food  Hopefully when dine crowd bit more pleasant   My bf decided try lunch please don't tell kids   total under $20 instant score opinion  also offer sweet tea  Double score  You wait line pay drinks before reaching cashier  Somewhat silly because if waitresses aren't game bit hard refill  Plus holds line bit  lunch selections bad all! Pasta pizza meatloaf fish fried chicken few Asian choices small salad area  desserts section big but chocolate fountain didn't look all sanitary skipped  perfect height kids no sneeze guard walk right stick dirty little bug eating butt picking fingers right it! watched plenty un supervised kids exactly that  Don't take wrong way sneeze guard but if under 4 feet tall! ambiance really reminded eating Charleston Lamb really hoping would avoid that  But honestly people eating watching kids getting every possible bang buck could set tone   I return mostly let kids try it  see experience then decide if continue dine  <EOR> Been twice both times disappointment  doesn't appear isn't any management   employees please   Both times did refill  lucky if pick your plates   looks mass confusion   chocolate fountain must full germs all unsupervised kids fingers it  Last but least   ordered medium rare steak well done steak   mentioned cook asked more rare  another well done steak  really anticipated much better experience <EOR> here las vegas nv  the food  very salty wife hight  pressure   spoke general manager  did  lister     did respect  professional  he said 4 year those  cooks did job well    <EOR> I've better but also paid very much more  I've worse but also paid very much more    For Thanksgiving aunt uncle cousins Golden Corral avoid having cook clean  All endure almost 90 minute wait line though    As far food quality inexpensive buffet didn't sick while same time isn't making scream mountain tops eat there  Service surprisingly good jobs clear tables refill drinks  No taking orders bringing them dealing bill    It ok  all say  all comes mind  <EOR> Horrible customer service!! waitress hardly came table she standing behind station restrooms whole time  guy making cotton candy rude children waiting  restroom smelled outhouse! returning  <EOR> You know what? actually dig place  came expecting much very pleasantly surprised whole deal  Quantity quality service value    check x 4    Don't wrong  Golden Corral no means place would expect 5 star cuisine    but price point think totally spot on  I'd heard others expecting worse Hometown Buffet luckily then some   Really enjoyed salad bar very fresh good selection    cheddar biscuits totally reminded Red Lobster's version  Some items hit miss  Mini sliders total surprise hit us  Stick basic American comfort foods fried chicken meatloaf mac cheese etc  you'll just fine  Chinese food very meh    So doubt 4 stars? 9 bucks all eat babe  good totally outweighs bad  can't wrong that  <EOR> First off 5 Star restaurant nor does endeavor be  rating comparison other casual buffets    I've more buffets then care admit including many Golden Corrals while traveling around country    Honestly sure all negativity about  store kept very clean especially considering volume customers  around 3 Wednesday no lines but already crowded inside  food good quality better many competitors there's large variety choose from  Mexican Chinese food strong points but still add selection  salad desert bars very extensive featuring cold shrimp strips steak crumbled blue cheese chocolate fondue cotton candy hand scooped ice cream respectively   I truly think all bad reviews just written people dislike buffets which fine but being case why would first place then complain it? If buffets your best bets  quality selection offered hard believe lunch just over 8 bucks which probably why line often door    In all fairness some downsides  crowd pain doesn't exactly relaxing meal but keep food well stocked lines moving best can  crazy buffet set where all food row opposed various scatter bars  convenient creates line ups  really don't care having drink bar counter before pay  takes longer check tiresome waiting overworked staff bring refills  never order drink costs more only serve Pepsi products  ick but low water several times    In short you're looking affordable meal variety large enough please your whole family then place you  If want quiet meal stunning ambience gourmet food most likely cost over $10  <EOR> Finally Golden Corral near home! eaten Bakersfield very good  now try one!

No honestly but seemed VERY busy obviously may missing something here     <EOR> Saturday night Corral! YEAH! only other Missouri five years ago remember smuggling honey buns back Cali  worth money wait  hometown buffet crowd cheaper version high end Vegas buffet  buffet steak steak burgers worth stopping at  Check if you're area because few far between Cali  <EOR> I came expecting very little pleasantly surprised  If choose between Sizzler Golden Corral I'd GC  food top quality but really cheap either  only thing say really don't line in  If come wrong time feel you're line Space Mountain  You know where hate waiting but know when front line you'll happy waited  Anyhow your basic buffet set Asian Mexican Seafood Salads Desserts yadda yadda  thing everyone seems love moi cotton candy  don't understand fascination  Maybe because only seem when you're fair ball game seem special  If decide remember switch dinner pricing 4pm  would around 3 30 still gets lunch pricing but able partake dinner buffet  pretty much means steak! <EOR> Something tells if don't speak Spanish you're welcome interesting employees stare if any food buffet  asked manager why she all containers salad bar off salad bar she said  normally do  explained counted least 10 containers chiller didn't seem concern hers  However she did advise they'll closing down salad bar if already plate  Maybe misunderstanding term buffet  won't coming again  <EOR> Where start?  Maybe because brunch  place feels old buffets Vegas drab decor extra large above clientele  few edible items but most just average below  Even fruit taste just okay  fresh juicy  least dirt cheap less $10 adult sans carbonated drinks   think main draw just cheapness  <EOR> I came Tuesday afternoon before holiday 4pm  no line outside building but crowded inside  would believe equivalent Hometown Buffet  left around 6pm lot less people eat pretty much no line    When steak always gotten small piece fatty parts  time asked medium rare gotten piece straight raw  saw lot people going mac cheese  believed going good myself good serving small portion cold   I'd probably come again if wasn't line  <EOR> Dis gus ting  still sick stomach day after  <EOR> The service excellent thank Big Te taking such good care us! food amazing hot fudge!!!! only issues first dinner rolls hard bottom mashed potatoes thin other everything amazing! restaurant clean even amount customers managers assisting cleanup! Two thumbs up!!!! <EOR> Golden Corral graced Las Vegas its mediocre buffet city known every casino just every block has     buffet   My husband decided throw towel try place out  months seeing parking lot full brim lines door saw wasn't busy Saturday afternoon   First impressions your beverage before pay herded into establishment cattle lo behold    enter complete utter MADNESS   Pros Selection decent  Desserts plentiful  Cons Food mediocre place small mad house    Apparently Golden Corral does good job telling its guests corral CHILDREN  Although signs posted say Children must accompanied adults all times  suggestion thrown window  Children run rampant without parental supervision knocking into people plowing way into buffet lines  adults aren't any better  There's no rhyme reason people food there's no lines speak of  all out brawl fest  almost   Cleanliness issue  husband searched table could find decently cleaned wipe down remove dirty napkins just could place eat  also watched family two small infants allows children sloppily plow through food fling said food all over floor gross   Overall never again  <EOR> I finally tried place evening  line long  high expectations place but sadly disappointed  food didn't please palate  Perhaps spoiled Asian buffets  Even though seated near chocolate fountain didn't dare eat it  just many people  Just many people comfort felt bit dirty eating there  Both adults kids messy dripping dropping food floor  staff quick clean any messes  quality food ok almost hometown   I liked strawberries because very sweet ate them itself  Most stuff tried ok  Perhaps would give place try again future but lunch time  Going dinner expensive  <EOR> Since only Las Vegas plan ahead dine here  lines dine usually long but food worth while waiting   staff work very assertive friendly   Server named Irene joy reckoned killer smile professionalism want come back   recommend anyone come dine just plan ahead before coming <EOR> It's cheap boring buffet food   If looking Las Vegas style presentation going find here   Good deal breakfast   mean wrong eggs potatoes right?  Lunch dinner mediocre   Most food serve tasteless commercially produced food   two steps above Hometown Buffet   Save your money across street Chili's better food   Even better idea just Costco down street grab few hot dogs large pizza total bargain  <EOR> DISGUSTING!  After waiting hour finally arrived near end line where grab strawberry soda  paying cheap admission price $12 eager start dinner hopes would decent given all hype    10 minutes later ate raw canned corn which half cooked piece steak rock solid when suppose medium rare chow mein which tastes far even mein lukewarm broccoli  made really appreciate other bad buffets too  far worst buffet to    The floor grossly dirty  Pieces bread meat lingered all over  Parents letting kids roam free dropping ice cream strawberries  even saw kid pick booger before using same hand grab corn cob  Needless say lost hungry appetite FAST    The salad bar any better  lettuce cold temperature  dessert section mediocre plain peach cobblers  worth drive  Now worth wait  worth price  Just worth all  <EOR> Would believe sending negative review location manager well corporate reply!  Go Sizzler instead <EOR> Why always line door? Because 9 dollars AYCE lunch   and 'merica if you're coming expecting pristine food somewhere else  If want full bloated come right in   It's 2 steps Hometown Buffet Chinese buffets around area  liked variety  Salad Chinese food BBQ Mexican dessert bread section   I'm missing something   Italian!   I think called bourbon street chicken? that    Poke bunch strawberries marshmallows whatever stick before lather chocolate  People waiting chocolate fountain  <EOR> I'm sure but wow WASTE calories   What's interesting place three types rice Mexican Rice Rice Pilaf Fried Rice what's funny all rices taste same way soggy    Whats even more funny mac cheese tastes just rice  Whats ridiculous green beans no taste all  put over top meatloaf salad bar horrible    This place looks busy but really just much smaller space Hometown Buffet clientele seems lot bigger Hometown's  think saw good amount people being paid SDI being obese work    I'd rather hometown really hate place!    I visit again   <EOR> I hesitated week coming write review place let thoughts kind process  conclusion feel experience wasn't anything wow ed honest  heard place when opened but steered clear entire time because heard horror stories atrocious waits lines were   I came last Sunday lunch around 11 something line snaked outside door ending just outside shaded covering  wait continued inside registers would say total   the wait 45 mins so   I heard raves Golden Corral comparable Vegas buffet kicked Hometown Buffet's ass etc etc  felt crazy lines place brought when first opened and still even few months its opening place some sort majestic charm   To honest though felt fare offered alright  Definitely level Vegas buffet heard early although small things note   interior design faintly mimics those Paris Buffet maybe even Spice Market Buffet Planet Hollywood you know faux windows awnings separate stations buildings but  probably terms appearance  Now granted food wasn't bad anything even some small things Golden Corral better Hometown such corn which plump juicy overall food far better quality Hometown Buffet serves but nothing that'll blow away  However some special things such machine cotton candy coconut macaroons also steaks which cooked right front team chefs all small things bring higher end feel or Vegas feel Golden Corral   It's hard say whether coming back not  used love buffets much when kid but think growing come quite indifferent them  Even review feel something's missing disappointed but impressed either   just don't know  guess just kind person who'll want wait long line food anymore  Again nothing particularly bad place but again nothing particularly special  <EOR> Came soft opening  wasn't crowded  food good many option choose from  Only downside people took long line food  recommend going here  <EOR> I looking forward eating some time disappointed   lunch Monday 11am food descent best large variety choose can't complain there  some food very blan tasteless  most disappointed strawberries next chocolate fountain green sour  also rice crispys stuck together no apples anything else  Service great tables cleaned quick  surprised learn ask drink refills but wait staff quickly  As mentioned another review people frequent must say any buffet place really turn off your appetite  Coughing kids running around grabbing own foods loud large parties taking many tables food hoarders pilling hefty servings plate  Seems GC just putting many people small place   Probably return anytime soon screw those tempting commercials <EOR> Tara server excellent! She attentive polite  Made sure good drinks asked before taking plates  food good variety  only thing wait bit crowded  But all all good experience party six  Thank Tara!! <EOR> this place amazing! STEAK  RIBS  TILAPIA  ICE CREAM  FONDUE  COTTON CANDY  yummy  delish  more     the cons though?

Sheesh!  We paid lunch price $8 99 counting drinks if anything most food worth wait   LOVED Bourbon Chicken Sweet Sour Pork fried chicken liver grilled beef liver well garlic cheese bread   dessert bar also worth checking any place cotton candy chocolate fondue fountain dessert options stamp approval   The negative two stars size place feels very cramped being able fill your own drinks   Then again wait staff great job checking tables refilling your drinks Chinese buffets take note    Overall more options Hometown Buffet see why Golden Corral quite popular especially appears aren't many locations Cal    Worth going again    just maybe peak periods  <EOR> The line 8PM Friday night door!!! Comparing Hometown Buffet say Golden Corral half star better    really saying much though   both buffets pretty crappy but let's divulge into greater detail Golden    fried shrimp onion rings fish pretty decent   Looking through batter shrimp actually de veined!  pretty awesome buffet   fried fish typical southern type breading much find Boiling Crab   fish obviously wasn't fresh but tasted good enough shower tartar sauce  steak super high quality but does good charred off grill taste it   request any sort temperature depending supply grill   want say $12 dinner price eating just steak shrimp already bargain   same meal Sizzler's probably $12+   also tried some ribs fried chicken ham everything underwhelming   Most foods tastes typical cafeteria style mass produced sense flavor texture   sure I'd come back recommend buffet any REAL friends   hehehe <EOR> I enjoyed variety food quality gone down   kids only reason even entertain Golden Corral enjoy being able eat junk food no limits except mommy limit    usually catfish but wasn't impressed   steak well done when asked medium rare   fried chicken blah!  wasn't variety fruits   having variety salads probably best thing  Really much talk about   family restaurant long kids happy happy! <EOR> i opening day no wait  enjoyed visit  food good service price decent just don't soda cause gets you  Definitely lot better hometown BUT wouldn't want wait hour eat but think die down soon  its just half half 85degrees  now waits those establishments manageable  Will back once hype dies down aren't 50 people waiting outside eat everyday <EOR> I never set foot establishment again which sad because 4yo loves GC    After last visit June 7th came down food poisoning  spare details  Food poisoning awful everyone knows that  really sucks happened because hate eating buffets inside smokey casinos  Very disappointing  <EOR> The line door off curb but bad wait  12 Sunday ppl always leaving line moving pretty quickly 30 mins    The service good although server thought left cleared drinks all plates   new server just brought new drinks  cleared tables often    The food delish esp shrimp fish pan fried! back more 4 times!

LoL    Bottom line   I would back buffet joint  Nice    veddy nice     <EOR> I see hype all line door every single night since opened couple weeks ago   Going didn't think Corral would live expectations   Coming decided didn't returning   honest if choose I'd much rather take money over Hometown now less crowded starve    We arrived five minutes 6 line already door   waited good 20 minutes before made cash register   able take advantage 2 $20 special   promotion starts 4 pm Monday thru Thursday   third person pay regular price eh no big deal   seated fairly quickly paid     Food just okay maybe slightly better HTB but much   cotton candy machine brings nice touch dessert station but super sticky did bother it   Everything else overly sweet     Service just okay well   server forgot refill brother's soda she never bothered ask if needed refill water   think drink station should made accessible things easier all us     I can't say disappointed place didn't high expectations begin with   if attitude then you'll alright  <EOR> Like many other reviews saw commercials heard great things Golden Corral  today committed try out  When first pull restaurant day laborers relaxing under trees because Home Depot right there  No big deal  second walk hit realization just walked into lions den  Ghetto only word comes mind even fair understatement   Ratchet people everywhere   Then someone hasn't before fountain drink station before even talk anybody  asked cashier instructions  She said disposable fast food type plastic cups lids straw use reusable cloudy plastic cups    disposable solely because area uneasiness felt  end paying $25 some change wife I  seat yourself  Don't wait someone come seat table waiting long time  When asked cashier where straws she told waitress give them when sit down table    sure control people walking grabbing drink leaving without paying  Again very ghetto  start looking food pleasant surprise all food looked fresh rather good  start filling plates small portions everything offer  Everything wife ate actually very good  Surprisingly enough pizza really good extremely low expectations due quality pizza being served casino buffets  wife really enjoyed pot roast  ended having two plates small portions each everything except chicken fajitas awesome  Skip chicken fajitas    Trust me  Then move desert section favorite part  Everything looked extremely well plated delicious  some soft serve ice cream banana pudding piece white cake strawberry flavoring  Very good  All all food better every casino buffet opinion  am born raised Vegas eaten most if all casino buffets just don't compare  Why 3 stars? Solely because environment   cashiers all ratchets cooks ghetto heard cussing street talking behind cook line  Very unprofessional   If could pick entire building dump people transport say summerlin even little farther west would definitely back  If you're female suggest going yourself night  Wish would open another much better area would much better workers guests  When your business ghetto ghetto guests  <EOR> Let start silverware they're clean! Luckily packaged disposable forks knives spoons   I usually don't eat steak because dry burnt surprisingly cooked right liking no pink baby   probably highlight meal  freshly baked yeast rolls  yummy don't need extra butter mess up  Green beans  canned overcooked  fried chicken didn't enough flavor  shrimp much breading fountain drinks seemed last leg  now know why kids hate Brussel sprouts horrible!

Yes but much  <EOR> I came Golden Corral family Thursday night out the door line  still 15 minute wait until finally reached table   The Golden Corral offers tasty food very generous price  $15 all you can eat dinner drink  drink sweet tea which thought delicious   I really impressed quality food  price paid mostly everything tasted great! fried chicken really juicy steak mine ordered medium well   Everyone wants steak though prepared wait line it  lot variations chicken fried rotisserie BBQ teriyaki but only tried fried chicken which crispy fully flavor  BBQ pulled pork pretty good too  also liked mashed potatoes gravy  dessert course cotton candy! good very generous serving    As dislikes didn't care much Mac n cheese undercooked  corn seasoned well but slightly overcooked rather mushy already  tried pot roast still really dry despite being doused gravy  southern fried fish much salty    My biggest complaint would lack cleanliness facility  waitress very nice attentive but apron really gross  Something smeared across front crusted looked extremely unappetizing  Normally would embarrassed comment but really greatest start meal see that  Also lot trash crumbs scattered all over floor  want understanding them because place always reeeeally crowded but simply unacceptable taste  honestly made feel bit uncomfortable     Overall okay dining experience Golden Corral because food exceeded expectations but sure back very soon  <EOR> It ok considering fact pretty hungry   wait staff really nice considerate mention professional   All in all food good prices good also  <EOR> Food all cold told manager she just checked bottom food she told took food top cold did offer refund <EOR> Line ridiculous price ridiculous pick drink pay grab your food Soup planation better HYPE all about? <EOR> Everyone telling Golden corral try OMG don't think never again place nasty food good all!!! just ate some salad okay everything else good all   yelp saying opinion restaurant    save your money <EOR> It's nothing great but convenient grilled steak fresh fried chicken good fried drinks weren't free 2 00 small cup 2 49 large cup that  dessert white chocolate fundue chocolate fundue caramel fundue cotton candy ice cream otherwise bad but definitely busy server Steve awesome <EOR> My kids took fathers day     Very small Golden Corral others to   Waitress nice   Buffet  mess   Lots food floor   Lots kids running around without supervison   Lots food items empty    Pretty sad    LOT better buffet options Las Vegas   going back  <EOR> Food good  Love salad bar  Service could little better but back  couple different things buffet time when places change little bit  <EOR> Went yesterday 5 25 15 dinner   Man crowded!!!   They don't military discount *sad violin noises*   other GC's offer but doesn't   Just sucks cuz' there's military base right down road FRICKIN MEMORIAL DAY didn't even offer discount   Minus star     Have ever seen feeding time pig farm?  Where farmer pours slop bucket into trough pigs all clammoring it?   kinda except great food  Super duper crowded rough crowd      I best steaks ever yesterday!! inch thick perfectly cooked charred outside didn't even need knife cut it   good  Worth $12 alone  <EOR> that's right 5 stars   now BEFORE judging thinking only dined places where hafta pump your own ketchup understand saying ranks Nobu Ruth's Chris Chicago style anything   AM saying price CANNOT it!    I'll admit first considering passing idea because line door well buffet people  know type   but buffets always hold special place heart special occasions dad used take family all friends local spot when kid very nostalgic ever since   know gonna bone in cowboy steak cooked Pittsburgh style miso blackened cod but think always variety found appealing   and most modestly priced buffets  all is   very VERY average food looks should served nursing home crowd match   but place different   yes line but soon discovered why!  staff while constantly busy moving quickly surprisingly courteous   whomever asked question stopped doing very helpful   now real test food!  first plate consisted usual supsects mac 'n cheese good pizza meh fried chicken surprisingly good baked potato decent    overall pleased first round things didn't because cold like most buffets just didn't care recipe    thing place upside being packed food never sits long!  the second plate even better although extremely weary trying anything Asian buffet plated some teriyaki steak which turned very flavorful!  lo mein good even sweet 'n sour pork tasty!  skip fried rice though   another scary thing asked temp wanted steak   hold back scoff but when cut into surprised find true medium!  way GC!  then stumbled two favorites seasoned hush puppies jalapeno cornbread   became undoing   another round those piping hot crispy fried chicken DONE     pretty disappointed no room dessert good selection cakes pudding cookies really curious chocolate wonderfall but thankfully cotton candy didn't take much space   left feeling familiar post buffet shame but time least smile face   overall spent $15 person only incredible variety but GOOD food!  plus love broken down into stations the grill wok etc   less pretentious version Vegas   even cooks dressed preparing fresh produce salad station!  place above beyond did disappoint!  jalapeno corn bread steaks cooked order tempura battered onion rings 6 flavors ice cream buffet?  does that??  def back reinforcements! <EOR> Worst buffet experience Las Vegas  Worse old Surf Buffet old Sahara Buffet! place absolutely filthy least third tables bussed wiped  food terrible dry tasteless also most brightly lit restaurant ever to  loud wild children screaming running everywhere  left walked right employee looked then turned back without saying word  Wow! many good buffets Las Vegas understand why anyone would eat here! <EOR> I came lunch w folks Saturday morning 11 15 AM wasn't wait time seated immediately!  11 30 saw line outside I'd show early if wanna bypass wait   NOTE lot stuff during lunch limited but $8 bucks really couldn't complain   salad bar few empty trays missing lot fresh fruits veggies you'd probably during dinner   Additionally middle station only chefs grilling following meats 1 steaks 2 mini slider burgers 3 liver ran fish when    hoping could full sized burgers ribs something but nothing during lunch    steaks little salty tho     You other stuff Asian foods orange chicken some stir fry stuff fried rice etc general Mexican food enchiladas build your own tacos pizzas   desert section pretty nice w lots ice cream goodies cotton candy   Service good constantly refill your drinks stuff     I feel people buffet's automatically drop 15 IQ points revert back caveman status  freakin' zoo inside man  People try cut line just steak man some people bring 5 plates grab 5 steaks grill mob kids cutting just some cotton candy!  Crazy stuff down man     I'd come during dinner full experience     and full experience means dealing w 'herd' crazy people lol       But still    8 bucks cheap eats lol   I'd back haha   TIPS lunch specials $7 95 Monday Saturdays Check your utensils when eat  all them clean  Some desert bowls near ice cream machine dirty too  <EOR> $14 amazing buffet filled real grill huge salad bar Ice cream station fondue fountain fresh breads biscuits personal service carving stations huge variety ethnic stations choose your own drink before even reach cashier!  That talking about! Golden Corral league better Hometown Buffet while amazing some Buffets Vegas if aren't actually Vegas then next best thing  Extremely worth money especially coming friends family  Which only nitpick place small! seems always line door during any normal dining time every day  crowds leak into buffet sections kids run around all time  certainly place practice your plate fu attempt straddle dodge darting children roving chains people waiting fresh steak  <EOR> I Sunday dinner hour wait outside  price guess wait ok   But food surprising better expected       Here some stuff have     The salad bar usual goodies dressing  The Mexican section Enchiladas tacos nachos fajitas spanish rice few others  The American section Steak fried chicken grilled bbq chicken poached fish mac cheese corn bread few others  The Asian section noodles mandarin chicken couple more can't remember  Dessert bar Fruits cookies brownies pies ice cream chocolate fountain caramel fountain cotton candy   Highlight food better expected   Overall I'd probably come back but if starving lol <EOR> Long line = good food? Nope  don't know why people willing stand line long time eat place   why even line all?  even exactly cheap either   place really disgusting unappetizing   only ate because parents semi decent experience first time thought worth try   Horrible mistake    Atmosphere Tons people kids running everywhere  think being located next Speedzone Round One   place no where near being upscale anything   American self served buffet lacks aesthetic feature   Even dinnerwares horrible  dishes made porcelain but probably clay glazed outer layer   produces many visible scratches which look you're eating off something 99 cent store   bet some those glaze particles food well    Food Been Hometown Buffet before? food Golden Corral only slightly better but only just hair   offered bit more variety such steak buffalo wings popcorn chicken chocolate fondue cotton candy   Sounds appealing but good all   All food practically frozen food which reheated   To add more insult place found RAW shrimp popcorn shrimp! I uploaded photo page    already ate too!  only reason able find because outer bread shell cracked when stabbed fork   Imagine if hadn't   Also can't really complain since buffet individually served restaurant   Even if did probably wouldn't anything anyways    Service Slow service here   drinks finished first plate   mean we're asking much   think just common courtesy drinks right away when first tables   should first instinct   understand place gets pretty crowded might just forgotten   But still find bit unacceptable   wasn't expecting great service anyway since self served place all    I advise people eat if looking something decent eat   However if want stuffed then all means here   Just don't expect mind blown  <EOR> Awesome prices delicious food  Everything Great! Outstanding selections   Staff very nice attentive  <EOR> One few places eat where actually enjoy food  very picky eater really place  food good desserts feel good value   Update previous good review used true place  Unfortunately last two times very disappointing  much money mediocre food  <EOR> The buffet hit full chain food restaurant status  enjoyed some things hated others Many people come many people slobs! watched troves over weight families pounded gobbled all can  Many letting kids run around control until manager came over loud speaker announced all children under 10 needed adult supervision all times! Clap yeah hooray! The prices pretty decent place watch drinks add bill Many food choices tried several items  Meatloaf good Chicken so so spaghetti average as all sides all good too!  deserts aimed more kids but some good pie ice cream  The set little strange seating areas cramped   most employees nice helpful couple seemed upset all mess deal with  Expect lines dinner times weekends  see myself coming maybe 2 times year OK that! <EOR> All say lot better Hometown Buffet  fact yu see your food while being made bit refreshing  least know where your food coming from  Downside food tends disappear soon its put under heat lamp  Also line reminds Disneyland  bad enough line outside but also zig zags indoors  paid around $11 meal because added drink lunch  Other line disappearing food food pretty tasty  suggest getting sliders fried chicken  Also never wrong chocolate fountain  Never  <EOR> I don't know why decided put Vegas' first Golden Corral east side more importantly right next Home Depot  guess thought buffet food home improvement well together?  Anyways place always crowded family children  mean most buffets pretty loud but if you're looking stay away mass amount children then try here   The food alright  your basic buffet food nothing really sticks out  your salads soup Chinese American etc  did enjoy pasta here  bland liking  only good thing steak  asked medium well came back medium well lot juice it  dessert section mainly targeted candy M Ms gummy worms  chocolate fondue fountain but stayed clear because area bit messy liking   The part grossed most though workers cleaning food section same towel  see them cleaning section where sauce pasta spilled next thing he's over cleaning Asian section SAME towel smearing food across  just doesn't seem sanitary me   You try place just off your bucket list but don't expect much  <EOR> Worst place ever   feel homeless shelter  don't try sound rude person but opinion place   Food no taste it   Service bad  <EOR> We lunch Friday waited 20 30min line   Too bad don't serve steak seafood lunch other foods just ok I'd give 1 more star if when come back next time several months won't wait half hour line   lunch would rather Asia Buffet Souplantation even Hometown  Chinese station       skipped because read reviews yelp plus does look shady Italian pizza station lasagna good corn good n sweet       cheese macaroni coated half melted cheese looks nasty! Grill station love BBQ chicken legs! very tender      pork chop salty      mini cheese burger pattie way dry over grilled smoked Desert cotton candy ice cream but overall all deserts kind low cheap quality deserts pies puddings cheap cake   hoping see some good variety deserts creme brulete puff cheesecake even just cookies muffins but none any above!!! But price range guess it  <EOR> The wait crazy times but all all food price worth it  couldn't enough Steak which surprise seeing buffet  shrimp so so but no real complaints  teriyaki  chicken great managed incredible salad salad bar offer little creativity  plenty deserts choose gotta give place credit before forget military discount   Knowaboutit <EOR> ummm   eff    does place such high rating? Did live expectations  failed badly  So reading peoples reviews before here  pretty excited some steak watch them cook front me  But guess what?? no where found!l told some friends Golden Corral did any steak response then whats point going golden corral  Lesson learned  ask people leaving if steaks  rest food even good  Lacks flavor   Service alright   Will back? Maybe  might just hometown buffet souplantation next time  <EOR> Golden Corral did disappoint!  delicious fresh quality food beats Hometown Buffet any other buffets around town hands down!  dining area features open kitchen where see chefs prep cooks hard work   food selection vast never expected great buffet experience here   thought only great buffets existed Vegas but Golden Corral proved wrong!    The wait times long but definitely worth it   I'd recommend going around 1 30 2 30pm when lunchtime rush over  <EOR> felt big kids candy store  But still lots little kids running around  place only open 3 weeks its still really crowded  Came Friday night later dinner 9 wait 30 minutes line  honestly expected more place    dishes but still better hometown  Especially dessert section  red velvet cupcakes chocolate fountain real ice cream and frozen yogurt machine rice krispies gummy bears annnnd more  little asian section taco bar but did try those  Mostly pigged steak seafood pasta section southern goodies course dessert  <EOR> very busy place   sure check your plate see if clean   4 dirty plates still some food left them <EOR> If  enjoy massive quantities mediocre substandard food nonexistent service place   am torn between two stars but give them two   place just opened cleaner Hometown Buffet     I hated fat dried steak required wait line bad popcorn shrimp tough fried fish   fried chicken barbeque chicken rotisserie chicken blah but edible   Some food mislabeled     Dessert selection poor few choices buffet restaurant   Staff appeared somewhat disorganized   arrived early but wait long line   waiter took forever pick used plates   sometimes find wise bus own plates   We drinks before paying which really slows line down   pay extra $1 99 drink even more drink go   charge $5 per pound if chose take out   Pretty amazing just sit watch people stuff themselves but pass next time  <EOR> Just quick update review below My friend tells first only other Golden Corral restaurant fond memories Corpus Christi TX relocated awhile back menu changed new move     He doesn't food all new Corpus Christi location no longer brings people there   His experience NEW location matches Las Vegas location appears isn't isolated incident operation probably changed nationwide  <EOR> Please don't ever come here! If love your family eat place  First things first walking horrible smell  smells inside nursing home  No lie  Secondly person coming around taking your dirty plates sit your table while way your food  Third ghetto which would okay if good food customer service which not  Inside gives feel fight break end world star any moment  last but least when finished eating sitting talking never come again see workers cleaning Buffett area putting all food drops around sides BACK OTHER FOOD  am traumatized <EOR> I am fan place  Sure best  buffet Las Vegas but better affordable ones imho  wouldn't run every opportunity but if don't want cook dinner can't agree want eat would come before another affordable buffet   What am fan of *it affordable  *food taste better local stations casinos  *yeast rolls AMAZING * food always fresh  think due busy are  keep putting new product  *cotton candy     What am fan busy is  *long lines although move fast *yes cosign everyone else entrance horrible  just doesn't work busy are  <EOR> Yo Golden Corral nothing personal but don't live hype  Being vegas resident seeing tons commercials expecting flavor explosion mouth would unlike first time heard Beatles  The food isn't bad but nothing would drive 20 minutes come here  really appreciate little things such dessert fountain believe mobbing down mashed potatoes  give 3 stars because feel its exactly appears owns it  need quick but filling meal want breakfast buffet  If everyone mood something different then all works out  only thing works against them Vegas filled buffets stand less graded lot harsher  servers usually pretty nice but course few crappy ones  Overall its very consistent restaurant don't many qualms with  Come eat then continue on <EOR> It cost way much food awful place empty dinner hour  Everything deep fried ham processed different types shrimp but all deep fried much shrimp eat way much breading  I asked where lemons when found them frozen stuck bottom container which shows long time  only water waiter wanted tip glass tap water faucet even filtered  I looked butter but only margarine finally leave found butter plastic tubs  The only good food Grandma's mashed potatoes but gravy canned  Everything can  The green beans canned burnt microwave  The cutlery bent place overly cold  The selection food limited  If don't someone tell them good place eat  <EOR> GROSS  NEVER EVER come back again!! back Hometown Buffet people seriously don't even Hometown much! <EOR> Awesome buffet place! Most food fresh delicious The best fried chicken bourbon street chicken friend rice unlimited steaks salad bar mexican beans rice!  Service just fine  could improve rushing patrons finish meals fast clean tables without notice   Price ok  Drinks should included $12 99 dinner deal   Only con Long lines sundays between 12pm 3 pm wait time seated could between 15 min 30 min Overall buffet hits spot  Forget Hometown buffet once try place  wish more locations other areas  <EOR> Make sure your ass stand hour just in  <EOR> This first time  family party 7 first crowded line door  felt cattle barn  Once closer saw another line inside loud hectic  Needless say line somewhere else  Didnt want spend Friday night Zoo <EOR> Not worth 30 2 people  Place kinda dirty  mean sat next vacuum across restroom  mention directly Under ac freezing food getting cold  <EOR> First time   bad  But good either  Sunday paid extra cause Sunday menu  Advertised ribs breaded shrimp  Manager said location diff tv  steak good  Waitress friendly always available fill drink  Over all ok  Don't think back  <EOR> Food good  Service terrible  group three arrived 4 10 Tuesday  disabled person and two others   group volunteered wait line while other person helped park inside  no disabled  accommodations   person line going buy dinners all three but rudely told he could only buy own meal because other two people party line   forced wait line because policy  would explain policy offer any suggestions  This  vegas fortunately competition casinos offers cheaper prices much better service guests  suggest retired disabled persons just patronize place  won't back sure <EOR>
