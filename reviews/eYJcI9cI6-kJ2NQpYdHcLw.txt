Can't wait back! <EOR> This kinda late post but would everyone know come any holidays if think might busy  fiancé came Valentine's Day brunch seems don't know manage when busy  actually patient whole situation  When checked host said 45 min hr wait which understood since Valentine's Day  put name number contact when turn  hr passed check status said tables ready yet  decided wait near restaurant saw few tables no sitting didn't seat anyone while  saw waiting show no sense urgency all which ruin whole experience where didn't leave any tip  Never coming back again  <EOR> The spot escape summer heat while Container Park    I've come handful times slowly becoming main haunt when neck woods  food fresh cocktails delicious view isn't shabby either  Because basically insulated box A C stays keeps place feeling cool comfortable   My last visit sitting bar enjoying beer during business meeting started fried calamari share chose The Egg lunch  fried calamari great starter your basic calamari light breading but sauce pop order extra because stuff fast  The Egg hearty salad fill any empty feeling might reading word salad menu  poached egg butter lettuce frisee lettuce bacon croutons Sherry Vinaigrette  great lunch option won't leave feeling heavy tired butter lettuce different something don't see most salads  Plus doesn't poached egg bacon salad!   PRO TIP Happy Hour best way break your Perch cherry  Two dollars off cocktails five dollar beer wine offered  <EOR> We came summer afternoon Container Park  only couple other people place felt pretty empty even though place itself relatively small  nice vibrant atmosphere natural lights clean minimal style  service just okay but wouldn't look much into it  Outlets also available even saw guy laptop bar    The food bit overpriced opinion but delicious  salmon top bed asparagus brussel sprouts which loved  asked wanted salmon cooked which never heard before  veggies cooked perfectly  also bianca flatbread start  perfect appetizer two even small meal someone isn't hungry  boyfriend chopped salad added grilled shrimp top  only couple pieces shrimp shouldn't really warrant $6 charge  salad itself very good  dill dressing best he's ever apples mangos perfect additions  If he didn't order overpriced shrimp he said he would consider best quality salad considering price only $10   Overall would recommend place anyone couple dollars spend while downtown Container Park  fills nicely without leaving full where can't explore adventures downtown  <EOR> We didn't try food but enjoyed atmosphere Sunday evening when explored container park dinner  hardly anyone area think it'd lot more fun when more people around but space itself cool bartender Perch friendly made great drinks  sat patio area played Heads enjoyed cooler weather since sun finally gone down  <EOR> Great bar service! girlfriend catch bartender Nora doll!

Yup  me  F Pigalle closed Monday pitched Perch thinking would great time    made reservation weeks ahead time confirmed morning all going well    evening unraveled just immediately  table ready yay zero wait right time  But then time came figure taking care when person would appearance   Guess 14 people day full meetings want right away? Ding ding ding  won't into boring details but 55 minutes time sat down until every member party drink  No joke  Almost hour  time first served yep done drinks  couldn't even kick off evening toast  handcrafted cocktails but possible staff more bartender considering three weeks advance notice?     drink fiasco dragged hour put such damper everyone's mood even sure anyone paid much attention food  tried calimari say delicious veggie burger tasty but fries super lame  inconsistent plate plate couldn't really tell should taste like  Mine golden brown over fried dry appetizer ones thick soggy  bizarre   I say dreaded food coming dragged drinks but actually very well timed coordinated   Anyway think Perch might well suited smaller parties but would consider other options larger ones  <EOR> Fantastic location perched atop downtown container park   Food service ambiance all excellent   Loved shrimp pasta Sriracha cream sauce   cheesecake incredible too   Highly recommend if looking something memorable off strip  <EOR> Just put things into perspective  got 11 30am just food 1 40am  even good  server forgot put items currently waiting 1 more dish  never experienced something this?
