 think icing cake last experience  DOUBLE charged bill when called server's attention he shrugged shoulders walked away   Yes heard it   no sorry no apology no good day  appalled  You better believe checking credit card statement see if he actually credited bill  attitude almost felt if busted scam  Thankfully compared bill others split else might caught  hope management gets together teaches basic customer service skills employees  being said give another honest try some point  <EOR> Just finished dinner Mother's Day  great experience! party four seated slightly before reservation time despite packed house line extending door    Our drink order taken right away promptly delivered  Appetizers also quickly served delicious     The entrees tasted great freshly made  Desert excellent well  Various staff members pitched seamlessly made pleasing dining experience us    I've couple bad experiences location before looking something fault  couldn't find thing  management team team certainly done best here     Special kudos server Ruth cheery attitude prompt courteous service high tolerance sarcasm  shout Bob too  <EOR> A fun place even if chain restaurant! decor inviting nice servers always helpful menu  happy hour killer  PBR's $2 00 sake $3 00  lettuce wraps tempura green beans great  If want close home fun spot  PF Chang's always list <EOR> Considering party 16 reservation did great job   very happy orange ginger edamame crab wontons kaleidoscope roll  All very delicious would order again  Plus despite having check split didn't add gratuity in  would happily eat again  <EOR> I've eaten only twice first time don't remember ate but remember thinking bit overpriced  The second time came best friend brought me  She gift certificate she wanted use late dinner I'm talking hour before close late   decided special two people two soups two starters two entrees your choice two desserts shareable dessert  She ordered Orange Peel Chicken main dish Orange Peel Shrimp   The Shrimp very tasty little kick it  shared some spring rolls house sauces separate desserts  The down side desserts little shot glasses full cake  wasn't much  should asked shareable would bigger  The staff very nice considering pretty late overall food alright  <EOR> My husband decided dinner P F  Chang's literally sat booth 13 minutes before anyone came over table acknowledged presence restaurant  walked over hostess podium 10 minutes being ignored  usually come P F  Chang's regular basis because live just down road never experienced such poor customer service  All hope food tastes good because almost walked utter rejection mode <EOR> We stopped lunch because running special launching new menu item Hokkein Street Noodles  many choices Vegas need incentive try something new  checked first waiter define entrees would qualify free deal told could order lunch special regular entree even specialty salads  hubby ordered Honey Shrimp lunch deal side egg roll    Lunch served promptly  noodle dish made rice noodles also requested more chicken instead shrimp  lots veggies ample chicken  tasty but likely order again because salty me  lunch special tiny tiny  husband fully satisfied even sampling dish too  hard feel lunch worthwhile town going buffets especially loyalty cards 2 1  probably won't back awhile  <EOR> Service good food bad  sesame chicken honey chicken good  fond orange chicken  Quinoa delicious but don't understand charging $2 00 extra small bowl  4 years since won't hurrying back  <EOR> I find P F  Chang's way overpriced  If prices cheaper I'd give them four stars because enjoy ambience find comfortable place hang friends believe entrees appetizers interesting flavorful   liked going during happy hour few friends where lot fun never felt rushed  thought appetizers tasty friends liked drinks bar     don't  mind paying quality but don't think offerings worth prices charge won't coming often most time it'll happy hour friends  <EOR> Good food terrible waiter  waiter seemed very annoyed start  He never replied when said thank taking orders bringing drinks etc  When he brought to go boxes he knocked water over onto party's laps  He apologized but then avoided table rest night  He even different waiter handle check  When spoke manager Chris he assured he would handle it   only reason 2 star versus 1 star  <EOR> So 10 pm when walked seated probably why service great seeing other others say service horrible  Amazingly location open til midnight!
