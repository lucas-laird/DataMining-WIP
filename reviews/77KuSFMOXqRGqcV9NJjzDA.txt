My cousin decided restaurant birthday  plans and only based decision yelp reviews would opted different restaurant    However am happy went  food very delicious  fried pork chops great! sides rice gravy hard mess greens nothing families home cooked greens but okay   Later cousin commented only fried food breakfast food good  Everything else less pleasing she little more harsh     The service slow they understaffed   waitress very nice  tasting fried pork chops felt worth wait    I would try place again  <EOR> The fried chicken good first but couldn't find side didn't taste stale canned  really wanted place going try again however food left bad taste mouth  almost seemed food cooked old oil  positive side order still steaming hot when home  <EOR> Food piping hot which great!! buffet   and truly all eat!! order whatever want off menu except chitlins bring you!!! Mac n cheese greens black eyed peas pretty good!! Fried chicken pretty good too! come back!! <EOR> Stopped Sunday told only menu available all eat $16 99 per person   Really??? would rather turn down business if less?  Does good business sense which why glad chose stay  only imagine everything would like   Definitely won't 2nd chance first impression  bigger better things! <EOR> Food sucked unfortunately   hate say because love supporting small black owned businesses   loud singing nauseating   think just loud and unnecessary such small place   Also singer lovely voice hides behind wall can't even see which loud singing even more annoying some reason   Customer service over top   tried hard annoying   Every few minutes approached table   hard enjoy conversation as talked bad food without being interrupted   serving plates bowls cheap presentation food off   This few months ago close grand opening may improved   would give them another try because trial error important long willing listen reviews improve   potential because items mentioned review mostly great attempts gone wrong   point trying hard gotta give them second shot    right?  I edit review try them again     soon  <EOR> A friend all eat breakfast Dirty South past weekend  Everything prepared order tasted great  price under $10 breakfast  back bringing friends   This very casual place wait staff attentive friendly  <EOR> We all could eat dinner  wait between each entree 25 30 min time want eat anymore   The sides cold when first brought us  Everything sweet potato salad beans   The ribs best part did fall off bone   The service friendly but very lackadaisical  inside temperature very uncomfortable sweating because hot  eating utensils need upgrade very cheap  good experience all  place does potential but needs lot  work whole  <EOR>
