Yeah sure  kind taste deadening corner cutting smoke mirrors crap people expect Taco Bell but place this  really disappointing being first dish rather disheartening first impression too  read people's reviews where talk steamy  fresh but steam artificial fresh appearance completely false  least anyone clever enough understand unless time things unnaturally well no cake likely ever served steaming fresh restaurant is  Considering good legitimately fresh rest food approach really REALLY baffles me  Trust guys your cake would much better if a cooked several batches day b just left room temperature honest  Microwaving your food flat out insulting your business your customers  thoroughly enjoyed both meals but wouldn't step cake again  Really disgusting bullshit! together!  Beyond everything else tasted fantastic thus 4 stars ! simply detest eggs order meals without  Yesterday Mexican skillet boy howdy great! chorizo salsa awesome compliment already phenomenal potatoes  see myself having same dish again quite soon  Today country fried steak honestly best ever eaten  steak tender juicy breading crisp well seasoned  Really really good stuff  also having again soon  wife biscuits gravy which she said really good but quite way she likes them  Then again she apparently particular bar set quite high when she younger  She also huevos rancheros which she said excellent    Also both days staff quite friendly helpful though wish people servers would understand water doesn't mean water lemon   know apparently standard practice many restaurants but personally think if someone orders just water should probably ask if want strong flavored fruit wedge submerged before just automatically adding it  Maybe  just but much every other single aspect dining experiences If don't specifically ask something want it  Simple enough?  With all being said really isn't any question being repeat customers here  some problems but staff pretty friendly most food absolutely phenomenal  <EOR> I love place good sit down breakfast friends if fresh cupcake like texture frosted coffee cake    They're kind enough first course time you've devoured down your ample portioned meal ordered ready   Seriously two people could split omelette scramble peachy     But sure order two coffee cakes don't break relationship that! <EOR> Food Cracked Egg always excellent!
