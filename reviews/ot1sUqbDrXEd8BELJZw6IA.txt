Fortunately two three items plate weren't bad  agree Meat Loaf's philosophy two three ain't bad  Then again ain't great      bill came $8 12 before tip  paying bill left opinion JC Cuisine average Chinese restaurant  <EOR> First off food taking over hour even though site says 20 30 minutes  place only 9 minutes where we're staying ridiculous  We're starving!! If want your food timely manner then order here  update once food finally arrives  currently 11 55pm  ordered 10 30pm   <EOR> I really enjoyed food  think favorite part serving size huge portions   should advertise portions meant multiple people  Oh man  Thought could order mapo tofu some pork fried rice California Roll side wrong  Would definitely eat again if still around when come back  <EOR> If your looking place quick service great food great price then try place out    started hot sour soup which very big portion   Uncle shared bowl two serving each us   Chicken chop suey which excellent lots veggies chicken   Portions good size may need take box enjoy later   Also saw served sushi next time Im town gonna try out!  Keep good work! <EOR> Worst Chinese food long time  First took over 2 hours delivery 2 miles Sunday afternoon  All food cold!! don't mean luke warm cold! Chow Fun soggy miserable mess flavorless ?
