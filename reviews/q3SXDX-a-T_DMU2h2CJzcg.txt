Edit looking online researching more big hot dog should now know sure ripped off  put smaller dogs jumbo bun passed off jumbo gave store bought dog  Whatever case fine giving bad review  fact business such tried pull bait switch play fool while taking money cannot let without writing review warning others  Straight bad business model  <EOR> Never Complaint Burger Joint Super Service  love Burgers Half Half Orders Onion Rings Fries Nacho Cheese  always Orleans Hotel Casino!!! YUP!! <EOR> Burgers we're mediocre nothing special  could made  better burger home probably  Cost $27 2 burger combos  could fed 4 people n same price lot happier  Only plus place put your own vegetable toppings vegi bar  Also iced tea awful !

Then place need! tried quarter pounder cheeseburger chili cheese fries  covered thickest pieces cheddar swiss provolone cheese ever seen  buns slight sweetness pretty dense  would want guess almost tastes brioche bun  meat juicy seasoned salt pepper  Fuddruckers just doesn't hit spot night gluttony punches spot  <EOR> This first time ate Fuddruckers pleased quality food   Pros *Food Tastes good *Time reasonable  *Choose your own condiments  *Good customer service   Cons *It did look clean *The tomatoes looked sat long time *Its expensive amount food received  I read lot reviews Foodruckers did look good  look lot customers  would personally come back but its expensive  <EOR> Giving 1 star cus cant give negative star  Reason being cook called order towards friends across floor saying Order up! Two homos! double take cus pretty shocked heard but he said 2nd time sure heard he said  When friend came cook telling friend he referencing 2 guys waiting orders before mine  two guys definitely heard yell 2 homos walked away sec  felt super uncomfortable myself offended would've walked away since food wasn't didn't want side spit  cool  What's bad everyone heard yell out    I think ppl sbarros heard him    always thought customer service poor but tonight worse customer  service ever experienced    Onto food    expensive mediocre  Just n save yourself money better customer service   PS  ordered specialty burger which sure takes min prepare  come food before 2 guys theirs? Little did he know gay myself  <EOR> My hubby stopped quick lunch since staying Orleans hotel  Overall bad price  came when slow food came quick  see condiment area would become quickly crowded  chicken sandwich good size bun  bad stop  <EOR> Inside Orleans Hotel Casino food court  Open 24hrs   I work inside casino always nice great hamburger pick breakfast right work   Breakfast served 2am 11am   Tips menu changed slightly  Some people said special hamburgers elk ostrich gone price   It also hectic during special arena events lines bad   Some days lot close few hours big cleaning times   Service always good   Free beverage refills also coffee refills when breakfast combos  <EOR> Saturday night 6 16 2 employees very impressive everything made fresh order no waited food more 6 7 minutes Simply remarkable!!!! <EOR> Oh stay clear Fuddruckers   My son happened stop evening waiting 18 minutes order which asked manager handed boxes wrap meal ourselves     cheeseburger frings 1 2 fries 1 2 onion rings macaroni cheese $15 37 should carried meal car us  staff very pleasant single apology wait know back especially when come close having sit down dinner price  <EOR> I few weeks ago lady took order DENE horrible    not only did she give wrong change but terrible attitude also put order wrong mention looked if she hungover If could give negative star would   what horrible representation place <EOR> Oh goodness can't believe never tried FUDDRUCKERS before!  My family starving when arrived New Orleans decided check food court  ended trying Fuddruckers which probably best choice could made  We ordered basic 1 3 cheeseburgers fries onion rings  gave beeper mange service  service actually pretty quick given demand during time day  don't customize burgers besides meat rare medium well instead salad bar available customers  salad bar consisted red white onions lettuce tomatoes pickles relish mayo ketchup mustard  only problem setup other people opportunity touch produce  also made hard build burger many people waiting behind me  positive note did save time confusing staff complex request did keep produce well stocked fresh   The burger awesome flavorful juicy  fries well seasoned but little chunky liking thick cut   onion rings crispy good way!  Overall I would love come back definitely find location near because say bucket beers which sounds good time friends  <EOR> Go elsewhere!! employees slow retarded  People came way food first  Even buzzer off food ready because ended giving someone else!!! <EOR> Went super toy con yesterday Orleans arena  Decided eat quick lunch could back quickly  much quick    I ordered Napa valley salad husband ordered chicken salad  EVERYONE around getting food  husband check told when your pager off your food ready  Duh know that    So finally waiting 30 MINUTES  30 freaking minutes 2 salads  chick back yells CHICKEN STILL PINK  Wtf doing long  finally ready delicious food  But no reason should taken long  <EOR> They opened new Fuddruckers Orleans food court!

Boca burger heated microwave   The seating? casino really none other plastic chairs manage wrangle away teenagers   The time wait your food joke especially when NO else around  would understand if juicy homemade patty thick full really good seasonings  But no  time wait time takes thaw cooked  kid yourself into thinking hand forming your food back there   The only redeeming quality place all take condiments bar but even sullied fact total free all even monitored! want tomato slices man front fingered tongs threw into food  Ew  kids? Don't even think do  cringe  idea really but cannot just left off side where no making sure food being replenished untainted  <EOR> Fuddruckers worlds greatest hamburgers    Yeah sorry even close   I ordered works burger 1 2lb variety egg   So burger bacon cheese mushrooms egg   Somehow manged put mushrooms burger quick trip counter side mushrooms given ok real issue crap happens   So burger yeah guess ok nothing amazing Fatburgers world certainly no The Worlds greatest burger any means   Is worth going your way really but if wouldn't say don't hence 3 stars nothing wrong nothing great it  <EOR> With celebrity chefs falling all over another open burger concept restaurants may surprising casino food court counter service burger would rate highly   But Fuddy's as brothers called growing remains burger go tos along In N Out course  far superior conceptually similar Fatburger   The housemade buns stand well meat biggest beef lot boutique burger places no pun intended grease burger soaks through bun rendering whole thing sloppy mess  But take home eat intact burger if choose to   They offer meats ostrich elk wild boar etc  adventurous but always wondered sold enough keep fresh supply hand  just stick beef     Although potato wedges must  Sometimes just order wedges smother them cheese pico shredded lettuce jalapenos voila nacho fries!

Their mini breakfast sliders actually pretty good! When you're headed mornings whatever occasion may grab sliders go  come steaming hot fresh hit spot We egg cheese sausage sliders   takes couple minutes cooks but well worth it  didn't anything else though  Strictly breakfast review here  early morning crew nice also  think place 24 hours if remember cashier since 3am! <EOR> first time ate loved it! ate twice during lv stay first time bison burger next time believe elk burger delicious staff very helpful! <EOR> One worst customer service ever had  understand busy due viva Las Vegas but watch 5 people behind food first  hour late finally food over done dry  Tried let someone know but ignored numerous times  husband eat food poisoning  3 days he couldn't hold anything down even look food  never visit again recommend anyone  <EOR> Fresh baked buns fresh cut fires fresh meat multiple choices meat buffalo ostrich etc fresh produce pick your burger  place puts other fast food restaurant's shame! <EOR> I love some Fuddruckers    They some really great protein options there's literally something everyone  usually fan serving myself but enjoy having ability add all condiments want onto own burger  usually stock pickles cheese dip  They're both delicious  together mind you   I usually order specialty burgers share onion rings wedges dining companion  usually plenty even hungriest burger lovers  Order milkshake part your combo well  They're great!
