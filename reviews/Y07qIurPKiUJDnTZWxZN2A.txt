Granted January 1st but medium sized line moved glacial pace  wait nearly 30 40 minutes seated   Second observation pretty average buffet  old adage pay definitely rang true  Bistro Buffet everything would expect buffet salad bar soups Asian food Mexican food Southern food seafood mini desserts  Nearly all options average best  But hey average tastes lot better when super affordable   Third observation server doing awesome job  most buffets I'd satisfied if server stopped more once check us  server Hicela sp? welcomed right seated  She already brought water mimosas  During meal she stopped least three times sure everything alright    I would definitely consider returning buffet  <EOR> Stay away  Choices minimal  Food tasteless price Sunday brunch way high offered Help overtaxed dishes remain table  Try  second cup o coffee  not <EOR> Been many time before  good enough leave full without breaking bank but recently noticed options dropped off  less seafood options before    With Maloof family no longer owning place change noticeable patrons  place used mix local elders young people didn't onto strip    The food quality always remained good same service   great easily comped meals    If pay eat still worth t ever line  He seating spaced well enough where didn't feel cramped part another party    Their brunch good better Gold Coast but bit pricier too    If you're hungry few bucks spend place you  <EOR> The Feast buffet Red Rock blows place water!  same price lunch $8 99 players card good two people  buffet each adult own card   At first place looked promising  Smelled really good outside buffet many seafood dishes meat galore lots dishes  Then trying few dishes found many them overcooked  tons seafood dishes but every dish mussels squid   The Thai curries good first but few bites salty!  Carving station hit miss  tri tip actually very good according bf  turkey cold  pork belly dry crispy skin cold hard   The salad bar didn't cottage cheese beets two favorites salad   fruit bowl never replenished whole time there  All watermelon gone most honey dew  But whole bunch cantelope left which proves gross  wild rice salad totally undercooked  hard spit out  steamed veggies American section bland  Just plain steamed frozen looking veggies  Those type veggies kids hate eating veggies!  Another thing didn't several condiments aren't placed near dish for  example horseradish tartar sauce hidden next salad dressings  some sauces next dishes possible just don't it   Jook rice congee stewed pork belly eggs lukewarm due heating element far below pot  Plus pork belly wasn't tender  better home   I also hated wrote dishes' name glass marker  orangey pink color very hard read thus made hold line   Plus made hard distinguish which name platter  bunch stuff wasn't even labeled  fried thing seafood section not labeled turned deep fried pork belly  What? Yuck!  Now good did enjoy kalbi ribs if love worth it   tad sweet but great good sour kim chi but totally tender enough cut butter knife  roasted whole garlic cloves grilled veggies platter fantastic  Also seconds creamed corn  If best dish buffet creamed corn know you're trouble   $8 buffet lunch bad but same price Red Rock much better!

heck serves crab particular weekday? Weird  Also pay 2 bucks per person tax  Again huh? used Groupon voucher before other restaurants don't remember ever having pay sales tax because usually already included voucher price   As usual any time buffet grab plate little scoping around  Some things looked ok  came back couple slices ummm well done rare prime rib? Let explain  outer part meat well done actually crispy  inner part blood red  think happened cooked really high temperature looked done outside  don't think even bothered use meat thermometer  If refer pic description 100 percent accurate  Im carnivore did poor peace meat pure travesty  Only bright spot outer crispy part mainly seasoned fat which surprisingly good because raw meat does any flavor  no did try eat super red bloody middle part  Well maybe little bit outer part next medium rare  Still no flavor    Wow  cant believe just wasted whole paragraph improperly cooked prime rib  other news also tried some Chinese items Kung Pao Chicken Chinese Spare Ribs  all tasted same  Dry rubbery  pork spare ribs which looked gave hope but turned rest only time tried smother barbeque sauce  imagine barbeque flavored chewing gum  some bacon mac n cheese separate little bowl which thought kind cute  Only problem called bacon part just couple sprinkles imitation bacon bits  cheese sauce itself watery when dipped your spoon towards bottom  elbow macaroni surprisingly cooked all way through   For those aren't familiar Mongolian style cooking basically vegetables seasoning together bowl  Then give cook tell them type meat want cooked round table type grill  put garlic some chili seasoning but still could any flavor first bite   Dessert? Maybe should called deserted because looks employees just threw some cream sugar together put display  play safe crme brulee  Its basically flan top glazed torch  Unfortunately top part only part cooked  soon stuck spoons into very watery didn't any kind consistency all through out   The bright spot experience server Rosa excellent  She consistently filled sodas took plates mostly uneaten food away  thinking she going say something wasted food but think now she used seeing people even try finish plates  gave 10 dollar tip because only did she give good service felt bad having deal cleaning all bad food nightly basis   In end only things worth mentioning didn't disappoint crispy seasoned fat renderings prime rib diet cokes which surprised flat all way things going  only thing think would worth price paid would if alcoholic then all drink wine beer would right down your alley  don't drink im really sure if getting wasted buffet something special  Bottom line DONT RECOMMEND EATING EVEN IF FREE!

Sign up! wish could say delicious affordable   There few dishes downright fantastic BBQ Pork Ribs mouthwatering delicious Dijon Meatballs quite tasty well  But overall everything seemed little salty little dry little tough  shame since last year before yelper would raved down hidden gem apparently things change always better   The service less prompt but when did arrive kind  wasn't expecting much  drink selection good including beer wine again great bargain!  Overall wasn't terrible experience least but    I probably wont visit again unless staying Palms broke hungover  <EOR> So purchased Groupon deal which see others did also its even worth price  pretty much paid full price 2 people instead 2 1since Wednesday billboard marked $20  advertising misleading showed steaks crab legs which didn't see inside pretty much all food bland very dry like prime rib   told steaks every day except day showed up  Now Groupon deal mentioned beer and or wine 2 1 drink bar 2 free entry passes ghostbar no mentioned give anything  service wasn't all great either  leaving 2 chicago tourists said worst buffet ever  Very disapointing    <EOR> I'm happy some updated selections Bistro Buffet   first visit long time little upset because saw Kalbi Ox tail different Thai curries but no white rice! thought tease!  can't eat any stuff without white rice  second visit found white rice big silver pot near curry  finally nerve try curry excellent!  just enough spice texture nice  also station where customize your own chow mien    The dessert always tasty still is!

Asian selection typical asian dishes  tried orange chicken  least tasted better Panda Express     Potsticker alright  stuffing not even sure inside just ok     lot fried food section  Bottom line asian person think noodles best thing there   Pizza 3 different types pizza pepperoni mushroom cheese   tried cheese  decent  Looking three types see lacked toppings though   Thai good variety curry  tried yellow shrimp curry because most worth it  Basically lot peeled shrimp curry  would recommend getting this   Tri tip Pork belly sure ask carver good side  meat rare  very good meat taste loads juice  good      Pork belly better though  Although very fatty skin crunchy meat moist    Mongolian section pretty good because create your own noodle whatever veggies choice three meats chicken pork beef   even though super full give try  stir fried noodle added onion mushroom bean sprout chicken spoonfuls garlic  chef cooked front me  final product smelled good  probably due amount garlic put  Bottom line try section  add however amount want no lose here   Finally move desert  Tiramisu small which perfect size  it  sweet but overly sweet  Lastly also flan  also small but perfect size  flan tasted similar creme brulee    In conclusion just OK buffet  Nothing die for  But price paid $8 well worth selection  If pay full price I'd 50 50 coming here  Overall Palms pretty off strip would wanna off strip come here? But guess if stay around isn't bad place  would give place 3 star BUT because unlimited red wine chardonnay beer paid gave place 4 star  ***Their serving spoon pretty dirty  many times hands would greasy   ***A lot food salty some reason  <EOR> Pretty typical buffet food  If you're Home Buffet anyway  Trying please huge group recently orchestrated trip Vegas headed over Bistro Buffet thinking buffet would only fit everyone's budget but everyone's taste well    Uhm no  variety wasn't bad but quality flavor food was  experience reaffirms why don't buffets unless known being kick ass like Bellagio even then 99% time opt to    The staff fine  dining room clean  Besides nothing stood out    all  Save your appetite real restaurant  You're welcome  <EOR> The Bistro Buffet PALMS Absloutly WORST Buffet Las Vegas!
