I yesterday 8 19 11 break Ole station ordered Chicken Tortilla Soup $5 50  Although ladled some container stove still wait seemed forever  small square to go container like kind you'd put side salad in without lid full cumin water mixed Campbell's vegetable soup two bits chicken inside  ordered food to go said lid carry here? picking around soup then asked Does tortilla soup come tortillas chips something? lady counter said yes then took another 3 4 minutes messing around soup lid try put chips container soup   I felt insanely nauseous eating tortilla soup  Yuck  Save your money sit down restaurant if want better value your money  <EOR> This food court bad opinion  Located near entrances Forum Shops could consider place bargain when compare all other expensive restaurants nearby    The thing really impressed place customer service cleaning people provide  Every time ate stopped table give napkins take trash away offered refill soda gave toothpicks asked if anything else needed  Wow! Really? All food court?? main reason why place stands out!!  The food kind expensive  Expect pay least $10 $11 meal  pretty good variety food Chinese Pizza Burgers BBQ Salads Wraps Coffee etc  far tried Pepperoni Pizza slice Caesar Salad Beef Broccoli which nothing spectacular but also horrible  believe also tried smoothie while back coffee shop which didn't taste great remember     If area looking cheaper quicker option food place probably your best bet  <EOR> 3 5 stars   So also known Caesar's Palace Food Court    I'll essentially repost put one Yum yum   I've only tried pizza place grabbed breakfast probably isn't very accurate  However convenient affordable when just want grab quick bite  calzones other pizza looking but pizza things bit overpriced IMO but salads really stands food court  Giant abundant meats cheeses yum yum! Bonus even customize your own!   Breakfast bit hassle   lines long since everyone wants good breakfast deal    $4 oatmeal $7 set meal eggs bacon etc just fruit cup but also nice giant plates fruit other goodies  Coffee your typical cup o' joe nothing special  definitely breakfast specials next time come!  There also really nice lady night gets utensils sure aren't missing anything even grabs ice your bottled water  Amazing service food court!  Bottomline   Salads GREAT! Breakfast specials WOW! Enjoy! <EOR>
