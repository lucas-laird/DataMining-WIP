How? Read below 1  She managed squeeze 5 four seat table placing extra chair along walkway she didnt idea its fire hazard!!!   Apparently its option combine two tables   2  She only gave 1 tong  tried request extra because its 5 sharing   She said its only 1 tong per table because no dishwasher illogical excuse! dined eat enjoy hear complains  mean hard wash single extra tong? OMG!!! 3  Because crowded only using 1 tong friends burned hand spilled coke all over place  asked cleaning cloth mop but she instead gave roll paper towel they probably cannot afford janitor mop  Whatever reason dont wanna hear it!   friend told girl need extra tong especially 5 there  She didnt choice but finally gave extra tong shes extremely afraid wash herself!  4  No refills soda water given until done eating  Why? Because girl other guy works just chit chatting right corner guests themselves posh hotel costes lounge   5  When paying bills she said she cannot give receipts if payment cash  She said thats things work business  My blood already boiling dont want ride splendid stupidity  business might want pay tax let conscience burn hell woo che style! The selection food night very limited some inedible side dishes sitting whole day aside over marinated meats   Even though girl very rude unprofessional delivered poor service gave good tip she back school!

Such pot stickers grilled fish  also serve sushi rolls but never give those any attention  If want eat sushi ayce Korean BBQ or any buffet general ain't place  ayce sushi joints that  serve rose tea addicted it  I'd drink 5 servings lol  I know better places but can't price  definitely satisfies meat cravings <EOR> All ate korean ribs food does look very fresh but good price buffet  think $15 per person  Also no dessert  <EOR> AYCE FTW!
