Braving stomach's well being another KFC few days later tried another   While pull over wait time took less 3 minutes   But let tell you sampling second sandwiches think cured need ever sample another monstrosities again   think very soul tainted may need confession   exorcism performed   As original address few times past never impressed lackluster service   last incredibly pained job server final straw ever coming particular KFC again  Note said oh love mashed potatoes  <EOR>
