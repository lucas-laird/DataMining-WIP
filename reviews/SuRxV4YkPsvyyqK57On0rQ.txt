Dessert awful  carrot cake  love Chef Mayra's carrot cake normally purchased Rainbow Food prior visit Pura Vida  time cake stale stuck paper served on  chocolate sauce didn't all well cake  also odd astringent taste perhaps much spice?  The service worse  wasn't server wasn't trying but she obviously overwhelmed amount customers  took forever food  restaurant almost two hours just entree pre made dessert   The restaurant didn't look very clean extremely cluttered  also saw employee handle phone computer etc  while wearing food handling gloves sure hope she changed them when she into kitchen! paper towels floor bathroom gross! Parking nearly non existant worried going towed  location also hard find   In short  definitely returning stick homemade vegan goods instead  <EOR> I never really eaten vegan foods until recently  Chef Myra talking wedding reception she catered  preparation ideas food should cooked clearly shows passion making quality food only tastes great but does lack certain textures found common food dish's today  Pura Vida seems nice relaxing place hang while Chef Myra puts it  restaurant takes time everything scratch  Being non vegan honestly say best items food ever tasted vegan chef  definitely visiting Pura Vida try more see else great food tried last  <EOR> This now place delicious organic vegan delectable food!

I really love Latin 'Tude burrito  savory sort spicy surprisingly meaty tasting  also really empanadas   If someone thinking venturing into vegan cuisine recommend give place shot  think surprised meatless eating delicious!  This place small super casual wait staff very nice but often seem stressed out  really busy during lunch especially weekends may reason why  But never rude   I prefer order take because takes long time your food  waited long 30 minutes order because everything prepared fresh but some way streamline process  just takes long  only complaint wait time   Other two minor issues really love ordering here  food delicious beautiful when arrives  least 3 times month  Give try  <EOR> Food fabulous chef obviously brilliant  cannot wait back  told would take some time fine  ready eat lot delicious foods! <EOR> Horrible location average food worth effort trying find it  place located industrial area downtown looks more abandoned shack  deteriorating last 30 years restaurant  bad thought closed until saw people inside  tried quit disappointed  menu VERY limited charge gourmet prices bar quality food  Don't waste your time money  <EOR> A friend referred love place    Great service Great food     chef amazing    food fresh served order     If rich would personally hire chef personal chef personally eat cooking everyday     definitely fav spot far    highly recommend it     <EOR> This review long overdue first visited Pura Vida few weeks opened public   I am vegan but wanted try PV because adore Chef Mayra  interviewed Sausage Factory friend Derek cooking show   The restaurant odd place but close enough downtown office stop by  Hopefully near future they'll able deliver because wait take LOOOOONG despite being busy all    I ordered Latin'Tude which delicious but extremely over priced $10 99 Almond Banana Smooth which also very delicious but very expensive $5 95 just 16oz smoothie   After reading some reviews look forward going back very near future  very rare find vegan vegetarian food satisfies your craving ethnic flavors Chef Mayra does great job making healthy food packed full wonderful flavor!  I'm giving four stars because wait time because food while good crazy expensive  <EOR> The only good thing restaurant industrial area no other businesses nearby parking easy plentiful but restaurant   ???!!!  first concept behind place great    they support local produce farming supplies  behind that    But close vegan friends told biggest problem growing number vegan restaurants tend run vegans but business people know properly run restaurant oftentimes feel just existing somehow doing favor   Simply put waiting 2+ hours food unnacceptable especially when no alerts any delays food shortages experiencing   restaurant very small inside holds less 20 people outside tables another 8   full capacity holds less 30 people when full   The chef condescending attitude towards friends inquired politely where food tried somehow pass off normal wait 2+ hours your food??!! WTF?!!  Long story short half party food other half did while there   restaurant finishing 2 orders time left packed gave free but ironic thing person never any food ordered simplest easiest quickest thing menu  Pancakes!  Speaking menu when waitress comes says she needs explain know you're trouble   No menu should require explanation means convoluted needlessly complicated   Personally didnt think needed any explanation tho quite large maybe would  better served editting down half items them well tables timely manner   I felt bad waitress since she seemed frustrated BUT same time she liason between table kitchen where she being proactive getting food prepared  Also 2+ hours she NEVER refilled waters   Sure could asked refills but really point really shouldnt ask   As food itself?  Nothing great going on   much better vegan food elsewhere employed finesse technique managed full flavour   soup very bland needed lot salt edible   cheesy potatoes could good but potatoes cooked all way thru bit hard   must literally gotten last half potato since other friends never meal because running potatoes   quesadilla ok but basic point quesadilla tortilla melted gooey cheese inside anything else afterthought   Almost no cheese just bunch veggies stuffed into tortilla   grilled cheese really good tho   vegan cheese melts same texture taste real cheese   Sourdough bread really good   But grilled cheese sandwich shouldnt take 2 hours serve   Even vegan friends town know restaurant's reputation said could told bother Pura Vida   prime demographic not vegan veg but doing them any service when vegan community knows stay away  <EOR> Disclaimer am vegetarian vegan  love meat cannot deny usual distaste vegan eateries because experience foods lack flavor strange textures  Having said meal Pure Vida today best freshest lunches long long time!  I read through menu website prior arriving well aware everything prepared fresh take 30 45 minutes prepare  No problem because enjoy long quiet lunches  When walked Cindy directed table gave abundance information well 5 different menus specials drinks other specials lunch breakfast dessert etc    I immediately ordered lime mint blended essential oils water $3 NOTE no longer offer free refills Jan 13 2013   free sugar home made unbelievably refreshing! food settled lunch special a little pricey $14 99 but came much food cannot complain all! chose salad creamy garlic dressing Love burrito  salad GIGANTIC plate fresh veggies including spinach sprouts broccoli cauliflower cucumber etc  dressing came side which great    About 20 minutes later it wasn't very crowded burrito served sun dried tomatoes cuban black beans vegan cheese spinach roasted garlic potatoes avocado chipotle peppers  Let tell best burritos ever AND LOVE MEAT CONTAINED NO MEAT!   little kick but nothing made mouth burn detracted wonderful flavors fresh veggies toasted tortilla    If aren't vegetarian vegan cares? Support little gem because supports chemical free organic healthy dining options skimp flavor portion size  Absolutely wonderful  ambiance also very relaxing peaceful  Cindy waitress extremely helpful friendly made feel old friends  She even gave sample apple cookies made some recommendations next visit which likely tomorrow lol     I cannot recommend place enough  new favorite lunch spot!

Complete detail placed upon every dish each divine meal being its' own little piece heavenly art  Even carnivore friend loved grub discussed Pura regular stop weekly lunch outings   I only rate cafe' 4 because all comments groupons reservations appetizers abrupt chatter staff weird decor limited menu avocados bananas true  But far concerned quality food outweighs negativity   The dining area could spiffied bit DON'T if rush  REALLY need more kitchen help hostess more cohesive website  Although server sweet she could only bring food swiftly prepared  Clearly Chef Myra perfectionist but delegating competent staff would really help grow solidify business needy base health concious locals can't spend more hour half work day lunch hour   time reservation issues need resolved ridiculous expect patrons should wait long even if food amazing    The prices very high but servings large oh YUMMILICIOUS! Pura Vida totally worth money but need major improvement wait issue  Hopefully worked before turning many people off  <EOR> Ok eaten quite few times I'd say continue eat occasion because think food fantastic  obviously lot time put into flavor profiles dishes flavors textures full mouth watering goodness  vegan but am Lacto ovo vegetarian love fact delicious vegan restaurant downtown area  Ok since food good owner does need any help food design because its frickin' great but need some serious help service menu layout  servers nice but efficient  menu design horrible very difficult navigate  efficiency timing kitchen horrible prepared wait 30 minutes hour entrees  see lot mom pop local restaurants great food but no idea efficient create dining experience good food  really hope owner pays attention reviews because much potential here  Let give specific example lack efficiency place  wait because holding 4 tables reservations  fine little wait but no reason wait  watched 3 tables stay dirty over 10 minutes while 3 parties waited seated  mean time nobody showing reservations now 7 tables almost half restaurant being sat because 1 tables being bussed because if lack staff 2 holding tables people yet  should happened tables ready should sat right away walk ins 3 dirty tables should bussed reasonable time accommodate reservations  When reservations able use tables puzzle pieces hold specific tables specific parties unless its large party only certain tables accommodate them   if people running restaurant no experience running busy restaurant  need help organization help basic day day functions running establishment wants grow thrive competitive market  Also eaten probably 5 times always felt wait food wayyyy long  need some help food prep organization execute food timely manor  Yes done  <EOR> Came brunch friend while conference  shared tofu scramble stack pancakes bananas side   There much food! everything absolutely delicious  disappointed didn't any coffee   only reason didn't give 5 stars  Excellent staff fantastic service    The food super filling leave behind few pancakes because just couldn't cram down anymore    If vegan area absolutely pay them visit  Don't fooled exterior place  Trust your tummy your conscience thank you  <EOR> On day Black Friday extremely long fruitful shopping North Las Vegas Premium Outlets mom famished decided just hit any nearby restaurant  open  Luckily yelp stepped found ourselves vegan joint   The place little off track pay attention signs might miss it  place quite small well six tables inside two outside  However very welcoming feel waitress extremely friendly   Their menu selection wasn't big price leaning towards expensive however considering vegan place lots ingredients more expensive start off I'd say reasonable expected  Gluten free available order some dishes but does require advance notice   Once sat waitress informed chef cooks order which means long wait time especially if bigger crowd front you  While inconvenient different normal restaurant find refreshing  Just prepared  wait don't come hungry stomach   Tried Wow Pastry Chocolate pancake boysenberry syrup  did wait close half hour food  Mom tired shopping she dozed off while waiting   When waitress bring chocolate pancake smell aroma miles away  If drug I'd die happy little death just inhaling wonderful aroma  Every bite pancake filled mouth chocolate yet flavor wise overwhelming all  Coupled piping hot boysenberry syrup think found myself dessert heaven   Mom's WOW Pastry came piping hot decorated fresh edible flowers  puff crispy yet light filling mostly scrambled tofu filled all different spices  bite transported exotic country dining royals  Ok might little much exaggeration but trust when tell WOW Pastry GOOD wish live Vegas instead just visiting weekend   Pura Vida wonderful restaurant extremely tasty yet healthy food  only reason didn't give them five star because wish better better local support  Upon leaving waitress informed now call ahead order your food it'll ready when arrive dine restaurant! guess way work around long cooking time   Check place if Vegas!

Chef Mayra enthusiastic passionate  She's creative good natured  entire restaurant oozes kindness   The food usually good sometimes absolutely fantastic but inconsistent    The location convenient tourists Strip anyone works near but place pretty small rather noisy when busy  outdoor area   The service bit frenzied sometimes orders missed take extra long time  If you're hurry don't much patience order something phone take then drive restaurant pick up   Pura Vida still new  expect them iron some imperfections improve over time  concept great food good they're off incredible start  <EOR> I hate food pretends other food  resent lot vegetarian vegan cuisine falls back soy based meat substitutes when many vegetarian vegan dishes stand own flavors  Seriously stop tofurky celebrate some damn vegetables   I worried Pura Vida would fall into trap but pleasantly surprised  chili banana cinnamon waffle both fantastic  only thing didn't service absolute chaos  server extremely friendly but feel kitchen run chefs no business commercial management experience  trying say should turn into Applebee's great food but perhaps need someone more well versed high er volume prep inventory control etc  <EOR> In over decade veganism safely say worst place ever lot!   anyone would give place more two stars absurd  only possible explanation presumes someone still completely trashed night before stumbled did notice care astronomical prices   maybe just hit jackpot    Now sober rest don't feel paying $5 worst coffee water you've ever $13 mediocre waffle basically cheapest thing menu suggest just elsewhere  If look bad reviews place you'll immediately relate them probably look positive ones same skepticism rest us  <EOR> Yuck   We just spent weekend eating vegas buffets wanted back vegetarian ways  place highly rated figured would try it  weird location industrial area  Small place stuffy inside  waitress overly friendly  She called sweety touched shoulder into personal space many times  She argued cook table number over us  Yes over side other other side  food took forever  'coffee' disgusting  sickly sweet tasted some kind chocolately cinnamon goo  didnt even order mocha one   Our food weird  eaten several vegan places liked food  just super strange combinations ingredients dont compliment each other  really expensive was  bathroom scary bathroom! then when came back bathroom server personal space again  just didnt enjoy anything place made nauseous  highest rated vegan place vegas glad only visit area instead live here  <EOR> easy being green sang Kermit   Well easy being vegan especially buffet capital world   Pura Vida Bakery Bystro making lot more tasty   part first annual Vegan Vegas Visit vegan daughter fledgling eatery list dos     The food amazing and suffered through lot experimental cardboard fresh creative good enough refuse leave any behind   high point visit chance meet talk owner chef Mayra vision vegan food Las Vegas restaurant she finally opened share vision     The food reason visit   location starter one   opportunity eat fresh ethically produced food level priceless   Bravo chef Mayra  <EOR> My boyfriend decided check place while Las Vegas weekend  menu looked good pretty excited eating here   We wait little while table maybe 15 20 minutes which no big deal  But then took 30 minutes coffee also can't just order coffee foofy sugary espresso drink over hour all food arrive  only 10 tables whole restaurant least 5 employees working can't see any reason should take long  When people sitting beside asked food they received half food waited 30 40 minutes rest which never came owner gave them condescending long winded speech she refuses industrial kitchen equipment should know food comes slowly  She even argued them when very reasonably politely asked charge them food didn't receive  She also talked she refuses prepare food advance  including mixing batter cutting vegetables  While appreciate sentiment all totally impractical  small batch food prep but absolutely no reason breakfast joint waffle maker more 1 waffle time  don't mind waiting bit good food but 1 2 hours ridiculous especially when doesn't even come same or even close same time  The food pretty good but really expensive portion size  This place run woman high horse no idea operate business   I say aside owner staff very very nice  work hard very kind polite but stuck working very poorly run business  <EOR> I'm others  kind love hate feeling place  really torn rate goes   The good I 3 other people all LOVED food  even though only vegan  ordered chocolate pancakes husband PB banana stuffed pancakes friend some other type pancake other friend french toast  servings HUGE could easily shared someone would both full  ate less half meal came 4 5 very large pancakes  If going pancakes french toast don't tend monstrous appetite would recommend ordering syrup side take to go box  Ours pre syruped would gotten soggy if would tried take leftovers  If rating restaurant just food ordered would 5 stars  Delicious   The bad 1 Menu selection those vegan restaurants able vegan because use lots fake meats fake cheese soy  If soy sensitive trying avoid soy or just don't fake meats fake cheeses may hard time finding something eat unless breakfast    2 wait HOLY COW  Unreasonable doesn't even begin cover it  called hour ahead seated immediately when 3 4 empty tables left which lot given small place it but waited literally hour 20 minutes food  told would 45 minutes asked if wanted snack while waited  friend ordered fruit plate took 35 minutes come yes timing it   obvious fruit pre cut the apples browning around edges sitting being cut why earth took 35 minutes throw some fruit onto bowl beyond me   Also 3 meals done 15 20 minutes ahead 4th almost done eating time last person table food    3 coffee little thing but coffee WAY strong or sitting SEVERAL hours which don't think even possible given 11 30 am   friend ordered coffee used 3 servings creamer still strong drink  all tried agreed this    4 Don't judge place its location its exterior  looks very shady bars windows neighborhood obviously less desirable  friends clearly nervous when pulled building  <EOR> This vegan restaurant still located less desirable section town furnishings second hand store quality but food  server again attempted sell appetizer but learned past experience quantity food served much us   My wife ordered Sexy short stack organic flour pancakes made cinnamon real vanilla  billed having vegan maple syrup whatever plus lots seasonal fruit which turned over ripe bananas   fared no better Tha' Waffle big waffle upgraded seasonal fruit same overripe  bananas dollop whipped cream $1 heavy tasteless  Both server kitchen don't worry happy time took awhile orders arrive  Prices high meal proved disappointing several levels  <EOR> This place amazing  some most flavor ever any food vegan not  friend brunch sampler taste little everything excellent  portions pretty big sampler enough food 3 4 people eat comfortably but think meant only 2 people    I'm giving place 5 stars because want them well but some minor things would suggest work on    The menu pretty confusing  lady helped walk through which confused more already was    The location didn't mind driving all but location seemed way little bit  place itself felt more taqueria restaurant which also didn't mind but then again young dude used army living conditions   The price cost nearly $60 brunch sampler coffee drink tip  picked pricier things menu though  many cheaper options  Although I'd find hard two people spending less $30  But definitely pay quality ingratiates quality preparation  <EOR> Vegan Vegas again   I'll put disclaimer first  happy mood when came here  Annoyed losing money annoyed weren't going Ronald's Donuts planned instead here    The service itself okay but very slow  four people prep area but really only person serving actually doing work  She very nice but attentive needs learn multi task   ordered orange apple water which quite refreshing kind vitamin water really diluted sunny d    The food pretty good though pricey side  chile relleno burrito  expecting chile relleno inside buritto but really more flavors chile relleno  pepper stuffed inside burrito some daiya cheese  good but something could replicate home easily  did also come delicious serving beans rice  portion huge  came two mini burritos cut half four half burritos  enough dinner later  friend Latin tude another burrito concoction though couldn't remember exactly it     I would give place another chance though dying return  <EOR> Man if wanted some imitation food I'd look those plastic y window displays   But since when did vegan food become equated imitation food?!?!  Hubby shared sampler platter breakfast $15 LOT food more food then two could ever finish! here's contradiction isn't vegan also suppose good people! JUST animals  cruelty fellow humans offer such large portions!!!    sampler included Latin'tude Love tofu scramble vegan sausage roasted potatoes Tha' Waffle two small pancakes chocolate covered strawberry    The first three items just different kinds tofu!!! followed vegan sausage not sure food group would be three kinds starches  happened VEGETABLES?!?!  There *were* several spinach leaves some sliced green bell pepper more garnish really  Everything else short potatoes strawberry something pretending something else  WHY???  It tasted ok while hot  But ended waiting over half an hour do vegans places? time food came just warm which left just small window opportunity try enjoy before began resembling soft rubber    All all verdict Pura Vida once is enough but unfortunately only vegan resto doesn't believe real food    <EOR> Finally! Somewhere Las Vegas brunch besides own kitchen!  Now know you're thinking Jen isn't brunch mainly excuse swig bloody Mary's and or Mimosas drunk before 2pm? doesn't being vegan able eat anything besides dry toast fruit easier?  Well yes   there   But sometimes actually want little protein maybe waffle instead   much ask? Apparently so   Until now     I'm gonna honest   tried some Chef Mayra's catered food before events blown away   fine always just bit bland   brunch! Fortunately three friends just everything brunch menu shared   usually big fan sweet carb y breakfast food but waffles french toast outstanding   OMFG chocolate waffle   most delicate delicious brownie    don't know if could eat whole but 1 4 perfect breakfast dessert   also loved regular waffle sausage peppers came French toast! only thing wasn't crazy breakfast burrito   bit cold unmelted Daiya cheese flavor profile just didn't hit right   But side beans came       damn   best things tasted awhile!  admit probably took more fair share      Great coffee lots different flavors coconut milk creamer   ultimate refreshment citrus cucumber water  Yum   We very attentive service chef even came spoke personally   total bill 4 coffees entree fancy waters under $60   all left completely stuffed quite happy   Can't wait come back try lunch menu if good favorites brunch menu probably round 5 stars   thrilled organic all vegan place  close home! <EOR> Im having wedding cake made here  brought family brunch tasting well  busy service slow tv crew doing some sort review well  amped busy factor  am also pretty sure taking pictures food  took while but came coffee lattes juice salsa samples bean dip salsa samples etc  kept busy while waited   The bean dip salsa thingy amazing  mom just kept eating it  Fairly addictive must say   The food huge delicious  father pancakes fruit fiance chocolate waffle mom waffle fruit did brother sister law  father champ took down pancakes pretty well but enormous  divided neatly half tried some sausage potatoes  sausage spicy but good potatoes needed salt touch oil but good too  pancakes delicious filling  waffles reviewed good flavor but little crumbly all non vegans but impressed good reviews   mother declared sausage nothing real sausage moved on    The coffee lattes candy bars drink  more dessert like but no complaints  mocha mother caramel think   Juice great everyone very happy it   The cake tasting also well  decided lemon cake super moist spongy  frosting decadent sweet am considering fruit filling point calm sugar but good   My only touch issue location little strange wait food bit long fact wedding cakes quoted easily  Its process estimate frustrating but its nice Chef doesnt overcharge instead  Its just toss guess  staff sweet nice  am fan cake decorator especially she adorable <EOR> This best food while  just bonus its vegan organic! good! French toast apples them fabulous! <EOR> Pura Vida amazing food over priced but quantities large enough share between two people   Chef Mayra lady cook but she no idea run restaurant  husband groupon told server she then explained very limited choices order use groupon  limited choices included 6 dishes including drinks anything else  menu very extensive complicated took server 7 minutes run through everything   server great everything know she deal Chef Mayra way yelling across tiny restaurant saying you've tot table etc etc etc while she's trying take orders other customers  table also moved already sat down 15 minutes Chef Mayra herself while sitting trying drink coffee  stressed having moved around listen Chef Mayra bitch moan while just trying eat peacefully  Also if don't any coupons anything prices dish anywhere $12 00 $17 00   Flavored water $4 00 smoothies $8 00  astronomical! Just Fyi  Also upon arriving asked if made reservations um   what? aware this  Then Mayra made seem intruding  fan  <EOR> I eat Pura bring all non vegan friends family all time    don't mind 1 hour wait food    even think waitresses nice    want support restaurant cruelty free   But something happened today when eat there    ordered pancakes table next ordered pancakes too   Now before table sat down ordered   waiting very patiently food am waiting hour when finally waitress put pancakes table   soon gonna dig other waitress comes takes off table says table next me   waitress asked if same order said yes   She then came back tell since kid ordered pancakes   want food kids first   just thought stupidest reason ever!!!

I don't know say incident   think going take break Pura awhile  <EOR> First all generous 1 star only because no option no stars   I nothing say Pura Vida's food because never try since supposed community friendly small business would serve 1 45 because clock said 1 50 when hours clearly state close 2 pm   Here's story    vegan friend visiting bought Groupon deal  Saturday planned lunch thankfully called first said close 2  Sunday tried look menu online going call order pickup but site bandwidth error message could see menu   right now still can't see website   So drove all way across town arrived 1 45  soon walked woman called while still standing doorway closed obvious grateful tone turn away  tried explain tried come two days special treat vegan friend  She carelessly dismissed everything said saying take last order 1 45 the policy kitchen because food takes long  practically begged served place woman no care world   wanted talk someone else charge but then thought why bother woman obviously doesn't want business  told would NEVER come back she very bad business  course she couldn't care less  left further annoyed noticed flashing open sign window  UGH!  Between friend lived worked service industry Las Vegas Miami LA Portland never experienced small business having such audacity turn away wold happy customers  such bad business move modern times such high competition among businesses great opportunity online reviews word of mouth  Shame Pura Vida   It seems place good reviews good food but never know since refuse back  all favor supporting local businesses am Las Vegas native  Las Vegas where competition against big corporations great  should all supporting community establishments but when clear need business do? Dominos pizza money today again Pura Vida shame you   We refunding Groupon telling everyone know bother going Pura Vida before 1 45 pm ever  <EOR> I haven't even place eat yet because can't even reservation!!

PS Restaurant lot Groupon people also YELPERS would little more accommodating those review your restaurant!   Very disappointed customer shall say    didn't even far! <EOR> I'm vegan but am plant based eater am always glad when new places serve organic eats  isn't first foray into Chef Mayras food she's catered Yelp party prior which gave hopes something spicy zesty flavor filled brunch   David S  came before volunteering Three Square shared large portions  both wanted come weekday when wasn't busy  think very meat eater friendly hearty  Unless your family eats only meat good brunch eats any person    Sexy Shortstack added blueberries +$1 into pancakes came bananas I guess weekends gets fancier fruit medley extra pancake   Don't why toned down weekdays?   Vegan some yummiest had  very light fluffy cakes enough places serve good syrup compliments overpower into saccharine coma  always share sweet breakfast foods since often much sweet but see myself actually ordering being able eat maybe side sausage    My Love Burritos spicy zesty flavor filled hoping for  two burritos perfect sharing all kinds spiraled veggies garnished but ate those too    maybe could salad some dressing it? tortilla grilled    I always disappointed sandwich wraps around town just hand cold tortilla  filling indeed could big man appetite alone    Of course keep mind isn't fast food  Everything fresh made did take while It wasn't completely packed but constant flow people   probably 15 minutes pancakes then another 10 burritos come  thought isn't unreasonable  staff nice server friendly attentive service smile    The reason why haven't even when BF eating 100% plant based times  really sucks being night people breakfast places closed before even wake weekends  2pm Saturdays seems limited city ours   and also closed Sundays   It'll probably while before come back but because don't want to  <EOR> Love love LOVE place!!  The majority diet vegan  Well     whole food plant based  any vegan places closer but 15 minutes away  thrilled finally tried place!

Looking around unsure sign read  When pointed stated plainly no Groupons would accepted weekend following 4th July if Groupon come back tomorrow  [This immediately gave flashback Father's Day weekend '13 when came different friend upon attempting redeem Groupon told would accept due holiday weekend  Even though expired weekend no where Groupon did say void holiday weekends]    Continuing on    having Groupon visit friend didn't worry sign  then asked rather shortly still want eat here?! could barely 'yes' mouth before then asked Well reservation?! Having EVER made reservation save Mother's Day '13 said 'no'  then met pretty much Let see if room   Thankfully brief time seated    Upon choosing meals orders taken  decided 'Tha Frenchie' which french toast dish syrup bananas fresh berries [when season] A DRIZZLING chocolate syrup  Having ordered dish Mother's Day able eat more two bites because absolutely DRENCHED chocolate syrup [and no berries since season] politely asked three questions time 1 berries season? yes 2 berries french toast? yes 3 please order dish no chocolate syrup? yes some great conversation friend meals arrived  french toast no chocolate syrup but neither did any berries  Before waitress walked away said Oh! looks berries missing  May please berries? which she replied Let check    Puzzled response friend exchanged looks   Chef Mayra owner then walked abrasively table lectured choosing no chocolate syrup messed flavor profile essentially dare think could further ruin flavor profile enjoying berries dish no chocolate syrup ?   really made no sense all then said Well menu says dish comes fresh berries   I just didn't want chocolate    Chef Mayra then continued stated am lucky she today else chefs would even altered Signature Dish extent putting chocolate syrup because trained alter Signature Dishes    Oh but special day   she then handed large strawberry sliced plate  your berry time  But won't able next time    Wow    I felt huge slap face  whole deal still doesn't much sense me  Why she such bad mood? Why she offended didn't want chocolate syrup? sure didn't mention thirteen wasted dollars Mother's Day due french toast being ruined gallon chocolatey goodness  Maybe should have?   In any case felt very undervalued customer today  time since Pura Vida opened its doors brought LOT varied business them  business would initially never even considered restaurant less suggested  it   It really bad see such good restaurant idea live its potential because bad customer service  vegan loved eat here  But money and partner's friends' family members' money spent elsewhere  restaurants where aren't treated annoyances  <EOR> Amazing food  Truly amazing  really good vegan chef easiest please when comes vegan food   I loved it   My husband loved it  You reservation in   Many yelpers complained wait time being turned away but just place requires reservation  over it  We made reservation warmly greeted chef entered if home she busy cooking advance   The prices seemed high menu but once food realized prices perfect HUGE size meals got  husband shared two meals two small kids still took home enough food SHARE dinner night  I really back try some sweeter options menu  more savory lunch items time don't think ever better food restaurant ever      As Groupons read fine print those things  shop owner just nothing off sale Groupon cut em' some slack    Wait time your meal around 30 minutes more less  Expect that  But once your food you'll forget long took realize custom made amazing  <EOR> I am love Love  Yes love Asian violinist extraordinaire but Love also delectable burrito share Pura Vida  Pura Vida must try all vegans vegetarians gluten free among us  If you're looking meat sadly miss delicious offerings served kind Chef Mayra   I stopped lunch although am also eager try breakfast note Mayra said Monday mornings best   must say very hot dining room am sure if off thing but don't show coat! way still enjoyed meal  Mason waiter complete charm    I ordered combo lunch comes wrap sandwich choice soup salad  choices Love Burrito salad  $14 99 which may seem expensive but portions huge  salad size entree salad some places ended taking half burrito home dinner    I also ordered hibiscus tea strawberries more perfect refreshing beverage  tad sweet but overwhelmingly so   The salad  beautiful broccoli cucumbers zucchini fresh mixed greens spaghetti spirals carrots squash probably more am forgetting! sight behold  mentioned earlier love Love  chock full beans spinach potatoes peppers avocado  truly flavor explosion  type dish want stuff much possible into your mouth once hopes maximize deliciousness  know feeling?

The whole experience just kind bizarre  dramatic  borderline rude   Not mention while waiting group four came in   same frantic explanation limited menu  chose sit down   made mistake bringing outside drinks iced coffees    Now while waiting spied signs outside drinks being allowed   then watched chef approach table just take drinks customers put them garbage  No verbal explanation  No Hey would finish that? don't allow outside drinks  She just took them customers threw them away  REALLY?? customers kind playing along drama but could tell action direct hit   Finally two 16 oz containers chili come out   Yay!

Never assume  side turned into appetizer  took maybe 20 minutes plate arrive while waited  waiter explained accidentally served dish another table but making another quickly possible    Meanwhile cook some other staff busy next table working catering order  cook even asked waiting but rather gruffly nowhere didn't realize register right away talking said  Tip if cooks going walk into customer area please don't walk all dirty  Thankfully vegan place there's no blood apron but such messy looking cook wonder messy clean kitchen your food be  Finally 50 minutes waiting since placing order starting write yelp review phone delivered plate  Consequently redo review   There no sense urgency correct mistake provide snack while waited ask if wanted something else prepared more quickly etc  dish uncomplicated burrito beans soyrizo potato tofu scramble   Judging products used could see doubt anything complicated made house only actually didn't see taste everything listed menu burrito  chef owner when arrived but left shortly thereafter  couldn't help but wonder perhaps if she stayed service would slow  flavors ok but lack ingredients lack balance disappointing  menu said avocado potatoes etc didn't see any avocado only piece potato When almost finished plate waitress offered free dessert wait  nice but would've really preferred more communication effort whilst waiting during mistake caused such delay  really wanted love place place frequent when town but now reservations it   Cut couple days later decided back give them another chance final meal Vegas trip  time breakfast chef owner entire time  food delivered table roughly 15 20 minutes quicker previously tastier however disturbed attitude chef owner  She condescending staff front us  She would apologize waitress didn't explain something menu take order but mean tone right front waitress helping next table ready place order waiting  timing all just worked way  Then when chef owner giving suggestions extra items add food very forced suggested usually done restaurants would suggest little more customer service oriented training one   We learned chef owner talking next table restaurant experiment pantry stocking management etc before she opens another location  suggestion since turns lot menu items aren't available moment please note menu those items seasonal perhaps put chalkboard seasonal items currently available  save staff lot trouble management headache customer disappointment  It wonder well available? why bother putting menu? why burrito empty other day? if then why am paying full price? Perusing dessert case chef owner pointed items even fresh whole batch brownies opposed ones cut half decorated  asked waitress if price difference between cut half whole she check  She reported same price requested whole brownie  didn't even want decorations  She back item but could clearly hear chef owner state she didn't want serve fresh brownies just yet  waitress come back fib chef busy decorate brownie right now brought half brownie full price  tasty  If want sell day old goods mark price them accordingly  record all 3 ! tables 5 patrons received food table placed order yet unless working phone order another catering job kitchen busy   My advice stick savory food items phone your order go  <EOR> OK let start saying looking something Candle Cafe NYC one all time favorite dining establishments anywhere Source San Francisco Las Vegas  two years found anything until now  Pura Vida does lot well few things well  being said imagine going back many times  What good 1 believe staff genuinely cares food cleanliness understand important food is  use great ingredients treat them well felt good eating every way  today world where most food comes Sysco all restaurants low high end where most everything factory farmed part system toxic start finish finding establishment REAL gem  also good quesadillas salsa burrito rooibos tea FANTASTIC chocolate chip peanut butter cookies   going back try more menu   What good  slow slow me  understandably still working challenges surround serving fresh organic raw food no preservatives  could also use expediter sure customers' experience better  People wait long even Las Vegas  Chef T awesome Cynthia Jean awesome wait back  If experience little bit crisper if recipes other dishes good today update five star review  <EOR> The food awesome prices high experience dramatic stressful  walked girlfriend mom dad right 9 00 when opened Sunday  told since didn't reservations take card reservations next time  I tried call them 8 30 reservations morning but no answer   chef pretty stressed no reservations but she reluctantly  sat VIP area   There other table people eating when sat down  few more tables came while eating but never full didn't whole reservation thing   The first thing mouth waitress let tell don't   best way start  loooong confusing  explanation could could order decided few things    The food took while but when came awesome  Really fresh super yummy  chef came over talk point animals why shouldn't eat them  vegan  it  respect passion generally quirky eccentric people but advice would take down notch chill   Everything going alright  <EOR> Holy  Crap  If you'd told going eat vegan food just but LOVE I'd laughed your face said something Oh while walking away shaking head amusedly  mean card carrying carnivore there's no way vegan meat  cheese could ever satisfy real thing right?
