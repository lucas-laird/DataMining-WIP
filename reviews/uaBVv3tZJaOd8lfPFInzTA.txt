Needless say won't returning place need security guard! Future customers beware! <EOR> First time ever Wendys  Last minute lunch run agreed drive Wendys  line long drive thru but pretty quick service awesome! close work return     really enjoyed food! <EOR> I Wendy's multiple times solely because its proximity work  biggest issue often food items baked potatoes spicy nuggets grilled chicken name few encountered   But tell while ordering look menu pick something else  always told window sometimes already paid  Then  hassle needing credited money back  Today regular nuggets they didn't spicy prepared pulled pork sandwich cold  Thumbs down Wendy's! <EOR> Ordered food today between 5pm 5 30pm less ok  chicken sandwich good but where ends  Baked potato cold particular store doesn't cheese bacon its potato's? Ok uh huh  fries white raw  soda funny taste sure if mixture ice  <EOR> Took girlfriend date  waited over 45 minutes seated  finally approached janitor informed would need cashier  girlfriend visibly upset point but decided comply hoping would end troubles  wrong  When reached front line told women cashier reservation 7pm  women no idea talking asked would eat  kept pressing reservation but she would only reply menu items  Looking back sure she spoke English  point decided call quits take girlfriend somewhere else Roberto's   am thoroughly disappointed Wendy no longer dining restaurants any longer  Let warning all Wendy's fine dining establishment  <EOR> Service slow  It looked chaos back  It took over 15 minutes sandwiches line kept forming  Plus wait drink while food cold ketchup  They super nice but understaffed <EOR> We eaten several times over past few years  Wendy's hands down fastest ever seen  Just fast food supposed like  <EOR> Went coffee since McDonald's Starbucks closed 11pm  disappointing  don't care weak but did mind wasn't even lukewarm sugar packets soaked spilled coffee since decided put cup coffee paper bag  Oh well know order  <EOR> This Wendy's REALLY SLOW getting food out  food pretty standard Wendy's but service SUPER SLOW  Also tends dinner spot lot homeless around area carry some loose change  <EOR> This closest Wendy's place work  am more often would like recently found better location   location normal Wendy's spread all know love  But now adventure tied it!  The ups? staff quick friendly present  lines never crazy if your order simple correct fresh   The downs? bathroom never clean  seen far many sketchy characters including crying hooker hiding cop outside now only really through drive through  If your order off just simple no onion expect something completely different ordered  example would love grilled chicken sandwich no tomato receives Jr bacon cheeseburger   <EOR>
