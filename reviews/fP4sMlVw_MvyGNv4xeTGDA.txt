As said first reviews The first time dragged skeptical love pizza but really want assumed fast food style pizza? long going take? Would filling? expensive? Obviously all questions answered ended overjoyed decision   Chipotle many other casual fast food places able build your meal in case pizza everything laid right front  First start your crust am huge fan wheat prepare your base  mix all five cheeses top Alfredo base tastes white pizza    There many toppings choose also recommend planning ahead before just start adding things crust thin toppings could end piled high if aren't paying attention  add basil cilantro light spinach some garlic  meats choose half pepperoni half spicy chicken  Go half half two pizzas pie! No matter your price $7 95   bake thin crust pizza SUPER hot pizza oven char bottom your pie adds flavor  Now reason wanted completely update because discovered some differences staff AGAIN! clear never met anyone staff made want leave bad review everyone courteous some even friendly 'regulars'  Previously recommended visit evenings weekends  because manager nighttime weekend staff Jose doing much above beyond spoiled  Coming during day dealing certain attitudes like Crystal example turned off  Sean decent but noticed lack zeal during shifts time seemed more interested getting giving delicious pizzas  Well am proud announce things changed!!!  The crews definitely evened out say still prefer visit when Sean Jose working because just better general vibe  two managers encourage crews bring 'casual' into fast food place making more dining experience 'drive through' deal  experience special beginning greet upon entry ensure tables available until close generally feel welcome  Best all throughout experience seem genuinely happy serve even making conversation    To point all stars Jerry Justus Joseph some favorite team members  Whether line working oven trust them deliver perfect pie! also pleasure meeting Jake District Manager  He awesome! day met he supposed end day normal hour like 4 5 6pm but didn't end leaving until almost 9  He training newer employee  franchise just point all around  Based progress seen Jake definitely doing outstanding job encouraging team best every shift! commend ability deal usual fast food issues like high turnover drama younger employees etc  create place actually want visit  Thank Jake listening comments providing direction your team see appreciate it!

Kudos Jeremy prep line being accommodating topping requests   Check place out! never busy you'll never worry wait  <EOR> Finally visited large customizable pizza chains which I'd slacked trying  impressed   Pieology Pizzeria restaurant busy corner Flamingo Paradise shares small plaza several other fast casual chains  close highway but convenient other stuff part town   Pieology uses familiar Chipotle esque model  regular price $8 45 slightly more local outposts competitors you'll able customize your pizza start finish any toppings desired so don't lazy boring stick limited preset combos crust sauce s cheese s veggies meats  Pieology comparable array selections most categories give take but doesn't much  unique except perhaps spicy buffalo sauce corn topping   The main problem ingredients collectively did enough salt  asked food to go much time crunch ended wolfing down pizza both long communal table I'd taken box car  did find thin crust crispy enough amount toppings as hinted added huge variety sufficient general but lack flavor puzzling  compounded complete lack tableside hot sauce offerings which competitors offer if spades   I won't back Pieology very often  Aside lack convenient location for anyway simply weren't impressive competitive market segment  <EOR> Horrific service here  Waited 10 minutes without 2 employees even acknowledging then said he'd right back  5 minutes later asked if someone else could help told guy cutting pizzas just told wait only 5 minutes  sure why asking  help offended but left immediately  Would recommend  <EOR> This place pretty good   light toppings feel free ask more   Remember unlimited toppings  crust super thin   fan thin crust loved it   cook pizza pretty crispy almost burnt crust ask brown crispy   Everyone nice but friendly   best part place all quotes wall   pizza really good love combo mozzarella ricotta cheese red onion basil artichoke bacon pepporoni sausage  Delicious  all pizza held pretty well  would again lunch   filling enough dinner  <EOR> I really looking forward trying place  fell love concept assembling pizza same way order sandwich Subway  price great pie ready quick   Unfortunately pie itself did deliver  Three strikes The crust cardboard  Bad texture  Dense  really cranking them out  I during lunch rush  Maybe needed more time rest coming press   The pie surprisingly spicy   didn't order spicy  Don't wrong spicy but didn't order didn't expect it   Maybe red sauce cross contaminated buffalo sauce something   The cheese all but disappeared  saw them put but when pie came oven looked no cheese it  No ooey gooey   I'll probably give them another try different ingredients and ask if double cheese but first impression big disappointment  <EOR> This trend build your own pizza joints sets well me  few different places each offers similar model  dubious task telling each apart another  said pizza Pieology today quite good   I asked thick crust pizza  brushed edges olive oil which different other places do  traditional sauce mozzarella ricotta mushrooms olives minced garlic ham salami bacon  Yes lot  But good  crazy filling  many toppings thick crust should taken some home  But just couldn't stop eating  does tell you?  Despite crust being thicker still crisped even little charred  black marks finger tips when done  Just another dimension flavor texture  perfect cook rather fast that  oven must screaming hot   One thing noticed Pieology drink selection  First all many soda fountainss order  no difference me  don't typically drink soda  however drink iced tea  three flavors regular black tea Mandarin green tea watermelon tea  Watermelon tea? sounded interesting tried it  suppose light sweetness flavor  watermelon more aroma tea  alright  may stick regular tea next time but watermelon tea refreshing cool  refill lemonade  But just any lemonade  No three too  Regular pomegranite blood orange  blood orange lemonade  good  Sweet  Tart  Well rounded  Again though think I'd stick regular stuff future  no issue trying new things but love classic   So long story short Pieology another yourself pizza joint  hesitate call cookie cutter store but some very evident similarities few other places  isn't anything wrong that  If pizza good eat it  try all places determine if more other  But experience they're all good  Pieology no exception  <EOR> Loved pizza   Fresh really good perfect lunch   Staff very nice helpful   gave only 4 stars because music loud could talk   party 5 difficult time hearing each other said  <EOR> I love concept !
