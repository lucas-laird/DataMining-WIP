Most restaurants won't sit until your whole party present   Well didn't face problem here   Being first show once hostess very pleasant directed open table while waited everyone arrive   The ambience very relaxed  Lighting set mood  light dark  Just correct amount lighting which set start great night! However Saturday night very evident clientele toward youngeryounger crowd  Which fine me! Only meant wouldn't stuck waiting long service irate customers etc   When everyone arrived started off few rounds drinks  Nothing jumped soecialty drink wise just ordered beers tap vodka drinks Jameson shots wine throughout course turned 2 hour meal   Bacon Cheddar Biscuits  Very cliché  all but everything tastes better bacon! biscuits soft  hard  Very but try just right amount bacon  over powering   just biscuits itself  Add honey salt butter friend fight over would last biscuit  settled extra order before left because good but couple hours drinking forgot! Bacon Eggs deviled eggs set atop red onion jam thick cut bacon accompanied toast  more dish fight over getting last pieces  Bacon tender! Practically falls apart your mouth  am type person views  deviled eggs homey should ordered restaurant unless wow factor it  want come back another it  red onion jam right amount sweetness balanced mustardy flavor deviled eggs  highly recommend it!  Smoked Ham Hock Nachos disappointed! nachos came crisp soggy  All components complimented each other without ever being overpowering    American Ham Cheese Board Working catering sample better cheeses offer but disappointed selection presentation  cheese selections Tillamook Cheddar Laura Chenel Chevre buttermilk blue  All American cheeses west coast region  hams Three Little Pigs Benton's Ham  most drawn mustard  wish more board itself  Great accompaniment cheeses   Chinese Chicken Salad would think would plain even listed ingredients  But nope! Very refreshing salad  1 order fed all four us   Roasted Bartlett Pear Salad contained roasted pear fresh honey crisp Apple slices  very light refreshing appetizer salad  Can't wrong here  Roasted pears done perfection  over cooked  fresh crisp apples added nice contrast other ingredients    Bag Doughnut Holes didn't enough room all drinks food but somehow managed sneak dessert  doughnut holes light fluffy  very heavy  perfect ending meal if want keep light yes fried leave alone   salted caramel could stand bit more saltier hence name but salt   Staff all drinks forgot names server runner  But very attentive  Quick banter your group made dining experience much better  Nothing worse server doesn't there    Overall would come back again hearing industry night! Can't wait back again  all food ate check split four ways around $40 $50 person  hit mark delivery modern take comfort foods  Definitely recommend friends looking come back more!  *Photos Posted* <EOR> So post something even tho restaurant closing 2 weeks  wife dinner drinks last night  Love fact food fun spin things  seated manager looked through menu  ended ordering Nashville hot chicken sandwich split it  Before wife took bite she looked down chicken noticed meat RAW!!!!! little bit cooked pink middle  RAW!    told waiter bartender situation he apologized removed item off bill discounted rest 30%    Now idk but took couple bites RAW chicken sandwich  Which could very sick    Don't think whole meal should comped??? But    Regardless wife sat decided maybe try dessert    ordered ordered another drink hoping just chefs mistake   45 minutes later     No dessert    waiter didn't put order in    chef needs fired    again   drinks comped off bill    left over $19 dollars    wife worked bartender server she struggles tip people service industry    Leaving bartender $10 dollar tip   which honestly can't believe she did   But working being generous lol    Honestly place worst   only if looking salmonella <EOR> Last night really excited visit location heard two favorite people would playing music patio  thought would great something munch warm drink two sitting outdoors next warm fire listening some great live music  sat listened some great live music 2 5 hours there  band taken break manager very unprofessionally came tapping watch parent getting child because they've taken break homework  even more embarrassing manager time he did no patio time because just become cold addition no wait staff coming serve warm meal snack drink! Once management gets grip wait staff would enjoy going back hear friends perform! Instead heard management asked performers come back  Hmmm maybe owner needs management lack managerial skills bad decision making  No need back now  <EOR> I really enjoyed eating here  lovely table lovely patio lovely Sunday morning  servers friendly attentive   Unfortunately universally disappointed food  all significantly less satisfying expected be  point kept wondering if problem me  But don't think was  food just missed mark  almost if trying hard  fact 'way' 'too' operative adjectives  rich the signature biscuits   Way sweet the french toast sticks   Way way fried the home fries   Way way way dense dry the banana pudding    The pudding particularly disappointing  looking forward rich smooth creamy pudding layered whipped cream wafers  served poorly executed trifle  home fries similarly disappointing  unnecessarily deep fried point being hard crunchy   I left Made LV feeling if eaten incredibly unhealthy meal but good way  Good delicious unhealthy food satisfies cravings healthy food never can  meal just made wonder why eaten much saturated fat without ever having ask myself why unhealthy food tastes good? <EOR> Went 2pm Saturday    service phenomenal!!!

But digress     EGGPLANT RUBEN $10 Made LV's menu quite small even fewer options available vegetarians  all years however never seen eggplant ruben! sauerkraut barely detectable 1000 island dressing  eggplant itself seemed void any seasonings  sandwich overall just okay  wouldn't again but worth shot  meal came big bag house chips but would've preferred fries!!   SMOKEHOUSE BURGER $12 50 Hubby promptly demolished meaty burger gave thumbs up  helped myself bag fries  SERVICE Made LV seriously fell short service  server took 5 minutes greet take orders  Then he hardly checked thereafter  husband's coke empty days before refilled  server didn't smile attempt feign friendliness just felt bothering him    AMBIANCE Loved industrial feel inside Made LV  realized towards end meal whole separate seating area behind bar  Wish would've sat instead since 21+ ! There's outdoor patio dining area well    Worth Return Visit?

Certainly Im pleb  But could  Compared many other brunch locations Vegas some work but food tasted above average which enough feel satisfied  <EOR> Places kill me much potential yet quality food pricing horrible! If looking place dine no reservations small portions over priced items your place!
