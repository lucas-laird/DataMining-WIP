The first time came recognized lady working counter lady worked Jenni Pho   can't comment pho favorite dish dried vermicelli salad   also ordered 3 bean dessert   good first experience which deemed second trip   My second visit good   Because work day decided use drive through however when drive through sign said come inside see menu something effect   ordered take once again time wanted something quick easy beef chow fun   First am ordering people leaving decided conversation lady taking order   continue conversation wasn't even there   place order then wait wait wait wait   20 minutes later ask girl counter playing laptop playing music watching music videos long does take chow fun  don't think she understood English cause she looked confused   also asked lady took order when chow fun going done   All tell coming coming  When cook finally started cooking chow fun took them 5 minutes cook pack order   way only customer time chow fun just okay nothing rave about   experience enough return Rainbow Pho Express   service terrible! <EOR> I'm actually excited there's another Vietnamese restaurant area  dishes little more expensive then most typical vietnamese restaurant prices but  well crafted artistic tell chef takes job seriously quality above your typical vietnamese restaurants  would definitely recommend place over closest competitor Jenni Pho  <EOR> I am Los Angeles visiting friends Las Vegas brought Vietnamese restaurant  way outside typical Chinatown   Rainbow Pho Express located corner strip center even drive thru   restaurant looks fairly new appropriately decorated staffs quite friendly   However gem hidden bowl Pho   order give good contrast review understand plenty good Pho places LA Rainbow Pho Express landing number favorite Vietnamese restaurant serious matter   Now back actual review ordered Pho Special bowl landed front fragant smell broth must required hours simmering   noodle cooked al dente which won't all soggy soft time finish entire bowl   meat fresh taste beef still lingers  also cup coffee kind coffee ensure awake drive back LA kind caffine dose  friend ordered prawns which served mini clay pot light palates because sauce heavily flavored but course  why bring place rice!     Watch Vegas finally healthier options available drive thru replacing typical 2000 calorie burger !!!   Dear Rainbow Pho Please notify advance if opening LA! <EOR> I love rice plates!! chef also adds little artistic touch food too! <EOR> Finally Pho  decent located Chinatown! drive thru knew! Anyways just happened try place whim step into Cheeburger Cheeburger glad tried it  Walked quickly seated slow night    We started off dining experience pot stickers which decent but sauce bland  Then each ordered bowls Pho ordered rare beef brisket WOW bowls huge! broth darker see most places expect packed flavor  certainly did disappoint  Great fusion flavor all ingredients  meat tender actually tasted real meat  others mentioned noodles cooked perfectly mushy  iced Thai tea good but little pricey $3 50 small glass give you   Overall dining experience great  staff quick always checked us  pros compared Jenni Pho take debit cards  if don't want trek Chinatown live SW try place  Another thing separate menu drive thru give options  <EOR> This pace Bomb when comes Pho soup   service great see cooks prepping your food   Pho soup great taste it   Jenny Pho used spot but trying Rainbow Pho never looked back  <EOR> I can't judge pho place becuz didn't try it  But tell rice dishes die for!!  They very generous portions  $8 $10 rice dishes seriously huge square plate loads food  even share between 2 people both full  Place very new clean even drive thru  service actually good compared other Asian places    The only downside think drink prices  $3 50 most specialty drinks but sizes kind small  But guess money somewhere since food portions big  <EOR> Bun Thit Nuong Huge bowl cold rice vermicelli bbq pork mixed fresh sliced lettuces really good comparing Vietnamese restaurants Chinatown   really simple Vietnamese dish but made super good              it's because delicious flavored BBQ pork      Overall great experience good starter some good egg rolls other recommended  end fresh coconut jello waitress recommended    I m impressed food service would  definitely back try Pho next time m here!! <EOR> I hoping really place since less 5 minutes home but alas    air couldn't care less if weren't speaking language  pho broth itself okay but nothing worth coming back for  I'd rather drive extra 10 15 minutes elsewhere place value business  Also place looked large outside but outward appearance deceiving  <EOR> Excited see another Pho open nearby where live!  am comparing Rainbow Pho Express other two near joints Jenni Pho Bamboo Bistro  Service excellent  greeted asked food thanked when left   service already exceeded employees would Jenni   food made fresh won't worry your food being microwaved   did know that? heard chef cooking  Unlike Bamboo bistro microwaved chicken time   place because new more importantly place clean   place another restaurant worth supports locals   recommend place anyone  <EOR> Great pho!!! Plus close home am glad place open  am tired Jenni pho down street portion size shrinks lack service   place take credit card jenni pho don't also already reason place more  Service 5 stars Pho 5 stars Egg rice 5 stars Bun update later am waiting now hehe Spring roll update <EOR> There lot pho restaurants town but probably eat most often   come when want super quick meal   broth very flavorful just right amount saltiness   bun really good too   only downside restaurant space long narrow aren't any windows  <EOR> I many many pho places vegas  place definitely bad  goto pho place town since very close house food always comes fast  spring rolls always fresh! <EOR> This usual take place  must black property steak  Yumm!!! Unfortunately tried other dishes vermicelli pretty much puked out  Taste extremely off me  recommend everything else menu except vermicelli <EOR> I husband   order banh cuon rice roll plater 20 min later waitress came back  told don't ready serve although menu   She recommended order pho instead   thought should try anyway but isnt any flavor all  regret come here   re very unprofessional service suck  come back recommend anyone try it   Horrible!    P S even over charged us! But caught it  <EOR> so    express   very slow   aren't rude all realized enough waitresses accommodate everyone express mode chilled chit chatted   decor nice    very clean but still very new   very small but always find smallest places serve best food!   we walk friendly    small waitress took awhile even give water   [i guess im just used someone giving water right when come other joints ]  so turn around try wave two waitresses down let them know we're ready 10 minutes    she comes table let know only few more minutes   she apologizes     1st timers we're forgiving     we finally order food came quickly   but!  forgot husbands soup   again another 10 minutes husband finally gets hold waitress she apologizes again grabs soup    my order seafood noodle MORE seafood please!  little skimp fillers but plenty broth noodles   broth really good though!  but needs more shrimp squid    maybe some fish?   kids shrimp bbq shredded pork plate beef noodle soup    both which kids said very good   the food really good   service other hand    questionable   only 1 serving water when asked check she finally realizes didn't water    another apology   maybe another waitress? idk    but all all food very good! <EOR> I can't say loved place    This pho place located small strip mall off strip someplace Rainbow  group all craving pho especially because hungover  plenty parking lot  place pretty busy when group 6 in  owners quickly pushed few tables together seat large group  little while all knew wanted order  say pho place slightly expensive but maybe  comparing westminster garden grove prices? ordered Pho Tai pho rare beef slices because eat intestines tendon whatever usual Pho is   One few drawbacks place slow service  say TOOK FOREVER PHO come out  None helpful especially since HUNGOVER  When food finally came pretty good  little disappointing because 2 friends ordered theirs without any cilantro it  But low behold both pho soups TONS cilantro it    Another thing confused confusion over check  wanted pay 2 phos some eggrolls took cashier 10 minutes calculate off entire check  Other pretty decent  best Pho   but worst  Would come again? Maybe if staying friend's house again  <EOR> I compare all pho Pho 1 but being all way down spring mountain being southwest its trek gas prices rise  being said definitely return  broth flavorful Pho 1 but good potstickers good hubby #52 good   Nice clean simple restaurant   People friendly nice   only two patrons may why attentive but regardless very nice love supporting local business   Happy eating till next time! <EOR> This place literally block house girlfriend never Pho before picking slight cold thought we'd try instead driving all way Chinatown    BAD DECISION  feel terrible allowing first pho experience miserable establishment    The service TERRIBLE  terrible pho restaurant with usual slow service standpoint  maybe four other tables seated when inside  table directly behind 6 people interacting waiters if knew another friends  definitely spoke same language female waiter LITERALLY table least 5 6 SEPARATE times speak them laugh them clear plates etc  She finally came table threw two menus down walked away without saying word  male waiter then came over brought two waters  He least friendly smiling  She Jekyll Hyde way she treated versus other guests restaurant    When she came back another 10 minutes later ordered pot stickers rare beef steak pho chicken pho  Again she did say word just stared wrote down order then grabbed menus walked away    Our food came fast give them star that  give another star taste even though wasn't amazing  broth delicious but meat tender  tough rare cut into awkwardly big pieces    My girlfriend enjoyed pho but didn't eat any chicken because tough was    We asked male waiter bring check he did within few seconds  Then course took female waitress another 10 minutes take debit card  another 5 minutes bring back me  Meanwhile she's laughing sitting table directly behind us    There NOTHING hate more being treated order my money my table doesn't matter  Terrible customer service nothing but TERRIBLE reviews eventually no business all  <EOR> U  hear  real nice place food amazing when u ask Vivian she Icing cake place <EOR> I driving mood pho lunch   Kinda middle nowhere order egg rolls   came way herbs lettuce   followed bowl combo pho   Broth good well portions   also supplied plenty herbs sprouts  Service little slow but friendly    Definitely worth return trip <EOR> This simply best SW   stream lined Pho house Jenny Pho just street but full menu Vietnamese restaurant attached drive thru!  think if stick just Pho soup missing place offer!  authentic gets outside China Town  <EOR> Love close house but food ok   Fresh Spring Rolls very presentable peanut sauce pretty good   Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio vermicelli noodles thick kind  didn't absorb fish sauce well leaving bland  sure each bite meat flavor but much noodles enough meat   Che Ba Mau potential but red beans undercooked  However serve shaved ice which plus  <EOR> the pho really really really bland  even gave them second chance today  Fail    their service great either    Oh well    BUT! BBQ meats darn good!!!! love love love those dishes!!!! definitely come back those! <EOR> By far best Viet place SW side town crushing all competition Rainbow     The biggest downside wait but came when slammed which good sign    service good food made wait   I really enjoyed pho broth   Many other broth's Spring Mtn aren't memorable taste extremely watered down but broth rich flavor sweetness it   If find broth little sweet balance siracha red chili paste   In addition pho standard shrimp spring roll   made fresh presentation probably best ever seen cut diagonal standing garnish   The Ca Kho Clay pot Fish damm good bold flavor   Portion wise smaller used but taste spot ate all rice   those haven't tried there's alot bones which standard dish   Just careful  thought really good   They serve Bo Luc Lac shaking beef many other Vietnamese traditional favorites    I'll back sure   just little patient if they're busy   4 5 stars  <EOR> It good local pho restaurant  Everything far very good  broth little less fatty however does taste good  Since live SW great decent pho restaurant need drive all way China town  Bum very fresh yummy!! <EOR> Good pho  Jenni pho spot SW what's but down bit  waitress used work jenni pho now pho rainbow express  She choice words former employer    As food place good  Broth good really good  Place clean  Only negative meat cut huge n very hard eat  If meats pho dac biet smaller n easier eat if give 5 stars  <EOR> Good food price but bun bo hue bit thin watery <EOR> I'm excited place opens don't drive china town Vietnamese food   It's cute little place very spacious many tables  atmosphere nice decoration  table actually kinda small hungry people us   The service extremely nice n helpful  The food good but use little improvement bit more salty sweeter  <EOR> So happy great Pho place opened southwest!! love spring rolls fried rice wrapped egg plain pho <EOR> Good tasting pho!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE 324 365 What's Phokin' Smell!?!? <EOR> The food absolutely amazing  service however DREADFUL if you're non Vietnamese speaking   My boyfriend live complex houses right behind place often  Every time gone service terribly slow  male waiter barely speaks any English tell he hesitant talk because he can't understand 75% we're saying  He often sit tables watching TV without bothering help us   They frequently mess orders well  usually order spring rolls ask NO MINT  I'd say probably ordered appetizer roughly 7 times they've only remembered take mint twice  aforementioned male waiter didn't understand all when tried explain didn't want any mint leaves spring rolls  also asked where bathrooms once  He no idea saying  You'd think he'd least learn word bathroom pretty important word   When take drink orders usually just ask water  They've never actually gotten water first try  wait someone walk ask water now? before bother getting us   Ordering pickup unpleasant experience well  often order lemon grass chicken dinner supposed come rice small soup  Twice ordered pickup when home no soup  Finally third time ordered meal pickup checked take out bag advance  Sure enough no soup  said Excuse but doesn't meal come soup? girl working asked want soup? if making special request  like   yeah want soup supposed COME meal   Of course noticed Vietnamese families walk great service  wait staff stand several minutes talking laughing them  understand natural seek kinship people speak your native tongue but establishment isn't located predominantly Vietnamese speaking area  fact I'd say most people area white Hispanic  just downright rude show natural favoritism towards group another  especially annoying because coming least twice week since opened still act complete stranger every time come in  Come Rainbow Pho all white people really all look same you?  The only reason tolerate crap service because food just good  lemon grass chicken peppered beef dinners die for  pho so so but enough added chili sauce also extremely good  chicken curry soup also amazing  deeply saddened food mind numbingly great but service terribly bad  almost wish food sub par excuse stop coming here  <EOR> It's express but tastes good!  find fairly difficult find Pho place Vegas tastes authentic   Rainbow Pho Express pretty authentic!  Reminds Pho places love back San Jose CA where know Pho authentic because number Vietnamese residents reside there   My items order course Special Combination Pho soup fried egg rolls come w lettuce wrap dip fish sauce ultimate favorite vermicelli bowl equipped grilled shrimp fried egg rolls   rice plates pork chop real good too   Everything flavorful love Pho broth no need add sauces just some lime jalapeno little kick!  abundance veggies vermicelli bowl which why its favorite!
