The toppings all great especially aged goat cheddar   tell little different your normal cheddar   garlic chive aioli mellow garlic taste   Besides hoping bacon little bit crispier Gold Standard really burger  burger world   just very tasty burger see why popular!  I also tried bit Rising Sun well Korean Bull gogi   Rising Sun more Asian fusion burger teriyaki glaze tempura avocado sits top burger   also Kobe beef patty whole burger velvety smooth texture thanks fatty patty smooth creamy avocado!  would bit more teriyaki sauce though   As Korean Bull gogi burger patty marinated give extra flavor   best part definitely fried egg sits top   resist egg yolk just running all over kimchi slaw beef patty??  Out all fries liked steak cut fries most   Crunchy exterior creamy potato center   Onion rings great well   shoestring fries little stale me   Now shakes part its name knew try few shakes ended getting Black Cow Float Frozen Grasshopper   Black Cow Float fun somewhat nostalgic shake since more coke flat ice cream rather true shake   even comes pop rocks!  Frozen Grasshopper must any mint chocolate fans   Smooth creamy minty frozen goodness   both shakes could taste alcohol but pretty well masked!  They also bunch beers draft   Bosteels Triple Karmeliet good one!

The Place As mentioned Holstein's located Cosmopolitan centrally located everything else  fairly easy find doesn't require great deal navigation  Casino's Vegas tend very large trying find restaurant within challenge within itself but Holstein's wasn't hard spot  first glance place itself looks glorified cafe restaurant very open terms people outside restaurant being able look in  decor pretty modern bar pretty good size there's also seemed impromptu lounge area right front bar people come sit couches socialize while still being able enjoy menu drinks  lounge being right front bar didn't look all comfortable appealing however right group people right amount drinks sure would fine most haha  Because sat bar didn't chance see rest restaurant however kitchen looks exposed people look action going back house customer  always interesting nice see  bad Holstein's  **** 4 5 Stars ****  The Service I Vegas conference came Holstein's right last session ended which around 5 00pm Thursday  unfortunately no hostess greet me however chalk them being particularly busy probably running around  No biggie end gonna end sitting bar anyways which did however if party hoping table having no hostess front would certainly question  found open seat bar immediately most friendliest faces seen during visit Vegas  She entertaining down earth willing talk everyone bar wasn't afraid razzle folks try them smile which didn't mind all  great service continued throughout making sure taken care when she leave day she made every effort sure ok gave next bartender updates all guests which always nice see rather someone leaving next person dark  Great service Holstein's shout Bridgot making trip Holstein's wonderful!! ***** 5 5 Stars *****  The Food Just any other burger joints located Vegas many different options choose from  Each burger its own signature ingredient level appeal everyone  being said it'll pretty difficult someone find burger sounds delicious many different burgers indulge in  settled Nom Nom Burger See Picture decided served some onion rings instead fries  First onion rings  Definitely best onion rings life probably tell just came bag freezer however job done satisfied craving them  Nom Nom Burger which kobe beef cheddar cheese 1000 Island Dressing potato chips yes   potato chips    don't lie say never put potato chips your cold cut sandwiches kid    I don't care EVERYONE did would swear best thing ever! Haha   burger perfectly cooked cheddar cheese 1000 Island Dressing gave zest creaminess needed then finally homemade potato chips did cold cut sandwiches gave textural difference crunchiness always desire food  only gripe potato chips no flavor them literally just crunch wish would've seasoned them something pop more  Other fairly satisfied selection  Good job Holstein's  **** 4 5 Stars ****  Overall Like said comparing burgers BurGR Holstein's would definitely choose BurGR however if happen Cosmo mood having burger strikes place definitely deliver  look forward coming back trying other options Gold Standard Burger but all all shabby Holstein's!

I El Machete because love spicy food  burger prepared well medium rare quite kick  Really really good burger better back home   The atmosphere good if little loud little pricey burger joint but think worth it  <EOR> Average best  Debated taking extra star off due bartender serving mixed beer  place serves craft beer should know when keg runs out  bartender  keg needed changed 1 4 way into pour glass  Does he say changing keg your beer minute would some water while wait? Nope  He continues pour foam into glass let settle squeezing every ounce keg  Finally he tops last 1 4 beer new beer grabs straw stirs beer hoping won't notice  10 minutes later bottom keg soured beer no head  He says take off bill because wait  couldn't even drink beer off tasting  Needless say won't back  food isn't good enough  Vegas I'd rather somewhere better service food  many great options settle mediocre  <EOR> Sam very best!!!

Every burger also comes side fries  ordered sweet potato fries but gave regular skinny fries instead  didn't mind because nice crispy but once let them know mistake brought sweet potato fries immediately which nice  also ordered Frozen Grasshopper which alcoholic milk shakes peppermint chocolate  also delicious could taste alcohol all   Tip if check in foursquare show your server give free pint draft beer! we beer very smooth did taste cheap all Overall very nice experience  loved cute cartoony cow deco all around restaurant  server even made point stop wish safe drive back California when standing line bathroom which even close table  thought very nice gesture topped off visit very well  <EOR> I've heard lot good things place  wish didn't hear because expectations really high while burgers pretty good wouldn't wild over it  manager nice enough allow reservation 19 people 6 PM Saturday    definitely star well earned there     The service very good   Warren took very good care enthusiastic whole time  loved excitement spirit he just top it   There's another two star there   I ordered Gold Standard $18 added fried egg $1 avocado $2 subbed fries sweet potato fries $2    ordered Medium Rare because love beef mooing bloody same time   expectation would come way   20 30 minutes later meals udder disappointment or shall say udder disappointment burger came Medium Well   Ewww   Ground cardboard   While burger still good having medium rare could made much better probably best burgers   just good amazing   only group 19 issue   least 5 others stated also ordered burgers medium rare came Medium well Well done guy ordered well medium medium rare burger   Um   that made no sense but maybe cooks having off day   $21 hoping orgasm mouth         I didn't any shakes because into shakes but lot friends loved theirs      I would rule place completely but can't give bragging rights either   still prefer Red Robin  burgers over experience Holstein's consensus amongst group   Good burgers but poor execution   would try place again just because might having off day but general I'd still Cheeseburger Paradise Red Robin   We'll try again later Holstein's! <EOR> I opted El Machete b c wanted little kick burger  didn't expect monstrosity burger get  Lucky hungry but even then barely polished off  made absolutely no dent fries but don't normally care them anyway   As burger big juicy perfectly cooked  toppings really bonus time  IMHO something probably want split someone especially if you're considering shake it  massive! <EOR> As vegas local love trying new places    took stars away mainly service  booked reservation 2 8 15   showed bit earlier quickly seated us  asked water lemon few moments look over menu  Water came back no lemon  very weird vibe waitress annoyed her  ordered classic medium rare American cheese onion rings  burger came back when cut burger half   blood came patty   Definitely medium rare rare beyond belief  Since starving did want commotion send back  Despite patty being undercooked onion rings delicious  date french fries those good  If review strictly based food would give 4 stars minus undercooked beef patty  portions enough fill casual atmosphere  back probably just ask medium cooked hamburger instead   **reading other reviews did complimentary popcorn  little disappointing  <EOR> Their food amazing large portions definitely worth wait   shakes reasonably priced large size   certainly share since they're large   service also very attentive  <EOR> If sixth sense would recognizing great beef  Holsteins burgers definitely hit mark beef category  would give nod over Burger Bar  Opted Gold Standard great choice  Pair shakes had Oreo something Last Meal worthy   It helped during commercial break game attractive lady behind bar attention  Ooowee <EOR> The service pretty good but calamari chips not  chips taste stale calamari chewy tasted fake  Wouldn't eat again  <EOR> Just average burger so so shake  food no means bad but better burgers elsewhere  <EOR> This place located Aria across Marquee  told top burger spots strip weren't lying  would recommend ordering appetizers if you're going burgers because burgers themselves really filling   I steakhouse burger which OMG meat patty melts your mouth  drool party each different things but everyone said pretty amazing  fries could little better but other disappointed  wait also significantly less BurgR across way  <EOR> The draw place alcoholic milkshakes  $11 thought they'd stronger food would better would more enjoyable  waited while table despite being many open tables   and when sat down table dirty    There plenty toppings available your burger include cheeses all sorts things  If think probably available put your burger  However disappointed mom's food liking made even want mine  She opted order lobster roll salad tasted pretty rancid you could argue place Buns name orders salad but hey    if just bought pair Louboutins Christmas order whatever hell want!

Burgers well portioned filling   I would definitely recommend restaurant!!!! <EOR> This place did live expectations   browsed yelp reviews looked through menu prior getting really excited try selection but most left disappointed   Luckily think best burger bunch The Rising Sun Burger!    The Rising Sun Burger Asian inspired burger loved sweet salty flavors   fried avocado addition tempura added wonderful element it   also added additional egg mine   However think key GREAT burger meat patty where Holsteins fell short ALL burgers   Mine supposedly kobe beef patty but would've never known difference because in n out serves better patty   asked wanted patties cooked all medium rare but all overcooked   patties tasted dry flavorless   Our group shared two appetizers Lobster Mac 'n Cheese Wings   Both mediocre   mac 'n cheese runny barely any lobster portion tiny   worth high price tag   wings your standard wings think Wingstop wings just good   Although didn't order friends said alcoholic shakes didn't even taste any alcohol them   might well ordered regular non alcoholic shakes elsewhere fraction cost   Cool concept but execution fell short  <EOR> The first time came bachelor party  sitting lounge area bar doing some drinking unbeknownst waitresses scantily clad sporting massive jugs  food second   So we're sitting down waitress right behind friend Zach  She says Would guys any drinks? Zach swiveled around answer accidentally face full 36 F's  unintentional motorboat  Great life moment  Also little hostess tongue ring highly attractive librarian kind way know she also owns thigh high boots    na'mean? I'd shake those buns  I'd let hold stein  eyes open lights on  Mmmmhmmm darlin'   The shakes  shakes insanity glass  ordered Compost shake immediately wanted vomit  mean best way possible  Think excitement induced vomit  when married something  Actually  probably best analogy  trying say shakes incredibly rich tasty would recommend Compost shake anyone punishing themselves tastiness   The burgers  burger ate delicious no words describe it  best way describe would series guttural noises then pass face down into pile puppies  hadn't anything kobe burger long time just wanted  pants also wanted because came home bad kind stained pants  Messy burger   Two other things stood awesome art adorning walls waiter's enormous handlebar mustache  Good mate! <EOR> I know place known Burgers but sister didn't want burger decided should try some appetizers  ordered sweet potato fries buffalo chicken dip chips lobster steak quesadilla  word describe Quesadilla BOMB!!!!

Regular shake below average burger   I Brown Cow Float because love root beer   root beer float pretty good even chocolate pop rocks annoyingly popping mouth   did taste Smirnoff whipped cream vodka all though but judging slight warmth face something must there   Next Machete burger which Fire Roasted Anaheim Chili Borracho Onions Pepperjack Cheese Lettuce Tomato Onion Spicy 'Machete' Aioli   asked medium rare came medium   Quality beef seasoning didn't seem great   burger sounds spicy but isn't all   Bread bit dry   Our group also shared lobster mac 'n cheese buffalo wings which aren't worth going into detail for   Mac 'n cheese enough 2 4 people take couple bites overpriced   Buffalo wings standard   I've many good burgers some more some less time   Never let Holstein trick into paying $16 again   Never again! <EOR> I weekday lunch great service until waitress seemed disappear took literally 30 minutes end meal until able leave place because took long receive check   burgers shakes great although seemed some hidden add ons extras terms price  <EOR> Nice burger joint decent burgers  bit pricey but tastes good! shared lobster truffle Mac cheese starter which delicious  she Thai steak sallad really better could imagine  el machete burger super! would gotten 4 stars if wasn't high price    <EOR> The food service always great  only slight down side always TON food  shakes great though didn't time visited  If you're looking great burgers shakes well lot other good American food very good option! <EOR> Clever    I really liked place  fun  Cute different ideas place worth checking out  Its gonna blow your socks off but think you'll good time if you're serious everything  try being gourmet hip boozy on trend all decently   We no issues service but Monday stopped in  take its worth  Nobody rude waitress attentive everything came timely fashion   Drinks definitely worth 1 2 stars its own  call adult vitamins which drinks use Vitamin waters bases  Basically Vitamin water plus vodka gin some additional fruit juices  know sounds pretty ridiculous but why not?  tasty pleasant drinks long day  fairly strong  also offer milk shakes alcohol   you know want it!  If ever back place probably try out    Food Mostly burgers variations concept  good effort gourmet fusion y type burgers burgers made duck lamb etc  various ethinically inspired toppings   appreciate attempt but think if your place name type cow its name should probably offer least handful beef burgers    Anyways Classic which beef patty based burger cheese  fantastic! Perfectly cooked juicy  patty itself maybe touch more salt needed but when eaten bread condiments toppings its fine   bun nicely toasted buttery  Classic your standard burger lettuce tomato mayo ketchup onion   add varying cheeses number other toppings fried egg bacon mushrooms beef brisket etc     I offerings variety flavors palettes place appeal to  quality ingredients great  flavors nice  Food drinks made unabashedly  definitely come back if Cosmo  <EOR> Ok no joke probably best burger spot strip   Located inside Cosmo Holstein serves some some burgers unlike anywhere else  start off place looks awesome sure spent alot money as did everything Cosmo shows  plenty street art anime style graphics along old world leather feel dining area  Its definitely falls into stylish chic category  Plus giant cow entrance looks cool!

But warned ahead time its cheap nor quiet  burger fries shake easily going come spending $30+  Come monday weekend place packed loud everyone trying inside Marquee  <EOR> The last few years kicking foodie habit into overdrive probably made bit snobby but truly surprised many saying Holstein's dished best burger some ever had  burger fine but certainly wasn't anything above beyond A OK    Star 1 service atmosphere?  The highlight visit Holstein's without doubt service atmosphere which complimented obviously excellent location  rolled later side Thursday evening walked several times over course weekend while crowded rarely wait which refreshing  bartender doubling server excellent left feeling good experience even though food didn't blow away  Star Granted    Star 2 portions relative cost?  While $15 threshold sit down burger any kind often pretty hard ceiling going relent when comes Vegas prices strip  Steakhouse Burger side fries came $18 00 while would normally enough take good critical look star no choice but chalk cost Vegas premium  Star Granted    Stars 3 4 food?  Honestly Steakhouse Burger just okay which bit letdown given impressive laundry list ingredients peripherals  black pepper crusted patty some very good flavor but simply small given size quantity other toppings lofty bun  mixed greens well proprietary steak sauce but marmalade onions overpowering point where didn't really even realize wild mushrooms swiss cheese mix    Probably low point meal french fries which soft limp tasting though came frozen bag didn't add anything equation  Single Star Granted    Star 5 Would eat every day if could?  Holstein's probably worth visit but can't recommend over some other options town  No Star Granted  <EOR> Great burgers EXCELLENT onion rings shakes all amazing!!! Highly recommend! <EOR> The food amazing ordered gold standard burger which cooked liking  also ordered chocolate strawberry malt milkshake  didn't receive popcorn water until food being served  kind sucked would nice time eat popcorn before meal something wash down with  But other no issues you'd expect pay strip $18 burger $9 milkshake   pretty busy but service didn't take horribly long  would definitely eat again  <EOR> I originally waiting line Wicked Spoon but wait long  saw Holsteins short wait always wanted try Holsteins' freak shake jumped buffet waiting line Holsteins instead!  *'Urth' vegan burger 5 5 burger world good!

There's crispy pork burns table   first pork bun Ippudo NYC   understood hype within seconds ordered second   pork buns Holsteins didn't let relive moment   much hoisin sauce which made overly salty   Oh pork also dry     Our waiter actually pretty nice   However service slow   restaurant full saw constantly filling orders could sympathize   usually destroy burgers leave nothing but just couldn't finish burger pork buns   Salt used very liberally  <EOR> I'm giving 3 stars popcorn birthday cake shake booze n shake ah yeah service wasn't very good and dead lunch server just didn't seem want wasn't friendly disappointing Vegas restaurant  burgers tasty but worth price imo  I'd boozy shake popcorn anytime <EOR> First time tried place back October last year before celebrating Halloween knew come back since family staying Cosmopolitan! am pretty sure ordered rising sun medium both times added bacon fried egg first time second BOTH WORTH IT! tried shakes know some might think dairy alcohol won't mix anticipate trip bathroom but hellllla good add extra shots does creep ya! Don't knock til' try it! tried red velvet smore's shakes both good but prefer smores! did appreciate waitress wish name   family came deep we're loud way when more family showed easily accommodated them did give hard time all it! SO    yes would reccommend place! <EOR> 3 5 but rounding because Lindeman's Framboise   yeah $14 but  really only couple dollars more cocktail LA     the kalbi beef kimchi quesadilla delicious!  lobster roll   yeah twice haven't actually ordered burger but everyone else table did all happy   prepared spend $20 your burger toppings tax tip but hey vegas   cosmopolitan   fits     service spotty   decor cute   restroom inside restaurant which most restaurants vegas hotels don't  convenient  <EOR> Holy milkshake! Amazing shakes sure only negative should've split shakes between 2 but nonetheless DRUNKEN MONKEY best shake <EOR> My gf ordered strawberry milkshake truffle lobster mac cheese mexican car bombs gold standard burger The gold standard burger tasted any other burger restaurant  Nothing special opinion  mac cheese tasted bit bland me  mexican car bomb ok  gave 4 pieces bacon wrapped peppers stuffed cheese corn  Sad say felt strawberry milkshake highlight meal!  Service excellent!  Enjoyed atmosphere place  Love cartoon drawings cows hehehe Overall wouldn't way eat again if Vegas but recommend try once while Vegas! <EOR> Inattentive servers seemed more worried looking cute then service  ordered gold standard burger which good but just ok coke  group 6 some reason burger wasn't delivered until everyone table finished meal  Also never given coke asking multiple times  When bill everyone separate checks coke still when brought servers attention she said she would take care it  then brought change coke to go container still bill  addition auto gratuity $30  worth it! recommend Gordan Ramsey Burgr across street Planet Hollywood! <EOR> Best burgers Vegas   Gold Standard classic!!! shakes new favorite part restaurant though  coffee cake shake die fact mix bacon chocolate simply blows your mind  <EOR> My friends decided come thought Eggslut closed  seated pretty fast saw restaurant wasn't busy all  waiter came around friendly  all asked waters  Twenty minutes later three waters  He says sorry can't count  bring another right away  fifteen minutes past ask someone appeared manager another water  He quickly brought another water which thankful for  Anyways took another ten minutes order  Now once did did food until probably 30 40 minutes  waiter seen talking another server against wall  couldn't tell if he flirting appeared but way he never came table once  friend's water spilled everyone except server table helping us  kind man dry off table  sure happens often but again grateful man  waiter finally comes food says back fill those waters  He never comes back until absolutely finished food  fries great but Kobe beef dry completely finished waters  ask another server server refill waters  Seriously? Mind restaurant busy all  irritated server  only time he asked if needed anything when absolutely done food  waiter later audacity ask friend check $6 if wanted change back since he gave waiter $20  Seriously again? $14 tip when never came table flirting your co worker never seen busy restaurant  He instant give large tip  course going tip him  assuming he thought since aren't older looking wouldn't tip  should've done tip before ask taken care of  Lesson learned always tip first  Thanks Carlo seriously amazing  <EOR> Was best burger ever had?  Nope but darn good! loved location upscale setting hostess wait staff  All together provided awesome dining experience  definitely wanted give shout wait staff  Being business trip budget stick three separate checks both credit cash transactions  When told waiter met No problem   definitely appreciated that! Food burger patty could tell very fresh  think heard Moo kitchen! Excellent meat bun ratio  Probably 6+ ounces better  really nice variety topping please everyone  fries very good well  really liked all shakes listed menu could order without booze  opted without capture true flavor did disappoint   Overall thought location setting price point spot on  think paid right around $20 bucks burger fries  brother added shake came around $27  If staying Cosmo would more likely return again but many burger choices around Vegas most likely move sample other spots well  Highly recommended worth trip check them out! <EOR> The most extensive list alcoholic non alcoholic milkshakes seen  bit expensive but Vegas strip don't really expect deals while dining here    Haven't tried burgers yet but definitely recommend giving place try if love milkshakes!

Came last Friday night restaurant wait sat bar  Big mistake  Bartenders no clue doing  greeted menus then ignored good 15 minutes  When finally guys attention he told he Bar back would send bartender over  never came left  would think cosmopolitan service would top notch but case  <EOR> If reviewed based food alone wow!  Best tasting burger while! No doubt    I made reservation 830 but don't think really needed it  knew wanted burger Cosmopolitan Restaurant double entendre Nom Nom but no 1000 Island  Mayo sucks    I cooked medium rare juicy! butter baby!   Our waitress alright but goodness prices   when you're Vegas KT PERRY WUZ RITE OMGZ    The dessert menu looked awesome all shakes malts but already paid 30 including tip since added salad mushrooms fried egg burger  No doubt good but gotta hit prices ya crappin?     I'd back especially if didn't pay  Kobe burger ! <EOR> First time The Rising Sun wasn't spectacular all  hoping better burger  Nothing special   just gourmet burger place whole bag salt  burger way salty   thought trying overdose salt    point where could stop drinking water meal  good casual place eat  <EOR> I last night  right around 12 started Late Night menu  Which two shakes Drunkin Monkey alcoholic non alcoholic Vanilla non alcoholic     DRINKS Drunkin monkey AMAZING! extra shot $3  didn't but friend did delicious  shake off piece banana dipped chocolate good sized chunk chocolate top  Vanilla shake gets white chocolate top    FOOD Late Night menu basically snacks but also offer two burgers which listed  Regular cheese burger bacon cheeseburger  cheeseburger good  Meat cooked well liking pretty big  couldn't finish it  Also tried Poutine French fries topped shredded beef cheese gravy side! Very good but dig around cheese  Still amazing though   ATMOSPHERE Since 12 dining area closed just bar which does offer first come seating  There's 30 spots bar around 7 tables behind it  dj right behind bit loud but Vegas expect  service great server can't remember name but blonde tall skinny VERY sweet  She updated food while waited top refills  She's fantastic!  Overall great experience  4 stars instead 5 because didn't say Yelp close restaurant give different menu 12  <EOR> Arrived just before end happy hour ordered shakes burgers  happy hour menu very limited which told  shakes huge pretty  s'mores chocolate vodka  $15 apiece because happy hour specific shakes grossly overpriced  burgers nothing special  Both over cooked medium rare barmaid couldn't given shit service  gold standard should the lame predictable   $18 definitely worth money  also list Kobe burger menu  don't think really but anytime over cook burger destroys integrity  back  <EOR> This best burger joint seen long time  Everything delicious  friends share joy around  <EOR> Wow  never eaten such true delicious filling bigger joint! These burgers may pricier side but size taste WELL worth it! If Cosmo highly recommend try out  This books!!! <EOR> I staying Cosmopolitan didn't feel leaving hotel day decided try Holsteins   First let tell try house lager   pretty depressing should ashamed attach name something tastes weak   I ordered rising sun burger which Kobe beef teriyaki glaze nori furikake crispy yam spicy mayo tempura avocado   put Kobe Beef quotes because reality can't REAL Kobe beef anywhere outside Japan great job FALSE ADVERTISING guys!  The burger itself average   sweet potato fries excellent however   Considering relatively expensive meal burger fries beer don't think I'd ever come back establishment because just didn't impress all much   Nothing wrong but just worth it   Oh would disservice establishment if didn't mention this     while sitting bar waiting food lady kept walking EXTREMELY short shorts so short butt cheeks literally hanging out    didn't problem all especially considering Vegas girl great hind quarters but didn't realize she waitress Holsteins until walking place  <EOR> Rising sun gold standard amazing!!! Rising sun little sweet but gold standard perfect  Expensive ass burgers but very well worth it  Tasteful full juice flavor  usually meat medium rare but waitress recommend rare stating medium rare would really red bloody  Ummmmmm red enough! Burgers still good but wished more red  Staff very friendly no wait all during lunch time  Fries weren't great but need try shakes next time  <EOR> Great burgers chicken sandwiches  Shake option unique tasty  Reasonable pricing  <EOR> We came outrageous shakes disappointed   fat boy appetizers   yummy   Chicken dip truffle fries good  <EOR> Really nice place  Great families friends  known shakes chance trying two them  Coffee Donuts good but Drunken Monkey BOMB!!!!!!!! banana milkshake reeses cups  good ended getting again togo last day  literally way walked MGM Holsteins just lol   I rising sun their burger which really good  Very flavorful rich filling fries good too  I'd say solid 8 10 burger 9 10 10 Drunken Monkey <EOR> I took dessert group National Milkshake Day  easy reservation staff very helpful that   The milkshakes themselves fantastic  personally Almond Joy coconut rum    SO GOOD!! Food good but nothing rush try   My only biggest complaint volume  busy but literally yell person next just regular conversation  big pet peeves restaurant would want return  know isn't restaurants fault really but crazy   I would say check them if happen Cosmopolitan or if National Milkshake Day                The shakes fabulous  delicious huge beautiful  feast eyes just much your taste buds  over top impressive if guests town  really belong Vegas   My problem place food just average course pay Strip prices it   On last trip 2 shakes The S'mores Grasshopper 2 orders fries paid $60 tip  feel  little ridiculous  <EOR> We sat bar grab quick lunch bite  bartender very friendly great suggestions  Lobster mac n cheese awesome  bucket buffalo wings hit miss some pieces dry others perfectly cooked  sure gets done if into fryer all same time but oh well did  Didn't chance try shakes but pretty decent selection beers wine    There red wine particular funky artsy label Italy can't remember name but very palatable  If Vegas again sure pit stop try some other stuff  <EOR> If want good place grab burger shake trip   We came shakes overwhelmingly good  loved atmosphere really fun <EOR> The food great here!    Pros Sweet Potato Fries Pumpkin Pie Milkshake they even give leftovers side another cup Grilled Chicken sandwich Salmon Onion Rings  Cons The popcorn give beginning kick ready chug water! <EOR> Who would thought could really crave burger? wanting try new burger place Cosmopolitan some time  didn't chance weekend before but past week did  Marquee Day club friends headed over waited 25 minutes  When seated server quickly came took order drinks  all light weight alcoholic girls place drink  milkshakes alcoholic but only contains 1 oz alcohol  many  way less  But give Peaches N' Creme! trying all flavors don't worry  tasted no alcohol all  But love fact knowing drinking Vegas still  I Rising Sun burger  huge patty some tempura pieces avocado  Avocado always burger better  gave options shoestring fries steak cut fries  Uhh   SHOESTRINGS FRIES course  absolutely love shoestrings fries all fries  top also ordered Holsteins cobb salad  sure keep food light if going all pool parties know  cobb  sure why people don't think worth it  did note avocado slices ripe    We decent service  Could better because don't come around check much  actually waved down waitress couple times  But busy afternoon  food good convenient being right across Marquee 2nd floor  pricey but gourmet burgers always double digits expected  <EOR> So here's thing love place but teetering 3 stars  If 3 5 I'd give that  When FIRST visited place long opened raved told everyone amazing was   burgers very good  Very very good   But gone handful times now last few kind embarrassed raved much guests brought us  server last two times hasn't offered locals discount even though introduced ourselves locals when sat down   first time didn't know another server asked if discount  second time pointed bill he back took off   But guy served last two times while nice enough more interested chatting hostesses bringing popcorn refilling water pretty much anything  seated corner if wanted anyone's attention we'd poke heads around side flag down   He or kitchen can't sure slathered turkey burger Russian dressing despite asking side twice  fact server whole conversation something Could please Russian dressing side all? look want not? Look FLO don't want all just trying flexible  Instead wait while friends ate could de Russian turkey burger which if being honest wasn't great  The turkey burger sliders also snooze skip 'em  My other beef no pun intended place volume  appreciate Vegas people par tay etc but I'd eat dinner without having scream across table  dining room even lounge area where seriously hearing damage territory bass rumbles under your ass while you're trying enjoy your sliders  just jam speak   I highly recommend Gold Standard Steakhouse burger both which delectable worth every penny  wedge cut fries well   Two friends told Captain Hook salmon burger also really good     Other high points decor interesting creative aside lackluster server occasional snooty hostess staff warm welcoming  menu expanded well they've lot interesting choices  They're great social media too  Love that     Overall really Holstein's am rather bummed review way A year ago would've least 4  <EOR> Extremely good milkshakes huge portions   ordered B W wife ordered some birthday cake shake alcohol   She preferred mine but both very good   come second helping metal container even better   Far more could consume   The burgers cooked perfectly   When wife orders something well done order medium usually expect ours cooked properly Holstein's both cooked exactly asked for   Finally know nit picky thing but hard time finding good onion rings   know perfect combination onion breading ration ones where onion doesn't separate bread immediately when bite into Holstein's they've nailed it  <EOR> Good burger  Amazing service  sat bar but hydrating result prior evening  waitress it! glasses never even 1 3 empty! Great people watching all those line club nice view chandelier  Would try again  <EOR> Holsteins must visit when anywhere near Cosmo   burgers lovely beer selection please anyone looking something light different heavy ish fare    I've visited place three times now while Vegas business disappointed  case Vegas    service efficient although slightly oblivious  wait staff put own priorities busy restaurant above interrupting mid sentence check if everything okay     but check place always nuts    can't really fault it   I've tried couple burgers quite artful  sliders milkshakes exhausting four day conference totally hit home  Yum!  Two visits large groups everyone pleased meals  all few months ago don't specific recommendations food you    but orders pretty diverse   The place super loud kind upper mid scale Vegas Tourist atmosphere  use word Tourist because clientele diversity ranged families kids frat boys    despite meal enjoyable while slightly lower scale service slight annoyance    forgivable given business trip colleagues   Good groups friends looking excellent burgers beer interesting soft drinks   Not somewhere I'd ever bring date to    but  just me  <EOR> Yum!! loved menu place  cosmopolitan interesting! menu items pizza twinkies chicken waffles burger fried avocados sweet potato onion straws  also blue moon seasonal available well variety other interesting microbrews  Very little wait accomodate group 5 Friday night  only complaint casino restaurant vegas tiny bathrooms only 1 toilet   Lots people drunk drinking vegas wouldnt want wait line bathroom although am sure others close by  Oh allowed take drinks ordered chandelier bar across hall while waited  suck them down quickly order seated  <EOR> We stopped Holsteins dinner hoping would more casual faster dining experience some other options area  Maybe haven't looked hard enough but very few fast casual dining options near City Center don't involve sandwiches hot dogs    Anyway Tuesday night  Even though place pretty dead service spotty  server wasn't super friendly but she job done  food came pretty quickly    I ordered Urth Burger which vegan burger  fine  patty thick moist  only complaint burger itself bit dry  supposed come avocado but only light green schmear buns    The boy ordered traditional burger  He seemed love it  He pretty much devoured whole thing    Both orders came fries  He natural cut fries ordered sweet potato fries  When fries first came cold soggy  sent them back kitchen new batch    His natural cut fries way better sweet potato fries  sweet potato fries cut thin most fries overcooked burnt    Prices typical places Vegas  two burgers shake spent nearly $40 including tip    If place back Austin I'd probably never again but since Vegas guess gets pass  <EOR> This really best burgers strip!

Service server always attentive came back couple times refill water no complaints!  But shame offering shake dessert menu! probably gained 1377384893 pounds but shake oh worth it!  Final Verdict best burger places EVER tried! <EOR> Great choice!! Memphis Burger filling very tasty  Holstein's brew which PBR  exactly needed start 2 day stay  did ask PBR waitstaff told Holsteins PBR  <EOR> If mood burger place  serve only traditional beef burgers but foodie approach burger concept unique mixings  Pork belly salmon pulled pork etc    Don't wrong its burger place just your usual burger place   I basically stole daughter's Oreo milkshake perfect  wife enjoyed son's root beer float well    I judge places following can't wait back 5 star would back without question 4 star would give second chance if no other options 3 star wouldn't back 2 star would rather starve 1 star   4 star place  <EOR> The food definitely great but service received superb! wish remembered name waitress because she definitely deserves kudos   We arrived quick bite eat before Marquee day club Easter weekend  heard place great burgers milkshakes but course going before pool party  opted ahi tuna salad dressing side    We walked two modelo beers hand she asked drink those inside bar but she would give two cups put those left restaurant meanwhile she kept them cold fridge     My Ahi tuna salad delicious! Perfectly well prepared no regrets end it  definitely return indulge burger but unfortunately wasn't position time around    Tip check yelp redeem discounted drink! <EOR> Arrived around 9 45am find no waiting crowd very prompt service  ordered brunch menu food within 10 minutes   I egg sandwich which very filling delicious  tater tots side nice touch  <EOR> I 2 1 2 meals the 1 2 quick appetizer grabbed while staying Cosmopolitan past weekend definitely solid spot    I came twice lunch both meals yummy! First time some sort Korean quesadilla  Honestly probably least favorite thing here  wasn't bad but couple different types sauce thought kind overpowered things  only didn't burger during meal but nibbled some fries those did sweet potato steak fries yummy!   For second lunch try spiked shake DELICIOUS! supposed taste cereal did! don't know if true but informed waitress only two places maybe world? serves shake  also bad some delicious buffalo wings just right amount sauce w the right amount kick some Polish sausage sliders the red peppers nice touch    Everything great!   For half meal hummus guacamole  isn't expecting it chunkier thought but still tasted good  came w a lot pita chips    The service excellent each occasion  Holsteins located 2nd floor Cosmopolitan while most other restaurants located 3rd floor little more casual therefore bit cheaper other restaurants    Even though pretty standard Vegas another nice thing restaurant to go cups alcohol  night while wondering around hotel just popped bar Dragon cocktail to go cup  drink many Holsteins made w Vitamin water  yummy   and um   healthy? <EOR> Ate twice say onion rings best thing had    The burger good but great  gold standard  Cooked good medium rare but bun little dry may much bread bread meat ratio    Lobster mac cheese served luke warm very good  Big let down $17 appetizer table  Cheese little bland side    Kim chi quesadilla good chicken tender appetizer ok    The oreo milkshake real good  Could hardly taste booze but did job  <EOR> One negative Very loud restaurant music games blaring   hard hold conversation husband   Positive good food great service  <EOR> What great place!

Compared BURGR BURGER BAR place worth wait  <EOR> Well good thing writing review cause am DAMN FULL can't sleep!! First all place REALLY LOUD  warned if going converse others   I wouldn't suggest coming here  Don't wrong love DJ tons enthusiasm but volume music just loud    Our server Jonathan seemed really cool guy when he first introduced us  personally felt really rushed order drinks  where first problem arose   we wanted plain vanilla milkshake snarky response all shakes vanilla place order oreo milkshake see menu plain vanilla chocolate other standard flavors  When saw obviously confronted told just wanted vanilla  He said the order already placed he bringing other drinks he literally blending sure folks but when food beverage industry shouldn't attentive customers needs? sure if he purposely trying higher check average since standard milkshakes $3 less but anyways  thought extremely rude say milkshake already being blended couldn't change order when he wouldn't let order wanted first place  milkshake yummy but principle   When asked other menu alternatives he laughed said know burger place right?

For burger selection shared Fun Ghi Burger which packed brim many favorite things  Indeed mushrooms aplenty check caramelized onions check gruyere check even truffle mayo gave burger earthy aroma signature truffle flavor  patty itself juicy flavorful also cooked perfect medium rare   We also split order Truffle Lobster Mac N Cheese might well all if you're indulging this! which nice contrasts creaminess crisp crunch thanks breaded topping course   contrast some macaroni cheese dishes found other establishments version wasn't overly rich oily  Its stronger more pronounced cheese flavor complemented burger quite well    In sharing appetizer burger side girlfriend pretty much stuffed  portion sizes bigger we're accustomed getting price cough Umami cough   being said expect somewhat price markup   it Sin City all   We didn't chance try any famed Holstein's adult shakes in large part because already gotten drunk earlier morning but some combinations listed menu looked pretty interesting  particular Red Velvet Cake Shake really jumps off page!  While whole high end burger scene seems flourishing into quite business days places Holsteins prove ways excel both image execution  certainly back  <EOR> Overpriced mediocre food service  recommended come some friends since already staying Cosmo decided come dinner night  located right across Marquee  promptly seated upon arriving around 9pm Tuesday night no wait  ordered Caesar's salad chicken friend ordered Memphis burger  service horrible  never come check nor seem care  All servers seem haughty attitude them  salad came without chicken requested  Once told them took forever them bring chicken  food just bad  Chicken way dry looks gross  burger lacked flavors patty also super dry  flag them down them bring condiments  doesn't need ketchup mustard burger joint?!
