Well tried decided back    Pretty bad customer service   The steaks OK great   Hamburgers terrible hot dogs worse   opinion supermarkets meat almost same half price  <EOR> A buddy's big birthday around corner looking unique gift idea   He loves grill eat seemed very logical choice   Initially thought could just order something ask packed shipping container then would wrap bow deliver it  Duh doesn't work way other online   However once saw cute little gift card coolers knew winner winner chicken or steak dinner!  now unique bbq themed gift packed tissue OS tote bag Spring catalog  Nice   Isiah great lengths help very patient   BF browsed store which lots sales special offers came some snack goodies take home Hunter's Sausage sticks fresh tasting all dry slim jim sticks summer sausage  But plenty other steaks chops seafood seasonings more select   Overall nice little store good shopping  experience  <EOR> I ordered $49 99 Groupon great deal wanting try Omaha Steaks while now  far good 2 filet mignons wife last night which excellent  4 burgers tonight which good definitely tell difference meat comparison grocery store meat  Still can't fresh butcher shops since Omaha frozen but frozen pretty damn good can't complain  Still couple steaks left chicken pork chops! Only con man store wasn't enthusiastic He just sat behind counter acted irritated wasn't super social being first time customer wasn't great first impression  <EOR> Several years ago ordered bacon wrapped Filet Mignon Omaha Steaks very good   steaks arrived Styrofoam cooler dry ice packaged beautifully  Then found local store Vegas check them out  store small well organized freezers along two walls  Purchased 4 Filet Mignon $40  Unfortunately tasted terrible much fat each   does Filet Mignon much fat?  Isn't supposed lean tender? I buy any steak Omaha steaks again  <EOR> The customer service god awful    I assume Robert name tag managers   The first time he training new employees     Very rude them   second time he very rude customers including me   loyal customer several years staff management gone down   convenient meat portion packaging but absolutely hate going store   another manager Shawn same sinerio   rude  made purchase before kindly asked if he applied points he said late already rung up  always spend $150 200 every time buy there  just Sunday going back     Going Butcher much better great customer service  <EOR> I've location few times pick steaks lamb chops all sorts sides BBQ   staff excellent steer right direction if you're confused   prices bit high though you're getting frozen meats   I'd really prefer good quality butcher shop but unfortunately haven't seen area Omaha Steaks time being  <EOR> This store very clean neat obviously well maintained  guy behind counter friendly professional but little eager upselling  know part job requirements but when say  All mean exactly that  take insult when courteous refusal any more products met typical high pressure sales tactics  turns off immediately  coupon packages $49 00 because even if rich would NEVER pay retail prices Omaha charges  There's no reason good enough why anyone would pay several hundred dollars few steaks  don't care if cows came diamond studded utters gold lined a**holes right mind willingly pay kind money hunk meat   When home cooked filets sirloin  filet wasn't bad but sirloin weird texture gave strange taste  First all if you're going sell advertised premium meats full route sell fresh frozen  grew real butcher shops always sold best meat anywhere because always fresh  honest continue buying steaks grocery store because going toe to toe better tasting beef tenth price  simple reason huge difference taste texture because frozen minute freeze meat any kind fundmentals meat changed something never meant don't care anyone says  returing Omaha anything future  wanted try them long time did disappointed  <EOR> I don't know give place anything less 5 stars place small no room mistake  Their storage room twice size front room  But even front room lots frozen steaks twice stuffed potatoes etc   Their girl when she very attentive  It's easy gig because product sells itself  ship everywhere  I freeze defrost eat lot steaks mean lot  But never understand steaks defrost quickly  almost defy laws physics  I took frozen steaks frozen steaks of comparable size put them counter Omaha steak defrosted less 2 hours whereas mine took more 4 hours defrost  If anyone answer would more sleep night  The steaks small find myself eating minimum two per meal but definitely restaurant quality steaks more reasonable prices restaurant prices  I love organization products I'm obsessive compulsive love way pack steaks Styrofoam dry ice during warm season s   I think covered everything  <EOR> You just lost loyal customer because horrible customer service  sure don't care but just want everyone know your employee left standing check family long  just wanted pay food  <EOR> My mother in law sent package Christmas now hooked   hated long took deliver though found store Rainbow Las Vegas NV   honored all deals found line   best meat deserts ever had   Lasagna great too   Highly recommend  <EOR> Love place! husband just recently discovered store Vegas  heard Omaha Steaks before but some reason thought online retailer only    It pretty expensive  two times shopped spent little over $100  But trust worth every penny! Matt S  already mentioned always some kind sale two for one deal going never worry paying full price  Also told if ever happen find better deal website just print page show them match price   Everything frozen nicely packed boxes but meats really really good! employees always very friendly helpful although still wondering if work off commission? Anyway explain lot things if tell them your first time store if don't much experience cooking meats  Forrest employee helped us  He explained some different cuts steaks gave handy Steak Cooking Chart which tells long cook steak when turn them grill     Our favorites Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignons Triple Trimmed Filet Mignons  Very juicy tasty! tried Chocolate Molten Lava Cakes dessert which thought okay but probably would buy again  seemed much sweeter am used to  want try Tiramisu Cheesecake next time  also bought package Canine Cookies dog loved them!
