Love restaurant everything very tasty great service excellent food come back sure <EOR> To honest boy generally ignore side Aria  lackluster experience Sage ever really being mood tapas wasn't must reason there  weekend however Aria food credits spend wanted try something new  Tetsu apparently very new just opened past Wednesday August 1    Front staff entranced manned or should say womanned 3 young ladies  nice attentive  promptly seated own teppanyaki grill which great because gone other places lump together right away  Other guests also seated own tables   Atmosphere Decor found entrance beautiful especially sun setting backlighting really made colors pop  However once led your seat décor drastically changes simple modern stone background  little disappointed interior didn't mirror beautiful qualities entrance but stare design eat  attire marked casual but would lean more toward dressy casual  least wear nice shirt people! Overall if want know feelings associated Tetsu would describe them neutral  place gives warm fuzzies log cabin but isn't uninviting DMV either  hard explain guess but just associate modern design décor neutrality  Moving on         Food Four grills surround ice mountain where see vegetables seafood   The menu offers appetizers meats vegetables rice  For appetizer jalapeno calamari  f r e s h  chef brought whole squid tiny octopus wooden board chopped right front us  jalapenos seeded cut fresh inches away well  few minutes later dipping calamari into two seafood sauces salsa verde good salsa roja awesome   coming gal looooooooves green salsas over red any day week too  Two side notes sauces brought chilled square black rock containers  cool literally figuratively ! FYI naked calamari deep fried watching a sporting event calamari  calamari flavorful overly chewy jalapenos tasted red green pepper duh seeds gone cooked  For dinner 10 ounces filet minion added kale corn zucchini eggplant  vegetables cooked first  kale corn delicious  zucchini eggplant really good but awesome corn! am biased corn lover though  meat lovers filet rib eye charged ounce  If must know twelve dolla make you holla filet ten rib  Ten ounces twelve bucks math  chef brought rib eye mistake but didn't mind because beautiful piece meat! Something 80 oz  filet brought chef cut off piece put straight grill sprigs rosemary top  filet medium but medium well a crime know good  Melt your mouth filet minion goodness  Two sauces also brought meat another salsa verde cilantro if recall chili soy sauce  two loved chili soy sauce  Finally wagyu fried rice  don't know if wild rice but black purple color along cuts wagyu beef vegetables added egg  stuffed point senses dulled but Mr  said really good   Service server Milan sweet attentive  Almost attentive hehe  Kate Middleton feels like? He checked frequently well taken care of  fine dining should always like  Luckily Vegas always seems treat well  chef Yoku I might wrong funny corny just me  only gone teppanyaki few times but swear requirement chefs personable able crack jokes  hoot! Note no showboating here secretly hoped onion volcano but didn't happen  matters he made everything taste awesome  Lastly executive chef greeted when seated he overseeing everything going well  don't know but appreciate things that    Summary Tasty melt your mouth food  Attentive friendly staff  Expect pay around ninety dollars per person including drinks come eat before lose all your money Texas Hold'em table  <EOR> Expensive but food excellent  Chef good cook rather showman find some teppanyaki restaurants  Attentive staff maybe meal quickly but overall great experience  <EOR> The lobster amazing  steak well!!

Cheers! <EOR> Not worth time money  Fantastic service high quality food but wayyyyy overpriced taste size all    Eating Tetsu means also order sushi menu barMASA next door! ordered Seared Salmon Avocado Uni Ebi roll  Both fairly standard nothing amazing which quite disappointment    At Tetsu ordered seared scallops rib eye lamb chops sea bass brussel sprouts cilantro shrimp fried rice    [Appetizer] Seared scallops am biased because love scallops all forms! ordered 3 orders start off but because chef thought scallops smaller side ended giving 5! deliciously seared perfectly flavored fantastic start meal!  [Entrees] Rib eye delicious tender just right amount fat! Really enjoyed sauces given complement meat  Portion sizes stingy though   Lamb chops tasty but nothing particularly memorable  Also underwhelming  Sea Bass think best 3 entrees  Fresh smooth nicely seasoned  All three definitely solid dishes but nothing truly amazed me    [Sides] Brussel sprouts simple grilled flavored lightly lemon salt pepper   Cilantro shrimp fried rice skimpy shrimp but nicely satisfying rice cilantro occasional peppers  definitely needed rice keep even remotely satiated    Overall waiters great  chef himself however quite stoic usual teppanyaki personality would expect find  He made meal feel somehow stern overly formal  food simple small portion sizes high quality taste wise something particularly memorable   100% worth price  Definitely recommend definitely coming back  <EOR> Overall delicious but some dishes fell flat   Also process having guy cook item time entertaining but very efficient especially since plates small side   felt lot sitting around   table side chef very nice though   food found overall good but inconsistent   5 ordered several dishes which ranged superb okay oh no   superb lobster ceviche spicy octopus jalapeno calamari chicken meatballs maitake mushrooms truffle butter wagyu ribeye sea bass   okay daikon apple asparagus salad wagyu fried rice shrimp vegetable dumplings   oh no vegetable yakisoba   yakisoba extremely sweet flavor never seen soba   couldnt' even eat it    One thing also off putting hostess seated us   first she seated teppan counter where chairs clearly pulled different sized table   problem much lower table such couldn't really eat sitting chair   When brought attention she inquired getting another chair then came back told no other chairs available   waited offer move different table since restaurant very empty point   But no she just gave look shit luck   insist she move us   which point he kind gave bit attitude   finally other hosts came over moved us   Seriously though   expect customer sit chair doesn't' fit table? <EOR> The best teppanyaki food ever years! world  Sake amazing too  <EOR> First off MUST say if giving place bad review ordering wrong dishes! course don't Teppan grill expect same steak amazement you'd steak house  utterly ridiculous  well more unique specialized dishes ate recommend allllll vegetable sides particularly mushrooms! made entire meal them ordered two more original request did half price entrees  delectable unique Vegas WOW factor  also ordered scallops another bit tastiness  boyfriend lobster throughly enjoyed it   We chatted chef he seemed little embarrassed limited English but he hilarious then since being friendly head chef came cooked awhile chatted up  Even gave two extra scallops!
