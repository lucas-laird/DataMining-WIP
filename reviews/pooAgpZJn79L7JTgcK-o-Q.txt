I may back try Philippino food before put restaurant never return list lol <EOR> Don't wrong love food LJ's  reminds going Auntie's holiday parties when everything served family style flavors home  love food much big birthday dinner couple years ago  Which honestly even then service subpar But many MANY low star reviews main gripe service  HOLY CRAP service terrible  super patient when comes food  understand making something scratch takes time but when cooking serving food LITERALLY YOUR BUSINESS need take some pointers multitude negative reviews regarding it    This particular visit only experienced bad service watched happen other tables!   First off only bf having dinner TWO US  seated immediately employee family member table next high school friends? but last thing timely    After order finally taken 15 minutes into visit took another 15 Calamansi juice called server over remind her    last contact ANY server until finally said something HOUR ORDERING FOOD  no refill offers no check ins no apologies until visually upset  unacceptable    The family across received food 10 15minute spurts also keep asking dishes  table next them even worse! Halo Halo sent them before received ANY HOT FOOD  literally brought FROZEN DESSERT FIRST  mean isn't embarrassing?! Letting Halo Halo melt before even hot food?   Needless say unless see some improved reviews doubt coming back Filipino food fix  speed your service could literally drive market shopping cook own meal before I'd food you  really hurts write because your food great but need honest  just take extra few minutes drive Fiesta  <EOR> This place great! sister yesterday   busy only another table besides us   service awesome   very nice fast food   Lechon Kawali pho papaya salad   lechon star show   crispy soft amazing sauce every bite just better better   sister really liked pho   Al though rich bone broth very herby hit spot   papaya salad ok   bit spicer fan dried shrimps   end food really hit spot price pretty good   also small market near which pretty sweet too  if area check place out  <EOR> I LJ's today family party 16  only one's restaurant good amount time since early morning  waitress seemed overwhelmed party size let know okay keep table separate  decided try AYCE BBQ disappointing  disorganized waitress forgot plates ordered then charged extra person  Although food pretty good service terrible forgot plates rice utensils gave 90 min limit while waited some plates 50+ min  While tried let them know mistake bill problems service refused charged extra person regardless  coming back again  food did terrible hospitality  <EOR> Went Halloween angel devil sat three tables down us!  Ordered Chicken Adobo some Canton Guisado along w some rice! adobo good used eating onions threw off when first ate it! only through half it  haven't tried adobo enough restaurants fair judge but don't feel compelled order again  If love something know right away didn't feeling w the adobo   On other hand liked Canton Guisado more  liked gave lime wedges add some juice it  fresh full flavor! Also Thai Iced Tea w boba which great except boba stuck straw several times  also when boba soft chewy theirs didn't stack opinion    I definitely want back order different things! Might garlic fried rice since initially thought ordering eating w the adobo vs white rice  <EOR> Yall done fucked LJ's   Never setting foot again  quite bad Salo Salo other Filipino food spots giving food bad name uh lack cleanliness but close  only saving grace your food   well even then  saying much  Basically gang co workers come over join LJ's kamayan dinner 15 heads deep when all said done service hard hell come  pulling teeth just glass water authentic wanted kamayan plates completely uneven some missing items thinking perhaps wouldn't catch it top off over charged    Mind until dinner trying menu listing server hostess again pulling teeth calling them several times advance telling them coming  Its didn't take reservation 15 heads seriously   It weird everyone getting separate tab drinks    then 15 minutes later getting another tab food  Say whaaat? Yeah  Then towards end meal manager tries sweat talking failed pay person  Manager realizes he fucked falls back further inspecting bill    Ya'll lucky some Filipino food amateurs take really didn't know going some food y'all put unique compared some Filipino restaurants around town  Rarely feel doling dreaded 1 star gonna give place 2 but man everytime think incident gets heated  dropped good amount coin place nightmare  gonna take granted nearly all being CULINARY PROFESSIONALS    Being industry understand tough nights however when know advance coming unprepared really no excuse all miss cues night   Sidenote Still having hankering real Filipino food fast forward few weeks later some frustrated but determined Filipino co workers gathered throw down version real kamyan dinner rocked it  <EOR> Server did inform menu process changing until entire order placed  When appetizer should instead served news items no longer available  Clearly available menu asked upgraded version Vegetable rolls which would Egg rolls  told don't     I am always only interested done!   The Manager comes rescue however she talking behind booth sat over left shoulder  No!   Filipino food favorite cuisine return food! service perhaps time phase old update along menu!   Also business hours aren't clear! <EOR> The concept good but delivery ok     family dinner couple months back notified them people allergic shrimp specifically fried rice   took off then served again towards end wouldn't notice it  Hopefully when try place Boodle option redeem themselves  <EOR> Worst 1st experience ever horrible customer service    table before lunch rush waited 40mins no dishes come table looked around everyone came already received food!  wait another 10mins server Chelsea ONLY now apologizes mistake comes find she didn't even put order in!  just leave still hungry determined eat lunch someplace else   never again please straighten customer service LJ's pub!! <EOR> I stopped few days ago food great service prompt restaurant itself very nice  Ask TK he's very attentive whats going on  looking forward returning  <EOR> I'm usually big fan Asian Fusion Filipino food   However place didn't me   came today wife friend   only people restaurant   menu confusing hard understand   word Pub name where pub?!We ask another menu pictures just comprehend items looked even then didn't describe was   also way many choices chose from   Less better!  On reason review   I ordered crispy chicken lunch menu $6 99 came steamed rice   squash no flavor all neither did chicken   actually smothered grease   server brought rice inquired but ultimately decided crispy chicken brought fried rice dish anyway   felt communication barrier just lack competence altogether   wife's dish didn't even look half way descent raw onions just thrown top pork dish   pork much fat ridiculous!  She literally sit throughout meal picking fat off pork yes bad    Bottom line don't think coming back there's reason dead lunch   Menu overloaded choices no pictures menu see you're getting food bland bland bland service sucks   feel ripped off spent $51 51 feel sick afterwards   won't back  <EOR> Fully patronized did orders online  beginning fine until orders filled even several hours ordering ahead  Once fine but became every time  All ever hear empty apologies   good way run business  Couldn't even compensate glass water waiting  order long time thought pre ordered!!! Does look very sanitary also  <EOR> The quality food pretty good here prices bit higher many other Filipino places because prepare food order rather having sitting buffet style point turo turo   But serving size comparable other Filipino restaurants area check prices when order large meat dish other places you'll see    Usually food because service somewhat slow but servers always very nice if somewhat spread thin ratio diners servers  restaurant itself however always very clean don't leave smelling your Lola's kitchen when you're done eating unlike many other ethnic restaurants   The bistek bangus milkfish fried served lemon soy sauce onions delicious but if order cram into large soup container which opinion screws presentation  still tastes really good though! probably favorite menu item here   The insarabasab like sisig but more lemony good but then again never seen any other Filipino restaurant far can't compare anything else  pork sisig itself just okay wasn't fan dinakdakan sisig mayo    Their lomi thick noodles sauce veggies delicious!  The pinakbet great nobody really screw dish EXCEPT cannot without pork if you're vegetarian may want someplace else   Overall bad place if you've hankering Filipino food but prepared wait little delicious food  <EOR> Great food great service  Best filipino food vegas  filipino employees feel home <EOR> Tried order online  No menu descriptions when finally checkout required minimum two hours prepare food  planet am on? year it? bad  look great place  Maybe try dine when more time <EOR> Nice surprise while stopping Vegas during road trip   staff nice friendly very accommodating   There's several families group wanted split checks   No problem!  server took care us   quality food really good too!  Crispy Pata Ginataang Sitaw Kalabasa   other families very happy food well   Really surprised food came fast taste according Filipino standards   sure check them when you're Vegas area  <EOR> RUDE STAFF TERRIBLE SERVICE! OVERLY GREASY NASTY FOOD!  The star great pho  Everything else gets big whopping 0!   When walked never properly greeted  Instead waitress just pointed table available  read sign said food options day  waitress came table just stared iPad hand  assumed she wanted start ordering but she never vocalized it  Just stared until started order  tried ordering off sign but waitress said those options unavailable  extended family Filipino translated she saying us  But didn't need translation see she attitude  clear she did want there  then tried order off lunch specials menu  She again gave attitude while stating did lumpia because wedding party reserved lumpia  don't understand why just didn't more lumpia enough wedding restaurant patrons  knew wedding party coming because need reserve those things advanced  finally ordered bangus lechon kawali fried rice soup  She asked if all  friend responded oh chicken adobo   waitress said okay   then asked did chicken adobo she did respond  friends father asked if she sure no msg food  She again did respond just walked away table  diet cokes 10 minutes later lacking fizz syrup  told RUDE waitress she said Tagalog nothing she could practically blamed enjoying it  then talked other waitress she said she would change soda machines  Finally food comes disgusting  Yes lechon kawali very greasy but overloaded grease hardly any meat  could feel grease sticking roof your mouth clinging onto your uvula  fried rice coated thick grease  oils using back? Must vasoline crisco bacon fat corn oil mix  ate most food while still awaiting arrival chicken adobo  then called waitress over remind order adobo  She said okay left  point starting full but waited 10 more minutes  called back asked adobo  She then said didn't order iPad  told did order would still some  She course gave attitude  chick does need employed any company until she attitude classes  chick rolling eyes other restaurant goers just did care ALL! home then lady! I'd rather serve damn self then deal again  Anyways received adobo 20 minutes later  then received check 30 minutes later received boxes food 20 minutes paid bill  waitresses during waiting time just stocking cutlery  Overall experience SUCKED!
