Great service extensive AYCE menu always good choice day night  Try Gorilla Dream roll Popcorn Lobster  <EOR> A recently opened new sushi place UNLV area which special 50% off AYCE during first week  Heard friend earlier today lunch decided try dinner   Outside reminds Kabuto high end omakase style only restaurant town  Simplistic plain white walls narrow windows     except all changes when u inside  Very conflicted decor  Lol  Ceiling nice design varying height lighting  sushi bar wall behind looked nice layered acoustic sound dampening foam lookin design wall i dont know describe it Then    u cheap bar chairs look hawaii tables benches remind im food court  see? conflicted       We sat table fairly quickly drink orders taken  that  Lol  friends written down nigiri order napkin handed waitress  took two more servers ask before actually even received waters    Food came periodically  Fairly slowly  Actually quite slow considering seemed fully staffed sushi bar 3 chefs restaurant barely half full if that  dining room staff very attentive repeatedly asking if everything ok multiple people    but nothing ever came quicker expected telling them waiting orders    Fish rice ratio pretty decent but fish slice size definitely inconsistent  Fish slices varied thickness  Some quite thin  Some quite thick  sexy salmon nigiri essentially salmon nigiri slice avocado top slice lime without peel but seeds some spicy thousand island like sauce small spot sriracha  Quite inconvenient eat when u eventually pull seed cut slice lime  Nigiri overall ok  most weird probably Ikura  Never seen such ugly ikura  Quite few deflated  flat   Some seemed mushed   Color seemed bit off too  Rice bit weird combination ikura  Rice seemed mushy order  rice itself nigiri ok but would preferred little more vinegar taste but seemed vary quality over course night  Some soft some seemed sat while        Our 2nd order essentially disappeared despite being placed manager himself  Order checked servers eventually manager  ordered Gorilla tuna salmon yellowtail sashimi well some hand rolls appetizers  Tuna sashimi some cajun spice top  Salmon sashimi some weird sweet sauce cut weirdly   Yellowtail ponzu but fairly normal aspect  ordered salmon avocado handroll salmon skin hand roll  When handrolls came manager oh chef put more fish handrolls since took long   honest dont feel larger any other restaurant would done it  Also salmon skin handroll became salmon handroll less salmon salmon avocado handroll  Lol Friend's agedashi appetizer came before sashimi's but green mussels no where found  As mentioned previously food came slowly  probably good 15 minutes longer between each dish    We originally arrived 8    time thru 2 orders    asking last call 1030  decided just give dessert  Something outside sushi chef's realm  choice ice cream mochi tempura ice cream  tempura ice cream choice ice cream each ordered well other things  server later came back soon taking order told all tempura ice creams asked if we'd order any other ones addition before  did  When desserts came ice creams chocolate syrup drizzled top  Normally wouldnt weird happen but right minds would drizzle chocolate syrup top green tea ice cream     another weird combination gorilla sushi ! !   Price wise 50% off great deal but must allocate quite amount time eat  2 5 hours still left really full  Would loved order more but slow fulfilling orders knows when we'd it    IMAGINE much worse when restaurant actually full  <EOR> At first time recently impressed! food great service amazing  Someone constantly ready take next AYCE order everything came super fast yummy!  Will definitely back <EOR> This place some amazing special rolls! honestly hard choose but everything delicious  staff restaurant also very nice  Korean BBQ roll baked green mussels friend Mexican sunset rolls which we'd both highly recommend  <EOR> Took fiance birthday lunch Sunday awkwardly walked completely empty place  Don't wrong understand if places always packed but literally hour only ones inside    The customer service awesome! Servers sushi chefs very accommodating friendly  server in training she did well  guess giving 3 stars food itself  Nothing really wowed except takoyaki which ordered several times   With many other sushi places town Gorilla Sushi just didn't hit spot much thought would  drive come still debating if worth drive try again  give them 3 5 stars  Maybe come back   maybe  <EOR> Seriously awesome!!!

Location clean service Austin super friendly but more importantly fish hella fresh! apps alone worth ample starter portions one limit items sashimi salad rather couple tablespoons tiny bowl  also offer couple dinner only sashimi options  poke salad solid but seafood nachos stuffed tomato crab + avocado wrapped tuna better  version classic riceless Rock N Roll better almost any other version tried  did partake but dessert menu larger other AYCE options which plus   I coming back apps rolls extensive but stand fresh thick cuts fish  <EOR> Eveything delicious! clean modern interior  Sevice great well  <EOR> This upcoming modern place actually bad just me   sushi ok   cooked food amazing   ALL appetizers awesome   environment loud service ok   But reason would come back place liquor cooked food  <EOR> Gorilla Sushi still very new understand service may best but    woo  came two friends last day half off special around 6pm which unfortunately seemed peak dinner rush walked inside completely full line  servers kept returning front take names down waiting list reached point where some people warned two hour wait people waited outside called in  took friends roughly hour seated but even then people came seated first seemed lost name list rip   When mentioned server he immediately seated open table where sat another 10 15 minutes before flagging down different server few waters  She very kind immediately took order friends decided order quite lot because expected them done slowly due high volume people restaurant    We never specific server attending ending interacting each but usually ask status other orders request more food because first server never came back until end meal  didn't seem assigned tables specific servers which may furthered confusion when trying deliver orders  All servers very nice tried sure getting orders sweating terribly continuously running around never felt irritated service even though wasn't great  end decent chunk orders never arrived received few wrong orders different tables never any water refills we never asked any but assumed would done automatically?   run few items time able order sea urchin most mochi ice creams fried ice cream but wasn't big deal us  Ultimately spent 4 hours trying all orders friend mainly came appetizers not much sushi fan left still bit hungry because those came slowest  also apparently closed early turning away customers while table 3 4ths restaurant still eating around 9   Side notes few memorable dishes Takoyaki costs $4 50 comes only TWO balls incredibly small piece octopus inside  Highway robbery if you're ordering la carte  deep fried rolls very thin layer batter outside if love ordering crunch gives may disappointed  Bulgogi super tender! think might Korean owned place because spicy rice cake available which fairly certain meant ddeokbokki  haven't seen other sushi places before but also don't sushi often    Objectively conflicting service two stars because multiple mix ups forgetting portions each four orders  Interior decor fact they're still new gets them another because didn't leave unhappy definitely need improve system though  only items loved few appetizers namely gyoza shumai bulgogi while everything else didn't quite stand me  Personally wouldn't come again just because wasn't much crazy tried  <EOR> I've never better sushi experience  staff friendly food good thought $20 pretty good quality  atmosphere very nice don't fooled exterior  <EOR> So yummy fresh!
