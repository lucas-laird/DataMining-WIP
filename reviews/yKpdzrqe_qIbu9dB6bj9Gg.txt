Why Las Vegas remain worth city airport food when some best restaurants country?? I tested Gyro special testing menu  big joke  $23 gyro made dry pitta bread extra dry chicken rubber feta tzatzki no cucumber garlic  This worse gyro ever had  Side fries re fried over cooked  And call testing menu side cold veggies two carrots two zucchini three leaves spinach top ??? Impossible determine  Please LAS airport look other cities Portland Seattle doing airport food!!!! <EOR> Our server Lazaro he very fast friendly! He above beyond server made sure well taken care of  ordered wings great! Fair prices  Great quality great atmosphere  definitely back next visit Vegas! <EOR> Awful  Every single part awful  ordered drinks start  Waited 20 minutes them flavorless watered down  no wasn't because busy  Everyone around drinks  food hot when came zero flavor  Pretty hard mess cheeseburger fries  waitress non existent   would rather but kiosks ever come again  swear    don't go  thankful  <EOR> Skip salads they're pre made swimming dressing   Sandwich fries better way go  <EOR> We quesadillas chips cheese fondue  Both great filled up! Service Jack prompt great! Good job PGAtour!  Quesadillas ask little more pico de gallo   Chips perfect  And definitely took advantage beer shot special  little pricey compared Fremont street but airport  But food great  <EOR> Strike 1 bad iced tea  Sent back  Strike 2 bug wife's sandwich in greens Strike 3 cold burger chicken sandwich We're out  Avoid  <EOR> Early flights call drink Mando man!  Talking brightens morning even tho never time eat always look forward when he's working   Always remembers drink name   Nothing customer service airport that   Keep good work cause appreciated   Located B gates if your travel SWA  <EOR> Had quick lunch way catch flight  ordered grilled chicken pesto flatbread which turned cheesy mix served could best called deep dish crust  other words terrible but definitely worth $$  <EOR> You know airport restaurant pleasantly surprised  place menu geared more staying fit lot really good options  usually just steak burger but found myself enjoying atmosphere found food VERY well prepared  bit pricey side but hey airport  place gets definite thumbs traveler!!!! <EOR> The 15 dollar omelette took 20 minutes takeout entirely underwhelming  worth inflated prices <EOR> Absolutely horrid   staff arguments behind seats breaks people being under them weren't happy   chef cook kept coming telling jokes chatting   hostess upfront hugging guys couple them coming flirt her    food cold over medium eggs total over easy husbands scramble eggs needed spoon     toast bacon sat 25 min finally server came back asked different potatoes let know eggs too    She back over microwaved appeared new potatoes    No thank sorry sorry let's right   Just sassy comment couple sat down asking new table since theirs dirty she total attitude point some over there     lady break jumped fix cleaned theirs    Just horrible experience expect more anywhere  <EOR> DO EAT HERE! wish read yelp reviews before hand because worst service ever had  seated right away but ended waiting 10 minutes even acknowledged server all while other parties came greeted given drinks orders taken  Finally server came take order  ended waiting 40 minutes food! Remember AIRPORT  waiting 30 minutes getting ready leave when server came back tell the kitchen really backed   found hard believe when people seated served meals  Some food same food ordered! ask another server check food she brought right away  obviously upset all server did ask if he could refill drinks already done meal  boyfriend ordered flatbread ordered burger  could gotten better burger Burger King much cheaper price  flatbread boyfriend burnt bottom  food definitely worth price worth 40 minute wait  yourself favor EAT HERE! <EOR> Friendly bartender yesterday  But Fisn'n'Chips easy dish right? Not PGA cold chips some mystery WAY over battered ground fish sticks   $18  Bad indigestion ugh <EOR> Terrible service  Beer ok   Food just plain bad   come especially if plane catch took forever <EOR> I would suggest eating anywhere but if can  seated really quickly which nice   Our server very polite but seemed she huge hurry out  early flights somewhat irritating    Let's goof which worst part  ordered Power burger boyfriend ordered Chipotle Chicken Sandwich  expecting anything elaborate but bottom buns both burnt bad couldn't even eat  fries okay  best part beer ordered  server brought exact time needed it    We didn't even finish food just left  didn't seem mean options beer good meal   Next time just stick something simple  <EOR> This somewhat typical place eat airport debated between 3 4 stars  4 because served right away food came really fast   important airport  server came back check took care bill right away request offered cup soda  just burger fries but good  Total bill $22  There's lot places eat part airport good quick option if time sit down meal  <EOR> We made pit stop before flying home stop brunch inside airport  place super busy food pretty decent inside airport  only thing menu only 5 options choose from  But once order food comes very quickly during brunch hours  <EOR> I really liked menu options something everyone! hummus plate great  ordered fish tacos server explained more lettuce wraps instead tacos  sure why something would called taco doesn't tortilla but guess  why she clarified  Three came order along fries tasted great! Two people could easily split appetizer entree    Yes would consider pricy but  typical airport options  <EOR> The worst restaurant worst airport world  Nothing says bottom basement this  Don't even bother reading rest review only need know DONT COME HERE!!
