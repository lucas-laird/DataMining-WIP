Unfortunately AC doesn't work  huge fans blowing everywhere  fan restaurants no cold AC  already hot enough Vegas  _ Anywho hope AC fixed start using it! would definitely come back! <EOR> I typically give 5 stars restaurants would come back also recommend    We ordered Nem Nuong Bun Bo Hue   Growing SGV much OC but still wide selection authentic Vietnamese food   However 7 years living Vegas say Bun Bo Hue far best town   SGV good? No    But definitely something would come back Las Vegas   $8 99 bowl pho actually quite hefty   But considering location being close strip usually higher price point ingredients lots tender meat acceptable  <EOR> Great far  I would say Pho Hung Toronto canada deserves 5 stars    This only pho place ever vegas but deserves 4 stars <EOR> This some cleanest pho ever had! back late breakfast again tomorrow   5 stars! <EOR> Came based yelp review did disappoint   Wanted grab quick late lunch early dinner  waiter very nice attentive   He came check food refill drinks which rare typical asian restaurant  friend loved meatball rare steak  pho broth thought best she ever tasting coming someone living CA   thought try something new ordered Bun Bo Hue   soup spicy lots mixed vegetables variety meat  dish beginners  If authentic Bun Bo Hue enjoy dish  <EOR> This review order  ordered 8 combo pho go  When receive box very leaky  Half broth spilled all over place plastic container melted because heat  such disaster  <EOR> Feeling hungover?

The service awesome though think waiter isn't full time ones  He asked if before when told hadn't he explained all dishes gave recommendations!  We #11 broken rice combo grilled pork which absolutely delicious  haven't shrimp cake before but oh so good all right ways   We also Bun Bo Hue which very flavorful delicious  I did research tried another restaurant before posting review while other restaurant's food yummy Bun Bo Hue winner! waiter described spicy soup    Bun Rieu also very good waiter just called crab soup    [[The waiter kept checking point ask if needed box since party 2 ordered 3 entrees  finished them  Cuz we're awesome  think he confused ]]  The waitress working night processed bill iPad  asked which taxis good but think she confused because she just left without responding  waiter helping came back later refill waters offered call cab when he figured didn't car   Five stars service food! <EOR> Food good  Portions huge  But favorite sugar cane + coconut juice had  refreshing unique since never anywhere else before! Very impressed can't wait back when back Vegas  <EOR> Overall If lived Vegas I'd repeat customer   Pros pho broth which most important element pho dish correctly stewed beef bones spices  well balanced aromatic   bun bo hue also all correct ingredients  blood cubes all    Cons Lemon instead lime served pho likely due increased lime costs  However lime irreplaceable  Also most bun bo hue eaten day several levels hotter  only mild medium spicy nose running spicy experienced before  think type soup calls more spiciness  <EOR> I starving long night drinking  came establishment hot bowl pho  couldn't seated because full party hasn't arrived  place wasn't even busy  asked seated order some appetizers water but manager refused seat me  end waiting 20 minutes  Now very hangry  Moral story If hungry your party don't come here  Also check your chopsticks mold  <EOR> Really great pho here  use better ingredients places Pho Kim Long which translates into much more authentic  Vietnamese dishes   grandmother always greets well Mosis waiter awesome   many already mentioned Bun bo hue staple try it   regular spot great people recognizing top pho place Vegas  <EOR> This place quite close strip  Nice noodles great new kinds spring rolls! always visit vegas trip especially morning crazy night <EOR> We large party order lot food but quality food good service really bad  Lady gave mean looks stare if requested anything else   Prices very high compare other pho restaurant no fried rice other types noodles except pho noodles!!
