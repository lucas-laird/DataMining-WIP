There's also bunch TVs playing sports DJ mixing second floor    Food good pretty much tastes same TBs elsewhere  drinks delicious but weak couldn't taste alcohol which could good dangerous thing  sure if affected personally already bit tipsy  ambiance cool tho right strip Planet Hollywood Hotel     Dope Taco Bell eat least once check if you're ever Vegas! <EOR> I came first day nacho fries during lunch hours  Opening day nacho fries + lunch hour = super long line  Should known better! Waited almost 20 minutes food  Side note*** cashier did tell would take some time short staff high demand  understood    The nacho fries alright  Thank god nacho cheese sauce saving grace  Each fry different taste  Some more spice others some fries crispier others  All all $1 would definitely give them another shot   Our other food tasted great inside super clean furniture wasn't up  <EOR> Do come here  nonalcoholic drinks suck  employees rude  packed people stand land 20 mins still don't know order     You might well save your time normal Taco Bell  <EOR> Taco Bell Booze  more want?  We wanted pretty low key first night Vegas decided Taco Bell alcohol dinner    It's pretty much your standard Taco Bell just merchandise alcohol    There's variety drinks choose then choose your alcohol Vodka Tequila Rum something else can't remember I decided Cherry Icee 2 shots vodka  glorious  Along side crunch wrap pretty much best taco bell dinner ever had  <EOR> Normally wouldn't rate chain restaurants but coming becoming severely disappointed just let world know  For whatever reason Taco Bell doesn't live par ones back near home  proportions lot smaller soft drink bar feel you're old Wild West  Service wasn't great because lady behind cash register made seem she hated job  When asked alcohol shots Baja blast lady couldn't tell because she didn't know  She also didn't know right alcohol Baja Blast ratio because when $10 regular sized drink ended tasting straight tequila no sort Baja Blast remnants  We'll most likely stick Fat Tuesdays if want alcoholic slushie drink  <EOR> So lot lettuce little meat taco's music loud!  For rest okay spot some food! <EOR> Wow! great idea! looove Taco Bell! really excited when heard new cantina  Located near Planet Hollywood right middle all craziness Las Vegas Strip  walk Planet Hollywood  food great usual no complains  drinks great!! boyfriend Baja Blast Skyy Vodka  traditional margarita tequila  prefer drinks over ones Fat Tuesday  pricy meal though $36 2 meals large slushee upgrade small one  <EOR> We really good experience  Lines didn't take long ate upstairs where DJ was  Great music  Typical Taco Bell food but strip pricing  ordered some drinks large refillable cup $15 each  $10 refills  Best part phone chargers every seat  very clean workers quick clean up  important strip its busy  <EOR> This Taco Bell cantina brand new popular because 24 hours prime location however process service pretty terrible  When walk might little impressed cool decor cool alcoholic freeze drinks but once order food you'll see really screwed process  Walking clear many lines are  Although may quick order food huge crowd forms waiting order  screen shows names people ordered but food process being made then another list people whose food ready  says ready but really not  service looks chaotic  clear glass see them working constructing your order but order can't orders straight  mess orders then rude when point something missing order made incorrectly  write your name paper bag but when accept don't trust won't give unless your receipt  late night Saturday going understand everyone munchies little unkind because all drinking but even 3am I'd level service expect during any other time day    It's just disappointing see brand new place such terrible processes place just doesn't sense unorganized  also frustrating watch through glass window all chaos  Somebody should thought through better hope change some processes they'd more business profits way  Sorry say am coming back  <EOR> Ooookay  place hot mess between hours 2AM 3AM because everyone thinking same thing  damn drunk  damn hungry  damn Taco Bell sounds bomb   And let's real  only really crave Taco Bell when you're total state consciousness   This Taco Bell Cantina open 24 7 yes alcoholic slushies  pleasantly surprised prices place seem par other Taco Bells  No price gouging late night munchies here! boyfriend shared cravings box shhh don't tell diet cost $5 both totally stuffed   We didn't try alcoholic slushies but reaction hearing there's much alcohol taste    There's some space sit chill second floor also some outdoor patio area hang around  Music thumping if you're looking another place where yell conversation look elsewhere  <EOR> Nothing special Taco Bell  inside extremely small point where don't enough room people waiting line those waiting food  Speaking waiting food took nearly 30 minutes mine system use alert people when food ready doesn't work properly  food same price normal Taco Bell  only special menu item alcoholic freezes which cost $10 drink 1 shot  Hardly any seating place  Definitely worth going back  <EOR> This place literally just another Taco Bell alcoholic beverages  coolest thing soda fountain   not your typical soda fountain but handles feel pouring beer keg something  But other very noteworthy other middle strip  <EOR> The music super loud ready shout your order cashier because them literally can't hear anyone if they're talking regular volume  made hard ask questions drinks just ended getting same last time mountain dew baja blast  bit watery time compared last time but tasted pretty much same  The workers aren't enthusiastic but tell they're trying everything super loud all time super crowded peak hours half people drunk  We food within 15 20 minutes wasn't bad considering pretty packed  The food tastes any other taco bell nothing special unless alcoholic drink  <EOR> This taco bell cute  perfect place walking around strip drinking  know you're thinking why would want Taco Bell? Well Vegas style  DJ playing the music good good alcoholic drinks good food  would recommend place! <EOR> When heard Taco Bell Cantina selling alcoholic slushies uh hello let's p r o n t o  Turns location first still very few actually serve alcoholic slushies which something didn't find until many miles conceding non alcoholic slushies months later  yeah just added list places try next Vegas trip    My visit Taco Bell Cantina TBC August last year 2017 wasn't expecting much  tourist trap best  assumed slushies would watered down food would average if sub par  assumed heckin' w r o n g   We pulled club long day eating long night drinking club being TBC  Although spent literally every moment day where weren't walking eating still hungry some Taco Bell  much Taco Bell tho   The first thing and probably everyone else noticed wall slushies behind registers  Basically all regular slush options various kinds alcohol rum vodka tequila etc  don't care if you're 5 95 Mormon your eyes shoot straight wall when come in   I Baja blast whatever alcohol came friend cherry whatever alcohol came sorry can't remember   good totally watered down though overpriced Taco Bell   though overpriced blended alcoholic beverages Las Vegas Strip    We also settled eating naked chicken chips potato rito  never chips before but heard lot them seen many advertisements  Honestly overhyped  bad just anything excited about  burrito just average   One cool things location aside being friggen Vegas Strip patio ish room where sit open air watch interact Strip tourists  No advertised way but create your own destiny   Although service wasn't anything special terms friendliness give place four stars remember experience good just because drunk and provided more alcohol but because place extremely clean serving high quantity customers fairly quickly    Will return next trip Las Vegas? If still selling those slushies bet  <EOR> I mean come on  Really?  It's Taco Bell  Yes sometimes hits spot but add hip hop music alcoholic slushies 'Vegas ified' does warrant more stars   why am paying much freaking taco?  Just because Vegas?  Screw if overpaying something unique amazing something local drive thru   We around 2am Sunday morning because   obviously  Long lines moved slow music loud people drunk   actually come think lot most Taco Bells normally are  The staff nice food came good pace  They pulled all hot sauce trays couldn't any which bummer  There big window where look see everyone kitchen making orders which cool   Lots alcohol slush drinks pina colada baja blast cherry etc   seems cool though didn't any   We sat outside covered patio plenty music still booming   It fun eat Taco Bell Vegas only because seems silly fact silly  But if everyone group wants gonna do? <EOR> It's Taco Bell Cantina strip  Alcohol served your fast food unlike typical Taco Bell locations  ordered bubbly libation crunchy taco busy Friday night  cashier handed beer ordering only wait few minutes taco  order came quickly but hey only taco  Nothing exceptional  Clean easily accessible location  didn't notice prices higher except fact alcohol your bill high    <EOR> I've never much fun Taco Bell before  Also food wasn't slopped together expect regular fast food place  I'd rather hang Las Vegas club any day! Perfect place fourth meal beer sangria  <EOR> I love some Taco Bell but bit step down standard location  Food came slowly fairly cramped hot sauce packets all over floor  also tasted bit worse standard Taco Bell which bit disappointing    Tons riff raff which suppose expected right strip know Taco Bell  least security guard  <EOR> Funnest Taco Bell ever too  Besides fact TB better quality food drinks great! mention DJ blasting tunes  Looking some good quick food while strip? Stop by! <EOR> I freaked when saw this  Vegas Disneyland adults! Whether think tacky admit cool concept Btw strictly reviewing drinks let imagine food tastes guarantee you're spot on    There array frozen drinks chose flavors blueberry cherry margarita etc  etc  didn't realize drinks already alcohol them just assumed two shots party started I asked two    Do think worth $16? Kinda  mean when else am going freaking drink Taco Bell? all good fun!  The drinks strong but mostly because those two shots  Both sweet but sweet feel tasted bit better Fat Tuesdays just because amount sugar put drinks astounding   If you're looking turn recommend asking two otherwise play safe one  <EOR> Very cool vibe seating area  music really good food! Didn't know expect baja blast alcohol but worth experience  sure I'd try again only because think prefer taste baja blast freeze its own <EOR> What wrong place? music loud even order without yelling   cashiers order wrong  understand need appeal young people but when can't even hear your order ready hungry sense somewhere else  <EOR> I understand Taco Bell targeting attract late night munchers but no breakfast menu?? <EOR> Every taco bell should Cantina  addidition regular menu items offer beer shots Margharitas  Nice upgrade TB  <EOR> This place lives hype! 3AM busy loud music everybody having good time  much fun! packed food came quick! Perfect drunk munchies spot  happy went! <EOR> There absolutely positively no reason ever place  understand they're trying rock atmosphere Vegas Strip but music 8 o'clock morning loud place could understand lady saying when she trying take order  no idea if food any good because leave could order understand she saying  When complain manager he basically Shrugged shoulders said sorry  definitely stay away place  <EOR> Taco Bell Cantina Taco Bell lovers dream come true   If don't Taco Bell isn't going change your mind   If place amazing     You walk greeted wall Freeze   Plenty different flavors alcohol mixed if would well   buy Taco Bell merchandise shirts swimsuits other items true Taco Bell fan   Music pumping fairly loudly entire time due DJ upstairs   While little hard hear unique fun   The menu same everywhere far could tell   Prices too   $5 BIG BOX   included normal taco Cheesy Gordita Crunch Burrito Supreme nachos drink   them sub drink Baja Blast Freeze   Now think sure did overall price but wasn't much   Then wait your food listening music browsing merchandise   also look through window kitchen watch people your food five feet glass panel away you   actually pretty interesting fun see   see your name order screen watch its way line until start making it     The food Taco Bell   ate upstairs enjoyed people watching high   also around 1 AM   guys open 24 hours day which perfect late night meal being late   I definitely come back don't care if people don't want Taco Bell  <EOR> The hype definitely real here    super stoked finally try special Taco Bell but just    Meh  ¯\_ ? _ ¯   It's pretty cool alcohol your Baja Freeze but what's cool paying $27 it    The order line situation establishment highly inefficient  really no natural flow traffic  just cashiers yelling top lungs NEXT NEXT HELP while flailing limbs around    From videos seen online made seem place MASSIVE but really local Taco Bell your neighborhood would probably 3 times big special one  always overly crowded because hype can't really enjoy ambiance people surrounding breathing your Crunch Wrap Supreme      Never again    Maybe unless super drunk need Doritos Locos Taco ¯\_ ? _ ¯ <EOR> I excited here  menu different try some new items  jalapeño dippers flipping hot neither could choke them down  alcohol part cool  Service ok pretty unorganized   Mountain Dew told them never refilled  Then we're trying eat all sudden music ghetto tolerable insane loud don't know hell was   couldn't even talk right next each other   left without finishing food different drink   never again  <EOR> I stopped large group taco shells tasted very bad  don't saying gross because usually enjoy eating Taco Bell  However particular restaurant simply awful   My party ordered several items menu everyone noticed taste less satisfactory  When told workers food tasted strange told other customers returned 10 or 12 value back tacos today!  I feel should looked into situation before selling more tacos tostadas  issue basically taco shells  Even taco shell friend's tostada did taste good  hope sick eating here!  Overall disappointed  restroom disgusting well  <EOR> OMG! cool  Service fun atmosphere two story structure cool views strip  Loved food  <EOR> I am huge fan Taco Bell general! food always delicious innovative well incredibly affordable! new chicken nachos  Though admittedly hesitant actually thoroughly enjoyed them especially yummy nacho cheese dip  always add hot sauce cheese add bit spice  $5 cravings deal which honestly such steal including burrito gordita taco nachos drink! also pepsi slushie not alcohol which amazing especially amidst Vegas heat  Everything good!  But really Taco Bell environment  DJ upstairs fun decor shining lights aura amazing  definitely place where jam just ton fun without having 21 having drunk  place Vegas opinion  Also DJ when absolutely killing game  <EOR> 24 7 Taco Bell need life  Came 1 AM morning place still super packed  order new double stacked tacos probably first time life where item looked darn close picture  Taste wise couldn't really tell because just needed food stomach  bunch alcoholic slushies which didn't try but next time    The restaurant very nice layout outdoor seating upstairs  messed upstairs  just enjoyed downstairs part  love soda station because looks machines dispenses beer but all wooden handles    The only knock music WAY LOUD  very hard talk even open door area  Never yell cashier tell wanted  exhausted tell specifics just said EACH MENU  Aside place awesome wish more everywhere else  <EOR> OK am avid Taco Bell groupie  love love love Taco Bell    I love food same  still blows mind manage food taste same all 1 000 000 000 000 locations  don't remember quite exactly but think prices bit higher normal TBellz but guys strip need pay rent too!

Finally visited location month ago while Vegas wife  Location smaller thought but steadily busy entire time  outdoor seating also upstairs dining area number TVs well  Seating limited  menu pretty much same any other Taco Bell    As difference any old Taco Bell souvenirs t shirts hats etc sale  wouldn't Vegas location if alcohol wasn't available  All freezes slushes shots added them  believe live DJ probably night  most importantly open 24 hours  If you're Taco Bell enthusiast gotta hit Cantina! <EOR> Definitely all crack be  fairly small place  ordered slushee drinks definitely skimped booze especially price  Big tvs but when didn't see any dj  soda made look beer tap Machine which looks really cool but also takes good minute fill your cups!!! cool say did but can't say ever feel need again!!! <EOR> A bit disappointed  Thought would cool place lots seating lounge vibe   Arrived realized tiny overhyped just glorified Taco Bell done Vegas style serves alcoholic mixed drinks   Bf walked looked around said each other  it?! then left eat hang somewhere else   The place decorated lounge style dim colored lights music booming loudly  admit looked kind cool   Size wise tinyyyy  Literally little corner shop tucked away strip  walked missed first time  gets crowded lining waiting order merchandise stands take space  Cramped seating both inside outside   Nothing really special save your time Vegas somewhere more unique fun!   Bf love Taco Bell but weren't impressed  Won't back! <EOR> This place lit loud music neon lights vodka icy drinks    The seating small extra seating upstairs but think most people orders go   You try alcoholic drinks before buying well! <EOR> Okay being local seeing all hype try place out  honestly never thought I'd give review Taco Bell since pretty much know you're getting when Taco Bell  Taco Bell pretty straight forward but said all hype try place out    So selling point place isn't even futuristic cool looks  actually price which college student great thing ate nice meal drink freeze 10 bucks    The food also surprisingly delicious well made  did taste fast food all really good such decent price  only time restaurant does expensive twisted freezes which basically just shot alcohol into whatever flavor freeze want  prices Twisted Freezes very touristy truth told worth me  alcohol choices your twisted freeze kind limited  basically vodka rum tequila really generic stuff Bacardi     They ton freeze flavors which really including some old classics Baja Blast along new ones freezes pretty cheap around 4 bucks without alcohol   biggest letdown Cantina though actually size now enough warrant star deduction but place small  doesn't downstairs indoor seating all downstairs seating actually patio outside which heated cooled though  upstairs seating really nice plush chairs booths along massive flat screen tvs but seating upstairs limited  If place packed good luck getting seat especially if group you    All all really love Taco Bell Cantina definitely back especially if strip  nice cheap place locals tourists eat without breaking bank great atmosphere  bubbling freeze tanks feel cantina galaxy far far away which really plush seating upstairs sick  really love food really tasty Taco Bell stepped game flagship restaurant  <EOR> The food moderate  felt place could bit less strict because need show receipt order receive your food  workers focused food comes fast  huge issue overprice everything when comes fresco menu which everything tad bit healthier  tastes fresh but good regular  line long few people block passage food guy front talk thru microphone say your name loud  annoyed most  interior though unlike any other Taco Bell  Open 24 7  <EOR> Food good! Music fun! Space sit eat limited though but would recommend! <EOR> How does place 5 stars? Taco bae alcohol? Also amazing music put little extra love into food  Although beer $9   the ambiance completely worth it  <EOR> If give place less four stars well don't want know you  YOU'RE DEAD ME!   Yes Taco Bell  If don't Taco Bell first place you're going either  If you're Taco Bell fan aren't piss good time then place fast food heaven  All processed TB classics atmosphere screams VEGAS!

Nah brah  stay away more tacos me  <EOR> The Taco Bell dreams! such great atmosphere hella fun  Valet free shopping center directly behind cantina which nice too  Definitely must stop place when Vegas  nightclub atmosphere cheap food great late night spot  Definitely going back when see Britney September  <EOR> TLDR worth coming just say you've here  food no different your neighborhood Taco Bell  Only difference alcohol beverages can't back home    Initially came drink eat Taco Bell middle night everyone else comes Vegas    I higher expectations experience but sadly disappointed  Someone ordered bunch food ahead made some upgrades then decided remove items  caused open register freeze  Unfortunately took staff while just open another till  would convenient earlier open more registers amount staff notify long line issues register  time ordered just wanted food  can't say much speciality drinks! Maybe next time   Also didn't able see prepared food  Kitchen staff didn't put wrap paper down countertops before making food  worked food service before deal high volume orders but still managed practice proper food handling protocols  <EOR> It's Taco Bell serves alcoholic slushies  exactly sort place comes mind when think wonder Taco Bell would Las Vegas neon lights towers bubbling liquids racks schlocky merch  <EOR> DO COME HERE! Myself friend food poisoning hour eating here  most likely meat because other friend fine only thing she didn't eat meat    We extremely ill caused miss seminar work  Why fact important?

Nothing some good Taco Bell spice night  <EOR> Of course most lit taco bell place Vegas   Boyfriend bookmarked place way before both Vegas due all hype social media publicity getting  located behind Planet Hollywood Hotel situated near McDonald's well   After walking through outside seating automatic door opens 2016 hip hop music blasting  some fixtures merchandise security guard closely standing supervising area    I'm going lie when say looked lot smaller seemed however taco bell ordering counter looks super cool lights different lighted liquid tubes  Boyfriend treated pina colada tequila along beefy fritos burrito taco himself  Food done long because fast food  indoor seating second floor but packed headed outdoor seating instead  food same basic taco bell stuff but drink won me  super good satisfying midnight munchies    They lot flavors definitely back! Great place cheap cravings  <EOR> I'm giving four stars just off strength taco bell unique  Nothing really special food but atmosphere amazing  Dine inside outside while listening music sipping alcoholic slushy which more spiked Slurpee also sell beer  love that?  People even married taco bell lol Yes married taco bell food package comes which hilarious but hey its VEGAS  customer service great  only thing would say add more alcohol slushy seemed more watery anything then give 5 stars  <EOR> So I'd heard zany Taco Bell where sold alcohol  100% sure expect while killing alot time before show found way over decided check out  over Paris Casino took some photos Eiffel tower next big blue balloon while walking here        Once you're area hard find  Listen ridiculously loud thumping club music  couple 'fancy' restaurants over here  There's Bubba Gumps nearby Gordon Ramsey also place nearby  also some fast food places there's Mcdonalds Subway Krispy Kreme   and place      actually pretty small space  Pretty much your standard Taco Bell sized place  But surely throws big aura  Loud thumping club music blares patio area  There's great big swirling machine flashing lights behind cash registers employees        menu pretty standard except alcohol here  big swirling lighted machines behind registers dispensing alcoholic slushies  Much kind other places strip  looking menu board settled upon quesadilla beer  Girl behind counter nice friendly she took order        She popped empty cup counter beer swirled into it  Bottom  cups bottom fed   nutty  think wowed more whole place  But ya  Alcohol  Taco Bell  Music   pretty much it  But really neat  should check if you're looking weird wacky Las Vegas       There's upper floor but cordoned off visit because people getting married there  Ya  People married Taco Bell  Las Vegas  Man  each discovery kinda city more more  <EOR> Taco Bell Taco Bell    unless you're Las Vegas  then well still Taco Bell  You're still gonna your staple cheesy gordita crunch chalupas all jazz  But thing sets Taco Bell apart others besides name drinks    Yeah don't need PHD Taco ology figure talking here  want frozen drink? Sure  want little extra kick? Well now you're talkin'!   The females family heard not so ordinary T Bell before Vegas trip flying late Sin City made first stop food  But again more drinks    I mean frozen Baja Blast good its own but when add rum thing? Woah  could said liquor choose vodka whiskey even tequila  Nice  Very nice  Beyond basically nothing special service friendly though outside pretty well themed contemporary style Taco Bell complete taco hats purchase course      Overall Taco Bell Cantina worthy stop especially if ever find yourself your neighborhood T Bell 2 30 mornin' night drinkin'  Instead come those drinks along your fourth meal  Enjoy mis amigos  <EOR> Went yesterday party 3 wanted check out  each ordered $15 smoothie alcohol  going upstairs which cool environment TVs tried mixer smoothie things  completing them wasn't nearly lick alcohol them  local would avoid having incredibly overpriced drink would take money fat tuesdays   actually put alcohol drinks   <EOR> Taco Bell late night! No difference food! Best thing drinks too! Genius put strip sure! <EOR> Taco Bell served frozen drinks while sitting patio great music  Can't any better this!!! <EOR> Taco Bell Cantina   it's literally that  food solid Taco Bell few blocks nice residential area status  Service Taco Bell small rural town status  Alcohol small concert venue priced    There's much more it  Pictures seem bigger but even though 2 floors combined add size your normal t bell    Beers available going your average selection you'd find strip bars  Those Baja Blast daiquiri drinks worth having extra shot    Taco Bell Cantina cool expected tiny bit more because mainstream location but necessarily disappointed  wouldn't again but you've least once  <EOR> What ridiculous service! know 3am but if gonna work no matter smile your face good attitude  start cashier no name tag took order rolled when placing order  Though very rude! Then cooks yawning prepping food then smiling because saw yawning! Took 30 minutes food only 4 items  Only 3 people me  Works service ever  <EOR> Awesome experience! Highly recommend Baja Blast which most popular flavor  cool twist traditional Taco Bell location pretty good  mention all margs variety flavors only Taco Bell serve alcohol   Interesting fact if sit upstairs camera shows big screen  ALSO married if you've really thing drunk Mexican food <EOR> I'm somewhat fan Taco Bell glad place wasn't far hote strip  changes knew Taco places almost looking dance club  drinks poured come beer taps there's second floor even order while casually sit comfortable couches  <EOR> Went Saturday night before going quick bite eat obviously say Taco Bell cantina  nice outside has outdoor seating warmer temps those just want outside  When walk immediately immersed loudest music ever hear  Being club quieter music  yell cashier could hear order  some merchandise racks could buy Taco Bell shirts etc  cool option place alcoholic freezes which moderately expensive but bad Vegas price  food itself relatively cheap I two quesadillas medium drink $11   and super good  There's upstairs area different seating arrangements live DJ  Overall definitely worth going but only complaint music loud! <EOR> The coolest Taco Bell ever! Located front cosmopolitan near many night clubs fun attractions!   Items ordered 2 Doritos locos tacos jack coke slurpee!   This Taco Bell hip just cool! outdoor patio great views! atmosphere different any other Taco Bell  Since considered Catina alcoholic beverages available  even carry some fun Taco Bell clothing items!   Overall fun experience  slurpee alcohol $20! Worth vegas! <EOR> Who could pass chance eating tavo bell serves alcohol offers weddings! prices great! just few cents more normally pay which great when your spending elsewhere  did mention ALCOHOL! pina colada rum! actually best pinacolada ever too! other flavors slushies alcohols choose well! Wanting hitched? Well theres upstairs Cantina where mood set tie knot stuff your face tacos  mean sounds dream wedding right?! <EOR> This nice Taco Bell place sell alcohol BUT major pain thing needs change music don't mind DJ all but blast music loud cant even conversation someone sitting right next you  would suggestion maybe having music but don't blast loud cant imagine employees work must ear plugs  Maybe need rethink this  Probably wont but still  food always good drinks great too! <EOR> 40 minutes waiting burrito while watching drunk tourists stroll enduring aural assault ears comprised worst possible pop music highest volumes  Some tourists occasionally wandered into place food theirs before even though ordered standard burrito  Burrito when eventually it regular old Taco Bell tortilla somewhat dry old  Don't bother  taken some other crappy tourist trap strip    <EOR> It's Taco Bell booze  fun gimmick  issue place lack professionalism  cashier order wrong which wasn't big problem because love Taco Bell slight error  really put off staff hanging side manager that's appeared messing around  Just standing could tell they've probably never worked high volume kitchen situation  Example girl doing drink orders didn't ticket drink because cashier no idea she supposed print hand off her    I know guys new but also strip  back because faith ya'll together  <EOR> The overhype factor definitely real   place tiny food menu nothing spectacular   Food looks same no special treatment here   enjoy frozen slush drinks though hands free lemon slush which great treat but wish could tried baja blast   Unfortunately since there's hardly any space gets crowded fast merchandise taking full middle storefront    Overall fun novelty place but feel lot more potential greater  <EOR> Great food but way loud music good cleaning  obviously very busy Strip  <EOR> Um     else need! Beer alcoholic slushes DJ jamming some tunes TACO BELL! 2 story taco bell beauty must any drunk person 3am wandering around Vegas! stopped really isn't much say! place something just see experience! Nothing brings true beauty taco bell lights Vegas dumb drunken night! place slammed but all employees nice super fast     yo grub on! <EOR> When first heard some kind Taco Bell World immediately stoked knew visit next time Vegas  walked across strip found Taco Bell Cantina around Planet Hollywood located right next McDonald's ironically  However despite hype just Taco Bell end day addition alcoholic beverages    You expect extremely crowded although assume somewhat die down when initial excitement wears off  seating upstairs downstairs wait lines stretch across downstairs orders called counter  busy orders don't take long but did run every hot sauce except mild  staff all friendly helpful especially dealing all drunk people such consistent amount orders  Nothing bad other busy just isn't touristy would expect be  Convenient if some Taco Bell munchies want alcoholic slushy! <EOR> To may anything special but place hold heart  Taco Bell although good actually delicious little belly  grew Taco Bell  remember walking nearest near school getting tacos burritos galore  Ever since heard opening planet hollywood alcohol really wanted check out! Finally cinco de mayo gave opportunity try missing  Because special occasion DJ blasting music GOOD music making wanna dance lured in  girls walking around selling tequila shots! felt mini club! But hella cheap food  price same menu would off strip  love much  all different slushee drink flavors choose without alcohol  ordered two shots margarita slushee taco supreme taco burrito  patio inside upstairs seating  upstairs only find DJ more condiments  awesome experience place clean people full energy just lot fun  food ready took shots devoured food didn't want end  never thought would ever give Taco Bell 5 stars but night experience deserved them all  Thank giving boyfriend amazing experience always remember! <EOR> Taco Bell Cantina ALWAYS open perfect hangover cure crazy night Vegas   You'll find same menu any other Taco Bell but serve alcohol blast dance music throughout   also sell kitchy apparel taco hats   interior clubby but still clean   staff really friendly obviously know deal drunk people  <EOR> A Taco Bell serves booze  2 levels DJ  Fast fun  Giving 5 stars because even though super packed guests wasted staff super pleasant actually looked having good time  <EOR> This amazing adaptation Taco Bell's everywhere! loved fact serve alcohol here! perfect strip Las Vegas general! friends came during CES 2017 event even met friends unexpectedly! place popular go! all great flavors Taco Bell's around country plus more! wish more Cantina's more places! definitely back when LV again  <EOR> I tired feet hurt last night but when walked into Taco Bell Cantina vibe amazing gave energy  DJ Tony Sinatra best DJ ever heard  Taco Bell Cantina lit because him  I'd come back Taco Bell Cantina just listen play  always food Taco Bell awesome  drinks AMAZIIIIING! Lemonade Baja Blast Tequila delicious  great combination  If don't Taco Bell urge try Taco Bell Cantina if food then DJ Tony Sinatra  He when Saturday night  Overall great first experience  <EOR> Pretty disappointed just Taco Bell where add some vodka sickenly sweet drinks pay double food  If you're Taco Bell fan would recommend going least once say you've experience because really neat layout but won't ever back  <EOR> What's Fat Tuesday ?   Tried spot last Vegas trip amazing!!! Wish served belvedere any top shelf vodka but drinks flavorful delicious ! two three leaning lol <EOR>
