No manning ship night where famous oyster specials   2  Why staff cleaning dirty tables? Tables sitting idle 15 minutes time while 30 40 minute wait   3   Why does hostess seem understand procedure seating people empty tables? Even when tables cleaned prepared hostess doesn't look behind see where available tables leaving many agitated customers wondering why chose come establishment    I hope executive level management take review use opportunity address concerns pointed out    A great dining experience does only depend meal  great dining experience starts first encounter   Please understand review result whiny customer getting table immediately precipice horrendous treatment hands ill trained staff  <EOR> Finally made !! pleased outcome  Sat counter quickly knew going order  Crab Cakes Shrimp Scampi  crab cakes light fresh tasting seasoned perfectly accompanied great slaw  shrimp scampi portioned perfectly tasty light delicious  Coupled Stella draft pleased!!
