Pulehu steak Korean chicken combo all used order truck would always only meal sometimes order before leaving event Haha nutz dat!  Unfortunately Teri steak breaded steak instead served more basic Pulehu unless special? kinda confused having them very popular truck? Korean chicken ONO remembered breaded Teri beef not bad   Kalua pork little bland very much portion single item entree  The Teri beef very tasty all very chewy  Overall just feels they're still trying work kinks menu only imagine getting all suggestions all customers  I think you're probably hearing same things Pulehu steak ? Haha but bet true  I'm biased local foods all know differences between Hawaiian BBQ places real local Kine grinds Vegas Henderson just fell few spots list places  My 2 cents Pulehu being first Korean chicken being second items menu cool monitor menu  advertise your entrees pictures! It'll lot more eye appeal just seeing ONO everything looks before order   You never satisfy everyone Flip Side menu only made want order Filipino food instead but drove 20 mins local fix  Almost made feel ordering 2 restaurant menu instead 1   I places where know order always satisfied same good old food there're popular hope place them future but now we'll wait see  <EOR> I came today ordered katsu chicken  amazing  portions generous The staff very attentive  really showed true Aloha spirit  Loved it  def coming back more  told try Korean chicken next time  <EOR> Homey atmosphere amazing comforting authentic food even greater people running place  <EOR> Ordered food today but very dissapointed!!! Ordered pork adobo but meat wasnt tender still hard ordered lechon but wasnt expected because cut into small pieces pork thats deep fried wasnt crispy enought!!! Hawaiian fried rice wasn't all great!!!  Ordered peluha steak but didnt much flavor!!! don't whos chef cook but food nothing waste money compare other filipino restaurants Fiesta Loraine Nanay glorias plus food more expensive other filipino restaurants  regret wasting money ordering different dishes just lose interest eating because wasnt good flavorful all  <EOR> Came dinner!!! Amazing food service!!! Clean friendly!  tuna poke amazing chicken teriyaki!!!  Check place out!!! definitely back! <EOR>
