This stop gem strip  Situated second floor Cromwell hotel across Las Vegas Blvd Caesar's Palace view excellent  Depending time day your seating location may even take view Bellagio fountain show  service bit slow spent roughly 15 minutes before anyone came table but server seemed number tables certainly understand delay  lunch special occasion brought own bottle wine  corking fee bit high but Vegas prices $35 but still steal considering almost every wine list ultra premium wine  Once ordered food came exceptionally fast  highly recommend baked pasta day Buratta cheese buffalo mozzarella Baby Sweet Peppers Marinated Olives  total dining experience lasted over 1 1 2 hrs  fulfilled time left  end when check came found corking fee it  may due fact bought many dishes during lunch maybe overwhelmed server simply forgot but weren't complaining I would highly recommend Giada's lunch!

For main course ordered Whole Roasted Chicken Two Charred Asparagus  Sweet Corn The chicken meant two but since family type can't eat whole plate something without getting full just ordered those  When chicken came four hearty pieces chicken type soup sauce included veggies  perfect amount us! asparagus corn side dishes complimented chicken nicely   By time dessert came around everyone pretty full all shared Soufflé  came delicious scoop lemon ice cream waitress scooped soufflé before eyes  Powdered sugar also sprinkled top everything  tasted amazing!  Overall service great besides hostess ! Everyone really nice gave off comforting aura  food fantastic taste quality dishes! would most definitely come back when chance  <EOR> Overpriced especially amount food get  Between snotty attitude hostess other staff towards price wouldn't back  Ravioli undercooked crunchy  Risotto pretty good but bowl $36? C'mon man! Save yourself some money better food more Battista's Hole Wall down street  <EOR> Went lunch  Great vibe! Fresh flavors! Honored gluten dairy free needs  Awesome view! <EOR> Hergelockt hat uns ein Groupon Angebot 40$ Guthaben für Frühstück oder Lunch + 2 kostenlose Gläser Champagner für normalerweise 29$ bei uns nochmal abzüglich 10$   Wir hatten ehrlich gesagt keine großen Erwartungen da allein schon die Lage des Restaurants und somit die Aussicht sich auf den Preis niederschlägt   Am Empfang wurden wir freundlich begrüßt und uns wurde eine Wartezeit von ca  20 Minuten vorhergesagt  Uns wurde aber auch vorgeschlagen der Bar im Restaurant zu essen dann könnten wir uns direkt dort unsere Plätze aussuchen  Da wir ziemlich hungrig waren haben wir das Angebot angenommen  hat man zwar nicht viel von der Aussicht aber das Ambiente ist wirklich toll dass man die Aussicht nicht vermisst  Die Essplätze der Bar werden genauso sorgfältig eingedeckt wie den Tischen außer der Stofftischdecke natürlich   Wir hatten nur kurz unseren Groupon Gutschein vorgezeigt und bald darauf kam schon der kostenlose Champagner  Überraschenderweise wirklich guter und vor allem echter Champagner üblicherweise bekommt sonst eher Sekt der schmeckt wie ein Billigangebot aus Supermarkt wenn auf der Karte Champagne steht   Ehrlich gesagt war allein schon der Champagner unseren bezahlten Groupon Kaufpreis 19$ für beide wert  Wir haben uns beide Pizza bestellt 2 verschiedene   Die Pizza war handgemacht und einfach nur köstlich  Man konnte sogar dem Koch bei der Zubereitung zusehen  Die Form der Pizza ist oval nicht rund und wirkt auf den ersten Blick ziemlich klein  Keine Angst man wird trotzdem richtig satt und das mit Hochgenuss  Wir hatten außerdem eine Flasche Mineralwasser bestellt es war sogar importiertes Wasser aus Italien   Insgesamt ein tolles stimmiges Ambiente zwar zu gehobenen Preisen aber die Speisen sind jeden Cent wert  Wir werden auf jeden Fall wieder dort essen  <EOR> Giada your restaurant amazing your staff incredibly serving sweet! made sure experience great trust remember  busy even though reservations but able wait bar  love knowledgeable friendly barista was   On food ordered famous shrimp pasta! Wow wow wow! Best pasta dish ever those some jumbo shrimp! know some people complained size dish but maybe don't know eat quality food  love food general can't say eat expensive restaurants often but say food always good pay every dollar even if don't leftovers take home  husband ordered steak dish he impressed satisfied! he meat eater!  I strongly believe place deserves all 5 stars! bad reviews almost scared away trying place but glad didn't  Hope try if haven't already  <EOR> I expecting robust flavor but severely disappointed  risotto bland inconsistent along spaghetti lack spices richness small meatballs overpriced I am aware Vegas strip but $56 extreme     returned nice day  lunch hoping previous evening just off night kitchen   But salumi pizza served lackluster well  <EOR> First time diners restaurant   came celebrate 14th wedding anniversary  high hopes place completely let down  reserve table window $100 per person minimum requirement  waitstaff takes pre authorization credit card form before arriving  Ok whatever figured dinner wine would cover no problem  Arrive table find dirty silver ware which occurred multiple times throughout evening  tables crammed couldn't sit without pushing hitting person's chair behind me  But hey window seat   Ordered two appetizers duck prosciutto burrata cheese  duck great  cheese took 26 minutes  asked if made fresh waiter said no pre made just need plate it  tortellini  risotto  Both good but amazing which hoping  portions small which didn't bother all  ordered limoncello soufflé tasted scrambled eggs!  Now know soufflé should taste order chocolate soufflés all time pretty sure never tasted breakfast   Now never looking free meal experience no different  all crap manager comp'ed dessert  Thanks nothing Giadas!  can't time money back!

Dessert did disappoint polenta cake tomato strawberry jam! Mascarpone cheesecake! those lemon cookies omg few extra things take back hotel room fridge when told Cliff favorites   TL DR Giada disappoint would 100% recommend any special occasion may celebrating Vegas  service food ambience top marks  <EOR> So happy finally made Giada! food great thanksgiving day tried tasting menu  starter fresh variety great  second course even better each course getting better full dessert  tasting course $80 bucks well worth price return  asked sat terrace because view Bellagio however windows open chilly  <EOR> I excited bring best friend Giada birthday  However entire meal ruined awful server  We waited 30 minutes past reservation time which accept such busy place but would nice if any acknowledgement wait all  Especially considering 6 15 made reservations 2 months advance  Instead watched hostesses twirled hair looked bored  bestie looked past though previously August fun delicious meal  Once finally seated waiter came greet us  He very friendly telling all menu wine  demeanor changed immediately upon learning drinking alcohol  couldn't drink friend did want drink without me  however still very prepared eat ton indulge!

Second visit party 6   daughter wanted bday since she heard I'd enjoyed first time   made reservations forgetting request window view darn tried recall menu accommodate 3x many people   Entire party family members already knowing palate also knowing none 'starving' being later dinner 8pm figured we'd order more plates first visit all would 'okay'   Wrong!

Next pasta own pasta house front open kitchen  Waiter said lobster asparagus ravioli bland lobster chewy even hint sauce help it  Crab scallop risotto scallop perfectly cooked then other bland tasteless dish crab must run away couldn't detect any dish   Entrees branzino good lamb came under cooked refire right temp but bland filet bland   Wine service poor white wines placed ice buckets no ice wine started warm    Desert run round cart when waiter puts plate no presentation cart would rid off work presentation    Maybe reasons hard into service slow there's no tables turning ! It's prices rest strip portions small   all off nights but better fix what's wrong it'll bye bye Giada!! <EOR> Went Giada Sunday brunch deeply disappointed   walked away thinking  if Food Network propped the Chef hmmm   way see amount pay better exceptional food exceptional service Giada neither  Don't wrong food wasn't bad just any better other no name Italian restaurant  Service poor waitress can't even manage simple task refilling drink   only thing Giada going great local overlooking  Strip  Wish didnt' step through door least admiration Giada's the Chef cooking prowess would stay intact  <EOR> The decor wonderful   delightfully modern Italian but very comfy   food ok   bread disappointing    where REAL Italian bread?  waitress Lauren ok   a bit forced service    food good but spectacular very pricey   wine glass very good   Would back?

Joseph provided most spectacular service EVER entire life  He made best recommendations treated family way feel special  single item wasn't packed flavor!

Complimentary selection breads 2 kinds only extra condiment very good delicious but arrived 30 minutes first table encounter  ask them  Seeing white jacket service high prices but no white clothes tables made feel something right  Table service seemed overwhelmed forgetful  focus understand waiter  He nice but wrong profession  no connection any staff came away almost felt everyone under pressure doing jobs but without any good execution  Fellow operated desert cart only having fun while working    Planning having romantic dinner and or conversations? Giada restaurant place due very high level noise  combination outside inside noise unbearable left headache  hard seat through    Desert options very limited exceeding  tiramisu expected extremely sweet  enjoyed specialty orange coffee though but wait them it    Artichoke soup Lobster raviolis Risotto excellent  give 5 stars!

Shouldn't then Somali unsure spelling wasn't great offering suggestions made excuses why only ordered case begin with  found something else she offered nothing but group did husband's choice  finally ordered numerous appetizers  Pizzette not great all some kind three bean salad excellent except Baruta cheese odd flavor Parmesan cheese definitely favorite but never is dates bacon loved would order again bread give came ordered those things think should brought when first arrived but apparently don't didn't ask   Frankly didn't care loved tabke much could just sat eating all   Then ordered dinner basically shared   lemon spaghetti chicken my friend ordered didn't love originally she going order italian fish probably should gotten it ordered tortellini dish peas yellow sauce pancetta which ordered side all things kosher very good whole chicken delicious catchatori sauce side    very yummy chicken perfect lamb excellent   Service good all staff seemed happy but could better wine lady even waiter but he ok too   Dessert then offered 6$ each taking did cookies choclate chip peanut butter jelly  lemon iced cookie chocolate Grenache small rich something called nipples my husband that  chocolate inside white chocolate outside 3 small ones something waiter loved kind small cookie strawberries top called tomato something other not great    fact all desserts beautiful but all honesty fantastic any means  forgot mention men also ordered cocktails which recipes giadas grandfather liked those  point manager came over say hello  He didn't introduce himself he didn't come 3 feet table  weird unimpressive but wanted know if liked place quickly scurried away  Anyway meal fun interesting  Dinner ran close $550 tip  very expensive thought but personally view worth whole thing  Id tell people try themselves  really wanted try but don't need return unless lunch girlfriends fun good atmosphere  found without reservation sit bar first come first serve  restaurant full maybe table asked view ahead locals  knows but if sat somewhere else don't know if would enjoyed much though entire decor really nice but weren't facing restaurant  the strip fountains ceasars flamingo road fabulous! <EOR> Really amazing experience  read lot bad reviews skeptical especially because I'n very picky especially 5 star restaurants  local girlfriends celebrate publishing first book  Really enjoyed food waiter Tim he nice even wrote congratulations chocolate sauce dessert plate  bacon wrapped dates Tricolored Salad lemon potatoes  friends ordered Salmon some Indian dish  All extraordinary! Yes VERY expensive but typical type venue  bill came $215 including tip  3 people 1 glass celebratory moscato dessert share  just much would spend restaurants Bellagio but view beautiful decor very clean modern beautiful well  Wish some dishes little more resonably priced  But eh  all delicious very good experience  much better other reviews made be  <EOR> 3 5 stars   told myself would write more reviews last foray favorite city but writing review Giada tough   equal amounts pluses minuses mind    and fact Giada DeLaurentis fantasy woman don't tell wife review especially difficult but goes   You need reservations well ahead time   Right now restaurant seems hottest thing around even calling month ahead only 10 15 p m  reservation    The Cromwell seems nicely redone   Leaving taxi walked through casino escalator leading straight Giada   bustling even 10 00   While waited took advantage photo booth a definite thumbs up!  The restaurant woman beautiful so      tasteful   Should expect less?  table gave partial view Caesar's Bellagio  Clientele well dressed except party 4 dudes shorts jerseys baseball caps worn backwards     Giada opened windows letting cool fall air   Good theory but few things worked against ambience   First all restaurant bit noisy considering beautiful people dining    ahem   night sirens cut through restaurant every few minutes  We found later distubance occurred downtown  waiter seemed know stuff wry demeanor liked   problem timing synch ours   instance he ready take drink orders when still deciding between red white along food   When decided he gone   know could used iPad but neither wife nor could where wanted it   general everything little slow    ordering drinks food coffee check   always waiting        The food perplexing   Servings small but ingredients quality   Tastes innovative but necessarily wanted   instance imagined Crispy Oysters Rockefellers would spinachy cheesy bacony rich sauce thought would crisped somehow  My vocabulary growing! Now maybe wrong but although oysters fresh cooked tasted mignonette sauce wine vinegar    think crispy part bacon   refreshing different but looking for   The same thing happened spaghetti shrimp   wasn't expecting much lemon first bite surprised me  rich  cheesy pasta needs eaten hot  grew ate while might think isn't enough shrimp quite large cooked perfectly   I should asked more questions each dish     at least then wouldn't off balance much   would give food 4 stars but service gets only 3 stars all waiting      I still love Giada        <EOR> Went lunch first day Las Vegas   menu somewhat limited brunch antipasti   few sandwiches but great options   food good but great   Service very slow waiter seemed assigned many tables   Family disappointed no French fries only zucchini straws which kinda fries   Great location acoustics good  <EOR> By far best meal trip Vegas  bread condiments delicious  three apps artichoke balls crostini orzo meatballs  All good! veal saltimbucco meal excellent!! Everyone party enjoyed food all thought best place we emerils carnevino other nights   Also great atmosphere Giadas  <EOR> Was sure expect disappointed other celebrity chef restaurants  Giadas definitely disappointment  decor lovely inviting  husband both started Lemon Chicken soup  light super flavorful  husband pan roasted salmon which cooked perfection  lobster ravioli  lemon butter sauce great  Desert lemon soufflé served flourish when server added lemon gelato soufflé    Why 5?  Service everything while service excellent server Brian did miss couple points  First he never explained tasting menu  heard other servers giving great detail cost not menu left asking awkward much options menu other details  other meal served forgot items when he walked asked he bent down really close plate said oh can't even see it  Then he told caviar  knew but did say anything way checked menu pumpkin seed gremolata  expect server know menu up  <EOR> You're paying view space certainly can't come cheap  Food fine consistent  Nothing wowed which troublesome price point  Great knowledgeable staff but can't remember single dish ordered  <EOR> The food simply amazing  atmosphere relaxing classy elegant  Worth trip! <EOR> Getting reservation little hard but worth eating dinner 10 15  ambiance great very comfortable  decor classy well don't order much! <EOR> Food very average well service  celebrating sister in law's birthday  I mentioned front desk please send dessert birthday  very surprised everyone else table skimpy  just 2 little cookies gigantic plate candle   wouldn't serve anyone  Would recommend restaurant  <EOR> We nice experience Giada   Nice 2nd story open air views Strip   Much cooking show decor simple classy comfortable   Both white red sangrias large very refreshing   Margherita pizza great   giving 3 stars since made mistake ordering Sweet Ricotta pizza which sweet goopy considered pizza   would sent back but figured ordering mistake   would probably try Giada again but stick more standard fare  <EOR> Just most amazing experience Giada's!

She rolled eyes walked away without saying word while came back move table over which fine just literally being blinded sun shining through huge windows    However    server Joseph completely amazing   overly solicitous yet made himself available whenever needed anything   Extremely knowledgeable professional   long way recovering rude hostess     And food lemon pasta shrimp unbelievable delicious   Still dreaming it! <EOR> The waiter amazing professional  food very carefully cooked tasty  Would recommend couple  little bit expensive though  <EOR> Everything place beautiful   environment outfits atmosphere plating scenery   Make reservation window seats   Food great bit pricy portions small lunch amounts bulk made appetizers just plated fancy   Pizza great  <EOR> Came girlfriend huge Giada fan talking new restaurant months  started marinated calamari cool refreshing Las Vegas heat charred octopus tender made even better sprinkling Provided finishing salt over top  also order salumi hints truffle also amazing  main entree whole roasted chicken cacciatore  Best roasted chicken ever had!

THE MEDIOCRE bacon wrapped dates good but little sweet taste know should've expected ordering dates     The destroyer cocktail more expensive tequila shot nice drink can't really taste any fruit through tequila    All all great dinner wonderful atmosphere bey helpful sweet staff  coming back definitely getting fritto misto again! <EOR> Amazing food service   Lovely ambiance   servers Fred Brandon both amazing   Lemon spaghetti shrimp lamb chops fantastic  plan back every time back Vegas  <EOR> Amazing!  Best lunch ever probably new favorite restaurant   Orzo meatballs delicious pizza dough very good lasagna surprisingly light being baked pasta dish   Everything fresh very flavorful   restaurant absolutely beautiful nice views   enjoyed much already made reservations return dinner  <EOR> After following show buying cookbooks finally able try Giada's restaurant  restaurant beautiful ambiance very nice fancy but comfortable  But food especially pasta really disappointing  seemed overcooked! dishes also small expensive which ok since going nice place  But having mushy pasta really disappointing Italian restaurant  don't think we'll back  <EOR> Decline Service!   The reason lower rating due service   2nd time dined Giada's service very much declined since first opened   arrived 45 minutes before scheduled reservation drinks bar area   drinks good blue velvet prosecco but waitress spilled entire glass water me   she avoided plague   next 1 5 hours until actually seated they 45 minutes past reservation sat cold wet dress no drinks she never came back check refill water    She literally would pass even though tried attention multiple times   When finally sat down waiter hardly spoke English   He kept looking around barely would answer questions menu   taking order he didn't return check until dessert   Again he just stood couldn't really answer questions dessert   Since before knew lemon cookies best ordered cookie plate again   liked Giada years   watch cooking shows regular basis own many cookbooks very disappointed second visit   hope service improves future customers sit through whole dinner cold wet clothes  <EOR> High expectations   Limited brunch menu  Overall antipasto entrée items under seasoned  Ambience classy over top given Las Vegas glitz  Check once done till change menu chef again     <EOR> I love Giada   can't hate her   mean look smile!!  Major girl crush   But isn't her   restaurant   really gotta hand her   menu setup restaurant reflects consideration guests   isn't about? Treating your customers something good right? beautiful restaurant food pretty too     We ordered bunch appetizers including proscuitto tricolor salad which both very yummy   also ordered pizzette but never came   Apparently kitchen lost ticket but getting full eat pizza didn't want anyway   server handled very well apologizing mix gracious enough comp dessert   I ordered signature cocktail wasn't into either   drinker person ask drink recommendations but strong reminded some type cleaning fluid   But doesn't all alcohol   ?  I wasn't super impressed lobster ravioli rack lamb   no cheese ravioli! big cheese but think husband assessed fairly well when he said like    Chinese dumpling   There's meat juices wrapped dough but missing part Italian  lamb okay but think could less chewy   For dessert little cheesecake blood orange sliver top lemon cookie chocolate chip cookie chocolate brownie cookie   desserts yummy indeed   man presenting desserts however bit honest when asked recommendation   Here's Us Which like? Man Honestly? Nothing  8 months working nothing good me   OOOOOOOK   That guy should working there   Although 11pm time ready dessert wasn't expecting any staff blatantly dissuade ordering anything   But eh   still think dessert terrific   Anyways   Minus star sad entrees but good time ! <EOR> 6 party dinner  Cocktail called Hannibal awesome  ambiance real nice loved spacious round table comfy upholstered dining chairs   I ordered romaine salad fried capers vinigrette Caesar  dressed well saturated liked flavor  Missed fried capers few memorable  two croutons sucked may well left off   The bucatini alright  Again liked but price   al dente stuck teeth good way  Lacked sauce!!!

So if small portions trust won't need doggy bag care less if there's  any yummy sauce mop up   Bread more soggy garlic ball crusty much Rosemary   Then pricey strip won't likely return  <EOR> Our waiter Brian he awesome!!!  during lunch sweet ricotta pizza lobster roll sliders grilled cheese lasagne  All excellent highly recommend coming here  Can't wait come back again  <EOR> Service sucks   reservations arrived early sat immediately   Waited over 5 minutes waiter   Diego waiter   Very abrupt   ask take wine order he took appetizer order  Took forever wine   Appetizers arrived but wine   food delicious   Pricey but good   Very loud rock music playing   Music didn't fit restaurant    Bathroom soap dispenser pump yourself style   Seemed very cheap considering pricey restaurant  did try redeem themselves two birthday cookies birthday girls  <EOR> As local looking forward coming quite some time  Love Giada Food Network tried recipes   Friends told impressed forgo coming but thought being foodie snobs wasn't going deterred  Made earliest dinner reservation took husband birthday  walking table pleasant hostess wished happy birthday seated felt dark secluded cramped hallway right against wall  Hubby made compensating remarks didn't want fuss moved   There no price tasting menu shame asking  $140 per person no drinks  food ok no wow moments  pasta most disappointing bit tough  Service ok bit late water ice tea refills  never asked if wanted another glass wine  leave my back main dining area leaving saw beautiful view other reviewers mentioned  apologized husband dragging birthday  He would preferred good Steakhouse  Sadly place recommend tourist friends and or locals  <EOR> Service decor everything expected Giada offer   nervous food some recipes bit safe side lot adaptations them  However blown away! food ahmazzzing! table favorite soup but everything fantabulous! <EOR> An amazing meal  waiters attentive but subtle  food delicious  view strip stunning  <EOR> Extremely happy service food checking out!

I reccomande salmon tricolor salad! <EOR> My friends visited Las Vegas first time week 6 30 through 7 7   decided Saturday night would enjoy fine dining experience then see nightlife offer   dressed headed strip sometime around 7PM   debating where eat settled Giada she partner I's favorite chef all!    all dressed appropriate attire however reception desk treated though walked wearing flip flops tattered shorts   made way escalator approached desk   young dirty blonde haired woman greeted stated party 6 wished dinner   She started say Oh m sorry but we    moment another blonde haired woman slightly older literally nudged elbow said nice    She then preceded ask if would perhaps see menu before seated   Essentially she insinuating obviously could afford meal looked part boot   infuriated however being opposite hey assumed played along agreed see menu   then whisked away tour kitchen area finally seated   drink menu very unique based Giada's father's favorite films Hannibal which great partner Barbarella his favorite film which equally refreshing   ordered Giada's favorites calamari table antipasto spaghetti tortellini pasta shared porterhouse steak side polenta   food amazing just expected however treatment staff left sour taste mouths   other patrons sitting near wearing shorts t shirts whom am sure treated were   main reason opinion because mostly looked Hispanic unlike fairer skinned individuals poorly dressed   While food amazing visiting Giada again   myself experienced true Italian hospitality unfortunately nowhere found Giada  <EOR> First all book Giada  anniversary dinner staying Cromwell hotel made super convenient try restaurant!   arrived 7 15 dinner reservations wait another 15 minutes table !  restaurant very pretty great views city if re lucky enough table near windows   Ours sadly quashed between other tables did feel very warm inviting anniversary celebration especially when group extremely intoxicated flip flop wearing loud f bomb dropping people promptly seated next !  Yup table others openly happy seated !  Unbelievable!  prices food definitely could discomfort having listen group through entire dinner   said something waiter he just smiled sent over manager    She came over essentially said bad better luck next time attitude she couldn't move table anyway !   saw many empty tables she could moved !   guess airlines if someone more VIP comes need those tables them !   Bottom line all money restaurant food comfort its guest !   drunks next huge bar tab encouraged cater !   Profits over great dining experience Giada all about   Would never try place again ! <EOR> I always fan Giada  excited able window table dinner  Once seated every thing started wrong  waiters English bad difficulty understanding he saying us  made could order first course  took long time arrive but city street view kept entertained   order second course pasta when arrived both luke warm pasta gummy possibly sitting long only few bites  never saw  waiter again  finally gave ordering main course flagged down hostess bring check  waiter dropped bill said something to day no idea 200 00 minim sit window even completing meal very disappointing  received less service then counter Waffle House  way still wondering if waiters accent poor English put on  <EOR> Absolutely worst dining experience ever! wait staff awful  food cold  wife's medium well steak rare being told allow additional time medium well  crab ravioli cold  top off server never returned table no opportunity ask them fix it  all night cafe hotel  Next night Mesa  Sorry Giada ex better! <EOR> Hmm    Where begin? Having watched Giada's show years having lived Italy child currently living Las Vegas now super excited female Italian chef open authentic Italian restaurant right strip  Unfortunately only positive restaurant restaurant itself  Located inside Cromwell Hotel Casino ambiance creates airy fun filled scene beautiful breathtaking views whimsical white washed shutters allow summer winds slowly blaze in  visuals Italian deli candid photo booth add right amount style gorgeous setting  However food nothing more mediocre portions small prices high service non existent  much hype very expensive price  <EOR> We dined last night early valentine's day celebration    locals working industry very rarely celebrate anything actual day  When first arriving restaurant noticed beautifully decorated hotel entrance restaurant was   If remember Bill's before would agree much face lift place got   checked photo booth before dinner since 5 mins before reso didn't seat right away   walked booth hostess told table ready but worry pictures cuz paper print them    Why wouldn't put sign something guests know email photos themselves?   take pictures all   Whatever!  followed hostess seemed back corner restaurant   table she tried seat literally corner deuce close might well dinner couple next party 4   asked if any other table would available    She wait lounge while she back check   didn't mind wait 15 20 mins ordered cocktail start   Great selling tactic if one!  Taylor hostess came back escort table window overlooking fountains   She super friendly accomadating!  Honestly willingness help probably highlight night   Once table server came over greeted presented wine list dinner menu   He took moment explain menu some signature dishes   gm came over interrupted during spiel said hi said something server then walked away   Weird  And he never touched table that torn between couple different items asked server he would recommend    He didn't seem if he wanted answer questions   Almost if bothering him    ended ordering orzo meatballs bacon wrapped dates burrata tricolore salad start   all good nothing spectacular    bread selection good though    wanted order bottle wine but couple questions sommelier    He tied another table didn't chance order wine until done apps   little disappointing    defense apps did come quite quickly   But still no likes rushed   weird thing apps came super quick but waited long time entrees    entrees spaghetti signature dish    huge prawns lemon capers   sounds better paper was   bf pasta pork ragout    Both dishes very bland   add salt red pepper flakes bread presentation spice up   hate say but super disappointed    heard many good things place but didn't anything good ourselves   dessert cart see going around apparently only patrons ordered tasting menu   don't your hopes when see unless tasting menu   ordered cookies dessert since nothing really jumped us   unique    soon dug into cookies server dropped check   Obviously he someplace else way!  Overall disappointed   mention once bottle wine opened keep pouring ourselves   Maybe $100 bottle wine cheap any sort table maintenance    server hardly came check us   Maybe just critical place maybe having off day   But none less many great options city Giadas top list   Sometimes people work same industry much more critical others   maybe really knows  <EOR> Giada Should Ashamed!  Several months ago Giada's  Restaurant very nice breakfast excellent service   Based previous visit back again  disappointment!  made reservation 9am which time restaurant opened   Even though only two other parties waiting seated took 2 hostesses 10 minutes seat table   menus waited 10 minutes waiter ask if wanted coffee wanted order   several waiters room only 3 tables 2 people each large party 15 people  He acted if he doing favor taking order   told come back enjoy delicious donuts last time   He told Giada did serve them breakfast anymore   asked other sweets he said pastry basket     We ordered meal  brought omelet bread no butter jam   finally able flag down waiter asked butter jam more coffee   time he came back entrees toast cold   9 45 when restaurant only open 45 minutes ordered pastry basket   waiter came back told no more because large party taken them all   asked if could donuts any other muffin sweet  He said he nothing offer   I hostess asked send manager table   name Frank Gibase   He said waiter wrong because happened chef burnt most pastries morning when  he making them couldn't serve them   few burned large party   again asked if could donuts any other sweet   He hardly acknowledged problem didn't even apologize disappointment   never back  <EOR> I finally eat favorite food network stars' restaurant did disappoint! ambiance decor restaurant classy upscale yet managing stay warm inviting   We did tasting menu everything delicious  then when dessert cart came around kids wanting everything sight   But took experience next level service table Cliff   he instantly warm inviting great big smile  He above beyond accommodating vegetarian options tasting menu making sure left plenty eat  He also recommended yummy St  Germaine spritzers anniversary toast   These just few things made experience Giada's memorable when Vegas again certainly back dine restaurant  <EOR> I've Giadas 2x first experience great but second Horrible  waiter took seemed 15 minutes take order even though menus closed longest time sitting right next waiter stand  looked over menu questions since favorites first visit hoping husband try  asked dishes he said rudely he doesn't know dish is  He asked if came dinner said yes he rudely said we'll  dinner don't it  Made feel stupid even asking  husband already disappointed but wanted most Anniversary Lunch  He checked maybe once twice see things but wasn't sociable all always w o smile  When came dessert again asked dessert loved 2 weeks prior again he rudely said don't know told ingredients husband asked if he knew may called he said don't know while shrugging shoulder again making feel stupid asking  decided wanted ASAP because facial expression attitude tone comments made very uneasy skipped desert somewhere else  topped off although knew anniversary offered nothing Happy Anniversary no going extra mile service  Even chain restaurants offer something  All all food good but disappointing raved first dining experience when come husband 2 weeks later celebrate anniversary received total opposite  If say anything positive I'd say try going dinner   ** 2 stars because first experience great otherwise would 1  <EOR> Save your $$$!  much better places enjoy nice meal Vegas   recently ate lunch very excited   However spending over $200 three people lunch feeling anything special meal excitement quickly changed regret   iced tea zero flavor did meatballs  salad also boring nothing special   Stouffers better lasagna   waiter somewhat rude really didn't know much menu   ended ordering dessert which actually best part meal only reason review star instead zero   high hopes actually dinner reservations next night   However lunch disappointing quickly canceled those   guess should've known    never trust skinny cook!

Spaghetti arrived cold undercooked   Manager Gracie offered re cook supposedly made order dish but agured situation  should comped  If Giada plans opening Los Angeles acceptable  LA higher expectations Vegas tourists    Neighboring table same experience food  Said watier weird   <EOR> First time big fan giada high hopes  loved meal  lemon crab arrancini rigatoni vegetable bolognese surf turf  felt watching shows eating dishes she describes them  She cooks lots lemon parsley parmesan which definitely present restaurant dishes she's putting things menu she really would does cook   The arrancini light inside super crispy good lemon flavor  bolognese terrific very earthy flavor bold when meat but vegetables    I think style cooking good fresh flavors but   overly complex  taste pea soup actually taste peas parsley maybe touch mint maybe lemon too  think appreciate kind style really enjoy meal here   I actually also recipes tv shows home good accessible  Sometimes find recipes need buy many ingredients broke  spend much time prepping exhausted time your done cooking   I really feel style cooking reflected here   All all thought food delish  Prices quite reasonable high end place  bill $136 before tip but included glass wine  appetizer two mains   Would definitely back  <EOR> It's upscale restaurant  much vegetarian choices  Service Food food excellent  would highly recommend place  <EOR> I want start saying would written negative review if could spoke 1 employee 2 week time span work problem   Instead given multiple numbers call which corporate people referred back restaurant   number suppose hostess station Giada's would ring 2 times then back corporate reservation line   happened no matter day time called     My fiancée pre dinner cocktail app   ordered bacon wrapped figs 1 glass wine some kind cocktail drink   bill 47 dollars   left 5 dollar tip since just 1 round   When checked bill credit card statement total 97 something  bartender given himself 51 dollar tip   Now math wiz but sounds he added 1 5 tip line     For being newer high profile celebrity restaurant customer service complete joke  feel embarrassed Giada hope she takes little more 'hands on' approach prevent any further criminal activity restaurant  Also  making  some kind management available customers deal types issues over phone rather social media ?  I did dispute charge credit card also quickly realized scam refunded money  <EOR> We breakfast Giada's underwhelming  eggs mediocre best dry very tasty  frittata ordered didn't even come slice toast  pitiful  aunt scrambled eggs which unseasoned bland  lemon smashed potatoes didn't taste lemon all    tasted dried potatoes left all day  yuck  don't here  save your money  <EOR> Ok facility nice   However drastically overpriced portions very small needed fur coat because freezing point hardly being able focus dinner   'Italian' restaurant menu sucked   Won't back ever  <EOR> Beautiful place   Great service   But food quite disappointing   always impressed celebrity's TV cooking but food very ordinary very expensive   Veal chop calamari breaded fried tasted could most any diner   roasted asparagus overly roasted tasting funny taste   The whole chicken presented then taken back kitchen cut tomato vegetable accompaniment put into serving bowl   probably best tasting dish   Lobster ravioli good Salumi appetizer but price none food met expectations   Like another reviewer sparkling still water options leave feeling upsold  <EOR> Terribly disappointed expensive such fare! Pasta everyone's dishes undercooked! Lobster ravioli 1 inch square = just 7 each serving! Short rib raviolis too! Requested table window when making reservation we're told would additional $100 00 each person party! You've kidding party six six o'clock! No party ever recommend nor visit place again  neon sign outside wasn't even properly lit just a ! Just because name Giadas doesn't even tasty restaurant!

Sadly experience did live expectations  service atrocious restaurant caliber   Since table 6 still being turned over when arrived suggested drink bar while waited  took bar wait staff 10 min acknowledge another 10 server come say she'd bring bar menus clean table  menus arrived chance give quick glance drink order did put until 30 min arrival  40 min arrival hostess came back take table let know drinks hadn't arrived requested them sent table  She told she needed check since usually close bar tab before seating  checking coming back seeming inconvenienced she took table left saying server would right us  No food drink menus left water offered  Strike 1! took another 15 min server arrive introduced himself said he'd bring drinks bar when ready  He turning walk away when quickly stopped request water menus brought table return since he did offer water ask if needed anything before turning away  Strike 2!  This basically set tone rest meal  huge periods between water drinks food courses where server nowhere sight other staff zoomed without second glance  some point full drink accidentally tipped over  could any staff assist timely manner the 3 4 staff passed did attempt stop help just said they'd waiter used own table napkins clean spill off floor  When waiter finally came around he seemed indifferent spill since already wiped didn't offer replacement drink nor did he offer bring new table napkins replace ones balled floor  Strike 3!  Side note food good but truly memorable  crab scallop risotto which enjoyed but did blow away  pizzettes seemed enjoyed those ordered them well spaghetti dish  did bring birthday cookie plate friend  bday coming glazed lemon cookie probably most memorable item night  Yummy!  All all all other fine dining options Vegas strip don't see myself returning based service alone  sad since love watching Giada's shows    Quick tip hit free photo booth entrance only high points evening  <EOR> We eaten twice probably back again  food just price pay eat restaurant  mushroom appetizer just okay  salads okay   Nevertheless both shared pizza should've desert list sweet  Ricota cheese pizza made way rich <EOR> Very disappointing especially all hype!   service ambiance good except 5 servers tell each other ones did   Ordered 3 appetizers calamari which hard tasteless came neither lemon nor sauce salad which soggy some slices beef which hard day old bagette slices very salty   We also ordered sparkling wine which flat tasteless     Great idea photo box outside take photos however no paper machine   Even when back following day when told would paper none  <EOR> What say other INCREDIBLE    The layout design decor restaurant made feel beautiful home dinner  fancy place wait staff typically pretentious type but instead very down earth personable  then food absolutely amazing   Ordered following ANTIPASTI shared amongst 4 Bacon wrapped dates Orzo meatballs Lobster Arancini Prosciutto Burrata  The orzo meatballs probably favorite  Lobster arancini good though wouldn't necessarily recommend it  finally someone doesn't dates bacon wrapped dates point  Prosciutto Burrata very good quality    Main shared between 2 Spaghetti shrimp lemon basil Risotto crab scallops Side Sweet corn spicy sausage  I spaghetti which really enjoyed  sauce very light but just perfect amount flavor able really enjoy fresh pasta  Side sweet corn spicy sausage bit spicy but very good     Overall very memorable dinner environment service food course dessert cart!

Recently try friend told Giada place Vegas     I thought atmosphere great establishment clean airy light fresh  great place eat lunch sunny day strip     I'll start loved then explain why gave 3 Stars   menus selection great everything ordered cooked perfectly tasted great   serving staff pleasant accommodating apologetic anything may gone wrong   tried order selection dishes apps mains even though wasn't going finish all them though almost did could great feel offerings   All but dessert impressed me   Sadly thought brownie dessert hard brownie 'frozen ' maybe really was   Pizza selection great Giada's burger fantastic   Even waffles dish great too    Sadly give 3 Stars because when walked took while host approach when she did she somewhat short rude condescending   didn't help later during visit she swigging water directly big Acqua Panna bottle bar   just thought way looked unprofessional she could easily poured into glass drank it   house     Add'l plenty open tables yet some reason waking without reservation meant next available 2 30PM noon when walked in!!   lounge area middle tons seating yet wa stood no food service there     Finally told could sit bar but also full   decided head bar look myself found a  Inner empty seats too     Pics attached even Acqua Panna bottle swigging though blurry b c won't publicly disparage anyone don't know rules Giada's       To defense Saturday 10th heard many places short staffed weekend since vacation previous weekend's super bowl biggest weekend Vegas hear    could lead reason many open tables but 2 5 hours wait seated    ? <EOR> I group 6 recent trip Vegas  person wanted check Giada's figured would great spot lunch  loved idea love Food Network! didn't reservations considering around 11am Tuesday didn't  think they'd busy not  no problem getting without reservation and many people behind also did reservations but still waited 10 15 minutes table  sat round table fit all wasn't if needed put tables together  Once seated thought ambiance place great! Also being able see going behind scenes fun when glanced over shoulders   Everyone able find something menu eat even knowing some terms meant certain dishes  brunch lunch menu which nice variety  ordered Muffuletta Arugula Salad very good!   husband ordered Margherita Pizza very good   Others party Strawberry Polenta Waffles Breakfast American couple other sandwiches  Most enjoyed food presented well   The downfall visit waiter which why gave 3 stars  He friendly treated teenagers all mid 30's  He never gave drink menus offered answer any questions items menu which may questions on  over anything really  sister in law asked Mountain Dew she specify he basically told he no idea they served Pepsi products   ordering food husband restroom stopped bar way back ask drink beer menu  few minutes later waiter came over spoke very condescending way husband didn't believe having Mountain Dew  very rude  looking over drink menu ordered Giada's Sangria Prosecco knowing white wine version Sangria  waiter confirmed white which OK but manner which he confirmed rubbed wrong way  husband decided Pale Ale brought Brown Ale instead  Due comment previously made husband didn't feel need stir pot more saying waiter he may brought wrong kind beer he still drank it  waiter rarely came check even refill waters although only couple other tables could see   As leaving 3 girls took pics photobooth which great idea   waited waited waited pic print out  Finally asked host table said must paper could pics again  Um    should sign says paper could emailed posted Facebook  deal breaker but excited those pics  decided just leave   So overall    enjoyed food atmosphere restaurant  fun say Giada's trip  service less desired stick more food if someone asks experience there  sure why waiter treated way he did but unacceptable  admit tipped very small although 6 people meals drinks pretty good size bill  very small chance we'd ever back during any future trips Las Vegas advise people negatives versus positive  great experience  <EOR> Finally try place! Excellent ambiance dined lunch  Very good service  very busy  Waldorf salad share which very good  husband tenderloin sliders which he claims best came fried zucchini crisps  margarita pizza flatbread which HORRIBLE  why 3 stars  First all came cold send back  Even barely warm  tomatoes sour mozzarella cheese even melted  Dough no salt no seasoning  tiramisu desert which perfect sweet light  Portions small but just right us  heard famous bread which learnt stopped serving lunch I hope dinner better experience  <EOR> Giada restaurant famed chef Giada de Laurentiis  Cromwell there's great view restaurant Las Vegas strip  arrived bit early reservation started bar wine  Great service bar Riesling best had  Once seated server excellent explaining menu answering questions  platter 3 types bread  parmesan flatbread then grissini focaccia which accompanied basil pesto capers red pepper sea salt  focaccia great but wasn't big fan parmesan flatbread  starter course bacon wrapped dates  great came chili oil which gave them nice kick differentiated same dish other places  main dish pappardelle which pork ragout  pasta cooked perfectly then ragout great well  execution error took long time second glass wine finishing first but aside service pretty good  <EOR> So glad Giada chose Vegas first restaurant welcome open arms! good gets true foodie view ambiance just add great experience  Couple suggestions if group 4 more order bunch aps salads throw few micro pizzas but pass mortadella pizza only average every item offers different taste good next  Then pick pasta share portion size relatively small but good share still need main course  pasta light sauce 2 jumbo shrimp think signature pasta heavenly T bone cut into slices table largest cuts beef ever seen served should shared whole table  Throw fish dish pretty well covered but leave room bite dessert all excellent  Top end wine list recommend those Rioja section   Recommend bringing some sort coverup ladies quite cold where sat  But didn't diminish incredible dining experience  going cost some cash but most great things life do  <EOR> So head review back n forth between 3 4   give 3 4   restaurant opened 5 arrived around 5 08 wasting time tables downstairs  That wasn't good idea     The place lovely right off elevator   did reservations hostess said she reservation 5 15   Okay so    reservation 7 minutes arrived   said okay decided wait bar course   While walking bar realized 4 people max restaurant area   why did wait ask?

Every dish except complementary bread nothing write home about   always suspicion all food network chefs attempt outdo each other long forgot cooking food people would rather showcase usually random very pricey list ingredients   watched Giada few times feeling she's basically adding extra sugar Pepsi    IE nothing really wrong but she does kills taste any underlying ingredients   Which exactly meal   always thought beauty Italian food freshness taste few very basic ingredients flour salt egg water   then eggplant sweet peppers say oregano   baked pasta vat melted cheese something resembling 1 2 flat pasta few chunks somewhat undercooked eggplant   Really?  Good thing Giada still did discover truffles!  Tuna sandwich just chunks tuna bunch stuff   daughter's pizzette looked good but she said pizza home better right!    chicken fingers son?  wife looked each other    there something misunderstanding here    expression  We read dessert descriptions sounded all expensive sweet ingredients piled together decided pass  In any case Giada never promised cook Italian nobody dragged restaurant   fault choosing incorrectly  But once again wait staff carried day best trained people ever seen  <EOR> Food good EXCEPT dessert hair it   give another GUESS piece also hair inside it   bathroom left puke waste basket   Enjoy dump dessert batch   Hair experience ruined meal although great tasting but hair twice   Nope  <EOR> My fiancé coming since first summer opened  Vegas favorite us  love salumes cheeses appetizers pastas most  great group four more order lot menu  love pea arancini orzo meatballs spaghetti veggie bolognese bucatini  sure order cookie plate lemon ricotta cookies Giada staple  <EOR> Went early lunch today  Lasagna $24 came petite side arugula salad  Lasagna flavor ok bit salty side  pasta non existent texture  soft mushy  Tasted cafeteria food   Orzo meatball $14 flavor but texture meatball blended tofu  soft mushy meatball didn't retain its shape scooping into plate  just fell apart  hard tell photo but meatballs bite sized tapas portions   Each small cherry tomato  Tricolor salad $16 over dressed  veggies soggie   Extremely salty   couldn't veggies because much salad dressing   Free pizza bread fantastic!

This restaurant favorite week  <EOR> I REALLY high hopes Giada but just doesn't compare other celebrity chef top calibre dining options  restaurant itself picture perfect inside stylish new Cromwell  dining room washed white curves towards Las Vegas Boulevard windows open watch Bellagio fountains if you're seated right direction  birthday which Tuesday excited  ascended escalator greeted hostess quickly dampened excitement  reservations but still wait 15 minutes bar which probably good because bartenders actually friendliest people entire restaurant   Almost soon sat down gorgeous cheap restaurant extraordinarily unfriendly server tried upsell some tacky package came autographed picture Giada  eaten number celebrity chef restaurants never experienced similar upsell  felt very tacky kind ruined vibe nice restaurant  isn't Disneyland fine dining restaurant!   In addition cocktails started Charred Octopus delicious  wasn't scrawny very flavorful would highly recommend it  main entree Risotto  risotto came two scallops two asparagus spears woven through it  dish itself delicious but $35 bit pricey portion  also some unmemorable sides  remember bread basket being pretty top notch though  waiter rarely seen when he he wasn't particularly pleasant    As mentioned before birthday while huge birthday person definitely hate people singing public found very odd no even much mentioned when we'd indicated birthday celebration reservation  experience most fine dining restaurants would least say something    don't know maybe off night but doubt back anytime soon  <EOR> Overrated!!! burratta mozzarella app  rice balls sat bar just ok something could anywhere nothing write home about  the Serpico drink delicious!!! Then coffee ice cream cake dessert hard rock hard could killed someone it  the bartender said just wait awhile thaw waited 10 minutes still hard eat   don't waste your $$$   Sorry Gilda <EOR> After several visits clients wife escape yet another bachelor party see Gold Coast Hotel review below some quibbles pointers comments  The delightful risotto crab scallops cream sauce needed more two scallops   I wanted chicken marsala meatballs taste better Costco chicken patty flavor  More marsala sauce mushrooms mix?

I back  <EOR> I don't post very often but place deserves time  Pricey yes BUT service staff food ambiance easily justify money  waiter Gary great he recommended great wine pleasure talk to  Kyle mgr maitre d sure everything done right  cocktail waitress didn't name sorry but she looks Marsha Brady Bunch LOL also did great job   Next time Las Vegas back  great experience  <EOR> What disappointment! I mind spending money good food no matter size serving but place joke  many gourmet restaurants place just insult all them  only food served room temperature which means sitting somewhere because hot felt tasting eating crappy samples  I came celebrate wife's B day called reservation requested table window see Bellagio's fountain show which many people recommend see restaurant told guarantee window table $100 per person minimum drinking requirement otherwise might available  took chance did guaranteed option but anyway found can't see fountain show because view blocked footbridge and don't tell that    We menu server very nice she explained menu when question order glass wine 2 appetizers 2 entrees   point everything good within 5 min ordering appetizers  5 meatballs size jaw breakers 5 bacon warped dates slightly bigger meatball  started eating then wine glass served garlic bread which size biscuit which cold salty   even 10 min entrees LMAO never seen serving small any other restaurant won't even considered appetizer  Believe when tell Lean Cuisine microwavable more food dishes and room temperature well hot   mind spending money good quality food no matter size serving but quality food no better T G I  Friday's  bill looked wife couldn't stop laughing  place more 1 2 hour whole time felt focus getting people quickly  only reason why give place star because waiter only pleasant park experience   Giada hope read because open Yelp account just write review robbing people selling them overpriced below average food  high expectations because but your restaurant worse place ate Las Vegas  <EOR> We ordered tasting menu  OMG!! Amazing! ordered lemon spaghettini husband spicey bucatini     amazing!! veal chop cooked perfection well salmon  Then when dessert cart came     well just call Food Ambulance cuz food coma settling in!!! chocolate sorbet yummy well banana ice cream  server Kevin spot service food narrations!!! He made dining experience extra special! Definitely recommend spot!!! <EOR> Open restaurant may considered saturated market all last count over 30 celebrity chefs restaurants Las Vegas find extremely hard stand apart competition   Giada does right  only reliance celebrity status other name course episodes tv show playing tvs over bar  However she does simply rest laurels food impeccably presented well balanced delicious  found plenty options satisfy vegetarian palate   The recommendations server point drinks bar just right  We glanced drink menus wine lists food menu but end left if bar tender server select dishes disappointed least  Perfect service just right wait time fantastic meals   Giada definitely hit Las Vegas  <EOR> Our dinner very good  glad server Ronald encouraged try Pecorino Tartufo delicious   spaghetti also good but cost now $34 per order even though all menus online say $28 pretty hefty increase already   also charged $15 per appetizer even though some $13 $14   Honestly didnt pay attention when paid would brought attention staff    also didn't scrutinize hand menu pricing changes part fault  Overall Very good food but agree other reviewers cost per portion off even vegas fact spaghetti already increased over 20% troublesome     The hostesses good no issues being seated didn't feel pressured all wait staff   great sommelier named Theresa all all good evening but would encourage restaurant update menu own website well open table if want stop pricing confusion  <EOR> Where start? Where start? bacon wrapped dates may changed entire life cocktails amazing risotto perfection veal game changer lemon ricotta cookies coffee gelato far dessert perfection  Giada honey    honey   you rocked world  <EOR> Father's Day Brunch 2017  Wait 30 minutes without reservation around noon   Ordered Rise Shine Juice $9 Brunch tasting Menu $45 Assorted pastry basket antipasti platter Italian Chicken Waffles cacciatore sauce Limoncello Souffle Creme Anglaise  Wait food longer experienced during dinner hours   Asked server delay she stated having issues kitchen The food Since opening always fan antipasti Giada's platter must try every time esp bacon wrapped dates!   Rise Shine Juice refreshing nice balance between all components not much celery  thankfully   Italian Chicken Waffles utilizes same chicken offered 'Whole Roasted Chicken 2' dinner menu chicken pieces drier Giada's previously but hearty portion comparison some other mains offered  Limoncello souffle portion plenty two  more enough one  great ending satisfying meal   Service Spotty best  servers seemed overwhelmed brunch crowd rarely checked table  despite passing order reach stand  past never issues getting drinks refilled  however time around only received refills if waved them down   Overall 4 star brunch experience minus 1 star lackluster service  probably return dinner   P S  Don't forget swing photobooth to left hostess stand when off escalators <EOR> Decided try Giada friends lunch because couple fans binge watched marathon when sick couple days fell love recipes    restaurant definitely doesn't disappoint!  skeptical first because heard pre launch troubles restaurant having as well some disappointing professional reviews immediately launch but clearly didn't be   First all restaurant itself visually stunning   Wow!  surrounded windows yet very homey feel it   Everything custom restaurant plates napkins etc     Great view strip   I ended ordering arugula ricotta pizza pink peppercorns   Delicious!  Exactly right composition   Cooked perfection each ingredients standing its own without overpowering others   table also shared cheese plate which started off meal perfectly   didn't end getting dessert but probably when back here   Would come back?  Most definitely! <EOR> Honestly great   and given them quite few chances  Honestly food just 'meh' which would okay if weren't already paying high prices everything  Sure view nicer though would even nicer if bit higher up  Nothing ever eaten truly blown minds tried lot dishes  first time ever met did meet Giada herself nice guess selfie  <EOR> Went Giada 6 30 reservation Tuesday during very busy conference week  highly recommend reservation turned away many people walking without reservations    The dining area view fountains see them going off   seated promptly greeted server evening Fred  He phenomenal    Good wine list reasonable options glass section around $14    I opted try tasting menu  bit pricey but well worth it  little bit everything more enough!  started Giadas favorite antipasti  favorite part sweet pepper stuff delicious cheese  followed Giadas signature spaghetti lemony cream sauce shrimp  Next course salmon cooked perfection  served lemon potatoes spicy polenta  much good!    Be sure save room dessert cart  starts some raspberry sorbet cleanse pallet  Small bites desserts you're able try couple different things  opted tiramisu delicious    Definitely worth trip should your list try if haven't gone there! <EOR> Recently dined Giada disappointed food service   evening started bar $17 00 small glass uninspired Pinot Noir $10 00 imported beer husband   party six must say seated quickly rather noisy dining area   service slow pre dinner cocktails took long time coming   ordered antipasta plate which OK but ordinary    however price astronomical! salads good but worst part came when entrees      didn't all arrive same time   Three people party did receive entrees since all raised right all waited 20 min  until appeared begin eating  Naturally cold found pasta lemon spaghetti rather soggy   husband pork ragout which peculiar burnt taste left queasy stomach later evening   crowning touch came bill amount which could fed average family 20 providing ate reasonable restaurant  am Charleston SC originally where very expensive restaurants well  However food service atmosphere eateries usually impeccable  Giada's !

Upon ordering server brought complimentary platter breadsticks rosemary focaccia cheese crisps well several accoutrements   Several antipasti plates then followed which quickly filled table   Few favorites include charred octopus wood roasted mushrooms Prosciutto di Parma   Parmigiano Reggiano also good especially when eaten wild sage honey rosemary focaccia   say skip burrata since texture quite unpleasant instead smooth consistency everyone accustomed to   I opted risotto main entree since sucker creamy pearls rice prepared w tasty seafood broth   Unfortunately served rather disappointing rice underdone seasoning lacking   Although scallops perfectly cooked actually would've never thought dish came crabs if weren't menu listing item its ingredients   While food completely amiss spaghetti other hand easily few highlights night   fact I'd pick over your regular meatball marinara pasta any day   thing caught attention soon dish placed table enormous prawns were   lemon basil sauce also really well pasta   If could eat everyday absolutely would heartbeat!

The lunch really good but good dinner     We app roasted sweet peppers stuffed goat cheese   pretty good starter     Unfortunately did signature lunch dish Lobster Roll   muffaleta lemon grilled cheese sandwich   The muffaleta great flavor but bread hard opinion   Plus tad small   The grilled cheese very tasty   Plus added prosciutto sandwich more savory which really nice     The best dish dessert which tiramisu lady fingers   flavors just exploded mouths definitely elevated lunch another level     Overall nice lunch but nothing special   solid but spectacular  <EOR> I made reservation through hotel only find when arrived Sunday thought booked actually 2 weeks later!  no means fault Giada's rather hotel but when explained hostess happened she very understanding empathetic did best least look quick tasting! I highly motivated visit primarily because 3 daughters 6 year old twins 7 year old gotten hooked Giadas show   avid fan all great places eat Vegas special meaning experience them    While only time enjoy mixed appetizer plate dessert found both exquisitely presented wonderfully enjoyable comfortable atmosphere which certainly captured California casual elegant Italian experience  The bacon wrapped dates incredible all food amazingly tasteful light while certainly satisfying   also tried 4 deserts each wonderful dont think could gone wrong any choices  I would add while Giadas entire experience enjoyable plenty wonderful restaurants happy take your money   truly notable food however people especially Manager Avi   Even busy newly opened place he made personal mission great every guest sincerely wanted insure wonderful experience even though werent really officially entire course   final thank also Avi explained details visit evening he personally insured great story more share daughters   Now really does any more?!

Food mixed batch  sure made better tasting dishes myself off recipes tv shows!! Chicken sucked none 4 us liked but why did waiter even sommelier try push dish?? <EOR> Dimn lighting large windows great view strip adds warm ambiance but loud music being played place  would preferred classical least Italian music vs played which modern pop r b music  motto 'eat little bit everything much anything' which probably explains why portions extremely tiny  ordered salmon which delicious BUT still hungry afterwards  waiter told desserts share able so boyfriend ordered Lemon bunt cake share but surprised see tiny sliver cake ate literally 3 bites and around $13   On top waiter spilled cream for coffee never cleaned broke few glasses while walking around table   It extremely over priced amount receive one cup coffee $6 and refills free   It shame couldn't decide tip horrible waiter charge $61 added bill over $400 tip!  over priced tiny portions horrible service But ambiance view beautiful  <EOR> I would love give place least 4 stars but couple problems hard overlook   I am huge fan Giada's booked restaurant 2 months ago looking forward great meal   hostesses great did honor request window table but half hour reservation time   No biggie because room comfortable view fantastic   waiter very good tried best push tasting menu but already knew wanted   breakdown dishes   1   Lobster Arancini 8  Very good    red sauce best part  2   Shrimp Scampi 8  Marscapone made dish but shrimp seemed lesser quality   Polenta cake perfect  3   Artchoke Soup 10  amazing soup great taste texture  4   Pasta Fagiole 10  partner loved it  5   Lobster Ravioli 10  delicious describe perfect dish  6   Rack Lamb 3  pictures Yelp dish look great but lamb incredibly fatty   waiter said because Colorado lamb felt intimidated send back   Never again only 4 tiny bites whole dish   spinach served delicious though       worst part half hour wait between soup course FAT Lamb course   Way long wait   server did say couple times would right but never apologized wait   lamb dish $45 nothing    want money back!  Overall decent experience but worth $240   bottles wine start $50 range there   should more reasonably priced options especially Italian categories    Italy several times even good wines bargain   trying hype restaurant more casual dining if having dinner someones home   Somewhat pricey home cooked meal     Probably would return dinner but might try lunch sometime if Giada some amazing paninis menu   One more item interest saw tank tops tee shirts tennis shoes shorts midriffs sandals every other type dress here   sure dress code  <EOR> What perfect evening   ordered tasting menu 7 oz filet main course   flavors well blended variety courses built each other expertly left feeling best meals ever   can't begin describe incredible staff especially Joseph took care experience   If want world class meal casual but elegant setting it  <EOR> Everything place amazing!

Dining magnificent! However disappointed pretentious air Giada's  Since decision lunch Giada's completely spontaneous did reservations  arrival although restaurant half empty Hostess refused seat table allowing bar seating only! hostess made very clear without requisite reservation only bar seating allowed  no sense when restaurant only half full obvious enough reservations fill space! food delicious but pretentiousness left bad taste  <EOR> 3 5 stars  When gigantic hydraulic controlled windows swung open letting faint breeze noises strip two floors below real treat sit restaurant's perimeter  Nearing closing time windows slammed shut all ambiance literally window  Something lovely natural elements detracted air con set full blast overly simplistic decor which lacked character  Weather permitting keep them windows open!  The dessert cart rolled several times tempting me  When finally tried all three cookies lemon chocolate chip ricotta PB blackberry jam bite blueberry eclair spoonful dark chocolate amaretti cake disappointed tasted no better run of the mill buffet dessert at triple cost  Two appetizers stood phenomenal bacon wrapped dates sticky plump crostini w ricotta honey lemon pink peppercorns addictive bites sweet savory olive oil drizzle magnificent I assume high quality one    He enjoyed salumi bresaola proscuitto cheese parmesan mozzarella platter  sage honey spicy grain mustard accompaniaments especially delicious    Thumbs rack lamb  chose farroto faro fava beans morels pecorino which extremely salty par other amazing items tried    I'd hard pressed recommend just another celebrity chef getting paid throw name Vegas eatery  <EOR> This favorite restaurants Las Vegas   30 year resident Las Vegas love place    food remarkable    Nancy server tonight BEST!    The quality food experience service always top end!!  Have veal chop saltimbocca lemon cookie desert  <EOR> Like another review said lower your expectations  food absolutely incredible  There's wide variety choices antipasti menu thoroughly enjoyed 5 6 ordered  lemon spaghetti world  regret trying dessert everything looked amazing  knocked off two stars solely service  hostesses cold unwelcoming server clueless  seated 30 minutes original reservation  moment sat down server wanted door  She pushy attempted rush through meal  She also failed refill water glasses clear plates when new dishes came just those small things never really think  until happens  would back again but perhaps try seated bar avoid poor service  <EOR> A new low even Giada   Vegas last weekend friend didn't want miss eating there   She made reservation window table many weeks advance   night before planned dinner she call restaurant asking if planned spend least $100 per person because those premium tables   point would told them stick table but she said yes  So ate there   Magnificent view so so overpriced food   wound spending $90 per person   afraid would add $20 bill   I understand place popular  <EOR> A group Las Vegas few times year always try new top end restaurants each trip   time Giada choice Saturday night    The good The ambiance place great   check in process very efficient sat bar waiting area drinks while waited table we arrived early enjoy drink    table ready right time in fact few minutes early seated smaller room off main dining area which fine all us      The good First let's talk food   ordered lot appetizers group try bunch things   came table very quickly which great   terms quality though none bad but none great   all considered very pedestrian think best word sum meh     Second party five people   all know set number pieces most dishes 4 pieces 6 pieces    Most high end restaurants ask if would extra piece made group everyone try something and answer always yes regardless extra fee    wasn't offered fact place did ask didn't happen   informed standard pizza cut four pieces   politely asked if could cut five pieces   Needless say request wasn't well received sure enough 2 minutes later comes pizza four pieces   don't even think request passed given quickly came nor did server mention anything it    Last party ordered beer he considered warm   bottle reasonably cold but beer itself inside actually quite warm   He asked if could please another brief exchange I don't think really understand why he asking fresh one   Same problem warm inside   took put bucket ice few minutes asked again cold needless say problem wasn't effectively solved and again no apologies inconvenience offers something else      Summary We very high expectations the night before enjoyed great meal different restaurant but unfortunately restaurant didn't deliver   best say food meh service just OK but certainly great   lot other great restaurants Las Vegas think Giada's going really step game if want compete  <EOR> Nothing disappoints more review write  mom girls trip Sin City recently ate way through Vegas  visited some old faves tried some new ones  them  Believe love Giada much next foodie don't take 2 star review lightly   THE GOOD loved decor restaurant  very Giada esque  late lunch very bright lots windows great view  could also see right into kitchen which nice touch  table decor all branded Giada down napkins place mat plates  Definitely everything expected restaurant   THE BAD hate say but food just Food Network chef worthy  actually something could've made home  MUCH deliberation chose fritatta mom ordered carbonara pizza  Even though wanted prosciutto fritatta requested without since whopping $5 extra  surprised yet all upset when meal came topped prosciutto  didn't complain luckily waitress didn't even notice charged if hadn't it  Despite being charged prosciutto bill still outrageously priced got    THE UGLY waitress service awful  seemed promising first but then stopped getting water refills  then waitress came check first time    finished eating  she checked before ate entire meal she may actually noticed kitchen order wrong   We walked away disappointed questioning whether Giada really chef she Food Network claims she is  <EOR> Awesome restaurant great view strip delicious food!

Main course The pepperoni flatbread pretty tasty thick crust ooey cheese   Their popular lobster roll served open face contained huge chunks lobster but lacking tangy zang flavors pop    Dessert trio cookies chocolate chip chocolate fudge lemon   best thing had!! cookies warm super flavorful   I'm hoping restaurant gets bit better because views strip amazing  <EOR> My 2nd visit proved live 1st  Truly unparalleled hospitality each crew member hostesses each staff member walk your table waiter  real Welcome Home Let show Around Feed Best Dishes experience   Among all antipasti platter choices favorite Giada's  Although think might ask sub pesto crostini something else  Among pasta selections Lobster Ravioli still favorite but now also add Bucatini list   For dessert Polenta Cake Strawberry Tart Chocolate Chip cookie worth calories   Tomorrow give new lunch service try        Safe say won't weighing myself week <EOR> My honey saw advertisement taxi cab Giada said open breakfast  Perfect timing looking somewhere eat  two ladies front  immediately asked if reservation  didn't  spur moment  She said could sit bar couple minutes then we'd table  whole restaurant besides bar empty  Two gentlemen behind bar  area didn't take order  other did  Whatevs  ordered Bellini mocha  mocha came G it  girl  time friend joined us  Then noticed people being seated  asked bartender going on  Then hostess walked not us  lady never put name down  sounded she did lot way bartender reacted  Any hoot seated  Awesome view  waiter slow but eventually ordered Strawberry Polenta Waffle Breakfast American and Italian Chicken Waffles Cacciatore sauce  waffle little dry but still good  friend asked over medium eggs  Damn near raw still  She asked waiter new eggs over hard time  She over medium eggs time  meatballs amaz balls  best meal boyfriend's  Italian chicken juicy waffles cooked light crisp all paired well cacciatore sauce  <EOR> So very disappointed  nearly week delicious meals Vegas fell very short  service incredibly slow think 30 mins drink slow 15 silverware could eat food front slow   food also just bland  Nothing write home about  tasting menu only thing remotely memorable pasta course  Unfortunately pasta 2oz tasting course $120 person  Definitely worth visit when many outstanding restaurants strip! <EOR> We dinner here   Didn't reservation but able sit bar area almost immediately   Right away see place all quality   see hand made noodles hanging kitchen well fresh rolls Rosemary focaccia coming oven   started Bucatini which husband both agreed best pasta dish ever had!  just cooked perfectly al dente flavors just incredible!  must order!

Open 24 hours  hostess waiter recommended chicken waffles  Well am big fan don't know why ordered it  Menu big  Service good  Value meh  Food a ok  <EOR> Oh goodness finally great meal Vegas business trip  waffles Nutella side nothing short heavenly  sat bar only everything attractive decor but service superb  Such wonderful happy find trip  All customers sitting bar enjoying other meals well we're all raving over choice dish  just looking them could tell amazing  Presentation beautiful flavor point  Thank much making wonderful last food stop trip  staff A+  <EOR> First all place hard into  Reservations fill quickly   They offer full menu bar which seated first come first served  may able seat last minute   It took two tries work even though alone  first try early dinner just 5pm but managed seat lunch nearly 1pm few days later   I sat bar quickly courteously greeted  bartender server knew menu well able solid recommendations   I spent some time looking through menu  Noticed entire section cheese plates  Ok all in   I ordered burrata cheese appetizer Gorgonzola arugula mushroom pizza entree   So here's only real complaint pizza arrived two minutes cheese  Sure small plates place having them together isn't mortal sin but cheese should its own course IMHO did specifically request start cheese then pizza   Watch your timing guys   In any case burrata because cheese wasn't familiar with  basically mozzarella wrapped around fresh cream cheese  wonderful actually lighter looked which isn't say wasn't heavy  Just bad sounds   Eat toasted Italian bread bring out  needs spread eaten alone which typically cheeses    Then pizza  Neopolitan style dough nice balance between three strong flavored ingredients   Lastly going need some help getting through day nearly 72 hours Vegas ordered coffee   When want test espresso knowledge place ask doppio ristretto  bartender server no idea was  Disappointing but unusual   So asked double short espresso which less pretentious version same thing  He knew was   Someone else pulled shot seems someone specializing espresso machine   good thing place isn't pulling shots all day long   According bartender server Giada herself place least once week  Unfortunately wasn't while there  <EOR> Typically would write detailed review but tired annoyed getting suckered into trying restaurants based raving reviews completely over hyped off mark  Giada two words over priced mediocre    If can't reservations place we tried 6 months before getting in don't feel bad missing nothing!!! <EOR> From start finish experience amazing   staff excellent   menu diverse without being complicated   food delicious   baked pasta lasagna Gnocchi Pomodoro   also sangria white    Loved it   cake ordered fantastic too   thought whole experience worth money loved it  <EOR> Not very good breakfast dinner  lobster mash lemon chicken pesto sandwich sunrise waffle  eggs both over undercooked every dish   The lobster mash very plain  could home  simply chopped Vegegables pieces lobster chunks potato  Probably cost 12 bucks  Don't pay $34 it  very uneventful exciting    The pesto sandwich decent  Nothing special pretty strong lemon flavor    The waffle decent  flavor syrup best part  waffle itself soft but light  necessarily crispy    way would've liked be  <EOR> We've wanting try giada's awhile wife being huge fan tv   positives service great   never waited water food   plenty wait staff making sure didn't need anything but weren't intrusive where interrupted your conversation dinner ever 2 minutes   service efficient    They give option eating dishes family style which seems great idea fits line giada's style philosophy   However feel she would better off having separate menu those interested family style serving food   thought would great idea but some dishes small end served family style 4 people don't think full essence dish just couple bites     The food itself clean fresh but didn't necessarily stand me   enjoyed don't wrong   dish did think cooked well charred octopus  <EOR> If review food Giada would 5 star review fact I'd petitioning Yelp add 6th star because food good  However due absolutely abysmal service received today Lunch Giada getting 2 stars  hope experience outlier heard seen may truth but service ruined would amazing meal probably made won't return any time soon  As said food amazing  Everything came quickly kitchen other bread which little backed but everything plated beautifully tasted amazing  started Orzo Meatballs Prosciutto Dan Danielle start  meatballs great flavor profile cooked perfection  Prosciutto perfect balance meat ham paired nicely warm bread pesto  Entrees Venetian Panino Lasagne both delicious while portions touch small happy them  dessert Zappole which served chocolate sauce G perfect end meal  thus ends glowing part review  Let's discuss Service I reservation made Open Table which great idea because even 12 45 Wednesday line seated  checked seated within minutes very friendly hostess informed seated Christopher H's section he would menus moment  10 minutes later still haven't seen heard Christopher busboy notices seated while brings over some water apologizes delay  flags down server   3 5 minutes later he came over dropped off menus  He introduced himself then 5 minutes explaining menu full detail  would great however he talking very hushed mumble could barely hear every 5th word he said over noise room  He then said give minute decision he'd come back  Another 5 minutes closed menus set them edge table he finally came over took order   He hurried off entered order apps came before bread which fine runner explained bread oven little backed because everything made fresh but came 2 minutes apps delivered  No big deal delicious when arrived   The busby then came cleared app plates brought over some silverware main course  waiter came moments before entrees arrived asked if would some more bread which replied Yes bread great we'll take another    The entrees made way table great busboy came topped off beverages but server nowhere found  No hey how's everything tasting  hey would some fresh cracked pepper nothing  He bending over backwards cater 5 top few tables away couple seated right next but he never  comes over table  finish entrees busboy scoops plates  My aunt wants check dessert menu however waiter nowhere found she gets walks over 2 sections asks different waiter dessert menu  then place dessert order busboy because haven't seen waiter good 20 minutes even though he's table directly next no less 4 times   Dessert delivered waiter brings plates fork dessert course food arrived  immediately ask check 90 minutes longer planned need duck quickly work   He brings check moseys off  I worked industry waited tables past am majority time great tipper however service received White Table Cloth Celebrity Chef Spot worthy usual 20 25%  bill $70 paid $75 waiter took check back wait station   I watched eyes big dish plates he looks right comes back bill table  He asks Did take early   which reply No we're fine  He then says know Giada Gratuity isn't included bill? which say know nothing your service deserved more maybe if actually acknowledged existence would better tip  He just shrugged shoulders walked off  On way busboy once again apologized wait but once again server didn't say word other complain tip   I really enjoyed food beautiful room but service bad probably won't returning anytime soon  <EOR> Good food wine great service nice atmosphere  Giada home run   Portions smaller side based price point but no complaints other that  food flavorful well prepared    even bread plenty flavorful accompaniments choose from  Margherita pizza Fritto Misto apps  would recommend both    Brianna server she excellent attentive friendly  <EOR> The experience started off better anticipated  always put reservations being destination diner but buddy town flight catch  Long story short hostess Kelly well way seat leaving no reso full bar full lounge  server Tim lived expectation Kelly set  Tim knowledgable assertive tentative  Oh BTW food fantastic

fantastic   main course delicious rack lamb   sweet corn spicy sausage favorite side   Finally rolled over dessert cart each select 3 desserts  told take all desserts would pack didn't eat  ate banana gelato polenta cake while didn't think would travel well took other 4 desserts back hotel thoroughly enjoying them breakfast next morning  <EOR> I'm sorry Giada  said before but am your biggest fan most Foodies love your charm class most importantly your cuisine maybe holding pedestal turned much anticipated dining experience into fail    We took most important client Giada really WOW them luckily good outweighed good evening am positive yourself would disappointed several key points   First good  Giada located second floor new very chic Cromwell hotel  Upon entering host staff attentive perfect  Moving into restaurant antipasto bar kitchen well overall ambiance layout restaurant outstanding  could also see Giada's touch tableware glassware selection  view strip fountains Bellagio outstanding  far good   This evening decided order guests family style  Having selected most Giada's signature dishes prior arriving plan uninterrupted meal having every guest distracted extensive creative menu  Upon seating discussed waiter also excellent would ordering appetizers salads pizzette salads well pasta family style main course  outlined selections prior even ordering cocktails wine selections happened next simply inexcusable reason would never return  Before could hardly finish placing cocktail order wine come appetizers all them many even fit table!   no idea could even prepared quickly  waived half them off asked waiter please pace dinner!  least let drink hand before all food arrives   understand importance turning tables new hot spot but terrible start sure   As cuisine bread service excellent creative very nice skillet focaccia cheese crisps breadsticks  started bacon wrapped dates sausage bad anything wrapped bacon?  good but texture bit dense  then Artichoke Arancini which seemed void artichoke nothing special  Next wanted order signature Mortadella pizzette only told would enjoy margarita pizza much better Mortadella pizzette simply Shaved Italian bologna top crust   margarita pizzette only okay way way better   much highly anticipated Giada appetizers   The next course however winner!  signature Tri colore salad dates kale lettuce healthy helping very fine quality prosciutto  Everybody raved salad seemed back course   no pun intended  Next came pasta course ordered another signature dish Giada's Ziti  Although ragu delicious pasta itself hard side Al Dente  Scott Connant would ridden Giada misstep   Finally drooling final main course Giada's highly acclaimed Chicken Cacciatore  plating unique actual ragu delivered plate covered ceramic pots roasted chicken arranged plate around it  Again ragu excellent but very plain looking roasted chicken dry plate completely void any garnish   would probably better idea serve dish traditionally chicken actually covered ragu which might masked dryness chicken     Finally dessert cart came cost desserts took look asked where grown servings were   passed dessert elsewhere finish evening   Giada love but again think if on site would disappointed evening   left feeling Giada's restaurant but simply new restaurant just happened your name it   said give 3 Star rating ambiance class creativity but way better Italian discovered Las Vegas  <EOR> I lunch Giada's restaurant overall am happy but food didn't deliver wow factor price paid name behind it   Marinated olives start fantastic  Light refreshing lemon zest her signature nice touch   For main course split margherita pizzette orecchiette pasta caprese salad  Very small portions which if know anything Giada expected but quality definitely little lacking    The dough sauce pizza great but cheese already hardening when meal brought it'd sitting around bit  pasta tasted very fresh although little tepid expecting  real disappointment however caprese which claimed made buffalo mozzarella  Italian same region Giada buffalo mozzarella bit tang normally little softer very bland dry  Places Obica LA import mozzarella burrata Italy real deal right taste consistency  $19 halved cherry tomatoes no way cheese made buffalo's milk claimed  ended meal zeppole share surprisingly light served nutella which added nice touch   The service meanwhile impeccable quick smooth  Overall decent meal but almost $100 food should amazing  Very beautifully prepared lovely setting but expected perfect Italian quality taste didn't feel delivered  <EOR> Our last brunch Vegas Giada's Cromwell  restaurant beautiful elegant  When walked first thing noticed aroma  smell smokey wood burning but very good way  kind reminded Italy  staff very professional attire point! drinks OK I white sangria but really enjoyed food  arugula salad chicken thought tasted perfection  portions great service impeccable food solid  would definitely come back again  <EOR> There LOT gushing going new place  luckily snagged reservation 4 weeks advance but quick search shows restaurant sold until August unless want really inconvenient times   Front house little awkward  few minutes early told running schedule but we'd wait until reservation time  No biggie thought  then watched 4 5 couples walk seated before us  Again no biggie  15 minutes scheduled time hostess asks if we'd sit lounge while wait table  Now getting annoyed  happened running time? Luckily didn't sit long seated 10 minutes lounge   I watched offered tour place guests before sat down  offered tour? let take wild guess  NOPE ask yes did receive tour   The space itself gorgeous great view strip  classic traditional look big beautiful windows overlooking Strip  loved wood staircase going restaurant  Servers white jackets plating done tableside  pretty elegant kind homely feel   I guess if you're gonna run episodes Everyday Italian Giada Home endless loop flatscreens above bar better Giada's place  mean why hell wouldn't she that? ate able watch easy to make peas prosciutto dish  food education!  The menu phonetic pronunciations all pastas  case you're idiot they're right you  Thanks Giada   Also self portraits all over walls  endearing South Park portraits however   Our dishes excellent   Bread service great butter thought spreading actually mascarpone cheese   scallop crab risotto favorite dish meal   Bacon wrapped dates spicy sausage gorgonzola crema also big hit  cocktail program well thought executed   Giada stopped chatted took pic finished meal  Very nice lady nice see buzzing around place  tourists come droves   So food good decor ambience even better but something just off few things  still think surprisingly good experience  much thought would dislike enjoyed meal despite few hiccups   food quite noteworthy   Giada definitely off good start  <EOR> We lunch  started off shaky  reservation 25 minutes early but said couldn't seat until time left came back time  still wait ten minutes reservation before sat  seating waited 10 more minutes no came by  No drinks no menus nothing  starting off good start  However made it  food phenomenal!! Gorgonzola  mushroom anti pastas amazing  sausage pizza good  dessert which house wait world  Calling cookie plate did justice  two each lemon ricotta chocolate chip favorite chocolate peanut butter blackberry jam  <EOR> Very disappointing! husband ate 8 00 p m  Sunday Dec  10th  First all ask bread  When did arrive waiter did explain anything selection items bread board  told any chef's specials if any  wanted butternut squash soup  it  oysters rockefeller extraordinary! Unfortunately only great thing  meal  veal saltimbucca just barely lukewarm cheese ooey gooey should dry  way much breading taste did care red sauce came side  much better saltimbucca Bootleggar didn't cost $57 either  service so so  did keep water glasses filled  place very over priced underwhelming  would back  first time dined just opened wonderful! service food superb  sadly case time around  also remember them asking rate review them dinner last visit  did time  also remember manager coming around tables greet everyone check them last visit  also did happen time around  When factor $14 pay parking even locals truly disappointing experience  <EOR> If looking restaurant crowded serves  $18 glasses house wine dark empty hotel place you   restaurant HUGE disappointment  am big Giada TV fan very excited go     start Cromwell hotel dark very empty even 8pm Friday night    hostess reminded typical LA hostess barely looks eye very friendly certainly customer service oriented      menu very disappointing start ordered soup   Pasta Fagiolo took order came back said sorry no soup left  Shouldnt known when ordered? When continued order main course asked few substitutions actually pretty humorous answer No No No   saying no before could even ask question!   kept explaining certain items pre made  WHAT?    made very clear substitutions welcome    didn't find any menu choices very appetizing ironic because walked $250 00   food comp   ordered  mini Pizza can goat cheese ? NO don't crumbles  But Goat Cheese menu NO  The Pizza reminder Lean Cuisine Pizza exact size    Overall all fantastic restaurants Las Vegas would pass this  Absolutely nothing expected service food quality  We left  French  restaurant received fantastic service enjoyed amazing food wondered why didn't beginning  <EOR> I'm giving review based seating arrangement efforts provide more enjoyable experience  It birthday kept asking bf take bday  liked food service waiter great  seating arrangement couldn't worse whole other section could sat in  big noticing huge elephant room screaming barely squeeze chair bf move table let use rest room Im 110 pounds but decent table birthday? literally no room chairs back wall bf chair chair very unpleasant  Why moved beyond comprehension? food waiter sucked table fact obviously didn't fit space when sat down  should never sat first place  should complained but just tried best it  huge fan Giada glad place but dine often  please staff notice people over look try some common sense  team work Tetris  <EOR> Service Impeccable  solid 5 stars  waitress friendly attentive thoroughly knowledgeable menu   Ambiance First class tastefully done  party five seated semi circular table overlooking strip Bellagio fountains truly spectacular view night   The menu many appetizer choices but honestly nothing menu standout  Meatballs tasty but small portions  Burrata salty offered tiny sample  Gorgonzola honey maybe three bites worth  Fritto calamari overly browned 5 6 pieces  risotto charred scallops delightful but main course could eaten 2 3 more servings  other dinner guests seemed enjoy veal lamb fish pasta dishes but didn't hear anyone raving meals   Overall very mediocre meal overpriced skimpy  home un fulfilled hungry breakfast next day  Nice date place impress but satisfy your hunger  Also disappointed Giada couldn't see her  hurry come back  <EOR> What say Giada's new restaurant kind  interior very open adorned light earthy tones  Staff very knowledgable friendly service exceptional  food simply amazing must try's include chicken t bone sea food  All pasta freshly made amazing tried several dishes all cooked perfectly  <EOR> We came brunch Super Bowl Sunday  beautiful day seated directly corner strip view Bellagio water show   felt truly vacation   drinks mocktails cocktails delicious   enjoyed sweet potato pasta pizza   leave room build your own brownie cart!  photo booth great touch   Our reservation hour before closed lunch   felt slightly rushed waiter setting tables dinner maybe attentive recvd wrong meatballs ordered recvd cappuccino finished dessert completely forgot lemon ricotta cookies inquired about   Most corrected but just minor downfall experience   still would recommend overall experience great  <EOR> My boyfriend extremely excited try Giada however would say most negative dining experiences very long time  service absolutely horrendous server would disappear long periods time would ask several people us  food came before even received bottle wine  finally ask manager once almost done meal why STILL hadn't even gotten it  also ordered calamari appetizer extremely fishy fresh all point already having negative experience   Overall would never back any future trips already told family members going few weeks avoid restaurant! <EOR> Finally Chef Giada opened first restaurant center Las Vegas strip!

He soon become terrific server without doubt   He far more knowledgable personable female bartender  sure!  overall atmosphere bit confusing me   trying club?  music distracting me   decor *not* would expected seeing Giada's TV set truly hated seeing name initial everywhere   liked white white napkins name liked name To Go bags but did care all back bar stools some dishes plates    Now food    10 Stars that!  started grilled octopus which indescribable!  order again again again   also gorgonzola dolce which terrific   entrees lobster ravioli ate every single last bite   pasta delicate lobster plentiful   husband veal saltimbocca   He ate all but said he wouldn't order again pan fried   dessert variety cookies lemon ricotta world but also honey almond chocolate ganache tart   O   M   G   !!!  wanted house it   delicious perfect balance creamy crunchy   would Giada's again just dessert order tart    Food = world   Servers = amazing  Bartender = 1 great 1 Atmosphere = tried different your traditional Italian fine dining but became eclectic me  <EOR> The first time felt Giada's AMAZING! cute Pinterest y modern decor attentive waiters busers lovely cocktails yummy lemon butter capers sea salt peppers accompany bread  portions entrees small expensive but good  very satisfied   However upon second visit VERY disappointed  staff helpful ever but food terrible! chicken soup tasted came can  lobster ravioli tasted bland sauce despite being lovely couldn't help Alfredo sauce spaghetti tasted came jar  happened?!

Make sure check in Yelp during your dining experience fun free treat! option choosing between glass Prosecco each assortment cookies  took Prosecco started meal off right!   The cheese board seriously delicious homemade honey jams accompany  also ordered fritto misto share before entrees  included fried shrimp calamari  perfect appetizer!   I also ordered lobster ravioli would highly recommend!  We also enjoyed drinks dessert but would warn drinks very strong not complaint just heads  also pre fixe option $120 per person but entire table select option  includes autographed photo Giada access dessert cart  observations dessert cart offered few additional sweet treats listed menu but suggestion would nix pre fixe option order multiple shared plates table  way experience truly customized your group same price less try bunch items very fun way!   At end meal while waiting seated sure take some selfies photo booth!   Overall can't say enough good things restaurant  Honestly only thing could made experience better would meeting Giada herself  Maybe next trip back!  I would also suggest making reservations ahead time because restaurant does very busy  sure request window seat enjoy perfect view Bellagio fountain!   Happy eating!  Samantha Giacobbe <EOR> I thought going better expected unfortunately wasn't  food ok expecting more restaurant just because she's know Italian queen food  photo booth fun cool  staff really nice just wish food little better just lacked flavor especially price  <EOR> The dining room looks great!  over looking Las Vegas Blvd great view Bellagio Caesars palace no matter time day place bright airy   Service good too   ordered 3 different dishes  carbonara pizza lobster roll muffuletta mortadella sandwich rigatoni kids menu  best opinion pizza then lobster roll then rigatoni last muffuletta mortadella finocchiona sandwich   I'd definitely came back try dinner menu  <EOR> Grazie mille Joseph getting lickety split barely making flight home but really wanted try restaurant   pretty good   G cocktail phenomenal   Some seasoning wasn't taste cauliflower soup but ricotta crostini lemon potatoes wonderful   Excellent service too! <EOR> It second visit Giada   While little frosty bar first warmed then Lauren Gary Ponce Chloe AMAZING hosts dining room!

You're still pretty  <EOR> Giadas used favorite place eat while visiting Las Vegas ' But notice said used !  favorite dish carbonara pizza freshly made pizza dough fired brick oven pizza cheese prosciutto couple easy over eggs top  When crack eggs warm yolk drizzles over  pizza  During last visit Vegas called Giadas asked reservation told all full  But because am such big fan Giada especially carbonara pizza convinced  group wait something open up  arrived exactly noon only three tables three four people each table  bar didn't single person! Something definitely wrong picture!  We seated promptly very courteous pleasant hostess  Our server  very polished all she came table two times most  When favorite carbonara pizzas arrived immediately noticed something wrong  The eggs way over cooked texture hard boiled eggs! told servers he could manager he apologized instead re firing pizzas he brought back over easy eggs switch them! letdown!  Upon leaving told server pizza par answer maybe many pizzas ordered same time! group ordered total four pizzas only nine other people entire restaurant  REALLY?? When returned home wrote Giada no response  I wrote good intentions because sure she would know what's going restaurant but guess wrong  Las Vegas thousands eating places don't think Giadas around long  PS meatballs tasted mush!

I loved décor restaurant  much bigger expected huge open floor plan large windows offering nice view strip   We ordered Sunrise Polenta Waffle Italian Chicken Waffle we sure love waffles! waffles delicious but without maple syrup béchamel sauce Sunrise Polenta Waffle lacking flavor  it would've helped if more just tiny bits pancetta  eggs perfectly cooked fried chicken delicious  crispy skin tender meat    Service great  hostess friendly waiter attentive  able free glass prosecco Yelp check in! also took advantage photobooth   The price dishes weren't cheap but still enjoyed food thought portions pretty big  really stuffed ended having box large piece chicken along half waffle  tons spots Vegas yet try but wouldn't mind coming back again try other dishes brunch  <EOR> While husband huge Giada fans overly impressed restaurant  chicken Marsala meatballs delicious but muffaletta disappointing  bad but wonderful   still hungry ordered spinach buffalo pizza   love buffalo mozzarella but relatively bland needs other flavors pop  didn't work  couldn't taste garlic spread very little spinach  waiter nice young man but didn't seem good grasp menu wine didn't arrive until meal almost finished  won't repeat customers  just many great restaurants Vegas settle anything less best  <EOR> OMG restaurant beautiful! Just entrance itself feels grand inside spacious chic modern  Every last detail fancy luxe down personalized toilet paper bathrooms! there's wraparound views strip  Now Vegas restaurant  Great job Giada! didn't expect anything less    The food delicious but warned portion sizes small  Just look Giada  don't look eating much  There's even quote written all around restaurant eat little everything but don't eat lot anything   If need more food sister did share few plates    The meal starts off complimentary bread plate  So Freaking Cute  said every single detail place impeccable  bread comes wooden board several little serving dishes lemon butter capers salt most delicious olive oil vinegar  bread little ramekin focaccia my fave! breadsticks Parmesan crisps  entire spread really only feeds 2 1 per every 4 people but said servings small  ask more  way know just dedicated entire paragraph bread but good more deserves it    As far food some really delicious dishes others left much desired  Standout favorites include rigatoni veggie bolognese surf turf salmon artichoke arancini    Things suggest skipping Brussel sprout crostini lemon soufflé    Service fantastic  Very attentive friendly    Overall if you're Giada fan great dining  Disclaimer huge Giada fan review may may bit biased  probably 3 5 stars but yelp doesn't let half stars 4 is! <EOR> We breakfast lunch really fantastic  wish some more options but realize started dinner place first  ambience wonderful clean modern decor  waitress super sweet offered some great recommendations   husband ordered alcoholic beverage he said very refreshing meal was  He ordered American breakfast array jams spreads toast  grilled chicken Caesar  lemon Caesar vinaigrette die for! really need Giada sale lol  All all great experience back maybe dinner next time  <EOR> Local review may biased because course find better priced meals anywhere off strip but birthday decided venture out  choice having pre chosen courses $120 person just decide own  decided choose own came exactly same price per person  We had Lemon Crab Arancini $19 Okay but sort fell apart Pea Pesto Crostini $15 good Arugula Salad $15 supposed come candied lemon whatever is crispy pancetta  maybe 3 pieces pancetta  basically plate argula olive oil balsamic vinegar $15  Definitely expected  Caprese Salad $19 mozzarella very good fresh Risotto $32 good very creamy light fluffy Ravioli $36 ok Surf Turf $56 when remember Italian took college  plural ends when saw raviolo instead ravioli thought strange only 1 raviolo   really Giada? your turf poorly cooked piece meat sure check send back if your medium rare comes medium well done  your surf 1 raviolo stuffed crab  very disappointing $56 dollars!! Salmon $39 okay slightly raw but I'd rather slightly raw salmon versus dry over cooked salmon  But here's kicker placed ontop lima beans corn  Pretty sure lima beans corn came freezer section local grocer    I disappointed  Again maybe because local could eat elsewhere even own kitchen whole lot cheaper probably same if better prepared cooked food  But experience    experience probably won't again but experience nonetheless okay that  <EOR> Dropped little joint lunch yesterday   restaurant open six weeks but only serving lunch since last Wednesday   manager told reservations pretty much required dinner but lunch easier drop eat   guessing because people sleeping off prior night's festivities     First off staff very friendly attentive   tables windows great view strip   nice lounge area between tables bar     The lunch menu smaller dinner menu serving antipasti salads pizzas sandwiches   Oh yeah desert too  Started off glass red win Sangria   Very tasty but little expensive side   First arrive very good bread served equally tasty pesto   I Wood Roasted Mushrooms antipasti   oyster mushrooms toasted Marcona almonds ricotta salata   Very good antipasti   really Marcona Almonds because buttery but felt flavor little lost dish   Next Carbonara pizza   Basically gourmet Italian breakfast pizza   topped two fried eggs prosciutto I think Prosciutto San Daniele black pepper   dough very thick prosciutto flavorful without being salty yolk running off sides added flavor   Overall excellent dish!

Wanted visit place since opened reading reviews just making more more interested going  Sat bar since just dining myself hostesses nice welcoming even offered small tour restaurant  Eric bartender took care owned bar! He making great suggestions all customers  started cocktail Destroyer good but 18 dollars refrained getting second one  meal decided two antipasti pasta dish  Great choice! started Vitello Tonato crustini antipasto fancier version rustic original Italian version but all flavored there! Delizioso! Second came Bacon Wrapped Dates good but still overwhelmed crustini before  Eric offered small splash Nero D'Avola pair dates enjoy them better made huge difference  Before entree Oro di Milano beer nice full bodied beer around 8 5 abv  Finally dish blew mind came Lobster Ravioli!! Wow speechless when took first bite  Everything plate balanced perfectly could back tomorrow eat same thing again!!  Overall great experience! Would definitely recommend come back more!! <EOR> The service great but food very basic  bake pasta Margarita pizza  Based price point reputation expected more <EOR> Impressed more Indifferent Let start off saying am big fan Giada  I've watched Food Network over 7 years bought cooking books watched empire grow  excited try restaurant    The service excellent!   The food delicious but extremely rich  sister mother sick   Maybe if only take bite Giada eats then maybe won't sick    The Meat Cheese Board die for! must start    The Shrimp incredible famous dishes Spaghetti Shrimp Lemon Basil   However sauce way much buttery creamy cheesy  ever happened little olive oil lemon? way rich took away flavor shrimp  Sometimes simpler better     Do Rigatoni Vegetable Bolognese think dish ultimately sister sick  took bite whatever   The Cookies Spectacular   Maybe expectations high  <EOR> My husband Giada's past weekend when visiting Vegas anniversary  very nice upscale dinner  food delicious well drinks  If want view Bellagio fountains should request your reservation only few seats view  <EOR> Very Disappointed!!   We Giada's wife's 49th Birthday while Vegas   wife both looking forward having dinner surprised high prices   expected since eating place owned famous Chef'    The restaurant elegant pretty decent view strip However very surprised poor quality dinner   Seriously Disappointed!!      Our filets lobster ravioli seriously short expectations   While expected small sized portion which typical finer dining you know less more flavor did it   Both filets burned side topped small ravioli   Yes  correct ravioli   ravioli very dry hard around edges where use knife cut it   would think $56 dollars ala carte would expect perfect!  just could figure   The only way ruin filet over cooking it    They did   Service okay say just okay because waitress having trouble other wait staff  little disagreement over using each others menus   service staff need lot more training seems   small table two quickly became over crowded  dish extra dish piled raised place mat bread dish glasses little room anything else   Hence once bread tray arrived didn't easily fit table   picture looked when bus boy didn't remove empty dishes forced start stacking dishes table ask them removed      They did bring wife very tiny dessert sparkling wine because birthday   However think more complained manager told should told waitress sooner     The interesting thing bill included Iphone take survey service received   questions Did manager visit during your meal? Since he didn't show until received bill completed survey said no  Funny advised poor quality food manager asked if already completed survey   irony he never offered any way poor experience   opinion because already filled survey   So settling $200 bill agreed wouldn't returning Giada's next trip Vegas   Especially since Vegas plenty great restaurants choose during four six visits year  <EOR> I'm love Giada's   but review truly reflects 2 5 food very good     There many things just took enjoying experience fully  arrived 715 Wednesday night wasn't terribly busy but wasn't empty any means  locals ae familiar convention schedules whatnot chose quieter night    My date nice array items  started 'Spicy Italian Sausage Arancini' served parmesan fonduta pomodoro sauce  well enjoyed 'Fregolotto' fre go LO toh roasted rainbow cauliflower garlic purée parmigiano kale pesto crispy prosciutto  shared them both appetizers both great  Rich delicious flavors good portions everything very shareable  pasta split kitchen well which greatky appreciated  Bread offering also good but saved room dinner didn't really much it   though delicious    For mains shared 'Surf Turf' 7oz filet two large prawns port wine sauce creamy gorgonzola gnocchi baby carrots 'Barolo Braised Australian Wagyu Beef Short Rib' served soft polenta garden vegetables    I ordered filet medium rare perfectly cooked better steaks recently  Creamy Gorgonzola Gnocchi also delicious  Again nicely portioned really perfect texture cooking filet  Just good  Short Rib wasn't favorite  Although really short rib really polenta  flavor profile fell short personally   wine component great mind but maybe just didn't translate well palate having things rich gnocchi port wine sauce ont he steak  polenta also came across little unseasoned   but again maybe me  date didn't care pretty much uneaten    We couple cocktails some California red blend wine   everything good  No question when food being cleared why didn't eat short rib but wern't looking any other food wasn't huge deal  would appreciated if asked though    Now couple thigs want mention interest constructive criticism    Mainly server blatently intent upselling everything   which part job realize but bit rushed short quality service  staying table terms presence constatnly looking elsewhere while asking questions looking suggestions based wanted manuever menu nicely without over doing but still getting few items try  Every request guidence met short curt responses  Pointing menu seemingly going priciest options answer everything  money wasn't problem knew geting into   but would liked bit more personalized service based cocktails wine   just hurried  may asking much  fully aware other tables he being sat wasn't intending take time but felt rushed just didn't care that    Another thing backwaiter server assistant really big distraction   honestly don't mean rude   but when trying nice quality meal sound silver being loudly set onto tables clanging together while being polished then tossed into drawer sideboard some sort cool  Also frequently asked if would water botlle refills forgotten   then asked again forgotten  biggest deal but made feel turn burn situation  didn't all    On top 'back house' conversations opinions other guests backwaiter servers just inappropriate  Finger pointing crude remarks clearly meant offensive  guests being spoken may hear but heard every word  something may even noticed able stay int moment just enjoy myself   but silver clanging hearing noticing everything else going on    So overall food 5 stars   but service 2 5 stars  I'd again maybe sit bar   quality food it    Well   Happy Eating You!

Nope finished eating it  natural light everything tasted helped come alive  recipes subtle cool refreshing almost rejuvenating while never felt any thing amazing just all worked    For appetizers tried caponata $8 baby sweet peppers $12 orzo meatballs $15  Interestingly enough cheaper better here  caponata excellent came enough cover 10 crostini it came 6 asked extra  baby sweet peppers stuffed goat cheese olive tapenade came three fit theme review perfectly  not amazing but somehow still perfect  orzo meatballs probably least favorite everything tried paying 3 4 dollars per meatball relatively small un compelling dish something would advise coming guy falls aidells samples Costco regular    For lunch Waldorf Panzanella salad which included unique crouton like raisin walnut bread really enjoyed  also split three other options Lobster Roll Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese w prosciutto Tuna sandwich  Getting back idea refreshing lobster roll served cold included lemon basil aioli which along lemon pesto grilled cheese contributed overall feeling zest felt completion meal  three grilled cheese favorite followed lobster roll then tuna    Try Diet Final Word  If soup taste 10x's better rainy day and or there's nothing better ice cold beer mowing your lawn place lunch  good food served right atmosphere right time  Try it  <EOR> Maybe high expectations but just OK   ambiance pretty generic feels more airport chic vegas eatery  Also more casual expected would maaaaaybe try again lunch but fun weekend dinner   The tricolore salad tortellini mint peas both good   The spaghetti lemon shrimp super heavy gummy send back    Nice antipasti selection  <EOR> Giada's nicest views around  lunch time nice table next windows  could see Eiffel Towel Paris fountains Bellagio  interior modern warm classy touch  clean staff very helpful  breakfast lunch meals all same menu   For lunchtime pretty quiet  only server saw Billy fantastic server he moved quickly between tables  started white sangria  glad wife split it  only delicious packed little punch    I Giada burger egg bacon added  onions overpowered other flavors burger again without those  provolone flavorful beef blend spot on  burger bacon egg cooked perfectly  could bite cleanly through them without pulling toppings off burger    My wife Arugula Salad shrimp  aware if add shrimp $11 upcharge 2 shrimp  decent sized but worth $11    I back having good lunch experience I'd try dinner out  Give Giada's try think you'll happy did  <EOR> Orzo meatballs die for! Oh goodness  Food absolutely phenomenal  Thanks again! <EOR> I don't cook but enjoy watching cooking shows includes all 126 them which Giada works magic kitchen hosts acts judge  without saying could wait meal very first restaurant which just happens favorite cities  Giada opened last spring when husband visited Vegas few months later last June booked solid  tried again recent trip Vegas December  first attempt dinner no openings entire night  then decided give another shot lunch only ten minute wait    score! Lunch seems way go    The restaurant itself very Giada every way  California cool vibe but classy way  When first walk see display case all fresh foods ingredients before walking past open kitchen  large panoramic windows offer stunning view strip every direction   The lunch menu seems bit limited    several cheese meat veggie antipasto plates handful pastas flatbread pizzas sandwiches  hoping try lemon spaghetti but unfortunately served dinner only  sever informed bread only brought table if antipasto ordered  started parmigiano reggiano served bit honey actually still piece honeycomb  good but mess eat since crumble hard cheese yourself using fork  husband covered cheese time finished preparing it    good thing parmigiano color  bread four very small pieces flatbread come pesto dipping sauce  actually preferred pesto cheese honey  found ridiculous force customers buy overpriced antipasto plate just receive few bites bread   For entrees ordered lemon pesto grilled cheese husband lasagna upon recommendation server described traditional meat cheese lasagna  sandwich very tasty    grown version grilled cheese  husband's lasagna traditional version he expecting being more diced eggplant mixed rather meat but he enjoyed nonetheless  Both entrees came choice arugula salad light olive oil dressing crispy zucchini strings  zucchini strings very light flavorful   Service slow but told system down causing backup  server friendly though glasses iced tea stayed full  no rush simply enjoyed down time   Now finally tried Giada's restaurant feel check off bucket list but wouldn't huge hurry return  good? Absolutely  However overpriced smaller portions served think few other true traditional Italian restaurants I'd rather visit when town instead version described Italian California twist  <EOR> We loved decor restaurant  open airy lots space tables  also loved outfits servers classy cute  hostesses very accommodating using breakfast voucher bought Gilt around 1pm afternoon  For upscale restaurant however service pretty slow  took long time water menus which detracted experience   I ordered salmon cake Benedict which came 2 salmon cakes 2 poached eggs toasted sourdough bed sautéed spinach side hollandaise sauce  though dish quite well done salmon cakes flavorful eggs poached nicely  However since normally costs 21 dollars expecting little more both service flavors  good but amazing   My friend ordered polenta bacon bits  She said ok but amazing well  Maybe ordered wrong things polenta waffles looked really delicious    We also ordered two glasses freshly squeezed grapefruit juice  really enjoyed glass but friend found bitter sour   Overall worth 44 dollar voucher but would hesitate again pay full price  <EOR> I Giada's Saturday night friend thought good   We ordered artichoke hummus inside which probably least favorite thing ordered    For main course split salmon spaghetti prawns thought both extremely delicious portions good size absolutely made full   The downfall waiter he little bit awkward asking many times if wanted drink which finally told 3rd time drinking right now   The atmosphere really nice right next Drais which nice because  where going after    Overall thought main course really delicious would eat again  <EOR> I really wanted give 5 stars  meal amazing Turkey Panini   But service wasn't great forgot soup wife's lasagne bit better average  Also really apparent if somebody probably won't service deserve  $18 sandwich $24 lunch lasagne should better   I feel bad Giada because food restaurant amazing!! <EOR> I loved Giada   wife surprised dinner reservations birthday latest Vegas trip   watched Giada's cooking show quite few years excited when she opened restaurant   reservation immediately seated although seemed very busy inside   group 5 all ordered something different able try few different dishes   given option tasting menu served family style $120 did opt all parties your table partake   understand minimum 2 people

Grey Goose tonic husband ordered Cosmo  cosmo 19$  know Vegas but good god  other places strip prices high drinks    Overall good but few tweaks could amazing  <EOR> I mixed reviews restaurant   think such high expectations realistically never going met   restaurant itself beautiful very trendy just overall beautiful restaurant    service superb   staff top everything water plate removal provide excellent service superior many other restaurants         food good however portions smaller expected   ordered mushrooms very flavorful prepared perfection   also ordered shrimp scallop risotto little bland taste          your classic fine dining restaurant isn't place filling comfort food   long keep mind good experience  <EOR> We celebrate Valentine's Day very beginning wasn't good  hostess snake tattoo rude arrogant  bar wait bartender actually best part entire dining experience  He very friendly knowledgeable  When same rude hostess talked when arrived came take table she saw fiance's purse handle looks brass knuckles she said fiancé Good idea never know days just ear shot me  table where very rude French server talked down much possible  ordered calamari crab appetizers couldn't believe salty calamari was  could barely eat did eat  ordered salmon he said should try red snapper if didn't could salmon instead  When he finally came hard over cooked just salty calamari   He came told didn't he sighed took away brought salmon  also hard top but rest edible  deserts weren't any better when rude waiter asked if wanted coffee espresso said no he just turned nose walked away  NEVER again highly encourage all same  <EOR> Some girlfriends Giada food absolutely amazing  ordered spaghetti chicken Marsala meatballs artichoke  drinks delicious well   Please note 3 stars all due food itself but rather service  found ourselves waiting quite long order rarely checked during meal  Towards end dinner girl friends water glass cracked when being refilled gushed everywhere water came down side table wetting few us  manager nice comp spaghetti but all affected table result glass cracking  would visit again but hope better overall experience  <EOR> This new place indeed A OK  With no reservation decided check Giada lounge which limited menu   told first come first serve starting 5   just 5 30 greeted woman base escalator   She took name said would 20 minutes    okay except isn't stick furniture space into casino stand around unwelcome party crasher   20 minutes she said would another 10 she said clocked 5 42 then 5 58  said Iphone arrived 5 35  felt ridiculous quibble minutes let go   short time later she sent upstairs where most lounge tables reserved signs   much first come first serve  Now good news         The room gorgeous    staff attentive   Eric bar wonderful informative solicitous    They brought wonderful bread service which wanted devour but held back leave room other things  We ordered antipasti platters artichokes caponata olives   Liked all    We ordered vitello tonnato   tasty enough bite vitello tonnato   slice veal topped slice seared tuna crostini   Couldn't taste schmear sauce  Eric explained everything Giadafied    Okay  But don't call something not  just watched episode Food Network Star where Giada warned woman call something Serrano ham if isn't   call dish something else   shared view Eric he brought another dish try   Anchovy crostini   wouldn't ordered myself but wonderful!! deconstructed Caesar salad  We also arrancini dessert cookies   Both OK but unexceptional   wish offered pasta bar  would liked try one  I certainly back but hope sort very unpleasant greeting   nice way start evening  <EOR> My parents moved United States Rome 1985 very much looking forward eating Giada's new restaurant Las Vegas    I enjoyed everything ate however several textural issues salt issues plates    I began lunch Burrata appetizer  Burrata burro Italian word butter extremely creamy cheese pulled apart fork often spread bread  Burrata excellent drizzled olive oil served line salt plate  Unfortunately Giada's house bread akin pita bread consists pizza dough undercooked served small ramekin pesto which almost inedibly salty  Burrata really needs spread hearty crunchy bread otherwise every bite devoid any texture but mushiness    My second appetizer consisted baby peppers stuffed goat cheese  delicious sweet creamy    For entree infamous $35 lobster roll  Again plate suffered salt textural issues  lobster roll consisted thick piece Italian bread heaping pile lobster centric filling top  tasted NO salt filling however  easy fix always add salt  addition some salt delicious  filling mostly large lumps succulent lobster capers celery bits absolutely delicious  Unfortunately dish roll eaten utensils would even qualify open faced sandwich significantly more filling bread  real problem though Italian bread bottom soggy because matter seconds absorbed moisture lobster filling  Once agin during meal taking spongy bites time soggy bread lobster filling    In conclusion issues minor  However NO alcohol lunch cost around $80 tip  amount money think crisp bread much ask for  would definitely return again lunch though  <EOR> I've always fan Giada's   She's favorite Food Network celebrity chefs   met twice own Giada autographed cookbooks   She's also UCLA Bruin which pretty cool   When found I'd town family event booked reservation Giada free night via Open Table   adjust reservation slightly when booked show same evening which wasn't problem   arrived Cromwell valet asked if dining Giada which

Also point while wait your table front lobby there's photo booth machine take pictures  But down side photo printer broken!   Overall disappointing experience Giada's! Horrible rule $100 00 spend per person sit window seat telling your patrons until day before dinner reservations  Losing order ticket making wait 40 minutes dinner  Giada need take notice such poor practices your restaurant changes  plenty other fine dining establishments Vegas people spend hard earned money instead here!!! <EOR> I don't know idea family style portions but portions fairly large share least 2 people  serious when say ordered family style meatballs Giada's new restaurant Las Vegas all dinky sized portion  family sized portion! say pizzas good but once again small size  bread freshly made which huge difference  Would eat again?

Overall just ok ambience layout restaurant very nice just don't think price quality worth come frequently but try again  <EOR> We made reservations but wait 40 minutes despite arriving time   lack contact follow staff    After seated waited again until last very competent waiter arrived  The iPad Menu given dirty only 5% power displaying charge needed message   also confusing wondered entire menu?  this?  order directly thru iPad?   No more pricey appetizers drinks menu   Later given real menus wine list   OK!  Now know do!   Time by    at last order also order wine  We no show attend afterward weren't hurry   Good thing  Before appetizer arrived finally received bread tray   wondering      Why flavored salt included when clearly everything tray already salty except pesto?  mean really salty  Oh well  The single freshly baked rosemary roll delicious split it   very salty lavosh sp? grissini also nice  Our appetizer salads entrees outstanding except Rigolotto which dull   why returned brought new guest!  shared tastes then enjoyed dessert coffee  Yes probably return but bear mind squeaky wheel may attention here  <EOR> Saw Giada  Aunts birthday she her  Giada said she'd back say hello  1 hour later   NO GIADA  restaurant seem she's full herself don't appreciate that  better Italian food  However great girls night <EOR> I am bit torn between 2 3 stars Giada ok but definitely much better even better pricing other restaurants same caliber   We wife's birthday arrived 5 minutes early but seated 15 minutes reservations which totally ok gave window seat great view Bellagio fountains   We typically eat several small meals throughout day thus if share several plates versus ordering individually  Surprisingly 4 courses came sound $168 left hungry due small portion sizes  expected higher price point but would more acceptable if left satisfied   We ordered Giada's Caprese perfect combination heirloom cherry tomatoes mozzarella! Mortadella savory top moist bread even better little pesto bread tray! Surf Turf crab raviolo 1 good     filet questionable arrived greyish color   in moment thought may lighting but flavor said differently  still tender but worth $60 price tag  Sweet Corn sweet savory just hint spice   delicious! Chocolate Tart definitely worth going just this   decadent!  Service great!

Anyway seated only few minutes checking didn't chance order bar which looked nice comfortable seating   The restaurant offers tasting menu $100 something along booklet couple recipes picture Giada   noticed also did Gordon Ramsay Steak too   declined instead ordered regular menu   also noticed specialty cocktails listed along photos iPad instead menu   GR did well   maybe new Vegas thing?  liked though   don't order iPad though but order your waiter   ordered Orzo Meatballs Really tender meatballs comes five small meatballs    Sauce seemed regular spaghetti sauce but could tell meatballs your ordinary fare  Lemon Basil Spaghetti $34 spaghetti supposed come al dente but didn't   slightly overcooked   Boo   two shrimp came very large sweet delicious   However spaghetti itself disappointing   could taste more pasta itself vs sauce which light lemon sauce   felt slightly cheated price wasn't very happy dish  Scallops Crab Risotto $32 also very average   friend craving good risotto while but just tasted soupy rice   scallops bit salty side think maybe three little pieces crab rice   decent but good OC's Pinot Provence corn risotto year ago  Broccoli Rabe $10 friend thought bit salty but though just right   cooked nicely slightly sweet chili flavoring  Chocolate Budino Came chilled very smooth thicker pudding creamier    Thumbs up   little sprinkles pistachio crumbs really good too     They gave short sweet sparkling wine amuse bouche which liked   reminded light moscato   also give three kinds bread   favorite big crispy cheese chip    Yum   also give platter five different condiments lemon butter nicely whipped slight taste lemon dried capers etc   Cool!

Handmade pasta pesto appetizer options keep coming back authentic Italian entrees  could delicious food but sure other reviews cover that  must miss lemon ricotta cookies  Oh goodness AMAZING  Eat them take them bring them gifts try eat those too  <EOR> This review strictly based Brunch Giada's would say would never eat Brunch Giada's ever again!   It very offensive horrific charge $9 00 small orange juice $6 00 coffee most dishes unreasonably priced small amounts average tasting brunch food  Please $18 00 two egg plate bacon less 3 oz potatoes toast kidding me!!!! No didn't any Golden Eggs this!!!  Yes am worldly traveler Vegas does finer brunch options more quantity quality asking price!! brunch dining very slow people sharing plates am sure also offended price points being presented  server very attentive gracious but  did mention other guest unhappy price points quantity quality pricing!   Giada does offer also $45 Brunch Buffet    should joke but isnt  Please Giada staff reevaluate your Brunch menu pay   ABSURD!     NO GOLDEN EGGS Giada's!! <EOR> I'm generously giving Giada 3 stars but only because service  boyfriend came birthday waiter very courteous exactly kind waiter want always all dining experiences  He appeared legitimately Italian based accent which definitely added experience    I'll admit wanted come brief weekend trip Vegas boyfriend good sport it  love Giada's show thought myself what's better actually getting sample food she cooks TV? Obviously Giada herself does prepare food but still restaurant assume chefs use recipes  Unfortunately Giada restaurant some other diners posted  Granted wasn't really expecting either    I reservation but boyfriend wanted window table requested it  ended waiting additional 25 minutes booth faced window but expected such long additional wait  known would just told them forget it   Onto food     They give variety complimentary bread several accompaniments which really enjoyed  But don't need give excuse enjoy some free bread  love carbs  Crab Salad Crostini start good was  entree ordered Pappardelle which high hopes maybe high  pasta itself good  pork ragout sits atop disappointed  WAYYYYY salty  downing water every bite  ate all pasta but left ragout boyfriend since meal bit paltry terms portion size  He ordered Three Cheese Tortellini really liked except fact probably less 10 dime sized pieces actual tortellini there   We opted skip dessert since plans elsewhere that  However waiter brought boyfriend two small cookies birthday dessert which really nice do  average taste wise  better cookies they're least favorite thing bake  guess could say food average below  unlikely return any future visits Vegas   Overall 3 5 5 Food 1 5 5 Service 5 5 Atmosphere 4 5 <EOR> I lunch family during week  made reservations week advance when arrived famished   ended waiting half hour past reservation time  However hostess server apologized several times wait     Knowledgeable servers decent drinks delicious food   portions small tradition European cuisine order some appetizers share along your entree   We kale mushroom pizza antipasti  G signature cocktail tenderloin sliders lunch disappointed  Finished off cappugiro assorted cookie platter   Overall fun dining experience good food great ambience   come back dinner sometime  <EOR> Very very disappointed! came Sunday night August 2 celebrate birthday waste time first let say none employees know dining booth when made reservations asked placed booth young man said he would notes no guarantee available but he request which OK when arrived told hostess requested booth she turned said yes booth she took right banquette booth inside whole restaurant we' asked seated somewhere else stuck back room next wine cellar OK really big deal started two appetizers orzo meatballs some other type balls impressed enough even remember name both horrible never tasteless meatball before then she should embarrassed even call herself Italian! should've stopped but wanted give main dish chance ordered Branzino     Big mistake! don't understand restaurant getting great reviews maybe someone kitchen just mad purposely trying ruin her! Save yourself some time money Rosati's Grand Teton Durango now  Italian! <EOR> What disappointment! expecting much restaurant am sad say am disappointed  restaurant itself really pretty but food just nothing special definitely over priced   I don't know if expectations high coming famous chef but could better italian food LA  The tomato soup just regular home made tomato soup without any twist $25 pastas just ridiculous expensive was  Is because restaurant meant tourists probably never back disappointing? am sure but definitely spend money another restaurant when back Vegas  <EOR> Worst service ever had  hardly anyone restaurant took 1 hr food  host slow focused  ask 2 times seat  Food just ok   Don't expect place stay open  <EOR> Expected much more Giada  Don't even know where start  shrimp pasta tasted chalky plump juicy  sourcing agent should ask Viva Arepas where wonderful shrimp  pasta course tiny bowl tasteless pasta way much money  sure about  Prosciutto plate also kinda bland didn't pack flavorful punch   Service great view strip wonderful 2 3 floor  <EOR> Giada may many things but subtle isn't them   eponymous restaurant juts over Las Vegas Strip more prominently cleavage juts HDTV whenever boob tube tuned Food Network  See did there?

Best description simple beautiful taste pleasantly surprise you  Never knew wonderful simple meat ball taste squash strings you'll swear best shoe string fries ever had  Let's just say your typical fill place littered strip fulfill your hunger night drink binging  Plus putting your famous name something doesn't mean gonna any good manny celebrity filled over priced places strip  Yes Giada puts name but significant difference everything  Finally she quite frequently oversee every corner operations kitchen customers  Ya she actually spends lots time dining area genuine your guest over house    Spent some time review sure but deserves attention perspective  ! <EOR> I Vegas motorcycle auction last weekend luck would good friends same time    days filled much nights she joined Bally's auction decided off some lunch    close didn't want miss much auction action fun   Giada's fit bill perfectly   We both very impressed walked into place absolutely beautiful   hostess seated best window table overlooking strip Caesar's Palace    treating thrilled see prices more reasonable lunch    actually lunch amazing place under $20 per person   course didn't but still much less would expected      I Bloody Mary friend Prosecco start off lunches she Sardinian Gnocchi al Pomodoro $16 which waiter explained your traditional Gnocchi but more pasta potato flavor   he right still delicious    decided enjoy pizza Salumi Piccante spicy dry sausage san marzano tomato sauce mozzarella oregano also $16    Delicious generous    table four could share hearty appetizer    Our server exceptional nice very helpful steering other places should try during respective Las Vegas vacations!   friend thought hostesses' dresses adorable  <EOR> I can't express thoroughly disappointed dining Giada  As long time fan excited finally try restaurant    restaurant beautifully appointed design warm comfortable yet modern interesting  Maybe having terribly off night maybe new chef kitchen don't know    But 'could care less' bartender completely over cooked two dishes pasta felt totally ripped off whole experience   sat bar greeted bar back but took least five minutes bartender even acknowledge even though he talking gentleman 5 feet away us    decided dinner bar   From bartender attitude he better things do  two overworked moms just wanted fun night Las Vegas trying connection he just wasn't having it   Moving dinner  took VER everything   We started octopus appetizer  both love octopus but over cooked  if did quick char then left sitting under heat lamp  Which unfortunate because probably would pretty decent dish    Then ricotta appetizer think ricotta  crostini best dish night    Then shared both spaghetti shrimp Bucatini  ricotta    literally took 40 additional minutes when finished octopus getting pasta  asked twice  bartender smugly said good things come those wait    Both pastas  over cooked even four year old would near them  mush  both trying both dishes told bartender over cooked instead offering different dishes he just asked if wanted take them off bar    awkward uncomfortable would never put myself space again    think Giada  would've mortified handling recipes treatment guests    only giving two stars because ricotta appetizer drinks    least jerky bartender made good cocktail  <EOR> Was expecting  know shouldn't put expectations anything but really wanted try restaurant because her!  First off place beautifully decorated  welcomed large hostess area even photo booth left hostess stand capture your experience    We arrived dinner around 5 45pm Saturday 2 piece band playing top 40 hits  really cool vibe   Now let's why only gave place 3 stars  Service incredibly snooty slow  server personable all  did even table touch manager  When check Yelp splash prosecco cookie plate table  When asked cookie plate included couldn't even answer    We ordered small cheese plate off antipasti menu yummy but can't really mess cheese plate   We tried lamb risotto ravioli all flavorless  Felt eating cardboard  son rigatoni off kids menu he liked it    Also enjoyed tiramisu cheesecake pastry safe bet well    All all glad tried but returning recommending place anyone  <EOR> Great decor view oysters best had!   HOWEVER shrimp spaghetti lemon basil served without shrimp when brought them side extremely overcooked! lamb undercooked white lasagna needed salt  Server very nice but fine dining level    This place potential worth price but kitchen needs ensure food going perfect  <EOR> Unorganized sloppy rude  hostess couldn't find reservations initially because spending more time chatting listening party name count part party joining later we'd asked seated anyway which ignored entirely instead letting sit bar waitress obviously hired more looks ability  Unable water drinks appetizers she instead threw attitude when  them directly bar admit every counter staff amazing   Finally being seated empty table I'd staring nearly hour quarter menu unavailable because ran but rather because put wrong menu kitchen unwilling cook menu  Being pushed heavily toward rather unimpressive special instead appetizers some salumi oysters few drinks dinner instead light snack  Next time save half price twice meal Joe's  <EOR> What lovely addition strip  restaurant very wide open spacious but decor small details feel cozy  absolutely love all details! ladies all wear white eyelet dresses while men wear checkered shirts navy tie  bougie but just right  escalators left small photo booth mark your experience take note!

Sorry Giada    I no love your restaurant   and looking forward really nice meal splurge dinner Vegas  MANAGEMENT SHOULD ADJUSTED BILL!  Our best meal week Kabuki off strip! into raw fish  <EOR> I'm Giada fan watch show regular basis   But she needs Undercover Boss restaurant   She would mad embarrassed service food presentation food itself     We greeted smile immediately seated   crowded all   Maybe 8 tables people seated  Now only good thing could say    We waited waited waiter   He finally came over 15 minutes   He explained menu started walk away   asked if could order drinks 3 coffees water    Took 20 minutes before he came back drinks   finally ordered waited long time food   During time noticed other people waiting lady actually stood table signal someone take order   food finally arrived 1 2 hour later just OK   nothing write home about   actually asked gentleman delivered food some salt pepper he said no problem   He never came back   know group almost left because service bad   Sorry say back would recommend restaurant   Sorry but place needs help   don't believe see many return customers which torpedo place  <EOR> A year ago pre birthday dinner here  Giada's housed luxurious Cromwell Hotel very nice elevator accessed upper floor  Unfortunately way buzzed two bottles excellent Sicilian Wine write review time  besides wants birthday boy's face stuffed into cellphone writing review during birthday dinner  am writing now   Through haze recall  wine selection exceptional fairly priced  restaurant beautiful staff great  menu really exciting    We ordered fried calamari a must girlfriend any establishment offer no matter upscale then followed prima piatti penne or orccietta red sauce then followed rack lamb herbs  split everything    Here issue why place getting 4 stars if 5  Everything way salty   it  food great    but salty  If food salty then isn't right  easy fix  Salt lightly then let guest use cheese salt even simply sprinkle some salt it  Pasta red sauce should salted lightly because everyone grates cheese Romano essentially nothing but milk lot salt   If Giada herself kitchen wouldn't happened  But she kitchen   On really good note repeat wine great dinner dessert cappuccinos both perfect  <EOR> I'd give place 3 5 stars rounded down 3 review    This place very contemporary I love decor  escalators greeted hostesses top photo booth left which nice touch  never seen restaurant photo booth  right restaurant love spacious modern feels  really liked furniture all cups plates utensils   you definitely felt high end restaurant  also windows surrounding restaurant much light coming in  came brunch can't speak dinner the evening    For brunch offer sampler meal which $45 person which great deal if feeling hungry but did if person your party orders sampler everyone your party must order appetizer entree  think ridiculous hate being forced order food  party 8 although person wanted order sampler he spared rest being forced order appetizer just ordered each item he wanted separately  bottomless mimosas $30 person  Service great server forgot beverages ask someone else bring them over  She seemed she just paying very much attention day  believe juice coffee $9 each which bit steep at least good    On food really liked meatball appetizer but keep mind very small dish  carbonara pizza amazing would definitely order again  lasagna also good but bit pricy but did enjoy dish  small dish lasagna cheesy which good thing came small arugula salad some shaved cheese  Overall place pricy which expected but wouldn't mind coming back sometime  <EOR> Something said food  dined evening 12 19 wondering all hype about  food hype about  enjoyed table buratta prosciutto octopus apps  All fantastic those were  Entrees included mustard crusted rack lamb lobster ravioli which both die for  Dessert molten lava cake which good expected    Now desired service  seated promptly wait staff first very helpful letting know restaurant  reservation 5 00pm failed realize much service standard declined when busy  entire dinner took almost 2 1 2 hours result  placed order apps took around 20 25 min then entrees around 45 50 min  actually caught myself checking time long since placed order  only other thing noticed when place busy waiter seemed disappear  waited 20 min drink refilled then last time asked refill didn't even bring back time left 20 min later   Point Food good expected be  kitchen doing right  FOH however left little desired  reason 3 stars  <EOR> Love Giada Love restaurant  My husband Giada's twice during visit Vegas strip   Food drinks excellent   Most outstanding superior staff   received over top service  <EOR> All restaurants strip lines blocks long made Open Table breakfast reservation  turns didn't really need it  We immediately greeted 2 young uniform not cute uniform clad hostesses taken table where pleasantly greeted lovely polite appropriate waitress  We coffee immediately  why couldn't give 5 stars  coffee lukewarm  decided since already told waitress water glasses water spots around rim wouldn't mention coffee  Other husband both really enjoyed unusual breakfast choices  eggs cooked requested side meatballs potatoes toast  He very happy  Not being egg person opted chicken waffles  large portion unusual breakfast but very good nice something unusual  Great service great place  sort looked West Elm store steroids  Very cool  Great art  Almost much but fun! <EOR> We Las Vegas Easter weekend  Giana's did disappoint  nice Easter brunch included pastry antipasti appetizer arugula salad main dish crab cakes Benedict dessert  Absolutely wonderful experience  <EOR> This

<EOR> I came favorite peoples birthday  many people interested few made reservation few smaller tables then just asked if seated together   While wasn't witness seemed OK GM bday girl talked him  She email reservations manager according them tried take pre fixe group menu impose spending minimum  NO  3 separate reservations some ginoromous group even all us  No  Those group menus weren't interesting most us  just asked tables near each other  put bad taste mouth almost cancelled if wasn't point argue of  trying let know option maybe easier kitchen but any other parties 6 10 people wouldn't imposed them sure  only because asked sit each other    We arrived dinner no didn't group menus    It took little while orders bread but once dinner rolled pace good food came fairly timely manner  side note think iPad menus needed  froze quite few times talked antipasto platters main menu could miss  also talked alcoholic beverages wine list booklet already    Breadservice good  small pot herb focaccia some crisps breadsticks tray condiments pesto finishing salt red pepper lemon marscapone butter fried capers  I decide split some items friend Anthony    Caponata pleasant texture veggies good but tad sweet  when sweet tangy  could big hit bit acidity  tried offset bit fried capers red pepper condiment tray  really should come some nice bread though  okay crisp focaccia but didn't enough bread basket small 6 people   Grilled octopus simple flavors but octopus tender  Everything cooked nicely but wish something give octopus diced potatoes some oomph  nice puree sauce veloute add little something   Marsala chicken meatballs decent  wasn't sweet marsalas but more wine y flavor Came few mushrooms 2 small tomatoes stem   Veal Saltimbocca lovely Nicely crisp cheese stuffing solid well seasoned  incorporation sage it  good size maybe 14 16oz   Crispy Polenta side veal  simple but good though mine wasn't really crisp  enjoyed tomato sauce it    Dessert cart chose honey chocolate almond tart  almost perfect  florentine cap top money  texture chocolate filling nice but tad sweet along honey would preferred bitter chocolate offset  However really well made still pretty damn good    Out meal standout veal saltimbocca  singular item would order again considering most expensive then perhaps good thing worth it    Service OK but some hiccups  mentioned earlier took moment take off don't know why server going table answer questions then disappeared few times  bussers little plate eager  plate taken while still eating bread but turned conversation found gone  took bone off veal then split half place individual plate  moment plate being lifted say wait!

The server annoyed because didn't order cocktails tasting menu    The food good but portions very small even compared other upscale restaurants  girlfriend ordered scallop risotto which literally 4 oz  serving they measure it   rack lamb interestingly half size racks lamb order other restaurants  Which begs question why call *half* rack lamb? tiny appetites wasn't problem but think most people would disappointed if paid $100 two dinner entrees small   My girlfriend's risotto underdone but she really enjoyed it  rice still pretty hard stuck teeth  ordered lamb medium well but received medium rare  sent back came back past point being well done because second time grilling lost most its flavorful juices  well seasoned but little dry   After dinner server then started another round pressure selling time dessert  When said no room dessert she loudly said WHAT? comes Giada doesn't try dessert?

Torn between item menus decided opt small plate app pasta dish entree  Giada Italian pasta dish made sense  app decided bacon wrapped dates stuffed sausage  dish hit every flavor component sweet dates salty sausage smokey bacon spicy chili inside  would definitely order again if given chance  pasta dish where meal derailed  ordered lamb ragu mint yogurt sauce  Taste wise dish amazing but PORTION downright pathetic  Why am paying 30 something dollars literally three strips pasta dough two tablespoons sauce? Don't wrong delicious but absolutely worth money  The waiter told removing menu perhaps  why  fact entree portions all around seemed underwhelming   Giada's restaurant should wow factor but instead found paying branding  food delicious but can't justify paying Giada's name small portions  would open minded returning Giada just try some those small plates though  <EOR> I brunch March 13 2016  Very nice clean establishment  Beautiful decor  Italian chicken waffles yum!!!

Bacon wrapped dates $15 great appetizer tons flavor Tricolore salad $17 perfect combination ingredients  The bad mediocre Charred octopus $16 okay but also much better  The ugly never again! Pea pesto crostini $15 flavorless! prosciutto obviously great quality but pea spread par  Thankfully give little tray crushed red pepper sea salt helped bit Whole roast chicken 2 $58 DRY!!! blown away dry dish was  came tomato sauce but would needed soak sauce all day reduce dryness meat    I say service wonderful  read many reviews stated waitstaff pushy drinks tasting menu but wasn't case all  restaurant itself also beautiful  absolutely love decor perfect view strip  photo booth waiting area also nice touch  won't back but still glad checked place out  <EOR> Been waiting several months time spend Giada very disappointed   Reserved time arrived 45 minutes early rather empty place  Sat waiting couches entire time finally bar service  extremely slow! Finally seated table napkin unfolded revealed 1 inch hole it  Waitress spilled water onto table when initially serving minimal wiping  Antipasti tasting very nice cheeses olives tomato tapanade  Margarita pizza grilled cheese served hot excellent   Chicken meatballs marsala served cold    why????? Its hot appetizer!! No excuse just re served little warm really hot! Wait staff inattentive  lunch worth ambiance cost! Checked off bucket list without recommendation public   Giada   you should proud your name attached place  <EOR> I hoping really love restaurant since love watching Giada's cooking show  made reservations Saturday Thanksgiving 2 months prior 5 people  asked if special occasion stated nieces bday   First things first self parking limited shared adjacent hotel n timeshare  no option but valet  5pm  then restaurant still wait 15 min table when hostess sat stood idiots bc still prepping table  Epic fail!!  When finally sat waitress unprepared   Trying give menu empty she another one   5min later she comes back takes drink order  She looked disheveled n no personality   Food mediocre being fancy restaurant  ordered crab n scallop risotto which bits crab shells it  told waitress response oh happens sometimes n walked away  scallops very salty well  appetizers good octopus calamari n shrimp some cheese thing which can't remember name of  nothing special dessert menu which surprised bc Giada awesome desserts show   So occasion nieces bday acknowledged 3 people restaurant did nothing special even piece chocolate??

Eventually bus boy said Well could dinner table section try paper menu  said please but he promptly forgot never did   Another bizarre thing    asked dessert cart guy where ladies room was  He said he would walk over it  said no thank you  Again he insisted walking it  figured really must hidden difficult find? he walked over door plain view just off entrance  did require escort   The food flavor quality indeed 5 star but everything else 1 star  PASS  <EOR> FYI experience took place late 2014   review may pretty useless everyone but am writing anyways because fabulous time Giada!!
