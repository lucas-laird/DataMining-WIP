Definitely returning future! <EOR> Great service  pork carnitas used having shredded but still good flavor but also lot fat  try again but order something else next time <EOR> Ate Tuesday night  food delicious well cooked  ordered lengua combination ordered flour tortilla which world  only took them less 15 minutes prepare dish  also ordered large horchata  tasted almost perfect  small joint but offer great food service! coming back  again whenever crave Mexican food  Oh yeah left place very satisfied  <EOR> Almost exactly same Roberto's except called Fausto's  No major differences note   However if want California burrito fries carne asada don't order California burrito  You'll order Nevada burrito  California burrito Fausto's rice carne asada  incorrect burrito naming bit blasphemous but forgiveable because both delicious  <EOR> Carne Asada supernachos no beans! <EOR> In opinion carne asada fries better Roberto's  Only because fries stay crunchy longer vs Roberto's  fries @ Roberto's become soggy quickly  also serve tamales!!! Which love!! <EOR> For chain fast food American Mexican food delicious! Cheap prices convenient location quick service  appreciate salsa bar offering red green salsas pickled jalapeños carrots onions cucumbers radishes  salsas could better but flavor red salsa adds nice spice food  Service isn't necessarily friendly but two minute interaction don't really care  order your food cashier pay pick your food then eat   it   This location only picture menu no prices except breakfast options   lot items drenched not so melted shredded cheddar cheese sour cream and or guacamole you've warned  simply order meal without all toppings satisfied   I've only handful times but experience consistent  normally order Carne Asada Fries Nachos and or Carne Asada Tacos  don't normally deviate items but Breakfast Burrito Tamales  Everything tasty    During visit yesterday wanted see Pastor stood street vendors ordered two Al Pastor Tacos $2 30 each topped pico de gallo guacamole  shabby! surprised pork tender flavorful  Certainly good alternative street tacos! Ruben ordered Chicken Quesadilla Combination Plate $6 35 packed three very large slices quesadilla refried beans Mexican rice  chicken moist juicy much it! They're holding back  also shared Carne Asada Fries $6 95 always delicious although never season fries just needs bit salt  small drink unlimited refills just $1 50 no lemon lime soda option all prices include sales tax  <EOR> I love place same thing Every time chicken chimichanga  <EOR> Best bean cheese burrito  tortilla really good too! guys nice too  <EOR> So morning craving breakfast burrito  kind 99 cents drive through  real man's breakfast burrito packed enough meat potatoes eggs help survive three days without eating anything else  Fausto's best breakfast burritos town    For some reason Roberto's never made breakfast burrito worth time  potatoes onions consistently undercooked  Sometimes cheese might melted  But Faustos knows cook decent burrito every time    So    know moment when walk door ready glory your favorite plate menu  butterflies excitement almost taste marriage bacon potatoes cheese salsa verde dripping enormous tortilla shell  then      Everything derailed hunch something new  case    Chilaquiles    I chilaquiles San Francisco farmers market Embarcadeiro insanely delicious  Crispy fresh Tortilla chips spicy green chili salsa liberal toss Cotija  Fausto's delivered soggy wreck limp chips smothered run mill green sauce  Doused sour cream  little tired Mexican restaurants obliging American pallet sour cream  alright but heavy hand ruin dish  chilaquiles very good   So sit lamenting choice am hearing sounds intelligent people roll order breakfast burros another  Friday going great  far day feels pretty ordinary  But next time use brain came leave happy happy man    Since place seeming trick pony rating Fausto's 3 stars  Los Tacos Taco y Taco Tacos el Gordo don't need worry finding good lunch spot Mexican  But keep Fausto's Rolodex occasional breakfast burrito  But chilaquiles    Never more  <EOR> Great carne asada plate  Loved rice spicy hot sauce side  Reasonably priced tasty! <EOR> Muy excellente! Came boyfriend custom made burrito rice beans asada shrimp absolutely fantastic   ordered Las Vegas burrito best [california styled] burrito ever tasted since living Vegas   Fausto's Mexican Grill spot going forward! Shout Angel helping us  back! <EOR> My mom hankering rolled tacos  Being originally San Diego high expectations when comes authentic Mexican food  establishment took mother's order beef rolled tacos guacamole cheese sour cream side pico de gallo  cook took 5 pre rolled tacos freezer literally dipped them hot oil 3 minutes packed them gave them mom  She took bite completely unsatisfied! She said she never again! personally think expectations may little high when came place food  Try yourself  husband didn't problem it  He said weren't best but weren't bad  <EOR> Must say entrees extremely cheap generous portions   Expect pay $6 $7   bar available pick your sauces peppers nice touch   I ordered chicken burrito complete meal which includes beans rice   ok but biggest minus didn't flavor chicken meat which unbelievable!  No wonder need sauce bar give some flavor  <EOR> Great place! Consistent food delivers every time use Roberto's blue diamond but good lately food  always rely Fausto's Nevada burritos  <EOR> Came because chile verde ridiculous wait  carne asada fries which super bland  carrots even salsa no flavor! Everything pre made just heat up  fries ready literally minute ordered  friend tacos tortillas cold stale  Totally did satisfy Mexican craving  yourself favor just don tortaco robertos    even better chile verde! cucumbers good! staff very nice also! <EOR> Faustos place just robertos don tortaco only thing different beans types chips use  better refried beans other two offer little more menu  Now don't recommend breakfast burritos which faves but recommend fish tacos shrimp tacos carne asada nachos <EOR> Awesome burritos    Made order great price   Three salsas choose all very good!  Bomb tortilla too!! <EOR> Really sad used love location but  new management owners changed salsa removed stuff menu   eating location since opened   guess im going robertos now on  <EOR> Truth told   never ever exceptional customer service Mexican joint until dined Fausto's  cashier friendly gave few suggestions some popular items since indecisive  ended ordering Carne Asada enchilada rice beans OMG  the meat made best way ever it  wish Orange Bang drink but  alright customer service AWESOME! <EOR> So just back week long vacation East Coast we're jonesing some Mexican food but we're lazy real restaurant mention Fausto's hadn't forever  perusing Yelp photos settle Chicken Chimichanga gonna share Carne Asada Nacho  Doug just Carne Asada burrito  Holy hell nacho size enormous hardly put dent them but good  star Chicken Chimi good! Believe reviews  chicken moist kind wet tomatoey juice lots cheese peppers tomatoes onions inside perfectly fried tortilla greasy  totally again urged husband well  The food super cheap amount get  Service fast friendly   Why apart long? won't let happen again  <EOR> Clean  Cheap  Legit  Just Roberto's but better  salsa bar fresh clean  All regular stuff  3 salsas actually  back every time am Vegas  <EOR> This best Mexican food Las Vegas extremely inexpensive  ordered chimichanga came nearly pound chicken   It's classiest place any means but food good back next day try chorizo breakfast burrito  Another 10 10  going back again  <EOR> After moved Vegas haven't really find burrito joint around where live  friend recommended place decided give try yesterday disappointed all  I ordered Tuesday special Chicken burrito gf Nevada burrito they both taste great think both love Nevada burrito more steak fries burrito great combo! My chicken burrito great only $3 I love daily specials weekdays just awesome when trying save some bucks still great taste portion  the only downside why didn't give 5 star due kitchen size food may take awhile when gets busy  noticed  why many people call ahead place order before pick up  this place definitely going favorite taco burrito joint now <EOR> Unfortunately post updated review Fausto's  original five stars but location gone downhill past year so    The first thing used three delicious salsas used every meal  great  However those no more    Now only two salsas both pretty bad  Tonight runny couldn't even any stay chips  Sad!  To issue more pressing entrees seem lost all flavor no delectable salsa mask fact  enchiladas taco both incredibly bland    This used place I'd bring friends town try now think may just made last visit    I just hope management reads fixes things because saw other reviewers stating same thing  <EOR> I 2 times now fist time great  second time everything just cooked death taco shells super hard couldn't even bite them carne asada cooked little tuff <EOR> After recommendation three headed Fausto's dinner   scanning wall menu ordered three separate combo plates   arrived barely Luke warm   cheese enchiladas pretty cheese less very little filling   didn't care refried beans tostada combo plate   found them very lardy tasting   Nothing special chili relleno either   doubt if back anytime soon   just many Mexican food restaurants area  <EOR> Had carne asada burrito OK but couple crunchy parts which didn't think should there   Don't think going back  <EOR> Went joint friend decided try due Mexican food phase recent trip san Diego    First things first compared other taco shops robertos amigos place CLEAN  well maintained bright inside gives your digestive system some peace mind    Prices tad bit cheaper other taco shops little crazy ordered excessive quantity food  lengua carne asada fish tacos along sausage breakfast burrito  standout quality within quality ingredients fresh veggies good high grade quality lean meat  especially liked fish taco came served tartar sauce tangy pico de gallo salsa  Breakfast burrito above average    Overall faustos taco fixation moment small place located strip mall highly rated yelp restarunts such Oyshi sushi but don't afraid check place out  <EOR>
