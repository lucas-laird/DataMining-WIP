Unfortunately good service bring back Sergio's  Good luck those try Sergio's  hope your experience better ours  <EOR> The linguini pescatore nothing short fantastic! sourdough bread pesto butter great start delicious  found location through Yelp reviews did lie  happy take trip off strip provided  beautiful restaurant lovely people working   The only reason did give five because feeling keeping them closing  arrived 8 45pm while food did take overly long time prepared didn't finish until around 10  also wait cab back strip  seemed hurry cleared table moment finished glass plate fork etc  While appreciate attention just little much me   But once again great find off strip people working very helpful friendly especially Herb  He waiter made sure taken care of  <EOR> My wife couple weeks ago  Italian place going wasn't open last minute change  really review staff more food honest cant recall quality meal probably due awful experience  only 2 other groups restaurant  waiter completely clueless when came wine  ordered Zinfandel Shiraz think only each wine list  waiter arrived table two glasses white wine  When pointed no ordered white he proceeded try convince white Zinfandel    no such thing wine list White Zin rose colored anyway   On  second attempt waiter came back 2 glasses red chilled sweet  think port both glasses same thing  Again nothing Shiraz Zin  now meals served given wine  end did think correct wine towards end meal asked waiter bring bottles   I no problem waiter knowing wines long he admits but being treated complete idiots incredibly offensive  never back  <EOR> The meal wonderful pleasant presented everything fresh very tasty  Caesar absolutely wonderful addition lunch service courtesy  best Italian food Las Vegas <EOR> After several days business meetings Vegas boss selected Sergio's venue team celebration dinner last Friday night  group included total 10 people although did reservation until Friday afternoon Sergio's very accomodating  quickly kindly responded email inquiry confirming reservation  website mentions provide complimentary transportation strip called arrangement driver  gentleman answered call said typcially require 24 hours' notice shuttle pickups but he would best servers help which he did  phone call 15 minutes before reservation Herb server saying he would waiting hotel valet stop  When met he all politeness good humor joking he helped into van restaurant uses shuttle  short drive away strip I think between 5 10 minutes arrived Sergio's Herb welcomed warmly lovely dining room  Another gentleman also very welcoming ushered seats long table set perfectly placed near piano which pianist sat played beautifully throughout evening  Although place very crowded still felt cozy intimate  absolutely spotless terms cleanliness decor ambience truly charming real candles lit every table use  menus provided abundance delicious options meal but Herb himself recommended Seafood Pasta dish Oso Buco which apparently house over course 5 hours   boss a very well traveled man refined palate deep appreciation high quality food ordered Seafood Pasta told afterwards only highlight among all meals week Vegas but also best dishes he ever enjoyed life  compliment meant great deal coming especially week full outstanding meals addition bread appetizers salad immediately preceeding entrees Sergio's  bread disappeared very quickly appetizers themselves could dinner  ordered fried calamari which Herb quite rightly called best town sauteed calamari another recommendation Herb grilled vegetables platter came prosciutto tomato mozzarella  Everything positively mouth watering  personal favorite sauteed calamari its phenomenal sauce savory without being overly salty  grilled vegetables also perfectly done such smoke heat served enhance all inherent flavors rather overwhelm them  Everyone enjoyed each dish immensely already began wonder whether would able finish meals  When house salads came every entree arrived ideal light crisp interlude between appetizers main dishes  would usually skip house salad which tends boring flavorless many restaurants but actually good enough stand alone  would recommend entree someone looking small portion low calorie option plenty taste it  When table once again clear which servers did fantastic job throughout evening water glasses never empty Herb several other servers brought entrees all once so did sit waiting anyone while dishes came first cold   all thrilled choices  dish Pollo alla Marchigiana absolutely excellent  chicken eggplant tender juicy sauce addictive ended dipping carrots broccoli came side plate into every last drop it  plate also came small piece polenta which never tried before but good if quite amazing rest meal   Some green beans peeled boiled potato remained uneaten plate simply full finish everything  table clear once more albeit littered several to go boxes Herb cheerfully asked if saved room dessert showed tray dessert choices  all deeply regretted saved room because all looked sinfully good  colleagues ordered Herb's specialty Pomegranate Martini also thought those fantastic  While Herb drove back hotel he continued joke gave some knowledgeable recommendations shows see nightclubs visit  next time trip Vegas sure revisit Sergio's pleasure ask Herb particular  <EOR> My wife nice anniversary dinner

Never again  <EOR> Sergio's neck woods but came restaurant com certificate bought quite while ago   Another couple joined first time them too     The inside restaurant beautiful old world design complete pillars made feel if Italy   sorry see nearly empty prime dinner hour but then saw quickly populated two different Japanese tour groups first headed back room second group sat main dining room  Aside given menus which why never travel tours!    Our waiter Wes excellent   Oh he bit pushy upsell but then again friends served lower priced chardonnay when ordered without realizing two differently priced ones choose from   Wes obviously restaurant quite while presentation specials polished service wonderful without being intrusive   All four ordered chicken dishes all different   Marchegiana which roasted red peppers mozzarella light orange colored wine sauce   husband Marsala covered abundance dark earthy mushrooms   other hubby Mr  Unadventurous stuck usual Chicken Parmegiana   He special blinders let see only dish menu time he no complaints   wife ordered lemon chicken dish she liked but pronounced little lemony   Um maybe  why call Lemon Chicken?  A good crusty bread made in house served delicious pesto butter   would preferred usual baguette style instead thin loaf like slices but tasted great anyway   The grand piano put good use player around since before Mob   Happily wasn't loud couldn't conversation definitely enhanced experience   My major complaint many other restaurants prices website updated unwelcome surprise see them all $3 4 higher posted online though still moderate Vegas standards   But discount still reasonable wonderful meal great service classy setting  <EOR> I start saying eat quite bit but rarely Italian food  always think pasta   which cheap easy home   Anyway recently moved side town determined find all little hidden gems new neighborhood  Sergio's gems!!
