Worst buffet ever $105 wasted Asian food very few bad Meats pure fat hard chew Salads regular Avoid place <EOR> This rating only dinner buffet which now always everytime Vegas! someone buffets only seafood seafood excellent money  Gigantic shrimp crablegs lobster best salmon all buffets imo  other nice thing since tucked away second floor Aria usually no long lines Bellagio  Going back New year's! <EOR> The aria buffet just dreamy! loved well worth cost! would given 5 stars second but upset paid 2 hours bottomless drinks 8 43pm told 1 drink 9 40 bar closing 10pm!!! spending time enjoying buffet! Very upset did more two drinks  But buffet just wonderful! <EOR> Everything dry salty flavorless   menu did enough variety only thing looking fresh pineapple    Very disappointing     worst buffet ever <EOR> food    We since read some reviews  little bit disappointed  food selection really few compared other buffet  But service great  spent 95 dollar two people there  highly recommended  <EOR> We ate Aria buffet since staying hotel the other buffet going try ridiculously long line    no line Aria     The price over thanksgiving weekend inflated I recommend dining buffet over holiday weekends prices most buffets over inflated definitely worth price increase The food comparably fresher other buffets but selection very limited     The buffet boasts only tandoor oven Vegas buffet  found naan biscuit quality which liking  tandoori chicken however very juicy succulent  Taste somewhat lacking though    The other standout crab legs fortunately served hot hate cold crab legs     Seafood slightly above par all respects The pasta salad selection surprisingly decent    Carvery standard selection preparation slightly below par Dessert selection below par all aspects   Asian food below par all aspects    You should buffet if hate waiting lines if charging standard price  <EOR> like rating says Meh  experienced better  The reason because someone told chef same Bellagio which originally wanted go    I've Wynn Rio buffet before    think Wynn best tried far   but heard Bellagio crazy good! I'd say Aria OK   I'd rather Wynn    Next time   im going try Bellagio one   maybe its good say   T  btw   also heard line shorter bellagio   actually didnt wait   wasnt bad but wasnt good    <EOR> 2 visits same trip   Buffett Bellagio accepted head class   Aria Hotel City Centre very un Vegas  Think clean cool lines textures  Buffet carries theme  Due new strip no huge stomach rumbling lines dinner  Nope walk right weekday visit weekend visit  If supersize kinda diner well place you   buffett doesnot carry huge selection Bellagio even close  But well done most part tasty  Indian station night tikka massala chicken another fish jalfrazie would beleive naan oven right front  Roast Beef Lamb Turkey Pork  smattering pastas  fish two  Weekend hotel rooms buffets means higher prices  Aria does different offer each person paying Friday Saturday ransom gets table service lobster tail plus glass your choice red white    tail your New England crustacean but more Naw 'leans crayfish    Aria gets good marks trying   The deserts though small  variety compared massive sweets say Bellagio's actually better tasting visually more appealing   Super sized? Nope  Fine dining? Nope  But less feeding frenzy good attempt raising buffet bar  <EOR> I am almost embarrassed say came breakfast brunch all 3 days Vegas  also dinner back March    Breakfast lots options  tried almost everything  really liked chilaquiles sort fried chopped enchiladas those yet try deliciousness   waffles plantains pizza bagel many cream cheese options also good  many meat options too    The omelets made order just alright  cooks them very friendly though  corn beef hash good  Note yogurt more European sour opinion    What really loved buffet dinner  Save sixteen bucks McDonald's breakfast come lunch dinner  Lots options American Korean Chinese Mexican Italian Indian everything tasted great  standouts stuffed shells Indian fare chicken curry rice garlic naan   ate shells naan until needed wheelbarrow ed out  <EOR> $34?! experienced better less      The only thing redeems Aria's buffet fact sliced crab legs you  Other that   nothing  Maybe creme brulee but dessert selection horrible  No macarons   $35 no macarons? Really? Bread pudding looked dry heard gelato no good    Initially nigiri sushi section but when seconds only California rolls other cheap rolls  prime rib good  naan vegetable masala both good but eat stuff Indian buffet 8 bucks  Didn't much variety Mexican Italian Asian stations    I really excited try buffet since top hotels casino Vegas but very let down  Also service horrible  never once refill ice tea couldn't even find waitress ask   Oh also huge party least 40 people so  person organizing spoken them previously reservation 6pm would only give 2 hours eat charged 20% gratuity  Then totally forgot reservation whole crowd just stood outside good 30 minutes them clear tables us  Um thanks  20% gratuity? buffet!  15% 18% understand  mentioned before service sucked    Not impressed all  M resort Wynn way better  haven't Belagio awhile can't compare that    Go elsewhere really worth $35  <EOR> Two thumbs up! The best buffet Christmas Vegas  Very tasty food which made feel cook's effort inside out  Snow crab legs king crab legs best   Plus service great  <EOR> Food quality just poor  No flavor temp food  Luke warm  Better buffet places also overpriced  <EOR> I tried variety dishes different stations none which well prepared  Pork Bun dried leathery meats over salted Asian dishes bland lamb stew more bones meat  desserts only highlight  Certainly worth $50 price tag which doesn't include cocktail   <EOR> Unfassbar vielseitiges und gutes Frühstücks Buffet! Mit 21 $ pro Person nicht gerade ein Schnäppchen aber definitiv jeden Cent wert  Die Nutella Pancakes sind ein Highlight   für jeden dabei  <EOR> Went Wednesday breakfast before flying since staying Vdara  $43 2 people   coffee good service 4 stars but food overall subpar   All hot food buffet line lukewarm best  scrambled eggs seriously undercooked omelet station used carton scrambled eggs fresh eggs   shame such beautiful property such Aria such mediocre buffet  <EOR> For another city restaurant might higher rating but compared other buffets Las Vegas Buffet Aria doesn't match up  Especially compared Bellagio next door same price lunch dinner Bellagio wins without doubt   The main reason oysters half shell but beware oysters unfresh dessicated such strong fishy taste unable swallow them  Also looked if no touched them ice which made them more unfresh  sushi palatable though suspect Aria does hire real sashimi chef sashimi being unevenly cut    The prime rib flank steak good although seasoned particularly well meet standard already set Bellagio  newcomer block Aria does case itself Bellagio does better job much more selection same cost  Aria buffet resembles cafeteria interior somewhat claustrophobic   The saving grace buffet beautiful presentation its desserts could worth if dessert fan although selection definitely less varied Bellagio    All all Aria digestible apart oysters but cannot compete competitive buffet scene Las Vegas  <EOR> Sometimes buffet isn't just food    fact food very good    But paid $75 brunch two one bloody mary added price little     crowded seating area  and really really crowded omlette station   It maybe $45 experience  <EOR> Surprisingly good! did expect buffet Aria great  Highly recommend snow crab prime rib  desserts also great! Bellagio today found Aria actually better! <EOR> Been many times would give 3 star but today worst experience ever food taste bad seafood fresh sushi without fish only veggies no prime rib many choice  literally nothing eat  Very very disappointed  <EOR> 1st buffet Vegas very shocked   wide selection food drinks reasonable price   Make sure hungry endless possibilities  <EOR> Good bufet la comida es buena aunque no tan variada como otros buffet el lugar es bonito recomendable <EOR> Now then last place thought you'd ever see well Las Vegas itself all eat buffet  Ironic may sound actually because portions everywhere else un appetisingly enormous well except Picasso bellagio see sep review just somewhere where could put nice normal portion plates eat rather plate food would feed family five week  We holding much hope  say very pleasantly surprised! value money exceptional around £12 15 really decent standard food well cooked boot   The selection offer ranged sushi roasts french Indian all pretty authentically cooked a bit revelation vegas!   having day off booze cannot comment wine but wine inclusive deal very reasonable  The surroundings pleasant selection food utterly enourmous many people  Probably most decent meal ate Vegas all all  must very heavily subsidised casino fairly new modern 5 star think need people casino  Yes I'd recommend plce can't believe recommending all eat buffet but hand them!   <EOR> I Thanksgiving day dinner  price $53 99  food variety more expected  seafood fresh esp king crab legs  baked oyster highly recommend  saw pan roast lot people ordered it  haven't tried but looks good  hubby loves lamb  Also dessert bar good but ice cream  waitress nice always notify wanted  She also cleaned plates fast  <EOR> My first time WAY better  guess things change worse over time    Seriously buffet doesn't ham? thought requirement Vegas buffets  When came first time delicious honey baked ham coconut macaroon dessert! best macaroons ever had  Now only thing prime rib  even great  $40 per person expected more  mean asking fireworks but least put some more effort into did before  VERY disappointed  <EOR> The food selection 5star selection  limited  Yes unlimited crab legs great but some food COLD! paella cold steak cold pizza cold very small selection antipasti  additional unlimited drinks great sweets section  wont come back again  <EOR> I just dinner buffet last week  first time tried Aria buffet  prime rib salmon weren't good  actually served prime rib courteous ended complaining manager that  saw chef cooking piece prime rib another customer but reluctant husband  felt service wasn't consistent impolite while requesting nicely complain manager  understand buffet steak house but service still matter regardless kind cuisine restaurant serving   big minus us  manager very nice help prime rib grilled  prime rib grilled because don't eat rare medium rare meat prime rib most medium rare time eating there  think compensated being charged 1 person instead 2 due unpleasant experience  well resolved way   The desserts great though regardless unpleasant experience prime rib chef  desserts great lot them  buffet description said desserts Jean Philippe Patisserie  ate alot desserts seemed Jean Philippe Patisserie but really couldn't tell which which wasn't    Anyway good least try once see if wanna again  probably might again full price  dessert but think would rather just them Jean Philippe Patisserie downstairs probably cost less way still satisfy craving Jean Philippe Patisserie desserts  <EOR> It seems lot people unimpressed buffet came little expectations but came away pleasantly surprised  During trip vegas buffets M Aria Planet Hollywood surprisingly favorite  While isn't perfect long selective eat believe pleasant dining experience  came lunch while $20 isn't cheap easily money's worth stuffing myself crab legs jumbo shrimp raw shellfish  prime rib best among 3 buffets although wasn't saying much none good prime rib even average sit down restaurant   Pizza which most buffets doesn't even look food actually looked edible though didn't try it  asian food entirely forgettable but again don't buffets eat those kinds things They also excellent selection desserts which nicely presented  Most desserts good but avoid fruity sauce thats side cakes because they're way sweet   Perhaps thing stood most place service  very thirsty day downing coke every 5 10 mintues but never more couple minutes without drink before waiter came refilled drinks  He also cleared plates great efficiency every time more food dirty plates all gone time back  also loved no wait well  Some people would interpret mean buffet no good but cmon any buffet really worth standing hour line for?   Probably weakest aspect buffet would design decor place  buffet bit small side occasionally difficult navigate past people different stations  custom salad station where your salad order put seafood section front which caused unnecessary bottleneck  overall design buffet fairly plain well although some window seats   I understand why people came dinner would underwhelmed assuming food mostly same  probably would hesitant come dinner but lunch place worth it  <EOR> Really good much better Monte Carlo! <EOR> Great food  Plenty options!  Good service although slow times Their sandwiches Mac n cheese faves!  For 23 99$ per person lunch great deal! <EOR> Went breakfast since came booking   Waited 25 minutes which excessive   much selection though   layout nice but much substance   Eggs benedict wasn't great but server super nice   She clearing refills way very friendly <EOR> If want mediocre buffet you  would eat again prime buffet and big buffets would Cesar Palace gold standard buffets time writing review    Aria nice atmosphere good music bright lights few choices decent wait staff but food leaves much desired  few options tried were prime rib chicken crab legs fish chips caprese salad many others  desert side tried butter scotch mini dessert ice cream pane cotta few others  Maybe bad in opinion because ate late 9 30ish but even dinning room packed food mediocre best  ordered regular tea Wife rasberry tea which she said good   interesting thing alcohol special advertised $12 99 endless selection wine beer etc bad deal vegas    We back  <EOR> You would think being newest resorts Las Vegas smack middle all action Buffet Aria would top notch   Any but!

Most them pretty meatless but hey they're still pretty expensive its totally worth it  Everything came small bowls already perfectly portioned controlled could leave room your stomach everything else! The dessert section probably best thing here  beautiful displayed desserts rotating gelato stand  many different flavors choose from!  Another gripe pay parking ARIA  When most hotels offer free parking customers want casino eat many restaurants hotel appealing way attract customers    Overall pretty average Vegas buffet quality pricing  think trying much  much giving customers variety giving quality  Definitely come crab legs gelato  <EOR> This place IMO REALLY GOOD!  I came dinner friends Friday wasn't really packed all   found unlimited wine paid which $40 just any other buffet place Vegas prob cheaper    definitely worth it!  all kinds food Italian Indian American Asian   list felt on   Again am dessert kind guy but wow thing remembered most dessert    sadly know    strawberry shortcake   OUT WORLD! flaky delicious   Wasn't super sweet most places   Just RIGHT!

First time couple months ago  I dining credits decided take mum meal  most memorable curry tri tip   mmm    Recent experience    ECK!  This time two comped buffets came room   We brunch found bug noodle salad!! Although tiny   BUG little wings legs!   So notified server he supposedly turn notified manager chefs throw dish out    About 10 minutes pass server came back tell dish thrown out  OK    Now sitting disgusted appetite ran 1000 miles away only 1 2 dish into buffet waited expecting manager come apologize very least  Nope    We ask speak manager server responded want see manager? problem? LITTLE bug? making tiny gesture thumb forefinger  YES PROBLEM! Just because didn't technically pay brunch because comped doesn't mean don't want refund meal didn't eat! Thinking people paid $25 brunch treated poorly  They no reason believe buffet comped since charged room   all know paying it So politely although agitated said Yes would see your manager yes because LITTLE bug   seriously am only granted apology manager if bug over inch big rule??!!   Another 10 minutes pass server returns manager totally ignores speaks server right in front table bug? trash? Did see bug? bug? TINY bug? dish on? sure so and so saw it? WOW!  1 thought he showed manager 20 minutes ago when he took napkin which noodle piece where bug rested   2 said wanted speak manager actions she no intention speaking me!   I interrupt little banter whether telling truth trying scam them $25 worth bacon eggs  She doesn't even ask wanted speak reaches receipt table  She then says don't know do  hour since started your meal Yeah spent 40 minutes waiting your slow ass!!   But also said reluctantly ok issue refund your meals  ONE    Although both only half dish into buffet both lost appetites now only due little pesky bug unfortunately notice blindly ingest manager would rathered  She would issue refund meal because apparently companion hunger finished noodles before saw bug mine would appetite continue meal    I pointed both lost appetites hardly hate 1 2 plate anything she blankly said no she'll only refund walked away process it  She came back placed receipt back table refunded back your room turned walked off    In examining receipt     she refunded full amount! WTF       Whatever    stood walked name cashier  Dree    Honestly bad buffet  serve snow crab legs brunch lunch king crab legs multiple meats dinner  Just pray won't deal nonexistent customer service!!   Verdict Only dinner   gourmet dinner also comes 1 2 lobster tail Bringing magnifying spectacles seriously    never comfortable meal ever again <EOR> Was underwhelmed  ate twice while staying Aria only reason second time because food credit  Wouldn't recommend enemy  Most food wasn't correct serving temperature some items tasted cooked some synthetic oil variety left much desired! <EOR> There 3 Sunday dinner  wasn't long line took few minutes someone come take drink orders but service fast pleasant good  couldn't eat Gluten blackboard menus each station showing gluten free items nice touch  However she said weren't any special gluten free dishes all could eat almost anywhere except pizza    For other friend myself sushi fish dishes good but outstanding  thought Chicken Parmesan very good both loved baby beets lamb mint jelly   Desserts ok pistachio ice cream hit all three us  tax tip cost all 3 just shy $150  decided bit steep perhaps brunch weekday dinner if neighborhood  cost I'd rather Wynn   Bottom line just acceptable <EOR> Slightly above avg food quality   serve raw oysters which looking for  Overall Presentation nice but no Wicked Spoon which way better regard   Service slow even though wasn't crowded since near close   Buffet's fault but Beware rude fellow customers can't wait turns line food instead grab neighboring tongs crowd out   cool people  <EOR> Sehr empfehlenswert! Frühstücksbuffet lässt keine Wünsche offen abends ebenso  Wir waren 5 Tage Las Vegas und haben jeden Morgen das leckere Angebot genossen         unglaublich es alles gibt  Sehr viel asiatische Küche aber auch italienisch amerikanisch  Äußerst freundliches Personal  Preis Leistungsverhältnis ist vollkommen i O  <EOR> I guess 3 half stars right  enjoyed food but pricey  came Vegas starving buffet since staying Aria  Dinner Saturday night $35 per person  Ouch!  They did lobster which told isn't served most buffets since lobster 10 bucks per tail could see why people loading lobster getting 3 4 plate    For buffet decent selection meats prime rib steak roasted pig chicken etcetera  No ham   pork chops well but can't remember made    They good selection seafood pastas desserts Aria buffet seems strive quality over quantity but think most buffets similar items  items Aria slightly better but never buffets desserts creme brulee creme brulee no matter where go  desserts look pretty come own plates decent selection   The oddest thing restaurant actually shakes  all thought because all long flight starving all day  But seems sound system isn't setup right forgot install some insulation when built place  actually felt eating during mild earthquake around 3 0 Richter scale Californians     Service slow  server nice but could tell she really busy despite fact arrived really early dinner 4pm place packed  took awhile before she could back table refills clear plates  opinion need hire more servers because can't handle load moment    To summarize liked food alot but pricier most buffets could better deals elsewhere  <EOR> I wouldn't say bad wouldn't say over top  brunch buffet pretty decent  Food did taste average  think myself expecting large selection  Maybe dinner might deliver  back try it  <EOR> Sunday champagne brunch nothing spectacular but quality exceptional  many other amazing choices town locals probably return  <EOR> The Aria Buffet actually REALLY GOOD  use quality ingredients offerings definitely suffer steam table syndrome  also some curry dishes which quite tasty  lunch pricing more relaxed $26 99 plenty choices keep busy   Service A+ right ball  never waited dishes cleared beverages always full   I am fan Arnold Schwart says back ! <EOR> Let William carve something nice  He lets sample anything carvery smile bit humor  Then talk Adriana pastry shop  Great recommendations smile  Staff surprisingly kind passionate service  <EOR> Used BOGO Lunch almost $40 quite expensive but certainly best meal while Vegas   huge buffet but food all amazing   Everything tried delightful!

Really really good flavor perfect along Nann Biryan rice   The dessert good lots gelato flavors  Carrot cake good Overall memorable enough  want return future visits Vegas also next time sure stomach full Fat Tuesday slurpy right before coming lol think could enjoyed more lol <EOR> If best describe Aria real estate would frigid fortress modern industrial lines   surmise its open floor plan buffet dining room aptly designed resembling mid sized Silicon Valley tech company cafeteria strip mall's Todai   compliment   The food mirrors aesthetic nothing stands out   Everything rigidly assembled without any artful flair similar lesser off strip buffets   seafood meat selections dry while salad bar just average   made exponentially worse fact buffet items limited     The stand out section however dessert bar gelato   Though half pickings highly flawed inedible other half may satisfy your sweet tooth some extent     Though only twice must say wait bus staff friendly  but unfortunately understaffed fully attentive  <EOR> The food great price  $26 person lunch but unlimited smoked salmon crab legs peppered shrimp gelato other goodies  entrée selections may pale compared other buffets but dessert selection hard beat  assortment cakes cookies ice cream price almost worthwhile  $5 small cup gelato outside but unlimited amounts buffet  Three scoops already $15! sushi selections meh   great  Basically Asian food gonna great  pizza tasted alright though!   The service pretty nice  few problems server weekend though  asked OJ she forgot  asked again she gave grapefruit juice  bitter but  sort expected since its fresh  asked coffee she forgot again  Personally think she attending many tables she forgets people ask for  1 star that   Personally would give 3star rating price quality ratio but Vegas  hard find great cheap food would normally find LA  tried many buffets city but seems stand rest  <EOR> HIGHLY disappointed! such beautiful hotel casino thinking food would top notch  $50 dinner buffet food disappointing  Example cold dry chicken pizza hard only 2 sushi items choose prime rib fatty chewy overall food selection very good IMO  definitely Mirage buffet next time  better selection food better quality  <EOR> Not sure happened buffet used good but now blahhhh      <EOR> Wonderful dessert crab legs   Nothing else say don't want bother myself getting dessert right now  Yum  <EOR> Consider fan    always stopped once per LV trip brunch dinner   Never disappoints  <EOR> After being charged $77 some odd cents 4th July weekend pricing lunch menu wife disappointed over all experience  seen more selection tasted better food elsewhere  top off told server seated section when asked refill iced tea having empty glasses 20 minutes  Wont come back again sure  <EOR> I don't know restaurant 3 stars but enjoyed food very much  love different ethnicity varieties food here  definitely did order unlimited drinks also did drink enough myself buzz food good definitely come back when back Vegas  reason didn't give 5 stars because when first seated waitress came take drinks order she asked ID confused since check already show IDs wristband it  only issue but didn't big deal  <EOR> I'm glad didn't pay  free buffet stay  Good selection food but most food average  Ambiance lacking big time!!  gave  husband hard time wearing t shirt  Turns pretty casual  much higher expectations Aria buffet was thinking previous visit Bellagio buffet   Service while came through end chaotic lacking start  won't going back  <EOR> Talk foreshadowing anytime see short empty buffet line Las Vegas should beware  buffet Aria average  unimpressive thought would buffet equal other 5 star hotels Bellagio Wynn    In terms variety felt aria buffet tried accomplish offering number different international cuisines such indian chinese japanese etc  However still felt WITHIN each cuisine just wasn't much  example sure japanese food but specifically only 3 types rolls some nigiri  No other types sashimi no unique rolls no tempura etc etc   In terms seafood usual king crab legs shrimp scampi oysters but wasn't any different would find any other decent buffet   In terms serve food little strange food smallerl serving plates  While may give impression dishes more fresh replenished more frequently also causes inconvenience customer when dishes constantly running staff members refill it  means customers waste more time waiting food eating it   On more positive note service excellent  strange just because no really notices service remembers waiter buffet but mine good certainly did remember  She always refilling drinks asking if needed anything never late clearing used plates    Overall if choice buffets Las Vegas would still opt Bellagio Wynn  price Aria similar other upscale hotel buffets 40 dinner simply doesnt satisfy terms variety taste  <EOR> when called New Year's Day buffet person answered phone  very uninterested answering questions sounded overworked did care but through that  when line paying cashier she piece candy mouth while she taking money when asked question she speak around whatever mouth  food great would only put two ticks below M Buffet  bartender Derek very attentive personable  There four all you can drink which came just little under $200  probably visit again but before visit M Buffet sorry   This first time buffet Aria January 1st 2018 12 30 p m  <EOR> Just came back week Vegas little buffeted but goes  remembered going buffet when first opened handful years ago thought fantastic worth $50 paid Easter Sunday  However apparently renovated buffet half size less choices fancy  wife 2 for 1 coupon worth but wouldn't pay full price  far items Italian section poor spaghetti meatballs chicken marsala antipasta  Carving board quite good four different types meat mostly beef  sushi eh  Mussels great escpecially new zealand mussels  Most everything average  Deserts OK  Waitress service very good always filled drink  would probably give 3 1 2 stars but cant  2 for 1 place but full price  <EOR> The foods cold fresh really disappointed worth all price  Dont eat place 8pm ate couple times 8 pm food taste nasty really embarrassing because brought guesses if country <EOR> Good solid place enjoy while taking break gambling  Ok food nice atmosphere medium high price  <EOR> We Lunch Buffet Sunday  fantastic selection high quality fresh items including Alaskan King Crab Legs Roast Turkey Leg Lamb name few The highlight would desserts which equivalent those would find any good fine dining establishment  Would given them higher rating if admission more reasonably priced  <EOR> Went  Monday morning  hostess name tag said Betty first paid no attention first  waved she told wait line pay first without realized wife standing behind hold receipts  She gave no greeting smile eye contact us  When told paid stayed skysuite Noir card she rolled eyes waved another hostess sit us  cheap buffet  5 diamonds resort  Unacceptable service  Positive side overall food good  <EOR> This located Aria    I liked Buffet quite bit  am comparing other buffets had  used come Vegas fabulous buffets 99 cent shrimp cocktails free drinks tables  Well least drinks still theoretically free haha  Now no comes just buffets but rather 5 star chefs restaurants located many ritzy hotels!

Worth money <EOR> I really looking forward enjoying Las Vegas buffet experience but let down buffet Aria  visited breakfast Memorial Day surprised extra cost just breakfast which called brunch holiday  feels tricked into eating overpriced buffet $37 per person when expecting $20  French toast sticks cold smell seafood early morning nauseating    Wish better  Finished meal scoop gelato delicious!   If you're looking breakfast Aria order al la carte somewhere else  Cheaper probably warmer food  <EOR> I Vegas recently checked buffet twice   first time Sunday Brunch I Highly Recommend    red velvet cake pancakes they unreal so awesome   carrot cake pancakes delicious prime rib ten different flavors ice cream blueberry blintzes  I could on It crazy!!  also breakfast morning regular weekday   still great but no prime rib  Brunch do Sunday Brunch!! <EOR> I love love loveddd food everyone said alot veriety tonss different options! am returning May try lunch breaky!! raspbery lemonade made day!!  think remember paying $ 35 00 per person  way always come backk!! <EOR> Mediocre best   Gave 3 tries  Won't come back  Most hot dish platters looked sitting ages  <EOR> While checking Crystals new City Center BFF couldn't decide eat decided buffet it  Before deciding staying asked very friendly cashier if could view buffet  kindly obliged  skimmed way down buffet crab legs shrimp prime rib pizza chinese food oooo dessert! crab legs dessert = They all basic offering most buffets but felt pretty nice variety meats carving stations Prime Rib Ham Chicken Turkey Lamb think Bison? good variety definitely silenced hunger  couple favorites sauteed red snapper szechwan beef dessert bar!

NOPE  sure MGM's buffet better    SAD know  <EOR> I buffet five friends all enjoyed buffet   Although wasn't big other buffets Strip food tasted really good   especially enjoyed crab ribs carrots asparagus   happy crab warm instead cold many other buffets   gelato creamy delicious too! <EOR> This first buffet Vegas  decor modern beautiful sleek just everything Aria  Food ok though  paid  $35 per person before tip  food disappointing  crab claws ok felt sat awhile wasn't refilled enough  shrimp cocktail two big shrimps small shot glass pretty presentation good since size shrimp big  Everything else cold  dessert impressed  flan ok  waitress just ok wait awhile drinks  Btw pay first then seated  cashier asked if wanted unlimited alcohol $12 99 based saw declined  When seated more details drinks unbeknownst wanted order that  waitress said because didn't order beginning would cost extra $1 what's that? buffet cheap  time she came around full didn't want order any drinks  Would back again  Ceasar's buffet more expensive but totally worth it! <EOR> Last week sampled buffets both Aria Bellagio  sure some disagree but trying both I'd opt Aria  generally hate buffets   Variety pretty good both but thought whole food Aria much better just everything  tried lot different flavors Mediterranean Latin Tandoori Italian Asian  Everything really tasty here  Fish Market some really outstanding whitefish    The only thing came away bit disappointed Asian  really looking forward but came short here  Generally bland dim sum rice stir fry  need little work part world but even think I'd back lunch  <EOR> We came lunch  Food good  Its better hotel eat Mcdonalds  gourmet dinner during weekends may much better  <EOR> Great selection good  Food cooked displayed well  Good lighting good music playing  would definitely come back   only complaint took 7 10 minutes put order regular drinks  Outside good experience  <EOR> We Aria buffet few times before today wow did DISSAPOINT!!! Food AWESOME including amazingly authentic menudo but today service star show! Alicia sever although service usually key part buffet today most certainly was  Food incredible  <EOR> Had early dinner Saturday night  $86 two people  Did off good start  Seems wrong line pay prior being seated barked staff member stay behind sign  Once seated wait 15 mins before drink order taken  Waitress really nice working full pace but clearly enough staff on  Food fine number different types Italian Carvery Chinese Indian Mexican etc  some staff serving meals  pasta Carvery sections very grumpy indeed  Overall very mediocre experience  <EOR> I came dinner friends Saturday night price buffet gourmet dinner increased $39 99 pp  offer bottomless mimosas select drinks $13 pp unfortunately didn't plan very long opted offer    The selection okay much would wanted price  offer wide range seafood though including snow crab king crab  seafood lovers definitely your money's worth if focus consuming your omega 3's  desserts looked lot better tasted unfortunately  did enjoy thai tea gelato though   The service great    I would easily return cheaper brunch lunch options  But dinner option? would rather take $40+ elsewhere  <EOR> Overwhelming quantity underwhelming quality  Good variety  Definitely worth 50 bucks <EOR> This definitely top 10 buffets Vegas  Sunday brunch fantastic  t's only $29 brunch additional $12 unlimited cocktails beer wine champagne  Anything could possibly want eat you  really enjoyed crab legs dumplings extensive carving station  If plan buffet Vegas good try  line short too! <EOR> Considering buffet other hotel stayed pretty horrible sadly way better  Yet   worth price  First off place empty seated far back  Even waiter made comment  food sitting wayyyy long guys!! Cheese chunks should dried outside potstickers shouldn't hardened  meat station pretty good but salad station didn't seem fresh lackluster  think disadvantage both customers restaurant when things slow  When things slow food stays long therefore isn't getting refreshed  But really feel $47 tip person pretty ridiculous  gotten expensive eat Las Vegas should least feel you're getting your moneys worth  wish could received partial refund honest  <EOR> I'm huge fan buffets realize challenge present terms keeping food fresh high quality  buffet favorite visually impressive some others but food decent husband liked more Wicked Spoon   Pros wide selection good flow clean great service awesome selection desserts    The waitress made special effort write birthday boy's name plate desserts she brought along candle song other employees  Because buffet setting she hard time catching when he wasn't buffet but she persistent appreciated! Wicked Spoon just brought over plate desserts  <EOR> We stayed Aria didn't take time check Yelp  Could saved bunch money! Breakfast buffet $27 per person during week $37 weekends  only wanted breakfast foods buffet serves foods would eat breakfast lunch dinner  amount money food should hot time returns table but between barely warm room temperature  last day Denny's GrandSlam under $5  could kick myself wouldn't again  <EOR> We came ready give Aria Buffet 5 star based fantastic experience staying dining Aria last year but disappointments disappointments taste buds unforgiving   For starters holiday brunch buffet first foremost enjoyed wait staff  Friendly service some holiday humor always welcomed   Now why 3 stars? Its tough being buffet culturally diverse but biggest offender towards food freshness each selection  Some examples stale burnt stiff waffles cold chicken incredibly soggy dimsum curry overcooked where potato made more mashy curry stale nan pho   just forget it   Secondly please invest some time into putting correct signs dish  Also signs says etm_009 crab legs does tell much  Some people may come promise cultural diverse meal but won't mean anything if don't know they're eating   However wait staff amazing  waiter made sure table always clean cups filled  staff dessert station even more awesome accommodated request torch creme brulee which way all difference   A year ago buffet worth trying we'd recommendations friends  However now? I'd say save your belly real estate another buffet  3 star verdict average between 5 star last year 1 star year   <EOR> I'm type person likes quantity over quality while boyfriend prefers quality over quantity  jump between Carnival World Buffet Rio Bacchanal Caesar's  But then discovered Buffet Aria just found new favorite place eat   We brunch day Thanksgiving no line BIG plus  still new place separated enough casino cigarette smoke doesn't reach a bigger plus those hate constant cloud   restaurant beautiful airy attention tiniest detail even cups serve juice in   FOOD FOOD FOOD  good selection most pretty high quality if avoid Asia section  keep supplies fresh well stocked enjoyed watching chef pancakes big car tires  boyfriend could over good breakfast items were  personally am big dessert fan but several helpings cake pie  sweet just right size allow try all selections   The waitress super nice even though she busy she made effort swing around check when she chance good service too   It bit pricey side but would say well worth it  <EOR> I'm no newbie when comes Vegas buffets traversed Caesar's Buffet Buffets twice  But Aria's best! day visited Bacchanal dinner spent whole time wishing half good Aria  I spent embarrassing amount time playing accumulating reward points MyVegas game redeemed some bogo offer breakfast lunch buffet    My boyfriend arrived around 10 15am Thursday  5 minute wait  opted unlimited beverages choices included beer mimosas bloody Mary's sangria cranberry spritzer etc  much nicer Bacchanal where stick drink!   waitress super friendly best service all trip most importantly kept drinks rolling!

Pro tip if Visa Signature card book your stay Aria free breakfast buffets 2 every day <EOR> Creme brulee 11am  Yes   I really pleased Aria Buffet whole  Sunday morning line wasn't ridiculous seated within 10 minutes walking up  presentation chicken waffles beautiful  little fry basket lined paper mini waffles chicken tenders nuggets inside  Perfectly portioned cute boot  Did mention dessert station?  Minus star some food looking needed stirred  Also person responsible writing food names signs needs English class desperately   Maybe purposeful but don't think so  <EOR> The buffet nothing talk about  There's lot good food expensive  Just because new hotel doesn't mean price should above most places  Definitely experienced better buffets other hotels  <EOR> Occasion Brunch MCT friends   What Had Weekend Brunch $41 total Food Review unimpressed  am convinced $41 price tag mostly due premium avoid wait  $35 before tax buffet Wynn trumped Aria long shot  asian food gross chow mein salty dumplings strangely chewy rubbery edges fried rice much soy sauce  breakfast food average  sushi maybe TroGro level sushi similar Safeway sushi  disappointed breakfast burrito well which saturated hot sauce couldn't taste any components egg sausage    I say desserts solely terms taste most part just good buffet Wynn  strawberry cheesecake white chocolate delish    Service Review Self serve    Venue Review Although no line whatsoever plenty seating chairs booths buffet least half size or maybe even third quarter size! buffet Wynn  also didn't much unique selection e g  buffet Wynn croquettes other cool normally high value items     Overall Impression Unsatisfactory!

Honestly must try  I personally came seafood didn't disappoint  crab legs point kept coming fresh batch fresh batch   their salads perfectly seasoned meats cooked perfection  A very good surprise seeing bone marrow dish  exaggerating when say husband must dozen them  crisp bread comes perfect  The service good drinks never empty  I wish I'd tried alot other dishes but just couldn't stop these! <EOR> We Aria buffet before really enjoyed it  However time terrible  Everything seemed really salty food good all  Last time ceviche really good sushi but time around barely anything wanted eat    I'm editing review  since management able take care it  customer service great  <EOR> Nothing special but nothing terrible either  worth complaining when comped but would literally NEVER pay sticker price   If Prime Rib Beef Brisket won't leave hungry although buffet  saying much    Some times crab legs awesome but most time just look absolute garbage  Same Pizza  used greatest pesto pizza ever but since remodel which real shame   The overarching theme buffet probably unrealized potential  lot food would really good if made order but unfortunately just ton everything leave sit soggy burnt otherwise great gross   The sushi example made using good fish then put tray covered plastic wrap left sit fridge until rice hard just garbage  Same burritos asian food  lot issues would solved think if just made smaller portions more often   The guacamole mashed potatoes prime rib basically anything quality doesn't downhill when sits all amazing  Anything where quality degrades though expect disgusting   I just think place funny because definitely potential 5 star buffet but seem pretty content very mediocre  <EOR> This favorite buffet strip  wait always long but worth it  love seafood station meat cheese station  honestly much choose hard decide  layout decor also very nice  keep coming back because many quality options really worth money  <EOR> My husband came early dinner work   buffet looks really nice SEEMED clean  lets blow blow Price kinda expensive $74 2 Waitress server RUDE all hell!

Would definitely come back  Oh! if play Vegas slots free buffets family each dinner buffets free! But still would come back even if wasn't free <EOR> Considering price all buffets mostly same give 4 star  price pretty cheap compared other buffet places food isn't bad  during breakfast lunch chance try both  omelet station during both b l time  Carving station combination beef sausages ham etc  Freshly made naan bread salad chinese food others  came corned beef hash expectation getting canned ones    but surprise made REAL corned beef  Definitely worth price but service picking plates little slow  <EOR> I high hopes ARIA buffet being 5 star hotel    but absolutely terrible  There's nothing good here  Everything tasted bland except mac n cheese which ate 2 plates because nothing else good  sushi roll offerings limited even california roll there    seafood chinese food sucks  fish tacos bad well  could've least offered some fries but didn't even that    don't come here  <EOR> I broke rule number 1 getting bang buck buffet didn't full walk around before getting plate! $35 Saturday brunch buffet Aria  Over looking expansive pool area dinning room filled light plenty space amazing 80's music buzzing softly back ground  might Hall Oates' fault broke rule number hearing Kiss List feet where moving trajectory food  hadn't even waited drink order before loading plate King Crab legs and small bowl clarified butter ! least smart enough set legs table return fresh plate   Amazingly juicy steak fresh thick cuts smoked bacon omelet bar shrimp bar benedicts bacon banana bread oh my! plate already teetering precariously precipice spicy house potatoes could only stare awe walked past second half buffet YES whole other half !! Several different scrambles bacon sausages gravies another omelet bar entire lunch section asian inspired dishes including chicken congee!!! didn't manage everything wanted but tasted mostly everything!  All food good solid sometimes actually stellar way above par ANY buffet Vegas  hash brown balls die for  table already loaded flutes champagne Domain St  Michelle    not bad all U Drink champagne!! ! small containers OJ if wanted mix And did ! waitress AMAZING witty funny fast  drinks never stopped flowing stayed OVER TWO HOURS!! needed sit pool nap afterward! ate $35 then twice much  new default brunch spot Vegas  FULL STOP! <EOR> The food great  would suggest small portions try little everything  wait staff very nice cooks very engaging   The wait time different story  why gave three stars  made no sense wait hour pay another 15 minutes seated  Only directed table find droves sections empty  <EOR> Hundreds feet food but single green vegetable outside salad  came expecting top buffets disappointed find average best over priced  crab fresh  ethnic food bland  very nice dessert section  But par Wynn even Planet Hollywood Paris buffets    long walk there  <EOR> Really impressed all  waiting twenty minutes table when half them empty apparently trying open section something? sat down waited drinks  Ten minutes later having seen waitress decided food figured would order drinks when back  finishing first plate asked hostesses if she could send waiter waitress over drinks ourselves other three tables around still waiting that    She could polite  Instead she literally told being impatient no water any other drinks 20 25 minutes basically told sit down quiet they'd drinks when ready to    We should left then asked refund  manager did very little help though she did say she would talk staff see happened  drinks more half hour being seated table food mediocre best  also upset stomach afternoon only thing I'd eaten since day before    I only rated two stars because food so so but pretty bland entire experience worth it  wouldn't back staff's rudeness made certain Aria see another dollar wallet  <EOR> On whirlwind tour buffets Las Vegas came past weekend try brunch buffet Saturday   fifteen minute wait 11 a m  which thought little surprising     After having gone Bachannal dinner night before wasn't sure stomach would able handle another buffet but often think brunch way some people think desserts deserves its own stomach!  There's lot selection here   $30 per person and additional $12 bottomless drinks I'd say decent deal Vegas buffet   skipped over most Asian food since looked mostly reheated frozen stuff helped myself lot other things   There's much name but let hit some highlights amazing breakfast pizza yummy pre made waffles different fillings try banana decent corned beef hash your own made to order eggs benedict bar variety refreshing pre made salads interesting assortment Indian foods including naan curried veggies meats etc   also made to order eggs omelette station   ham carving station delicious lean but tender flavorful prime rib if  your fancy   other words there's something everyone here!  There some foods weren't great   felt much more common dessert department   example donut tasted crusty dry lot cakes tasted they'd sitting while   probably wouldn't omelette again they're far big don't don't wrap ingredients inside but instead intersperse them throughout egg batter   Service Can't compare service Bachannal   seem understaffed even though restaurant wasn't full capacity exert some energy flag someone down   Bottom line decent option brunch buffet Vegas   am realizing forgot try gelato next time    <EOR> So high expectations a $80 00 credit doesn't hurt either! It reminded cafeteria people cutting line crab legs food sitting warmers looking hours mean ambiance ok but something missing if pay own pocket would very upset  The food very generic nothing special Bellagio Buffet which hear best!  The folks Aria need put heads together reinvent buffet could much better! <EOR> i try any buffet strip know serve crab  first time aria  price higher end but same price any 5 star hotel buffet really  both warm cold which plus since rather warm  most places only serve cold  tried little everything but stuck main dish  <EOR> I did comparison ARIA Bellagio Mirage buffets   quick   Pick ARIA best choice far wont wait forever line  <EOR> it turns Coke machine broken but didn't tell until paid $120 sat   Waiter said table well want it? Gee maybe bring cans? no soda  Very very slow waiter management response   Many people asking waters still waterless even second plate buffet  Many tables bussed during entire meal   Poor service marred otherwise outstanding buffet choices  <EOR> Just great evening topped things off Aria buffet  $86 46 two dinner time  food excellent   Try prime rib die sure why Butta every buffet look clam chowder try  hit  thing wrong round <EOR> I gluten allergy place amazing those sensitive celiac! chef wonderful he walked around told could almost anything even amazing sweets!

We explained cashier told could change minds waiter again insisted the rule would no exceptions   No exceptions  phrase uttered six times next 20 minutes We protested until became uncomfortable then asked manager   Again just wanted switch drink order Bloody Mary champagne   The manager arrived told many people want switch allowed  explained cashier told could  she insisted couldn't    We table 8 became uncomfortable many friends said ok   we'll just Bloody Mary  Or champagne  some level everyone just wanted keep peace    I informed woman she very poor manager because while understood no switch rule she should stand employee's word  The cashier said could switch! Her retort cashier's part time employees didn't know taking she wouldn't honor word   In end uncomfortable lengthy confrontation manager let person switch and warned she couldn't switch back  ridiculous unacceptable behavior manager shocked  Aria should ashamed  <EOR> I enough comps decided try brunch buffet Sunday   cost $24 95 brunch   Champagne other cocktails extra   eating area reminded cafeteria   wan't expecting fancy setting but hotel Aria's caliber expected more   Even though only 8 00 morning all stations stocked   started breakfast foods eggs bacon sausages   looking omlette station but located next breakfast foods the       Then tried crab legs which chilled   snow crab legs halved   more difficult extract meat expected what's worse salty   Other food groups including smattering Chinese offerings all looked pretty unappetizing   I usually great appetite but stopped serving   In summary truly mediocre disappointing effort Aria   am sure if would try even if comped again <EOR> Typical Vegas big resort buffet    everything expected    Nice amount seafood offerings    Good variety stations    Dessert sort boring except ice cream station hand dipped    Plenty seating clean     Late dinner Friday night 9pm wasn't crowded all  <EOR> Now impressive buffet  Some friends introduced lunchtime disappointed even though pricey  many varieties food well prepared great presentation  offered seafood lunch also  ramen bar world  meat cuts succulent cooked desire  Asian section alone would keep coming back  desserts amazing  décor really cool people friendly  If seafood fan give try  <EOR> We stopped Buffet ARIA based recommendation definitely pleased! brunch $29 99 +tax tip happy find little bit everyone!

Really? guys buffet snobs know better ones telling me? Because honestly eat want know  M list   any others? Seriously only eat Vegas need more do   But Aria buffet compared other major casino's buffet along strip best taking into account price quality better cheaper Wynn   around $32 per person dinner weeknight   There's something nice fact just food piled top food know?

Just sure don't cut close time line pretty long especially weekends  If pearl higher Mlife card VIP line  <EOR> Welcome Old Country Buffet Aria  Aria being five star resort shocking buffet expensive around $50 person tax poor quality  Aria many great options sadly Buffet Aria no longer one  food mass produced little attention detail  Desserts taste if might day over left overs higher quality options onsite  If looking much better option walk across street Cosmo Wicked Spoon  Aria could learn lot buffet  <EOR> Decent selection but millions selections more popular ones  loved pasta salad which inspired recreate dressing since loved much  being said gave extra star because friend says he could drink dressing re created  think freshness flavors buffet more impressionable most Vegas buffets  day try coveted m buffet should heavens open no line  <EOR> This best buffet ever had  But wasn't mood paying $40 Wynn Bellagio since big eater  contrast Aria buffet cost $27 which thought decent food  enjoyed snow crab king crab which obviously tasted frozen  But expect Las Vegas Maine  fish halibut salmon tasted overcooked dry  enjoyed lamb which friend claimed taste gamey him  friend also under cooked chicken pink center yuck!

Oh god where start? charged holiday price since 4 days Christmas apparently but nothing holiday serve us  crab legs gray mushy told lox bagels  nope meat all fatty  ridiculously overpriced cafeteria oh charged 18% gratuity group  what? bring fork when beg? Awful  Did say already? only thing decent desserts but probably shipped in  Oh line over hour non skysuite people  Ugh  <EOR> By far best buffet encountered Strip thus far    quiet intimate selection grandiose everything tried excellent I finished plate every time    only complaint never back seconds because full quickly   bonus 3 30 able crossover dinner 4pm   way try little bit lunch dinner variety somehow think prefer lunch selection    $20 lunch $30 dinner pretty steep but case pay for   Plus always try staying for dinner trick!  It's little things count  D  *sigh*    I'm lonely  <EOR> It's good buffet located favorite properties  little bit everything especially enjoyed hot crab legs cook your own steak stop! quality food good   It's very modern setting also offer unlimited cocktails your meals if would pay extra  When friends town good option everybody want  <EOR> This probably even star because very little liked food  most buffets strip worst  quality food poor  only ended going because complimentary hotel stay  suggestion people reading Caesar's  Far better     The food just wasn't very good  did pizza fresh  Everything else just wasn't taste anyone else groups liking  wouldn't pay eat seriously worth eat  <EOR> This favorite buffets Vegas   quality food great   Selection really good includes lot Asian dishes   But favorite part desserts!!  Indulge but excess  <EOR> Compared buffet MGM where staying buffet awesome! set sitting area very comfortable  food options great much around  Waitstaff could little bit nicer  Ours very pushy never smiled  <EOR> Losing quality quickly while prices up  Last time coffee absolutely horrible  Tasted cup full burnt coffee beans  Meat carving attendant asked patron where gravy he simply banged container gravy carving knife instead speaking him  Tacky   going elsewhere  <EOR> This buffet should deserve more 2 stars experience  First all brunch menu today which 23 95  service great server friendly  Presentation food really good food quality did worth price   I buffets Wynn Bellagio but comparing price definitely back! <EOR> My friends looked best rated buffets Vegas found Aria rated Top 10  However little shocked when price $39 95 dinner especially when Wicked Spoon Buffet in Cosmopolitan night before $34  Shortly being seated did hesitate price  Every person own lobster tail already pre sliced half unlimited wine! buffet great offered snow king crab legs also pre sliced half   plenty choose even pretty strict diet no carbs no sweets  found shortly lobster unlimited wine only Saturday night or weekends don't remember special  definitely recommend trying around time   We did end going Buffet Aria breakfast $17  wasn't bad just worth $17  However did breakfast late started changing food lunch which meant also fill lunch food price breakfast buffet!  BOTTOM LINE Buffet worth price during lobster unlimited wine night but definitely find pretty decent cheaper buffets breakfast and or lunch <EOR> I've only eaten handful buffets Vegas but Buffet Aria absolute favorite  team Aria excels creating buffet full international flavors  food nicely varied well made totally worth price    From sushi Asian dishes Mexican favorites seafood really sample food offerings across globe  Your typical American faire sandwiches cheeseburgers etc  But why eat when crab legs?! plentiful fruit selection great dessert area complete ice cream scoop    I left buffet feeling completely satisfied would come back heartbeat  would point line drag especially when see large sections tables available  line maybe 40 people back seemed take 30 minutes  come early patient I'm also fan simple decor layout  Its multilevel which more interesting deflects sound better big room table table  also huge windows nearby look pool which gives buffet welcome ambient light    Pace yourself don't just choose first thing see there's much love! <EOR> Didn't eat but did walk through  preggie woman lot couldn't eat  Stack king crab legs amazing  Sushi  Deli section  Nothing impressive   One smallest buffets ever seen Vegas   I'm glad did 'tour' first before deciding where eat day  wouldn't happy selection  <EOR> hands down best buffet vegas if love crab legs champagne its win win just cant lose <EOR> I buy free coupon playing Vegas slots online price issue $36 99 dinner  During week lunch dinner crab legs both hot cold  busy  service great  overwhelmed rooms food  buffet lined two walls salad seafood stations middle  returning crab legs  <EOR> The line long  waited 45 minutes  beginning line noticed money available tables  confused why wait long but marketing scheme  would never return here  Don't fooled  picked cannoli hard rock  <EOR> Been before wasn't impressed but since staying hotel convenient but same items last visit    *Service Welcoming!! some staff nice but most looked annoyed there   On second visit trip took 15 minutes server take drink order no wasn't busy  *Decor Cool Modern!!   *Food food good  overly impressed but still good!!

FAIL!!! never ever return! <EOR> I love place many reasons!! Firstly when arrived wanted see buffet first  cashier said fine but price change few seconds  going $23 close $35 something that   didn't see food ahead time took chances  Now cashier could told would've paid higher price  Well buffet beyond fresh delicious  friend dietary needs came back table point sautéed spinach drooling   She said she saw raw spinach asked staff if any cooked  person said thee wasn't any but no problem cook her  Way please customers  <EOR> You know when Vegas there's always some place someone recommended back your mind OH Vegas so and so buffet good!  try it! Buffet place time around no idea recommended but recommended   There's usual variety cold seafood appetizers salad ethnic entrees hot carving station dessert   Much so modern that it's boring decor everything just ho hum   only things wow'ed crème brûlée flan   Maybe just but gotten used Vegas buffets always having two ten amazing items whether great prime rib fresh fish oysters gimme something friends jealous OMG try Buffet! Sadly none just empty feeling inside empty wallet outside  <EOR> Diner beware  impressive hotel structure outside looks ran money prime priced buffet $36 dinner both decor cuisine   would think same price Bellagio's buffet would expect some competition   should've known something wasn't right when Saturday night weekend CES 8pm only 30 35 people waiting   Food mediocre maybe step two above Main Street Station's buffet   1st slice prime rib excellent second visit medium well dry middle slice   Desserts unimaginable flavorless chocolate dipped strawberries waxy textured non chocolate tasting dip unlike Wynn's Bellagio's    only thing better buffet versus Rio Wynn Bellagio sushi rice very good buffet   My advice skip until re vamp entire buffet chefs person charge tagging food description glass above dish black dry erase marker   Tacky  <EOR> I loved curry chicken garlic naan portugese sausage buffet  desserts also great cheesecake gelato variety toppings delicious cookies  all lunch buffet $20 which really good deal compared some other buffets the only downside being no prime rib   <EOR> Yum!!  Pros Unlimited wine I some 8 plus glasses! cheap but yummy unlimited cares?? super friendly service everyone sweet delicious food  Also vegetarian no trouble finding anything eat! even feel money's worth 35 something pp dinner     Cons While veggie options ask bunch things like soup find if any broth anything it  no knew! only didn't really offer find out  just skipped them all but little strange didn't know! Also dessert little lame  Granted didn't dessert until almost closing buffet but only kind ice cream butterfinger   bleh! none plates tried tasted worth calories  cobbler good but sort tail ends    All all loved but would nice if more two options wine selections i e  substitute beer champagne   Also fourteen year old sister cost same adults drinking! sort lame  love Aria though would down back buffet different meal! <EOR> Brunch EXPENSIVE  30 something person  much money expecting food refilled quickly  finished last two eggs Benedict which delicious but then stopped making more! Ugh disappointed! Other brunch options fair although mediocre price  dessert baked treats gelato wheel highlight  Very clean eating serving areas  Probably won't come back brunch  <EOR> Do believe 5 start reviews dissapointed! buffet mediocre best!  How could such exceptional hotel Aria such mediocre buffet? just doesn't match up  50 years old probably over 50 buffets  just don't understand could anyone give place 4 5 stars?  If want details here's did did like 1  Crab Legs Lots snow crab cold steamed  But no claws small legs NO flavor  must overboiled old   2  Mexican Food Poor selection odd choices dishes  love Mexican food but found nothing wanted seconds on    3  Meat Station Prime Rib just ok Ham undercooked brisket good Salmon good   4  Sushi If want some vegatables cream cheese wrapped rice seaweed guess you'll ok  If want actual sushi real fish seafood you'll somewhere else    5  Breakfast Food Eggs eggs everywhere! If just want freshly cooked eggs omelets love here  But then why just Dennys? Its lot cheaper!  Oh hashbrowns mediocre bad    6  Drinks bought $13 drink package  If want mimosa your brunch you'll small round glass taste bad   Want Sangria? You'll small round glass mediocre  Want glass wine? bad wine served small round glass  Want beer? YES beer!! Its brand name tap  But course served small round glass!! $13 though wrong?  6  Deserts Bland bland bland     Gelato good good good!! But why did take favorite Pistachio fat free? Just give good stuff!! Afterall eating buffet!!  7  Service Table wait staff Good!  Wait staff service stations Poor!  Overall something expected Aria  thought would much higher quality  spent whole time trying something else hoping I'd find least item wanted seconds on  Other gelato didn't happen  <EOR> I'm excited update review Buffet Aria! past week twice holiday brunch both times excellent  first time Christmas Eve only waited 10 minutes line but next time waited 20 minutes which wasn't bad all  Since last visit Easter upgraded lot food selections including made order omelet station red velvet crepe station seafood station oysters Rockefeller seafood boil  Other highlights goat cheese mushroom pizza tonkatsu ramen fried chicken waffles menudo my boyfriend said really good!   ate several buffets during trip Aria best prime ribs tasted! disappointed didn't mochi during Easter but did some great apple cider sorbet delicious Black Forest cake  also happy share during both visits great service all servers seemed work together clear plates refill drinks sure everything needed during meal  If you're Vegas buffet fan sure Aria your list! <EOR> The snow crabs very small stone crabs frozen  average buffet best  Long line mediocre service  only thing really good corn picky eater  <EOR> This 5th time buffet gone downhill  $38 99 per person expected better quality service  Crab legs tasteless shrimps fresh  server always hiding  felt sorry couple sitting next ordered unlimited drinks  No refills   I don't think come back again  <EOR> The food amazing well worth price! However service terrible  paid unlimited drinks waitress barely stopped by  very slow morning no reason avoid table way she did   She two other tables section    Finally when able flag down attention she couldn't nice said buffet long 1 hour 45 mins she would no longer serving needed leave  Well did away minimal 15% tip going leave  normally visit buffet because food good  very disappointing treated that  paid over hundred dollars eat drink treated rudeness contempt   back again because rude service  <EOR> Im staying hotel theres ridiculous line eat buffet 11 pm weekday   Oh yeah did mention restaurant mostly empty  dont want pay enough staff guests supposed waste hours time? Absurd! <EOR> If Aria buffet located somewhere own would probably rate higher but all buffets located strip comes just average  high price whole lining hour even though empty inside bit downer! early around 4pm didn't expect stuck 30 person queue long dismay less third full when seated sure holdup ? look busy passer by's ?  The food pretty good though crab legs plentiful plenty hot seafood choices boiled clams fish chips jambalaya  authentic tandoor oven which making fresh naan tandoori chicken which great chicken well marinated moist having smokey oven scent  roasts nicely done even slider burgers which nice touch   The Chinese selection little bit small but decent satay chicken skewers popular peanut sauce nicely done  usual fares pizza pastas cold meats which didn't indulge in   Like most buffets large selection desserts but thing stands Aria buffet large selection sorbet  Heaps flavours choose stored rotating freezer which pretty cool   Service great efficient waiter but fact waiter moved different section halfway through meal made hard justify tip second waiter less time he took over table   Would come again when Vegas? Probably think new buffet Caesars place well Bellagio Wynn probably rank higher one  <EOR> It's buffer Vegas which usually comes shortly night drinking its hard tell if food good body screaming some nutrients  didn't sick price food good  All really ask days  <EOR> Chinese New Year buffet cost $40 worth best $10  Seriously worst breakfast ever had  pancakes dyed red looked unappealing  omlet meh while wait staff fantastic food servers cooks remotely friendly helpful  Perhaps because am meat eater did find many things eat but dining companion meat eater also found food sub par best  Perhaps better meals throughout day but breakfast buffet should very least tasty particularly price point  <EOR> Ok but totally worth $40 weekday dinner price  Overall average selection although quality good see food  Overall beef pot roast mashed potatoes best  Desserts look great but only 4 pretty good while left finding would really happy ending me  Likely won't coming again ' 3 top choices strip Bacchanal expensive Spice Market Planet Hollywood Wicked Spoon Cosmo  <EOR> Do enjoy standing line 30 minutes into buffet costs $65 per person? Then place you  vegetarian smarter intentions only because family wanted go  worst things buffet temperature food no monitoring  Pho lukewarm according brother probably vegetarian due beefstock something similar  No vegetarian sushi fact much eat all if vegetarian  food wasn't very fresh probably lot leftovers previous day s     One positive thing did 5 different types hummus   something see every day  <EOR> I rate Buffet Aria 5 5 stars  frequent visitor Las Vegas Strip favorite hotel Aria City Center  If looking likely find there  No much into gambling yes into food shows things see  Buffet Aria second favorite buffet behind Buffet Bellagio which BTW short tram ride Aria   Buffet Aria smaller Bellagio fewer choices but and BIG BUT selections food great! exactly eat happy eat everything have  merits Aria's buffet are quick elevator ride your room rather 25 minute walk ride walk Bellagio shorter lines Bellagio quicker fill your plate  strategy would breakfast Aria's buffet a breakfast breakfast no advantage Bellagio buffet then dinner Aria Bellagio buffet  highly recommend Buffet Aria! <EOR> One compact Buffet  their selection food great    sugar free desert    Good salad selection  They healthy alternatives    reasonable price eat      <EOR> Two words Crab Legs   Lunch Dinner eaten various buffets throughout Strip all offer crab legs  Everyone does prime rib ham roasted chicken Asian food Italian food salad etc  Even crappier buffets offer that  everyone offers hot cold crab legs   Obviously more expensive breakfast but greater selection   Breakfast Only really worth if you're super hungry  Nothing extraordinary  your omelets sausage waffles fruit etc  Typical stuff  <EOR> For buffet nice hotel such Aria would expect little better selection weekend lunch  really lacked variety food selection! Service also bit slow  Several tables selection wait quite long time any drinks  honest I'd probably eat buffet ever again  many other better choices available  <EOR> don't waste your money dinner buffet  The lobster size bigger crayfish  plenty crab leggs shrimps but nothing tasty    wine horrible   havign 2 glasses everything tasted same   don't think waitress happy if sat your table more hour   bottom line don't waste your money buffet   would better spend little more ordered menu nicer restaurant   Aria hotel room very nice but paying resort fee but getting free wifi use gym down side stay again  <EOR> Price quality perfect   Choose bubbly wine option worth money <EOR> The first time tried place when first opened more exotic choices such rabbit  duck etc very few buffets offer  Maybe because also weekend time  Recently husband tried again since 2 1 offer myvegas slot games promotion also tried weekday wasn't best had  selections varieties much smaller much other buffets same price     Generally flavors bad selections still yummy but price pay better again more selections well  would come again only 2 1 promotion  Otherwise much better buffet options other hotels  <EOR> This favorite buffets Vegas all employees very respectful severs quick feet manger Lulu works very diligently rushing around help customers if need be    <EOR> For price paid $38 dinner scam!

Hope keep quality up! Good job Buffet  <EOR> I Vegas summer 2011 Aria Buffet many times because amazing  just recently remodeled half size used be  food sitting around while no taste all  very dissapointed  Almost $50 nd horrible would recomend Caesars Buffet Aria used be  really hate writing bad reviews but Aria really dropped ball <EOR> The Buffet Aria par other high end buffets Las Vegas strip   showed 3 30PM day opened purpose able sample lunch dinner dishes   cost $21 99 per person included usual drink offerings soda iced and or hot tea coffee juices   The first action station see skimpy made to order salad bar where any three+ servers place small variety incredients into mixing bowl add dressing place plate bowl   neat idea salad action station but falls short   really need portion romaine shredded carrots? asked myself   Moving along line begin see real food including 3 carving stations turkey leg lamb prime rib  all acceptable quality well seasoned   BEWARE SUSHI sushi terrible!  essentially same caliber would low end local supermarket way heavy rice fish barely visible dull dry instead shinny moist    Skip sushi!  BEWARE ASIAN DISHES also half dozen Asian dishes laid including Chinese brocolli beef hoisin sauce orange chicken noodles veggies egg rolls etc   First hoisin sauce which might well called hoisin salt buffet becuase way salty well stirred   would avoid unless your soy sauce shot glass   eggrolls way much dough enough veggies under cooked   noodles overcooked flavor uneven bite next   They did some interesting Indian dishes which well seasoned could even detect several layers flavor which does take some skill pull off even Indian cuisine   also fresh baked garlic nam bread brushed butter highly recommend   The dessert station average included usual tiny cakes cheesecake cookies but chocolate dipped strawberries tasted wax etc    So sum if find yourself buffet skip all but carving stations Indian food dessert bar   Perhaps they're process learning mistakes but point could take 10 minute walk just any direction 4 5 star buffet experience another hotel   highly recommend buffets Bellagio Planet Hollywood Mirage over Aria competitively priced   fact even if cleaned act Asian foods right Aria's buffet cafeteria line set ill equiped effectively compete competition nearby   its best could potentially become 3 star buffet opinion  <EOR> Good variety food  Love Mediterranean Indian selections fresh Naan   Alaskan crab shrimp really fresh  only caveat don't good job replenishing food when empty  dessert station worth checking out  <EOR> If we're taking buffet standards great  Prime rib juicy excellent steak crab legs little cold but if dig find some big ones great dessert selection very wide range international offerings outstanding service staff  Tip if you're going breakfast 10 minutes before brunch starts you'll all lunch items same time breakfast items but breakfast price which lower  <EOR> My favorite buffet Vegas  AMAZINGLY AWESOME!

The food good   Loved pre cut crab legs   Loved desserts   Service great friendly prompt   Everything presented well buffet clean   Modern decor just rest hotel   But would return because constant shaking floor seats  <EOR> Three stars pretty fair assessment  place very spacious modern decor  Staffs very attentive refilling drinks cleaning dishes  Those pretty much pluses    What's good? food pretty disappointing  While wide selection cuisines average best  example sushi rice wasn't well cooked  crabs salty  expectations would probably much lower if situationed inside 5 star hotel  <EOR> WORST Buffet strip  all food wrong Labeled which made put some meat mouth beeing vegetarian    Horrible plus food looks dry old  all seafood frozen  really low quality expecting much more ARIA  go Bacchanal Ceaser's palace wicked spoon cosmo bellagio 5 10 $ dollars but quality its much better  Servers  only worried f going drink put much pressure ordering drinks etc     AVOID Buffet <EOR> This probably worst buffets strip  lot foods seemed sitting hours un flavorful cold   I could bad place but don't words describe them  yourself favor Bellagio even Planet Hollywood across street  <EOR> I am stickler only good food but also quality food    being said definitely returning buffet  food edible but lack selection spotty service place only need once short life Earth  <EOR> Wow! breakfast amazing  loved french toast fried sticks pastries everything else  Breakfast $18 99 well worth it! <EOR> I am buffet fan since eat lot  happened book stay Aria during promotion 2 free** buffets per day  brunch day breakfast another  pretty good  pay IMO buffet some quality food  Fresh ice cream  great Indian food yummy omelets fresh fruit more  would recommend buffet meat eaters since variety choices choose from  vegetarian? Only if resort credit vegans forget it   The service great  best experienced buffet   waiters nice quick drink orders table clean up  <EOR> We decided should try all eat buffet wow spread  Everything delicious  Especially desserts  <EOR> Decent buffet  wish though drink waiter would around more often could gotten few more mimosas $12 99 unlimited option  Even though Monday service bit slow meat cutter guys seemed unhappy working  food itself alright  everything hummus pita chips crab legs chorizo breakfast burrito cinammon bun  hashbrowns surprisingly great!

The service very nice attentive  used seeing tower used plates table buffets but plates never exceeded past stack three plates shows aware staff surroundings  Definitely impressed    I definitely come back future! <EOR> Buffet worth 4 95 very dissapointing coming Aria  Only French toast tofu salald gelato good   The wait price totally worth save your Vegas Money somewhere else!! <EOR> I tought buffet little pricy first 30$ + taxes service sunday brunch but honnestly greatest buffet to  Lot choice great selection meat asian food dessert seafood sandwiches breakfast items    only wish more hungry when there! Its worth price plus if comps your m life card redeem them there  <EOR> My gosh failed me  Lunch Dinner sucks  Overcooked fish meats mushy grilled veggies Its only 6 months since visited happened?? recommended over Wicked Spoon boy correct 6months ago  sure know  off recent reviews because place down hill just couple months   A plus restroom same section buffet area  No need exist come back  far haven't experienced any lines wait  But some servers pretty disgruntled here  <EOR> This review if Weekday Lunch Time Breakfast prices during March 2012     Aria Buffet indeed overpriced but good come right before 11am during weekday eat lunch breakfast prices cause breakfast price 17 expensive just breakfast food crabs sushi comes 11am    The Good Modern Chic Design clean interiors   The sushi salmon tuna nigiri several rolls actually decent quality buffet    The crabs served cold but hand your plate crabs server behind counter steam you   Garlic Naan Bread curry dishes over jasmine rice very good  Cuts meats Prime Rib Pork Belly always good   Desserts Very good even though selection may small usually end taking 3 4 cakes Coffee also quite good   The line usually shorter most Buffets    The Bad Way Expensive Lunch Dinners Weekend Brunch    Cashiers always quite rude    Selection small no unique entrees  <EOR> Wait over hour half  Plenty tables open  sure why slow  Food okay  <EOR> I debating between 3 4 stars but decided 3 star polling sister Mom   buffet pretty offered quite bit brunch however nothing wowed me   Everything good but nothing great  major downfall dessert section which offered very little s'mores popcorn two types cookies few other items can't recall   best part Mediterranean sections where offered several types hummus pita chips  Compared MGM grand down street much more reasonable price felt bit let down  struggle write anything less 5 star Aria because favorite casinos visit when Las Vegas   just highest expectations but enjoyed MGM just much if better  <EOR> For $30+ buffet meal really expected buffet Aria par wynn's bellagio's   Based yelp rating see case   Overall  very forgettable buffet experience   If more $30 dollars spend should take money different buffet  <EOR> They didn't many customers when arrived  little bit worried because good place always crowded people    They don't many choices honestly  However flavor AMAZING  Especially Chinese food Indian Curry  Except those fresh squeezed watermelon lime juice stunning! just love here!  The service just but don't really care just buffet   I'd back again again again <EOR> I honestly don't understand anyone grouse buffet Aria unless don't really buffets general  If want fine dining experience Scarpetta Guy Savoy  If want amazing buffet Aria    I first Aria buffet October 2012 time next visit October 2013 revamped  liked originally but re do experience even better  friend visited lunch price very reasonable maybe $22? Complimentary beverages served classy stemless wine glasses cheerful server all making sure stayed hydrated    Of all things ate only bite wasn't crazy lone potsticker  means found following things delicious chicken salad ham macaroni cheese mashed potatoes sushi albeit rice tad dry antipasti mushroom bruschetta French onion soup corned beef hash gazpacho crab legs mussels pecan tart chocolate cake coconut macaroons   and probably more things can't remember  <EOR> I wonder why Aria doesn't greater buffet  gave try because earned free buffet reward myVEGAS app   cost around $30 per person lunch   big selection food different cultures however quality just great   Most food only give 70 100   Such sushi sashimi refresh all even good presentation   Nothing really attracted except nice salad bar   Well salad simple right just different raw ingredients put together   did simple salad added piece roasted chicken  husband didn't even feel eating most food    Comparing bellagio Cesar Palace much better presentations food quality Aria but thought Aria high end hotel well     I don't think pay another visit again    but hotel nice  <EOR> Whoever said best things life free needs firm talking wife dined here  I won comp through MyVegas admit mixed reviews wanted give buffet shot since Aria all but WOW did ever regret that!  My overall opinion variety food offered hopeful first but disappointed walked around scope things out  does your customary dessert area asian area mexican area salad area tandoor area carving area  point saw Area 51 but only thing world unfortunately!  The food itself missed many marks point where only 1 plate refused back anything further  I tried vegetable egg roll pineapple sausage orange chicken Asian station  did find egg roll cooked quite well crispy swimming day pool grease  orange chicken hit miss piece piece  some soft flavorful majority well more geared towards being jawbreaker delight orient   My highlight meal prime rib carving station but didn't totally meat mark pardon pun   The gentleman manned station very pleasant did seem take being respectful rarity which made wonder people normally  I give kudos certainly people deserve treated equals  THAT could whole other review itself  The prime rib itself very tender BUT did lack quite bit flavor  I drenched au jus but still some bold flavor would've appreciated  Another notable peel eat shrimp steamed snow crab  The shrimp itself high point did enjoy crab cut half could just essentially skin crab meat vs  getting carpal tunnel cracking all day  I probably could've eaten much more looking around did seem crowd pleaser patrons above anything else   I say closing let down clearly better well accepted buffets Vegas seems dying breed once was but really hope Aria takes notice conducts serious revamp things near future  The staff warm inviting which saving grace but empty dining room during pre Zarkana hours does kind paint very disturbing picture right? <EOR> I visited 4 buffet's while Vegas BEST one! Sadly day before leave cause definitely would gone back if more time  back next year! <EOR> Worthless worst buffet  food bland  Does worth price  Desserts fairy OK but everything else strictly avoidable  Stay away does worth 25$ nor your time <EOR> Note advice   come if you've gone bacchanal buffet recently  don't really think even worth 31 99    Coming super excited try crab legs  best part some warm  thing did love  shrimp little cocktail glasses  Adorable  pretty darn good but overall would come back buffet just factor   I wouldn't even call buffet  half many options bellagio wicked spoon bacchanal  Latin section maybe four options  Rice green chile verde asada burritos weird quesadilla things    All food hard disappointing  could tell sitting under lamps way long  scallop potatoes dry creamy cold  BBQ brisket slider dry BBQ sauce disappeared into bun hardly any meat  mash potatoes lacking something  Maybe salt? max cheese good but def nothing special  could whip something similar own kitchen toddler   The prime rib very good though  fatty cooked just way enjoy it   Medium rare  actually back seconds  Another item thought cool pick your salad toss you  liked that  haven't seen other buffets  But honestly only special item    The desserts blah nothing special yet again except item   lemon bars! Yum  cope those  carrot cake dry no raisins pineapple salsa plate didn't pair well all it    Overall little disappointing but happy note unlimited drinks 12 99  mix change sangria white wint beer special drinks   good deal something keep mind  <EOR> Came weekday dinner boyfriend around 4pm immediately seated  used 2 for 1 offer myVEGAS only paid $42 two excluding tip    Pros Seafood! chilled crab legs mussels clams peeled shrimp but best part also served steamed crab legs! Yup  right don't ask them steam them you  already done personal favorites also steamed mussels steamed clams! Both dishes perfectly cooked accompanying sauces HEAVENLY  The clams white butter garlic sauce mussels well quite honestly am sure but pretty darn good  also poke bar which did try but looked fish pretty fresh  Meat! Well least according boyfriend self proclaimed king meat  He made multiple trips carving station brisket which he would stop raving hours meal  beef ribs also cooked perfectly meat falling off bone  He did note couple meat dishes overseasoned    Cons Selection pretty limited  huge buffet  mainly stuck eating same few dishes since rest buffet didn't appeal much me  Besides seafood meat Asian cuisine pho tonkatsu ramen dim sum etc  salad bar desserts classic American food Mediterranean food basically just some dips Indian food  likely wouldn't pay full price eat buffet  Unless more quality dishes fewer average ones I'd return only if discount offer again  <EOR> Price good  Selection very limited compared Wynn Bellagio  However items king crab legs various roasts gooooood  Veal bacon?

Under scrambled eggs fried chicken? some random characters label  Why place food tags anyway if cant right    Stay away Aria's buffet  You'll better deal eating Ihop  <EOR> Service cashier other staff members worse McDonald's   It does pretty nice dessert but everything else just college buffet grade  <EOR> There few good items but mostly forgettable  I'd rank Aria's offering Vegas buffet lineup somewhere middle   Let's start some good points   As silly might sound horchata favorite thing! rich creamy perfect touch cinnamon  No es authentico pero es muy sabroso!

Points sure!  initially lined omelette but line super long   bypassed meat theme  tried prime rib bbq brisket turkey roast pork all fresh cut demand   general meat star brunch today   something did expect weekend brunch meal   did eventually omelette later meal worth wait   I liked most all buffet items prepared gluten free which very proud thing boast   However attempt avoid tummy filling carbs looked past different unique flavored cream cheeses bagels pancakes waffles wrapped fruit blintzes   Even eggs benedict looked tempting well   One thing baffled Asian hot dishes   like noodles stir fried beef   wasn't sure fit brunch theme   I didn't see sushi sashimi which would gladly tried   price point $35 comparison regular weekday breakfast lunch quite steep   companions did try bottomless bloody marys very satisfied but weren't wowed it   All all 3 5 STARS pretty room decent but great food selections near Aria pool  <EOR> Our stay ARIA included credits resort restaurants worse flights Vegas experienced left both famished nauseated decided head downstairs try Buffet  btw love whole Ohio State thing become contest see which player only douchebag university  can't wait Ivy League players into mix   Anyway back food many buffets know select avoid  Unfortunately some most appealing on paper choices also worst crab legs Asian station tandoori oven cooked naan bread should avoided all costs  personally liked most some least popular options grilled vegetables quinoa tabouli salads  prime rib steamed clams tomato base also good   My wife surf turf which cold lobster paired quality rib eye bernaise sauce  However majority things tried just snuff  service very friendly efficient never wait long anything   Definitely worth money but variety options pleasant setting service good option if staying want eat ASAP  <EOR> So Torn one!  This past weekend might best indicator paid $10 premium $47 95 because Labor day weekend   However 37 95 price mind review   This really only competitor Wynn Buffet   Let's head head that   Definitely notch below bacchanal Wicked spoons others mentioned   Seafood The Wynn lacking department   Please see other review   Basically cold king crab legs not so fresh oysters so so sushi  The Aria did much better however offered two types crab legs including cold hot selection   Match cocktail shrimp muscles    round far favor Aria   few other things but escapes right now  winner Aria  Carvery The Wynn wins hands down but catch   able serve best prime rib strip   course little hit miss but piece received perfect    The Aria terrible   All meats sausages chicken new york steak lamp overcooked   cook talked explained prime rib isn't cooked same kitchen kept warm under heat lamp before being rolled out   explains overcooked prime rib   However surf turf station unique Vegas strip nearly pulls gutter   sirloin steak prepped separately BEST steak strip   Easily comparable restaurant steak eaten SF downtown LA    dish alone lobster topping probably worth $15 alone   If prime rib half good I'd telling Aria right now   said don't think enough pull win over wynn  Winner Wynn  Variety Wynn decent variety   liked its unique salad creations its variety meats course its desserts   However still limited uniqueness   The aria variety indeed   showcases indian cuisines which pretty unique   Nan bread good humus   wasn't abundance things indian food though   aria also displayed lobster bisque tomato basil new england clam chowder   better clam chowder but  different topic   would say par wynn   mentioned carvery surf turf station stands prominently   reason give round Aria  winner aria  dessert Just wynn   Nothing really special Aria    winner dessert  VALUE Ok if 37 95 spend    tough   would say aria because just expect much more when wynn   service decor better Aria   Everytime left table seat cleared all previous plates    impressive   also asked if would another drink every often which point am able change orange juice soda   don't often really keep drinking orange juice throughout meal   Is really 4 star place?  really but there's enough people leaving 1 star if gave 4 wouldn't hurt   They're definitely AVERAGE 3 star buffet     Spend extra $10 wicked spoon <EOR> Good value great food   Smaller buffet most but found better since wasn't overwhelming options great!  Lots seafood   brisket favorite   If want super large many options Buffett it   Its smaller scale yet options available HIGH  quality  <EOR> The first buffet privilege trying Vegas  Before playing some craps walked huge ads buffet inside aria decided afterwards check out  really won over picture snow crabs     I never expect much when comes all eat crab places because tend serve them cold only eat much but nice hoot    Starting off service amazing buffet hostess server cleared dishes very timely manner  drink lot liquids anytime well pleased see server very nice all refills needed haha       The food pretty good buffet  food supposedly everywhere but only frequented seafood carving station  Asian food alright     the Indian food ok  liked Italian your own pasta station but chef rude wouldn't pay much attention requests made  Sort just shrugged them off did he wanted do     great big selection dessert well  For price regularly charge would say food itself really worth it   I discount came along runners perks don't any other buffets compare but heard Caesars really good! Anyway good day! <EOR> I came first time last summer truly disappointed  because overpriced even myVegas reward  really nothing worth eat except prime rib which any standard buffets  extra $10 if want unlimited drink which minus  other buffets trip such Mirage pay $30 unlimited drinks  But Aria buffet pay around $40 without drinks  Plus would wait long time servers come refilling your drinks  also pay extra tips those servers  Mirage buffet avoid uncomfortable inconvenient thing  Overall worth money  <EOR> The best thing say staff  Some kindest warmest people ever met! However upscale property buffet pitiful  Every table sausage soup display indicative facility ur stature  hunt sauces no sugar free desserts  <EOR> On last trip Vegas pleasure dining both Bacchanal Wicked Spoon bar excessively expensive buffets set pretty high   Before last night never left buffet hungry   quality food reason rating   single dish worth second taste   more par Golden Corral high end Vegas buffet   My specific issues The king crab legs still partially frozen   Any thick part solid crabsicle  The snow crab legs must salted cut open   eating salt lick  The crawfish completely unseasoned just boiled   know unseasoned crawfish taste like?  Mud!   why southerners Cajun them up! The paella favorite dishes complete disaster   both overcooked cold didn't rinse clams ahead time sandy grit fairly certain rice dyed yellow food coloring because zero taste saffron  The lamb very dry The grilled prawns burnt  just one off mistake waited 2 other batches taken others before actually taking myself exactly rubbery feared  The sushi rice very old dry The dim sum while edible far cry authentic  I would say dessert station best feature buffet but nothing special   All desserts adequate but nothing couldn't myself certainly nothing memorable worth extravagant price charged   The only redeeming factor service   waitress refilled drinks speed stealth ninja bus staff also very prompt removing used plates   wish could taken $43 back register given them   Bottom line if want high end buffet want pay lot both Bacchanal Wicked Spoon orders magnitude better Aria   If want low quality feed trough food right but price not  <EOR> I usually come Buffet Aria when free buffet voucher 2 1 buffet price  believe MyVegas still free lunch buffet Mon Fri most other places til Thursday   Décor great place clean selection bad  gelato ice cream dessert!

I sorely disappointed  buffet lacked selections  tried different unique but fail miserably  Every dish Aria Buffet tried little bit different your traditional Las Vegas buffet  sets expectation more refined flavors quality  Well Indian station interesting but flavors unauthentic  Chinese station terrible   I'd rather eat Panda Express! Sushi station   ummm almost missed 4 types very ordinary cheap rolls and much rice sushi could hardly tell sushi!   sage rotisserie chicken no flavor  smoked pork chop humongous   but very little smoke flavor   The crab legs good but melted butter no flavor  prime rib good and rare! but whipped horseradish terrible   there clumps cream   and use fork break cream mix pure horseradish  Really???  The desserts really piqued interest since didn't gorge savory items usually buffets   I plenty room dessert! here's rundown Gelato great but such limited selection  Creme Brulee delicious! Cheesecake rich enough nor crust hearty enough  Sugar free Chocolate Cake decent   but couldn't use some Splenda? Cookies so so   I've better cheaper buffets    The service standard buffet service   not impressive  hotel Aria certainly expected much better experience  easily find better meal Vegas $27 99! <EOR> $35 brunch fewer selections food Bellagio's buffet  quality food Okay great taste  worth money paid  <EOR> Any buffet calls itself The Buffet very comfortable a buffet trying sound THE buffet kind pretentious alums Ohio State   case The Buffet Aria more humble laidback version  light bright open atmosphere buffet simple yet delicious dishes means Buffet good choice when hotel casino City Center  isn't really buffet your way Vegas but nice option if you're already there   It's only $21 lunch  If want all you can drink wine then try $37 dinner  good stuff aka Gourmet Lobster only served Friday Saturday dinner  If used Las Vegas buffets then pile crab legs small selection sushi meats pastas salads seem very familiar  Nothing really stood sucked  liked pasta alfredo sauce some reason simple salad  Maybe because towards end stay  course desserts highlight any Vegas buffet same true Aria little cakes pastries ice cream  <EOR> For buffet recently renovated spot very good  liked wide variety foods dim sum sushi Indian gelato fresh seafood soups Chinese meats more   Some food wasn't stellar but some really outstanding  found best tandoori chicken ever fresh oven moist flavorful  Fresh chewy naan unusual thing see buffet very welcome  Great prime rib au jus  Great seafood  many choices!   Lovely desserts found less spectacular looking things tasted better many beautifully composed desserts  loved gelato   This good step two above Bellagio buffet which surprised us  <EOR> On whim searched gluten free Vegas buffet found only great reviews  one  made beeline while Bally's conference  Lucky ran into concierge waiting chef show someone around celiac  wound getting full tour buffet learned safe eat  which surprising amount  Things would thought made gluten free corn fritters tiramisu made combination almond tapioca flour  need learn this!!!     The pho station also worked when chose veggie miso broth soba buckwheat noodles   also gluten free pizza pasta cooked order if want but overstuffed myself crab legs tacos veggies carving station meats pho lots tiramisu My server very nice soon some wayward crab fell off plate no cracking utensils readily available bound happen someone stopped clean up  think helped town just before March Madness St  Patrick's Day many people around Vegas general  Made more sane experience   The only thing tasted off fish tacos  seems sitting around while tasted fishy cold  didn't sick anything ate however happy camper  Props chef thinking gluten free folks! <EOR> Went back recently glad see decent king grab legs back menu  They're still served cold  ask them steam they'll give dirty look  expensive compared other places but food voucher can't complain  <EOR> Great breakfast   Good selection items everyone   Fresh hot items too   $20 pp better deal buying hotel cafe market where breakfast sandwich already $14  <EOR> So far Aria latest five star hotel Las Vegas  However buffet didn't taste five star  expected proven wrong Christmas Holiday dinner $39 99+Tax    Its buffet 2nd floor which hard find there's no restroom near buffet  need walk Viva Elvis theater which hard find   line long but since 25th ready wait   We came large group 12 understand may hard find table 12 busy time decided split group into 2 six people groups hope would easier  hostess took first six people group then gave four people seat! WTH?! When asked she insisted she just asked four people come while actually asked six claimed no other seat available time while clearly see some other tables two four available combining them making six  She even insisted two should back front cashier start all over again  frustrating staying line 2 hrs cannot seated in? immediately asked speaking manager  He responsed very quick politely provided resolutions trying resolve seating problem  ended getting another two seat table separated table four  Although best solution think could accept partly because manager's attitude nice but mainly because hungry exhausted standing line  Let food rather seating crap   Originally assume Holiday dinner should lots selections however Aria let down because only few selection Chinese Italian Indian  served crab lag shrimp cocktail which good because paid more $40 bucks expect see those  served lamb which great because every buffet served it  But mint bit odd  would hope jelly green looking sauce  Chinese dish looks all you can eat Samwoo place sells roast ducks BBQ porks shumais etc  much less choices  very impressed   Their dessert looks gorgeous partly because glass plate use  Yule log great while another weird dessert tiny oreo top tastes weird combination chocolate syrup Robitussin  gelato but am big fan  much fruit choose    Overall buffet overpriced especially its dinner  many food choices here  If come large group prepared because hostesses don't seem know handle large group seatings  If choose stay Aria wanna buffet yourself favor walking Bellagio  <EOR> It's pretty good buffet  best Bellagio still holds honor IMHO but certainly there    The crab legs exceptionally good  Everything else just good     It costs same other high end buffets but general crowded    Bottom line If meal time want buffet good  best but certainly bad   Other there's really much say    <EOR> Brunch weekday buffet   Impressed diversity selection  enjoyed Indian curries    Very fresh delicious crab claws prawns   muscle station   fresh fish deserves 5 star alone   agree other Yelpers flavor lacking  Many items just blah   Service excellent   Really great selection desserts   did eat any Asian items seemed very sad fresh   Staff serving food seemed unhappy   If seafood great service your thing definitely check out   hard time understanding set many different types foods everyone group would happy  think worth value  <EOR> This buffet great price  price mean fact party 4 paid $5 each since two complimentary passes magic roulette fingers paid significant portion other two buffets you math!    I think if paid full $38 95 dinner would much pickier review   That said bottomless wine of which only drank sip because heavy caloric intake* 1 lb steamed lobster   My cousins loaded all sorts fancy meats think prime rib steak king crab snow crab swore prime rib best they've had  however life changed thing night creme brulee    I devoured six those suckers  Best creme brulee life!

Rum punch delicious   I love steamed crab legs + clarified butter    I lots things want try little bit but     I don't there's nothing besides crab legs course just think amazing want keep eating more single item  Nothing stands out   Their dessert area while plentiful still falls short gorgeous decadent desserts Wicked Spoon offers    And neutral zone staff  Very hit miss  Some line staff wonderful kind while others give rude looks if try attention  Same thing your dedicated server sometimes sometimes not   Out all buffets Aria still ranks top 5 mostly due steamed crab legs great deal drinks! <EOR> The buffet Aria wonderful!! crab legs fresh hot kept coming!  Wide variety choices desserts great!  Gelato delicious  only downside price $42 per person Saturday night  But well worth definitely back! <EOR> Food good   weekend dinner all drink wine   bottomless wine decent only problem server only refilled glass once ask it   Service just meh   Be warned if shrimp pull off all crap yourself     Ambiance just OK   would Wynn even Bellagio before I'd return buffet  <EOR> For some reason people giving place hard knocks   absolutely loved it   weekends awesome gourmet menu stuff crab legs venison duck steak ect   name it   couldn't love bottomless white red wine???  Plus every table gets lobster tail   think alone would great buffet   Anyway always come empty leave full little tipsy   I also brunch buffet   quite good but still pretty great bottomless chamagne huge selection  <EOR> $36 holiday buffet ?  asked hostess special warrant higher price 3pm   She said bigger better more brunch   It's ok buffet loaded lots starchy carbs breads pizza mashed potatoes lots proteins prime rib salmon shellfish but strangely devoid vegetables real proper salad bar  Of note vegetarians vegans those low carb regime     Salad pathetic little station small bowls you'd see Carl's Junior fact Carl's may bigger selection salad bar   There's no way could build salad meal here   If want only side salad you're business   Grilled vegetables way across room small dish perhaps 4 length best next some cured olives Mediterranean station   Somewhat pathetic   A strange orphan station salsa guacamole plus sour cream standing alone side small kiosk sushi soups without any appropriate foods might actually accompany nearby     Huh?  Eggs Benedict didn't just runny yolk whites uncooked  Yuck!  Desserts looked pretty but some looked little shop worn lemon squares perhaps sitting case long   On upside Indian station chilaquilles couple fine cheeses gelato   This visually nice looking but execution perhaps best Vegas buffet  <EOR> The variety food its awesome  place clean  staff nice   Close everything  <EOR> I've almost all buffets strip  impressed one  I 2 45 Saturday dinner started 3 saved myself couple bucks  The food good  much selection seen others  Prime rib good lots crab   Looking pictures others posted think short end stick dessert main reasons buffets  Maybe fancier desserts gets closer actual dinner time  Nice layout interior nice staff  <EOR> Picture long rectangular dining table end mouth opening closing   chomping away   maybe illustration cartoon esque?  But truly feel kid candy store!   Unlimited all eat food BOMB! Best all always FREE when go! Thanks MGM casino hosts loved!  Now if pay think might bit overpriced   but quite tasty even buffet but quite tasty   period!

There's latino Asian Mediterranean American pizza aisle full salads fruits desserts! best part seafood section Alaskan King crab legs mussels shrimp crawfish etc! husband paid approx 93 00 two 5 00pm prepared pay but very worth it! <EOR> We decided try buffet Aria since seen some sites online stated pretty good lately  pleasantly surprised lived sites saying some caveats  Everything well prepared lot items good unlike most other places around where large variety items but each mediocre  other hand if want variety limited options compared places Bacchanal Caesar's Palace   The buffet more seafood focused warm snow crab legs very good better other places including Bacchanal Wynn Bellagio  cold crab legs less flavorful ended sticking warm snow crab legs  prime rib also very good again par better other places tried  Other good items included sliders all desserts tried very good  desserts larger typical offerings elsewhere  also gelato section which also very good    While spicy tuna hand roll good sushi section limited compared other places  small Chinese section several steamed bun dim sum options but didn't sample these  addition also pho section which also skipped since disappointing results elsewhere  section Indian food including tandoori oven which made tandoori chicken dinner  tried piece interesting option  Alas while looked tandoori chicken missing much flavor authentic tandoori chicken   As interesting aside score warm snow crab legs middle which very easy crack half without any crab eating tools then pull crab meat very easily   All all if knowing options bit more limited some place Bacchanal then pleasantly surprised many items actually very delicious seafood prime rib desserts all being very strong  become wife's favorite buffet Las Vegas Wynn Bacchanal follow order though understand things may change future  <EOR> Went other day lunch co worker  lot space devoted food but seems half taken cooking stations where nobody cooking anything  salad station where someone tosses your salad station where someone pours some Miso soup  Seems waste space  Overall lot variety each area only 3 4 dishes pick from  best part buffet king crab legs jumbo shrimp desert area  worth price  <EOR> On last day Vegas husband couldn't decide where eat decided just dine buffet Aria because least could find something satisfy everyone   wasn't bad lunch buffet lots things choose favorites included lamb curry roasted chicken   really liked buffet included sugar free desserts such delicious lime panna cotta coconut   Next time we're town we'll sure check advertised lobster dinner menu  <EOR> While Vegas Bachelorette Party weekend buffets part agenda all but last day trip decided Buffet Aria brunch  all early afternoon flights planned pass once getting plane best fill tummies before trip home!

Several chefs designated separate stations buffet request them cook specialty    With hotel facilities rooms being new nice expecting better food variety buffet   Since stayed while Vegas would've nice if buffet better variety escape blazing heat outside haha  <EOR> The best Buffet Las Vegas   excellent service except rude cashier named TERESITA ! free buffet she made all way downstairs mlife desk solve problem never big thing she just being rude  talked manager  visited buffet Aria twice during stay tried breakfast lunch  food actually tastes real food something put microwave cold  loved experience recommend others give try see it  selection good vegetarian plenty options  could should let people own drinks because getting variety drinks when buffet  But truly best experience Buffet  took kids love selection desserts carving station delicious according kids  <EOR> I dinner buffet which $30 person  design atmosphere nice offer variety foods  Seafood Mexican Chinese pizza etc  felt king crab legs prime rib best choices  served other meats rack lamb but worth taking space stomach  dessert bar good several types pastries ice cream  creme brulee better average buffets  friend told selection brunch good  would eat again but only if free dining credit Aria  <EOR> Four stars being gluten friendly   pretty legit  Every little substation tells if any gluten free options area  wasn't perfectly explained    meaning kind walk around bit understand can't eat    but once hang blammo   I don't usually use word but figured good time start  Blammo   The dessert area dope  crab legs lot work expected  paella bomb  Actually wasn't paella  jambalaya  Still  Super bomb   Bathrooms nice  Hostesses kinda meh  Overall I'd come back if ARIA wanted gain five six pounds  <EOR> I want give place 3 5 but extremely high price buffet made round down 3  5 people line when 7pm which very weird  saturday dinner cost $46 tax tip    The layout design restaurant give high class vibe  general food quality very similar Bellagio more focus Indian food  fresh made naan which quite delicious   Theres standard crab legs shrimp but some reason weekend unpeeled shrimp crab legs smaller then remembered seeing before  also gave half lobster each guest sat down but allowed refills lobster  Lobster very delicious   I mainly enjoyed carved meats  lot options such brisket prime rib pork ribs beef ribs skirt steak mahi mahi etc  which very good  chinese food sushi okay but real memorable  didnt try pastas pasta station but didnt use it   The desert area sorta hit miss  didnt but know others liked it  Its more crap shoot whether stuff stuff liked  love cheesecake creme brulee but didnt really anything that  cheesecake something would consider cheesecake   I would back again but think would rather Bellagio buffet  <EOR> If staying hotel City Center then maybe   lunch  shrimp cocktail king crab legs alright  oysters fresh  salads pretty good  some fresh melons but fresh fruits hiding all way around corner desserts  All meats over cooked  duck extra salty  desserts probably best  No need special trip  <EOR> One buffets Vegas! If you're MLife member Pearl up? just any MLife level? special line don't wait line hour!   I love Aria buffet eating least good dozen times honestly recommend everybody  Unlike lot buffets feeling airiness  bright inviting view Aria pools which may may good news    When getting down stuffing mouth don't want feel claustrophobic think ceilings cave in   Every time packed which good sign because food constantly being replaced made  love crab legs if way would all day    The downside pricey amount food available  Good thing MGM resorts always those free buffet vouchers available! good thing remember check promo codes online before book properties  let eat most buffets regardless location  Aww yeah  <EOR> Like all other tables Vegas strategy involved when hitting buffet   I took practiced hand The Buffet Aria last weekend when sin city  good choice though best buffet visited  features few stand outs  few misses  among otherwise average food   I'll liked didn't moment but first allow share philosophy smart buffet dining   To full dining experience any buffet need plan  no wrong plan all matter personality   For example Scouters tell walk thru all counters before even picking plate  Meat Heads straight carving table satisfy carnivorous cravings money's worth   Aristocrats start courses  maybe hearty salad soup round 1 followed protein carbs round 2 finished off nicely dessert coffee round 3   But personally fall firmly into Forager camp  am curious variety  need try many tastes order feel trip buffet success   Therefore start end plate literally take just spoonful each item remotely catches interest  sit down  plate looks something A small helping greens typical salad toppings two pieces sushi spoonful garlic mashed potatoes beef enchilada two small spoonfuls lamb curry spoon basmati rice some blueberries spoon Mediteranean pasta salad slice lamb some mint jelly   To untrained eye plate looks mess buffet novice however order chaos  all portion control  maybe two bites everything  Then back try other things more items loved first round   I'd say sample least 80% Aria's buffet way  favorites 1 Leg lamb carving station 2 NY Strip carving station 3 Shrimp Cocktail 4 Freshly made garlic naan they even tandoori oven counter! 5 Lychee scallop coconut salad 6 Crab Legs I can't eat them but everyone table said great 7 Creme Brulee  Things didn't like 1 sub par sushi 2 beef enchilada 3 dulce leche dessert 4 enough labels food was eating lamb curry beef curry? Another part plan sure brunch  $26 tax before 4 p m  prices rises $30+ dinner  <EOR> We bc highly rated TripAdvisor   Should've listened YELP    So many buffets choose comparable price $40 Como's Wicked Spoon Encore's  pales comparison  line seems always really long except random hours aren't usually when people eat reading all crab but where most disappointed and entire Yelp Star off crab snow king served cut half length wise which means you're getting little shards meat those heavenly huge chunks when crack yourself  also serve cold read completely frozen steamed limp soggy gross Huge selection if your goal stuff your face you're all set you'll heaven  but if your goal taste really well done versions international foods  then your place Sushi sashimi terrible <EOR> I really looking forward eating since most buffets newer hotels pretty snazzy  Boy wrong   The line moved pretty fast which definite plus buffet strip  Lunch price $26 per person Tuesday  Eeks! My initial judgement nearly bog buffet line other price comparable hotels  8 I know seems lot but really isn't stations  Although really dug crab legs included regular buffet everything else mediocre best  came around 1 pm which pretty much prime time lunch but everything trays looked quite some time under those heat lamps thus making everything look old unappetizing  made 4 plates trying something liked but ended leaving 80% each uneaten  Service ok and even tipped 20% advance something regret but drink glasses tiny definitely should checked more 2 times hour half   I tried eat worth dessert but failed attempt every category except gelato bar   I would probably never return again would rather shell couple more bucks better buffet hotels next door  <EOR> Ate Aria buffet twice weekend them comped stay   Dinner ok   busy Friday night seemed good sitting around bit   Chinese food bad seafood ok meat station good desserts   Three stars all way     Brunch better   Busier food seemed fresher quicker turnover   Coffee good pastries well  Meat station good again   I'd say  3 1 2 stars brunch   Overall best buffet   Both caesars wynn better but if staying Aria would decent choice breakfast Brunch  <EOR> I other buffet Vegas but buffet few selections food freash  <EOR> I buffet when newly renovated thought great buffet  food good service great  However when past July quality food very disappointing  crab legs steamed well swimming pool water time station prime rib overdone told didn't anything rare side  However service still great waiter very attentive friendly pastries still great  <EOR> Aria's buffet used #1 buffet Strip all major ones minus Bachannal  However gradually going downhill past two years point wouldn't ever pay eat here  would only eat when could use myVegas rewards  If pay buffet I'd much rather Bellagio's buffet which now become #1 choice  <EOR> I am going rather harsh review although definite redeeming qualities buffet   cousin friend recently visited Vegas quick trip   We decided only buffet  usually Buffet Bellagio but thought give Aria shot since new hotel all   Like everything else Aria beautifully decorated modern touches   waitress attentive crowds weren't bad   Now into ONLY reason why two star review Holy s**t balls sushi   if first grader making sushi rice first time   hard under cooked sticky all sushi rice suppose be   No should forced eat things your bowels run Niagara Falls rain   no good restaurant should even audacity serve something that   On why star review Prime Rib cooked perfection Pasta bar super nice chef ready take your order  He also good basic pastas  Dessert bar die for Creme Brulee Ice Cream Bar Crisp on the outside soft on the inside cookies  more Creme Brulee Oreo Pudding Shooters Tropical Carrot Cake did mention Creme Brulee   I don't care Alaskan King Crab legs but those well   didn't any Mexican Indian wares since know those cheap when home   mean chips salsa guac Mexican   Really?  weekday dinner where spend thirty dollars good meal money should just gone sit down restaurant prix fixe meal   probably would more satisfying  <EOR> Since love stay Aria whenever visit Vegas decided give place try  mean why not?? Aria giving credit towards buffet!   Although love Aria comfy beds customer service    buffet best  If didn't credit buffet    most likely won't paying eating here  Unless am super hungry intoxicated am able drive anywhere else    then probably would pay eat there  <EOR> We Christmas eve dinner  first choice Bacchanal but wait 3 5 hours! waited line 30 minutes $47 person  buffet smaller side but lot good food choose from  There's huge seafood bar which king crab legs snow crab legs oysters mussels shrimp ceviche salmon tuna poke cioppino  There's also small cheese station pasta station asian station meat station  favorites king crab legs har gow dim sum salmon tuna poke prime rib cheesecake  Aria buffet also extensive dessert bar  love panna cotta cookies!

P S  Aria thursday sure if amp bit extra food higher prices weekends most strip buffets seem that  <EOR> We weren't sure if wanted try Arias Sunday Brunch when love Bellagio's buffet much but decided try since loved stay Aria   The Yelp's all over place wasn't sure believe   Here real deal Perspective Bellagio's brunch buffet 5x better  Wynn 2x better Paris same   Aria's good but even close  Less selection less variety glamorous looking etc  example cheese area consisted 2 yes 2 kinds cheese   Swiss Cheddar   really??

Aria bit disappointing hoping quality better  However now know recommending food spots one  WORTH PRICE  <EOR> This great experience  did bottomless mimosa bloody mary option took advantage which waiter seemed absolutely fine he didn't rush all even though must few hours large group fairly demanding a post vegas brunch obviously requiring tricky balance four beverages once coffee water alcoholic beverage diet coke etc    Buffet options great especially loved garlic naan chow fun     Dessert also delicious various kinds gelato toppings dozens kinds pastries cakes cookies including cake pops apple pie  <EOR> This great buffet place great warm crab legs  Many food selections  Also children under 12 eat free  <EOR> It could better could worse   I see  newly renovated buffet Aria last week  did good job remodel  place more friendly but also more upscale  food easier access   The menu dramatically different before but some new additions  appeared doing best copy buffet Cosmopolitan Hotel    There nice wide selection  problem? 50% things selected downright cold lukewarm maybe tepid  other 50% ranged warm almost hot   It appears possible at least Aria serve hot food buffet    The prices line other upscale buffets area  food while cold did very nice flavors  chef knows he she doing  some very nuanced dishes very sophisticated buffet    I give another try but if can't sort cold food problem next time visit wallet moving other 100 buffets Vegas  <EOR> Why 2 star wack? Well 1st all dim sum raved previous review gone tumbling downhill   first bite har gow I 5    I grimaced thought what? surreptitiously spit out   said no shrimp it! onto next one   that must mistake course  Har gow #2    what    ?!!  spit out    less surreptitiously  time poked tried assess going on  tasted shrimp seafood   but completely shrimp seemed mealy  Well two must overcooked surmised  Onto #3     gag  What? time dissected thing only thing could think mashed shrimp fish cake fish ball? #4 same   I couldn't even #5  way har gow disappearing off buffett last time  Aria definitely saved money preparing way   please don't call har gow!  The seafood saves buffet though  chowed down snow crab legs which surprisingly tasty small were   not salty seemingly fresh  also feasted well prepared shrimp clams mussels  even crawfish mudbugs say down Louisiana  splurged all drink package 13 bucks    quite deal but does take little while your beverages    While still think better seafood selections sure would return knowing cheapened har gow  <EOR> I start off saying    $84 two Sunday brunch buffets bottomless mimosas    holy shit!  told brunch good friend thought we'd wait until Sunday before left indulge  checked brunch pricing Friday but didn't realize such significant price difference between Fridays brunch Sunday's   am willing pay good amount bottomless mimosas but bottomless mimosas only $6 each   Two brunch buffets $72?  Wow shame paying that   say made sure monies worth buffet those mimosas! The buffet well stocked but nothing irresistible   little everything    omelet bar a brunch staple pancakes waffles French toast all eggs bacon sausage could ask for   buffet salad bar little Mexican food little Chinese food some sushi touch Italian   dessert bar adorned beautiful confections various types gelato   real star show crab legs   Mounded high fresh picked corn farmer's market crab plentiful   Served drawn butter lemon wedges chilled delicious   only thing lacking    little crab fork  Our plates cleared quickly server friendly generous mimosa refills   ate weight crab legs drank many mimosas could put away   solid 3 1 2 stars I'd give buffet   may back some day! <EOR> I lunch earlier week food extremely average  Buffet priced same Wynn Bellagio Caesar's however falls below expectations when compared those resorts  selections limited completely misses Las Vegas WOW factor  best part buffet seafood section however fish selections overcooked perhaps dried out  <EOR> Not lot variety but quality food great  guess its better quality control serve bunch crap some people eat anything just moneys worth  Everything fresh gourmet  little disappointed small dessert selection but flan incredibly good! waitress also very nice urged friend chug champagne she pour some more! Ahaha nothing funnier 40 year old asian lady saying down down it  I'd definitely come back buffet next time stay ARIA  <EOR> Came few times over years but again today must say quality variety food downgraded  little over priced but still much better option many other buffets equal price   The best part buffet Mediterranean option Mexican  Other same stuff find every buffet  desert bar good all! Literally all  <EOR> We arrived 7 35 waited line well over hour  Finally table buffet  pasta station ran clean pots used same pot over over again pasta tasted everyone else's  eat seafood pasta tastes seafood ran chicken pasta  food all over floors  chair sitting unsafe wobbly  poor lady sitting across table chair break leg fell off she tumbled ground  Nothing labeled if food allergy your own figure might eating  worth price wait  <EOR> The Aria Buffet excellent those want taste fine restaurant but also want ease assortment find buffet  stations manned exceptional number employees always stock items  your chance pair foods tastes  example Spanish rice cilantro salmon seafood section  also 3 different types crab legs! don't usually eat pie but when saw apple pie next assortment ice cream flavors just dessert    The only thing little pricey end came $80 two but you're Aria did expect? <EOR> Worst meal Vegas far  lot variety cuisine but all subpar  flavor missing all food room temperature  If am going pay $80 buffet 2 expect high quality would specialty restaurant  Also took already 20 minutes seated  good lunch experience  <EOR> I eaten many buffets Las Vegas Around World!  It OK Little pricey presentation looked pretty seemed fine dining buffet style but buffet actually small items pick from!  The food some great tastes but all great!  There many better buffets Las Vegas   Examples are Cosmo Wicked Spoon Bellagio M Casino Buffet Caesars Palace few Yum Yum Yum them all!  I recommend Buffet Aria <EOR> My husband did Aria buffet breakfast  cost $14 99 per person  cheaper breakfast buffets but think money's worth    The ham moist tender bacon crisp  loved smoked fish section   three different kinds addition anchovies  Delicious!   There 5 different flavors cream cheese  Many buffets just serve those little prepackaged Philly cream cheese containers  cream cheese chives bagel smoked salmon capers  Wonderful    They section pizza   even breakfast pizza breakfast sausage egg  didn't eat pizza but looked popular option many guests    There omelet station good selection fruit  orange juice did taste fresh squeezed but coffee tasty    We also enjoyed selection coffee cakes muffins  Good stuff    We'll definitely back  <EOR> I breakfast buffet which $20  sounds lot except if Aria Cafe simple breakfast food drink almost $20  $20 buffet pretty reasonable neighborhood    The breakfast buffet usual barnyard massacre meat items most which pretty good  also lighter fruit vegetable selections cereals etc  but you're Vegas live little   What lot people don't buffet all items good all items like  worst buffet reviews variations The buffet 115 items but giving two stars because potato salad sucked! Hmmm    buffet 115 items which hated item sucks? worse going regular restaurant where order item roll dice item?

If play myVegas there's bogo deal  Oh spend extra 12 99 bottomless drinks  ample amount alcohol worth money  dinner buffet tonight Monday 34 99 per person plus drinks  Happy eating! <EOR> You would expect newest mega resort $30 for dinner would truly something  disappointment!!! food sub par variety limited  best thing menu crap legs sushi saying much  also beef section prime rib beef fajitas Indian section pizza section Chinese food section  use word section very lightly because sections maybe 3 4 different items tops  But taste quality crap! sushi rubbery and tuna black something never seen   4 other people everybody felt just ripped off  Even generally stuff myself buffet proper value but wasn't interested    It might worth mentioning people squirts later night but may hard pin restaurant  But image provides right one   I would recommend going buffet M resort  better quality more items few bucks cheaper   Overall AVOID place roach stand Mexico City!!  Food Quality Taste = 1 Stars Portion Size Given Price = Buffet Price = 1 Stars Service = N A Experience Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 4 Stars <EOR> We did 3p m  weekday dinner time  timing perfect counted both lunch dinner stuffed  There's sign says limit your eating 2 hours your stay 3 hours   very good lots choices pizza Mexican Indian food wish spicy ways let others spice Chinese limited sushi crab legs peel and eat shrimp carving stations turkey ham beef steamship  salad bar very impressive read other places very little fixings salad buffets main reason chose eat Aria's buffet  salad bar did disappoint even pre made wedges chopped steak salads  Lots fresh fruit options  Oh dessert selection impressive  WHEEL gelato pistachio personal favorite coconut mango mainstays  creamy!

<EOR> I going give 4 stars because Aria comped but instead give 3 which would felt if paid  buffet Aria solid buffet option should checked if you're staying hotel    My girlfriend parents checked buffet Sunday champagne brunch  food good service wasn't good though  waiter enjoyed talking flight attendant mother recent Steven Slater incident but he didn't see much need refill drinks  came point where gave Dad cup coffee he gave didn't order Dad could second cup  We're happy socialize discuss issues day staff part fun Vegas interacting anyone everyone around but still job do    Things enjoyed breakfast burritos ice cream biscuits cheese blintzes Grand Marnier Creme Puff dessert all very yummy  thought very cool desserts artfully presented  other people couldn't find crab legs? couldn't you? stacks stacks them around  champagne decent too    The atmosphere place unlike buffet Mirage my personal favorite   bright colors open design  walls did feel somewhat sparse but thought color scheme well done  buffet should refreshing colors decor help your mind off overstuffed feeling when leaving   Check if you're heading Aria! <EOR> Really dont know why place only 3 stars   hate comparing but seriously if place still best   specially crab legs   price reasonable   guys waiting for? go   <EOR> I lunch surprise actually pretty good lots great selection  unlimited crab legs!

Plus 18% gratuity parties over 8  saw server twice  chase people down drinks  food mediocre best better microwave tv dinners The only thing enjoyed coffee end    If you're looking disappointing meal try McDonald's instead least you're only paying $6 bad meal instead $50  <EOR> I don't buffets   There    said it   Long lines  Mediocre food  IKEA tables   why review Aria's buffet?  Because want   America pal   also visited several buffets while recent trip so    give worthless feedback   I tried lunch buffet Caesars Cosmo Aria M Resort   far worst buffet ever visited   Every dish overcooked   steak impossible cut   Bland flavors   did Indian food    which ok but man    couldn't fast enough   Even desserts crappy    which usually pretty hard mess up   If you're staying Aria offer free pass    skip it   Would back?  couldn't pay eat here  Ok could    but still  <EOR> MUCH better second time around   definitely worked lot kinks service  <EOR> The price pay good worth don't many foods such steak on  recommend Venetian Caesars <EOR> We Sunday brunch  quite long line when arrived but line moved fast wait only 10 minutes  little over $100 2 but included unlimited drinks package  selection food amazing  ton seafood choices  also Asian Mediterranean Latin American Italian carving station soup salad bar course desserts  favorite Asian station lot awesome dumplings pad thai fried rice stir fry choose from  Italian station pizza meatballs phenomenal  Save room gelato cheesecake! <EOR> The Buffet Aria solid choice when you're hungry aren't quite sure want   reason husband during recent stay Aria    We showed late lunch around 2 30 wasn't line seated immediately   There lot choose from! sampled gnonchi meat tomato sauce several pieces tuna sushi California rolls carnitas vegetarian salad black beans crab legs fresh fruit chocolate cake   husband similar dining experience    Nothing really stood excellent but everything good  atmosphere nice lady cleared plates refreshed drinks top game   I'm sure I'd rushing back any time soon unless stay Aria again  happy tried checked off list ready move on  <EOR> Lots variety  Came little before noon Chef Reinaldo Cruz came took all time needed show safe risky due cross contamination definitely safe due rues binders  He also told something new    only sushi rice sometimes safe due flour based vinegars but seaweed paper nori unsafe well some manufacturers use wheat flour coat nori don't stick! Chef Cruz thank great info your time  Gluten free dessert choices excellent  celiacs safe MUST speak chefs  <EOR> The reason gets 4 stars used myvegas points don't wait line  Love plugging facebook game wastes 200 hours time free buffet playing it!! Actually more think would probably give 4 stars even without myvegas but  would never pay full price buffet  Its missing couple things put elite lets gain 40lbs night level   starving golf  tried lot things!  loved  prime rib cut crab legs! enjoyed chicken carving station well   sushi selections awful  Italian station some great meats loved mushrooms  mahi mahi very good  Loved sauce in  cant stand most Indian food avoided area didn't want curry myself away bag  Asian noodles decent  service very attentive  Drinks always filled plates quickly grabbed  Overall would definitely come again probably waste more time facebook building another free meal!! <EOR> So disappointed buffet  stayed Aria last trip Vegas which only reason dined twice  Selection minimal par Aria seems attempting quality  only other buffet ate Vegas Bellagio really did Aria  say staff servers all very friendly just disappointed quality standard even minimal buffet selection  <EOR> What's Vegas trip without visit buffet? Buffets Vegas sometimes cost around $60 stoked 1 only around $40 person dinner+ 18% gratuity bigger groups  man front cashier super rude short when explaining pricing worked  waiter however SUPER sweet kind  menu outside said they'd ramen but didn't see any inside buffet  crab pieces small compared other buffets  ice cream quality isn't good  tried coconut tasted very artificial    Things did like 1  Thai tea  2  grapefruit juice  3  watermelon lime juice  4  seafood curry dish  5  no wait  6  variety ex naan curry sushi pho prime rib paella pizza The food overall okay  definitely better buffets Vegas but all steeper cost  <EOR> um no thanks  expensive worth it  don't waste your money buffet  food selection boring mostly flavorless opinion would rather pay same price exciting meal restaurant  upside though   bottomless mimosas champagne additional charge  <EOR> Weekday morning breakfast buffets $17 99 shabby!    Keep mind around 10 30AM hit breakfast well lunch items   If decide earlier may end running things eat   love variety huge bonus   lunch items come 11 00AM everything freshly prepared hot   Tips Go warm hot snow crab legs much better cold ones Clam chowder great put some freshly cooked clams another section buffet too   They're big pot  They congee add preserved eggs bbq pork Fresh naan bread made front you The dessert section big variety sugarless items Loved gelato sorbets Washrooms located inside restaurant less walking <EOR> The selection solid  much variety compared other ones  However place thing love eat      King Crab legs  swore all ate here  tri tip pretty good well  However asides those two selection everything else pretty mediocre  If want King Crab legs come if then recommend somewhere else  <EOR> Lots seafood!

Well we're already lazy anywhere else     The waitress came over took drink orders 20 people    asked special guava passion fruit drink friend raved when first opened   She said stopped serving because some people allergic it  ALLERGIC guava? didn't believe BS  1 star    Now food   Presentation nice   Cooked food look decent   favorite sauteed scallops chinese broccoli   Crabs legs disappointment  1  fresh can't compare M Resort Wynn   Sushi section looked very scary  1  should ashamed themselves calling sushi  Dessert section really good   Tried 6 different ones all excellent +1      Looked over kids' plates saw most expensive french fries chicken nuggets ever paid for  1 star  Will try buffet again unless comped  <EOR> This buffet exceptional both times during brunch past week  husband impressed quality abundance choices  service exactly would expect buffet  Servers adequately attentive refilling drinks etc  If back Vegas stayed Aria again would certainly eat again  <EOR> This first buffet LV let tell everything absolutely WONDERFUL  staff food all good  Way better Bellagio! Must go! THANKS ARIA  <EOR> I brunch buffet thought excellent liked eggs Benedict added guacamole  pizza good too   I didn't try Chinese station India Middle Eastern station <EOR> REVIEW LUNCH Beautiful area refreshing colors view pool diverse selection food +The areas roughly divided into JAPANESE CHINESE MEDITERRANEAN ITALIAN  Other features include bread carving dessert vegetable seafood section       + mussels shrimp crab legs clams available      + reconmand SALMON STEAK which piece salmon cooked through open fire leaving pink center     + Vegetable section beautifully vegetable appetizers also some classic salads goat cheese pumpkin candied pecans      + Carving section labeled very clearly making ordering process rather difficult  <EOR> I definitely wouldn't mind eating buffet again  Price food combo pretty good!  top choices King Crab Legs Chicken Curry fresh Garlic Naan Dessert Bar french macaroons Creme Brulee etc just name few    *tip some crab legs salty instead getting all bloated eating just handfull salty king crab legs dunk meat some water some salt off suddenly meat becomes incredibly sweet NOM NOM NOM !  If you're fan lobster buffet does come order maine lobster 1 order per 2 people also you're dinner comes house wine white red though friends wine said pretty rank All other food wasn't bad just memorable  However there's no long wait dinner which plus! only gripe dinner could find waitress take drink order  cups empty w o returning check few times  <EOR> Even bit disappointed given nice hotel but is   Came more convenience didn't want keep looking but point wasn't aware Wicked Spoon but digress   Another justifiable reason no lineups 5 30pm Monday easy breezin   Glad crab legs plump prime rib mash potatoes but  best part   congee sushi but didn't dare touch that   The desserts bit underwhelming though circular display gelato probably only highlight   Oh creme flan pretty darn good   Nice orange theme going around liked open concept here   But can't really rant rave someone return here   $35 pp  <EOR> Ok scoop buffet pretty good normally opinion but why I'd give them 3 because server took care table very noticably biased towards certain table ignored which larger group but potentially larger payoff end  Tips driving force industry right? Well should motivation but seemed none right off friendly then she acting burden her  Hey working buffet service industry tough but if  choose then wouldn't little bit engaged people service? Ok  minus star   Next food seemed saltier night on  crab legs few time various times started saltier  leaving all legs salt bath take them set time? tandoori chicken used really good where I'd plate chicken  time dry  lamb stew flavorful but lamb dry be  Also swordfish don't started  should let swam free save life kill then kill again over cooked fish  Hargow dumplings mind grew eating them very particular know plenty them since grew helping mom them very bad  refuse swallow bad  texture just off skin tough  Ok enough bad lot good well I'd give positive 3 stars based desert good curry great prime rib tasty ham wasn't salt lick  <EOR> My Wife came early dinner during week encountered only 5 minute wait time very fast!      food really incredible! Fine Dining quality food served buffet style nice range selections Mediterranean Asian Far East American    some stand outs Gelato dessert bar Unlimited Crab Legs!    Beautiful new modern interior best Buffets Las Vegas! <EOR> This place truly horrendous  food bland some salty overall poor quality  beef hard rock paella bland  pastries sour gelato quite frankly disgusting  Save your money somewhere else  place awful  <EOR> Hmm 3 stars? kind surprised because thought better buffets had   I surprised crag legs   straight those breakfast bar amazing   Delicious poached eggs creamiest hollandaise sauce your own omelet station amazing burritos green tortillas I forget made but good much more   prime rib tender asian griller station okay   why easy mess asian food?  bland there   can't remember but mashed potatoes gravy GOOD   would've thought   But couldn't wait through being good girl eating all food hit dessert bar   It truly another level   would main reason spent $25+ dollars freaking buffet   presentation nice   small flan cakes cheesecakes own glass dishes oreo mango various other flavor schooners   lava cake BOMB COM throw some raspberry gelato top surely visit heaven during inevitable food coma   seriously visited bar three times sitting opposite end room    No shame   I would highly recommend but then again sweet tooth willing suck pay $25 satisfy sweet tooth  <EOR> Very very disappointed especially considering amazing Aria whole  came down breakfast around 930 even though practically no line stood around waiting seated nearly ten minutes   From came strange sadly disappointing selection food  eggs top notch but past all downhill  930 morning sure why more ethnic selections breakfast food    The two stars come purely off service alone once actually seated  Perhaps better dinner but whole highly disappointed back  <EOR> Worst buffet ever made vegas  Basically rip off $35 each just straight line selection  Food even great only highlight steak creme brulee unlimited wine  But if you're buffet want various selection food just wine    I don't recommend all especially if you're starving tell they're serving gourmet food most likely thats lie  <EOR> The buffet okay  tried better elsewhere  larger selection ethnic foods  Since hungry little hungover night before anything looks appetizing good   I basically stuck around section all crab legs  Now know eat most  Lol  fresh packed around ice  beauty crab legs wasn't its size but they're already cut half easily consume  Delicious!   Other items tried roasted beef not prime rib roasted chicken smoked salmon spicy tuna sushi roll broccoli pepperoni pizza dim sum sieu mais dumping tossed green Cesar Salad finally fresh fruits   I don't know why call beef roasted beef rather using fancy prime rib  Maybe different area cow? But huge roasted slab meat did look wonderful   But think should let meat absorb marinated flavor bit longer since wasn't flavorful mid cut    Believe aside crab legs probably enjoyed salad fresh fruits most  look fresh indulge  Yep need greens vitamin C    It kind sounds oinker eating much which actually am but really only took small proportion everything try out  Yes stuffed variety   The buffet well kept very clean  wouldn't worry much getting food poisoning since deal huge volumes  probability something getting spoiled rare   Again food mediocre  But come enjoy anyways  nothing beats free comp meal   Haha  <EOR> I excited trying buffet really modern cool Aria hotel   description  suggested gourmet buffet but nothing experienced even close just plain good food   If vegetarian real trouble except just plain salad   Most items don't give clue contents Vegan vegetarian gluten free    Even deserts blah  <EOR> I'm huge fan buffets   tend think waste money little amounts food eat   But Buffet Aria pretty good   There's good selection food not big some other buffet spots Vegas    even already peeled shrimp!  Most buffets don't peeled shrimp but place does     Two downfalls Buffet 1  Price   believe $25 pp just lunch alone     2  hate Aria's pool right next Buffet   don't feel seeing people walk pool better  yet wring dry bathing suits next place am eating   least should landscape better maybe some trees high shrubbery would block view pool???  Just thought  <EOR> Possibly worst buffet ever had   Grilled shrimp tasted charcoal  scallops clam shell gummy tiny   Lobster Bisque must mislabeled wasn't any lobster just bisque   lobster Mac cheese also missing lobster cold   On plus side prime rib good flavor did peanut butter pretzel gelato    so there's that   All all would definitely recommend Aria Buffet  <EOR> Went thanksgiving dinner   little pricey but food good   Lots options something everyone   service good buffet eating area clean modern   food good some turkey juicy prime rib delicious seafood selection outstanding dessert good  <EOR> Food great 30 dollars prime rib fried rice favorites everything great BUT service  Never came collect plates give more water call them over <EOR> Thursday night dinner $34 99  If want lobster $10 more  If want bottomless alcohol $12 99 more  Arriving 7pm wait line least hour  Sighs Food quality average  Choices okay  Didn't really WOW price charge   Food display kind spread no long wait line food  However putting food inside heavy pot    convenience  First lid way heavy hot  Also put down your plate first then open lid food??

Dude where cereal?  I could find until full granddaughter ate ice cream no sugary cereal her  It morning  tremendous abound shell fish  a big mound shrimp crabs  I shell fish but morning  Menudo taste liked canned breakfast champions  The Jamaica juice came powder but good  The 5 stars restaurant cashier waitress The waitress very helpfu  We gave 25 percent tip  She excellent employee <EOR> The food mediocre  nothing impressive  Most food food label didn't match  only reason gave 2 stars because waiter pretty nice fun talk to   However guy door where pay jerk  bottomless deal lady cashier door  But she forgot give wrist bands can't serve drinks without wrist bands   When waited table waitress informed wrist bands  Then front again ask 2 wrist bands receipt hands  lady cashier gone time jerk duty  showed receipts told happened  He looked receipt said only give wrist band bring other party front his  told started eating 30 mins ago didn't even any drinks now want bring other party front when guys forgot give them first place?! answer hey didn't sell ticket problem     Umm thought Vegas all service  understand didn't sell ticket wasn't your fault but work here  supposed solve problem worse just because wasn't your fault  probably would made company come front wrist band he said anything other said us    I am business owner myself know if employees ever such comments he she first let when annual evaluation comes up  making mistakes mentality attitude mistake occurs    To sum 2 things come back  1 food quality does worth price even crab legs lobsters you better quality seafood Costco same price  pay steaks lamb rack well just try Bacchanal Caesar   Noted said food quality  restaurant made feel messy unclean  guess presentation food quality seafood meat  table seafood section appeared very dirty messy  Compare all other buffets Vegas think did bad job presentation clean up  soup always luke warm may because placed further end table walk slow  knows?  Asian food section looks super greasy unappetizing because let food sit forever without stirring over  2 service really left bad taste mouth   I regret didn't name guy front but 11 24 somewhere 6pm 8pm  older Asian lady cashier very nice jerk might taking over shift  <EOR> Solid 4 star dinner buffet here   Came Monday evening no wait   Staff friendly courteous   We opted unlimited booze package 2 additional $19 99   rum punch cranberry spritzer pretty good!  We both enjoyed food selection here   may vast variety other popular buffets but liked did offer well executed   My favorite Indian chicken curry naan bread   build your own pho pretty good too   We'll definitely come back! <EOR> Let first say buffet wasn't horrible but wasn't great   Me family came weekend lunch prices stemmed normal Vegas buffet  selection okay but those really unique foods other unique foods Wicked Spoon  Once he ate food didn't know if good bad  mix it  Also let say service good buffet seemed clean   Conclusion I really don't recommend coming buffet Aria but there's also many other restaurants Aria  <EOR> The best Breakfast Place hte Strip! Recepies state art! If kashi oatmeals crapes tartalets strongly suggest ckeck place out! While writing home still some sort sensation taste buds awake  used fan Wynn morning sessions now beteween Aria Wynn  Delicious tempting all say! <EOR> Take review seasoned veteran Vegas buffets   $19 99 weekday lunch buffet Aria favorite buffet Vegas ever   Yes somehow wifey ended Vegas again bro i l 's ie wife's brother husband sister wedding SoCal   stayed Aria ate lunch buffet whim because didn't feel walking around 100+ degree weather outside 38C all metric people       King Crab legs prime rib pasta omelette stations sushi rolls few pieces nigiri desserts Jean Phillipe more LUNCH   But station put buffet experience over top Chinese station   Yes believe Chinese food station Aria's buffet excellent   fresh salty no taste aftertaste madison square garden oily   best Chinese buffet bar none   I don't plan going back Lost Wages while   But next time eating again  <EOR> Honestly if weren't free dinner buffet comps would never eat here   fact if paid I'd probably ask money back only because food just old dry nasty   mean would think ARIA all places would nice buffet but don't  Indian curries all watery spices naan old stale seafood old nasty crab legs latin super salty salad bar pathetic italian dried spaghetti noodles super greasy pizza desserts appetizing  old cookies   only memorable item gelato dinner roll pepperoni pizza    Again free wanted try once  sure what's worse    Buffet ARIA Mirage Buffet     both suck    I'd highly recommend Bayside Buffet at Mandalay over garbage   If money problem Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's because worth every dollar! <EOR> Along complimentary stay hotel also complimentary buffet Aria!  I think pretty overpriced but cares comp!   The food pretty delicious! much selection most buffets but do!  The prime rib very tender juicy   Carb legs sweet juicy!  The lobster okay The sautee veggies amazing! lot taste it!   I didn't try desserts hubby made stay away lol  <EOR> A nice buffet packed other buffets nice range food items   food good atmosphere laid back   hidden away bit located near pool entrance   place bright lot windows unlike other Vegas buffets   selection food good  seemed wider choice different food other buffets  meat selection good   mildly surprised non meat choices available   dessert selection OK but surprised see popcorn buffet dessert bar  <EOR> Monday visit right 12 50 pm  first time last visiting Aria buffet  waited approximately 45 minutes time entered line seated  wait time expected    The waitress received drink order immediately following when seated  waitress came back 7 minutes later asked again would drink  Another 3 minutes passed until water served  She did however bring two them helpful   I tried sample portion each these  Aside shrimp crab legs claws which several of    The rest reviewers correct description hot crab legs cold ones  very watery flavor ehhhh  cooked chilled shrimp perfectly cooked shell pre sliced mud vein easy access  wasn't any boil mix added could taste    The crawfish part every single buffet ever to  Bland overcooked dead ones cooked well definitely presoaked them purge  zero boil mix added them flavor  extremely muddy flavored  really don't understand many restaurants manage screw something which easily made taking extra hour time prepare  difference between all seem few extra steps time takes prepare them properly night day flavor  Oh well always people Louisiana excellent crawfish  corn cob overcooked also very little flavor    The chorizo sausage chicken jalapeño sausage extremely dry    The chicken decent breading but also overcooked    The carved chicken turkey very moist    The cashew chicken made style which if hadn't known would said made someone house restaurant   The broccoli beef grisly worst flavored tasted    The custard bun dough perfectly cooked but very bland custard center    I am sure managed screw apple pie but did  bread pudding well  Both no real flavor definitely didn't much cinnamon much sugar think diabetic bland  first place ever where apple pie below average couldn't finish it  looked added pine nuts into bread pudding    The pot said chicken soup but tasted ground rice water   The lamb ossobuco broth fabulous  But lamb cooked properly tough chewy    Synopsis Even slightly lower price then other casino buffet lunch $25 99 no where worth price  If need foods which prepared no spices few if any dessert which diabetic sugar free tasting food which 15% 25% overcooked seafood which water logged then smash hit you  <EOR> This buffet several higher end selections but feel normal food left out  duck confit sushi crab etc  but nothing just normal  prime rib exceedingly rare yeah yeah know supposed be took forever meat cut  Soda juice included but no wine beer  week night dinner $40 two Mlife coupon  would pretty disappointed if paid full price but B1G1 wasn't bad  <EOR> Not much say mediocre buffet except came room price right   Plenty food but some inedible   Didn't sick though  plus! <EOR> Favorite  Buffet  In  Vegas    I think word best very relative but being opinionated mood seem right now might just say best buffet!   It's clean classy staff all over table Not literally    food best quality found buffet point life  Everything cooked great minutes away food coma assure you  Saying place would huge understatement   I would personally recommend segregating your food cultures as racist might appear simply because involve yourself cultural experience time worth it  <EOR> I would given place four stars but price my bad bro suggested Monte Carlo but Elite Yelper felt compelled try new place    They complimentary lobster which also saved place!!!! <EOR> This buffet place gluten free! asked gluten free when paying she immediately called someone over walked over Chef  He able point all gluten free dishes  gluten free bread all meats except sausage gluten free lots Mediterranean dips plenty seafood options sushi gluten free tamari chef Indian food even desserts!! Creme brûlée marshmallows macaroons oatmeal raisin cookies fresh made gelato  definitely revisit another vacation trip!! <EOR> Food just alright  Came gourmet dinner Friday really didn't setup    Grilled jumbo shrimp scallop half shell didn't wait line served serving  custom made anything  them just put them look stingy    Bone in prime rib won't serve cut near bone even rib itself until certain time 6 7 pm  What's about?!  Sashimi think least display but hard figure it    Even though pay difference gourmet dinner doesn't seem want provide gourmet food  But same time can't exactly say didn't either  <EOR> I'm huge buffet fan but received few complimentary meals Aria's buffet couldn't help but try out   Crab legs carved meats dim sum entire dessert corner    buffet every delicious food could possibly desire  don't understand mediocre reviews all buffet boasts quality quantity! also appreciated huge seating area space between tables can't stand hectic cramped run to another plate ambiance typical buffet  Aria's buffet certainly busy but fortunately didn't feel it   One thing    didn't notice much menu change lunch dinner  recommend skipping inflated evening price arriving before 3 30p  Service slow side kind need seriously flag down waiter drink refill  Overall though very yummy experience without stereotypical buffet atmosphere  <EOR> I felt ripped off even though voucher $33 off per person hotel  just wasn't very appealing  came dinner crab legs everyone talks just weren't enough overcome profound sense meh experienced surveying other options  sushi meh pizza meh Indian food meh gnocchi meh    could on  But won't  Because buffet isn't even worth time extended review  <EOR> Everything looks beautiful feel price worth until bite into food  food such dissapointment would eat free  gelato all dessert horrible  The other restaurants hotel around same price      more less food 2000000× better  Please avoid coming if food snob  hospital food level nasty  <EOR> Why 3 star rating!?!? mean always see why rated way but hindsight    The facility beautiful very wide selection  If crab legs person then place you!!! LOVE crab legs whenever see them tend eat several plates  elaborate legs     very fresh warm  no water leaks them when crack them open  fact hardly anything drips out  All nice warm soft crab meat inside which typical lower end crab leg buffets  also help cutting part crab leg shell very easy break apart meat  made really easy down bunch awesome legs before getting full  know know   biased but if recommend ANY buffet crab leg lovers would HANDS DOWN  As other stuff    decent  Just decent  think why rating dropped little bit here  dessert good but amazing  gelato though  However probably only buffet where technique best flavor failed  ask server favorite flavor most popular flavor  answer Oh    them all! follow question most popular flavor customers he seen all good!        USELESS! LOL  Anyway great place crab leg lovers haha <EOR> The Buffet Aria new favorites  lot same food Bacchanal buffet Caesars but pricey  Caesar's fresh juice crepes made order but if don't care those items think food similar   If local locals discount during week which $30 00 person   good news going during week still serve crab legs during dinner isn't crowded weekend    I liked fact during dinner only crab legs but Pan Roast seafood cooked red broth served rice order  only sprinkle little rice but add more white rice near Pho  Yes also Pho Vietnamese soup those love soup especially chilly weather  Pan Roast nice kick super tasty but think could without pink white seafood block put though   also Cajun type stew corn sausage shrimp pretty good too  Dinner brunch both creative salads choose from  favorites contained plenty mushrooms beets grapefruit   If during brunch favor couple little plates baby clams garlic sauce die for!! Trust me! <EOR> If don't know now   love buffets  most disgusting place world i'd still find something great it  Giving 3 star rating kind stretch but wasn't 2 star bad go    Came lunch buffet last day vegas bit sad heck lot sadder couldnt hit several more buffets but girls gotta party full stomachs + clubbing dress dont really mix  $25 per place wasnt bad food ranging japanese mexican italian   etc  Im assuming buffet before    Things skip sushi rolls    very little emphasis sushi part   actually scratch that   no sushi sight just couple rice rolled seaweed vegetable stuffings  blaaaand  dry  stuck together  disgusting ceviche    smelly little cups seafood vegetables vinegar kimchi    next chinese food section only korean thing there  disappointing  bland  just plain wrong some type nacho    cheese beef salsa   sitting top some corn chips which way turned soggy time scooped some up  Things try omelets    them spot really can't wrong waffles    hated other breakfast items but waffles perfect!! roast meats    selection beef turkey pork  roast beef aju horseradish which best thing dessert    first glance thought huge selection but maybe 6 cakes rest cookies danish  Loved apple pie banana cream pie strawberry cheesecake gelato    lemon sorbet!!  Things eh crab legs    wasn't bad   wasn't good   just meh chinese food    soups  Overall place wasn't horrible but wish i'd gone buffet bellagio mandalay bay  Should've just stuck around dinner another buffet anyway since drive back took 7 freaking hours due serious traffic!! opinion place   skip unless you're getting comped  <EOR> Good buffet several different stations such sliced meats crab legs salad bar omelet stations brunch etc   If large party then good place because there's something everyone     Their dessert station okay bunch mini pies cakes well someone scooping ice cream  Honestly your better off using your calories elsewhere desserts  <EOR> It's 3 5   Location much better most   floor above casino you're going eating smoky venue   Decor newer sleeker   Selection food could wrong but feels smaller most but fine   didn't want more options   least options unique  artichoke dip which bomb poke which great pho which adequate paella which salty    think lot things could salted less since there's salt pepper table   Desserts liked popcorn   Limited fruit selection opinion   ice cream looked good but really sweet added sugar sweet   would describe watery sugar flavor   Super sad most because love ice cream looked great   Line 12 half hour wake Tuesday 1 5 line away cashier     Value BOGO decent   If full price wouldn't okay   Tip mix horchata coffee if horchata coffee which do  <EOR> Short end it Save your money calories time!  I decided use some resort credit place only positive thing say definitely hungry after   First all am huge crab fan  sit hours eating crab  However Aria much other buffet places strip found way totally ruin crab experience me  How? cut crab legs half! Now some probably thinking easier eat   crab eating veteran all does frustrate me  Over years honed skillz cracking pulling 'crab tendons' then freeing huge chunks crab provide great melt your mouth feeling experience  When crab cut half tendon still scrape off  result shredded crab  addition since sliced fashion meat tends dry out    but didn't start reading review pet peeves buffet crab want know Aria Buffet   The buffet pretty looking some other high end buffets strip  Someone else mentioned cafeteria feeling right  intent supposed high end feel but ended feeling sterile hospital sterile   The food mixed bag foods all over world  Asian Mexican Indian they tandoor oven American     along some cut cheeses meats  All food executed poorly  brisket shoe leather tough  come brisket country know brisket presented several hours undercooked  prime rib tender but very flavorful  also would preferred more rare side  already know stance crab legs  tandori chicken forgettable bad thing Indian food   desserts pretty poor I give them pass ice cream gelato sorbet The whole experience made think buffets cruise ships  Cruise ship buffets hit miss but always something tasty eat  once read food budget mass market cruise lines around $7 per person per day pastries breakfast lunch dinner   Considering just forked over $35 meal even more depressed I know resort credit but could eaten another venue credit    Don't started service  All say felt annoyance server  Cmon people smiles free long way!  Not worst strip buffet that Riviera but far off   So   if thinking it   don't  If absolutely need buffet try somewhere else  expensive way feel hungry! <EOR> I actually thought buffet better Bellagio's  definately smaller meat offerings less  loved little taco bowl had  typical food staple every buffet has mashed potatoes Mac cheese salad crab legs  local discount only paid $30 each  Would definately back! <EOR> We chose buffet because great reviews  excited because poke curry crab legs  poke wasn't nice curry good crab legs great  desserts lovely but everything else sub par   bought $20 unlimited drink service but cocktails gross  Thankfully mimosas lovely felt monies worth  <EOR> Really poor customer service food quality   Food 4 10 Slow Service A lot things ran refused more even requesting open another 1 5 hours   Would definitely pick Mirage Buffet over least 7 10 plus they're nicer people cheaper  <EOR> Was told buffet suppose rival wynn bellagio high hopes going in  gourmet dinner night which $38 99 friend decided back downstairs gamble little come right before did lunch dinner swap lunch=19 99    Upon entering see seafood selection giddy  loooked Amazing oysters raw clams HUGE shrimp wynn doesn't even serve shrimp lunch anymore crablegs etc   Walked around saw prime rib Leg lamb all tht good stuff  figured heck just normal lunch should wait till change gourmet dinner  3 45 4 30 made huge mistake selfish guess   only plate seafood thinking time done everything woul swapped  while waited realized everyhing only looks nice looks decieving  oysters clams unfresh very unpleasant seafood taste sashimi sliced paper thin unlike bellagio generous portions   Things started downhill there  slice prime rib wth! took away replaced 2 turkeys leg lamb gone replaced skirt steak  Reallly really overcooked tough skirt steak  even though he said he giving more rare piece    walked around buffet see else changed normal lunch gourmet dinner suprised see everything pretty much stayed same  néed stop rant now still Aria but figured should yelping duties warn others overyhyped overpriced buffet  mean $19 99 isn't bad but don't spend almost $40 dinner  you're pretty much getting same food would gotten MGM double price if want buffet  Wynn Bellagio  yourself pretty decent dinner nice restaurant elsewhere  <EOR> Kept waiting line Buffett entrance 20 minutes     No excuses!!!

Die letzten beiden Punkte ziehen für mich die Bewertung massiv runter  <EOR> Las Vegas known its buffets necessary friends few while town weekend   buffet day before ARIA downright terrible crappy service little variety food tasteless dishes   bar set very low walking into ARIA   Luckily ARIA exceeded expectations!  such better variety favorite part being dim sum Asian selections   also lot delicious seafood options deli standard breakfast among other sections  low point desserts which bit stale flavorless   Overall though glad made least yummy buffet  <EOR> My daughter dined lunch dinner 4 15 cost $26 person  arrived around 2 30pm only able enjoy lunch options also able enjoy dinner options since dinner buffet started 3 00pm  honestly don't understand all bad reviews place loved it! many different options choose all food fresh  array proteins amazing  Best place ate during 4 day stay Vegas  way use Uber Lyft everywhere its way better paying taxi park traffic strip horrible  <EOR> Went first time three years ago just keeps getting better better each year  provide lot uncommon authentic dishes  all tasty see pics fave   $42 dinner definitely splurge but worth every penny food quality! <EOR> Not worth $5 99 let alone $25 99 charge weekday lunch    Empty Friday noon but still hold people front look busy  Service meh  stared tower used plates over 15 minutes lucky bigger table  All servers buffet looked angry hated working probably why food tasted bad   Meat seafood super dry  never knew could steamed crab leg jerky but managed here  Even lamb curry dry its braised liquid    Desserts selection good but nothing really made want second bite   Only good stuff chicharron korean short ribs gelato    One worst Vegas buffets disappointing  <EOR> Long wait!

My second grouse    food labeling    it terrible! food sections particular food section plaque telling all dishes available there  problem sometimes don't know dish what    how putting label front particular dish!!! Ain't brilliant idea!! Example    I picked type salad thinking potato salad    nope turned tuna salad    now if just put label front each dish   would made life much easier!   Also am vegetarian but noticed labeling made very hard tell which dish vegetarian not  Example says vegetable fried rice    but its full pork beef   fabulous Aria!! just ruined some poor vegetarian's day!!  My third grouse    food taste   overall impressed  Yes know its buffet should expect Michelin star rated food honest am not  But expect flavor dishes them taste different! tried almost everything best thing vegetable fried rice Parmesan bread    all which don't need pay $25 bucks for!  My last grouse    variety    Las Vegas buffets famous lavish spreads variety food  felt distinct lack lavishness here  If going less better sure quality food high  Unfortunately Aria fails both variety taste department!  The servers nice dessert bar decent   but  it  if you're looking Vegas buffet don't come save your time money energy walk yourself over Bellagio Wynn yes costs more but least leave feeling full satisfied happy! <EOR> Great service plenty staff very friendly  tried both brunch dinner buffet  more simple Dinner $38 person Saturday night  Includes choice wine lobster    Wide selection food  name few snow crab legs alaskan crab legs shrimp cocktail salmon sushi spicy salmon rolls prime rib roasted lamb pizza pasta chinese food variety different ice cream flavors toppings creme brulee  Brunch $26 person crab legs shrimp cocktail roast beef ham sausage carving stations italian sausage bacon eggs benedict pizza fruits   and much more   Not impressed brunch  ended stomach flu few hours having brunch buffet  felt sick few days  dinner well worth though  <EOR> I could stop eating burger sliders  most amazing sliders     it's must  Love variety desserts slightly pricey but worth it  <EOR> Horrible!! worst service EVER!!  buffet very busy several employees working yet could refill drinks!! dirty plates entire time table   food just ok nothing special worth price!! <EOR> no really expect prime dining when going buffet  certainly not  Still wonder why made there? Probably fixed price $37 per person not cheap but affordable vegas burned mediocre restaurant night before @ $120+ per person   It basically combination savorless cafeteria food calorie galore dish satisfy no other intent stuffing yourself much your $ worth it  But no good  Service below acceptable  atmosphere mix jail cafeteria of think jail cafeteria is economy waiting lounge train station feeding troff people scooters <EOR> Meal day   Came around 4pm no line  sure bring your M life card   I forgot mine could points    The first thing head prime rib  loved it  Juicy moist tender flavorful   it can't any better that  waiter really awesome she quick clearing plates letting know each person gets half lobster  Great lobster  really small though but half lobster good person  crab legs next pit stop  two kinds snow crab legs king crab legs  personally liked king crab legs because bigger sliced half didn't use any tools but fingers take meat out  legs juicy good amount flavor  If much spray some lemon it  Another great part buffet dessert! delicious  wanted everything  bananas foster bread pudding flan some cheesecake  Bread pudding good but expected  truly loved egg part flan but sauce paired it  Why couldn't just normal caramel sauce? But instead orange y flavor  also gelato can't even remember flavor got     Geez fata$$  Whatever every bite food well worth it  would come back sure  Give try     p s  PACE YOURSELF! <EOR> I love buffet here!  Prime Rib Crab Legs BBQ Ribs Oxtail Salmon Poke Shrimps variety different kinds cheeses highlights!

FIRST all place immaculate  Everything really clean which love obviously  love food but really buffet person because kind grimy vibe me  Aria completely different    So brunch consisted omelette station fresh biscuits gravy eggs bacon sausage etc  skip waffles HEAVENLY  determined buffet right time try everything but stuffed myself three four those babies  also crablegs DAYS which also back few times  never eaten much crab life  tasted fresh  Another thing never eat sushi buffet but given clean environment it  Delicious! did disappoint  also Chinese food which absolutely fantastic super greasy  huge cuts BBQ'd pork tri tip all different cuts flavors meat they're steaming hot savory  still salivate thought hah  Another thing really liked some Indian curries chickpea marsala incredible  dessert bar die for  many desserts chose all delightful    Food lovers unite  place definitely worth it  <EOR> There buffets Las Vegas much better this   I'll start advising somewhere else   There international stations choose different dining options  tried pepperoni veggie pizzas which very bland  also wanted try Middle Eastern Mediterranean food am Chaldean but sadly disappointed  hummus rough tabbouleh more brown green  tried curry chicken dish which pretty good but ran quickly never put again time there  same experience mac cheese   which delicious  best thing there  lot desserts choose from  tried mini mint cupcake mini gummy bear strawberry cupcake only cute good too  husband tried cinnamon bread pudding loved he said its best thing he there    The flow pattern odd which made confusing everyone walking around  no order just people aimlessly walking stations your way entire time  Granted understand Vegas busy but other buffets decent flow restaurant allowing people take want wanted walk past didn't keep line moving  People no direction all over place     There long line all times but wait isn't worth you're getting  waitress Danielle brought water coke then disappeared 20 minutes  watched serve attend tables came but even being flagged several times she wouldn't come us  husband asked another server named Samantha start taking care experience little bit better that  Overall wouldn't recommend it  <EOR> I wonderful experience here  brunch which only 16 dollars! chacuterie cheese great shrimp breakfast items salads dessert! All fantastic plus tasted great night drinking <EOR> A decent Place many options which made very hard taste each every item!!   My friends vegetarians unfortunately two veg options entire menu  chef good enough prepare vegetarian dish   The New England clam chowder good  Italian section no pasta varieties!! Lot sea food Less chicken options    If eat any kind meat then very good place  Other try once but definitely worth price if your options limited  <EOR> I through buffet line 5 times  FIVE  Need say more? ALL  SO  GOOD  only advice    and should've thought before hand don't buffet before hitting pool  LOL! <EOR> This buffet your typical fare but crab legs overly salted very fresh    The Asian station pretty decent lot options which far bette just Panda Express style spread including higher quality dim sum pretty good ramen   The carving station  stay away steamship but charred steak which quite tasty <EOR> Not bad  more selections please fancier home town buffet  Food very good though  <EOR> A great selection some hits misses  If food only hot should place would solid 4 stars  number problem most everything cold Luke warm  pork dumplings shrimp crab legs pretty good  price think better choices  server ball really took good care us  <EOR> The food selection dinner amazing! mean first pretty skeptical since price high $40+ person don't differentiate prices kids  Ages 3 below free every age above pays same price  Otherwise happy payed pretty penny able eat dinner  complementary lobster amazing all adults complementary merlot well    I personally enjoyed freshly made naan Indian sort tortilla American side dishes including gluten free baby carrots roasted asparagus Margarita pizza  Lastly dessert selection cakes aren't most buffets presentation gorgeous each cake pie  top buffet general wide selection international foods which really enjoyed  thing though fix your sushi selection sushi lovers please only piece california roll even didn't even really suffice  little disappointed but everything else made it!  In all 4 stars because price pay if you're only 18 years age such myself isn't fully worth it  great time though! server nice mention moist towels which aloe infused reusable very nice touch  <EOR> Experience All Eat Twice!  A friend brunch Aria buffet while visiting trip October 2016    buffet promised brunch style but definitely miss several levels   Although first customers many food items already old inedible   already sitting long reused previous day   selection lacking especially breakfast items such basics scrambled eggs hash browns sausage links etc   won't find any here   lunch side menu basics missing mashed potatoes gravies variety carved meats  Perhaps buffet trying hard cater many different global societies which great but most folks looking basics   The best things made order omelets gelato   My friend actually vomited meal soon left   We'll probably stick Bellagio buffet try Wicked Spoon buffet Cosmo next time visit  <EOR> Date Time Sunday 1 30pm Occasion Sunday Champagne Brunch Party of Two Ordered All you can eat buffet Location Cafeteria ish look but very clean Total incl gratuity $60  Food pretty abundant Chinese Japanese nigiri sushi lots breakfast foods eggs benedict hollandaise scrambled bacon sausage hash browns pizza bar salad bar all fixings soup bar they chicken noodle sweet potatoe bisque meat carving station prime rib turkey ham fresh bacon desserts course seafood section crab legs massive shrimp cocktails   I thought food pretty good all very fresh   If you're huge dessert fan great selection very tasty desserts including beautiful array cookies   mostly stuck crab legs   Worth checking price rather reasonable  <EOR> Starting off pretty pissed off because six guys able cut entire line bribing front desk person $20  Aria's line person cashier ok it  When asked no didn't give any money didn't know cut  Spoke manager  Food ok generally its crappier version M hotel buffet more money  Service good  Line cutting horrible  Not worth price comp but would $36 person   Definitely worth it  <EOR> I used 2 1 lunch reward MyVegas slots Cheaper price! multiple times buffet pretty much average  There's nothing really good except flan there's nothing really bad  all standard stations you'd expect Vegas buffet just without premier foods    I money's worth eating endless snow crab already cut half time efficient! normal crab claws but takes much time open it  If you're those people say but there's more meat claws think again  Although might right eat crab meat lot faster ones already cut open taking time open crab claws  Thus resulting more meat!   The service seemed died   remember having great service last year constant refills check ups  Now chase down someone just more napkins     Despite fall service quality food would probably come back again just crab flan    P s  Caesars Bellagio's buffet all stay flan best here! must compares others  <EOR> The food bland sick eating place never came back first visit  But if desserts guess its ok  <EOR> sorry place good  pros looks clean very good  but bad thing food consstently COLD  everythign seems hot dish actually cold lukewarm  GROSS  best thing place offer bottomless drink service 2 hours think really good prosecco sangria champagne  other place sucks   very clean  if just would sure all items actually hot atleast warm would good  <EOR> Having dragged yet another buffet pleasantly surprised  quality food Buffet ARIA seems much improved perhaps inverse proportion food Buffet Bellagio?   LOCALS DISCOUNT price Gourmet Dinner Fridays through Sundays 3 p m  10 p m  only $30 rather $43   When ate last Sunday night baked salmon entree delicious  Could have been served to you in an actual ARIA restaurant and you would have been happy delicious  also happy fill tasty multi colored beet salad still snappy green beans various other practically healthy vegetable dishes   I thought desserts could better sugar free panna cotta lacking very least sugar cannolis though properly made lemon without chocolate chips needed more ricotta less unidentifiable whipped ricotta substitute   He highly unrefined palate i e  other half disagreed he absolutely delighted rice crispy treats caramel corn   Given Las Vegas buffet requisite hordes recommend arriving early late avoid lines cashier sitting along outside windows avoid general fray  <EOR> Stay Away Stay Away Stay Away!  There's literally 10 better buffets within short distance   NO IDEA could come such lousy buffet such expensive property but shazzam did it   Just good   only reason don't give 1 star because reserve places nearly actually inedible  <EOR> I'm fan but wife not  all standard buffet food plus option having your crab legs steamed many places only cold   pizza very good and coming former NYC area resident   some sushi but made front Bellagio other international options only so so   Service slow refills clear away plates  nice pasta station but many strip ready ton oil pan   For price weekend wouldn't choose over some other places  But among MGM still better ones  <EOR> This buffet very strong food quality comfort  buffet great feel doesnt look buffet when seated see big windows  good good big meat cheese section  However selections fairly limited little smaller compared lot other places see town  deserts excellent though  <EOR> Amazing! best meals ever had  Love crab legs potato dishes shrimp tri tip stuffed cabbage bread pudding name few  second visit delicious remembered  only thing disappointed cupcakes but plenty other dessert options  <EOR> ***For lunch buffet only***  With good reason usually much fan Vegas buffets   However lunchtime gf hungry $100 resort credit use ARIA upscale casino resort   figured Buffet ARIA would safe bet   Unlike most other casinos Buffet ARIA located just off even near casino floor   Instead second floor Promenade level several casino's fine dining restaurants   dining room smaller other buffets yet open well lit natural light coming floor ceiling windows airy but weird almost IKEA design aesthetic   could very wrong last comment but came mind when entered restaurant     The Buffet ARIA offered culinary representation many more popular international cuisines  buffet's major draw seemed Snow Crab legs evidenced crowd diners picking over crab leg offerings vultures over rotting carcass   Sadly crab legs spindly little meat mealy little meat present   selection sushi rolls also failed inspire much faith kitchen rice lacked moisture fillings largely flavorless relying wasabi soy sauce provide entire flavor profile   Despite several other misses all lost buffet   Indian chicken curry actually best tasting chicken curries ever had   seemed possess all hoped Indian spice didn't taste dumbed down Western palates   Chili Verde successful offering chunks pork nicely tender bathing flavorful roasted green chili tomatillo stew   lunch buffet tax two $53   Unfortunately food wasn't quite price tag   Fortunately even though food largely lackluster service spot on   water glasses filled frequency dirty plates never lingered table more minute two     In end only give Buffet ARIA 2 stars food value received but added 1 star solid service   Next time just stick Bellagio buffet skip buffets altogether  <EOR> What's trip Vegas without all eat buffet? Insert random Vegas joke your liking here  $24 brunch $31 unlimited champagne bloody marys Saturday morning   Considerably less selection most other high end hotel buffets but agree Jonathan W you'll pay twice much Wynn Bellagio most likely won't eat double food  place just enough  all usual buffet meats   prime rib ham turkey etc  also chicken rope sausage pretty darn good     No wait Saturday brunch   Oh yes    +1 star   Excellent service   Quick turnaround   No stack empty plates table   Champagne filled before empty   Oh heck yes     +1 star   Really decent crab legs   type loads 10 plates only crab legs doesn't eat anything else but few pretty tasty   Fresh pre split   Oh hell yay a   +1 more star    Desserts   fuggedaboutit   scoop butterfinger gelato it   may off day but considering dessert whore know something wrong if all walked away with  <EOR> Buffet ok close great  Seafood bar but ice cream selection Good! Desert good probably high light meal  <EOR> I thought best buffet price paid   restaurant bright airy plenty room between tables   weekday during lunch place packed  Seafood section Snow Crab Legs Crawfish Mussels Boiled Shrimp Asian section Udon Noodles Sushi Dim Sum surprised see Braised Chicken Feet    also Thai Iced Tea  yum    Mexican section Individual Fish Tacos which very good Deli section Roast Beef Korean Short Ribs very good Roast Chicken Sausages     Desserts highlighted circular Ice Cream Gelato freezer which rotated scooper   Gelatos rich   Meringue Cookies also unique   Good value money  <EOR> So group friends  different buffets Vegas before but since first time no basis comparison mind when reading review   1 price 45$ lunch would 75$ something if half hour later would dinner before but ate both tables 2 queue horrible hour something 3 food quality acceptable few he items big lamb chef cut number pieces wanted raw cooked enough guess many others but desserts YYYAAAMMMMM  The next time Vegas try other ones probably give better view aomparison  <EOR> their strawberry shortcake really good  but everything else expect buffet  <EOR> Not bad $25 99! family dined last day Vegas trip pleasantly surprised selection service   server Linda really nice attentive   definitely enjoyed would back when Vegas  <EOR> This favorite buffet all Vegas  never super crowded pricing bit lower others  But best all food fantastic!

There's also good variety some other Vegas buffets  <EOR> Definitely good experience Aria buffet lunch  selection very minimal wait pretty long really ruin experience chunk msg veggie chow mein  know know probably wisest decision chow mein but again selection really small lunch  chunk msg REALLY bad though  coming back given many other great buffets around  <EOR> Came late dinner Tuesday  Food just average much selection  Even desserts selection much  think brunch selection better dinner  weekday  probably hopefully much more items weekends  <EOR> If looking high class experience Ritz buffet Grand Cayman it  However lot better expected huge variety cuisines would surely fulfill any desire  at least weekend One strange fact noticed seeing breakfast items bit scattered without reason  Why waffles syrup next clam dish  same comment pancakes near carving station  think changed quality food but did leave odd feeling looking around trying sense offerings  <EOR> What happened Aria Buffet?  My partner dined several dozen occasions over past 2+ years seen slowly downhill  MLife Platinum members frequent Aria Casino regularly  Recently just hit or miss   What disappointment Easter Sunday dinner 7 30pm when extra surcharge $47 99 per person plus tax  expecting could little better holiday   Foremost minds decision remove made to order pasta station which partner enjoyed almost every occasion previously  Now its place there's just lonely Pho station which does look appetizing which no orders  confusing exactly even is   The deli meats used include high end selections delicious salami prosciutto  Now looks thin slices turkey ham roast beef  even cut down cheese selection no longer serving mozzarella dried apricots various nuts flatbreads breadsticks which used accompany spread daily basis   The carving station used roasted vegetables carrots onion purple cauliflower butternut squash zucchini  time ONLY yellow zucchini    In addition some favorite classic selections ruined  Mac Cheese now Lobster Mac cheese Plain vegetable fried rice now Shrimp fried rice  vegetarians     The Aria Buffet used amazing great vast selection food  used rave recommend left right  We loved Raspberry Apricot Rugelach dessert station which unfortunately never served anymore   Also during most recent visit partner dessert station chocolate chip cookie  He returned another saw employee taking 10 remaining cookies packing them up  If there's only ten left why allow customers finish them? Very perplexing   My partner actually left hungry because he couldn't find anything appetizing  $200 party four truly felt did money's worth plan returning any time near future  <EOR> forgettable bland  even Chirozzi lacked flavor   Skip Buffet head down something else  <EOR> The new beautiful Aria Hotel just opened Las Vegas  Unfortunately any new hotel lot things working yet unfinished  But overall hotel casino beautifully designed worth visiting  Buffet does distinctive design rest venue its cafeteria layout  Buffet's food very good but expensive compared other hotels weekend brunch buffet costing $30 $5 more champagne  food selection typical but tasty dessert bar being highlight although dessert used frozen strawberries   MAJOR warning if group 8 more add MANDATORY 18% gratuity  strongly disagree since BUFFET  realize large group requires extra attention but since table service basically busing plates beverage service 18% excessive  18% mandatory gratuity brings total champagne brunch cost 10 people $450 tax tip  food good two stars  <EOR> Amazing food personally think best buffet Vegas  little pricy usually skip breakfast just eat breakfast lunch  If Mlife card price isn't bad though plenty variety food  Strongly would recommend buffet lovers! <EOR> Great buffet TONS options  want noodles breakfast? oysters half shell? Pizza? it!   Pretty clean great selection good service short lines       I wish could say more    just really solid buffet! <EOR> For $43 definitely worth it! The only good quality food buffet desert section Italian rest really good I expected more really modern beautiful hotel <EOR> Good great  Mostly bland food exception carved turkey really tasty  <EOR> Not really impressed food quality   standard fare thin crab legs prime rib assorted foods but quality wasn't me   Perhaps am road much become much food critic   Next time use Yelp before selection instead when review  <EOR> Tip waitstaff!! Way overated!!! Desserts good  but Mexican Italian seafood sections sub par Pizza far fresh Prime rib decent  hoping would good Wynn Bellagio  not even close sorry  Better {Circus Circus though} waitress {Debbie} worked hard large table Chinese visitors {6 adults 4 children}had running consumed miles Crab legs needed dishes cleared waved away when she asked if she could them anything else  then spent hour cell phones  I noticed left NO tip  nothing  SHAMEFUL!! She said its ok when asked if left anything  said she just happy job! tipped well   Tip your servers  Geez!!!!! <EOR> In 3 time stay aria try buffet horrible service start person help entrance bad food ok but really expensive  <EOR> I just left Buffet Aria rather playing poker boozing am room sick  because ate much because honestly never eaten little buffet before  am room because food Buffet Aria bad made sick   For starters sat table under light kept going change tables  should known right then trouble    I started Asian section some dim sum  shrimp dumplings chicken pork shu mai wasn't bad but bao hard rock  those may know bao steamed bun chicken pork instead  steamed bun supposed soft but hard didn't even attempt eat it   Then carving station some ham  loves some ham but ham drier napkin  Two bites done that  did some garlic mashed potatoes which actually very good  Hands down best thing entire buffet   Over Mediterranean  section where making fresh naan  Certainly couldn't screw up? Wrong  bite done  salty hell tasted made soy sauce lot it  falafel old stale tasteless   Over Italian station some pasta didn't suck  also some decent salami meats antipasto section   Now time main course CRAB LEGS!! Good size crab legs decent amounts meat but old shells impossible navigate  Made almost impossible meat  few minutes stopped trying   Walked around checked some other stuff  pizza looked decent but pizza Five50 day before wasn't really into pizza again  sushi section but didn't look fresh appealing all decided pass   The redeeming part dessert area  gelato which actually quite good  other desserts looked good well but stomach starting happy because bad everything else was   The waitress asked if everything okay  told food good she said sorry walked away   good your tip  speaking tips sign front suggesting tip18%  Seriously? 18% Buffet where just bring drink clear your plates? usually tip 20% restaurants but buffets 10% tops  Less if tell food sucks just walk away   BTW did mention charge $35 atrocity?!?! Wow    Quite possibly worst meal ever Las Vegas   EVER! Avoid place  many good places eat even consider place option  <EOR> One better buffets vegas opinion nearly pricey buccanal wicked spoon  taste better too   There certainly enough choices please everyone  note yuzu ice cream which rather good commonly found  mussels fresh stone crabs tasty if patience crack eat them  Overall bad experience Vegas buffet  <EOR> Such great buffet   wife them all consistently best all round   Always delicious   Always fresh   sure brunch you'll enjoy giant carrot cake red velvet pancakes <EOR> because lukewarm  neither hot nor cold  am spit mouth  Revelation 3 16 NIV  If wasn't aware above Bible verse God's distaste lukewarm Christians pander World could easily assumed comment food buffet   For past 5 years resident Vegas tried nearly all buffets town including during holidays   Dinner tonight 12 22 15 priced $48 99 person holidays  single entree dish palatable  lamb pork belly poutine pho every dish lukewarm  All meats tough dishes flavorless  don't eat shellfish but mil does  She didn't eat some plate because she said tasted off   Service spotty consistently water piled dirty plates empty table because didn't come often   Bathroom buffet horrendous  Overflowing trash empty soap dispenser sanitary bin stall stuffed lid couldn't shut no paper seat liners terrible smell icing cake   If want pay Wynn prices low tier Stations level food spotty service unkempt restrooms dine Aria  Otherwise stay away whitewashed sepulcher save your money  <EOR> the food just mediocre gelato ice cream good i would recommend place buffet <EOR> Please Tell ready  serve full buffet yet !

Last week random trip Vegas BF stopped Aria check out   scoping interior playing tables slots bit they COOLEST slot machines! decided should probably eat   Neither very hungry didn't want check steakhouse anything    fact didn't even want check buffet   So why ended Buffet no idea   matters did   At 9 30pm Monday night place pretty dead   Apparently last seating 10pm weren't surprised near empty restaurant   But whatever   weren't mood anything special anyway   The cashier front lame   She wasn't rude but she totally disinterested   Then again 30 minutes before closing Monday night blah attitude understandable   But hostess servers?  Super nice friendly!  All throughout meal very attentive refilling every glass even going far bring box tissues I couldn't stop sneezing some reason    The servers behind buffet just friendly taking care explain all various dishes making recommendations   Again 30 minutes before closing Monday night didn't expect excellent food choices   To fair food choices mediocre   Asian section most just whatevers Indian section I didn't try but BF thought pretty stellar Italian section I didn't bother full service pasta station seafood station I didn't near but assume crab bc saw people eating crab legs meat carving station kebab station yadda yadda   Admittedly choices plentiful   However everything available   example kebabs night   Completely understandable   I myself giant hunk prime rib   debated turkey lamb but thought better stuff beef   everything mint jelly horseradish blah blah blah all yummy sides   The salad bar pretty decent too   Here's thing   typical buffet   BUT!!!  QUALITY amazing!  Everything FRESH!!!  Again note 30 minutes before closing Monday night   fresh could food be?  sure lying around all night cooks probably didn't even bother put hearts souls into food   However everything crisp cold hot fresh etc   I don't normally buffets because food tastes old but Buffet food practically tasted made to order!
