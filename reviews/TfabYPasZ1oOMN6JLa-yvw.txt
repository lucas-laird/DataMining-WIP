Can't wait back <EOR> I couldn't leave Sin City without Indian dinner  no Indian spots aware Henderson but logistics visit spend last night few blocks East strip putting close proximity several spots   I chose IP since closest car rental already returned walking it  Plus options highest rating   I Lamb Rogan Josh which menu describes Kashmiri delicacy cooked intensely hot fragrant spices which but did compete well LRJ Philly    I did something called 'Temrin Sauce' very thin wafer type cracker Naan but if you've eaten Indian know brain doesn't  but Temrin Sauce treat t remember   The goin door IP looking repeat LRJ experience Philly could IP's more authentic simply DUH  presence Indian clientele perhaps am more DUH then IP authenticity  When parts again give IP try again <EOR> This second time coming place last  first time waiter rude but chalked maybe he having bad day  now second time  don't mind waiting table but when finally seat don't hand any menus  first gave them benefit maybe super busy but again same server same bad attitude   I find another worker give menus  when server finally came table give water asked lemons mango lassi ordered  waited another good 10 15 mins before having flag server down ask lemons drink  Further more when never came back check table refill waters  Throughout whole meal time servers clearing tables which normal but kicker didn't quite discrete manner slamming cups plates down point where could even conversation    When finally ready boxes check flag down yet again wait another 10 mins boxes when receiving check charged wrong  Big surprise  point only 3 tables including us  weren't short staff all    As food good but nothing can't some other Indian spots great service!   I think only reason why place many stars because closet strip nicer decor  But would give nicer decor better food service place values customers! <EOR> The food delicious  simple order Chana mushroom Marar masala daal tadka  Daal tadka delicious  also ordered samosa those best  place simple decor  menu many vegetarian non vegetarian options serving North Indian South Indian food  service prompt courteous  <EOR> The food good give them but service credibility questionable  Though strongly recommend looking elsewhere Indian food if must check your bill  guys messed bill then refused address saying during holidays  policy is    They also don't take gift cards during holidays apparently all Las Vegas recognizes holidays December 25th through December 31st  Though don't work restaurant industry still work tomorrow    Also took forever take order then forgot ordered take again brought dishes time cause maybe some people cold food?  Either way service being shitty only place  But blatantly cheating customers whole new level shady  good food but if must careful  <EOR> Good food   Fresh naan tandoori chicken   Service real good well   eating lunch won't hungry until breakfast next day  <EOR> The food very good highly recommend mixing sharing some dishes those come with  However must say server pressured lot made eating experience very uncomfortable  reason don't see myself returning another visit  <EOR> try mango lassie   killer but very filling   You'll want second but if you'll never want eat dinner  <EOR> Went today first time left happy   relative newcomer Sin City am always satisfied when try new eatery great results   lunch buffet everything fresh tasty colourful without any nasty aftertaste something experienced other ethnic places    favourite dishes included goat tikka masala saag paneer    the chutney pretty good especially top naan  $12+tax eat fill nicely spiced Indian food heavy flavour light grease   Both vegetarians carnivores plenty options which fill bellies!  plan coming back again soon try dinner menu     <EOR> Best Indian food Vegas  worked Indian restaurants closest business partners Indian  When comes food Indian Vegas look no further India Palace  <EOR> After watching movie Life Pi Blu Ray craving Indian food  Found place thanks Groupon  friend decided hit place she done drunk shopping Fashion Show Mall  LOL   Came around 6 dinner  Right sat down influx customers dinner  Whew  orders didn't wait long  Ordered following Appetizer Combo Samosa Aloo Tikki Veggie Chicken Paneer Pakora  first plate came out  Duh appetizer  pretty decent sharing two people good enough I enjoyed samosa paneer pakora most    Chicken Tikka Masala Fish Tikka Masala plain Basmati Rice  Ok entree where heart somewhat melts  them both medium spicy  much gravy yyy enough meat  Meat gravy ratio 1 3    Bottom line would hit place again but would try lunch buffet  <EOR> We local found place very pleased   most authentic Indian restaurant's find   Chili chicken Butter chicken theeee Best   Customer Service Very friendly staff!!

Well stomach seems think buffet myth applies India Palace  feels ate whole roast pig  just feel awkwardly bloated full eating few vegetarian dishes    I am sure if would come back considering lunch buffet $11 99  waiter also poor listening skills   bill  $25 84   friend $20 Cash card  told waiter bring back $5 change put rest card   Simple enough right?   He put $20 into bill charged $5 84 card! Ay yay yay!! <EOR> Best new place tried while girl bought Groupon tried amazing lunch buffet 11 95  but couldn't use Groupon house special chicken mahtihka  think spelled right  omg good rice garlic nan  heaven   Manny writers sweet cutest little buffet Indian guy ever seen can't wait come bring kids buffet!!! <EOR> Ordered delivery first time tonight via Amazon arrived less hour! ordered paneer pakora garlic naan 2 orders tarka dal mild spice chicken tikka masala medium spice rice 1 order     I loved version paneer pakora included dipping sauces not sure because weren't labeled but delicious!   naan fluffy perfectly cooked not burnt hard stale great flavor  We're normally huge fans chicken tikka masala but safe dish  thought India Palace's CTM really good  sweet much cream  chicken cubed tender white meat  dal good too think next time order increase spice level!

Also mom without knowing rules land asked pickles staff extremely helpful cup full later slipped extra $1 50 when asked why he oh if menu then pay  OK!!! why can't tell first instead slipping problem paying he right but lack customer service ethics just irked me  Buffet reasonably priced enough items improve customer service remember customer breaks your business  Improve flavor don't forget roots dish  know dumbed down cater local tastes but hey if want eat bland food lot cheaper healthier options  <EOR> Excellent capital X  fairly content all Indian food tried Vegas  But somehow India Palace managed blow away   I came finally use long standing Groupon Kris J before he moved town  ordered Saag Paneer Navratan Korma Chicken Makhani  If know all know love Butter Chicken!
