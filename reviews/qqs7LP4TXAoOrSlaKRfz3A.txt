First wine menu!  looking normal bottle under $40 Cabernet Zinfandel  Normally most every restaurant normally visit few offerings price range but here   bottle least expensive wine $52!   wine appreciate good wine  Trader Joe's Lee's regulars know many very tasty under $10 bottles    usually find most restaurants regular 300 400+% markup    and    necessarily appreciate others consider GREAT wine    which guess only choice DW     We just buy $52 bottles wine    nose taste wine just say? educated ?  This deal breaker us   always buy least bottle wine dinner but today settled $13 glass house Cabernet each us   admit house Cab delicious  but think outside strip hotels most ever paid individual glass wine  yeah ok run low end crowd   say That told food delicious!  Everything    appetizers main courses  didn't any deserts but all sound wonderful am sure are  only made more disappointed wine selection   It sounds brunches might best thing hit  We might try sometime  <EOR> I could almost call nice gem suburbs  came lunch Wednesday afternoon friend  Prior coming read some reviews saying sometimes packed even 1pm fairly long wait  Upon arrival actually getting little scared considering park south end parking lot walk over    LUCKILY ! Nope no wait time XD super lucky told friend  called lucky charm P haha   Decor very different  Clean bright yet simple  Bright colors live vegetation live flowers containers filled fruit decor  Different lighting textures  quite nice eyes  Really different you'd usually see traditional restaurant    This restaurant based traditional Jamaican Caribbean flavors New Mexican cuisine  don't know much New Mexican cuisine but remembered Caribbean huge use spice flavors SPICE HEAT! A lot reviews talked New Mexican Style slow cooked pork chicken waffles not traditional chicken but JERK chicken! other things    We seated side room to right upon entry     Super nice waitress briefly described items spicier side but changed if preferred  HECK NO!  bring spice XD ! haha  My friend ordered two things shared off each other's plates  She ordered New Mexican Style slow cooked pork whereas ordered Jamaican curry chicken    I actually amazed portion size  am small eater couldn't even finish half  Ended having box BOTH orders because BOTH only half eaten  shared ! LOL   BOTH served bowl obviously since under DW House Bowls section but best thing    BOTH PIPING HOT ! YES !   New Mexican style slow cooked pork simmered New Mexican red chile two over easy eggs served over rice $12  VERY heavy hearty dish  Comes two? three? small tortillas side  described friend  dish where good nice cold night sitting next fire book   Heavy hearty keep warm through cold night  Good idea right? Perfectly cooked over easy eggs top spilling its rich ooey gooey goodness over slow cooked simmered pork red chile  Spice level mild? bit spice it  Would prefer bit more but wasn't bad was  meat tender pulled apart fairly easily  included small tortillas allow small burrito wraps yourself  Another thing told friend    if only some corn salsa sour cream shredded cheese   would YUMMY burrito ! haha =X   Jamaican curry chicken sauteed seasonal vegetables served over rice couscous $12   In comparison slow cooked pork dish dish light bright  Light curry flavor little no spice but refreshing sauteed seasonal veggies give bright flavor amongst curry taste  pretty good combination  Veggies cubed zucchini green beans two different types mushrooms etc  chicken little overcooked little tough considering white meat well   Still pretty good though  later regretted asking rice over couscous  wonder would couscous  Very curious now    Overall  Pretty good experience  $12 bowl cant even finish? Pretty good ! Flavors good  Would try other things next time    Little additional uhm    thing   haha lack vocab coming head moment     boxes give pack leftovers    STURDY MICROWAVABLE ! super chinese but most likely reusable XD <EOR> OMG!!

This new favorite lunch spot Vegas  Interesting delicious perfect portions bright welcoming atmosphere   Tip owner told don't Lunch Menu Sundays because only serve Brunch  But if know want something lunch menu probably whip anyway  <EOR> This very trendy popular place hard into during peak hours  food good staff very friendly  owner making rounds regulars most time   My favorite dish Jerk Chicken sandwich sweet potato fries but few other dishes great  Sometimes gets loud can't each other talk  feel lot people work medical field since big hospital across street many other medical businesses near by  <EOR> If live other side town DW well worth 25 30 minute drive take there  food service great! I haven't disappointed dish yet  Looking forward trying another dish next visit  <EOR> Eric just driving aimlessly south looking new spot eat  DW Bistro isn't new breakfast over year ago but new Eric never dinner here  don't know dress code but if again would dress smart casual  felt little underdressed atmosphere night went  <EOR> If could give half stars review would more 3 5 straight 3 star review but definitely did deserve four stars because lack flavor entrees  really wish could give four stars because ambiance great but fair fair!   My girlfriend friends dined Friday evening first time  little 9 30 p m  may 2 3 other tables eating few people bar    We opted patio seating one star ambiance     The menu refreshing unique unlike most off the strip restaurants Las Vegas  reminded something would catch Southern California near beach    We started off pesto torte appetizer  menu imagined would bit cheese mixed bit pesto some crackers  However more huge block goat cheese drizzle pesto olive oil few crackers  usually goat cheese cheese general fan but did enjoy flavors  wish more pesto but overall different quite good    I ordered beer braised short ribs girlfriend ordered chicken roasted garlic bowtie pasta friend ordered Jamaican curry bowl  very impressed diversity menu really excited try each dish  However when food arrived bit disappointed  Everything tasted very bland which surprising because menu descriptions lead believe dishes would bursting flavor  not  tasted those old fashioned grandma meals something you'd buffet  Great presentation very generous portions but nothing write home about  dish needed something some type spice salt  chicken pasta tasted box chef neglected add spices garlic when preparing dish  Jamaican curry also tasted bland  Bland flavorless  really upset because high regard due reviews    Also waiter wasn't very attentive  He came back check few times but lot time passed between check ins food sitting table ready taken away least 20 minutes before he did so    Perhaps arrived late night we definitely only people ordering food maybe chefs just checked night  sure    We ordered dessert  girlfriend chocolate cake friend ordered carrot cake  Both moist delicious two stars     Sorry DW Bistro really really wanted love you! Maybe we'll come back another time try Brunch! <EOR> So place second time during Sunday brunch  must say food really good during brunch  wait pretty long come early  staff friendly service point  Jamaican jerk chicken waffles tasty  best chilaquiles super flavor flavorful delicious  Bottomless mimosas can't wrong <EOR> i think called caribbean mojito  wont again   sole  little salty side but good  sister steam pulled lamb  looked pulled pork  really soft  bro law lamb ribs  he them medium rare cooked right  bread lavage nice  didnt really care beer jerk bread  truffle macaroni   BBBB                               CCC                OOO            N        N                                                B       B                       C         C          O         O         NN     N                                                             BBBB                      C                      O              O       N  N   N                                                     B       B      AAAAAA          C         C          O         O         N     NN                                                           BBBB                            CCC                OOO            N        N                                                                   came but wasnt even warm  brought another was    warmer    im used having mac cheese steaming  ordered carrot cake  damn    thing sweet  overall food great    now annoying part  acoustics place weird  ive loud restaurants but acoustics place awkward point getting uncomfortable  didnt help table maybe 10 ladies sitting booth walls curved towards us  when looked around seemed everyone talking normal level tone voice  but much louder seemed  sister said when she came lunch sat corner next bathroom area  if look ceiling its curved downward sloping fashion  she said she could hear people's conversations across room    who designed place? put some foam walls! <EOR> Once again best brunch ever  love all specials try but still order mini corn tortillas because its most delicious small plate ever brunch plate  pastry basket must accompanying fruit cup always great  wife without fail orders whatever eggs benedict special order omelet time steaks eggs  BEST BRUNCH EVER  steak eggs perfect eggs benedict special wife ordered also great  enjoy experience everytime  Its brunch place only ourselves but whenever guests town  Don't miss hard find spectacular restaurant worth trying recommend getting something sounds interesting don't forget special sauces! <EOR> A great neighborhood find!

I see why DW Bistro gets lot love   unique place corner town!  Where else gonna see Jamaica meeting New Mexico cuisine?  rare mix actually works yummy results   According Yelpers joint all rage weekend brunch   Considering sparse choices SW part LV probably point   Me?  don't brunch much   But oxtail?  Yeah sign up!  DW Bistro more half packed Tuesday night good sign   party biggest restaurant far but many other tables capacity well   Looking surroundings no clue Jamaica New Mexico mix   Seems more Asian me!  But nice quaint place   Upon sitting getting drink order straight menu     Yep those know know exactly for   near no brainer   Braised Oxtail $20 veal demi glace mashed potato day    what's up!  couldn't wait this!  patience paid off   dish very yummy!  Oxtail tender juicy savory sticky lips all lovely collagen just way should be!  Veal demi glace really gave good depth flavor kept meat moist while eating through dish   Great oxtail probably simmering better part day or bit cheating pressure cooker    no problem licking up!  only minor gripe dish uninspiring mashed potatoes   dry side expecting more butter cream them well lighter texture rich oxtail   Instead mashed potatoes rather dense   If choice since we're cooking Jamaica   why classic rice beans?  Now we're talking!  Only other complaint portion size big boy looking big boy portion   But money probably right size amount   Wifey ordered Jumbo Shrimp Scampi over Linguini $20 fresh parsley lemon juice crushed chili pepper fresh garlic   tried pretty good but think dish lost translation when trying figure Jamaican New Mexican influence   Tasted pretty much Italian me   liked but really wasn't expecting dish be   spicy though because chili pepper   If Jerk Chicken instead guessing would more influence looking for   But overall still nice entrée     Big plus me?  damn Jamaican Pickapeppa hot sauce!  bomb diggety!  love hot sauce glad DW Bistro added tables   adds sweet heat no other   I'd put stuff Nike preferably non Jordans probably able take bite   little dip oxtail nice real nice     Overall experience DW Bistro excellent food tasty service excellent though tad slow large party setting nice   see place local hangout friends enjoying cocktail   Relaxed but very hopping   Jamaican crazy     Ole! <EOR> Best breakfast LV  Jerk Chicken Waffles New Mexico slow cooked pork omelet Jerk Chicken benedict carrot cake w white chocolate shaving  Everything AMAZING  friend bloody mary bacon tasty too  lines long but worth it  off strip locals all know it  <EOR> Probably eaten eight more times since previous reviews   say? very first place pop into head whenever Sunday brunch nicer lunch works     Brunch fam yesterday dreamy success usual   started DW pastry basket   steal $8  Everything inside warm buttery just darn good Sunday morning blueberry scones turnovers cranberry popovers cinnamon roll chocolate croissant   serve butter scrumptious jelly side     Dad struggles fit gargantuan BLT mouth gracefully but pleased nonetheless   Hubby cleaned plate nicoise salad   tuna looked awesome     I can't believe haven't mentioned very refreshing tasty pomegranate iced tea   lightly sweetened very refreshing   keep your tall pretty glass refilled too!

Of course also tasted fantastic   Definitely new favorite French Toast meal   comes fresh bananas strawberries perfection   toast made Challah bread good getting hungry thinking it    could died happy   Only minor complaint its own dish doesn't come anything savory   few minutes all sweetness bit much   should tried order side bacon egg something   really prefer breakfasts sweet savory french toast scrambled eggs   didn't try order dunno if would but would assume so   Then would perfect   husband same complaint chocolate chip pancakes   good but ended being just much sweetness   Next time we'll try ordering couple sides bacon eggs!

The Bad  took forever find place because no proper signs leading actual store front which made initial impression extremely frustrating   The Ugly  Moving NY Vegas constantly looking great eats  am Philipino husband Jamaican specifically choose restaurant because said specialized carribean cuisine    Hubby ordered coconut cury chicken bowl white washed forgive lack better term but True disappoint Jamaican culture  should atleast advertised Jamaican STYLE curry chicken would least soften blow little bit lol   the portions off such tiny pieces chicken large amounts zucchini rice just terrible chicken star dish all!    I ordered Mexican Pork Bowl dish step away being considered dog food  never dog food but could imagine being equivalent spicy puppy chow  sauce completely overwhelming pork soaked thought bowl spaghetti sauce first glance! overwhelmingness sauce took away any flavor pork even had  Please take dish off menu immediately before someone gets sick!    and add insult injury served 2 flour tortillas cute little fancy basket wasn't even homemade tortillas!!! plated Walmart brand tortilla fancy basket bam! 16 bucks garbage! Smh   I am excellent chef home often cater small events if there's thing know know good food when taste But restaurant disgrace  recommend place anyone until revise quality menu items  more word advice chef owner stick style cuisine master it!

<EOR> We brunch last Saturday based other Yelpers reviews dissapointed    The restraunt tucked little strip mall Southwest part town The decor clean crisp white walls chairs green orange accents  throughout  also fresh flowers each table which nice touch   I little worried service would receive because place definately gives off hipster trendy vibe and am neither but service impecable  server friendly helpful  guy bussed table also very friendly never once ask refill he it   I splurged Challah French Toast $13 fresh strawberries  bread cut thick slices cooked through no soggy bits sometimes happens french toast  best part definately vanilla infused syrup  syrup real vanilla infused really made dish  portion more enough share still left piece plate  also pomegranate iced tea  normally am fan flavored teas but tea delicious!

<EOR> I world renowned chef luckily didn't wait table The owners friendly bringing plate plate delicious food   I cant remember because ALOT place does well all friends love its drive live Lake Las Vegas restaurant Summerlin but remember several items menu very happy The recent time car friend she said pass restaurant dying eat place told already which chef Keller she said always packed  reason restaurant packed because food delicious atmosphere great especially brunch food prepared quite well A recommendation people living Summerlyn but even if live opposite side town deafly worth drive! <EOR> Tried lunch Sunday  ended staying because piano playing loudly no way conversation  looking forward trying food but need change volume music  Bummer <EOR> After reading many reviews very excited try DW Bistro especially since love Caribbean food having traveled Jamaica many times having impressed food there  I'd anticipating eating weeks    I want clear only judge restaurant based three dishes tried  the Jamaican Curry Chicken New Mexican Style Slow Cooked Pork Braised Short Rib all off dinner menu  all know other dishes menu excellent but skeptical based tried  Being 0 3 those dishes suggestive rest menu being far better   This tough review write because owner friendly truly seemed take great care customers' experience  felt say something however many people going try place based its stellar star rating which unfortunately doesn't match quality its food any stretch imagination   If forced come basic summary describe food ate DW Bistro would spicy blandness  All three dishes tried shockingly devoid rich flavor brightness  flavors remarkably bland spiciness does compensate bland flavors    The presentation food quite attractive but say put lipstick pig [you know rest]  case chicken curry presentation over top actually hurt food  don't need flower petals sprinkled all over bad curry  Just give good honest Jamaican curried chicken happy  Putting flower petals assorted vegetables curry only detracts eating experience but even without needless garbage sprinkled over dish phenomenally bland devoid flavor  and say curry fanatic could eat chicken curries every day life happy   The short rib slow cooked pork equally bland flavorless despite attractive presentation   I don't want rip place its very friendly owner without offering some constructive advice  advice if you're reading book trip Jamaica Negril stay cliffs eat myriad hole in the wall restaurants serving stellar Jamaican fare Sips 'n Bites Paco's Three Dives etc  Learn great Caribbean food tastes figure improve quality your food  no flavor!

Then he asked don't spicy food? China? wanted say WTF does anything?? decided keep cool replied no  Finally he suggested Jamaican curry chicken something more mild ordered    Our food took while come but when finally did made everything look pretty  chicken curry wasn't spicy promised  However stingy chicken kind dry  also overboard vegetables  end tired digging through all those veggies just find chicken rice stopped eating  course server made comment saying oh didn't it? Umm does look did?? can't remember friend ordered but he enjoyed food  said am picky  P decided share dessert  friend asked server he recommended he replied Well excellent carrot cake but she looking doesn't carrot cake  smart @ss! Then he looked said right? Lol he right  ordered slice peanut butter pie  took very long time come but delicious highlight meal!! only weird thing put raspberry sauce plate which both agreed wasn't good mix   Would come back again? Probably not  If ever would only dinner! Warning watch smart @ss servers! <EOR> Huge portions great prices delicious food awesome service  Tried whole bunch stuff everything pretty damn tasty  bbq rib app really tender sweet just hint spicy  shrimp chorizo crostini special really tasty plenty large shrimp  jerk chicken salad probably best salads come across orange segments tender chicken macadamia nuts grilled veggies mango vinaigrette   Their entrees humongous could feed two easily  ordered oven roasted jerk pork shoulder bowl which really tasty although would've nice if some veggies included but okay since salad beforehand  also try jamaican curry chicken which delicious curry soup ahi tuna salad grilled jerk chicken breast which came 4 pieces grilled chicken! Honestly nothing mediocre everything under $20 which great deal restaurant quality   Also dessert sampler which included dark chocolate mousse cake red velvet cake lemon lime pudding carrot cake although point all explode  huge dessert person I'd say desserts weakest link BUT still pretty good  cakes themselves bit dry but alleviated frosting   The service phenomenal  Bryce came several times treated questions humor knowledge  server also awesome even other customers restaurant super friendly! Great space great food  Definitely best restaurants Vegas! <EOR> There many non chain Jamaican Caribbean restaurant Las Vegas anywhere USA am glad place though bit drive other side town still come Jerk Chicken braised Ox tail  dessert selection also fantastic  <EOR> Hmmm  back few times since initial review debate myself if really place  food hit miss  dishes hit ballpark amazing flops really flop    I've breakfast brunch well dinner most recent visit less impressed New Mexican style slow cooked pork bowl  flavors just weren't dynamic enough  spicy but bland which seems weird  jerk fried calamari star meal  Just right sweet spicy ratio  enjoyed number breafast dishes previous visits but nothing stood something need come back regularly  Service hit miss visits DW well  Service always friendly but drag times   When someone asks nice brunch spot almost always suggest DW Bistro know back but can't say 5 star experience first visit  <EOR> The food worth hype   I came two friends told wait would 25 30 minutes  waited over hour table but start unlimited mimosas while wait    The food good but again UNLIMITED MIMOSAS    If your friends looking relaxed place brunch suggest DW Bistro  <EOR> Absolutely amazing  Took girlfriend Valentine's Day both first time going  Can't find bad say  We'll definitely back soon! <EOR> Great service  Young hip atmosphere modern decor  Prices little higher expected but still reasonable    You'll pay between $11 $16 your meal  food totally worth though!
