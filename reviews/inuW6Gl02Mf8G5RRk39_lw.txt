When waiter told cook forgot dish several dishes each long wait  finally cancel missing dish because didn't want wait another 10 15 minutes   The decor restaurant somewhat modern  There's private room 20 back attractive wine cellar display room front  bar even looks nice  But don't understand why used cheap mismatched plates utensils? really place feels cheap  But food isn't cheap all  price menu seems average but would order 2 3 plates equivalent portion other restaurants  looked some wine lists  300% markups most bottles  Really   ? Even casinos only 150% markups   To top off evening beware erroneous gratuity charge being included  menu says your convenient gratuity may included your bill  decided add 20%   WTF   ? just wrong     whole experience giving just star      Yelp should 1 2 1 4 star moments this  <EOR> Get off strip venture local recommended restaurant am absolute statements but BEST Thai food ever tasted wouldn't guessed looking outside neighborhood!

Chada Street sees acclaimed chef take aggressive menu items commonly consumed vendors Thailand's street markets results oftentimes resoundingly successful though service still long way go   Elegantly decorated stripmall Spring Mountain bustling plaza unfortunately falling short parking Saturday 7 30pm Chada Street occupies footprint nearly threefold size Bank's original restaurant well appointed bar beneath photographic mural stretching length dining room seating options offered multiple leather clad lounge front perfect relaxation while more proper meal offered amongst low lit tables private room extending back behind all glass wine storage   Prominently featuring Rieslings though certainly lacking well priced spirits sourced around globe menus presented beneath lightly playing tunes Chvrches party seven made selections total twelve plates complimented three more chef's discretion proving adequate amount food all persons present some actually leaving quite stuffed    Noting front waitresses undoubtedly speak better English Thai suffice say language barriers played big part service issues almost moment seats taken despite repeated requests items paced once but twice items returned kitchen drink refills clearly list priorities despite menu's bold spice profile while other oysters pandan custard forgotten until staff reminded   Speaking next quality kitchen should seem obvious such broad menu bound occasionally miss mark but setting aside pork belly surprisingly devoid flavor O Aew more snow cone shaved ice rest cuisine well crafted occasionally quite stunning without once drifting spicy appealing   Doing best experience wide swath Chada Street's cuisine perhaps good fortune opening plates showed most strongly blue tea turned purple addition citrus adequately refreshing palates between bites both housemade  pork sausage duo crabs each boldly flavored nicely presented requested side rice helping sop Sen Mee Kang Pou's sauce while skewers grilled pork would better ordered double allow more sharing   Already seeing 8 top's capacity likely challenged sizable service plates portions defying low costs mere moments round two more curries presented slightly overcooked pork shank also allowed delivered while four more plates refused then sent back once more reprepared just ten minutes later crispy skinned fowl pork pool spicy pineapple broth could properly savored   No doubt attuned recipes Atcharawan's spicier plates saved until later meal light tingle crab duck sill lingering lips oft raved larb presented 'hot' some even though requested medium both flavor texture indeed excellent catfish chili paste equally praiseworthy while crisp chicken wings little lost flavor presume numbing spice mixed tamarind    Passing durian based desserts modestly amused mix ins beneath aforementioned 'shaved ice ' perhaps 'lucky' double order warm bread beneath sweet custard reminiscing Ghostbusters brought forth singular since several group already topped off duo honey toasts forgivingly smaller those Hachi Izakaya undoubtedly benefited more honey creamier ice cream   ****Still finding its footing front house lagging behind skills those stoves Chada Street welcome addition genre seen great growth since Lotus Siam became destination  <EOR> Wow really good Thai food decent price  pad Thai 8 95 larb 9 95 did disappoint  Flavor packed some best Thai food vegas  open till really late definitely coming late night snack  <EOR>     owner Chada Street considered many cognosenti white wine world which course well most Asain food   so   stopped lunch recently ordered glass white wine  which served ICE COLD   for those dont know ultimate faux pas trick many use hide taste poor quality wine   hmmm   that said food decent but found interesting lunch no lunch specials   everything priced high end   and place supposed focus STREET food found interesting   perhaps thats why place almost empty     <EOR> This restaurant serves Thai food influence street food you'd find Thailand  especially love fact incorporated theme decor  love all wooden accents around walls use silver metal cups your waters but also nice little cocktail area white couches 21+ only   I've eaten twice first dinner more recently lunch  First time ate very impressed interior affordable prices were  ordered appetizer two entrees around $25  waitress also very welcoming attentive  Food delicious rightly portioned weren't uncomfortably full dissatisfied    But more recently came during lunch break around 2pm Thursday  little disappointed visit but enough want come back  First all found any lunch specials everything's same price lunch dinner  disappointing  close 3 lunch reopen again dinner around 5  waitress polite but could sense she rush soon possible  Also towards end meal declined offer more water finished she came back 5 minutes later poured more water which would've fine if wasn't fact water pitcher she picked table sitting next they've entire meal  lastly noticed sat older couple next menu cutlery all    getting leave waitress tells them closing soon asked if they'd order instead  felt really unprofessional seat your customers them expect served food only told never mind    All in all nice restaurant delicious affordable food    Just don't during lunch hours  <EOR> This place amazing  group friends ate almost half
