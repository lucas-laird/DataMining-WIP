Walked said we're making everything fresh? isn't everything suppose fresh?? already seen 6 cars later food good down drive thru! Bad service!!! Drive rainbow if want Mcdonalds <EOR> It took 15 minuets through drive thru tonight  All order 20 piece nuggets  didn't salads apple pies available  drive thru use ok but notice problems slow service mixed orders over last few months  <EOR> The workers young understand but didn't give whole meal asked charged more ok whatever  manager rude gave attitude   When home check 10 piece chicken nugget only 8   Don't here! <EOR> Food expect mcds  But service horrible  bought lots food  handed handful ketchup  But when asked another sauce ranch sweet n sour  only gave packet  Then said charge 25 cents any extra packets  Mcds become greedy  spending 15 dollars food  wanna charge sauce  Screw them  Ill jacks where give any amount sauce want free  <EOR> Understandable lunch rush rough but when employees decides chuckle order give coworker looks  when don't want come back  girl cash register misplaced order charged extra when paid cash because counting off  repeat order three times then overcharged receipt  told McDonald's spends lot money time training employees well apparently need improve system  <EOR> Standard Mickey ds breakfast 24 hours day!  awesome since those breakfast burritos bomb! location good since its right near Silverton freeway grab some grub bounce! <EOR> First time going McDonald's!
