Let haters hate fake reviews  experience yourself!!! <EOR> What disappointment  Kept hearing NextDoor thought would give try support neighbors  Waiter could answer questions menu tried guessing  When obvious he guessing suggested he ask particular item ra ther guessing  He seemed nice but should definitely learn menu items before working restaurant where many may questions  three us pointed item menu even asked if soup Pork Ramen came noodles  Waiter thought Tonkasu apparently ordered that  Another ordered Chicken Teriyaki plate  Came miso soup small salad  Chicken Teriyaki comes plain plate sliced piece white meat chicken sauce it even garnish plate  Also ordered special roll spicy tuna few other things it  Gyoza which acceptable but rather burnt took over twenty minutes arrive  waiter never came refill waters  He would disappear then someone else would ask if everything ok but wasn't since did food served wrong items FOUR times  NEVER ordered  manager came over try help but simply would back bring something awhile later which ordered but apparently waiter ordered  disaster  During times manager came told NextDoor she said she would take off 25% that  Later getting wrong food four times never getting order she took 20% off check gyoza chicken teriyaki special spicy tuna roll which still $30 00 only two three getting meal  POORLY HANDLED SAY LEAST  SHOULD COMPED THROUGH  NO NEIGHBORS DON'T PLAN RETURNING  <EOR> I never ever walked restaurant before    ever   quick bite place love house    The Sushi amazing great chefs good ambiance fantastic service   Tonight door new sign but same menu which suspect   place very loud busy family friends party bar   drinks water ordered couple AYCE items   Seaweed salad gyoza fine but once nigiri came not exactly ordered but hey close enough still waiting plates wasabi soy sauce etc  attempted multiple times flag anyone down no avail just ask some plates wasabi but awkwardly avoided   No kidding 15 minutes we're still trying flag someone down whole time   nigiri just sitting while waving attempting flag down anyone working   15+ minutes no service AYCE terrible   Empty waters no service nothing eat sushi with   Meanwhile party bar continues chefs doing shots friends bar   maybe waiter greeted sat polite running around trying keep 4 5 other tables but continued avoid even saying he would right back 15 minutes flagged down    Bottom line place needs game together if want stay open   locals we'll never back   bad The Sushi closed replaced joke  <EOR> Great food new owner staff  If ate sushi enjoy much better quality  <EOR> Great Restaurant amazing food   They offer delivery EAT24 GrubHub     The food delivered extremely fast 11 miles restaurant !
