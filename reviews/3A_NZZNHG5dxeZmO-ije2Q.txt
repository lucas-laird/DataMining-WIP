Because portions much smaller  Prices increased  Quality food downhill   My most recent visit other day ordered 7 Layer Burrito $1 99 2 Bean Burritos $1 09    Bean Burritos size ones sold few years ago 69 cents    now they're $1 09?  They're freakin' tiny unsatisfying   7 Layer Burrito taken huge hit quality too     all ingredients tasted bland     blech   Also Taco Bell habit putting Fire Sauce people use    only Hot Mild     and when ask some give 2 packets each item   easily use 4 5 per item    whatever   Overall Value Even though spent less $5 garbage   Only reason why stopped because old memories good junk food   Will return?  Eventually someday     but anytime soon  <EOR> Horrible customer service! Keilah probably spelled wrong she horrible! Rolling eyes very quick rude  She didn't even use sentences!
