On first visit walked group six people arriving very old limo which nice experience  extremely loud wasn't even band playing yet   place PACKED  mean packed back back sardines  hard maneuver oneself even bathroom  lively atmosphere though if looking for  However favorable choice when meeting someone's parents first time share great meal conversation  yell across table another  Funny stuff   Now onto most important part  cuisine Ok it  live America where American Italian cuisine heavily prevalent Vegas why mix two together? Casa Di Amore blends classic Italian American dishes old Vegas mob style vibe restaurant  Dishes such eggplant parmigiana veal marsala chicken marsala baked lasagna osso buco good 'ole spaghetti meatballs expected    Frankie Dino Sammie would shaking heads disappointment place   When customer sits down table expected waitress waiter greet them  timely acquainted place  all sat down took anyone come over table order drinks good 15 minutes before could order couple bottles house wine  served bread anything   I eventually ordered Eggplant Di Amore  could believe DRY dish was  intensely dry  Being spinach mushrooms sundried tomatoes umm   EGGPLANT   in tomato sauce? should dry  cut into cutting into brick  Where mushrooms?  the spinach?   that sundried tomato flavor?   where it? excited try twist classic dish but severely disappointed  only eggplant parm dry but room temperature overly salty compensate lack flavor  All tasted mozzarella seemed sitting while solid hunk nothing  My mother Pork Chops Vinegar Peppers  She excited since she grew dish  first bite pork chop tough couldn't tear off teeth fork! weirdest part pork extreme fishy taste it! unbearable!  My mother's husband ordered piece chicken potato veggies side   hardly memorable  My sister ordered Gnocchi Alla Prosciutto which better dishes table  hardly any prosciutto spinach missing again  don't know if own four cheese sauce but especially bland  My sister's boyfriend ordered Veal Marsala  Ok love marsala dishes  even prepare own kitchen time time  veal Casa Di Amore overly dry tender suppleness great veal dish should be  marsala sauce tasted nothing good marsala wine used  actually disgusted  His mother ordered same greatly disappointed  We also received bread when received entrees! blasphemy!  On ride home hopped back into limo  limo driver nice woman but weren't told would share ride couple other parties  absolutely no lighting limo neck neck darkness strangers  wait home because limo driver thought would fit drop those people off first  hour wait home when only live couple streets over  limo complimentary but still   Overall food worth second try The classic marinara sauce place should signature  here  price paying food completely worth it  find better quality half price elsewhere  am dismay hype place but suppose good place if your just subconsciously craving pseudo Italian American dish last minute    desperately  Ya know   that  starving eat anything!!   let's 711 some nachos mentality  food bland dry salty combination flavors no flavor all  lot better experiences Vegas type cuisine  Can mention Buon Gustos? Thee Best!! Seriously try it! Casa Di Amore needs toned down little  Maybe busy themselves handle? Maybe would put more effort love into food serve fresh food otherwise  Suffice say returning here  <EOR> Awesome Italian Food! Moving NJ know some good Italian food   place best Vegas  Great old Vegas atmosphere live music every time ever been  The service great also!

I try eat spaghetti  take bite follow several gulps water  mouth HURTS  next 15 minutes take 3 more bites but each more excruciating next  feel lips fire  Waiter comes again asks everything tell just cannot eat food front me    He tells should said something when asked earlier  He pointed food which originally just 1 cup cooked noodles only eat 4 small bites say its obvious ate most meal  expect do? manager KNOW he say  argue only ate 4 small bites mom steps asking if could just small side order plain noodles then chime want no sauce just put little parmesan top  He says he but charged it  else hungry    He brought ate just way said would  fine but still hungry ordered Creme Brulee which comes free t shirt   Creme Brulee good still warm waited minute two else top wouldn't break just right    When he brought check he pointed original meal's costs then side noodle's cost then he pointed he took off cost noodle side saying Because just nice guy   Listen when someone  especially waiter  tells he's nice guy because he's doing something just basic customer service know just another jerk  Then he say again if told any manager he would charged side  But saving trouble  just nice that  The funny thing paying bill mom outside smoking manager she said he really nice  There's no way he would charged little side when barely touched meal   The only time waiter truly nice use right before left when he saw taking photos canvases old Vegas he offered take couple pictures mom  when he brought free t shirt he brought several sizes could compare  nicest he entire time there   I would again limo ride atmosphere  but food  I'd drinks dessert watch friends family enjoy meal then I'd grab bite hotel afterwards    <EOR> We eggplant lasagna shrimp scampi eggplant parnassian  All three great  Waiter suggested little extra marinara side great idea  Tiramisu cannoli very tasty T shirt cannoli!
