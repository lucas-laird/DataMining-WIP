Pretty good overall dead when wasn't all comfortable overall atmosphere when busboy clearing tables wad tissue sticking nose  Food pretty good but cleanliness knocks down star  <EOR> Stopped lunch thanks fellow yelpers Place little hard find back alley Chinatown   After looking menu that hardly any sense person doesn't read mandarin ordered something called Chairman's Mao pork   turned braised pork belly  Portion enough 2    good probably could've ordered more spicy    I'll definitely keep stopping when area  <EOR> This place BEST!  When found two busloads Chinese tourists eating knew right place   However concerned long would need wait food given volume business time   turned did wait long all   All dishes authentic Hunan   While eating husband said if could nail reasonable airfare future would come back another meal   fans Vegas still aren't but place Sin City appear lot more palatable in every sense word used be  <EOR> Tucked into dead strip mall off Decatur just far enough Chinatown strip both convenient inconvenient same time serving awesome Hunan food here   You want spicy?  Hello sweaty time   Authentic dishes very reasonable prices really friendly people     really hope location works them because never busy here   just far enough away hustle Chinatown they'll miss some business but same time quite obvious everyone knows each other wait staff sure recognize if repeat customer which should be     All dishes great lamb dry pot mushroom pork boiled beef tofu dishes   All cheap large quantity   It's cozy place good way nice decor take away orders which alway good  <EOR> Love Restaurant  food authentic   Remember sure order Hunan dish Hunan dried pork  <EOR> ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? <EOR> Ok first time place took four dishes 2 rice fried chicken other  pork very tasty  We also tried sweet sour chicken   OMG very delicious! And fourth dish braised duck beer chief's speciality HEY!!! where duck full bones just few pieces meat 2 3 really good tasty but enough understand very disappointed last   By cons all dishes  really HOT HOT HOT all    About service 3 persons dinning room took order served dishes very quickly nothing else  ate same time nobody came ask if wanted anything else   this normal Chinese restaurant! <EOR> This second time Dong Ting Spring   would say first time better second experience only due service   Both times food excellent    As service during most recent visit disappointed frequency drink refills   pushed ice tea glasses edge table tried eye contact waiter suspect owner's son still wait eventually ask refills     However lacking service definitely made quality authenticity food   first time ordered wild mushroom hot pot which wonderful   time tried beer braised duck eggplant long bean smoked beef hot sour soup   eggplant far favorite wonderful flavor   hot sour soup also good flavor but did contain much broth such chicken etc  liked flavor smoked beef however probably due smoking process dry taste     Although service would hoped holding back giving establishment five stars  definitely back    Eventhough place difficult find first time worth seeking out  <EOR> This BEST Chinese restaurant entire America!!! traveling all around country visited almost all Chinatowns US  am very picky eater but best one! just spent week took taxi every single day week just meal  customers all repeated customers observed  Awesome food reasonable price good service owners very friendly definitely come back again once stay Vegas  Strongly recommend any people interested real Chinese food  <EOR> Fast service reasonable price authentic Chinese food but sometimes salty greasy some food  I only once while  most popular veggie dishes eggplant green bean  <EOR> I read reviews Yelp eager try place  asked friend previously place was  She said okay nothing would awesome because she's China  decided try place because Asian mood    First all location difficult find  same plaza Jinya Ramen   friend already sitting chatted ready when waitress asked if ready order    We ordered chicken gizzards pickled radish lamb cumin pork tongue some fish  Now meat entrees all tasted looked exactly same  though just changed meat  entrees bell peppers cumin just all all tasted same    We really wanted fish tofu asked them if any dishes that  told could add tofu fish but would take 20 minutes  fine that  fish came asked table behind if fish theirs  couple said no brought fish table   Later said made mistake  brought another fish without tofu gave us  friend told them  wanted tofu  said oh gave wrong table  Uh    fault  specifically wanted fish tofu  owner agreed bring new dish tofu it  fish tasted really good  really soft delicious well tofu   fish favorite part meal    They quite few tour buses  sitting eating owner would receive phone call every often telling them many people tour guide bringing  guess lot business that  prefer Yunan Garden way more! <EOR> When asked dad he wanted eat Father's day he immediately said Chinese food! take man Arcadia but can't take Arcadia man   Anyway brief Yelp search chose Dong Ting Spring because overwhelmingly positive reviews   When impressed clean rather cute decor   But place empty except other group   parents started having doubts but remained positive   Maybe still early     First mistake family doesn't eat spicy food   asked everything mild which made us   But if don't eat spicy why bother going Hunan restaurant?  D'oh   I actually thought meal okay   Nothing truly bad but also nothing great   parents hated though   so much wanted write review   Apparently dishes supposed feature shrimp   and instead consisted huge bunches broccoli few sad little pieces shrimp   no really touched catfish   If don't eat spicy food then find better Chinese food elsewhere   But if your food hot then still think would worth trying restaurant  <EOR> Very authentic Chinese Hunan cuisine everything good if real Hunan food   really hidden gem Chinatown   hope everybody support real Chinese food   am proud them    although don't top busy business compromise making Americanized Chinese food   boss lady speaks very good English ask recommendation she does good job   famous steam fish head Hunan specialty but don't try if problem seeing fish head can't deal fine fish bones   If skilled Chinese friend help enjoy fish meat soak your rice juice amazed flavor! <EOR> A good chines restaurant Vegas  Food good service nice  However fish head good think maybe because fish fresh  But might picky desert all    <EOR> Let just short know most people reading reviews just want know real facts place      Today first time visit restaurant  4 us sat down first thing noticed sticky table    waiter come over clean table more time   ordered 6 dishes excited try all popular dishes   end result such disaster     Everything taste extreme salty oily    entire experience awful    owner also try sell some dishes Manu also without inform price   She recommended chicken dish all broken end pieces crash bone!  presentation someone leftover   salty no flavor!!
