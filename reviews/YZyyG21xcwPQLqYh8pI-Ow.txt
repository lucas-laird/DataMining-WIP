Unfortunately place never quite lived Quark's Spacebar Hilton  Though mean beloved family Trekkies handed off specialty drink list once served Quark's McFaddens ah passing flame McFadden's failed spark when replicating drink menu  Several times received wrong drink same bartender  Fortunately she made correct drink when informed mistake guess understandable may top new drink menu but guess main issue despite several months notice given McFadden's drink menu expected number clientele really failed deliver    I also wished they'd better set dancing  Wednesday night before convention great open floor DJ  following nights included live bands karaoke couple DJs took entire dance floor set up  Loved music spinning but nowhere dance hired girls dancing underwear turn off and women  saying lot  I never ate food took advantage $30 all drink option which only extended well liquor draft beers but hope find better venture next year better grasp drink menu volume expected       more room dance floor! <EOR> We loved place! last week Tuesday happened karaoke night  food okay  chicken caesar wrap  can't really mess making those  Big portions came fries $10  husband 12 oz  new york strip steak really good  came veggies huge portion awesome garlic mashed potatoes  $23  Typical bar food  new bartender didn't  know margarita  think only 10oz cup $9  server cool  She getting mad bartender couldn't drinks  She even suggested new one  She also told waste money fish bowl drink because mostly made mixes barely any alcohol  really appreciated honesty  much fun though because crowd there  Everyone end night drunk belting bar songs Journey Guns Roses Def leppard etc  <EOR> Not your normal Irishbar am used but still pretty cool place check out   $5 Bloody Marys night came   Sunday Night   ended having dinner ordered Fish Chips Shepard's Pie some boneless buffalo strips      The portions huge!  prices fair Vegas establishment though would still liked pay little less pub food     There piano singer during dinner which nice     then lot flyers some special nights which made seem college hangout most nights here     Seems perfect place Keg Guys want PARTY        <EOR> It just okay  Servers nice but food mediocre    The Irish nachos made movie theater cheese instead real cheese  shepherd's pie tasted funny sent back  burger bad   THE PIZZA HORRIBLE! never waste food but couldn't force myself take another bite   Bottom Line Just booze quasi hooter girls  <EOR> My brother really enjoyed Lucky Charm girls wore fishnets little green outfits gave free drink tickets WSOP    We ate couple times because group order pizza something split food put back some drinks cheap you're going find it  <EOR> If want horrible service mediocre food served dirty environment place you  constant challenges waitresses' attention friends sitting bar  didn't help manager doing same thing   challenge menus order placed silverware bill  never place disinterested serving customers    To add insult injury food pretty lousy order wrong   wings ordered came celery brown beginning rot  manager seemed completely uninterested issue  Luckily he could back bar talk friends    <EOR> Happened staying Rio week needed inexpensive meal  so decided give McFaddens another chance   Actually food pretty good beer selection well   guessing first trip one year ago when place first opening   worked some kinks   crab burger hamburger topped crab pretty good  <EOR> This first review ever written Yelp!   compelled write because terrible food service restaurant was   First off came party five wait 20 minutes seated when finally shown table could see more half tables restaurant empty   explanation kitchen backed party wait   still trying sense it   Our waitress impatient sarcastic when taking orders seemed become more frustrated when table ordered only beer we drinks room came just bite    As appetizer ordered Irish style Nachos   According menu comes shepard's pie beef corn peas carrots chives cheddar cheese   When platter arrived 30 minutes later could easily tell cheese cheap imitation stuff eat movie theatres   couldn't see any beef top started digging literally found 2 teaspoons some gross bean beef dip concoction dolloped over scattering smashed tortilla chips   piece carrot corn peas entire plate   When explained waitress dish expecting she condescendingly explained yeah     IRISH nachos  No lady    these smashed 7 11 nachos no way hell paying $10 95 them   When burgers came just bad   friend noticed lettuce burger looked close rotten buns soggy actual patty didn't taste bad but much smaller you'd expect restaurant burger   However need ask point asking table would burger's cooked if going cook them all well done? mean really why even trouble offering choice if aren't going provide it     Also would say french fries come many variations many people different preferences but generally pretty hard screw up   Well steak fries McFadden's soggy undercooked disturbingly pale cream color   This probably worst food every spent money on top off waitress overcharged extra beer   If going just drink specials $10 dollar all drink coors lite well drinks might ok but STAY AWAY FOOD especially Irish Nachos  <EOR> The wait place horrible first stood entrance next please wait seated sign least 10 min trying catch attention 2 lazy slow waitresses We seated menu came waitress asked if wanted drinks put drink order 15 min later watered down tasteless bloody Mary arrived table Oops forgot rest drink order When meal arrived 40 min drinks shocked see plate full chicken nugget's ask waitress if McFaddens calls boneless chicken supposedly menu actually 8 different sauce flavors chicken nuggets? WTF  waitress really didn't seem care nor did manager when asked if plate chicken nuggets truly trying pass boneless wing's manager very rude condescending myself couple joined McFaddens unfortunate since stayed Rio 4 nights food half way decent would returned But just disappointing demeanor staff place Shame Harris having group dead beats dealing your clients McFaddens definite NO WAY!

Limited beer selection bad design awful food! Oh pricey   Irish nachos  used Movie theater cheese  No kidding   If close McMullan's Trop just there  real pub real food real beer selection  Irish nachos or anything else   all great  <EOR> My sister hung hour waiting show sky  Good selection drinks nice little spot big during really busy times would hard grab seat  first table bar sister ended making move different table because group loud slightly obnoxious guys came watch game became little roudy    Tried order corned beef sandwich found out  does Irish bar run corned beef? just don't understand it  But think turned meant because ended ordering some wings just world  Garlic parmesean cheese wings  good  Ended nicely buzzed show even managed snag some beads! Great feat since ladies being really cheap beads  <EOR> Shepherds pie underseasoned French onion soup joke  Carmelized onions? might seen inside warm pan five minutes no where near forty five good soup takes  Would nice ifthe cook knew salt looked too  drinks ok prices specials better stick them! <EOR> I honestly wasn't expecting much because dislike most chains never impressed McFadden's Philly  But heard amazing drink specials check out    The server sat immediately but many people bar area  Then asked specials she said few but interested reverse happy hour special  waitress claimed she knew nothing asked another server it  Apparently locals only  still ordered few drinks but came sporadically  came right away which draft magners gin tonic came soon but waited awhile another persons drink then told didn't vodka drink special night instead using substitution just said couldn't it  ordered corona instead took 20 mins come out! didn't any food but apparently decent  Overall pretty crappy attitude service wouldn't back  <EOR> Okay update previous review   would've given place 5 star but some workers super stuck up!!  attitude check your employees place would def 5 star !

OK weren't dueling more dueting but quality fun entertainment   expected cheesy but two younger guys fun cheese!  Oh yeah food   good   service incredibly slow food just OK   hoping better selection but if you're into typical Irish pub food oogling some Hooter's like waitresses good selection beer your place   right Mardi Gras area where show sky every 20 minutes shenanigan going outside     But didn't Vegas nice quiet meal conversation did you? <EOR> A bit unsatisfying but give credit where credit due    Located Rio first time coming here  wasn't busy decided stop by  seated high tables  didn't mind high table except fact chair wobbling back forth made jump few times cause thought going break under me  thought moving other chairs but wobbling too  course kind started dislike    The place itself did its unique features which did admire  did fact rotating fans turns around everyone feel instead being stationary  did intrigue serve your own drink bar taps tables  sure pay but new me    The staff friendly way but bit hurry take order leave  But quick refilling drinks bringing food  food hand decent nothing exciting Shepard's pie which good may recommend it  But didn't really stick much    Good thing best known its bars  good place hang your friends few beers mingle  But place actually sit down eat? bit questionable experience bit disappointing  <EOR> I love place  Every time stay Rio bar choice McFaddens  big club guy anymore more kinda scene  staff friendly atmosphere very good  get's little crazy time time blast  good great time McFaddens every time drink  recommend anyone looking fun night out  <EOR> It real nice chance into place Vegas where girls dont pretend hard all rich wearing polyester dresses but actually normal easy talk to  guys just same though everywhere else shorts jesushoes If looking good time real nice barstaff waiters fun people talk real casual environment place you  Its great start head fancy club snooty people arrogant doormen  does relax drinks waaaay cheaper  <EOR> We late dinner since every other place closed Rio needed eat before drink Voodoo Lounge   They live band actually pretty amazing  did songs ran gambit Johnny Cash Journey AC DC  all favorite music right totally excited  only did good variety band but actually did well! bar definitely needs work sound system though because way loud space  couldn't even talk people next which find really annoying    The menu consisted your typical bar food few Irish things thrown in  figured I'd try corned beef special wasn't sure I'd fix St  Patty's day!   When food arrived nothing spectacular looked cafeteria food thrown plate  Mine looked best anyone's even though literally swimming grease   The corned beef decent but ridiculously greasy thought going slide off plate  rest grease came side carrots   it bad  course traditional red potatoes which didn't even bother carve eyes or whatever call them them black middle completely rancid  GROSS! pretty much done point but no sense sending back   As other plates table plain hamburger picked just dropped grease it  don't mean typical burger grease pretty normal but patty just covered it  looked needed wrung wet dish towel  Someone else something resembled Philly Cheesesteak which equally disgusting cheese congealed unflavored nacho cheese which stuffed into bun look decent amount steak which not     Now fries    I didn't think bar could really screw but most disgusting fries ever had  sure if grease used fry them bad if potatoes bad combination both but HORRIBLE  nasty taste which think fried them same thing used fish chips nasty fishy taste them  Just thinking want hurl    This far worst restaurant Vegas  servers ok but food bad doesn't even matter  <EOR> I friend's sister's bachelorette party  service alright nothing special  She quick refill drinks  Overall there's nothing place made want come back   I split spinach artichoke dip friend  When basically soup some sort baby food  Some chips kind stale  Just meh kinda food  also order garlic fries which totally under cooked    Like said nothing really stood gave reason come back  Maybe just off night  <EOR> Came Star Trek Convention woot!     honestly    made Star Trek themed drinks played Star Trek screen    but bartender really rude    I paid lot money enjoy Trek time wanted order drinks Star Trek Drink Special menu guy grabbed threw said taking orders all day  Order something normal Uhh seriously? see Trek badge? experience Star Trek!
