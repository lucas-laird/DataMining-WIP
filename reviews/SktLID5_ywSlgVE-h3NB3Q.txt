Let customer sip some soup while wait food cook  advertise 'Fresh Order' nothing's sitting under heating lamp time between placing order picking order could spent sipping soup rather then thinking yourself 'did guy even greet when walked in?' <EOR> Great quick fix some greasy chinese food  Mongolian beef crab rangoons really good!! <EOR> I used love eating couple years back  moved southern highlands didn't China gogo since all stuff half your entree veggies barely any meat  back Rhodes ranch very dissatisfied new Togo dishes which seem half portion compared old fashioned Chinese Togo cups  Probably gonna eat anymore due portion price ratio which shame cause used good  Might well next door eat all eat sushi! <EOR> The kung pao chicken extremely bland previous reviewer said very heavy zucchini  big fan spicy things but love rich blends ginger garlic usually kung pao  restaurant doesn't offer that  couldn't taste anything sauce  <EOR> First time me family ordered China go!
