While mulling over restaurant choices Mercadito's suggested! Mercadito's award winning restaurant comes Red Rock Resort Casino Chicago it's won quite few awards including Zagat first venture Las Vegas   Even thou opened doors end June official opening over Fourth July event planned following Friday July 11th humm new place casino friday?!? PERFECT!  Now need say nine we never really sure many show which VERY difficult reservations one time only three appeared  embarrassing! Ok back review  The restaurant open lunch dinner offers industry day well Happy Hour since lunch seating starts 11 30am arrived little early  hostess unlocked door waiting right in  she inquired reservation  NO sorry didn't one! Would she turn away? Did matter? little whispering few minutes seated  pushed three tables together all nine could sit together  YEAH! Since never Mercadito's weren't sure expect did any uneducated patron would do we put food choices into server's hands did he recommend? course try some salsa  we ordered rojo salsa suggested Brian YUMM! CREAMY salsa fresh tomatoes garlic onions came BEST tortilla chips ever tasted! swear chips perfect crispy just right amount salt I really could've sat consumed basket basket chips! drinks expecially margaritas were just right size prepared top shelf tequila! lunch entrees served family style  NOT family size! other words ordered pollo tacos co workers ordered blackened swordfish tacos another ordered crispy magi mahi tacos shared  that way each opportunity taste all three! excellent! other co worker ordered carne tacos liked them MUCH he ordered second plate take home dinner! Beans rice available but DON'T come lunch I found weren't necessary anyway three tacos chips salsa more enough  also offer tortas tasty mexican sandwich  available your choice side salad fries fries NEVER tasted before delicious lemon lime fries  actually would've thrilled simply sit eat tortilla chips lemon lime fries! When finished I swear saw co worker licking plate! each every stuffed wasn't any room dessert  Oh NO means we'll back!  recommend restaurant? DEFINITELY! visit again? COURSE!

LOVE mexican food good salsa guacomole Mercadito both  menu little confusing but very minor compared great food service was   Our waitress Amber fabulous  She seemed very happy work very knowledgeable    We 'unlimited 3 salsas ' 'traditional guacomole ' start with  Everything tasted fresh  guacomole connoisseur haha fell love Mercadito's guac  already craving back it    I enchiladas delish  know its great food when taste freshness family myself kept talking about   I can't wait back Thank Amber great experience! <EOR> Great authentic Mexican food  shrimp pork belly tacos amazing  steak nachos really good too  restaurant just little cramped bit loud  <EOR> After reading some negative reviews wondering if came same place but talking wife born raised El Paso sure reviewing right restaurant  best Mexican had  twice equally impressive visits  first time ate bar second visit brought son 4 sat dining room  The Margaritas great don't miss Paloma tequila grapefruit juice    Between two visits sampled most tacos salsas ceviche  All great  son children's chicken tacos which he loved  only draw back squeeze bottled sour cream all over tacos which made them very messy but he liked them non less  flautas also delicious  small guac more two could eat  Creamy rich just perfectly spiced   If find something negative guess server little pushy but server myself guess see where she's coming but she needs learn balance suggestions upsells   We'll back look forward bringing inlaws see think place  <EOR> I come eat 3 times month  definitely spread word place  food great even though menu little small  waiting since opening then Bloody Marys though  When tend order little everything but always order tacos pineapple them  amazing  If industry should Tuesday 10  give 50% off your entire bill drinks included   only thing really bothers loud music is  OMG loud  favorite server girl named Panini hopefully spelled right   <EOR> Service absolutely terrible! took close 15 minutes waitress take order  restaurant no where near full    The manager very unprofessional  He only greeted European guests  He walked past All customers color surrounding tables Asian Hispanic African American     The food overpriced mediocre quality  would recommend dining if good service flavorful food high your priority list  <EOR> Very reminiscent Modern Mexican places continue pop end shutting down less year  First off seating horrendous  All tables 2 half booth except booth connected everyones table tables literally 1 5 feet away each other  scoot table side almost knocked over 2 drinks  Point if you're looking any type privacy conversation don't here   For food very expensive quality food  almost immediately irritated when order cheapest thing could find Tacos 16$ then hear someone couple tables down ordering off Happy Hour menu  Seriously? never offered happy hour nor did menu table  Once asked saw same tacos going buy half price  feeling if didn't ask Happy Hour menu would ended charging full price  Also chips salsa free  Seriously?  I wouldn't consider myself cheap but don't think ever Mexican restaurant many pay chips salsa   I also ordered elote  know Mexican corn mayo cheese chili? I'd think pretty difficult mess but did  chard corn first half black tasted burnt  nasty burnt parts completely covered taste other ingredients although barely any mayo cheese chili begin     In end 8 miniature tacos guac chips salsa water $40 00  wouldn't irritated number if satisfied but left far satisfied  <EOR> Love place! Chicago location now Vegas location am anxiously awaiting Philly location  hongo tacos which vegetarian loved  boyfriend swordfish mahi mahi tacos said both good  margaritas strong hit spot  recommend hongo tacos margaritas! Now hurry open Philly location please! <EOR> Wow top notch Mexican food    would drive way restaurant  Food awesome  Service awesome    Highly recommend  <EOR> Overall pretty disappointed place   food might rate 4 but factor prices poor quality service no way give any higher 2 star   Some examples $15 4 mini size tacos   guacamole much lime overpowering   going boutique Mexican food place yet flavors just don't justify overpriced menu   Salad choices limited 2 greens salad which isn't bad Mexican chef salad   When asking if 8 pay add grilled swordfish answer NO but add chicken? ??   If sub $15 per person pricing level 6 people bill $150 only appetizer ordered pre tax pre tip might rate better   As service   being plate team kitchen   last plate took 10 minutes first plate last plate salad    If stuck Red Rock suppose better Albertos down street but much  <EOR> Enjoyed tapas Mercadito   Just right portions   Though think many find pricey   But its Red Rock Casino   so would expect be   Service great   7pm expect wait table   Overall good experience  <EOR> Great food mediocre service   Don't over dress serving staff t shirts  I'd back but food ambiance it none   prices bit high considering    <EOR> Open air concept adjacent construction Red Rock casino! Fun lunch! Attentive staff very well versed menu ingredients  Stiegl Austria must enjoy again beverage but pass ordering ice tea again let's just say tad reminiscent cough syrup    Order Stiegl instead!!!  Tacos small scale but ingredients KICK ASS no doubt it!  Mahi Ceviche      PERFECT!!! order included coupon! <EOR> My guest came  dead time during day basically wave down Bartendar which 5 floor to drink start taking order   bartenders busy talking amongst each other serve customers   Way expensive worth again never coming back <EOR> I think overall ok but place would want back to   Our server ok but again nothing special   She failed tell sharing menu all eat tacos which advertise Monday Sunday's until asked it   She seemed bothered when asked questions asked modifications items ordered i e wanted pinto beans rather black beans   The guacamole chips really good lot flavor   Several people group ordered unlimited tacos swordfish chicken carne asada shrimp pork belly but felt just ok if came back would order them again  <EOR> This your mom pop Mexican place unlike some other reviewers don't expect full 5 bucks    That being said Mercadito seems new school Mexican creative dishes fun flavors won't find traditional places  small plates ordered Camaroncitos al Chipotle Queso Fundido short ribs add on  served same time server Lanie recommended mix match sides sauces both dishes fun it  genius!   Other friends enjoyed langosta lobster tacos special but thought special steak tacos some sort jalapeño dressing really stood out    The Pollo la Brasas dish if enjoy amplified flavors garlic lime  dish tried New York location many moons ago still dreamed until finally tasted again Red Rock  Also PLANTAIN RICE  YES   OMFG dessert    baked bread pudding something  Even being gluten conscious couldn't stop eating    Definitely recommend family style  ordered lot less thought need because portions actually small  <EOR> Oh man love place  drinks margaritas especially KILLER  tried several flavors including smoke option cheeky cheeky boom boom another can't remember lol   food wonderful  stick quest fundido spare ribs  Perfect portion size  usually sit bar doesn't traditional bar vibe  new favorite place town  drinks STRONG too  price you're getting great drink  place isn't cheap but completely worth it  <EOR> Although food actually very good patronize restaurant again  First all unreasonably loud  several large tables people literally screaming yelling top lungs  celebrating friends birthday could even conversation  also did care hear sexual exploits ladies table behind us  waitress took forever wait when she finally did take order she failed bring everything ordered  Very disappointing  <EOR> The food always excellent! Great hand made tortillas well seasoned food   love all ceviches tomatillo salsa seasonally great lamb tacos  Amber best server ever!

Yeah no   Carne tacos carne asada tacos topped watercress jicama slaw  meat really tough chewy  Another person table also said carne tacos tough  watercress jicama slaw no jicama very bland  put salsa guacamole taco some sort flavor    So small plate guacamole 4 tough flavorless tacos ended paying $28  price would fine enjoyed food  many other taco spots town I'd rather spend way less satisfied  Definitely recommend place  server nice made sure glasses never empty which why 2 star review instead 1  <EOR> I other day wanted margarita seem pre mixed made order  guy table next said worst margaritas he ever had  Also don't mix match tacos restaurant many rules  never seen many customers complaining  won't coming back <EOR> Very good food but service still needs little work   Very friendly staff but bit disorganized   Also tables outside low leaves wanting sit adults table!

First off restaurant cold shivering FARGO 'FRICKING' NORTH DAKOTA   The Queso Fundito came table luke warm which meant cheese already almost solid  mushrooms didn't taste bad but cold Queso Fundito just sucks period  came spoon which absolutely worst utensil use when trying cut semi hard cheese   Question does anyone besides remember when could order your entire meal beginning kitchen would enough sense send appetizer first give some time before sending rest? Boy miss those days    We ordered appetizer but weren't ready order tacos  waitress kept coming without appetizer ask if ready politely ordered hoping enough time passed appetizer could arrive could few minutes enjoy before small table overrun plates   Boy wrong  more 1 minute Fundito arrived tacos just mine apparently no thinks people eat together anymore  now tacos getting cold while try finish Fundito before turns back into hard brick cheese    The other orders came 5 6 minutes apart  people completely incompetent   I say food bad but say Pepe's Tacos offers MUCH better tacos 1 3 price    This place PURE SHIT absolute waste great location awesome remodeling Red Rock  already see other Yelp reviews most people agree    Pay $75 some tourist Las Vegas Strip slap three times face much better use your money  <EOR> Was very disappointed service  sat first come first serve   Sat 2 top table when clearly room 3   Then kicked cuz manager said could 3 area  Serious     come on  Trying support  But can't when people act way    <EOR> Oh Man     difference visit makes      Hey last time sat tiny litle tables bar      only big enough kids think but        replaced those high tops     Also last time no idea things come randomly       ended waiting eat next plate     Once found food timing      alright order food family style way       much better         Let just say        sometimes its all service      last time no idea expect food timing really la carte menu Extra $ salsa on time guy served gave info     only but he also knew much ingredients friendly     really difference      took wife time along Laws all way Australia really havent eaten much Mexican food       LOVED IT       Father Law want lick plate       think resounding solid Thumbs up    So lets talk plate     Guacamole bacon        Holy baby god!!!!!!

Even just told don't carry coins your register? some places myself bartended many shady Eastern European Middle Eastern bars but am pretty sure against FTC ethical practices  5 000 people week month short change them  40  50 cents you've made extra 2 5 grand  okay all  principal ethics question  business long time would never something even if company demands which can't imagine any ethical business doing so   <EOR> I tried place first time today definitely recommend Happy Hour menu!  When restaurants overcharge traditional Mexican food generally order several appetizers anyway create small plate experience providing plentiful variety food relatively low cost     Mercadito extensive menu tried far sure back some point try some full entrees   But if only appetizers next time wouldn't surprised   course ordered chips salsa sampler trio mostly good salsas house made corn chips  thick side little greasy but job done  guacamole little simple but brought flavor nicely     We ordered nachos which $7 isn't bad deal but happy hour price  portion little small light toppings anything more that  appreciate approach mercadito takes nachos  bit nacho enthusiast always open something different  offer nothing particularly special just black beans cheese crema tomatoes diced avocado  order meat but keeping simple theme chose leave off  enjoyed pairing traditional ingredients which offered somewhat refreshing take bar food favorite   My wife loved elote roasted corn cob dusted chile cotija cheese   Again much pricier man sells cart street but just delicious   Probably biggest deal happy hour cold draft beer  pint Ballast Point Sculpin IPA $4  Haven't found price anywhere   Mercadito offers flavorful Mexican food great drinks modern atmosphere  If ever Red Rock friends I'd definitely suggest place few drinks bite eat  <EOR> Tried place few times very pricey Mexican food good drinks food isn't consistent   <EOR> Bleh  impressed all  better food Taco Bell  Okay maybe but did good experience here  thing pissed off most? can't order taco plate different tacos?! all same some strange reason  Wonder if suffer 'just because Summerlin must awesome' syndrome  did tasty salsas    but pay chips  game killer but chips c'mon man getting bread Italian joint  Kinda adds touch   And last gripe outside patio short stools impossible sit look classy   You're straddling things your bareback horse riding  guy table next looked each other we're trying comfortable things real??!

We saw waitress once twice but rest time service man white stripped long sleeve shirt i think he manager   He just came pick plates asked soda re fill said never mind see waitress ask her  She bypassed table didn't even look empty glasses needed re fill  2 mins later gentlemen brought out! He also gentlemen asked dessert menu because waitress never came back  10 mins later she showed recited dessert menu doesn't physical menu look days??   white friends wondering heck 3 items were  point done asked check  believe she said coconut flan churros something else no idea even Mexican was    Maybe she many tables? Maybe didn't seem people dropping hundreds drinks night table next us  But paying customers  Show little attention  <EOR> Been twice now    once when relatively new once week ago friend chicas night evening reported special giveaways etc    The first time assumed because new which reason waiter didn't know anything  When came last week normal course chit chat hostess how's your day? she replied sucks can't wait until over something that   hostess you're face business    even if your day sucks super bad customer shouldn't really know that    Once friend came sat down order  ordered vegan fish tacos which substituted zucchini although last time squash   friend going order burger but then told would take 20+ minutes basically wouldn't food same time  She then ordered lobster tacos 4 them since waitress said could only order 4 minimum lobster   15 minutes later waitress came back tell friend oh yea order less 4 if want    many did want? wait even longer since order guess never placed 4?   In addition waitress forgot Thursday specials  Plus she forgot chicas night until ask her   Oh manager came check meal hands pockets entire time? Awkward weird Food decent but service lackluster  <EOR> Sadly Mercadito does live its hype having best fish taco  NY Magazine thinking? But then again 2006 somewhere else  excited check restaurant when opened Red Rock Resort course taste famous fish tacos  Unfortunately arrived dry over cooked  takes lot send dishes back kitchen but occasion no choice  waitress super polite upon looking dish even admitted wasn't par  She returned several minutes later much more desirable plate mahi mahi tacos  other dishes quite good service point  Hopefully just fluke but best taco far  <EOR> Tacos!

Guava Pineapple Market all good!  New recently talked into order chicken dinner Pollo Las Brisas think but don't quote lol probably best chicken ever tasted   much flavor packed into little thigh   rarely order chicken especially when options carne tacos but lately ordered every time   The manager approached ask if everything okay sure let know fellow Yelpers thought music loud   He said noise restaurant seems carry it very full 6 00 but he took note seemed happy try customers more enjoyable experience   This now added regulars list!! <EOR> Tried Mercadito over Labor Day weekend  While want rate place 3 star deep down really deserves just 2  GF arrived little 5 00 Saturday evening   Service The hostess prompt seating immediate  server pleasant seemed knowledgeable regarding menu offerings behind theme   Throughout meal server staff attentive responsive  Drink order taken promptly cocktails table good time  water glasses maintained   Food While really enjoyed flavors tacos  some missteps here  believe chips salsa should standard premium priced restaurant one  Charging $3 50 salsa tasting bit cheap when charging $14 50 4 small tacos per plate    We tried 4 plates tacos Camaron shrimp Pollo chicken Carne Asada steak Pastor pork   tasted great exception Carne Asada which sent back   Also though ordered premium tequilas cocktails bit steep given  use rocks glasses heavy ice  2 Don Julio Margaritas $32 2 Fortaleza Margaritas $34    sure picture    Atmosphere For while interior visually pleasing interior way narrow small  First all personal grudge against establishments use bench seating uses throughout  few booths but entire restaurant feels cramped claustrophobic me   Also feel dress code relaxed doesn't reflect pricing point  shouldn't see flip flops shorts abound interior dining room  patio area  fine but should regulated better   This maybe Happy Hour place where might meet drink bar then proceed rest your evening somewhere else  Overall while food service probably worth 3 stars headwinds pricing atmosphere keep 2 stars me  <EOR> This third time every time would give place 3 stars  recently added new family style menu different price pp options  decided $20 value pp which included 2 guacamoles to share 2 salsas unlimited 2 sides to share 3 different types tacos each person gets three same kind For additional $3pp dessert each  Beware menu bit confusing there's lot going on  Overall food always good amazing but good  dessert menu horrible!!! Only three options what's supposed best soaked bread topped scoop vanilla ice cream isn't even good  second best chocolate cake horrendous! don't even want try coconut flan  But far tacos tried almost all them best would Pancita  feel menu food need improvement  high end Mexican food charge you'd expect lot more  come because kids love playing arcade Mercadito better options inside RR  brighter note staff great very friendly! <EOR> Great tacos margs combined decent Happy Hour place top pick Red Rock!  Awesome patio too  I really enjoyed doing All Eat Tacos twice  sure if still specials happy hour change often  Most taocs tried very good few such pork belly shrimp stood out  guava margarita awesome red sangria tasty too!  Brunch relatively new last saw included all drink mimosas  <EOR> This place delicious  only reason gave 4 stars because little pricey but hey    casino  more fusion Mexican joint rather place tacos el Gordo  legit  But bf started traditional guac garlic salsa    Amazing lot! order more chips  corn elotes super yum espada swordfish tacos recommendation server  did disappoint but would liked try pastor tacos    Just wasn't hungry enough  am tequila drinker white stripe cheeky cheeky boom boom drinks amazing fresh  agua frescas mouth watering  bf variety tequila drinks he liked them all but thought classic margarita still best  Someone next pollo las brasas which also looked delicious must because sucked them down bone  def come back  <EOR> This place seemed pretty awesome just judging facility itself  clean great staff  Everyone friendly servers always coming back check refill waters  seemingly flawless restaurant  Unfortunately though restaurant all great qualities food wasn't all impressive  pastor tacos alright  then tried some friend's food also alright  Everything just average  don't know if would come back simply because food wasn't appealing me  Obviously personal opinion others could totally think wrong but if asked again I'd probably turn offer down somewhere else Red Rock  <EOR> On visit stopped drinks only     sat patio bar tried auntie ox smokey Pablo both very outstanding drinks! Highly recommended! Can't wait back try food! <EOR> If could give zero stars would  place terrible!  Horrible costumer service server didn't even ask anything if needed anything else she asked 2x wanted drink 25 minutes bri g pepsi   which flat btw  tacos nothing but street tacos paid 18 dollars person! that!!!! place isn't even busy  never come back place  Ever!!!! <EOR> I came just visit friend works but OMG wow  ate much!

Would definitely recommend place people willing try something new  <EOR> My friends live Chicago RAVE Mercadito  friend lives Summerlin raved location  naturally when coming into town New Years decided dinner here! NYE Sharing Menu certain time 40 dollars per person ridiculous amount food and even later option reserving table more money per person which included food open bar midnight toast   opted 40 dollar sharing menu  included 2 guacs salsas 2 small plates 4 tacos 2 sides dessert    We tried following * Habanero Salsa nervous name would spicy but delicious perfect amount kick it! wish could bowl it!  * Traditional Guac actually tasty! All often mexican restaurants where add salt salsa guac because just smashed avocado but Mercadito's guac extremely tasty perfectly seasoned! * Flautas probably least favorite item tried but still pretty good just flavorful everything else tried  * Nachos probably FAVORITE items tried!! delicious generous portion perfect amount every toppings! * Tacos tried Hongos Pollo Cameron Carne tacos don't really eat much meat but tried all them faves hongos pollo! figured would pick 4 tacos each share but 8 total tacos    needless say ridiculously large meal ridiculously full * arroz y frijoles black beans rice  Kind plainer side but still subtly tasty!  * roasted poblano cauliflower SPICY super tasty!! Highly recommend if you're cauliflower fan!  We ordered few margaritas well  marge great option adding smoke adding heat adding fruit  added heat margs definitely gave kick pretty good just something usually expect marg second without heat  Overall margs strong delicious!   The service point most part! took while someone come grab order but once he did he super attentive everything came pretty fast almost fast considering much food had!! Loved food drinks can't wait check Chicago next time there! <EOR> I am local Las Vegas always goto Red Rock  Tho restaurant always while wait worth it  always start off guacamole great starter Strawberry cinnamon fresco drink  non alcoholic LOVE drink!! also always order Lobster tacos highly recommend try them! love coming here! <EOR> I didn't much interest checking Mercadito until heard Tuesday industry special 50% off all menu items including cocktails   We arrived packed  noise level little louder would preferred but guess  expected  server attentive friend decided share two taco plates some elote   The pork belly tacos favorite  Good texture flavor  even nice spicy kick  camaron ok didn't much kick would liked  likely ask them heat tortillas next time since little cooler side  think would made all difference   My friend tried dessert said good  menu tapas style encourage larger groups come share  some really interesting cocktails menu well look forward trying next Tuesday night visit  <EOR> I excited try place disappointment   I found prices pretty high portion sizes bringing meals randomly whenever ready appropriate when having nice meal friends  food came before appetizer husbands food came when ever finished  wouldn't known even coming because waitress MIA during time  Took forever refill chips drinks  Basically food drink orders taken then server came back check time thankfully other people dropped off food ask them salt other simple requests   Don't know if would ever come back  <EOR> The tacos tasty but way small overpriced  much cheaper better Mexican places  don't mind spending money but hate feeling overpaid  definitely feel overpaid didn't leave completely full  Probably won't back  Unless someone else's dime <EOR> Finally chance dine Mercadito  Sat patio which nice  Tried Mexican Cobb Salad shrimp   really tasty shrimp excellent   Also shared red snapper entre  delicious  highlight coleslaw  must have  Service very good  <EOR>
