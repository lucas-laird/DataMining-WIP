They're always point  haven't tried any sandwiches though  if haven't ordered anything breakfast menu think place 'okay' say give another shot! <EOR> While Vegas did quick search somewhere breakfast  Mr  Mama's fit criteria being fairly close affordable having fairly decent reviews  location sort random strip mall didn't inspire thoughts greatest meal nor did somewhat ordinary looking interior  Thankfully learned judge restaurant its looks Mr  Mamas did disappoint   Between omelet pancakes french toast ordered table nobody any major complaints  Given atmosphere prices which very affordable food probably better expecting  side toast could used bit more butter front but  nothing little extra jelly won't compensate for   The service friendly attentive  time left pretty decent crowd there  considered stopping breakfast next day but slept bit late opted just road home instead  Next time we're Vegas though know where we'll getting breakfast least once  <EOR> Awesome service awesome food great people! Try French toast chicken fried steak! won't disappointed!!
