Plus always doing bingo nights raffle drawings karaoke other fun stuff  Definitely 5 star rating! <EOR> Only when truly deserved take time lambast really sorry establishment  Plate fully qualifies failing meet even minimal standards  When $15 99 prime rib dinner being ordered obvious first inquiry order taker would would it rare medium well done  Shane inept bartender fails even bother rudimentary step  When presented order noticed garlic toast dessert missing  Shane informs no garlic toast strawberry jello available if desired cheesecake! Obviously any normal kitchen prepare garlic toast minutes unless no bread excuse disingenuous ludicrous  If something joint's menu white board signage going included whatever reason management competent management is would simply remove item wipe finger  darlings  When bill came $22 80 asked much beer while waiting  Reply $4 50 plus take charge  meat gifted neighbor big dog  strongly suggest avoiding dump all cost  <EOR>
