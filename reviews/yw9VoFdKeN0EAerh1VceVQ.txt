Will definitely return next time Vegas! <EOR> very nice service!great atmosphere !The owner friendly considered  If want party recommend place  never let down <EOR> I passed restaurant bar karaoke when late seated sushi neko  quickly realized new why give place try  Came weekday night wasn't really busy  didn't wait long seated either    Customer service 1 5 really lacked communication skills  First off ask two different employees if served rice it wasn't menu first employee said only bacon fried rice  Then asked second employee he said serve white rice?? Second server didn't know which food what  Pretty much didn't know eating  Third boyfriend waiting registers rung but just standing looking him  bit language barrier probably just communication skills?   Food 2 5 5 Price ok $5 less skewer   But majority food same seasoning    all tasted almost same  seasoning overpowering some dishes  But most favorite would grilled oysters! never restaurant grilled oysters! Grilled oysters favorite! add bit garlic top tasted heavenly!! probably only thing didn't seasoning     Overall ok experience  may come back grilled oyster if improve communication skills  But new restaurant hoping only because new! Would love come back if customer service other things change  <EOR> Excellent skewer place  Killer prices  Quiet atmosphere  Big place accommodated 7 people easily  Nice service    Would come again  <EOR> Very nice food service!! Tasty szchuan skewers cool karaoke system perfect place little drink  <EOR> This place getting worse worse  vote them worst restaurant Las vegas give them courage open restaurant all nasty food  eating twice both time don't even put salt food      food fresh too  through night  <EOR>
