HORRIBLE SERVICE! Waited half hour didn't appetizer while everyone seated served   server didn't even order until 15 20 mins being seated  its new restaurant but shouldn't take long appetizer table  manager kitchen food probably just sitting there  Then when food waitress came over said she forgot onion rings  upset dining experience  Food alright but still didn't need take over hour everything table  Thought burger place? <EOR> I don't usually give 5 star reviews but based food service whether would back  years since visited Red Robin  few weeks ago great hamburger service great   looking forward next visit  <EOR> Customer service SUCKS if you're black  Upon arrival seated right away however no said word 10 mins point left  2 other white couples arrived order drinks dinner  Definitely won't returning  <EOR> I came Husband today nothing but exceptional service  small issue order but managers came over explain issue apologize even provided discount any inconvenience we impressed level service when weren't expecting knowing happened   back location  Thank Red Robin! <EOR> Been many times  Horrible service tonight  Over 50 minutes no entrees  Also only received two apps ordered through manager  No napkins no silverware  don't blame server she must 20 tables  Poor management  Going take break them while until sort issues  <EOR> I sworn off Red Robin because horrible service received twice Centennial Hills Las Vegas  food but refuse eat somewhere bad service  When new Downtown Summerlin opened figured we'd give shot  service incredible staff extremely pleasant friendly fast  When part order accidentally missed corrected immediately many apologies  would highly recommend location  <EOR> Nice restaurant but horrible service! hostess better waitress  waiter messed drinks he never came back offer more drinks he never came back fries ordered food cold especially fries he never did anything  multiple times needed especially going bar drink refilled  Don't even bother complaining you'll kicked female manager   STAY FAR AWAY RED ROBIN BAD SERVICE!!!!! <EOR> I've only bad experience far waiter but otherwise love eating here! Usually Brent he great! recommend guacamole bacon burger burning love if spice! <EOR> Brought teenage kids late lunch early dinner 4 pm happen catch them shift change close empty place  seated immediately service came reasonable time  waitress great! Would definitely ask Brandillynn again! food fast yummm   as always  However shortly ordering couple son came seated booth away  stopping hostess asking waitress going come? hostess immediately grabbed waitress both came back explained shift change apologized profusely  couple proceeded argue ultimately demanded manager  Daniel appeared few minutes later help family whose chief complaint waitress loud whilst apologizing! Seriously? loud? All while listening complaints! manager again apologized while interrupted more complaints  Obviously experience occupied meal but want commend staff Red Robin going way above beyond  truly impressed professionalism service  guess just can't some people happy!! <EOR> Good food great service  family enjoyed visit  waiter did good job following table  <EOR> Usually chain but location really awful  Why? server rude told Ashley appetizer sweet potato fries fried zucchini undercooked  did eat them just letting know kitchen manger should know issues that  Then medium rare burger cooked well done  burger slopped together nasty  fries undercooked  tell cooks don't care all quality  ordered chicken  caeser wrap closer rabbit food  Again bad management   When Ashley asked if wanted new said no thank cooks don't know doing she then stated having bad night  Apart awful food could done without curt fake attitude she carefully developed disgruntled server  top all off only did take burger off check but added extra burger check wouldn't notice  Again bad management  end corrected check but eat place again  I'd interested see if kitchen cleanliness matches food service quality  <EOR> I'm only leaving review because Red Robin finally seems getting its stuff together  longtime fan burgers disappointed new location  bar area super small such couldn't just walk it  still ask seated   at bar! Then when bar staff would hover over hungry vulchers asking your food every bite  annoying claustrophobic  Plus burgers just tasted differently other locations   Recently decided give them another shot  bar area cleaned burger actually tasted normal Red Robin burger  and only one bartender waited she courteous but stalker  bar area still cramped set weird beer taps blocking customers handing bartender anything vice versa but seem getting location together living normal Red Robin standards  <EOR> The service fine  Nothing stood overly good overly bad  food though good  restaurant burger joint expecting much more  food bland  would much rather other burger options Downtown Summerlin spend less money much better burger  <EOR> Horrible service girl such snobby attitude! BrandiLynn something that <EOR> Thus second time complaint now insensed  First time called order take when home mussing items  1 entree all condiments  No dressing salad no ketchup etc  Called said could stop by  am 7 miles away wouldn't work  Just yesterday decided order again  time husband actually down restaurant order person  getting home AGAIN to find another missing entrée!!! certainly isn't responsibility over every item!!! When called when really made angry  manager said don't delivery service come back entree he could credit me  No sorry nothing ridiculous  worst customer service ever never patronize place again <EOR> Incredibly disappointing birthday dinner daughter  waiters fault but way under staffed many tables per waiter waitresses  <EOR> I would say experiences location declined years gone on  When first opened great time gone gotten worse  table dirty seats wet spilled drinks floor filthy under booth seated at  host made poor attempt clean up  husband found apples salad wasn't supposed apples it  table hardly cleared empty dishes  no silverware until asked them received food   food good though  But service poor  Unfortunately won't returning Red Robin future  <EOR> Great experience  first visit ever chain  Yummy burger super friendly service  <EOR> Service just ok  waiter spilled beer table wiped left pile wet napkins edge table didn't bring water glasses till already eating   chicken sandwich fine   husband regular cheeseburger wouldn't cook medium rare only medium well done  also mozz sticks fried zucchini apps upset stomaches even two year old tummy ache    I wouldn't back  <EOR> What disappointment  several Red Robin restaurants both Las Vegas other states  Usually very good but much  wife seated high tables but chairs wobbly  tried moving over couple chairs another table but wobbly too   would preferred booth but never offered which surprising since place half empty   ordered water meal but couldn't drink because tasted awful  Even lemon which didn't ask nor did want couldn't help taste  fries barely warm obviously sat while  only reason gave 2 stars because burger tasted good  first last time Red Robin  <EOR> What joke  Management can't obliviously manage here  Food sucks employees act don't want here  eat new favorite burger place called flippin good burger  Great prices great atmosphere great people  <EOR> Sat 10 min   waited waiter then Mgr came save just walk out    Took order over hand rail directly next he then reached hand give menus  far first impression Terrible! Our waiter eventually came around apologize she only person section    which felt manager wasn't utilizing staff fullest   Some blowing balloons others standing around waiting another guest sit  Food finally came which only thing good place  But Mgr again kept serving over hand rail filling water   For poor service wait time he did cut some slack $15 bill applying 20% off    wow thanks    would've took care bill if under $20    but am I  <EOR> Absolute WORST restaurant experience ever experienced says lot because husband dine very often both work service industry  dined evening 5 24 server BRENT  arrived shortly couple treating already drinks when arrived  Brent approached table without saying word just stared direction no greeting  assumed he wanting know wanted drink told him  Brent seemed intoxicated while serving he smelt alcohol wouldn't eye contact converse bright red clumsy  husband ordered root beer float Brent brought two separate glasses ice cream root beer  When he reached table he spilt root beer ALL OVER husband! pants underwear shoes SOAKED husbands phone  did apology? NOPE! He through towel clean myself continued wipe down table  word  point decided inform manager thought server intoxicated he spilt root beer all over us  All manager said take care again no apology  server gone another 10 minutes before coming back take actual food order  he kept glaring wouldn't speak avoiding table  manager came food front Brent said talked buddy everything fine! again no apology!! unprofessional! only time ever any apology when Brent handled bill he said sorry root beer thing totally unsympathetic obviously because think tip  worst part all didn't ANY sort discount bill even root beer float! other places dinner stop buy new clothes because sticky uncomfortable! WASTE YOUR TIME RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES!!!

Pam server she sweetest lady ever if decide come back hopefully again  food decent but took LONG receive even fry refill took 20mins! 7pm 9pm right before movie going start  manager did comp dessert ordered waited 30mins friend did free burger deal all paid entree drinks but having 2 hours when usually takes 30mins maybe hour restaurant crazy! lucky didn't miss movie just barely otherwise would made entire experience even worse already was  also sat bar area where drunk guy slammed glass down broke luckily didn't hurt but awkward  Come Red Robin together! <EOR> Brought 3 teenage daughters dinner   last time patronized location less ham impressed service  time service better   food came reasonable time drinks refilled   highly suggest joining loyalty club if eat here  them all gain points he more eat   addition Red Robin automatically discount your bill if enough points reward  simple painless  <EOR> Went eat family good time  When food everything looked great  But food actually warm fries tasted old reheated  only giving 3 stars because server Justin great nice  <EOR> This generous 3 Star review  Let start positives    walked Saturday no reservation but still promptly seated hostess super sweet  She busy seating guests cleaning tables but always smiling  server great husband's black bleu burger sautéed mushrooms caramelized onions bleu cheese sauce crumble   They decent kids menu burger decent but side fruit just terrible   wasn't fresh fruit icky son could barely swallow   I always enjoyed Ghost burger if love hot want  However changed veggie patty new chewy dry hard  other bummer if order ghost burger veggie patty pay Big ghost which $11 50 $8 50   The restaurant clean dishes clean silverware needs serious upgrade  price place needs upgrade cleanliness dishes  burger served little basket would normally think  fries but managed put big ghost fries little basket wonder expect eat  request plate which wasn't clean soaking wet  Ewwww <EOR> Being childhood favorite really excited again  But minute walked no hostess greet server walked made no attempt getting hostess  5 minutes finally seated   Boyfriend ordered Black Bleu which decent ordered Taco Tavern double which utter disappointment  should two patties lettuce guac salsa tortilla chips came looking double cheeseburger mcdonalds few pieces lettuce pitiful teaspoon guac cheese salsa tortilla strips nowhere found    We told waiter then taken care but even missing additions now burger couldn't over burger worst ever had  Salsa tasted bottled ones market  such small amount lettuce forgot there  Guacamole? Guacamole? patties even level mcdonalds  best thing probably cheese    Bottom line going back night ended being nothing but disappointment  <EOR> I come location few times!  The atmosphere always vibrant welcoming  love location  hostess very attentive friendly upon arrival each time  staff very personable dedicated while restaurant    I sat both bar restaurant portion location  bar good when more hurry  can't remember bartenders name when but he very attentive comical  manager came few times just sure everything going okay during dining experience    I bring parents whenever craving burger endless fries! would definitely recommend location anyone craving red robin burger just burger general   FYI royal red robin burger egg  good!

Unclear server didn't offer explain    <EOR> I don't frequent chain restaurants often but Red Robin found fairly consistent surprisingly large menu burger spot easy accommodate various diet requests requirements typically friendly staff   Came armed free birthday burger coupon join e club yours! opted Arctic Cod lettuce wrap  Subbed cup chili fries added wedge salad  Food arrived hot fresh chili good spicy kick service bar attentive engaging throughout    While service good food isn't bad meals extremely average $10 15 pp pricing hence why visits pretty rare maybe twice year     Note bar visible entry possibly preserve family friendly feel? hang left find it  Bonus points being few stand alone restaurants Downtown Summerlin area making easier parking  <EOR> We just mom's birthday  normally not so good service restaurants but Ren amazing! She very nice funny  pass free appetizer terrible experience another location expired didn't realize  She double checked see if could honor did  She also offered place special orders mom hard time chewing  Overall very attentive server personality  <EOR> I expected lot better servixe restaurant  wife dinner here  seated bar dinning area lady works there  Real nice lady  ordered small order onion rings wedge salad  Both where ok  Then ordered burgers which came believe Sonic hamburgers just little bit better ones where served  waiter never came around see needed  maybe 2 other couples area restaurant  push call server button table electronic thing because wanted more fries  He never came but would see chatting co workers end bar then chatting again ent  rance while little light kept flashing device  Fed leave then he finally showed said he sorry inconvenience  Yeah dude whatever still left tip but only $2  called restaurant speak manager left pressed Option 4  nobody ever answered  Won't back again <EOR> Probably worst hamburger place ever to  floor throughout whole place filthy  Absolutely disgusting  Management should embarrassed allow patrons see that   The two burgers ordered looked nothing photos didn't taste much better   The only positive place friendly server had   Needless say won't going back  <EOR> This Red Robin should always taste! came opening week know game  seated bar  pleasantly surprised see some non crap beers menu waitress great!

While halfway through side salad main courses arrived   Now being service industry would think would allow your guests least finish appetizer before bringing main course   But least kitchen putting food fast   daughters said chicken tenders just ok but fries cold stale   She hungry enough ate them anyway but again cold   prime rib dip sandwich ok but purpose jus dip flavorful soak into bread edible   However main complaint fact prime rib jus dip grease water     literally!  brought attention Brianna waitress she apologized told she would notify manager duty right away come by   10 min done sandwich onion rings pushed plate end table NEVER seeing manager!  wasn't until Brianna came back table clear plates when told manager never came but already done eating   asked check just here clearly frustrated   She apologized again said she would him   few moments later manager came table   never name he never introduced himself he just approached table Hi you   Brianna said wanted see me? explained issues jus dip told waited come but he didn't just finished meal anyway without jus dip   He said he appreciated telling if brought attention then he can't change it   He could also see hear frustrated experience but all he said departure table he thought he didn't come thus blaming Brianna's communication stating didn't need come by   Clearly big breakdown communication happened here     After waiting 10 min more Brianna came once again just sure everything resolved  told experience anything having because she no control over kitchen managers do   However did recognize fact she triple sat including table did best she could little pop she got   again no negative reflection her   Brianna then asked if wanted pay cash credit told would just use little kiosk table pay   While she standing showed bill absolutely amazed manager didn't even bother take anything off bill even offer any type dessert situation right   Let clear am looking free meal but service industry over 20 years even management   no excuse made would warrant manager doing anything offering anything situation right   all different dining options available choose same area would want come back Red Robin eat again experience let alone any Red Robin matter?  Instead manager passed blame back server   ended paying full meal which came $41 36 rounded $50 tip   Again no negative reflection Brianna because she great but won't back!! <EOR> Had Red Royal Robin burger which very juicy   steak fries excellent  service fast friendly  come back again  <EOR> This worst Red Robin ever dined in  took almost hour food when horrible  usually eat Centennial  food always same  Delicious  can't believe same restaurant  southern charmer akways  didn't taste same half size normal  NEVER eat location  <EOR> Got seated quickly waiter cool ordered food waited looooooog time food  given excuse Because ordered Monster burger two patties why taking long  JOKE  coming back <EOR> I understand may avocados due shortage but if ask if want guacamole instead odd since don't avocados but obv pre made comes container say yes really crappy then CHARGE $2 IT   Any dish normally comes avocado should cheaper if don't it  upcharge bad guacamole substitute just shameful   mean come on   This location nice clean staff nice helpful waiter flummoxed numerous tables but he tried but food wasn't good other RRs to  <EOR> This place seriously needs new management  host struggled seat 3 fanilies soon walked in  waitress pretty short rude us  busy all  kept having ask fries thought bottomless  She seemed annoyed every time asked more  She would refill drinks give something different wanted  family next left no acknowledged them 5 minutes sitting down  All people want good service place needs some help especially cause down town summerlin  dead see why  <EOR> The food good but service very poor odd times   first visit Red Robin   Since live less 1 2 mile away chance try newer food places Downtown Summerlin   never second chance first impression    We semi greeted when walked when employee reached below podium two sets menus finally gestured follow him   don't recall saying word us   Our server came table promptly seeing name tag said good afternoon *name*   He responded Hi *name* going your server   He trained introduce himself give name damn he going even though already spoken name   Odd   He took drink orders soon brought two iced teas table   asked time study menu more when he came back ready order   He also given card text word number join Red Robin's reward program  He seen using iPhone checking into Yelp    My wife ordered soup sandwich combo   She cup Red's Chili Chili BLTA croissant   ordered cup chicken tortilla soup Burnin' Love burger   *name* asked if wanted soup burger before   answered before   long surprised when two dinners brought received no soup   Oh well err human forget lot too   No big deal   My wife enjoyed sandwich really liked chili   burger topped grilled jalapeño very good hot one   jalapeño coins burger jalapeño kaiser roll   also chipotle aioli burger   all talk peppers burnin' love only spicy thing actual grilled jalapeño   burger good liked fries   Since bottomless steak fries wanted some more iced tea refill   *name* never came back see things were   finally flagged down asked more fries iced tea   Since people three other tables *name* could forgiven being overwhelmed work   I finished burger before extra fries brought moved plate center table room fries   When brought *name* removed two plates center taking fork going use fries   Instead used large toothpicks eat some fries until cooled enough pick fingers eat   Before finished meal *name* stopped see if wanted dessert   said back off nice manner   When finished *name* came back ordered mountain high mudd pie   dessert quite good but once again *name* way irritating me   *name* brought check while enjoying dessert rather just folding two sides closed leaving side table no hurry message *name* insisted leaving check holder unfolded almost forced under right elbow eating dessert   picked slapped two sides together put left way   Before finished *name* came back pick check   waved off   When finished looked check sure enough charged soup didn't get   pointed *name* told he never brought soup   He just stared check then walked away never saying sorry forgot anything else   He brought check back he once again insisted pushing opened check holder under right elbow   *name* just doesn't learn   I paid check left   rating Red Robin would three   food bad enjoyed it   Service brought down   *name* needs some retraining   You've open long enough correct   thing won't worry free burger birthday   won't redeeming reward   second chance first impression  of course not!

She made excuses blamed cooks  <EOR> One nicer Red Robin restaurant locations too   staff friendly courteous   food alright   dining experience wasn't awful but certainly didn't blow socks off   usually lot more say reviews but guess lunch wasn't memorable   Overall would say experience okay   would give place 2 5 stars if could      We ordered Fiery Ghost Tavern Double $8 49 mom ordered she really enjoyed burger but she thought would little bit spicier because jalapenos burger she also noticed burger only came fresh jalapenos even though supposed come both fresh fried jalapenos The Southern Charm Burger $13 99 served bacon ciabatta bun thought just okay also ordered medium rare but came more well done side ciabatta bun little soggy side opted onion rings instead fries onion ring breading would just fall off every time would try eat bite it  little overpriced opinion  <EOR> Went kids  When walked table asked booth girl stopped looked said none open     I counted 5 open booths pointed one  She let noticeable sigh walked over  Food came everyone order except me  Finally when came check let them know still waiting    20 mins everyone else finished food dinner came  Haven't back since    Also    they seem put people children half restaurant no matter many children have    So many other places go   food ok best but worth aggravation  <EOR> Disappointing   Seattle originally which where Red Robin started favorites   Since Vegas always disappointed when eat here   Today waited over 5 minutes being seated saw no else being served just walked out   never return!  Lunchtime Monday no excuses! <EOR> This first time location impressed  seated quickly server Dana greeted shortly after  drinks brought quick orders taken shortly after  All questions food answered  Props server being good quick  take note things that  Food delicious always  Would definitely back recommend if you're craving burger ] <EOR> It first time going Red Robin   staff nice helpful   I ordered Guacamole Bacon Burger   delicious burger bit messy trying eat but still good burger   rating experience had   nice place but really restaurant would crave back  nice place good staff but location close Dillard's further away rest Downtown  Summerlin  If area wouldn't mind going back  <EOR> I love location but serves very hit miss    The staff very unenthusiastic which disappointing  <EOR> The waitress bad attitude right beginning   Asked seated   matters huh?  Ordered food asked drink delivered meal   course when almost finished she brings drink  burger would better choice   Tried pay CASH boy problem too   Seems customer service city gone Sh*t!  Won't back   thats sure  <EOR> Red Robin absolute FAVORITE place if don't want spend much but don't want eat fast food  going compare Red Robin's Big Tavern burgers regular sized burger Double Tavern burgers two kid patties instead normal patty McDonald's meals show Red Robin actually cheaper  average BT burgers priced $8 99 while DT burgers priced $6 99  Now including unlimited fries unlimited normal sauce as special ones ketchup ranch etc    McDonald's Double Quarter Pounder Cheese meal $7 43 but  including sauce because charge sauce now  if dine Red Robin you'd only delicious burger but also great service unlimited sauce unlimited fries $8 99 $6 99  If eat McDonald's you'd no service okay burger limited amount fries you'd pay sauce every single time  Red Robin actually cheaper especially if eat lot fries lot sauce  added new burger Tavern menu basically baked potato burger includes bacon fries chive sour cream sauce etc  all burger definitely new favorite  can't flavor price  Seriously amazed cheap burger great tastes  Now restaurant itself clean comfortable  host always greets servers attentive everyone nice but nice because job  genuine  Basically staff any other normal place but weren't amazing enough leave impression until boyfriend Britni server  She only ever left impression all times dined location  She did such phenomenal job really even though short staffed  came Tuesday morning NAB convention seated  took while but she did stop saying she'll right soon possible because they're short staffed  good things she did because she communicated us  She did look she very busy due being short staffed but she NEVER once forgot check give more fresh fries fill drinks many times without even asking she actually genuinely kind! definitely hear voice see facial expressions she being kind friends  There's clear difference between someone just being nice someone genuinely wanting know you're doing your meal see Britni  obviously come back before many times but time asking Britni more often! Highly recommend requesting your server! <EOR> Oh boy under cooked chicken avo cobb problem   Wasn't happy but half way through salad decided return but did inform manager let kitchen staff know check food before sending customer   I could seriously food poisoned health inspector would come then doctor's bill them media coverage then   you point   I still post warn others check meals  <EOR> We've 3 times over last 6 months reasons haven't gone more times because service under shines food  nutshell service probably starts management really bad  moved table another because shift change? always waive server down even when ours refills fries drinks all occasions! last server even said dreaded no combo meals far substitutions instead saying proper see  it'll much more   Server cooks back even made jokes being fries comments loud enough hear then later coming saying it'll few minutes 10 mins smirk face  need makeover management place getting more bad reviews  2 stars food being good but 4 stars all 3 times dining in  <EOR> Joined loyalty program made particular visit free tavern burger promo received via email   around 8 9pm immediately seated bar area    Our waitress greeted shortly began complaining day due free burger promo   Awkward City    but pushed forward    When inquired said promo she sarcastically rudely said she didn't know because she just works     She also forgot take drink orders but whatever no big deal   Despite being very slow repeated difficulty getting attention drink refills condiments etc    I'm glad tavern burger free because fast food quality tiny   Spinash artichoke dip good fries season salt available table good stuff    Probably won't coming back promos anytime soon  <EOR> Environment great service awesome  server Brianna she truly great husband's drink always full she always made sure good stayed top us  Awesome!

When said yes he rolled them back well said Kay  he mean mugged way  into kitchen  main server didn't anything particularly mean herself she just wasn't really pleasant any point    I love Red Robin  I'd tattoo logo if wouldn't guarantee lonely future  say because want express you're better that  <EOR> I Felt sucker eating here!

Very good choice  Didn't feel stuffed all  Very light  Service great too  <EOR> Bad service   funny thing fill two surveys since then reported issues detail but nobody took initiative contact back   if corporate some great idea Hey let's implement surveys! but lacks connectivity actually something when problem brought attention through survey    What's use?  only Red Robbin taken money over crappy service now taken time no avail  take few guys suits want show investors care force surveys into company wide protocol but rest Red Robbin team lacks capacity act upon results even try improve even care    plenty other good restaurants area   Let business replace people care IMHO      SERVICE!!! <EOR> Not fan most restaurant chains place proved why    The food good  burgers very mediocre  cooked asked cooked 4 asked medium all well done   sauces your basic sauces container  Nothing seems fresh  eating place  notch over fast food  But even then some fast food burgers way better    The steak fries big soggy potatoes    The service horrible  busy kept having ask other waiters waiter could order  He also screwed checks ran wrong cards wrong tickets  even correct when he passed them wrong  separate dividers he still ran them wrong    Never again  <EOR> Expectation versus Reality  4 people 4 different pictured menu items = 3 disappointed customers  satisfied dish during dinner reason stars  Avo Cab O salad  Expectation Cobb salad generous amount avocado since name  Pictured beautiful fluffy salad decent amount avocado  Reality 4 chunks avocado 10 diced tomatoes 4 small slices chicken pile fatty bacon chopped whole plate lettuce no egg  actually ask server egg supposed served it  Brie Burger pictured generous amount brie crispy bacon all trimmings Reality dry lack flavor little Brie  Totally worth $14  bbq chicken sandwich pictured crispy chicken bun dripping bbq sauce ranch  Reality dry chicken tenders such minuscule amount BBQ sauce order more BBQ sauce just compensate  Totally worth $7  dish saved star chicken bruchetta sandwich  came looking tasting great! star saved!!    The next star saved server Justin! He provided excellent service despite experience meal he still made visit pleasant! He saved extra star! <EOR> I decided come last minute friend really good experience!  We sat right away server helped real quick very friendly   My friend ordered madlove burger ordered veggie burger  being carnivore all asked them sub veggie patty traditional beef patty because well vegetarian!!  The madlove burger pretty good  only thing threw off bacon dang sweet  almost took away rest flavors because little overwhelming   The veggie burger however probably best burgers ever had! top off bottomless fries just made perfect meal!  We also ordered couple shakes those kind ok  finished nana nana moo moo but ton chocolate both them  Again little overwhelming  Especially Oreo one  expected more cookies cream opposed cookies chocolate more chocolate shake  But honestly overall I'd come back location  just know next time! <EOR> Service decent  Definitely could've better hostesses front more statues anything else  restaurant clearly dirty empty tables wait time 15 minutes  Due boyfriend absolutely loves burgers decided stay    I notified them would come back still came back waiting 45 minutes before could even place order  brighter note allowed try sauces before could order  attitude waitresses because new system end uncalled for  issues payment didn't want leave without making sure transaction successful  Unless time spare attempting leave free food location  once hostess useful in taking money checking system    Food food decent pretty worth regarding bottomless fries  Highly recommended seasonings ask different sauces before settling average ranch ketchup  shakes well worth price pretty reasonable which order monster size dollar extra  mud pie end HUGE!   P S  charged sodas don't know if took bill forgot  <EOR> After eating best veggie burgers ever Red Robin Center Valley PA extremely excited Red Robin downtown Summerlin because close house  told family going great convinced them come show them good was  When wait staff very friendly super excited prime chophouse veggie burger  While other tables seated served table waited 45 minutes before food  When burgers showed forgot waiting because excited eat!

Place looks great but please retrain atmosphere customers  <EOR> My husband decided try Red Robin since never been   hostess greeted informed wait would 5 minutes   15 minutes later she finally seats us   first thing noticed restaurant wasn't busy   hmmm   Our server very nice ordered burgers   She asked if wanted burger pink without pink inside burger   informed want pink burger   However received burger little pink it   also ordered garlic fries which ok    only ordered water lemon beverages   needed ask refills waitress nice but she wasn't very attentive   asked more fries another waitress brought regular fries I ordered garlic    apologetic but experience best experience Red Robin   All all   it 2 1 2 stars but couldn't put half star wasn't comfortable giving 3 stars   Hopefully when eat again give more stars   but wouldn't wait update anytime soon  <EOR> My wife love going Red Robin's across city even some locations Socal but locations kitchen very inconsistent  most because location although live North Las Vegas Staff 5 Venue 5 Kitchen 3  We tried new Poutine Fries menu time   came fast within 5 minutes waitress putting order fancy ipad looking thing   shocked gravy came fries room temperature fries less warm   made whole dish lukewarm best   still great flavor but only imagine good would if came hot fresh   wife ordered burger No Pink most cooked alright but side almost red tomato burger   able let someone know issue more happy prep new burger remove cost without even asking  <EOR> I location almost every week party five  server usually Ashley she's fantastic!

However moving Las Vegas became rare treat  know location Galleria somewhere Centennial area which convenient where live    After dining several times say am very disappointed both food service  Maybe its location but food isn't good remember  menu definitely changed over years  Artichoke Spinach Dip used large enough full meal  also used come small pieces garlic bread  very delicious back day but now horrible very sour can't taste artichoke cheese all! almost tasted chips mayo  Gross  bottomless steak fries used awesome well  Nowadays don't even care cook them very well horribly soggy  generous portions fries now cut down 10 fries per plate  Surprisingly some favorites BLTA Croissant Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap Clam Chowder still pretty tasty  would also point fruit salad awesome! Apples Mandarin Oranges Pineapples Strawberries  Everything like! love fruits but really can't stand Cantaloupe Honeydew Melon    Service consistently bad very slow  hostess sits table seems wait server usually 20 minutes  Then when she finally shows give drink food orders right away because she took damn long  Then happens? appetizer arrives table before drinks  Ugh really?! Most servers even care check us  Luckily Red Robin those Ziosk devices every table pay without having wait your server bring check   Come guys open mall while now time your sh!t together!! <EOR> I food would given star  many tables available but yet wait 10 15 minutes  Then sat wait another 5 10 minutes server then close another 5 minutes drinks  understand someone busy however cardinal rule waiting kids serve kids first  asked if some fries could come young started manager did oblige  kid meal came rest food   My main issue would need something then someone would drop off awhile come back check sure everything ok  Wrong side items food wrong drinks but because server busy just it  would normally recommend but am sure if fluke service location equipped handle decent size crowd  <EOR> Pros bottomless fries service good Cons pretzel bites terrible  1 2 over cooked 1 2 undercooked  deep fried forgot flip them yuck    Basic cheeseburger good  Ordered bit pink but well cooked   Tasty but outstanding   Beer cold happy hour made worth while   With many choice guys better step up <EOR> horrible customer service ordered food once sat down waited over 15 min literally everyone back eating even own server       <EOR>
