That brought back many memories looking forward Vegas style treat  all Old Vegas! She visited day before based reviews really couldn't wait   She came back said staff amazing place the size stamp   said couldn't small pool table    When entering reminded Vegas bar 80'S = perfect! The grill back right corner upon entering you're basically ordering door  pretentious don't expect Ritz Carlton  fact prefer more down home less fancy schmancy  The venue size stamp bar plenty room mechanical bull if wanted there  We came door greeted smile which always great way start meal   Ordering easy given all options toppings burger  asked some coleslaw side put burger highly recommend that!!!  We chose dine your drinks bar even if soda  I didn't mind leave review bar itself  We chose sit booth seat low behold didn't call come food brought out    Now  talking old Vegas service!  Let into food situation The wait average long long enough order drink which means heat lamp Burger  The burger BOMB = juicy full flavor = exactly way wanted it  all fixin's however forgot ask onions  politely requested them brought promptly  Nice! The fries Finger Licking Good = nuff said  My friend ordered chili fries tidy tastefull mess = chili fries should be   I enjoyed every minute every bite meal which exactly why clear way driving Henderson just burger   I decided way definitely need Johnny Vegas hat  avid hat collector figure going hat   Some might complain smoking allowed bar which would bother them while they're eating food however douchebag old Vegas bar exactly expected   I would definitely eat again worth drive   REASONS VISIT JOHNNY VEGAS GRILL 1  Parking Lot 2  Reasonable Prices 3  Friendly Service 4  Great Food especially burger   5  Take Out 6  Dine In 7  Delivery <EOR> Dive bar sure but food outstanding  chef everything order don't skeptical location  hood but come during lunch delivered if within 5 miles  Philly cheesesteak Vegas fries  Both amazing  <EOR> Let start off saying review because ordered eat24  little hesitant because last place ordered wasn't all great it bbq restaurant   However Johnny Vegas Grill definitely redeemed online ordering me! only timing amazing food arrived nice hot delicious!
