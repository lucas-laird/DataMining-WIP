Well immediately made heated  host cashier comes again walks probably 7th time stocking things cleaning tables  level irritation growing more more  Finally 15 minutes really politely stop guy ask meal almost ready?   confused response Oh did place order?   jaw kinda drops Ummm JUST your counter 15 mins ago sitting waiting    Finally dawns Omigosh! totally forgot ordered! did again?    I'm just frankly shocked  stand say Don't worry it  here    He follows front door says sorry sir just forgot    say understand if you're busy forget but guys aren't whatsoever   just really bad service    He says he give food free  decline again   I just can't understand person forgets order he JUST placed  Nobody new comes in  He walks 7 times while you're sitting table no food patiently waiting  actually stop realize  <EOR> Delicious food great service!

Appalled sheer rudeness calmly responded Nothing here  turned around walked right door   never rudely treated establishment where hungry patron willing pay $11 99 supposed good chicken shawarma pita bread   I see reviews Yelp where fellow reviewers talk great friendly customer service place   gotta joke   seriously don't know where begin explain upset treatment received   Needless say never come again next time Vegas adamantly discourage any all Vegas friends patronizing establishment  <EOR> A bit drive strip but if want good kosher shawarma stop worth drive  Small place but service great  food also delicious  <EOR> Food good small place  manager kept making personal calls right register which little strange but food fantastic  ordered 2 shawarma one pita baguette both amazing  Worth visit <EOR> It's authentic food!!! completely tell flavor difference other Mediterranean restaurants dined CA     The falafels perfect!  weren't dry over fried   never Falafel inside pita tahini hummus plus fixins   love pickled vegetables especially Moroccan green chili similar Jalapenos   The hummus creamy made fresh pure olive oil    ashamed buying ones tubs   want eat hummus everything salad omelette fish chicken together pickled vegetables   lunch beyond delicious!
