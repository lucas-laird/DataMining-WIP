They've some very healthy conscious choices menu sandwiches really price pay usually $5 $8 them but filling portion absolutely delicious! California Veggie sandwich favorite because typically don't see sandwiches alfalfa sprouts them! course Sunday 2 for 1 sandwich deal pretty unbeatable great sandwiches these!  Highly recommended those looking stray away all typical fast food restaurants there  place quick nice sit down lunch sandwiches unique! Service beyond excellent! <EOR> By far    place kicks ass when comes great sandwiches around UNLV area  Although prices bit high sheer size  Mind exactly place come if your diet sandwiches at least ones order would any personal trainer wince    Between place capriotti's across street sandwich market around UNLV pretty well covered  <EOR> I tried Boardhouse first time today due fantastic reviews yelp and   they right!!! place delicious sammiches! Charlie Tuna while quite tasty didn't mango chutney hence 4 stars   little disappointing whole reason sandwich   but alas mangoes probably aren't season right now  co worker Chicken Bruschetta said basically life changing okay he didn't REALLY say that   but he acted it   coleslaw little bland side bad per se but full flavor  All all would say place fantastic definite must try I patronized Boardhouse located Craig North Las Vegas    you won't disappointed   UPDATE 25 AUG Charlie Tuna again   this time mango chutney AWESOME!! Definitely perfect flavor off set saltiness tuna   unfortunately bread different time  whole wheat loaf bread opposed hoagie type wheat bread which WAY better btw    either way MUST try! OH lest forget rewards card allows earn cash towards sandwiches every time order!!  OH finally figured when short board combo tuna comes sub roll when order just sandwich  Also if getting short board combo ASK mango chutney 50 cent charge   <EOR>
