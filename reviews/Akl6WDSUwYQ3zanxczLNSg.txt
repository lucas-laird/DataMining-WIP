Didn't take fiance's order either! shocked immediately respond  called manager aimlessly wandering around as number staff 12 people least walking around floor which less number tables occupied   She said she would handle then ANOTHER waiter came over introduced himself took order saying he would look us   We waited food then DIFFERENT lady gave us  Strange  noticed couple across paid complaining first waitress saying food cold weren't happy  another couple next asked come didn't menus when sat down    Our original waitress came back check but didn't communicate where she'd whole time  Very confusing    So then told hostess also walking past said service substandard confusing first waitress didn't properly take orders    original waitress came back rather just saying miscommunication which would accepted accused talking loudly enough hear! Number rule customer service don't aggressive accuse customer!! Argh    They explained way work unique don't person your waiter just didn't understand them   understand can't just food?!  In end discount which manager gritted teeth we fight she wasn't going give initially she charged whole bill   Then leaving original waitress Katrina said hope trip way out  If can't serve customers properly take feedback then may well fire yourself   Totally sucky experience  Pity food actually okay  <EOR> Incredible sushi!    My wife dinner while staying Luxor   able reservation without problem   waiters incredible friendly knowledgeable decor very modern hip   wide variety stuff menu   All looked great other peoples tables iting around     My wife ordered Singapore Noodles   really unique spice profile  noodles soft slurpy dish made egg shrimp cilantro   Delish!

Couldn't recommend restaurant enough  <EOR> So would between 2 star 1 star   ultimately chose 1 star because options available Vegas   terms Chinese food come SGV tastes spoiled fact   However even if weren't spoiled food still subpar   mao po tofu shu mai   First off everyone knows when shu mai Dim Sum which advertised as 4   came 3   color looked very dull made while ago just being reheated till served   Taste wise average   but presentation awful   The mao po simply bad   again advertised spicy   dish spicy all   fact super sweet   like dessert sweet  Really    really   bad  The service decent   but food blah!!!!  Don't waste your time money   Panada express just good if better fraction price <EOR> Only came use complimentary $20 credit Luxor guest   Was already disappointed weren't open during day late night only standard dinner hours really   Hostess tells sit lounge area which still full service wait 10 15 minutes dining area even though saw few empty tables there  chose sit comfy looking couches front lounge area   We waited 15+ minutes anything   water menus   nobody  saw two staff people walk even though weren't waiters could informed whoever need weren't being helped all  Granted hard see being blocked giant pole but still  bartender clear view front could informed any staff  sister finally hostess tell waiting long time without anyone coming by   Our waitress comes gives menu waters while friendly she didn't apologize all keeping waiting   I order yellowtail jalapeno roll sister veggie spring rolls just enough use credit  course two small items which doesn't even cooked took another 30+ minutes  During time couple slips through side entrance seats themselves next us  waitress notices them asks if would see dinner menu couples says 'yes ' Well waited 15+ minutes waitress never came back couple future business   Our food finally comes actually good  sushi roll didn't much rice rolled very well didn't fall apart  Yellowtail jalapeno plentiful much roll could fit  veggie spring rolls portion much larger anticipated jam packed veggies   The rest service kinda alright? Water refilled but she still never asked doing didn't offer take empty plate away  Took bit check  Luckily credit bit cash cover small tip tax didn't wait any more bad establishment  bad actually enjoyed food  <EOR> Mongolian beef good   Garlic shrimp bland  If ask extra rice counts side just FYI  They attentive once food comes table  However did manager walking around   always appreciated  bad wasn't little later meal when couldn't flag anyone down  <EOR> Stay away bartender named Jameson   Rude condescending  If place going charge $20+ plate fried noodles least train staff minimally competent customer service  just being nice human being  <EOR> Luxor provided $20 dollar food credit few restaurants located hotel  decided give having light snack Rice Company  didn't lunch dinner reservations but quickly seated tables  greeted waitress quickly brought some water menus look over  decided order order tuna roll another salmon roll  Each $10 dollars  rolls super tiny but honest pretty fresh delicious  no fishy taste smell sea weed roll wrapped tasted good  atmosphere places very calm quiet  enjoyed rolls quickly soon asking check  Being coupon ended paying less $3 meal  Unfortunately being rolls small bit pricer side sure if would come back normal meal  also serve noodles other rice dishes Chinese food  thing did enjoy other food flavor even though coupon waitress didn't feel bad even small order she treated respect friendly  Needless say tipped well  <EOR> So Vegas came across restaurant  place loos good service wonderful food other hand die for  Pad Thai fanatic ordered Pad Thai dish well doesn't really taste pad taste very plain noodles  bad cause look service 5 stars but all ITS ALL FOOD  <EOR> What happens Vegas shouldn't always stay Vegas   like review Rice Comapny located Luxor  spent over $250 dinner 2 adults 2 small childern   restaurant busy but apps dinner took over 50 minutes come add insult injury cold tasteless  girl front snooty unfriendly waiter rude could never found smell restaurant offensive which should warning evening going stink  only good thing whole night help named Mario trying best everything himself appologized several times delay missing waiter  <EOR> Our family 5 plus grandma ate dinner  $50 food credit Mlife  am glad decided try place out  started Mad Dragon Roll Potstickers Spring Rolls  devoured everything kids even seconds dragon roll which thought going eat myself  entrees tried Sesame Chicken Orange Chicken Mongolian Beef  far crowd favorite Mongolian Beef Sesame Chicken close second  Orange chicken bad just other 2 dishes great  along great meal great service  only water but top refills glasses never emptied  polite friendly   I wait back try some different dishes  <EOR> I'm usually unsure expect when establishment mixes two cuisines together  Historically don't work  only because cultures USED clash but more because type storage required different that   it would take two restaurants' sized storage do  costly owner    They pulled off even elaborate exquisite setting  Considering prices extremely reasonable  tried both Japanese side Chinese  did lean more towards Japanese  Freshness Japanese cuisine requires more attention could why focusing more when good stood more  But honestly both sushi stir fry exceptionally good     would recommend sushi first  Again though always good option  surely again when area craving either  <EOR> Most menu items overpriced   If traditional Orange Chicken version which much more Sweet Sour Chicken lots sauce peppers onions top  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps which appetizer barely any chicken them   All could taste diced mushrooms   Also did use butter lettuce which folds easily used iceberg lettuce   chef should Lettuce Wraps PF Changs benchmark  <EOR> This place actually pretty good just problem prices relation they're serving  food common americanized Asian fare along sushi selection  entrees similar would find nice Asian fusion restaurant such PF Changs but way overpriced  example General Tso's Chicken $23! Once food arrived tasty staff very nice although service little slow considering many servers restaurant very packed  staying Excalibur $20 food beverage credit used here  would only come back if similar comp because place just expensive get  good thing didn't leave hungry portions least pretty reasonable  <EOR> Wasn't sure think first  early dinner bar  Two bartenders behind bar word maybe five minutes only other couple sight  Luckily things changed  bartender thought already greeted other  Ordered few drinks which wonderful! few sushi rolls he recommended great! bartender very friendly  He actually provided best customer service during stay hotel   Great sushi good prices excellent cocktails! <EOR> I admit first visit eatery  feel prices way overpriced  trendy hangout Vegas tourist crowd  I'd give plaxe solid 3 very little offer way flavor food  typical tourist trap place if your looking one  <EOR> Food good Hong Kong Noodles portions appropriate oversized many other restaurants  Server lukewarm once declined cocktails he seemed tune out  Atmosphere somber quiet but bit weird Las Vegas restaurant  <EOR> We loved it!  staff very friendly food outstanding   four chose four different sushi offerings then split them   Hot Dang amazing son's favorite East Meets West   Also ordered fried calamari appetizer amazing too!  Big meaty pieces calamari over fried!  favorite place inside Luxor  <EOR> The only reason because Luxor offering $20 off coupon staying them   So chicken fried rice which okay sesame chicken   sesame chicken wasn't great served rather cold    This place outragiously overpriced time coupon used eating regular restaurant strip better food   The service okay anything rave about   If offered same coupon suggest using bars  <EOR> This probably favorite sushi restaurant Vegas! atmosphere very inviting staff nice courteous    But food   OMG!!!!

Yep someone grabbed right off back chair   reported incident no resolution but found few interesting facts   There several cameras bar but all pointed registers   cameras overhead around theater area only cover entrance exit theatres because no gaming area   guessing thieves know also because NO camera coverage bar dining area restaurant   Safety generally taken granted when eating but warned   Unless cash register your well being 100% your own hands here   As food portion review    did order war wonton soup started which came while filling incident report   good any Chinese delivery restaurant but feeling being inconvenience trying report theft probably killed taste buds   even wait manager comp soup because didn't want eat dinner dealing security    lack of  <EOR> Trying before closed   bartender ask if still seating since hostess want around front   She replied no 10 38 then said stop seating 10 45   wild orchid subtly fruity but strong   Strawberry martini great flavor without tasting chap stub many berry drinks do   seated pub table which promptly left ask sushi chefs recommendations   didn't any   asked fresh   asked liked   asked if fish received frozen why wasn't answer   met um   Flash frozen fine me    fee gets if done boat but some things season I'd people preparing food know best thing eat   expecting much but staying upstairs $20 food drink credit   place closes 15 mins traffic sure afford stay open all   If overhead music might hear crickets   most sections closed area seated looks busy least   few rolls which ok   salad tataki style tuna better   I'd walk place just slice pizza stall down ways  <EOR> Solid 3 1 2 stars but rounding down kick giving place 3 stars  mid week 6 30pm two friends myVegas deal where $50 off when spend $100  ordered kale quinoa dip appetizer surprisingly good  shared two different sushi rolls orange peel chicken  chicken so so heavy batter but good portion size  rolls great very pretty tasty well!

So good place if you've coupon don't care much things cost  I'd stick sushi rolls though! <EOR> Their Chop Chop Band Bang sushi rolls just world! alone deserves 4 stars! But Chicken Fried Rice ordered just good but great  waiter nice but talkative  Kept going Mlife Membership program  Thanks but no thanks friend! <EOR> There 500 better options food Vegas but surprisingly few places Chinese food  second thought based blatantly racist jokes directed towards Asians show evening maybe surprising? any event restaurant quick walk show wife taste something light wound here   I started off Mama san cocktail which quite good followed crab mango cucumber salad  imitation crab? Wow  Maybe expectations unrealistic but sort felt false advertising   I habit asking waiters recommendations case pretty sure said recommendation more price item whether would liking  ended opting Mongolian beef based few positive mentions other reviews  arrived 15 minutes later drowning sauce along some very bland fried rice   For people no familiarity Chinese food served cities New York San Francisco Monterrey Park might place you  <EOR> We super hungry when found place  close theatre Fantasy great location  food delicious Kinda authentic Asian food  Would recommend this  <EOR> The food awesome!  waiters where very helpful manager greeted would highly recommend others  <EOR> Oh my lord  far best meals ever life!
