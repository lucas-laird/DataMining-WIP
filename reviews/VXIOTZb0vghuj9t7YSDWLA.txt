First time bf came near closing time  Kinda empty  weren't rushed but decided share drink since wasn't really hungry didn't want stuffed  matcha float  boss recommended add brown sugar add some sweetness  drinking ice green tea brewed hot tea! refreshing  maybe bit bland especially if your drinks really sweet but main complaint things always sweet perfect  boss really nice he does recommend things gives suggestions  people working front orders cashier seemed struggle little  But considering place new still really nice provided service  corrected order because originally gave just ice matcha tea without ice cream but corrected no time  played some jenga  owner said whoever first winner jenga gets fruit tart  won! D  But because nice shared BF lost twice btw    Second visit place pretty much packed empty very first time  Once again just wanted drink! No matter set chairs tables pick they're really comfy board games all play together! time came bf brother  jasmine iced tea boba  OMG jasmine tea good!! can't even tell brewed tea taste wasn't extremely sweet either!
