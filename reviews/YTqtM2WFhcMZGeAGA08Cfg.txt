Anaconda seemed alarmed french fried face staring but undeterred  He opted red white green burrito which almost much food even him  Note said almost   Service always friendly attentive even when they're busy  haven't encountered dreaded live music yet but space very small can't imagine wouldn't annoying even without amplifiers   All food tried really good  garnish plate ubiquitous inexplicable undressed lettuce leaves called salad chips just okay salsa hot taste  Wish offered milder option especially since soda comes cans meaning no refills when lots cold liquids mandatory  <EOR> Loved Aguachiles  so good!! green sauce pretty dam spicy  also some prepared oysters but weren't big fans  toppings really switched oyster flavor bad way  brother shrimp cocktail which really good too  Neighborhood pretty ugly rest Vegas  <EOR> This very close office I'd driven its pretty run down strip mall  But walk transported little cantina Mexico! staff lovely  decor bright cheerful food amazing!! new favorite spot!! <EOR> Loved food!!!!! waiter super helpful friendly  Vegas best kept secrets  food authentic  far best fried ice cream ever had  chef takes time cook every meal really shows care time put into food restaurant  Can't wait come back Vegas eat again  <EOR> Do yourself favor check place out  3 times week just try other stuff menu but Molcajete amazing    Great ambient lighting perfect small together  <EOR> yummo  this place great  husband some Campechanas   so good !! shrimp tasted really good    prices totally reasonable  Micheladas delicious ? <EOR> I stumbled across Marisco's place when staying hotel towards north end strip closest option even tho still far! boy surprise! ceviche good micheladas extra touch  fancy options shrimp cucumber hanging off side oysters inside around bottom your michelada  decorations very cute inside well   So naturally next time Vegas felt needed back amazing place! However second time wasn't quite special  Don't wrong ceviche oysters still absolutely delicious  But maybe day where shipment fish wasn't quite fresh because Escondido being best ceviche ever just top 5!

We've ever since LEAST once week   Last night some shrimp sauce little heads still attached WOW best far  wish remembered name! In appetizers cucumber <EOR> With 5 star review yelp thought must real good seafood    Eh   I looking something comparable las Islitas high price tag playa popped up  Small yet clean little place  Very attentive server prompt  shrimp la diabla shrimp mojo de ajo ostiones preparados langostina shrimp al vapor   I came party 4    Shrimp la diabla spicy shrimp spicy but bleh flavor garlicky rice ok lettuce side just waste lettuce but really enjoyed beans bc pieces chicharron   Atleast hope  was  Mojo de ajo shrimp garlic butter shrimp tasted more onions garlic  Definitely memorable   Shrimp al vapor steamed shrimp nicely seasoned but almost sweet taste due all bell peppers   Langostinas langoustines nice spicy sauce but only came 3 langoustines  hardly any meat them which made dish disappointing   Ostiones preparados prepared oysters shrimp salad top were ok but tell oysters weren't fresh  used ones sold las Islitas might've hopes high  shrimp salad needed more lemon some salt maybe nice sauce top off    All all place nice clean service friendly prompt  Food ok but worth 5 yelp stars opinion  prices fair but think would first last visit since didn't wow me  think stick las Islitas whenever mood oysters shrimp  <EOR> Five Stars? Kidding Right??? Packed locals' restaurant tucked away corner Charland Plaza E Charleston Maryland Parkway tiny hole wall received rave reviews maintained 5 star rating  enough persuade see all about  Live music goin' everyone seemed enjoying food pretty extensive menu too    We decided start off some Ostiones Preparadas couple popular items suggested employees Shrimp Tecolote Carne Asada Burrito  order couple watered down horchatas check offer valid only Mon Thur 1 drink per table FYI stale ish chips possibly spiciest salsa Pace Picante its way table while order being made   The Oysters first arrive good sized plump looking oysters piled high mixed seafood shrimp octopus IMITATION CRAB!? Seafood specialize in!?!? mix borderline rubbery  Underneath even worse because oysters flavorless  pretty sure whoever shucked oysters dumped oyster liquor down drain rinsed oyster shell re assembled everything again  disappointing  Other flops evening   The burrito plentiful but red green sauces top straight enchilada sauces bottle Las Palmas kind  Shrimp Tecolote rubbery overcooked halfway through done seeing some shrimp weren't deveined properly see photo    sure you're restaurant specializes seafood??? also later found served wrong dish waitress suggested dish! picture correct dish saw Yelp photos shows shell on shrimp red sauce  Ours nowhere near that  Lots kitchen errors service error recieve no stars me  only star great company had  Seafood specialists? EEK! METHINKS NOT!!!  smh    ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter N A D A!!!  Will back?
