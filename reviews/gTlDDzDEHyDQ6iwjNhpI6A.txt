Perhaps being able exactly dish want spiced just but somehow exceed expectations care into individual dishes  particularly recommend shahi paneer  now gold standard which measure all creamy + nutty sauces   I realize review very gushy racking brain some sort flaw lest someone think payroll  could pick location former Burger King Mariana's supermarket parking lot but know what? nice inside you'll never notice  decor simple but comfortable fastidiously clean  ultralounge  reimagining  just restaurant terrific food occasional Bollywood video playing corner television   Service always very friendly  never want ice water staff takes genuine interest enjoying your meal  only way could happier offer cooking classes  Please? Please?! Oh wait criticism! Sometimes think mattar paneer just teensy bit full peas    yeah  best do  Sorry  Mt  Everest simply rather wonderful fact sort restaurant which Yelp should offer sixth star  Mmmm    <EOR> This place amazing  never enough food  educated North Indian food maybe why it  Asian influence ?

Since left Vegas craving same experience but able find something remotely close  Literally BEST INDIAN FOOD ever had <EOR> After talking Indian food Doriee D Andrew C decided check place next day lunch buffet which runs 11 am 3 pm daily  usually order off menu places but some reason seems Indian places Vegas prefer buffet only lunch  seeing bunch positive friends' reviews place figured fairly safe solid choice  Given time arrived I'd say buffet still fairly full since lunch buffet ends 3 pm however never saw refilled while there  first plate tried little bit everything which meant pretty full plate work through  stand outs curry chicken tandoori chicken chili chicken which little kick it  veggie samosa sweet basmati rice ok   and probably acquired taste  Fresh naan brought table warm delicious! burnt old cold some other places  first plate already pretty full just seconds chicken dishes liked   We wanted try milky balls =P dessert but all gone time done eating settle sweet rice pudding instead which believe called kheer? $10 99 AYCE buffet food decent would come back next time craving Indian food  <EOR> Ambience neat food average tasting ! would look some other option close if any ! Portions huge quite pricey <EOR> Comfort Food  Im foodie literally eaten all Indian Places Las Vegas  eaten since day one  say best Indian food ever  taken many people now regulars well friends India told its  real home cooked food  Love place  always continue come only Northern Indian food  <EOR> I gone past  back when 20 lbs lighter owner would always hit me  always weird foreigner vibe EVERYTIME came in  Eventually stopped sitting dining would just grab n go  Hoping little conversation owner possible  Now probably three years later 20 lbs heavier owner won't let forget Haha  b honest kind funny seeing also 7 months pregnant  But every time he's gotta say something weight  don't think he knows pregnant because just shocked he'd treat anyone much less customer  But then again    Weird creepy foreigner vibe    Am right ladies ?  So just stopped spending money all together  due fact hed treat way he wonder he actually handles what's going behind kitchen   Btw buffet crap  <EOR> Shame them use INDIAN cuisine best  Pathetic food no where close Indian state!

Business seems better ever which good sign only feels food gotten really good  Typical Indian lunch buffet fresh baked naan roti complimentary but whole wheat roti especially good would expect come traditionally thin flat but Mt  Everest version mistaken puffy naan bread nice surprise  Whole wheat roti taken place white basmati rice Indian lunch diet   Buffet plates bowls clean shiny  Water glasses refilled constantly every single visit  Finished plates picked quickly  Overall service great  only warning may smell Indian food rest afternoon if your way important meeting small office space maybe bring change clothing if self conscious kind thing  guess proof when eat lunch buffet Mt  Everest immersed cauldron Indian deliciousness   Go now while hot! waited long write review because if really care place want sure right before friends try first time  see Cravin' Cajun review   <EOR> I tried buffet while Vegas   Totally worth!!

I love Indian food haven't any while other boil in a pouch variety Trader Joe's jumped chance try place town hadn't before  Just pulling waiting outside aroma enticing could tell good things awaited   Of course since lunch buffet  someone primarily eats vegetarian vegan immediately impressed number veggie dishes offered loved fact separated meat dishes into different station all together  Everything loaded plate delish!  basmati rice dal veggie korma samosas pakoras everything outstanding  service super kind prompt too!  back husband tow next time! <EOR> Food really good but dinner portions TINY  spent $10 favorite cauliflower dish really small half potatoes!! Highly disappointed portion size considering much costs all eat lunch buffet price 1 small dinner dish  Best bet just lunch buffet unless extra money spend multiple dinner dishes  spent $60 dinner same amount food eat lunch buffet  Maybe just gluttonous pig = But food delicious lunch buffet best town  <EOR> I relied yelp reviews made trip place all way Las Vegas strip   far   took just 10 mins cab $16    came lunch buffet didn't saw asked if order ala carte but sadly don't allow that  arrive bit early food labels buffet wrong  Samosa good naan but rest stuff disappointing  would recommend place anyone  <EOR> We town couple days wanted find some good Indian Food ask locals where might find some immediately he responded no doubt Mt Everest India Cuisine   Walked into restaurant aromatic smells India   just time before people started come   Seated booth table seating also buffet taking drink order told enjoy buffet    All eat Lunch Buffet $10 99 all standard Indian Food but really stood Curry Goat which mesh well Sweet Rice flavors describe just Delicious giving touch sweetness spicy flavor Curry Goat Tikka Masala just good  many reasons being invited someone's home really knows cook    Both Husband enjoyed meal   Being Vegas let's put way good stay business because competition fierce good when Las Vegas again definitely Itinerary ! <EOR> Veggie options very good here! love basmati rice  cooked perfection!

Being Vegas almost every restaurant seems good number reviews fact deceived us  people dined gave good reviews seem tried authentic Indian food thereby restaurant ended having 4 5 rating 1200+ reviews which paints completely wrong picture altogether   When arrived little wait time  lunch buffet some really mediocre dishes  Even choice dishes seemed pretty boring everyday like  When Indian buffet expect some lavish dishes but won't! Tandoori Chicken Fish Fry overloaded red food color both bone dry no flavor  Awful! mess Samosa? talking bad every individual dish but only going sound redundant because everything below par  top everything ruined Gulab Jamuns too! goodness!

I loved Indian food since first discovered during brief sojourn London when seemed only options steak kidney pie starving death  I chose latter  Valar Morghulis ! Anyway person considers curry more drug food usually prepared Indian restaurants which little meat floating sea delicious sauce which happily sop some fluffy toasty naan fill rice  I'm getting hungry again just thinking it   difference plenty tender juicy meat sauce apparently side benefit keeping rent low  Hope don't big britches move Summerlin  Goodbye meat!  I adore Chicken Korma theirs perfect rich creamy sauce just little sweetness those complex spicy undertones keep coming back more bites long you're full  Chicken Tikka tandoori both served sizzling still moist juicy  favorite appetizer unanimous vote lamb samosas  golden little pockets pastry stuffed seasoned finely ground lamb but best thing wasn't sister didn't find hard thing  Mind if ground meat involved burgers sausage meatballs whatever she ALWAYS gets hard thing rest suffer along her  life's little miracles she didn't practically worth sixth star  Will definitely return try lunch buffet but don't surprised if raise price visit  <EOR> I haven't year but time Mt  Everest India Cuisine hasn't lost its mouth watering touch  Bollywood movies play background wait then dine Chicken Mahkani  'go to' meal when come here  Garlic Naan bar none could really just eat mea l itself  Basmati rice always cooked perfection nice accompaniment entrees  Las Vegas' Best Kept lil secret! needs fancy deco when fancy Indian food extremely reasonable price  Vegetarian options always available   GREAT first date place  snd GREAT Happily Ever regular  LOVE place! <EOR> Very good food!
