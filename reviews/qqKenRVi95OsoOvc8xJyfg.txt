Now best korean style chicken vegas! place real good food only chicken but also delicious dessert!! <EOR> Love place! waiting Korean chicken restaurant come vegas! Well worth wait  <EOR> This chicken place bomb! original sauce great hot sauce good too  chicken wing batter nicely seasoned cooked well  <EOR> Not very spectacular   Basically just another place bite   Located food court Greenland AKA 'Koreatown' Han's Chicken little restaurant serving Korean Asian fare   just done shopping hungry some dinner but lazy think where just plopped ourselves down food court decided there   Reason Han's Chicken because daily special   day actual 'Loco Moco' deal $6 95   Really?  Han's serving some Hawaiian delicacies?  Reluctant try gave cause price right   other daily special Curry Rice vegetables $6 95 well   order too   15 minute wait entrees arrived table   Eh   not special looking   fact big pretty plates food looked small portions   Lots empty space dishes   Each entrée came tiny bowl 'salad' basically cut iceberg lettuce cabbage carrots topped light 1000 Island ish dressing   ok similar something fancy sushi restaurant when side salad     Han's Loco Moco pretty similar see other local Hawaii joints serve same dish   Hamburger patty topped fried egg covered gravy accompanied white Calrose rice   Han's hamburger patty pretty sure pre shaped kind buy warehouse store bulk but pretty big 1 2 pound think   But overcooked   patty wasn't pink middle all lending being dry side   fried egg overcooked well!  Big no no   egg should still yolky middle when break egg oozes over your hamburger patty mixes gravy good sauce!  Cooked yolk middle sad camper   gravy probably powdered kind little leave flavor substance   Pretty bland much it   little mushrooms looked almost garnish   Loco Moco needed some help but eaten anyway since hungry   The Curry Rice wasn't much better   Basically big plate thin layer curry vegetables topped bowl rice   curry wasn't greatest full deep all day simmering flavor   likely box salty side   veggies didn't add much party mostly some cut carrots celery potatoes   But damn crapload onion pieces!  Big chunks onion   Now love onions but curry just swimming them   having no meat curry onions overwhelming   favorite   Overall disappointing meal   think if Han's Chicken again specialty chicken   and possibly signature Korean Chicken Wings   Should done time around!  Lesson learned  <EOR> First off screw all fake reviews   2nd Korean Style Boneless Chicken Nuggets Korean Sweet Spicy Sauce undercook   popped first took down   Notice very tender   second nugget slightly larger bit half saw slightly pink red   cut opened other smaller pieces inspection highly questionable   Nope   taking any chances   should took pic but would displeasing eyes chunk spat out   image would crack your screen no question   I let cashier know undercook   She offered apology chance remake it   When respectfully decline she offered refund instead  Very kind but refused too   Reason being don't see myself enjoying whole plate myself you lot    felt sauce unbalance   Typical sweet sour little more heat but sweetness overwhelming   don't drown entire batch sauce all lost   did some pickled radish throw off but best interest create some form formula own   Written off small price   No big deal   No harm no foul   appreciate effort but wasn't me   Maybe if sharing others   I'd normally wouldn't bother review but opportunity back rating   um hashtag vendor food court Korean fried chicken greenland nomnomnom <EOR> I Greenland foodcourt wanted try all spots since they're all new vendors  figured I'd start right most just work way stall stall  Now glad didn't read reviews before eating may skipped it    I Korean chicken nugget meal green onion which comes miso soup cabbage salad white radish rice  pretty good portion more enough    The chicken crispy didn't soggy sauce even when took home  chose soy garlic sauce kalbi hawaii soy glaze which decent but needed more garlic flavor  chunks sweet potato mixed into chicken nuggets well green onion side  didn't say anywhere garnished sesame seeds crushed peanuts if allergy nuts may want tell them The white radish fine miso standard cabbage fine but put thousand island which sort've sweet didn't like    It took while food but guess rather fresh made order refried frozen nuggets  would probably eat again but stick nuggets wings  <EOR> I'll keep short point  just bad turkey few days ago = food poisoning  Came curiosity since area  looked menu   and saw raw chicken sitting counter  GROSS! don't need another bout food poisoning left  Obviously 5 star reviews fake  Hide your kids! <EOR> I ordered Chicken Katsu Han's Chicken Saturday evening  family ordered another establishment couple minutes before  food arrived consumed  done almost 10 minutes before food even came out   While waiting saw tank top wearing dishwasher spending lot time Han's Chicken kitchen no way sanitary   My food finally came out    disappointment  First all requested no cabbage salad meal  specifically asked chicken rice only  couldn't even simple request handled  Next ordered Chicken katsu  Katsu sauce ketchup based sauce  received fried chicken brown gravy  menu states special sauce gravy  If gave clear descriptions food offerings could saved $10 ordered food  gravy funky tasting appetizing    Won't eating again unless feel adventurous try pizzas  <EOR> Newsflash real review place!
