After taking orders sat down girl came deliver beautifully plated desserts lattes  just take photo!     Because excited them both tried latte first but incredibly disappointed! menu staff did warn instead being latte espresso + milk taro flavor actually just taro flavored milk was tea there? constant tea drinker highly doubt but possible albeit very weak   felt 5 yr old sipping milk flavored taro drink  BIG TRAGIC    Next broke surface creme brulee  gave nice little crack supposed though sugar coating quite thin D E L C O U S  love good creme brulee place did disappoint    It very Japanese y meaning besides being beautifully presented dessert itself did overwhelm taste creaminess much added sugar  Japanese all delicacy loved every bite  wasn't large portion but price I'd again    Partway through dessert cup water which loved available  Many legitimate Japanese patisseries cups water available self serve side place cute little corner water infused berries cucumbers  Ahh Japanese  felt tad bit back Japan again    We stayed chatted bit but latte disappointed much left half full  someone absolutely hates waste pretty sad it  Maybe next time ask them legit latte ask add taro flavor  don't care weird sounds because sad drink determined better way next time!
