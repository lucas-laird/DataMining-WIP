Overall good experience think im going back soon  Service great just wasn't WOWED place thought would be! <EOR> Anchor bar popular being fine chaps invented buffalo wing   They large multitude flavors choose both French fries wing sauce  ordered combo lemon pepper flavor fries choose lemon pepper salt vinegar Cajun regular chose teriyaki ginger sesame  honey wings   The wings itself pretty juicy overcooked all combo comes lot food  teriyaki sauce pretty interesting slight spicy kick really enjoyed  If ask they'll let pick try sauce before order if indecisive   The bar seating sort things easier if want able refill your drink keeps way tourist traffic walking through casino suggest sitting instead food court area   Our cashier also pretty cool checking attentive which wasn't expecting food court slash casino bar type restaurant whatever want call it  ?  The entire combo $19 76 which pretty pricy chicken wings French fries but lot food pay  Pretty short Its good try but still prefer cheaper options myself quality food getting  But if area anchor bar must try wing connoisseur  I'm sure come back try again  <EOR> Pretty cool little location located food court area Venetian but way store setup feel little wing bar  some sauces try see would want but would only let sample 2 thus limiting ability choose wisely which sauce wanted  only 8 its huge selection but ones tried 3 total since tried 2 ordered different one just okay   I settled medium buffalo since babies take care opted boneless against normal preference minimize messy fingers  fine but spicy thought would considering mild tried assumed would bit more spicy but really  just preference didn't affect review   The chicken just okay least 3 pieces some unpleasant gristle them though cant certain just sort seemed frozen chicken bites Anytizers ones something  sauce itself other being spicy thought pretty good but prefer wings quite saucy rather just lightly coated served sort dry no leftover pool sauce left basket  also strange spice them sort lingered strangely back throat didn't care for   My wife settled Chicken cheesesteak which think should just called Chicken Philly something since Cheesesteak implies specifically steak though confused expecting anything laid well menu but guess  just suggestion name oxymoron   All nonsense aside quite good but bit small  came grilled onions very tasty well caramelized  Both entrees also came side seasoned fries which good   The service wasn't anything special girl coulter bit awkward shy ordering difficult  also ordered 2 extra ranch sides which cost $1 50! addition give wings when order she asked Ranch Bleu Cheese bit confused since only customer she helped all day we walked right opening confirmed ranch she gave just one  when asked 2 more she said $0 75 each    hmmm really forgot ringing then only standing blank look 5 minutes since?  Anyway said already paid 2 asking see receipt she gave more now making total 2 in case aren't following should getting 3 total then said yeah need more again confused she said would $0 75 pointed receipt paid 2 she said 2 asked doesn't meal come 1? then she it! Overall ity wasn't bad just wasn't great probably wouldn't ever eat again just because isn't worth time money it everything Vegas pretty pricey   <EOR> Awww sad see particular Anchor location Venetian food court closed   Food venues inside casinos no matter casual usually overpriced when stopped delighted see offered good amount boneless wings prices weren't terribly inflated over say might if drive into regular Las Vegas community  wings just tad excessively breaded tastes but weren't bad all   Let's face being Vegas lead lots eating particularly unhealthy eating that  While boneless fried chicken wings aren't healthy any means venue still decent way good amount protein fast inexpensively  RIP  <EOR> We happy find place food court Venetian  original chicken wing supposedly same named bar Buffalo NY   The wings course great  good sized seasoned well sauce overly spicy  wife shared medium order   We also shared kale salad  good blue cheese cranberries nuts raspberry vinegarette  only complaint should chop kale bit more  some huge pieces required some additional tools overwhelming   With all other options food court Chipotle Panda Express Johnny Rockets place certainly won  <EOR> Got fried wings well seasoned casino pricing  Very good tasted home made   return try other things <EOR> It little overrated  better wings albertsons  Also prices very friendly  2 orders wings fries drinks almost 50 bucks! <EOR> I expecting actual bar but essentially counter service restaurant food court    tried traditional boneless wings medium sauce fries Cajun spice    fries best part meal    cooked just right little crispy outside but still soft inside    wings just average    Overall meal just ok    probably back    better food options Vegas better wings other chain restaurants home  <EOR> I ordered portobello sandwich excited try it  know place known wings but wasn't feeling wingey   I should stuck wings  sandwich just good  bread wasn't warmed all way through when bit into cold doughy gross  Waste $10 tried friends fries incredibly salty  tried chicken wing boneless bad  buffalo spring pretty good until taste plastic taste comes in  sure if its because place new but didn't leave good impression      I hope gets better  <EOR> The mild wings tended toward hot beef weck adequate   insulting spending $30 decent but outstanding food manager charged eighty cents additional bleu cheese container  kidding  cheap stingy no way grow your business  many other choices Venetian  next time choose them  <EOR> I'm wing connoisseur enjoying venturing wings wherever am   so why while Vegas?
