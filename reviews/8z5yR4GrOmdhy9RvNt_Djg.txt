Manny P taco crispy pata fried pork taco special sauce Tots tots cheese bacon sauce fried egg if you're mood some indulgence    The buns okay little expensive but good try least once  liked sisig ones but kind ran money before could try other ones    The fried desserts good except priced them odd amount something ended $ 95 just seemed weird food truck give back nickels change  desserts themselves tasty but also small price  But again good try least once   For being only truck serve tater tots which sucker for Manny P taco which now obsessed worth hunting down  But only IF cash  But said before good try least once  Also owners super nice always very gracious customers  <EOR> I'm just going dive right one  really adored Cafe Mocha cake ball  lemon pretty good well  quite enthusiastic bite sized cakes pastries cookies right alley  s'more's potstickers good but then again wouldn't deep fried chocolate goodness?  My coworker shared truffle tots quite delish  quite would order but truffle fanatic  deluxe order topped bacon fried egg  She really enjoyed them but commented The sauce bit over powering  all garlic fries  think creamy sauce slivers garlic did me    Now bet thinking buns when going buns isn't name sake is? buns hmm     frankly say think need work  showed thinking going score some soft fluffy Filipino siopao size softballs cut half mom makes  Image surprise when lift small palm sized muffin top box  even though savory the Bacon Bird coated sweet sticky glaze ?? dough bad little heavy filling flavorful but dry instead creamy  also think needed little more golden brown top  pale Louis Interview Vampire   So all bad jaunt try something new  very least if see them around town pop over some fries cake balls  If could would give 3 5 stars just fact Coke made Cane Sugar Glass Bottles! <EOR> I love Tasty Bunz!!!
