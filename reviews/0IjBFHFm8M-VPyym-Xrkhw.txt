Anyway   we actually ended because planning having lunch Top World but snooty stuck hostess made think twice spending $12 cup soup   thought let's just grab quick pizza    Well mistake was!  stood line 15 minutes  ordered slice cheese pepperoni slice sausage peppers onions Ceasar salad   servings generous but quality mixed   cheese pizza   yuk lets just say better frozen pizzas this   mattress goop I wouldn't even call cheese it bland disgusting   pepperoni slice Caesar salad came 15 minutes later because pepperoni pizzas   totally annoying   super greasy slimy   Caesar salad?  Kinda hard screw up  If you've side Ceasar salad Wendy's    basically same thing but pricier    sausage pizza better three   Oh did mention meal no where sit?  waited few minutes plate hands regretting ignoring biz itch hostess coulda view nice comfy chair instead mediocre slow service horrible tasting pizza joint   Afterwards upstairs tower little sandwich shop no lines panoramic view Vegas!  say when know better better!  Avoid place! <EOR> Like Karyn M only reason came because free pitcher beer purchase pizza   Who would thought podunk place podunk casino would end serving BEST pizzas years?  No joke   picky when comes pizza   Thin crust but thin cracker flaky consistency   Just enough heft support generous toppings   Toppings clearly fresh   Only thing keeping fifth star well setting isn't exactly five star quality   let's call 4 5 stars   You know what?  probably worth special trip JUST PIZZA maybe if you're local but hey maybe even then If find little coupon free pitcher beer then bonus points   mean Veags take before all gets snatched away  <EOR> SAVE YOUR MONEY JUST BUY FROZEN PIZZA!  By far worst pizza ever eaten  All ordered simple cheese pizza buffalo wings  return burnt crust glop cheese middle with ricotta cheese pooped drizzled around damn glop cheese some reason  can't even start chicken  First hard rock tough  Then sauce just made worst! Its jars Lucas Candy put onto chicken  $25 spent managed eat celery came Lucas Flavored chicken   Please save your money might well put $20 bill slot machine bet all  more satisfaction  <EOR> Pizza good both times ordered  4 cheese kind  fair price size   especially Vegas! <EOR>
