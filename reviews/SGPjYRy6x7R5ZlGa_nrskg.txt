piercing ears going off true story 25 minutes  going shoot someone  check took over 20 minutes asked it  longer took food  back  Once again worth efforts walking those stairs   Good luck if try joint  <EOR> Gave place few tries  New management new menu  Couldnt hurt  trip hour spare before movie started  Ordered jack coke  while acutally started time considering movie catch  22 minutes jack coke  Why waited long don't know  But forgiving since work F B looked understaffed only bartender  Bartender never came back check interested ordering just left money drinks downstairs yard house  where able drink some appetizers just time movie    My first visit friend just opened service lacking service took long foos average bar food best  Speed service work understaffing issue cause wanted give place chanceWould come back? probably all other selections Town Square  <EOR> this place disaster  sat bar few nights ago impressed  bartenders terrible no personality down right rude  even charged someone else's drinks then argued when complained bill  place wont last long especially all competition Town Square  <EOR> Hmmm   this place eeks 2 5 if being brutally honest   came costume party privileged receive happy hour priced drinks entire night  ended being excellent deal $3 per well drink think made em pretty well   They also offered free beer those participating beer pong tournament certainly welcomed yours truly  don't think service much write home but cool patio area neat bar area hang in   As mentioned earlier food least redeeming quality place  least pretty well priced happy hour prices  chicken quesadilla filling but pretty bland  think could used more spices  chicken tenders awful tasted something school cafeteria  Dry unflavored   I'm lukewarm place best  <EOR> Food terrible  chicken sliders sweet potato tots  service slow only made rare appearances  pretty sure would enjoyed meal McDonalds more restaurant  only bonus most waitresses cute  <EOR> Unfortunately    repeat D G    way movies only highlight location    connects movies Rave ramp     Do leaving negative reviews    just cup tea     I say however football season large screens disappoint     your constant companion deirdra <EOR> Two stars overall? didn't want believe it  open mind and $50 gift certificate wanted see place all about   There three things say good place watermelon jar cocktail sauteed kale service  waitress super nice hostess bartender both willing friendly chatty without getting space  cocktail fruity delicious refreshing once dangerous  More could meant afternoon bent over toilet especially considering proceeding meal  But digress  the service kale cocktail where good parts end   Chips queso con carne  straight chemicals cold ground beef top fry bread chips  ate because also because somehow affinity Taco Bell calibre food especially place liquor   ate some moved on   I ordered Caesar Salad Mahi Mahi top  fish cold slimy dressing tasted disgusting zero Caesar flavor it  Applebee's better Caesar  it pretty confusing excuse Caesar  boyfriend sandwich hamburger overcooked BBQ pork bacon side salad  salad also particularly weird though both agreed sandwich entree winner   As sides ordered Dorito mac cheese let tell you  Whatever kind cinnamon sugar using cheese sauce portion dish made taste bugs scream pain  extremely judicious using profanity describe foods good bad but safely say truly thought WTF mac cheese debacle? sauteed kale good  I just wanted nice vegetable laden lunch  but wasn't enough rectify meal   I'm very sad say back  cool decor very cool set ideas behind but worth even $11 ended spending top gift certificate  <EOR> Went back again last night  family combo but allowed substitute ribs three BBQ sides brisket pulled pork turkey   some wings too  Food good great  Server good  Kept drinks full  Refilled drink didn't even see it  Sneaky fast  Kids loved bull ride  Don't know stay business though 6 8pm place empty  Kids place sure we'll back  <EOR> Went gong karaoke  Which guess ok deal if sing audience likes two free drinks  If you're booed off stage bunch pathetic jerks free drink  point karaoke good fun  booing people off stage depriving people having fun  Being gonged off stage definitely put damper evening prevented buying more beverages   My 3 friends made 6 free drink tickets during course evening despite being heckled jerks  didn't pay single drink m glad didn't  service horrible  waiter ignored most time took 45 minutes bring friend water she ordered cocktail which brought 5 10 minutes  waiter brought check before even done  being booed off stage certainly didn't help  left midnight  place dead anyways  going back  <EOR> The food terrible!! ordered fried chicken salad made into  wrap    kitchen did cut properly when received wrap all salad fell apart    fried chicken burnt hard pick all wrap   But salad dry bland just tossed wrap    decided just eat fries but found fries undercooked    yay terrible lunch break maybe need few more weeks everything settled    but don't know if take chance    staff bit clueless time least few weeks service better  hopefully  <EOR> The service very attentive friendly but food was   exactly Yelp explains meh  experienced better  did job food stomach but wasn't nachos ever had   *I did love fact BBQ chip nachos where chips made house though! <EOR> Formerly Cadillac Ranch much changed  Brisket pizza satisfactory but thick sliced fresh jalapenos bit much  Mahi mahi very good but somewhat small  Wait staff average down hill there   Music included F bomb dropping rap unacceptable place claims family place  Then 18% Gratuity tacked party 4 adults 2 kids  Needless say wont going back made known customer comment card  <EOR> Sooo   friends all grand opening night  Granted kind crowded but service awful!!!! work customer service guess just thought during grand opening would gone way best customer service ever people would come back but definitely case! ignored bar multiple times multiple bars awful  add insult injury when bartender would even acknowledge sitting rude acted bothering them when u would think would appreciate spending money place guess not <EOR> Let begin review saying 1 star basically management handling situation myself niece few nights ago when dined before going see movie  never eaten before did indeed check reviews before entering place but threw caution wind because less wait time Yard House  Oh boy  where wrong   The hostesses pleasant wait really bad  But then sat strange booth completely separate dining room side bar but part bar because railing between bar    I'm going completely document experience but am going highlight few more deplorable offenses  waiter sniffed drink sure Dr  Pepper  WTF moment number 1  ordered pretty simple dishes because indeed going see movie  niece ordered BLT Doritos Mac Cheese side dish  ordered half house salad Loaded Baked Potatoes Pulled Pork  then proceeded wait 45 minutes before waiter arrived table tell big party taking kitchen meals would very soon   missed movie  Luckily another showing hour later   Next waited again food  During time manager came apologized comped meal gave free dessert   The meal finally arrived  brought incorrect sandwich niece  She ordered BLT turkey club  She wipe all turkey off it  salad poor excuse salad tiny witherlings shaved carrots  loaded baked potatoes okay but drizzling sauces put all over thing  Doritos Mac Cheese seriously worst things eaten entire life  niece both agreed would wretch right table if another bite   We then awaited cookie minus ice cream could take go  waited waited waited  server arrived inform still being cooked we already late SECOND MOVIE SHOWING   decided leave walked door  waiter running met door movie theater give absolutely cold disgusting cookie   Sad excuse place  last  <EOR> totally empty restaurant        this restaurant really doesn't know wants be  serves breakfast all day offers tons bbq selections sports bar atmosphere  slow seems all staff stopped sure liked everything nice but while became annoying   food just ok      fried pickles delicious chili cheese fries tots good but served wire basket paper liner became wet fries paper started ripping all good stuff started spilling all over table didn't eat it     this appetizer would better served plate  the bbq combo platter ribs brisket dry reheated day before  never dry bbq ribs dry brisket  needed rehydrated  goofy fireworks coleslaw bizarre! plain cole slaw sprinkled flavorless pop rock    i didn't even know could flavorless pop rock      neat idea didn't quite work  potato salad delicious         THIS PLACE NEEDS LITTLE TLC OWNERS SUCCESSFUL          OTHERWISE GOING DIE PAINFUL DEATH bad! <EOR> So  really sure where begin     I know place formerly Cadillac Ranch never under previous management  am sure if means am disadvantage nothing comparison benefit being unbiased   We Ranch House Kitchen Monday night seeing movie Rave Theaters   Yardhouse dinner wanted check something different post movie drinks   walking somewhat awkwardly greeted Ranch House hostess 10 feet outside restaurant   She VERY nice but weird spot greeted   Going into restaurant looked great place  HUGE probably big but looked should place successful clearly put lot money into it   Sadly     just only customers joint   walked past mechanical bull bit surprised see girl no more 8 sitting it   strange say least   We finally table quickly noticed employees outnumbered guests least 4 1   first round drinks came pretty slowly friend said margarita awful  ordered wings next beers standard bar wings  bad but certainly nothing would bring back   We two waitresses evidently training   clear girl awhile very interested us   girl training much more attentive spent some time talking table which suppose expected them since place basically empty   Overall sort strange experience   beer cold wings hot but nothing would want back Ranch House Kitchen   REPORTEDLY draw customers most nights but believe when see it   Just sure why anyone would Ranch House when pop down Yardhouse where MUCH bigger beer selection  <EOR> I just recently heard Ranch House   longest time still thought Cadillac Ranch   Saturday before Halloween discovered changed Ranch House Kitchen   couple friends attended Cross fit party wanted try few appetizers during visit   For appetizers 8 piece buffalo fingers medium $11 95 Ultimate Quesadilla $7 95   chicken fingers nothing special   Just your typical fingers didn't really stand me   didn't buffalo sauce   thought tangy borderline sour   quesadilla pulled chicken   quesadilla filled shredded cheddar jalapenos charred caramelized onions pico de gallo   thoughts?  Super inauthentic   Very generic impressed all     When started Yelping knew would comfortable giving not so stellar reviews   didn't give lower rating because appreciate country theme   big fan country restaurants bars because wooden accents character vibe offers   should definitely check yourself   location prime middle Town Square   other hand probably wouldn't suggest place future but other hand wouldn't opposed revisiting if ever put opportunity  <EOR> So girlfriend watched avengers walked ranch house asked hostess see menu kind specials have  8 95 lunch specials thought gonna great      service sucked waited 10 min waiter take order   well ordered honey glazed chicken ribs      once food splitted food      the ribs only 4 pieces chicken pretty small    we tried chicken first pretty simple white rice grilled chicken just salsa top wasn't really expecting     dish pretty mediocre ribs came choice side corn bread      the ribs pretty dry tasted smoked wasnt tender all but good thing dish cornbread seemed homemade sweet tasty tasting store bought premade  server giving pretty bad service he asked 4 times if food alright within 5 min food 5th time he asked if done food which wasnt     felt getting bugged rushed eat food     hope place steps know they're new but service food needs step little   ill give 5 stars next time visit if step notch listen customers yelp love real food    <EOR> I looking something different served breakfast hoping wouldn't resort usual IHOP Denny's type places   never heard restaurant ever until visited Vegas few days visited Town Square Las Vegas shopping mall where restaurant located   10am weekday during last week Dec   place actually serves breakfast all day   wasn't crowded all since place just opened day but menu looked pretty good   boyfriend big breakfast person ordered stack whole grain pancakes blueberries which he really liked tried turkey burger   turkey patty itself nothing special but when added grilled onions melted cheese grilled mushrooms lettuce tomato ketchup mustard even raw red onions didn't taste bad   french fries REALLY good better many restaurants!  surprisingly good tasting flavor!  The decor name you're ranch house there's cowboy type decor whole ceiling covered old license plates   There's even mechanical bull ride   restroom different   dim black toilets sinks  <EOR> I cousins birthday  am really big fan BBQ pulled pork sandwich delicious  would definitely recommend pretty cool place loved music mechanical bull!   The service really didn't stand amazing  why gave 4    BUT EVERYTHING ELSE would come back!! D <EOR> Kids 12 years younger eat free M F  But would think son 5'6 tall still 12 years old? weren't told special    I grilled salmon over kale deep fried green tomatoes  tasted fishy probably because just came back vacation Alaska salmon die for  made 'blah' food mechanical bull son free just tipped operator  most exciting part dining experience  Expensive but hey Las Vegas right?  The two stars clean restroom  <EOR> Stopped movie  never crazy Cadillac Ranch but since taken over Ranch House thought we'd give try  Being beautiful  night sat outside  waiter excellent  haven't such good service long time  food other hand excellent  Very typical bar food  little more greasy most bars though  definitely  say won't stopping back anytime soon especially Yard House just below   I truely hope waiter finds better job more suited talents   <EOR> This really should 3 5 rating   food good deserved 4 but service poor deserves 2 5   RHK took over old Cadillac Ranch  still mechanical bull   guess keeping word 'Ranch' your name basically sticking same theme   I cheddar brisket sandwich would definitely recommend it   brisket came very lean surprisingly   experience takes ding came cold thus low points service   Speaking service extremely sloooooow even though restaurant practically dead   From 3 30 happy hour   Cheap rates beers well drinks 50% off pizza appetizers   ordered pizza appetizer   party liked pizza   crust good came cheezy   Next time want try bbq potato chip nachos   saw another table order looked huge fully loaded    <EOR> Formerly Cadillac Ranch new restaurant's menu exceeds so so food served Cadillac Ranch  While menu focuses country fare also steak fajitas  cole slaw packs punch topped pop rocks which surprisingly tasty  decor seemed relatively unchanged indoor outdoor seating option plus  <EOR>
