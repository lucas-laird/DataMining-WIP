Seriously what's hold up? If people ordering much food should inside but according some other reviews common thing  <EOR> Horrible service    Ordered double del combo go  two people ahead before ordered  Took while food ordered 16 minutes exact  fast food standards  slow  could've gone drive thru received food quicker maybe    Host Sandra She first took order she friendly customer service mind  She then Vincent take over when handing money over    Host Vincent  This particular cashier rude acts he hates job  work somewhere else if don't it!
