Asada nachos yummy! Tortas weren't great place being named them  Overall good back  <EOR> I thought looked little sketchy first  good food very good price  would agree Vanessa N  probably best buzzed but sober still good  also great place eat while getting other things done along mini mall  <EOR> Don Tortaco pretty impressive certainly can't wrong price  much could see made best passed flying colors every item got  Which carnitas plate pastor plate enchiladas taco plate burrito enchilada plate carne asada burrito beef tacos chicken tacos everything tasted home made  even much left over dinner next day still taste good  food large portions  only thing believe we're overwhelmed huge order almost few things  lol    place step regulars sure compete restaurants  <EOR> Great food very flavorful well prepared! Robertos recently since someone requested Don Tortaco definitely Roberto look punk  <EOR> CALIFORNIA BURRITO!!!!! This great comfort food   I never wait longer 5mins food order lot cause chunk  <EOR> A good 24 hour spot  Food prepared order comes hot food flavor  Nachos shrimp platter always good  <EOR> This based service because food usually point   Don't ask radishes when your drive thru because give you  told only customers dine in   getting order French fries saying ketchup only dine guest  don't it  <EOR> This place pretty much Roberto's but reason give three stars because carne asada plate full fat! Gross! Anyway pretty similar Roberto's <EOR> This place horrible  Food bad taste  charge chips salsa  Food microwaved  called carne asada isn't flap meat but cheap cut round steak something similar but charge flap meat first last time calling owner tomorrow inform experience dissatisfaction restaurant <EOR> These guys no customer service skills whatsoever  then nerve hang tip jar drive thru window     No wonder always empty  food just shitty Roberto's which right across corner  Typical Mexican drunk food joint  <EOR> This place bomb    only restaurant worth going side town if want Mexican food <EOR> Girls work very pleasant  enjoy myself every time come dine in  actually read here  peaceful  food always good  <EOR> Closest thing authentic Mexican food service good always friendly   place always clean   Menu similar Robertos but place cleaner food taste much better  <EOR> This Roberto's without hype  Extremely well made food order   Asada burrito chicken taquitos delicious  salsa bar dozens perfectly ripe cut limes which enjoy  only negative spicy carrots weren't crunchy bit soft liking  never Roberto's again!! <EOR> Traveling town wanted food Vegas just good Mexican food craving got!  Service fast pleasant woman working counter extremely friendly  Prices great food amazing  oh goodness salsa could drink it!! Would recommend sure!! <EOR> I think time give place  food never good customer blah  several times them forgetting things would pay extra for  came back more time since location covenant  But time food made sick  definitely wont back this  <EOR> Solidmexican restaurant corner Bermuda Silverado ranch  Ol donnys buddies call cause great spot needs name! adoba plate but just tried chicken taco salad  legit  <EOR> The food always delicious venue clean staff kind quick attend you  food takes bit longer expected come but suppose good thing since shows taking little bit time prepare food  <EOR> I'm gonna throw just robertos DISGUSTING friggin hard find good taco shop day ok next sick eating soggy disgusting food search continues cross off list  HORRIBLE !!!! even tipped buck      bastards!!! <EOR> DONT IT!! I place 2 California burritos al pastor everything carne Asada fries  finished order record time but thin open take peek inside  glad did would've pissed off when home  more fries then meat sure  asked refund lady all defensive she said opened said doesn't matter can't sell anyone else anyway  Then more customers place she relented gave money back  just Lauritas much better hell even Roberto's better Don Tortaco ridiculous lame ass no substitutions rule  Roberto's won't even let order California al pastor even if willing pay extra al pastor  don't even think dictate burrito crazy  Don Tortaco Roberto's say good luck! Comparison photos included decide  <EOR> The difference between Don Tortaco Roberto's?  Virtually nothing all  wouldn't surprised if found owners two similar franchises siblings just competing against each other  They use practically same ingredients all foods taste look seem same just claimed different franchise tag   Blindfold bring carne asada fries each place won't able tell difference  Just Roberto's Tortaco's meats mediocre  Way grilled doesn't even take authentic carne asada  Mexican but lived Mexican food know asada pastor tastes Despite its annoying similarities bad  worth going then but nothing special  would maybe if intoxicated enough since close me  <EOR> Ordered food waited almost hour before food  Worst place ever opinion  <EOR> I am search taco least edible   ordered 2 tacos tossed 1 5 tacos   even close street taco Cal Mexico   more $2 50 each   Highway robbery terrible taco   People really friendly though   Only reason 2 1 people building  <EOR> If you're going Mexican restaurant sure least your employees speak English    Rude male cashier well  Also your tip jar spelled incorrectly  probably why don't any tips  <EOR> I love chicken tacos! Especially Tuesday because they're cheap  see every Tuesday! <EOR> I just dinner Sunday night 6 pm Chile Verde plate  saw cook microwave chile verde room temperature when ate restaurant  30 percent pork chunks all pieces fat too  ate third plate stop  wash hands bathroom then discovered no towels left dry hands  Worst Mexican meal ever 40+ years   The last time said would return  am saying again hopefully forget  <EOR> I can't give location ZERO stars!! really should looked Yelp reviews before going but craving burrito didn't wanna drive Pepe's my mistake   started when asked if could add rice burrito cashier said No  thought odd but oh well  asked no guacamole placed burrito  order placed counter without them telling there  ask drink cup low behold      guacamole burrito!!
