She informed food items ordered  OK    change order  Another 15 minutes pass finally receive food    Which decent world but good  Unfortunately 2 orders weren't correct    decided just eat because didn't want wait another 45 minutes food  frankly KNOW thousands other places Vegas same kind faire equal price    stated concede MIGHT off night but can't think time ever waited long food place multiple open tables  Plusses include humorous bar tender decent food  But let's real only handful places really merit wait long  <EOR>
