Overall music good if rock drinks good if drunk food   if want battle your hangover place    I'm going give establishment 5 stars  <EOR> I tried different pubs recommend philly egg roll if go <EOR> I don't write bad reviews    I'm disappointed  Tina assistant bar tender ignored all night  waited 10 minutes just then acknowledge me  Once did attentive  Which great  But last could say right most time taking amongst themselves ignoring customers  group brought lots if money but no spent because no helped us  OWNERS take care that! Also calamari recipe changed least 3 times  Used amazing  Now plain awful <EOR> Went earlier beer list amazing something everybody big beer girl but let taste test found something   Course liked expensive beers lol  I came swing left grave but both bartenders super nice made sure well taken care off <EOR> From 3 11 15  The over 50 different kinds beer brought here  However  decided Moscow Mules boyfriend beers  Maybe next time decided beer bender here   This place really cool atmosphere way place middle seating each side  bartenders made Moscow Mules good strong  boyfriend  Big Eddy's Cherry Doppleschwarz Anita Grapefruit IPA Coronado Orange Wit  sample  some beers petty dam good    I easily see becoming regulars because great bar excellent drinks good service <EOR> If you're into huge burgers place you! friend suggested try place lunch   sits corner plaza hard find  There's covered patio front dining  When weather's nice it'll cool sit nice cold one   Inside along walls booths barstools  Plenty room sit chill before your food comes out  bar all top shelf brands  There's tv's top bar  music great friend sung just every song came on    The menu something everyone  apps orders cheese curds fried pickles  never cheese curds but delicious! fried just right   pickles awesome too! They're cut long way but greasy all  ordered Swiss cheese burger party 2 thick seasoned well   friend ordered chicken wings  way those wings battered fried reminded southern cooking  Cooking hard find restaurant  waitress bartender polite inviting professional    The menu lot great deals especially taco Tuesday's  Tuesday's offer $2 tacos margarita specials  also offer happy hour specials wings nachos apps starting $5  place great!! <EOR> Great food different beers! more could want? favorite bars Vegas! <EOR> This favorite local bar around area  looks outside may little hesitant come inside but don't let fool you  great happy hour menu along tons beers satisfy your belly  food fantastic well tried pretty much everything menu  perfect place watch any sports event since sports bar lol  come down Rebel Republic drink two locals instead paying those high Strip prices  <EOR> I rarely write reviews when do   it's really really love you   or really really dislike you!!!  Food bad   when brought fiance's calamari thought chicken wings first coz shaped odd like surfboard instead strips rings im used to    for $9 expected bigger portion  Good flavors otherwise   The korean bbq sandwich gets thumbs me    $5 teeny kobe beef slider   really?  My fiance burgers the Eastwood impressed  price we're paying we're better off Bachi burger  fiance thrilled meh burger he just nibbling it  since he did pay $13 such mediocre entree I ordered side sweet potato fries  server bartender Missy gave regular fries instead pointed she said she'll bring correct one    and never seen those fries rest night  This first stop night cold outside bit chilly inside   so kicker all when Missy knocked full glass Dr  Pepper fiance's lap  Imagine dead winter having icy beverage spilled all over your jeans plans later!!!! busser kind enough mop floors apologize profusely   So nearing end meal fiance only left slowly munching mediocre burger  He distracted talking big group friends tell why Missy takes burger fries away without asking him!!! When she came back he told he wasnt done she said saw napkins top thought done   Liar! wasnt any napkins top burger  saw put dirty napkin top took away!  She apologized offered grab another burger take off tab   My fiance works restaurant biz instead Missy telling manager issues having table flag manager down complain! Why wasnt automatic Missy?? should let your manager know when issues IMMEDIATELY because want please your paying customers!!!!  So when fiance explained manager happened tell why manager says would it? manager should first apologize then say something let take off your bill   Why would ask customer want them do? Dont think embarrassing if customer tells you    oh take off bill      The right thing tell customer u'll take off immediately especially considering all cr*p happened us  my fiance told managers customers keep them happy them come back restaurant  The crowd Tell why friends most diverse ppl whole restaurant??   i think majority crowd saturday night bikers dudes wearing swastika neo nazi shirts     not cool if crew black asian hispanic ppl    but then again probably just cr*ptastic night   For better variety beers fantastic food reasonable prices esp during happy hour    ur better off Yard House!  Ok   enough PMS     time donut   oink <EOR> I came last week ordered Kobe beef sliders beer  would probably come just Kobe beef sliders  flavorful loved meat formed into crispy meatball  also extensive selection beer which love because getting more more into beer lately! waitress helped very friendly made lot recommendations beer food selections  boyfriend ordered burger fries ended giving two baskets fries just could both try them out  really liked texture fries fact very thin crispy but little salty liking  feel isn't usually fries though since lot people say fries BOMB reviews    After ate waitress recommended check other side bar where dart boards  grabbed some darts bartender started playing  definitely need some more practice which gives more excuse come here! <EOR> Food good should coming bar strip mall but good lawd!
