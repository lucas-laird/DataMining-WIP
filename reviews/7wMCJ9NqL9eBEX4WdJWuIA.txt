My husband starving keen decent steak  assumed we'd here  ordered outback special sirloin prime rib steaks  asked mine medium waiter immediately asked whether sure because would a bit red middle  Would he done same thing if husband ordered first? I wanted steak pink i e  medium ! red changed medium well instead  came really dry overcooked 100% brown     even overcooked well done  exact thing happen before another Outback different city time sent back the waiter agreed way overcooked but time hungry wanted other things rather wait another steak didn't complain  But seriously shouldn't steak house least able cook steak properly?  Another strange thing two soups offer weren't Australian all big deal but sure why Australian themed restaurant couldn't least soup offer actually consumed Australia   Overall wasn't completely terrible    husband's prime rib perfect medium he requested service acceptable allowed move another table overlooking strip when became available    but sure could much better steakhouse experience elsewhere Vegas  <EOR> I no complaints  waiter Andrew amazing  food full flavor cooked perfection  Andrew even suggested ordering food different way much more couple more dollars  He made experience much better  <EOR> We great experience outback tonight  service prompt friendly  seated quickly waiter very accommodating   brought two messy children waiter very sweet he mentioned he children he understood  food delicious always return  Hopefully next time JUST dad mom    Thank you! <EOR> We frequent Outback California best experience Outback ever had  Park structure 5th floor cross bridge  There's back door just before M M store  If miss turn around you'll facing it  Parking structure costs $3 machine takes debit credit card only  No cash  Ed great server!

Likely but also spend much more it   Would bring date here? Probably not  good pre gaming couple friends? Absolutely  <EOR> Service definitely one  But food added extra star  location needs better customer service because having waste time wait mistake no no me   My family pre ordered food 24 hours advance  knew Christmas Eve busy time everyone  But give full order wrong family wrong time? heck did happen?  My parents kept requesting manager  But guess he she did want talk family all  Mistakes happen absolutely  But easy 5 00 pm pickup turned into time hassle   BA HUMBUG! <EOR> Hate say but worst service outback hostess waiter    The hostess very attentive seemed lethargic   table no napkins utensils waiter could found when needed barely check us   We better off going fast food service provided  <EOR> Hey! ride famous Coke bottle!!!
