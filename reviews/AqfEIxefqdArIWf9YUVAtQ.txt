If your first time visiting try any dish spuds warm banana nut bread  always meat lovers skillet  <EOR> Food good but nothing amazing  Huge omelets  Potatoes yummy ranch which weird breakfast but good  <EOR> So tried place long time ago when first opened very ehh cold overcooked food but dad craving breakfast decided give them try since near parent's house  complete turnover! Lobster Benedict dad Chicken Fried Steak both loaded flavor  funny because really don't omelets but even though bunch omelet options also lot other choices breakfast well sandwiches hamburgers! So if you've never don't hashbrowns spuds  Basically homemade thick potato chips  kind iffy but server told could them soft they're closer textures potatoes potato gratin could them crispy  dad soft spuds just good hashbrowns opinion  Now really surprised Lobster Benedict  probably  5 inch thick pieces lobster each english muffin! came two really fresh tasting well! Hollandaise sauce also really creamy seasoned well  Yum! steal bite dad's Chicken Fried Steak pretty good well  really liked sausage gravy but Fried Steak made sad when some breading slid off but flavor made it   As service server really friendly made sure waters kept full  hours really good well open everyday 7am 3pm  Can't wait come again maybe try Pumpkin Bread hearing lot well Stuffed French Toast  <EOR> I love love love restaurant! staff friendly helpful food amazing try house made potato chips    die for!

Pancakes so   nothing stood out  If you're craving pancakes I'd say try somewhere else  ended taking pancake home along half omelette  <EOR> The host very nice lot people  only server seen side restaurant  did take awhile food come  But understood situation food turned delicious  definitely would eat again  <EOR> This place really good! ordered corn beef hash country fried steak pumpkin bread  Happy New Years 2015! <EOR> SHANNON !

I ended tuna sandwich husband cajun chicken sandwich  food came fairly quickly made order but nothing write home about    did notice menu booze which don't think other Omelet House serves      Even though open lunch dinner Omelet House clearly best breakfast only  doubt back if isn't breakfast  <EOR> Came right surgery STARVING! lived right down street location but just never chance try say am impressed place most likely back weekend more  ordered eggs benedict REALLY good! Usually stickler ham being real canadian bacon sauce being authentic but still REALLY good full flavor no complaints  server OUTSTANDING! Drink refills before ever ran food came 10 minutes checked very friendly! GOOD! <EOR> First time ever going restaurant solely dedicated breakfast foods did dissappoint  seated quickly waitress took every consideration stay confortable original booth few members sun she allowed switch another without hesitation    The fried zucchini okay felt could used less breading but still good  ordered meat lovers omelet can't remember name   good but serving size little big   Nothing wrong that! Enjoyed potatoes came banana bread awesome    Would definitely again! <EOR> Time possibly fastest turnaround ever review   Just home Omelet House Boulder Russell location  just few minutes house bit apprehensive because mixed reviews  However when saw doing brisk business Sunday brunch hour 11 30 fears allayed   It's Omelet House course straight omelet menu  almost gonna order Lobster Fest but figured couldn't much authentic lobster if wasn't $15+  decided Bugsy Siegel #16 instead which say roast beef  Italian red sauce sour cream jack cheese  Within couple minutes server brought pumpkin bread  While texture moist flavor good great  When second half bread use little bit butter offset growing blandness  slightly preferred friend's banana nut bread which definitely going next time here   My omelet just good  little overdone little bland which safe things diner but can't excel if don't take risks  might ask them undercook half minute something next time see if they'll consent  Oh omelet really huge say  might've able finish tried harder but spared belly took third to go  ready same consider sharing omelet friend   The fried potato slices they're all little thick some crunchy enough called chips real star show  come some dried parsley ? flakes some pepper well little bit Heinz ketchup  also add bit saltiness omelet  also tried some Mexi Chicken which killed sensitive taste buds jalapeno cinnamon apple stuffed french toast which yummy all dwarfed syrup   This definitely nice breakfast joint $9 very good value  Check when you're side town! <EOR> This place legit!!! food home style fresh delicious affordable  customer service top notch too  craving food type this  definitely coming back Omelette House next time Vegas  <EOR> We really looking forward breakfast today  Haven't done awhile going treat   At 8am Sunday walked right another couple  first lobby looked rather inviting  large look antiques shop all figurines glasses other cute things shelves  Then noticed yellow caution 'wet floor' sign middle floor  wasn't wet but really needed sweep  Crumbs everywhere  Looked floor ski town when people walk salt boots dries   We watched couple ahead being seated  then waited  waited  No ever came back left  Would really liked try food but never even seated  Won't back  <EOR> Great food friendly service!!  daughter yesterday absolutely fabulous food!!

Depends you're looking for  prefer find new places inspire own cooking full flavor made scratch fresh  <EOR> Went mother's day excited try out  of course wait bit but expected that   probably waited 30 minutes sat down until owner manager came over table told if didn't order now he going kick restaurant since other people waiting!!!!  Keep mind waiter hadn't even table!  taken aback he said he actually even cussed us!  time waiter came over mom crying he couldn't apologize enough   assistant manager even came over apologized but unfortunately person unbelievably rude above them   The food ok but time pretty upset can't really give honest review   way mom talked owner manager expressed upset she outburst waiting waiter come table   He even more rude yelling cussing front customers   trust mom very quiet never yells anyone gets upset anyone   If management changes back   Horrible experience  <EOR> Yelp 31 Day Challenge #7 31  It's QUANTITY QUALITY!!!!

Flavors good service great  Good job guys! <EOR> The place looks old school diner full antiques sale  jack all trades burger which mediocre nothing special  server said came fries but came thick cut potato chips French fry consistency those new interesting  originally ordered chili verde skillet which looked amazing but came pork even though menu didn't say so   server seemed annoyed when asked switch because don't eat pork he assumed knew chili verde meant pork  veggie skillet instead big disappointment  veggies weren't thoroughly cooked looked though just topped veggies scrambled egg  mention coffee watered down  won't returning anytime soon  <EOR> When saw photos website knew try out  omelette looked huge did disappoint! First off restaurant clean bright very welcoming  comfortable eating here  Second waitress friendly noticed things design shirt where gladly gave suggestions meal  Very good service   The omelette came steaming hot covered half plate packed bacon sausage ham can't remember name omelette but believe #36   potatoes interesting option basically potato chips weren't totally crispy  options bread also amazing choices banana nut bread pumpkin bread     Finally sat car ready drive away waitress came sprinting restaurant banana nut bread hand well container left table making sure didn't forget take me!
