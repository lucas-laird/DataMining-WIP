Side note menu's oddly placed back corner away register addition having hard time choosing between yummy options literally difficult order because odd setup  Why put menu wall behind cashier?? There's even room it!  Either way regular sized Berry Good açai bowl $6 99  order took 5 10 minutes since blend everything fresh luv that  açai blend excellent texture but lacked tartness perhaps much banana mix  really load toppings though! diced fruit granola fresh juicy overall excellent bowl  <EOR> I love place  Probably best place found Vegas acai bowls  tried other places fresh Bowlology  fact many different options choose terms acai pitaya bowls  personal favorite Ocean because topped watermelon kiwi strawberries  haven't encountered many acai bowl places incorporate watermelon when saw topper excited    I've tried sushi bowls well  better but theirs if you're craving if acai bowl doesn't fill up  don't many options choose if remember correctly there's only 3 variations pick from    They also nice selection smoothies juices pick from  All which tasty fresh! even juice cleanses detoxes $40 believe which isn't bad comparison other places  come really cute mason jars reuse overnight oats other things  <EOR> It VERY hard Juice N Go   and unfortunately place does either  energizer juice super good! No soapy taste all  Place very clean comfy  also customized pitaya bowl although size HUGE just average  Did taste super fresh  strictly teenagers working although nice don't expect stellar service  prices little high if am going pay much going Juice N Go  would definitely purposely drive juices bowls but if area Costco trips yes would stop in  <EOR> Yes! Delicious poke bowl impressive bodybuilder bowl cool decor super friendly staff low wait time? new favorite place  am excited try juices but need eat several dozen more poke bowls before am ready try other things  menu easy follow guy working front couldn't nicer more helpful  <EOR> Staff best!! Body Builder Pitya almond milk whey protein x2 blue berries instead strawberries no granola no honey!! Super high maintenance order but alway right! Love place! New name but still same great staff  New menu but still all classic bowls if ask  <EOR> My first statement better ice cream  know  strong statement but when took first bite rise shine acai bowl heaven  exactly needed cool off summer  overly sweet creamy ice cream gelato but refreshing healthy taste  bad kind healthy taste but good one  taste want eat healthy every meal    At first thought price little high but now am more happy pay price  much healthier alternative ice cream  could honestly eat every meal summer  Also GMO free!  The rise shine acai bowl vitamin C $8 52  only thing wasn't mango because chunks near core  But just order without mango    100% recommend place! <EOR> Ordered Sea Breeze exactly craving  Customer service good  Quality excellent  Definitely found new fav! <EOR> This only second time both times asked no honey no bee pollen  Guess açaí bowl both times? Honey bee pollen   Sure may big deal but happens if deathly allergic any ingredients no idea included food already taken bite once asked them included? big deal?  Anyways  coming back  listen  <EOR> I super disappointed  First off cousin love getting acai bowls  crave ALL time  ordered Berry Good bowl Hualapai location before loved it  convinced cousin she try Bowlology  tried multiple establishments sell Acai bowls told really liked Bowlology's best  today finally able convince try out  first time tried location expecting exactly same  dismay definitely wasn't   Right moment walked great vibe  cashier welcoming all  She didn't even say hello  take your order   Nothing  No words all  awkwardly approached counter just started order assuming she ready because she said word  ordered Berry Bowl  Exactly did other location  Berry Bowl Acai cousin ordered Makai  Right when already noticed mine different  more pink color bowl before  also know Acai bowls much darker Pitya im assuming made Pitya  consistency blend very weird  think amount bananas mixed into may caused it? sure but weird thick mucus consistency which feel would only bananas  fan  Super sad expecting all  toppings also weren't fresh expected  good amount mush blueberries  No bueno  top now cousin doesn't believe fan Bowlology  She fan bowl either  taste didn't her  also wasn't blended seen others past  hoping just location problem hopefully try convince cousin give other location shot    But right now looks taking break Bowlology just stick Nekter very consistent bowls  <EOR> I 3 days ago tried smoothy the superman pretty good   Then today bowl made custom one  WOW great  back  <EOR> Ordered OC Ahi tuna bowl around $11 pretty straight forward tuna brown white rice Hawaiian salt seaweed salad thick sauce thats soy sauce based  Also ordered green juice offer two sizes wasn't overly 'green' tasting but also sweet  also few salad bowl options several smoothie acai options  order desk sit down restaurant but tables eat if choose stay  <EOR> Came because juice n closed but since first time   totally looked clueless   wasn't even asked if needed help  figure wanted own   help few reviews yelp pictures     Upon paying guy front looked sleepy which understandable   but when handed credit card   he kinda rolled eyes totally welcoming giving back card me   he threw card rather handing me  Cashier wearing grey shirt white beanie glasses far drive! definitely worth it  would much rather wait juice n open    Prices average but somewhere else  Service horrible food mediocre   Skip place different acai place instead   unless you're dressed you're billionaire then they'll definitely treat better <EOR> Came today hiking hours certainly hit spot    I ordered Berry Good Acai bowl  fruit toppings fresh  granola favorite part aside actual Acai blend   bf pitaya feel good  tried some thinking getting when come back    I'm giving 4 stars instead 5 because waited good while bowl  People ordered getting orders first quite confused  <EOR> Finally quality acai spot!

Price only $10 plenty food tuna fresh!! Highly recommend!! <EOR> Oh goodness  place awesome but kids work can't keep orders straight  Especially when during your lunch hour  order Berry Good bowl didn't receive until 20 minutes later  gave partner bowl but mine never came out  gave order someone else made extra other party give away someone else since didn't want it  Great acai bowls but kids working fail staying organized  <EOR> Ok only reason why any stars because juice ordered tastes delicious  However very put off really dirty counter tops floor 2 girls purple hair currently working today  No smile no hello just stood looking bothered disturbing conversation  Super unfriendly staff  Maybe should take moment convo clean place  crumbs splattered berries floor sticky countertops  wonder kitchen looks like?! Yikes! bad probably won't back because juice really good but everything else well    kinda gross! <EOR> Love fresh organic ingredients!  cozy place relax well   working tasting whole menu but Makai impressive   Best tasting acai ever! <EOR> Absolutely love place! delicious healthy! multiple modifications order staff memorized  always very friendly Between Pitaya Acai always choose Pitaya since lower sugar option  Body Builder Bowl no longer new menu however still me  order Pitaya Body Builder no juice add vanilla almond milk add 1 scoop vanilla whey protein no strawberries add blueberries no honey  always perfectly <EOR> In mood acai bowl decided give place try    When walk little confusing where order ordering process  menu wall back restaurant instead cashier no signage direct where order  Finally guy back let know back put order guys then pay counter once done  could improve process more convenient  ordered waited bowl    They pretty quick once called name paid picked bowl  asked rewards card but guy explained previous card offered free bowl purchasing 5 getting killed it  new ones printed soon he explained   The bowl basic but sweeter others before  add little much Apple juice overwhelmed flavor bowl  texture fine but while everything runny overly sweet mess couldn't finish it  If came back I'd likely ask less honey apple juice but don't see myself making spot regular stop rotation  <EOR> This place really nice  prices acai bowl okay but worth it  When come always Berry Good Sea Breeze  <EOR>
