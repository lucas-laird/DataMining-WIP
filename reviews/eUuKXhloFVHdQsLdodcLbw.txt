I greeted friendly smiling man video   small casual place but seemed very clean    set sort Subway   wasn't familiar some choices gave taste few different options reassured several times served no animal products it  I did notice meat options available I opted Falafel bowl which 6 falafel patties bed rice over fresh greens   chose sides babaganoush cucumber tomato small bit tabouli all topped creamy tahini dressing   huge lunch but wonderful blend fresh flavors    I can't wait back again!   If haven't should definitely give try  <EOR> Awesome awesome awesome! Food great potion size more then enough  Service helpfulness well pulse Jo  Great place defiantly going back!

Lots friendly people    The layout if place pretty small  I'd say 30 people max? outdoor seating though   For those say Ehh best Shawarma  wonder really good quality Shawarma taste because just fabulous    Sorry mini epic but now know Iron Man should listen more often <EOR> Absolutely love place  Parsley Nachos die for  once week all contacts workers hooked it! <EOR> Their beef chicken rotisserie old hard   almost cracked molar crappy meat   wil lnever back again Shwerma salad    Stay Away   Olive some other place middle east food guys sell old food  <EOR> I give 2 stars because people working very nice understood customer service being said don't agree place being Mediterranean place reasons well    First thing many might know Mediterranean place 99% time serve Basmati Rice food  place no where close  Second much salad    Infact lot salad  Don't wrong love salad but if am getting shwarma plate want more rice chicken  Mediterranean chicken supposed marinated overnight spices chicken well really blend    Some people might way food but eaten authentic Mediterranean food many many times don't place  <EOR> Love place! Every thing ordered delicious really pack sandwiches  some lady night already craving some more  <EOR> This closest thing Halal guys find even though actually VERY different  place bookmarked longest time but some reason never bothered try it   but once did hooked!   back several understatement times    My all time favorite selection steak shwarma bowl which also offer wrap form plate extra parsley green hot sauce its basically circular tin plate fill rice over salad beef top    your choice tzatziki tahini mmm tahini      cut beef fresh front give decent amount it  Normally fan salads rice but steak shwarma bowl packed flavor far bland  portion size also very decent considering price   split between two people but since two stomachs tend eat entire thing myself also tried curry chicken special had  came piping hot also fullllll flavor  steak shwarma delicious but didn't rice bottom bowl which filled top curry  eat curry rice most people but eating two together mixing own discretion! might try again future if happen craving but think anyone comes Parsley should try steak chicken shwarma before anything else!  The seasoned fries they're really crunchy outside soft inside  If fries you'll these  wouldn't order them again though because didn't think anything tooooo special  Nothing different compared normal fries   One downside place charge fifty cents extremely small portions sides    sometimes eggplant but little cup give ridiculously tiny        Also extremely busy during lunch time! place tiny isn't much seating  very convenient though if you're just ordering go  <EOR> I love place  chicken curry wonderful  love fresh vegetables  salad every time  only suggestion expand restaurant into vacant space next door  People always encroaching your space while eat  turn music down impossible hear workers when order  <EOR> Whoa place awesome  Try hummus shawarma rice amazing  Portions huge usually save half dinner  steak little more expensive chicken but just won't regret it  Parsley also Ubereats but won't able all cool topping options app  keep coming back! <EOR> Amazing food amazing service  eat regularly food always great  Hummus best town  <EOR> Excellent service smile  Food quality very good also  Tasty presented beautifully  fast food eatery its above expectations  staff busy during lunch hour but never forgot smile  <EOR> Great place very attractive prices!

I don't know stumbled across place just craving Mediterranean day think  took sister she LOVED too    I'm kind regular where employees should know name theirs but every time during weekday during lunch break somewhere between 12 2 P M  employees greet serve friendly patient which helpful because don't always know want right away many yummy options!    Also first time really wanted try Hummus but guy counter stopped warned Hummus generously put shawarma before rest ingredients many places try trick into buying extras appreciated that! <EOR> Great healthy food    tastes great    would recommend lunch  Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <EOR> REALLY deserves 5 stars!!!!!! 2 guys worked behind counter very helpful   would say that? would say try it! food really good place clean   I used Groupon happy see good everything place    It seems now every time use Groupon all specials cant Groupon!!

Huge portions reasonably priced tastes very authentic! definitely coming back  <EOR> Very fresh clean quick  recommend medium sized wraps loaded all different salads spicy carrots kick  Also falafel excellent vegetarians! <EOR> I told guy am first timer he offers sample beef shawarma he cut top    want try chicken but he said when he taking last piece left stand sure if he going throw away he said those no good   piece tried good   However when he cut plate he cut bottom which lot fat tough chewy part it   Price wise plate come small scope rice meat salad sauce spicy carrot pita bread $9 49+ tax   According menu ordered beef shawarma bowl should $8 xx but he charges same price plate   didn't look receipt till back hotel worth time back argue $   prices listed web site pretty outdated   Plates $10 25 bowls more $9 tax   guy cutting skin   falafel cook when ordered it   Babaganoush bad   If again may just early chicken wrap instead  <EOR> Very very Americanized   fact hard recognize Mediterranean flavor all   basically sandwich wrap house par subway   no sumac oil olive site      most atrocious feta cheese shredded!  If green salad baguette place if looking Mediterranean fare stay away     The coup de grace low rating big sign porch says no smoking but let people smoke seeps into building <EOR> My favorite Mediterranean quick eat Vegas  love vegetarian options love fact bowls wraps baguette choice when want more carbs not  Lol Highly recommended  <EOR> This definitely favorite  Chicken shawarma bowl  Best yet     it comes side pita bread tzatziki sauce      DAMN!!!! dont even taste good overseas damn!!!! Lol <EOR> One those small businesses really want it  Patient food servers great flavors quality  Fair prices fresh ingredients  Doing everything right  Don't change except improve  try chocolate baklavah  <EOR> I would agree people saying turning into nickel dime inconsistent    ate basically when opened   Good food service   would meet vegetarian friend lunch here   used Groupon over years   consistently put obviously must need advertisement discount customers   Then started making rules use Groupon stopped going always being hassle extra couldn't order combo Groupon   food also began bland lackluster times  <EOR> This place gem  Awesome fresh food there's usually 40% off groupon available  wraps  schwarma look good but always couple mixed plates capture more variety  Cold salad kalamatas hummus quinoa then hot dish  falafel curry chicken favs  staff very nice  If don't know something they'll give sample  New foods intimidating but try something new  You'll love it  <EOR> Ordered Chicken shawarma wrap excellent  All ingredients fresh tasted amazing  Would never checked place but good reviews Yelp  <EOR> Generous portions delicious refreshing! <EOR> I wanted quick bit stopped by  very quick food great! definitely come again when area  <EOR> Me family love place very clean delicious foo  good vegans vegetarians alike  <EOR> My girl hit Parsley ' once week love it As always same thing just nod hook up  hummus made store big ups that Chicken curry nice big portion mainstay girl gets Greek salad add chicken  doing quite some time complimentary water cucumber nice  <EOR> Very decent Mediterranean joint located plaza right beside fried chicken place which also pretty decent! It chipotle subway style restaurant where tell them want your food  Pretty small area but usually take orders go   Portions very generous   however need pay dollar any additional toppings other your food includes    Nice restaurant if you're looking healthier option! <EOR> Food terrible tonight sucks left 4 dollar tip along 26 dollars food just throw all away leave  Never going again  <EOR> Falafel quite good  Music loud obnoxious  probably come again  Prices seem gone bit combined loud obnoxious music only appetizer out  <EOR> I really enjoy falafel here   used falafel burrito but lot easier enjoy falafel bowl ask them cut falafel balls quarters    bowl includes salad rice I asked less your choice toppings   recommend red cabbage parsley tomatoes spicy pickles carrots cucumbers tahini sauce   He perfect vegan lunch dinner anytime area  <EOR> I expired groupon food fantastic! chicken wrap HUGE! also enjoy made fresh falafel  want food tasty but also want good quality people staff staff location top notch! say give them try am sure love it <EOR> Had falafel salad side hummus  Everything g super fresh delicious  Staff friendly accommodating  place recommend  <EOR> Great friendly service  A little pricey portion sizes amount actual meat get  The bf wrap plate two sides two drinks came $25  Thats such deal me  The rice lacked flavor  meats delicious melt your mouth  Delicious tahini amazingly fluffy pita bread  Hummus also lacked flavor  <EOR> Maybe just off night but I'd agree disagree all glowing reviews place  think people might fans because HUGE wraps  saw them making amazed portion size! But lots food ain't style    especially if lots crappy food!

Decent food  However customer service left something desired  <EOR> Me read house  Obvious difference   I quite often always clean  Most time very good sometimes dropped ball anyplace lol  opinion very very good wraps always looks fresh clean salads actual salads just whole bunch cheap lettuce few shredded carrot pieces    If shawarma definitely try place  <EOR> I've coming place awhile now really never dissapoints   I've tried several things off menu eveything consistently delicious  staff always nice welcoming which great   But all seriousness must try chicken curry  really used just getting shawarma wrap but day employees let sample some curry dizzamn AMAZING  great little spot can't recommend place enough  <EOR> Go lunch all time great place eat if you're vegan gluten free  Service bit hectic inconsistent but big deal  <EOR> This place great!

Bowls everything mixed while plates keep everything separate  also discover no lamb goat served main meats beef chicken which roast vertically turning spit  believe tuna options all pescatarians house course falafel indeed served all veggie heads   I originally wanted chicken shiskabob plate but she said would take 10 minutes cook offered chicken shawarma instead  took but wrong decision  sliced pieces meat cold dry side  nearing end day may why    but still no excuse  I'd say wait kabob! Tzatziki sauce too    My bf ordered chicken curry served rice  reminded Thai yellow curry but overpowering coconut flavor  really style  noticed gyros aren't served but again Greek place  Instead you'll find wraps baguette options  Oh try cucumber chiller drink  light refreshing   PS  Groupon! Valid two locations  <EOR> Food absolutely healthy delicious! Large portions friendly staff very clean too  <EOR> It difficult resist ordering usual Steak Shawarma Wrap but took meatless route tried Falafel version during last visit   Parsley never skimped ingredients  wrap jammed packed crunchy falafel ton veggies tahini sauce chickpeas  which typically don't eating original form but eating them Parsley  Portions gigantic! Even large appetite and eat LOT only eat half wrap wraps surely keep your appetite satiated hours  might best order your food even if plan dining restaurant just container ready case can't finish all your food sitting    Even several months visiting Parsley quantity quality food still fantastic  Such shame Parsley located other side world but when hunger strikes remains favorite restaurants consider eating whenever area  <EOR> Me boyfriend decided try something new parsley great surprise  He steak bowl kabob plate  bowl plates wraps beef chicken vegetarian options  super delish little patio front cute   Workers friendly homemade cucumber chiller drink refreshing  If Mediterranean would recommend cute place  <EOR> Had high hopes place but unfortunately fell short  mean don't wrong decent food but place am able rave even place would try second time  chicken shawarma bowl  chicken tasted pretty good but overshadowed way much lettuce bowl filled lot bitter pieces  Overall bad place but definitely better <EOR> Oh god! First all would thank Groupon introduction called order ahead time because best waiting  order consisted hummus parsley fries falafel bowl extra veggies grape leaves red quinoa  portions huge food even better  Trust won't disappointed coming back  <EOR> I really enjoyed lunch yesterday  big fan mediterranean food since usually lots vegetarian options  humus tzatziki falafel platter  YUMMMMMY!

I coming back more often! <EOR> The food phenomenal especially if r looking healthy eats!  Their salads come perfect containers easy take home if don't finish   Their chicken steak nice cuts flavorful meat   Lots gluten free vegan options too  <EOR> I think food Parsley great if overpriced  customer service however another story  purchased two Groupons Parsley only staff tell already used when been  Groupon contacted owners managers but never heard back  Thankfully Groupon excellent customer service refunded payment  whole experience left bitter taste mouth hurry back despite having frequent customer  <EOR> It's okay  Falafel kind salty meat shaved pretty thin  Hummus tzatziki good  would eat again if friends wanted but probably own  <EOR> The front ladies nasty attitude told them if food into combo laughed face if trying joke  And some other people came Middle East being really nice them  <EOR> This place great  travel Vegas work 1x month always wanted try place  am glad did  gotten hummus dolmeh appetizers both good gyro w fries  gyro meat juicy and nice crisp outside fresh pita bread good  suggestion olives use generic black olives not kalamata olives salad hummus    Prices great too  3 items above around $12  Super affordable    I would 100% recommend eating here  <EOR> Great service  Food amazing  ordered steak wrap wheat both hot sauces  Mmmm bomb!!! Big portions too  <EOR> Today first visit Parsley Modern Mediterranean I thought name Wild Parsley    met friend 5 year old lunch   first thing noticed friendly staff next thing noticed portion sizes which huge   order entree comes salad your choice ingredients   want wrap wrap it   rice wonderful beef shish kabab   Right around $20 two enjoy meal little shared Mom's plate  Since serve baklava why aren't serving coffee espresso?  could sneak Parsley Modern mid morning snack if guys don't tell boss   Oh wait am boss no catch doing that  <EOR> Got Groupon whim reviews did disappoint  steak wrap mom chicken curry special  kind Mediterranean chipotle food fresh made order delicious flavors  only thing wasn't super crazy falafel kinda bland but freshly made hot sauce delicious  Overall 'it's must try if love Mediterranean food <EOR> Ordered schwarma chicken wrap  Everything tasted fine until end wrap bit down something hard and   well closest guess ceramic  don't know if some freak accident kitchen but immediately disgusted  removed small tooth sized chunk mouth washed over water examine it  Still couldn't figure but wrap whole time   I couldn't finish wrap that  delicious then! But disgusting  hope no else issue    It very unpleasant experience prevent coming back again  can't even describe nauseated felt when occurred    Again hope doesn't happen anyone  Probably just bizarre event but did happen shouldn't have  FYI  <EOR> My Recomendation Steak Shwarma   I've always fan Mediterranean food but haven't impressed lot places here  Fortunately Parsley trend breaker!  The selection menu pretty small which fine  overwelming  small menu size heaping portion sizes  If you're able finish shwarmas sitting should try those professional eating contests because definitely some talent    The food itself delicious! kind reminded gyro but better The steak nice juicy vegetables seemed pretty fresh used just enough sauce hummus  other mediterranean places where drench much sauce bread gets soggy before finish meal   One complaint small store is  no room even stand line without feeling you're intruding someone's eating area  Maybe just busy day but place packed  bigger more open store would fit them better    Customer service great  Everyone polite big friendly smile whole time  Even though asking some pretty dumb questions like what's shwarma? it? guy talked happy answer sincerity  He didn't seem dumb questions all   I would definitely recommend place anybody! <EOR> So gotta preface review saying   years since shawarma  Sad know! But area work hour lunch found spot yelp gave shot  Verdict? Definitely satisfied  steak shawarma wrap wheat   savory hearty  many flavors just screamed Mediterranean but obnoxious overpowering way  place gem but now inspired compare other places town  Thanks Parsley jumpstarting quest hahaha <EOR> *** Two BEST MOUTHGASMS EVER!*** Just ate first time hubby opted variety things could taste much possible  aren't enough adjectives describe AMAZING place is!

 asked else woman suggested try she Beef Tagine special   Did expect tagine small place decided order special which included appetizer choosing YES chose falafel   Hubby short break needed bite eat but entire meal   perfect share   beef served over perfectly cooked rice   lot flavor beef tagine tender   objection dish overly salted   avoiding adding salt food maybe things less salty but even Hubby said he found salty overly salted   The falafel other hand some best ever had   did taste pre made mix many other places use   really tasted freshly made if using mix definitely adding fresh ingredients it   actually moist inside   Crunchy outside fresh moist inside delicious   tahini dip excellent overly sesame flavored perfect balance falafel   I'll honest falafel good going back today lunch   thinking falafel wrap order  <EOR> Parsely let count ways    all time lunch favorites places literally back door salon   work eats daily sometime 8 us    Such healthy option burger fries   absolutely love Shwarma way slow roasts spit   Mmmmm good   don't eat whole lot red meat but Steak Chicken seasoned perfectly   usually Steak Chicken Shwarma   tzatziki hummus fresh veggies just finish off mine bit spicy green sauce   BTW Shwarmas big usually two meals it   Shwarma treat usually opt Salad wich usually leaves hungry again hour but all toppings meat fills dressing REALY good   also Tagine slow cooked stew basically meat falls apart your mouth tender   Falafel ranks top 3 ever had   also fries seasoned unseasoned   The seasoning everything perfect staff nice smile while feeding decor modern yet inviting   local guy living dream which continue support little guy big buiness world   way also punch card where certain amount next free sure ask register   said Parsely let count ways Mmmmm    <EOR> The service slow couldn't understand employees  food extremely spicy  never told if anything spicy if sauce spicy before added chicken kabob bowl  very disappointed since spicy can't eat it  grape leaves good all say     <EOR> I eat way more I'd admit  Food always great  Service also  Thank   providing such healthy place grab good lunch! <EOR> Service ridiculous ladies behind counter rude seemed annoyed perform duties   My friend asked green salad without dressing employee grabbed oiled lettuce  friend says again she's non oily salad  woman acted offended put out  Then stood watched dump part food friend didn't want back into buffet style bar huffing puffing anger  friend asks cucumbers salad lady ignores slides plate next employee then friend again says she's cucumbers  thought employee going flip out  She threw some cucumbers top salad  The food overly salted opinion nothing special all   Wouldn't return  <EOR> My First time tried chicken shwarma wrap  only delicious well priced huge  deal!

You can't put more stamp per visit even if u buy 3 entrées  You can't combo Groupon   I'd rather them put deals promotions then try trick u every turn into paying full price  There's something right it  funny cause fine paying full price when first came place  just insulting think chest you  <EOR> I'd seen place awhile ago wanting try it  didn't friend picked lunch just review food  filafel wrap  good but great especially price  onions little excessive hard time distinguishing different flavors over that  worse filafels but definitely better least outside vegas  <EOR> The good The steak swarma packed flavor cut very generous portion  The babaganoush smokey overflowing rich characteristics  The salad mix dark greens chickpeas tomatoes purple cabbage cucumbers pickled carrot sticks   The bad The falafels salad heavy oil  fried chickpea patties tend absorb much frying oil  taste magnificent though  serve hummus dipping  salad needed more acid instead base  Peanuts used baklava overpowers walnuts  Instead pistachios Parsley uses peanuts all taste  Honey big component dessert comes kind dry  just reminds peanut toffees Asian markets   I amazed ordered everything less $18  ended taking much home  few customized request could see myself loving Parsley  <EOR> Heads down best casual Mediterranean food Vegas  First tried food Parsley two years ago since then became regulars place  favorites shish kabob bowl falafel plate  Oh yes must try cucumber chiller only place know far where keep its original flavor  Overall friendly always helpful staff create certain type atmosphere always want come back again surprising Parsley many returning customers  Thanks feeding Parsley team!!! <EOR> Parsley found itself regular visits lunch lately   hate everyone including myself refers restaurant Chipotle style but yes essentially Chipotle Greek food    pick wrap salad bowl etc protein chicken beef falafel then bunch fixins   I generally am type tries new things every other visit even if find something like   Parsley pretty much stuck exact same order each time frequented Red Quinoa salad added chicken costs extra then add spicy carrots some green sauce everyone's green sauce nowadays some tahini    salad mix start fairly standard lettuce cabbage cucumber tomato some garbanzo beans mixed in    vinaigrette seen others state mild but tasty    If know nothing red quinoa then we're same boat there's list health benefits Parsley advertises neither confirm nor deny but mean quinoa can't imagine there's any sort deception right?  honest doesn't add much more flavor would expect some scoops quinoa would add salad which why carnivore always add chicken well    would prefer chicken Kabob style vs Shawarma  style but does take quite bit longer them cook kabobs vs just cutting right off giant spinning hunk meat time wins battle    Side note amount different spellings shawarma within photos reviews place hysterical    2016 people no excuse   Anyhow all components combine form extremely delicious salad enough options satisfy anyone would think [tzatziki instead tahini feta olives hummus options fiery red sauce BEWARE over milder green sauce which also packs kick etc]   The only downsides sometimes service seems bit rushed    always friendly but feel sometimes salad ends person end assembly line before finish additions wanted first person    busy want stress quickness factor which understand    Also few times ordered double order chicken received inconsistent    Sometimes giant heap chicken other times doesn't seem much different single    Lastly some extras add include upcharge wish didn't   Feta olives exact   especially frustrating because really only want tiny bit each but don't want pay extra charge large amount give you   realize slippery slope them though    Minor grievances always ended being fantastic meal   One pro tip before go if want indulge sauces ask them give separate container instead having them put directly bowl    Much easier distribute according your own tastes way  <EOR> Parsley always favorite places until today  just order beef tagine which favorite dishes until looked down saw sitting pan all dried out  looked awful  disappointed  Probably won't back  <EOR> Love six piece falafel hummus crispy very good but need help them keep eye frying time the'll come Extra done!
