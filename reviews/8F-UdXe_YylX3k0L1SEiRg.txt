Hopefully other dishes better pho    <EOR> This place utterly horrendous!

Just google name see shut down 4 Times health department    wash pots pans front restaurant parking lot    JUST STAY WAY!  many better places just street  <EOR> Stay away    all really say   mistake reading all other yelp reviews before trying place otherwise would just said no   Looks deceiving place pretty busy large parties taking over tables   only regular menu but if look around you'll see pictures numbers posted wall   Good luck trying find because listed menu there's no pricing   When asked waitress particular picture wall all she could really say fish  Uh could tell fish wanted know kind sauce cooked! In beginning wait staff order but since taking long if forgotten  could miss bright yellow menus still front us? passing expensive pho $6 99 $7 99 chose Com Ga Hai Nam Hai Nam style chicken seasoned rice $8 99   Initially seen entrée version dish going inquire but since wanted seasoned rice chose option   Big F big fan Com Bo Kho Beef stew steamed rice $7 99 but usually sees served French roll instead rice     As waited food arrive wait staff nearby table attracting attention   Although couldn't hear saying actions speaking louder words   talking clearing table apparently previous diners left barely touched strawberry shake table   sure busboy did shake but he sure didn't toss into garbage right away he should have   really bothered plate pho garnishes returned kitchen further use  know he did that?  Well he cleaning cart garbage attached he dumped all other garbage there   But he made point taking plate garnishes bringing back kitchen   looks suspicious me  When plate Hainamese chicken arrived looked awful  Check photos yourself! First off looked leftover chicken all thrown plate covered scallions ginger cilantro couldn't see banged chicken underneath   no skin left chicken!  Part dish tasty skin looked gave healthy version!  Once past little chicken noticed something else wrong   Uh where seasoned rice?  There's huge ball white steamed rice plate seasoned rice half dish!  When asked waiter he said ran seasoned rice   When explained why ordered dish he back kitchen   He came back reaffirming did indeed run seasoned rice he would give discount dish   hungry ate front me   far special   The Big F's beef stew just okay he's lot stew other places   He initially turned off because didn't same color he used to   He pointed lot MSG too   also saw pour soy sauce knew hitting taste buds   When pay noticed didn't give any discount   ask waiter he took $2 off total bill  At least he did that! In end bad food average service suspicious kitchen practices   Although offered few unique family dinner options won't see walking through doors again any time soon   Keep driving plenty other better Vietnamese restaurants along Spring Mountain   Cash only   Update posting review someone contacted saying wife worked part time   He mentioned resell smoothies but reuse pho condiments since bit expensive   last checked bean sprouts limes expensive  <EOR> i think its better pho tried  soup sweet some tried CA prices very good  sister shared combo xl bowl spring rolls tips only spent 18  can't wait again  am going try bubble teas over 10 different flavors which dorian taro <EOR> The staff extremely rude customers service bad  Lady angry group although did nothing wrong I request bill front desk wait long time but all staff look something esle am invisible  donot recommend restaurant <EOR> Eh Pho Little Saigon just fling  because hungry first thing saw   The inside massive just before rush  All tables middle soon filled large families groups having Saturday brunch   My fiancee ordered bowl chicken porridge fresh spring rolls  Both very mediocre  add tons lime spoonful fish sauce porridge order some flavor it  portions VERY large especially price see where lot people coming in   We'll probably try other pho restaurants before come again though    <EOR> Not best but worst  typical phó restaurant you'd find other large cities  place open 24 hours wasn't long wait seating  However need level current cash only policy  My friends walked place Bally's casino 4am!

I first attracted place because recommendations two Hawaii references  When friends walked seated impressed extensive menu  far good  But when order arrived brought rice beef stew instead bread ordered  informed waiter acted he boss ordered bread instead rice  He grabbed menu rudely pointed beef stew comes rice bread needed tell which wanted when ordered  sharply replied indeed ordered bread  My dining partner said he heard order bread instead rice wasn't delirious   rude waiter snatched plate rice brusquely said would wait bread   About 15 minutes later another waiter finally brought bread when almost done stew  Two other dining mates said saw waiter grab bread another table give me  Naturally refused eat bread since previously someone else's table  sure Las Vegas health department requirements but seems restaurants shouldn't re serving food already given others   The stew broth so so flavor beef sinewy tough  way better Honolulu  course can't comment quality bread   I won't return place  understand waiters making mistake orders  However case rude waiter's manner dealing problem blaming customer completely unacceptable downright RUDE OBNOXIOUS  would give place half star best  <EOR> Amazing food quick service time ordered food took 5 min food  Also quick service well see your water half empty filling directly  The food good also good thing place open 24 7 <EOR> I would've given place four stars since love pho much price BUUUUUUT      service SUCKS! many things say bad service here   1  Although no wait time seated wait time takes freakin' forever just them order your food  20 minutes before ordered food  just time but EVERY SINGLE TIME VISIT     2  RUDE  RUDE  RUDE  RUDE  RUDE SERVERS  cannot stress enough  asked forks because mother doesn't know use chopsticks server gave really disgusted face  Um your problem mister server sir?! _______ IF DON'T SERVING PEOPLE ANOTHER JOB  SIMPLE THAT   3  SLOW REFILLS  Dude gave glass water NEVER refilled drinks ever again   server no where seen  he dumped food took freaking five hour break!

I should give place 3 star based fact die hard fanatic years but considering visited place last couple months still poor quality just can't    I remember when first signed yelp saw all poor reviews didn't it  thought myself people know talking about  Kinda when bad relationship everyone else keeps telling need leave but just can't until ready    Well chapter closed relationship no more  Onto better Pho! I orginally put review under wrong location  BAD! now corrected rightful owner  <EOR> The service wasn't great lunch dinner  wasn't even busy but some issues don't really need address detail    As food ordered vermicelli pork egg rolls  bad  Really filling I'd first meal day vegas night drunk rampaging  Several other friends ordered different types pho all same review  Basically pho minty could definitely smell talking about  maybe we're spoiled bay area pretty damn good pho but needa step game little bit spot  <EOR> Took hr them bring food inconsistence food   This place waste space vegas should new management new cook whatever  coming back sure  <EOR> There little doubt best Pho restaurant Las Vegas   I think reason why lot bad reviews yelp because  lot Pho restaurants Spring Mountain  word SAIGON title  Pho old SAIGON  Pho SAIGON 8  Pho SAIGON  Pho Huong SAIGON  Pho Vietnam SAIGON even another Pho Little Saigon unrelated restaurant     think most people confusing place another restaurant because no way could dislike food here    Everyone follows weird profanity filled reviews knows favorite food world Miso Ramen   Pho PHO LITTLE SAIGON only Pho world which would eat over Ramen occasion   Obviously would still rather place Anime Ramen where everyone knows your name only your 1st visit your bowl noodles practically comes show + entertainment    but  sometimes just mood cilantro clear soup   I recommend everyone try Rare Steak Pho   use very high quality cut steak  think might petite sirloin because extremely soft tender just melted your mouth  almost texture Filet Mignon  really liked steak  blood red  don't even cook just poor hot soup over meat serve immediately    The broth crystal clear clean  looks water off coast Hawaii because could see clear down bottom   top broth full natural oils  oils common soups where boil bones over 20 hours  purely natural great visual indication high quality   They use Red Onions instead generic onions! Red onions Pho taste much better regular brown onions    They definitely cheap here  over 1 2 pound free bean sprouts basil  ask extra limes literally hand whole lime and giant lime    Most places Pho 1  Pho Kim Long give half even half lime wedge   If ask extra onions literally slice whole onion give whole thing    The service very quick fast   I think worth mentioning Cash Only  don't blow all your cash casino  save some bring here  also worth mentioning open 24 hours 7 days week    From now only Pho restaurant would ever Las Vegas  only food great but don't sit next typical drunk degenerate immature Vegas Club Douche Pho Kim Long   don't ignored treated crap Pho 1   PHO LITTLE SAIGON also better fits lifestyle  open 24 hours atmosphere more quite relaxing service alright me! <EOR> Probably your best bet late night dinner eventful evening club bar gambling even show! cheap! cheap? Cheap hell I'd think  Also 24 7 restaurant    I rare beef meatball pho eggrolls  would say broth little sweeter liking but still bad  eggrolls awesome! loved it!   Maybe favorite cheap eats joint Vegas besides In N Out <EOR> Their soups really good  come when feeling under weather #162 mint leaves  <EOR> All employees yelling eachother causing interruptions conversations  Server didn't want order wanted order why menu? Suggested noodle soup because wouldn't take long but Bruhh want eat want eat! Others may satisfied service but me  Couldn't even nice meal Christmas  <EOR> If give them 0 star would    My first time ordered some food egg rolls came 5 year old ate told its bad took bite sure enough rotten tasted sour wouldn't let cancel other food made pay it <EOR> Pho Little Saigon takes Cash Only actually preferred coming over Pho Kim Long even though Pho Kim Long voted Best Vietnamese Restaurant Las Vegas   On most recent trip Vegas stopped large group friends   most part all happy orders   food average above average tasting   Nothing great   Although food came fairly fast service good   None workers seemed know smile either   My wife starving ordered #15 #72 #96   ordered way much food because portions huge   If rating them just portion size would 5 stars    #72 grilled pork grilled shrimp eggroll vermicelli   came packed food large bowl   regards taste I'd give 3 stars cause just mediocre   #96 chinese broccoli 3 5 stars good   #15 wife's pho order   She really liked taste rated 4 stars   way tastier Pho Kim Long   Now would return here?  Well would definitely choose Pho Little Saigon over Pho Kim Long cause place also 24 hours   Just sure bring cash expect really good customer service  <EOR> Idk why place such bad reviews coming years maybe 2 3 years never issues service come all hours time day food me   better then most places around town wouldn't coming back long  open 24 7 when soup its always hot  Did mention open 24 7? employees bicker background but never bothered me  usually take extra cup broth 2$ Perfect winter  something casual late night your friends  place <EOR>
