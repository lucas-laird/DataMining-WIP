Very very nice customer friendly owners gets place 3 stars but food alone give 1 5 stars   Though nice Korean place close Jun's House food isn't real Korean food should taste like   First shitake mushrooms should reserved just few dishes since they're pungent   However Jun's seems place many dishes including yuk hae jang beef veggie soup which big big BIG mistake   Instead spicy savory soup all taste shitake mushrooms   banchan side dishes subpar well esp  kimchi bland sad    don't started kimchi soup   Using raw kimchi kimchi soup unheard of   I no idea why strangely sweet until called mother ask   lettuce bibimbap?  Just weird   But BBQ decent if  you're looking Jun's shouldn't disappoint   Jun's food made grumpy now grumpier because posting first negative review   Thanks lot Jun's house  <EOR> This fine mom pop Korean restaurant   food average some dishes better others   really enjoy dduk mandoo gook which dumpling rice cake soup   it tastes similar mom's but obviously no does better she does bibimbap pretty good well give plenty red chile sauce mix into it   big fan bbq items which found rather fatty greasy   The prices significantly higher used pay Korean food but understand difficult must all necessary ingredients desert don't complain much   Overall nice place visit when you're craving Korean food but nothing overly special  I agree however owners servers all very friendly happy help non Koreans navigate menu   <EOR> Food okay better   Lady behind counter needs crack smile once awhile   She should find another line work if shes unhappy   just sayin  <EOR> Husbie visit family Las Vegas over winter holiday being craving Hawaii style Korean take out while now took Yelp find something   Luckily able find Jun's place!!!
