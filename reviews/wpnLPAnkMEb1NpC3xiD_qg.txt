Alright back writing reviews roadtrip   think all reviews hit mark restaurant   esp if you're local HI    it's no Zippy's but when Vegas take it   Staying California Hotel aka 9th island great having place especially if you've mainland quite some time  myself spam musubi aloha bento special   definitely place if you're diet   was laden fat sodium grease any good ole spam made aloha   Just remember place technically separate independent functioning hotel CASH ONLY   no DEBIT no CREDIT can't charge your room  it also super hard finding ATM around hotel only could find downstairs between main lobby entrance casinos  <EOR> Brought friends lunch decor place upgraded new menu bright decor just more attractive comfortable plus take credit cards besides cash now   ordered kalua pork plate local plate garlic chicken   portions humongous!  Food tasty but macaroni salad alittle bland side  <EOR> Koren Chicken amazing! If super hungry   Order fruit punch extra piece chicken mac salad  <EOR> This review long overdue more times count over years    The California Hotel Casino capital 9th Hawaiian island known Las Vegas  If you're Hawaii know truth! Take stroll thru casino odds hitting lottery better never seeing someone Hawaii    Anyway some locals California eat Aloha Specialties  Somewhat reasonable prices decent portions  last visit bowl Saimin won ton side macaroni salad  Saimin broth ok but noodles little thick little chewy  Won tons much dough  prefer more meat filling  little chewy side too  clarify crunchy chew but bordering under cooked pasta  Al dente   Macaroni salad made much mayo  love mayo but if take look pics instead using entire container Costco size mayo two used    Walking line place your order then find seating  No table service  Your order brought if want water refills there's water station  can't speak refills opted water    I know posted other reviews critical Hawaiian restaurants  no exception  Having born raised Hawaii fan place only because family craving dishes served there  <EOR> Service could better but since really enjoy food can't complain much  tried pretty much everything every time visit Aunty Vegas Cali  think funny people travel Hawaii only come eat vacay  lines pretty long  customers sometime sit down table without number  really saimin bento plates spare ribs  Sometimes ahi poki pit chewy  never wrong spam musubi  <EOR> If there's thing miss living Hawai'i food!

This first time dining Aloha Specialties wasn't sure if line always long if just because waiting third festival goers Life Beautiful  patiently waited 45 minutes before placing order but didn't mind because gave indecisive ass some time figure mood for    I back forth between Hamburger Steak grilled onions Spicy Korean Chicken  sister ended ordering Spicy Korean Chicken figured could just sample order Hamburger Steak! Winning!  The portions Aloha Specialties more generous  Let's just say couldn't even see plate because completely covered rice brown gravy  love rice Filipino crying loud! But personally think plate came way much rice  mention size Hamburger Steak size plate  Talk overwhelming! Hamburger Steak thin crispy just but could've used little salt  There's no way would able finish meal alone  say kanak attack?  Spicy Korean Chicken your typical Korean fried chicken! Aloha Specialities nailed one  chicken extremely flavorful moist but best part crispiness skin!   My mom swears saimin! tried some broth just okay me  best but wasn't bad either  big variety vegetables too   As now Vegas local appreciate fact many options choose when missing flavors islands Aloha Specialties now go to list when craving taste home  would highly recommend joint everyone  Great food friendly service    Shoot even Hawai'i locals can't stay away food when vacation Las Vegas!
