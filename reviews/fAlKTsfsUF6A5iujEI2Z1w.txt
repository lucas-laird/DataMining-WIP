Thank John Hernandez hospitality! <EOR> Worst meal Vegas ever  Food dry poorly cooked without flavor  send ham steak back because dry  husband's chicken strips undercooked  Seriously mess chicken strips! $15 20 per plate significantly overpriced  better meals airport  <EOR> 20+ minute wait lunch Wednesday when half tables empty  Slow service bar  Crabby hostess   bad looked cool place  <EOR> Visited Saturday morning breakfast  Good food!   Poor service   server Eric   Never came check us  ask other employees refills water  asked butter toast never came  <EOR> Just ate last week  Really good food affordable price top notch service  really impressed highly recommend checking them out  <EOR> First off food  Eggplant Parmesan delicious suprisingly full flavor very filling  But calamari   ok calamari everywhere go  LOVE calamari  little done calamari it  However $15 received smallest order calamari ever seen  Ever  seen LOT calamari  We're talking roughly dollar per tube here  salty  salty  Second service  easy  none  can't tell server met 5 6 lovely employees during dinner  But nobody ever asked food if we'd anything else kicker? took 30 minutes  right 30 receive check plates cleared  Never again  only redeeming factor place seemed busser? He very friendly only seemed actually working props him  <EOR> From street place looks decent  menu interesting 20 minutes seated wasn't bad  But then took second floor where diners left die    After ordering party sat over hour table no food status update server forgot order ask again complaining begging bread finally brought some  told kitchen staff fighting each other server no control over it  finally walk because didn't believe would ever able deliver food  three young kids passing table    The worst just started avoid eye contact even hiding behind bar because knew things bad  way manager said sorry but nothing else ruining night  couldn't believe place actually exists    Watch if take 2nd floor!  fair people first floor never food either  <EOR> Keep walking   Pros Quality ingredients nice atmosphere Cons Poor service blah food WAY overpriced $5 iced tea $15 turkey sandwich w fries The cons because server didn't checkup throughout meal   Consequently wasn't able order iced tea $5 until nearly finished meal didn't receive until clearing plates   He failed inform any specials   didn't see them until leaving   Also when BF ordered sandwiches server asked if would chips fries   each responded fries  Guess what?  $2 upcharge each meal    problem IF wanted fries but really wasn't mood would happily done without them   Being fellow server seen tricks padding bill   Shame you!  far food turkey sandwich roasted veggie sandwich good but nothing all special   hoping some sort unique sauce bread something but nope   feel more accurate rating would 1 half stars      I'm still willing try original Off Strip location Southern Highlands but I'd skip LINQ location anything other drink bar  <EOR> Spent 100 dollars below average everything ate meal   onion rings cooked all way completely bland dip   steak wrapped around asparagus provolone ok   lemon drop martini meh!  worst though entrees  eggplant Parmesan side spaghetti tasted spaghettios!

Well service horrible  waiter could answer simplest questions which OK if first day  kicker was   the manager couldn't answer simplest questions either  menu items tried order when ordered them waiting 15 minutes told only offered breakfast  When clearly lunch dinner menu  first thought just because waiter clueless then asked manager also no clue   1 2 punch inferior service   When bill came priced average strip property only catch same exact menu item priced 2 different prices  decided ask manager because all other questions asked would taken 15 minutes come back reply am sure    So writing all am actually changing star count 3 2  Since restaurant located very close proximity several other dinning venues would think your excellence guest service would stand place clearly failed that  <EOR> Stopped place because staying Linq hotel  girlfriend sat bar greeted drink food suggestions right away  ended sharing couple appetizers the New york strip rolled asparagus meatball sliders calamari all delicious Steak asparagus being definite Star! girlfriend ordered signature drinks Beachcomber recommended bartender Jeff  She loved while enjoyed few different IPA's including nice seasonal beer Sierra Nevada  The food delicious drinks great service entertainment provided Jeff just great  Very fun experience all around definitely coming back next time we're town  <EOR> We stopped Sunday evening party 12  didn't wait seated hostess very cordial  waiters through trouble getting additional tables chairs upstairs put together table large enough sit together  very attentive despite restaurant getting pretty busy shortly seated  friendly accommodating didn't kill having all separate checks  food pretty good  special which ribeye fried shrimp  steak little over cooked but much  mashed potatoes creamy green beans tasty well  ask calamari which very good  breading wasn't heavy grilled lemon nice touch  friends raved wings chicken parmesan well liked table well  great place unplanned meal definitely back next time town  <EOR> I really think just okay experience nothing spectacular food nor service  felt though consistent reviews service could lot better rings plenty truth visit  hostess front very nonchalant very unpleasant  asked seating also something else she very short unprofessional  food came also just okay  lamb gyro luke warm   Good but won't order again  $13 worth? Nahhh  My fries very cold brand new batch fries made because bad   Did really think could away serving fries temperature?  far price everything guess could say priced just rest over prices food strip   But expected  return question   jury still verdict  <EOR> Wow!!! lamb cheese steak gyro style very very good  fiancee stroganoff   that!  Holy smokes!  Watch rest strip   LINQ your number! <EOR> Had red wine while waiting line die off concert Brooklyn bowl  Enjoyed outside patio while people watching  <EOR> We walking back hotel pool party when realize really hungry  just happened pass place stopped in  really friendly bartender made great experience  busy but still food fast  bacon burger delicious huge!!! only ate third  would definitely come back place recommend anyone wants some good food decent price Vegas  <EOR> Caesar Salad Meatball Chicken Parmigiana Penne Vodka all good waitress wasn't best listener but fixed mistake quickly  <EOR> I ended eating several times trip    The sign says they're open 23 7 seems accurate  sure hour day close but whether needed late night bite early breakfast doors open kitchen ready go  meatloaf great veal chop special night excellent  Breakfast wasn't always consistent but overall must eaten 7 times over course 2 weeks didn't tired place  <EOR> For second location Off Strip decided open   on strip  Located in on Linq Promenade Off Strip accessed through casino outside promenade walk  If you're looking seated meal you'll probably want your way over entrance closer promenade side  hostess table setup looks use casino side more exit  Inside restaurant much smaller expected really dark but seems enough seating throughout accommodate steady traffic    We ended coming wife's birthday having never other location wasn't super familiar offered but them bookmarked some time looked menu before  But when arrived given menu completely different then I'd seen online other side being old menu crossed out  birthday she wanted steak none found  asking server he said specials available menu 3 which steak dinners other pork chop dinner  All special menu items priced $39 99 served side   For appetizer started off some Marinated Olives Three Wise Hummus tray  3 types hummus alongside vegetables feta cheese pita bread  3 enjoyed roasted garlic kalamata olive hummus best  Both smooth creamy added different flavor favorite snacks  But whole tray overall pretty small ask more pita making apps $15 price tag feel bit heavy  olives priced much better just $8 but only thing seemed marinated vinegar salt  just couple olives eating them just finish bowl since no else table liked them    My dinner choice Grilled Mahi Filet priced $24  served over bed red quinoa beans drizzled balsamic dressing  most part dish okay until half way through fish  realized hadn't fully deboned fish stabbed cheek  When find things food usually stop eating but realize fish easy miss bones  But picking through other half 6+ bones still there  can't say ever found bones mahi mahi any other restaurant but if know fish big long bones  finding many done pretty surprised kitchen could overlook something that    The service decent mostly attentive but ask refills simple things few different times  when informed them bones fish no bothered even offer apology     Luckily wife much better luck steak enjoyed meal  But even them being strip can't see prices being worth quality food  Being other location gotten such great reviews quite while might check but staying away Linq location  <EOR> Today while vacation decided visit Off Strip Bistro party four 10 00pm  seated right away table service started quickly water given table  waiter Sam came shortly he pleasant attentive  all ordered different meals lobster ravioli which very good friends meatloaf rigatoni cheesesteak sandwich each enjoyed meal  Sam came over checked table refilled drinks check ready us  future when return Las Vegas eat again  <EOR> I really disappointed experience  start food  hummus platter super tiny poorly presented dips lacked flavor consistency smooth way hummus typically which made hard dip  Steak wrapped Asparagus good flavor but two pieces  Two! waiter did guide menu all  group 11  He should told asparagus dish only two pieces vHe could increased check size and therefore tip he guided large group ours order enough apps everyone  Kale Hearts Palm salad which wasn't bad but Kale pieces large couldn't eat them properly hearts palm diced small which made them almost impossible eat  would cut Kale more but Busser never replaced dirty knife asked replace  rest group seemed enjoy food although few small mistakes things brought table vs ordered  really surprised frustrated all restaurant industry professionals town poor service tonight  waiter walked away every time someone middle asking something ask bussers clear appetizer plates off table because started bring all dinner items before anything cleared  Busser did seem happy request all  ask them clear empty cocktail glasses empty bottles wine off table  People didn't enough napkins forks knives waiter wouldn't stand table long enough ask more item  kitchen messed hold cheese few items well  Overall poor experience despite food being fairly flavorful  <EOR> Had great dinner giant meatball spaghetti  waitress Rose top notch returning next stay Vegas  <EOR> We found Off Strip Bar OTSB Linq during latest trip Vegas impressed ate three meals over weekend   may may know Harrah's dominates block Strip own just everything Caesars Flamingo Linq Ballys   Although rent space Harrah's OTSB independent  and showed   First off they're open 24 7  and serve excellent breakfast   Second OTSB lacks special high roller lines discriminate between gambling whales riff raff like    Third service awesome   especially appreciated bartender Darren made best drinks ensured glasses always half full     The food doesn't disappoint either   Whether ordering sandwich full entrée everything ate tasty appropriately priced   OTSB provides effective alternative casino coffee shop casual dining experience   back!

Es gilt auch hier manchmal ist weniger einfach doch mehr  Es gibt sowohl Sitzplätze draußen als auch drin der Platz der Bar steht natürlich auch noch zur Verfügung  Das Personal war aufmerksam und wir mussten nicht sehr lange warten jedoch gebe ich zu dass ein Mittwoch Abend nicht unbedingt zu den übervollen Tagen LV gehört  Die Hauptattraktion dieser Promenade ist das Riesenrad Highroller und auch hier empfehle ich den Mittwoch nach Sonnenuntergang wir hatten eine Gondel mit nur 4 Personen und konnten wir ausgiebig alle Aussichten genießen  Highroller und OTSB sind eine gelungene Kombination! <EOR> We planned eat hash house but wait long us  able table right away    Nothing really stood experience  why give 3 star  Nothing bad but nothing special either    I ordered chicken waffles  liked waffles but berry compote served just didn't seem work  husband breakfast wrap felt just okay   probably would chose come back <EOR> We looking place grab brunch lucked finding Off Strip  ordered breakfast wrap sans meat  first place ever offered bowl fruit replacement meat usually places charge same price don't offer substitutions   wrap waffle fries delicious fruit ripe which also unusual some places  Would eat again! <EOR> Great service Great location Great food chicken Parmesan fantastic Plus rolled New York strip melts your mouth deathly give john hand attentive kind hope come back soon <EOR> Damn good burgers great service great decoration definitely eat again next trip <EOR> There only 4 must spot places when come Vegas  And Off Strip them  The service bar always stellar  Joey amazing  Extremely hospitable friendly treats guests royalty  I've visited place 4 times since January every time Joey around other bar staff equally attentive  Yes million other places grab drink some food town but place legit  The only downfall crappy phone reception wi fi    Piero's Ramen Tatsu Burger Bar Mandalay Bay other required stops when visit Vegas  <EOR> Jaron great server!

Anyway  another review   We famished decided try place high ratings   Most food expensive but sandwich burger salad selection does break bank   The atmosphere sophisticated sleek subdued lighting leather backed chairs warm wood palette   service very slow but waiter friendly efficient even stirred away spaghetti squash   We ordered avocado grilled chicken sandwich bunless protein burger caprese salad   The caprese salad very good balsamic vinegar thick pungent cherry tomatoes sweet basil very fresh packed flavour mozzarella while rivaling Tuscani's offerings delectable   The chicken really good   Generous portion lot guacamole   salad side but could truffle fries   And finally burger   Looked third lbs tasty meat coleslaw   such great flavour!  Delicious!  So other slow service lack wifi place great  <EOR> Absolutely perfect place food delicious atmosphere amazing else expect dinner? ordered calamari waffle fries appetizer then lamb chops chicken parma main courses everything delicious  Service would better but problem  If happen pass Las Vegas should visit place    <EOR> Excellent filet mignon asparagus mashed potatoes    Also spaghetti meatball giant meatball!

Am letzten Abend gab es zum Abschluss einen Burger  Da dieser Laden im LinQ die neue erst seit 2014 bestehende Straße die zum High Roller führt ist und wir ihn noch nicht getestet hatten war ich etwas besorgt dass der letzte Burger für die nächsten Monate eventuell enttäuschend sein könnte aber die Sorge erwies sich als unbegründet  Mein M O A B  Burger war exzellent beef patty mit Bacon über Hickoryholz geräuchert karamellisierte Zwiebeln Pilze und dazu Käse  Fast noch besser war aber die Beilage Trüffelpommes mit Parmesan und frischer Petersilie   An die Vorspeise kann ich mich leider nicht mehr im Detail erinnern aber ich weiß dass wir uns drum gerpügelt haben wer die letzte prawn haben durfte Zudem hatten wir einen echten Logenplatz draußen mit Blick auf das Riesenrad und das geschäftige Treiben bei einem lauen Sommerlüftchen   Das Off Strip löst definitiv ein anderes Lieblingsrestaurant Vegas ab! <EOR> EXCELLENT service great food  Beef Strogenoff sauce outstanding! cheesecake second none  Highly Recommended! <EOR> I'm sure place worth money  burger didn't meet expectations it falling apart   service also very great though terrible  <EOR> I've always heard $1 99 middle night steak special Vegas but honestly sounded sketchy hell   Even few drinks two dollar steak doesn't sit right   But love novelty Vegas all quirks!
