 understaffed meat over cooked even managed mess baked potatoes   over 20 years coming Las Vegas undoubtedly worst meal ever state Nevada   Tony Roma would rolling over grave if he knew bad place was   if Tony Roma still alive eating place would probably give heart attack would put grave   Then he roll it   Seriously place truly awful   If look most reviews most very positive because enjoy going out  But time felt compelled spread word warn others   buffet Fremont Hotel Casino much better  <EOR> Edible service servers kind awkward  checked ever 10 seconds 3 4 diff people  sure real server maybe just tip pool  If don't catch special steak price food someone expensive reg burger fries quality sub par  Silverware dishes dirty <EOR> Not worth wait  Service good though  But food very good  If senior then may your place  <EOR> Cannot recommend place  doing Fremont street experience bartender recommended place  place looked packed wait usually good sign right? Plus love ribs!  This dining experience horrible! server rude she clearly wrong job  Tips great hon? Polish resume sweetheart Cuz working tips surely gonna pay YOUR rent   Ribs served barely Luke warm tender but flavorless  Microwaved fake baked potatoes undercooked  Margarine instead butter tiny plastic containers impossible scoop out  Rude waitress said did butter knives scoop crappy margarine  Finally used other end fork fake butter out  But point through all effort put hard potato could eat  could put stale rolls but why bother gonna eat those stale rolls anyway   We did know whether laugh cry  took uneaten meal containers gave homeless guy  felt bad passing meal poor unsuspecting soul   Avoid place plague  <EOR> Not great  Just cheap   Steak small scrappy looking  needs steak sauce   Lobster no taste very small  Potato good  $4 soup excellent   Wait time hour worth if hungry   It's more novelty meal real meal  Steak lobster 11 99   My son ribs chicken tenders did ribs enough finish them  $8 99 prime rib gone time ordered   Wished could more positive  <EOR> At end Vegas trip decided Fremont Street explore something new see all lights always see all those old movies  starving saw Tony Roma's special lit sign figured why not?

BLAH  <EOR> Worst service life husband's birthday This place truly sucks  asked if did anything birthdays said no really  Which means lazy won't anything worthless place worthless service <EOR> We all decided ribs tonight remembered seeing Tony Roma's downtown Las Vegas  really enjoyed eatery when back home Hawaii also Redondo Beach CA which since closed down    The place packed but seated no time  server brought drinks quickly actually impressed seeing busy was    We ordered steak pork ribs chicken  plate came specifically asked dark meat chicken  server nice she way dark meat claiming Chefs choice chicken type  Ive many times know she incorrect  Nonetheless rectified   Our server very polite friendly quick attend needs  she checked asked if needed service  food came fresh tasty least mine did  friends claimed steaks ok review really personal experience food ate    Foodies place decent left satisfied  Try might it  <EOR> I live downtown every week two takeout  guess because neighborhood don't take phone orders need order person    Went last night ordered  Sat bar always wait  Virtually no place but totally ignored bartenders     My wife always gets same thing   potato skins mozzarella sticks   think they're meh but she loves them which why there  always something different   last night ribeye which before but last night kind blah   tough flavorless  Hey love ribs continue especially since Mrs  likes skins  <EOR> They star because food good  But wow service bad! last year same experience but wanted give them another chance  Bad call! The waitress horrible even forgot extra dressing salads   When asked reply oh yea well should enough still never dressing  When time pay told front since busy could ring up  Then when asked bartender ring bill he told he part restaurant over he tossed bill back  When leaving thinking 2 hours lost won't back guess standing front handing numbers people taking names   Yes Manager   hostess another employee but man should watching making sure customer service being met  Tony Roma's really needs some help all 8 never back! <EOR> I can't give restaurant more two stars  Great waitress but food below standard its price  Ordered half BBQ chicken tons gristle much meat it  Just underwhelmed quality food  hostess' rather using intercom announce orders kept yelling them out  Very annoying  <EOR> $12 99 steak lobster caught attention   BIG MISTAKE!  steak toughest piece meat ever had!  mine medium rare! ELLIS ISLAND steak special $8 99  All locals whenever we're town! <EOR> Went when town  Everything old frozen just fresh told good food wasnt  Waitress rude no sense customer service pretty much abandoned worst service wasnt even busy  <EOR> Note self $11 99 steak inedible lobster small but edible  baby backs good tho waitress  <EOR> Do waste your time!

Ordered steak medium well   overcooked DRY!!!  vegetable medley came meal some frozen vegetables wouldn't feed 3 year old grandchild    If could rate place 0 star would!  need totally revamp place possibly rid it   total waste space! <EOR> This Tony Roma's located inside Vegas casino nothing any other Tony Roma's restaurants to   All other Tony Roma's exude certain level classiness few regular items menu always look forward ordering   I feel all Tony Roma's chains should live usual standards but falls far below  Where start?  Firstly reason decided eat first place because all signs outside luring picture juicy prime rib accompanied big baked potato veggies says Only $8 99! walk through rowdy smoke filled casino restaurant greeted nobody  Rather walk angry lady standing podium let know would seated    She asks your name without looking writes down she rudely says 30 40 minute wait  No prime rib tonight  kidding me? place packed? don't offer meal widely advertise service already crappy before even getting seated!  I very tempted leave eat elsewhere but bae hungry didn't feel going hunt another restaurant      We stood until seat cleared could sit down wait  waited hear lady podium scream names tables opened up  Why can't invest microphone speaker?  Once seated decided put experience thus far behind order some yummy Tony Roma's food   I really look forward warm bread savory garlic butter served every Tony Roma's before your food comes    What surprise carry garlic butter  don't even serve bread unless request it  did but never came   At least entrée good  shared Roma Rack ribs baked potato soup fudge cookie ice cream dessert    During dinner privilege witnessing woman choke meat man perform Heimlich Maneuver 10 feet table  Thank God worked she okay   My boyfriend drank soda meal glass water lemon  tasted most disgusting grade tap water ever drank  hope also invest Britta filter something   Very classy joint huh? place almost no right going under name Tony Roma's unless adjust standards accordingly    I never mistake coming particular Tony Roma's ever again  <EOR> Had burger recently actually very good perfectly cooked seasoned   see location gets lot bad reviews  cheap cut tough steaks   Buy better grade steaks! rude wait staff   Train them new ones  cooks over cooking steaks wasteful when they're sent back   Train cooks hire new ones   buy better beef   Can't work miracles cheap product   Steaks should restaurant quality choice grade   Believe takes full year cook master grilling steaks correctly  steak lobster special   DISCONTINUE!  Epic Failure!  If want continue hearing complaints then keep menu   Doesn't even matter if charge 5 99 still good   I've owned two restaurants   You'll never please everyone but issues fixed   Just gotta fix it!  Great hamburgers!  If want repeat customers things change   Just consider those customers don't know Yelp?  Otherwise there'd many more complaints  <EOR> Found ourselves Freemont St  late night hadn't dinner yet werent expecting great steak lobster $11 99 but surprised delicious was   Steak tender lobster really good   must stop if there!! <EOR> I've several other Tony Roma's all pretty great but THEE worst restaurant ever to!!
