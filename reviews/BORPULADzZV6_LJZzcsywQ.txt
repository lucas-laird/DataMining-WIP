Outdoor seating best right next Miracle Mile Shops entrance  Great idea live music but unfortunately particular band much karaoke lead singer great   He solicited song crowd few customers screamed Prince he said Prince above pay level     then proceed play Sweet Child Mine but Guns n' Roses    yet karaoke classic but did no justice  food disgusting service horrible  definitely place sit drink sing karaoke favorites mediocre band  Maybe if drank music would sounded better food would tasted better service wouldn't mattered  <EOR> Was really excited birthday some karaoke Wednesday five other friends  wasn't hardly anyone waited 15 mins table never acknowledged   left  <EOR> I should've remembered known better  husband stopped late night 10 30  starving 1 30 am all other stuff panda twin peaks etc right closed  seated served right away  mini corn dogs spinach dip  salad he Mac n cheese  hit spot but 5 6am stomach blown most uncomfortable gas digestion catch flight home  forgot 2013 girlfriends early dinner apps drinks during girls weekend  5 6pm literally right eating uncomfortable eating lie down 3 hours  eat back ready out  don't know using cook put food but does agree stomach! never back there  stick pizza hot dogs etc ever back again! <EOR> What fantastic experience!

Ridiculous   We sauntered down bar a mere 5 feet away placed order  When server Alisha H  handed receipt asked change she said don't give change she assumed dollar I'd mistakenly overpaid tip   I'm sure kind policies PBR Rock Bar implemented when staff stealing your money tips  direct reason one star rating   I've also e mailed GM received no response yet 24 hours  Honestly treatment received expecting response   Wings ok  Overpriced but ok   Will definitely going elsewhere when return Vegas  <EOR> Would never return   Not vegetarian friendly food disgusting  Fianc sent back kitchen never replacement  Slow service disgusting food bad environment high cost  <EOR> We visited last night few restaurant bar opened till 2 am Sunday night end if strip PH mall casino  waitress sweet she communicated well let know when last call drinks food was greatly appreciated since starving 1 am  Beer food selections great prices average strip restaurant bar prices   atmosphere fun still ambiance exciting even Sunday  Great decor clean!

We then talked another hostess would barely look face  She said she could take back corner bar barely any TVs otherwise would 20 30 minutes  all while she rolling eyes interrupting considering side story  Pretty sure reserved table just going group friends wanted last minute    Needless say left but blown away  Obviously restaurant doing well if support turning away paying customers this  More power them  <EOR> Honestly scared when read reviews sitting down but didn't any experiences   Place packed service acceptable burger awesome     Would return  <EOR> I've twice ordered same thing chicken waffles magnificent breakfast burrito both superb! only hate ordered daughter orange juice even tho charged regular price lady gave half cup when asked fill she gave attitude said  supposed then maybe should served smaller cup! !
