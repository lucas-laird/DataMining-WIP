Good job kabob dudes! <EOR> I usually don't find myself walking around end downtown  wandering hobos around seem more disgruntled usual encounters other parts town  But review downtown hobos  some gyro talk   Kabob Korner small yet comfy little spot  menu many more American items expected wings chicken fingers burgers etc    guess general public food more business  something little between common traditional  around $8 myself chicken gyro combo which came gyro fries drink    Gyro only ok  made decent lunch but nothing memorable   even bite super gyro lamb whom eating which far tastier mine  Still wasn't tasty enough way here  actually enjoyed seasoned fries more gyro   Will come back? Probably not  Though more traditional items looked good didn't seem enough win appeal  looks only reason shuffle through hobos part town coffeehouse across street  <EOR> Great food!!  best fresh pita ever rest meal chicken gyros hummus kulfi dessert really good too   basically little hole wall joint but enough decorations stuff feel rather homey   staff friendly enough but then am single white woman might made difference per other reviews   would recommend spot good quick bite when downtown!
