I am surprised much hate place   I am usually destroy place bad meal however experience Sushi Loca far worst dining experiences Vegas    The food would give three stars  Definitely terrible  would come back if weren't staff   If owner I'd probably fire staff hire new crew ASAP    Overall staff customer service skills very poor  disappointing new spot game especially when fairly slow restaurant  greeted any staff walk in  able wander around entire restaurant without being asked if would seated  If reading review while sitting Sushi Loca stand just walk out  sure servers won't even notice    I enjoyed most items ordered except jalapeo poppers which terrible  order this  tried send back  where bad service became somewhat offensive  Instead asking wrong dish she told dish exactly menu describes if did problem since ordered it  WTF?    ok     My friend pretty much speechless point just asked if she could clear dish bring check   She returns check attempts ammends explaining if she took off replaced every item guest did enjoy restaurant would lose much money  understand however obvious customer satisfaction concern  Eventually she ends awkward conversation Just once let order something else same price dish but never again OK!? First all  Thank you? But never back don't worry it    They also charge 50cents all sauces  wouldn't usually mention something review because 50 cents doesn't really matter however asked ponzu she brought wrong sauce first but decided charge both    My bill came $100 two people  no way I'd ever return place  just many great restaurants choose waste your time here  <EOR> Nothing really stands      only thing worth mentioning yellow tail collar  also lunch special some rolls    price I'd rather drive little farther Sen Japan  <EOR> Poor service feel inconvenience  Far loud    trying eat dinner night club names rolls totally inappropriate kids  many great other options town  Won't back  <EOR> Love food    its always good   this time service worst ever     never food    when finally notice didn't food all other people seated eating begin worry   NOT HAPPY     a little light offer appetizer but better yet ask did order     really     wrote down handed you     but then tells computer did print check cooks    Really     after all done    I say again food wonderful     no one's perfect everyone mistakes yes back love place# # # # # # # # # # # # <EOR> Food still good but service gone WAY DOWN since last review  cannot give 5 stars anymore restaurant    not sure going here   last several times dined service AWFUL! Hopefully fix soon <EOR> Sushi fantastic!

Everything flavorful delicious! owner really sweet checked us  Oh God favorite! <EOR> I eat much sushi means eat many places  means know should cost  Unless won lottery should probably skip Sushi Loca  menu similar Sushi Fever prices higher Strip    So here's ate Toro pieces good sized but $17 95 piece highway robbery! Negihama roll double rice needed  Kiss Fire roll swimming much spicy vinegar sauce made roll fall apart flavor just sauce  Spider roll lots crab salad inside fried softshell crab warm crunchy  Alaska roll Tiger roll just expected    Bottom line average sushi crazy prices  Service trying hard but prices water glasses should sit empty  <EOR> Always friendly 6 times always sushi bar service good  Fish very fresh aim please  usually regular sashimi pieces very large tell fish very fresh  <EOR> Let start off saying love Centennial location but par  drink order didn't see waited least 10 min  When food came Jackpot roll good Tiger roll very bland dry add spicy mayo taste better creamy scallop roll totally raw gummy sent back  When asked send roll back   being specific being raw ask waiter another server manager fully explain why wanted send back  Because gross   why  Next time just care customer fresher tasting food next time  <EOR> This place WORST service! dinner sat 15 mins order taken  Never came around ask doing No refills drinks wanted order more but no came ask if wanted anything else ordered food NEVER came then charged it!!!!! Ask Manager when paying Manager didn't even apologize just happened  left NO tip which usually don't but BAD!!!!!! <EOR> I'd give zero if option  First time few months ago while visiting family Summerlin service terrible moment walked in  Although seated right away must've waited 15 minutes just order drinks  server kept forgetting never brought refills asked 2 times  food took longer any other place arrive even forgot bring neices's kids meal brought right before left only because remind them twice bring time arrived rest already finished eating  You're probably thinking crowded night but wasn't all  believe only 3 tables being served no idea why took long possibly forget family four  would definitely never back nor would recommend anyone  <EOR> New place Summerlin Center really enjoyed  3 specialty rolls did your girlfriend no pain no gain heart attack   wow all three  Really unique flavorful  No pain no gain fav  return  <EOR> Love place  sushi amazing  Great quality delicious rolls  service great too  If looking great quality sushi place  <EOR> I've twice already always bad baaad service! food mediocre best  took break regular Yama Sushi binge decided give sushi loca another try shopping around downtown summerlin   What big mistake! seated promptly but service tad bit slow  only 2 other tables took atleast 10mins drink orders then another 10 food orders  work service industry understand people busy but 2 tables! adequately staffed  kind service that?
