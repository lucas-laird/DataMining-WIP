Perhaps air conditioner stolen sign see photo should indicator something  buffet preview revealed semi decent selection but food greasy old cold greasy disgusting oh did mention GREASY?   I picked several clean plates food debris all over them  food wasn't labeled correctly just looked sad   Speaking sad learned valuable lesson before deciding eat establishment ALWAYS check expressions patrons  Everyone dining looked depressed say least  felt same way dining there  should handing Prozac fortune cookies   My dining partner paid meal shortly thereafter bathroom across street   goodness!
