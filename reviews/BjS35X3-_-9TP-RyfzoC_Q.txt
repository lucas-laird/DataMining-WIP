Then she walked away  busboy busgirl helping knew wasn't all true   Me two friends laughed ourselves when she walked away said hoped she wasn't server  She was! While waiting sat looked menus  keep large unkempt pile them grab off unoccupied hostess stand  menus basically printed paper kept clipboard fine guess but shouldn't many pages long   We finally sat table seat huge rip it  Repaired red duct tape match red seat  repair job approximately 12 x6   newer restaurant surprised  anyways Jackie comes over take orders  She asked each wanted without ever writing down  Then asked each second time wanted while writing down! Why first time? Anyways she away  She comes back 5 minutes later says she written order menu pad paper didn't know happened order  she take down again  So she off order  wait  wait  wait  way waiting area completely full but many many cleaned tables noone using  obviously needed more servers maybe some sick  don't know but Jackie seemed covering everywhere  We food 35 minutes being seated  remember only 10 11 tables seated half them already food  Two three orders wrong  pancakes just so  Also pancakes powdered sugar them which assume additional mistake since ordered regular pancakes  eggs undercooked  wrong potatoes other plates wrong syrup I asked sugar free received regular   eggs eggs benedict overcooked no runny yolk all   All all bad experience  Maybe good place but Sunday 12 30pm 5 15 16 horrible experience  <EOR> This place list any its charm since moving Lake Mead location  Its still just charming! quality food hasn't suffered either  Still great food great price  <EOR> We used restaurant back Water Street now drive going here  But always awesome food service! place charming cozy diner vibe  close airport suggest if coming home trip simply visiting recommend try place  just hope open another branch closer us  <EOR> Found place Yelp LOVE it  wife enjoy variety quality food  chicken waffles brisket sandwich fish chips pulled pork  All dishes awesome  Definitely fresh home cooked flavor  Favorite thing menu mac cheese  usually pretty quiet comfortable  <EOR> This place great if you're looking small town type dining experience  When walked completely forgot Las Vegas  chicken waffles very good! best but tasted homemade  Overall very cute family diner great alternative places Cracker Barrel  <EOR> Good place breakfast fair prices  <EOR> Been few times husband both agree food good ambiance nice enjoy nice breakfast place  But factor drove both crazy excessive amount time someone came around table asking if wanted more coffee  worse service no coming around all but felt 3 people around clock rotating asking if wanted more coffee  bit much  Maybe person take task?

Walking place much bigger expected super cozy fresh vibe all decorations large windows  All employees also really nice friendly  Our waters took pretty long basically came when food came around 20 25 minutes but server apologized friendly attitude no problem!   Chicken Fried Steak $9 50 Anytime try new place Chicken Fried Steak menu  usually lol pretty solid  Came Sourdough toast my choice potatoes scrambled eggs  Potatoes could use more flavor eggs perfect sauce bomb actual fried steak seasoned good but breading didn't stick sliding right off! Wah! No biggie though would still order again  still Rise Shine Hard Rock's Mr  Lucky's 24 7 cafe leading contenders Chicken Fried Steak lol   Southwestern Brisket Sandwich $9 50 boyfriend course tasted lol pretty good well  side normal comes believe french fries potato salad but boyfriend little weird requested hashbrowns instead lol server asked if he wanted them extra crispy he said sure  came kind weird lol pretty dry but tasted straight potato chips lol he'll probably settle regular hashbrowns next time  Brisket tender soft flavorful good amount sauce wasn't dry all   One thing stood most time diner esque places use bad oil taste pretty heavily food  However food place wasn't even really oily no oil taste all! Bonus points lol  Overall exactly fan yet but everything yummy location super close ambiance really neat definitely back mostly breakfast  Oh maybe burgers tables near several burgers all looked pretty good <EOR> This place amazing!!

Cute place too! <EOR> Again love restaurant !! Food delicious reasonably priced Great service J R     Friday clam chowder amazing  Took them awhile going but if tried before little unsure another trip well worth it   Very disappointed !! Loved restaurant family used every other Friday but last two months open Friday 5 00 pm   understand if your getting enough business stay open dinner but upsets most actually called morning told yes would open dinner  even passed way home work 4 15 pm cars front yet 30 minutes later picked other four family members drove closed  just lost customers  trying dinner again   <EOR> 5 1 2018  Stopped breakfast early lunch   place clean cheerful homey   seated immediately given menus drink order taken   ordered breakfast Chicken Fried Steak 2 eggs gravy potatoes English muffins coffee $12    guest 1 biscuit gravy potatoes bacon coffee   orders came reasonable time server made sure coffee drinks refilled when needed   guest enjoyed meal while felt gravy could little more flavor Steak while cooked properly looked if little freezer burn edge   All dishes coming kitchen looked appetizing customers seemed happy   restaurant some oldies playing good atmosphere place even busier ate   would recommend giving place try  <EOR> Okay   our experience stopping into establishment tops cake truly stupid weird experience category  Came group three greeted nicely first seated right away  hostess hands clipboards least 10 sheets each copy paper walks away while figure just happened  We're all removing pages old nasty wooden clipboards find menu strewn slop shop all over pages  over dramatize further couldn't even see tops pages until removed them being blocked clips boards  utterly f'n annoying! What's worse menu pages completely order breakfast lunch dinner other misc pages all thrown together mixed cluster  Then hostess comes back see's somewhat perturbed into lazy explanation why menus look way  btw just wanted eat lectured! She states she owner husband come Vegas Midwest failed real menu's because waiting see if business succeeded into second location  She further indicated new location coming soon only then would menu debacle under control  point good explanation didn't even ask for  fact only reason came first visit possibly eat some good food  time around 1 30pm Saturday afternoon then greeted waiter proceeded order  All wanted order dinner's since really looking forward specialties then told serving any dinners  WTF?? menu states dinner's served starting 10am daily exception baked potatoes which only available 4pm  things even more bizarre restaurant closes 3pm daily  does anyone order dinner's if can't ordered all  guess baked potatoes aren't ever available either since only available 4pm once restaurant closed already 3pm? Seriously folks   maybe away bs Midwest but Las Vegas! Home customers want anything everything whenever wherever visit flip side being simply leave your establishment never back just if cannot even simply order offer your menu! There's always restaurant's replacement right around corner bs always send other's right your doors  Think your wallet's won't harmed such? Think again since those care way grace your establishment fact spend most $$$  Cash customers' wallets stays customers' wallets when your practices discombobulated! top all off all felt hostess owner bit attitude which obviously purpose when she heard menu frustration us  Ohhh poo poo   did hurt your little feelings expressing dismay front center over your shortcomings? Tough s**t your act together real Las Vegas restaurant otherwise back Midwest boil some potatoes back  Sorry rude but your actions upon hungry customers even being able order any food due STUPID BUSINESS PRACTICES gets good ol' sour yelp reviews  TIP 1 Don't give people menu's dinner's available when no dinner's available  TIP 2 some REAL menus! TIP 3 Treat every customer if future your businesses success because ARE! TIP 4 Don't ever let customers' leave your restaurant without being able order food letting customers leave hungry miffed always cost $$$ future business  <EOR> Called hour ahead time see if served breakfast all day yes said  Sweet drove 8 miles check place closed  Yup closed  called back see what's said just decided randomly close day? WTF? just galkex u phone hour ago?? Thanks wasting time hometown eats U SUCK! <EOR> Nice little kitschy joint off Tropicana Pecos   I'd hate dust all trinkets adorn place! Food good though staff quite friendly  Very home style menu meatloaf salisbury steak fried chicken   you idea  french dip sandwich which good little different more pot roast type pulled beef rather thin sliced steak might used to  Still good but different  Home made horseradish wasn't hot I'd prefer though  Would definitely come again few more things menu I'd try  <EOR> I great experience here  Staff friendly made sure everything needed  Food great ! around 4 surprisingly just more family nice quiet hearing great oldies <EOR> Frendly staff  servers kind worked together  Portions generous food pretty good  Chicken fried steak little chewy    but kinda think common dish  All sides made it  Great mashed potatoes mixed vegetables divine  side salad really fresh yummy  Pizza huge! breakfast dishes look good    saw someone window booth French Toast convinced in! million percent better Dennys!
