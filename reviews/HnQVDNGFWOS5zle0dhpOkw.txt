All could say ok thanks hangup KNOWING if stupid think then definitely place would want eat ever again  STILL FEELING SICK THANKS!!! <EOR> Okay made review place back when first opened since then really gotten shit together    I last night 3 item plate  plain carne asada taco chile relleno enchilada  Everything excellent except enchilada  3 small taco tortillas wrapped long but didn't enough meat it  Does sense? enough meat tortilla ratio   Anyways taco perfect! easily compare one's you'd find east side  meat very flavorful  chile relleno good sauce great flavor   My dislikes simple peeves enough take any stars away   1  right before closed ran lemon 3 tiny pieces but feel  fault going late   2  red sauce still doesn't me  prefer home made salsa's tastes spicy pace That's it! Everything else much flavor especially rice! sad took nearly 2 years back but glad did glad they've improved  <EOR> Went night evening debauchery  friend curious place  way rate Mexican food places based Carne Asada fries  Man disappointed  meat chopped into small thin bits which good very lean flavorful  But if want better  little less guacamole overpowered whole dish  Employees very nice too  defiantly recommend place  <EOR> Put place your cheap eats list people! Portion Price ratio awesome!  We came lunch because advertisement coupon $5 off $10+ bill we aren't cheap frugal! We 4 soft tacos 2carne asana 1 carnitas 1 chicken Taquitos Carne asada fries The bill came little over $12 00 coupon!    The carne asada really dry kibble ish both dishes  carne asada fries chocked loaded cheese pico  used battered type french fry which kinda threw off normal french fries which prefer The carnitas shredded chicken tacos great! Both moist full flavor  stars lunch!  I'd dare give place 4 stars but take star away because salsa bar  horrendous dire need attention  salsa levels all low plastic cups lids every bin  Thank goodness didn't need any salsa since carne asada fries tacos loaded pico    For price taste portion size  good alternative those taco chain guys down road  <EOR> Just tried first time definitely back   chicken burrito smothered very good   Real good flavor good salsa salsa bar   Prices average  <EOR>
