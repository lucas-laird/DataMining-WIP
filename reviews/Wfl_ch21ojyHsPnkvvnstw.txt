So placed order over phone told there's $3 delivery charge  pay $10! cuz it'd cost $20 round trip if cab over  Then asked delivery address    we're Monte Carlo room     Wait you're guest hotel? can't deliver guests only workers per hotel policy UGH want sandwich!! Fine we'll come pick up  wanted write 1 star yelp review but hungry concentrate   When guy helping apologetic gave free sandwich top order  1 star review originally drafted thing past  Yes Asian free stuff = more stars yelp  But yes sandwiches freaking delicious never deserved 1 star anyway  just hungry cranky  <EOR> OK first visit ANY Capriotti's expecting good things  order Capastrami which 9 pastrami sandwich served roll Russian dressing cole slaw  ask cole slaw served side instead sandwich which did  took them little more 5 minutes prepare it  Now eaten enough pastrami life know good pastrami salt cured bold spicy smoke infused flavor  Capriotti's pastrami tasted almost totally bland  Even saltiness somehow leached it  sandwich roll obviously microwaved which results toughening its natural soft baked texture  cole slaw mediocre particularly flavorful   What HUGE disappointment! Overall turned 2 worst pastrami sandwiches ever served  know Capriotti's now become another big multi state franchise chain  don't know managed achieve status serving such wretched sandwich  <EOR> FYI tourists good sandwich but atmosphere   I onto yelp look good diner deli place Vegas while visiting few days   saw Cantors deli LA Carnegie deli NYC clones   eaten originals both loved it  Then saw Capriotti's really high ratings low prices   haven't Capriotti's thought I'd try it  expecting Cantors Carnegie sort place   As soon off plane checked into hotel I dragged coworker never Vegas   took $12 cab ride for 3 5 Vegas blocks just expected sit down diner type place   Our taxi driver couldn't even find because small store front strip mall   walk just counter order couple tables     I actually quite pleased turkey stuffing cranberry sandwich  Real trukey   Actual cranberries   mmmm   My coworker happy due lack atmosphere no drink choices only water OJ fact really only 1 vegetarian sandwich no salads which she craving   The other patrons seemed all UNLV frat boys talking drinking   people outside smoking which drifted in    ick   So really good sandwich see why locals love it   though sure quite worth taxi ride certainly good introduction someone's first time Vegas wooed glamorous dining options available  <EOR> Great sandwiches awesome service great price  Open 24 7 close strip  back!

Blows away spending $40 wicked expensive burger hotel know overpriced tastes $1 burger  <EOR> The veggie turkey meat good  best had  Yay having good vegetarian options! <EOR> Today tried Capriottis first time based other Yelp reviews   medium size Bobbie 12 in which large enough split into two meals   disappointed first bite sandwich cold bread cold soft   Tasted just unheated leftover Thanksgiving food   disappointing bite placed sandwich toaster oven 10 min   sandwich tasted much better being heated bread warm slightly crispy   where 4 stars come in   If didn't heat bread would probably give 3 stars based taste came shop   3 5 stars?  UPDATE back several times tried Capistrami Cheese steak sandwiches   absolutely love both BUT only first putting them toaster oven 5 minutes bread lightly crispy warm   They're really delish fresh oven but  prepared when them restaurant where bread soft cold   Upgrading 5 stars   would knock off half point if mainly heating bread  <EOR> This location open 24 7 which great when late night munchies  first time Capriotti's very good Cheesesteak except hardly any cheese! Pastrami excellent!! <EOR> I don't agree if BEST sandwiches around but certainly biggest thistly most filling   Great customer service   Wouldn't hesitate come back  <EOR> CapriCrap is    Vegetarians avoid place options little nasty   veggie Cole turkey worst sandwiches life Cole portion give should called portion whole thing couple spoons     The what's supposed turkey lookalike tasted horrible looked even worst   Two bites whole thing into trash   Not recommend all <EOR> Heard lot hooplah place decided check out  Ordered cheesesteak capistrami  cheesesteak just ok me  Good amount meat cheese capristrami excellent  slaw matched well perfectly seasoned pastrami  worth visit  Next time ill try Bobbie  <EOR> Eating bobbie sandwich Thanksgiving inside sub!

Ham delicious! Open 24 hours def good late night snack! Ham capricola along w grilled onions compliment each other really well  Philly cheese steak also very delicious  must if your craving something delish late night! <EOR> If application online look menu actually place your order   time given application food ready spot on   arrived early but working sandwich when everyone place really nice   best person though guy making sandwich   Even though all really nice guy making sandwich seemed only focused visit   heard ask several times replenishment items station but everyone seemed busy chatting each other could tell he getting frustrated because he getting any support fellow employees   Things happen workplace people right fun enjoy job however when customers store should level professionalism exhibited which customers observe person working everyone else playing supporting him   kind embarrassing he did apologize several times happening place   This place return food always consistent quality quantity  <EOR> I've eaten few different times every time no always Capistrami  always pleased service way food comes out  Place nice extra stars because they're open 24 7!! Perfect because sometimes pretty late really hungry  Definitely must visit! <EOR> Speaking sandwiches best sandwiches ever Capriotti's last year Vegas   interesting establishment originated Delaware but now Nevada far most locations   Not sure if but guessing other locations comparable   kind way away strip   took cab didn't realize no ride back   ended walking under tremendous heat afterward but eventually found taxi walking several blocks   Oh well try because good things said place   So decided share those super long subs   Capastrami because pastrami best meat sandwich imo    And    wow   amazing   pastrami coleslaw russian dressing some sort made sandwich unique darn tasty   just pure bliss   I back but alas isn't Capriotti's remotely closeby   Anyone road trip Vegas?
