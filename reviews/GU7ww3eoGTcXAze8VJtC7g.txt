prompt attentive   lemongrass lemonade nice tart refreshing   Mongolian Beef super tender spice just right   Singapore noodles excellent fresh prawns well seasoned   Overall pricey but really good meal  <EOR> ***Fin an upscale Chinese restaurant Mirage lot other Las Vegas fine dining restaurants  overpriced mediocre food***  Most Las Vegas The Strip restaurants overpriced   if planning eat nice restaurant Vegas probably going your money's worth   Still quality varies quite bit   Mesa Grill Carnevino both overpriced but least food good at least visits    other Vegas restaurants where spend lot food bad or mostly bad    Fin those restaurants   Fin sits Mirage contemporary decor nice though does really stand out   restaurant very close casino but still pretty quiet   Fin Chinese restaurant but probably more Americanized interpretation based    doing $40 3 course special   good variety starters choose while much selection among entrees desserts   all opted 3 course   added some la carte dishes share well   I started barbecued spare ribs   sweet but overly sweet   ribs could used something else give them little more kick   meat did fall off the bone texture   meat exactly tough but could more tender   I did try shrimp scallop wraps but looked bland   tried crispy shrimp toast served sweet sour sauce   starter decent   For entree opted Chilean Sea Bass served over sweet garlic sauce   sea bass came side steamed white rice   sea bass fried the menu said wok fried but seemed more deep fried    sea bass quite greasy   also incredibly fishy which little odd because sea bass typically does stronger fish tastes   could because fresh simply fish flavor became more pronounced fried it   I really did fish   greasiness taste made feel little queasy eat pretty much anything   From la carte menu General Tsao's Chicken which served broccoli   dish pretty good   chicken juicy tasty while sauce both sweet some good heat   We also Shrimp Lo Mein noodles which okay   noodles fine seasoned properly   shrimp plump however cooked long enough   For dessert opted assorted sorbet which 3 flavors   lychee blood orange   cannot remember other flavor   Only blood orange good flavor   other two flavors bland   The sorbet all ice   eating really frozen slushie   The other dessert option vanilla creme brulee much better   vanilla custard smooth creamy good vanilla flavor   nice caramelized shell   creme brulee garnished fresh berries   They finished off complimentary Baileys shot which good fortune cookie   fortune cookie pretty good   little thicker more buttery most fortune cookies had   messages seemed homemade especially since paper appeared cut scissors   Service good   heard strong customer service high priority Chinese restaurants more emphasis placed flavors value    Maybe place trying emulate even though seemed Americanized Chinese restaurant   waiter seemed confused he left table when ordering check another table   Other servers seemed little bit abrupt   Still once put order food did come good organized pace   Of nice Las Vegas restaurants tried Fin may worst one   General Tsao's Chicken creme brulee both good   other dishes though think would able just good food if better food P F  Chang's nearby and much lower price    many Vegas restaurants avoid Fin would definitely among them   The Mirage complimentary parking both valet parking structure   <EOR> They should just add E end name would know food like   food okay but nothing special   lettuce wrap egg drop soup   filling wrap basic complex all   friend Kung Pao chicken highly impressed however   waiter treated if any random drunk people restaurant pretty condescending since absolutely demographic drank  <EOR> Really amazing Chinese food  come every time am vegas  very authentic fresh  favorite must restaurant shark fin soup  <EOR> Had hankering Chinese food last day vegas  decided try place Mirage where staying  Wanted some warm soup vegetable fried

low quality  only flavor dish large undercooked pieces ginger didn't belong dish all  tomatoes tasted straight can  service absolutely awful  waiter never checked refilled water  literally look

place great ambiance quick friendly service    The only reason gave 4 star review menu prices seem little extreme type food  However typically range find any large resort Las Vegas Strip   Fortunately purchased fixe prix meal via travelzoo  $59 received 4 course meal two wine more reasonable  highly recommend purchasing something if all available   My husband each shrimp pork wonton soup  very good warm just right sized portion   As appetizer husband lettuce wraps  filling very flavorful lettuce slices cut into perfect size could enjoyed without mess  pan seared pork pot sticker which also incredible  choice leave satisfied   For dinner each enjoyed Mongolian Beef which perfectly seasoned served bed white steamed rice  Other choices available Chilean Sea Bass Kung Pao Chicken few others   Dessert Vanilla Brulee perfectly cooked nice crunchy caramalization topped some fresh berries   At end meal each guest presented Vegas themed fortune cookie small Bailey Liqueur palate cleanser   All all great dinner beautiful décor  <EOR> We way show Mirage came early dinner Saturday night   We able sit right away without reservation   Probably because early 6pm     We haven't eaten Chinese food forever   hesitant because usually over salted healthy   pleasantly surprised    The food light fresh flavorful   definitely find something healthy if ask    The hubs inhaled spicy beef    Service authentic polite  <EOR> For past two years wife eating Fin whenever visit Las Vegas   place freshest Asian cuisine reasonable price     To start recommend vegetable egg rolls which really crisp flavorful   Additionally typically also bowl hot sour soup soup great   entrees order Kung Pao chicken Mongolian beef   Each loaded flavor select level heat want cooked into your spicy disk
