When you're excited eating left overs    you know place million! <EOR> Food typical Italian American  Three party ordered Alla Nora  orders didn't any eggplant which key ingredient huge disappointment  ordered Puttanesca which tasty but wasn't able eat much due saltiness  If salty food then would recommend dish    The kitchen extremely slow weeknight visited  busy night empty tables  took more hour one hour 15 minutes exact receive order which fairly straightforward  No sides no appetizers just five main courses  could see other diners expressing frustration same delays food  Wine helped   The wait staff excellent beyond compare  Everyone friendly courteous apologetic tried best entertain while waited waited waited food   We patronize locally owned restaurants but disappointed experience  hope just off night restaurant typical  <EOR> Loved it! Best Italian town longest time  Very romantic atmosphere lovely music service superb! ordered angel hair meatball simple sauce good  meatballs tender flavorful  husband ordered frutti di mare absolutely delicious! Very impressed back date night soon  <EOR> This place overrated   disappointment!  sent some very high recommendations   just can't figure all fuss??  The garlic bread soggy sliced sub roll butter no real garlic flavor   fried calamari terrible!  Soggy greasy no crunch all pool grease bottom plate   chicken parm another disappointment   2 small chicken tenders little sauce little cheese little pasta pool water bottom plate   Italian restaurant serves pasta swimming water??  C'mon ain't right   It's overly expensive but portion quality still rip off!  Oh parking joke   suppose its because place crowded no idea why maybe its bar maybe fast food place    whatever reason good luck finding parking place   No reason give place second try  <EOR> We Nora's years ago before built opened Nora's  experience sat bar which prefer but plenty seating   Rudy bartender real bartender just someone draws beer mixes Gin Tonics  fresh herbs bar used cocktails  service along Michele awesome! Oh yes food outrageously great! Fairly priced place far strip  Monday night can't imagine busy Friday's Saturdays  Highly recommended  <EOR> We never disappointed always point order crazy Alfredo entrees  osso buco fab  Won't find better Italian food anywhere  little noisy little away strip but worth it  <EOR> If want Americans happy when dine serve big portions moderate prices   food doesn't great just decent lot it   If don't believe look runaway success Outback Steakhouse   Las Vegas locals no exception which why Nora's managed many glowing 5 star reviews   I started fried calamari better your average calamari but  saying much   batter nice crispy dipping sauce OK actually better without sauce thought portion plentiful price $10 95    also fettuccine carbonara requested extra al dente   came just somewhat al dente but quality pasta better most Italian restaurants   wasn't true carbonara just pasta lots and LOTS ham thrown top then drowned very generic cream sauce   much ham must've almost pound dish actually left quite bit bowl   But $13 95 your protein fix week   couldn't decide between two desserts just ordered both judge lest ye judged    salted chocolate panna cotta more dark chocolate pudding true panna cotta yes salty but saltiness works   also pistachio cannoli requested without chocolate chips but chocolate chips anyway   picking off chips really enjoyed dessert crisp shell good vanilla ricotta filling complemented ground pistachios   desserts notch above appetizer main also reason bumped rating star A OK   There far better Italian food Las Vegas Allegro Wynn good Sinatra Encore better Verandah Four Seasons outstanding but also lot pricier   spent half maybe even less Nora's compared similar meal Strip Italian restaurant   If want decent Italian great prices Nora's   If want great Italian elsewhere  <EOR> Brought son bro first time  usual best Italian food around!

I never written review before but really feel if considering trying dinner DON'T it  <EOR> If know you're going Nora's reservation least day before   otherwise you'll eating pretty late waiting long time  Otherwise bar first come first serve  actually prefer bar because service better more prompt  Besides drinks AMAZING! personal favorite Sicilian mule   Location place always busy if you're going relocate why restaurant larger accommodate more people instead having people leave due wait if call reservation any availability until late night of    Food All food tried good  fettucini carbonara crazy alfredo wild boar pappardelle great options pasta also liked Nduja pizza  also bring basket garlic bread start don't shy ask more  dessert cannoli good really enjoyed mascarpone ricotta filling     Service mentioned before service good bar but table hit miss  Sometimes server attentive but sometimes you'll see them come once blue moon  also come another time when orders properly made when spoke server manager issue neither handled situation well  classy establishment customer service should top notch  Remaking food must but dish should comped least provided some form discount since person group didn't end getting remade order until almost finished meal  <EOR> Unfortunately much better Italian food service other restaurants  friend town both craving Italian food last dinner here! stumbled Nora's Yelp decided give go  said better service but wasn't worst  say restaurant staff did keep refilling waters which awesome! pet peeves when servers top water refills  I drink lot water while eat    So onto food   hmm  Well garlic bread good  Hot crispy! first basket free which nice  Maybe just stingy but just tiny bit annoyed pay $2 50 more another basket bread  decided mozzarella sticks appetizer  hot tasted any other plate mozzarella sticks  Tasty but nothing special them    My main dish most disappointing stuck between trying Alfredo sauce pesto! asked waitress which she preferred she just suggested creamy pesto sauce little both! thought   oooh perfect! When came smelled amazing looked going great dish  took first bite okay  then took another little confused if liked not  kept eating all could taste pesto maybe tiny bit cream sauce  pesto sauce just did WOW taste buds so ever  honestly took most 10 bites over it  I hoping wonderful Italian dinner didn't find it  Instead trying another dish just try another restaurant  Sorry Nora's! <EOR> So family decided try place strip weekend saw reviews Nora's thought would give try   reservations 8 did seated unit 8 45   When sat down seemed only waiter half entire restaurant   Even though she very friendly seemed very understaff  Never once asked if needed refill another drink   complain food however very delicious   all all probably come back due fact $20 cab ride service great all  <EOR> I love place much took mom first time 10th  service five stars food great always choose Nora nice dinner honey even just nice place no reason all  <EOR> I hardly write bad review but think restaurant definitely deserve review 2 stars    Here's boyfriend experienced while we're here     Made 8 30pm reservations  Arrived 8 which early didn't mind waiting   checked in front let know we're there   table ready 8 15 but lady keep calling wrong name first all if take down name checked providing same name figure she right but NO!

Forget super fancy Italian restaurants strip charge much might well sell your blood afford your next meal  Nora's food tastes hundred times more expensive its price service topnotch friendly atmosphere great bar cozy nice occasional live music its small stage pleasing ears  waiting for?

Then dinner arrived even worse! tepid aesthetically unpleasing cold  actually awful   We then tried find grated cheese pasta but gave ten minutes asked check paid mostly un eaten disgraceful meal   Nora really gone Ritz pits  sad excuse restaurant    Please bring back good old days when Nora best Italian restaraunt around  Today pretty shell awful food worse service  actually Olive Garden look appealing  <EOR> 2 words    Osso Bucco  Best town!

Only eat if want really good good   BW <EOR> Wow! Stopped tonight dinner very impressed  looking neighborhood place certainly it  myself sat bar bartenders Angela her doppelgänger Lea Michele Rudy great  menu recommendations perfecto  Traveling yourself downer especially when staying LVH   nice off strip find place great food decent prices  certainly destination future trips Las Vegas  <EOR> I've couple times just want Italian restaurant  feel having dinner cooked mom  several pasta dishes really can't wrong  When Vegas try here  <EOR> We always loved Nora's but yet chance check new location decided celebrate Valentine's Day there  Made reservation online  only options 4pm 4 15pm 4 30pm picked 4 30pm  When 4 20pm only restaurant full reception area also full people  When finally made through crowd hostess told just need clear couple tables then it'll turn    After couple minutes into wait realized pretty much EVERYONE around MADE reservations  hate assume overbooked but guess I'd never find really going on  Because left empty stomach standing annoyed crowd hour  way husband did check them last time before left  answer same just need clear couple tables  Well three stars 1  hostesses kept sweet smile even knew everyone hating them  2  dedicated employee serve waiting crowd sparkling wine she always came back more  3  love Nora's based past experiences   So obviously happy really disappointed experience decided leave review only three stars  Hopefully owner management notice overall rating going south since moved into new location something it  Check other reviews if will    We definitely back month two   enough time them fix problems  Hopefully bring back Nora's always loved  <EOR> There nothing better trying new authentic italian restaurants  googled place other night never heard decided we'd try out  soon walked feeling fine classy sophisticated elegant italian place vibe get  mention its space adorable  Nice bar live italian music playing good amount well dressed people let know decent place  We didn't wait very long which nice  While did wait able watch cooks preparing authentic italian food  When sat down everything formal almost if  spot strip  Though room started remind little bit office building decor made ceilings decorated walls dressed if may your own grandmothers dining room  Cute   I enjoy when servers wearing vests because know quality want  But downfall server took long time first  complimentary italian garlic bread bit buttery own diet but fact wasn't just basket butter packets bread made place little different then others also fact fresh chopped garlic  well made much butter  When dishes food perfect just enough  dishes ordered 'Alla Nora' I'd recommend if robust meat sauce bolognese breaded eggplant fried  Comes spaghetti obviously  bad if signature dishes assuming  For lack perfect service girl made bringing complimentary dessert  because told first time there? way Tiramasu definitely type dessert but its thought counts  I'd recommend restaurant special birthday romantic quiet dinner  would definitely come back try something different menu since satisfied other menu items  I'd recommend place also another couple date because definitely more intimate places even if just glass wine listen live italian music  <EOR> Horrible service ruined much anticipated experience  Made reservation  Arrived 10 minutes early  able see tables needed cleaned however no staff around it  Waited over 20 minutes past reservation time seated due no clean tables  Waitress treated inconvenience however once only ordered water beverage could tell look face she knew wasnt going big ticket meal she annoyed  Waited another 15 minutes bread  When she finally brought she practically threw table while walking us  different person brought food  She only followed different person took plates bring check  Didnt even ask if wanted anything else dessert    I hoping manager would circulating room ask dining experience was  No such luck  witnesses short Asian guy grey suit running back forth front cooks but he NEVER approached guest    My impression would classy place however hostess wearing nothing short work clothes  would thought hostess would least dressed business casual put some real pants maybe pair slacks but guess poor standard Nora's   I am full time uber lyft driver  tourists asking daily basis good local restaurants  Once saw Nora's moved into new location thought would try out  brought Nephew visiting state try me  He waiter while finishing last year college  He even disappointed service    I eating again  definitely recommending any business Nora's  much competition Las Vegas waste time give them second try  Its shame opened beautiful location however forgot service industry  <EOR> The restaurant very authentic Italian  food phenomenal wait staff great  Jesseka Stephens waitress polite friendly  She laughing  special request chef honored without complaint  restaurant great romantic dinner well family  came Saturday night but seem very quickly  would highly recommend spinach cannoli  topped off bread pudding dessert  <EOR> This place recommended local did disappoint  Excellant ambiance food  Don't miss place! <EOR> Ate Nora's first time tonight  wife seated immediately around 5 45  each  dinner salad iced tea  dinner salad fantastic tea fresh delicious  each entrée  She ordered spaghetti meatballs linguine clam  Each entrée perfect  also ordered side green olives special oil really great  am hard please yet no complaints  restaurant run efficiently appeared clean spotless  All servers professional friendly  never asked refill offered more garlc bread often  wife  found new favorite Italian restaurant!  5 stars every category service atmosphere food quality authenticity  time left place full Monday night boot  <EOR> The food fair   Over baring garlic garlic   Six dinner 5 00pm   Three said food okay but great   other three did care food   old place few times food much better there   worst part pl missing ace noise level   Okay when arrived but 6 00pm could talk across table   VERY poor design no sound deterrence   Worst t he old place   But if very loud noise place enjoy   place packed might missing something   would see small salad food   would try again few months but no way wife go   Shrimp scampi worst dish group  <EOR> I finally found decent local Italian restaurant  complimentary garlic bread served beginning put great start   food good but nothing special it  grapefruit juice ordered expected did enjoy all   back another time try some more dishes <EOR> My wife love place  Great food drinks atmosphere service  returning wish better location  <EOR> I heard much restaurant really looking forward going there  However whole group fairly disappointed experience  prices reasonable but expected much more taste dishes  ordered gnocchi husband alla nora which supposed specialties  Both dishes just ok weren't anything special all  tomato sauce top gnocchi honestly reminded Chef Boyardee  house salad ordered also nothing special  only good part meal pesto sister ordered  service inconsistent  guy brought drinks bread very friendly nice  However waitress person dropped off entrees indifferent  woman served entrees basically just dropped plates table without word smile  restaurant super busy don't know if just table wasn't having great time but expecting much better place  <EOR> We love here  food excellent    HOWEVER even though made reservations wait endlessly table  thought new somewhat larger location would alleviate wait problem but guess just can't organized  may return because this   After waiting crowd people no reservations near door which continuously cold uncomfortable finally seated last evening   Still until saw manager bar other patrons happened notice sitting without water bread anyone acknowledging coming table waitress magically appeared   10 minutes   To top off long uncomfortable wait seated near large noisy birthday party few them actually toasting above husband's head   waiting see if they'd spill wine food him  Private Parties?  them take private room   So we'll give more shot because food  usual reservations   If continues can't alleviate uncomfortable long waits avoid coming despite liking exceptional food  <EOR> Best Italian food years   Reviews spot on! Veal Salmon delicious  another must stop pricing very reasonable    Thank experience <EOR> This favorite place when just need sit down while eat problems  really love service selection food  Some hostesses little crazy but hey okay  food location splendid! <EOR> Excellent Italian food baked ziti which house favorite wife veal specialties which awesome well  desert canoli shared tiramisu wife both deserts very delicious  Overall I'd again recommend anyone looking great homestyle Italian food  <EOR> Took parents anniversary birthday celebration Xmas eve   Arranged ahead time Chef's seafood menu offered wine pairing meal which opted for   Seafood meal incredible 5 course meal huge portions delicious  Was extremely special evening   cheap but great value nonetheless given outstanding food wine very attentive service  We'll back when next visit Sin City  <EOR> I came first time family  reading rave reviews  management changed recently? horrendous experience  server took orders brought food tables seated took eternity food  girlfriend ordered house salad calamari which she enjoyed  mom ordered spaghetti which way salty  server knew didn't food service she brought complimentary ice cream which nice but still won't come back here  plenty Italian restaurants Las Vegas offer great service food  <EOR> The right side Dining room greatly decorated bar well but left side building dining room looks third grader decorated it   HOWEVER put aside because food price great deal   When walk your senses come life some great Italian cooking   only lunch but having said would love try dinner menu   lunch specials very well priced quality food above average   staff friendly very attentive your needs   would definitely come back eat again   Reasonable prices good quality food  <EOR> This most best places many people know but let tell if want great Italian cuisine must try grew NJ grandfather chef am sure he would loved place outside doesn't look much parking limited because other businesses same strip don't let fool food awesome staff attentive friendly quite few times now yet find anything didn't like  Bottom line if don't give Nora's try missing great meal  <EOR> OMG!

Lunch prices mid range $12 depending your ordering  back soooon! <EOR> We food review can't speak dining experience  came across place those nights nobody feels cooking attempting two other Italian places listed open Yelp but turned closed found Nora's    Al Prosciutto Pizza 4 Stars  Think combination regular run mill pizza better ingredients  crust wasn't super thick super thin def  artesianal type but chain style rather just nice middle ground  very little basically no sauce cheese first layer  crust brushed nicely olive oil perhaps light dusting parmesan large slices sun dried tomatoes  arugula Prosciutto added baking but while pizza still hot giving greens nice bit wilt without being mushy then more parmesan sprinkled top  only down side pizza just much garlic actually garlic but just bit much  Deduct star that  wouldn't want eaten first date! If ordered again would just ask hold garlic  Other great pizza  plenty leftovers    Spinach Gorgonzola Farro Salad 4 Stars  farro nice tender topped generous portion fresh spinach  salad rimmed large slices fresh firm tomatoes topped crumbled gorgonzola  salad losses star due slightly much dressing taste  would ask dressing side next time but other really nice fresh simple salad    Rigatoni Special 4 Stars  wouldn't likely order dish again but because don't happen care most meats wasn't good  pasta cooked nice texture sauce good flavor  nice red sauce just enough oil spice give little kick  amount meat dish generous meatballs flavorful tender  Italian sausage slices you'd expect but if  flavor then you'd pleased  sautéed green peppers sliced very thick making could really taste flavor opposed little diced pieces might miss dish    Pasta Fagioli Soup 3 Stars  didn't care dish much  felt lacking bit taste maybe some salt something  generous amount beans pasta pasta wasn't mushy just chalk fact just wasn't quite thing bad per se    Bottom line place pretty good prices right  We'd definitely eat again check some other menu items  <EOR> Nora's hard place describe   thing say sure Nora's very very popular   recently moved strip mall location large stand alone building down street even larger space packed every night   Beyond don't know if Nora's set all things all people but very nearly succeeds reaching goal   Is Nora's local hangout family friendly reasonable prices?  Yes be   wife locals couple miles Nora's consider neighborhood joint   lasagna cannelloni 15 bucks leave full satisfied  One thing family friendly part usually families young kids dining room all them shall say well behaved kind noisy there  On other hand Nora's high end destination restaurant draws tourists Strip?  Yep too   if want Nora's $$$ restaurant certainly start shrimp scampi appetizer $17 then veal chop $40     My recommendation your favorite pasta dish   Most recently Crazy Alfredo which sort paella made fettuccine instead rice quite good   also enjoyed veal cannelloni la vodka fettuccine carbonara   All pasta dishes tried rich rich rich even Italian food definitely don't need multiple courses   But if choose starter would suggest stay away pasta faggioli dish didn't care for  <EOR> Great restaurant large party  group sixteen didn't miss beat  Great food atmosphere service  Fan life  <EOR> Lets remember 3 5=average 4 5=above average 5 5=amazing  I give place 4 5 came friday April 28 2017 Let break down     Overall experience 4 5 Reason being 7 15pm dinner reservation however did seated until 8pm waited another 20 minutes bread wine   appetizers didn't until almost 9pm   server Jessica   She amazing   problem wasn't lack policy restaurant doesn't regards large party payments   Being waitress prior understand party 10 w separate checks happen but poor thing two parties 10 separate checks witness she served different receipt books   needless say understood busy she but gosh friday night couldn't party arrange something else restaurant rule   Then funny thing Jessica finally other party interrupted middle taking order pulled back table   Jessica very kind apologetic but restaurant owners should really put stop large party separate checks friday saturday nights   Service 5 5 Jessica very friendly delightful would never known chaos unless witness it   She never complained never showed face   Food 4 5 5 In between above average amazing   Octopus favorite   love jasper grilled items great flavor   Atmosphere 4 5 It VERY loud inside if full   Waiting area very small crowded minimal sitting inside   decor new fresh which looks great   If heels floor slick!

Finally seated all fine  Nothing exciting took place between getting seated getting food except food seemed come rather slow pace which strange considering restaurant mostly empty hour   ordered Calamari Fritti Truffle Fries Shrimp Scampi Frutti di Mare Crazy Alfredo Rib Eye   1 Calamari Fritti actually really good  Perfectly crisped flavored  Good sauce fried calamari  Would definitely recommend this  HOWEVER when given bill charged $2 extra this  waitress told price when showed menu prices did match  fine if supposed $2 more however please update your menu reflect same  staff did seem pleased helping fix error fact made seem nuisance asking changed  When pricing errors much customer cares difference price but simply principle everyone accurately charged food getting   2 Truffle Fries Overly salty very much truffle flavor  overall okay but best had  Wouldn't really recommend  only reason because craving few days back happy see decent price restaurant  Wish would satisfied craving better   3 Shrimp Scampi didn't much but grandma uncle both ordered liked it  buttery taste salty enough which surprising considering salty fries    4 Frutti di Mare Also best had  Again sauce little bland considering dish usually very flavorful other places severely lacking night  sure could done better  Definitely some more salt would start   5 Crazy Alfredo dish sounded amazing paper some reviews seemed agree but did all  flavors didn't seem marry well together heavy which suppose should expected alfredo dish     6 Rib Eye definitely highlight entire meal  meat very well cooked flavorful  If back would would get  bit confusing because menu option fries another roasted potatoes  fries option $1 more roasted potatoes wanted especially since just ordered side fries was! Nonetheless came bowl fries  Now just experienced other restaurants but usually if party orders fries waitress asks if still want since entrees comes side fries  same size paid for  never brought though least accommodating enough bring side roasted potatoes instead which took another fifteen minutes least    Overall didn't really enjoy experience here  bill took felt eternity waitress just disappeared most meal flag down other waiters confused where she was  additioit seems online menu in restaurant prices match  am certain if supposed but doesn't seem reliable source  don't believe going back again sadly  <EOR> This Favorite Italian restaurant Las Vegas  Great food if able seat well worth wait  only issue ever getting seated  Even reservation wait  Clearly food great <EOR> I wish could star rate restaurants food service ambiance etc individual parts whole experience  ability would drastically affect review Nora's   The food tonight good  excellent but some high points gnocci w vodka sauce veal scallopinni   However other items lacked flavor case chicken parm fell apart all together    The hostess bar staff great  handled dinner crowd very well  drink while waiting table  Once ready promptly transferred dining room  where things down hill fast  server waiting wife party 16 3 4 other tables  noticed she busser Justin 2 other food runners helping party  All assistance should freed provide atleast bit competent service table those around us  hour twenty minutes dining room interacted waitress 4 times   1  Placed order 1st cocktails appetizers entrees  2  Delivered 1st cocktails ordered waters 3  Ordered 2nd cocktail because hadn't recieved food  4  Recieved check    Notice wasn't server delivered second drink FOOD!!! She didn't approach table until requested check through busser  When she did approach table she asked everything tasting  no plates table because finished dinner 10 minutes before   My wife no idea she doing whole time there  large party seemed cared mainly support staff such food runners busser   Unfortunately cannot rate individual parts establishment separately receive 2 stars based dismal performance server lackluster food   However Justin busboy 5 star employee  He never stopped moving  He turned tables absolute efficiency incredibly professional dealing customers  observed distributing  plates flatware large party  Everyone handed items individually excuse thank when he reach opposite side table  laughed when observed another employee simply walk place handful forks stack plates end table walk away just expecting head table pass them out  Fantastic job tonight Justin appreciated your effort  <EOR> Great food!

Both relatively polite individuals didn't any odd uncommon requests service     I ignored rudeness since enjoy dinner date   Naturally avoided any additional order asking any questions menu options   She made feel uncomfortable just didn't want near table     On second visit same person   waitress remembered appeared effort friendly initially   Unfortunately short lived   presence just negative   just sense negativity person whether dismissive facial gestures overall rude tone voice     Again no tolerance such people pay no mind   bothered more second visit crude remark   Apparently term used describe wanted order rubbed wrong way?  She made very rude remark made give quick look but smiled moved on   don't come engage such petty people come enjoy good food good company   Unfortunately same waitress chipped away attempt enjoy dinner date    On third visit Italian favorite many food good    time date insisted visiting place she never pleasure experiencing herself   took chance   Long behold SAME waitress third time   No difference   waitress provides such poor service walk over bartender order drink tipped well   He noticed poor service being offered Waitress   fact he even gave look if he acknowledged going on  <EOR> Omg great restaurant type know food going great! disappointed all wow service Sebastian authentic caring   mussels spiced perfect pasta great back <EOR> We coming Nora's years but last two service feeling when dining gone down hill   made reservations three weeks ahead still told would few minutes   30 minutes later standing sea backed guests now told people table decided dessert   does even mean?  then offered bar patio   Being anniversary acceptable   Nora's used fun place but seems gotten big themselves stopped caring customers   guess enough why bothered   need some kind actual system reservations works   New Year's also happened but worse because 5 tables reservations sat first looked forgot bar   food definitely worth aggravation other reviewers right if something writing just shrug don't care   Bye Nora's many restaurants Vegas worry mediocre mess business  <EOR> My family really enjoyed place  shrimp scampi which amazing  hubby really loved sauce used shrimp scampi  exact words sauce good want drink lol  he honestly someone compliments often  daughter cheese pizza which also really good  She's 7 also made compliment delicious was  linguini clams pretty tasty except hubby angel hair pasta arrabiata sauce took taste ended switching  He liked linguini clams better liked angel hair arrabiata better worked very well  just wanted try something different  husband cup coffee he said pretty good which also rare compliment restaurant coffee because he uses French press home he swears best coffee  ended meal tiramisu  admit tiramisu fan didn't way prepared  lady fingers very soggy which ruined entire flavor dessert  am still giving Nora's 5 stars though due fact everything else great  sure back whenever we're side town  <EOR> If eat where locals eat amazing meal come here!

Well    honest didnt read whole description dish  Crazy Alfredo best seller features classic fettucine Alfredo piled chicken sausage jumbo shrimp    Honestly  stopped reading here  should read on     porcini mushrooms domestic mushrooms roasted bell peppers sun dried tomatoes jalapenos   JALAPENOS? Yes  read right  Now dont wrong  love japapenos nachos mexican food    But Alfredo? honest much  picked them all really did look someone took huge handful tossed in  Maybe missing 'gourmet taste' whatever but definitely without it   The dessert selection didnt look exciting decided pass it  final bill came around $70 before tip  Overall just A OK meal  Maybe just ordered wrong dish  Would eat again? Sure  I'd give another shot  Next time I'd try pizza another large salad  <EOR> Cucina italiana great customer service! Food amazing! Bartender really nice!
