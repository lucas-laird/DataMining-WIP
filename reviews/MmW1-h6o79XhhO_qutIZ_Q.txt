One most apathetic lethargic Starbucks ever visited  don't know purveyor caffeine beverages such glacial service  two conferences back back always way  line less 15 people took thirty minutes through  <EOR> If you're drink product tell don't swap something hope don't notice  Ordered paid sugar free syrup coffee drink but when tasted scalding hot btw didn't taste normally any other Starbucks  Asked if maybe missed SF syrup employee proceed tell SF product just put pump regular sugar product  Astonished thought wouldn't notice okay swap?! ask plain coffee without getting refunded charge syrup too  Poor service poor communication poor judgement  <EOR> This Starbucks literally hit miss  Some days there's no wait some days packed w crowds people convention center  good bad days  Sometimes drink tastes horrible other days exactly right   need more things! Prices little ridiculous hotel employee still end paying $7 regular $4 coffee <EOR> I didn't particularly find staff all friendly  big line only person manning register while three other employees where talking background helping   Also all other Starbucks wouldn't 50 Cent refill coffee all other Starbucks  skip but more likely if you're staying Venetian you'll anyways  <EOR> This new Starbucks location Venetian Palazzo right Sands Convention Venetian ticket office comforting sight  space huge nicely decorated  staff friendly  Nice! <EOR> Honestly    they messed drink  3 shots espresso 3 pumps white mocha 2 pumps toffee nut ice venti cup     don't adding any extra!! didn't want  half half milk cream     whatever added in    just wanted 3 shots espresso 3 pumps white mocha 2 pumps toffee nut ice venti cup    <EOR> Waited line 30 mins   told don't refills here   What????  sign that?  Thanks Starbucks! <EOR> Nice clean area friendly staff great location favorite Starbucks! <EOR> Not bad location beautiful secluded corner noise non issue   The prices higher used disappointed find don't accept reward drinks location  Otherwise meets all high standards set Starbucks brand  <EOR> Decided give place try even though rating 1 5 stars   The place nearly empty since Tuesday before Christmas hotel slow     A strange thing happened walked in   girls working some kind medical issue she waiting couple people   She suddenly back fainted   whole staff understandably back check call help  But manager able split crew wait customers  take care down teammate   So down review     The place pretty big   Lots places sit relax latte gingerbread cookie  WiFi thru Venetian Palazzo network     Couldn't good reading staff because emergency talked earlier  But staff seems large if working well together should able deliver orders quickly keep place orderly   So three five stars    <EOR> Usually no problems location but sassy little Hispanic young lady much makeup nothing but attitude  <EOR> It's almost 3 months since opened location consistently shows still don't know Starbucks drinks they're totally ok half assing it  only slightly ashamed say almost always tend more instagrammable fraps lattes  If paying $7 coffee only ask made supposed be   We ordered zombie frap over Halloween pale green frap almost white whip vs magenta supposed be  When handed back them couldn't believe worker told manager see she noticed wrong color  Why would serve something knew totally wrong then act completely put when ask remake right way    I heard kept lot employees when Cafe Press closed maybe  biggest problem  Whatever reason don't waste your money here  If you're Venetian Palazzo try other coffee spots Bouchon Bakery Illy Coffee Bean although they've raised prices match Starbucks   <EOR>
