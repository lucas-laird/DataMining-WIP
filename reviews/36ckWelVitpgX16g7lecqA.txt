Beautiful atmosphere excellent service exquisite wood fired pizza ! Went dinner family 4 Sunday night  lucky seated immediately  A comprehensive menu while no kids menu cater smaller servings pasta children   Highly recommended sea restaurants pun intended Venetian  <EOR> Honestly if want keep walking  prices high something isn't even worth it  Everything super bland weird tasting  watched them drop silverware floor proceed give table without switching clean one  Try somewhere else   It's terrible but worth price your paying  <EOR> Even before going read Yelp reviews thought myself every place deserves chance! Read low reviews concur those guests    I thought myself they're nice hotel always pass restaurant when we're Palazzo  always packed but now ask myself why people frequent restaurant?!   I only rated place 2 stars location ambience    Service 1 5 mean sad waiters don't even ask if need refill your beverage?! guests party around party refilled water  call them when others needed soda refills   just bad service already    Food 1 5 Bruschette Miste really nothing special  better bread CPK  Seriously    Pane Veneto 1 5 sure particular appetizer but seems something could seriously whip home  No joke    Cannelloni Di Pollo 1 5 looked description foods before ordering thought myself wrong this?! sounds safe picking  better off eating some frozen pasta box  lacked lot flavor just wasn't special  Presentation well think expecting more  Especially when location restaurant always busy when pass by  no longer wonder food tastes like    I believe first impressions just visit alone won't returning  Save your money elsewhere  <EOR> Expensive good food  outside seating pretty but worth it  sent pasta back because cold now feel sick since t heavy cream  <EOR> Had veal  Reminiscent pack little caesar dog food   Taste texture   Wish could experienced others reviews  <EOR> We told 20 minute wait  found ourself waiting outside 3 hours listening terrible sad music  When said table asked long would take food said earliest 45 minutes even lying making wait 3 hours no exaggeration   walked table saw many other open tables left because  angry them could believe eyes  When left manager cussed out    never angry life  liars disrespectful people  <EOR> Very very bad treatment!!

I say definietly great place peopel watch if seat 'outside' but think stick other smaller places instead  <EOR> Skip place  Overrated  Came February 2016 6 friends  dined outside enjoy view San Marco Square very near hostess area  Yet Service HORRIBLE  seated before several tables yet other tables served first some reason  felt exhausted having ask everything!! Yes EVERYTHING even basics! Asked more water 4x  ask more sparkling bottled water  Asked more bread 2x  ask more butter  Even Parmesan cheese fresh ground pepper  Exhausting!! Everyone meal delayed over plate which took long felt another waiter took order waiter goofed up  ask Parmesan cheese but apparently wait staff felt only available person asked it  automatically asked table  even call them back again because wait staff forgot two people! also very loud jaw dropping dish cart  wheeled cart quickly table several times clear dishes BANG Bang BANG very very loud cobblestone disrupt dinner  food just OK  exhausting dinner all left disappointed frustrated felt very ripped off  sitting right front wait staff never felt waited on  Skip place  <EOR> This place ok  location ambience  probably helping 3 stars  Food  sounds fancy but impressed much  Overall something put resume say did it  <EOR> I LOVE here! celebrated husband's birthday last October staff accommodated us! party 50 people  food delicious always! love ambiance  more could ask for? <EOR> Mixed feelings place  atmosphere great location  Food decent but service great  But may just experience more attentive servers helping other tables bar  First sat bar since just but overlooked several times until  someone helped me  Then received minimal help drinks food  Seems regular menu only available restaurant finished drink n then into restaurant  server sweet old man probably around 80 spoke mostly Italian  No offer regular drink wine  No offer cheese minestrone soup  Probably won't come back mediocre food service  <EOR> This restaurant located central plaza Venetian outdoor indoor seating nice views plaza canal free performance happen frequently plaza   Me daughter decided menu looked interesting since place full seated immediately  put small table two right side arguably worst locations although three empty tables facing plaza  first didn't mind but couples arrived minutes plaza seats  Why restaurants that? first early rewarded worst tables house?  I ordered Insalata Canaletto grilled chicken $18 daughter Tagliatelli $22   Both good but spend amount money two simple lunch dishes bit over top unless those dishes some out of world tastes condiments spices etc   Service good but again amount money service should royal  should gotten some respect hostess giving better table since plenty available   I travel Vegas 5 6 times year dinned dozens restaurants ultra upscale simplest downtown thus believe Canaletto better job food service and prices    Anyway location great thus recommended   Cheers! <EOR> Terrific food completely adorable venetian plaza   What's love   wonderful Risotto delicious meatball appetizer start   Done perfection   plaza delightful wait staff attentive   highly recommend Canaletto  <EOR> Excellent food drinks especially lemon drop martini service!
