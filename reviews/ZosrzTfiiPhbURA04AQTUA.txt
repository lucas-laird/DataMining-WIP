Service good coffee still meh  return  <EOR> I need preface saying only thing ordered free Bloody Marys earned through MyVEGAS app  However sitting waiting them waitstaff AWESOME super friendly especially considering getting something free  Really nice people quick  fact staying MGM Grand decided spot next time we'd stay Luxor just because service good  also read menu while waited decided spot we'd back because everything looked very good  restaurant very clean open even though many people quiet intimate  Cool decor  Can't wait back eat there! And Bloody Marys divine! <EOR> The food's bad selection great  real convenience they're 24 7 serve breakfast all hours  Worth going cheap meal otherwise expensive place  <EOR> I don't know fact serve some ridiculously good hashbrowns?  Could service totally sucks but don't care because its 24 hours prices decent?  could but some reason remained fan Pyramid Cafe through good times bad   Given nature many Las Vegas' residents visitors more places should more late night hours   24 7 joint Pyramid Cafe diner food becomes reality but pyramid themed corner Luxor   Beware sandwiches overpriced waitresses     meaning they're being paid much Luxor deliver crap service  <EOR> My family came breakfast  ordered steak omelett wasn't bad all  mom ordered steak eggs she said meal also good tasty  aside them over cooking steak just tad  <EOR> I all american breakfast sausage links   hash browns bland crispy eggs bit runny I scrambled sausages meh   really bad Denny's but more expensive  <EOR> Great breakfast   Love omelets standard breakfast fare   Oatmeal brulee wonderful   favorite remains cinnamon roll French toast   Lines long around 9 a m   service great both times trip  <EOR> Got comped breakfast before left Vegas   If pay may given star   service SLOW   finally ask waitress because she nowhere seen   egg white omellette tasted pure butter   edible but much more that    hashbrowns alright because enough crispiness them decent   The best part stellar busboy   He kept Diet Cokes coming all meal long   Unless free would pass Pyramid  <EOR> Overpriced slow  watched people came served eat breakfast leave before breakfast served  Maybe slow server  omelet coffee tax tip $22  going back  <EOR> First time here  found place good place quick meal  Place well staffed plenty seats  Sunday mid morning although busy more few minutes wait    Service excellent everyone  Orders taken quickly coffee waters kept filled all orders came together timely manner    Menu selection excellent breakfast served all day  Prices reasonable strip location  all liked food    We would return  <EOR> Waited 15 20 minutes seated   seems short wait Vegas breakfast 11am psyched   Unfortunately waited longer acknowledged table   Don't seat if going ignored   Especially when eating breakfast 11am clearly late night before   server all caring needing anything only person all efficient woman pouring water coffee clearing tables   server made no eye contact she walked fifteen times then finally came over couldn't wait leave   She no positive customer service skills   She did order correct though plus   Also food good but very greasy  breakfast skillet avocado instead meat  <EOR> This place OK best  Would gotten 3 stars if food came faster servers friendly attentive though  If want pretty loud restaurant youre into paying $15 canned corned beef hash place be  <EOR> Coffee good Eggs Benedict actually pretty good wife corned beef sandwich rye service pretty good pushy inattentive     Moral story visiting is better hotels better breakfast spot     Nothing spectacular but if stay Luxor would definitely hit  place really bother venture when could something pretty good reasonable price pinch  <EOR> Pretty Good food but earth did spend $64 basic breakfast party 3!? Oh bad juice coffee $4 soda $3 50!! Crazy <EOR> Fairly unimpressive spot   They offer typical breakfast items you'd expect but nothing fantastic memorable   Nothing menu actually looked very good just ordered salad fine   I sampled few dishes friends' plates nothing very good tough scrambled eggs dry bread overcooked omelets  I would back unless forced to  <EOR> So scenario spent last several hours Spearmint Rhino came back hotel won over $100 2 minutes roulette find myself locked room    6 30 am need catch 10 30 am flight   could just ask another key try catch hour two sleep head but instead let stomach talking way back down registration desk pass Pyramid Cafe   I thinking steak eggs but instead corned beef hash   food excellent but think just because starving Chinese food Shanghai Lilly night before already completely worn off   The waiter nice accomodating but nothing special  <EOR> We 25 dollar coupon use Luxor before drove back LA Sunday brunch cafe  food you'd expect place perfectly edible but prices outrageous    know Vegas adjust views accordingly    It also poor service  wasn't extremely harried waiter's fault  he apparently 16 tables cover morning rush  shouldn't surprise onslaught  checkout time course there's going rush  But far few waiters long line form hostess table despite having third restaurant empty   Skip place  just bagel starbucks your way stop somewhere road  Unless you're situation coupon there's really no reason here  <EOR> Great 24 hour cafe Vegas      Staff very friendly attentive  wanted something basic just ham cheese sandwich but couldn't find menu  waitress tells offer would place order right away  nice her!!! Anyone else could just ignored wait until ordered being ordered time menu  only did sandwich but really good portion made two expensive    Two nights later again  Another friendly waiter time friend shared burger he even split each share fries    Yes good food obviously important but good service also must fans   <EOR> Went breakfast since staying Luxor didn't want stop Starbucks  Nothing really spectacular Healthy Choice which scrambled eggs veggies side fruit  Food good way  Staff super friendly  <EOR> I've always avoided eating Luxor  because restaurant lineup never appealed me  But decided give cafe shot friend checking menu  offer plenty standard breakfast lunch fare but standout dishes reside diverse selection French toast  don't just add different toppings same bread  utilize different types create best profile   Despite lack carrots carrot cake French toast bread soaked through custard topped garnishes added nice variety tastes textures standout dish  Likewise strawberry shortcake French toast enticing array flavors highlighted strawberry compote  Lighter overall carrot cake equally good   Less successful red velvet pancakes tough almost rubbery texture icing thick grainy  However hints caramel nice touch  monte cristo solid rendition exterior providing plenty crunch  could benefited more ham but flavors still decent   With menu full items more likely satisfy impress specialty items French toast should ordered memorable meal   4 Stars <EOR> After arriving LV late night 9pm most buffetts already closed   just wanted someplace close quick meal before getting some rest   should've walked further!  We've already knew we're bad day when sat right entrance   asked something inside it pretty quiet inside but told full   looked menu all 6 guys ordered prime rib $19    figured hell since wasn't paying one guys hit $1800 jackpot before arrived buying dinner    order medium cook   When rib arrived cooked completely through making rib tough   service pretty slow except when giving bill They QUICK!
