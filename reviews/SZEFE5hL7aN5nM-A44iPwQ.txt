And even given service problems Prime's biggest failing steaks very poorly prepared  Mine perhaps worst offered bone in filet special which ordered medium rare but came extreme 'black blue' gushing red middle while being charred outside  Several party members noted steaks overcooked  steak also very very salty   Originally going give +1* because some solid sides including truffle mashed potatoes macaroni cheese gnocchi Brussels sprouts also tuna ribbons appetizer tasty nice spicy kick accompanying sauce  problem Prime appetizers sides ignores steak bad service? wouldn't even though Prime closer 1 5  why can't good faith rate any higher 1*  <EOR> I am glad checked Prime birthday! sister in law lives Vegas said she's wanting try Prime why not? made reservations seated outside spectacular view Bellagio water show  hot day but when water show actually little bit cool water breeze every now then   From beginning end experience classy AF  server Brandon he kind funny kind dude  He totally entertained need take pictures all food see attached food photos nom nom nom cracked little jokes when scarfed down appetizers   We ordered oysters steak tartare market tomato salad appetizers  delicious came quickly finished every bite it  all well bottle bubbly celebrating birthday! soon enough sided entrees came out   The sides crispy maiitake mushrooms BOMB! careful because sauce comes spicy  saying mushrooms taste Hot Cheetos!

sommelier help $100 bottle best acceptable  allow people know zilch wine take your order recommendations  really unacceptable  Then again Vegas place absolutely no class unless no class  restaurant perfect example view why Michelin stopped rating Las Vegas restaurants  simply no restaurants LV especially big French names deserving old Michelin ratings even forks    The place slightly understaffed really understaffed professionals  ordered sushi dish appetizer  Really bad crust tasted cardboard could find Sushi taste fruit pilings thing  also back  $14 piece fruited cheesecake good

No no no no no no nooooo please  straight sin book  <EOR> With Prime's level snobbery you'd least think chef would season steaks before cooking     If you're looking standard steakhouse menu set palace Versailles then Prime probably you   Highlights menu pretty standard fare but all staples steaks potatoes French onion soup shrimp cocktail creamed spinach etc  quality ingredients very good potato dauphinoise very tasty side dish option  wine list pretty expansive well   Low lights Prime's ambiance extremely stuffy  waitstaff does little way making feel home found server very impatient overbearing  ornate setting doesn't really compliment menu properly however panoramic windows dining room provide nice view Bellagio's water show  None steaks seasoned before cooking which practically cardinal sin  would any chef hope create perfect crust flavor profile without generous helping salt black pepper? Seriously disappointing     If you're staying Bellagio looking steak dinner Prime convenient option  Otherwise absolutely fantastic Carnevino Palazzo  <EOR> Amazing food   Amazing service   Everybody knows exactly serving what   Foodie place worth spending extra money amazing meal amazing view   fountains going off just added ambiance  <EOR> My gf some good friends treated place bday dinner!

No  But very good   We relatively slow Sunday night  didn't reservations because honestly didn't think we'd need any  8 30 asked table three  Even though dining room looked busy wasn't completely full  asked if reservation said no put 9 00 told come back 9 00  gambled then came back table ready right when there  appreciate promptness   The dining room tad small side but dark cozy  chairs nice comfortable tables large  felt underdressed T shirt jeans  Though don't enforce dress code sign says recommend jacket men  sure dress code women but pretty sure T shirt jeans didn't quite cut   Unfortunately didn't table window  could still see water show table but couldn't hear music  sure if reservation well advance probably could requested window table but oh well  But yeah if reservations ask window table! They're really nice water show comes every 10 minutes so  nice little distraction during dinner y'know?  Anyway waiter bomb  Generally uppity steakhouse places waiters tad pompous  But ours awesome  He cracked jokes told specials answered any questions menu  He also made great wine recommendations well  He great!  We each steak well few sides a T bone friend filet bf some kind regular steak   food came 20 minutes  steak very good  moist juicy flavorful  only small complaint *tad* overcooked  asked medium rare came little more medium side  All steaks accompanied several homemade sauces  favorite house sauce which some soy based sauce  yummy! sides creamed spinach asparagus sauteed mushrooms  sides OK size  All three could split them but bigger helping would great  asparagus good all  overcooked more soggy crunchy  disappointed because  favorite veggies  creamed spinach good but could used some garlic other flavoring  mushrooms far best side dish  flavorful delicious! If known advance would gotten two orders mushrooms passed asparagus    We passed dessert since all pretty much full  When bill came tad over $300  bad three us  All all positive experience  probably wouldn't again seeing don't Vegas much would try different steakhouse next time  But definitely liked would recommend friend  <EOR> Setting elegant gets   service polite attentive but rushing   Your meal hour least   seated patio close Bellagio waters   Best seat house water show   A fantastic experience great family friends bachelor party weekend   Truly memory treasure rest life   food spectacular bill!

Especially if people note should tasted  really turned off this  Personally didn't eat all day could indulge everything wanted  He kind made decision when reciting back ordered   incredibly uncomfortable felt judged appetite didn't put fight told husband keep quiet well  many fine steakhouses NEVER happened before    The food deserved stars but service negated lot points  truffle potatoes worthy all praise  salad delicious  steak little red liking even medium rare but still yummy  liked steak came three sauces sample really enjoyed house speciality sauce  bit soy sauce Asian blend  husband also enjoyed steak  Interestingly noted woman left same steak but same waiter offered to   cut her? right first waiter gruff practically kvelling gossiping two older ladies next us   Did look degenerates?
