I'd understand if but if purposely don't change  just lazy  asking kind energy drinks only rockstar she responded part special  know  Thats asked you  Smiling every once while wouldn't hurt either    They beer always good  Mostly domestics but Fat Fire caught attention  buy pizza $20 buy slice  Stromboli's $8 decided try two slices split Stromboli  2 slices drink $8 bad  Especially since slices big even lift!   Now cheese pizza since special  marinara sauce needed some salt  great besides that  Stromboli really good  Amazing amount cheese never much cheese pepperoni but also needed some salt  When added salt everything came together much more  both agreed Stromboli better pizza itself! enjoyed place  definitely come back! <EOR> Had supreme pizza Stromboli  sure Stromboli maybe just used being onions peppers Stromboli  also much cheese compared used to  Least favorite Stromboli ever had  pizza supreme average best  Papa johns would've better  <EOR> I must say buffalo chicken pizza deliciously  little upset didn't any ranch salad dressing  <EOR> Good Stromboli   Probably best place eat won't break bank downtown summerlin  <EOR> The pizza nothing special  price paid pizza slice taste decent but nothing tried before  lot room sit inside restaurant  place would usually to  would only come back if only option food  <EOR> We workout outside smell pizza 10 laps around mall decided try it!  expensive but very much worth price because staff fabulous manners   happy tried little place would recommend establishment friend NY style pizza Downtown Summerlin   My regular place far near Trop Duneville but could see coming just pizza  <EOR> Convenient shockingly good pizza!  When shopping you're normally looking something quick fits bill!  Been dozen times continue trend <EOR> As good frozen pizza grocery aisle  Mushroom pizza few pieces canned previously frozen mushrooms  Mushrooms soggy ugly tasteless  all three employees behind counter greet nor thank your patronage  Maybe service only thing authentic New York style? <EOR> Love pizza here! whole pepperoni pizza  $23 worth it! pizza easily feed 4 people super good! <EOR> Solid 4 stars!  I've craving pizza back home  wanted slice little grease cheese melted perfectly slightly sweet sauce crust cooked perfectly when fold bottom lip falls over  wasn't expecting much  pizza looked maybe 5 7 minutes generally don't way reheat but since quick came quite delicious! I'd prefer little sweeter sauce but all all pretty good  imagine fresh pie would even better  $3 45 plain slice but Downtown Summerlin expected  didn't take home menu dont offer much else besides pizza  I'd suggest coming around lunch dinnertime when pizza should kinda fresh  definitely back here  <EOR> Great spot slice  Conveniently located Downtown Summerlin  Fast great service  Delicious slice  <EOR> Let start off saying pizza actually good  But totally worth because headache dealing staff location  encountered some rudest people phone  When ordered take pizza would cold I'm assuming getting old pie even oven  Again pizza good but dealing hit miss more miss then hit type service I'd say pass save yourself head ache another place  <EOR> I mean pizza ate wasn't terrible but think lot room improvement  pizza pretty big price good but honestly think better pizza Dominos  snack recommend it  But lunch pretty mediocre  actual interior shop very crowded small could barely table since close together  heat individual slices oven when really hot  service fine  If looking cheap snack DTS then pretty good place  <EOR> This favorite pizza place Las Vegas!! #1 choice!!  only wish delivered!! love HUGE slice pizza soda very minimum price   eat every chance when Summerlin mall never disappointed!!   Bonanno's please delivery service!!! <EOR> I'm pretty sure place built pizza restaurant    super small when there's few people line only place line door where people sitting eating  Another weird thing noticed trash opening didn't fit plates serve pizza on   It's 8 inch opening crack plates half able throw them away    Very odd  staff young rude seemed robotic  last but least didn't cheese pepper shakers  kind pizza place this?! asked Parmesan cheese she under counter give packet  When asked two she roller eyes lol  last straw me! plenty other places eat downtown Summerlin  <EOR> I haven't slice pizza since January bc WW FANTASTIC! The girl behind counter polite friendly despite fact some RUDE customer decided bark something she no control over happy chose Bonanno's cheat day lol Thumbs staff food <EOR> The pizza good   However Caesar wilted    Also tables floor dirty   ate 30 minutes people working talked walked around but did clean   Maybe because late   1 hour before closing   But pizza incredible ignore dirt  <EOR> I want rate place higher but customer service experience brought down  guess staff entire family inside eat 4 young kids running around inside  already small inside kids running around  kids bumping into customers seated  parents kids talking employees behind counter kept ruining ruin missing order  baby couple months old counter employees holding baby instead paying attention customers he talking family instead  all family but your work your family causing ruckus!!! Pizza good but service experienced unacceptable restaurant <EOR> The pizza usually very good  some reason standards they've set  But today selection par fiancé looking forward stuffed pizza did offer it  3rd 4th time case  <EOR> I'm just going come right say it! prefer pizza over Pieology's  is! air! better!  The pizza great snack when you've walking around Downtown need afternoon bite before your ice cream taco  cheesy crisp thin crust! Mmmm    <EOR> Not bad  slice soda set back $7 50  Higher most places but Summerlin  Slices little larger if pizzeria order 2 slices  Very small inside dining area  <EOR> Don't even bother stopping eat here  stopped tried slice pizza mushrooms garlic knot  pizza dough thin center  first half pizza slice soggy because being thin  others saying garlic knots true  just tasted roll bread much garlic flavor all  Also busy when in  need better system identifying food order counter  placed food counter someone else came grabbed plate started drinking drink  find very bothersome general public touching food  <EOR> My boyfriend family outdoor mall doing some day xmas shopping  starving freezing didn't want walk other side mall towards more restaurant area  decided Bonanno's NY Pizzeria  7 place pretty small inside packed ended sitting outside under heated lamps could some space   The garlic knots super good! tomato basil red onion pizza pretty flavorful too!
