Oh yeah AC pumping felt cool 72 degrees too  <EOR> Located right across street Hard Rock Hotel Casino   Fantastic food large portions  girlfriend both ordered Street Carnitas tacos along side rice beans could barely walk place once finished  1 star waitress attitude cool piss entire time  way she provided good service very attentive despite poor attitude   tipped well waddled restaurant  <EOR> Haven't any food yet besides bar popcorn which seasoned little cajun seasoning delicious  Katie bartender friendly helpful quite witty  made just time start happy hour wow deal  2 1 specials anything alcohol  Shots margaritas beers etc  buy free  Can't argue that   Even though didn't eat food saw brought around smelled great looked good too  def try some food next time def again    Located right across street Hard Rock would recommend anyone staying looking some local flair cheap drinks  let down especially if Katie working its happy hour  Plenty parking front also   Also Browns Backer bar if Browns fan looking bar close strip it  <EOR> Good atmosphere if noise  Good mix people  Great happy hour deals   two drinks  nachos good guac no onions which big plus me  Waitresses very friendly but bartenders assholes  It's close where work decent place chill work but don't think I'd drive cozy Northwest suburb down place just eat drink <EOR> Happy hour good but thats all good place  Food bad drinks just ok  <EOR> Great happy hour appetizers   staff swift friendly entertaining  <EOR> This place lot better thought would be   Came two weeks row Friday night    $2 Bud Select's already we're doing OK   Guitar Hero competition if play free beer   Ate some food tonight pretty solid   No real complaints place   If area am Hard Rock trying kill time definitely stop again  <EOR> After signing tab   cook comes saying he found credit card floor   WTF!!!

Manager Owner didn't care    at least give raise! <EOR> At first very pleased  2 1 margaritas happy hour actually alcohol them  fist decent margarita Las Vegas  Now coming California used strong margaritas free chips free salsa very good Mexican food    No free chips salsa here   We look menu $8 99 chips salsa guac  course pass! having dish included chips salsa he offered give me  couple ordered tacos ordered hamburger all which pretty good my husband loved hamburger nice sized portions    The dish came salsa came miniature plastic cup ounce the kind little mexican places salsa go salsa  When commented size waitress said she could bring more if wanted  Naturally wanted more call waitress over she informs another wee ounce salsa $1 00 more  shocked she didn't seem apologetic all  mood changed immediately realized tourist town  visit Vegas frequently because son lives am used seeing short sighted restaurants are   To owners spending time your empty patio during happy hour   you really missing it  need cater locals   the cost chips salsa minimal guarantee minute start putting free chips salsa your tables your restaurant always full!! GUARANTEED!  Final word   definitely stop margarita during happy hour but careful order hidden extra charges  also off strip which parking handy  <EOR> it's summer tomatoes prime but canned used salsa here  Guac such bizarrely smooth texture there's something else beside avocados   cream cheese? Queso canned variety while bizarely addictive because else serves queso Vegas let's face any better none all   kind sour   Then lunch specials   Order tostada beware!  bring army hungry folks 2 loaded served generous side vegetables  Look getting lots food bad thing?

The food disgusting ordered Taco Salad should good no matter where um place really dad ordered burrito he disappointed well nothing even resembling tasty traditional mexican food more fast greasy frozen food sitting back yuck  could Taco Bell those fast food chains cuz if did tummy wouldn't sick week eating food  dad big bear drinker usually always orders draught beer he said place probably hasn't even cleaned pipes years beer flat no taste all yea trust cuz dad always leaves glass empty always asking another glass but time guess?!  I strongly recommend Paradise Cantina betters kitchen maybe hires actual cook fresh food also try's better customer service  servers very rude takes them forever take your order attitude pleasant all no clue what's menu when ask them questions food no clue don't even try explain   I'd also say would best if Paradise Cantina could try manage place better all together could better guys only lucky right now because tourists don't know stepping into but don't really thinks locals would place right now just junk all together   Funniest thing outside place HUGE banner saying #1 mexican place its even awarded umm idk think  true honestly     Sorry guys really hope improve somehow    <EOR> Beware!!! sure check check bank statements servers overcharge tip!
