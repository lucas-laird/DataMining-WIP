Easily best Chinese food ever had   highly recommend! <EOR> It finally come down quest decent Chinese food bite bullet drive Spring Valley San Francisco New York hop plane Beijing   The only reason giving Chow Mein House two stars instead liked minimalist modern decor lots white bit light wood green bamboo plants contrast   But food sucks   We skipped soup surprising 110° weather but only because couldn't agree one   wanted able compare hot sour every other place but husband wanted different one   just ordered two entrees Beef curry Szechuan chicken   Unlike everywhere else fowl foul? dish no ginger listed asked it   also added broccoli   interest full disclosure also asked no sugar no extra salt added   realize might affect taste but dish no sauce whatsoever!  When complained waiter said well wanted no salt sugar  NO!  didn't say wanted no SAUCE just no extra salt   Szechuan chicken maybe million times without sugar salt stipulations class itself   flunked   The vegetables both dishes undercooked   reason love veggies Chinese restaurants because crisp tender results something can't ever approximate home   Oh maybe could if wanted use wok extra high heat then clean grease three days   almost broke tooth unexpectedly uncooked carrot     The beef curry absolutely no taste curry   kitchen remade marginally better but margin minuscule   dish includes potatoes cooked but texture downright weird somewhat gummy didn't taste potatoes   vegetables woefully undercooked   The final straw came bill   wasn't surprised annoyed charged $1 extra broccoli   But added another buck ginger   Note did take off $1 sugar salt didn't add   IMO beyond petty   update previous negative comment another Yelper upcharge brown rice now $2 dollar he complained about   But least now listed menu   very small print   The search on  <EOR> Stopped try Wednesday night  Nice quiet food excellent service pleasant courteous  highly recommend Chinese restaurant  <EOR> Got ours but dining room looked nice  really enjoyed dishes    the sesame chicken wasn't overly battered nothing dripping oil  little more expensive but think really pay higher quality when comes Chinese  back  <EOR> Solid choice familiar yet inspired dishes  Chow Mein House open 18 months hit its stride according some locals  small group ordered number things try different tastes requirements easily met  When start lovely deep fried crunchies red sauce you're instantly able settle into your seats   The Corn Egg Drop soup good starter great chilly night  potstickers veggie pork veggie steamed fried  fried greasy nice flavor especially dipping sauce  Tried Tempura Shrimp which seemed place menu but still tasty  exceptional shrimp but coating perfect crispness won day    The Chicken Chow Mein hit  modified removing veggies I know right? but good despite meddling  scallops asparagus special very good bay scallops tons asparagus some carrots black beans black garllcky sauce  Also nice shrimp veggies dish peppers onion cabbage peas eggy clear sauce  If Chicken Fried Rice won't disappointed but may blown away  Not Chicken Fried Rice blow you away type dish first place lol    All all good family style eatin'  Saw number couples warm hospitable room comfortable place all parties  Chow Mein House great option  may razzle dazzle PF Chang's but also doesn't three hour wait Saturday night  Nice folks look forward visiting again  <EOR> I really place Maybe but couldn't find very well  But dark Doesn't really look average Chinese restaurant Looks more upscale  place small elegant restaurant order takeout food pretty dang good definitely better then lot other places side town  mongolian beef really good full onions onions but seems every place 75% onions ?

But today recommend place anyone!! having nice lunch special menu   Most them around $7 99 rice soup!! Does awesome?! yet! service great!  place CLEAN!! having 50 different types CHINESE FOODS!  Come on!! Try many favor want! come again sure! <EOR> Best general tso's chicken husband ever had!! Would definitely recommend! <EOR> They serve some flavor able dishes  order variety menu items  green bean chicken good beef broccoli hot sour great  only comment service  depends serving busy may be  But service very slow times  <EOR> First off clear while spent over $200 food only delivery cannot comment atmosphere store service   The quick dirty review am going continue order location highly recommend it!  Fantastic quality food opinion very good value   While bit pricey $10 $16 each order portions LARGE   stupid large Hash House just very good sized   My problem consistency which assume delivery   couple examples The first time ordered 3 fortune cookies delivery which seemed appropriate 3 entrees second time none   last few times  received 8 nine   Certainly big deal but indicator consistency standards   The first time ordered Mu Shu Pork forgot include wraps I ate rice absolutely YUMMY    second time ordered Mu Shu pork asked person phone if could 2 extra wraps because did receive any previous time   He said ok when arrived did indeed 4 wraps comes normally   But no extra wraps   charged $1 2 did receive LOL   BTW would fine $1 charge 2 extra wraps quantity Mu Shu Pork large wont fit 4 wraps!  Just back consistency   chalk language barriers   On food note relating consistency first two times ordered cashew chicken cashews abundant way more would expect being such high cost item toasted roasted fried lovely buttery flavor outsides being just wee bit black even more roasted goodness   last time bunch cashews thrown top right can   Bummer   Probably because ordered within hour closing time   A couple more food notes foodies While Sizzling Rice soup full goodies shrimp broth way thin opinion   Perhaps others way?  LOVE presentation rice crispies   cut into squares!  sure holds them together but guarantee melted marsh mellow I am afraid ask but beef Mongolian Beef tender enough cut fork   The lettuce wraps kinda bland Perhaps am just used spicey ones other places   fair nothing menu would even hint going spicy   simply ASSUMED    BAD BOY!  roast pine nuts very welcome twist though!  highly recommend dish BUT!  Mu Shu pork give very generous portion food but only 4 pieces lettuce LOL   suggest sure some lettuce fridge your own because once again portion never fit into 4 pieces lettuce   The Honey Walnut Prawns expected least   While prawns indeed large 8 10 them House Honey Sauce glop mayonaisey repulsion   think need more work one   menu sound more honey glaze some kind but noooooooo   Sweet mayo does rank high gastronomical delights   glazed walnuts could use some work too   Some just straight toasted walnuts glaze included   To finish good note though recommend least trying place   dearth decent good chinese food outside China Town continue explore menu because given hope finding some really good items  <EOR> Fresh ingredients novelty among Chinese restaurants but place nails it  haven't anything didn't like  Highly recommended  <EOR> Food good service No refills ask check twice  Asked box waitress took plates brought them back 10 minuets later box  did food lol ? really fried wonton papers skins come complementary sweet sour sauce pretty bad  sauce itself caked over gelatin   <EOR> I looking great Chinese restaurant Las Vegas  finally found it!  food wonderful  Shrimp beef chicken vegetables all fresh portions generous    I cannot wait return  <EOR> The mu shu pork pretty good  almost identical same dish 2 other takeout restaurants offer it  Big portion lots veggies lots port but hate fat pork that's probably avoidable    This first time getting takeout noticed white linen flowers tables waited order  Fancy! Preparation takeout meal lightning fast just expected! menu chock full all usual fare think place worth checking out  <EOR> First time ordering Yelp site also first time eating here  must say navigating ordering page super simple convenient  nice service offered  let's down good stuff  husband ordered Generals Chicken steamed rice while ordered Orange chicken also steamed rice  side wings well I wasn't sure while ordering but thought would give them try head over pickup scheduled time food already set go! Awesome! young guy greeted gave order  He very nice even little playful  great see happy people while work  pre paid walked super fast very pleasant welcoming  When returned home really surprised big portions were  could easily fed another couple but since just two save later mean $12 99 because always order white meat but even then totally worth it  enough chicken two enough rice two each meal  really enjoyed both chickens but favorite orange  hot wings    don't think order those again didn't taste bad but just didn't satisfy taste buds  husband wasn't huge fan them skip those next time  Overall still give place 5 stars because generally great experience  Just because didn't particularly wings doesn't mean someone else won't  eating again soon taking family when come visit! Oh yeah when checking online box coupons since spent $30 4 free cans coke! Hey take super cool  Check place out <EOR> My Review Guideline I always rate 3 categories rate give overall rate 3 categories  However average  3 categories are Ambience Service Food 1 Star means recommend people love most 2 stars mean but some people might 3 stars mean consistent example food taste different if more once 4 stars mean would visit again but invite people love could risky 5 stars mean absolutely love would visit everyday if could bring wife it'll first restaurant visit when friends come visit                   Chinese Restaurants really every where some more affordable some expensive lot them serve similar type food but general Chow Mein House nice   Ambience For restaurant big well organized nice clean white table clothes  Also typical Chinese restaurant smell  ****  Service Many people's experience Chinese restaurant service isn't greatest dull tone almost seems shouting but other general experiences service good  pay attention refilling water pretty well take food away table box remaining food everything quick  ****  Food We ordered Mushu Pork General Tsao Chicken Mongolian Beef  General Tsao Chicken actually very good  kind food restaurants salty sweet but fried batter wasn't thick sauce nice delicious  other hand Mushu Pork Mongolian Beef salty side  Yes general rule thumb restaurant cook food little saltier dull less seasoning but little much  Hence ate lot rice result box two go  *** <EOR>
