This place absolutely worst  must admit given WAY many chances    only fact love tropical smoothie only neighborhood    Most people work look just jail need help meth addiction  Which could explain circus shit hear speaker fact RUDE unprofessional  pull speaker today woman laughing  She repeat order 3 times she said back me   Still laughing  pull window girl opens window doesn't say anything    said give total?!?! She said did want order? You've kidding me  said didn't just order say 3 times repeated me? She blank look face first human interaction she high mind she couldn't function  When FINALLY handed order different woman  hands dirty nails chipped old black polish   looked she just spent all day changing oil  Needless say won't eating food ordered because no idea if nasty people wearing gloves  there's 12 dollars wasted    Like said wasn't first experience location fault going back    The other times tried eat seems always problem speaker  frustrating    people always rude  ALWAYS something  never read menu sign     Has health inspector recently? don't think people working would pass inspection  hiring junkies? <EOR> 2nd time being pull drive through speaker no 3 mins pull window continue waiting leave when same man last time opens window saying he bathroom    order drink w little while it  driving home notice things drink hard chewable  thought maybe seeds something but when home inspected pieces found little part anything supposed drink little purple shard something felt little rocks when drinking smoothie    somewhat sharp too     Not best    Customer service poor    order done way asked  two smoothies unsweetened when them both sweetened    back when told guy over speaker he just said ok  smoothie done right 2nd time but irritating having drive back  <EOR> Excellent service clean location pleasant staff ! Jojo very dedicated always helpful! am stopping Lunch much great healthy food  <EOR> The staff made smoothie meal amazing but strictly management team sets them failure  stopped Sunday morning order flat bread meal but flat bread bacon  show today hoping would but wrong ran Thai sauce  felt bad employee because she apologize multiple times items she didn't have  management team please keep track stock because slowly lose customers  <EOR> Horrible service wouldn't even pick phone when just plain rude messed order twice  Won't ever visit location again  Hope some new employees actually care bit job  <EOR> If could give location no stars would  given location three tries now EVERY time something missing order made wrong  am currently sitting drive thru window  ordered spinach feta omelette wrap smoothie  come back because didn't put any egg spinach feta OMELETTE wrap  No apology  Nothing  Just Oh remake you  Ridiculous  Awful customer service  never come location again  <EOR> Great smoothies poor service  friends ordering smoothies man them but did take order  He didn't even acknowledge there  trying attention but seemed if he deaf ignoring me  decided order because smoothies $5 shouldn't wait  friends talking then them bathroom  She said smelled smoke before She want small bathroom did smell smoke Even though no smoking sign outside café  Since didn't buy  smoothie decided ask extra cup mix some friends smoothies into  only thing liked café smoothies taste good but according friends just sweet  +1 star taste 4 service  <EOR> It says open until 2am but  really only drive thru  We're 10 20am front doors closed  seems bit overpriced smoothies sandwiches  sunrise sunset honestly super boring smoothie  husband peaches silk lot more flavorful but still great  each Sriracha flatbread well which ok but nothing special  Disappointing  <EOR> Almost passed location up  new logo look generic Tropical Smoothie but guess entire company rebranding   must new location because couldn't find check Yelp    I pulled 24 hour drive thru since didn't want walk kids in   repeating Pear'ific Green Tea 4 times she couldn't understand she asked pull window continue ordering  asked if there's menu window look while ordering  No response pulled window requested  She said couldn't understand through drive thru  did want order? repeated Pear'ific Green Tea no sweetener turbenado  asked menu kids review   She left window came back catering menu   losing patience point definitely more troublesome experience if just walked in  She leaves window again decided just restaurant    The experience inside wasn't much better  menu all way against back wall but ordering counter 20' wall there's partition line sight ordering counter  Strange setup  kids couldn't read menu counter walked over bar where menu more visible however awkwardly far cashier   made even worse while ordering counter cashier ringing drive thru window  Lol  just such awkward experience  Maybe because she only employee she drawer setup window accommodate drive thru?  After finally smoothie orders added spinach salad  She asked if wanted small large  told large all 3 going share side dinner  asked dressing side since going accompany dinner home  She replied all toppings separate containers side  Perfect!  HOWEVER when home opened salad bed spinach under all containers toppings yes containers placed salad toppings took 3 4 box  Large salad?  even close enough all share even side  maybe 6 oz spinach box some turkey bacon weird taste almost tasted fish if any sense all peaches salad syrup  Ick  even slight bit satisfied  waste money   used order salads Tropical Smoothie all time  huge delicious   definitely THAT     The cashier wasn't friendly staff other locations however she wasn't rude either  She just take order then it    We did good deal smoothies because ordered during happy hour buy 2 1 free because Sunday free supplement added smoothie  probably only positive experience    Overall and unfortunately location failed deliver expect brand  <EOR> I'd give negative stars if could  way work ordered paid via app  When arrived absolutely nobody there  even Sysco delivery driver huge food delivery able hold anybody  corporate phone number website continuously busy  drove next closest location refused help honor order because said franchise won't money  Pretty crappy attitude over huge $7 order  <EOR> Terrible customer service don't ever any Ingredients food  come tropical smoothie beyond meat guy literally no idea even carried course out  then tried order salad without greens it  Why even offer food if don't carry it  When then asked peanut butter cup he just said peanut butter cup peanut paradise  Oh ok  helpful  There's other locations better  <EOR> Not all Tropical Smoothie Cafe's created equal  unfortunately place earned first star  location needs serious revamp  First all they're highly under staffed appreciated employee doing all he could  But he overwhelmed took awhile take order  really hot there  Perhaps problems A C? young man great apologetic made drinks  Unfortunately he made drink wrong  He offered fix but wasn't much better  don't fault  lack training  He also informed having problem POS system rewards didn't register  can't fault but location needs help  <EOR> THE WORST!

He tells worry manager would refund back me  When asked he didn't seem know when asked if customer needs refund next few hrs you'll tell them 'too bad'?! response just yyyep   I pretty shocked incapability disorganisation business but no choice but come back later when assured manager would around 7pm   Cut 7pm  back  Just 1 server whole place AGAIN wait   again!   Guess what? He's manager can't refund  kidding me?!!  As massively frustrated poor server no idea morning colleagues manager walks clearly whim reactions  HOORAY anyway though   After ANOTHER 15mins manager seemingly confused pacing back forth being able pull order FINALLY REFUND run there  NEVER return!
