Absolutely unacceptable  reaction management lady did alleviate situation she made wait until 5 other people line finished paying before correcting situation    Absolutely horrible experience   restaurant should run  <EOR> We ate convenience  Once sat noticed no less 6 un bused tables around us  Gross  husband ordered chocolate shake which took while show runny warm  Burgers mediocre  Advice reservations  Elsewhere ! <EOR> While Vegas check place out  surprised burger much better expected low price  regular stops when Vegas  <EOR> Don't waste your time money!!  beer served glasses obviously right dishwasher warmer room temperature   Course waiting over 30 minutes someone even acknowledge there!

The bowl chili good very good portion but wish some veggie celery rather generous portion meat  bun burger could better though  <EOR> By far best value strip  burger fries well cooked no problems waiter person ushering table I believe name Bianca   pretty much good gets  $2 burgers fries  think glass coke almost $4 must money off drinks    The only thing I'd aware going filled drunk people around 3 morning   usually when bars especially Carnval Court next door close  <EOR> I think said Flamingo good food but staying poor little feet could take another step    I ordered po' boy boy poorly made served  server switched mid shift never spoke word doing so   okay but then next guy served just rude unfriendly  would enjoyed food if did crunkies  <EOR> I just gotten back first trip Vegas stayed Flamingo   ended eating Burger Joint every night wasn't because loved it   reason ate every night because almost every restaurant closed around 11 00 p m  midnight!  would trek around town looking somewhere eat no luck would return Burger Joint   Each time no wait fantastic   first night tried breakfast which great!  money lot food   waitress alright   Nothing fantastic   The second night no wait again party seven   tried chicken tenders which alright   better Burger King   waitress night great!  As third night decided order pizza which isn't menu comes pizza restaurant next door closes 11 p m  but still serve pizza?  Confusing  Anyway decided carry but still made sit table instead letting order room service   wasted table seven just could sit wait pizza   didn't sense   Then waiter big attitude no reason yelled dad just watching TVs around restaurant   pizza good   Extremely cheesy good   As first timers Vegas thought every thing stayed open late needless say surprised!  If sure ask them ALL menu!  give menu only HALF make!  hope good server!  Good luck! <EOR> Eh  Good 2am Burger Bar @ Mandalay closed far away  Service pretty good but food wise pay Vegas wise     good enough late night munchies but won't craving next trip  <EOR> Had lunch couple friends okay but food did take while come out  <EOR> The Burger Joint nightly visit girls January $3 burger fries hard beat!    so imagine heart broken see $3 burger fries $5 steak eggs combo now risen $8 99!
