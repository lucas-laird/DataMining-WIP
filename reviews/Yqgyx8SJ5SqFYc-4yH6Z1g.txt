I bad feeling once ask table away door twice cold afternoon  I believe boss sitting     When decided order wanted order first family running tad late  server nerve tell orders all messed if order now then add more later  You've established business long now you're still having problems kitchen organization?  We ordered pan fried wontons  mom wanted add another order she asked but server added wrong item came steamed wontons which isn't ordered  did order fried wontons  However server came told mom  she ordered know  she ordered    My mom being server herself didn't want cause trouble just said its fine we'll keep it  Regardless didn't guy treated mom pointing saying she ordered when know she didn't  other server thought funny too  Absolutely rude   Don't come here  your XLB other Chinese establishments taste same if better better service  <EOR> Went groupon deal  quality food excellent absolutely delicious! menu excellent  picture everything! especially great because didn't quite know didn't mentally envision food might look through descriptions  Ah great adventures dining! say thing didn't quite appreciate service  Asian felt being treated red headed step children  placed orders food it  didn't even anyone come refill drinks nor ask if needed anything else  way wave down waiters  hate say but did notice others dining   who Asian getting lots attention  Maybe just waitress sucked  don't know   but annoying  Bad service lowers rating place me  food stated earlier great quality very tasteful  Grandma's short ribs yummy!

Needless say didn't finish dish   Overall really average  service pretty slow  top huge disappointment  pop ALL xiao long baos?!?! sure if come back    but if definitely trying something else maybe noodles something  <EOR> I love shanghai nese food since am shanghai nese   staff helpful ordering stuff   Food quite good no complaints   would come back when am town  <EOR> I would never discovered little gem if read article which Soho Chef John Chien Lee mentioned them   They're rather hidden since building isn't directly Spring Mountain but Decatur   First off place really pretty fancy inside staff friendly ball providing top notch service don't expect Chinatown establishment    Their XLB pretty good but best tried   best things tried stir fried lamb rice cake pork absolutely delicious!  also tried crispy fried salt pork shank which wouldn't order again   pretty tough $20 price tag expected much better     On next visit plan try braised pork shank lion's head meatballs other yelpers raving about  <EOR> Service Great  All staff super friendly helpful great sense humor   Chinese New Year last night friend parents Singapore   liked it   Very authentic   Beer wine only  The sizzling beef cumin lamb chops absolute must   If big group 10 more giant table enormous lazy Susan   awesome sharing  <EOR> I don't even want give star place! food terrible ordered 5 dishes none them taste right!
