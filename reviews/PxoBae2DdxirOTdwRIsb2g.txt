When home I live 2 minutes away everything cold  company very unhappily ate cold dinner  Next time throw some jeans Roberto's  <EOR> drive thru service convenient usually very quick  find quality food usually better Roberto's right around corner portions bigger  however don't use any shredded beef meat  ask carne asada instead shredded beef food 1000 times better every time  <EOR> If could give zero negative stars would  First couldn't repeat order back correctly through drive thru repeated three times needed 2 #14 all beans no rice  Drive pay she only entered she finally gets order right  drive home unpack car settle down eat  No beans all rice  Call complain told them repeatedly no longer receipt she said no manager store but they'd remake meals  into car drive back over  twit drive thru demands wrong meals back which didn't grab flew door  She refuses anything then demand money back now need dinner elsewhere can't eat rice  She demands receipt which I'd already explained ad nauseum no longer had  She's treating wrong when no English comprehending illegal screwed up  We'd eaten several times past but no longer give them business  <EOR> I location tonight  avid Don Tortaco customer expected same service would any other location  only person restaurant time stood few minutes waiting someone come greet me  saw them back eating chatting looked few times  standing front 10 minutes no hi no even away don't wanna serve asked workers doin soon said he turned head started speaking Spanish someone drive through! never completely disrespected life isn't first time people rude seem something against if look Hispanic but don't address them Spanish  finally ended just walking 15 minutes standing idiot 3 more minutes just plain disbelief  someone also works food service can't believe establishment would allow people work store represent them  disgusted  When back car daughter asked why didn't food tell guess somewhere else guys don't want serve   terrible experience both bunch low life piece shit scumbags  Don't support restaurant treats people this  Don't here! <EOR> First last time would never eat again!!! Would rather eat taco bell! Says lot place considering am Latin from  L A  The food horrible! !! <EOR> No pico de gallo! No pico de gallo! No pico de gallo! No pico de gallo! No pico de gallo! No pico de gallo! No pico de gallo! No pico de gallo! No pico de gallo! No pico de gallo! No pico de gallo! No pico de gallo!  How still fu$kig order when I'm using your primary language???    FYI everyone if say no pico de gallo better open your food before leaving  messed order twice before this  finally drove back made them re make stood watched every move  Then asked refund  normally very easy going but enough enough pico de gallo! <EOR> Meh  Can't even follow simple order sauce side   Super disappointed 2 options Mexican area  travel better food!  Now tasted both items     1 star  Lacks flavor  least throw some salt it!! <EOR> Delicious Hot Mexican Goodness! being small shop BIG Don Tortaco  gonna lie barely walk right now  burritos epic stuffed full meat veggies sauces provided inside haven't gone through drive through yet exquisite  gal took order spoke perfect English very friendly  Now gripe chicken burrito  tastes great but some reason take two big pieces chicken breast just stuff them which very difficult eat! If order strongly recommend asking them slice chicken bit first  They ala carte items range $4 $6 combo plates very filling which most $8 tax  Very modestly priced because dishes despite being fast food type joint easily $16 restaurant quality  Up point seen appear some very unfair reviews must say strongly disagree them  If good person positive attitude just happens live Southern Highlands maybe accident? fate? Mexican food place worth fair shot  But if those people just Taco Bell    Its right next door  <EOR> Inspite lackluster reviews Decided try place because its 24 hours close house  place around 5am  drive thru very well lit besides menus its very quite vacant area when pull in  wanted just test place didn't order anything big crazy  just 3 Carne Asada Tacos   I pulled window  guy took money think $8 50 proceeded wait good 5 minutes window  no problem waiting cause usually means its made when its ordered  Order came told guy want red green sauce jalapenos  He looked said very matter factly YES OK   kinda funny   So home thinking probably going some wimpy little tacos open box amazed huge size things! Loaded lots meat pico de gallo guacamole  tasted good looked definitely back  remember take picture next time  just wanted dig right in!! <EOR> Food decent but oh god does drive thru suck  No matter time they're very pleasant drive thru but its exceptionally bad early morning because sometimes stop breakfast burrito way work  guy works around time he does greet mic  wait 4 5 minutes say anything when he does he says Yeah? then tell want he just stays quiet  you're okaaayyy?? pull window he takes another 4 5 minutes come window doesn't give your total repeat your order nothing  Last time asked condiments told didn't any he looked annoyed even asking  If customer service more professional miserable looking sounding would given spot solid 4 stars  Fix your shit  <EOR> Horrible service friendly cashier  Also food greasy super sick   never eat again <EOR> Breakfast burritos euphoric! Regular burritos heavenly  Chips cheese dreamy  haven't single thing wasn't just looking if kind greasy deliciousness mood calls for   service pretty standard  Nothing complain about   Just would expect  <EOR> This place gets 2 stars cause food decent   biggest problem place never order right  always check order before leave but burritos always screw up  Can't really tell what's until take bite unroll burrito before leave restaurant   Maybe going back Robertos <EOR> Well asking nacho receiving cold nacho disappointed! gent insisted just cooked was  slightest trace melted cheese when cook nachos home cheese melts cheese cold hard top  Upon coming another couple sent meal back twice failed freshness <EOR> So always drove place bc thought it'd those Filibertos Humbertos something bertos  But turned surprisingly delicioso!!! BTW Flour tortillas r closest ones Mexico! <EOR> For fast Mexican food love Don Tor Taco over Roberto's  meals made order great portion size! current favorite dish Chili Verde pork   good!! effort time put into making dish isn't easy available everyday but when made better try before run out!! also Love chips cheese  chips made order!! only problem place spicy carrots mushy  don't them cooked way  <EOR> I recommend place   ordered menudo very disappointed   no flavor  added 3 slices lemon 1 cup salsa 2 small packs salt  then tasted bit better    friend ordered camarones la diabla   He described sauce tasting tomatoes sauce chile  looked watery me   Horchata good  come restaurant again  <EOR> Food great   Roberto's better   Definitely worth money better rolled tacos lot less  <EOR> One location wasn't open 24 hours even though said 24 7  location sign says Breakfast Burritos $2 99 until noon but cashier wouldn't honor it  Said until 11 pointed sign she said sign needs changed  <EOR> They rude  Kept change owed back need it  principal  Asked rice beans carnitas burrito gave cheese sour cream  done place gonna tell whole world! Lol  <EOR> Very authentic! received fast accurate orders  Only gave 4 stars because some menu items bit greasy but  real deal right? <EOR> Cheap delicious eats generous too   Ate rolled  cruncy 5 tacos $6  Also chicken enchiladas rice beans taco  mmm red sauce poured generously enchiliada  Salsa bar good portions  limes  <EOR> The food good although wish ground beef   store clean  normal fast food enviroment   TV spanish couldnt  understand much being said  staff real friendly engageing although stayed busy even though very few drive thru customers no walkins while there  I only dine customer whole time there   maybe timing     <EOR> Their rolled tacos burritos good  best but good consistent neighborhood drive through taco shop  guac more sour cream based guac but still good  little salsa bar inside green red salsas spicy carrots radishes  big plus they're open 24hrs  breakfast burritos huge delicious very filling  <EOR> 1st day open !! Fast great food!! Huge portions good w pricing  Free condiments  Drive thu also open 24hours <EOR> Food ok best  Service greatest she didn't even want take order  Lastly plate ordered sour cream item  no sour cream whatsoever also wanted charge $1 spoonful  Just good business  Plenty other places eat think so  <EOR> Really quick great food  drive thru took some time but because fresh! <EOR> I'm seriously disappointed service  food fine  mainly because drive thru but last two times made frustrated never eating again  All wanted bag hot carrots tacos  asked them speaker box window  lady forgot them first time  second time guy told pull around come them myself  Excuse but wtf? Why would drive thru through all if still car? If going car taking happy ass Roberto's next door where food better anyway  Bottom line convenience  If food better maybe service could overlooked  <EOR> I've regular Rainbow Blvd Location years   No more   only did prices but quality gone way down   just worst chimichanga ever had   Bland flavorless greasy because temperature fryer low   place looks filthier its ever      <EOR> Definitely rudest customer service you'll receive town  Slow always your order wrong  tried location multiple times always mess such simple order  somewhere else! <EOR> Love food  Basically obsessed it  Mexican sodas which awesome because allergic corn Mexican soda made real sugar  adobode off charts  <EOR> Awesome food  Piled high food  Quick fast service  never hard time ordering  never upset order  <EOR> They added Chicken Shrimp Fajitas Really good very fresh   Large portion enough 2 meals  eaten few times now everything very good  <EOR> WTF?  Today ordered phone pick because easiest us    Robertos     Maybe there's language barrier between lady taking order but really think should learn menu English before taking orders phone   maybe lost translation between lady took order person put order together   don't know!!  I ordered Carne Asada fries NO BEANS!!   plain Nachos cheese   First all Carne asada fries clearly beans   Omfg nachos joke   post pic refer that   tortilla chips looked just melted shredded cheddar cheese top   cheese really hard   Really???  Mexican restaurant no real nacho cheese?  melt shredded cheddar cheese which hardened time home     back Robertos go   waste space southern highlands  <EOR> If looking something fast good these's place also few block home clean tacos al Pastor great!!! <EOR> Failed update review  Took long attempting cook some 2 day old meat neglected cook  Cooked odd smell  hit me  smell meat carne asada fries night   neglected mention more importantly sick dog eating meat!! <EOR> Lady front no idea what's she's doing breakfast burritos sign say 2 99! She charged everyone 4 75  added red sauce charged 1 50 receipt said extra veggies!   food hugging porcelain God all day  <EOR> My boyfriend roommate last night around 1 2 am because boyfriend's roommate saw place way home wanted try out  Right when boyfriend roommate immediately started joking around name catchy was  inside only saw guy working  think he only handling everything such cashier drive thru cooking food etc  took while back order but really think i's because he only handling everything someone drive thru when there  Anyhow he back boyfriend ordered chicken chimichanga 10 minutes later came out  should've taken picture but delicious  different tortilla deep fried something believe  crunchy chicken soft moist  Really good food! The environment very friendly  walls painted bright green bright orange bright yellow which made much more welcoming  plus cold temperature perfect  It always cold Roberto's people working always giving looks didn't want didn't want there     though he seemed only worker he working late he still friendly us  We really place sure definitely back  <EOR> I would give place 4 stars because  food good is  But service horrible  Forget trying specific  order  I e  extra anything hold whatever  feel need speak  Spanish order when don't understand  act your fault  worth money time  <EOR> It's thing mess drive thru order but when customer calls let know rude  Very poor customer service  already wasn't favorite Mexican food  items greasy rice often dry  Definitely giving them business again  <EOR> This place right next house  use Roberts but no drive thru dons  favorite item place cheese quesadilla  <EOR> I've going place since day 1 opening  use great  past couple weeks become difficult coupons  offer coupons online but when bring store always excuse why won't take it  50% off any meal example  Last week said no good  sure why      clicked redeem coupon said good  refreshed page showed them EXACT coupon  Then accepted it   time coupon wouldn't load  sales rep behind counter took phone persistently clocked link over over over again  Causing link crash   If don't want accept coupons DON'T offer them!! <EOR> I always carne asada plate its really good  Food pretty much identical Robertos maybe slightly smaller portions  usually choose over Robertos because fast drive thru  No complaints decent Mexican food!   I can't believe someone said would choose Taco Bell over place    mean c'mon really? haha No thanks! <EOR> Don Tortaco authentic fast! giving five stars because open twenty four hours  location reminds several Sunset Blvd locations Beverly Hills Cali  <EOR> I really despise obliged rate establishment least star order write review  Anyways first rant    Second YELPERS BEWARE BUSINESS! ordered place couple times always drive thru  would mess order concur other reviews sassy lady drive thru window  But being cheap food didn't complain   Last night last straw last time going any Don Tortaco    Husband ordered paid lady $30 25  total actually $21 25 but he only $20 bill $10 bill he gave cashier 25 cents change would just bills  Handed said lady cash quarter she closed door  course husband waited stared her  He also noticed cashier DID put money drawer but off side  he waited then cashier opened window asked if he needed anything else  Husband responds yeah need change $9  SHe then proceeded state he shouldn't any change because according he gave exact amount  Again husband said no gave $30 25 need $9 change  Cashier again said tried argue husband until she called someone person then counted money gave change husband    Okay when people give more total then give change kinda tricky isn't it? But you're cashier pretty sure your job count money you're receiving then PUT YOUR DRAWER set aside  only imagine many customers person done to  People tend just grab food heck don't even count change times    Again NEVER going back  your s*IT together  <EOR> We usually love place! However most recent very upsetting  through drive thru man speaker asked want  gave first item which nachos  He said drive turned off microphone  pulled window told girl wanted order more he came around corner said very rudely  want told paid  home began eating taquitos  Toward end husband noticed chicken smelled tasted extremely sour! smell just bad taste  ended going back letting them know clearly old rotten  He said if can't give back entire order he would refund us  He told come back Roberto's now on  <EOR> They take long ass time charge sides when inside store free  only come hangover food when don't mind crappy service  <EOR> Called place catering order     guys answered said trays come two sizes     asked he said he didn't know he didn't time explain he busy!  Wow! Guess don't want business! never BOTHER them again! <EOR> I'm giving because customer service sucks don't serve food good quality  employees friendliest give off energy being annoyed every time there  Whenever order burrito very loose tightly wrapped  also order chips cheese tend burn point even styrofoam melts  close home 24 hours  why Don Tortaco  wish would improve quality food customer service  <EOR> Whoever guy worked drive thru window TONIGHT location needs fired  Worst customer service EVER  First off he sounded he hated job just he spoke through speakers  asked  6 rolled tacos sour cream guac cheese  He gave 3 without sour cream  didn't realize such complicated order rolls eyes   guy even repeated order STILL wrong  He grabbed payment shut window fast didn't chance let know he forgot sour cream  Then he completely ignored sat car hoping attention    This isn't first time happened SAME a hole  Take your money couple buildings down same complex Robertos!! actually treat paying customer food MUCH tastier anyways  <EOR> Just through drive thru breakfast burrito dude took order couldn't more miserable job  want  drive  4 71 threw burrito lol!!!! Damn son    Awful personal skills customer service   won't back <EOR> Food pretty good service horrible   won't coming back place again   asked cup water drive thru told no   cost something just no  would paid small amount   service sure closed soon   Don't waste your time place where your business wanted  <EOR> Like other Yelpers reviewed before pretty much replica Robertos  Same options same flavor same prices only difference drive thru  Small salsa bar inside too  ordered #4 two cheese enchiladas flavor severely lacking!!! But carne asada burrito delicious also torta which ok to  Open 24 7 <EOR> *Breakfast burrito w bacon sausage   *Bean cheese burrito   *Three rolled tacos w guacamole cheese   I order three things any given Don Tortaco around town usually when I'm drunk way home when wake feeling death drinking night before  something special particular location though  Maybe fact they're always consistent close house made super yummy green chili salsa salsa bar haven't ever seen any other location  way love place    My only gripe would employees aren't most friendly  But drive through access allows over look that  lol <EOR> Came just try but then food just blew away! service way better then Roberto's workers actually serve smile! drive through really convenient  Awesome experience overall would defiantly come back again! <EOR> It's house thought better McDonald's well no drive thru line ok order all wrong when home noticed quesadilla ordered chicken did chicken called no answered hour husband drive back over restaurant <EOR> Cheap but even bit authentic  You taste greed whatever corporation owns tasteless chain  Any buffet any casino slopes better grinds generic spot  Compared place Roberto's tastes president Mexico's own grandmothers handmade recipes!
