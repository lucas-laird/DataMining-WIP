Service good attentive staff seemed knowledgeable     A few errors wine menu stating California wines being Washington state gave pause attention detail actual wine knowledge considering they're naming themselves wine region Napa! When mention way he seemed confused kind blew off   The food just OK nowhere near quality steakhouse prices   brussels sprouts way overcooked mushy!  Felt vegetables sitting pot hours something freshly prepared dinner   The veal chop ordered overcooked requested medium rare which waiter recommended chefs recommendation  But chop received more well done edges being dry hard Center edible but still over done   $60 veal chop expected significantly better preparation   Overall very forgettable dinner if used dining good steakhouse would skip  If used dining Bonanza step up  <EOR> It nice surprise find restaurant inside Tropicana Hotel  husband prime rib sea bass key lime pie dessert  Everything excellent  staff extremely attentive  Give place try if you're area  wish taken picture  <EOR> Went lunch Saturday turkey burger which loved   Nice ambience  Service friendly  Food came quick  Definitely back lunch when Vegas  <EOR> This place serious hidden gem!
