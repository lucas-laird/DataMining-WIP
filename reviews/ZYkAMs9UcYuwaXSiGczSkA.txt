Disgustingly filthy  Every table dirty  saw food preparer sneeze into hand then continued prepare food without washing hands  <EOR> Two days ago forgot egg sausage egg mc muffin today no maple syrup hot cakes  why you're worth 15 00 hour  <EOR> Ran through drive thru today way work much advertised Egg White Delight McMuffin    250 calories 7 grams fat! versus regular Egg McMuffin 300 calories 12 grams fat Oh hells yes!   am HUGE fan Egg McMuffin excited try one   If only McDonalds would serve breakfast sandwiches all time just morning whole darn world would brighter!  Sigh!  think need start petition!  Anyways back sandwich   egg fluffy light airy   Totally expected but hugely amazed good was   wasn't dry thought would be   cheese white cheese versus American cheese Egg McMuffin   didn't notice much different   Overall Egg White Delight probably better Egg McMuffin   Ooops shhhhh did just say that?    The service alright   Nothing crazy but drive thru   long everything comes ordered all good right?  only complaint which always complaint Micky D's never put very much ice drinks   Why that?  SMH <EOR> Only 2 stars because wait!  inside ended waiting 20 fucking minutes order    insane!

Even complaints management improve things  Also careful if your order more person per car  Then really confused here! <EOR> Just thru drive through  Whoever taking order making jokes  Saying all foods wrong  confusing  Then when pulled window food 2 employers texting  Looked me  Then continued text  don't care if mcdonalds  very unprofessional rude  Put your phone away working  <EOR> Alway great service  daughter left purse 3 days ago still it  Thank all employees being honest  <EOR> Couldn't more difficult work McDonalds guess     made wait 10 minutes reserved parking spot forgot sauce nuggets cold      <EOR> I hadn't eaten anything  McDonald's other desserts years  Finally getting buy free new fresh never frozen quarter pounder thought I'd try son  surprise actually really good! frys still bit salty but burger great plus fact all sized soft drinks only $1 even better! if haven't McDonald's while come back try new fresh Burgers they're good  <EOR> I came Sunday morning kids impressed place  inside more modern very clean  early weren't busy food promptly accurate  stood most young man name might getting wrong Chauncey  He polite greeting way checking table other tables asking if everything good if needed something  never happened McDonalds before  He kept busy sweeping floors wiping down tables  just impressed courteous hard work  forgot mention gone order another round pancakes bottomless pit son  They're weren't busy delivered food instead just calling number  Did mention impressed? <EOR> Over past few months consumption McDonald's food markedly increased thanks increase cycling mileage   mean really when else acceptable nay even expected replenish lost salts calories via Mickey D's?  Thus feelings towards McD's may skewed more positive most yelpers   When dropped into McDonald's quick lunch break during bike ride famished heartily devoured hot cheeseburger fresh fries approximately 2 seconds   inhaling lunch noticed place clean quick visit loo restroom clean well   Staff seemed pleasant enough both husband's order mine correct although should really given    McD's always glad see golden arches when riding bicycle! <EOR> I typically don't reviews fast food restaurants because assume them hit miss  When becomes more misses hits problem  issues getting mcChicken patties when order cheese burger forgetting sauces something through drive through  time no CO2 soda machine  did tell anyone upfront proactive said if don't want Powerade water give your money back  worked fast food before if don't something borrow it!
