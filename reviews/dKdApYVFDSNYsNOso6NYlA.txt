It's really bad when know your own breath stinks! <EOR> Long long lines during night  Basic white castle meals perfect hangovers  <EOR> Fixed crave   4 double cheese slider jalapeno cheese sub order chicken rings   sauces good sliders best ever had   wish white castle cali   <EOR> They order completely wrong   Manager rude when asked correct it   She wanted receipt    did she think bought them another White Castle? Burgers disgusting   Customers being skipped because burgers sitting counter behind employee  My advice   go McDonalds if need fast burger strip  <EOR> GARBAGE!  day drinking gambling wanted quick bite before bed saw White Castle right hotel   Looking forward trying all people rave its all even that   burgers flavorless except pickle whatever onions used gave severe heartburn all night next day   three days later stomach still hates eating them almost $10 sliders fries could real burger   Save your money spend few extra dollars somewhere else just tourist trap  <EOR> Definitely love sliders  prices very reasonable  also loaded fried which bomb don't even really know but good  only gave 4 stars because when ordered forgot give chicken rings already late back them because far sucked  But other great food  open 24 hours good when just club lol <EOR> My first time ever trying White Castle waaay back high school straight frozen section  finally real thing Chicago pretty damn good especially price  how's White Castle Vegas?   Nothing special sadly  just something missing  only prices higher quality definitely off  Where took time Chicago putting sliders together things rushed kitchen location  sliders made hate taste it  cheese unmelted burgers smashed into its containers flavors sorely lacking  Where caramelized onion flavor white castle known for? thought establishment sold within hours its grand opening would present something better cafeteria food  <EOR> One word overrated!   This place even same ballpark some great burger joints! Came high expectations due to 1 Everyone ranting raving great burgers are 2 renowned reputation East Coast 3 made movie amazing is!   Always wanted try watching Harold Kumar naturally when chance dig into pack amazing burgers during last trip Vegas could not???   Although service great staff worked hard fast restaurant constantly being cleaned thus 3 stars burgers just OK left something desired  mini burgers paper thin meat could hardly taste bread somewhat soggy due pickles onions  huge let down when took first bite  immediately regretted being overly excited buying whole pack mediocre burgers! husband didn't through pack burgers ended throwing them away knowing weren't going eat them later    Huge disappointment! <EOR> Don't wrong  steamy little cheeseburger sliders good but didn't satisfy curiosity way thought would  taste just microwaveable sliders grocery store much happier just getting those  Fries nothing great  Remind Del Taco fries  I'd come back quick fix but proud say take west coast In n Out over east coast White Castle any day!! <EOR> This good gets late night noshing  don't look great location small weird right inside gross Casino Royale everyone inside plastered just doesn't matter  When your number called those little boxes heaven handed over all pain world away most amazing flavor deliciousness all matters   I suggest getting doubles double meat double cheese double fun! just prefer extra meat gooey cheese bun ratio better singles  also prefer jalapeno cheeseburgers regular ones  spicy jalapeno flavor all just little kick let know there  Just added bonus little spice   There's much more say  If you're looking gourmet burger it  But if late you've lost some money tables just want something delicious chomp place  lines long but cares?

We 8 sliders coke onion chips 6 chicken rings $20 94  food hot prompt delicious    The staff friendly lady taking order actually suggested bundle some stuff into meal save money    Go solid cheeseburger cheap price  M <EOR> I'm confused  Why would choose place over all other places Vegas? terrible  try because movie west coast chance but lesson learned  Never coming back  Flavorless  Worst fries ever  Mystery meat? Why line long? Welcome stinktown  <EOR> Good ol' comfort food    I love White Castle but love Krystal better!   A bit hard to    staff wonderful  If White Castle considered branching I'd love them even better  <EOR> Okay    it's White Castle   isn't gourmet burger joint   mind great experience!  loved each mini cheeseburger sliced pickle chopped onions it   didn't give 5 stars fries definitely needed some fresh oil some TLC   bit brown sad fries I'd recommend going onion chips like pieces crispy onion rings    If haven't gone just need to! <EOR> Came first time club  interested going place watched itsjudytime's Youtuber husband Benji raved when Judy came Vegas   To honest worth hype  People say place pretty bomb since East Coast branch but all right   The portion super small def some more items if you're hungry  I regular sandwich buns sausage link pattie loaded fries  loaded fries tasted much better because nacho cheese sauce bacon    Other if you're into trying something new  But would pass!

Enjoy signature steamed square burger sliders strongly flavored chopped white onion  particularly liked fish slider which thought cut above McDonald's Filet O Fish  crinkle fries okay  'Try crunchy onion bits  Although isn't fancy White Castle sliders hit spot when need bite when tight budget  <EOR> This might sound silly some but never White Castle always wanted but somehow all trips across country always missed going one  Finally made Las Vegas late night snack good  Simple yet good  Nothing else really tastes it  Just if Vegas CA its nearest west coast guess  <EOR> Having dubbed 'gut bombers' friends Midwest should known better dive straight into pits hell   Unfortunately term still holds true despite being side country!  Engorged 3 sliders things began downhill there   I'd keep review clean possible look reviews Amazon regarding sugar free Haribo gummy bears give better idea actually down   If your first time consider yourself warned eat your own risk!

Walked ordered less 2 minutes food served 5 minutes that   Employees friendly obviously over whelmed onslaught customer pouring all day   impressed positive  certainly experience White Castles past   crew bantering each other making positive vibe which nice especially if you've getting down casinos   I'd say enjoy multitude employees working anticipation crowds because when slow its still fresh super fast   There's couple workers constantly cleaning place well kept clean   Another nice change based past experiences chain else where   The set view strip looking deceiving   While may look there's large crowd could just people eating food standing around   dining area toward strip ordering area inward   I'd say good rule if see line extending doors then ok long line   Else should check inside cause line may long   We 20 originals 2 fries combo $28   Just over buck each which standard   could gouge but glad see didn't     We eaten many times having without being mid west treat indeed    little suckers simple tasty   Soft bun slim patty grilled onions garlic esk seasoning em tasty   pretty much melt your mouth which love   Swallow em whole say I can't btw !

I really don't think back White Castle anytime soon possible craving could hit when see because unique taste but even then likely just grab slider eat way wherever else going eat  <EOR> Got em hot fresh off grill!

If want able say you've tried spot you  <EOR> This probably deserves 4 star rating given most people's expectations let clarify before into review no real qualms place besides price  burgers nearly good those Midwest   So GOOD Burgers nearly good Midwest give many ketchup packets want you probably need ask if want any all place seemed clean enough during busy night around 1 morning wait wasn't bad ordering line pickup line  The BAD main thing price  shouldn't more dollar per burger obviously buying more burgers should give some sort deal  But as April 2016 $35 99 crave case 30 plain sliders which almost exact same price 30 individual sliders  Likewise costs 30 cents add cheese slider  If add cheese all 30 sliders might expect some deal  Nope  30 cents times 30 slices cheese 9 dollars which exact amount you'll add your price if want 30 sliders cheese instead regular sliders  means you're paying $44 99 30 tiny sliders   and  before taxes   Look know Vegas strip don't really mind price much  Everything's more expensive constant stream customers proves they're asking fair market price  Still taking away star because  just way much money those tiny burgers  costs same amount 30 tiny sliders 30 full size McDoubles  burgers aren't quite good Midwest  They're still good  they'll satisfy if you're White Castle fan myself  but they're just slightly lacking  think problem use large island grill where something 4 people work once open setup results steam escaping  those don't know part magic White Castle burgers cooked steaming them over bed onions  onion flavor permeates entire burger bun  But Vegas location setup think steam doesn't job  Which also results less moist buns   But don't let sway going here  Still very good  staff wasn't all friendly  rude  When asked ketchup guy gave plenty ketchup but didn't even look he serving me  people grill looked bit miserable   understandable given probably spend day making millions sliders non stop because hugely busy location  girl taking orders neither friendly nor unfriendly  menu bit poorly done  cheese options instance listed footnote top are those still called footnotes? where mentions add cheese jalapeno cheese  those unfamiliar White Castle menu they'll probably just miss option entirely  WAY end strip that part furthest 15 freeway   far Trump Hotel but past Venetian  if you're down near Excalibur even Cosmopolitan you've long walk ahead you  Might better drive closer hotel walk  Harrah's parking free easy access off strip not sure other hotels  your own research    SUMMARY Go here  good   So why low rating? taking off two stars because 1 price 2 having service taste lives Midwest experience  But still quite good  just can't justify mathematically giving 5 stars because 5 stars would standard White Castle experience which misses  But going still awesome   PRO TIP White Castles excellent breakfast food  Let them sit overnight  keep burger cases overlapping trap moisture in!  then let them sit overnight enjoy next day   Always consume ketchup   HELPFUL INFO uninitiated White Castle sliders tiny come standard chopped slightly grilled onion pickle  No mustard ketchup  ask ketchup packets if want but easier bring your own bottle don't spend your meal opening squeezing 30 packets   For guys young appetite could easily consume 10 sliders  Something 6 might enough you   Women girls lesser appetites might satisfied 2 4 sliders   Don't forget try other stuff jalapeno cheese onion rings etc  all good stuff  <EOR> Was just remembered growing join Midwest but bread soggy prices lot hugger  Michigan current price $4 99 number one  $7 99  know located strip but looking forward coming affordable meal    Also employees could least smile! smile very long way!

Mini sliders grilled onions can't wrong portable cute easy eat especially reminds childhood  burgers taste remember don't bad job Vegas location but consistency questionable  second visit sliders all soggy liking which good good all   I actually prefer original sliders over cheese slider since cheese overwhelms flavor grilled onions much love love LOVE flavor grilled onions  Sometimes would try ask them extra grilled onions most time am unsuccessful but worth try    We also dabbled cheese fries ranch bacon crew thought pretty tasty but think crinkle cut fries need major work typically taste stale  really ranch sauce dip sliders time time  Also pass onion chips batter dense great  shakes simple vanilla chocolate nothing crazy but its bad either  don't think offer strawberry shake location since would all over that  Oh yeah brownies cheesecake stick just thought I'd let know    I typically eat 5 sliders good day filling! normal person think 3 4 sliders just right  overzealous types also offer crave cases  crates range anywhere 30 50 100!

Place Awesome! staff friendly  definitely must visit whenever come Vegas  new must place family  actually waited line two different days  <EOR> I waiting over 25 years try White Castle burger restaurant  don't know if Las Vegas location does brand justice might talking crazy but actually prefer microwave burgers grocery store    The burgers restuarant much greasier inconsistent one burgers came pickles other did not somehow lacked flavor compared its microwave counterpart  also tried chicken rings just your average chicken nugget  don't know if just western state thing but did offer jalapeno cheese which plus  size burgers certainly overpriced but guess  nothing new   Because Vegas beer tap but cheap variety  But then again fast food all  eventually give brand another chance mid west  <EOR> I've always wanted try place BC people always says good  Well right  love fish chicken breast burgers  <EOR> I finally try hype machine meh right!  I've wanting check White Castle ever since saw first Harold Kumar movie  recent visit its clear stoned your mind enjoy place   Located decrepit Casino Royale White Castle probably main reason people even step inside place  WC takes pretty big amount real estate casino but don't expect find seating quick service  Being only Castle West Coast means place packed lines long service poor its rare see people fighting over seat dining area  If must come parking Harrahs next door Mirage across street should sufficiently close   The food understanding essentially same East Coast counter parts plus few bucks cause eating Strip  tiny sliders come paper thin slice beef few grilled onions soggy bun due grease  crinkle cut fries found many other mediocre fast food spots  Skip chicken rings buy some frozen nuggets Costco thank later  food definitely over priced four slider combo cheese runs $9  Service abysmal place mess   While waiting line party front talking grew White Castle New York excited finally eat again  guess nostalgia must only way really appreciate White Castle  Oh maybe smoking bunch weed  <EOR> I really don't whole hype place  mean bit different way serve burgers but felt couldn't really enjoy entirely because serve them bite size pattys    I hoping would felt meal but honestly felt mid day snack before lunch  Fries good but don't think coming back try again  Unless someone convince must try item menu  stick regular n out  Service horrible  thing did bug when order called  friend already heading pick lady begins speak Mic  Number ??? find your number if  looked your receipt bottom part it  mean she said attitude if didn't know there  unnecessary uncalled for  <EOR> I finally made white castle  Being able eat burger childhood fresh rather frozen dream  scary close taste though  Nothing beats fresh slider  Especially jalapeño cheese  Total game changer  Glad continue eat white castle whenever can  <EOR> My fiance really wanted did  He saw movie just try it  all know which movie is  feels burgers came microwave Californian missing freshness  place clean great customer service but other your friendly neighborhood fast food joint  <EOR> White Castle finally came west coast but certainly best coast  Everyone curious White Castle offer  All before microwaveable burgers certainly cannot match restaurant's quality burgers right?

N instead   actually enjoyed food although always prefer N Out   see why people say need grow stoned enjoy it   downed few drinks beforehand but think would still enjoy food sober  <EOR> Finally decided try White Castle strip  sure lot people standing around doing nothing shift  There's 20 employees behind counter together yet maybe only five actually working  No wonder line  door because busy but because employees standing around aimlessly chit chatting instead working  Hmmmm lot unhappy customers line  <EOR> I actually expecting something    more exciting    My friends ordered sliders   tasted pretty okay  soft texture bun thin patty diced onions reminded little hamburgers Happy Meals McDonalds  presentation cool all little boxes but other there's really nothing special them    And way hard find somewhere sit messy area is   just kills appeal some more me  <EOR> White Castle Vegas strip next Harrah's ok ok place big fan White Castle but when you're hungry tastes better lol  small area but pretty fast  much places sit down especially when crowded  Prices pretty high but expect Las Vegas Strip where raise prices up  think once experience good enough stick Lobster D'Amores Pizza PH Secret Pizza Cosmo fast lunch  <EOR> It's even more amazing expected!! buns soft! whole thought frozen ones pretty good  unexpected amazing! just walking down strip ran into White Castle! thought dreaming!! good!!! <EOR> Can't wrong burgers  $11 gets enough feed couple people  service quick friendly! <EOR> I ordered combinations let start saying food mush small buns nasty  the sad part really excited try food! <EOR> First time last time try this  yall heard bubble guts??

Food good customer service good  time its completely different  Burns gross fries horrible nasty customer service sent fries back only back talk employees!! Who does that!!! guessing poor management blame? sure  only thing good sliders! <EOR> 1st time white castle sliders    woo hoo!  very delicious!  cheap yummy fast strip!  fries which salty chicken rings ! open canada ya!? <EOR> If want racially profiled eat shitty food come eat White Castle because  get  Employees assholes hate jobs <EOR> In California don't White Castle am aware of  know available Freezer Section some grocery stores  Every once while buy them When mood 'real' White Castle Burger two place spot! <EOR> This place great  only customer service excellent but didn't wait food long time  First time having sliders great  Perfect size  didn't feel overly stuffed  chocolate dipped cheesecake very good  Small but perfect satisfy sweet tooth craving  Definitely going back every time Vegas!!! <EOR> Listen folks    White Castle everyone   If you're curious little cooked order sliders just try two most  definitely don't recommend full meal   Vegas location means Vegas prices  may worth you  Now all lovers fans tasty little spot      prepared greatness! Its always super busy which assurance everything fresh hot ready go  ppl great system out  even see them cooked burgers grill onions steam buns while placing your order    but must warn you   be prepared pay Vegas prices  Hope helps! <EOR> This isn't best anything far but better fast food typical chains 24 7! if your fan movie Harold Kumar then must try place once cause those frozen ones buy grocery store fake don't give White Castle anyway justice    I ordered combo   *Sliders cheese Without cheese slider would suck cheese good def must   *Fries Crinkle cut very lacking  Easy pass next time  *Onion Fries Your combo much better if substitute these  lot better    I would probably recommend skipping combos getting sack  Because 4 sliders aren't really enough  Anyways White Castle isn't anything special but appealing 4 5 AM if don't want Hash House Earls    The service any fast food joint  asked ranch lady said she back some  waited 5 minutes she didn't move all  She easiest job handing sauces she couldn't even smh  <EOR> I visited location last weekend  store impeccably clean  staff nice moving quickly  food? Amazing  Yes ate whole takehomeasack Great city 24 hours day Slider heaven  back! <EOR> OK let's calm down people  just White Castle  really something excited about?  If happen area want try first time guest  would skip fries if you  onion chips much better bet   Sorry vegetarians but no veggie sliders here  Rise heard! Tip they're made Dr  Praeger's they're available fine grocery stores everywhere  No matter eat don't eat probably dozens better options could walk here  The Crave Powerful Thing ? Well then guess doesn't matter tell you   Bon appétit  <EOR> Oh White Castle! Even though never watched Harold Kumar movie before heard sliders White Castle couldn't wait try one  Luckily fast food restaurant open 24 7 night clubbing friend headed over place quick meal  definitely no lines Tuesday morning around 4am quickly ordered original slider $1 29 chicken ring slider $1 99 try  cashier proudly told he 15 chicken rings lunch when seemed hesitant trying chicken ring slider  definitely hungry enough 15 chicken sliders but boo  However props cashier working 4am shift!   When received sliders quite surprised tiny sliders looked  size palms pretty sure eat slider bite if tried hard enough  Taste wise both okay  mind blowing don't see myself craving sliders future  actually tasted bit plain since no special sauce included beef chicken slider  guess good place grab quick bite if budget since prices more reasonable other restaurants strip  can't say won't ever back but probably near future  <EOR> Not long line did move pretty quickly  All fountain drinks beer taps needed cleaned bugs flying all around  ordered number two which came fries drink four cheeseburger sliders pickle  also tried mozzarella cheese sticks which good  burger patty size itself super thin but bread good  <EOR> White Castle place where should definitely try Las Vegas  sliders pretty good even though tastes Mcdonald's cheeseburgers  ordered 30 bring back San Jose comes case carry it  convenient     The sliders small if you're extremely hungry 1 would definitely fill up  <EOR> Ok ok    so know major hating White Castle first review   well give 3 stars time around!  Came Fat Tuesday some drinks Linq  Ordered 10 mini burgs cheese large fries cheesecake cheese sticks   It cool  mean $20 cool   Burgers hot fresh bite sized   Cheesecake REALLY small being cheesecake on stick!    I think plus funny cashiers 10% OFF LOCALS!!!!!!!! <EOR> So kids enjoy those famous cheeseburger slider White Castle found frozen food section your local grocery store   So getting them fresh off grill must even better   Before only way White Castle restaurant driving Midwest which closes restaurant Southern California     But now Las Vegas opened two them strip downtown Vegas   visiting real life White Castle restaurant now reality   So spent weekend Vegas visited located strip   Typical fastfood atmosphere casino right next door   Between four ate 30 cheeseburgers half dozen chicken sandwiches half dozen fish sandwiches   Also order french fries onion chips   Fries just OK but onion chips actually really really good   At begining heaven eating them fresh much better microwave version   But long story short many sandwiches don't think we'll eat another White Castle cheesburger long long long time   think having nightmares those sliders attacking me   So all all great little burger just take slow easy  <EOR> The worst burger ever life  sogginess burger meat bottom bun repulsive  never again  <EOR> Absolute trash  heard many stories friends why must try White Castle burgers sure enough went  1 AM starving dropped some burgers  Given starving heard such great things place very excited   Little did know place literally worst burger joint ever gone too  burgers look frozen then simply just microwaved  would NEVER come back again would advise everyone stay away  <EOR> I always wanted try place because movie  disappointing  taste little burgers  staff very friendly unlike other burger joints  <EOR> I never heard White Castle till watched Harold Kumar  never dawned till seen while Vegas  line gets really long which normal Strip   small portions few   kinda pricey but thought really good  would choose White Castle over Innout any day now   <EOR> It took way long strip White Castle but Im glad came   stopped typical White Castle dining time 3 am packed almost left but did pretty good job getting food quickly well worth wait    It expensive though know its strip but its still White Castle come on! <EOR> Vegas Valentine's Day Adventure!

Keep mind sober all night  Definitely worth trip  <EOR> This first time going White Castle never tried originals mid west anywhere else chain located  sure why such low reviews but fan delicious me   The sliders small  see why meal offers set 4 sliders compared just getting one  wasn't bad liked bread fresh everything freshly made  also liked fresh onions too  pretty cool could see kitchen register particular location everything made fresh watch being made    No complaints service either  Even if its just fast food chain staff friendly working fast could since huge line people waiting food  Overall everything tasted great came timely manner     Yelp 2017 Review Challenge 91 100 <EOR> Except Curiosity factor place satisfying  white castle past east coast quick very inexpensive good snack  Worth if looking quantity rather quality  However place none that!!! Service slow Burgers 3 4 times price east coast place mess No ice machine quality much worse  guess should lucky only white castle west coast but really need lower prices increase quality some Big Red soda machines  <EOR> Good burgers reasonable price    Eat save money while strip! <EOR> First time trying place tbh just ok  he cheese slider double  When came looked kinda gross tbh  wasn't very appetizing but tasted just alright  sure if would come back  <EOR> Good Mini burger lots fresh onions can't enough burgers yummy can't wait back tell all people California <EOR> Been drinking playing all day night   quick need food stat! White castle quick food just may need  grease line your stomach cure hangover  While white castle isn't best food Vegas cheap quick gets job done  Good fast food would visit place again  staff took order food door can't really ask more  <EOR> Highly disappointed  eating frozen white castle burgers ever since kid super excited finally try unfrozen  still liked however tastes exactly same frozen ones  Next time gonna drive walk extra miles shake shack because those burgers 10x better! <EOR> Finally finally restaurant Harold Kumar having through numerous obstacles just eat there  But luckily didn't need through Obstacles Harold Kumar needs through lol  But did 3 am there's still 20 mins wait pretty impressive Opinion  Well think white castle slider alrite nothing special crazy fish white castle pretty good say  But honestly rather Mcdonald burger N burger White Castle fact price pretty similar  <EOR> This place unexpectedly good!!!  Southern California girl only ever eaten things frozen pretty low expectations   But wow!  warm fresh just good!  onion fries also nice surprise   forgot order chocolate dipped cheesecake which bummer   Next time!!  If never recommend ordering few extra burgers  down easy ate three them no problem!  Perfect snack day drinking!  Down side line long but seems Vegas thing anywhere go!  back  <EOR> Well finally made White Castle   doesn't try anything more    basically 24 hour food joint strip should be   noted came right having Filet Mignon Mon Ami Gabi really came lower expectations   I cheeseburgers Castle Combo No  2 which 4 cheeseburgers fries drink http bit ly 1d7fHzH    describe little cheeseburgers two words Salt Bombs!  little suckers pretty damn salty    think every bite just keep going soda soak all up   Despite saltiness cheeseburgers weren't bad!  But might because some alcohol beforehand   definitely better getting them frozen ones supermarket   just under $10 combo decent   Luckily when arrived White Castle around 10 30pm wasn't line order   experience pretty quick should be   But when walked around midnight place super packed glad just late night munchie rush   Amazing!  Despite novelty don't know if I'd come back White Castle again   If want burger Strip late night plenty other options around same price range  <EOR> Don't believe hype! LOL If you're looking fast drunk fix then all means enjoy bad boys    Pros Super soft bread full cheese  Cons meat similar Mc Donalds just overwhelming dehydrated onion flavor     I also ordered fried onion peels which tad old breading crispy   fav    Overall suggest spending 10 bux give them try might them! me   FATBURGER life! LOL <EOR> OK White Castle virgin   know know but truth  Listen Vegas experience White Castle apparently  Silly Saturday night strip but friends NYC insisted  Wait outside line people walking past asking line for? resist answering Hookers Blow  Then wait line inside folks SERIOUS line include security guards direct traffic   Our troop deep orders suitcase burgers a flippin suitcase burgers 2 onion rings more onion chunks better rings 1 fry  no idea am but am ready mean food burgers fries hello   Yes lord! tasty burger! don't care pickles toss em but burger itself damn good   4 bites watching table mates apparently never eat public where glean information burger no more  I back someday   strip avoid strip many reasons list  However White Castle good lure might sooner rather later  TIP Order more think eat don't want back line! <EOR> The service pretty quick  ordered 20 pack 2 fries  bottom buns soggy    otherwise burgers pretty good  Would come again if area  <EOR> Looking pictures wall deceiving portion size chili fries let down   I am sure tasted mozzarella cheese sticks other restaraunts no originality there    The hamburger patties paper thin best   I only gave two stars because kids would love place  Alas town Aunt  <EOR> Friday night 3 30 AM girlfriend needs food STAT!   Off coming club heard good mystical 24 7 White Castle seeing Harold Kumar wanted in  took orders other guests hotel stood line seemed forever  restaurant itself crowded packed people rather dirty trash slider containers still chairs tables  line started towards back end register displayed crowd people looking menu waiting food line order   After 25 minute wait ordered two #2 combos slider suitcase  Worth it  food great but hit spot assume taste most if all White Castles    Could better complaining worst end but good enough three morning! <EOR> Boyfriend sick 2 days  stomach still right eating 2 weeks issues  am finally feeling better but wow never crave place ever again  <EOR> It's 2   because didn't spit LOL   good start right? your mouth water? also gets 2 instead 1 because very organized  line looked really long but only line 10 15 minutes then took maybe another 5 actual food   So here's deal  husband lived So Cal all lives even though always heard White Castle   the East Coast version n never gotten try it  SUPER excited when randomly saw Vegas stop try it! Yay!  We seen frozen ones Ralphs years but didn't ever want ruin first experience when did eventually try real thing    in hindsight feel frozen ones might actually better!  We weren't very hungry just ordered 2 cheese sliders 1 double cheese slider no onions me  PROTIP Yes order individually even though aren't menu way   We lucky enough instantly find table it packed sat down dug in  Upon first bite both looked each other WTF look faces  waited years try this? Avoided frozen version? Waited line  Ew   The buns soggy wet meat gray  good combination  said didn't spit them guess gets 2 star but OMG pretty close terrible    This all hype about? admit think they're cute those little boxes but compliments pretty much end there    I think figured though   you must high riding white tigers Harold Kumar able say enjoyed those things   Thanks but no thanks White Castle   ew   In N win    West Coast 4eva! <EOR> I'm back east having White Castle around heaven  Great burgers just wish more seating  <EOR> Wow worst thing ever had  hamburger quite sure but terrible  would rather eat jack box  saying much  sure why people keep telling place good  <EOR> I've heard White Castles East Coast tastes lot better sure hope  case because sliders gotten past weekend good  lines 20 minutes long sliders similar ones frozen food section    Pretty disappointed place but already expected it  sliders looked just slapped together  only thing liked came mini boxes  meat small mysterious  picked bag hot cheetos put sliders cover taste worked    I Combo #2 $8 99 which includes 4 cheese sliders fries soda  Next time pass this    Overall come back location  would give White Castle another try but East Coast  <EOR> As far first White Castle experience goes   I don't remember much it  conveniently located strip catch all intoxicated folk walking by    It pretty decent food but wasn't expecting sliders hold thin sandwich meat instead actual patty  Also fries bit crispy liking   On other hand service pretty quick can't complain ate leaving club  I full end night  really all matters end kind night  <EOR> When saw White Castle only 2 5 stars naawww can't but guess what truly deserves   Being New Jersey pretty much grew eating White Castle  Ever since moved 2005 always complained no White Castle frozen ones don't taste same  But holy shit would actually prefer frozen one's over fresh ones  just insanely disappointed   My husband never White Castle life he really wanted randomly 3AM  inside Best Western casino hotel which just really random place first place  actually didn't wanna try White Castle Vegas because already feeling wasn't going live name does East Coast right   We ordered 4 cheese sliders share fries drink  Order came quickly course hubby couldn't wait try it  sliders warm cheese barely melted which means most likely just sitting while  let cuz haven't fresh White Castle forever just hungry fuck  All good until hubby bit into second slider then started making weird ass noise faces until looked burger saw freaking curly ass strand hair slider  FUCK THAT  Instantly stomach just churned just felt stomach ache  sure if hadn't seen piece hair would've fine but just ruined White Castle at least Vegas   He brought cashier hair still intact shit gave 2 double cheese sliders  Nice cashier but still didn't shitty felt eating there  What's sad overheard other people saying much place sucks So came conclusion never going waste drive Strip again if want White Castle just Smith's frozen ones  Seriously you're probably better off driving down dealing all tourist drunk people   It's cool Vegas trying expand all popular foods other states but seriously think White Castle belongs only East Coast  still love White Castle though but just location  Maybe should consider making location away Strip! <EOR> Tried White Castle first time last night  disappointed say fan it  overrated bland  only ate because friends  can't believe wasted money some gross food  <EOR> So wanting try real White Castle very long time since California does it  Finally Vegas it! thoughts well taste just ones local grocery store back home  burger soggy meat cheese melts soggy bread   expected more but failed   It's ok eat mediocre fast food guess  <EOR> I line long but quick   food hot good  haven't White Castle years since California  loved bottoms beer   cool that   must try sure   <EOR> White Castle located inside Casino Royal  Came visit Los Angles saw White Castle strip  Naturally stoned came grub   burgers tasted just frozen ones buy store  Nothing extra nothing special  experience good woman attended cheerful cool over all     I'd come back again why not  <EOR> When frozen burgers better restaurant burgers big problem  Just  No  sure Midwest locations might slightly better  <EOR> It's exactly expected  worth 4 stars having fly east fresh sliders   Price little higher normal wish jalapeno cheese burger  Still happy they're here  <EOR> With all money spent building WC  Vegas Vegas tax prices you'd think they'd bother use proper mustard Dusseldorf instead generic yellow  sliders simply authentic  <EOR> We just because Harold Kumar movie  worth hype  service okay but price definitely somewhere else  <EOR> Been wanting come some time expected  Awesome food good company! <EOR> I surprised find East Coast chain found its way Las Vegas Strip  figured let's find Harold Kumar made such fuss about  first wasn't impressed  BUT some strange reason kept finding myself coming back every night soak day night drinking  smell grilled onions such aroma couldn't stay away  know isn't highest quality best burger but job done  found myself ordering 4 burger meal  even sell Sack case burgers 100 serve beer here  Great Combo  back WC  Oh yes back  <EOR> White Castle located inside Casino Royale   wish sectioned off better   really smell smoke when eating    nice finally try White Castle since none near me   burgers pretty small   liked burger bun really soft    also ordered fries which crinkle cut     Overall few tables inside customers enjoy food   Its good place grab quick snack  <EOR> The dying question worth all hype?! Really hard say but leaning closer nope  never pleasure trying real thing but love frozen ones  Frankly much difference those just bread fluffier  Them pickles killed though  I also order onion chips fries good measure  Yea   not really impressed feel haven't missing much because n Out  Yup said it  Deal it  Luckily wait 10 minutes hey least say tried it  <EOR> It's White Castle  its own entity  hamburger West Coasters myself included think when hear word 'Hamburger'  Once into idea you're eating something completely different you're road success   I fell love little onion y meat bun nuggets Kentucky  suppose if hate onions you'll hate this  onions cooked patties buns stacked top steaming everything onion y goodness  every bit good ones Kentucky    Pro Tip side onion chips order sack  <EOR> I don't understand hype about  ate first time feel disgusted even put food stomach  group myself felt ill bloated afterwards would all rather regurgitate food continue walk around strip stomachs  sliders soggy terribly put together  sliders back middle school bag way better this  fries flu just old because pale felt rubber  If sober looking decent meal eat sight see EAT HERE! food sick  Never again  Best thing fountain drinks  <EOR> It worth experience see all hype about  5 stars service burgers    1 star prices although being strip expected pay more little much  frozen ones grocery store just good <EOR> It's located castle royals junky little hotel   kind gross concerned there  Food ok but good enough way again  <EOR> OK!

Until next time Vegas    <EOR> The food ok   All workers looked hated being here   All looked unhappy  cashier seemed nice   Slow molasses   cashier 50 people line   mess place is <EOR> Burgers meh  Kinda tasted microwave burgers elementary school lunch burgers  onion strips good  Even chicken rings decent  Just wasn't taste personally  servers mix cool people people said nothing said thank nice day them picked order  Probably wouldn't buy again  <EOR> We tried because movie Harold Kumar White Castle   movie made burgers look taste amazing  reality everything but that    We Original Slider Combo Cheese Slider Combo  Each came 4 slider burgers regular crinkle cut fries drink  best way describe taste reminded microwaved cafeteria burgers elementary school  sliders weren't hot cold  meat cheese onions all lacked flavor  fries weren't any better  would've better some more salt    Despite fact 24 7 restaurant shares space casino surprisingly clean tidy  don't understand cult following sliders worth hype  If you're looking novelty burger In n Out down strip instead  <EOR> FINALLY  taste  runs but check off list    Got 10 cheeseburgers $17 dollars  boast 100% beef but slices thin notice anything amiss  Bread very soft easily soaks juices patty  Portions small even small appetite ate three still hungry    Not bad  would definitely back buy box bring home next time Vegas    Lots tables booths employee wiping tables nice  Props anytime customers left table he would immediately wipe down    The place good quick bite snack meal  just food keep going night but won't heavy full  <EOR> I wanted White Castle burger years but live Texas easy get  burger took back youth when White Castle Dallas  Glad it  <EOR> I really don't much say  grown eating when found Vegas stoked  sure way Vegas little more often now  <EOR> I wish place lived hype  mean Harold kumar whole adventure trying place! Anyway came around 6pm Wednesday pleasantly surprised wasn't long line  ordered sliders American cheese jalapeño cheese fries chicken rings onion chips drink  also brownie cheesecake dipped fudge dessert  wanted try everything menu basically lol food came pretty fast  really fell flat food  Everything really bland  There's no seasoning whatsoever anything  sliders kinda soggy  onion chips such thick coating no flavor  best thing probably brownie dessert lol cool try if you're curious since quite famous  Just don't expect lot won't disappointed  <EOR> Was impressed   didn't patty all   but fish pretty good I'd back but regule burgers everyone's hyped about  Didn't fries plain <EOR> Although White Castle East coast pretty excited stumble across Vegas! 1am Sunday night still pretty busy  line moved quick cranking order order minutes! I ordered Original Slider Chicken Slider side fries  Original Slider didn't seem fresh but surprisingly impressed Chicken Slider  came cheese crispy yet soft  great! can't wrong crinkle cut fries too  good place end long fun night Vegas! <EOR> I finally chance try white castle just hyped  did meet expectations its just plain slider low quality tasting meat  also loaded fries which better sliders  Would come again? No don't think worth money employee just made experience worse already was  He inattentive impatient customers always busy talking coworkers  first time definitely last  <EOR> Been long hated warming frozen ones market  Finally fresh  Location sucks course parking but worth it   <EOR> This place awful!!! Whole family sick eating there  type meat being used??? <EOR> The only reason because all hype hear place think why place somewhat let down me  I'd say try simply say White Castle  $10 full onion chips pretty good but other know mini sliders and sliders already small   guess 4 mini sliders equals average size burger  would suggest though when group four 10 sliders special split should through save money when looking resourceful your expenses Vegas  <EOR> Great place late night snack party hardy night Strip  Space bit cramped but food par  Service fairly quick Sack 10 sliders within 10 minutes  <EOR> As west coaster extremely excited see White Castle strip  course try it!! Small burgers but food pretty good! Also onion chips something that  basically onion rings but cut slices rings  favorite thing! Super good!   Defiantly glad opportunity try place  would eat again but maybe way it  <EOR> We #2 Cheese Slider combo 4 cheese sliders fries drink order chicken rings    employees very friendly food comes very fast   located next Walgreens strip restaurant itself bit dirty ghetto but shouldn't expect much fast food joint     This very first time having white castle never frozen ones before    must say am happy waited try settle just trying frozen versions   being special haha <EOR> I would give place MINUS star if possibly  Just another tourist trap vegas strip  Over priced junk food  Meat tastes wet carboard bland fries NOTHING special place   If best burger restaurant chains east coast people crap would call them IGNORANTS Another McDonald's dollar menu contestan lose battle       and  sad !! <EOR> First time em fries horrible but burgers tasty  Las Vegas one  <EOR> For husband's 31st bday he goal conquering White Castles 100 slider crate 10 friends  Mission accomplished! 50 50 regular jalepeno sliders fries drinks all around  called ahead place order  on time fresh sliders fries alike greasy  Bravo truly!

They're perfectly sized priced between meal snack   Opt onion chips over fries dip 'em zesty sauce  Trust  Pass other sides which taste food probably shouldn't putting your body    This good place if you're hit Crave if just nostalgic those little sliders if legitimately love White Castle  If just fast food fanatic whose never White Castle worth trying once    On White Castle scale location 10 10 staff  <EOR> I never knew could hate burger much  greasy soaked bun  meat made McDonalds look bomb  Everything burger unappealing   I try place just see Harold Kumar chowed down on  literally no idea why couldn't Harold Kumar Any Other Burger Place Cause White Castle Nasty   Worst $1 00 ever spent life  <EOR> I walked saw no line time kill try hype  There's part curious grew California where don't these  Ordering pretty efficient order matter minutes   I've only ever microwaved ones pretty much same slider cheese taste minus 2 things pickles bread softer since wasn't frozen  don't know if positive feat microwaved product taste same anywhere pretty bad see something cook fresh grill no better reheat home  Fries pretty standard crinkle fries   Maybe nostalgia way more powerful brainwashy other people but didn't really one  already don't really crazy fandom other fast foods but think some those justified this   N Five Guys actually pretty good fast fresh options understand satisfying    Cheap lowest denominator type fast food type being  fat fucks drunken stoned  only time ever gotten any sort satisfaction White Castle late night binge friends raided supermarket frozen aisle Taco Bell Jack Box some mad munchies marathoning while being inebriated drink herb food move chair    Being completely sober drug free  hungry long shift work actual senses judgement yelling WTF    how worth long line? took bites sliders    I left bit salty wasted calories that  type famous places reason foreign friends think America  gross when try just going brand hype  normally don't write pretentious fuck type reviews but  definitely agree American fast food enfatuation worst  <EOR> Im NY loved but remembered   bought crave case all burgers warm dry eating toast   all some kind freezer burn marks edges patty   remembered being steamy delicious hope improve because love WC! <EOR> Ok Southern California never really whole White Castle craze since never California begin with    A recent trip Las Vegas Chicago born girlfriend certainly changed around me  First type burger most want  small steamed burger tastes great  Small sliders bite sized White Castle all about  Quick service overall great place mind   Yes prices high but drive 1200 more miles if want closer you'll pay higher normal prices them there  Vegas over most everything Vegas overpriced    Great times good food  <EOR> 10 24 17 grab few White Castles before Gokden Knights game  little way but worth it  White Castles Nashville TN where from  Loved place!

Service It alright  Nothing complain about   TLDR place great cheap burgers  comparable McDonalds but better  flavor MELTED CHEESE! Burgers small order LOT 5 6 per person     Turn Ons Cheap Melted cheese Super small KAWAIIIII burgers Sauces Opens 24 7 I think       Turn Offs Fries Chicken rings ew <EOR> What disappointment! If visited original locations Illinois yourself favor STAY AWAY place  Grease drenched bland flavors reign supreme no matter won't care much  long lines smoke stench linger into dining room casino floor experience really sub par  wait another White Castle burger until back midwest  <EOR> I felt try since well known talked movie it  never east coast now Vegas try it  far only frozen ones which just ok   Well unfortunately tasted same frozen  Guess says good job did frozen burgers but also meh burger is  I'd imagine prices lot higher Vegas location ones east coast least hope sake  combos 2 3 sliders things tiny wouldn't surprised if people easily take down 10  single double then split some onion rings although werent rings what? qere quarters chicken rings which actually rings   way better food strip especially burgers but if suggest just trying drunking snack real meal  <EOR> When heard White Castle coming Vegas honestly excited it  never locations before but figured would cool experience especially seeing practically famous Harold Kumar White Castle I can't believe movie 11 years old now! Located Casino Royale side Strip White Castle offers cheap sliders any time day  honestly think better most fast food chains but tasted same microwaveable ones buy grocery store   The breakfast slider pretty good though  really isn't anything special because just sausage patty egg but does trick if want something simple filling breakfast   It's gourmet burger joint but definitely nice Strip  cheap prices better quality food other fast food chains White Castle winner book! might little over hyped but still place visit just say you've one  <EOR> After night dancing friends White Castle  No regrets   I White Castle burgers past  freezer section supermarket  always wonder if really uh good real life  Tao stopped White Castle bought 20 piece combo fries chicken rings  Yes chicken rings    The verdict White Castle burgers taste just burgers freezer aisle  pretty damn satisfying tasty  fries good chicken rings definitely questionable  would definitely back! <EOR> I give them 3 stars because food liking however few things don't place    1   park hotel walk through casino strip some more walking just place  walking don't mind much good exercise trying keep positive mindset especially if you're eating junk food lol 2   When finally wait line depending when tables cleared available many people besides packed are determine long wait until inside only wait another line order your food  3   dont extras section menu example if want add extra slider your combo   4   If you're sitting door entrance place during Volcano show Mirage hotel across street feel heat blowing when door open  Im fan heat yes Im aware live Vegas lol ***Lastly hope open more locations some locals tend avoid strip wont there  good food traffic strip parking hotel dealing all tourists enough keep away  <EOR> The only good thing vanilla shake which originally order chocolate shake btw burgers gross understand hype all food sucked  felt eating microwaveable burger   thumbs down  <EOR> The wait long but definitely worth it! wish So  Cal more often twice year  service definitely quick accommodating  <EOR> First time ever white castle  pretty average  busy but expect strip  Burgers good soak booze end night  Would again because price right located  Just expect wait line awhile  <EOR> Would classify hangover food nothing special  Expensive delicious  Located opening big smoky casino  Nice stop strip if want waste money delicious food just looking eat anything  sliders tiny nothing great taste them  Can't understand why people would select place meal  Would never choose eat again which why choosing rate place 1 star  <EOR> Food speed service gets solid 5 stars  Manny security guard gets 5 stars resulting score 1   Manny should work customers  <EOR> Honetly came 3 morning its 24 hour location line ridiculous  Nothing but drunk people screaming workers women barely any clothes walking around  really felt if nasty club really bad lighting    It took almost hour food workers looked tired overworked unappreciated  felt bad people yelling them cursing them saying mean things them really bad    On top ordered chicken rings try extremely dry hard  shake 7 dollars great  Overall wont coming back but hope people work nice vacation some day because through atrocious  <EOR> I don't understand rave place  years curiosity finally decided try place out  Why Las Vegas? don't know maybe because only location know now no would try frozen bought grocery stores  I'd rather freshly made real experience slider   Now heard grilled onions specialty ingredient gives slider buns patty flavorful taste  Although true slider very simplistic  Cheese extremely thin piece Wendy's shaped patty it  guess much almost $2!! Seriously little tiny cube slider more expensive burger dollar menu Mc Donald's?

Service Run Through people making oompa loompa rates back long line moves fairly quickly  Cashier service stereotypical lunch lady status  The sliders downright disgusting  2 AM drunk person  Yeah quoting myself but when slider doesn't taste good when 2 AM you're drunk know something wrong here  usually spit some sarcastic remark bad something but just bad point being indescribable  fries flavorless prepare yourself some hands salting   Let blame impractical jokers 2 step flow communication come here  understand fast food blah blah but even sloppy big mac would better choice  Don't let east coast bias suck in  Vegas way more options 2 AM city never sleeps  If you're just dying some white castle sliders just some frozen ones your grocery store let them thaw day call doing Vegas style  <EOR> Service good   cleanliness bit lacking staff clearing tables very quickly   would 1 start if didn't sell beer     The sliders okay best am unsure where all hype comes from   If fast food burgers your goal would pick In N Out before going White Castle   If compared any sort restaurant style burger would remove White Castle your memory never thought again     Don't want journey WC?  frozen versions Super Market just good WC  <EOR> It's    fine   really sure expecting but questionable item bucket list since first Harold Kumar movie   Being west coast girl adventurous fast food cuisine me   Turns hamburgers taste pretty much exactly microwaved versions buy grocery store   chicken rings taste bit breaded shoe leather definitely don't bother ordering those   There significant wait your order dining area suffused quiet desperate sadness if no available tables a lot drinks elsewhere try again later  <EOR> Located inside Casino Royale Hotel Casino   Get loaded fries along your sliders   Warning seen line 40 deep times  <EOR> White Castle definitely overhype worth maybe came during wrong time  lot food your meal but taste your average fast food easily any fast food restaurant  Some employees seem very impatient but can't really expect much fast food restaurant  always packed  worth experience Vegas say least  If starving 3 4 morning no other option next time visit Vegas might give second chance? <EOR> Simply put burgers sliders suck  walked pretty low expectations didn't even meet that  But you're likely going check White Castle anyway whether morbid curiosity did because nostalgia    I stopped opening day because walking distance away friend already line  line moved relatively quickly but White Castle way underestimated wait time  nice handed free sliders sorry but ironically well intended gesture made consider getting line sampling sliders  But promised bring WC back other people stayed line   Great service fast food place especially opening day  Everybody helpful nice smiley despite all chaos read churning around 4 000 sliders hour which insane    I've never another WC before but heard they're normally priced around 80cents each vs cheapest you'll $1 09 100 pack  say higher prices due higher rent strip but  bs would've made ridiculously high volume location they're just plain greedy  But only WC west of    think Missouri?

Pretty curios that  Anyways anybody grew back east should know White Castle  first location west course Las Vegas Blvd  sure some people expecting built minds place  exactly same always just higher prices not extreme though because location  Vegas local someone grew eating say good but deserving more 3 stars    PROS Same White Castle always had  If enjoyed them past enjoy them here They serve beer which pretty cool  Dining area seems well kept clear trash   CONS Location    Good company sure but locals absolutely hate coming strip  understand why first but wish now easier outside strip  Size   said well kept clean but nearly big enough amount foot traffic comes through   Some employees    Look work drunk asshole tourists everyday understand through but some not all just  nasty attitudes  Granted few bad apples but leave impression  few times fries old cold asked politely new ones met sighs eye rolls  Please expand into local area! <EOR> We're San Diego boyfriend eager eat White Castle wasn't food truck    it tasted same lol  wasn't impressed because burger only far flavor especially White Castle's concept simple sliders just meat buns optional cheese onions pickles  But they're still good easy eat  They're also fun eat  food cute portion which allows order more them just sticking nice small portion should eating haha    Taste wise burgers honestly taste McDonald's dollar cheeseburgers BUT BETTER  stress better because comparing them McDonald's  White Castle better buns better meat better sides sure  onion chips faaaaavorite  chicken rings okay dry if anything but good change if want chicken your side  french fries remind cafeteria fries cafeteria food    White Castle cheap which plus  aren't trying sell gourmet food don't expect gourmet burgers  They're just simple small bad all  see White Castle doing very well SoCal highly competitive all SoCal's other burger joints seriously  would nice addition fast food joints choose from    I'm just deducting star because food isn't anything ordinary expect fast food though?  but sure wasn't goal begin sober least  <EOR> Way overrated! Only famous Harold Kumar  food isn't great pricy  would never recommend white castle but if understand aren't great food willing pay premium then all means take shot! <EOR> OK   waiting find white castle somewhere near San diego   come vegas conference walking along strip see white castle!!!

Yes definitely  Would crave them late night? much     if craving fast food late night would probably Five Guys fries soooo addictive anything Del Taco Chick Fil A    But here's friend well would try next time if ever visited WC again Cheese Sliders sliders vary slightly Original because include slide American cheese  need cheese burgers     since take tomatoes pickles can't really just slider burger alone  friend 2 $3 at least buggers cheap saw them being mass produced  in thin patties grill multiples workers putting everything together true assembly line fashion  bun soft tasted fresh which plus but patty  is even call it?  was super thin     thin could hardly even taste it  reminded super thin slice Spam  liked fact slider really light  didn't feel heavy bloated eating it  but definitely needed cheese  guess expecting slider addicting some kind addictive taste since much hype but factor lacking me  glad experience but would probably order something different next time  Seriously don't know people order packs packs   Bacon Cheddar Grilled Chicken would actually interested trying slider because more elements like  medley features savory grilled chicken zesty cheddar cheese sauce smoky bacon crumbles  cheese bacon maybe slider slightly more tasty Cheese Slider had  Western BBQ Grilled Chicken love BBQ flavors slider sounds right alley  features savory grilled chicken slider topped smoky BBQ sauce crispy onion rings  BBQ inspired sandwiches down try slider day  Fish Sliders fish sliders before really liked willing give WC version go  features two fish sliders made Alaska Pollock topped American cheese  even upgrade combo add small fries soft drink  hugest fan soft drinks but would want add fries order     sort fish 'n chips all but slider form  Loaded Fries huge fan loaded fries since WC version features fries topped creamy ranch dressing hickory smoked bacon crumbles I'd definitely want order them some day  Brownie Stick dessert sounds really cute seems great mini indulgence  treat stick features chocolate brownie dipped rich fudge coating  Brownies favorite snacks everything just tastes better when presented fun form     if craving something sweet WC meal would this  Cheesecake Stick its brownie counterpart cheesecake piece bound best little indulgence fast food meal  made light creamy cheesecake dipped rich fudge coating  down try chocolate covered cheesecake both dipped dessert options available truck maybe visit actual WC restaurant     Bacon Egg Cheese Slider breakfast slider sounds best ones WC menu  includes freshly cracked loosely scrambled eggs topped American cheese crisp hickory smoked bacon steamed signature bun  huge fan breakfast sandwiches would willing try breakfast slider if came WC when breakfast menu's being featured  <EOR> I hated ! Chicago excited idea more food  Onion chips WTF n cold send back   Save calories !! <EOR> White Castle two ways typically   People fanatics hate it   Personally fall former category   fries delicious sliders unique offering steamed variation burger   toppings minimal yet effective   first time chicken ring sliders which pretty good seemed offer sizable piece chicken   N' may little better but White Castle great well   Having closest location Los Angeles stopped Vegas White Castle Crave Case   Cheeseburger Sliders which run $41 case 30   Although remember them having ketchup when asked them hold ketchup informed came without ketchup but did pickles which did remember   ones quite steamed good some east coast locations but hey eating White Castle am complain?!  sure pickles needed sit freezer while work way through case may regret getting smaller order going frozen ones home but far yet disappointed   if anything mental appeal novelty having authentic White Castle experience awaiting freezer help give edge  <EOR> So glad Castle Vegas  Other parking situation locals money  bit disappointed first visit I think employees still learning however all rest just right  gourmet fast food  could eat those cheese sliders morning noon night  Thank White Castle!!! <EOR> Ummmmmmm don't know  Way hyped IMO  When N Shake Shack other options why would come here? sandwiches taste EXACTLY frozen ones   Which wonder   guess people enjoy drunchies but even drunk didn't it  guess only thing thought alright onion rings   Btw next day toilet most day  Yup  Definitely fan  <EOR> Been wanting try place since everyone keeps talking it  Came day Christmas packed but managed table came before rush  Ordered fish slider chicken slider regular beef slider  sliders good but portion tiny compared photos  I enjoyed but gone before knew it  took 3 bites gone  wish patty slightly bigger quite thin almost missed it  fish slider delicious super soft  chicken slider probably best all 3 me  Please increase your portion! <EOR> Wow  least say knocked White Castle bucket list  Even though burgers fresh pretty much say isn't much difference taste between frozen ones grocery store  beef quality right Taco Bell's mystery beef no bueno  10 pack $10  two burgers back hotel didn't even finish rest   Thanks hype Harold Kumar!!
