Ein Besuch Las Vegas beginnt oder endet oder beides zwangsläufig mit einem Besuch im Harley Davidson Cafe  Vor 4 Jahren landeten wir nach einem schweißtreibenden Marsch den Strip rauf und runter zum ersten Mal hier da draußen auf einer schier endlos hohen Säule geschrieben steht Best BBQ town und wir eh schon ein wenig überfordert waren von und mit dieser gigantischen Stadt die abends nur aus glitzernden und funkelnden Lichtern besteht  Das überdimensionale Motorrad das förmlich aus der Fassade springt tat sein Übriges uns zu überzeugen   Wie es sich den USA gehört wartet man artig bis man zum Tisch geleitet wird und dann weiß man schon fast gart nicht mehr wohin man schauen soll  schweren Ketten werden Harleys aller Bauarten und Jahrgänge durch das Restaurant gezogen und schweben sogar teilweise über die Köpfe der Gäste hinweg  Beeindruckend ist auch die amerikanische Flagge am Kopfende die komplett aus Eisenketten besteht die von der Decke hängen diese Flagge ist geziert von der POW MIA Fahne gewidmet all den Soldaten die im Kriegsdienst gefangen oder vermisst werden Prisoners War Missing Action   der oberen Etage sind viele Bilder zu sehen und mit Unterschriften von mehr oder weniger berühmten Persönlichkeiten versehene Tankdeckel  Heiraten kann man hier auch Aber nun zur Speisekarte das Menu ist rustikal laminiert und hat uns erst einmal überfordert  Also bestellten wir bei unserem ersten Besuch den einfachsten Burger auf  der Karte den Ultra Classic Burger  Als wir dann gefragt wurden wie wir das Fleisch denn gerne hätte zweifelte ich zunächst mal meinen Englischkenntnissen da mich bislang niemals gefragt hatte wie ich denn meinen Burger gerne durchgebraten oder auch nicht! hätte  Der georderte Burger war gigantisch und ein Gedicht fast wie dieser Folge von met your mother wo Marshall von dem einen Burger schwärmt den er seiner Anfangszeit NY gegessen hat und dem keiner mehr das Wasser reichen konnte  Leider hielt der Burger bei unseren folgenden Besuchen auch nicht mehr das die Erinnerung versprach Alle Portionen sind hier nahezu riesig und kaum zu schaffen wie z  B  die Wild Hog Biker Platte oder das Philly Cheese Steak  Die Sizzling Hot Fajitas werden mit allerlei Beilagen serviert und sind auch zu empfehlen  Das T Bone Steak kostet zwar etwas mehr aber zergeht dafür auch auf der Zunge  Eigentlich ist auch alles immer lecker aber wenn ich einen Punkt Abzug geben müsste dann wäre es weil es einfach zuviel ist    aber hey wenn es das nicht wäre würden unsere amerikanischen Freunde vermutlich Punkte abziehen weil die Portionen nicht dem entsprechen sie gewohnt sind    Die Kellner sind immer flott und zuvorkommend  Mit der Restaurantrechnung bekommt man dann im angrenzenden Harley Store 20% auf seinen Einkauf    vermutlich weil man eh eine neue größere Garnitur Shirts benötigt wenn man hier regelmäßig essen würde  <EOR> My GF  came Vegas week vacation  She Vegas couple times school conceder myself local  stop Café late bit eat admit chain restaurant expectation rather low  Place appointed Harley stuff ride Road Glide part attraction  roasted chicken GF Fajitas food pretty good drinks better expected   PROs 1  Food decent great but hey chain 2  Drinks good reasonable priced when consider keep glass   3  right strip if people watcher place   CONs 1  Wait staff took while order bring food  nice did look packed but did took bit long 2  BBQ sauce very good mind sweet vanilla thing going   Final Prob would back <EOR> Didn't research ahead time but happened walk place while pretty hungry  waited 10 minutes table 8pm   ordered chili burger fries which good great  Overall service good food okay  <EOR> These folks getting star because can't express bad BBQ is  If dry ass chicken here  advertise best BBQ town all LIES!
