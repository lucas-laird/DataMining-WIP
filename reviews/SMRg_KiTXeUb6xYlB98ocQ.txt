I'm giving place 4 stars based potential currently   I think if right people came together those vision imagination place could really something  would good space say Dave Buster's maybe  think having movie theater space would awesome  Correct if wrong but think theater before  I'd see theater maybe specializes old classics maybe some Indies especially local directors maybe few first run movies  personally would show some cheesy B movies Elvis movies anything related Vegas anything silent present day films   I could maybe see having vintage clothing store vintage furniture shop  think few unique eateries would good idea nothing fancy just simple minimalistic  Tiki bar some type pub dive bar would nice fit well  Basically anything Neon motif  think art gallery thing good fit  think would see some old photos Vegas used look celebrity photos blueprints old Casinos anything links past Old Vegas    I truly hope place reaches its potential people really start appreciate it  doesn't really cater Tourists  Locals should want turn into something themselves place would want come hang maybe bring friends families here  Breathe life back into place don't let fade away  <EOR> Wow   Poor poor poor Neonopolis   If Shakespeare rose dead wanted write new tragedy would probably Neonopolis   Act 1 would facility opening Act 3 would Jillians hope Star Trek Experience coming Act 5 would Las Vegas Rocks closing   Neonopolis Las Vegas Virtual Boy Nintendo both noble dreams looked excellent paper but both ended being complete failures reality     Quick history place   Most retail space vacant throughout most facility's history tough fill empty spaces establishments   Jillians fun arcade lounge type place similar Gameworks Dave Buster's but suffered badly maintained machines overpriced games   long before closed fraternity held rush recruitment event banquet rooms while fun few good things Jillians   place closed shortly after   It movie theater but why theater when could just another closer where live where parking easier?  Plus lack air conditioning DESERT made difficult lure moviegoers in   soon closed   They later Poker Dome event   nice facility spectator areas pretty cool high tech   Unfortunately watching people play poker nowhere near entertaining actually playing poker   fact watching Garry Kasparov play chess would probably more exciting watching poker   Now while some might enjoy watching poker television just can't into it   Needless say when champion crowned didn't again   When Star Trek Experienced closed down Hilton Trekkies myself heartbroken   However relieved when told Experience would relocated Neonopolis   Unfortunately numerous auctions selling props Experience took place relocation Neonopolis likely Captain Picard manning Starship Enterprise again   Experience remains stranded Delta Quadrant Neonopolis remains Neutral Zone   Las Vegas Rocks closing looks final nail Neonopolis's coffin   quite sad really   Neonopolis everything paper revitalization Downtown area   while First Friday large number plush comfortable bars lounges revitalizing area itself Neonopolis remains proverbial ghost town reminder could but never was   PROS Filmmaker looking creepy deserted place?  go!  CONS Everything  THE VERDICT Just pretend never happened  <EOR> Parked car garage Cinco De Mayo since where usually park but last night horrible experience  exit process slow which totally understandable considering around 1AM everyone leaving  When turn exit second lane  Two overweight security guards there  tried insert debit card machine but down  told security guard cash  security guards didn't want take cash cash booth first lane asked if could car walk myself since cars behind me  car tried pay but lady said first lane since ticket connected car somehow bunch bull ticket ticket   Then security guard started yelling back car did  back then first lane  lady working said she couldn't accept cash since only $50 $100 I think might pocketing cash   tried pay every way could but being difficult  trying leave garage without paying  asked boss name is  She refused give real name boss' name  She stated code names David Wang  cash booth agent rude security guards same  even tried collect dollar bills car only $4  $1 short  guards want to be cops  situation could've handled more professionally especially because lot cars behind me  city needs stop wasting money jack ass employees three them  fault having smaller bills but trying pay since usually pay card first down  ended opening gate exchanging much words between friends them  said situation could've handled better but city needs hire train better people  <EOR> I've wandered around empty halls Necropolis that's right official nickname Neonopolis Necropolis many times back hoodrat days  Neonopolis Necropolis ever since day opened  movie theater no once movie tickets dirt cheap I didn't think $5 tickets movies existed anymore concession stand also more food usual movie theater lobby french fries pizza mozzarella sticks etc     only ones movie theater  movie Meet Browns wasn't good but best moviegoing experiences ever had   And then Jillian's  always felt cool being able  hang bar like environment 14  restaurant arcade bowling alley pool hall dancefloor stage shows  used much fun  And pretty damn easy sneak into psuedo nightclub upstairs well  Neonopolis really could very cool place but execution just terrible  And think main reason why because essentially wall  Outdoor shopping entertainment venues may work California but don't fly somewhere Vegas  Put roof over thing! <EOR> I'm sure meh experienced better rating would apply place  mean Neonopolis  Where else would find three story establishment covered neon?  I before knowing was  seemed location zombie movie  found weird escalator working even though no businesses upstairs or maybe just didn't look hard enough? lol Fast forward opened Denny's grand re opening added more stores more lights  improving I'd say much  just gonna recommending others    least now  <EOR> This place looks dead shopping  Not kind mall expexted  Only 5 stores open 2pm <EOR> The Neonopolis kinda creepy  always kinda creepy long remember  semi abandoned shopping center tucked away corner Fremont Street Experience  People don't really ever back here  when wander into kinda feel you've sucked into weird Vegas equivalent Bermuda triangle  bizarro many ways   also interesting  Can't say there's any particular reason come back here  few stores aren't all interesting  But hey when bored and or need some shade form Vegas sun heat come back check out  <EOR> Seems lot not so stellar reviews Neonopolis   Personally think decent little area compared rest Downtown   parking garage great location and well priced IMO Denny's FULL BAR comic book store lot fun things look vape store definitely great eye candy and seems attract lot business convenient locale nice hide away but step right into Downtown should want   I've heard Drink Drag closed which bummer since really enjoyed place   would awesome if KRAVE opened  think would really help little diamond rough   Also across street StrEATS nice bonus if want some place park  <EOR> I'm giving Neonopolis 5 stars based past but because new boss taking HUGE steps working Mayor fix all mismanaged past   Their most recent news SAVING Star Trek Experience oblivion thanks nothing Paramount Hilton working CBS move venue   keep costs down they're working hard new businesses think kind effort deserves recognition   GOOD LUCK NEONOPOLIS!  Everyone should return check you're doing now  <EOR> Neonopolis good idea but lacks execution   never seen looking ghost town which may only because only down night   But   wait   this Vegas   If going bustling going bustling night right?  Hardly   And kind deserted  quaint refreshing sea much all the time   No all   stranded desert coming across completely empty town finding doll rocking chair kind deserted creepy deserted   If ignore sounds kids screaming put more money card god easier tokens swear Jillian's almost silent   There's much could done but don't know really will   seems losing venture try much juncture   I don't know   getcherself some mall food something   Try avoid zombie escalator  <EOR> Parking super easy  Offers variety food also allowing mix match ala carte   American food Asian Mexican cuisine  self service service quick  <EOR> Went 4 years ago came Ohio seen movie ate La Salasa shopping  Now again last weekend family wanted see movie but now boarded closed sign says please visit Regal Texas Station La salsa closed but sign still also there's nothing here     Denny's coming soon         heartatack grill worst service ever <EOR> I stayed Fremont Hotel during Vegas trip recently  decided take walk down Fremont Street Experience heading eastbound noticed Denny's Restaurant International Eatery Food Court   I walked around lower level noticed few stores  tattoo parlor Toy Shack American Sports Trading Cards Celestial Comics e vapor lounge Mediterranean restaurant Heart Attack Grill stage area  second floor consisted Southern Nevada Museum Fine Arts main office Neonopolis building bowling lane which opened 5pm office architecture design well several empty store fronts  third level heading towards theaters but blocked off  Parking located underground customers    Right middle Fremont Street front International Eatery food court Walgreens also beginning Slotzilla Zip line  adventurous individuals choose two rides  first short ride stops front Fremont Hotel  longer ride continues towards west end Fremont Street Experience   Hopefully near future more stores added Neonopolis shopping center  <EOR> Nostalgia  appreciate old school arcade Toy Shack  spotted during daylight while sitting across heart attack grill guessing weights persons brave enough step scales front  would awesome feat area come alive again using architected wisms Fremont's Neonopolis 'glimpse past' come alive!! <EOR> I craving ice cream all day finally made mind eat NEONOPOLIS  EATERY wow mistake   NEVER turned down taste ice cream BAD ATTITUDE ignored Melissa's attitude because really wanted ice cream  asked scoop she gave half scoop if less  only realized shortchanged order brother came order ice cream someone else serve him  DON'T THERE!!
