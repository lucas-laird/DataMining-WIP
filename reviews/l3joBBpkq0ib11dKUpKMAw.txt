Having multiple karaoke spots town say favorite spot! Cheap drinks fun singing  Would choose place over any other karaoke spot town  <EOR> This place cool best atmosphere perfect song selection  Came work loved drink special hours great <EOR> Horrible customer service your employee Angela  stickler exceptional customer service place did even come close subpar service  called check availability told rooms first come first serve basis however girl Angela spoke said she would put name list certain time sure because coming when she said merely waiting list  story changed constantly  She said EVERY ROOM booked but then another party came she gave them room  asked why given room she said she thought just wanted medium room  But wasn't any type disclosure part far any other options had    There no accommodation no customer service all  would never come back again am going tell every single person know comes Las Vegas come here  Ever    It's blatantly obvious establishment certain type crowd  <EOR> I come almost weekly!!  why see 5 stars   The location isn't greatest neighborhoods but doesn't phase all   fun cheap well but we'll pricing later   They private rooms different sizes Small Medium Large   small room fits 5 people   Any more they'll charge medium room plus starts getting uncomfortable   Medium fits 10 people rather comfortable when there's only few you   large room pretty damn large   could fit 15 people but wouldn't recommend going 15 because just lessens your mic time   also VIP room which seats 20   never but know it   Lol   The food little overpriced I'd suggest eating before after   don't allow outside food beverages including water don't caught it   only possibly charge extra might refuse service next time   Lol   O buy two free deal beer   don't drink but know lot do!! Lol   They huge song list!! course depending language get   Usually Korean English which to date Pop songs but even huge selection wish more!! Recently tried Tagalog English book good songs which Korean one   wish could both but machines different switch out   They'll let switch halfway through might end doing now on   Lol   The price rooms hourly per person which great!! more people invite cheaper if split evenly   deal going  50% off Sunday Wednesday   Those only times go   accept card but charge least $10 keep mind when splitting amongst your friends   Lol   Like said earlier isn't greatest neighborhoods cleanest either   But cleaner most karaoke places Vegas   Lol   I don't know why took long write review place   Maybe because huge LESBIAN crush it!!

We came enjoy friends birthday greeted fun hosts   We did soju shots waiter would come take shot us   A lively atmosphere good selection songs  <EOR> I love Karaoke Q! I am also karaoke superstar sense  The only reason give 4 stars because selection random   Doors but only 2 songs  3 Shania Twain songs  Rarely any hit wonders  then really random songs people Glenn Campbell but most famous song  I am drinker  don't drink  all  religious political personal reasons  just thing  But someone introduced Soju bomb flavors! Yogurt Soju best 2 1 free deal if you're into that   ALSO  Though pricey place BEST CHICKEN WINGS  I know  bold statement but truly feel way  large breaded flavorful  Sometimes just just chicken wings and also visit stylish restaurant next door chicken wings other food    ALSO   They really dope art  dunno did but ill    Great hospitality too  <EOR> Fun spot but really bad service  friends birthday wanted buy drink pay wouldn't group tab  told no now if would better reason would understand  But workers said wouldn't let pay drink different  tab because don't take care them  just did understand he meant  He kept asking if any work restaurant which most don't  didn't understand why he would ask us  Now group tip well 15 20% when but saying don't take care them isn't good way earn tip  <EOR> I've three times think prices good when split group  song selection decently date  serve alcohol restaurant attached    My only complaint hot room last visit hard enjoy myself  Otherwise clean decent staff cute rooms  <EOR> This place amazing! service awesome rooms great  Jacob best!

This karaoke bar to!! <EOR> I'll start off saying don't karaoke don't typically sing LOL   Reason why am rating high because dragged many karaoke bar easily best far   First off clean   Most time poorly lit private rooms feel something going crawl leg expect pants stick sofa when stand up   place actually pretty comfortable seemed taken care well staff   Speaking staff service fast   Ring doorbell someone room within few seconds   When ordered drinks came quickly   friendly knew enough English communicate LOL efficient   Speaking drinks prices cheap!  house soju BOGO $15 two large bottles great value   also little less sweet which good thing   probably little heavier hand which always nice!  All other drinks buy two free   beers etc   just no hard liquor except Soju   And lastly room itself 25% off since Sun Thur room around $15 party 10    practically nothing split between your whole party guys should able fun break bank! <EOR> Awesome place when wanna embarrass yourself front your friends but entire bar! Although need more rap hip hop selections! <EOR> If your mood some kareoke   I highly recommend Q kareoke!!! best place ever!! Nice rooms great service!!! Love place <EOR> Ever since back home coworkers wanted karaoke night  taken two half months but Karaoke Q finally garnered visit affection!  Not only discounted rooms amazing deal itself Mon Thurs half off rooms Friday Saturday 20% off rooms but pretty decent drink specials well buy two free all alcohol  Seriously once you're room all inhibitions far gone  employee explaining system pretty neat huge remote selecting songs button wall service Korean Japanese song selection far out number English  However found plenty sing Britney Spears Cranberries Strokes brink singing Bieber fever quickly shot down may add coworkers' violent protests   projectors pumping Korean videos American songs heart instantly smitten  What's love K Pop bands background while sing your heart 'I Always Love You'?  right nothing!  The rooms large comfortably accommodating seven initially then ten  service very friendly quick when requested  total three hours medium room cost around 39 dollars  Adding few bottles Blue Moon came around 52 dollars  Enough justification come back next week opinion  <EOR> This place always poppin'! Best place karaoke Vegas hands down  There's always great music playing loud music bumpin' served quickly  would definitely recommended place friends <EOR> This place overall just hits all right spots great karaoke place    Drinks food availvale spacious rooms music always new good customer service    I guess place doubles restaurant too! should give try serve best Korean chicken ever!

Bonus star having huge bottles Hite  think liter  Don't ask much cost  missed little detail  Although know running buy 2 1 free special    There Chinese Korean English songs but approximately 30% songs weren't working which means did chance sing Holding Hero  bummed because Material Girl didn't carry quite same gusto  However am happy able sing Manic Monday  If don't know sing recommend highly    For weekday entertainment sure beats traditional happy hour  <EOR> We jammin da one  Love here!!! much fun! come back here  much music choose hours!
