 PLACE Located Venetian Hotel fifth floor next pool area  Atmosphere pretty nice because view    SERVICE slow staff very unattentive but person refills drink only person attentive   wasn't busy but looks very unorganized   first person took orders although believe he wasn't waiter but he probably trying help co worker taking orders assumed because second third guy whos taking orders same uniform except first guy dark blue polo shirt    Second guy came table asking order gave again order third guys asking if ready order   circus 3 people taking your order without other knowing   first person told them he already took order totally confused person charge   After finished eating took them long process bills  FOOD I did order American Breakfast just normally american breakfast   asked scramble egg bacon instead sausage half cut strawberry stingy fruits 1 very thin sliced orange simple decoration  piece white bread  cut half served 2 jam butter   portion pretty small but price standard   Coffee they refill your coffee ask milk cream   best but its alright  <EOR> I should read breakfast reviews before settling cafe  omelet overpriced $18 two eggs some mushrooms some cheese but SERVICE terrible   Despite being 5 occupied tables server scarce barely gave time day  refill water own water bottle  Never able flag down condiments ketchup  ask different server find could bill then SERVER FORGOT  Eventually grab own server didn't even realize food come despite fact hour   He check but again gone fast didn't even chance ask if could charge breakfast room   Also just FYI receipts no way bill your room track down your server them write out  but NOTE if made separate call front desk authorize charges your room tell not them despite being part hotel find some way call them  bummer since did bring phones or credit cards pool    back all way rooms wasting much time already   UGH  Save yourself trouble grab $8 panini CBTL inside Venetian  <EOR> This place perfect quick lunch  mom came eat because tanning pool area needed some shade food  both ordered Caesar salad  salad good however chicken mine bit dry  service great multiple servers kept refilling water when halfway  perfect because hot outside    I knocked off star because when mom received bill waitress left another person's bill next ours able see someone else spent  felt little uncomfortable seeing someone else's bill next ours wouldn't want someone seeing bill  Otherwise perfect place quick lunch outside  <EOR> It surprises celebrity chefs willing put name on  Riva poolside all outdoor restaurant Venetian  lunch completely underwhelmed choices menu food itself  Really? celebrity chef comes with? Sad   Very few choices better want pizza club sandwich standard salad   it  daughter cheese pizza  club sandwich which came fries  strawberry colada swirl  $60 later called lunch left  could gotten anywhere  Why earth would Wolfgang Puck offered up? Seems crazy me   If want overspend something better your local diner   come here  <EOR> We stopped pick lunch while staying Venetian  Really  only time sense stop all if you're living Vegas little time explore city's culinary delights   We 1  Grilled Beef Satays 2  Crispy Salt Pepper Calamari Popcorn Shrimp 3  Margherita Pizza   Not sure why Wolfgang Puck continues allow name associated such mediocre over priced food really  Does empire care retention?  Everything somewhere between Meh A OK  <EOR>
