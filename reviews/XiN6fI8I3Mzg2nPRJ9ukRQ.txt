Needless say neither waiter chef management ever came address problem meat   guess just expected eat pay regardless mishandled  The other issue dinner evening timing   appetizer literally took 35 minutes entrée pasta dishes arrive  10 minutes through appetizer 25 minutes waiting next plate  At end dinner leaving waiter checked said hope everything good replied everything except appetizer response Yea sorry that  Well sorry but sorry going spending any more money anytime soon  Overall nice place but needs some significant fine tuning  <EOR> I stopped hard workout Sunday brunch worth treat! tagliatelle salmone much flavor wasn't big couldn't finish it  also really enjoyed mini souffle special dish day! atmosphere pretty light  can't wait come back  <EOR> Amazing !!! pizza amazing kids had  chicken parm ceaser salad both where amazing !!! portions big! sauce spaghetti parmigiana amazing   Very cheesy delicious   back sure! <EOR> Nothing wrong sea great Italian options Vegas though just seemed bit mediocre me  Service fine exceptional  think pasta dish pizza neither stood out  decor trying trendy hip but wasn't quite there  If small town sure it'd top Italian place but there's half dozen Italian places I'd Vegas before returning think  <EOR> Definitely cut above standard Italian fare around here  Great service  Real artistry food prep presentation  Very nice bruschetta appetizer terrific beet salad maybe best ever big fan type salad  Wife lasagna which excellent  fettuccine braised short ribs total standout  Good sized servings each brought half order home   Wife strawberry crepe dessert  cannoli  Both very good  Left full very satisfied  return  <EOR> Thrilled!

Why didn't person took order share him? guessed awkward    Overall food pretty good enjoyed evening friends but service soured overall restaurant experience  <EOR> Although waited 15 minutes before anyone came over acknowledge manager waiter deeply apologized happened everything thereafter great dining experience  food UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING!!! special Osso Bucco Saffron Risotto wife Cioppino girls shared pizza pasta meat sauce  found new Italian restaurant eat close house definitely back!!! <EOR> Loved fresh pasta fresh bread  Everything fiancee ordered delicious beginning end  Very cute restaurant  Nice little place date night  definitely come back recommend restaurant! <EOR> Great authentic Italian food   live music Sunday Brunch which nice touch   definitely back  <EOR> Everything delicious!
