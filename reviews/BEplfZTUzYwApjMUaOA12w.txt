Canonita well worth trip  course if you're staying Venetian close gondolas    Came party delighted word 'Go'  Mind kinda stopped Mexican food thing because often mediocre and  any city   truly healthiest  But Canonita blew both prejudices   * Margaritas  Yes very tasty potent without knocking over  Enjoyed balance sweetness citrusy tartness  Mmm  And gave cups when later taxi'd off Karaoke  * Chips guac  chips tasty just enough crisp just enough salt certainly no oily residue  guacamole damn good  thick tasty without lot mysterious ingredients  Straightforward delish   *Filet Mignon choice could also gone Salmon chicken dish   Lovely 8 oz think weight  Don't bother requesting temp your meat because kitchen really doesn't think know what's best  Happily same mind term heat Medium Rare loving it  Wonderful flavors frankly can't recall I mentioned margaritas right?   If all interested steak worthy choice your entree   I must say dessert fine but anticlimactic  Really necessary  However did brownie sundae which definitely didn't hurt anything except maybe waistline   Service pleasant attentive without being all over us  Water refilled necessary which fairly often    Overall most surprised Yelp reviews seemed unenthusiastic  would absolutely recommend Canonita if sit 'outside' gondolas don't even notice them  Gracias! Muchas gracias! <EOR> Visit place once experience if food  place festive charm amazing view gondoliers singing sailing gondolas couples or tourists   However place pricier $$ sign displayed next restaurant name yelp specially when adds drink cocktail your order  But liked speedy Gonzalez We specially enjoyed Chile Relleno only tasted good but also looked pretty   On other hand personally hated myself ordering queso fundido could  better off just chips salsa  <EOR> Great meal very convenient if you're guest Venetian  Ate dinner here  chips salsa guacamole appetizer good portion brought leftover chips back room snack later  Standout appetizer mussels shrimp chorizo  think only two pieces shrimp but mussels generous chorizo sauce amazing  dish needed more bread soak sauce  boyfriend pork barbacoa said delicious  Would definitely return  <EOR> FAQ  Q Mexican food inside Venetian  Doesn't strike odd?

offering menus case something specific struck eye gracious tableside service middle aged Hispanic gentleman afternoon commenced jokey sort professionalism guiding through afternoon really could asked better Northeastern born but Border Grill educated Chef Donna Willey also stopping frequently discuss inspiration training well techniques implemented more dozen plates plus two trios drinks   Undoubtedly 'touristy' setting views artificial sky alongside canal juxtaposing traditional Mexican decorations within restaurant's confines trio Margaritas chips rewarmed outside source dining began

meringue while both brownie flan also quite good former obviously quite hefty while latter proved far lighter other versions offered town XO just boozy enough give some kick while unrefined sugar syrup helped soften blow   Clearly given VIP treatment such sampling far greater swath menu average duo possibly could food Chef Willey creating Canonita once almost universally approachable yet same time bold complicated way few other Casino based ethnic restaurants would dare   Admittedly underwhelmed more routine plates guacamole queso fundido well carne asada still perplexed why restaurant would outsource something tortilla chips when executing more complex items well no doubt great meal Canonita those willing venture away tried true particularly when taking into account vibe view  <EOR> Well payed listening fellow yelpers  Being Texas very high standards Mexican food  did meet those expectations  Chips salsa aren't free  No retried beans  No Spanish rice  No sweetnlow  But forget all food bland  No taste  Even salsa  Disappointed sure  <EOR> I flautas tried mango classic margaritas    The flautas crunchy plenty meat inside   margaritas really good   it's really juice dangerous   Service great food came reasonable amount time   Beware getting guacamole free chips! $11 small bowl sure wipe bowl clean! <EOR> came Canonita today before checked hotel  waitress Danielle

dressing OK  highlight meal  Then delivered some barbacoa rice beans  rice green flavorless  black beans same  better seasoning beans can  barbacoa tender but sauce awful  Only salvation dip bland ass

Oh horchata   magnificent! Perfectly balanced between sweetness thickness  best cups had   For price atmosphere location food place strikes good balance those budget but don't want wander onto strip looking McD's Denny's Chipotle around corner  <EOR> GREAT MEXICAN DOESN'T DIVEY  Canonita's food right best Mexican LA San Diego even Mexico City   Since opened gone Vegas without eating there   Everything delicious without exception right down salsa chips hard fill on   Even rice which comes side just everything missed   star meal however always salsa verde hands down best salsa verde ever had   Ask side they charge $1 but worth it pour onto whatever end eating   Don't expect taqueria conventional sense because Canonita little common holes in the wall where often find best Mexican food   Which say Canonita isn't authentic just gentrified and thereby both healthier more elaborate version same cuisine  <EOR> I would give canonita 3 5 stars  came breakfast morning boyfriend    Great location canals enjoyed breakfast right next canal    I Mexican torta  seems lot bread food inside took off bread  tortilla Chips underneath anyways  wish offered dish egg dish instead sandwich  also wish came two eggs  inside sandwich very tasty!

Next wait staff rushed cleaned mess  waiter told just relax let ruin day  waiter brought friend's mother replacement glass sangria assured restaurant take care any cleaning expenses shirt because accidents happen  He gentleman it  Meanwhile opposing table European tourists throwing hissy fit towards restaurant manager wait staff demanding pay shirt waive bill we caused  manager patiently listened demands offered pay cleaning expenses  wasn't enough however  wanted reimbursement brand new shirt which looked just plain white t shirt may add well waive bill  seemed taking advantage situation  European woman then pointed finger friend told come over once again she asked going pay shirt and or cleaning expenses  point all pretty much shock awe all just completely lost appetite  Eventually European tourists manager came compromise gave them half off bill offered pay cleaning expenses t shirt  Obviously European tourists believed compromise unreasonable happy all  Why he the manager didn't give into full demands reasoning once again Accidents happen  European tourists leaving tables woman confronted table said snobby way If restaurant wants pay entire bill then pay it! She walked off before friend chance say anything back  Apparently walked away table without paying any bill even deduction   Before conclude I'd note food truly excellent even if incident didn't happen would still rant rave service received  Oh yeah did mention food excellent?  Why through long story? Because highlights only wonderful customer service but also human understanding  wait staff management Taqueria Canonita clearly above beyond expectations towards customers  extremely accommodating did everything power rigid situation smooth spite some bitchy customers    did gentlemen  ended giving them $50 tip $90 dollar bill   Thank Taqueria Canonita truly exceeding expectations delivering outstanding customer service  <EOR> Canonita love !
