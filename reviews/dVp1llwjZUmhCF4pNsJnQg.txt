Incredible   eaten almost every vegan restaurant town place blew mind   Its nasty part town but when walked felt Mandalay Bay   Everything great but especially tried far Reuben Buffalo amazing   gone back every week far since first discovered amazing place  <EOR> I am glad place exists! Nothing finding vegan restaurant where menu catered around your choices attempting piece together decent vegan meal around appetizers sides most mainstream places  definitely back now reason 3 star rating  First    how drinks check if menu item available purchase? say NEVER restaurant essentially cannot provide listed menu  eaten many places costs meal expectation service up    not service down  Strange! Another thing service  slow ask things napkins syrup spoons ice cream     why ask spoons    for ice cream??? also VERY loud   music blasting    I am assuming because located under flight path McCarran Airport    I suggest bringing pen paper using sign language stop Lakeshore Learning buy those learning sets elementary school kids use    it's phone system 8 kids teacher plug sets it sits middle table hear another speak through phone piece      yeah    get those    because communication even staff exchange loud almost yelling interaction Still thou     food pretty darn good  <EOR> Went TMV today  Great ambiance service  gave 3 stars because looking forward V'eggs Benny but when started eating way spicy  dish looked real deal but If TMV going dishes spicy people need decide if want that  Eating your eyes very very important but enjoying you're eating just important   We back hopefully chef notice advice  <EOR> We friends town came visit us  said want treat meal exchange some show tickets  took them TMV  told them became vegan 2 years ago immediately told the kids won't eat vegan    Strange kids 5 9 don't even know vegan is       kids pouting because parents already poisoned views vegan food kinda presented vegan nasty word them  kids pouted whole time restaurant  parents ordered mac cheese kids didn't touch saying don't flavor  tried tasted amazing  Anyways server found kids didn't touch food took items off bill  very nice gesture  husband Chicken Waffles cleaned plates  really appreciate TMV's staff looking customers  <EOR> This place absolutely amazing!

Thanks Gia Todd amazing food hospitality!! <EOR> Amazing Spot  NEW everything made FRESH patient long food takes but WELL WORTH wait  <EOR> I really wanted place first time loved food thought little overpriced but portions good size most part service okay but didn't matter since food tasty  Came back soon food great well service little off then add 20% gratuity even when flag your server down wait each individual plate come but whatever okay  third maybe last time sat bar  experience worst server think name Steffon pretty rude right beginning why? don't know we're always pretty nice  bf ordered burrito chicken few minutes later server came told the kitchen messed order put meat crumbles instead chicken if want send back your order take 15 min um what? Why didn't just them redo customer wanted least nice but bf accepted since didn't want wait 15 min  Food alright breakfast burrito cold  bf never complains but today first time heard say something bad service food  When finished server gave check very rudely  Good thing bf paid left tip because wouldn't have  really hope TMV better service  Otherwise people start notice come  Again really wanted place but service don't think will  <EOR> Update accidentally deleted TMV response laughing food poisoning telling could possibly happened look everything else ate day  let know only place ate all day last table day   certainly hope reviewing handling prep practices   posted picture your Queso earlier showed topped red green peppers   Ours came big glob shredded lettuce which where think problem came only thing shared besides cheesecake  Probably substitution ran ingredients     I would sincerely thank your concern suggest some customer service training may order well when comes handling dissatisfied customers     Let start saying really looking forward place opening really wanted great   Any new opening going challenges   explain 1 star rating upfront    wife ate Saturday afternoon two words food poisoning   She sick first nowhere  6 hours ate quickly followed suit    getting sick all night   dish shared Queso dip   We 1 30 PM did seated until 3 PM   Tables full several Reserved signs them no people   very noticeable no food coming kitchen   tables started emptying would seat anyone because kitchen backed up  also turning people away door restaurant half empty   We able order 3 PM placed entire order once would wait any longer necessary   most first choices finally just asked server did instead continuing told out   ordered Queso appetizer Ruben meatball sub Cheese Cake Sampler     The Queso very strong Nutritional Yeast taste   ur desert came 10 minutes before saw sandwiches   Definitely timing issues may worked over time   wife really liked Ruben   meatballs Meatball Sub well seasoned   sandwich supposed melted Mozzarella    came looked Daiya shredded Mozzarella ice cold    cheese cake fine   Kind play Peanut Butter Jelly      The Hostess spent most time apologizing   Does appear ready   alreay talking giving TMV another shot during he week unfortunately die food poisoning going back  <EOR> This some gourmet food! Amazing!!! Friendly staff fun atmosphere! This place worthy 5 stars but there's no meals under 10$ could find menu  lot vegan also chosen live more humble lifestyle would nice if least 8$ meal menu those can't afford wonderful feasts offer!  I highly recommend place! new favorites! <EOR> If sum restaurant sentence slightly overpriced place serves delicious comfort food style vegan dishes LOT them    The menu HUGE  However if dive into you'll find familiarity each item becomes less daunting  Imagine PT's or Gold Sierra's menu substitute protein cheese those sandwiches burgers appetizers vegan meat vegan cheese    We ordered Queso Dip mac cheese lobster roll buffalo chicken burger  amazing think none dishes made animal protein  seasoning creative usage different types veggies alone brought layers flavors  reason 1 less star 1 price  know eating Vegan little more expensive but everything $2 $3 less menu keep hook back weekly basis 2 fine details  If pay price expected little bit more refinement each dish talking presentation garnish final touches etc  Is place eat super healthy think Panacea ? Probably not  But place satisfy your cravings convince your meat eating friends or yourself vegan doesn't mean bland food? Absolutely! <EOR> First staff REALEST  Calm  Cool  Collected  Honest recommendations attentive yet respectful space   Second food absolutely stunning  chicken waffles best meals ever had  also Mac n cheese balls which lot bigger expected!

Food amazing came quickly  Staff friendly decor perfect  can't wait try everything menu! <EOR> Sucks didn't try food due terrible service  ask host waitress    took 15 min just water orange juice  <EOR> This breakfast brunch lunch spot sorely needed  every day does wish trek Terrace Pointe Cafe Wynn Downtown Vegenation some vegan breakfast  honest Modern Vegan's menu selection portion sizes flavors blow all other options water   Today Grand Opening definitely still some kinks work out 1hr + wait times food blenders arrived yet smoothies broken juicer etc   but honestly restaurant doesn't crazy first day month?  The food WORTH WAIT  Let stress that  ordered quite few items when finally did come heaven  <EOR> We frenchie #1 skillet  food amazing! But  since just opened haven't worked all kinks  <EOR> Let start happy am see vegan place Vegas someone thats visiting no option cook hotel its great    Pros ambiance cleanliness king burguer pattie Absolutely gorgeous Cons chicken pattie they told its gardene usually but absolutely tasteless batter around tasted flour The menu bit confusing  I wish another day town give restaurant more chance  <EOR> If come back Vegas eat again  Highly recommend eating vegan not  buffalo chicken sandwich amazing  haven't good buffalo chicken since going vegan but definitely  close  restaurant clean host very nice  Made sure everything came great! Very big menu choose from  <EOR> Damn  REALLY wanted behind place because love when new vegan joints open want love them support them but unfortunately kind missed mark  I've tried place twice now unfortunately don't think returning   The first time came tried Frenchie V'eggs Benedict side Baked Mac n Cheese   Hunnie Bunnie liked French toast mac n cheese pretty good own cheese sauce very CHEESE LIKE SAUCY! But V'eggs Benedict DRENCHED sauce scrape most off dish itself rather flavorless   The second time came tried several items Spaghetti Meatballs enough sauce flavor   Eggplant Bolognese enough sauce flavor either   Buffalo Chick'n sandwich pretty freakin good but honestly isn't when drenched delicious sauce?  Popcorn chicken appetizer pretty good well tasted actual popcorn chicken   Mashed potatoes Barely warm no flavor   Onion rings breading wouldn't stay save its' life ZERO flavor  does come dipping sauce but should good flavor WITHOUT sauce   I also asked side cheese sauce because wanted dip fries when sandwich but brought popcorn chicken    They brought appetizer first cheese sauce which thought odd because wanted cheese sauce dip fries when sandwich   And rest food kind trickled out  mashed potatoes side  then two pasta dishes little later then onion rings then finally sandwich dragged because server thought ordered something else   I really wish could ranted raved amazing place is  menu huge looks great potential but food expensive flavorless  Chep said The worst food he's Las Vegas ten years  wouldn't say but wasn't GOOD  <EOR> The outside place kinda threw off but when stepped completely forgot where was  place definitely modern  ordered vegan chicken waffles  Believe hype  vegan chicken waffles  DIE FOR  Plus mashed potatoes vegan bacon under such delicious surprise perfectly it  sister law ordered fish tacos which she enjoyed but then wished she also ordered chicken waffles when she taste mine  She also ordered espressi espresso rum drink delicious just one! can't wait back  staff very sweet helpful  <EOR> We visiting Vegas recently gone Vegan! happy find Modern Vegan!

Your prices unfriendliness don't justify 3rd rate strip mall experience  <EOR> Initial wait table wasn't bad considering arrived peak brunch time Saturday 11 30 12ish   think just rush eating mobs people waiting outside   5 tables reserved when arrived 4 them remained reserved during entire time which 1 5 hours   reserve them really early don't cancel reservations when they're late  Unfortunate since looks lost business due wait times being long   Food came pretty fast like no way could all made order fast fast   chicken waffles because benedicts  huge tasty   but really cold  Looks other people same issue dish    Ordered cheesecake trio to go  cheque took long time    I am sure kinks work better  Everyone really nice kept apologizing way things going general  <EOR> Amazing food  Even non vegan family liked food  Definitely recommend it  Can't wait back try more food  service good ambiance great  <EOR> This place everything spot!

Unfortunately times gone they're half menu items  matters worse you're told they're til you've already placed your order  common problem restaurants big menu  think  case TMV haven't learned manage inventory because large  probably need pair down bit  They should however inform customers right when they're seated rather order  Today told issue 'the waffle iron broke ' Weird right? Because restaurant should more one  just buy another real quick Target around corner  Because Fathers' Day weekend likely kind busy brunch  Just record also vanilla ice cream other items too  I want place work  just need figure issue stop disappointing people  <EOR> This actually really delicious! Buffalo burger Nice spice  Drink Pink Crush best drink!!! price portion drink thought seemed little high  Don't mind paying if atleast little larger  But drink absolute Best! Service really good! People really nice place clean but COLD! <EOR> On sunny Friday afternoon day its grand opening decided drive half hour try hot new restaurant boasting vegan comfort food  an offering isn't widely available Las Vegas other vegan friendly cities  Let start saying menu overwhelming number options although nothing compared infamous Cheesecake Factory Bible thank goodness    As sat down starkly white monochromatic IKEA furnished establishment thought myself ordering JUST few dishes would devastating  But smiling server greeted she mentioned long list items of  quite frank indeed blessing  less choose less conflict taste buds! limited yet still quite varied list choices allowed enjoy three following items Louisiana fried chicken mashed potatoes gravy no coleslaw me! vegan lobster roll mountain French fries heaping side baked mac cheese   Now quite sure establishment but found endearing  Maybe Möckelby table far end room? millions pillows nesting lonely couch? strange chain curtains separating bar? Perhaps wooden shelves hidden plain sight sound early 2000s Mariah melting into background modern atmosphere? Stepping into Modern Vegan forget you're Nellis immediately immersed into different world only reminder being your 8 year old vehicle parked outside window   How much enjoy eating? If answer lot then wait time could critical factor your experience  found ours relatively short  mere 15 minutes ordering baked mac cheese set front served piping hot cast iron pan  quintessential crumb top layer mac cheese best known for  while thought lacked cheesiness needed pinch salt did fact eat every single piece elbow pasta pan  vegan lobster roll didn't taste much seafood counterpart but thought lobster mixture itself refreshing tasty  Add mountain fried potato strips    must admit never once met French fry didn't like    The true star though fried chicken   many a vegan fried chik'n's past few years eating plant based diet give one  Modern Vegan nails batter seasoning overall flavor  just right  crisp but somehow light couldn't help but think chunk soy protein isolate could possibly dare say it    moist? spring sunny day March somebody Modern Vegan kitchen knew work deep fryer  pepper y gravy some fluffy mashed potatoes complimented crunchy crispy tender flavorful vegan chicken  content  No animals harmed   The portions met American standard   much licking each plate clean thought ordering list desserts would overkill two rather petite individuals  Nevertheless knowing even choice plenty promising  Seriously check those desserts! While Modern Vegan perfect times reminiscent club potential such great asset Las Vegas vegan community  am definitely returning Modern Vegan bigger party try way through menu  Give shot! sure you'll find something you'll like  <EOR> i'm vegan but now favorite go to place food  BFF Burger desert crush drink highly recommend both  best friend came she looking vegan burger over year she said took prize!! she great american burger <EOR> I am ecstatic comfort food vegan type place town warm welcome  sat down look menu first decided eat based all selections   saw other people reviewed restaurant being several items did run into problem  ordered loaded fries chocolate shake Buffalo chicken burger burger macaroni cheese fucking delightful   only think mention chocolate shake description stated would coconut whipped cream top which did   didn't care though lol am easy please bomb hell way  French fries loaded cheese sauce which love burgers extremely flavorful each distinct taste  am very excited try everything menu  Last thing portions huge plenty food take home excited more vegan food ! <EOR> Nice looking place but food good    try mac n cheese balls don't any flavor super dry   I waiting 25 minutes food gave 10% discount thanks!

Maybe you're newly converted vegan would give your left turnip spicy buffalo chicken sandwich maybe you're super lactose intolerant could KILL some queso dip  maybe you've vegan4lyfe want convert some your omnivore friends over green side  All good reasons patron  <EOR> The menu extensive which awesome but food ordered mostly just ok wait crazy  Between waiting seat waiting food spent 2 hours there     People came orders first table ordered two exact same items did  those items told sold but other table able grab last two  Felt there's probably issue communication timing between front house back house staff    I ordered Louisiana fried chicken  chicken good tasted pretty realistic although hoped more chicken  entree included large serving coleslaw but pretty light dressing  mashed potatoes coconut flavor which didn't care for I'd suggest switch using more neutral plant milks creams such items  Gravy ok  Mac cheese side again ok  mom ordered Philly cheesesteak which pretty good  Fries bad large serving but slightly mushy   I opening weekend though expected slow service some kinks worked out  happy try again few weeks   happy owner's husband asked enjoyed meal  hope learn lot opening weekend kinks worked soon  Overall just happy there's another vegan restaurant Las Vegas! <EOR> Im vegan but girlfriend eaten every vegan place vegas  far best vegan place vegas!! menu selection biggest selection ever seen vegan restaurant  food excellent service fast friendly  loved it! definitely  come back!! <EOR> Menu impressive but server let know right away most items  Food O K  breakfast burrito potato's came COLD burrito wasn't even wrapped eat fork knife Service pretty bad  rude anything but own world attentive all  Took 10 min bring hot sauce burrito maple syrup waffles  When asked syrup server seemed confused oh more syrup? When literally nothing waffles  Overheard owner telling customers she doesn't care bad reviews she reply tell them never come back    don't know why would take pride that  Extremely loud too  Don't expect able talk whoever your with  There's lot better vegan restaurants LV    <EOR> This place amazing! Everyone works friendly helpful attentive  food delicious portions satisfying selection overwhelming! employees recommended buffalo chicken sandwich  perfection! also strawberry shake banana which perfect sweet end meal   coming back! <EOR> Finally fully vegan spot  near me! looking forward TMV while now really really wanted and hopefully eventually give spot 5 stars but 3 best could now  explain    The interior great very clean modern just name suggests  tv screens above bar play various viral videos quite entertaining  employee uniforms grey sweats? Interesting   at least comfy work  menu extensive which would good if every single item point otherwise might better just narrow menu down best tasting items  bit pricey! am used ordering 2 dishes when eat because try everything but $15 plate may just stick dish here   I come 2 past 3 days  first day came boyfriend  pleased see busy place was  ordered biscuits gravy cosmopolitan smoothie he ordered French toast orange juice  When waitress came OJ asked status smoothie which she replied don't smoothies  showed smoothie menu then she turned bartender stop making alcoholic Cosmopolitan she thought ordered  waitress then informed smoothies fresh juices açaí bowls available restaurant yet  just glass water  Moments later waitress comes back tell run biscuits  changed order breakfast burrito  Meanwhile hear owner kitchen yelling 4 different menu items run of  food arrived decent time considering pretty hectic here  boyfriend enjoyed French toast but breakfast burrito cold touch  waitress took back see if kitchen could warm up  When came back second time spot burrito slightly warmer but rest burrito still cold  even cheese melted  waitress apologized asked if wanted order something else but time just hungry tired waiting I'd rather just eat part cold wrap potatoes wait something else  took burrito home later warmed oven good that   toasted tortilla melty cheese good!  I learned vegan Facebook group TMV made mistake having mock service even soft opening  decided give them another shot  Today total 3 us  Walking noticed tables weren't busy previous day  7 open tables 4 reserved signs however 4 parties 2 3 people waiting sat  Maybe they're understaffed seat those people? Anyways excited finally those biscuits gravy!! Except ran out  friend ordered French toast   ran too  V'eggs Benny? Ran out  V'eggs Florentine? Nope  Any kind pancakes?? guessed it   there's no more   We ended ordering Avocado Toast Trifecta Anna waffles Gia waffles Lobster Roll  avocado toasts good but little salty taste  Both waffles came cold if fridge  friends asked if could something done waffles warmer which waitress remarked only ones say that  She took waffles back kitchen but when waffles came back still much warmer  While cold first time still fresh waffle maker warm  Maybe cold wind coming through open door kitchen rapidly cooling down food? cold toppings cooling down waffles? Besides temperature waffles themselves good taste  Meanwhile felt bad friends because more enjoying lobster roll! might far say best lobster roll ever had! could wrong but seems though lobster made hearts palm giving perfect texture  fries come quite yummy well   Towards end meal Todd came table  He explained wife's restaurant apologized any inconveniences might experienced  absolutely LOVE he came table  other restaurants which owner avoid table if see potentially unhappy customer  Because Todd delicious lobster roll continue support TMV  Todd explained restaurant waiting some equipment ship start serving fresh juices smoothies açaí bowls  am obsessed açaí bowls definitely back when become available  sure business continues TMV work all little kinks improve over time  <EOR> This place just opened there's always room improvement    lot dishes picked didn't some sides ended trying them  food very well presented obviously tasted good  variety dishes very impressive  only downside wait time    expect 20 30min seating another 20 30 actual food  If kitchen staff grows then maybe come back  <EOR> This spot located near UNLVs Thomas Mack Center  outside restaurant deceiving since just black white signs TMV windows  When open door walk ambiance shifts reminded place called LIME SF  Pretty much daytime club  first time morning  music loud portions large  shared Breakfast Potato Skins ordered Lobster Roll bf Chik'n Waffles  All which amazing! No to go box needed  service okay server seemed new serving but no complaints   The second time came during first late night service hours  pulled around 2am  late night menu shorter version main menu but still plenty options choose from  time jerk sandwich he reuben  Again amazing   and unbelievably vegan  No box needed again! owner asked everything during visit mighty delicious! definitely back more often  <EOR> The waitress Rachel believe helpful  Really didn't customer service all  system glitched friends food wasn't cooked time everyone else table 5 others done eating  She said she didn't want anymore  time ready her  But all ready go  Instead offering free waiting kitchen staff seen eating food open! No came apologize  husband spoke manager because he hunted down employee waiting check 15 minutes  waitress just wasn't attentive table whatsoever  But way she very terrible attitude saying goodbye most condescending tone voice    The owner offered 10% off next visit  won't next time  high hopes but lack professionalism   won't spend another $50 there    Food ideas great  Fry appetizer literally fries lettuce cheese sauce  Jerk burger flavorless  Mac n cheese sweet overpriced  would back if service wasn't crap but don't seem concerned just yet  <EOR> With every new restaurant kinks need worked out  However training your servers work smarter before opening must   We sat around 1120 she asked if wanted coffee  answer yes  only issue she brought coffee milk  She didn't bring sugar water  She back brought sugar  Didn't come back 15 minutes  Then she came back ask if wanted more coffee  said yes before she ran away which she process of ask if could order  Mind almost 30 minutes without even having ordered  She acted little surprised hadn't ordered which doesn't surprise she clearly forgot   I didn't high expectations going into because every grand opening issues   It took 5 minutes bring water ordered 35 minutes into service  Our food point ordered took 45 1 hour  ordered 4 dishes all came separate times  Which fine  Except tables way food way before even left before anything eat    Again work service industry  understand grand openings essentially trial runs  wish more soft openings train staff before grand opening  server clearly no experience while she sweet quite skilled makeup she without question needs more training  I service industry 10 years now please understand am obviously lot more critical most    Only other qualm jalapeño poppers difficult eat way served  wish cut half  Hope kinks worked because I'd love back take 2 hours receive all food! Again expected  But also little disappointing  <EOR> Everything place perfect upon entry greeted friendly hostess seated  inside decor restaurant modern clean handed quite large menu huge variety options  waiters nice very attentive when your food extremely good looking tasty cannot believe food vegan definitely best place eat since became vegan  return! <EOR> I surprised find modern vegan open all hours came concert definitely ready grab  ordered fried peanut butter jelly but wasn't biggest fan  other people chicken nachos both those delicious  definitely recommend place any vegan anybody vegan well tasted delicious  <EOR> As vegan sad say very disappointed experience here  weary place because GIGANTIC menu  menu huge allllll over place  waffles pad Thai poutine? think restaurants usually better off sticking smaller menus having few amazing dishes rather dozens just okay dishes  think definitely problem here    My boyfriend ordered three dishes poutine Louisiana chicken lobster roll  poutine best dish bunch but still wasn't great  First all appetizer portion MASSIVE  fries seemed unsalted bit under done  cheese gravy just ok nothing memorable  Louisiana chicken dish similar  nothing more just ok  fried chicken looked good but just didn't taste quite right  lots vegan fried chicken variety restaurants but tastes something buy frozen heat your microwave  coleslaw also good also tasted something you'd grocery store  mashed potatoes probably best part dish but still nothing I'd back for  lobster roll looked great but taste texture just    awful  never send food back but dish especially considering high prices here  took off check no problems really appreciated that  Although didn't enjoy food much want say everything plated quite beautifully! Besides food service pretty good everyone very nice  decor wasn't bad however confusing feel  mixed together fancier restaurant fast casual cafe  gigantic bar but such small kitchen which just didn't sense me  If restaurant closes 6pm huge bar really necessary? worked cook couple different restaurants cannot begin fathom cook everything menu tiny kitchen  blows mind  currently work restaurant menu 1 3 size menu but kitchen 3x size theirs! probably part reason quality food lacking  feel owners might come food service background maybe just ambitious?   Overall really really wanted place hate see vegan business poorly  However  think there's lot things need fixed restaurant live its potential  much smaller more focused menu revamping kitchen maybe bringing someone more experience industry place could successful  <EOR> This first time vegas area  job requires fly every three months  recently turned vegan amazed numerous vegan spots around Henderson area  heard great reviews Modern vegan via yelp  tried myself  5 stars! soon u arrive parking lot tell place going delicious   decor detail place matches menu  arrived around 4 friendly hostess greeted me  ordered mac n cheese balls but ran also ran sweet potatoes fries  When heard knew place poppin  waitstaff bartenders absolutely most friendliest people wait me    Now let's talk food! jalapeño poppers baked mac n cheese!
