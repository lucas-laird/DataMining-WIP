Why would assume party five people all walked separately would want same check?    mention people group already paid drinks before he left but charged those drinks AGAIN five person check  whole experience weird unprofessional unlike any bar ever to  almost felt if bartenders thought ones inconveniencing THEM  definitely won't returning doubt friends either   The only good thing say bar USB ports built into sides bar used charge your phone  concept   Also props bartender Ryan took over two girls left actually decided take care us  real MVP Ryan  <EOR> Good place play some pool some drinks just relax fun  Karokie if want  Nice place hang your friends  <EOR> Used come when tenaya creek brewery awesome then  Everyone very personable very fun place be  new pts today asked happy hour specials bartender said none just pizza  said really?
