excellent rest food tasted  fried green tomatoes came only 3 slices but literally good New Orleans  kidding order them  <EOR> I feel sort bad but only ended tipping waitress $1 here  honestly think she deserved lot less cent  did tip bus boy $10 though let tell why   I truly high hopes so called 'classic' Vegas restaurant but just disappointed    We quickly assisted finding seats soon walked in  move another table because table given very wobbly  weird kind expected deal instead finding solution just leaving table way  told them clumsy needed different table   Our bus boy great refilled drinks several times  kind cute mason jars  waitress however unacceptable  While she taking order she left middle man talking speak another customer just walking in  She came back 30 seconds later didn't even apologize interrupting him  worst part she order wrong  going corrected but ended deciding to  would probably going mess didn't want deal any longer   I did however ask smothered gravy sauce she failed bring smothered gravy chicken  She came table irritated said sorry very unapologetic matter if fault she forgot bring it  She didn't check entire meal unlike other waiting staff there  only time she polite when she brought check which another employee since she around   As far food fried chicken better okay not better Roscoe's Cali but sides absolutely horrid  mac cheese no flavor collard greens tasted if no spices added them  think could better home even Southern cook  mashed potatoes edible but  it  didn't corn cakes but first time having them   I way better Southern food Las Vegas  opinion could your filling Southern food elsewhere  <EOR> Food decent waitress nice but wait time insane   by time food wanted there   may try again sometimes all bad days    <EOR> Came visit Cali graduation  am huge foodie all over GREAT food  brother once lived Vegas ranted place  ordered following 1 Gumbo very watery only flavor tasted similar white pepper  no gumbo file flavor gumbo

server informed freshly made but failed inform freshly made Kool Aid Lemonade  KooL all         The place very clean the waitress made certain choosing broom over service located desolate tiny plaza somewhat industrial area heavy traffic  lack ambiance   To fair lack great food other strip lack ambiance Vegas  Therefore food alignment other eateries but think good never again visit Vegas  <EOR> I
