Well case following review drop you!   The wife read Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine Yelper reviewed  planning trip Vegas figured would try something different opposed usual buffets would normally head straight for  Innocently enough made B Line straight Chang's once arrived Vegas anticipating decent Dim Sum experience  Once left standing Foyer few minutes  During time noticed servers arrived late behind hadn't chance clock before she sat us  just found kinda funny thought would share you! = As Brunch progressed wife really tiffed because best Chinese team terms timing follow through Dim Sum industry decided would all take day off allow lack luster slow incompetent crew work solid day  Whoa me!   Service slow tea order really late food sub par most all hot chili sauce late! loves some hot chili sauce Dim Sum dumplins!  I think highlight experience when wife finally threw towel flagged down Chinese lady berated God knows what! couldn't tell she said but service surely improved point on! God love feisty Chinese women!   The Dim Sum itself memorable chicken feet worst things because tasted breaded before braising   felt tasted gummy     The prices great its location easy find! wasn't tucked corner some sleezy shopping plaza may impossible into out  to!   The final note all all way come back here  think only way would if friend clocked over head baseball bat preferably metal  my head might shatter wooden then left cleaning bits splintered wood carpet headache! wants that?! bribe paramedics drop off rather Hospital  Maybe way wouldn't mind mediocre tasting food but I'd probably bleed before chili sauce! = <EOR> We visit restaurant every time Las Vegas   may Decatur but drive prevent tasting great Dim Sum   Chinese fast food best   party 4 great meal within 30 minutes   price right   need careful well kept secret   If wrong time just wait 90 minutes   prepared people wait eat there  <EOR> Be careful overcharging  charged tea even though didn't order  didn't add tip when pay but tea removed added 10$ tip  Shady place  recommend anyone back  <EOR> If Vegas want dim sum I'd say forget it!  Food despite packed house primarily Chinese decidedly mediocre fresh even hot   MUCH better LA San Diego New York etc  No way would consider going back  <EOR> Just wanted start off saying usually huge fan Dim Sum since everything super oily isn't fresh  However Chang's pleasant surprise  serve usual dishes all chinese dim sum restaurants offer exception dessert buns oh good  dont know call them english but essentially white buns yellow sugar filling  main reason why we'll coming back  other dishes better average didn't nauseous feeling eating   Maybe finally found chinese restaurant did right! <EOR> They serve best Dim Sum Vegas   food fresh service warm choice big price very reasonable   Vegas very often but if always Dim Sum there  <EOR> $1 99 limited time only small medium large dim sum plate   Their food good   Cheapest good quality dim sum Las Vegas!

I also ordered some takeout bring back fiance wasn't able but nonetheless still wanted dim sum  Here's only part entire meal bothered me  flagged down waiter could separate take out order he probably most inexperienced unhelpful server could found restaurant  He couldn't speak any Mandarin Cantonese some difficulty describing wanted since usually don't think dim sum dishes English  Then when figured English names dishes wanted called he told he going someone else because many orders remember  Gee didn't realize four items would hard remember especially when all staple dim sum foods    I ended going cashier counter order  time placing order super easy because lady understood Chinese but somehow took them 20 minutes gather four things wanted  highly doubt waiting anything cooked because saw multiple carts come exactly ordered  Ugh  Annoying   Overall still fun excursion but there's lot could've done better especially regarding service  usually cut Asian restaurants some slack service because tends great but some things just ridiculous overlook  <EOR> I just dinning restaurant Because  customer since Anita Mui brother running it Mr  Chang paking lady now new Over all food good When tonight no empty After seated We seat over 10 mins no give tea So call waiter the long hair one  He looks happy when told need tea manu  Look come he happy Attitude We come dinning give bussiness And no any customer here You work hour work tips waiter i should time T hinking why no now we just eat fast finish it yes food average no free soup desert here not other restaurant china town Yes long hair waiter I back why spend money bad service  Bussiness need return castomers  Yea he did seen 2 people because hair 10 inches long covered face <EOR> Surprisingly no wait Dim Sum noontime Saturday   People hanging around outside entry restaurant  Many empty tables inside   Sorry must spoiled other places  Spare ribs Woo Kok rolled chow fun Chinese Broccoli all cold  tasty  Even 1st pot tea warm hot   The most notable dishes Dim Sum available Sui Mai Haw Gow  What's that?

Right!   The food ok flavors just some stuff didn't taste same would expect very other restaurant good way green onions shrimp dumpling  example every dim sum know crispy pan fried wrap outside FRESH green onion crunchy flavor inside juicy shrimp meat stuffing right? But no weird meatball slimy green onion inside bad but weird  crispy fried crab dumpling also ok but enough flavors would ultimate rating some suppose key item dim sum dishes just wasn't mostly lacked flavor tasted different  Other sticky rice wrapped leaves ok again enough flavors  order calamari fried rice kitchen which does open till 11 30am if early don't expect able order rice anything kitchen  But when did those items calamari skip but fried rice actually really freaking good  crispy taro good BBQ pork pie really good name few OMG try Custard puffy pie thing dessert  item alone friend keep business  best thing ever tasted continue come back just anything else!   So if want try try it  Just know well experience little everything because great selection  food hit miss service 5 stars but expect  prices little bit better then most places but then again food other places worth extra pennies some items really good  run back try dim sum menu but definitely run back Custard cream puff pies!!! <EOR> My friend dragged place when really mood dim sum  glad he did ended having great meal  plenty variety everything very affordable  food traditional Hong Kong style dim sum  didn't try many fusion dishes try put anything usually served dim sum  nothing innovative but still very good  usual caveats Chinese restaurant apply  Most tables big  group 4 sat table could easily sat 8 10  Also your hot tea always refilled but good luck getting ice water   I back again relatives few weeks later  great experience  think part because arrived early  carts all same items  time leaving some items remembered first visit started coming out  I'd recommend place but don't come early although may difficult because very busy  <EOR> We arrived 10 35 am they open 10 30 place already half full     time left 11 15 packed   Prices can't food good      We'd tried Cathay House prior visit Vegas Chang's definitely much better par San Francisco New York Boston   A prior Yelper noted worn carpet thought pretty good shape compared some other dim sum places been      nature business I'd scared if new  <EOR> So glad found restaurant last week  Delicious Dim Sum!

Normally biggest gripe dim sum places venues normally huge dining hall areas servers cart around food forever food gets cold time no longer fresh  Chang's restaurant small enough venue food ALWAYS fresh especially if table next where carts come kitchen    I few recommendations best dim sum dishes  Definitely fried pork dumplings ham shay go   favorite dish there! less $4 per order which comes 3 fried pork dumplings  also really Chinese pan friend leek buns gow choi   less widely known dish but equally amazing  Also less $4 per order! Other recommendations include salt pepper shrimp calamari chinese broccoli pork shrimp siomai har gao shrimp dumpling   If stick items you'll set  gone dinner before isn't best Chinese restaurants sure just lunch dim sum don't bother regular menu items only reason rate place 4 star versus 5 star    We love all dim sum items dreams them  No joke  places always back visit when travel Las Vegas  far away strip if tourist  where locals don't dim sum casinos  Trust one  <EOR> I've Chang's probably half dozen times but today different because new ownership  Super nice guy looked pretty young    Came during lunch rush which wasn't bad since table right away  Har gow shumai both delicious   steamed sticky rice pork BBQ buns sesame balls beef chow fun fried noodles Chinese broccoli  Pretty good Las Vegas    This place sort hidden gem since doesn't even come list dim sum places Vegas    This place smaller Orchid but think slightly better quality   Haven't bothered trying casino dim sum spots since sure push carts imagine paying double    This place good terms service quality value  definitely back if coconut jello haupia! <EOR> This nice place dim sum Sunday brunch  pretty busy lunchtime Sundays but always manages seated immediately   Their shumai bao delicious  Chicken feet anyone? Yum! carts constantly going around if dish request isn't cart they'll usually inform many minutes before gets back on  ladies pushing carts pretty helpful  Some may speak hardly any English but try explain if ask dishes are  Keep paper food tally easily accessible servers your table  ladies come stamp your food order then you'll take window entrance when you're done pay meal    The food relatively cheap most orders under $5 never ask much each dish costs  sure ask large glasses water bring tiny ones  might come check if need tea refill but if happen run just signal more turning over tea pot lid propping ajar  works some times   Their service significantly better other dim sum places visited  Service Chinese restaurant?  huge  <EOR> Woah hold up    $2 99 all dim sum? definitely stopped did double take banner advertisement hung right above entrance  Rubbed eyes stared again $2 99 still there  Talk great deal!   Although haven't place while once loyal customer  fridge still holds family photo taken close ten years ago  No matter much time Chang's always same same atmosphere same friendly folks  thing different time quality food which sorry say gone way down  Even $2 99 price tag doesn't justify such flavorless dim sum Out 10 items ordered only thing good custard pineapple buns strangely actually some best ever had  Fresh oven crisp shell LEGIT custard filling  made salted egg yolk  hot runny custard best part there's much runs down your hand each bite! can't recommend anyone coming due lackluster food but if you're desperate dim sum low cash recommend try those pineapple buns above anything else  Also want note weird thing place walk cashier window pay your meal  never seen cashier window big dine restaurant before felt buying movie tickets something lol  But guy working super fast efficient though props that! I'd much rather walk pay wait forever someone pick card  Aside price friendly welcoming service honestly only other thing stopping giving lower rating  Maybe give place another try but anytime soon <EOR> Food good  Service poor  Considering am LA n SF residents place isnt good where live but workable area price availability  Overall ok  <EOR> I place food pretty authentic  Sat Sun 11 1 usually busiest time but wait bad all  Probably 15 20 minutes? beef tendon egg tart tofu dessert most  Most staff speak Chinese assume if look asian  prices pretty reasonable very similar other dim sum place town  Expect 20 25 bucks 2 if don't huge appetite  <EOR> Dim sum quality ok  family tried dim sum morning dinner well  think dinner menu better dim sum  Service good  come around often check customers  <EOR> Best Dim Sum town!  take all friends family visit Chang's dim sum grub on   Inexpensive fairly clean get's busy during weekend brunch hours  <EOR> I could've sworn wrote place already   It's fav Chinese spots town   I very wary coming because deserted  actually thought closed first time  crazy part dining room pretty big but don't surprised if only there  Normally very bad sign restaurant awful but took chances glad did   They some off wall plates daring mood decided try Bird's Nest  Sounds crazy but just seafood veggies chow mein ish bowl  chow mein noodle made into dried cracker bowl seafood just sits inside it  Just case bust ordered safe dish orange chicken   The food amazing  Bird's Nest very enjoyable fun eat! bowl soaks seafood juicies crunchy bite into chow mein satisfying  orange chicken tastes really good but over top flavors  give ton rice + hot tea really enjoyed service   I don't know stay business when empty all time  three times now most seen 1 table besides us  thinking   Perhaps secret hideout local Chinese gang basement beneath kitchen where mob players poker sip tsing tao plot next big heist  whole restaurant just front scheme  Hmm maybe but could care less  HA! returning near future  <EOR> As previous San Francisco resident am always look amazing Dim Sum place go  SF ha some best ever tasted! place recommended friend gave try   It really good! amazing but really good solid classic Dim Sum  Price point pretty good service very attentive  would back if asked   Still searching ultimate Dim Sum Sweet Spot come really close but continue adventure within Las Vegas!

What fuck right?  I don't know dog shit apple butter type food  Why reason   I load anything remotely appears beef peering through its doughy cocoon   Some tasty  Some very  cares  experiment eating far concerned   The tray comes around timed intervals it seems only second time lose track first round selections  needed plan  Methodically started end cart sampling everything  Five rounds later I'd enough  I spit half shit napkin  Anthony Bourdain not    The stuff good really good  Only forgot which pieces repeaters   This shit really confusing Dim Sum novice   The desserts tasty but can't tell ate  sweet weird texture   This exceptional experience repeat but going severely fucked before doing so   Smiling cart driver all head bobbing fantasizing turn century railroad magnate surrounded Coolie workers  <EOR> Yum! Love some dim sum  few times dim sum always fresh delicious  don't remember all names items but some usual suspects pork hash char siu bau shrimp balls tripe bean curd taro puffs scallop rolls   and many more  Everything tasty nothing complain about    The service hit miss though  ask refills small things utensils hot sauce  Sometimes staff come off rude but don't pay much attention unless someone blatantly yelling face  interior bit outdated cleanest parking tough during lunch rush  Overall would visit again while vacationing Vegas  <EOR> This new dim sum place when visit Las Vegas  ordered 12 items everything tasty  favorites are ginger chicken steamed buns beef rice noodles fried shrimp ball seafood steamed dumplings  took pretty long time bring food paying check kind pain but overall would recommend place  definitely back! <EOR> I declare Chang's only dim sum Las Vegas   comparison everything else just bunch mashed food stuff steam dishes   girlfriend probably 6 7 times only disappointment ever favorite crispy topped BBQ pork buns all gone   If slightest effort speak Chinese waitresses mostly Guangdong but all speak least okay Mandarin definitely understand all rudimentary things say fawn all over your buddies forever    don't even want try describing best dishes because won't even scratch surface   Just during lunch weekday order ton food say right  <EOR> Stoked find place Vegas!  Came Sunday definitely hit spot   place pumps business but seated right away   boyfriend stuffed ourselves bill less $25! Definitely great dim sum find!  come back next Vegas trip! <EOR> Good dim sum but occasion dinner found nail rice   Luckily spot spooning small individual rice bowl  told waiter switched entire rice but weren't really apologetic   Maybe if non asian restaurant would offered little more work loyalty customer retention   didn't   But didn't really suprise me   I dim sum now then good   always busy   Just watch when eat! <EOR> Terrible service asked refill water never received it  waitress asked actually water filled guest two tables over eye contact then turned around help every other tables  Watched good 15 minutes getting beverages others  Coincidently all spoke language told owner but he more interested collecting money talking other guest  <EOR> I only gotten dim sum time before sadly business   When friends called meet hesitant but figured why hell not? ]  ended being very good passive decision   The place packed but service moved very quickly   Everyone picking choosing pulling things off carts    great   try lot things first time including something shrimp rice paper  yeah lots foreign names no idea say nor spell    Everything also very reasonably priced   think most expensive thing 3 75 but many all full under $10 each  ]   Overall really good experience customer service super food really good! <EOR> O stars  Roaches!  eat unless roaches sharing your dim sum you! <EOR> Exterior establishment nice   think timing visit wasn't best prime time   1PM arrival only foods good ones steamer   Everything else cold   know when fresh but friends first time having some dim sum   I'll return another time  <EOR> Before began review let preface review saying literally eat almost any garbage enjoy it  For example once stored big macs back seat car ate them periodically through 1 week period during summer   ENJOYED THEM  HOWEVER Chang's dim sum something beyond stomach  The smell dim sum bad looked absolutely disgusting chicken feet look black   other order steam chicken looked if chicken growing some kind mold   Both chicken rice smelled chemicals rat poisoning   took two bites almost fainted other interesting thing 20 minutes eating two bites little sick   top all off server rude    And finally thing just almost cry Fortune cookie expired!!!!!! want change religion experience  AVOID PLACE PLAGUE BECAUSE YOU'LL SORELY DISAPPOINTED! <EOR> Who loves DIM SUM? love SUM! pretty good  liked best variety carts going around  also waitress walking around offering entrees such fried rice calamari    It somewhat busy but able food FAST  Because hunger think must spent 10 minutes inhaling food  only advice    slow down enjoy dim sum  Otherwise you'll end bloated full measly 10 minutes  HA! <EOR> I coming best freshest most variety dim sum over 15 years  stopped going other places because potential food poison high risk it! never anything except very positive experiences here! Please ALL Dim Sum Lovers Keep Chang's Alive thriving !!! Family Love Eating HERE <EOR> Went coworkers yesterday  ate everything!!! Food good carts came quite often  auto grat paid $17 each  Think slightly more usually spent dim sum places but only couple bucks most  all your typical dim sum choices  Nothing really stood me  negative no came refill water cups  disappointing  Other good meal  <EOR> This place pretty good dim sum but prepared wait table when open! other words weekend 10 30am  course once your table food comes don't long wait it   The salted fish fried rice awesome    pretty good chow fun too  pan fried egg noodles little bland though   I see place being great big groups even banquets  Service though typically rushed brusque  ***************************** Dinner totally different experience dim sum  restaurant practically empty night! Food still very good service more time smile check back you  <EOR> Having grown hong kong Singapore must admit dim sum excellent great value money  Staffed primarily Cantonese speaking staff adds authenticity    Food wise most tastes good regular restaurants grew Asia  egg tarts best pastry skin ever America even better many Asia  only downside steamed BBQ pork bun doesn't taste good perhaps due poor supply pork area  Fried buns excellent though   Value wise cheapest dim sum restaurants US  sum excellent choice great value  <EOR> If want good Chinese food place  Dim sum great  Right now think discount medium large plate $1 98 something during weekday  Beside dim sum come regular food  dish did eggplant dish way sweet  Other dishes pretty good  <EOR> WoW! This must best dim sum spot West Coast YET!!!! The taro puff beef churn fun shrimp balls absolutely delish! I also liked tofu dish lot layers w some awesome sauce  The green veggies I think called gai lan fresh  Also egg custard die for! Oh cannot forget dao fu fa sweet tofu dessert !!!  favorite! And if dim sum spot truly winner!!!   I believe place tastes close foods Hong Kong two thumbs here!!! Also w aunt uncle during busy Chinese New Year!!!  place pretty organize despite its busyness     totally worth wait yo!!! <EOR> I've fair share dim sum growing born raised cantonese household tell when good dim sum   Chang's good back next day more   Now older generation asian folks may think only so so but think Chang's pretty darn good city Las Vegas smaller Chinese community     I loved authentic atmosphere place   Everyone spoke Chinese waitresses in good o' trolley carts friendly   Service fast I hot sauce when ask it place clean for Asian place    love packed even 2pm because just adds upbeat atmosphere     Another bonus place decently priced   don't remember exactly many dishes friend but bill came around $21 w o tax ate heart's content     This place only 2 miles strip would recommend any tourists check especially if you're looking some authentic Chinese food   Restaurants strip pricey only show the food usually isn't great much you're paying   <EOR> This first Dim Sum experience less satisfied   As part non asian group felt frequently overlooked  Water glasses never refilled those pushing carts parked them table serve but leave carts chat other tables which left passed carts DID want food from   On plus side food did pretty good disappointed didn't pork buns most likely just because later day   ended being $27 three which think wasn't bad   Would again? Maybe  But next dim sum experience elsewhere before come back <EOR> Service really good here! table 10 people secluded area did ignore all!   Their duck shu mai I hope spelled right bombbb!!! also tried bbq prok buns drools good! definitely come back when around vegas! <EOR> Dim Sum isn't something often Vegas let alone eat  effort enjoy all city offer found myself Chang's recent weekend afternoon hope scoring something delicious  found expected all along average run mill yum cha experience   It's entirely fault all Las Vegas isn't overrun Chinatown isn't filled seedy adult joints gringofied Chinese spots without support demand larger community  Hence exterior gives away experience ahead time semi cheesy palatial looking front coupled retro sign screams Chinese Americana decades before   Inside Dim Sum scene within typical banquet hall few carts rounds usually couple steamed dishes others more fried pastries desserts  Once saw same 4 carts approached table very few staffers special dishes give experience variety going limited   Everything steamed fried bland  beloved shrimp dumplings har gow needed some serious hot sauce before could rip them mini bamboo baskets even when rice shell dry falling apart  same could applied fried pork dumplings ham sui gok which all its glutinous glory puffy thick but unfortunately lacking pork part skimpified guts side  All rice noodle wraps crepes cheurng fun all needed some sweet soy sauce help before consumption though same said lo mai gai siu mai fish + meat ball ngau yuk yuen lang yu kau    A surprisingly decent dish? stir fried rice noodle sesame seed  Soaked soy sauce topped sprinkling sesame seed peppers surprisingly flavorful light  fragrant texture silky smooth  piques curiosity other non cart noodle dishes  no one's surprise falls special price column Dim Sum receipt  <EOR> In humble opinion Chang's probably pretty authentic whether roll lunch dinner dim sum   definitely superior Strip offerings term value   If you're East LA then might find something complain shu mai being $2 instead $1 50   Sunday 11 30am dim sum wait time = 15 minutes   time left probably pushed 30 minutes   Most people fairly quickly   Service wise think Chang's slightly understaffed particularly non cart personnel water tea refills bill settlement   workers look little tired would bet case while probably don't plan staffing up   Another minor note cart ladies very keen doing visual style ordering   more laid back places show each dish offering especially if clearly Chinese    very handy knew least favorite dish names could understand non Chinese accent   am sure hurt ears but wanted   Hargow cha sau bau jiao tsu etc damn forgot Chinese romanization    am getting pinyin wade giles all mixed    definitely recommend taking native speaker least your favorite dish names memorized   Price wise probably more general price food restaurants going but think bit higher side   Overall would venture say place quite good your dim sum fixed though probably dim sum noobs  <EOR> Dim sum fresh 5 pm dim sum day reheated semi warm temperature steaming hot should prepared  Dim sum skin just broke into pieces when pick does right texture   The shrimp scallop dumpling I guess didn't ready made order earlier raw inside  shrimp still grey! Told unfriendly waiter he just took away without saying anything  course waiter manager did apologize trying kill us  Don't come if pregnant elderly weak immune system simply want food poisoning  <EOR> We came looking dim sum Monday around 1 30  understandable pretty late afternoon serving dim sum selection dismal    We selected most basic items rolling around  think only 2 carts      Nothing dim sum sticks pretty average  wish would came earlier better experience greater selection   I called ahead asking time stopped serving supposedly stop serving dim sum around 3 guess late comers what's left   Will come back next time re review when time comes  <EOR> Wow! Las Vegas dozen times never knew place existed    Hell didn't even realize strip next door Chinatown!!! Whaaaat!!!  This place opens 10 30am weekend  Dim Sum right when opened  food great  lot pastries Sesame Balls Barbeque Pork Pies fresh oven hot! Those GREAT!!! Seriously didn't realize difference but if comparison  Cookies fresh oven WAY better ones sitting around Sesame Balls  Sui Mai fresh but think chicken feet little over done  only bad thing say   The Good Very close strip taxi  Walking distance Orleans Casino Good Authentic Dim Sum Inexpensive Decent Friendly Service is possible Dim Sum? The Bad No taxi's readily area back strip  If walk Orleans taxi neighborhood gets little slummy  <EOR> As sit 20 mins now same cart comes around every 6 minutes  Shumai less    only three items inside  horrible  Worst dimsum place ever  sitting dish 20 mins  same dessert cart keeps coming around too  Why dessert when haven't even eaten yet? Also only dish sucks  bad  See pictures  Can't even food off plate because falling apart  Never again <EOR> I first time dim sum er?? hahaha suprised much food good was!!! everything chicken feet tofu sweet soup?? dont know name but delicious!!!  I sure ready dim sum again  service great also <EOR> Average foods service  enjoyed it  But attitude sucked  Let explain     I've once anxious return second visit  Dim sum meant eaten friends  surrounded myself friends each time   We all agree foods good ranging American fried foods steamed southern Chinese dumplings  nothing bad nothing outstanding  service par most big dim sum places  ambiance restroom   After we're done split cost paid tips  restaurant only accepted credit card minimal $20  all paid cash used CC  waitress chased group asking tips  just once but twice   There 2 problems here  First tipping gratitude  decide much tip influenced anyone else  If wait staffs lousy attitude don't tip most likely return regardless foods   Second if left tips table couldn't find fault?  It's audacious ask tips once being purely shameless  Twice? plain outrageous   So diners heed warning    very proud wait service let know if don't tip  Unfortunately service average expect instant reward  <EOR> Nothing beats eating dim sum morning partying all night Vegas  being spoiled eating many good dim sum places back home Monterey park Rowland area Chang's felt subpar me  all OC ppl visiting Vegas thinkin trying place would say comparable dragon phoenix Bolsa  ladies rollin cart around which don't really prefer because temperature items barely warm  Surprisingly though servers top here  don't really expect much service chinese restaurant but water cups never empty manager really friendly guy  later found speak cantonese once again used person order everything table because only spoke cantonese __ The place looked really clean chinese restaurant prices weren't bad   all dim sum basics such shu mai har gow chinese broccoli chicken feet etc  dim sum items such shu mai har gow bit small though  good thing don't think load MSG food wasn't salty  congee rip off though because barely any shredded dry pork fried donuts weren't ones back home The fried donuts dip congee crispy lot oil plate   Not bad place grab dim sum Vegas  friend said lot better Ping Pong Pang's <EOR> Finally came back few years restaurant introduced Dim Sum  Comparing say KJ they're probably good but definitely far price quality they're good enough    They all your usual favorites dim sum chicken feet bbq bun egg tarts etc all good  didn't anything bad definitely come back if craving dim sum!

Overall wouldn't suggest place dim sum  honestly only okay because certainly isn't worst place  <EOR> My husband daughter decided try different dim sum place other usual Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant Sahara when headed over Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine Decatur all much talked many friends   hard say whether place much better much worse usual   Some dim sum items tasted similar Orchid's some them tasted different little change two ingredients mix   instance prefer shrimp har gau over Orchid's but rather enjoy Orchid's wrapped rice over Chang's   wasn't good Chang's dim sum items carts didn't carry steam baskets goodness   eggplant fried shrimp all items plates weren't steamed served COLD!  Now if isn't kill palate then don't know is!  Ugh!  Very displeasing sure!  No expects food served cold that   We lunch during peak business lunch hour but seated immediately   ambiance quite different Orchids possibly due popularity place   sure Chang's very well received neighborhood busy place was busy meaning noisy  But course expect no less any Chinese restaurant  Although once again compare Orchid's lack noisiness thus lack popularity per se? hesitate wave down server pushing carts around   no means means rude disrespectful them   just way land many Chinese restaurants   no notion being rude any way wave away!  only way could dine pace wanted anyway   =o I gave them 3 star rating because food good albeit some served right temperature   service expected   ambiance nice experience good know people enjoy frequenting place   But say partial Orchid's probably won't back Chang's again   dim sum closer where live similar price taste Chang's offer us   Happy Eats All! <EOR> Vegas call dim sum? More dim shit! <EOR> I come Chang's early worry getting left over stuff previous day another dim sum place frequent but selection seems limited  all fundamental dishes yum cha yet them less competitor  did see tofu skin wraps spare ribs tendon fried taro cakes last visit  first dish all time favorites last mom's    I am certain reason why them less because lack chili oil sauce  serve vinegar red chili sauce instead gives everything more sour kick spicy one  Some might believe but condiment whole experience more enjoyable  am willing more math risk being swindled it    The service Chang's quick friendly  swear should Chang's more but feast feels limited dim sum taste vast  <EOR> Celebrating late Chinese New Year  This second time here  disappointed return trip  thought being close celebration time would ante  But didn't seem same wide variety items first visit  lot same dishes kept making way around dining room  majority ate alright  no idea most but mystery  dining room noisy but expected  There's lot communication difficulties asked mayonnaise of course she kept thinking wanted menu  friend asked chicken wings   well all chicken dance clue  But its fun time  prices cheap  <EOR> Geez  !!!

Overall dim sum oily questionable origins meat product lots salt flavors enhance food  Exactly expect dim sum <EOR> False advertising when stated dim sum all day  9pm expecting favorite dim sum items  Unfortunately dim sum some time all time  need add words select items   <EOR> I love fact no matter where Las Vegas find place suit your cravings   and dim sum seems place   before ok decided come again   Ordered your typical dim sum har shui mai cha sui bao etc   Service ok flag down bus boys cart ladies waiters water tea food   If area craving dim sum might your best option  <EOR> Usually place pretty good but when ate recently experience wasn't great  service horrible  practically ignoring table  orders took forever when ordered egg tarts took over thirty minutes  When egg tarts raw yellow part still liquid oozing out  Overall won't coming back again  <EOR> Came dim sum Sunday morning  totally  packed but seated quickly  Food started coming around boy great selection items everything very good  short end stick some things though because few huge parties before taking all good stuff  No complaints though everything good    Would definitely return  <EOR> I super grumpy starving morning really early afternoon here  prepared hate it  didn't   Service fast   gnawing duck bones slurping dumplings 3 min walking door!
