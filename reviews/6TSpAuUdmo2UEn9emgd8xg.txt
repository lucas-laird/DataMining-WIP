Filling tasteful healthy!!! going become regular!!! <EOR> The manager VERY rude!! Someone party waited over 45 minutes meal  He ordered before all all finished food before he even his  He decided ask refund take food because running late  manager total bitch refused compensate meal any restaurant good customer service would  employee VERY nicely offered give friend employee meal  manager then very rude someone party said employee should use personal employee meal mistake made companies behalf  never returning location manager needs fired employee needs raise! <EOR> Looking good variety filling fresh flavorful food super healthy you?

There plenty seemed excellent value  Something always true vegan food  would return ask little more spice   I find most often guest needs order correctly more satisfied meal  <EOR> I excited just reading reviews   Unfortunately did deliver      basil  spring rolls absolutly no flavors couples tiny dice basil leave did help  Then lasagna looks good but still very cold inside     layer pasta bearly cook when other ones kind aldente   maybe vegan  spring rolls should check le pho down street   gave 2 stars because 2 staff member extremely nice  <EOR> Simply Pure Chef Stacey Dougan Downtown Container Park  Nope turning new leaf    Vegan Vegetarian   daughter when eat few meatless meals   originally attempted eat other Vegan Vegetarian spot around corner but wait way long   Future Mrs  C  recommended give Simply Pure shot   daughter grilled cheese shared kale chips   She loved grilled cheese still raves it   kale chips awesome very low calories surprisingly satiating   Price everything average rest Vegan Vegetarian spots to   sure back when daughter town  <EOR> First time but food before  Love healthy vegan options sure back next time town  <EOR> I'm vegetarian going vegan came visit brother Nellis AFB  Therefore being home having tough time finding place eat  Found gem let tell DAMN  Amazing nachos super great tacos really fresh spring rolls  In super cute place wish Grand Rapids Michigan  <EOR> This place ok  But TVP beef wrecks entire menu because low quality  rubbery doesn't chew well all I spit out   But humans eat anything    even rubber    which really sad   For example Gardein beef Vegenation much much better vegan meat  could try pizza experience yourself! Beef crumbles Modern Vegan also better one's here   I'd know brand beef crumble using because pretty sure higher quality Gardein product   Either improve TVP else option substitute tofu   Other thing don't everything premixed if want enchiladas no onion can't that   On plus side cashew cheez best vegan cheez town! way more flavorful other spots consistency amazing   Simply Pure potential obviously tough because cramped space    I appreciate owner Stacy's thoughtful comment review really hope incorporate some more flexibility into menu  But can't raise rating more 2 stars because just can't eat here  Oh well  <EOR> Did some research Yelp before visiting Las Vegas found lot people recommending place! pretty small place container park near downtown may want take outs if want enjoy your food more comfortably  friend ordered ultimate sampler plate zucchini spirals nachos jimaca fries 2 tacos  food filling but wasn't amazing either  zucchini spirals raw watery but liked cashew sauce lot  nachos saltier side beef protein tasted overcooked ground beef  actually looking forward jimaca fries beforehand but tasted pretty weird say wasn't fan  However staff very friendly checked every now then  would try desserts lasagna next time visit <EOR> Great raw vegan place Container Park  Stacey super nice helpful  weekday afternoon she surprisingly busy  didn't help photographer stopping some shots place  Needless say she wasn't expecting busy  Along other helper took them while Ultimate Sampler  pretty patient but I'd peg around half hour   only knock  food fantastic! especially liked jicama fries course nachos great too  zuccini pasta tasty too  again taste something else everything menu looked tasty! <EOR> Delicious! mamma Mia lasagna very impressed  Limited seating just FYI  great dining experience here  <EOR> Loved it! place list visit before left luckily came across before departing  food excellent Chef Dougan awesome person definitely back next trip    I ordered zucchini pasta spinach mushrooms along cashew alfredo sauce  dish plentiful delicious  <EOR> My 1st time try Vegan am completely blown away delicious was!
