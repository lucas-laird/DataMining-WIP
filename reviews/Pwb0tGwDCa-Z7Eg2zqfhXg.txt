Poor service  Food nothing special  don't plan going back  <EOR> You can't pizza beer atmosphere staff always friendly fun  won't eat pizza anywhere else  Radio City hidden gem Vegas! <EOR> At first thought fast food pizza place where order pay grab seat   actually sit down place   service Awesome very attentive   didn't even ask ranch provided large portion     We ordered meatball sub w homemade french fries chicken parm pizza   All amazing!  chicken parm delicious!  Each slice large piece chicken cheese really good   homemade french fries good   crisp wasn't oily   almost tastes McDonalds fries but chunkier!  waitress recommended them glad tried it!  The prices alright considering Tivoli Village   definitely come back try other items  <EOR> We stopped because happened area although wouldn't normally visit development word Village it   course pretty hard time passing $0 50 PBRs too   Fist off PBRs hit spot price sure they're dispensing enough maintain peak freshness   also few Moretti's $1 50 another bargain but don't think  daily deal   We shared little house side salad   $5 sure lot value that   Just clump greens plate   We then split 12 BBQ Chicken Pizza $15 95    probably most ever paid pizza size   good but certainly hasn't dreaming ever since   I'd just happy frozen California Pizza Kitchen pie $5   Actually I'd happier because then I'd enough money 22 more PBRs   Normally would order large pizza we'd something take home but only some pizzas available large size   would lead believe pizzas made ahead time   knows but think sort dumb way set menu    What really caught eye though parmesan chicken sandwich saw sitting counter wow thing looked tasty!  Atmosphere?  much going happening Sunday afternoon   few trust fund babies bar sort made hope  normal crowd   In summary found food okay but worth price   Factor cost beers though you'll come even bill compared most other places  <EOR> Pizza OK  Pricey unless keep simple  Understaffed [waiters] Saturday night  <EOR> I could eat garlic chips all day   50 beer great deal  pizza good also  Would give 4 stars but host few months back very rude condescending  She's young try take personally but humbleness humility long way  Just few days ago waitress brought wrong order too  place enough back but better service think place lot potential  <EOR> Was intrigued homemade parmesan garlic chips wanted give them try use gauge whether would order anything else   Big mistake   $7 all small tray very burnt chips sprinkled parmesan cheese garlic salt   talking just few burnt ones  would say literally 99% entire order most customers would described burned   Perhaps if amount chips twice large price closer $4 would felt ripped off   prices place charges expect some superior quality      As much all helping small restaurant owner small thing really did leave horrible first impression   If looked chips before left would've probably sent them back but order didn't really look them until half way home   Oh well   Needless say won't returning  <EOR> DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!! Chicken club pizza bland boring fries honey mustard pretty good  Service worst part   Drinks empty almost whole time when did ask refills only brought 1 2 us  meal sat 10 min waiting while entire staff standing around just talking  bill asked if could box pizza few minutes saw waiter sweeping floor  He tossed pizza he supposed box up  Now maybe could forgive some things if swamped but only 1 other occupied table place!!! <EOR> Just lunch there   chicken wings thick juicy   sauce great flavor but wasn't hot   could haved used little more spice but definitely flavorful   slice Pepperoni pizza good   Looking forward trying Chicken Parm sandwich Parmesan Cheese chips next time  <EOR> I work Tivoli Village often eat pizzeria multiple times week  love convenient walk buy slice crispy oozing goodness lunch break  also really salads especially Vanilla Shallot dressing  also great service especially owner manager when he around he always making sure takin care of! continue eat pizzeria because know staff great high quality fresh food hard resist! <EOR> Wow!

Your pizza crust mean So few nights ago because LOVE pizza place super close apartment  also Tivoli Village 4 days week We cam around 730pm pretty dead which good!! opted seat outside since nice night son run around  took look menu trying figure if should order 2 slice plus soda 7$ 10 pizza 13$ cheese only add some toppings  50 slice 1$ 10 1 50$ 12 settled small pizza bc paying 14$ 4 slices pizza 2 sodas INSANE! added pep ham lil pizza off she placed order   We waited few mins then Kidville check out  came back waited little while longer pizza came out! starving ready eat! She set pizza rack thing checked out  looked pretty yummy excited take bite! served son slice which cheesy hot he pep ham  each took bite meh its yummy but expected little more price  slices small son both ate 3 ready burn off calories play area   The pizza moderate tastes fresh cheesy  Crust wasnt money any means figured would soft yummy    but kinda hard thick    Dont wrong love things hard thick    just crust!! arent greedy toppings pizza itself isnt overly greasy really greasy matter    I maybe might back if waitress super nice place itself clean  just wasnt enthralled pizza would compare NYC pizza all  would compare frozen digorno pizzas  Anywho 3 solid stars place! Loved waitress! <EOR> I came Tivoli shopping crawl  chilly outside mood hot pizza some garlic knots    We started garlic knots which bit tough  might because bottoms burnt  flavor also weak    there enough buttery garlic goodness them    The Viva Las Vegas Pizza 12 $15 95 made disappointment knots  Sopressata Italian cured salami roasted garlic Ricotta Cheese fresh mozzarella roasted tomatoes red onions sliced pepperoncinis  liked salami mild tasting without being overly salty  also appreciated offered pepperoncinis pizza  roasted tomatoes combination salty sweet   Yum!  The restaurant little small during winter people going likely feel brisk breeze   would suggest bringing jacket just case  <EOR> My family few times love pizza before yesterday service always good  Last night another story seems waiter having bad night  sitting outside son ask waiter 3 times water  each time he acted asking much  Someone another table complained he attitude well  sure if back price pay should good service period  <EOR> The worst pizza ever eaten! starving ordered Viva Las Vegas  believe Sopressata rancid picked off  crust gooey nasty  bf loves meats ate pieces  flavor meat permeated cheese only ate some toppings something tummy before attending wine event! left event early bf started feeling Ill nauseated time home sick all night! much less discomfort which 12 delay resulting surprise   Worse Chuck E Cheese! The cheap beer only thing should ordered here! <EOR> Note review past due time visited during month March    Incredibly slow service  only two people restaurant yet god damn pizza 30 mins later  very furious  top off only two tables occupied 20 something vacant ones  Anyways ordered BBQ pizza once received first bite into pizza BBQ sauce dripping everywhere plate  because basically downed whole pizza BBQ sauce  friend could even finish pizza because drenched BBQ sauce  However pig inside still gobbled most since love BBQ pizza   Seriously never want give place star because unless actually treated customers trash would underlying decision give them star  really need work service because only imagine if actually busy   if ever are  <EOR> Let's just people read reviews for VEGAN PIZZA  plenty of Daiya!  I pretty psyched when heard RCP offering vegan cheez alternative pizzas made voyage Bougieland some friends try out   They'll charge $2 extra vegan cheese but least don't skimp! 12 pizza bell peppers ahem green peppers don't play might getting red! artichoke hearts   crust good although mine little more done could another minute two oven taste    leftover pizza good both cold right fridge reheated microwave   So what's downside? Service great   Ambiance little lacking   some nice high tables near kitchen area then there's kids area  seemed surrounded tables children whole time there     do? busy day     no restroom   outside down way but guess  pretty common Tivoli     Beware most bottles wine actually half bottles   made mistake ended three people each getting 2 3 glass wine   Which delicious should $56 bottle   bad reading closely but think all felt little underhanded     other complaint red wine freaking COLD   cold duck! decent red wine    should no colder 60 deg   40 45   skip wine $1 PBR instead   I'll definitely pizza again but next time probably just call takeout  <EOR> Can't atmosphere food place  Great place watch big games just grab quick bite eat  owner manager fellow great well definitely returning <EOR> Yikes    if example expect Tivoli Village Summerlin gonna very disappointed   Walking impressed place  Very nice looking comfortable seating spread indoors outdoors   little warm today eat outside IMO but imagine night would great   Ordered some garlic knots meatball sandwich   Garlic knots knew trouble moment looked them   ever buy sourdough roll Albertson's something that?  outside bread looks tough really chewy?  Yup    that's garlic knots here   outside bread just disgusting   inedible   painted some butter garlic but really enough even if bread good   can't believe served that  Meatball sub Meatballs lukewarm   sure means but fear cause reheated it   Though honestly meatball itself good flavor juicy enough inside   sauce however gross   put way much slobbered everywhere tasted way sweet   sure if homemade I'd guess can     I no idea why giving star since service wasn't very good did more employees customers when yet staff kind sitting around chatting while some people needed service   really very well run place food service wise   I did waitress   She nice even though very attentive   She made pretty awful Arnold Palmer but nice asked if liked garlic knots   Feel bad lying good   If you're eager try place would next 6 months   can't imagine place lasting very long unless Tivoli really takes off foot traffic  <EOR> I excited try place but sadly did chance  advertise deliver but apparently only busy days don't know which day is  Very disappointed  <EOR> Food Viva Las Vegas pizza pizza quite tasty! generous amount cheese roasted garlic really came through  fire roasted tomatoes great touch!
