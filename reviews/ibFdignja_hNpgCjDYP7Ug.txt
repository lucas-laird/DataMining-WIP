She super attentive extremely bubbly personality enthusiastic  atmosphere vibe very casual music perfect volume loud enough hear but loud drowns conversation  Food amazing!! Only downside found bar bit stuffy cigar smoke lingering air   non smoker very unappetizing early morning place empty  think if came later crowd smoke would prevented eating  We out of towners used smoke free environments   Other that  would recommend place WITHOUT HESITATION!! <EOR> Very friendly service food good  fish tacos chips salsa drink $10 99  Good deal  decor very surf sporty  Full bar back  <EOR> Fish tacos used really good but last couple times much  fishy no pop flavor  Just didn't taste fresh if know mean  Maybe changed chefs but won't going back  <EOR> Service terrific! fast friendly  gentleman worked gave baby sticker  food came fast! shrimp bowl great!! <EOR> Love place great bar quick service if kids area eat watch video skaters  Nice surf skate board place all drink soda shrimp burrito yummy cool place California feel beach  <EOR> I food but very expensive lunch 9 bucks food but when add annoying table service taking your before but fork down bit much Trying relax now relaxing lunch instead am annoyed annoying wait staff One having warm food Two stars food right  One deducted star expensive One deducted star annoying wait staff soup bowl  One deducted star annoying wait staff main dish While fork still hand <EOR> I've visited Wahoo's Southern California but never Vegas  took family Easter Sunday around 8pm nice time  nobody dining area only bar which nice  host Sean King provided excellent service made sure taken care of  He didn't try rush anything  always loved food Wahoo's but long way when service great! place away heavy strip crowds nice place eat healthily food  <EOR> Started going Wahoo's football season when Shannon started tending bar there     Shannon way back watching football tradition  Nevertheless really place  bar nice atmosphere crowd cool price right great specials Shannon puts Lions games also watch other games keep fantasy football points    I haven't eaten much other wings but them every time  awesome really nice flavor them    It without saying Shannon best fastest knowledgeable personable Bartenders ever pleasure frequenting  Whether know she's true professional everyone feel welcomed well taken care of    This location completely across town where live but worth trip  <EOR> Yesterday felt need try new restaurant really feeling fish tacos boyfriend ended here  walked instantly notice laid back vibe half indoor half outdoor bar which thought pretty cool  woman took order also very nice helpful decided stay    The first thing found very interesting place called Wahoo's Fish Tacos More Fish tacos really underplayed definitely lot focus 'more'  selection sparse really looking ultimately ended getting monthly special California Burrito Carne Asada Fries cheese pico lots avocado avocado sauce chips salsa drink  boyfriend Shredder Sandwich Fish decided share order Baja Rolls all which totalled $28 not bad!    We found table did wait long food arrive  burrito looked great but ended being rather unremarkable  boyfriend felt same sandwich only thing could really taste Baja Rolls cream cheese  adding some hot sauce things better    All in all food alright experience good great  did notice some bar specials $2 95 Pacificos! seem pretty good happy hour decided would return someday try out  <EOR> Great little place! few times now  bartenders excellent very friendly  food bomb  Great place couple drinks unwind  Would definitely recommend  <EOR> This first time eaten heard mixed reviews it  actually turned really well  two spicy fish tacos not very spicy all delicious  dad fish salad really good too  Citrus slaw! <EOR> To honest must start saying only actually ate once  However does stop giving them 5 stars would give more if could!!  Let start saying    atmosphere staff place great! felt completely welcome first step door feeling never died   Everyone very friendly made conversation if old friends! But truly does nothing compare owners!!! never met person however truly feeling matter them! refreshing come into contact owners business TRULY care customers! rare find busy world live today!! I can't recommend enough least giving place try!!! disappointed! <EOR> Never really any issues until today  Came lunch decided try HIGHLY promoted Surf Turf Burrito  Decided steak shrimp  Arrived looked great but contained neither steak nor shrimp only fish  returned remade correctly but pre made oldness taste  told made order but determined most likely older tortillas  Moving back fish tacos   still love those! <EOR> This place yummy fresh  chicken teriyaki bowl good  come back sure  People working friendly nice  big plus   The above first time there  second time however food good  Food fresh every time people working great  Mike guy works nights bar super friendly  Victor day manager friendly made point things right made some human mistakes! Revised back   that reason taking star off  still good place go   clean    <EOR> The Skinny supposedly healthy Mexican fusion very little flavour 2 counter service efficient but nothing special where hell salsa bar? 2 value $6 50 huge tasteless plate white rice beans little protein veg?  little pricey 2    We've waiting forever Wahoos open Boca location  However spotted large sign 215 stating just off Rainbow  Ecstatic hubby brought taste fusion healthy take Mexican classics   This particular restaurant outfitted serve both bar restaurant  If adverse cigarette smoke stay away booths closest bar area  Even though wall separating two areas smell smoke does waft through open door bar into eating area  warned!  Ordering breeze really  Pick your filling Chicken pork shrimp beef fish mushrooms tofu veggies then decide whether your want taco enchilada burrito style  If don't feel doing Mexican style also order bowl over rice  just salad soup your standard sides quesadillas chips salsa nachos etc  Combination plates come rice beans instead your standard chips   Well feeling little hungrier usual opted standard combination plate $6 50 two carnitas tacos white rice black beans  hubs tried two different styled fish tacos tried white beans instead   I would say combination plates aren't healthy  Even though might low fat can't tell massive plate white rice very little vegetables top tacos healthy  Filling yes  Healthy much  may healthier if offered salad option instead beans rice   Okay enough rant nutrition food   I say above mentioned carnitas fish tacos grilled two different styles rather lacking flavour  actually used salt shaker table  Here's thing never use salt table you ask husband   pico de gallo served top tacos used rather mealy overripe tomatoes which lead unpleasant texture  well don't think really dried off cabbage lettuce very well because tortillas sopping wet   The beans okay but nothing spectacular  think white cajun beans more seasoning hence tasted better black beans  rice standard issue nothing exciting   I also disappointed lack salsa bar  Mexican fusion place gotta least some sort salsa limes around  Nope  closest thing stack lemons your iced tea soda fountain  Lame   Overall given lackluster flavours soggy textures lack salsa bar feel no overwhelming urge repeat experience  Although relatively inexpensive food just isn't good holds no value books  2 starred review  <EOR> Love those shrimpeladas  Joey rules other bartenders great too  Authentic Cali style mex some! <EOR> The atmosphere restaurant pretty neat   Customer service great   order front bring your food your table   However expected lot more tacos   ordered chicken taco shrimp taco   two shrimp better    but nothing absolutely amazing it  <EOR> Talk reminiscing days visiting college roommate down southern california Huntington Beach kicking pier getting some fish tacos  only thing missing sand all over floor  Darn need work one  Lol! Wahoo Fish Tacos affordable tacos good portion laid back southern california feel it  If billabong quicksliver surfing  Then mention all skateboard brand names  posters totally feels rad place hang friends whether restaurant bar area  into any those things but if your fan definitely love decor vibe   The food its your basic mexican food nothing really WoW factor  ended getting Kahuna Grande  mention earlier great value price because all Combo Platters comes rice choose steam spanish beans refried black believe other option   Kahuna Grande choice taco enchilada enchilada  Also three tequitos all three choose your protein  another list things choose when comes options plenty choose plus even healthy  when carne asada enchilada then chicken tequitos  Overall liked whole dish felt everything okay  carne asada nice flavor combine enchilada sauce top nice combination flavor  tequitos just okay  black bean side fabulous! liked black beans cooked perfect nice flavor  steamed rice just steamed rice nothing special  guacamole terrible  if anything fan guacamole  feel even fresh made just off no flavor whatsoever  salsa ok  came brother family try cajun chicken nachos  Just fan  way heavy top loaded very good    I fact prices great under $10 lot  Food ok nothing special but being close home if ever want quick mexican food other then Robertos  Wahoo Fish Tacos place come back again   <EOR> Bartenders ignore since changed all staff its really inviting wait almost 20 minutes just greeted  Then when food came wrong bartender dayshift extremely rude actually made offensive comments other customers because sent back  arrogance staff bar astounding  Yes money rules all but don't treat people disrespect just because you're playing  never know you're talking to  <EOR> Wahoooooo! love some good fish tacos   About two years ago started writing wahoos opening las Vegas restaurant kept loop contacting every often plans  literally jumped joy when location opened  No more driving five hours me   Driving felt little girl headed Disneyland wares jump seat  little taken back location side look  starters unpopulated area also weird looking  tell wahoos used bar  all wahoos ca none them looked weird place wahoos   The service fast friendly but could tell workers still little used place  Rey polite helpful but lack outgoing personality seen other workers other locations  least step right direction  Prices cheap especially compared Pasadena location  Portions huge always  noticed fish little more fishy remember lacked spice  Over all still pretty darn tasty  Good amount cabbage salsa  Personally line enough two large tacos but then again line whore black beans we're rich full flavor  tell coked good spices when asked said cooked onions   knew it! white rice good  Way much appetite but others that  There's way more enough two people others would suggest ordering combo splitting it  Its weird see inside 24 hours open bar slot machines but much shock because know las Vegas compete other restaurants offer  just something going tiger used but heat same time craving fish tacos morning know going fix  Now rocks socks folks   This place could use little improvement but cutting wahoos some slack cause t just opened some different qualities makebit different other ones  Come give wahoos try great fast healthy alternative normal lunch places <EOR> Food fresh healthy  Staff prompt happy  cool SoCal vibe feels your beach  4 ate beers $48 +tip <EOR> SO happy opened! moved orange county going reminded home  Carne Asada Nacos shrimp tacos yummy!

A must if nearby! <EOR> This bitter sweet restaurant me   always when am feeling health conscious   fish grilled instead fried food very oily   love that   same note food lacks punch   think because prepared healthier side food lacks flavor   wish fish more spices hate having compensate homemade hot sauce spicy!!  end mainly tasting hot sauce instead food made mistake several times!  But still give four   portions big food prepared clean healthy everyone really nice restaurant fun high energy   Random thought secretly wish veggies could added burrito without teriyaki sauce   Never fan teriyaki   Since we're going healthy might well all way no sauce!! <EOR> This place pretty good which some reason surprised me    The best part wide selection ways which tweak your meal  improvement over other similar chains    I impressed price amount food  rare can't finish $7 lunch    The quality food sort would expected  Certainly wasn't planning receiving gourmet fare but hoping slightly higher quality    Regardless quick healthy lunch good option great price  <EOR> Food huge disappointment nasty!   The only thing loved decor if only knew food much decorations wanted love place       bummed! <EOR> Had Kale Kai Salad last night spicy fish top delicious! bit pricey salad $11+ but its pretty big finished second half breakfast morning still good! cilantro lime dressing brings life me! loooved it  fish could bit more crispy outside flaky inside if pan fried skin then baked it  but flavor nice  Might try chicken pork next time instead  <EOR> UPDATE 4 20 17   Joseph always made night  bunny passed Easter weekend he take off some stress  guy didn't even know but helped lot worry cooking think  He enjoying your time effortless  Thanks dude     Since living Huntington Beach forever addicted Wahoos  Joseph dreams come true  See bar  pleasure professional customer service class act  Being industry myself highly appreciated  husband really enjoy nights but Joseph made little extra special paying attention bar tables entire bar FULL  thoroughly enjoyed service    Update! 1 13 17   Rosy thank your continuous smile every time dine  brighten anyone's day  attest that     Joseph always finest  great night served Rosy come over food smile!

First time loved it  Food delicious staff awesome  Nice quiet which perfect since took twins  <EOR> First off going Wahoos 25 years started Laguna Beach Lake Forest Laguna Hills mostly never problem But Mann location Sunset Las Vegas just wrong 1 always order 1988 style fish tacos everytime citrus slaw Like owner\ manager doesn't know difference trains cooks wrong cooks just lazy I'm kidding when say 30 times they've messed order probably 25 times Forgets put dressing when order Wahoos salad doesn't include salsa your tacos when say please don't forget pico charge it 2 never season black beans plain beans worst note owner \manager don't cheap seasoning skimp beans 3 always different people every 2_or 3 weeks don't think most workers ever eaten Wahoos And cooks haven't either C'mon Mann learn difference between citrus slaw 1988 original style Put bay leaf two beans hard I really don't know why back I guess just keep hoping <EOR> This fav spots! All staff friendly always great service   Prices really reasonable don't quite understand person said expensive  also think Tammy awesome  second place where she worked always great experience her!  The burning roll awesome! <EOR> Wahoo's pretty decent   service top notch but feel fish taco's use little more kick  perhaps little acidity spice fish   Their mild green sauce pretty good but really enjoyed Mista Ree's sauce best   tastes main ingredient Korean hot chili paste   cajun grilled fish pretty mild would smother sauce all over taco's   The taco platters huge   big heaping serving rice black beans   Seriously probably share meal friend   Their chicken tortilla soup also very tasty very homey little bit heat   Overall Wahoos serves fresh ingredients huge portions food extremely reasonable prices   just think taco's could use little more kick notch  <EOR> This place amazing! hard find fresh food Vegas let alone seafood  ordered Paleo Bowl Reef carnitas burrito  Food both delicious fulfilling! <EOR> Wahoo's Fish Tacos bookmarked knows long! friends really craving some seafood also tacos else better time both same time?! much time procrastinating made way down surely glad did   On late Saturday afternoon expecting bit wait surprise actually pretty dead  Now    normal circumstances isn't good indication because could assume place doesn't good food don't good service but always exceptions! Wahoo's them  fact just opposite both  Great food great service!  The set helped standard but works them  know walk server seats whole thing? Yeah   No walk order counter pay counter then bring your food you  always wonder reasoning some food places but hey if works them works    The menu extensive found myself bit overwhelmed actually order even but option order in  example   If order fish burrito did 3 4 different styles made  People struggle menus provide many options because inner fat boy wants ALL options   cashier also server helped decided ordering Salmon burrito Mr  Lee's SCReaM'n style awesome suggestion because loved every last bite  Only thing kept them getting 5th star margaritas weren't good   Other back soon tackle some more offer very soon! <EOR> Love some wahoo's!

  bartender responded Don't call sir without smile  shrugged off sat down ordered promptly  Since most only looking eat asked if could put food orders  He literally rejected request sternly stated he would only take drink orders aggressively rudely tried convince each every drink    After finally accepting food orders took 10 minutes water  Another 5 receive drinks  Most friends never even theirs  When asked them he spoke dumbfounded no wrong manner    The wait food arrive average understanding because past 3AM probably only cook  But reasoned slow most simply ordered taco plates  But then food started trickling kitchen each dish coming 5 minutes apart  only did he forget what  but every single order painfully incorrect  Every  Single  Order  simple unmodified orders  Watching your friends eat extremely unacceptable  foodservice industry industry standard send food together  friends last received food inquired status order  bartender asked he ordered smiled said coming soon  then watched walk over punch friends order 45 minutes he initially ordered all enough few friends walked door  NEVER life walked tab but when started complaining he least agreed comp bill even though told no problem paying because knew never coming back  But while trying figure why everything wrong he simply shrugged   I usually love write reviews because love spreading word great businesses good eats but first time came compelled keep other people away place   Matt sorry sir but fucked big time  <EOR> Doing edit original review since hear server complaint finally fired last couple months now alright calling name   two messed customer service experiences late 2012 bartender Candi   seen least couple other regulars complain fully agree remarks having issues drinking job blowing off customers flirt guy just having bad attitude general   addition last time saw Nov she made some completely off the wall accusations which things security footage looking phone text history would've easily disproved   regular year before Wahoo's she completely turned when tried talk drinking ignoring customers problem!
