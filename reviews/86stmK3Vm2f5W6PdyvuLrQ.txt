Baristas really nice cool girls  shared some stories made fun each other  Good luck girls! <EOR> I would rate location negative stars! manager owner location should very concerned! Restaurant half empty service worst long time  Listened hostess argue where sit another party  awkward! told would few minutes since really busy  Busy? Half empty restaurant Saturday night? should walked point because all down hill there  While waiting waiter booth next became frustrated because never could waiter table  approach hostess stand ask help  Nothing done simply pointed said oh he over am sure he come way   only saw waiter order drinks food  nurse soda fear wouldn't anything drink meal  daughter no drink during dinner even water  mention meal came wrong but waiter would known since he didn't care check sure everything need  never back location  needs some good management involvement place turned around  Half empty restaurant Saturday night tells bigger problems perhaps multiple experiences mine! <EOR> At point Applebees deserved five stars  came last night see some old familiar faces  first impression  poor hostess Erica being picked new staff members haven't even seen month ago  seemed she cry  remember seeing Vanessa working before she pregnant remember everyone helping because right thing do  Yesterday all watched 8 months pregnant woman same Vanessa cleaning vomit table left 5% $6 tip    All while general manager Susan what's name also seen month ago sat bar talking new guy also seemed neglect guests point  hope Vanessa didn't sick jeopardize child's well being last night   I sat Sabrina's section which weird because haven't seen bartend over year now people don't only recognize but watched Ted overpour liquor took long time beer  bar looked absolute shit people enjoying time while trying dine   I know Sabrina injured elbow ended having nerve damage work couple months ago  doctor workmans comp doctor set restrictions such lifting over 5lbs  saw carrying 3 plates weighed way more that    She carrying those plates someone other servers table  general manager walking ahead carrying two circle plates collectively weighed third Sabrina carrying  Sabrina injured work she forced finish working shift then she forced keep closing working through pain next week until doctors set restrictions which now all see she bartending but instead serving    running everyone's food expenditure everyone food helping new worthless bartenders ale drinks slow don't know to   Every time come back Applebee's see environment worse staff worse all really incredible servers bartenders met through years leave replaced people clearly should industry  hope apple American looks numbers sees best check average holders liquor sellers best guest reviews throughout full 2014 then look still there  Hardly anyone  truly upsetting much liked Boca Park Applebees but fact many employee rights safety violations absolutely ridiculous  seen people work 8 hours without drink any food  No helps each other out  Management injured sick people work aside Sabrina working injury remember 6 months ago she working through blood poisoning getting yelled pushed around    yes aware  hope close restaurant down compensate all employees properly  horrible gm demoted transferred another doesn't know job well doesn't understand human needs even less any other managers past  hope corporate sees hope company starts treating its employees human beings  shouldn't frequently see health code violations apple American standard violations employee rights violations employee safety violations harassment employees crying managers giving hand pregnant injured employees  You're losing all people made Applebee's good replacing them horseshit  restaurant even brings completely different clientele seen heard more walk outs unreasonable complaints ever before  Shitty service brings shitty clientele  Shitty managers bring shitty servers drive good ones away which also brings turn also brings shitty clientele sure company loses money end   I hope everyone good day hope someone fucking does something this  <EOR> I always awesome experience meal every time eat Applebee's! food service cleanliness excellent  <EOR> If could give 0 stars would       Food cooked right corrected service poor    Management duh ! <EOR> This place your average sit down Applebee's restaurant  Nothing wrong all but nothing special either  Prices decent food decent which why gets 3 5 stars   I Classic Burger which disappointment rather plain very average tasting  Even spruced lettuce onions tomato ketchup mustard still very bland think part because meat burned    They new lemonade which really good  strawberry lemonade real strawberry slices it    I say Boneless Wings 5 5  GREAT!!! appetizer mild boneless wings buffalo sauce ranch  Delicious wings  Everything else tried average  <EOR> i once service pretty bad but thought why give another shot    its applebees know food   its chain  cant all bad thought maybe bad day  NOPE!!

When he finally showed ready order   There menu insert $10 entrees decided each meal also share appetizer plate  ordered crunchy boneIN buffalo wings kobe meatballs appetizers  wings good but meatballs weren't cold middle  Kobe ass! sent those back asked another order same wings  Tell why brought boneless BBQ wings table? WTF  hard really? didn't feel complaining again just ate them  few minutes later though manager brought boneIN buffalo wings told already given bbq ones ate those instead  She real peach tho she told keep buffalo wings anyway  Also inconvenience she took appetizers off bill gave small discount top that  likely only reason am giving place 2 stars   As far lunches enjoyed boyfriends more mine  brewhouse chicken chicken cutlet sitting mountain mashed potatoes cheese crispy fried onions  came stout gravy which he side  steak ok very flavorful but cooked perfectly medium  came roasted onion roasted tomato roasted potatoes ton stout gravy  gravy little salty but made otherwise bland dish edible  safe say coming back here  <EOR> Applebee's   what say? all franchises similar Chili's serve your classic dishes variety choose tickle many fancy  location located Boca Park   Summerlin only clean inside restaurant but also clean parking neighborhood surroundings  Car side amazing!
