This officially favorite new restaurant Vegas  I'd never Artisan before which just amazing beautiful see why film many skinemax movies dimmed lighting cool statues bookshelves everywhere neat paintings continues into mood but lot better lit yay! see food!   newish server very attentive ran down every dish asked always around refill drinks   So beautiful want move service excellent but main reason gets 5 stars think single greatest salmon salad ever had  gargantuan piece perfectly cooked salmon dollop pesto top vinaigrette dressed salad  Seriously salad amazing regular salmon dish probably also  calamari fun jalapenos mushroom soup wasn't creamy could paste other places  If didn't gambling problem I'd stay artisan next time but coming back mood bar  <EOR> I just threw Husbands birthday dinner July 23'rd year  before course requested favorite server 'Wes'  large party over 25 guests showed up  staff kind polite  allowed friends play piano sing there! Wes course much fun attentive all friends impressed only atmosphere but 5 star service well  Everyone meals brought together cocktails never empty  If try place won't wrong any servers but if want someone fun incredible sure ask Wes  Thank Artisan Thank Mood Thank Wes such special time  look fwd returning again again again! <EOR> Kooky best way describe experience Artisan Hotel eating Mood  want say front giving review 4 stars because positive fun experience but also totally understand why other people might good night here    To begin little hard figure into hotel  valet parking only when pull into lot first thing see sign right says Valet lot only Enter  can't really see around corner left kind feel aren't correct lot  driving around little bit realized keep going left then see valet stand  asked valet guy if lot people confused  He laughed said yes all time said he seen people park across street walk over hotel because didn't know where park    The Artisan Hotel itself crammed full stuff  Paintings chairs statues fountains there's lot look at  walking into old haunted mansion  entertaining  But because busy does confusing figure where restaurant actually is  Once pointed right direction again some confusion  sign says Restaurant over Mood but doors open directly into dining room  Don't wait hostess usher no hostess  Just stand somewhat awkwardly middle dining room until someone tells where sit    I think thing really made difference dining experience Sunday night only other table restaurant  restaurant tiny room only server fantastic   But distinct feeling only server all time  did wait long time food particularly long considering nobody else restaurant  But food really good fennel sausage basil flat bread pork tenderloin scallops macaroni Brussels Sprouts  Everything excellent though can't say Doritos top macaroni add anything dish  Again food awesome service spot I can't blame server slow food but restaurant busier imagine things might break down rather quickly    Our server did mention past chef used very into farm table used point buying local produce using local vendors  seems past few years hotel some financial trouble looking line doesn't seem much anymore    Overall quirkiness overall weirdness hotel dining experience made really memorable evening  does sort sound hotel having some financial troubles good chance food quality may deteriorate result  would recommend checking Mood week night Sunday night reduce your waiting time hurry while its still possible good meal enjoy Artisan experience while can  <EOR> We only people 5 pm  afternoon  wait long time waiter finally seated served  waiter Justin  pay coupon restaurant com When he saw he became bit snob  He did write down menu selection just stood take order 2 arms hips rude way  He didn't appreciate did order wine  restaurant empty except 2 us  waited 20 30 minutes food  surprisingly good  steak very good french onion soup well Thai cake starter  20 percent tip added 65 00 bill less 25 00 coupon total 53 00   12 00 guy better zero he would gotten if hadn't gone there  <EOR> Love little gem! Sunday night little sad no live music piano night  would made 5 stars sure  valet super friendly when parked when walked asked where Mood just right walk thru door where bar right left everyone super friendly helpful directing right direction  love Artisan super cool Parisian vibe it  restaurant very cool trendy great ambiance but little dead quiet without music would recommend going friday saturday when apparently live performance piano unlike anything else strip vegas  Very Euro  Food DELICIOUS!!

tender flaky just right amount seasoning  really delicious  also side asparagus wild mushroom risotto  Hmmmm  asparagus just asparagus but risotto overdone very sticky  wild mushroom taste heavenly though  just wish cooked better    So suppose everything else Artisan almost great but quite  hopes improve because really love hotel  <EOR> I love ambiance place  fact love entire Artisan  restaurant quite small stage piano lots paintings etc  great little spot  open 24 hours  only late night menu but pleased  food itself probably actually 3 stars but ambiance bumps up  Unfortunately server brand new he didn't know much menu unable locate drink wine list etc  But he attentive everything else   For food opted nachos wings  Neither quite expecting but again pleased  cheese nachos unique mostly asiago which gave interesting twist  wings teriyaki  all spicy but good balance savory sweet  No dipping sauce comes but asked side ranch which pretty good   Overall would give place 4 stars would definitely come back  <EOR> I Groupon place tried curiosity   $50 only $25 since Groupon friend best meals ever Vegas   Lobster BLT Sandwich unbelievable reason visit its own   Also Lobster Mac Cheese friend gourmet looking French Dip   staff really friendly room cozy intimate   Doesn't hurt attached coolest Hotels Bars town  <EOR> Chef Eric fun reputation when comes teasing food over Internet via Twitter Tweeting lots pics  aren't just normal food pics but pics your mouth water Pavlov's dog  time try restaurant inside quirky Artisan Hotel  Having hotel only once before wasn't sure getting myself into  But literally wear scent Adventure decided throw caution Vegas strong Winter wind trek across town   If you've never Artisan veritable hipster paradise First Friday art exhibit never closes  mostly valet parking except few sports round back gives upper crust boutique hotel feel right arrive  Stepping inside trying process decor fun  looks tornado hit art gallery placed pieces everywhere including ceiling weird angles  All tell don't take themselves seriously you're fun try something completely different  hotel itself close enough Las Vegas Strip without all usual hustle bustle   Then arrive back hotel where lounge restaurant located  first confused sans any greet staff  took solid minute ask waiter if anyone going seat me  He promptly replied take any seat wish  sat four top  food biz call table four four top   My waiter presented himself few minutes later asking if I'd glass wine alcoholic beverage  ordered soft drink disrupt tasting abilities  enjoy chef's tasting menu   The first course included watercress salad truffle sauce fried calamari cherry pepper compote unusually delicious  pepper worked well balance sweet cherry nice idea taste good   The second course larger spoon included tasty farm raised striped bass cous cous truffled watercress  haven't fish skin still while but easy remove presented well  cous cous cooked properly nice balance bass since fish usually rich   The final course entree  included braised short rib veal demi glaze cooking five hours port wine reduction  served baby carrots roasted potatoes  entire veal demi glaze tender easily pulled off bone fork  sauce just enough over powering  Even smaller tasting size quite filling  Thanks chef Eric Mood Restaurant fun taste test  <EOR> 3 5 Stars  Beautiful place!
