There's word comes mind when think place homey!  Environment place made feel home! Random cute toys bar plush vegetables sitting against chairs bookcases filled manga Japanese curtains covering windows made feel someone's home Japan  Something made feel very cozy comfortable being Food Tastes simple but delicious home cooked meals! Fusion between Japanese European food  oyako don $9 which just eggs onions chicken over rice  could something simple taste good? big fan rice but gobbled whole dish which rich flavorful  Also came house salad soup  Check Yelp try Yuzu soda really unique! Tasted soda w kumquats    Unfortunately full any dessert   but variety green tea desserts   love green tea definitely back those! Do Facebook updates owner always adding trying new menu items   Service owner sweet attentive  tell he really loves restaurant cares customers  Upon checking he urged Facebook page 10% discount asked if student ID Summer Student discount which really nice him! also loyalty card program  <EOR> I'm sorry just cannot into many Asian foods Japanese included  rarely very very rarely eat Chinese Thai Japanese etc  exception sushi  don't know call white bread eatin' American? thing am excited try new culinary cuisines but Asian inspired dishes just cup tea some reason  spices tastes    just don't hit palette Italian Mexican dishes do   With being said think Cafe de Japon A OK  would probably bumped 4 stars if truly enjoyed Japanese food  trip Pre Fixe lunch menu  came small salad very good fresh  Next agedashi tofu appetizer which thought okay  huge tofu fan even hearty dish failed super excited it  main course tororin omelet rice  hearty rich plus ketchup gave taste though cooked kitchen home    Lastly siphon coffee which FABULOUS  would come back coffee but probably anything else    Overall think those really love Japanese food love Cafe de Japon but probably stick doing full out meal elsewhere  <EOR> My meal nice but nothing exceptional  The part liked best Japanese soda  tasty  The mixed tempura seemed pretty standard tempura  Nothing seemed stand out  beef dish seemed pretty ho hum  wasn't bad but kind bland  Service friendly  The place nice feeling  way main menu big board bring table  Plus Japanese pop music nice touch  could eat again but nothing seemed worth going way  <EOR> I can't give 5 stars because never tried food BUT Yuzu soda reason choose exist!!!!!!!!!
