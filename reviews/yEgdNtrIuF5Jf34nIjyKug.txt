Now  worth talkin' about! <EOR> food good but no where near good Planet Hollywood location  just opened maybe need work few bugs      I'll try again few months see if a faster b better  <EOR> Got chili dog effort address craving something savory and or spicy   dog good crispy flavorful disappointment chili much flavor kinda oily impressed overall <EOR> So Being Chicago girl generally dogs classic chicago style  some odd reason decided try something box ordered Red Rock Dog cheese fries   woah lets talk portions! First off polish nice size very juicy but toppings   toppings     much mushroom onions cheese  Waaaay way much   interesting combination but never again    As cheese fries   basic unsalted  cheese gross spicy  never order them again   I love try something else but beware Red Rock dog   <EOR> Yay! doesn't nostalgia Hollywood location does but drive Red Rock Station heck lot closer! Plus location open until 10pm nothing better then chili dog chase beer guzzling!

He letting hungry stomach guide making stupid lunch choice  stood ordered overly priced Chicago style combo meal thought Pace salsa commercials  know ones where ask where other salsa said New York City  New York City? Yeah know rest story  sat down Pinks Chicago dog thinking real deal enjoyed many day downtown Chicago  mind recalling something wonderful but cheer someone betting horses Sportsbook quickly snapped back reality took bite front me  quickly realized yeah daydream past experiences much better just shelled $10 for! combo LA version classic just sucked  Tough chewy bland bleech! toppings along some passable fries knowing if didn't eat would awhile before could again only things kept eating stomach would shut up  Fortunately keep roll pepto chewables around   two pink chewables served end first Pink's experience    People stuff? don't it  Some things Cali great exports other states   but Pinks those things  <EOR> Honestly feel Pink's way overrated  absolutely terrible but definitely tried better hot dog places  if you're visiting Vegas should trying many other amazing restaurants anyway  If don't want spend much money but still want something delicious I'd recommend going Earl's Sandwich  <EOR> This inside Red Rock Casino next big screen television where watch all football games!!  Yes!!  football galore!   and guess what?  lucky enough came Sunday   it's Football Sunday Special!!  $2 dollars chili dog which usually $4 + per dog   yep expensive dog    but $2 NFL Sunday totally worth it   The service efficient !!!  Saw Niners kicked ass too!!!  all good!! <EOR> Not very good fresh tasting  also really pricey  wanted place occasional chili dog hot dog craving  bread soft steamed  problem  hot dog good snap but wasn't awesome tasting   It just isn't good which bad because rare meal eating hot dog grew Chicago use often Portillos bomb wasted place    About three years ago tried Pinks Planet Hollywood better experience but just remember pricey was  <EOR> Had porto bacon dog burrito  thing felt 10 pounds haha  Love atmosphere very homie  love most fries! eat those all day! <EOR> The planet ho location isn't good LA red rock isn't even good planet ho  pastrami dog friend 3 dog night  dogs no snap  whole point natural casing hot dog  Skimpier planet ho w pastrami but 3 dog night still ridiculously huge  Good shoe string fries least    If hot dogs loaded w toppings I'd try Buldogi's few miles away instead  Ok if happen Red Rock but wouldn't destination  Points overlooking games sports book weird hide condiments corner  <EOR>
