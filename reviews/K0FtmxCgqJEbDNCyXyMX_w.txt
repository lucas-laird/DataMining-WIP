Pretty annoying when don't close until 9 30pm  would think would prepared ready dinner rush instead trying rush close! Pretty bad service <EOR> This first experience Panda Express pleasantly surprised   Even though pretty busy place very clean atmosphere quiet relaxed much more enjoyable your typical fast food experience   staff working line very polite friendly efficient!  also 'plate' concept use pick side then pick 2 3 entrees  When authentic Chinese restaurant never decide just thing order! Orange Chicken Beijing Beef delicious although Fried Rice disappointed rice undercooked pretty much flavorless overall   loved hot chili sauce great flavor actually spicy enough satisfy us! Keep mind still fast food if you're looking place authentic cuisine I'd try somewhere else   Great pinch though we'll definitely coming back! <EOR> Amazing team always  worked guys before  probably most hard working individuals satisfying co workers worked with  say something less okay embarrassment character working ethics  am proud return see food amazing tasty remembered  Attitude customer care its best  cover expectations fast express restaurant should always run  much miss team mine  difficult read comments people doesn't understand portion quality specific Panda store capable of  Guys keep doing doing! doing nothing wrong all!

Tasted very plain soggy  If rest food freshly prepared why wasn't rice ? takes more half plate  DID PAY ?!?!?!?! <EOR> This first time particular location say all all very satisfied  Service good  Food very fresh very tasteful  some trash floor between bathroom condiment station front door but all all pretty clean place  would recommend all friends family  <EOR> This closest location home  normally don't ordering food but when craving area  just limited type restaurants cheap fast dinner  Anyway each time come usually early part evening 630 730ish pans bare  close till 9 whatever time am gonna order??? sure cook more but they'll wait rush cooking  Why pans filled conserving? seems also time 8pm cleaning mopping kitchen area  Barely any food pans  am having them prepare anything because am gonna contaminated cleaning chemicals  decided eat elsewhere  chicken teriyaki also bit rushed undercooked lacked flavor marinade  many panda's location needs improvement! <EOR> Not sure telling truth website workers  pandas 930pm told closed  No actually told closed guy cleaning stood windows pulled phone check time made no motion head motioning come in  Website says 10 10 open now indicator  Great customer service btw  <EOR> First usually enjoy Panda Express over last few years eaten MANY different locations both Las Vegas other cities  understand POOR experience because ignorant franchise owners single location reflection Panda Express general  Nevertheless learned hard way all Pandas created equal!  UGHHHH  Unfortunately made mistake trying Panda Express because very close doctor's office where 94 year old Mom appointment   It 3 o'clock afternoon   well lunchtime before dinner  nobody eating but EVERY table DIRTY crumbs noodles spilled soda etc It disgusting  couldn't find clean table sit at  food line ask someone if could wipe down table ignored least good 2 3 minutes manager three members cooking staff seemed very busy talking top volume Spanish  Finally woman name tag said Manager came thinking ordering food barked want? answered We'd clean table sit wipe off table us? She seemed annoyed Give minute  FIVE more minutes passed she proceeded leave standing waiting a 94 year old woman walker loud conversation laughing employees continued   I ask MORE time AGAIN if could please clean table   Finally she begrudgingly came over wet wash rag wipe  asked if she manager which she replied challenging tone No am assistant why? said Because all tables your restaurant dirty  Don't think might more business if didn't leave customers standing waiting several minutes sit clean table? Oh she didn't that  She gave stink eye walked away  should just LEFT point but unfortunately didn't  wiping table she retreated back behind food line continued blabbering away employees Spanish apparently comfortable continue leaving all other tables restaurant dirty   When finally order half selection trays looked almost empty dried out  acted annoyed some order choices required them cook fresh  mom only wanted water drink water cup  second time caregiver took mom's water cup over drink bar refill she put ice tea it  Manager noticed right away came over scolding Those cups water only you'll need pay tea! Yeah leave customers standing around waiting ten munites before bothered come wipe down dirty table but 94 year old woman drinking tea she didn't pay for   IMMEDIATE response  SCREW Panda Express! BOO HISS!   BTW   we paid them $1 72 demanded mom's tea   The last part negative experience actually happened while eating  started slowly become aware odor sour mop garbage  longer stayed more noticeable became  Determined coming BOTH inside garbage cans restaurant which filled brim No customers place but busy wipe off tables empty trash   only conclude smell when empty trash don't bother clean sanitize liner pails  GROSS!  I report none experienced any sickness food poisoning result meal here  When left concern back mind  If considering eating Panda Express much more pleased drive five more minutes location Durango 215  Panda Express knows doing  consistently fresh food clean pleasant interior really friendly employees really care your meal  <EOR> The realization Panda Express deal used late 1990s early 2000s  Today combo half fried rice veggie chow mein two entree choices tax costs $8 00+ What's worse today meager portioning your entree choices    this Panda Unit cheapest all Las Vegas     you home yes lots greasy fried rice chow mein but two tablespoons each your entree choices    a better deal ordering takeout entree steamed rice regular Chinese restaurant   enough feed two people $9 $10  <EOR> The food expect if you've ever Panda Express but say boy people busy! Thursday afternoon line practically door  guys cooking keep food coming  2 hispanic girls working line taking turns register did miss beat  welcomed when walked made eye contact ordered once paid your food thank very much   more most places   The bathrooms super clean!! <EOR>
