What? bitters use lot bitters  Bitters? yes    finally she told she tried both bitters overwhelming      The Guava Kamubcha cocktail interesting good way did enjoy it  bitters overwhelming    But then things very down hill  bringing drinks waitress walked table no less 6 times before taking order closer 11pm before even put food order  ok enjoying drinks but given happened later seems pretty absurd    The table next seated received food ahead place busy all 3 tables maybe few people bar  would guessed waitress break except she walked table often    The Hamptons burger w fries very good thick burger cooked nicely flavorful  Same fries  Wedge salad well constructed right amount tomatoes bacon lettuce  side ham mac cheese just ok trying better version your mother made growing but quite there  Avocado fries meh well  If you're looking replace amazing avocado fries found no longer Nine Palms you'll disappointed  artisan ketchup nice twist    The reason returning though happened end finished meal waitress brought check paid husband still finishing whiskey when different waiter came table said being very snotty would leave  need leave closed hour now  both taken aback rude pretentious attitude really didn't know say    would comical watched night play distance    We told Hamptons served until 11pm showed 10 30 waited good 30 minutes order even taken  restaurant claims seat serve until 11pm then also expects shut down close night    11PM?   I'll also add when arrived said 'two dinner' hostess made no mention things shutting down soon would need hurry order kitchen almost closing ect  told phone served until 11pm    It appears staff management need figure actual hours operations  serve until 11pm? lights 11pm? 10pm website says? If why did three people staff say 11pm  why another waiter kicking customers when they've only just finished meal served them 11pm?
