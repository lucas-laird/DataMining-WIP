Nasty!!!  lamb beef gyro Gyro Time belonged garbage plate   first time received gyros meat cold   sent them back   replacements warm but meat tasted rancid  tzaziki sauce did resemble sauce much congealed glop   tomatoes onion gyro looked tired   pita bread thick soggy   Overall very disappointing costly experience   upside fries tasty  <EOR> If only possible give zero stars      Ugh      A zero generous  place really deserving negative number! easily worst gyro ever ever ever ever ever ever had! actually some worst food tasted period!!! says lot because some REALLY BAD GRUB all corners earth!  The place clean service very friendly       but food? NASTAY!!!!!!! gyro combo side grilled zucchini friend felafel combo fries  meat extremely dry didn't even come menu described it  zucchini obviously frozen placed grill before defrosting  unseasoned consistency uncooked piece eel  Super tasteless slimy! friend's felafel more feel awful ! extremely dry tasteless well  also guess supposed hummus tzatziki? EEEKKK! tasted soiled paper towels more flavor better mouth feel! Needless say neither finished food despite fact both extremely hungry prior recieving orders   It really sad when best thing Greek joint ketchup packet  fact offered Barbecued Gyro dressed barbecue sauce American cheese should que exit    If area dying hunger      just ahead die! place best endorsement anorexia bulimia run across looooonnnnngggggg time!   If Zeus real he'd send lightening bolt joint tout suite! <EOR> I used location often   would order Junior gyro side gyro meat would take home salad doggies!  staff always young but friendly nice   Today ordered regular   immediatly noticed $3 more past   balked black girl behind counter said raised all prices apologetically   commented side meat must huge portion price  The food came LESS meat ever received before   side meat pretty much same Gyro   girl apologised offered some more   said would fine   minute later young white girl came over ask problem was   She said amount meat served could refund if wanted   told used come lot portion gone down but price up   response she worked 7 years always same amount   again commented am regular never seen before usually got   She told she general manager several locations quoted she probably learned fast food supervisor training tone voice exasperated teenager thinks know best  At point principle said would take refund   hope did reuse meat!  Even though food decent now priced par restaurant   If wanted snotty teenaged managers would just McDonalds   better experience Paymons Stephanos where great atmosphere booze  Just read other reviews add usually fairly clean exception manager staff usually pretty cool  <EOR> The food doesn't any fresher better place offers    delish <EOR> We coming all Gyro time locations Vegas since 1978 old store Desert Inn! favorite restaurants ever since then !
