We arrived few minutes late but seated immediately   ambiance Yukon Grille great bona fide old school steakhouse wood paneled walls large booths dimly lit dining area   clean crowded all the benefits late dinner obscure locals casino suppose     Our server Ann Marie knowledgeable menu promptly took order medium ribeye garlic mashed potatoes cesar salad husband petite filet creamed spinach shrimp gumbo soup me   bread bowl brought table 2 or 3? different types bread along butter   bread looked felt baked earlier day reheated microwave just prior serving the disadvantage late dinner suppose   My husband salad received soup very quickly   While he enjoyed salad think once again soup made way earlier evening just kept simmering all night   virtually pureed time it   think fresher would delicious but consistency way off bit off putting imagine probably sitting all night    Our entrees arrived timely manner right down nitty gritty   filet paired carrots asparagus creamed spinach   steak good   great horrible   Sufficient word comes mind   cooked way wanted but flavor lacking   bearnaise sauce saved day nice flavor boost along meat   Now creamed spinach?

We'll give another round future say maybe NYE 2025? <EOR> I very excited try restaurant family today  Reviews Yelp really good live nearby figured why not?   Personally enjoyed ambience restaurant  definitely old fashioned but nice charm it  rolling tables wait staff used did seem fit restaurant dirty waiters continually bumped into table which led drink being spilled  waitress dropped wine glass floor broke right front some glass under table  No apology  practically begged refills drinks which met attitude  It busy Sunday night restaurant but am always beyond polite shocked behavior  don't know if waitress brand new having bad day but she knew next nothing menu never asked wanted meat type potato would if wanted soup salad things all included  glad other reviewers better luck staff because waitress rude inattentive    Food arrived prime rib mashed potatoes I did pick both cold  Same family members' food   love steak which why never return restaurant  thought process if you're going spend $$ restaurant quality your food service restaurant should above average best  <EOR> Just let know because things important made trip recently coconut shrimp gone menu! b@$+@ #$! However offer new bacon wrapped option which didn't try because busy stuffing maws baked brie en croute delish !  Also plastic dressing cups replaced more appropriate ceramic ones  I'd upgrade them half star but can't we'll call push  Bring back coconut shrimp please! <EOR> I didn't know place but checked Yelp also looked menu online which does dinner special BTW until brother suggested all come celebrate December birthdays mine mom's  Nice quiet steakhouse pretty elegant ambiance faux fireplace mantle nicely decorated Christmas dim lighting  many customers if all older   Nice staff very attentive three servers 15 member group only baby   Excellent service   The dinner special posted front entrance post not menus given table   Three course meal $18 99 starter soup salad steak diane comes steamed vegetables chose baked potato came all fixings cheese sour cream butter green onion bacon bits dessert bread pudding ice cream creme brulee b day choice NY style cheesecake chocolate cake   complete lit candles birthday song     Since four parties came different times started bread basket pretzel bread   so yummy but stopped I could've more!!! everything bread roll hubby's fave cranberry bread slice   Once most group placed orders appetizers battered shrimp cilantro chutney mmm huge! really good calamari   two orders served fried tostada bowls which could eat too very good cooked perfectly   son really liked calamari which good thing because seems he getting picky days  didn't seem long wait each course arrive  servers kept checking took plates away  pretty quickly too   My salad blue cheese dressing size romaine lettuce cucumbers olives cherry tomatoes shredded carrot blue cheese crumbles nice but unexpected but some lettuce pieces brown edges which just picked out  steak medium well nice grill marks wasn't overly fatty but only finished half took home rest   am glad sauce side because very heavy my sister didn't it but cream based sauces usually heavy salty  A 1 sauce made better  baked potato perfect but only finished quarter yes leftovers!   Steamed vegetables skinny green string beans diced tomatoes couple bites noticed most teens did touch them   Hubby switched dessert the NY style cheesecake very dense but couldn't finish creme brulee because really full entire meal and love creme brulee   niece gladly welcomed ones couldn't finish  Most  group ice cream which old fashioned ice cream glass tall cups generous size!!!   mom also leftovers because she said she ate much bread crackers it's chips salsa mexican restaurants     My brother comp credit $200 $75 00 coupon final cost $49 99 because he club card use more discounts well  Thanks Kuya! group two younger ones total thirteen meals ordered  guess special used more choices but recently changed it  <EOR> Used good but going down fast!
