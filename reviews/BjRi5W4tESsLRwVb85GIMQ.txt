Was greeted gentleman   asked regarding grape slush saw yelp he said seasonal available menu     He really helpful asking kind drink looking for  told wanted something fruity   He explained difference fruit tea   Then while looking top 10 noticed called AMAZON asked was   he explained passionfruit blended along boba!  sounded really refreshing ahead ordered it   My husband ordered watermelon green tea seasonal drink   mom ordered Amazon but wanted only 25% sugar she's diabetic   They took while drinks putting love into each drink produce   watermelon green tea really refreshing   taste fresh watermelon juice then taste green tea   very interesting!  Even recommended Aloe topping   The Amazon looked pretty bright yellow pieces black boba floating around it tastes awesome when frozen slush    strong taste passionfruit   Perfect tartness refreshing flavour     My mom's amazon tasted just good thought without sugar would just taste sour but no just refreshing without all sugar   Awesome place nice decoration!

When order no boba drinks requested when ordered  told drink does come boba explained know  why requested add boba both drinks ordered  She gave confused face think she going bill again boba but point over place told forget it  even sorry wait sorry messing your order very disappointing really wanted regular since work nearby  glad there's twenty plus boba spots to     <EOR> Saw brother's friend review place    double checked brother legit    and     It is!   A Taiwanese boba shop! logo reminds Boba Guys SF  recommended watermelon green tea    divine!! Blended tea real watermelon  added boba that    good  boba definitely Bay Area Cupertino standards! <EOR> If love taste traditional brewed tea but jazzed toppings boba he'll ya look no further  far best tea place without high surgar powdery taste  actually taste tea!!!  With said place gets 4* instead 5 because customer service  visit place multiple times when visiting Vegas but each every time owner always seem bad mood  She seems physically but mentally  She's mean but definitely friendly borderling rude times when ask recommendations questions menu    The menu really confusing if plan going take gander online prior coming because menu no sense  don't serve food snacks  Only good quality flavored teas all toppings boba lychee aloe chia others   highly recommend place all tea boba lovers  <EOR> It favorites tea place milk tea addiction  but unfortunately closed next two three weeks  Renovations said new concept vegans option too  Let know guys  <EOR> I tried some drinks! favorite pineapple apple drink  made real fruits which best  iced coffee very good well  <EOR> You're reading you're thinking just another boba tea place   quite   While Vegas recently seen its fair share new boba shops mostly unimpressive quality gilded loud bells whistles distract true meaning good cup boba   But Mr  Z    My go to Mr  Z Boba Milk Tea   perfectly brewed mixed just right amount milk but still perfectly sweetened   perfect milk tea boba shouldn't require customer dictate sweet should be perfection perfection   However if favor deciding your own fate mean sweetness Mr  Z happy accommodate your liking   course boba itself always fresh perfectly al dente     Their Orange Green Tea Watermelon Green Tea also something write Yelp about   skeptic when first saw menu orange juice watermelon green tea? What   ? But don't knock till you've tried it!  Something mild tendency green tea flavor wonder why haven't heard thought kinds combinations before  while can't confirm if fresh squeezed orange juice most certainly tasted it!    The decor inside simple chic zebra wall decor huge if don't pay attention actually miss it! something Mr  Z both its drinks decor soothingly amplify simple chic elegance    Located smack Chinatown Spring Mountain right next Hong Kong Garden dim sum place doesn't more convenient this   Worry parking God awful parking lot say?  No worries two Mr  Z's patrons only parking spots right front park away enjoy some tea Mr  Z! <EOR> Came when opened around 11ish  cold day craving hot boba drink  boba wasn't ready time when came disappointed  also microwave hot drink instead steaming it  taste tea bit light side <EOR> This place some amazing tea mango slush very light taste highly recommend <EOR> Fave milk tea place Las Vegas  even mini bobas!
