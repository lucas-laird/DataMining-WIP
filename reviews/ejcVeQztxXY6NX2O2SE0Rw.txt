Don't wrong servers amazing both Drea Rachel absolutely BEST!!      BUT GM Scott horrible customer service UNLESS you're personal friend he won't talk try help coming months now consider self regular seeing everyone else remembers once he approached introduced himself literally sat bar over hour he never once asked if needed anything  seen give much more attention buddy's then everyone else favoritism really factor when comes only reason come location Still because bartenders they're awesome feel welcomed absolute best serve you   Corporate really needs talk replace cause he needs serious improvement  <EOR> I spent couple evenings PTs always fun time  good music karaoke well  There's woman always working when she Texas!

My husband walked sat down tables  No greeted us  decent amount people inside but place packed  browsed menu waited 20 minutes no came help us  Finally husband bar asked bartenders if could order drinks food  She told don't any servers everything would ordered bar  Wow would nice if someone greeted let know first place! Right!?  The menu little different Sierra Gold's Sierra's better opinion   looking forward least having bbq pork stuffed potato skins but didn't those here  ended ordering club wrap NO tomatoes which course came tomatoes  husband ordered buffalo chicken sliders he ordered past  time made them way spicy  both didn't enjoy meals  Also did give any napkins    The bartender gave wrong bill first  She gave correct complained  Then she accidentally charged card BOTH bills! believe that? She said she voided charges but wasn't very apologetic  checked account few days later sure thankfully wasn't charged twice    They really need train employees customer service!  *Sigh* Never again     <EOR>
