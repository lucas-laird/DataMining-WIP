She then walked didn't say anything am suppose mind reader know am suppose follow now  table proceeds throw menus silverware table walks away without saying anything   When waiter comes he introduces self then proceeds sit down next booth long lost friend  Maybe he really tired  He tells specials gives few minutes decide  When waiter comes back he again proceeds sit down right next take order  ahead order when food comes 30 minutes later different person brings us  place table walk away single word comes mouth during entire process  once during entire meal did server refill drinks  If really enjoy terrible service place you  rest spend your money else where  <EOR> The deep dish pizza    good ambience   excellent service  all worth visit     never disappointed  <EOR> Much better expected brewhouse    Although kind loud place great food great price and course great beers while being family friendly hit  great price Summerlin well expected pay much more  casual contemporary decor also done well if kind style  <EOR> BJ Fantastic happy hours  Fast service  Great food   Service Outstanding   I really nothing negative say BJ!!!

Maybe shortage idk  knew ask immediately time did bring pretty quickly    Having said all all really enjoyed food  chicken tortilla soup very good mac cheese excellent chopped salad great huge recognized service good did try it  also made very tasty margarita worth another visit  <EOR> I disappointed smoked hickory barbecue sandwich  Nowhere menu description mention base ingredient hamburger patty   brisket layered top patty bacon   When sandwich called smoked brisket would expect taste hamburger  <EOR> We large barbeque chicken pizza  50% off monday  Service friendly  Beer cold  <EOR> Had best experience tonight nicest friendliest servers ever any restaurant!

Hmm   also food order wrong   Now understand gets very hectic all some occasions  But no way cater paying customers    Everything slow barely any water refills? But when came giving bill hella quick? Cmon now     Improvements made  Thank you  <EOR> Like someone else reviewed another solid meal B J s    live Summerlin very close variety neighborhood restaurants several nights week BJ's works quick substantial meal  Service always efficient friendly lots items menu quick exchange items if aren't par  Still waiting week end prime rib staff always raves about'm <EOR> Pizza always specialty tried few personal size   The beer pretty good too  wasn't sure place would good date but rather fun  seated close bar which worked well  rather family heavy crowd general  ginormous menu Cheesecake Factory size which find annoying   I Italian spicy thin crust pizza very tasty  love spicy pie! The 4 beer sampler good too  dining partner happy hour beer wasn't offered another before happy hour ends which good server should always do! He did another happy hour price asking crisis averted! <EOR> This BJ's never seems disappoint me  Today lunch waiter nice! food also came very quickly today  surprised!  I half pasta soup salad lunch combo  ordered spicy tomato spaghetti bowl clam chowder  Reason why soup because last time house salad didn't really it  didn't enough dressing seemed little dry  spaghetti really spicy but light kick different type tomato sauce but enjoyable  really good price $9! boyfriend clam chowder bread bowl which $8  clam chowder really good! comes hot fresh  He adds little tobasco more flavor just way is   We calamari appetizer delicious well  crispy pretty decent size  seen bigger other places but complaining  $10 25 believe    As dessert ALWAYS pizookie! Chocolate chip vanilla ice cream always traditional way go! yummy always hits spot   Because BJs card holder able $10 off $35 more just reached $36  deal good! Imagine if 4 people come everyone ordered off lunch menu     deal!!  This place clean friendly pretty good food  Cajun pasta shrimp scampi both very flavorful  also angel hair Classico which flavorful but good if don't want strong flavored pasta  pizzas yummy shareable size!
