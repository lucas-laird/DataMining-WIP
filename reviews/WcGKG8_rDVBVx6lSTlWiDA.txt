Tortilla delicious crispy pork barbacoa yummy  sweet flavor which added taste  Maybe little expensive if did coupon delicious food money am super happy! <EOR> This review Cafe Rio  I LOVE Cafe Rio when opened close excited opening day!  There something different tortillas    they tasted    stale  bit stingy meat    Came several more times hopes would become henderson centennial ones love    I watched several times tortillas cook them early pull them bag instead serving fresh  beyond STINGY meat  asked extra meat which pay for legit gave only 2 TBS more!  DISAPPOINTED! <EOR> This Cafe Rio far worst Las Vegas  serving chicken ANYWHERE else 3x amount give here  watched worker actually take some back bowl  rice always gamble  regular rice there's chance cook dump entire container salt  always order shredded chicken salad regular portions always give bigger lid  place however easily place smaller lid on  Overall just avoid Cafe Rio specifically  only reason okay giving place one star because gave free salad because screwup  <EOR> Cafe rio plenty times just love it  Better Chipotle rubios ect   always salad never disappointed maybe day venture off something else but salad good give up   But yesterday came wanted steak none left wait 15 minutes some when talking good customer service didn't charge double meat both salads!!! Gave free drink extra stamps frequency card continually apologized made feel important would give 5 stars alone  back soon  <EOR> I mean Cafe Rio pretty good  But kinda irritating when workers more interested flirting each other finishing order  then soon order came off conveyor belt all disappeared  employee cashier also  Very rude  <EOR> Close work always busy location but why everyone always working hard friendly  Even during lunch rush everyone polite considerate  Martin usually helps when pick order he u feel you're 5 star restaurant  Food amazing always fresh  even review your order before leave  Come almost daily lunch  Much better other locations  <EOR> Ah OK   Apparently new Café Rio took over used bead store yes store bead buying galore now most frequented lunch spots area   Located right behind McDonald's certainly hubbub patrons   But come Café Rio   basically same other ones around town competitor other build your own burrito taco bowl salad place Chipotle   Coincidentally right down street Lake Mead near N Burger Chipotle   comes down personal preference   if you're looking really hard pricing soft drinks   I'll admit darn fine salad   If right burrito internally combusted   huge!  probably now Café Rio   salad starts warm tortilla bottom tray   Then topped your choice meat I roast beef pork beans I black but sometimes back to pinto   cilantro rice   Then healthy I heavy portion romaine lettuce any other sauces salsas   opt some corn pico de gallo cheese sour cream small scoop guacamole   Then top bad boy some fried tortilla strips!  also choose creamy cilantro dressing salad   bottle hot sauce later good eats land!  But salad set back hefty $8 9 depending your choice meat   cheapest option meal considering doesn't come drink   But does Café Rio some good drinks!  only Coca Cola product served also your choice some Mexican classics!  Horchata your refill hearts content   basic meal drink cost roughly $10 11   most value but if play well yourself honkingly large entrée   Think extras!    Taste OK   tortillas Café Rio actually pretty good when warm seems fresher made Chipotle   Café Rio's creamy cilantro dressing but prefer Chipotle's vinaigrette whole lot more   Plus Chipotle edges pricing tad being $1 2 cheaper per entrée depending get   But Chipotle serves no Horchata!  But serve Corona!  really kinda evens out   Just boils all down personal preference which feel eating day   If choose neither some Mexican food probably end Roberto's    bad choice either   Ole! <EOR> Cafe Rio if fav tex mex places eat   This location little lackluster   dirty messy inside  A lot tables old food them drinks area tons ice spilled liquids everywhere  The staff nice quickly orders processed  girl took order let try new green sauce which actually pretty good ordered side it   My food still good usual  ordered chicken quesadilla huge!
