The decor standard white table cloths music overhead mixed hardly noticed customers dressed tennis wear linen dresses one gentlemen did business suit   would comfortable nice jeans shorts golf shirts Vegas  <EOR> Fancy brunch hit spot made feel full but greasy I just binged on bacon full    Waitstaff pointe  waitress even comped detox juice when friend said tasted horrible  Gotta love that  <EOR> Fancy fusiony restaurant   Came Sunday brunch buffet   Nice variety   However enough turnover lot food just sitting there   Good entree choices but did all live expectations   Good try bibimbop fine steak eggs others enjoyed it scallops could softer more tender oysters sitting great BUT asked chef fresh ones he decorates all fancy delicious! desserts good variety breads good variety  Avoid ramen horrible  bad broth  bad noodles  bad ingredients   get!  This place could good if more turnover food would fresher   Overall Food ok service GREAT! price pricey atmosphere nice some windows look something <EOR> Dibattito interiore prima di decidere quante stelline dare   l'indecisione balla dal 3 al 5 per alcuni aspetti  Innanzitutto ambiente   spettacolare siamo las vegas no? Tutto deve essere eccessivo   molto chic ed elegante anche troppo direi  Ambiente talmente impostato da mettere un pó disagio e con aria condizionata palla anche questa sicuramente non è una pecca del locale ma del paese   Il menù è interessante e scegliamo dei crunchy roll dim sum di gamberi e un pad thai  roll sono qualcosa di veramente spettacolare delicati e saporiti insieme   molto equilibrati e piacevoli  dim sum si sente che sono freschissimi e il gambero è assoluto padrone  Anche il pad thai si difende alla grande spicy ma non troppo e con gamberi quantità! Bella cena buona cena     Ma la temperatura bassa e l'eccesso di impostazione di fanno scappare via gambe levate! Ultima nota prezzi linea con un buon posto Milano 80$ due   <EOR> Ate twice Mozen Bistro breakfast while staying Mandarin  Unfortunately am forced give place 1 star rating   After waiting seemed eternity served greater 45 minutes found LONG black hair entwined Huevos Rancheros  beyond disgusting! no idea didn't see there  eggs literally stuck hanging off hair when lifted fork    I absolutely starving nearly cry sight hair  When reported waiter he apologized took plate  While preparing new order pick off everyone else's plate because hungry  grudgingly ate newly prepared huevos only because still hungry    otherwise would bailed whole situation   This definitely isn't first hair found food but pretty disturbing when find place charges $12 bowl Cheerios  Mozen expensive exclusive  should held higher standard iHop when comes quality control    Why 1 star?   * Hair food  Probably enough said  * insanely overpriced restaurant exclusive hotel felt hair warranted apology restaurant manager someone charge  When mistake magnitude deserves sincere apology  * only comped huevos rancheros bill  felt kind chintzy   What could earned 3 star?  * apology management * more generous compensation just simply replacing hair laden dish new charging it  probably think whole bill should comped since only breakfast $400 dinner bill  guest hotel  <EOR> Just stumbled into Mozen Bistro chance  minute sat down knew treat  atmosphere calm serene which much appreciated noise surrounding bling Vegas  waitstaff spectacular food really good interesting  more full on experience rather just nice dinner  waitress suggested banana split dessert which sounds quite ordinary but most amazing dessert ever had  $14 00 which alot book but again experience taste worth price  <EOR> Best Sunday

siew yoke sashimi both pretty stuffed   Dishes good except char siew pork siew yoke didn't care one   sashimi excellent   Overall good but nothing wow especially price 10 12 bucks per plate   Kinda

 still dream day    Also order hot tea elegant afternoon tea  <EOR> My girlfriend came ate breakfast four times guests hotel late lunch time   The breakfast standard nothing special  Mozen serves traditional breakfast items nothing unique creative besides Japanese breakfast bento box which best thing ordered over four days  Everything else just okay    Lunch also okay    The prices very expensive quality food  place certainly beats going buffet though  <EOR> Review brunch only     Ate brunch Thanksgiving Justin B really liked MOzen  restaurant 3rd floor Mandarin Oriental seated table window view Aria pedestrian bridge which made fun people watch while eating haha  brunch buffet but also served entree part meal well $69 i think special holiday pricing yes bit pricey brunch but its much more your normal brunch buffets major hotels thought quality food very high  plus another $19 unlimited mimosas definitely splurge brunch but we're vacation why haha  for buffet impressed selection  seafood consisted oysters crab claws shrimp cocktail some nigri rolls smoked salmon  also station salads particularly enjoyed pesto pasta salad  there's also some fruit oatmeal granola but needs buffet haha  carving station well complete turkey stuffing ham prime rib roasted veggies  favorite noodle station where able won ton soup  hard really full buffet selection before actual entree haha  then when you're ready tell your server fire your entree scallops since didnt want anything heavy  dish comes 2 scallops really good! very moist flavorful served some veggies  oh desserts! amazing caramel macarons creme brulee chocolate mouuse much more  hard stop haha  overall really enjoyed brunch experience here! buffet small enough where you're overwhelmed million food choices million people waiting line food  didnt deal any big crowds since take reservations seated right away instead waiting hours eat haha  plus since its smaller scale buffet felt quality freshness ingredients better most buffets  added bonus actually mimosas when need refill rather some buffets seen them pre made just sitting pitcher ready pour serve  <EOR> MOzen located Mandarin Oriental Hotel second pull into valet area zen mode   Because no casino hotel peaceful serene   When pulled into secluded driveway only couple other cars   refreshing sea honking horns cabs     When walked music lobby soft soothing music elevators took 3rd floor where restaurant located  Again refreshing hear slot machines nor walk through haze cigarette smoke     The waitress explained Restaurant Week menu most zen like soothing voice  service fantastic everyone   Seated window view City Center almost forgot Las Vegas  experience Restaurant Week lunch menu $30 13 ordered although other menu items did look enticing       The bento box filled Murgh Makhani Tandoori roasted marinated chicken creamy indian curry  favorite dish even better Garlic Naan accompanies it  Salmon Crudo Tartare marinated hearts palm  second favorite dish  Miso mustard NY certified angus miso mustard sauce   beef bit chewy but sauce very flavorful  California roll lump crab avocado cucumber   just meh   Matcha Tiramisu mascarpone green tea mousse raspberry coulis   delicious but size 2 dice  time didn't think bento box enough food   almost tempted order some sushi sushi bar   However am glad didn't because drive home food settled realized stuffed was     I really enjoyed offerings am now intrigued return   also breakfast menu addition lunch dinner served   If looking away city without leaving definitely give MOzen try experience tranquil zen state  <EOR>
