Don't hesitate bring date family just yourself  Btw nice happy hour too  <EOR> Wanted check place since saw before opened Town Square  little curious going about    I'm still bit unclear whole motif but pretty much name gives away American seafood spot    We started raw oysters which quite fresh  Its served horseradish cream sauce which new me  asked regular horseradish but informed don't it    They signature dish shrimp spicy broth  cooked hours ensure all spices mixed well together real kick  server explained few customera before said 10 far spice course loving spicy anything    try it  Thw killer shrimp served few different ways rice pasta just shrimp crab etc killer shrimp pasta  shrimps pretty large honest broth pretty good 10 spice opinion more 7  If don't spicy foods would caution maybe stay away  Which way wonder why signature dish everyone eat since everyone likes spicy    The broth served French bread dipping which nice touch since lot broth shouldn't waste  pasta part meal unfortunately disappointment  very bland honestly flavorless definitely just carb filler    Definitely recommend clam chowder  really best chowders ever tasted am lover clam chowder soup    As service initial impression wasn't very good  bit reluctant because few reviews read did say bad service was  host stand outside but nobody there  waited few minutes before walking inside asking busser walking if suppose seat ourselves  He said no found someone seat us  sure point host stand  server little bit realized she th only floor  did feel bad because she running table table inside outside  Granted wasn't super busy but when counted 11 tables she serving all 3 more people   weekday but also 7 30pm would think would more servers on  knows maybe off night but being alone she did pretty good    Overall ok <EOR> I really enjoyed popcorn shrimp today!!! bad all   Caesar salad great   Yes!!

Because was  literally ten staff members standing around then lone patrons building    So gentleman use restroom sure someone would before he came back  He suggested order couple things  But no ever came  Lol  quite comical  He came back made big fuss it really just small fuss even receiving water  which heard bickering charge table even question where another server apparently lunch but yes finally server came over  She said she would bring waters    Simple enough right ?!  But never came either  just ended leaving dining elsewhere  really wanted try killer shrimp too  Shame  <EOR> Everything killer shrimp paella lobster mac cheese crabcakes delicious! bad however amount killer heat can't adjusted  bit hot couple those party  Service outstanding too  surely return  Kids eat free Tuesdays! <EOR> this company doesn't even deserve 1 star  son employee company since day 1 opening Las Vegas bounced pay check once but 5 times 10 month period  gas turned off due non payment beer alcohol deliveries delayed due non payment consistently paying vendors  while food may taste bad company poor ownership poor management  please don't support restaurant dont take care employees young men women work hard disrespected  when owners think more themselves pay employees  <EOR> It might but when order lunch menu charge full price overlooked   But when tell don't give back change only dollar bills annoying!

Which way less originally considered given  Nevertheless clam chowder tasted clams gritty appealing all! Maybe should just stick shrimp contacting better business bureau practices keeping patrons change! <EOR> My first impression very good  service less adequate especially when restaurant nearly empty 5 00 Saturday night  told happy hour but only domestic imported beer special  course beer wanted stuck paying full price during happy hour  top off conveniently draft wanted but did bottles more expensive  Obviously clear whole happy hour concept  Maybe should across walk way Yard House see means  As far food scallops excellent  Unfortunately disappointed whole experience  <EOR> Eat before food good good service  Just tried again but time service garbage  gentleman door couldn't seat outside cuz he didn't know weren't anymore tables available  when did table serve came bad attitude letting know she suppose behind bar  told due leap year today being 29th Feb all day happy hour  Then changed mind big attitude  left Yard House  <EOR> First all am happy finally place husband shrimp seafood fix plenty options other chicken fingers I'm looking Hot n Juicy  Everything awesome  definitely over ordered but  something tend when trying new spot   You could tell food all fresh  Clam chowder point made miss being back home Bay Area  tuna poke delicious!

I said Belgian white because  exactly called menu but responded hefeweizen  Instead brought 2 shock top   15 minutes later  asked if could move outside because even though just two sat table 6 inches another couples table felt practically top strangers sat next us  When finally food somewhat good which why they're getting 2 stars  However portions ridiculously small prices charged  4 scallops $22? meal obviously quick once received food won't back  $95 before tip which only did good conscious performance server rediculous  <EOR> The calamari habanero tartar sauce amazing   Fried shrimp very good sweet   peeled killer shrimp bowl served French bread   Good broth little spicy  why serve lot French bread think   Laura server attentive helpful ask ! bread pudding yummy hot fudge sundae huge separate gravy boat real hot fudge !
