Once restaurant excited try everything see if authentic seems outside  However greeted rude server just looked if confused  He told party sit anywhere tried looking place where clean crowded  Once ready order asked server big tacos he said mean big tacos are? if stupid   mean small tacos where need order least 4 fill slightly larger ones don't need order much  use hands explain meant  When finished ordering just realized closing 5 minutes maybe  why he rude  Once realized decided just take food thinking would easier everyone restaurant  server saying okay  but sure he just saying that  hate being last customer eating   already felt unwanted restaurant wanted leave soon possible   The food came really fast everything packed plastic bag   including sauces literally    EVERYTHING! When home more like    build your own taco tostado ahogada    Tacos en Barbacoa amazing! really really liked taco meat   oh larger tacos btw  twice size small ones ordered two which filled up! guess liked because didn't really build own taco  just put sauce side condiments just placed inside   probably ONLY thing liked   Tostado en Carne myself    would probably better if but wasn't good   portion huge! definitely Tacos El Gordo better  smaller portions which easier eat melted cheese    yum!  Tortas Ahogadas did look good picture  just didn't period  don't see hype about    Overall give place 3 STARS  If wasn't delicious tacos would given place 2 STARS  Service definitely better  felt unwelcomed if didn't want serve should told place closing 5 minutes instead looking if lost confused  <EOR> This place definitely those  little holes wall but let tell you   when comes authentic Guadalajara style tortas ahogadas doesn't any better this  only everything menu absolutely finger licking good but salsas amazing well! restaurant little small seating limited but well worth it  favorite things order lonche caliente tacos dorados carne top  <EOR> Very small restaurant but food worth wait if one  torta augado definitely try  <EOR> Torta ahogada=your mouth fire  no joke! fast service we ordered go  place hole wall but does disappoint so glad started yelping came across while back ago! wish tortas little bigger    they're big enough share if you're really hungry   overall we're addicted spicy sauce can't wait back! <EOR> OK hesitant when first walked very happy parking situation only because place tiny cluttered full kids running everywhere ran into hard nobody even flinched  getting annoyed because first nobody acknowledged until employee sitting front eating told guy register he needed help finally order took minute but fine really craving someone told really good  finally horchata torta ahogada surprise everything perfectly packed secure smelled delicious  home absolutely wonderful  Everything tasted great tomato sauce full flavor spicy sauce w onions good super spicy scale 1 10 20!
