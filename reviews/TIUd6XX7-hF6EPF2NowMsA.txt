Great pleasure meet Mona today! She heard heading lunch young daughter offered ideas packaging sandwich easier  Super sweet attentive  She's asset Subway  <EOR> So just order sandwich platter  told $54 00 but questioning girl kinds sandwiches she directed catering brochures  Well prices all $38 when asked where $54 dollar she quoted she didn't know  Then asked if could cut sandwiches into 4 because trying them little reception told sandwiches won't fit tray then  What? doesn't even sense  asked if could just split them onto two trays which told he'd call manager see if could that! only reason came because office secretary recommended them said could even cut sandwiches into fours trays $35! place doesn't operate Subway she employees don't know talking here! Kind frustrating experience place across street gave exactly looking but little more $   fine overall better experience  <EOR> I am slightly disappointed particular subway  hardly ever give bad reviews but hopefully brings attention whoever charge  came today around 2 30 slow two kids working did seem wanted there  When ready order let them know just keep talking each other  some small talk but conversation seemed much more important  felt rushed gal just wrapped sandwich before finish telling wanted it  work service industry know should treat customers did feel very welcomed through whole visit  <EOR> Subway pretty standard  clean quiet quick   usually greeted soon enter store  always good sign  employees johnny spot whipping your crazy sandwhich combinations  <EOR> Subway always safe bet consistency quick healthy enough lunch   This location convenient employees good quick service  They're very friendly always see owner behind counter helping serve needed   They honor deals coupons if them location    Being pregnant miss cold cut combo but meatball suffices meantime!
