Wir hatten Gutscheine von restaurant com und das war der Hauptgrund für den Besuch  Die Gutscheine wurden ohne Probleme angenommen und entsprechend angerechnet  Der Laden ist sehr klein  Deutschland würde man etwas wohl als Luxus Imbiss mit Tagsüber Geschäft bezeichnen  Innen gibt es nur sehr wenig Sitzplätze außen gibt es etwas mehr Sitzgelegenheiten aber auch reichlich bettelnde Tauben  Wir hatten uns Sandwiches bestellt  Diese wurden frisch zubereitet und waren großzügig belegt  Geschmacklich waren die Sandwiches okay  Wir hatten außerdem noch eine Portion Fritten dazu bestellt  Diese sind aber eher nicht empfehlen etwas matschig   Der dazu bestellte Kaffee einmal normal einmal Latte war sehr zu empfehlen   Die Tische waren nur semi sauber eine regelmäßige Reinigung der freien Tische haben wir nicht miterlebt  Das Publikum besteht hauptsächlich aus Bürokräften die der Nachbarschaft arbeiten   Das Espression Cafe ist sehr nah der Fremont Street  Man geht praktisch auf Höhe des Binions zum Golden Nugget und dann noch etwas weiter geradeaus   Wichtig Der Laden hat nur tagsüber geöffnet   Tipp Man bekommt immer sehr günstig Gutscheine über restaurant com  <EOR> Awesome place nice coffee great delicious food!!!
