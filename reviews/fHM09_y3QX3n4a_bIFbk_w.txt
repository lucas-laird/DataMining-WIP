Why would reservation month advance 14 people if didn't want secure table could accommodate whole group?! if restaurant policy then should informed when booked because might changed decision birthday brunch there  didn't find management staff very friendly helpful  Food decent but worth less ideal seating arrangement despite advance planning  <EOR> Great food  Service little slow  Try mushroom burger  Amazing  right Venetian next casino area really convenient if stay there  <EOR> If craving pho then highly recommend try Zen noodles  fantastic! sure plenty lemongrass soup broth which wasn't salty all  Definitely cheaper getting pho Zine! <EOR> We breakfast two mornings row   Service great food delicious!!!

I kinda hate Cheesecake Factory's food  feel gone down over years novelty's worn off  But Grand Lux's food  everything amuses me  Especially chicken lettuce wraps  don't chicken much definitely lettuce but man   Reasons jump Grand Lux bandwagon chicken lettuce wraps never wait they grilled cheese's when drunk even though menu the actual restaurant strip good food doesn't cost paycheck unlimited bread short rib grilled cheese sandwich  Confession #2 tme when hungover still drunk alone room Palazzo called down takeout ordered myself fried calamari salad 1 2 sandwich soup combo chicken lettuce wraps all less $30  If there's cure morning depression laying helluva lot food hotel bed lying down resting whatever eating tummy while watch tv  BOOM  Sexiness reincarnated  <EOR> Food Lots options  owned same company CheeseCake Factory really similar menu options  Overall party did any complaints dishes   They also offer all eat breakfast options    Service waitress great! She very energetic outgoing funny  Quick tentative    Atmosphere Beautiful restaurant! <EOR> Service nice  Every time gone ordered Fettuccini Alfredo must say never disappointed esp  when your good one  rare ahi salad scrumptious  Good 2 4 people  <EOR> Ordered pasta fresca  Very bland flavoring pasta under cooked veggies best gardens sure   place scores lower average cheese cake factory  <EOR> Unfortunately highlight meal drinks although ridiculously overpriced Asian Nachos appetizer   Seriously only thing salvaged potentially 0 star review    The Crispy Calamari Rock Shrimp very chewy tasted undercooked  could literally taste batter immediately sent back    Entrées ordered Korean Fried Chicken Burrito which epitome lackluster bland  top off only side pairings dish choice house side salad fries complimenting all Asian inspired dish   My boyfriend ordered Bourbon Street Chicken which turned BUTTER fried chicken topped mashed potatoes  He immediately ran bathroom regurgitate just few bites because ridiculously high butter content dish    To matters worse manager never even made point visit table offer apology even check having sent TWO items away    Definitely biggest let down dining experience 6 days here     even ASK bread halfway through meal because none ever brought us   Moral story looks deceiving  See pics <EOR> If you're staying Palazzo great breakfast place  buffet best pastry chef world eggs Benedict actually best says menu  early because 10 am you'll wait but worth he wait  Really enjoyed it  <EOR> More impressed thought would be  food salads great nothing fancy  also did buffet breakfast morning good  No complaints place overall  <EOR> Vegas always included jumbalya Grand Lux  Sadly disappointed  Over cooked shrimp salty no longer perfect fluffy rice  others mention probably last visit here  Grand Lux happened?! <EOR> Bad pricey food  wings fries tea  Ended spending $25  wings gross fries really below average   I would given 2 stars if paid $15 but even then food would just close I'd expect restaurant serving wings fries    The service good but doesn't bad quality food  <EOR> I am always search good happy hour deal friend raved Grand Lux Café years when decided finally try pleasantly surprised find offered happy hour  and pretty decent that  But while prices great food just OK   Draft beers $4 regularly $7 myriad appetizers $5 50 each  Because normal app prices $9 $11 range thought would smaller portions  Nope  HUGE! ordered Asian nachos my friend's favorite husband ordered potato spring rolls  Both items visually appealing but sadly lacked flavor  nachos tasty peanut sauce but fried wontons tasted little Styrofoam wasn't much chicken speak of  while spring rolls topped cheese crispy bacon mashed potato filling pretty bland  give them points creativity can't complain much $5 50 pop but wouldn't pay full price item   Grand Lux pretty extensive full menu if choose eat restaurant happy hour bar only might better luck  But if you're part Strip you're looking great happy hour walk few blocks down Yard House Linq  Beer little more expensive but food better view killer! <EOR> The Grand Luxe excellent service fantastic food  parmesan pork chop recommendation     wow! Can't believe said wow pork chop but great! Veggies cooked perfectly  back  <EOR> This great restaurant!  Loved menu options moderately priced large portions tasty food   think related Cheesecake Factory decor looks exactly Cheesecake Factory without long line   They start off some nice warm crunchy sour dough bread   ordered small portion crispy calamari appetizer   Nice size small portion   They really nice Chicken Caesar salad   breakfast portions large couldn't finish   swear must use five eggs breakfast platter   I'm pretty nosey love check everyone else eating   Everything huge looked fabulous!  They only down side dinner fries served cold   soon brought waitresses attention she brought fresh batch friend  pretty quick     We Palazzo hotel surprised empty   bellman hotel suggested because he said Venetian always crowded   I would definitely recommend restaurant would definitely stop again next visit! <EOR> When friends used comped rooms Palazzo every month would always eat here   located right next elevators very convenient grab breakfast really late early snack   Same kind food you'd expect Cheesecake Factory   also breakfast buffet   But sure ask time ends because menu said 11am but when closed 10am some kind event   server failed mention when buffet closed 10am bummed didn't even dessert  <EOR> I see lot comparison Cheesecake Factory see some that   decor quite similar maybe some dishes comparable but prices bit steeper   Since kinda late morning still mood breakfast   ordered all meat omelette some coffee   waiter quite attentive coffee water always topped up   When food came couldn't believe omelette came place   egg looked sheet if yellow plastic wrapping around chopped pieces meat   looked cooked separately rather together should be   few bites couldn't take anymore tell waiter unacceptable   also missing shredded cheddar he recognized it   When new omelette came actually looked egg time   sad part stuffed eat any wasn't take home back room     I give service 5 stars but restaurant 3 stars   meat quite delish but screw omelette forget cheese? <EOR> Great food! Love co workers always order here!

Apparently order supplies based last year's orders   but if run can't record someone's order because computer won't let then your order always underestimate? really annoyed way handled staff administrative level   I would back here  If you're picky want eat you'll fine  know picky easy flexible when screw up  <EOR> Sunday Brunch delicious   chicken waffles yummy   salmon mash potatoes yummy   many choices stuffed   right when switching breakfast lunch breakfast items mostly gone   jambalaya wasn't great me   but everything else great next time Vegas definitely back   <EOR> I Las Vegas last week celebrating brother's birthday since going watch friend perform bar Pallazio he chose Grand Lux Cafe    I admit memories place little faded due large quantities alcohol consumed over 24 hour period but remember especially liking buffalo wing egg roll appetizers entrée which Mongolian Steak dish which served white rice very fresh flat bread  served medium rare delicious    The only reason 4 instead five star chicken pasta dishes ordered arrived bit cool standards rest dishes    It overall good meal look forward eating again  <EOR> Love place!  people Cheesecake Factory 24 hours!  even though Palazzo prices bad   Nuff said! <EOR> Tried Grand Lux cafe first time past weekend LOVED it!

The first visit ordered Asian inspired chicken dish Zen Noodles which lots fun  Asian chicken dish slightly sweet orange chicken would be  came insane amount rice included sugar snap peas which love    The Zen Noodles came large amount spinach other greens huge bowl soup broth chicken pieces extra coup pour over your concoction you'd added all bits bowl want  seemed really 'clean' menu item really appreciate options nature  particularly sour ish flavor sure was  If don't sour tangy may want skip one   On second visit ordered off 'after midnight' menu  pizza appetizer section also burger  If hadn't already fairly stuffed chocolate Hershey place prior would devoured entire pizza  anything extraordinarily special but simple flavors nothing funny could detect  Both items good    Fair warning portions HUGE! Seriously  could split any item down middle both satisfied    The decor venue elegant seems fairly private casino unless ask sit casino floor section  wait staff always polite quick kept water glasses full    I recommend! <EOR> Good food Decent service kind depressing ambiance   give 3 stars overall   3 stars because Grand Lux Cafe Venetian as opposed Palazzo enjoyed much more   much more lively inviting   Palazzo made feel dark forgotten corner Casino which did enjoy all   Also may probably own fault but having seated booth made just feel cheap diner     I salmon which actually quite delightful but entire experience kind just bogged down rest environment   love cheesecake which lesser GLC love Grand Lux Venetian but most likely won't coming back Palazzo again  <EOR> Its cheescake factory theyre same company but opinion cheescake factory better lol  more menu options   Anyway Grand Lux atmosphere almost identical cheescake factory dimmed lights marble floors walls nicely structured place  I think palazzo better food    chef venetian  Better service too   We ordered th ceviche which fresh delicious ordered jambalaya  bad! definitely isnt best restauarant town but its good i'd back if im staying palazzo venetian again  <EOR> This first time visiting restaurant  Vegas family reunion night buy dinner  9 all adults  best meals ever Vegas  More food could finish under$250!! 9 adults!!

Tea awesome too! great location <EOR> Not fully sold different version cheesecake factory   Food came cold then dry because think just threw under heat lamps warm back up   Im disappointed just because expecting bit more restaurant based busy every time walk by   figured must busy because good but apparently its just strip foot traffic   Management just gave disgusted look when informed them food came cold good when came out  left more then half plate he acted  trying bill   Debating if would ever return friends actually enjoyed place debatable best  Oh well live learn  <EOR> This restaurants visit EVERY TIME Vegas bar none!  place open 24 hours serves DELICIOUS FOOD something find very rare 24 hour establishment     There's long story restaurant sister restaurant Cheesecake Factory another favorite mine !  Apparently when Venetian being built wanted put Cheesecake Factory there   But due fact there's already Cheesecake Factory a few blocks down strip Caesar's Forum Shops Cheesecake Factory wouldn't allow another location just blocks away another Cheesecake Factory   developer Venetian negotiated deal open very similar restaurant but different name menu   glad did that!    Favorite items include fried chicken waffles ask regular maple syrup instead maple butter sauce normally comes it Indochine chicken shrimp amazing flavors ingredients delicious choice!  Oh order box freshly baked chocolate chip cookies run circles around Mrs  Fields any other cookies ever purchased taste exactly Tollhouse cookies mother used recipe back Nestle Chocolate Chips delicious tastes use real butter same ingredients you'd use if making cookies scratch not preservatives high fructose corn syrups margerine other crappy ingredients ready bake cookie dough supermarkets   every time Vegas!    Definitely if best 24 hour restaurants ever to!  probably tried place dozen times food always excellent!  haven't found any other 24 hour restaurants Vegas or anywhere else except maybe Los Angeles worth eating at!  Try place sure you'll glad did! <EOR> I've eaten several times when Vegas food consistently good  place related linked Cheesecake factory if you've you'll find Grand Lux menu pricing familiar    When home turf wouldn't consider Cheesecake Factory expensive eat but wouldn't call cheap eat either  However Vegas standards Grand Lux quality food served quite moderately priced  love always open  Vegas when you're late hungry 2am later  awesome   I've tried few things everything good but most memorable grilled cheese short rib sandwich lunch time  literally best grilled cheese sandwich I'd ever life  only way ever want eat grilled cheese now on  <EOR> I very rarely see beef Wellington when going eat  Very surprised see offered here  Its absolutely spectacular disappointed  doesn't look traditional beef Wellington but definitely taste it!! <EOR> The food great! Although keep mind bit tipsy when came here  If same applies then definitely recommend trying place out   Open until pretty late when wasn't crowded  Nothing negative say service food pretty big portions  Decently priced being Vegas near strip personally thought food worth it   The Asian Nachos favorite since unique tasty  Great sharing friends  really big menu there's something everyone! <EOR> Dined 9 8 11 11 45 PM   decided order burger took well over 40 minutes them bring burger  bartender even noticed hubby waiting forever bar decided check it   When brought burger back upstairs suite burger charred side   asked burger medium well   well done charred   called manager room asked if could redo burger   When showed burger he said suppose way    WTF? Really when customer orders burger medium well suppose burned crunchy side???!!!  Yeah right!   brought new burger better medium well asked     One star inconveniencing once but three times long wait burger cooked order having trip back new burger    think dine again! <EOR> Food great  eat least once ever vegas trip usually 2 3 times never disappointed  crispy flautas chicken pasta w sun dried tomatoes mushrooms pasta carbonara pasta molino others loved them all  portions HUGE  perfect split your friend leftovers more munchies when you're drunk again 4 hrs later  if during lunch lunch sized portions which still big pastas few bucks cheaper    My only complaint service  Just never disappointed food never happy service  bread often comes food few pointed requests food always takes forever served waitresses rarely come check table refill drinks see we're doing  understand desire give wide berth when party group 12 drunkasses but even when gone 2 other girls completely sober composed middle afternoon  <EOR> Grand Lux Café Palazzo Las Vegas Strip NV 5 30pm Monday 5th August 2013 Five Stars  This Cheesecake Factory Las Vegas   menu intensive prices reasonable portion size huge   Sara Crispy Sesame Tofu Stir Fry $13 which gigantic very tasty except very sesame flavor it   Cobb Salad $15 which fresh delicious   Chicken plentiful shredded throughout moist   Cherry Tomatoes Avocado Hard boiled Egg all great   Overall place perfect spot inexpensive but tasty meal  <EOR> Very quick service breakfast two  Place open 24 hours very convenient if staying Venetian  Only reason why nicked star breakfast sandwich breakfast quesadilla extremely greasy  love grease don't  can't stand insanely greasy food both items very greasy  None less would come back try some other items menu  <EOR> First time wasn't bad little sister Cheesecake Factory   not likely return considering better choices food Cheesecake Factory but glad see place like  <EOR> Being close other Grand Lux Venetian surprised built too   But really ok it   favorite places eat Vegas   choices extensive quality food quite good   haven't bad meal yet   combination plates fabulous way much eat most meals   room Red Velvet Cake best desert ever  <EOR> Grand Lux ideal big groups since menu all over place   Everyone find something order no matter craving   Just its sister company Cheesecake Factory stick burgers sandwiches salads   wants order pizza Asian dish restaurant doesn't specialize those things?  Normally I'd give place 3 3 5 stars but Vegas locations 2 stars due thing portion sizes   big appetite can't even finish sandwich there   okay when you're home take food back home   But nobody Vegas taking leftovers back hotel room ton food and your money wasted  <EOR> Omg love place  Whether you're Palazzo Venetian Grand Lux Cafe safe bet open 24 hours reasonable prices food great! absolute favorite appetizer order baked potato spring rolls combining two best possible appetizers together  Crispy skin outside cheese potato inside lathered sour cream green onion  Simply delicious!  Tip If you're ordering to go cafe adjacent restaurant  order through them hostess restaurant won't take to go orders  Try phone in your order because wait pretty long  <EOR> You order beignets   they made fresh when order takes some time before actually it  usually order first then dessert  Yummy! <EOR> We almost 45 minutes 3 parties arrived received food  still waiting sliders salad  Really? When finally did come lukewarm  <EOR> My review specifically Grand Lux Cafe Palazzo   Venetian also Grand Lux but part review   My fiance great time Las Vegas until come facility lunch   come GLC Palazzo also because stay weekend wanted grab something eat nearby   served someone did give clear explanation ordered   fiance order orange juice non refillable $5 50!!  brunch menu she ordered reasonably price $10 hashbrown scrambled egg toast ham   However when thought suppose come sausage when asked waitress brought separate plate sausage     but did know additional side order cost $5 95!!  lunch came $41 two!!  may seem lot but consider ordered waffle strawberries $11 coffee $4 myself expensive lunch   never forget price glass orange juice champagne glass costed $5 50!!!  MENTION service slow absent times   I would recommend going GLC Venetian instead   least did service same price   Note gone GLC Venetian many times enjoyed food service facility  <EOR> If could only eat place Vegas    Grand Lux just might place! dined some very high end places trip all paled comparison GLC quality food choices service ambiance course pricing! best places eat strip where fill your stomach break your bank!  I ordered turkey club which quite possibly best ones ever life! side fries ordered sandwich avocado! delicious fresh hot!   My whole meal under $30 ordered sandwich avocado mimosa dozen chocolate chip pecan cookies go! deal anywhere let alone Vegas! Can't wait next trip dine again! just wish them California! <EOR> Why every girl's Vegas trips always end eating Grand Lux?! mean food just mediocre  There's absolutely nothing menu 'crave'  guess cheap convenient  surprise open 24hrs  open 6am closes 2 3am depending if weekend  Service usually pretty good guess  always plus  <EOR> This 4th time every time visit Vegas come enjoys delicious dishes  open very late great extensive menu atmosphere very nice great groups because very big booths  Shrimp scampi exceptional omg carrots delicious cooked perfection we'll every veggie cooked just right  Really recommend Royale chicken shrimp scampi  <EOR> Perhaps best dining experience 5+ visits Vegas   food amazing prices totally reasonable especially given massive portion size service GREAT   We ordered off Tapas menu since we're big eaters   ordered 4 tapas total $7 ea plenty food us   We came back dessert extremely pleased bar service   baked dessert ordered said would take 25 min ended taking 35 gave free  <EOR> Breakfast bar really works  Service bit slow but quality very good  Would rate higher if left coffee pot your table  Gotta keep eye server refill  ample breakfast buffet plus menu many options  Price point reasonable  GLC more attractive atmosphere Venetian  <EOR> My husband ate Grand Lux last morning Vegas send off before boarding plane    I thought would such great food due reviews and or menu selection    I admit should just gone breakfast buffet which quicker cheaper overall    I ordered eggs bacon just 'okay'  Nothing spectacular nothing write home about    Our waiter wasn't very hands on don't think he stopped once but drop check off    I think better options nearby hotels better food haul Bon Ami which amazing crepes  <EOR> Found eatery through Yelp glad decided try them out!   Loved ambiance place  somewhat dark but cozy very comfortable   just hate all indoor smoking Las Vegas!   Our waitress Victoria wonderful!   She attentive polite professional   Awesome service!    I Lemon Drop Martini which perfectly sweet just right amount alcohol     We ordered fried calamari which included shrimp some veggies   very generous serving accompanied 2 dipping sauces    batter thin nor thick   wasn't greasy very tasty     We also ordered cheese BBQ chicken pizza   didn't try but all gone need say more?  Hubby shared Beef Wellington   never dish anywhere used seeing prepared Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen when came medallions pastry puff sitting top little disappointed but still really delicious!   brussel sprouts eater but loved way prepared!  charred topped sweet glaze   Veggies mashed potatoes paired it     No room dessert but I'd love come back! <EOR> You know really want hate place because chain y mass produced damn many menu options all over board   But just can't hate it   fact kinda it   I've few times breakfast a la carte buffet always solid   omelets good French toast hash browns coffee toast everything   also recently stopped drinks their fancy drinks pretty good late dinner very pleased too   Dinner tougher because many different options   hard decide but pleased see large selection salads sandwiches appetizers smaller entrees well larger specialty entrees pastas   party six everyone's food looked great everyone seemed enjoy meal   chicken flatbread which well seasoned tasty HUGE   way much food person   also thrilled substituted tasty mashed sweet potatoes fries supposed come meal no additional charge   The service very good here   think very well trained execute well they're friendly   prices pretty reasonable especially amount food get   am pretty certain back since seems part normal Las Vegas repertoire  <EOR> Had dinner before Baz show which next door fast service  variety appetizers tasty more enough ceviche mini tacos mini calamari  Chicken royal excellent if you're hungry want something filling <EOR> The food great prices aren't shabby  portions huge think prices pretty fair  tried chicken picata chicken pasta w sun dried tomatoes Tahitian martini  chicken picata good even leftovers great next day same thing chicken pasta sun dried tomatoes great  martini tasty but enough alcohol personal taste  interestingly enough Grand Lux Cafe also created same people came Cheesecake Factory  <EOR> Quick service great food decent prices  spot when late night craving don't want dressed up! <EOR> I'm sad update review horrible one  recently Vegas came since to  Unfortunately horrible service every time came here  Since am loyal Grand Lux customer each time something bad happened decided give them another shot yet let down time time again  several problems service where server attentive multiple times mistakes food ordered most importantly dirty utensils  picked glass water whole glass completely sticky sat seat full salt utensils looked used  food came incorrectly couple times but when order over easy eggs please sure they're runny    eggs unfortunately completely hard  sad seeing place down drain  wasn't even during busy weekend visiting during middle week  Unfortunately completely sure if would come back during next Vegas visit  <EOR> For best pancakes ever tried your life lemon poppy seed pancakes  melt your mouth fluffy perfect balance sweet acidity lemon  breakfast omelettes quality Bloody Mary decent hotel cafe  serving staff incredibly nice portions huge  busy but wait shorter looks service fast  also priced according quality proportion  12 10 would recommend <EOR> My favorite place eat breakfast Vegas! freshly squeezed orange juice world! also breakfast buffet weekends  yet order anything wasn't great  little pricey but totally worth service amazing don't mind paying little more great service  <EOR> Good food great selection large portions open late! frequent Grand Lux Cafes every time stay Venetian Palazzo because easily accessible open 24 hrs! essentially go to spot when hungry can't figure where eat when group can't agree place   There rarely wait seated especially location but wait comes getting your meal  Service so so sometimes don't even bring bread your table while wait main course which hangry  None dishes memorable but always come restaurant full content  <EOR> We recently stayed Palazzo Grand Lux really close guestroom elevators   Needless say ate breakfast lunch dinner whole trip   They're also open 24 hours which very convenient late night munchies   Overall food very good reminiscent cheesecake factory Company Owners    But personally think Grand Lux much better Cheesecake factory   We tried most pastas some sandwiches asian specialties over rice   favorites **Pasta Telephono Creamy tomato sauce baked melted mozzarella breadcrumbs    delicious!  **Crispy Caramel Chicken Sweet crispy tangy little pieces fried chicken over rice    sorta orange chicken but much much better   *The Shaking Beef also very good similar flavor   **Seared Ahi Tuna salad very light refreshing good amount fish   **Spinach dip Creamy lots spinach artichoke heavy other spinach dips  **Short rib grilled cheese tender short rib different melted cheeses caramelized onions   Very filling     My least favorite meal ZEN NOODLES overpriced mediocre broth   thought would just Pho Ga chicken but way lemony rice noodles thick hard   small bowl $14 any hoisin sauce If really want pho would drive off strip chinatown down flamingo road    <EOR> Awful   brunch great  why gets 1 star   Lunch Dinner don't bother  <EOR> Ate multiple times while staying Palazzo  location convenient good variety well made food  Long hours overall decent prices compared similar food area    This isn't necessarily most creative place grab meal while Vegas  However when having extended stay convention only afford eat many trendy restaurants  Grand Lux staple diet during week  <EOR> My friend decided drink watching Jersey Boys   staff very accommodating when he requested booth even though area restaurant wasn't open   ordered wine ended getting vegetable flat bread some late night munchies   yummy   course end night can't order some cheesecake  <EOR> Grand Lux Cafe very cheesy name suffers Cheesecake Factory type menu    However suffer curse many options nothing most good     Grand Lux prevails sensational services group fact dined two locations during stay due positive experience both Palazzo Venetian  Both times received diligent personable service  Happy hour drink app specials worth visiting for  number cocktails $12 $5 during happy hour  Drinks stout  sampled menu items mega dinosaur sized salads fall off bone baby back ribs  Consistent tasty options doesn't suffer gratuitous inflated prices most restaurants hotels Vegas <EOR> The Grand Luxe Cafe great spot eat if you're looking eat fast food buffet Vegas  think place comparable Cheesecake Factory  prices bad all $10 $20 per entree  best part open 24 hours day which awesome because usually only McDonalds Denny's open 4 morning  would come again! <EOR> This Grand Lux Cafe Palazzo same twin restaurant Venetian hotel next door  equivalent Cheesecake Factory me    I ordered calamari appetizer good! batter very crunchy crispy  taste shrimp dried squid rings   The 3 way salmon ordered came mushrooms mash potatoes asparagus three different sauces it all delicious but mash potatoes okay   The indo China meal families favorite  brown rice marinated chicken Indonesian scent pineapple herby  comfort food  <EOR> Peach Bellini Cocktail absolutely delicious!

 good stuff! Although burgers w more flavor   definitely dunked into more sauce   Could better but patty winner  Servers runners all very nice helpful  <EOR> This start day grazing Las Vegas foodie tour guide  wanted some breakfast brunch everyone kept mentioning Bouchon  Unfortunately did clear if Bistro Bakery tried check both  familiar Venetian thinking own workers know where thing located asked several people  4 people asked only 1 gave correct directions  zigged zagged hotel until found elevator Bistro   I wanted light breakfast but prices Bouchon Bistro bit steep such meal  Then check Bouchon Bakery which offered pastries which quite tummy wanted  Then when all hope lost ready give just eat food court glowing red lights Grand Lux Cafe drew in   We just missed breakfast menu lunch it  ordered Lunch Soup Salad which consisted choice Cream Chicken Soup house salad  soup creamy large pieces chicken peas carrots more  also Chicken Pot Pit which looked lot Cream Chicken soup crust laid top  difference pot pie soup appears if grilled large pieces chicken found pie  <EOR> Great food great service  ended because made wrong turn  Glad see place  always eat other Grand Lux first time location  wife both volcano shrimp shared sliders   Everything top notch worth every penny  <EOR> Was good? quite positive    few free drinks decided order take back room    We Asian Nachos Crispy Fried Wontons Covered Chicken Sweet Hot Peanut Sauce rice center  Topped Wasabi Cream Melted Cheese   rice sure made Asian Nachos    surprisingly tasty     Fried Calamari Rock Shrimp Zucchini Onions  Served Dipping Sauces ok kinda fishy side    Food good nothing special   well those two wasn't but give them try again next time few other dishes  <EOR> As ate breakfast Grand Lux Cafe imagined if chef watching diners experience he she would screaming awww bloody hell @%#$ just Gordon Ramsay would doing Kitchen Nightmares shows    I can't cut them much slack because ordered very simple things themselves just fine but then ruined bloody awful execution service   start simplest things    usual morning party night beverage OJ Club Soda   Fresh squeezed OJ should awesome right?

Then asked if could use rice noodles Zen noodle dish butter cheese cream sauce kiddo she said could use Spaghettini Fettuchini instead  What?  trying order gluten free! needless say all french fries kiddo   Yeah   because she didn't know if anything menu gluten free nor could she tell if kitchen could anything gluten free except season less sauce less chicken breast   Sounds tasty  roll eyes Anyway when ordering food pointed Korean short rib tacos said would order Korean short rib tacos   bring Mexican chicken tacos   Um     Then takes them forever half right order despite the manager putting rush it  The manager never stopped say word us   Then trying leave finished all food we're flagging down takes 15 minutes done eating bring check   Then takes another 15 minutes come back take payment   basically 30 minutes lives wasted no apparent reason   Worst waitress ever   She reminded Phoebe Friends  P S  overheard taking order people behind us   asked sodas caffine free   She said um Coke Zero? also iced tea  Really?

I suggest Grand Lux Cafe large groups families looking delicious meal isn't expensive  many options chose everyone pleased  <EOR> I location palazzo because more options  tapas good  favorite dessert beignets which only palazzo one  Service good  Food delicious  <EOR> I sorry see Shaking Beef no longer appears dinner menu but nevertheless enjoyed very good substitute entree Salisbury Steak slathered really thick mushroom laden Brown Gravy topped high ridge tasty Mashed Potatoes   steak 8 inches long surrounded somewhat hard but fresh broccoli green beans sweet potatoes     But before dug into chopped sirloin reveled buttered slices Grand Lux's renowned complimentary sourdough bread enjoyed few Diane's addictive Pot Roast Cheese Fries length polished off large app Crispy Thai Shrimp Chicken Spring Rolls Mini Luxor Salad Garlic Croutons Blue Cheese Dressing   Spring Rolls filled thinly diced shrimp chicken tasted great joined few carrot slivers single mint leaf before being enveloped lettuce leaves then dipped very vibrant Thai Sweet Hot Chili Sauce   salad proved unnecessary but otherwise good small lettuce tomato based dish   Another night savoring fine comfort food grand establishment! <EOR> Awesome food here! highlight chain restaurant  beignets best around  They only served particular Grand Lux   solid choice if thinking along lines Cheesecake Factory  love here  <EOR> I've few times food consistently good large portions   It's sister restaurant Cheesecake Factory menu's similar   If want order beignet's sure someone share them order beyond large   thought maybe 3 would come plate   wrong   Eight giant bad boys come each order    myself almost slightly embarassed portion size!  It's huge restaurant while always looks packed never issue seating  <EOR> The breakfast buffet $25 terrible   fresh strawberries fresh sometime last week   eggs omelettes greasy    don't think wash coffee cups tea urns very carefully cups nasty smell when empty   If breakfast definitely order off menu   Much better food  <EOR> I visited cafe multiple times during Vegas trip  absolutely blown away morning breakfast items  Huvero Racheros chorizo omelette  indulgent line trip Vegas represents  flavor chorizo still mouth water thinking  it    Lunch other hand little less spectacular hence why knocked off star  indochine chicken shrimp less spicy expected eating both India China  However loved fact shrimp completely cleaned didn't tail pull off   house salad pasta telephono combo mixed bag  House salad top notch  pasta little more ordinary    So breakfast explore other places lunch dinner take away place  Nothing against lunch but breakfast set standards pretty high  <EOR> Considering most restaurants strip overpriced overhyped very pleased Grand Lux   I Max burger which HUGE   came generous helping fries side   couldn't finish all especially since lunchtime saving stomach dinner Bouchon http www yelp com biz bouchon las vegas#hrid IW8qqvB5DseBKXc1l1QKmw    burger loaded lettuce tomato cheese bacon shortrib meat   may sauce but knows   much flavor juice ohhhh yummm drooling little keyboard   Sorry vivid description but seriously burger   top off all 14 bucks!    My mom lettuce wraps which great well seasoned chicken veggies some light sauce   The only complaint really service pretty slow waiter didn't even bring bread until asked it   know really busy but come on!  Bread hard remember especially when every table some except us   Of course fact open 24 hours also great especially since pretty limited real dining 24 hours Vegas ironic right? <EOR> We Han breakfast twice  First time buffet  very disappointing  Just very few items which usually free many travel hotels    Second time ordered menu  Corned beef hash  very good! Unfortunately took waiter three attempts bring everything which belongs meal   Since little celebration ordered Bloody Mary  extremely watery  Never this  would order again    Somewhat disappointing price pay  <EOR> 5 stars staff   Packed throughout day during warmer months  Basically Cheesecake Factory shortened dining menu but extended drink menu wonder why   Breakfast Brunch service highlight morning options   You some showbiz locals still think Cheesecake Factory something miraculous  short term General Hospital actress gone internet soap acting little diva us  She clearly wanted attention however she prominently sat end aisle booth   in chair   Manager nice enough come when running something  but should probably prep servers line used every day dined there  <EOR> this 3rd time ive actually gone   twice breakfast but timme later meal   girlfriend arrived watching mystere treasure island   girlfriend buzzed dreaded waiting but thank god seated immediately   server super nice atmosphere super chill   order seared ahi she duck dumplings   food thoroughly good definitely going again   recommend spot people want eat nice meal vegas without hitting buffet! <EOR> Cheesecake Factory Grand Lux?  I'd hard time deciding but far Cheesecake Factory but Grand Lux close second   Thai chicken perfectly fried thin crispy batter topped some great tasting asian sauce but salty rice  Southwest salad wilted veggies but honey lime dressing very refreshing also lot textures beans tortilla avocado  Crab cakes better cheesecake factory case smaller but soggy  Ahi tuna cevice pretty plain would probably order again  Pasta chicken sun dried tomatoes mushroom bland   false advertisement literally 2 slivers sundried tomato would appreciate more since name dish   cheese well chips ahi tuna cevice though   Warm brownie sundae huge totally awesome would expect shareable 4 people's least  Service very nice  Definitely solid choice lunch dinner come back day middle night clubbing! <EOR> The waffles really good   Came twice weekend waffles but husband corn beef hash meat kinda gross  much fat just chewy  He did enjoy it  Service really good giving 4 stars  <EOR> Good food just takes forever orders  Expect 30 40 minutes your order  No ideal 30 minute lunch  Even when call ahead  <EOR> Much nicer layout Venetian busy  best pot pie ever entire life only most tasty but also gigantic enough 2 people! bread nice fresh warm burger huge  potato spring rolls world!!!
