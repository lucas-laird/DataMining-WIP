WTF?!?!? owner also he could care less if customers treated poorly didn't bother care even server commented mistake     Dining should enjoyment   All while food amazing but being treated way did unforgivable   rather elsewhere town future avoid negative experience   much would give them second chance find hard justify case  <EOR> I came many times  I always satisfied here   specially lunch combo best price  you should try it!!!!!!!! <EOR> The food delicious restaurant! always tofu soup kalbi  would also recommend seafood pancake people haven't tried Korean food  customer service excellent well  waitresses give lot side dishes attentive!! <EOR> Terrible service!
