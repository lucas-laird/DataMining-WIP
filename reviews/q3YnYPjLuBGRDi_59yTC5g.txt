Great staff nice size portions  I'm obsessed!!! <EOR> Used goto place but anymore   use restroom took away half eaten food completely full drink   sit empty table awkwardly bill shoved face   rude!  Seems service downhill gone few mins food straight trash   waste!  My 5 stars 1 quickly <EOR> I am Nor Cal  Which means course living Vegas constantly fruitless hunt good pho  PLACE RIVALS SF VALLEY! GOOD! AMAZING SERVICE   which rare Asian restaurant   very Authentic tase! <EOR> First glance quaint little place center busy city never sleeps  atmosphere very traditional but mixed modern elements  owners very nice but accents pretty thick  service great highly attentive tables  food prepared within 5 minutes looked delicious it tasted even better  good ordered more food go! <EOR> Came try Vietnamese food because looked good  friend ordered pho dac Biet small bowl spring rolls  spring rolls fine but pho lacked flavor  average taste  think next time if come would try rice dishes cause looked better noodles here  don't think specialty would noodle dishes  inside clean nice though  just think pho average  <EOR> Average pho    But +1 star nicest group servers manager owner ? !  We craving pho hot savory soup chilly night  No pho restaurants open till late except said closes 32 minutes !!!  So called them advance order but said just come table ready  sat ordered starting clean close  But continued check made feel comfortable! We obviously last customers probably took off 30+ min original closing time    Other such friendly service taste average  all ordered Your Own Pho which gives 6 different types meat choose from  believe choose 3 ?   ordered small    BIG MISTAKE! Portions actually really small haha regretted ordering large The restaurant spacious clean  Definitely satisfied appetite but really should ordered large! Expect A+ service <EOR> Craving Vietnamese food but willing drive Chinatown favorite place  back Vietnamese joint near home   Ordered kids chicken fried rice which enough feed two kids  A+ portion but kids didn't like  could chicken vs Chinese sausage pork fried rice   *Maybe kid option well   Ordered kids pho meatballs perfect   I ordered Bun Rieu soup flavor delicious   Although protein real shrimps instead crab shrimp clusters odd since used having ground crab shrimp none there  Plenty tofus tomatoes if you're into  would order again   My daughter ordered Pho Dac Biet which always favorite never disappoint   I'll stick usual Bun Thit Noung Pho Tai next time avoid Bun Rieu   fried rice just order regular Chinese sausage fried rice take rest leftovers  <EOR> Good food  Good prices  Good service  Easy parking  Boba next door  Happy descent Vietnamese restaurant near Summerlin  <EOR> I'm convinced best non pho Vietnamese restaurant Las Vegas  probably eat least once week if more  Why much biased? Because scale value taste satiate nearly perfect  co workers orders eat Shabbat minus pork kosher element  disappointed any items minus except Pho Dac Biet  may think  major knock but when consider Pho Rib Eye  dish comes ready cook separate fondue pot probably best value dish entire menu  Ok enough writing time eat it!! <EOR> Came few friends try new pho restaurant area  Inside really nice surprised looked    Service okay which didn't really understand since bit slow customers  waiter helping table nice but didn't really check us    Food good ordered  your own pho kudos that  Spring rolls fried rolls point which good  vermicelli also good wish more meat food items it    Overall would recommend place others only reason stars service  <EOR> This place very good   Unfortunately little before closing run numerous dishes   However would back  <EOR> Stopped 1st time afternoon try Sidestreet Pho Grill  Let start saying place Phenomenal!

<EOR> Excellent pho  staff super friendly waiter gave box shrimp chips since liked much   There plenty tables available  Accessible parking restaurant very clean  I'm glad found spot  food outstanding returning tot restaurant  <EOR> I came originally wanting some Pho but wanted try something different change! ordered Vermicelli Bowl B12 which egg rolls peanuts noodles pork carrots green onions shrimp  liked because some favorite things all   Egg Rolls Shrimp pork! around $10 95 filling but think need serve side spicy sauce give plate more flavor  thought worth getting happy choice  remember some guy passing saying looked good but mouth full food all could smile nod    I also some spring rolls start side peanut sauce because another favorite things order  friend never Vietnamese food she stayed safe choice ordered Won Ton soup $6 95   thought she would better off Pho since specialize in  Won Ton soup favorite   prices decent portions generous! cozy place customer service welcoming! <EOR> I love restaurant kids several times soup vermicelli noodles great   recommend those likes noodles grill foods  <EOR> Food really good annoyed waiting pho kim long then found place close house its very good staff nice too  <EOR> Good food vegan friendly consistent staff ok very friendly last few times gone <EOR> Great Viet place actually tastes good close home  Viet Bistro much closer but disappointing  warnly greeted owners Ken promptly took drink order made recomendations  Ice Tea no sugar hot tea house   For appetizer shared Shredded Pork Skin Spring Rolls   small combo pho $8 50   Broth very falvorful natural no MSG could detect   did tell Ken other favorite Viet place Pho Saigon 8 small portion little more noodles which would probably cost them less quarter but increase perceived value  Wife Pork Chop Egg Loaf Rice  Beautifully presented tasty  friend ordered spicy thick noodle broth forget name    Definitely back support place! <EOR> it ok     i few days ago frankly nothing stuck pho  Ill eat again because a love Pho b its getting cooler outside c location convenient  But wish could write more them  Needs some flair  <EOR> I came once take noodles egg rolls vegetables kinda salad I forgot called but good figured I'd come back try pho    Their service really good  water cup never empty food came quick  also very friendly  only few Vietnamese restaurants where employees actually polite place happens them    Their pho combination pho $10 50 large believe  worth it  They're stingy ALL meat  broth delicious back!

<EOR> I think might just found new favorite pho place! boo came Thursday night fulfill pho craving  seated immediately place smelled amazing    When came down chicken pho which AMAZING! broth super flavorful even before adding all fixings  also plenty noodles chicken involved definitely skimping any ingredients  small size more enough super reasonably priced    So glad found place located close home! pho king great find! <EOR> I don know almost 5* but when eat pho tasted off  Like broth old   nice inside all but pho did impress me  <EOR> Very average pho place but there's much choice if don't want drive all way Chinatown  should add SoCal SGV share great pho  first time came soup tasted extremely weird squeeze lots lime juices mask weirdness  can't really describe because didn't even taste pho  Came second time because wanted give another chance really wanted place because closest pho get  pho tasted normal time but found piece hair soup  didn't even bother telling them anymore since if hair communal soup begin wouldn't difference if gave new soup  Also both times meat slices rainbow appearance old oily taste  waitress both times wasn't very nice either  RBF myself usually very sympathetic but she really impatient even though didn't take long order anything really  Lesson learned back  <EOR> Excellent!!!
