Totally worth it! <EOR> I love Mix! lived Las Vegas 3+ years now  Any time friends town always first stops  view absolutely amazing! Its most amazing views strip anywhere Vegas  little outdoor area look over strip  Occasionally its closed during colder windy winters   The drinks little pricey but considering surroundings location its expected    Oh last thing sure use restrooms there! LOL  most scenic restroom experiences your life! <EOR> We excited going Mix because heard great things it     First off host rather unfriendly he guided table   waitress seemed busy give attention although did see chatting other staff members   When tried order sampler dish she told wife BOTH order dish else couldn't it   Later friends told able order sampler dish without problem   I ordered sea bass wife ordered halibut   38 48 dollars respectively both fish slightly overcooked although flavors okay   big eaters but filets small weren't many vegetables we order additional side asparagus even dessert almost 200 dollars later still hungry meh dishes   When done waitress walked dropped check table before asked it   Only she inspected generous tip still left did she look say thank you     The quality dishes par buffet Bellagio   would more happy pay food  made attention flavor served politeness   However experience Mix again  <EOR> Came quality meal   Pros Food tasty amd food runner describing every item arrived kept water full  server made sure champagne full well  View epic  Drinks came quickly  Tje place pretty cool looking also   Cons We waited host desk 2 3 minutes while people looked but no helped us  restaurant completely empty  finally table outside wonderful  second downside server less communicative  He didn't seem he wanted acted very monotone  literal service good personality bit downer   We try elsewhere next time  ton restaurants LV  <EOR> AMAZING   The view absolutely gorgeous 4 star stellar review really view more any other part  friends dropped Mix experiencing Ice Bar located Mandalay Bay  When already close 1am close 2am  Which would fine but wanted charge cover going in Thankfully some girls group negotiated but really bit ridiculous charge cover 1am when close 2  star off that   The drinks expensive remember being high even vegas  outdoor area without bottle service TINY  tons people  We stayed 30 minutes but view seriously worth visit  Especially if away paying cover  <EOR> The food ok but portion sizes small average cost entree $50  view pretty worth going having look  think next time eat somewhere delicious just come bar lounge  <EOR> I'm little torn place    does boil your thoughts place down 1 5 stars?  found most memorable things place drive stars if great even if overall place wasn't superb     In case MIX stars might driven higher 3 gave if followed method    because dramatic ceiling installation see pictures 5***** appetizers amazing!  But main courses underwhelming all around table service lackluster   Add all then remember outrageous prices 4 5 star review quickly gets knocked down 3     First good    The installation decor whole    well much more say made impression   But even decor felt all white mother of pearl layout lazy drama ceiling especially when underachieved taking advantage spectacular view strip could have   But decor decor     The food    Like said apps top notch   foie gras sashimi apps amazing others   However main courses took nose dive   Maybe because around 10 11pm last seatings end night    but Vegas?!  Where midnight 3pm   Plus charge better blow mind  didn't    Disappointing  <EOR> Food 4 5 5 Decor 5 5 actually 6 Service 4 5 Wine 3 5  very over priced wine list overall 5 5  I strongly recommend reserve seats window    absolutely gorgeous view atmosphere   Great food service everything over average top   strongly recommend special occasion such anniversary valentines birthday dinner couple   romantic family dinner =     awesome restaurant   Strongly recommended  <EOR> AMAZING!!! loved everything restaurant food service views! sat outdoor patio dinner perfect! <EOR> Yes cannot review   But $10 two ginger ales?!?!?!?!  kidding me   Even club little ridiculous   wouldn't minded if waitress disappeared until check came when she hovered over us  <EOR> Husband Mix first night Vegas  restaurant looked nice very open  waiter Randy very pleasant  started potato gnocchi mushrooms appetizer   omg good!! Highly recommend this  lot people mention bread baskets reviews just bread  But mix give three different types all very good ate whole basket  entree Roasted free range chicken husband pepper crusted filet mignon mash potatoes asparagus  Yes ordered chicken  But hey chicken when made perfection Mix managed do   it's fabulous  husband liked steak but said he's better steak all over Vegas   He loved asparagus potatoes did I  Bottom line place great food  <EOR> Visited Mix high expectations more met!  dining room beautiful elegant yet also simple   staff well versed menu attentive without constant stream everything often passed off good service   night view Las Vegas 64th floor amazing   Yet real star food   Each item table  perfect   while certainly cheap dining stacks very nicely more expensive options area   I definitely revisit future trips  <EOR> I invited some colleagues during work retreat treated extravagant place over the top prices food  many areas MIX ran gamut styles  First all entrance MIX just hallway outdoor elevator shot top hotel way hot!   Once lounge bar area which club like very loud  Vegas yes yes  apparently back past kitchen moved very dark very loud setting white bubbly restaurant area  Talk modernized fancy schmancy even bread came square pats creamy butter sweet peanut butter  way pimento bread very excellent good its own without any spread    So trying little comfortable unfamiliar setting swanky restaurant and staring price tags food decided since already situation ought take full advantage it  mean when else am going place myself high priced menu? Therefore else order but chef's signature dishes filet mignon rossini? came seared foie gras sliced black truffles  Oh believe also side mashed potatoes too  When came honestly weren't presented way made mouth water actually waiter set plate down front incorrectly insignia turned properly   However tenderness steak certainly played its part charming me  best though? No but seared foie gras really helped pull flavors together  Let's forget truffle! mashed potatoes also both fluffy still chunky enough please palate  Now whole entree worth $69? I'd say not  delicious juicy? Yes sure was   I couldn't resist getting dessert such wonderful descriptions listed menu turn blind eye price tag Minerva!   ended hazelnut souffle paired grapefruit sorbet  Uh pairs two together? hoping I'd them some kind complex mix but alas presented separately plate  hazelnut souffle much sugar some parts unnecessarily cavity inducing crunchy  really enjoyed sorbet but felt odd include bits sugar bowl  candied grapefruit peel delicious but again sweet  glad experience but once again proven correct thought cost high profile appearance place does say anything food  all diner diner only somewhat satisfied night  <EOR> We stayed TheHotel naturally upstairs Mix    The view absolutely breath taking night   Our server extremely kind even busy night  Cocktails delicious made even hand  packed punch but delightful    It great place begin your night  <EOR> Came back early February group close college friends regret doing thankfully meal comped b c would've hated pay unsatisfying night       We only chose because Michelin star always wanted try Michelin starred restaurant   But no clue one   Food Appetizers ordered several different ones thought all amazing Entrees most ordered $75 filet + fois gras + truffle special   filet absolutely no flavor   see large slice fois gras truffle top but neither distinct taste flavor would expect such ingredients   those ingredients disappointing flavorless  Sides couple orders mac cheese veggies all good Dessert Decent  Service annoying   don't know if just assumed group guys meant bachelor party something but weren't college kids spring break anything   He kept interrupting talking he frat brother supercocky condescending voice he player talking woman woman yada yada yada   Waiter just total douche   If want eat somewhere nice Mandalay Bay I'd Fleur de Lys  <EOR> Great atmosphere   wife getting married town   very accommodating giving very romantic table   food perfect expected   Overall very memorable experience  <EOR> My husband Mix Monday night anniversary dinner  First impression restaurant lounge whole pretty dead but probably expected Monday night 9 30  actually enjoyed atmosphere since anniversary  very attentive service during dinner romantic feel lounge even though house music blasting   area itself large open beautiful cannot help but notice spectacular views strip  Absolutely stunning worth trip even just drink    As meal both agree best Vegas  husband ordered Chef's menu other  both wine parings  cheap ticket but several shining stars menu  also few misses one wine WAY sweet more sip could done without port end but overall meal winner  worth hefty price tag? every trip Vegas but since anniversary and husband lucky roulette table worth it  definitely return lounge future  could pass dance floor floor ceiling windows overlooking strip? <EOR> WOW WOW WOW view!  place gorgeous!  friend early no line no music no cover appetizers fantastic of course they're overpriced but expect Hotel? martini's!

Highly recommend Cod! <EOR> Came enjoy lounge drinks view impromptu anniversary getaway    The view awesome  5 stars  Very few places Vegas give all encompassing view the only thing screws bit City Center blocking Bellagio    The drinks expensive but tasty  came company view ambience drinks  said drinks tasty but both wife cheap buy more 1 each which felt would minimum     The scene came Tuesday evening knowing would empty quiet which wanted we're getting old! believe enhanced view experience    I imagine place getting really dense tight crowded weekend I would probably stay away   But if we're Vegas mid week would probably come again  <EOR> If view hype alone 5 stars   However c note per person average expense food service left much desired   I am quick judge upscale restaurant simple rule offer dark light napkin depending upon your attire?  wearing black dress   Everything white MIX   No offer black napkin   Okay little hang but usually deal breaker   We seated lovely corner seat but before ordered wine hostess seated another party directly next the tables tight moved seat anyone when say 'next to' mean literally 'on top of'    If busy night would fine but only handful tables occupied   fact close when palate cleanser came waitress made joke served both table unexpected dinner partners' together if same party   The servers nice but plate taken before done meal water spots flatware pointed seriously explained why weren't dirty just chemical reaction but is a new spoon anyway even though you didn't ask   knew flatware TMI?  The food decent   highlight phenomenal bottle wine very extensive wine list ravioli appetizer world   entrees?  bad but nothing write home about   We MIX romantic Vegas evening   definitely Vegas but Vegas 'pot bellied balding Elvis impersonator' sort way   wouldn't complain if only Elvis sighting but know doesn't live around every other corner   But view spectacular  <EOR> I mix last week birthday love place mandaly bay great  Location top vegas great view really enjoyed dinner  Recommend everyone <EOR> I really wanted place   high expectations reading some yelp reviews   However left bit disappointed unsatisfied   beautiful restaurant ultra chic decor   winding staircase hanging glass balls nice touch   originally wanted give 3 but more think more want give lower review     First all BF seated opposite end where wanted sit the side facing strip    bread two kinds butter   Regular peanut butter butter   didn't really peanut butter butter very much   bread difficult cut   when give bread  already cut all tear off bread bowl   Especially when you're sharing group people   wants eat someone grabs hands cuts up    I wasn't very hungry decided prixe fixe meal instead decided 2 appetizers salad entree   foie gras tuna tartare start   good but definitely better    $20 appetizer salad light refreshing but still left unsatisfied   BF lobster rice must say delicious   $50 better be!    The wine opted share bottle Pinot Grigio   wine guy likely master sommelier barely said word   BF tried wine he approved said would try it? guy starts pouring full glass   guess getting bottle whether not     The service Umm service great   Just mediocre   waiter nice took some pics but host friendly   restaurant com gift certificate but didn't print asked if could still use it   email format BF pulled phone   first said fine later French host dude attitude came back said sorry mistake someone else   But said would something complimentary chef   excited yay! free stuff   brought drink martini glass   French dude said non alcoholic because sure if you're 21  don't know whether he trying funny because clearly drinking wine all night already still sipping last glass when he came   decided try it   good   Then looked over other tables saw people same thing   could may very well ordered that   chef just giving those away everybody night     Overall food pretty good but price also expect stellar service   restaurant did meet expectations  <EOR> In word Phenomenal!

Our server Randy superb!  He very knowledgeable menu charisma definitely added evening   service even brought fresh madeleines decorated special occasion   Bottom line definitely visiting establishment again sure venture also into lounge area next time  <EOR> I'm sure girlfriends decided upon 'Fix' but staying Mandalay Bay wanted nice trendy restaurant  BAD BAD DECISION!!    Well sure trendy completely white interior all white plush booths but nothing nice service   started off fairly well made reservations seated almost immediately     I ordered sea scallops remember only four   Eh unexpected decided take sweet time them   If paying $30+ four scallops going relish every bite!  Well only finished two them when plate whisked away me    Just scooped away fork hand looking disbelief direction guy took it  Uh hello? He didn't even ask if finished   Something should never happen least 'nicer' place such this   Fine  Whatever let slip bc don't making scene   But wasn't end it   Sometime during meal pre scallop taking incident waiter came set down bowl Mac Cheese said complimentary   received bill noticed $20 Mac Cheese charge   despite protests rest friends let called waiter over asked complimentary Mac Cheese   Instead saying sorry below said Waiter smirking Did enjoy it?

Always favorite place chill let things settle couple hours nice supper before heading club  view down strip 64th floor sun sets fantastic  Can't comment food but bottle prices aren't ridiculous compared some Vegas clubs   <EOR> Save your $$ find another restaurant because only paying lovely view   $36 salmon which overcooked dry mush surrounded florescent green runny liquid   Very unappetizing   Limited menu mostly meat eaters way overpriced under construction inside very disappointing  <EOR> I wanted pre KA dinner great view great food googled romantic restaurants w view place kept comin search decided reservations   Its 64th floor Id say panoramic view Las Vegas AMAZING luckily seated outside which made more experience but unfortunately view only thing restaurant offers thats why give two stars   For appetizer server recommended Tender Potato Gnocchi very good wanted try Corn Chowder Cappuccino eh also starters gave basket bread all which hard  entrees ordered  Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin Roasted Chicken w side Creamed Spinach  chicken creamed spinach tasted somethin could home Bison alright nothing spectacular   That night wedding dinner reception all servers' attention focused them hey thats fine guys married! but please also think other patrons establishment  three couples around weve overheard complaining length time service   We spent close $200 dinner bein high maintenenace foodwhore husband is money isnt issue but weve spent less spent more $200 other fine dining restaurants without view where food top notch service impeccable    Even if meal free would eat again   But then again its just opinion   <EOR> Incredible view delicious food  Expensive but very reasonable if use restaurant com certificate  Sides large enough 2 only order 1 unless you're VERY hungry  Enjoy view amazing food! <EOR> The space itself gorgeous   perfect spot wedding anniversary   food amazing   did order chocolate souffle but yourself favor order it   would happily whole meal!

I liked Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin = <EOR> I didn't know expect coming mix  figured staying hotel why come dinner well  all b day weekend  Made reservations concierge earlier day lobby    We arrived around 7 so  Took elevator up  decor really nice  All white glass ornaments hanging throughout ceiling  seated right away  Ordered few drinks date  waiter took pretty good care us  top things most part  date ordered some chicken veggies dish  ordered filet mignon  Also side Mac cheese  filet gotta tell excellent  highly recommend it  dates chicken ok  Nothing spectacular but good  Mac cheese good  But mean fancy u it   In middle meal waiter brought some complimentary champaign  Which surprised me  Later he told concierge made reservation with  Earlier day  Which really surprising  Considering didn't even tip guy  No desert  But meal just really good  kick myself end meal because didn't even bother taking strip view everyone dearly talks about  Prices exactly should be  Pricey but well worth it  most likely trip again  FYI back June 2k10  <EOR> The view in outside bathroom really amazing couldn't agree everybody more   Apart pretty par even below  Decor quite pathetic strive unless infra red glasses simply dark DJ absolutely sucked ass   The crowd you'd expect desperate wannabees nothing say themselves only interested posing  Everybody works thinks bee's knee but service least professional quick drinks quite good   So extra dirty Grey Goose martini vertigo inducing pee gazing lights I'd definitely recommend place  Just don't waste your money if night cover  <EOR> I really love Mix    It's definitely favorite spots Vegas right now  bar lounge area few times but finally actually sit down dine here    The bf completely blown away delicious food is  Usually really ritzy restaurants food little disappointing inadequate price  think portions fair  cheesecake factory portions but just enough fill up!   My only complaint reason put 4 stars instead 5 because seating  Even though window seat tight felt sitting other table's lap  uncomfortable both parties because no privacy just way close comfort  reservations restaurant pretty empty no idea why sat location    I highly recommend Mix special occasion if you're trying impress your date! <EOR> 64 floors great views food cocktails definitely try twice love it <EOR> As many stated already best views Vegas strip    especially since theHotel already very southern end it    My group came around 1am Saturday morning  even ready pay cover since  read website $10 theHotel guests but ended charging anything  guess wasn't extremely busy just looking more people  really sure much drinks but probably typical Vegas prices  Also didn't try any food might have  time loud music playing most people dancing but all club  sure other times but if you're coming you're definitely coming view chill vibe  <EOR> I think everyone should come view  outdoor patio Mix great birds eye view Strip  best time come if earlier evening when its crowded enjoy 1 2 cocktails  heard weekends charge cover in   The bathrooms rather cool surrounded glass while your still enjoy view   Love glass elevators take come up <EOR> This restaurant ultra posh + chic  came pre dinner drinks + dinner    3 stars restaurant 4 stars lounge  {ORDER} * King prawns appetizer * Filet mignon rossi foie gras * Mac + cheese  {DON'T ORDER} * Any fish certainly did taste fresh  Let's just say couple bites done   {ENVIRONMENT} * Love sexy appeal place  feel Miami  love glass bubbles drop down ceiling   * If chance outside patio view strip amazeballs   {SERVICE} Nothing ordinary   {TIP} Come early enough happy hour check website hours order drinks bar before sit down dinner   {OVERALL} I think cool place hang drinks but dining restaurant say somewhere else tons options vegas!   <EOR> Wow   super torn one  3 4 stars?

Then he only recommended tasting menu $120 per person without even mentioning la carte options  Apart two interactions waiter did come see any time    2  Being familiar French gastronomic restaurants famous chefs like Joel Robuchon dying see Ducasse store Mix  serious lack innovation originality noticed  husband ate cod not memorable lobster curry  dish cost around $50 swear when arrived literally looked just thrown onto plate no considerations aesthetics dish  Curry splashed all over mush overcooked rice just nothing excites eyes  While lobster abundant dish tasted curry dish would taken regular Thai restaurant which would cost $10   just glad didn't try anything else  those two dishes supposed top items display Ducasse's genius abilities      Overall might best Ducasse take name restaurant  husband huge foodies tried top restaurants every city visited but definitely place would come back! <EOR> This favorite places eat Las Vegas because view  view amazing any table food pretty good well although nothing stood spectacular dish  favorite taking elevator panoramic view vegas during elevator ride  10 dollar cab ride hotels main strip bellagio venetian mirage etc but well worth if plan well  sure tell them if time limit because food took forever come caused delay rest evening   PS  crab salad  amazing  <EOR> Yes pricey plenty 'tude around  But mentioned numerous times great views night must've '80s dance hits night cuz rocking Paula Abdul videos  Fun  <EOR> Slightly let down Mix    Vegas always food latest trip decided try Mix before night out  three including vegetarian  chose Mix because never before heard food views stunning  also knew Michelin star restaurant   The ambiance dcor quintessential new Vegas over top elegant mention view 64th floor  loved glass fixtures hanging ceiling   The server good  He way recommend special dish wasn't menu he eats vegetarian friend  He wasn't perfect though  beginning service he asked if preferred still sparkling water  always thought still mean tap   apparently wrong  brought VOSS water kept refilling glasses without asking  ended being charged 30 dollars water  Fine   Dinner great but nothing would run back for  specialty pork chop wife venison  Again both great but worth second trip  <EOR> WOW!   Everything restaurant 5 stars    First fortunate enough table patio outside overlooking strip   absolutely best view town   Even if can't dinner least drink bar    Our service very good all wait staff very polite formal which really appreciate when you're going nice meal    Dinner incredible  tuna tartar halibut most incredible desserts Ive ever had   forget name but pistachio vanilla ice cream crunchy meringue shell pistachios raspberry sauce    Such great experience! Recommend wholeheartedly! <EOR> Came dinner lounge portion but if want beautiful panoramas city highly suggest start here  But careful seem pretty snotty outdoor seating even when place empty  Call ahead   As dinner restaurant beautiful  walk instant visual stimulation  incredible  decor lights city all around really just place draws in    There few thins happened could avoided would four star experience  first incident being seated cozy little nook where conversation could without being close next person feel you're sharing family secrets  didn't last long  hostess immediately bare empty no one restaurant seats people right next date  Hello? beyond rude  mean tables close together really uncomfortable  use bathroom literally wedge myself between table next us  Awkward  Also waiter when asked favorite Belgian beer tried tell only carried type  insist he ask someone because he wrong for record Chimay comes blue white red     Other those two missteps everything okay  service quick flawless  time between waiter visits perfect  ask water just time couldn't take sip without being refilled  great job picking that  also greeted several people way which thought very nice touch   Onto dinner  appetizers dinner salad which essentially larger average bowl mixed greens  mixed vinaigrette some sort just added bitter taste overall salad  wouldn't recommend  date spicy crab salad which delicious but absolutely could come mom's kitchen  say mom's great cook!   For entree 12 oz  boneless ribeye  cooked perfectly but much large eat brought extra home  delicious  did happen more fatty cut used excessively so  fine but prefer less fat more beef obviously  sides chose fork crushed potatoes  chunky rich but again could come mom's kitchen    My date pepper crusted bison tenderloin seemed enjoy it  dislike much pepper anywhere near but looked delicious  side sauteed spinach which he found delicious    For dessert passed but friend ice cream toppings  four choices he chose pistachio ice cream salted caramel ice cream vanilla ice cream coconut crunch topping  pistachio creamy rich loved it  could done without coconut but really wasn't distraction  disliked INTENSELY salted caramel  tasted very bland very unlike any salted caramel ever tasted  almost think  taste belongs solely candy form  just don't think translates well other things which isn't fault restaurant just never found works much else but candy  vanilla well vanilla    All all decor charm service perfection  food enjoyable although didn't Michelin star experience don't think  food really good view just beautiful  all restaurants Vegas though doubt revisit  But try once! <EOR> After dinner Mix walked over Mix Lounge  pretty worn dinner but enjoyed it  music wasn't very packed happy find place sit  favorite view    city las vegas looks fantastic all lights glowing! <EOR> Amazing views good people watching   Though early   there no cover before 10PM most seating taken hipsters reserve most bar  <EOR> WOW  Just walking into restaurant now you're amazing dining experience!  decor absolutely jaw droppingly breathtaking  Every detail intricately decided creates beautiful white wonderland dine in   If table outside view even amazing   Hotel situated different angle strip brand new perspective Vegas strip which breathtaking   Additionally FOOD ORGASMIC!  Every flavor every taste every bite squeal food bliss   flavors textures just right     I ordered Sea Bass mashed potatoes   Even mashed potatoes divine!  Definitely worth trip if want check off great view great ambience great service AMAZING food <EOR> Mix Lounge attached restaurant while waiting table drinks then dinner ended staying here  Just restaurant view breathtaking 64 floors   loved fact tables outside enjoy fresh air view  All tables open everyone until 10PM or something that then some them closed off table service   However still ample seating which total plus me  bathroom another crazy feature  liked fact stalls glass wall outside! your doing your business top world or least  feels like   hahaha thing didn't very close men's bathroom if you're careful and especially if you're drunk walk into wrong no doors bathrooms   Some guy looking into women's bathroom while friend walked in    The music okay  drinks decent but bartender very quick help didn't wait long    It fun but hoping all would've gone somewhere else while  However good drinks before dinner can't complain  <EOR> I would definitely back cocktails which all recent trip   view great particularly if sit outside comfortable deck  roof high windows combined heat lamps very comfortable area cool nights   So why less super enthusiastic review? waitress pill  only 5 30 Saturday when arrived place pretty chill which private party occupying most staff's attention  Four deck being informed bartender open seating some confusion signs such   sat while no coming seeing couple walk drinks bar assumed order them ourselves  Okay kinda ghetto but whatever  Well 5 minutes later waitress shows informs happy hour special 1 2 off good selection cocktails score!   But when told friends already bar ordering face soured she clearly thought Great no tip  Thanks assholes  But dude fault took 10 minutes any attention table 4 almost empty lounge!  Worse yet bartender did inform friends happy hour special spent $60 slightly different variations 1 2 off drink specials  Sweet   So come enjoy view hope service better peak hours  <EOR> on posivite side restaurant awesome view magnificient  Now lets talk bar     Its old needs renovation sit under huge strawberry service loisy drinks very weak     3 martinis $15  each didnt feel thing   no buzz nothing drink none 3 tasted same     THere dance floor very lound music but noone dance dancing   Saturday nite 11pm hardly anyone best kept secret people felt did rip off  view all have!   its perfect location lounge relaxing music views    rid want club  plenty popular clubs hotel just offer great romantic place people hang those dont want noise dancing just great music drinks hang out     Get rid  huge red strawberry why dont fantastic decor restaurant ??!! <EOR> Wow! place quite few  easiest place find don't suggest wearing 6 heels unless really walk days them  But food great salad steak fries  Cooked perfection!

Ps  lounge next door offers champagne bottle service patio great place enjoy night views Las Vegas while sipping champagne very romantic relaxing  <EOR> My personal experience wasn't great   Fankly think restaurant white   Also boyfriend 6'3 hard time chair being little small side   As far food halibut pretty bland despite waiter recommending over barramundi   claim barramundi very plain sauce little flavor   If  case could probably serve water more flavor   Another guest party ordered crawfish appetizer   Despite warning she didn't believe when said might come heads attached   Well 1 3 correct      only three came face   A couple other people ordered buffalo steak great   all items ordered only no complaints   At end night two people eating sick stomachs and no weren't drinking    free admission into lounge dinner   All all Mix place worth visiting  <EOR> As stunningly beautiful eating Mix kind eating airport terminal shopping mall  high ceilings glass granite surfaces create echo effect every sound reverberates off walls floors just unsettling dining experience   Acoustics aside food pretty decent although quite impressive hoped  best dish evening Spicy Crab Salad  Elegantly presented bed guacamole topped shredded heart palm lively fresh made feel resort Cabo  Cod Brandade acceptable but expecting exceptional  lemon capers just weren't enough brighten bland brown butter sauce soggy fried parsley  Duck Breast forgettable simply forgot it   We very impressed however wine service  didn't want order bottle just asked somm pair dishes us  He seemed enjoy challenge delight talk to   One last note realize isn't much restaurant but people really should bring young children kinds places  inappropriate inconsiderate your fellow diners  especially Mix because sound your rug rats squealing shouting gets amplified throughout entire restaurant  <EOR> For experience club food drink 5 star    I hosted party 25 club early evening 6 8pm  Best early before

knowledgeable guy behind bar  Food came very reasonable pace no hungry    Second food amazing  Highlights included black sesame tenderloin beef mini skewer Ducasse's stunning shrimp cocktail horseradish panna cotta  Really delightful flavorful perfectly executed  Nothing old wilty less perfect    Third amazing pricing  2 grand food liquor views 25 people  Couldn't better if cooked stuff myself rented suite    The secret pick earlier hour before disco dollies even left pool kind all service people meet there  Attitude begets attitude believe workers see lot Vegas  Hopefully club kids all flock off Palms some other MTV like horror leave place alone    Some best food service seen Vegas view can't matched  Highly recommended  <EOR> This upscale french restaurant top floor Mandalay Bay's The Hotel   attentive servers eager please    The potato gnocchi mushrooms tasty earthy smokey flavor it  very unique dish  scallops topped american caviar entree  I'd say scallops taste scallops but caviar added hint aroma taste sea  ribeye well prepared  cooked even all throughout done ness done accurately  good sear crusty char exterior which like  tender prime steak should be   For dessert nothing unique  ice cream profiteroles options different types sauce topped things off nicely  <EOR> The first experience awesome   second time terrible   seeing Lion King 17th   place very busy nice see   bartender completely rude without cause   don't understand believe work tips   returning nor bring any town guests there   Vegas look bad   Really skip place very cool view but exceptionally rude staff  <EOR> Think Ghost Bar but slightly less Ghetto slightly more Class  super surprised lounge empty friday night  Tons breathing room beautiful views strip 64th floor friendly

The portions tasting menu huge tasting come hungry pace yourself   The bread basket 4 different kinds bread given two each   good but great   homemade peanut butter most memorable part bread butter     The amuse smoked salmon infused cheese potato chip yummy   My first course gnocchi peas mushrooms   course big miss me   gnocchi mushy sauce did nothing dish     Fortunately second course lobster au curry which absolutely amazing   Big chunks tender lobster meat served atop absolutely delicious curry sauce creamiest coconut rice ever all topped little crunchy things super helpful description know just sure were gave dish great texture   good   My third course filet mignon topped foie black truffles   Oof rich could hardly eat but also good   Obviously foie black truffles fantastic additions but filet itself perfection just melted mouth     There's palate cleanser before dessert course but tiny shot normally full size pina colada served normal martini glass   The chocolate souffle great but also worst weekend that honor Joel Robuchon    flavor souffle itself lacking but ribbon chocolate sauce near bottom provided some much needed chocolate flavor   pistachio ice cream came tasted homemade great   My husband did other tasting menu which five courses 1 dungeness crab salad 2 foie gras 3 seared scallops 4 lamb loin 5 Mix candy bar homemade candy bar chocolate peanut butter graham cracker dessert   sampled most all pretty good but didn't them much dishes overall admittedly menu more particular tastes    both thought strange foie served just itself top bread normally   little rich without bread   We both stuffed dessert course asked most desserts go   Shockingly sarcasm case can't tell agreed box normal restaurant didn't refuse another fancypants place   waiter saw busboy taking away mostly untouched desserts asked great concern if something wrong if he could bring something else house   explained just full but very much appreciated attentive service   didn't mignardises probably because hardly touched desserts which fair understand don't want waste food but would nice touch if they'd boxed too   The view restaurant really nice great view both strip mountains distance   dinner invite lounge if you'd which understand would otherwise cover charge   dining room really pretty nice decorations inside lovely outdoor area well but felt little weird eating because almost totally empty peak dinner time 7 9 pm   Sunday though which probably slowest night     This doesn't compare Picasso my favorite fine dining Vegas but definitely good meal glad came   If come MUST order lobster curry  <EOR> Have half dozen times   Great place quieter dinner   Most places around Vegas feel night club reliable place where take your time eating relatively quiet ambiance good view   haven't any standout dishes although everything prepared well some cases interesting   desserts where place fails   terrible but definitely underwhelming   big problem desserts when good just isn't much  <EOR> This restaurants strip nice view  located 64th floor Thehotel tower Mandalay Bay  two parts restaurants  soon off elevator see dance floor area right hand side left full service bar booths high table between  also patio area which great summer late spring  walk see hostess stand  second restaurant part  Everything white restaurant Tables fairly small fitting

Mignon medium rare  came just way it  also raw tuna dish but don't remember name exactly  thing remember dish sauce use unlike other sushi place didn't give standard wasabi soy sauce instead offer whipped egg white vinegar olive oil  really impressed tried it  small cake desert nothing really special cake specialty drink restaurant    I would say good place romantic dinner especially those going celebrate any special occasions  service good but definitely those places where take your time eat  2 half hours 4 course meal  bit pricey but view quality food think worth it  <EOR> This gem trip Las Vegas  First arrived fifteen minutes early able enjoy drink patio  very hot but worth view  Our favorites bass ceviche cod creamed spinach deserts mix candy bar coffee chocolate opera Not great Spicy crab salad fishy mac cheese many noodles enough cheese We also braised waygu filet new york strip fork smashed potatoes all great  Our server great until main course then difficult find again order coffee dessert  helper phenomenal all night  We definitely back both view fabulous food  bill included bottle wine 7 cocktails just under 500 dollars  <EOR> went lounge side other night   kind confused why charging $10 cover Monday night especially when place far packed but then door guy comped which made entry much more appealing   view fabulous  much better Ghostbar Palms  which softened hit weak $15 top shelf cocktails  <EOR> The view place amazing  pretty if dinner  There's also really cool wine wall  Plenty wine room costs more then some people year bottle   If don't want eat least lounge which connects restaurant  <EOR> Pretend upscale sick   terrible service mediocre food   understand mandalay bay stuck end strip but would trek better restaurant better hotel   never hated restaurant much entire life   NEVER stay mandalay bay back mix   gross   there's reason people don't want stay MB anymore   because don't care service quality  <EOR> My husband came anniversary dinner during recent vacation  BEST dinning experiences ever life  First room amazing  all white gorgeous and huge chandelier glass bubbles floating air  also cool pods couples sit in  however seat

gift certificate  dinner given compliments chef chilled corn soup  Sounded weird kinda gross but really really good  dinner both free range chicken vegetables potatoes  chicken AMAZING  Perfectly cooked chicken reduction  husband doesn't eat dark meat normally but all gone off both plates  then given at no charge two free desert martinis which heaven cup  wine steward excellent did two very good glasses wine  then ordered dessert desert tray which consisted five pieces heaven  flan chocolate desert few other things which can't remember right now but god amazing  also given two warm

Still being chocolate lover would chosen mousse lava cake la mode over any day   Sorry MIX!  I also two glasses sparkling rose Irish coffee accompany meal   rose nice but Irish coffee such kick could only finish half fear being unable walk restaurant!  The location view decor AMAZING!  sure you've all seen photos floating glass bubbles adorn center restaurant   floor also made emulate lace pattern   Service friendly but unfortunately slow side   took them over 2 5 hours serve four courses   Also felt price little high side only four courses   I've eaten comparable restaurants Vegas SF which cost same 6 9 courses   Nonetheless would still consider very good experience worth trying once   But if you're going all way higher tasting menu best chef offer! <EOR> Mix located top THEhotel Mandalay Bay must agree basically everyone because best view Las Vegas  club very sexy ambiance   and wasnt really crowded when arrived  So   if want spectacular pics Vegas day night must see  <EOR> Want sick view strip? Mix Lounge 64th floor Hotel Mandalay Bay it  Dance floor small but view surely takes your breath away  husband such great time company's CEO fellow coworkers  really sure prices drinks since all taken care but sure pricey  Bathrooms crazy  thought people could see but glass tinted while you're relieving yourself fantastic view strip     believe give hotel patrons discounted cover charge  <EOR> The service inattentive moment arrived  made way through 'club' dark space dark walls no cue guidance staff  When asked if headed correct direction received smug answer stone face  Making host stand checked waited awkwardly found table otherwise empty restaurant 3 other tables main area seated booth along exterior dining room comfortable enough   We observed several people walking table without acknowledgment taking least 15 minutes spoken anyone worked there  ordered dinner two steaks creamy spinach mac ham server's recommendation received bread basket it okay but little did know best part meal server assistant polite explained basket smile  Dinner took reasonable amount time deliver 25 30 min but presented rather mediocre manner  steaks little color no seared crispness crust see steak Excaliber Buffet Banner looked pretty similar came peppercorn sauce no trace pepper tasted hormel packaged gravy  garlic creamed spinach rather bland demure garlic flavor recommended mac cheese no better purchased box mac little chunks deli ham it  All items under seasoned lacked finesse other fine dining restaurants   However plus side portions reasonable prices you'll find Vegas  resort food credit meal total loss but would definitely spend own money here  <EOR> DEcided because steak menu pre set menu   When hostess check your reservation send elevator restaurant    When off elevator step into lounge  lounge nice view Vegas   pass lounge pass restaurants kitchen another hostess checks your reservation kind unnecessary think    waited little bit because change reservation smaller number  restaurant decorated nicely clear bubble hanging everywhere  lighting dim romantic   say dress business casual but let people jeans funny holiday hats well LOL!
