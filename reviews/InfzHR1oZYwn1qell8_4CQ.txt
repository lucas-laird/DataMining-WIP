On menu  one sided card menu items listed didn't appear anything over $10 00 entire menu now you're speaking language!  hummus eh pita bread decent chicken kabob ok   Each entree comes equipped own little mini salad  placed salad parenthesis because literally 4 pieces lettuce 2 cucumbers 2 slices tomato obviously highlight meal   chicken kabobs decent healthy portion rice served dish never bad thing book but order yogurt sauce separate side didn't therefore chicken lacked tad flavor   All all there's much report regarding service since pretty much fast food type Mediterranean eatery where seat yourself order pick your food grab your own drinks drink station     It's cute concept but being neck woods all doubt find myself driving 25 minutes specifically eat Village   Price fantastic food quality decent nice purple trees? <EOR> Clean restaurant but food very bland  restaurant would survive Southern California where find REAL persian food  <EOR> Where did those beautiful fire trees? want one!    They serve great food great ambiance weird wall modern art    hummus chicken kebab koobideh ground beef skinless sausage package    Everything tasty tender well bit overpriced dinner time   would suggest going lunch bring adventurous date here     P S  Asian kept looking dipping sauce   Want see some food porn? http www yelp com biz_photos the village mediterranean grill las vegas?select=erHlZTjF6KE_vnqLHEtUMQ#erHlZTjF6KE_vnqLHEtUMQ <EOR> The ground chicken best thing tried restaurant  plenty delicious flavors each bite  Unfortunately boneless chunks chicken came chicken soltani $17 99 weren't nearly good  beef kabob $16 99 looked better tasted due lack seasoning its course texture    On plus side both entrees came some amazingly fluffy delicious Basmati rice  Portion sizes huge each entree big enough two people  moderately high prices charge would best split them    The hummus decent yogurt cucumber dip heavy dill   It's sit down restaurant large open interior two lit trees stationed center   If want more casual spot eat meaning cheaper you're probably better off elsewhere  <EOR> So happy place just opened down street me!  noticed beautiful pink purple lighted trees outside in   menu simple portions generous   ordered Koobideh kebab side baba ghanoosh   kebabs large served over huge bed rice   Loved grilled tomato also fresh onions   Even radishes good   little heavy fresh parlsey though   meal also included salad soup bar   All ingredients very fresh liked balsamic dressing had   Only complaint items salad bar individually covered which made getting salad bit awkward   hold lids while balancing plate making salad   Also drinks weird location right fron counter   think should put just around cashier don't tell people line 'excuse me' while drink   think should planned little better   But food thoughtfully prepared perfectly spiced fresh bread nice touch   even tried baklava which world!

Oh yeah definitely gonna regular here  <EOR> I came because rave reviews fast casual cheap mediterranean place  menu seems changed bit I think menu online just lunch special prices? bit pricier dinner order counter anymore free tea soup but sit down service  portions rather large still worth money    The BF started off hummus appetizer  bowl hummus biggest serving ordered decent but needed little bit more salt seasoning  pita served alright need eat fast cold tad chewy    Fesenjon pomegranate chicken stew believe $13 came piping hot burned tongue seasoned rice  flavor nice dish bit sweet savory chicken tender  other Persian stews looked good well something don't really see many menus worth trying checking if try something new   Koobideh Lula Luleh believe $12 Kebab really great here! Very juicy deliciously spiced  haven't good koobideh while tore into this    Service decent checked drinks if needed more pita  owner came say hi well    Overall pretty good Mediterranean Persian food  Would come back try some other stews but definitely back koobideh  <EOR> I came falafel but am adding falafel short list  wow factors include villa esque interior  expecting huge wooden booths tiled floors twinkling light trees  Nicely done  Despite fancy digs spot completely casual  order counter take your number   Other notables pita bread prepared fresh order complimentary lentil stew tea cauldron everyone enjoy  Considering bonus treats price terribly cheap  All plates around $8 when plate hits table your eyes pop generous helping  personally didn't enjoy flavor lentil stew It wasn't typical lentil soup but still appreciated being free   Now falafel  served plate big heap crispy fries all salad fixin's  first bite falafel great flavor right  But texture dense eating half wasn't happy finishing serving  favorite falafels kind pop open when cut them but required knife really slice through  necessarily bad thing just preference   So probably wouldn't back falafel but think atmosphere price point would warrant repeat visit try kebab maybe just snag delicious fresh salad run  <EOR> I honestly liked better when bistro  prices food portions served great back then until decided switch into more restaurant esque atmosphere  Prices little steep honestly felt same portion flavor food served back when bistro  <EOR> Super clean very friendly service   food great chicken kebob amazing juicy being greasy but cooked through!  rice super fluffy long grain delicious!  look forward trying Baklava    but portions lunch left bit room dessert   The staff attentive very friendly   coming often!  On side note electric trees middle dining room pink magenta blossoms all over them odd strangely compelling    <EOR> I could place more  The food very good Extremely close authentic  The service little iffy  only ones place food took forever   waiter forgot several orders  The price extremely high food   Even discount sticker shocked   mean isn't high end steak place rather very casual Mediterranean restaurant serving normal cuts meat   portions large but still felt sticker shocked   The spice used very good waiter did take time explain some items even trying discourage teenagers trying flavored milk type drink whose name eludes now   He right   Take 3 4 dollars off each dinner plate place would rock 4 5 stars  <EOR> Let's see food ok service ok atmosphere wasn't bad  want give 4 stars but might just refrain myself here's why   Atmosphere 4 5 Nice atmosphere inside some nice purple lightings  Quiet original middle eastern restaurant but it  If could dim light during evening would feel more romantic restaurant cantina  just personal preference  Food 3 5 5 Food wasn't bad but wasn't excellent well  Let's say maybe expecting something better more flavorful  food wasn't bad just fell tasteless sometimes  Presentation food good but kinda disappointed restaurant big doesn't its own bread  would place much better worth going   Service 3 5 Service alright  guy nice advised couple items  most personable service ever but descent Persian restaurant  Let's just say experienced worst   Overall rating 3 5 am gonna give them 3 stars because felt little bit disappointed spending total $28 Entrée Sparkling Water  excepting more price paid necessarily food wise but quality taste atmosphere    just think kinda expensive restaurant outside Strip  But  just take it  Would back? necessarily placed top restaurants if am Vegas  <EOR> I because just wanted try new place eat ended here   atmosphere nice   decorations looked semi fancy   paintings booths lighted trees all pretty   menu looked fancy but cheap  new guess   food okay   just wished knew ordering  But overall nice  <EOR>
