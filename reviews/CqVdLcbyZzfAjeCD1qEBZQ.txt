The ONLY reason didn't give them full 5 stars because observation could possibly use assistance additional person help wait tables but presume happen once become busier    which will   While made sure tag location Facebook Instagram accounts many friends between California already very excited try place just matter time   add lack help did affect dining experience negatively all owners worked efficiently together serve timely manner   I understand some people may less perfect experience but honestly happens occasion everywhere   eaten some best restaurants Las Vegas travels beyond times where food service expectations but never soured desire eat again    I would recommend if curious least give them try once breakfast once lunch dinner   never hurts support local family's small business you'll eating great meal while you're it  <EOR> Went Kailyn's late breakfast early lunch day knew I'd busy eat until late night  restaurant mom and pop place bit retro vibe  clean pretty quiet time there    I Kalbi omelette which awesome hoped  Now omelette's runny but inside little jiggly outside bit rubbery side  Maybe just batch odd eggs bad omelette day ordered wrong thing but definitely hoping more food department  definitely try come back order something different update review    Service extremely quick very accommodating doing no carb thing sub side  She no problem didn't feel weird kick fuss which am always grateful for  Service would solid 4 but omelette just disappointment  <EOR> I going Kailyn's least once week since last December  Robert Carolyn treat family  food amazing!! favorite pulled pork sandwich  tried Chef Robert's burgers first time today loved it  He encouraged try even though big burgers am ever glad did!! great neighborhood restaurant where feel very much home! <EOR> So delicious! ideal American breakfast choices but aren't afraid creative Korean fusion sort dishes  Delicious really hope place stay! <EOR> The owners sweet friendly!! food fabulous  breakfast pleasantly surprised quickness delicious meal  must go!
