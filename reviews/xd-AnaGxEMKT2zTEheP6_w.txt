Yum yum    <EOR> First timer tried few items better idea all hype about   I ordered Fire OG boneless tenders Vegas fries Fried Chicken Burger Vegas fries deep fried Oreos   The Fire OG chicken didn't taste all much different any Wing Stop boneless chicken also wasn't spicy anticipated them either   The piece Chicken fried chicken sandwich fat! opinion should wider able pair well oversized bun  If don't strategically plan your next bites you'll all bun no chicken which happened lot because just didn't fit together  Juicy tender inside but crunchy some burnt parts outside making almost hurt bite  Although admire trying different but believe poor execution   The Vegas FF aka Sin City FF drenched nacho cheese sauce Bad AZZ Sauce!!!! Maybe some plus but wasn't  dig around fries slight lacked texture something little disappointed crunch! didn't here   Unfortunately wasn't pleased much all   The menu unique employees helpful    They good ideas just believe could done much much better! <EOR> This pretty cool place just noticed hadn't finished review don't lot Yelp If remember correctly food good but didn't any music playing which left awkwardly uncomfortable feeling place  Food good though! <EOR> Me husband few times before loved food when late tonight thought would stop again  When arrived best spirits but still ordered  food horrible! ordered white widow deep fried Oreos just ok  also ordered Pineapple Express jack cheddar fries  meat still raw most spots badass sauce tons tons mustard covering your foods black pepper!! returning again experience tonight  sad because when first opened food awesome! Service definitely gone down hill!!!! <EOR> Loved food staff wish Henderson  much good thing can't bad right lol? <EOR>
