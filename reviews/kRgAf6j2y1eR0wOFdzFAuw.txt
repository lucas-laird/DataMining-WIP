I tad bummed because although Delirium Tremens beer menu tap when there  waitress did express some concern online menu which seen it   BUt still happy beers ordered its place  don't care known Sangria  Sangria day before baby shower  over having just some fruity wine  beer poison choice night    Service main waitress really good  She very fast informative kept all separate checks straight large group gratuity charge!   The other servers really missed mark getting waters refilled handing food  When  some plates came would edge table say tomato soup? ordered tomato soup? happened every single time  became grating  because said barely above whisper just stood repeating until someone realized it  table large very easy someone deep conversation several feet away miss call food  don't know if way improve upon strategy    Overall fun time people enjoy tapas style eating  But dishes did really impress enough give place 4 5 star review  <EOR> This great stop away hustle bustle strip   Great atmosphere patio adorable   great variety things choose from  super sharing trying new things  servers staff very attentive without being pushy  great find! <EOR> BEST FOOD LAS VEGAS?!?!

Thursday PACKED very loud    Also free valet <EOR> The value price paid great   food good maybe slightly above average     We ordered calamari eggplant roll ups mac cheese scallops ham croquetas salad     The calamari good greasy rings tentacles  sauce served   salad good but write can't remember memorable   But remember loved salad dressing vinaigrette some sort    husband liked croquetas but croquetas favorite thing fond gooey center     The scallops some sort burnt taste them   Kind reminded burnt garlic   cooked well but ruined burnt garlic taste   Maybe something stuck grill then stuck scallops   find inexcusable     Eggplant roll ups quite tasty wish portion larger ordered another plate   Eggplant goat cheese very little tomato sauce   Over all good   The mac cheese made manchego cheese   think manchego best eaten its own fruit   didn't mac cheese but think  personal taste dish served here   mac cheese more traditional creamy   Again just opinion knock against restaurant     I'd back try other dishes but think spoiled previous experiences other authentic Spanish Tapas Restaurants   example Emilio's Hillside IL  <EOR> Firefly absolute favorite tapas restaurant town   Took family while town loved experience just much always do   all favorite dishes but some faves ham croquettas baked Brie stuffed dates Serrano sliders   sparkling sangria also fabulous   Great social restaurant enjoy small bites friends family date! <EOR> Absolutely amazing food staff  twice now come back every visit Vegas  <EOR> We came full expectation but whole experience disappointment  seated side table  place loud even wasn't full  tables close each other  We hard time picking waiter didn't know recommend felt he randomly saying dishes  We picked few all pretty tasteless small portions  None stood disappointed food   We eggplant goat cheese escargot dish please stick escargots made no sense tuna chips another don't even remember  stars tuna really good but nothing blew away  Won't back  <EOR> So much fun! first time glad friend made reservation because place packed! enjoyed white sangria more red but both good  told champagne sangria great probably next time  came husband 5 friends place great group because try many tapas way  bacon wrapped dates husband's favorite group whole  really loved apple manchego salad surprising much enjoyed it  fresh crisp nutty  definitely next time  filet delicious thought Mac n cheese just ok  mushroom pastries lightly crispy but saucy mushrooms top we're just ok  Calamari good stuffed peppers yummy  Padron peppers flash fried table favorite thought good but might enjoyed them more more lemon  impressed stuffed mushrooms which disappointing  heirloom tomato salad wasn't very good  butter lettuce vinagrette tomatoes yummy but creamy cheese slathered top just much  overwhelmed dish ruined me  All all extremely excited back  definitely getting Sangria pitcher filet apple salad dates stuffed red peppers again  Hopefully leave some room try some new things dessert!  I took away star because waitress kind snobby seemed wish anywhere but kind mood  assuming because group automatically added gratuity don't think she very deserving it  Having waitress completely understand adding gratuity parties I wish did when worked Applebee's' but feel some waiters take advantage slack service  return though! <EOR> This spot lunch side town  Love Apple Manchego Salad! absolute favorite!

She took order again split  Now 40 minutes into celebration she returns drink  asked bread ?  bus boys brings cold hard bread   seamed days food comes she drops tried split  ask if could warm bread  She only give ready kitchen  explained dined least 35 times never told that  busboy returned warm bread  She never came back see if everything ok if wanted order anything else need another drink  dessert left thinking ever want return again! Walked into dark scary parking lot back find six week old car smashed back broken tail light  ahead hide back no see us   Just never see again  <EOR> Last minute decided try place boyfriend friend  service great super nice waiter  Ordered foods drinks pretty quick  all delicious!

Great Service outdoor patio spacious nicely lit  Sangria definitely 10  Definitely place try if want share try different flavors! <EOR> I skeptical come back but friend insistent getting tapas  thought food okay but wasn't mind numbingly amazing mouth watering   AMBIANCE 4 gonna deny really nice venue  dimly lit very organized tables inside  Also let sit wherever want to  dim lights sitting best friend alone lounge  it pretty romantic haha! whole place very lounge like actually pretty comfortable    SERVICE 3 many places service pretty good beginning slower worse towards end! Most food came fast but some them came hour later rest!   FOOD 3 don't any food really want shine light on  None really popped really amazing worth mentioning  Probably best part meal strawberry mojito which pretty well done!   I'm going say generalization because happened all dishes ordered  food taste average above average  But every dish major problems such really dry meat sometimes tasted off right cheese used wasn't luxurious tasting compared rest dish    In conclusion good but wasn't great    Lastly don't wanna those people but think should mention anyway  My friend both stomach aches long ate  never eaten since 2010 2011 friend never eaten Firefly previously    My real complaint should kept Firefly west side open instead one! <EOR> I absolutely love place always come here  Whenever friends town am trying impress friend Vegas local hot spot go to place   My favorites include Apple manchego salad Tuna Tartare Stuffed Dates Scallop Excargots Petite Filet Last time visited ventured comfort zone ordered some plates very first time  new favorite actually Herb roasted chicken  juicy flavorful  many restaurants miss chicken but just hit spot  also comes delicious crispy fries very filling   I dreaming Paella since ordering birthday May ordered again time but something terribly wrong  super salty could taste rice distinctively though flavored well  advised waiter alerted chef  manager very kind  He came table apologized took Paella off bill  would loved order more but already waited 40 minutes cook place decided pass  love handled situation  still loyal back future sure!  We also ordered sangria pitcher wonderful  very smooth fruity think perfect light weight but only if sharing Overall besides wonderful food decor beautiful slight dim lighting  noise level little higher if sit inside but also outside seating beautiful lights  all very fresh exciting  <EOR> This excellent tapas option reasonable prices delicious food  Additionally fairly extensive gluten free menu which added bonus party  atmosphere great dinner before night town  Must try dishes include ever classic bacon wrapped dates ahi tuna skewers ribeye  Additionally didn't try paella but sangria decent  <EOR> Have since moved block away  Big n spacious valet sh*ty attitude  Even if ask perceive stupid question    you should still pleasant your response  Since hadn't new location lighting dark place looked closed valets just setting stand asked if bar open  Response tude guess should    Anyway didn't eat just stopped drink see decor  Good drinks  self park your car!! <EOR> This place go to when Vegas  also eaten fancy places Strip but take Firefly over them! only tapas drinks Big Bowl salad but everything amazing  tapas tried mushroom tart chicken skewers petite filet stuffed dates ham croquetas apple manchego salad garden variety salad  Each dish beautifully presented tantalizing combination flavors  sangria Fly Mule awesome too!
