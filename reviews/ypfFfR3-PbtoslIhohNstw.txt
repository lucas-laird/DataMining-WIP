Never coming back quality meat even worth compared price!!! <EOR> Although food good prices high    They offer 3 different levels AYCE 90 minute timeline but everyone table order same level if only person wants extra items higher level? understand want sure people only eating pay but seems little unfair people person just wants minimum priced choices  Seeing don't AYCE Korean outside SURA really wasn't issue but more reason use option  also feel if you're going put time limit meal should quick food  sat next table always seemed waiting meats come which fair patron    Anyway mom ordered Kalbi she Bibim Bap Ojingo squid also beanpaste soup  didn't really care dishes she event commented both tasted different last time she ordered them different improved way    The Kalbi good good clean cut meat  wasn't sweet savory generally but did good flavor    I can't bring myself give more average rating place seems challenge majority restaurants Las Vegas poor service    I refills water quite regularly but aside no service  mom flag down someone multiple times when didn't see she tried getting attention Korean which she also multiple times before noticed  could imagine also if don't speak Korean like table next some complications ordering meat could frustrating experience    Also if more 2 people doing AYCE prepared VERY overfilled cramped table  much room outside grill  <EOR> I came recommendation husband dined many Korean friends recommended place  very good service throughout meal  chose buffet choice which included better cuts meat am very glad did  didn't ribeye much but beef short ribs best  marinade used very tasty  papaya salad ordered just tad spicy me    Meats very fresh sides traditional nothing special add there  did switch grill between sessions cooking but waitress always helped clean grill some meats too!

So juicy lol its worth price staff AWESOME! helpful  <EOR> The food great good selection side dishes waitresses actively replenish  <EOR> Great food service   After reading some reviews Lee's service shocked because when came pleasant experience  lunch brother friend  waitress super attentive made sure waters always filled  She even came every often help cook didn't expect all  used traditional KBBQ places where there's hardly any attention wait staff but Lee's exception  AYCE lunch fairly priced $21 something  also cleaner Tofu Hut definitely coming back  <EOR> The foods salty employees very loud  Also very bad service  All employees fighting serving area  It very unpleasant experience restaurant  <EOR> Bad bad quality service  offer $19 $25 n $32 meal   ask $19 n force buy $25 meal even tho don't want meats more expensive meal  <EOR> Came 11am Thursday   Fair crowd fully busy but empty either    We did Level tier AYCE priciest AYCE   quite happy meat selection quality meat  Personally thought kalbi worth getting Level A  Quite good cut meat flavor   Also really enjoyed steamed egg side dishes although those seem come little slower meat order   Perfect amount dukbokki which arrived table nice hot   cheese corn quite nice too!  Servers prompt tried attend much could   Preference shown customers older demographic however we youngest patrons time issue personally servers attentive amount traffic lunch hour   Restaurant felt little warm side  Granted lunch time seated window facing front store having KBBQ expect somewhat hot  However some discomfort general sitting area due heat   What did appreciate two female servers questioned tip directly they did see full amount left table did apologize    also spoke Korean each other 'lack tip' assuming did speak Korean party ordered everything English spoke each other English   Again issue quality food price AYCE   But don't appreciate being spoken front language am fluent because mistake made staff regarding tip left   Sadly left sour note end great meal  <EOR> The food great but customer service sucked!!!  few family members came decided buffet dinner special  issue arose when couple came white set beside ended getting food ahead us  Mind first 15 minutes before getting appetizers but took less 10 minutes white couple entire full course meal  if black please esblishment  people super bias discriminate against black people  sad part situation still left big tip white couple ended leaving before didnt tip all  first last time would ever eat again!!! <EOR> I trying all korean bbqs Las Vegas rates average in middle  quality wasn't excellent but wasn't horrible either    Pros *Open 24 7 *Located further strip don't deal tourists   Cons *$$$ price paying number better Korean BBQs better service more food   Competition wise ranking 1  Moo Woo * * * * * 5 stars Excellent service good quality food portions located Summerlin no where near strip Spring Mountain   2  Hobak tied Magal * * * * 4 stars Both good think Hobak beats Magal slightly customer service  Food good won't leave hungry   3  Biwon * * * 3 stars Lots food below average service good All eat deals located Sahara  bad   4  Lees Korean BBQ * * * 3 stars Surprisingly pricey stingy meat servings hard waitresses attention  thought we'd better deal but order twice much meat husband would left hungry  strongly recommend choosing different Korean BBQ  only tried because open late night   5  DJK * * * 3 stars most pricey average service  I used love coming dinner but seems prices increased serving portions decreased  <EOR> We place first time last night   very good   stone pot rice thingie seafood pancake   ayce BBQ cook yourself but didn't think could justice   servers kinda hands off but  okay sometimes   place pretty modern decor very clean service issue whatever   open til 2 am which good cause never decide dinner til everything usually closed  <EOR> Originally gave 3 stars because bad service bad waitress working long time  Short hair lady  Don't know name don't care she doesn't care customers either  know cause eaten many times she still doesn't remember face  Today decided give extra star because two waitresses named JINA Unnie HeeJung Unnie always extra miles sure everything need  treat kindly sincerity smiles  Thank always being kind  HeeJung Unnie hope see when you're working too! <EOR> When moved Vegas hunting Good Korean BBQ Tried several them till found Lee's Korean BBQ The best thing always clean service fine Must open 24 7 offer all eat options! Depending meat selection option choose price $20 $33 all eat course still la Carte menu  It's roomy clean! sorry didn't take much pictures usual  starving yesterday lol forgot take pics Service fast  waitress friendly but  still pleasant  They usually start grilling meat then your own unless your burn grill then come say no no no lol the little dishes come meat kimchi sprouts papaya salad spicy hot guys radish green salad dressing tasty all then bring salt pepper sesame oil et some soy sauce I wish would bring some spicy chili oil instead soy sauce better sushi opinion The only reason why didn't put 5 stars often ask twice refill accompanied dish like papaya salad kimchi sprouts     <EOR> OMG! came first time when did AYCE   This truly best Korean BBQ AYCE LA CARTE Las Vegas!  Not only dishes traditionally prepared but beef high quality USDA prime rest meat excellent quality  price little bit more many other Korean BBQs town but truthfully just try AYCE pick many dishes  suggest getting steamed egg bean soup extra kimchi brisket bulgogi ribeye marinated pork chicken end does ruin flavor non marinated dishes   I highly suggest planning spend 1 5 2 hours takes little longer your food let alone cook it  <EOR> Prices pretty expensive menu very limited  Staff extremely rude aggressive very slow  don't really pay here  worth making second trip  <EOR> Overall good food! staff nice but sure ask everything front because probably won't see them until end your meal  nice offer all eat if you're interested  weren't super hungry ordered meal two @$40 which came variety protein prepared ourselves well two soups white rice few other sides  believe better places town but isn't bad wasn't super packed which nice  also open 24 hrs which cool  <EOR> My first time Woonam Jung  atmosphere nice service friendly attentive  very rare see smiling staff korean restaurant  Just saying    Flavor quality pretty standard korean barbecue  Nothing stood except when asked side rice purple korean rice  bit sticky slightly nutty flavor  don't know called but really liked it  Meat portions good well side dishes    Was dining 2 brothers boy eat  plenty side dishes meat pork galbi etc  three around $80  Normal pricing non AYCE korean barbecue  <EOR> This best Korean BBQ to  So far ! Today did dinner B which only 19 99 first time tried chicken bulgogi and delicious normally just brisket pork belly but decided venture little bit today    We always Lee's numerous amounts times especially when friends Reno come back into town  Korean BBQ place love it! <EOR> So two other friends lunch today   ordered lunch specials soon du bu Garbi combo friends ordered Mandu soup Yook Ge Jang Stew  reasons giving them only 3 stars because 1 didn't ask spicy wanted soon du bu stew even if tofu specialty restaurant should still ask 2 banchan the multiple side dishes accompany your main dish included potato salad!  Really??? potato salad?  Since when Korean banchan dish???  purely filler! don't know why but first Korean restaurant encountered where serve non Korean banchan   Perhaps trying cater non Koreans?  sure but proper appreciated certainly welcomed any Korean!  If need drop non Korean banchan fill cheap banchan   least it'll Korean   visiting Korean restaurant all!  I forgot ask brown rice instead white rice took owner FOREVER bring brown rice me   couldn't really start eat until rice because food tends spicy need your rice offset spice   Also service also seemed bit slow side especially if Asian   some reason tables non Asians like Caucasians seemed served faster friendlier   So end next time am town looking frequent restaurant first even second choice  <EOR> Other being all eat place place gross   Don't eat here   E Jo Mother's instead   food bland overall grade meat below par intentional cross contamination food unsanitary  <EOR> The food five stars but service could've better   hence three stars   Servers very slow attend call them several times drink refills side dishes  <EOR> Hands down best Korean BBQ joint town  First all quality meat very good  recommend Beef Tongue Brisket starters  If Kalbi Baby Octopus bask sauce very good  If feel needs little more kick ask chili sauce! think its nice addition   Secondly environment very clean tidy  place always speckless looks good place causal business settings  Thumbs up!  Lastly late night menu something looking forward to  always use another 24 hour restaurant stop when which most weekends  watching show going bar club stop Chinatown frequently some late eating  Glad know Lee's only 24 7 but feature some good dishes coming future  Thanks heads Max! the manager speaking to   <EOR> I'll right point meat quality decent side dishes OK SERVICE Horrible! <EOR> The short rib boiled egg absolutely amazing!!  can't believe first time here!  definitely coming back!!!!! <EOR> Sorry korean  Did clean table larger group but seated othwr people speakn korean walk tight in  if speak korean first while watch  Forgot take drink order girls took order forgot bring 1 persons food out  Check mess  greats stories bad experience was  Did communicate well  Customers felt ignored  <EOR> Better quality meat other KBBQ places been    The workers Woonam Jung always quick  personally never wait more 15 minutes seat Christmas parties ranging 2 8 people   They open ALL year 24 7 considering surprised workers aren't always cranky    The restaurant extremely clean grills don't look over used there's never anything floor bathrooms also always tidy    My go to KBBQ joint  <EOR> Move over Sura all other Korean AYCE BBQ new undisputed champ arrived Woo Nam Jung!

UNACCEPTABLE! COME HERE!  If could give place negative stars would!   A group 8 came around 5PM during CES week January 11th place empty only 2 tables guests dining  sat down table waited 25 minutes waiting someone take order but when waitress finally came instead taking order she told cannot accommodated because reservation 6 30!! only 5PM place empty! could finished before 6 30 anyways  horrible wasted almost half hour time just kick out    That ridiculous unacceptable service!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Customer service satisfactory sometimes tend forget your order  <EOR> First off let say lived South Korea 6 months   far closest thing authentic Korean BBQ far quality meat freshness goes   might think little pricy but you're paying quality   highly recommend place  ribeye! <EOR> Food authentic very well done  service another story!  Walked multiple tables cleaned prior diners wanted seat separate room everyone else  When asked sit room everyone initially said no because table sat 6 only 2 but restaurant plenty other tables 2pm past rush hour  ordered no came checked either  looked back 2 servers eating talking another room ask water check anything needed  <EOR> I love place lunch special  price affordable taste great   Kalbi cold noodle soup naengmyun combo favorite!  If Korean food place try  <EOR> I no idea why place only 3 stars food amazing service excellent  Maybe price people happy but pay which lot  Ask Min your sever never level service he provided any other Vegas K BBQ  <EOR> I must say every time crave Korean BBQ Woonam Jung but always completely satisfied because food but mainly because service    I believe brought 5 different kinds side dishes but didn't really enjoy any them besides cabbage salad  Most time don't even touch them only enjoy bean sprouts meat   As far quality meat brisket always pretty much consistent across board most restaurants no complaints there  pork belly very thick boyfriend seemed enjoy it  steak also thick juicy  However ordered bulgogi funky smell very dry sweet  don't think ordering if next time    The biggest downfall service  Most time done all meat platter often find myself sitting 15 minutes waiting waitress come attention order more food  Also don't know if because am Korean always come eat Caucasian boyfriend but often forget give certain items such sauce brisket unless asked  pattern noticed and told when worked Korean BBQ restaurant other Korean BBQ restaurants    For price think lunch prices reasonable but dinner price little expensive eat BBQ regular basis  Cumulatively food price Woonam Jung now but hopefully find better Korean BBQ restaurant soon  <EOR> It bit pricey kbbq places LA but food great  staff very nice  place also clean bit classy  highly recommend <EOR> The place great when first opened few times that  happened?

Service pretty good  owners came greet because knew cousin law  servers prompted attentive  next time back Las Vegas would definitely come back dinner! <EOR> My brother took restaurant few years ago some reason remembered being amazing since then telling wanted back   finally made back during last visit sad say just good remembered    This definitely fun place if wanting true Korean BBQ experience   thought lunch price all you can eat little steep being $23 per person but good variety meats choose from   brother disappointed ribs part lunch menu all you can eat but dinner   also confused whether price included tea he thought did but did list anywhere     We enjoyed spicy chicken ribeye sirloin   All meats really good also ribeye very fatty     Service could better   asked tea end meal which never came   gave 15 minutes before deciding leave   Other price really enjoyed experience Lee's  <EOR> I came late night because restaurant nearby time  open super late  didn't eat AYCE because price way steep dinner instead soup might mistake though cheaper! bland flavorful but least healthy!   The staff kind responsive but weren't very many people used call button edge table much more helpful way! come back try AYCE next time! <EOR> My family locals many times  Generally enjoyable but today probably most annoying disappointed experience   The food itself good usually consistent  But service beyond awful  Korean know expect decent level respect but waitress rude argumentative accommodating    Our food came later everyone food came separately forgot order when expressed discontent waitress argued  very annoying won't coming back  <EOR> I've tried handful Korean bbq places I'd say favorite besides DJK but DJK DJK  LOL  came Sunday afternoon seated immediately  loved meat quality tell immediately serving quality meats  lunch menu all eat bit different dinner menu  Dinner menu better selection if ask me  wasn't fan banchan but kimchee amazing  favorite meat marinated beef sirloin  Brisket also good  Kalbi lunch menu full order more anyway  bit more other KBBQ places but worth it  Wait staff very attentive friendly left happy satisfied  <EOR> It authentic Korean bbq experience  meat kimchi delicious  Service quick friendly <EOR> The service amazing  sweet lady cooked everything us  seated right away  food hugeee!!
