A M A Z I N G! excited when found  Nittaya's Secret Kitchen opening fast casual Thai restaurant house South Summerlin!   We ordered beef jerky famous spinach salad appetizer both dishes fantastic amazing flavors  main entrees ordered Drunken noodles Basil chicken which incredible well  LOVE offered myriad beers accompany flavorful foods  <EOR> Just came Block 9  Ordered garlic spare ribs yellow curry  Unfortunately ribs WAY over cooked dry curry REALLY bland    HOWEVER fiance daughter bbq'd pork skewers thought ok  Just so so over all   Looked still getting some things together maybe perfect recipes over time  But price wait I'd say skip now stick your normal Thai spot  <EOR> I love place casual version fave Nittaya's Secret Kitchen  Wonderful fast fresh made to order Thai street food  nice evening lovely patio dine on  home run! <EOR> Nittaya's fast food concept really good really fast really fresh   Very casual concept where order counter sit down your number    disposable flatware silverware felt little down market but food stellar   menu consists Thai favorites made fresh served quick   tried drunken noodles basil chicken tofu fries    each dish bright fresh basil spices   Great quick casual meal  <EOR> I tried Block 9 Street Eats today pleasantly surprised!  ordered pad se ew which came very hot temperature tasted delicious   definitely going back! <EOR> Great family atmosphere outdoor seating  ordered yellow curry chicken rice  Good size portion just sure if you're allergic any nuts let them know put peanuts curry  Also pork skewers very good could use little more char it  pad thai noodles good  best menu world famous spinach salad  fried spinach tangy dipping sauce  Love it! would put sauce steak chicken then winner! Hint chef  desserts good friends ordered each  fan cream cheese banana roll  Overall great place some street food  <EOR> I came three times week  means problem maybe place good  note Nittaya's cannot compare   Honestly think location bit random  located far end commercial plaza  If see Peet's  some sort workout place you're headed right direction   Order counter  Somehow magically remember ordered what  grilled pork skewers pad see ew green curry basil chicken panang beef fried mussels famous spinach salad  Overall really don't complaints place  Flavors explosive but also refreshing  manage potentially heavy fried spinach into refreshing dish tart sauce  panang beef fell flat me while flavors similar green curry beef tough leathery  If choose favorite dish far it'd grilled pork skewers!!  Most entrees 11 bucks  find they're big enough portions two meals  Since just down street where am sure back!! <EOR> Meh  food served plastic utensils paper plates   fast food feel it  may some least flavorful Thai food ever had  flavor food seems very Americanized catering those cannot tolerate real Thai flavor spices  returning <EOR> Had Tom Kha soup   broth delicious much chicken vegetables felt eating stew instead soup   Terrific definitely back  <EOR> I really wanted love place however very disappointed  service great friendly but food great  decided Yellow Curry  gross but sure worst ever restaurant  Almost every Thai restaurant lunch special around $7 $10 did not  understand supposed really casual place they serve paper plates but feel prices match quality  cant justify paying more would pay somewhere else when food presentation much lesser quality  <EOR> Block 9 great! wanted try new place lunch leaving Downtown Summerlin easy choice  menu most entrees shown vegetarian option  always crave curry asked if could made without fish sauce  cashier replied don't use fish sauce curries  ordered Bangkok fried rice daughter veggie panang curry famous crispy spinach share   The fried rice comes fried egg top  forgot ask them cook through because daughter doesn't eat yolk  famous spinach salad just crispy fried batter few spinach leaves adding some green color  dipping sauce chicken it  probably wouldn't order dish again but try curiosity  added few leaves curry nice crunchy texture   The panang curry spicy! wasn't asked heat level but least medium  expecting tofu but received only vegetables which fresh well cooked  Block 9 great concept Nittaya's excellent Thai recipes look forward dining again when around Summerlin  <EOR> Food great  Quick service  Happy able lunch spend exorbitant amount money long time enjoy great meal  Definitely returning    Loved Bangkok Fried Rice! Highly recommend  <EOR> 11 dollats chicken fried rice ? kinda street food these  alright deal but wait   ordered pork fried rice instead chicken charged 1 dollar extra pork  serious? Youve gotta b kidding me   1 dollars MORE pork  ended paying 13 dollars street food pork fried rice    Never back again  <EOR> I've place 8 times since opened 2 months ago  love place weekly visit  ingredients beyond fresh would say higher end Thai place    You order counter bring your food  Prices per person $11    I love place  <EOR> Great place quick meal  Clean well lit good food   We ordered spinach salad Bangkok fried rice  Both cooked perfection  spinach salad crispy super addicting paired perfectly spicy chili sauce came with  Bangkok fried rice also flavorful much chicken    more any other fried rice dishes ordered Vegas! just chicken cooked evenly  Juicy flavorful stringy dry bland   The service great food brought hot fresh  didn't come same time but  no problem knew cooking orders fresh  Every now then asked if needed anything else once finished used plates taken away us  appreciate kind attention kind place   The prices only reason knocked off star  portion $11 bit much fried rice but guess  why much chicken     If anything stop spinach salad  alone worth trip if don't live around price  <EOR> Very good food! Drunken noodle point! But need improve service  understand fast food style joint but when your restaurant Summerlin expect better service  just worry counting sale receipts customer  <EOR> When saw exiting off 215 Town Center thought oooooh quick small Thai food sounds great lunch! Being Friday lunch hour swooped foodie adventure  Basil chicken classic Thai dish ground chicken basil leaves sliced red bell peppers  $11 portion size enough leftovers average price point  flavor point served fresh off wok  would prefer street eats something more consumable size reflecting industry lunch special pricing if order dish elsewhere would run around $8 9  Overall pleasant experience place packed  <EOR> Amazing!  Drunken noodles basil chicken best ever had  <EOR> New local Thai spot located off 215 Town Center edge Summerlin   Block 9 only open week now  small place but very clean it's brand new expected   restaurant maybe 20 tables give take   would consider good quick food  wanting call fast food but set counter register where order then sit down wait food small # your table staff locate give food  bring soon made person may order before another same table  Thankfully rid awkward iPad ordering system when first opened first thought super awkward standing counter just making your order before receiving any service food it tipping without any service yet  food really good !  Pad Thai curry both excellent choices  wonder why pad Thai doesn't cilantro ? Maybe needs requested since many ppl don't cilantro   ??? TBD <EOR> Cute place but over priced  Ordered pad Thai $11 smaller portion $8 lunch special Archi's  spare ribs good but only received  few pieces  Tom yum salty definitely pricey  4 items $40+ pricey paper plate fast food joint  <EOR> The restaurant indoor outdoor seating  Ordering done counter receive number informs server where deliver food  Beer Wine soft drinks available  soft drinks self serve  lunch ordered House Salad Tom Yum Soup Basil Chicken  The salad right size portion ginger vinaigrette served side  Non food any heat  would prefer kitchen add heat based request heat level 1 thru X  Although table allows add selected sauces difficult gauge level heat  soup plenty shrimp  would prefer larger pieces more pieces basil Basil Chicken  <EOR> Block 9 legitimately good Thai food   say street but just say good portioned tasty   spicy very easy palate   spinach salad red curry drunken noodle   spinach salad more tempura traditional salad   dipping sauce phenomenal little kick Thai peanuts dressing   spinach fine but appetizer sure   red curry your normal Thai chili taste   Some kick if bit into pepper but other just good portioned dish   did come bamboo which seemed interesting curry dish   Finally notorious drunken noodle even Nittaya known for   dish humongous   Easily feed dinner lunch next day   Nittaya's dish isn't most exciting terms ingredients but noodles chewy sauce sticky   Spice level very mild though asked extra hot but still very nice dish   Add some house pepper sauce if need heat   Block 9 nice location right off 215 Town Center   Easy take nice area sit down back patio area some good beer $4 less if eat in   Overall very happy meal excited Nittaya available affordable price   back  <EOR> Stopped try some street style Thai place did disappoint  chicken Thai basil beef jerky  Tried sample friends Panang curry  All all food good favorite Thai locations town but much much quicker service  30 minutes  bad live across town I'd come often  <EOR> Great new casual Thai spot option  Pretty prompt service staff very friendly  all favorites menu excluding garlic edamame   same owner Nittaya's Secret Kitchen always impressed high quality recipes  place lot more casual first restaurant  Plastic utensils kind place but think goal!
