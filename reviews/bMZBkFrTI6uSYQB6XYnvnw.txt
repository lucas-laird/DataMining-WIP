Especially if you're steak lover me! While also chicken pork lamb favorite cuts all beef! Filet mignon? Yes! Picahna? 2 slices please! course ultimate favorite beef ribs!   For 50 bucks person unlimited salad bar meats sides bread  definitely best steak places around just relative value but meat quality really top notch juicy flavorful! always look forward coming handful times year!

Excellent service great personality   Food choices delicious salad bar great addition vegetarian team members   definitely back again! <EOR> One word   Horrible! Flamingo location instead  unfortunate very first review negative one  came first time family celebrate new job  Service great! bill came $274 70 tipped $60 cash around 20%   couple days when received bank statement  added $93 74 tip amount which total ended being $368 44  know gave cash tip glad took receipt copy case anything happened  called Fogo de Chao explain situation said they'd refund tip amount  Nothing happened over week decided drive there  manager came the same talked phone over week ago talk back office 10 minutes  long 10 minutes but server offered drink waiting which politely declined  manager came back explained person manages finances vacation would refund asap  wasn't expecting anything them but didn't even offer anything all except apology wasn't didn't seem sincere  glad looked statement because if would let them away extra tip wasn't deserved  bad can't post attachment receipt statement show proof  just hope staff managers aren't ripping other guests off adding own gratuity  <EOR> Roommate love Brazilian Steakhouses Texas de Brazil usually place to  Today decided try Fogo de Chao since side town  lunch upon entering already given look host  Apparently don't look rich enough eat because server also gave look rolled eyes when asked dessert it's included Texas de Brazil curious if if should save room still buy one  She never did bring dessert menu  Also server disappeared forever she never brought mashed potatoes come meal  2nd round meat just asked some else it  Additionally soft drinks non refillable  charged $4 8oz bottle Diet Coke never offered another  would happily purchased another bottle if server come back   As far meat itself received very fatty piece some bacon wrapped garlic steak  Didn't eat it  asked bacon wrapped chicken never came  guess ready go   I did however enjoy ribeye  butternut squash coconut soup very good   Market table mediocre best comparison Texas de Brazil  rice literally tasted texture Uncle Ben's ready rice microwaveable version  Beans no flavor   All all just drive extra 15 minutes Texas de Brazil Town Square much better experience  <EOR> Just finished dinner fabulous  All aspects surpassed groups expectation  expected meats perfectly cooked  staff extremely attentive  explained processes helped food just liked  market food bar delight  great time  <EOR> $40 summer special per person  meat delicious ambiance very nice  waiters very attentive    Though bit attentive  Every would stop table ask if ok  coasters flip green side if want more food way much attention kept getting interrupted  would only complaint  <EOR> Went today chance  downtown Summerlin farmers market  hungry afterwards wanted some lunch  husband excellent service  food fantastic  great time  Would again heart beat! <EOR> I location last night roommate time around experience best      We searched google see time place closed said 10pm   left house around 9pm arrived around 9 15pm  We dont being type people show place 2 minutes before close    I felt sufficient amount time dine without feeling holding staff hostage going home   am server know feels like    Diego server very nice performed spiel expected   He did ask liked meat cooked liked medium rare roommate liked medium compromised said medium rare plus    We theee parties rhe restauraunt being party 8 other party 4 5 then party 2   As soon flipped service cards green felt attacking cuts extra well done meat sitting heat furnace awhile because weren't many people restauraunt    Once filled side plate capacity less 3 minutes flip service card over green red stop meat overload   Now some people may think great service but felt rushed didnt even give time let flavors meat marinate mouths     The Gaucho kept circling around table meat hand if he vulture waiting its prey   made feel kind uncomfortable because sent message needed hurry because closing soon didnt want minute past 10   When flipped service card back green attack meats began again point where could even distinguish different types plates   flipped back red he kept bringing more wanted hurry up!  I didn't complain because did want enforce stereotype black people complain everything don't tip   server attest serverism servers discriminating assuming certain ethic groups dont tip nor any type class   I did mention tactful way Diego meat little overcooked  he did offer re prepare whatever meats wanted temperature requested  thats only reason why am giving two stars   Despite rushed service overcooked meat still left $28 tip 23% when really wanted tip 15 18 percent but still trying fight stereotypes black people don't tip correctly    I probably wont come again just riding last experience despite coming birthday few months ago when restauraunt packed   service should felt rushed especially when werent even closed yet  <EOR> Poor service  server disappeared waited check  almost closing time workers started eating leftovers  enough choices taste salad bar  server described meats served but barely saw lamb ribs  <EOR> Absolutely amazing! Visited Fogo two separate occasions within past two weeks completely blown away meat selection huge fresh salad bar fantastic service  Other Brazilian steakhouses town good but place awesome  <EOR> Fogo de Chao excellent  Service wonderful  Food awesome  little pricey  Lunch two tip appx  $90 00 <EOR> All you can eat delicious cuts meat perfect medium rare temperature served sliced right front you  tastebud tummy very happy  place located very beautiful downtown summerlin shopping area  quality meats very good spiced perfectly  service very good especially waiter Minh  very attentive polite    Only complaint I'd say selection food salad bar  truly did care much salads cheeses     which since love both  But amazing tres leches dessert end might made little  <EOR> I eaten several Brazilian Steak Houses past  When walking establishment first impression good decor  food reasonable but service way off base start finish  Example    Given crappy table when other good tables available place 40 precent full when arrived  should called em it   It took 30 40 mins someone ask drink ? ask drinks   A full drink menu supplied  Only expensive cocktail's  wanted beer but verbal process   After ordering drinks 20 25 mins nothing  Again ask where drinks were  Remember place busy   Drinks came when 70 percent thru meal !!!  I ask desert menu  least 50 percent items available !!! ordered three times each items became unavailable   We didn't dedicated server  Just random people filling drinks desert order   The staff appeared unrefined although guys serving meat appeared act together   400 dollar bill tip felt could gotten better service McDonald's  When left bemused  recommended return  <EOR> Nothing better ever rotating selection meat giant skewers! market table well stocked kept tidy  Everything tasted great servers all super attentive  Minh especially helpful made experience even better  location beautiful opinion better Flamingo one  definitely recommend come back  <EOR> This Fogo De Chao located Downtown Summerlin actually right next Public School 702   We came last night some awesome friends celebrate birthday  loved experience Flamingo location much wanted share experience them special occasion   It alright  definitely nearly good experience Flamingo location back April but wasn't terrible either  + came special promotion  $30 lunch $40 dinner would All eat salad bar plus all eat 8 select meats plus 1 choice desert  WELL worth price only runs through rest August  + Highlights food wise was bacon salad bar damn damn damn! caesar salad also salad bar flank steak sirloin steak  bacon wrapped chicken certainly gets honorable mention well  + addition dessert nice touch  choice between NY cheesecake chocolate cake tres leches cake  Portion generous chocolate cake scrumptious!

don't know if want risk it  <EOR> I made reservation husband's birthday through website but when called ask if come 10 minutes later said no record reservation  wasn't problem walk however  fairly new location maybe they're still working some kinks    Before going into detail let say meal tasty husband enjoyed steak  daughter loved she never experienced type restaurant before allowed order desert husband's birthday  fish portion smaller side especially considering $42  salad bar just ok  soup great but did sick before even leaving restaurant  Sorry TMI but keeping real   maybe cream something stomach couldn't handle soup  tasted good going down did fish but again tummy happy  bathroom really nice thank god  Very clean well kept  fair eat clean typically don't eat rich foods  husband said meat good    My husband full experience since he's more steak eater am opted Sea bass only  Based website thought getting shrimp cocktail included but  extra  6 year old free bonus  However some servers did offer any meat  husband shared his  Maybe  mean free  thought they'd serving her  did ask servers share lamb chops since favorite  He obliged but ask  worked ok since husband allowed taste other items but thought might offer place meat plate  sure she's better eater most 6 year olds perhaps didn't think she wanted any ??   The manager nice enough tell try some meat if would sure he noticed scarfed down fish much faster husband could finish experience  declined full but thought nice gesture  still handling only 2 other tables sure hope don't waste all meat leftover when restaurant empty  Perhaps  why he encouraged try some    On Tuesday night last week fairly empty  arrived around 5 30 other table but left shortly after  Two other tables seated towards end meal really wasn't much atmosphere other servers all within sight seemed very friendly    I hoping love could back Easter but think I'd prefer full sit down meal  service very good food fine just wasn't blown away  style steak house before knew expect but thought I'd more impressed salad bar fish  Again steak joint maybe shouldn't review them fish but really review overall experience did full feedback husband steak faired against other steak house  might try again if husband requested but don't think place I'd crave  <EOR> From first greeting through walking door top notch service!!  food well above other Brazilian places outstanding quality   back! <EOR> Minh Caroline entire team provided exceptional service myself entire party  food expected phenomenal    But service entire wait staff true winner restaurant  Thank another perfect experience  <EOR> I kind bummed Texas de Brazil booked Father's Day but food staff Fogo made forget all it  Food amazing server Samson best run to  Samson made Father's Day boys great experience  Thank you!!! <EOR> Great $40 summertime deal going right now  Food flavorful  service great!
