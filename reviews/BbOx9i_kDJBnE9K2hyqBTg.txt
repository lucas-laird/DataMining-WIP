Being Hawaii now living OC sure Hawaiian food fix when visiting Vegas  came pretty close!  The Customer Service 5 5 The lady behind counter very polite friendly  She took order addressed name each time  She made sure taken care through time wait there  She offered various sauces try meal   going above beyond!  The Food 4 5 Here's ordered    Meat Jun little bland liking  meat lightly seasoned egg tasted well egg unseasoned perhaps?   Unlike most places Hawaii where taste meat jun little sweeter side fell short  However did pour extra meat jun sauce all over liking  offer two types meat jun sauces original spicy  liked both  Mochiko Chicken just home! no complaints one  Highly recommend! Shoyu Poke melt your mouth goodness! Pretty close home but something lacking  Maybe shoyu used someone previously mentioned  Also price   $18 99 lb  little high side  But hey can't good OC! Chantilly Cake don't forget dessert! Can't seem find Hawaiian chantilly anywhere mainland  Kinda wish more chantilly frosting but probably jus fat kid talking    The Restaurant 4 5 Clean! don't walk away smelling restaurant unlike most Hawaiian Chinese restaurants  lot seating also  Kinda wish outdoor seating those sitting outside  Also ample parking! However parking stall right front store reserved manager only  Almost parked stall until noticed sign  would recommend reserving ALL stalls fronting store your customers   See next time town! <EOR> Love Shoyu Poke fish fresh  Love BBQ Chicken chicken very tender  <EOR> My sister recommended spot because she knows much love miss Hawaiian food  First off place clean new places clean!
