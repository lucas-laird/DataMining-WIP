I underwhelmed joint front house no appeal all just t v's tables no art work no posted Menu walls  When walk order there's 6 covered warmers your left wondering what's underneath initially ordered 2 piece combo which came 1 rib boneless skinless chicken breast which 2 bucks extra? ahead ordered 3 piece combo which added 1 additional  rib all combinations 2 sides ONLY sides greens believe 1 piece Cornbread considered side Every rib joint nation offers Cornbread house unless order extra !! enjoyed food better when Parking lot near downtown  felt food Overpriced ordered usually never write reviews but really hope place gets Better!! way wtf  Sweet Potato Mash?? Instead traditional Yams?????? Below $14 gets you <EOR> Well saw signs BBQ originally headed Chinese food decided check out  No signs inside typical printed menu over half items available items didn't look hoped  Still hot link chicken i think? Greens potato salad green beans stare down ask guy just some sauce when you're handing meat dryer side think should slap there! Food service appeal place gets 3  sauce isn't bad hard mess hot link  made you      Chicken overcooked greens EXTREMELY SALTY while string beans FLAVORLESS! Maybe half salt greens other half green beans  should've known better potato salad made mayo miracle whip      just saying Smith's right next door reason  <EOR> I just say wife place first time amazed flavor ribs tenderness meat good full flavor couldn't believe it!!
