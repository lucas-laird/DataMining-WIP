recent visit couple months ago couple years ago food delicious servers I'd give effort because trying really really hard   My last visit though unfortunately last  normal weekday dining around 3pm because happy hour starting where 20% off menu items  bad idea    Everything fine until hit 4pm Beer Pong game started music blasted all around which giving headache  owner participating BP game server denied turning down music when asked    When asked check server came clean noticed left good portion behind she asked tried being polite saying started tasting weird  when she responded oh girl  because let sit long     lmao girl maybe food just tastes weird   It started become ratchetly inappropriate when participants BP table started grind booty tapping beginning to   I done lol asked check friends didn't even tip tipped $1 94 $30 bill pretty bad    Funny moment though seeing participants grind booty tapped she back house grab baby baby basket       Least food orders right lol    <EOR> There saying taking time smell roses  true your food well  searching funky off putting scent but instead taking time enjoy   The herbal chicken ramen those dishes slowly savoring beneficial  presentation magnificent  covered food approaches table  Once placed down lid removed cloud fragrant aromas drifts up  fan medicinal soups characteristics similar Chinese version but milder  does strong flavors ginseng tree bark roots  Instead slightly sweet light thanks dried goji berries longans    With all arguments casual enjoyments aside should eaten cautious pace since broth served temperature over 100 degrees  noodles chewy cooked al dente texture  pieces chicken plentiful moist  hard boiled egg cooked medium cut half laying soup  center bright yellow runny  When dunked into broth cooks yolk little more thickens soup    Pairing healthy soup unsweetened golden ice tea made lunch does leave body feeling weighed down heavy  brewed beverage served Voss bottle comes three servings goblet  chilled goblet nonetheless  $11 reasonable meal upset stomach wallet  <EOR> Today 3rd time 28GO   meaning write review weeks ago but behind Yelping   Right away must recommend everyone try Golden Tea unique delicious healthy   nutty sweet if try won't miss having sugary soft drink   food highly recommend any Ramen dishes   Miso Mazin Herbal Chicken both excellent     The

dishes all 5 star   Herbal Chicken brought back long forgotten memories soup grandmother used make   dish unique balance sweet savory almost predominantly sweet but good way   If you're used flavor may much me     If order any Ramen dishes don't order any other food dishes unless you're extremely hungry dining someone else   lot food   I tried tapas dishes Belly Rice   definitely wasn't tapas sized lot food uniquely tasty flavor combination   ordered Miso Mazin Ramen together forced gorge myself discomfort because raised let food waste     I recommend 28GO   ***** Best music ever experienced restaurant  <EOR> I came several co workers hoping fun lunch  While decor unique interesting felt black bit overdone  also seems designed own chairs really uncomfortable when sit back  some kind triangular design back kept digging into lower back  forced sit edge seat  Other interior decor service prompt friendly  But wasn't anyone else time   Each different ramen noodle soup order waffle korean beef edamame sliders   The edamame awesome  Super garlicky some good dipping sauce  ramen unfortunately didn't live expectations  sesame tonkatsu broth felt way thick wasn't hot all  Maybe room temperature  noodles bit warmer but much  couldn't finish ramen because thick wasn't appetizing because wasn't hot  other co workers agreed ramen wasn't hot either  waffles okay but something would order  didn't try sliders but said just alright   I hope best establishment but place would return to  <EOR> Robots ramen   In mind little else needed satisfying food experience but coming get   I vibe place   Subdued muted colors decent unobtrusive music   Oh yes whole robot thing   some great illustrations mechs robots adorn walls all while some Ultraman movie playing monitor   secretly love before ordered   But food no slouch either   ordered beef ramen served HUGE artsy bowl full savory noodles chunks meat pieces egg   every bite quite satisfying ate until quite full   The
