Had free afternoon came grab some lunch  totally spaced fact Groupon expired  Right off bat greeted super cool letting use expired Groupon some places sort leery using value price paid which actual Groupon policy   also discount students! asked instead prompting them question  also asked if wanted cup water  just really love places offer awesome things unprompted    I decided Complicated Order without aioli  such serious sandwich  could barely take bite! ciabatta bread fresh warm turkey great paired bacon jam  really dug bacon jam generously piled super sweet some bacon jams tend be  Rounded crisp cucumbers lettuce great sandwich    Now am write entire paragraph lettuce  only recently learned hate lettuce sandwiches  All sandwiches seem soggy piece iceberg lettuce wilts when touches warm sandwich  lettuce just bunch bulky filler offers no flavor  Don't wrong am obsessed salads love certain types lettuce  But really iceberg  gross maybe only serves someone feel better eating burger something  But sandwich mixed greens greens dressed vinaigrette! works! first time happy actually eat lettuce sandwich    I plan coming back again try some other items  Maybe something opposite direction vegan ordered  <EOR> After mentally bookmarking place several months pains say rather disappointed making trek over today  We promptly happily greeted staff upon entering  must've obvious first time I'm sure long pondering period questioning glances each other something it graciously extended help choosing order which appreciated   Complicated Order boyfriend chose Guac Mole  also ordered 16oz cantaloupe chia seed juice Ghirardelli mocha  brought beverages first immediately questioned why cantaloupe juice huge 24oz  didn't order size  unknowingly charged size? Did run 16oz? knows  already paid  tipped matter  little embarrassing squabble over fact   Over 10 minutes later sandwiches brought us  Seems little long put two sandwiches together but maybe  just me  Even more annoying once food set down repeated both boyfriend server realized they'd gotten boyfriend's order wrong  sandwich yanked away left share own both ravenous wait any longer  time sandwich corrected brought some 10 additional minutes later he'd already finished other half own  given simple Sorry wait  No compensatory anything given retribution putting damper lunch  Mind $40 later  Not good first impression left  peeves most entire experience fact tipped people 20% prior even receiving food  Completely undeserved  Nobody's fault but own but definitely learning experience going forward   We're no vegans vegetarians but still appreciated high quality food received  just wasn't good enough way coming back here  <EOR> Soooooo good!
