Great healthy alternative burger joints when want some late night munchies   The inside very spacious clean even outdoor patio  Very nice!! <EOR> This subway horrible!!!

I've come many times close love drive thru component   experiences NEVER good     I've 2 sandwiches made incorrectly   first time over month ago ordered turkey bacon flatbread chicken bacon   girl very kind when remade sandwich     Today different story   ordered 6 turkey bacon avocado white flatbread cheese lettuce onion banana peppers pickles olives ranch    start off girl took order drive thru didn't ask step step she took whole orders  then moved window she told white flatbread asked if wanted wheat which said fine   rung man because interaction girl took order wanted check it   Immediately knew wrong   spinach tomatoes green pepper mustard   top off white flatbread which told didn't have     I inside told them this   female lot tattoos ears gauged   She wasn't concerned incorrectly made sandwich bit   man working tell remake mine first   She began making wheat flatbread said white since made other sandwich white?    She said all    Meanwhile guy working bag frozen white flatbread me   She CONTINUED putting wheat even though he going heat white me   Unbelievable   He told give footlong inconvenience which appreciated   She then made sandwich left     I am appalled someone working organization this   Being food beverage manager even if worked Subway type behavior level customer service unacceptable     She looked she completely miserable   If she's going customer service she should definitely back house attitude   name receipt Juliette     I don't know if location understaffed if need more extensive training but inconsistency service quality very noticeable turn away business including mine  <EOR> Driver through? Awesome but check your sandwich first before take off  Because didn't simply because stupid enough trust person confirms Italian herbs bread toasted extra cheese instead cold sandwich white bread no extra cheese! Subways dime dozen location none existent me! Bye! <EOR> Such friendly staff! Fresh bread fresh ingredients  usually meatball sub white bread extra provolone  delish! <EOR> It's 24 hours   drive thru   if feel being less healthy shares space donut shop   Other pretty standard Subway  <EOR> Wasn't busy through drive through dog me  Super awkward window attendant  Ordered six inch tuna wheat  She asked vegetables told all vegetables except jalapeños banana peppers she then just jalapeños banana peppers want any other vegetables   politely said no jalapeños banana peppers but all other vegetables fine  She says oh alright anyways sandwich both jalapeños banana peppers it  Truly doesn't mater pick them off but awkward weird experience  If ever come back location again point inside watch gets put sandwich  <EOR> Subway subway  You've you've them all   I cheese sandwich although offer tons toppings hate charge extra cheese when only use 2 slices cheese sandwich  Oh well  Still pretty tasty though! <EOR> For all negative comments   must never met Brianna  Such cute girl damn she sandwich!! She very personable down earth tell she isn't forcing conversation  hesitant should order she answered all questions remained patient me  Truly angel  lobby also kept very clean food fresh  share store donut shop there's also delightful smell donuts  never another Subway again  Subway Brianna BEST!!!!! <EOR> Yes fuzz MOLD  Hairy mold grew tuna sandwich 24 hours  ate half 6 supposed day two's lunch  little irritated disgusted hungry! <EOR> Most ridiculous Subway to   first all run drive thru which isn't proper sandwich shop  drive thru worker two which during lunch when more likely busy poor managing assists line outside rather customer inside  Very poor customer service  Then Italian BMT which special 3 dollars comes salami pepperoni ham  eat ham turkey substituted many times many different Subway shops  individual says can't that  Can't throw two pieces turkey sub place ham because pay more turkey  understand that   but much more pay? $30? $40? $100?? minuscule customer happy save  30 cents absurd  never come dump again  <EOR> I know lot people complain slow service here   understand experienced myself 4 22 18  late evening  person working inside bunch people walked just pulled up   top off drive thru speaker wasn't working well   tired cranky just wanted food     How earth could experience rate four stars?  The turnaround came form great customer service young man named Martel   He kept calm handled business pro   ordered meatballs he wasn't sure package them   He only did expert job packaging them he considerately made sure requested cheese propely melted well   He took painstaking care ensure husband's sandwich made correctly   really turned trip around  <EOR> My sandwich pretty good but could better  But when came bottle apple juice found unexpected item  When called let them know all check rest   no Thank nor Sorry hear no Bring back nothing  careful  <EOR> Getting off vacation review kick back some LV reviews!  Even better first review me!  I know most Subway time another many 'Yay!' some 'Blah '  But Subway part town fav place pick Subway sub!  pretty new maybe year old sub shop connected Winchell's Donut   Pretty good way cancelling benefits eating healthy eh Subway?  sub all veggie fixins' chase order glazed donut holes?  Meal champions tell you!    This fav Subway mainly because ingredients always super fresh looking whenever there   assistant manager met I refer guys 'Ass  Man ' ha ha said he tries run pretty tight ship because other Subways he's don't  live company's high standards   efforts must paying off because he mentioned particular Subway consistently getting most sales SW part town past several months    saying lot because Subway almost every block go   See kids high quality always leads high profits!  Don't skimp your standards   Back sandwiches   ingredients see always fresh nothing ever looks old   tomatoes aren't soggy lettuce isn't wilted red onions aren't stinky slimy   Subway even serves spinach!  Rare find town most Subways don't veggie menu   never let down any sandwiches gotten leave pretty satisfied   bread fresh fluffy not flattened see some Subways meats don't look they've sitting all day     Personally love Subway $5 foot long menu   work lot happy knowing cheap healthy meal afterwards   fav sandwiches Oven Roasted Chicken Breast ALL veggies provolone extra lettuce tomatoes banana peppers light mayo spicy mustard salt pepper   Another favs Spicy Italian   also Meatball Marinara provolone tomatoes spinach bell peppers banana peppers   good toasted!  Lately Orchard Chicken Salad sandwich kick ahem   not toasted ick apples golden raisins it   $5 foot long   with chips 2 cookies drink under $8?  use sandwich 2 meals unless super hungry!  share fiance   which means remove double order red onions sigh    give cookies   Fine fine   Oatmeal Raisin but Chocolate Chip mine!  Another few reasons love Subway?  service cleanliness   staff always pleasant never complain when trying pack over stuffed sandwich they known super heavy because veggie obsession into bag   place usually pretty clean bathroom kept floors always mopped   if find dirty area let them know someone it     One coolest things Subway?  open 24 hours day!  First area now if late night craving sub drive down 2 morning if want I sometimes those long Halo 3 filled nights    heard Subway and subsequently Winchell's open 24 hours because big part clientele nurses doctors work St  Rose hospital almost literally right next door   fact hospital large chunk revenue   Subway also easy drive thru   Yep Subway drive thru!  Don't even car Subway fix   Hey doc heart surgery 5 minutes?  No problem!  Just don't forget wash your hands eat  <EOR> First time location traumatizing yelp review  don't know name but girl Monday morning made sandwich if earth quake happening  first she cut bread wrong having incredibly difficult time putting meat on  Eventually she started over  when asked avocado she cut 3 tiny slivers didn't even spread out  hurt watch down  sure if first day if she just hated job but literally never seen uglier sandwich told that  jealous other customers because younger guy literally sandwich artist nice neat  She couldn't even wrap damn thing  point really considered walking but hungry bought it  Fire girl put donut shop  don't understand bad your job ITS YOUR JOB lol <EOR> First Subway shares space Winchell's   If you're dining serve your sandwich basket    Different   Nice place late night snack  <EOR> This evening took family subway located Warm Springs between Durango Buffalo  ordered cheese pizza kid 6 veggie meal wife 12 veggie meal myself  noticed cheeses veggies looked subpar but decided order against best judgement since already there  While filling drinks daughter complaining pizza being cold  litterally still icy  walked reheated only employee    3rd shift ever walked off quickly finish whatever tasks she attending to  saw enter freezer room second attempt call over again she doesn't hear me  She clearly dodging while fumbling trash whatever else  third louder excuse she walked over reluctantly  told pizza cold  She literally grabbed box dirty gloves only realized sanitation error when called potentially risking kids health   immediately asked refund witnessing major health hazard  pizza 3yr old daughter point wasn't confident eating ordered    just cause  denied refund even though only food consumed bite cold pizza    which way ruined any chance eating dinner tonight  paid cash but claimed couldn't open drawer refund me  Then offered buy drink cookie droor open  denied again woman named Savanna via phone  extremely frustrating gross experience left unfed family partial refund  can't believe expected eat food witnessing unsanitary process  wrong but penalized somehow  Why location allowing employee 3 days experience run entire restaurant? She clearly doesn't understand basic health department protocol  No respect! Terrible service! UNSANITARY!!! <EOR> Service terribly poor reflect manager  assigned place  Customer service training needed your staff   Server give cup water since non  asked cup soda use but still refuses give one  ever manager  Wake up   <EOR> There ant crawling across counter when checked out   I informed server allergy milk which includes cheese watched server picked cheese steak proceeded scoop contaminated steak onto sandwich  also used visibly dirty knife cut sandwich boyfriend's wrap  watched another employee clean same knife next customer wiping paper towel   cross contamination people really severe allergies could kill seriously harm them  lobby dirty unkempt possibly explaining why ant would checkout counter  told server inform manager bug  Hopefully take care that  <EOR> I see lot negative reviews little nervous come but say great experience  Idk if because no else but wait wasn't long all drive thru  Mine bf's sandwich came good   the bread fresh   I would definitely come back  girl took order sweet too! <EOR> ++ Decided place couldn't failure all time right? Drive drive thru told someone soon  left 5mins radio silence  Smh  10am car parking lot no other cars drive thru ???????  Love Subway quick meal frequent Warm Springs Buffalo location because drive thru   Half time wrong    order taker almost always rude   Okay whatever because excited sound taking sandwich orders all day?  But when you're paying deluxe sandwiches expect some effort   take your full order front feel don't even write down off memory   Which why sandwiches come wrong because forget items things head instead clarifying order  Ordered vinegar but mayo Ordered american cheese but NO cheese Ordered extra olives but only 5 pieces if any   seriously???   You can't expect customers open sandwich drive thru check order before driving off out courtesy those behind line waited long just have    So just leave review take business elsewhere next time  <EOR> Let begin saying always loved subway  first job kid working subway  being said customer service location terrible! through drive thru around 1130 pm sign dark lit up  sat 5 10 minutes no voice acknowledge am there  finally say hello open? am then met smart ass sarcastic voice tell young boy says customer want?! if am bothering kid! say im sorry bother you  Then he begins rant being rude asking if theyre open! didnt even entertain argue simply drove off  Im noticing days type attitude generation common  never back establishment  Which sad because also doughnut place attached  <EOR> HEALTH CONCERN**  Terrible drive thru service! Sitting nearly 10 minutes without anyone even acknowledging me  Upon pulling window noticed kid making sandwich open acne sores covering entire face ! against health regulations mention just disgusting  <EOR> Horrible   What's point drive thru if no working drive thru   Waited forever   need people front part drive thru  whole drive thru pointless   Never coming back one <EOR> I am absolutely appalled  Today September 15 6 20pm  over 100 reviews may first second star review  through drive thru ordered foot long tuna sandwich combo  girl took order asked if wanted extra meat fifty cents said no regular fine  However when said didn't know if didn't say yes extra meat would no meat  call stealing  employees advised management just whatever reason  If looking see Subway near buy sandwich location pops next closest location  if want served employees obviously hurry no meat sandwich sloppily put together overall demeanor staff rushing customers Subway meets all criteria  <EOR> Worst Subway ever to  young lady taking order extremely rude mentioned twice she didn't time order because she other customers ! using drive thru option  ordered 3 sandwiches bread all 3 stale dry  even add own mayo when home because two small spots she included sandwich did cover nearly amount 6 sub sand which dry eat without it  passing open dumpster uncovered way turn off  going location again  <EOR> Would give zero if could   Every time come two people working takes absolutely forever order your food if line least two people just leave   never try location again   Sad live  5 min away   Obviously restaurants forgot manage business treat customers   If wanted wait 30 min would sit down restaurant  <EOR>
