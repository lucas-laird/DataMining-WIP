Legit  am completely obsessed place   mind completely boggled place only couple stars! <EOR> The worst  Don't order Don't touch  Don't try  The worst everything consumer service know pizza <EOR> The only reason gave 2 starts instead 1 because pasta amazing  Customer service could use little work   Ordered GrubHub when arrived rudely handed food without word just left  Rather odd   I ordered fried shrimp jalapeo poppers cheesecake  Total including delivery tip $27 don't think worth it  Barely shrimp cheesecake delivered frozen solid  Jalapeo poppers delicious though seemed something could SAMs Club fry myself  <EOR> The food great customer service much  Turkey burger delicious but ordered chili cheese fries received regular fries  When called chili cheese fries told I'd pay extra delivery fee  told person phone felt unfair said wasn't anything could do  <EOR> service ok pizza very average bad late night pizza delivery  probably use them again late delivery  <EOR> I ordered lasagna  piece lasagna small drowned marinara sauce making look lot  Never ordering again  expensive such small amount  Taste okay  Nothing special  Sorry but don't think thats right  <EOR> Let's start pizza average   Better dominos but Ny real pizza  Delivery charge suppose 1 50 but charged 3 50 did tell me     Driver nice but cost pie delivery worth it   Called cashier back charge 1 00 mile first mile  <EOR> I don't understand why place such horrible reviews but definitely don't think deserved  ordered 3 lunch specials delivery  only price good but didn't forget anything  even forks extra bread nothing  takes hour deliver but  standard delivery  spaghetti lunch special  came perfect  Needed little extra sauce but no big deal  also ceasar salad lunch special  Came perfect  chicken fingers lunch special supposed come 3 strips  actually came more 3 super happy  all came drinks think steal  called well see where order lady phone super nice delivery guy nice well  <EOR> Eh  Twice price Pizza Hut good  Burned cheesy bread frozen red velvet cake  should just McDonalds delivered  <EOR> I live right around corner threw ads away months  looked reviews great terrible  avoided place thinking other local places mediocre pizza    I getting tired Pizza Hut trying new places wings  decided give them shot pickup because couple Yelp posts said good  exceeded expectations 7 99 carryout special pretty good 20 wings really crispy great sauce Garlic knots full eat them  I again tonight big 26 pizza  Boy kids freaked say really good!

<EOR> My husband ordered regularly I hate admit   food inconsistent sometimes great sometimes wrong sometimes burnt  delivery driver young man great friendly social want order again however tall 30 40 year old man delivers them well  He always talking cell phone listening ear plugs when he comes door  He does say anything he just shoves food door walks away  He delivered today peeked head side window 5 seconds ringing doorbell heading toward door  He again did say anything  NEVER order again  unacceptable behavior  mention Philly Steak Sandwich burnt bun which ruined sandwich  ignored low ratings awhile since experienced some good things company but behavior today going happen  Save your money enjoy your privacy order somewhere else! <EOR> I used eat least weekly last year  Lately they're slipping fast  Every time call place order new counter girl answering phone having hard time understanding order getting right  last two times all In last week they've messed major twice  first time ordered two chicken parm suns picked drove home find two chicken philly subs nothing ordered  Drove back explained mistake though he says ticket stated philly said well phone ordered Parms your counter girl entered philly  Regardless hard time wait correct order  correct order actually good tasted great give them hat    Next order ordered philly cheese steak steak cheese only pick loaded mayo veggies etc  return state plain steak cheese steak sub plain NO cheese ! damn dry hard choke down  Again some barrier  preventing them getting orders right    On good note white pizza very good  always hot miss here <EOR> I placed order delivery  First off took over hour time placed delivered  $44 00 order when shows 2 dinners ordered  called them back tell them didn't receive order  He asks ordered then says oh yeah  didn't put oven  said well  nice going fix this? response  he new made sent me  He gave time frame 15 mins  right already going almost 30 mins  When asked speak manager young guy said he manager  said  sad cause your customer service horrible  He then again repeated he would meal when done  just hung since could see obviously going no where  <EOR> Don't order through app  always wrong  Great food when right  ONLY call if want takeout  Disappointed ruined 3 meals reading notes own app sending wrong things  <EOR> We came getting flyer front door  pleasantly surprised see wide assortment menu  incredible!

Thank Italian Brothers job well done!!!! <EOR> Still no personality stopped ordered waited over hour pizza fingers! Plus fingers didn't taste good used to  <EOR> Confusion flavors think place    I ordered meatball jalapeno pizza chicken wings italian soda 2 desserts 1 apple brownie  The Pizza done perfectly taste tell dough home made house made  tear texture crust just tell I liked sauce everything maybe could use dash salt pepper somewhere just lacking little it    The chicken wings  good cooked threw good taste    Know where confusion sets    think dessert's might store bought ? partly store bought    The apple pie frozen leads think box    The brownie hard eat cooked all  choc chips brownie where rock hard cooked melted    The Italian Sodas  ice melted into drink something lacking flavor it  Traditional Italian Sodas sugar something kick it  where Really Really bland when 2 liter coke cola looses its carbonation flavor it    I would recommend cutting your dessert menu half making items house  choose 5 your best sellers don't always over load dessert menu  Choose taste quanity <EOR> I food but wish delivery driver would remembered 2 liter soda lol  But still love wings pizza <EOR>
