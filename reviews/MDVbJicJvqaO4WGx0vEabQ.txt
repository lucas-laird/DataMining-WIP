Damnit can't even try eat healthy here  <EOR> Don't it! somewhere else!!!!! daughter hair quesadilla chicken crispers tasted fish even fries old  offer nothing right only took quesadilla off bill  <EOR> We came Chicken Fajitas night when couldn't figure eat wanted stay Strip didn't want spend $100's   waitress very friendly quick   Food your basic Chili's    guess more happy hour drink spot but is  <EOR> We back Chili's third time Ribeye Steak special mashed potatoes   Awesome!!!

Only negative feedback would say restaurant hard locate being second level  <EOR> I really thrilled place  new remodeling looked nice  Food typical chain restaurant microwave quality  pretzel appetizer pretty bad cheese sauce par two week old sauce see 7 11  When entered no host stand  waited approximately 7 minutes before anyone even came seat us  fact almost walked out  Wait staff understaffed  Also its LVB tourist prices  <EOR> It's Chili's you've you've them all   If sit bar free chips salsa   ALSO if ask full calorie menu see all items corresponding calories  If trying eat healthy   also skinny girl margaritas 100 calories each  <EOR> Ordered take last week  food looked thrown together  take most people wont back they've left but still looked thrown together whoever prepared meals didn't care finished product looked like  eat chili's lot but never ordered take here  portions looked smaller if dined ordered it  won't ordering take again but dining still  love chili's obviously food but don't expect best service when ordering take out  <EOR> Service great food awful just switched infrared ovens if liked old fried food bad  Stay away shrimp tacos yuck! <EOR> Chilis always just Chilis no matter try spin it  food okay fills your need some grub but never leaves saying oh goodness just cant wait come back sit under gigantic Chili      Really stars am plopping down all because service great  waiter top strawberry lemonade waters table always keeps happy when drink full  received side Honey mustard did ask bill    I wish more say some extravagant suspenseful story tell but well     only thing spicy review pepper fries  <EOR> ok hostess first person greet huh??  nope   she behind scenes doing whatever first 4 minutes standing there   then she asked many said she would right back   10 minutes later she comes back growing crowd people   takes names not ours but then escorts seats   waiters really good but almost left   plenty other places  <EOR> Worst service!!! husband 2 hours all soup salad    yes all  Couldn't refill drinks couldn't soup either  But half hour soup delivered she said oh let grab your salad  point no need  am pretty sure waitress named Tia  Avoid section service sucks does attitude  <EOR> Wow really familliar Chilis  two $20 special  Sat bar service average  food wonderful  Some best combination fajitas ever eaten  additional $2 fajitas combination chicken steak  Very worth it  Great food  <EOR> After spending day Strip wife wanted eat dinner Chili's because food while simple consistent know you're getting  Unfortunately service Chili's location very poor  took over 1 2 hour 2 appetizers sent over 20 minutes desert  slow Tuesday night!  just unacceptable  We're disappointed Chili's would allow standards low accept type service locations  won't back location ever we'll re think view Chili's safe decision good meal  <EOR> EFF location! Gawd    Burger King better waiters location  saying something because Burger King doesn't waiters    I've specific location 10 times freakin' loathe it  sister asks Rachel against Chili's? nothing against Chili's just Chili's along off Eastern Henderson vein pop forehead rage  service horrific  Seriously what's helper bs Chili's started? ridiculous because neither waiter asks if need anything just assume other covered receive no service rather twice service    I today 2 13 11 lunch sister cousin  waitress Ashlie helper never introduced herself checked black pregnant lady good first  always order unlimited soup salad every time ask salad come chips because never eat chips comes chips empty  Without fail waiters NEVER given salad along chips except today  Wow  Amazing! Jesus must coming back soon something because NEVER happens    Well guess Jesus sent rain check second coming because service downhill  waitress ignored entire time  She'd ask other tables if needed anything but would breeze past table clearly avoiding us  Did want drinks refresh palates? Well SOL because Ashlie dang sure going more drinks  She took sister's cup refill never brought back let alone came back table sister rest meal without drink  never able flag down waitress helper remedy situation    While eating some waitress complaining messy Chili's asked sister move chair next she could sweep under it  Ummmm    we're eating coming back we're done eating sweep floor? Just thought    When time more obviously time because Ashlie threw down check walked off telling no hurry took 15 minutes cousin's debit card back  cousin full plate chicken crispers fries Ashlie piled bunch empty salad plates top plate full food said she going take kitchen process check  Funny  might wanted to go box but guess waitress safer assume just toss all rather ask customer wanted  She back kitchen chatted other waitresses entrance kitchen then lounging hostess podium while chatting helper server  She walked past sister threw sister side eye put pointer finger air said hold breezed past table wait another table  GEEZE just give debit card back! She plunked down walked off  sister made sure write big fat NONE tip line    I'm sick waiters thinking young customers means no tip  Actually no service means no tip  tip few bucks buck NONE real quick  EFF LOCATION!!! <EOR> Upon entering told would 15 20 minute wait even though several empty tables throughout restaurant  then offered booth bar area  questioned if would appropriate child  hostess didn't see point but since already waited decided take booth  seemed only waitress area which seemed waiting inedible  She nice enough enjoyed humor  Once orders taken food seemed again take awhile before finally able eat  waitress brought meals almost 30 minute wait then seemed disappear again leaving without drinks quite sometime  Once able refills she  kind enough bring cups  meal process took longer should probably won't frequently particular location  seemed more tourist type being front outlet malls just down street Strip  <EOR> This isn't type place usually eat  more mom pop unique dining fine dining person  However marathon Christmas shopping spree $20 meal 2 people Happy Hour!  The place packed took while food drinks arrive but no big deal  server very nice margaritas actually strong which surprised food A OK    Apparently upside down picture every Chili's but did see even did loop around restaurant  <EOR> I great experience location dining in  service fine server excellent  two kids  food good drinks awesome  However two days later attempted order over phone received worst service life  first attendant answered phone such attitude tempted ask speak someone else  asked order special received store told could order same special go  Then attendant passed phone another person immediately told could place same order just told could place  explained just told could place order she replied she could someone else take order but would tell same thing  She then hung phone  worst to go service ever received  very disappointed because just such great experience location  back  <EOR> They friendly but very clean  bar slow but counter dirty when arrived stayed way  sat booth watched staff just ignore 45 mins took dine   probably should left instead eating there  But food decent staff friendly  <EOR> The experience other night abhorrent  took *literally* 45 minutes before waiter would come table  kept having flag down hostess service she kept saying she'd waiter over over nothing  Finally he shows 45 mins later seemingly something  He very agitated anxious twitching sweating  ordered drinks  Beer glass HALF empty when brought beer room temperature  asked different never came neither did waiter ever come back  then left no choice but leave  waste time  1 hour sitting Chili's flag down service would never come  embarrassing reflection company  Never returning  <EOR> Went Superbowl Sunday treated very well  presidential margarita long island  Food yum well <EOR> So between AppleBee's TGIFridays Chili's   Chili's takes ball one   They added Margarita Meal Deal $35 which consists regular dinner 2 options but now they've added margaritas! give option upgrade presidente margarita which suggest because uh maz ing    The main reason why boyfriend love Chili's primarily texas cheese fries  combination fries cheese bacon bits jalapeños mouth salivate  entree almost always opt chicken cajun pasta   meal deal also includes strawberry cheese cake which speaks itself need say more?  All all would definitely choose Chili's over AppleBee's TGIFridays anyway  <EOR> Enjoyable filling dishes  If you're looking foods blow your socks off then you're wrong place  Good quick bite except wait bit frustrating weekend try come another day if want quick! <EOR> Waited extremely long server  Everyone just walked never even attempted approach table Then finally seen server waited even longer 2 waters kids soda Not coming back You guys SUCK  <EOR> Do drink unless its half off $$$  literally give ALL ice when let manager know she says its standard policy    ready pay $8 99  tall glass ice splash juice   If u complain might take 1 2  Off tab but remake it  She offerd add some sour juice   gave 2   Star only because food some good  <EOR> For place LV Blvd place nice even locals  service great plus food came pretty fast  few times during happy hour  10+ times nothing bad say all  also love paying table without having deal servers    Tip Tell server want let them put together you  always specials combination deals  more willing help  <EOR> When walked didn't even greeted  girl front just staring expecting say something her  did  Took 20 minutes sit down  long  But then service super slow  took forever order taken well quite while bring food  pasta okay  But mac cheese delicious  killed end night dessert  love love love eating dessert excited cookie ice cream since dinners just okay service slow  Buuuuuut cookie hard rock ice cream didn't taste good  Wouldn't choose somewhere eat  Probably won't come back unless someone else wanted go  Then would know expect suggest dessert somewhere else  <EOR> Over years noticed Chillis Bar Grill food gone downhill  changed menu rid some favorites  Service location good husband noticed employees server attentive  Although can't give food better rating ordered appetizer sirloin steak husband ordered steak shrimp fajitas taste dish  Even molten lava cake wasn't great used be  service made  bland food   <EOR>
