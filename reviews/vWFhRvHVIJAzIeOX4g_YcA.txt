My 3 teenage sons tried Tommy's tonight  liked it! patties thin don't know stay together  thankful burger without chili tasted forkful son's consistency paste  Maybe  keep burger? lol Fries meh interior small generic In n Out  <EOR> Is McDonald's? No Tommy's allegedly Famous Hamburgers  only difference between burger McDonald's burger cost twice much   I wanting try Tommy's long time  seeing billboards way LA advertising place thought sure going knock out  most lackluster burger experience thus far Vegas sure  burger felt frozen factory hockey puck best part meal giant Cherry Coke    After trying once can't say back  satisfied starving belly but long again  <EOR> Finally!  jonesing 11 month's! burger just good Ramparts Eagle Rock but fries oh fries disappointment   seems shrank bit weren't crispy thier LA counterparts   But don't wrong still devour anything Tommy's throws amazing chili on  <EOR> Just stopped best customer service  Bryan girl shift kind delivered phenomenal service  waited short while chili heat apologized gave refund  Thank much Bryan!!! Can't wait dig in  <EOR> No flavor worth price only thing tasted salt  Also took long time food   only 2 bites enough tossed it   Checked off try list gotta say pretty disappointed  <EOR> Aside those served spectacular hometown favorite All American perhaps Five Guys fan fast food burgers  No matter various burger joints try distinguish themselves selling commoditized product In regard Tommy's opts customer opt Chili fixins which accompany every burger   On 7 22 16 uninspired session video poker Sam's Town opted quick lunch Tommy's which directly across Boulder Highway adjacent Walmart Superstore  very clean brightly lit very white space  very pleasant young counterperson Brian patiently explained concept Tommy's burgers  opted Double Burger Chili standard fixins  Although burgers fresh prepared pretty quickly  thought chili tasted odd  staff brewed nice fresh cup fresh coffee which enjoyed   I would return Tommy's gaming session Sam's shopping session Walmart but would opt chili  <EOR> I love Tommy's! Yum yum yummy!  I am excited actually Tommy's Vegas now   used always first stops whenever Cali having town blessing book   nicer just drive across town instead across state lines!    I am big fan pretty much anything smothered chili cheese place nirvana me   definitely full eating combo meal   burgers big juicy messy   hot dogs huge just covered delicious goodness   fries well all really say DROOL   Everything comes chili cheese but order things without well if isn't your thing though why would want chili cheese???   On top great food staff always really friendly cheerful   nice helped someone actually happy smiling fun talk too   Great customer service always big bonus me   wish more food joint friendly people working them   So moral story need Tommy's ASAP!  bring bib because amazingly delicious gooey chili cheese most likely everywhere when eating fantastic burger! <EOR> This Tommy's location good Tommy's grew California   Nevertheless first choice when want chili burger   something chili good   thick smooth   no shortage burgers   anything put matter   cheese burger   double cheese burger   hot dog   tamale   breakfast burrito   All chili   usually double cheese everything chili cheese tomatoe onion pickles mustard    such treat   Use fork scrape fallen chili off paper   enough couple good forks worth   If into hot things ask some hot peppers   light up    good complement mild chili  <EOR> First visit n vibe  chili hamburger very good  need restaurant other side town  Fort Apache Russell area   a real simple menu if chili your right place buy chili go  put right amount chili burger messy mess  Hamburger meat really tasty  Good luck Tommys   Maybe location near trop charleston????? <EOR> So finally gave curiosity major LA tradition wow disappointed! Here's quick rundown    First its WAAAY east side town worth drive just experience save your gas money time  Second burger meat itself maybe  175 mil thick mean thin  beef? here! RIDICULOUS  double burger when taken complete unit tasted mustard dill pickle chili goo  no grilled beef flavor nothing more mustard pickleness  Folks seem speak highly chili fries while never life ordered particular item anywhere decided first along first Tommy's visit   comfort food  everything imagine would want Cheese Fries salty crispy cheesey thick chili its big thick food blanket  forced mind thought many calories probably danger food?     all sake fellow Yelpers  Yes its all you! Anyway    bottom line In N Out where need if want anything short gourmet burger tastes burger  Animal style oh yeah  If need fast food level chili fix Wienershnitzel your place  chipotle chile thing now tell truth almost identical Tommy's chili  probably source same company  Tommy's experience sat gut uncomfortably 5 hours  used eating such heavy food tell other folks Tommy's evening seemed BMI over 40  should tell lot  <EOR> Guillermo bigger gentlemen working location your burgers bare hands!! Yum     watched NO GLOVES!!  Pulling tomatoes lettus fingers placing burger     apron filthy dirity he wiped hands side it  When explained no longer wanted order because gross against health code wanted refund  Guillermo replys Handel money its ok if touch your food hands throwing hands air  Uhhhh ewwww  No  refund highly suggest everyone eat location would assume other locations similar  Ewww  <EOR> The customer service really bad   When employees order wrong lady proceeded tell wrong when clearly checked order   opinion right thing just remake burger originally made wrong   Very rude likely return location  <EOR> Every time come everyone always nice  Service quick accurate  coming since opened haven't messed order yet! dad LOVES here! He used original Tommys California  glad finally came Las Vegas! <EOR> So service great employees  Very personable speedy order  reason low star food quality taste  same price spent number 1 could purchased something flavor  greasy burger chili  Fries would passed tastebuds if didn't put any disgusting chili it  only thing worth going into establishment fountain drink  Which raspberry ice tea  Smh <EOR> I don't usually reviews but come off mouth  food extremely gross  burger itself disgusting bread seemed expired  all soggy tasteless  can't even begin chili  normally chili back LA but felt just dollar store stuffed in  Cheese also frozen felt cardboard top fries  fries itself seemed made weeks ago  only thing enjoyed pink lemonade  Very low quality food however customer service really nice  would give negative 2 star if could <EOR> NO CHICKEN PRODUCTS  Seriously day age?  I drove place hundreds times thinking sounded pretty cool other day finally bit bullet inside  Put bluntly just isn't much reason back    I no problems service speed which food least list positive place    But menu lacks any real variety  Sadly place essentially poor man's In N Out Burger share In N Out's biggest flaw lack any chicken products  everyone likes burgers hot dogs sure hell can't meal just fries  defense place also breakfast menu but weren't serving all day sort defeats purpose    The big gimmick behind place put chili everything     but seriously run whole restaurant around premise?  Disappointingly shakes standard fast food fare themselves being similar In N Out  If into retro style restaurant want quality 50s diner style malt crap down street McDonalds get   If place would add chicken products menu would score some major points book     but somehow doubt happen anytime soon  <EOR> Tommy's Mom's favorite place  Being she pickie eater always know if burger extra pickles she devour whole thing    I've tried many things Tommy Burger some favorites Tamale covered chili cheese Double Tommy Burger Chili cheese fries  If first timer any those items sure satisfy your hunger  chili unique no beans delicious  I'd cover ALL things it   I also love great prices! feed whole family under $20    If aren't counting calories want something different burger sure stop Tommy Burger  <EOR> The food okay   but when terrible customer service want ever come back  Loud noises while you're eating very pleasant  people need better management need consider dragging damn garbage all over dining room while people trying pleasant meal!! <EOR> 1st visit  I asked known for?
