Late night menu Burgers quesadillas chicken wings other stuff! Beach Cafe usually very dead late evenings unless convention Tropicana  love BBQ Chicken Wings 12 wings $12   spicy there's plenty meat bones  Quesadilla isn't very good plus very small portion    Service Ambiance Service good both brunch late night  Service employees attentive helpful  There's fake Miami Beach atmosphere Beach Cafe  Palm trees outside whole lot white white white color everywhere    Overall brunch buffet could improve bit more but 24 hour diner arguably best bang your buck Las Vegas Strip  just sucks all way south end Strip there's much else Tropicana offers  <EOR> Pretty standard Vegas restaurant Tropicana   Inside Outside seating   breakfast buffet AM 20 dollars   twice breakfast buffet short selection but pretty good quality probably better most others    selection tropical fruits omelet station some pretty unique options well   All all standard buffet little tropical flair huge selection  The prices pretty standard general dining establishment Las Vegas strip  Besides breakfast buffet which few times also lunch which features some good selection coming around 15 pop   Everything little bit south florida twist but end all food served pretty standard burgers club sandwiches basic pasta etc  Not best but certainly seen much worse Las Vegas  wouldn't way visit Cafe Nikki but if staying Trop need good sit down meal breakfast usually end pretty much your best bet   trop also steakhouse Biscayne Italian place Bacio food court starbucks gelato etc <EOR> Do order bar  Moscow mule worst ever food    as well  <EOR> The worst breakfast experience Vegas didn't coffee until 1 2 done meal no EVER showed omelette could never refill already late coffee  Expressed all displeasure hostess    uhh    Sorry waitress busy setting poolside lunch  Well hope pool goers tipped because didn't  Idiots <EOR> Ate breakfast dinner during weekend stay Tropicana   For dinner restaurant pretty empty yet still sat next obnoxious group meatheads barbie dolls  service OK although considering only table server didn't check very often  food burger tasty enough albeit overpriced wife's chicken sandwich   I could say same breakfast terms quality again nothing special but expensive but step further complain server George said he would some cream coffee disappeared least 5 minutes  return he gave table across cream started ignore shouted down  He completely unapologetic whole situation he given tip through much duress! George less acceptable server if anyone Beach Cafe reads this  <EOR> Beach Cafe your average run of the mill Vegas dining spot  whole place beach y feel  felt lot place ate when trip Mexico atmosphere wise   biggest complaints facility chairs weren't very comfortable service wasn't much better  Otherwise whole place pretty A OK     On night number flight delayed myself co worker starving stopped quick late night bite  ordered chicken quesadilla he ordered mini burgers  Both just fine meal nearly 11 30 night    They offer breakfast buffet $21 per person which includes your beverage choice OJ coffee  ate total 5 times while recent business trip  3 5 times service iffy  If you're wondering why often    convenience  only breakfast place hotel due time constraints besides Starbucks if even counts kinda forced eat here    The buffet contained sausage bacon muffins mini bagels salmon fresh fruit scrambled eggs breakfast potatoes sliced meats cheeses cereal favorite   an omelet station!   One day even though requested omelet well done quite under cooked actually them remake particular day  feel bad because next day think omelet guy kinda afraid me  He joked coming back even though he knew he messed day before just laughed off he did great job day #2    Would back?? Probably would way but if hotel   maybe would grab quick bite some food tummy pre cocktail  <EOR> The breakfast buffet fantastic   Omelette station highly recommend  Jalapeños spicy salsa egg white omelette veggies    Really good breakfast potatoes  Nice atmosphere very attentive hostess  definitely back!!! Convenient since staying Tropicana <EOR> Wings dam good! much flavor we're very spicy tasty crispy  Perfect wings! pasta sucked lol Cajun pasta needs revamped way much tomato sauce  would definitely look changing if head chef  Overall service great  free 40 00 lunch comp <EOR> What Mothers day?  My choices many but typically jacked rates starting $45 anywhere decent just because somewhere Simons added another station buffet     Do drop $250 plus 2 Mom's 15 year old just right?
