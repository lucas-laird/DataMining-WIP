Very disappointing   Food expensive  $7 99 2 pieces chicken 2 sides good value  Chicken mediocre best bit salty nothing special  better chicken some local grocery stores  Wait time 10 minutes   Overall would recommend place   overrated far better values town  <EOR> After night strip starving hotel gave number House Flavor  really excited because really wanted try food anyways while vacation Las Vegas    I put order delivery  FYI $20 minimum delivery which fine me  ordered food guy phone said it'd 45 minutes   I said no problem  happy could deliver since really really late    I waited 45 minutes hour no food  called restaurant told again only 1 driver she 2 other orders ahead she'd 5 minutes    I continued wait somewhere between 1 half hours 1 hour 45 minutes placing order food finally delivered  point exhausted didn't even enjoy food right away   which fine because cold then didn't access microwave   The red velvet waffles lacked flavor   the only thing red velvet them color  even seemed bit dry but course didn't enjoy them while fresh    I'll back when try food again   I feel can't give fair review because didn't enjoy food when fresh warm   If hadn't enjoyed much liquor would just but delivered experience  beware delivery  DESPERATELY lacking  <EOR> Place seriously SUCKS!
