Weakness beef teriyaki short ribs ramen less average  meats extraordinarily fatty ramen first came little broth second time came watered down broth  combo beef teriyaki ramen however only cost $10 really good deal   I no idea where place located but should want sushi place top list  <EOR> I AYCE sushi friends visiting California  wasn't really busy around lunchtime but when entered greeted staff cheerful manner  then promptly seated waitress given menus   The price AYCE isn't bad cheaper other sushi places around area  probably good marketing strategy because right across UNLV feel most clientele college students    I liked sushi rolls but honestly better  rolls made purple rice which unique twist sushi because never seen done before  rolls enjoyed Las Vegas Spider rolls   There other rolls weren't good Hawaii roll which basic California roll topped tuna  know know    some people don't classify California roll sushi but didn't want anything crazy  When roll came noticed tuna top darker color normal  discoloration made feel fish used roll wasn't fresh  Total appetite killer   I think little side orders food listed under Starter section AYCE menu better rolls opinion  Definitely try baked scallop baked green mussel  baked scallop creamy soft texture  rich flavor fill easily  baked mussels probably best baked mussels while! They're packed flavor practically melted mouth   I think place average  If you're balling budget craving AYCE sushi then your spot  Some rolls hit miss but overall Oodolee just okay  <EOR> Looking quick place grab bite eat while waiting flight home  Found place Yelp decided give try  Good food quick service!!
