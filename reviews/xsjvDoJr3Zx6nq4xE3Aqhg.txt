Excellent seasoning flavor fried rice done perfection   Today Ribeye dish again some yummiest food truck ever had   Same awesome fried rice yesterday   Pricing typical food truck pricing elevated just because they're major trade show   If you're show guys show skip crap LVCC food service wander outside Truk N Yaki truck won't regret it   Dave <EOR> Sunset Park'd event Japanese Burrito sounded good could better  ordered Burrito ribeye only took few minutes  If remember old Wendy's commercial old woman saying repetitively beef burrito would perfect commercial  90 percent rice veggies ribeye just few chunks each half  definitely gets bites no meat  Flavors good sauce little spice but worth $11 charge  Now know why no line! <EOR> They've around almost two years but only just tried local truck today overpriced Great American Foodie Fest  Not entirely choice don't judge  Truk N Yaki bills itself somewhat Japanese steakhouse wheels  offer simple menu rice plates burritos same protein options each chicken shrimp ribeye   My mom thought ribeye burrito $12 event sounded relatively interesting available foods Foodie Fest it  conveniently sliced half diagonal medium spicy sauce side   The burrito hot pretty rich flavor protein portion sufficient ribeye meaty yet tender shell crispy  sauce nice but essential  enjoyed overall but flavors weren't mindblowing portion very modest   I liked them but could've easily 3 star review if they'd slightly more stingy meat  Maybe try them again explored rest local Asian truck scene  <EOR> Tasted frozen dinner  meat steak burrito tasted freezer burn  back drawing board  Japanese Mexican food does mix well together  <EOR> We lucky catch place food truck event Sunset Park time some time ago  YUMMY food! best food truck arena opinion tried few   teriyaki dish did husband  love fusion food but sadly some miss mark   one! tried few favorites  place easily falls into category favorites  The quality ingredients important  Isn't terrible when stir fry dish mushy veggies? case here  stir fry veggies crisp tender  flavors equally important  mean all come together overpower each other if any sense  If there's much sauce then sweet ya know? portion size also important lots food trucks pretty skimpy   good size satisfying substantial  price also factor  wasn't breaking bank some food trucks outrageous   Oh wait wasn't bad either  when all point really take notice lasting impression memory enough try follow try catch food truck another event  Note really did take time enjoy savor yumminess because didn't want rush through it  We really want yummy teriyaki dish again Hubby loved too!!! ! think need check website again very soon  <EOR> They friendly willing assist all boogie particular ordering specifications accommodating AF   only but fantastic  Unbelievably good  Japanese burrito medium rare ribeye shrimp    Let tell you    if shrimp trucks exploded killed right now would died happy  strongly recommend it  <EOR> These guys campus UNLV yesterday   ordered shrimp plate which freakin' delicious   only issue small amount house sauce got   mean little container maybe 2 teaspoons which barely enough third plate   could least filled container sauce   Other dish very flavorful ample shrimp  <EOR> Wow! Absolutely amazing food reasonable price! Thank coming punk rock bowling guys amazing! Japanese Burrito Chicken Plate both perfectly done! Great job guys! <EOR> The ribeye Japanese burrito BOMB  normally really picky vegetables unless compliment flavors oh mannnn every single bite burrito good  ribeye itself perfectly tender  can't wait another burrito them  <EOR> Had give 3 stars since rice sorta hard tasted old  Sucks  give mad props ribeye  delicious tender  sauce wasn't bad either   I'd definitely try again just hopes rice bit more fresh    I'll try burrito next time  <EOR> Delicious!!! combo plates which great but  especially love Rib eye Burrito   Everyone needs try dip house made sauces good! want right now am typing this  Great food great service  You're missing if don't try them  favorite food truck Las Vegas! <EOR> Apparently just having food truck itself virtue enough  No need serve high end food just having grill wheels  Mobile food where amirite?  This phoned representation Japanese food seen  wraps Japanese burritos which means half food plate stuffed into shell  Mas hot sauce awful teriyaki much further behind  Rice hot none cups seem fit well sure spill sauce all over yourself  Hell Vegas right? All extra expense because cool all     So if overcooked ribeye vegetables predominantly high onions yet without any actual cooking technique your thing go  Look no further  <EOR> I looking  something different eat other Lucky's spotted food truck outside LVCC during CES  menu looked interesting decided give ribeye burrito $13 try   They rice plates your choice beef shrimp chicken comes w fried rice veggies  also roll any those into burrito couple dollars less  Even though enjoyed burrito meat rice ratio 1 4 couple bites getting just mouthfuls rice tore burrito apart finished fork  sauce put creamy savory sauce really made burrito  Also grab hot sauce little kick!  Next time probably try plates since seem more meat! <EOR> I admit little bit nervous shrimp food truck  Boy oh boy wrong! Yesterday shrimp teriyaki plate served veggies fried rice   shrimp nothing less delectable perfectly cooked plump delicious  fried rice veggies likewise amazing flavor  definitely order truck again    Also really interesting sounding Asian burrito similar ingredients really want try    <EOR> Hot fresh deliciousness! tasty glad Truk stopping Government Center Friday cheer government workers! I chose chicken bowl instead burrito   The chicken plate very flavorful pretty good sized portion  enjoy spicy kick food meal just spicy enough!  There enough meat chicken plate veggies pretty good too   5 customers waiting pick food wait 10 minutes  I'd rate food better most trucks ordered from! Credit cards accepted also  <EOR> Had Truk N Yaki first time highly impressed compared many other food trucks eaten from  Francisco really gets great flavor ingredients cooking talent! He also very nice young woman working whole group people enjoyed food  If line food trucks front would choose Truk N Yaki sure! Thanks! <EOR>
