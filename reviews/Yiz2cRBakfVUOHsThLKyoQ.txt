<EOR> Got mailer practically free meal resist bargain forgot diet drug Anaconda Charlie's    Ron's surprisingly nice subdued place tacky old smoke filled casino  quiet pleasant inside bread basket greeted pretty yummy   Our waiter also pleasant enough fellow but afraid need stick serving specialist prepare tableside caesar salad because OMG! actually list ingredients menu romaine lettuce being main but afraid  deceptive actually garlic  enough peel layer skin inside your mouth  Holy Sh#t! only he decided since most people don't anchovies better mash them into paste emulsify them dressing but drape little carcasses across salad instead  would fine assuming smoky chewy delicious kind anchovies but wet slimy unfit consumption unless incorporated into another entity  No problem  wasn't exactly possible taste them anyway your tastebuds mouth lining burnt away garlic   As rest Anaconda really stuffed mushrooms  thought sauce little spicy but made happy since he didn't share   The prime rib juicy rare it   Sides orzo risotto au gratin potatoes both enjoyable   positive experience recovered salad  Well still haven't recovered salad  <EOR> Love service staff!
