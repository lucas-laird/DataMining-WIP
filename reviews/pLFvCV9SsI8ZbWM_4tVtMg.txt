I would agree previous review s claiming some dishes overly salty at least Jerk Chicken but well worth considering limited options Vegas terms Jamaican food   Atmosphere Bob Marley pandering crap but nothing distracting  definitely pricey don't expect pay less $10 $15 meal considering plastic tablecloths styrofoam containers used even dining disposable utensils limited service only ignoring serving size  Aside food flavorful owner friendly  <EOR> This place looked fun outside!  bad food disgusting place filthy   Just record am Jamaican food expert any standard but know when something disgusting   back  <EOR> Excellent jerk wings curry chicken beef patty  Would definitely recommend place! Loved it <EOR> I decided check place reading all positive reviews but bit disappointed  Upon entering wasn't greeted woman behind counter looked she bothered didn't want there                                              I order small oxtail dinner rice peas festival salad  Now must say food prepared different any oxtail meal ever eaten family any other Jamaican establishment  oxtails needed more seasoning did any sauce gravy browning  rice peas okay  salad fresh tiny piece bread aka festival soggy     charge $13 plate food fill food? expected more price paid  other places lived Jamaica Miami NY $13 easily feed 2 people   top all hair food piece oxtail eat seemed greenish brown tint it  Yuck! <EOR> Tasty food but portion size minimal best  price charge portion could much better   addition curry goat more bones meat! <EOR> Ordered beef patty didn't it! cooked rancid oil  Rice peas really beans rice  good!!! <EOR> So accidentally found spot getting groceries while vacation Vegas    most Jamaican spots small mom pops place  Don't expect glitz glamour just some good old fashion fresh Jamaican food  jerk chicken oxtails chicken goat curry chx patties not all same day everything great!

Tasty Island Carribean restaurant meaning try since only pass everyday work  Just right additional push reading fellow yelpers reviews besides sure last time Jamaican food  if ever before  looking forward some jerk chicken rice beans plantain bananas  All things common no means expert Carribean foods  Just dishes spark interesting thinking style food    I ordered jerk chicken comes steamed rice rice beans I if going islands right! rice beans vegetables fried plantain some kind bread roll  better way wash all done some Jamaican Kola! am FAN seasoning jerk chicken  spicy spicy but little kick but besides spicy just well rounded flavors  large small portion  sure if less pieces chicken  large thigh breast drumstick  skin now star more then meat  Nothing better then crispy chicken skin especially marinaded jerk seasonings adds much depth it  meat inside nice moist  rice beans could just big bowl itself! rice cooked perfect beans  nice hearty rice said could meal all itself!!! fried plantain nothing special but often see places use plantain menu  knot type roll vegetables both ok  Kola interesting  Different  If anything thinking close cream soda taste?   The decor inside all over place set deli counter display cases  dining area feels pretty packed together booths tables  counter order once done let know it  Talk Bob Marley just reggae vibe  If playing music would full island style  different colors signs outside inside  Many Bob Marley posters Jamaican theme decor would almost think gone islands  service felt good    Definitely place plan coming back trying more menu  lunch specials too  <EOR> Placed order thru grub hub short ribs jerk chicken chicken soup  20 min later call saying short ribs food delivered 25 min later jerk  chicken really no flavor expecting big kick chicken soup absolutely no chicken only potatoes peas carrots green beans corn disturbing thing found 3 chicken bones could broke teeth eat alot money spend expect food good safe recommend no ever eat when run products your main item good your soup no chicken only bones thats major problem bad give star cause would minus 5 stars <EOR> The service good back try again  never any food  first young lady came front smile could hear but she shushed away im assuming allow another lady trained  speaking if wasn't standing then said can't hear woman said know because you're over over here  simply said no need place order thank though  She said didn't mean that!

The interior little dated  tables booths but didn't really set layout  When arrived no music playing TV wasn't patrons dining super quiet  silence little unbearable kinda made experience little more awkward especially people lining behind   Thankfully younger gentleman assuming worked turned TV room wasn't filled uncomfortable silence steady hum refrigerators    I ordered small size jerk chicken side order plantains    The jerk chicken pretty great! remember if don't cook jerk chicken correct way gets rubbery hard  borderline inedible    The jerk chicken tender juicy nice chew it   seasoning perfect spicy kick which enough sweat little  Keep mind tolerance spice little lower everyone else's but  Caribbean food desirable  spices! The rice peas beans best thing jerk chicken  also good Caribbean spice really give mouthful unique  flavors if eaten chicken  Yummy!  The plantains weren't plantains usually used eating  more long slender slices ripe plantain fried golden brown perfection  perfect texture they're point sweet caramelized homemade flavor   I didn't really beef patties here  think other better tasting ones but until find good place Vegas place suffice    The food definitely personality its own  If you're spice fanatic down taste flavors Jamaica then give place try! <EOR> A co worker mine suggested place because he knows always trying new restaurants lunch   Found menu usmenuguide calaloo salt fish dish   no idea exactly calaloo salt fish but feeling getting Zimmern day   When pick food little bit wait several customers came arrived which seized attention lone worker front   She very friendly though maybe just arrived early pickup   decided order some fresh lemonade which believe cost $3 came some jug refrigerator behind counter   think need break narrative straight review lemonade   DISGUSTING   Overly sweet just pleasant flavor didn't taste fresh least   threw away immediately upon getting back office     The food much more pleasing every way    First off mountain food   prices run little high but lot it   Callaloo turned some leafy substance reminded spinach and or seaweed   Saltfish turned bland pieces chicken   Just kidding spoiler alert salty pieces fish    also few pieces plantain thought tasted little off other versions past    Callaloo saltfish tasted nice and yes really salty liked preparation rice well     I can't say I'd ever clamor revisit tasty island though I'd definitely give some more entrees try if came down it    Moral entire review When life gives lemons don't Tasty Island lemonade it  <EOR> Ok place changed much  The food excellent New staff very professional restaurant always clean fresh literately eat 4 days week now everything taste good especially oxtails pineapple  ginger juice <EOR> I would gave them zero if option   the chef seems he she forgot toad flavor live food didn't even take time serve hot    nothing worst lukewarm food   So   disappointed don't mention much two veggie meals cost <EOR> I'm part Jamaican didn't ya know?
