We Tuesday night only diners   Which meant good service 1 waitress   Ordered some rolls soup tea   All good expected   Fresh relatively quick tasted good but mind blowing   stand out Rainbow Roll which looked pretty neat tasted on point   also nice fresh cucmber salad before she brought other stuff   Nice meal but nothing special   On way noticed Sunday 4 10PM I think all you can eat $9 99   tried come back Sunday around 5 30PM   Place full but couple tables   Same only 1 waitress previous night   Stood waiting seated 5 minutes then she came over asked seat she table ready   10 minutes later she hadn't even looked way again told cancel order table nearby patrons couldn't wait any longer   Seemed take long time anything seating ordering food check etc   Maybe need more help $9 99 Sunday   We left Kai Sushi Durango Flamingo  <EOR> i think place really good money 10 bucks lunch all u eat server she excellent service  done lunch  3of 45 minute <EOR> Worst sushi place ever to  even better sushi casino buffet  place only recommended those people enjoy fish fresh tasteless surrounded massive amounts rice  First all isn't traditional glass sushi refrigerator allows customers observe freshness fish that first clue should walked immediately   sushi refrigerator probably missing because fish isn't fresh all  far could tell fish could even pre sliced    Second all AYCE sushi only cheap fish only served inside out roll  reason obvious traditional roll fish rice inside  seaweed sheet wraps being exterior limits overall size  inside out roll fish middle seaweed wraps around fish rice wraps around seaweed  such allows sushi chef roll big possible limited size where mass rice overcomes sticky adhesive properties rice causing fall apart when lifted plate   sushi bar means thickness rice very tightly packed 3 4 inch thick piece fish width number 2 pencil  over all width piece sushi least 2 inches  impossible eat whole piece without breaking into several pieces  use chicken McNuggets analogy each piece having three chicken McNuggets only meat only size dime batter consisting rest  deconstructed several pieces ate fish rice separately only way actually taste fish  all cases ratio volume fish rice 1 8 10    Third all try sell buy nigiri sushi $1 00 $3 00 per piece  few these  Again massive amount rice stale tasteless fish  chef didn't even know proper technique assembling nigiri sushi maybe proper technique doesn't work well when using insane amounts rice    I only imagine piece gunkan maki battleship style sushi would look like  would probably stuffed rice within tenth inch top  Followed thin layer good stuff being spread thin possible  Any gaps would expose rice covered mayonnaise BTW don't use Japanese Mayonnaise tastes more Miracle Whip    When consider base price lunch special $9 99 sell price $1 $3 nigiri style sushi quickly ends costing same almost same reputable establishment  would recommend passing place going Oyshi sushi 808 sushi must try Hamachi Kama grilled yellowtail collar ponzu sauce if your part town  actually eaten real sushi won't left feeling ripped off  suspect any positive review establishment those vested interest its success those very price sensitive  Those honestly believe sushi good newbies need more  should try recommendations above before engaging any ad hominem responses  <EOR> I've using Yelp 8 months going Sushi Banzai tonight just encouraged finally write first review    My two small children wanted sushi  Most AYCE offer children's menu besides bento boxes  paying children @ AYCE would  worth it  thought place would excellent since buy sushi  al carte which also 50% off! deserves star perfect small appetite whether child adult      We walked greeted right away sat table  waited 10 15 mins before server acknowledge again take drink order  Finally 25 mins being finally give sushi order  She looked weird because ordered children sushi whom mentioned under 5  wait time ridiculous being only 2 other tables besides us  never beverage refilled entire meal   sushi OK better  spider roll average crab wasn't fresh pre cooked before ordering  Yuck! no crunch  tempura roll tasted exactly same  children ordered Ebi Nigiri which took 15 mins come no idea hard slap shrimp rice?! Anyways when tasted just rice wasn't any flavor other places gone too    Toward end meal ran rice told I'd wait 25 mins before order next roll  gave up! Ordered some yummy mochi ice cream which course store bought no big deal    So overall I'd come back again if just kids want cheap sushi  don't think I'd bringing husband AYCE here  <EOR> All eat sushi around $25  Some best sushi had  Nice atmosphere  Super friendly service  group friends taste variety items menu  nice  variety desserts too  Fried Banana Ice Cream  Delicious! <EOR> Tried place lunch AYCE special 10 bucks  Didn't high expectations but never know  ten basic rolls nigiri spicy tuna roll california roll etc  normally don't order those types rolls which fine because most special rolls just 3 4 dollars more  Which great idea them door then sell your better rolls  made order spicy tuna roll special rolls  wasn't busy all yet took some time order  waitress attentive very clean nice place  When order came sat looked trying find sushi  see lower end AYCE sushi houses rolls where rice half inch thick if thicker center where fish should smaller half inch diameter  your mainly getting filled rice which means eat less save money Ultimately lose money because wants back? first time then wait next person see $ 10 AYCE sign cycle starts all over again  Which if read other reviews tips  exactly them come in Its sad because its hard give customer want  <EOR> The spicy ya yam scallop roll kick it  Hands down friendliest service ever received  Delicious fresh sushi  ordered la carte received free desserts  We back sure all eat   <EOR> So husband driving down Tropicana oil changed see sign AYCE lunch $10!   Holy crap! change lunch plans accommodate Sushi Banzai thought would steal  First yelp joint most people say pretty decent sushi bit much rice   When only owners other family 1PM  probably should ran while could but decided take seat take advantage deal  ordered 7 rolls total rice fish ratio literally 5 1  weren't able taste any fish because rice overwhelmed much  When finished first roll actually asked waitress less rice but she said only way it  tried avoid rice but there's sign table says eat EVERYTHING including pound rice comes every roll    Overall absolute worst sushi ever eaten  prefer buffet sushi place any day  never eat again made mission tell everybody deceived AYCE lunch  <EOR> The sushi pieces just keep getting bigger bigger     salmon wow where such tender salmon!    They keep changing frequent diner program often can't keep track   But can't hold against them such good sushi bountiful proportions! <EOR> I love place! would always Sushi Mon but started getting tired waiting table since always full small place     so started going around area see other sushi places around found one   and loved staff friendly sushi great never wait table since doesn't full guessing area  started coming when la carte now all eat even better  <EOR> Unbelievable new sushi place west side Las Vegas   service 5 stars fantastic host waiter sure very enjoyable experience   sushi offered great Nigiri part All Eat Menu well fresh Sashimi some best rolls you'll ever taste     plus ALL EAT DESSERTS!
