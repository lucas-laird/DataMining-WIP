Bona large fold in half style thin crust New York style pizza which usually don't prefer but exception pizza   really simple pizza but really awesome   think sauce sets apart other places   Also staff sweet believe they're Italian I'm good placing accents    Beware $1 card charge though <EOR> Ok admit food decent   BUT way better places service  2 stars food   would've given them 3 stars but food decent but NEVER CONSISTENT   Sometimes great sometimes missing some kind seasoning     Twice row ordered delivery them WRONG!  when called instead apologizing owner gave attitude!  TWICE he gave attitude!  mean come on   Seriously owner macho proud he aplogize?  I've read other reviews always well food decent but tonight no more   plenty other pizza places around order from     So if mediocre service sometimes decent food otherwise try somewhere else  <EOR> Pizza prepared way should be  Made scratch fresh ingredients  <EOR> Tried place tonight impressed write review ASAP!!  So place itself pretty bare bones   no decor   you might even think just opened hour ago!  We ordered large pepperoni pizza order garlic bread cheese  ordered take live least 5 6 minutes away  reading some other reviews concerned time home would soggy   So home crack box open whoa  the pizza looked great! bubbly few charred spots crust which opinion delish! was  fantastic pizza  soggy all  sauce pretty close perfection  hate heavy chunky sauces light flavorful  crust thin but bit chewiness it   definetley paper thin  no complaints pizza  just perfect    The bread also bit charred ends proportion generous  No complaints    My husband begged pick Monday night football couple days agreed  area pizza choices very limited happy found place    And best part bill $15 bucks including tip!! Holly mozzarella! love place  I just hope they're consistent   Since first review eaten 3 more times pizza generally consistent  first pizza ordered best   the crust crunchy those delish charred bubbles  other pizzas ordered since little flimsy crust bit soggy but still very good   I also ordered antipasta salad guessing dressing anchovies cuz tasted smelled fishy   at least hoping anchovies dressing cause that! didn't it  It ok but husband NO! outta here! salad itself soggy  Also ordered chicken fingers  yum  Very good   although little greasy side but love style chicken fingers  Breaded style your choice mild medium hot sauce  ranch dipping sauce bomb  Best ranch ever had  If chicken fingers Villa you'll love these   So still love place quickly become favorites! <EOR> Bona advertises itself offering Italian style pies know? never Italy    On first visit say pizza quite decent  Maybe finally found some local relief New York style dominates town  No slam NY style just isn't thing  Quality ingredients pizza turning mush congealing before meal over fair price nice guy counter made tentative thumbs up  amazing tastes but better pizzas pizza bereft area  Okay screwed second pizza entirely which only discovered upon getting home but since didn't say anything give Bona Pizza chance things right can't really complain here  Accidents happen  Second visit? More Little Italy Italia  Yikes  Now crust vertical soon grab edge soggy end second slice  Same good service same good price same good ingredients but same pizza all   Was fluke first time? Did change style suit crowds? just unlucky second visit?  These questions mind there's another problem  noted another review started slipping into gated apartment complexes spamming residents fliers  school just because everyone else does doesn't littering essentially trespassing acceptable  If people worked Bona Pizza weren't nice perhaps feeling desperate economy I'd knock another star off review  said move convinced give them third chance   For those bothered live action junk mail though Bona Pizza certainly worth try  If your style pizza you'll probably pleasantly surprised quality service  <EOR> Starting really annoyed Bona's unsolicited junk mail crammed twice weekly into doorjams apartment complex    NO SOLICITING! <EOR> I've food few times always good   first two times hubby pizza wings   wings good well good Las Vegas meaning decent size aren't dripping grease when order hot actually kind hot   pizza really good well   tried cheese pizza which great deal large cheese $8!  Cheaper Walmart! Rustica Pizza roasted red peppers chicken artichokes    delivery fast only took them 30 minutes when told 45   Today actually eat   ordered Penne la vodka Caesar salad mom chicken sorrentino chicken breast topped eggplant mozz house salad hubby chicken philly dad sausage pepper sandwich   all happy food     The salads good size portion could probably spit them between two people   LOVED Caesar salad because dressing homemade therefore REAL Caesar dressing   could taste garlic just hint anchovy flavor totally brought back childhood   house salad mixed green salad some tomatoes balsamic vinegar for only $3 think cheaper Mickey Ds mom really liked it   salads came yummy homemade rolls hot oven   Penne la vodka delicous very creamy tasty much having dinner later tonight   chicken sorrentino also good size portion chicken breast served top linguine mom took half home   sandwiches decent size dad I consider expert sausage peppers since signature dishes really enjoyed sandwich   sandwiches came crinkle cut fries which score book cause hate skinny fries   Oh cool thing owner doing everything himself   He waited cooked food took orders over phone   Totally friendly guy   Since Cuginos other side city Bona pizza where getting Italian food West side! <EOR> this favorite italian restaurant coworker pretty sad ever since closed don't know where eat good italian food now love chef Nick made everything scratch feel passion watch cook really sweet guy tell he care customers think food lot   If anyone know where he please let know   pity small truly outstanding restaurant don't last long he would better if he's better location   If ever hold where chef totally willing pay cook meal  <EOR> Picked pie thoughts    First off charging additional $1 using credit card BS period  mention against user's agreement businesses must agree when utilizing CC companies  On food    toppings bit light side meaning quantity mushrooms roasted peppers but fresh flavorful  crust NY style very good really enjoyed outer edges which very bubbly light  When comes sauce sweet taste  being said still good homemade taste enjoyed but I'd want them experiment sauce little more little more balanced regards this  Would back? Yes but better options come more balanced pizza regards quantity ingredients flavor sauce  <EOR>
