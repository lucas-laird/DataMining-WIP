I wish Swish would create customer loyalty program know once people enjoy meal Swish almost always back again     Either way Swish delicious hope stick around! <EOR> My girlfriend found restaurant Groupon  celebrate husband's birthday  decided try something new different   The wait staff wonderful  food great  Overall fun experience  Then bill came  proudly gave Groupon   when learned Groupon would honored  explained owner does honor would applied  What?!? asked speak someone manager   waiter further explained owner he already called them once earlier yelled would want called again  Waiter also explained another bill Groupon owner took difference pay check  What?!?  Then why still actively still showing Groupon if honoring it?? I pulled show Shame Swish  Shame owner  very excited come back  But also looking forward Groupon discount  Prior ordering maybe door table should sign saying No honoring Groupons    Needless say never return girlfriend contact Groupon file formal complaint against restaurant hopefully refund  husband contacting BBB filing formal complaint well  <EOR> We wandered into Swish Shabu Shabu because 3 villages closed place offers shabu shabu style vs  sukiyaki know just difference cooking broth essentially all your food raw uncooked cook burner your table  Walking inside stepping into steam broth heaven  smells fantastic gives warm fuzzy feelings    This last time stopped however alright nothing would bring back most definitely  couple times prior remember sukiyaki being much more potent savory    This time around just felt wasn't much flavor no matter long left veggies protein there    I salmon plate which came veggies napa cabbage mushrooms udon noodles carrots green onions tofu side raw salmon $12 95  didn't really leave satisfied  good is  salmon however fresh  even ate most them sashimi!   Don't forget use yelp check offer! large sake order nigiri two pieces <EOR> Loved it! Delicious shabu shabu!

I know back again  <EOR> My family come often shabu shabu  tucked away same plaza SF market right underneath Bazic  layout restaurant somewhat off  All tables scattered everywhere but nice able sit 8 top table when only three us    Service hit miss  times miss  place busy attentiveness lacked much own condiments asked few times for  Sometimes even getting menu could take awhile  also time when forgot rice waved hand air but staff looked dead just didn't care  damn he's faking funk game stuuurdy real sturdy  frustrating times  When service hit   wonderful experience here  Everything comes all once drinks refilled rice given without being asked  all chance here   We usually Kobe Chuck hungry portion comes small amount sliced white onion mushroom tofu cabbage broccoli green onion udon noodles  love dipping sauces which ponzu based sauce your veggies noodles goma sesame based sauce your meat  add minced daikon garlic green onion condiments selection ponzu sauce intensify flavor  also add garlic green onion goma sauce give meat same effect  Delicious  If don't your white rice condiments time your meat veggies done   Ask it!   I highly suggest avoid soy milk broth  isn't any flavor whatsoever translucent almost all seaweed broth sake shot soy milk  looking more heavy cream based broth all soy milk half shot of  stick Spicy Miso Broth which most flavor three Seaweed Spicy Miso Soy Milk    The technique shabu shabu its own  prefer use half tofu cabbage mushroom broccoli portion all white onion green onion save udon noodles very end  While veggies almost done swish Kobe Chuck slice then dip goma sauce veggie   dip ponzu then combine both meat veggie white rice magic shabu shabu  Lastly save udon noodles broth everything boiled it  Think seasoning broth soup Shabu shabu soul food its best  always leave smile face  therapeutic yet fun same time  Love music play here  Top 90's Reggae some old school Sinatra movin' while swishing away  Keith Sweat Give All Love You    Ready World Love Down just name few  Dining music love plusplusplus!

Friday night only customers   Feeling skeptical still sat down menus water I already knew wanted try reviews seafood hot pot few different nigiris    told Hispanic server first time she proceeded inform the chef home can't order any sushi seafood   Great items looking forward try   world!!! chef home???  husband looked each other decided leave   still Groupon use update if decide return  <EOR> I gone probably 150 times within span 3 years  spent good chunk income but worth every penny  manager Paul cordial service great! favorite prime rib which think best value  Meat highly marbled always good quality  highly recommend  <EOR> My first Shabu! fabu! groan     Seriously though   really enjoyed experience spicy miso shabu shabu delish! confirmed server and seaweed broth vegan good go   vegetarian delight pretty delighted   soy ponzu dipping sauce tasty nice compliment  The sesame sauce mayo based skipped that    meal light but filling very fresh tasting     quite deal only $8 95   only complaint plate 1 2 nappa cabbage only 1 oz tofu few slivers other veggies   love some nappa but I'd prefer little more broccoli udon noodles OMG udon noodles GOOD    Maybe next time just order extra portion tofu noodles??    The point definitely next time   can't believe haven't tried before!  I found friend's seaweed broth little bland but nice containers chopped garlic onion green onion chili sauce could use flavor if you're DIY sort broth maker   The service great ambiance nice even enjoyed little sake which don't usually care for   served large group 10 ppl well full restaurant grace aplomb     Part group ordered sushi apparently spicy ones should say ****ING CRAZY MAD SPICY  if you're into heat bring it   So wants some Shabu me? UYE? <EOR> Growing bay area grown fond eating Chinese style hot pot  all different spices flavors  never tried Japanese style hot pot Shabu Shabu until read great reviews fellow yelpers Swish  visit spring mountain restaurant ended disappointment  ordered Shabu Shabu just because hot pot style sukiyaki  Shabu Shabu bland tasted just water if wasn't sukiyaki would given just star  table set weird but  important  contrast Shabu Shabu sukiyaki flavorful  reminded Mongolian BBQ ate buffet asia but much tastier beef  Anyway fun trying but probably come back  <EOR> Finally am able try shabu shabu place  would always hear siblings talking glad finally say tried it! The experience similar kbbq style but cooking your meat hot pot style  order between different varieties meat veggies  choose which flavor broth would they'll bring flavor broth pot mini burner  orders seaweed miso spicy miso broth flavors  seaweed broth little bland enjoyed miso spicy miso lot more!   You then cook raw thin slices meet broth until cooked  same rule applies vegetables udon noodles  eat them bowl rice even your own little soup bowl slurp from  Overall great experience would recommend place  Especially if your feeling cold it'll definitely warm up! Taste Love Yelp it! <EOR> Great shabu shabu place Las Vegas  ordered prime rib eye shabu shabu style but also tried sukiyaki both great  portions generous prices reasonable  seen places charge $35 half quantity   The server very helpful actually Japanese  He recommended unfiltered sake shabu shabu sparkling sake sukiyaki since meal heavier  He poured sake which even common most sushi places around here   The restaurant only couple tables would call ahead if going group people  still worth checking though  <EOR> Went year ago review based older information   I LOVE shabu shabu hotpot etc while visiting Vegas decided try place boyfriend   We lunch place wasn't crowded  interior felt little weird me looks if set just day Top Chef competition something  also need fix ventilation here leave smelling old hot pot  cool if you're going town afterward   Menu shows different types meats different sizes platters  Most come rice veggies well  little surprised some prices even healthy smallest portions  Some said cheap but maybe used different area because some plain beef not even kobe much more used to  Ordered rib eye   We table range pot broth but honestly didn't care broth much  just okay should tried sukiyaki but picky that    Got couple dipping sauces which okay ponzu good but extra salty   Disappointed didn't faithful drink refills   Overall just little disappointed but maybe spoiled other shabu shabu places to  meat tasted stringy old being cooked only couple kinds veggies which weren't great   It just felt cheap didn't match price  I knew should tried mushroom platter instead    They happy hour which looks good deal  If you've never shabu shabu interested I'd say try place  definitely good starter discount price worth shot  <EOR> Yeah tonight last night going place   Teryaki beef bento box horrible    If japanese place can't bento right something definitely wrong    Meat burnt beef jerky   ordered 6 year old son    Sukiyaki cook yourself beef good but NO BEER?  Friday night?   Really?   Its ran out     just didn't put any fridge all wad warm beer    Wtf?

Overall experience Swish good   other shabu shabu places like Koji's Japan Orange CA http www yelp com biz cqQHvz1zvM_z2MbH0zjXBA#hrid xzHUpQinpow0nRqocXAB0w query Koji offer unlimited vegetables better dipping sauce   Then again Koji's bigger run operation Swish   wish would offer more vegetables though order     Look specials!  When offered 25% off Kobe orders 10% off Student IDs frequent eater card   They're open another location Silverado Range Maryland Pkwy late fall   Overall 3 5 stars but round up   Update! 10 29 07 Over weekend BF craving some Swish   ordered Kobe Rib Eye Shabu Shabu Healthy size $35 95 BF order Kobe Rib Eye Sukiyaki Healthy size $38 95    meat tender oh good   think prices just no longer offer frequent eater card   But offer group discount five more   reservations accepted parties three more too   Only udon noodles given time veggies still skimpy side opinion   Kobe Rib Eye pretty good stuff but costly thing! I added some pics dinner business profile section  Update! apparently offer happy hour 9 pm 10 pm  <EOR> I really liked place  friend groupon took lunch because he knows love all things hot pot shabu  can't really compare prices but only shabu place Vegas  think lunch great deal! 12 bucks 4oz portion ribeye plus rice veggies  broth soy spicy miso seaweed  picked spicy miso because sounds most flavorful   When restaurant pretty empty seated right away food came really fast place doesn't charge more extra broth extra sauce   huge bonus!  The beef very tender delicious  only dipped few seconds until turned color didn't tough  vegetables mostly cabbage but good portion  think favorite part condiments gave side  addition ponzu sesame sauce which delicious also hot sauce green onions grated garlic favorite grated radish!  would definitely come again shabu  left feel very full very satisfied  <EOR> We came Boyz II men show read little later but late relative Vegas time around 1000 PM   No except three person party   waitress took orders we all same meat except buddies sukiyaki style while usual shabu shabu    also ordered mushroom party because love enoki mushrooms and    who doesn't want say MUSHROOM PARTY ?

Um yeah  kind problem but let slide because broccoli thing wonderful  vegetables all fresh tofu good   Now maybe head maybe am just becoming sukiyaki snob but felt if broth little more salty less tangy sweet  could good thing bad thing because means indeed salty means other places putting boats sugar creations  need more tastings determine correct answer    For now think would just happy maybe happier having vegetable plate Swish location closer house but am still fan because sukiyaki just sukiyummy  more salty encounter however reevaluate  <EOR> Officially obsessed place  nice incredibly tasty healthy fresh food when dieting or just general!   $13 99 Kobe chuck lunch special hands down best food bargains city !
