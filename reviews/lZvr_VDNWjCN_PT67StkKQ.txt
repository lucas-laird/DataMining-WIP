Taken over week calm down write review  Never before used Groupon felt humiliated it  Jocelyn piece work sure  First off wait bc she blamed previous client which right away left bad taste mouth bad mouthing your own clients    First impression corner salon separated curtain string different competing music rest salon dirty was  Floor absolute mess un sanitized tweezers thrown everywhere dirty pillow       She then proceeded try sell every thing possible 50% lash coverage supposedly purchased would buy that $10 more collagen under eye pads  Btw Jocelyn only work biggest under eye collagen mask companies but also lash artist your price gauging China's 20 cent version under eye mask insane  Ours top line 3 separate treatments RETAILS $10 INCLUDED pricing  only did upgrade finish remaining 50% lashes but took tape champ   Prepare yourself though  Normally prep tape sticking clean towel first take off majority tack so doesn't rip off bottom lashes no she's gonna pay $10 sell way other cash bottom lashes  Nothing band aid being ripped off delicate skin under your eyes  does that??   She also doesn't seem care style length want very interested see 50% Groupon  lashes would turn out  Apparently however SHE wanted them to   If wasn't bad enough all selling she really bad attitude when comes rejection  She super mad when ripping tape off caused open eyes early  reprimanding telling late couldn't just close eyes again she stormed off receptionist!!  Please work your professionalism Jocelyn mind reader   So much any kind friendly chat she didn't say word through whole process  You'll happy know she actually did 100% lashes just 50% she threatened  She does need upgrade thick cheap lashes she uses  Buyer Beware  <EOR> To begin first attempts appointments should first clue  Coming NYC accustomed fair share patronizing twenty year salon receptionists spoke somehow better you  male receptionist often rude vile  person he no better   prices twice high New York prices maybe because thought artificial lake prime real estate   showed appointment turned away claiming wasn't schedule he insisted he called confirm some other date  looked voicemails saw nothing he realized he called wrong person   Given flawed appointment scheduling tough eyelash refills within strict 2 week rule utterly rude during attempts reschedule   pretty much vowed never return  until bf gifted surprise eyelash gift card sweet gesture  disappointed find he booked location  showed dreading appointment treated surpassed any expectations just might decent human beings  sum B level salon eyelash attendant attitudes toward customers completely absurd could only chock fact salon seemed pervaded culture being horrible people I e  very thinly veiled display overcompensation being trapped wannabe high class but very sad salon  <EOR> I've holding review but few months ago eyelashes done  I honestly thought best things ever! came Groupon classic set eyelash extensions  First thing coming lady doing lashes asked old was  told 18  Then response usually only take clients 21 over but since you've waiting guess it  Then reason why she said because said eyelash extensions something need keep doing probably don't job keep payments  Obviously time new didn't say much  When she done eyelashes sparse clumped  couldn't wear contacts because eyelashes stuck together hurt much even bother eyes  if pls diff place eyelash extensions  only she rude she lazy when came quality work handled eyelashes carelessly <EOR> I chose text Susan Kravetz amazing stylist for several reasons  text call  # 702 300 1113 Susan Kravetz I moved Las Vegas last month San Diego CA researching Yelp experienced stylist expert colourist whom could trust long golden locks hair  Found Susan Kravetz reading two weeks Yelp reviews many salons she replied text discussed personal hair history including photos very same evening  Today pampered transformed expertise!

Don't     just don't! <EOR> I wish read reviews before purchasing Groupon eyelash extensions   experience just bad other women left negative comments   First salon itself reception service disaster   first woman dealt merely dim bulb but second downright rude snooty way but abrasive low class doesn't know talk clients kind way   picked price list handouts DISPLAY counter without even asking any services she said Those prices aren't good any more  SNATCHED card hand  She also said prices website incorrect honor advertised prices  Note salon owners when hiring someone public interface position sure she wasn't raised wolves   Now eyelash service room which performed little cubby hole off reception area   no door just opening wall   Every time someone opens front door salon feel wind rushing hear everything reception area including some very LOUD voices   side wall cubbyhole huge hole where appears door used but just boarded plywood even painted over  floor FILTHY I thought maybe abstract pattern tile but bent down touched finger smudged  linens table where lie down service did appear changed since previous client unsanitary   seriously think Health  Department should pay unannounced visit   description service contract says lashes chosen consultation client but no consultation she just chose she wanted give me   When saw results shock   lashes most kindly described theatrical basically looked Lucille Ball Love Lucy days   am over 50 extremely fair skin flaxen blonde hair pale blue eyes midnight black lashes would perfectly suit showgirl Strip  curve 180 degrees poke into eyelids  hold them down apply eyeshadow eyeliner    The woman did pleasant enough claimed worked several high end cosmetics companies but said she now doing only eyelash extensions   may strategic career move her   any event actually gave rather generous tip because despite disappointment results felt sorry working those conditions  am sure she pays salon rent little hovel don't even supply clean linens   Having paid total $91 $46 Groupon $10 adhesive hold down lower lashes $35 tip which made clear should based LIST price Groupon price am now stuck Lucy Look next few weeks hardly wait until lashes fall off   Despite many positive reviews hair stylists cannot imagine ever returning salon anything   many bad memories  <EOR> I see Chelsea Lakeside once month  She very passionate she does let leave until both more happy  scenery beautiful well  Nice place relax some coffee tea while looking over lake getting your hair done  <EOR> Joycelyn did such amazing job eyelash extensions  am very impressed results  She made feel very comfortable easy being first time doing lash extensions Came back two week fill looked even better  definitely gained customer returning referring all girls well <EOR> I bought $27 Gel manicure Groupon   When called salon appointment spoke Heather which very attentive polite   just moved LA LV thought myself found new mani pedi hair salon!
