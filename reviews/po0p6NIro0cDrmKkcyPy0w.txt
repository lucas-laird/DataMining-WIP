Needless say turned around walked right out  best first impression especially many similar  dining options nearby  <EOR> I live neighborhood tried all poke places far best every way  It's always super fresh delicious  The staff always super friendly always smiling  am hooked place eat least once week! Please don't change thing !!! <EOR> I impress fast food clean fresh vegi fish very reasonable price ahi tuna very good plus seaweed salad very good but last time change scooper very small would last time there <EOR> I heard place all over town popular came check out  Well very disappointed  Don't understand why popular all  Subway Japanese food  fresh seafood setup Subway setup  pick whatever want your bowl viola !  your poke bowl  mashed spicy tuna spicy salmon others trays scoop ice cream scoop  sushi sashimi lover knows good sushi sashimi hard place    We didn't order poke bowl did look appetizing  never eat Japanese food prepared way sushi chef decided rolls  ordered Hawaiian Roll Something Wrong 215 Roll spicy tuna roll soba noodle  Both rolls disappointing  fundamental test sushi rice  rice breaking apart  taste texture isn't good very poor matter  size horrendous can't cram your mouth chew it  bite but few bites hence falls apart  fish isn't fresh  didn't even finish it  left it  prefer spicy tuna more big rolls  bite size better big rolls  But even then taste texture isn't good  price paid all $30++  Pricey fast food    The place clean  fast food Japanese food  Overall only finish Soba Noodle spicy tuna hungry other worth back  <EOR> I'd give joint 5 stars if everytime walk doesnt smell sewer seriously! selling raw fish bowls your restaurant doesnt smell nice appetite down bit    beside its bomb! fish fresh many selections fair price good gym meal  <EOR> I've read several reviews comparing different poke bowls around valley  Having tried four different locations would say place favorite    To honest simple reason why prefer place over others  it? spicy korean sauce   There Korean version poke bowl  poke bowl but lot lettuce mixed sashimi topped hot sauce  Why am telling this?   The spicy Korean sauce Korean poke bowl come together  Which glue missing poke bowls lot other places  poke without Spicy Korean sauce    preference may be    But none other sauces compare  All poke bowls tried bland   This place only spicy sauce but good variety fish  lot cleaner more upscale some other places visited  If tells much enjoy place think already visited four times past month    So  Try poke bowl spicy sauce  might understand obsession reason why search place versus others  <EOR> I order regular basis   food always really good   portions large ability use lot add ons into your bowl without upcharge   some concerns sushi appears pre packaged stay bowls! <EOR> Besides sushi burrito food truck resides LA big fan sushi burrito bowl hype bloomed all over Vegas  say though See Roll probably only place revisit again until food truck visits town  location very convenient heart South Rainbow!   You choose bowl burrito customize however you'd choose signature bowls  usually order signature salmon bowl  ingredients seem pretty fresh  yet try burritos but sure they're good well! recently added new menu allows your bowl burrito combo comes side which chose lobster popcorn roll  However combo menu all way left side end cashier little weird when you're standing opposite side trying decide order   Their service great too! Highly recommend  <EOR> Loved poke bowls! Great toppings! Just wished little more garlic ponzu sauce add! <EOR> Finally another healthy place neighborhood   fish very fresh   3 different types rice white brown also wild black rice which less carbs then brown   poke bowl spicy tuna salmon   owner also gave sushi sample which also every fresh tasty   <EOR> 3 stars because sever Trianna something couldn't stop talking bf while serving friend LINE  plain rude cut off when can't stop talking video  mean owner didn't seem care guess shouldn't either  Food good   and maybe give another try when she isn't working  lot other places check before coming because noticed scoops lot smaller  <EOR> Menu confusing bit intimidating find what's good without someone guide process but really good liked it    big guy heavier meal wish could more protein provided comes it   But over all lot! <EOR> This place adorable!  The decor cute space plentiful staff friendly much variety!  I reviewing poke  You pick between three different poke bowl sizes  Each bowl varying amount proteins  selected large poke bowl consisted five proteins  Definitely food baby aftwrwards They much variety fish here! Even cajun styled fish   What surprised very generous portions told could select much toppings wanted uh wow? Yay!  They also plenty drinks side items order too  When mean variety place it! Also stamp card every order  10 stamps free medium poke bowl  But can't combine your cards if multiple don't lose yours! say though poke place slightly more pricy some other spots town  But definitely yummy! <EOR> Let start saying actually really love See Roll's food  past three days ordering sushi bowls them but last night last straw  girls front nice whatsoever  horrible customer service  first day cashier nice but girl took order did seem happy help  let pass figuring maybe just those days  second day dined in girls front again nice all  portion size grandmother's bowl significantly smaller all other times ordered and mentioned order LOT weren't enthusiastic help all  gave grandmother attitude wanting bowl to go even though dining but she usually can't finish bowl  Although time she did because again put VERY little serving  The third day absolute worst though those girls front can't bothered smile act friendly manner all  very rude mom  She order twice because she forgot add soup upon ordering first time felt irritated them  also ordered around 9 30 p m  30 mins BEFORE close also felt another reason irritable  But came plenty time before closing way shouldn't matter  restaurant should accommodating guests until very last minute close! came half an hour before! Then noticed girl Shailene Shailyn maybe? packed soup put all soup UPSIDE DOWN  Thankfully didn't spill  But little common sense maybe? Why would anyone pack soup plastic bag upside down? Then didn't even give put any eel sauce japanese lasagna roll deep fried philadelphia roll  Missing eel sauce would acceptable but TWO rolls? clearly rushing through order very careless    This just disappointing hope manager owner addresses customer service girls work front  HORRENDOUS  just day just two days but THREE days straight  There's obviously problem family no longer count ourselves loyal customers until resolved  <EOR> My new favorite sushi spot!! love concept  subway sushi!! pick your bowl size if want rice and 4 choices rice salad greens your sauce toppings your done!! tons choices everything super fresh delicious!!   Their proteins yellowtail ahi albacore Cajun albacore salmon octopus etc   all remember off top head! Then toppings tofu edamame sea weed salad corn cucumber tomato avocado smelt egg dicon root jalapeño sprout much more!! Love place!!! Oh did  mention  staff nice helpful  She let try sauce before selecting super clean!!! <EOR> The verdict still out  interesting concept price portions reasonable  first time here  employees friendly helped decide    I SEE BOWL spicy tuna hand roll  Let's start hand roll  good both looks taste  cold crisp fresh  bowl strange  Lots ingredients  But very cold fact everything seems room temperature  obviously some room concern  All all good experience definitely back try something different  <EOR> Poke spots popping crazy can't all good  didnt quite place name doesn't any sense use yogurt bowls bothers me  But pleased first order To See Bowl black rice service friendly price average  Plus miso soup dispenser  If doesn't excited don't want your friend    As couple other people mentioned set bowls aren't best value because come three proteins DIY large dollar more comes five  less thrilled giant heap salad bottom bowl where soggy under fish sauce   Apparently way things same issue second bowl  also first place seen marinates fish sauce rice which saturates difficult eat chop sticks  Build your own specific avoid issues    Bowls aside also cater grab and go crowd refrigerator rolls bowls individually wrapped nigiri another thing don't understand lots plastic waste made fresh daily  don't remember roll little plain but decently fresh covered sauce   This isn't first pick poke bowl but also last  Whatever sure add miso soup use little dispenser which looks fountain drink station  those house?!  EDIT Adding star  more come more it  still huge fan cups just because pack them full can't move ingredients around mix bites  But fish produce always fresh staff really friendly keep adding more menu  <EOR> This place really really good  Portions great staffs cool love looks inside! Would def more often if lived side  <EOR> Fantastic food quick service friendly staff! <EOR> So really am disappointed write review  routinely came place 1x week sometimes 2x week  point knew combo roll would always order  friendly nod sushi chef cause he recognizes all times here  But sad say bad eel seriously sick three days  couldn't keep anything down  couldn't eat anything solid   Now some might saying should called health department  But trying put place business  Just want business guest aware  said frequent place lot hurt won't ever come back again  To owner chef know hard see everything  But your staff aware shelf life  Cause REALLY hurt business people  <EOR> Where did all poke spots suddenly come from? Man super picky place just good! big fan Poke Express sorry place just does compare    Pro sushi looks decent  tried though   Cons portion size price inconsistency blandness stingy ginger hands mixed approach  Let explain  friend same thing but fish scooper gave generous heaping scoops fish  scooper gave precise line scoops which case tuna ended being 5 tiny pieces  think should consistent    So see roll special  place fish several kinds toppings rice sauce silver mixing bowl proceeded MIX all together big MUSH  looked dog food point  don't see point this? Why place rice bowl then possibly mix fish sauce then place toppings top? Now didn't want eat all rice but no choice since all toppings fish mixed mixture  reminded when kid took mustard egg relish ketchup oatmeal bunch stuff mixed all then dared each other eat it    So she takes mixture places hand back lettuce bowl  Maybe  some people eat poke all mixed but me  just turned off woman mixing smashing ingredients together hands  would great if explained customers notes somehow since most poke places it    It first time let known no suggestions given employees   On taste bland  asked some ginger employee asked gave 2 slices plastic cup  only filled 1 3 cup  When asked little more she filled more piece  didn't think asking full tiny plastic cup ginger big deal    I decided save comments myself asked friend she liked it  She began pour soy sauce top told bland tasteless  did same  would never anywhere else poke  <EOR> Obsessed place! best poke places town  All staff super nice let sample everything before ordering  Try place disappointed! <EOR> 2 stars food but customer service  office wanted some sushi see roll couple times always loved food  Sushi bowls fish always fresh flavors point  suggested place office  Hopped website found menu poke bowl menu  No sushi roll menu  yelp found helper photo sushi menu printed decided orders   Called once opened asked delivery  Girl phone said don't deliver said clearly states your website deliver  response well sometimes manager deliver big order   said well yes huge order 10 people  want bowls sushi  She said well manager isn't isn't possible   Okay   forgiven  hungry point really just wanted order done with    So started state orders she said must ordering old menu  don't those rolls don't even serve albacore anymore   3rd strike  time almost 11 having find another lunch option more 10 people all wanted sushi question  Didn't want argue just ordered she suggested couple bowls still serving   Again just clarification 2 stars website needs updating  Upload all your menus take delivery option  <EOR> This lunch spot   poke bowls best town   Definitely recommend spicy tuna! <EOR> My review restaurant unfortunately 3 stars time   seems every time visit experience gets worse worse really should opposite     When first visited few times really enjoyed place   Loved portions gave loved crab meat avacado masago extra charge your first scoop especially loved only poke bowl place served radish sprouts   Even better plus stamp card    I loved place much filled stamp card two weeks!    After couple months passed realized started being inconsistent portions   never ask extra before because amount put enough   started putting less no choice ask pay extra if wanted more     The last visit few days ago ordered usual   Once again lesser portions   However time when asked usual extra tamago side gave smaller amount usually get   When asking more said going charge me   pointed no extra charge additional tamago   said bowl   Mind tamago poke bowl   am Hawaii no poke bowl comes tamago there   addition if put bowl would still fit   reluctantly told them put bowl then since the rules asked just little side still   going charge but thankfully gentleman register said okay   sure if he manager owner something     All all won't back often considering lot other poke bowl establishments opening up   pros used drive travel Henderson just bowls but now just worth it  <EOR> Favorite place nice people good service great food always greeted smile <EOR> Like chipotle cafe rio but poke bowls  large create your own loaded lots rice toppings  superwhite yellowtail ahi tuna salmon white rice see sauce which taste light soy sauce  try sauces before choose well  actual scoops fish pretty small though only taste somewhat fresh  price great  Service fast friendly interior seating cute  also lots goodies drinks available  only poke bowl places southwest area! <EOR> I think better poke bowl places vegas quite lot if them  sushi made order but always make your own poke bowl  If dont trust your own tastebuds bowl yourself menu poke bowls choose + free tasty miso soup type bowls   many options choose example when choosing base black brown white rice chips salad  always done  black rice furikake top  also tons proteins choose depending size bowl lots protein  3 scoops protein medium 5 large i usually switch between based hungry am   only but protein pretty fresh tasting  most place add all mix ins toppings won't charged extra things seaweed salad masago avocado other poke palces  knocked star price just because gets pretty pricey  place eat everyday  But good thing stamp cards  buy 10 free  Try you'll it! <EOR> Sushi bowls seem popular lately other places serve similar food  place most  know your bowl really good  love all ingredients options have  3 times already past 2 weeks  <EOR> I love See Roll ! never understood name why use Yogurtland cups bowls but food reallyyy good  pre set bowls which comes side unlimited miso soup create your own  really fan miso soup usually just own poke bowl  Plus more toppings when create your own the pre set bowl toppings kinda limited   don't charge extra brown rice avocado  also sell fresh sushi imported snacks drinks  Only thing I'd suggest lowering window thing bit hard ordering communicating back forth maybe just short   Will definitely come back again lunch since super close Brew Tea Bar <EOR> I'm only giving place two star rating because customer service  feel doesn't matter if food OK  If customer service bad then just bad overall  boyfriend gone some food before over friends house  Tell why took 30 minutes just order go?!?!!! wasn't even busy  two cars pulled next I stayed car while he supposedly real quick food left before us  irritated called boyfriend see going on  He said he ordered two bowls go  Then he asked if he could use Yelp check in  15% off combination order roll too  He then asked if he use 15% two combination orders because then he wanted two rolls instead one  told yes he ordered two  Then sure sushi chef still there? When he took LONG two rolls  Did mention waited 30 minutes?! boyfriend said reason why took long because manager chit chatting sushi chef  THEN when he's finally pay manager says he can't use 15% off two combos because only check whatever  poor boyfriend wait long something said would do he wouldn't even ordered rolls if just roll because he felt bad only making one  boyfriend said horrible experience doesn't wanna come again  many other poke places popping also good well! much better customer service  <EOR> I love place always see bowl brown rice  need try another bowls   never bad meal there   I wish open later cause off work right close  <EOR> Good fresh clean reasonably priced   nutshell  them apples! <EOR> I'm seriously obsessed place! sure come least once week  build your own poke bowl amazing unlimited possibilities!

But did look very empty    The food display case    ok  Just ok  price wondering if actually worth it  price around $3 roll 3 bites    $1 a bite   lol    three different rolls tried    Spam Mexican inari     all little sweet side  But plus because if way packaged    Nori super duper fresh  Quality 3 5    Price 2 5   Now onto nitty gritty  actual bowl  special unagi bowl    Medium size  first person took order friendly but he did offer different types rice  Just assumed would want white which kind disappointing would preferred brown black rice  only realized other types rice person behind asked which rice wanted    second person took over bowl complete dud  He just started place items bowl when tried tell didn't want items he just kept going  original guy tell talking him    Seriously right front customer totally when customer speaking just tune them out  How? Especially if right front you   pointed talking instead offering another he just kept putting items there    first guy tell ask if she wants remade   Then dud actually looked made eye contact asked  declined don't wasting food but even all he barely looked barely made eye contact barely asked if wanted other toppings bowl  Service 2 5 very frustrating when person finishing your bowl doesn't even acknowledge you    Quality   2 5  First bite ok  second bite sweeter third bite even sweeter  drowned dish eel sauce  Unagi tender others before    time bottom bowl almost soupy sauce  Definitely good eats   Price   2 5 5 amount food money paid     quite sure worth it    And soda machine even hot tea    only drinks cans bottles     Honestly decor very simplistic tables dirty 11 30am Friday which why sat window  Ambiance 2 5 miso soup dispenser probably best thing here  5 5    i actually really loved soup  Delish!!

Los Angeles poke sushi bowl spots really dialed  But See Roll brink awesomeness poised become gold standard Las Vegas  Definitely try if you've never it  Pretty damn close most perfect 'fast food' meal you'll find  <EOR> I've see roll numerous time   love poke bowls here   usually order large which include 5 proteins   nice selection fishes such salmon super white tuna etc   lasso choose 3 type rices not   Create your own poke bowl brilliant! <EOR> Perhaps should stuck signature bowl rather opting own but poke bowl just wasn't very good  ordered medium $8 something which comes three little scoops fish  fish itself fine salmon ahi hamachi  unagi sauce which good combination every other poke place tried besides one  Toppings free which nice red onion cucumber imitation crab sprouts furikake masago tempura flakes  flavor bowl lacking whatever reason  Probably just bad sauce choice?   Anyway good try place but looking elsewhere poke fix  <EOR> I'm determined try every Poke Bowl spot within 5 miles house place just same others  favorite still Poke Poku because sauces great many options toppings    The downsides started separating lines opposite sides restaurant one sushi bottled drinks bowls   if want both? came bowl but would nice see sushi roll options prior paying  Next oddly sized glass case covers fish toppings  just forehead level 5'5 awkward ordering someone could barely see  paying walk past wall all sushi drinks only seen leaving  If return know where look but newbies keep your eyes open! Lastly folks ordered unenthusiastic didn't offer much explanation  told them first time most interaction when offered sample sauces froze indecisiveness lol Luckily no line perhaps since almost closing   Anywho ordered large 5 small scoops fish plus crab meat cucumber salad  nice variety everything fresh  Food gets solid 4 stars just need find right sauce combination set off  <EOR> Best Poke Bowl Vegas but kind far unless live South West area  Wish could open another close Strip  <EOR> To see roll arguably best poke place Vegas some people     As far value they're pretty cheap poke decent  really just put some additional menu items kale edamame tofu corn  But cons always inconsistent   Almost every time give almost random quantities sides protein  Take example experience asked very little bit imitation crab little bit masago but when finished making bowl entire surface looked carpet masago   aaand imitation crab amounted huge scoop ice cream   I'm sure if communication thing but feels can't really any adjustments order because don't really hear just don't care?  Another thing sort bothers sauce sort drench poke protein which come off much even worse when pour bowl  appetizing having inch liquid bottom poke  Also when add avocado tiny literally even full slice piece    A pro though interior really clean  only issue inside front entrance always smells weird sulfur egg scent  kind unappetizing   But all isn't enough give only 3 stars single reason because experience bad service  wasn't busy time but pretty sure workers bad day when because soon just really rude   After each protein asked even tossed scoops back angrily container  Maybe mad working early disagreement another coworker? way though off putting awkward sort made want eat there    I don't think ever felt awkward ordering food before but rule thumb uninviting environment lot even if food value decent  part atmosphere all    I would give place 4 stars but just don't think when other establishments pokenometry California taste better gives more avocado smells more appetizing inside more consistent   To see good stop potential but just can't say 4 5 star place just yet  <EOR> Great sushi pleasant atmosphere  line wast long  tryt Tuna them ass salt  <EOR> This place!  This place bomb  staff very friendly  always See Bowl  medium fills normally eat lot  place humidifiers around store  Right when walk hit face fresh air! also carry sushi mid soup!

I am never disappointed when come here!! <EOR> This good  second favorite town far out five tried   just quite where I'd give 5 stars   To See Roll actually older more established members poke bowl craze  hit Las Vegas  fairly new plaza Rainbow Badura which surprisingly packed tail end lunch hour today  guess shouldn't surprised considering many other restaurants Cafe Zupas PizzaRev Farmer Boys share parking lot  Fortunately able find spot little circling   The restaurant floor oddly split arrowed signs entrance direct left if just want sushi grab and go food drinks right if want poke bowls but sushi burritos which aren't menu   right waited just few minutes fast moving line place order build your own bowl  model pretty standard numbered step step follows 1 Size  Signature bowls preset designs $9 50 medium $1 20 large bowls but wanted customize own large bowl $10 75 5 protein scoops   also $7 small $8 75 medium which all come differently sized bowls therefore fit less other stuff   2  Base  Sou Brew Tea Bar recommended purple rice actually listed Black RIce it  Brown rice would nice too  White rice probably plain therefore worth if sushi rice See Roll calling theirs sushi rice  might try greens chips future too   3  Side Base  Crab meat cucumber salad  Actually employee asked if wanted both said yes   4 Proteins  noticed point above items going into paper cylindrical bowl separate metal bowl which seen used mixing bowl other similar place  also proved case choices protein tuna salmon yellowtail red snapper super white tuna 5 large size bowl into mixing bowl   5 Sauce  See Sauce asked employee was  Can't remember response fully but think caught words sweet  soy  He also asked if wanted more sauces said no but would probably consider adding touch sesame ginger because they're usually solid flavors have   6 Toppings  green red onions corn masago seaweed salad avocado which employee hand mixed proteins sauce metal bowl  also furikake sesame seeds radish sprouts which all would've nice mix well but oh well whatever  didn't notice ginger anywhere some reason   Everything yummy  black rice nice some bite it  fish fresh cut into decent cubes love super white tuna  yet see anybody else offer super white  even mixing sauce toppings helped distribute flavor pretty evenly pretty much assume off the bat now places which don't going less impressive   I can't quite give 5th star couple reasons  First bowl inherently flawed because hard reach rice bottom bowl early on  means earlier bites more fish toppings heavy later bites little more base heavy  You'd need more flaring top something rice effectively  Oh other reason? Some fish way chewy  think could've red snapper possibly yellowtail but few pieces connective tissue just can't that   To See Roll definitely nice poke bowl spot  best town owing solid ingredients mixing sauce toppings into proteins  also significantly cheaper favorite location which also Rainbow Blvd  now jealous again people live near Rainbow over halfway across town congrats if you're close restaurant   P S  Stamp cards available!
