Where else here? Chinatown    Flock Fowl opened recently found while looking thru Yelp thread notifications  located small old shopping center near SLS I 15   The place small handful tables  place your order counter then grab table  menu small few dishes chef specializes in  ordered Hainan Chicken Rice Fried Cornish Hen Rice   also cup chicken soup 25 cents   meal came around $25 tax tip   meal came pretty quickly which gave enough time grab table enjoy some water any other drink ordered enjoy cute minimalistic decor   food Hainan chicken rice decent  rice pretty good cooked chicken broth moist pretty flavorful  chicken dry pretty good portion   also comes some pickled veges also some salted veges   Finally comes combination sauces soy chili ginger oil    dish OK  Nothing amazing but also nothing really dock for   just felt average  Cornish hen half fried bird same accompaniments Hainan chicken except sauces    Instead spice salt mixture slice lemon sprinkle squeeze your hen   Compared other cornish hen dishes red rice dish also just average  hen dry nor overly oily but also lacked savory finger licking flavor expecting  Same chicken broth  wasn't needed lacked flavor could elevate meal   Overall meal average   Your taste buds satisfied but won't wanting chicken over over again   service good see effort owners put into food but food still just average   Hopefully chef does bit more research perfect flavor because seems almost but still missing special something   The store hours short check before decide head over  Also no restrooms don't come full bladder unless want find restroom store next door  <EOR> I enjoyed small space intimate relationship between food server guest    love authenticity hainanese chicken served perfectly portioned sizes modern on the go city person! Manila Singapore must say  the hainanese chicken lives its historical flavor taste just around world! Global taste restaurant!

But if local I'd probably give them another chance just because staff nice  <EOR> This first time having Hainan Chicken rice  think probably first time having poached chicken  good but favorite  skin kinda creeps but think own issue  deducting any stars because food good think just personal preference  chicken good flavorful easily ate whole dish  really various sauces give mix match  Definitely some very interesting flavors    The absolute standout grilled chicken tender Bao  chicken amazing  good! much those little sticky buns but see why people love them  really liked extras along it  Next time going try grilled chicken tender Hainan rice  might sweet spot!   I also tried very good oolong ice tea  Customer service great  Staff seems very friendly she personally cares if enjoy your food  definitely back try some other items  <EOR> In world vegas Flock Fowl awesome addition neighborhood     Here's had Hainan Chicken w chinese sausage $8 99 +$2 chinese sausage +$0 25 broth excellent dish   tell chose quality ingredients because everything tastes very clean  Since when say chinese food tastes clean ?  very refreshing dish contained perfect amount food   particularly enjoyed garlic sauce though may spicy some   those 626 garlic sauce very similar Litz    which favorite restaurants   also Sweet Soy sauce ask if your taste buds need something sweet spicy   Fried chicken bao chicken fried perfectly   However really made dish tangy slaw     5 stars little oasis Sin City  <EOR> A small specialty menu very popular  much ran chicken wings! Fortunately poached chicken fried chicken tenders very good  <EOR> Great Hainan Chicken! those familiar Savoy's Alhambra CA far better!! But unfortunately charge fee using your credit card  4 star  <EOR> I little downtime exam before needing conference noon decided grab lunch Flock Fowl  exterior glamorous actually little tricky locating shop since approach certain side street   The interior quite lovely though small side  reminded coffee shop even though serves Chinese Singaporean food  only sell few items quick browse menu you'll good go  order counter no waiter waitress service   I ended getting standard Hainanese Chicken Rice you pick four different chicken preparations chose #1 poached   intrigued bao ordered side  also added vegetable day bok choy chicken meal  ended getting meal to go due limited time   The food little pricey but definitely very tasty! Given atmosphere food itself I'd probably consider more fusion restaurant nevertheless certainly worth try!  P S  Flock Fowl only open lunch Tuesday Saturday plan accordingly! <EOR> LQQKing try something new unique but tastes world?  Look no further here!!  Don't forget seek server Liz she's friendly amazing you'll truly fall love! <EOR> Heard great thing place especially wings Doug owner art flavors around corner  around 1  Tried ordering wings but all sold out  guy over counter suggested chicken tenders same sauce turned down quickly  Waitress hostess didn't look happy when tried order food  Busy socializing other coworkers    Order famous hainan chicken instead fried chicken bao  Brought pretty quick  Both orders look super promising  Surprisingly rice way better hainan chicken  Wasn't amazing reviews described  opinion they're good but wouldn't call them best Las Vegas    Ate left  <EOR> Great little restaurant off beaten path   Crazy fresh all organic ingredients!  selection isn't large but well   definitely coming back next time Vegas  <EOR> Yum!!!

didn't allow edges fully crispy  Also batter lacked some flavor  Def worth trying least once   We also ordered Hainam rice Chinese sausage  very rich moist texture  But heavy soy sauce which gives deep brown color  also ordered wings Thai Sriracha flavor  No worries wasn't spicy  very crispy sauce thick caramelized  favorite dish salad roasted chicken  10 different ingredients full off veggies  dressing very light  <EOR> I putting off going place despite its high ratings   Hainan Chicken excellent   Now twice   fried chicken wings outstanding but sausage only so so  <EOR> I headed much anticipated Hainnan chicken rice  place random location quaint  set bit unique order food first cash register then grab seat if available    A friend ordered Hainnan chicken rice side egg Chinese sausage sambal chicken wings bao addition salad    Somehow two gentlemen ordered food getting exact same order Hainnan chicken wings well salad dish prior which lead much confusion    We apology waitress then received orders but couldn't help but notice size chicken 3 4 size table next wings smaller well  salad portion also significantly smaller  Side side bit obvious    The Hainnan chicken itself seemed high quality chicken  portion however small trade off  side sauces came okay     The sambal wings epic fail flavor neither enjoyed even leaving wing behind    The salad dressing flavor really good refreshing  bao nothing rave fried chicken inside mediocre crunch texture flavor unimpressive    All all price bit high everything got  service questionable person running around trying take orders serve customers  only did seem hectic but waitress seemed bit overwhelmed anxious general    Just note no restroom available wash your handsies prior your bowels emptied prior your arrival    The question would return?

No wonder regulars keep coming back! may become myself  <EOR> I craving hainanese chicken really bad found place  Very tasty large portions! would probably share everything  Don't forget egg! <EOR> Finally able try place out  Every table small restaurant taken takeout  famed poached chicken roasted half hen  Found when next customer ordered lucky last poached chicken avail next hour  1pm yes sell early often    Poached definitely better moist accentuated 3 sauces provide  accompanying rice quite flavorful  enjoyed meal but kind mystified all media blogging hype  Yes good but any decent china town country including LV comparable  Maybe plastic fork knife affected experience  <EOR> So simple yet good!   The chicken pretty close perfection  slippery juicy yummy skin   Served rice cooked chicken broth a little salty taste 3 great sauces  Everything plate clearly made love    I'd also recommend splurging getting lap cheung sausage well because doesn't love sausage?
