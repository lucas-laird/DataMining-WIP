GROSSS!!!!!!   Just because incident NEVER going back  They're very welcoming friendly anyway  <EOR> This great place breakfast  Plenty good food friendly service  am sure situations surrounding previous reviews but everyone very nice very attentive  food very good  wife very picky eater just bite she said coming back here  Only two drawbacks mentioned before place deep Mountains Edge  other gravy gravy biscuits little cold time made but good none less  definitely back! <EOR> A nice cozy neighborhood eatery great food service    just tried them first time fish chips hearty beef soup lunch which left thoroughly satisfied  Can't wait try more menu items! <EOR> Worth small ride Summerlin My second favorite breakfast spots Steak eggs best around  Great home friendly service    <EOR> This place sure hidden!! heard place when going through coupons decided try since buy one  Honestly little overdone  place looked cluttered decorations almost overkill    The coffee decent food alright nothing spectacular  service why only getting 3 stars 4    HORRIBLE  server came over table seemed she rush except only 3 other tables there  She took order quick abrupt almost if didn't quick answer she would yell you! She never explained difference between batter bits home fries each just one  She never came back ask doing until end meal when she handed check   I ordered chicken fried steak man pork chops eggs  Both good    said before nothing ordinary definitely bad just memorable  Also only difference between batter bites home fries without peppers onions  WHY called batter bites anyways?? seem should pancakes something BATTER potatoes peppers onions    This place much potential but just missing mark  better service de clutter your brand new restaurant maybe would more inviting want come back  <EOR> Good hearty down home breakky  Exactly wanted begin roadtrip back LA  Andddd u play connect 4 before u go! <EOR> Went breakfast driving many times  Breakfast great  Cute inside  Didn't wait table  special French toast combo food super good  Good service back soon  <EOR> The food good!!! But staff BAD! twice hoping better service   first time female waitress    Very sarcastic   second time guy looked mad because he work day   No smile no enthusiasm serving anything   16 yrs old son ordered fries which he meant FRENCH FRIES but when order came home fries   which son doesn't know anything about   mad waiter said said home fries this!!! Without any offer would French fries instead any other restaurants would do  give them 2 stars just food but service 0 stars   don't know if come back  Maybe    If better self control  <EOR> Must off breakfast  Service negative but busser chef excellent  many breakfast places just regular no excellent service provider  Still Egg works Baby Stacks least server way better taste breakfast nice  <EOR> I love Chicken fried steak  cooked just right plus no should skip Potato soup <EOR> I visited place Saturday morning 9 9 2014 hearing many wonderful things them  ready impressed  didn't mind zig zagging through neighborhoods find them actually enjoyed scavenger hunt  Kudos person thought putting signs road guiding lost people your restaurant! My issue came time sat ourselves down order  weren't welcomes hostess you seat yourself but waiter didn't come good 5 mins place only 4 5 busy tables  When he did show he didn't even look directly  He asked orders construction buddies annoyed dinning there  Exact words today    last time checked polite  wasn't done placing order he moved onto girlfriend place order  interrupted he started walking away ask side item which showed friends plate when food     Little things matter Country Cafe  simply being welcoming guest into establishment long way  Your place grandma's house cute but food ok service sub par  Maybe should target construction workers families neighbors your customer base  better yet rid tall 230 lb dark haired waiter hire well mannered person some hospitality skills replace him  Then maybe some customers would come back  <EOR> Our families cafe?

Take Rainbow take right Blue Diamond then take left Buffalo finally turn left Cactus  restaurant located right end street   My boyfriend read good reviews country fried steak wanted try it  reading menu ended getting country fried chicken because craving fried chicken  boyfriend ordered special which half rack ribs    Our orders came clam chowder must say pretty tasty  bit salty side but might because delicious pieces bacon it    The country fried chicken fried perfection! Battered just right nice juicy inside covered gravy  Honestly best ever had  ribs fall off bone soft just right amount sauce  boyfriend ordered battered cream corn sides interesting  Tasty but tad bit dry    Definitely recommend trying place especially if live around Mountain's Edge  boyfriend normally doesn't care much type food but he impressed I  back sure when we're mood yummy food! further would but well worth it  <EOR> Been couple times since super close where live   little hidden unless live neighborhood probably don't even know there   Food decent especially hot cakes biscuits gravy   They're open lunch but only breakfast   If live area I'd definitely recommend if your looking home cooked breakfast but don't want drive super far! <EOR> Came late breakfast Sunday waited 10 mins seat since fairly crowded ordering took almost full hour before food!
