Next combos normally would drinks along combo least number people serves only one  course ended uo paying more drinks  Then top off charge $2 freaking refill  COME ON!  So then meat gets all sides along two small bowls rice charged extra for  Soup also included asked server says need now? smug way  really???  Then she cooks fried rice end wasnt worth even slightest minute wait bc tasted rotten  Ewwww!   Ill just stick DJK ive been  <EOR> I restaurant but don't few employees  many times always order same thing but later older employee never seen before serves only soup used always two combo BBQ but she told only but see other tables being served two soups same combo ordered  few times would specifically ask actually many soup does come ask other different server everytime ask say only but serve two  particular lady          really don't straight face way she looks feel very uncomfortable! <EOR> This spot off Vegas strip great place Korean BBQ   food awesome because cook yourself  If slow enough staff stops cooks your meat while explaining sauce use meat  kim chee very fresh tasty  Becky waitress she very friendly helpful whenever questions regarding food  Being Hawaii lot Korean BBQ but none type pot stove Honey Pig has  instead your regular yakuniku grill Honey Pig oval shape stone type grill resembles top cover pot  Lol nothing wrong could see  place all eat menu certain times through day regular menu pretty affordable too  Another plus they're open 24 hours day   place must whenever Vegas   <EOR> WAY OVERPRICED!!!! paid $69 00 2 people wasn't even all eat!!!

Korean BBQ 1000% better $17 per person   $35 per person   never again    Someone posted should ask Local Menu     should never ask local menu    <EOR> We Honey Pig last night birthday dinner  gentleman waiter first AWESOME he didn't mind telling everything explaining things were  He even brought special sauce favorite   The food awesome but reason give 3 stars because waiter left end shift young ladies still working gave less stellar service  never water tea refilled stood counter stared good 45 minutes    The food worth though! <EOR> It 11 00 pm We're looking korean bbq open 24 7 looked yelp read some reviews conviced try it  called honeypig asked if still AYCE she said only 10 pm but she suggested combination 2 people worth $42 99  table when looked menu saw combi girl talking about  $42 99 just brisket marinated beef fried rice soup sodas alcohol  asked server lot?

Oh should offer making fried rice leftover meat kimchi but if don't definitely ask your server!   Service inconsistent since usually aren't enough employees amount customers but service button every table which should definitely take advantage because server your table almost instantly    If overlook spotty service slightly high prices fantastic authentic Korean restaurant  <EOR> The worst korean bbq ever had  Meats zero marinade  Bulgogi just meat no marinade  Everything took forever come  Meat served no rice  asked rice came all meat eaten  Soup never arrived despite assurances coming  top all overcharged $20  If want slow service overcharge auto gratuity plain meat should eat here  Imagine eating any asian protein no rice  Complete fail  <EOR> My boyfriend Vegas few days craving some good korean barbecue came place having good experience Honey Pig back Virginia  All Eat lunch both thought great! hour eat anything off AYCE menu ordered brisket beef tenderloin spicy pork spicy chicken ribs boneless   limited variety banchan but lunch understandable  However bean sprouts did taste fresh  meat excellent highly recommend spicy meats more flavorful  brisket nice lean tenderloin very thick filling  enjoyed spicy pork most  service great  However am giving 4 stars because charge any leftovers need sure eat everything order  requested half portion meats could sure would finish overcharged  If you've Honey Pig Virginia Maryland same atmosphere but food slightly different  would say Honey Pig Virginia slightly fresher veggies but might just day  Overall great choice!

SUPER PLUS+++ DO LET YOUR STOMACHS MISS PLACE  Check Honey Pig if you're looking quality quantity! <EOR> The food really good family filled dinner specials  However service isn't great took really long bring food served another table first  basically beg attention service took them while drinks too  Besides service food really good worth going back maybe time just bad luck service  <EOR> Bad service forgot name waiter very rude much communication just more assumption! much selections AYCE Korean BBQ <EOR> For starters I'd just say really optimistic place beginning but pretty turned off handful things    Firstly 4 beverage options  Literally  Coke diet coke sprite unsweetened tea  fan soda normally water lemonade  doesn't lemonade!?!  Secondly when server asking wanted AYCE every time told wanted she basically told no  asked bulgogi she said she bring later because she likes cook non marinated meats first  Then when ask fried rice she says she can't until end    guessing supposed eat rice all itself?   Thirdly portions meat very small finished them quite quickly wait while before any acknowledgement  Mind we're literally only people restaurant   Fourthly server sweeping moping middle handling food without washing hands  use same tongs handle raw meat cooked meat only matter if time before someone gets sick that   So order bulgogi pork belly left  restaurant eating 25 minutes total  never suck crappy service  better service mcdonalds    And no  didn't leave tip  <EOR> Overall very good experience  Meats all tasty restaurant clean well maintained  only down side service little lacking  waiter barely spoke all flag down multiple people water refills  But all all would definitely come back! <EOR> This tough review really could've swung two four star any given hour   Food  4 5 stars   Korean BBQ  meaning meat cooked your table   excellent combo $50 dollars easily fed table three   planety Bancha sp? side dishes came Order  though kind bland   received pork belly pork neck short rib bulgogi a little sweet prime rib   Unlike most KBBQ places servers actually placed everything starting cooking process   Service  2 5 stars   definitely achilles heel   Having read lot review 5 15 PM   excellent service very early going   However more people came staff entirely slammed   good staff   but ENTIRELY understaffed   could easily two more food servers runners all would've busy     Drink 3 stars  Reasonably priced but kind small collection   course Hite beer   Price 3 5 stars  portions pretty darn large   $50 combo served three pretty strong eaters stuffed end   I would certainly return  would try hot pots next time   good place   but definitely cognizant hours go   echo most thers  definite potential 4 5 star  but some problems now keep ceiling low  <EOR> Came visiting another AYCE Kbbq place family frequent Their wait long  made just before 10 AYCE ends 10pm   No wait greeted soon walked in  ordered short ribs brisket always must when eat Kbbq pork belly  Server cooked food very friendly but prefer cook own food  don't meat over cooked  Food great service great  reason 3 tried use 20% off yelp check but told wasn't AYCE doesn't state Yelp  If known don't think would dined there  But Kbbq fix night left full  <EOR> Love food here!  prepared stuff yourself silly!  meats all very tasty   favorite part all side dishes bring out   sure ask thinly sliced pickled diakon circles   don't bring them unless ask them   also barley tea thy serve lue water   This place must anytime come Vegas! <EOR> I surprised place! place isn't affiliated Honey Pig Orange County which say am happy about! main difference between two Honey Pig Las Vegas AYCE option! choose between AYCE premium meats menu  far better OC  While difference when better quality meat am cheap pay 35 40 dollars small tray sliced premium meats Korean restaurant  appetite massive allow myself teased dinky portion grass fed beef! LOL!! F all crap! If want eat some premium meat steak Mastro's Steakhouse order 36 ounce tomahawk ribeye 70 dollars call day  Another thing place cook food you! nice getting type service! definitely regular spot when am Henderson  <EOR> The worst WORST Korean BBQ restaurant Vegas!   The service getting worse worse every time!  4 services talking watching TV during work time They didn't job all     They gave extra briskets instead beef tongues then charged $29 99 !!!  Don't waste your money such bad restaurant! <EOR> Have ever time server told already ate something but really did not?    Yes?you experience Honey Pig    The most bad moment dining life experience?   Very Angry?   Will never again? <EOR> After coming few times decided LOVE set combo brisket pork belly  only problems really service SUPER SLOW ate last night didn't finished food until 6 7 am when 3 4  lady supposed adjust temp flip meat but most brisket burned try eat quickly before other half burned  Oh also add don't give rice add which think sucks because normally just eats Korean meat without rice ?! then asked hot tea never   ordered all food before even beverages! only 3 4 other tables eating but she spent least time tending table  Then last she never even brings bean paste soup combo request when time pay bill  asked bill she didn't even give another 30 mins  finally left when sun coming come car flat tire  Great  wonderful night  anyways 2 stars terrible service but also 2 stars because they're still reliable night owls <EOR> I've many KBBQ restaurants decided give place 3d shot given bad experiences past  place isn't cleanest Which should most important factor food establishment   Given lack cleanliness would think service would it  NOPE!  Spend your money elsewhere  Would back ever  many things complain about    <EOR> I upside down wok looking pan cook in table grill   cook alot more upside down wok!  Overall things different other KBBQ spots let explain      I excited finally try place only cuz family visiting outta town but simply because equipped upside down wok whatever called AYCE!   The water served different cousin knew tho corn water   best served cold  also request regular water     I'm meat lover just wanted crackin brisket already!  But then server puts kimchi bean sprouts pan first    Huh?!?! then she started cooking meat little little  irked me   threw ALL meat pan once save experience little bit very hungry bunch   banchi sides OK best  No doubt AYCE but should just let cook ourselves   meat quality GOOD! Price lower just tad bit Honey Pig more crackin plumber bending down  <EOR> The server glasses RUDE! Poorest server ever had!!! BUG dish serve didn't say sorry all  Service slow ridiculous! Don't there! <EOR> Noticed place leaving Pho 1 same strip mall 100 feet away   Plus banner advertising AYCE dinner special $20  Came group friends family night Really Hungry! Place Nice Server very attentive found table right away  placed orders server prompt bringing many side dishes traditional korean   Also brought Iced Korean Tea pretty darn refreshing!  What all attention Thin Sliced Beef Super Fresh Deli Slice Thin Well marlbled High Quality Taste!  Pork Belly Thick Bacon Strips right amount fat meat give good natural pork flavor  BBQ Ribs Came bathed Marinade Quite Tender Pleasing  *Server only serves meats orders prep cook food table side! dome looks upside down Wok placed middle table thats where magic cooking happens!  A Great Place More Decent Tasting Korean Food Well Decorated Interior Nice Servers Fairly Priced Buffet Special   <EOR> In Land Pig Honey   In word Uneven   I brought friend lives close China Town promised adventure   most part Honey Pig delivered albeit bit so so one    The place recommended two separate friends   fairly lofty expectations   pull into parking lot trash flanks place   companion commented looked fairly consistent trash   something just blew day's breeze something remained     When first arrived inside server must say did fine job manning place all herself 10 tables offered seat table random used salad bowl empty Coke sitting it   friend stared odd arraignment but server never acknowledged them   remained    almost centerpiece table until fifteen minutes into experience when server finally took them away unexplained   The food good Korean BBQ fair   ordered combo's two people which came two types beef fried rice salad soup bean sprouts kimchi   strange part came order salad meat first then kimchi bean sprouts then soup then finally fried rice   odd arraignment but overall decent   The pricing also seemed little off   around $45 two lunch   Its high but guess when most cooking done yourself whole lot waiting financials seemed bit steep   Would take adventure again?  Most definitely   But I'd probably choose table own without strange centerpiece  <EOR> Oh Honey Pig! could you? Raised your prices shrank your menu?  Things free now priced specifically ask? sad   Woonam Jung stole your crown afraid! <EOR> so first time ate didn't order spicy galbi jjim   didn't mistake time     talk mouthful flavor starts off little sweet creeping some spice   3 sweating time all said done place def #1 stop korean food vegas   the service just tad above par korean restaurants   needed when wanted it   def during lunch time avoid any possible busy periods   assume everyone still sleeping hungover when only 1 other group seated   prices reasonable vegas  <EOR> This place great   food always delicious appetizing   locations Spring Mountain Eastern 8th Street Los Angeles   Korean Bbq chain favorites  <EOR> Update 9 4 16 Made before 10pm able AYCE   limifed 2pcs shrimp 1 4oz cut sirloin 1 Kalbi rib but only $24 99 Dinner did 4oz Dak Gui chicken 2 orders oval serving plate Brisket 6oz Bulgogi great marinade!  banchai kimchi bean sprouts grill but removed them because them cold raw   daikon pickled seaweed fish cake salad sweet salty sesame dressing   asked Bibim Bap sauce brisket Dak Gui but abandoned fod brisket favor salt pepper sesame oil dilping sauce bean paste   normally hit 24 7 place dolsot bibim bap but now know AYCE worth except Kalbi rib I'd bump them 5 Stars   But definitely 4 5 stars range me     Lastly staff deserves kudos attending needs despite having packed house!!! <EOR> there very few places authentic korean bbq lot korean friends recommended honey pig all decided once everything its just should waitress cut meat tell when its ready eat even put plate awesome experience   <EOR> Definitely place if you're yourself   came just soft tofu soup only choices kimchi seafood   server argued seafood better beef pork but disagree point since shrimp peeled Korean style dishes Honey Pig no exception little other meat seafood   taste actual soup broth good price $10 ban chahn sufficient not generous but completely lacking    actually wanted some kalbi but made little sense shell $23 person   menu really did any reasonably priced la carte options  <EOR> Tucked away corner shopping center Spring Mountain Rd Decatur Blvd   sure head towards back end area since located right next Big Lots   guess owners extended restaurant adjacent space establishment appears bigger last time here   addition long dining tables because easier cook eat same time those large groups   Don't wrong prefer old setting circular grills but they're relatively uncomfortable bigger parties   Used frequent joint AYCE deal   Since came little 0600 morning order la carte AYCE only served till 2200   however offer large selection combinations that'll easily serve 3 4 people actually having AYCE   opted mushroom beef bulgogi hotpot which quite delicious but found rather sweet due marinade   least server brought few condiments spicier jalapeños chili sauce ground red pepper   First time having ground pepper say certainly brings dish different level   fact probably add everything it'll better   Contrary everyone claims customer service superb!  Perhaps could just Becky other incidents past when service lackluster   she kept refilling banchans without even asking more   also appreciate effort hold conversations despite language barrier   Overall Honey Pig always all time favorite Korean restaurants Las Vegas   Great food quality excellent customer service   definitely recommend place locals tourists alike! <EOR> Staff friendly helpful menu selection  Amazing food choices  food came pretty fast  When did come started cooking front delicious! panchan also great!

He didn't said oh paid correct amount tipped too? made feel trying pay  Then complained only gave $20 tip   I give 3 stars flavors meats sides but need take 2 stars off service   I would suggest order menu la carte instead AYCE you'll probably more satisfied   probably would charged half price considering much ate actually more much wanted give us   If want micromanaged when eating having someone tell much eat AYCE place getting smirk only giving $20 tip then come here   Otherwise many other buffets Vegas much more worth it   AYCE Korean BBQs Los Angeles MUCH BETTER food wise service wise   waitstaff need Customer Service 101 classes   Note 1st less 3 star review 80 written   Definitely worth service others said   Disappointed! <EOR> Worst service long time  Food average best way over priced  <EOR> I came Vegas powerlifting competition craving KBBQ  alright  meat good but felt something missing marinade something  service okay however did take 45 minutes them refill water refill sides wasn't busy all  advise take review grain salt school lot good KBBQ places  <EOR> Not worth spending good AYCE KBBQ $$$ place  family chose restaurant celebrate sister's fifteenth birthday felt robbed  servers kept pushing kimchi bean sprouts placed HUGE amounts grill  hell trying more protein water glasses refilled!

Sooooo 3 years later am honey pig boyfriend loves stuff took place sick     When stepped greeted sat immediately  sat few minutes before waitress Becky came back us   We AYCE we're disappointed Becky never left sides again well ok she did but she always sight   Cutting food giving tips answering wired questions  fact place top 3 most attentive places eat the other 2 if your curious sterling brunch Texas de Brazil    At point owner came checked every table talking hanging some  leaned buzzer accident she hurried over look grave concern it! She nice wall all staff! would defiantly come back fact place going dinning list for when take turns pick where eat <EOR> Dirty flys all over waitress brought 1 menu party 3 she forgot orders food just ok expensive   many better Korean restaurants town  <EOR> A few Honey Pig last night great time minus fact took waitress 20 minutes approach table  did $20 AYCE course did disappoint  didn't anything crazy    just bulgogi pork belly short rib chicken octopus  Personally think just enough banchan waitress did refill bean sprouts even once    Also Honey Pig LA serve sweet rice end which enjoyed quite bit  Vegas Honey Pig didn't that  sure if generally don't just forgot us  husband enjoyed Honey Pig definitely back again soon but without taking LA location first   Mmmmm piggies    <EOR> This used favorite AYCE Korean BBQ spot but unfortunately they've raised prices shrunk menu can't both expect people still love same!!   They also cut down Banchan dishes give well salad  used variety greens but now just lettuce  BOO  Their service praised frowned upon  timely manner your initial order meat arrive shortly BUT see them much afterwards  does matter if busy slow    Their food everything else  pork belly very good! Probably favorite all spots tried town    After seeing prices gone menu shrunk but service improved factors   I probably choose elsewhere if am craving Korean BBQ <EOR> The food tastes amazing!  We pretty much only ones 4pm Saturday   But servers good food tasty!  only speak bulgogi spicy soup though   Next time we'll try pork belly! <EOR> Ok well try impartial even though friend's restaurant   service very friendly however just getting order seemed take bit   Yet service gets lot better   They're always hand kind take requests   say wasn't many side dishes served read Teri C's review   sangchu pa green onion lettuce salad much green onion it   sort wanted eyes tear up   sam gyup sal three layered pork resembles huge bacon type kalbi sal the kalbi bone end tasted really good   insisted eat kalbi first though then fried rice actually fried bibim bbap which didn't understand   Should able eat same time if wanted   Well cook brazier   also serve beer here   Plenty room overall satisfied  <EOR> At first good but now every time back worse worse  last time go   Long story short 2 tables showed 5 minutes food drinks before us  wave down server take order waiting 10 min then she walked away when still trying order figure just order more stuff when she comes back around  Then another 5 minutes different server walks she asked if ordered told yes but need grill would drinks  She comes back drinks  still no grill still waiting food  Finally fed cause waiting longer needed thought waiting longer grill come heat start cooking worth left  tried tell oh food coming ya no thank you  tables eating taking care arrived continue take care them    I keep business hwaro <EOR> What's love all eat perfectly prepared meat??? location okay    Service mediocre but food great  <EOR> My husband came couple weeks ago impressed but think he drinking beforehand because place didnt impress me  waitress Serah came back grill everytime meat needed flipping she cutest thing ever! korean bbq ribs fav but rest meat impressed by    Porkbelly spicy porkbelly kim chi onion salad  give water mixed barley which isnt best tasting but guess if its apart culture give shot  worst place ever but other korean bbq's just exceeded expectations flavor price atmosphere am just comparing other experiences  <EOR> Our first time eating Korean BBQ      Wow!  Great experience!  Becky great host waitress   fact everything done your table really great experience   Yes there's Benihana etc    But $45 plus tip amazingly fresh steak brisket plus all side dishes come it   slow served 4 course meal    Which loved prefer nibble then scarf food   comes large bottle beer small bottle Soju  <EOR> We Saturday night chose all eat course  food bad but service slow stuff handle table  <EOR> I've frequented Honey Pig several occasions few years back friends some good food drinks  Every time though felt waitress would look down if 5 year old child wouldn't matter would say want she would simply ignore it  repetitious experiences stopped visiting until day family moving  poor father sister boyfriend worked sweat all day long without water desert heat decided come Honey Pig since closest Korean restaurant   When walked place busy but packed  asked pick seat given menu iced water start  hallelujah  finished pitcher water faster say Mississippi asked another pitcher water  waitress eagerly answered yes but did budge where she standing  She continued conversation fellow waitress kept giving evil glare hoping she'll feel radiating energy but she didn't  When she finally moved take orders asked water again without apologies asked coworker grab another pitcher us    After waiting good while food finally arrived  bulgogi little dry sweet  Even though moving all day thus starving hesitant finish meal  point dad asked some more lettuce jalapenos no kidding ask 4 times before someone even pretended listen needs  ordered naengmyun must say worst ever tasted let just tell naengmyun fanatic fair share good bad noodles  simply salty nothing more it  must taken three bites before put chopsticks down refused eat any more   I've held tip dependent job since freshman year high school I'd think know good service is  Unless am highly dissatisfied tip least 15% wherever go  However end meal told dad he should only leave $2 tip because less desirable food even more horrible service    I guess if starving week without water I'd rate food decent but simply service would never come back  don't know even entertained idea coming back such horrible experience but know now never again  <EOR> My KBBQ Vegas Hwaro Tofu Hut  Hwaro work packed did want wait opt Honey Pig first time  Honey Pig AYCE $25  AYCE menu did much variety other KBBQ places to  disappointed did come soup steamed eggs most KBBQ places  charged extra top $25 soup $5 egg other items most AYCE comes with  Also only let order 3 items 1 time    When there's already only few items start with  Overall service nice constantly refill your water check you  But price think there's defiantly better KBBQ Vegas cheaper comes more variety  <EOR> Well   it's often place serves AYCE grilled meat disappoint but guess there's first everything    Where should begin? came around 4PM restaurant even half full waited table 15 minutes  When table left alone again 10 minutes  pretty hungry point order bit food  waitress gave stern look told much more your mother's naggy tone kind voice  assured handle it  Classic rule dining customer always right even if wrong  shrugged off    This hasn't first time Korean AYCE style restaurant but interaction earlier guess server took upon herself minds want eat  tried keep pleasant light hearted but she kept getting pushier pushier afternoon on  end dinner paid left decent tip 18% underneath cups  made sure visible doesn't accidentally swept away during table being turned over  car when waitress ran passenger door knocked angrily car door  lowered window asked wrong  astute waitress still huffing puffing angrily said didn't even tip her  calmly said did where was  She then replied Oh    then quickly ran back inside  waited 5 mins see if she would come apologize thought entitled way she acting leaving prints car window    We never return here  Never turned off dinner bad service  known kind service would getting would spent money money's worth smile chocolate shake  <EOR> This meal wonderful surprise  group friends work celebrate birthday  no idea for    We all enjoyed 'All Eat' option good thing did! delighted find array vegetables set before some pickled some not  My favorite pickled radish  server brought round round delicious meat placed cooking surface  take upon yourself move meat around flipping moving around surface  There's serving Kim chi bean sprouts surface entire time  served seasoned brisket pork belly seasoned beef delightful bulgogi spicy chicken   Take your time enjoy everything presented especially things intimidate most  serve most amazing roasted rice tea keep requesting refills  delightfully quenching refreshing brew flavor cleanses palette beautiful way    My tips you Put garlic cloves cooking surface  When grilled amazing  Let beef dark char then let sit sesame oil minute before eating it  pork belly INCREDIBLE when let carmelize both sides  wonderful sesame oil well  end chicken request next round bulgogi fried rice  Let rice sit until think burning then let sit some more  goal rice cooked onto cooking surface  caramelize create most amazingly sticky sweet crispy goodness  You'll use metal spoon some elbow grease scrap surface  worth every little bit effort    At end your meal bring cantaloupe start digestive process    I hope enjoy much did <EOR> Yesssss good  customer service great waiters cook meat you! Something used to  Beef short rib BEST but sure see some meats only ordered once! Only downfall restaurant us  grill itself unique side dishes refilled usual  Pork belly brisket great but aren't marinated  Bulgogi marinated but can't beef short rib which marinated soft  <EOR> I wish could leave real review but didn't even through door  sign says open 24 hours but when showed sign doors locked  workers inside made eye contact multiple times didn't even bother stepping outside saying why closed  tell other guests closed because wouldn't say anything  <EOR> This place awesome! Great food great service  pork belly point! should 3 5 stars! <EOR> This review based purely budae jigae   all meat Honey Pig lovers please don't hate  agree meat good   Quality luncheon meat may sound oxymoron but believe difference between Walmart's Food Club spam Spam spam   airy spongey other dense salty surpise pack meaty goodness   Honey Pig uses former  Also its tubed meats am normally used slices curling boiled   not before  which means bit dried up   Also broth does appear anchovey seaweed broth some places use   broth appears courtesy Lake Mead    Sides very good however  Tasty water kim chi other sides   Great friendly service even 2 am  <EOR> I left cold hungry penniless   My friends mood AYCE Koren BBQ place must try list   Upon walking through door promptly greeted seated toward front restaurant received pitcher water couple menus   Within minutes ordered pork belly spicy pork belly kalbi boneless sirloin I forget called all off AYCE menu   The waitress came back four different banchan sirloin put kim chee sprouts pork belly grill   all downhill   slowly     We devoured pork belly but lady turned fire off kind just sat wondering should do   Meanwhile every time people came through front door wouldn't close   Which meant frigid night air blowing right other tables seated near front   Without complaining kept standing close it   You'd think 20 times doing along other table near us some employee would seen offered fix it   But you'd wrong     Finally nice waitress [the only nice one?] came immediately bombarded requests if she could somehow fix door please start fire again could more food water banchan asked steamed rice   took 15 minutes before ANYONE came within earshot table   Why earth would take 15 minutes water refilled let alone more food?  restaurant right?  serve food right?  Regardless finally able defrost finally some food water!  Woo hoo!    Warning buzz kill coming   halfway through sirloin started wondering when rest food coming   kept wondering until friends stood walked counter ASKED food kalbi spicy pork belly more rice   Shortly thereafter spicy pork arrived   but no rice     Not shortly thereafter friend STAND AGAIN ASK kalbi   time tried smart order three orders   Nope said   could only order per table   Um hello menu does say order but per person   Regardless hungry tired waiting took could get   but no rice   After finishing order kalbi still wanted more   However having sat more 2 hours having only four small orders delivered fed being fed   tired frustrated cold they turned off heat again servers avoiding eye contact us   fact didn't even drop bill   walk counter ASK BILL!!!  Talk insult injury!  Having near door could just walked without paying no would noticed gone       However being people principle paid $60+ dollars food  Then left   to eat somewhere else   Despite having AYCE STILL HUNGRY!!! <EOR> Food just ok overpriced opinion quality  sirloin very fibrous chewy  pork belly also below average The service also very good but busy time under staffed  Waitress almost never checked shot dirty look when pressed table button which completely acceptable Korea  decent sides good atmosphere  alcohol bit pricey compared other restaurants  return  <EOR> TIP If want avoid wait come early lunch  came maybe couple hours opened lunch Saturday almost empty house   Just Los Angeles location relegated circular grill rock solid seats  sure take advantage those seat cushions you'll sure sore butt after!   The concept simple  Order your meats ajumma throw them all grill along bowl kimchi spiced bean sprouts  mainly stuck brisket  Probably best quality more fat them I'd prefer  brisket sliced thin won't run into issue having overly dry rough meat chew on  Once you're done your meat all kimchi spiced bean sprouts mixed rice kimchi fried rice    Naengmyun  ended ordering cold noodles because needed something wasn't heavily greased hot  very picky buckwheat noodles terms texture  some pretty decent naengmyun noodles prepared al dente  hot sauce wasn't overly spicy even kids could enjoy it  noodles topped sliced cucumbers pear meat  half chilled hard boiled egg everything topped sesame seeds  Great flavors perfectly spiced good noodle texture   They nifty coffee machine door  Great ending ultra greasy meal  <EOR> I've died meat heaven    My friends 3 times every time leave restaurant swear myself become vegetarian because swear lord almighty ate least half worlds population beef  BAD   Self loathing deceiving oaths aside place legit meat lovers  thee best korean food joints long time  Everything fresh ohhhh DELICIOUS    Food aside there's waitress sweetest darling ever  She's always happy nice  always give generous amount tip  sure ain't easy being cheesy while working over 300 degree slab metal cutting meat 8 hours      Prices verryyyyy good almost feel bad because well priced  But nonetheless great place great food great service  <EOR> If Vegas love Korean BBQ must visit Honey PIg   amount food ridiculous come hungry   love clay pot grill place food cooked unusual but loved it   Also cook kimchi which also loved  Very warm welcoming people service excellent   must visit destination when come back! <EOR> What's favorite thing Honey Pig ???

Okay dream can't I?? <EOR> Honey Pig first Korean BBQ joints Vegas they've always A OK me    Honey Pig Service servers always friendly but hit miss food service   times service slow appears understaffed time   last visit started off well then late night rush customers came in  didn't see server rest night until waved down close bill   Honey Pig Korean BBQ meat selection limited but quality good   I'd rather limited good quality meats vs bigger selection average meat   Banchan dishes also fresh love they'll cook kimchi bean sprouts grill   quality food stayed consistently good years visits   Honey Pig Ambiance love round Tables circular grill middle   keeps dining experience intimate easier food grill everyone   Minimal decor which fine Honey Pig all business round tables vent fans ceilings   Honey Pig all star restaurants late night eating  1 AM later You'll table quickly quality food similar you'd find during regular business hours   service way but expectations late night adjust  Just A OK during time we're good   Honey Pig delivers there   See late night hours! = <EOR> Entertaining dinner option but staff turned grill off couple times accident  <EOR> Disappointed   Having HP Washington DC huge letdown   server didn't seem great food she kept burning meat never adjusted temp down   marinated beef super dry hard   Overall high quality all way around   Willing give another try but seems better Korean BBQ places area  <EOR> Services nice quick nice quantity food pretty tasty too  all enjoy dinner lol <EOR> Legit k bbq Las Vegas same taste good ole days place gotten down food made luv hooked life <EOR> I'm little perplexed 3 stars average rating nonsense  Honey Pig clearly better that   It's quite some time since done Korean BBQ Vegas but there's no way meat eater resist friend's invitation feast  arrived around 6pm Friday night dinner rush handily  chairs placed fairly close each other purpose would learn later   It fairly obvious la carte pricing AYCE $24 95 all you can eat dinner supposedly 2 hour limit but didn't reach it would way variety's sake  Late night diners should aware although restaurant open 24 7 AYCE only available until 10pm  While only allow maximum portion kalbi beef short ribs portion beef sirloin AYCE other options bulgogi pork belly spicy pork belly spicy squid spicy chicken truly unlimited long don't over order   Before first round brought banchan the ubiquitous sides Korean cuisine which consist bean sprouts mini seafood pancakes pickled veggies spicy cucumbers  table space essentially circular ring surrounds circular grill banchan placed between two us  also provided three dipping sauces my simplistic summary salty sweet spicy bowls white rice   For actual first round threw kimchi bean sprouts onto grill along bulgogi then pork belly bulgogi finished  staged opposite side circular ring didn't way  wouldn't say totally follow through cooking process but come back turn meat  Still feels chopstick your way through any time pull beef early your liking  good thing  should know outer edge grill cook things more slowly relocate food avoid overcooking   Anyway bulgogi pork belly both good although personally preferred somewhat fatty pork belly  sweet dipping sauce worked best both but played around variety's sake   We wanted kalbi beef sirloin second round obliged  Both actually marinated both stay pretty tender long don't leave them grill far long  Yeah may succumbed oversight  least properly cooked pieces tasted great!  Lastly spicy chicken also convinced them mix into order fried rice +$2 95 per person   fried rice exciting because cook grill pick meaty residues preceding deliciousness  certainly delicious overall  admit spicy chicken leftover kimchi bit intense first but easier handle once they'd cooled hot merely warm  Synergistic heat effects know  Anyway did allow box leftovers fried rice containing some chicken point having food next day feels more value even taking time stuff yourself night   Nothing totally mindblowing but everything tasted very good why 5 stars? Well bit nitpicky but disappointed limit two types especially delicious meat  understandable since some people absolutely H A M  food but most places don't limit  Then again somewhat distant memories give impression most AYCE places offer lower quality meats  second issue however lack attention giving more banchan  No server offered bring more banchan server outright said OK more seafood pancakes but never brought seconds   I'll eat around more more informed comparison but very comfortable giving Honey Pig 4 stars decrying ridiculous underrating average Yelper  <EOR> with less 39 reviews far aug 1 2010 joint categorized hidden gem because value quality  you're getting 40 dollar combo dinner pork belly octopus all korean fixins soup fried rice bottle free beer   u share 3 4 people 2 people but pretty much guarantee u wont finish   also fried rice comes end made inverse grill waitress very good cuz rice mixed all fat meats kinda deglazes soaks everything into rice Just want add they're affiliated honey pig LA   LA great both quality value    sidenote cut cook meat urself but would let waitress all work since they're paid tipped this  <EOR> Every time want delicious fun meal friends think Honey Pig Spring Mountain  no means best Korean style food that honor Mr  Tofu book but sure good usually great time    For low $50 3 people dine really filling meal  girls work nice attentive  round table style dining great catching friends over tasty bite pork belly grilled kimchee    I back again again!

Oh should note travel lot work point finding good Korean food every city big small  Trust place awesome! <EOR> Service bad  Only good thing brisket  $26 95 didn't even come ice cream    <EOR> Except bad service unless speak Korean really lucky   Two stars delicious meat unique way doing food! Ill explain below  But two reasons ONLY good things Honey Pig    Service  TERRIBLE  promptly seated greeted side dishes ordered  But barely existed  forgot orders once but twice  waiting maybe 30 40 minutes note actual time    just completely forgot last order waited patiently because thought just cooking still item never arrived asked check where over charged $20  asked corrected took off but still never gave last order  asked if could take last order off bill because somewhere else point no longer wanted eat but manager said no gave food to go bag  Yay    guess    I also asked tea entire table but received 1 cup tea  even jug usually do    just cup  LOL   Anyway looking around seems servers somewhat biased prefer Korean patrons  sure if just server but seems Honey Pig through friends come separate occasions notorious terrible service   Food  GOOD! Great quality meat great marination  love way add bean sprouts kimchee pot even fried rice! Reminds food done actual Korea!  AYCE  should called AAYCE    Almost all eat  $21 but items limited    could only order 1 certain items  Which sucks because could pay same Sura actual ALL eat!   Overall food delicious but service trickery AYCE left hungry upset  Never coming back again  <EOR> The first couple times came loooved it! package deal comes beer sake pork squid soup fried rice etc 4  few times let substitute pork beef YUM YUM  think pork known but such fatty bacon  Once no longer let substitute stopped coming here  particularly sliced garlic bean paste dip meat cook kim chee bean sprouts grill too  love cook fried rice end unique because never seen another place cook way  fried rice mixed all leftover meat gets extra good flavor  comes $20 30 person lot food! <EOR> Food great but service shit here    I give them credit taking reservation although really wasnt needed  For mothers day dinner treating fam AYCE  noticeably short staff which all 3 employees running around serving 10 tables mice maze  entertaining all but really annoyed having ask everything least twice   Anyways food! only serving Kalbi 10 Sirloin 5 but Brisket 7 Bulgogi 9 Pork Belly 7 Spicy Squid 7 Spicy Chicken 6 AYCE  really upset bad Sirloin here  Everything else tasted great!  Thumbs Yua being only really helpful us   mention cute! Call me <EOR> This place several very good dishes few memorable few memorable  did really love grilling onions nice touch servers put everything which nto used also very nice  Classic soju beer you've killer group event  <EOR> This place food memorable me  But remember service bad  The waitress kept insisting cook but problem she didn't cook enough meat  friends wanted cook ourselves but she refused to  It frustrating  <EOR> I've Honey Pig several times AYCE Korean BBQ    Out 3 KBBQs Las Vegas only AYCE where servers actually come around cook your meat which convenient  decent grade meat there's variety order from    The banchans nicely seasoned usually bring Jun korean pancake some cheesy corn which still don't understand why would eat Korean food cheesy corn place grill  also bring plenty kimchi kong namul bean sprouts which they'll grill enjoy meat   At end your meal definitely ask fried rice I think little extra   They'll add rice eggs veggies whip some kimchi fried rice whatever meat still grilling  Yum!  As first AYCE KBBQ discovered Las Vegas would come until discovered Tofu Hut  Honey Pig bit pricier over $25 believe dinner where Tofu Hut $17 also comes favorite steamed egg bean paste soup    Honey Pig good but best opinion  <EOR> When husband said he didn't mind eating Asian food two weeks ago    I totally took advantage it! rarely happens wanted try something new  actually second time Korean BBQ but count first time  first time friend husband friends  all pretty quick chop sticks ended asparagus sliver meat  wasn't ideal situation    I intimidated when first came because read different reviews may ignored because Korean  When walked very nice attentive  put bunch different items front use enhance your meal  didn't know half tried different things  waitress cooked meat short Rib Brisket sprouts Kimchee us    They started some Seaweed soup which little salty   tried mostly all items put front except thing curious about  looked wet coffee beans wanted try them but didn't try next time  meat really savory delicious! enjoyed eating steamed rice sprouts Kimchee  also ordered some Korean fried rice which little different Chinese fried rice  fried rice seaweed looked pieces romaine lettuce different but still good  order dish appreciate taste seaweed    The service great because really took care made sure nothing burning  also understood first time made experience delightful! <EOR> This place disgusting! didn't enjoy place all  servers very rude  servers came table started tossing meat saw very long disgusting hair meat told she acted nothing said she just replace but lost appetite did want eat food anymore  <EOR> It's bad here  Prices quite reasonable compared other Korean places around area U S  general  3 people combo each person gets own soup soft drink  picked soft drink  Ok grill pan different am used seeing Canada  Again place later day 12 pm quite busy  Food bad operated Korean people  place self grill  actually grill food you  it   Their side dishes quite yummy  Decor fancy but clean someways  am guessing most local come eat    Service quite friendly very attentive  need anything right away   There plenty parking outside because located mall  I highly recommend place  <EOR> The fried rice end favourite part dinner! just bad full more couple spoonfuls  really good value far strip! suggest ask pitcher water ice   it gets pretty steamy co scantly cooling myself down refills ice water point just asked pitcher  also want sure ok your clothes smelling fried food! <EOR> I don't think place where Korean BBQ authentic this  very helpful friend could speak Korean waitress  ordered alot meat Beef pork grilled KimChi really good too  Egg soup unexpectedly light fluffy different anything ever before  Overall great experience great meal  Annondale MD but different cause 10 30 night only ones didn't breath cigarette smoke while ate full attention waitress  <EOR> Experience invited come huge group folks   about 20 us  love Korean BBQ won't ever pass invite    Facility seemed very tight  tables packed in  But 2 sides enough room group 20 divided amongst 2 tables    tables chairs even some bench seating  neat part place actual BBQ lid versus grill  Which perfect ending rice    Service When first came sat while until someone brought water helped ourselves  then ask things repeatedly such water napkins jalapeños etc   think need schedule more staff when know large parties scheduled    Food banchan good me   all very sweet only 4 dishes  used many choices much eaten bring seconds thirds  dish emptied wasn't only person disappointed flavors   I start grill some kimchi bean sprouts  didn't really eat because wanted save room meat   The meat very good   started non marinated flavors such brisket which cut very thin good  Then moved pork belly which good!!  Next Kalbi but only serving even though AYCE  last thing tried bulgogi   really enjoyed all meats   wish wasn't full try chicken sirloin squid friends all ate    I love serve lettuce leaves wrap meat brought nice spicy paste not mixed beans when requested   love wrap!  Overall but won't Korean BBQ  If someone else going would tag along because meat good   just prefer more choices banchan good choices   not much sweet stuff  <EOR> For $14 bucks can't expect any better quality  reason why did 2 additional stars because did rice paper!

If Honey Pig eat    ahead because whenever someone tells  touch hot stove  anyways  But just remember when you're paying bill calculating much tip should leave   told so! When came cousins 3 days ago 4 Korean girls working front   asked table sat down checking menus   but soon sat down looked around 2 cousins all noticed 3 4 girls standing counter whispering each other kept glancing over table laughing staring making VERY obvious whispering some crap us  ended making eye contact them girls didn't even bother look away  She stared few seconds then turned head finish working   but whole night she didn't bother come over check us  happened few more times during night  would stop whispering laughing then glancing over every time asked refill some food item! horrible felt disrespected  Coincidentally  restaurant busy 30 minutes later   tables majority groups men coming dine drink beer   7 tables groups men ONLY table 3 girls  whole time only 1 girl decency come over check without calling them while all them would constantly check back forth all tables men  trying judgmental but swear obvious trying please other people for more tips probably   whole experience unprofessional downright disrespectful us   On top bad service far menus   ridiculously overpriced! Now am really big food adventurer work 5 star Japanese restaurant   when comes spending lot money food unfamiliar with  don't mind long its good quality exotic  far Korean BBQ am huge fan therefore tried all Korean BBQ restaurants know Vegas  Honey Pig's all eat $20 which beginning thought decent    BUT everything else over $25 plate! single plate BBQ just raw meat started off $25 simple brisket   Every other type meat including even pork belly $25 more!  My cousins ended getting all eat which $60 + tax 3 people  meat alright nothing different other Korean restaurants  but thing bothered most waitresses portioned servings  each ordered different items all eat list   when told bring plate everything try each   SHE LOOKED CRAZY  mean wtf? We're paying $60 all eat! end she DIDN'T bring all plates only first 4 things asked for   top portions smaller smaller ordered more  unbelievable  point where cousin didn't even want ask more food because girl come back 4 times already  being cheap all eat  assumed  3 girls therefore shouldn't getting same amount table full men  no rice none really full   Overall recommend place if you're looking quality Korean BBQ  nothing special  Tofu Hut AYCE only $14 even Korean BBQ Chinatown plaza which more expensive Tofu Hut    same type meat style cooking     The service  Honey Pig absolutely disgusting  Even if don't AYCE combination dishes ranged $40 2 people increase good $30 3     You're still spending average $25 regardless  bad service too  STRONGLY don't recommend  <EOR> authentic korean BBQ   meat good banchan flavorful but service wasn't good   lady came twice whole dinner    once serve meat second start fried rice end  <EOR> My husband came because hwaro bbq first packed  next closest when arrived considering leaving because parking lot seemed empty maybe only 3 tables here  assumed food must great but tired just wanted eat something stocked around  Boy glad   We famous honeycomb pork Belly avid meat eater only ordered order but more enough mainly due husband eat meat ate side dishes! order comes two slabs pork belly super thick slabs 5 side dishes salad grilled kimchi bean sprout  end your leftover fried rice stovetop grill    Even though place ayce bbq meat quality better  basically pay meat  atmosphere quiet too <EOR> This first time eating Korean BBQ  such good experience since open 24 hours around 2 30am ordered all eat  food taste great but if don't spicy  wouldn't recommend it! <EOR> food good but exceptional  plenty korean bbq places better quality meat selections  but peeved most lying made convention therefore offering ayce option  majority family work hotel industry whether tend hear conventions town  stop lying your customers honeypig!!! <EOR> Okay asked if hated buffets already but different   Honey Pig AYCE Korean buffet BUT and BIG BUT! really all eat   they place few limitations amount request certain items AYCE menu   funny waitress helps cook your food your table regulates your intake micro managing boss!  say funny because all concerned upset style hosting us   expected don't alarmed   Enjoy fact someone watching over cooking while enjoy your company conversations   The best advice give Honey Pig?  additional cost ask them kimchee fried rice once finished your meal   leftover kimchee grill use your fried rice!  OH SO DELICIOUS when eat home next day!  YUM!  All all everything memorable!  If know order haven't served yet ASK!  hold back lot things   We dine whenever visitors Hawaii decide through hotel buffets want something more familiarity Korean food yakiniku something used you    Sadly twice last year during time Honey Pig removed AYCE menus which very strange practice   But during some kind convention town would probably eaten them business!  LOL!  Well least vibe waitress     point shall conclude post new review back alternative   Woo Che AYCE Asian Grill next door   3 stars rating only because kinda selfish   I guess  interpretation having business sense  <EOR> I'll brief  Found hair meat barely any room table service could've better   Ehh   cup tea <EOR> I am conflicted rate Honey Pig  liked quality meat fact basically cook everything you  am huge fan understaffed upcharge items without notice lack kalbi during lunch limitation dinner    We rolled large party 10 sat back  took some time lady start grill  Half party eating while rest waiting start  When began happy food most part  meat could used some seasoning if sesame oil dipping sauce come salt  marinated meat just tasted sweet   Once started attendant started loosen up  didn't eat much asked bill halfway through  threw off she kept offering bring more food if needed  Overall she rather nice but all work errands  Honey Pig decent but other places would first if need Korean BBQ hits  <EOR> Leaving Las Vegas but never forget Honey Pig!

Would consider coming again! <EOR> NOT WORTH MONEY   only order short ribs  charge extra rice    kind shit that? FIRST LAST TIME   satisfying  Tofu hut way better! short ribs rice even all eat  suggest going here  But bright side service good  <EOR> I used frequent place quite often but noticed slight decline quality meats hence less trips Honey Pig   example would marinated short ribs fatty opinion   Also used serve beef tongue which delicious but taken off ayce menu   ayce assortment good usually following sequence brisket sirloin kalbi pork belly   If still hungry recommend bulgogi squid adventurous type   spice level spicy pork belly tad high taste but recommend trying least once!  prepared smell barbecue leaving Honey Pig don't plan going anywhere except home shower your meal! <EOR> It's 12 00am morning 4 tables seated server  waited 20 minute before being seated then another 40 minute before waitress came ask order    Then sister's boyfriend question something menu then waitress said she didn't time answer question she busy serving other diners left us   After another 10 minute waiting come back decided favor leave she indeed busy   Whether food good wouldn't know really waitress fault but restaurant should consider hiring another person help well  <EOR> Not good  always prided myself having iron gut but place broke through battlements  Poor service seafood mushy no taste free ice tea taste bacon very limited sides small salad cabbage bean sprouts but other tables Korean speaking patrons zucchini onions soup other mixed veggies   when asked same blank stares nothing  back  Yucko! <EOR> Expect come hungry when coming portions pretty decent sized per order meat  set menus available also quite big portions well  most part meats above your average AYCE quality meat bad considering price point here  Most side dishes weren't looking appealing taste appearance both little disappointing   Service great servers friendly kept coming back maintain grill ever often cooking flipping meats  service definitely deserves mentioning  <EOR> I've eaten lots korean food all over place great  Kimchee fried rice delicious  40 bucks 2 heaps food bottle soju  1 server lunch time 8 tables she didn't miss beat  <EOR> We first customer Sunday afternoon  food ok environment lively other honey Pig  <EOR> Beef tongue squid must!

Service great always leave full! All eat great quality but price little high  Then again pay for! <EOR> Kimchi loaded MSG Had kimchi ramen   used noodles cups buy Walmart  3 $1     The only good thing thing double boiled good cold  Please avoid place     guess if want quality stuff pay $1 51 more ramen Monta  any other ramen joint LV happens when curious being cheap     <EOR> Meat all good tasty yummy!  EXCEPT super expensive!  Maybe need 12am something  Service good maybe because during expensive non happy hour time cooked cut everything us   Best ribs pork belly YUM! <EOR> THE WORST Korean bbq ever to  don't know if its because weren't Korean really don't even care  noticed most bad reviews larger groups 6 party but again cares excuses  Maybe should've known since Friday night only 2 tables taken probably 15  But name cute generally good reviews yelp  So some overpriced $12 soju retail $3 everyone all eat  guy wouldn't let start w kalbi spicy pork said no brisket because cooks faster  wasn't suggestion he wouldn't let start wanted  brought sides 4 things more regular kim chee radish some kind fermented fish cute little pancakes  selection sucked asked cucumber kim chee she said don't soy sauce potatoes don't more pancakes pls only WTF!  Brisket done bring another pile kim chee bean sprouts cook  Its pretty obvious trying fill cheap sh*t  brought kalbi finally when done asked more told 1 order per person which does say menu  told no 6 ppl amnt brought serving 2 3  didnt say but F*ck that  He back brought more  Yay     I asked shik hye end meal don't   Everyone yelp said best part fried rice your grill  looking forward light end craptastic tunnel  kim chee fried rice ok nothing special  bill which wasn't itemized just bunch prices total asked everything was   Those mofos charged $4 95 x2 fried rice! Maybe back being Korean issue but never saw charge mentioned any other reviews   We paid left w leaving tip  something any normally but really worst dining experience ever had  almost hoped would come running asking tip read other bad reviews place   My suggestion don't bother w honey pig! woo che its same shopping center right off spring mtn its where normally Korean bbq  Its cheaper other prepared food included pick meat want cook want when want it  Service also very nice  trying something new <EOR> Great customer service but food good  Very greasy no flavor but maybe just bad experience <EOR> The mister stopped again last weekend when back town   Ah worth acid reflux     Anyways there's really pretty young waitress working now she speaks English!  Yes!  We dinner paid $19 95 person   doesn't matter if around 3 ish dinner because place knocks!  I want tell all ate but know mixture pork neck pork belly other stuff   waitress nice   only four five meats she enthusiastic getting more us   politely decline since skinny jeans getting increasingly tighter   guess guzzling whole pitcher barley tea wasn't smart either   Oh well!  Come here   worth it   can't wait back! <EOR> Horrible service! never come back again  All yelp friends beware  If your ever vegas don't come unless want leave hungry!!! put 1star rating coz to! <EOR> 11AM 3PM Lunch AYCE $18 3PM 10PM Dinner AYCE $25  Love pork belly beef brisket  normally all now  Everything tastes other honey pigs to  AYCE good deal overall also love fried rice end  <EOR> Meat perfectly marinated decor just right touch  Would highly recommend  <EOR> This favorite Korean BBQ all Vegas  Reminds home  Strongly recommend <EOR> Great place take seasoned veterans newbies Korean bbq   They're always open service great   You'll never leave feeling hungry meat quality above average   Prices also reasonable much food get   Just quality spot all around  <EOR> Hands down best place Vegas genuine Korean style food cooked table friendly Korean ladies    Don't worry if don't speak KoreAn English staff speaks enough    Try Combo dinners ask fried rice after!! <EOR> This such great place! service amazing  Allie server great recommending  She awesome  thanks fantastic service ! <EOR> Better average Korean BBQ  prices good all eat staff always attentive  beef brisket top favs well  Definitely worth money if your mood KBBQ neighborhood  <EOR> The pig go to spot Korean BBQ needs Spring Mountain! many restaurants around America share same name but none them come close Vegas! Ellicott City Maryland  Annandale VA taking you! The AYCE become mythical almost secretive thing place late  Every time come give regular dinner menus w o little AYCE insert  always ask it     They also added few quirks AYCE late 1  need order top menu work your way down  If try skip around cow!               A  theory try fill cheap cuts meat first  notice brisket tongue pork belly top menu  hmm?!?             B  second hopefully true theory because spicy pork kills UFO grill anything cook tastes ashes  Pork cheaper beef first theory may moot    2  Only order sirloin kalbi per person   So technically true AYCE  Quick tip if smile girls bat your eyes such flirtatious way may hook another serving    Sometimes works          I regular menu food namely Kim chee chigae dol sot bi bim bap  Both dishes legit but cost just much AYCE experience  Unless craving Korean pancakes something specific stick AYCE provides best bang buck    Enjoy!   PS Don't forget wear dark clothes because every seat splash zone! <EOR> I lunch didn't want AYCE  just mood some kimchi Korean BBQ Yelp kept telling needed here  went   I walked place empty  Just two waitresses looked crazy when said only party one  waitress sat gave menu but didn't ask if wanted anything drink  When she took order she still didn't ask if wanted anything drink    My food came she still didn't ask if wanted anything  finally ask her  never saw again until time pay  think also confirm service spotty  Maybe just don't care nice    However food made experience  $12 before tax tip  ordered lunch plate meat noodles good  really did enjoy lunch  left satisfied full but crappy service just don't know if would return  <EOR> Overall Honey Pig   wanted try place several times but lot restaurants eventually tried all timing   Anyway fellow Yelper Honey Pig dinner   He wasn't hungry settled something soup menu but hoping order some good olf fashion traditional Bibimbap which menu   debating if hungry enough order AYCE try find something appeals rest menu dinner AYCE   There 2 items only order once basically short rib meat filet no bones deal some other cut meat which can't recall moment    everything cam order lunch AYCE plus      For person think HP's AYCE setup really liking   basically order everything dish same arrangement Tofu House Wooche Sura you plate load whatever suits your fancy   hard finish everything plate plate basis lone AYCE diner unless voracious appetite mine  Even then really pushing try sample everything   Hopefully next time back group divide conquer try each every item including 2 unavailable when went   Pluses 1 If lazy prefer your food cooked place   waitresses all cooking concentrate eating  2 Very good exhaust system  No worries coming smelling BBQ  Very helpful if lunch back work few more hours  3 Reasonable price food overall good  4 special metal pan used BBQ pretty cool food does really stick it   Undecided 1 Teriyaki Chicken does taste would think Teriyaki Chicken taste cooked    basically spicy Korean interpretation which okay  might more if called something else   Minuses 1 some items AYCE menu  2 2 items limited 1 order   Location Very convenient those Chinatown area Spring Mountain  same strip mall Pho 1 WooChe Big Lot   plenty parking although closest ones may readily available when during mainstream lunch dinner times also weekends   They open 24 hours but AYCE only available during certain hours for dinner ends 10pm    4 Yelp stars me   Looking back again maybe more seasoned Honey Pig veterans  <EOR> Huge amounts food  did Combo set B 2 3 people  realistically could fed 3 5 people depending hungry people were  liked being able try new meat parts hadn't before pork neck  favorite sirloin  ban chan kim chi yummy free refills  stuffed couldn't try rice but looked smelled delicious when fried cooktop all meats cooked  seafood pancake could crispier  Good value overall great groups want communal style meals  <EOR> As many yelp friends know am still activist anti discrimination Asian Americans  Many top Asian American elitists members organization meet together once month  99% time meet Sushi Rainbow HONEY PIG  just become spot discuss business  Also consider honorable Mr  Jake Lee quite respected figure LV Asian American community eat show respects him  Mr  Lee respected even Japanese members agency see great role model community   I'm Yakiniku guy  But HONEY PIG only Korean BBQ would prefer over Yakiniku for those know Yakiniku Japanese variation Korean BBQ   Yakiniku restaurants known using very high quality meats but beef HONEY PIG much more tender higher quality even most expensive Yakiniku joints San Diego LA   There lots really good choices LV AYCE Korean BBQ but just can't compare HONEY PIG  Sura also great choice but can't touch PIG   Don't wrong love Sura service really good but HONEY PIG just much more superior quality meats  always perfectly marinaded  hate other Korean BBQ joints town rush preparations meat does full flavor marinade  won't problem PIG      Just let yelpers know can't satisfy Korean customers  bring your Korean friends best Korean restaurant world still give 1 star   Korean's always compare restaurants mother's cooking if doesn't taste Mom's kalbi then officially sucks them  if Korean then maybe don't come here  If Japanese Filipino Chinese Thai Vietnamese etc then come over     Some yelpers claiming staff won't treat well unless Korean   just true  Most very visibly Japanese VIP treatment   don't know maybe just treat good because spend much money   mean if Asian American your household doesn't investments assets worth least over 1 5 million probably should pretty embarrassed call yourself Asian   Mr  Lee does very good job restaurants  see some people wondering if HONEY PIG Los Angeles related location answer brother owns one    All say nothing but respect Mr  Lee HONEY PIG  great restaurant LV  <EOR> Stopped when craving some Korean BBQ  place decent AYCE Korean BBQ huge selection cuts meats  kalbi one fav things eat pork belly short ribs  But best part night might corn dish server made us  corn mayonnaise maybe cheese? f ing fantastic  servers fantastic well  pretty helpless cooking department even making KBBQ! came around cleaned grills flipped meats made sure enough everything  great place Korean BBQ  Definitely come back! <EOR> Went Memorial weekend wife mannnnn loved it  best KBBQ pork ever had  wife Korean she wanted over buffets any casino  must see worth price open 24hrs!!! <EOR> I used come when young because dad knows owner but never came back until around 10 years later  good memories when family decided come excited   First off service  ask girl server three times bring new plates because all dirty  Once fine but really when you're bringing back new plates wouldn't think check? Whatever wasn't courteous enough refrain asking again again bring new ones  All throughout asked them bring bean paste soup soon ready instead later usual said okay  Ultimately forgot over over until finally yelled them brought three bean paste soups well egg  Keep mind babies needed soup eat since can't fed meat ended sleeping time soup egg came out  all already super full soup super salty  only time stayed good service when ordering more alcohol   Now food  brisket worst even if premium combo another additional combo brisket stays memory being worst   usual though but thought more pricier meats would better  Nope  side dishes tasted decent usual honey pig's kimchi bean sprouts delicious well salad  However because meat no bueno place ultimate no   Won't ever back  <EOR> The food awesome but service horrible   used late night restaurant co worker girlfriends work ladies work total byotches   seemed annoyed coming 3 am   but open 24 hrs what's big deal?  Don't want money?  looked friend insane when ordered soju beer   never brought beer because just much alcohol two skinny white girls guess   Also never order wine here   not sure thinking   it tasted pickle juice   Stick Hite   Anyhow earlier mentioned skinny white drinking buddy eve gorgeous husbands ladies totally nice guys didn't believe stories rude waitresses   Needless say am glutton punishment long food delicious   don't care having good service long food cheap great   If expensive would expect little more ass kissing  <EOR> Probably best Korean food ever eaten  Portions huge!! Price excellent! Staff very friendly  definitely visiting again next time come Vegas  <EOR>
