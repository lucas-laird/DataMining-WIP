Loved atmosphere bartender quick drinks strong  Music excellent 100% hip hop loud very bassy  bad only 1 hour   we kicked cuz friend puked bar taking couple shots put wheel chair messenger back hotel room  Luckily she ok    Good times regardless  would definitely back Tao  <EOR> You ever smacked bag accident while playing sports? 100 times night? need work some crowd control strats place  Music OK  Asian Go go girls hot  Drink prices avg Vegas   when could one  Overall repeat venture book  <EOR> Had CES closing party Friday night  However general admission well CES people even majority guess   Overall impression positive interesting place nicely decorated would come again    Got completely packed however  Also little annoyed slow roll out  Doors opened 10pm but much happening beginning except waitress girls imitating dancing elevated surfaces  those attend tables became even quitter  11pm decorations appeared mean girls tubs  midnight first two gogo dancers climbed two big speakers corners dance floor  Strange timing party did really need encouragement point already packed hard walk say dance  Left before 1am know if more later  <EOR> Tao always fun environment club always great! Expensive drinks but  vegas  If your going vegas must try Tao night club! <EOR> I am HUGE fan both TAO Asian Bistro Nightclub   restaurant over the top delicious they've great desserts festive drink menu   dinner choose visit TAO Lounge head TAO Nightclub TAO Beach catch some fresh air escape stuffiness club    The decor Asian inspired very cool eclectic classy   restaurant during dinner best place if you're looking privacy quiet atmosphere private conversation because music pretty loud much going on  private dining areas but those usually reserved VIPs celebrities appearing TAO Nightclub evening call ahead time inquire part restaurant   plus side you've dinner let your server know want into club you'll personally escorted entrance   Although people may complain club 2007 thing remember clubs may come Las Vegas but TAO continues force reckoned when comes delivering top notch celebrity driven events world reknowned DJs its venue    few reviewers mentioned people left TAO behind favor other nightclubs such Marquee but those don't know Marquee owned same team owns TAO which just reaffirms fact TAO paved way some Vegas' hottest clubs today  <EOR> I great time only complaint place bit small gets overwhelming because many people  Thankfully time friends table if dance floor would nightmare  <EOR> Made first trip Tao last Wednesday night   met promoter works pool day   name Darko if happen bump into definetly tell you've heard good things take offer   He told better show just couple guys showed 2 5 girls   Myself buddy hooked 2 free drinks each top shelf long island please! girls open bar Kettle drinks until midnight hard that   The downside place isn't much club least Wednesday   talked bouncer he said its basically club only Friday Saturday nights otherwise usually just lounge   Without free drinks would passed place service bit slow side   Took 15+ minutes drink when seat bar   The decor amazing definately back remember hit club Friday Saturday   However its great place Wednesday until midnight ladies few free drinks hop into cab Pure example  <EOR> The nightclub self very nicely decorated besides better clubs  place overly crowded drinks ridiculously priced music standard bouncers dicks  still made best fun but better options there  <EOR> I really really really club but unfortunately does everyone else  just way crowded here  relatively easily giving call promoters  didn't wait line wraps around upstairs  guess lesson early if you're guestlist eat number someone inside skip line  Although thing made angry two girlfriends pay $20 cover well guys but expected   don't know bf free  shouldn't charging cute girls cover!! Anyway aside pretty good time overall  Try avoid crazy mad house going dance floor next bar many Buddha statues  <EOR> I staying Venetian decided check place since conveniently located hotel  line outside when but bouncer moved front since brought promotional card given hotel  Inside packed full people  good ratio men women  half naked models bath tubs center which thought pretty interesting  drinks well made strong  didn't really music much since lot hip hop but think really just depends night DJ  still good time here  Check especially if staying Venetian  <EOR> I visited Tao five times over years say am really much fan   really don't know don't it   dance floor bar main room does tend very crowded   gave place extra star because ladies bath tubs close being naked without getting arrested  <EOR> I didn't love it    It's exactly expect popular Vegas club given free press because frequented celebrities    Mind beautiful inside drinks pretty good but overcrowded music average line very long  If you're guy aren't coming girls don't pay bouncer forget it  <EOR> We lucky place didn't realise hype around nightclub  Some guy approached Rok night before said he could free entry into Tao he came through us  When four queues into place luckily although wait 15 mins it fault should turned earlier guy could walked through VIP queue free entry place itself decor music really cool   It very crowded obviously bit reputation being 'hot' club therefore people really pushy really drunk meaning if spilled drink weren't even aware did   dancers seems common thing Vegas clubs bars women underwear dancing bar but still unsettles me  just hope those girls paid well because moves busting borderline exotic dancing   In end left early just many loud obnoxious drunk idiotic people venue wasn't worth getting trampled over grown men ogling girls barely college  music place very cool but crowd type wanna hang with  Rok  dance offs don't invade your personal space  <EOR> Worst Vegas experience ever  wait over 1 25 hrs seated 9 45 dinner reservation   Part appeal dinner free admission club but rigamarole parading into club dinner completely negated convenience dining experience   time actually into club crowded couldn't even find bar   All patrons pressed against each other drinks being spilled everyone people being thrown around rag dolls guys getting fights because all jostling pushing even people paid table service looked miserable   30 minutes self preservation instincts kicked decided leave dodging vomit way out   bouncers less gracious even Vegas standards evident no regard crowd control capacity concerns patron safety   Thankfully did pay cover charge       but would worth take owners small claims court back!  The only bright spot food which pretty darn good       but waiting until 11pm eat dinner probably would happy rubber chicken   only give star because am forced give star all       <EOR> Please don't believe hype hottest club Vegas    cluster in   4 5 different lines   guys running show rude signs don't tell anything   Once finally inside club overwhelmingly crowded cannot enjoy yourself   mention pricy!  buddy table service middle action well he paid $900 night stand chair no room anyone completely crowded   place even worth table service <EOR> Went month ago bottle service   right in   6 guys total no girls   no choice      No regrets   All thought worth it   bill came 150$ each but considering skipped line booth 2 bottles worth it    The bottle service great   server stood next tables constantly whatever needed ice cups napkins etc    she would give right away    This nicest most elegant clubbing experience had   Granted only clubbed northwest amazing   Everyone dressed all girls lookin hot    great   The only problem club dance floor tiny   Friday night place packed packed    I would've enjoyed much more if dance floor bigger      If you're Vegas    definitely hit up   When Vegas again definitely again    <EOR> This place way overrated   Don't bother trying unless 1 1 girl guy ratio   Groups guys in   Arrive early don't expect no wait just because hotel guest guest list   Luckily Casino host able no wait no 1 1 rule   When inside already super packed   Wall wall people   Bartenders fast drink waits weren't bad   Other much report   weren't feeling place only stayed hour so  <EOR> More rules moms house  mention extremely odd women's restroom setup  Cool nightclub but lot improvements could happen  Bartenders great! <EOR> Don't waste you're money bottle service Tao VIP section  seen better quality booth seating Denny's  $3000 basically wait line everybody else  roped off area complete joke  Tao allowed ugly fat wanna be's hang area drink booze then 30 minutes seated split section half sat another group  Horrible vibe rude staff!!!

Oh horror! prices! KNOW Vegas but $10 Bud Light? If you're ready laugh check preposterously overpriced bottle menu  lucky enough step open bar ladies which limited mixed well drinks I know using lot quotations but stick   ended paying full price drinks because inattentive often dismissive bartenders seemed mixed well liquor gasoline  Oh those nice couches? Don't comfortable  party moved several times room people wanted pay $900 bottle Grey Goose  The cherry top hot mess incompetent DJ  Bless heart she really tried but any DJ worth salt knows party created beat mixing popular power songs  poor little girl did little more drop song another often top off beats  professional DJ husband near tears time left  I walked past ten better places drink fun just place  Don't mistake  nightclub would far better lose ego embrace intimacy otherwise classy enclave  <EOR> Honestly no idea why people love place  There's hardly any room move all because everyone wants in  club full point would only let outside couldn't even inside  When finally able inside didn't want any more  rooms small dance floors even smaller  club honestly all bottle service  impossible any kind drinks just don't any standing room all  music ok but really expected much them being TAO all   Also warning everyone people smoke inside really hard breath because smoke just hangs air    Overall would say save your money time  all built be  quite sure why celebrities think club hot  Everything over priced music ehh     <EOR> Worst place ever!

She knew right away  She confirmed venue fee bill also tax gratuity  asked explain extra 20% OPEN % charge she couldn't give sensible answer  She kept saying different things gratuity but told already automatic gratuity then she started making excuses waitress probably didn't  know gratuity accidentally charged twice  Right     why waitress initial it  She could tell wasn't buying then said but signed authorized charges correct? just noticing now? When asked manager's info she said she couldn't give because against company policy convenient but manager would reach me  Let's see if management contacts me  holding breath  plan keep Yelpers updated this  <EOR> Only if want drop $1000 bottle service!!!!!! all clubs Vegas days?? only room dance if blow most your mortgage cheap bottle vodka  Otherwise contend very cramped quarters rude drunk patrons bouncers let dozens people cut right front line!!!

almighty guestlist checker clipboard holder couldn't even prices right when he tried mumble pay twent  no forty dollars just in  mention he couldn't even read time own non digital watch    So paid cover charge whatever don't call cheap a$$  upstairs hip hop room start drank on  Everything's okay even though still hated atmosphere place trying enjoy myself    However take phone call hip hop room obvious reasons find out? another meathead bouncer decides block room off all exclusive velvet rope tells can't come cause room now closed  kidding me? wasn't even 1 o'clock yet you're trying tell closed? don't even EDM why would waste time staying only open available room    Essentially wasted hour time plus $40 bucks into something already knew would hate  Thank TAO confirming much hate clubbing much scams clubs general  <EOR> I club boyfriend Friday night  Since came 12am pay full price which completely understandable  stamped hands let in  Sometime during night left club use restroom bouncer wouldn't let back in  security attested fact directed restroom club  But even particular person believe name Justin caucasion male adamant could come back inside club because didn't stamp me  did fact stamp wrist when first paid but he claimed he couldn't see it  Then he say could X which would mean couldn't come back club  he couldn't see entrance stamp but he could somehow X wrist? when knew racist tint claims he just didn't want let club because am African American women  scary part when told just wanted contact boyfriend club ID phone all other items needed carry me  bouncer wouldn't let he wouldn't even boyfriend man racist he didn't even care told just leave  Thank God African American security gaurds let use phone contact boyfriend then came out  But just scary know people still racist  never ever Club Tao again encourage all friends avoid club all costs  post facebook twitter youtube let everyone know racist horrible club is  Vegas good time literally directed leave club because racist bouncer didn't stamp wrist hard enough  never experienced XS Drais Mariquee any other club  All racists need fired   If could give zero star would but doesn't low   I am going post youtube video experience Justin guy people could see actually happened  Thank God Iphone recorders  Oh also last thing add club attracts nastiest perverted men literally pull dicks dance floor  Why can't bouncers protect women sexual harrassment molestation dance floor instead having innocent women sent club hotel walk streets vegas without boyfriends without phones without any money? Most normal bouncers doormen want women safe usually help them if can't reach friends club  still angry thinking this  racist club needs shut down!

What mean packed fish tin  Literally  stuff em place lousy night  club itself beautiful music dance floor perfect but just small amount people let in  Drinks expensive bar very hard bathrooms leave much desired  didn't bottle service but imagine would very expensive    Aside being hotbed asians also lots creepy dudes watching chicks dance  50+ year old sausages just standing sidelines getting jollies watching ocean asians dancing charleston  yes times sausage party    All all check if you're Venetian but sure dinner VIP stamp otherwise you'll waiting line all night  <EOR> Our night Tao started off badly  guest list but kept being boomeranged around bouncer bouncer order in  together people! Organization key!   Once inside can't help but drop your jaw amazing decor big space  main part super crowded couldn't really through anywhere but music great  bar also full but still able drinks easily    There multiple rooms Tao explore! other room equally crowded slightly claustrophobic    The crowd lot fun all sorts people different ages looks really super fun night would definitely come back    Tao Beach also open night really fun well  would love nightclub New York might even inclined pull myself away New York bar circuit into club circuit if something resembled HUGE space    And half naked bathing entrance? Seemed bit random but whatevs    In all great night lots fun management just needs work door organization seemed extremely hectic! <EOR> Their bouncers might roofied date   Was Tao girl some friends   both few drinks but pretty functional   leave around 2am bouncers invited VIP section   let but then asked ID odd since already bar    They took ID then walked bar no explanation   trying cell friends fish bar found absolutely wasted even though only 10 minutes passed   She definitely roofied someone bouncers deliberately separated us   TL DR Tao bouncers separate women groups roofie them  <EOR> By time TAO already midnight  bit worried because lines pay line glist vip pretty long  asked security guys glist line escorted vip line didn't say anything    About 5 mins  later escorted security guys front amazing  thought always VIP bay area didn't expect kind treatment  didn't stay all line course people hating but all well  ^_^  Once walked excited see hot Asian girls tub only saw she looks cold  ended exploring place pretty awesome  just tad disappointed because felt back bay area scenes full Asians  Oh well place packed Tao played great sets danceable tunes    Tao dark cant even see what's front you  just glad staff very nice guide flashlight  course wimpy guys took advantage situation felt hands grabbing thigh walked past by  actually felt sorry those guys   Anyways ditched main room ended another room  friend then asked security if wanted drinks course followed him  thought he taking bar but ended being set Korean club   He brought table full guys  few minutes left desperate    Ended meeting new friends enjoyed TAO didn't purchased any drinks because friends bottle service  Don't forget second floor bathroom  cool see through looking over crowd but once closed frosted  called night 1 30 AM  All can't stand smoke can't breathe  pretty amazing first night  <EOR> This use place Vegas but then started over packing place just lame   layout kinda sucks music alright   probably wouldn't back unless table  <EOR> BEAUTIFUL club! place looks amazing! Drinks typical vegas prices overpriced  Couple different dancefloors if open tao beach night definitely check out! just crowd always really Asian? Maybe because Asian notice but swear every time come its flooded Asians!!! Real talk  heart Asians but prefer more diverse crowd  Nonetheless Tao still great club hit Vegas good time! <EOR> We party 14 dinner TAO restaurant together Thanksgiving weekend Vegas different parts country  Dinner ok overpriced but food decent  wanted some pictures remember camera me    If dinner restaurant free admission club part still stand line your ID checked   Our turn line comes check IDs then bouncers said want check camera coatcheck   asked why all can't camera club nowhere did say everyone taking pictures smart phones   walk over coatcheck guy said don't take camera's great  Finally hide camera girls bags sneak in   We came ordered drinks 10 minutes later several other people asked give couch seats because section wasn't full enough closing off    All attitude if doing favor allowing all   Meanwhile good size line outside club   We travel often many upscale clubs lounges Tao definitely them all restaurants clubs Vegas Tao worth your consideration  <EOR> PLEASE BEWARE!!! wish option give negative stars!!

Those guys lied me?   Jake really cool promotions guy approached Lindsey street early last Saturday asked if wanted VIP entrance into Tao 10 pm open bar   thinking 2 nanoseconds eagerly agreed   dinner reservations Tao 11 pm figured could few free drinks before being seated downstairs    After calling Tao confirm promoter legit although wasn't concerned since Mama taught disable taillights when trapped inside predator's trunk Lindsey brought sexy selves Girl's Only VIP line   received wristbands quickly ushered past least hundred clubgoers waiting some people wait all night never permitted entry      At bars 3 main level few the beach upstairs bartender sadly informed best could free drink wristband Skyy Red Bull   Expecting slap face high maintenance friends instead he received squeals delight   Obviously he isn't aware we're girls prefer top shelf but just happy shotgunning beers tailgate party   After delicious dinner Tao review follow effortlessly re entered club upstairs   three dance areas large main floor side room upstairs the beach  Beware single man groups guys send find cute girls drag back table lair caveman style   Being female only group although male co worker mine running around place kid candy store allowed receive ultimate VIP treatment sexy see scene club   nice having men suits repeatedly request your presence special tables VIP rooms curtains but when men's faces resemble SNL skit where cousins breed each other spawn deformed offspring   Also married men prove still proved little trying   Come guys think don't notice keeping your left hands your pockets excusing yourselves restroom coming back gesturing tan lined finger?

Con Beware open bar disgusting generic Vodka gave massive hang over next day   Place packed 12pm dancing shoulder shoulder    Conclusion need Tao if Vegas  Tao truly unique clubbing experience  <EOR> They RACIALLY PROFILE YOUNG BLACK WOMEN  family came guest list escorted FIVE security officers because pulled down skirt while walking down steps  Small dance floor edm music  <EOR> Tao   the professional reviewers stated place cost 25 million dollars build   When first walk place quite impressive   naked girls getting pruney bathtub candles nice touch   giant Buddha insulting all Buddhist quite ridiculous considering Buddha god some religion put place debauchery taken place utter most decadence   Again digress     The place huge two main rooms over stuff high ceilings other over stuff little AC take your pick   music jamming mixes point   crowd your typical Vegas crowd mixed your travel bunch Asian Night p s  am over scene    yes am Asian am over whole Asian scene   However place pretty mix did good time would consider going back only VIP am sure anyone could wait line   insanely long  <EOR> Seriously Tao     I've jones you   love your frame   love your name   love your game   Saturday night celebrate boy Edwin's 29th   kind epic night   intentions going another club afterwards but love Tao strong   grabbed onto didn't let go   First off strongly encourage reserve table weekend   You'll save yourself torment waiting hours line   When came escalator saw hundreds people line Tao   haven't seen line long since Disney World   course didn't wait line   Once established ourselves led into club immediately   Even ahead those tables   where boys' connection comes in   type connection most may never but still highly advise bottle service   Our table center club overlooking dance floor wannabee go go dancers aka drunk chicks no beat   attendants ridiculously gracious attentive   definitely made all feel million bucks   I know lot people knock Tao because overcrowded dance floor bars restrooms   But if you're VIP don't worry any that   Well   except restroom   And definitely difference between VIP passes VIP table bottle service   latter really where need be   Waiting line isn't me   We through several magnum bottles Goose several bottles Jagermeister   bill came several thousand bucks   worth it?  Abso freakin lutely!!!!!  haven't much fun long time   memorable night indeed   I love you    <EOR> Again high expectations  design beautiful  balcony breathtaking  dancing if any horrible  no room  actually really upset because wanted enjoy but literally shoulder shoulder  fun bartenders friendly  place needs bit moremanagement but say making money because place super packed  <EOR> Staying Venetian Tyga town? win  hooked bottle service shoutouts Chris Ca$h   I'll straight point service amazing  hope whoever paying Marcus associates TAO gets raise because he sure does bust ass off dim night setting    First impression sold would definitely bottle service again when am back Vegas   Charmaine Mateo cocktail server excellent well  Top notch service again   Will back! <EOR> I place just fine  Definitely serves its purpose well  Unlike some Yelpers never waited longer few minutes VIP line guess depends working door night  also its easy find promoter place free entry    Some quirky things place just odd separate entrance restaurant but only actual doors separate  Once pass door hallways just guides into dining area restaurant  walk through good portion restaurant before reach stairs take club  aren't any signs easily visible if you've never you'll probably lost  hope find waiter quickly ask directions  club good size but movement all messed due big VIP area can't walk through  Also when dance floor gets busy isn't very practical walk through if you're trying across you're left two small walkways far sides club  configuration feel you're horse racetrack running around perimeter club   But always great bartenders unlike other places never wait more 2 3 minutes drink here  also small balcony area when people aren't smoking nice spot away crowd bit   Finally place showed brother great time 21st birthday few weeks ago complete party favors confetti  great introduction turning 21 Vegas parties  Thanks Tao! <EOR> Fact am Asian Fact Tao Asian Fiction Tao full only asians   My friends looking big night called around seeing sort deals bottles could guy girl ratio really bad   Marquee kaskade playing hook said would near impossible break your balls expensive table night   friend called another connection tao great deal   won't expand extravagance alcohol tab but let's just say am very happy made back own hotel room night   It first time tao blast music banging table hot spot first   weren't complaining just asked spot hour prior actually arriving   But host told spot opened right edge dance floor Shazam right mix all action    This place Asian themed yes lot asians but quite mix well   your typical over crowded alcohol infused club but definitely great time there  know did  know everyone thinks Tao washed XS Tryst Marquee Haze spots but Tao still happenin' its dead all means   Next time vegas Tao better watch out  <EOR> A good Vegas club  favorite but did fun  played good mix club hip hop music kept dancing most night    It crowded especially when celebrity there  When February 2012 Lil John happened too  He vip area dance floor made area very crowded  <EOR> Eh     Came because companion's company having some sort party end convention thing  Waiters walking around trays food starving spent bulk beginning night stalking waiters trying food  food decent but nothing special  few mini burgers skewered fish some other unmemorable stuff  couldn't partake chicken sate because allergic peanuts but  own fault   open bar party took advantage pounding some diet cuba libres rum coke tao tinis dunno into drink but powerful delicious   took little trip onto balcony but way hot snapped couple pictures then right back into much needed air conditioned area   There plenty seating little private booths tables well bunch U shaped L shaped sofas bar area  music decent  DJ played lot mainstream stuff and stuff find overplayed   few trying convince play some house electronic music but he coward afraid crowd would lose interest music deem bad DJ  He did drop few favorites later night give credit that   Anyway once club opened general public nuts  freaking crowded hated it  spilled multiple times even sloppy people but sheer volume people rendered impossible hold glass without spraying contents all over innocent bystanders  party people booked private spot balcony which nice but messy because drunk people know spill double negative meaning drunk people spill all over place   mean granted club museum course Vegas but c'mon people  Let's least ounce class grace   Worst part crowdedness bathroom situation  Boys lucky because boys pee quickly there's good turnover male restroom  Sucks girl because instead large female restroom 5 6 individual bathrooms toilet sink  cool first because doors special fog stuff where see through door when open but soon close fogs gives privacy  However once line started long horrible  course all chicks take thousand years bathroom because pee wipe wash hands check makeup check hair sure outfit still tact etc  wish express line something bathroom without mirror people just wanna business out   I can't comment pricing because didn't pay anything all night but can't imagine place cheap  Boys prepare your wallets girls pump charm score some free drinks   All all v  two sided experience  Fun first disastrous end  <EOR> Went September 2007 when Nas having birthday party   My boyfriend time staying Venetian express entry no cover   very happy because line outside really long wrapped around staircase escalator area back through door outside area     I Tao multi level every level different feel   Most time spent dancing main dancefloor second level   did however decorations first floor but seemed more lounge area down there   second floor where dancing EXTREMELY crowded   barely any room dance but didn't mind being pressed against guy part DID mind being pressed against someone else too   felt part sandwich   Other music danceable Nas seemed good time well there's plenty areas step outside fresh air service bar pretty timely   interesting point club women's washrooms all clear glass doors first but soon lock door glass door becomes frosted your instant privacy   thought pretty entertaining    <EOR> I also ate Tao goodness barely barely offsets horror its nightclub enough starts    The food incredibly expensive but delicious  lobster dumplings pad thai both great  friends all ordered sea bass fillet Mignon  forced them let bite also amazing  Dessert lava cake chocolate spring rolls fortune cookie even though full forced myself keep eating    Our waiter funny good recommendations menu  yeah  Dining hit wallet but made tummy happy   Our dinner reservation included priority entrance club upstairs  club made no party happy    I'd wager 90% club's real estate devoted bottle service  don't know if having bottle service would place more fun because didn't want it  Vegas bachelorette party just wanted club hopping whoooo we're going dancing Vegas! experience    Incidentally cannot experience Tao because Tao where Whoooo we're going dancing feeling die    The non bottle service areas belong overcrowded hallways tiny little dance floor  logistics floor genius exit Tao must cross dance floor  Looking exit strategy across akin think Moses felt when he first looked Red Sea eff across thing?! awful set only people looking run away better club but also those decide squeeze onto dance floor actually dance  prepared inevitabilities someone shoved into if mosh pit  girl step your feet heels  smashed against your friends strangers such close proximity could labeled extremely intimate  Vegas packed clubs packed restaurants  No matter good dinner would pick any those places over Tao every time    I'd probably more fun  <EOR> Best clubbing night Vegas Bachelorette! much fun! Friday night free because list thanks friends FreeVegasClubPasses right front line headed upstairs party  All friends ordered drinks few sips those puppies STRONG! When didn't order drink bartender poured water ice free charge without being asked told good evening  sweet! music great crowd great ambiance great only problem danced almost two hours heels walking down those marble stairs liiiiitle bit dicy!

We 11 wasn't crowded thought all yelp reviews read prior coming overexaggerations  Half hour later though place PACKED  felt squished being shoved all over place shoving others also  Doesn't help dance floor size kitchen  sure why because club definitely seems spacious seems could accommodate more if made dance floor larger  also two bars other side club two separate rooms which nice quickness getting drinks but seemed little unnecessary since far form dance floor    What turned off even more club music  DJ terrible opinion  He played music definitely club music didn't even try club music  no transitions between songs would slight awkward silences  felt listening someone's iPod shuffle  just couldn't into totally feeling it  Others liked but sure piss drunk especially sloppy drunk girls think know hiphop    Interestingly also older scene club  definitely saw people old enough parents little strange  other big demographic would bachelorette parties large groups girls  Single guys tho don't come because girls pulled stage just end dancing each other since no guys allowed there    The highlight inside club bartender because she very sweet friendly much other interactions people work Tao    I probably wouldn't come again especially if pay  crowded music sucks  If want good hip hop club vegas check Heart Club Omnia Caesars Palace  <EOR> Came Thursday 4 25 2013 around 11 PM lines very short walked right free since list  pleasantly surprised spacious place was  First time lower level more Lounge Area then some stairs main room which pretty packed which don't mind   Cons DRESS CODE DRESS CODE!!! saw some people t shirts sneakers  Idk if those ballers afford table however want but dont expect all fancy if your going enforce dress code  Bartenders entrance really RUDE! some white blond chick which asked drink recommendation she just blew off  Sorry no Tip then! little balcony outside very tight mean view but its small  Once again those Table clubs dance floor small gets packed soon  OH! if your dancing outside dance floor area guards tell stop  Weird!

The professional dancers elevated able crowd jaw dropping ladies splashing around topless tub certainly peaked interest Vegas offer  DJ solid place swarming photographers lively crowd    My only gripe many horrifically offensive young ladies grinding attempting sexy elevated bar area  women patrons club no issue showing off lady parts when no business doing so  Trust sweetheart    don't need see Britney bandage dress around 3 sizes small you  Thank goodness security finally removed them dance area     unfortunately many clones throughout night    The rest crowd actual dance floor throughout massive club all good  Although certainly more ladies club compared men  LAX seemed more even ratio?  I would definitely come back Tao again  <EOR> If club while Vegas then TAO place must check out   Asian themed decor gorgeous looking waitresses TAO best night clubs Vegas   Only Pure Caesars would rate better IMHO   Getting table service quite expensive depending lavish party   table main dance floor few grand easy your party better equal ratio male female cause give problems if plan bringing sausage fest   also recommend handle table details before getting club save yourself any headaches   When partying Vegas don't cheap   VIP table your friends   only way cause don't wait long ass line place your crew chill sit   But because imposed Man tax find many attractive women inside TAO perhaps many others find Happy Ending place advertises   know During summer time open TAO beach area which VIP tables located outside patio which view Vegas strip   But leave more detailed review   Van Man's Must try those ladies tubs throughout club  <EOR> Club might ok but only if in    promoters bouncers suck  heard other friends incident only one   *Edit really early bad  guess bouncers aren't tired pissy yet  group 14 even guy hot girls _^ 9 30 Saturday night  hotel guest seperate line checked room keys cover free  Remember dress code strictly enforced  guest list but before 9 30 helps girl    What rip    totally try scam show little respect your business  understand no matter hot Vegas clubs going business    if yours someone else's  But really treat some decency customers   So Vegas bachlorette weekend  stay suite Venetian planned main dinner Toa restaurant bottle service Toa nightclub  planned all months advanced Venetian promoter    Saturday night hits verify 7 pm dinner reservation calling restaurant 4  lost dinner reservations basically said SOL w o any appology good explaination saying new reservation 9 45 seating  opted ditch restaurant just stay roomsevice invited everyone room food drinks    We hit club around 10  2 extra guest called added Friday night  promoter said wasn't problem add 2 more she would update list  No go    she didn't update bouncer door said many people said if wanted 2 would buy 4th bottle    O_O     argued noting made agreement 3 bottles well advanced called perviously additions which time nothing noted any changes service  Money issue  attitude principle was  asked talk promoter worked with  took 30 mins hold promoter  She didn't even come speak bouncer discussed things phone  He finally said Ok we'll let in  takes another 10mins let in    We seated  15mins into another host tries seat another group other half booth   trouble downstairs annoied even more  group 17 girls no way could sit comfortably area another party other side first introduced area  noted hostess mistake she politely talked other host appologized us  She first accomodating person met whole nite    The rest night fabulous drunken party bachlorette fun tried shield troubles earlier evening  ended buying 4th bottle  But said money attitude gave us    Yes layout club little odd  seated table Tao beach near pools which good least roof air circulation even though hot F September  bathrooms also trek across whole pool area which quite big if you've never Venitian pools   also quite trek stairs pool area main club entrance inside dance floor  nice lighting decor  Good looking people  table hostess actually really nice  music moderate    good beats overall but bit much house group's taste    but  just upstairs Toa beach area  Because flights stairs risk tumbling drunkenly down them ended going down main club area    If weren't bachlorette number people group would ditched place account horrible service except table hostess   <EOR> Nightclub review only Came w best friends bday where met w cousin friend   Luckily knew bouncers faster everyone else because line ridiculously long   think would've never made if hadn't connection  Tao already looked lot fun based many people waiting in   We inside before 11pm girls sky vodka drinks shots free w wristband til then   really crowded dance floor bar bathroom etc  but I'd say  sign popular night club   drinks good bartenders really fast getting drinks   music good dance floors pretty big     You know bathroom all those little bottles perfume lotions gum etc use?

He definitely best! = Females open bar around 10 30pm 11 00pm now   I know changed 10 00pm 11pm but ok! bartenders definitely hook ladies! Males usually pay $20 $50 can more pricey if celebrities depending if men women    I know politics    Hate it   But yes people tend shallow but definitely fun nightclub!   The nightclub definitely gets packed around 11pm remember early!!! Trust me! line ridiculously long! tend let female groups 10pm males   good luck!   The bartenders very sweet nice well servers!   There isn't much sitting room except when front club then two benches  ladies if your feet hurt your heels spot where should be!

Well okay did play some Top 40 Hip Hip 1 2 years ago  two hours waited line didnt help cause either  I'd say if you're Iowa first time Vegas all means check club good time  If you've Vegas before and or you've clubbin NY LA SF just skip nightclub just eat here! <EOR> Asian themed  hip hop night when looking forward fabulous performed   venue itself pretty nice outdoor area amazing view  staff bit rude top off fight broke off during event  Drinks just much any other nightclub Vegas   gets densely packed there!  Barely walk anywhere dance  type crowd specially being EDM head    Might back tao knows   <EOR> Am only thinks Vegas night clubs totally overrated? Tao perfect example why prefer avoiding them  First politics getting in  some friends worked connections group free but lucky ones  usual $20 25 cover charge long line going and any vegas club daunting  could drink hotel bar no cover charge probably better time   Second crowd  Tao takes two floors  first floor traditional night club multiple rooms containing bars dance floors  decided opt buying bottle service because didn't stuck fighting through crowds  Forget dancing    would need space apparently space only given those afford bottle service    The second floor Tao Beach which basically roof deck outdoor lounging areas pool bar  preferred location because less crowded but because still 100+ degrees evening    wasn't most ideal place hang out    Overall music so so crowd eh place would vote visit again  <EOR> This place lost lack luster given XS Surrender probably newer spots hit up   I'll separate reviews between Tao Asian Bistro Nightclub TAO Beach even though they're technically same   strictly ambiance DJ'ing Dance floor   It red dark yellow hints purple  Getting groped grazing every single body part possible name game  Going through TAO navigating through sea zombies except they're wearing sexy or slutty attire depending your alcohol vision  Douchebags weren't big problem when bouncers actually pretty chill    The DJ played non stop mash ups Top 40 drum bass song every 10 minutes set  far having space your friends dance  Girls actively utilize Spartan cock block formation ie guys serving shields barricade shape said dance area women center lick grind pop pancake booties no other your own pleasure viewing    I probably experienced five minutes blue balls rest being nothing but fist pumping or karate chopping if you're Asian win  you're probably thinking why imperfect rating?

shunned bartenders no reason couldn't drink  Avoid club all cost better club Hakassan XS Omnia    First all Venue looks darker version P F  Chang's music kinda trend  much EDM  More top charts  90's 10's ranging pop hiphop  vibe crowd pretty ghetto  only reason why came because staying Venetian wanted check closest venue  arrived early 10 pm decided some drinks hoping better DJ show later  2 3 groups before all patiently waited bartender  ID credit card cash ready hand thought someone come soon  But nothing happened 10 minutes    There male bartender right front making drinks calculating bills other patrons  started bad feeling when he refused any eye contacts any us  He took extra effort looking beyond staring ceiling some point while making drinks front us  hoped instinct wrong but became obvious being ignored purposely because he did answer any questions drinks happy hours  Then decided serve group arrived later us  even told before but he didn't seem care    After wasting time female bartender next she also managed ignore good 5 minutes until all waved cards her  Thankfully she responded call but then acted she couldn't understand any words treated if foreigners  simply asked if 2 mojitos 1 martini she kept saying what? even though know speak Spanish  several attempts she told bar doesn't carry mojito  immediately realized BS because dinner TAO restaurant downstairs saw other people having mojito  understand restaurant club bar separate business might different menu but kind bar does mojito? even checked yelp reviews! bartenders just did want see all  But reason? know did wrong except being only Asian girls around bar    Then asked question happy hours drinks menu she said bar just ended happy hour  Both male female bartender knew waited them very long  infuriated most both smirked seeing shocked expression female bartender immediately other customers without asking any further question if worth business  left club immediately horrendous encounter bartenders    I've many other clubs bars far worst experience ever  all felt discriminated feeling ruined entire night Vegas  Please educate your bartender other staffs treat people equally  leaving club read reviews other yelpers think no coincident certain people giving low ratings  Don't fooled fancy Venetian Hotel  club inside classy all  <EOR> I Tao little midnight line wasn't long  Because local able free  music amazing though dance floor crowded managed find spot rails only cool breeze but wasn't packed people   Every time Tao good time  <EOR> I recently sister's bachelorette party  weren't VIP guest list anything but still walked without having wait line pay cover charge    If don't waiting long ass line paying into club must girls  Preferably hot girls   If you're guy try surround yourself many girls can  If won't buddy   Tao both indoor outdoor areas  outdoor area called Tao Beach  kinda feels you're tropical island tables galore  Overall very fun place    Oh great music too! <EOR> My second favorite club Vegas   would've given 5 stars but everytime come just always crowded   crowded could barely move   stepped spilled drink many times   think just need bigger dance floor   Thumbs music   Another club sure everytime city   But maybe next time weeknight avoid stupid crazy crowd  <EOR> Great music spins hiphop top 40 which quite break house everywhere else Vegas  Loved 2nd floor back bar spinning old school hiphop DJ fantastic  Club stunning large though isn't outdoors area XS Surrender  Friend worked promoter Thisoo group 5 girls 3 guys free open bar until 11pm  Bouncers professional  <EOR> My friends Tao just before 11PM   Did wait?

Almost  why mixed bag? Let's dig in   The decor interior luscious quite surprise let's say expected  dined then club review both   The service restaurant bar none thanks enthusiastic waiter  kept reservation opening late dinner until 1am huge plus  food surprisingly good being asian eating asian food Vegas  liked greasy which more important authenticity  service prompt good selection less expensive wines    The club  Pros great people good eye candy way crowded which plus minus good energy  Cons space wasnt very big main room you'll tolerate music if aint feeling it  music weekend top 40 hip hop occasional sprinkling rock    I would say crowd dancers energy Tao Tao  Definitely no turn off guys groping around night which kept classy girls all decked ready party priceless  <EOR> I'd give tao 3 1 2 stars if could but just don't think quite worth four stars   Came vegas 21st birthday guestlist tao  lines well organized which plus wait 15min   girl friend free while guy friend $30   Inside girl friend free drinks bar 10 30 11 30 which awesome but bartender spilt full drink decor tao pretty sick but rather dark crowded   Overall liked but think overrated considering all hype gets  <EOR> More 3 5  We hotel guests able pass line pay cover charge!! Great perk    DJs great   no real mixing just playing tops    Staff professional polite compared XS    this why rating TAO bit higher  always experienced great customer service Vegas things tend notice   Yes place crowded but real nice small outdoor balcony whenever want breather   Overall nice atmosphere great time  <EOR> TAO become another done location   visually amazing audibly great but few deal breakers experience more negative positive   TAO once place everyone wanted see seen now much   The biggest issue TAO crowd   Its crowded   If dance club its dance drink   When dance floor crowded when blink your eyelashes pushes someone Houston problem    every time go   Which why no longer go   someone enjoy themselves type environment?  Also when bar order 5 drinks time because never another chance   want drink dance those two things cant TAO   Even making your way bathroom difficult time consuming   don't wait until last minute otherwise might pee your pants   Speaking bathrooms lock door otherwise glass wont frost   Learned hard way   The only way come back if going TAO Beach   Now TAO Beach deserves healthy 3 1 2 stars   Under normal circumstances id say 4 but TB related TAO family name tarnished   Enjoy much possible   prefer spend evening tapping people back because pretend don't know trying pass them  <EOR> Great place dance bite eat Vegas   experience great Group setting couple   <EOR> We Tao 10 early Vegas standards but required host  Already 10 line crowd huge  Once again walked right host gave them name went  escorted table main room amazing  Instantly introduced waitress bus boy security guard  Within 10 minutes arrival two bottles table every mixer could imagine  ask give you  My friend wanted drink vodka martinis brought vermouth olives martini glasses Boston don't service here     We heard Tao treats its VIP tables best say its true  security guy personal escort bathroom all night  any idea awesome bypass line 25 girls waiting 30 minutes pee?

All all good music great company fun times  free! <EOR> well if you're two girls going Tao cool   group needing more girls VIP usually come you   But people somewhat pretentious drinks nothing special as expected Vegas right?    most rooms no room dance   I'd say Tao Beach least favorite but if cabana would better time     I guess Vegas place alright   Decor nice   Bathrooms interesting   you see through door inside remember  Lots rooms   Different music     I'm guessing celebrities place because did dance next Christian Project Runway! <EOR> Was May bachelor's party table couple bottles pre partied few hours before suite Venetian   1185 including tax tip bottle Grey Crown   We weren't table very long told since kick once finish your bottles think only table 1 hour   guys brang some girls back hotel room just ended partying back room     All all good times regardless money  <EOR> As most reviewers below only reason because girls party  If case then usually let right without any lists whatever   Otherwise alright   decor interesting  didnt stay long  <EOR> Guys come girls if find some line    The worst part club trying For guys least   But times group girls host gotten flying colors  PREPARED!! won't let even if you're front line if you're just bunch fellas don't even try!!  With said place phenomenal once inside doors take staircase actual club  There's main dance floor  huge but still jam packed friends usually travel other dance floor seperate room own bar tables  where end clubbing most part   lower floor also kinda neat own way dancers seats spread throughout   The decor ambiance definitely club hottest spots Vegas   crowd usually attractive there's great ratio guys girls   Highly recommend club anyone willing put forth effort into it  <EOR> I wish Yelp Zero star review!! friends reserved table last Thursday 11 17 16 Tao nightclub  first thing should know treat customers differently! Anyway when dancing stage someone stole iPhone 6! noticed once gone but crowded couldn't find did it  promptly reported security guy front door he oh lost it!! no stupid stolen lost!! Anyway he didn't care even he didn't report others! He said comeback tomorrow!! inside asked manager sent another security guard she asked fill police report also asked ID  asked them check security cameras but she operation can't now come back tomorrow!! however flight Friday's noon means can't come back check it  Since then calling them EVERYDAY! If call 4pm tell should call before 4pm vice versa    means couldn't talk anyone yet follow whether someone investigating case which assume NOT!! BIG LIAR even think gang steal your belongings inside club because someone else's phone stolen night too!!  Watch guys!! Vegas full nightclubs better which full thefts    Try somewhere else safe also fun! If want enjoyable time instead just watching your belongings recommend Somewhere else more hot girls safety!!   New Update turned Lost Mode iCloud track thefts iPhone just case if turn on! Finally did it!!! found address which is 3675 Cambridge St Las Vegas NV 89169 United States Does anyone any idea? also offered them $100 if return back phone! <EOR> I agree most posts say build line order create hype HOWEVER also means try whatever takes come back! If lady huge plus! More likely you'll approached promoter offering free cover no waiting line  Also within aren't stingy free drink tickets order club look amazing want everyone great time!   I most recommended night Thursday wasn't disappointed  Great entertainment gorgeous atmosphere generous drinks! <EOR> I don't it   bottle service   drinks meh   music wasn't much better   couldn't dance on   Tao kept launching streamers air which course landed champagne each every time   Strict dress code   *Please keep mind am clubber lounge Hollywood style  <EOR> The reason behind 3 stars because its crowded!! ok yeah vegas expected right? But frustrating type crowded nevertheless crowd hot guys girls club jump off but enjoyed downstairs part better more lounge feel it  Dont' wrong im putting place down million reviewers hype place aren't wrong just partied better      <EOR> I lot clubs LA but never explored Vegas scene since Tao places frequently raved figured should hit up  big disappointment don't think would ever again  friends guestlist even guest list hour wait time  Luckily all girls able free  free drinks girls guest list 10 11pm but since waiting long all free drinks gone  Drinks $13 piece very strong  needless say think drinks complete rip off  enjoyed decor dancers but much small space all people let in  big dance room completely filled literally cannot move there  friends spent most time small dance room but also crowded because where reserved seating areas were  space small dance room really awkward because random sections ropped off people reserved it  wasn't good use space music very good  think could find better nightclubs vegas Tao  <EOR> Tao never again!! I don't think ever good experience here!! 1st time hot crowded fuggs  2nd time almost fell face broke table ok ok guess fault = 3rd time although best all experiences considering stayed Tao Beach where there's actually fresh air   there still many other clubs Vegas would prefer over this   Again say never again!! <EOR> Yeah   fabulous  expected lot more place esp  being where huge crowds trying in  $15 guys free girls Sat  night guestlist passes  Hella drunk asian girls bunch old white men trying feel them no thanks! vodka cran bud light $21!?! what? bunch ice drink?

allowed men wear blazers answered yes  fact allowed men wear blazers comfortably club force women check coats okay  Why should female only dress while men walk around wearing anything like? brought issue door man he immediately kicked out  treat women Tao night club? Because if unacceptable no reason should tell women wear less clothing into club  world does revolve around men  <EOR> I'm little bias because love Venetian all amenities   Tao still always crowded early   If staying hotel ask concierge put guest list   set promoter walk right least put line  nearly long general admission   drinks slightly higher then other Vegas clubs   restroom doors girls really cool transparent but when lock door turns opaque   Music usually good both rooms   Nice decor always appeal many naked women lying around tubs canopy beds boys  <EOR> as far night clubs hard vegas find nightclub still played good hip hop   most other clubs play high energy techno trance variety   love music but prefer hip hop  and place it also wasn't hard even though busta rhymes performing night but again wasn't busy holiday weekend  <EOR> GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS      The whole 1 1 ratio bad unless pick some girls  friends did  party Thursday Friday just dancing girls luckily FOB girls number she's Lao's  Those two girls brought Tao easily   Inside Tao very nice Three floors climb to  Second floor main floor thats where all magic happends  two rooms main floor very small Huge if keep going straight  Probably around 2am start spraying Foam dance floor hype people  music great towards end trance house music    Top floor Tao Beach much upstairs unless want drink bartenders very fast drinks wait time problem    I took away star because place way pack move around dance people spilled drinks me  Other then come back again  <EOR> A popular hotspot located inside Venetian Vegas  see mixed crowd majority Asians popular place    This place really crowded  If try buy drink  bar takes forever  Also drinks pretty darn expensive!

Just take away those awkward window displays half naked women please expand your dance floor! Otherwise venue pretty cool  Great music a mix hiphop house ! also love patio back club  great view Las Vegas strip! Good job Tao  <EOR> The only thing still consistent place great music  Everything else turned poop  Nice try Tao Beach but seriously   Lose some tables dancefloor people actually use   They've decided fill every last nook tables taken away all great spots conversation  also felt haven't paid electrical bill cuz definitely spots club felt blackholes  Would take much put small light those areas?!  Also carpet disgustingly sticky stairway Tao Beach ridiculous   Maybe ideal clubbing experience changed but don't think so  shouldn't wait over 1hr table when arrived 10 30pm  money chose elsewhere  <EOR> Always good time when Tao  Bottle service best way won't worry lines crowded spaces  servers always fun sure your group best experience  <EOR> The last time two years ago place still crackin'!  I just week ago bachelorette party best guy ever helped reserve table he best table could've gotten table main dance floor  table blocked off velvet ropes own security guard kept people pushing ropes basically held down fort thanks!   A bottle Belvedere $475 $350 credit anything wanted two bottles Belvedere was! bill came $811 including tax gratuity please keep mind charge gratuity each bottle being purchased  way totally worth it!

Maybe definition changed recently missed memo  Seriously though only people room dance go go's  Never witnessed something bizarre looking down thousands people club seeing only 15% people dancing trying dance     Sounds stupid know but really need let many people reduced nothing more ridiculously over crowded bar?  Two stars 'only' because space genuinely cool  could fun if 1 3 less people but don't kid yourself Feb kinda off season if Vegas   However left nearly 20min entering  Good thing didn't wait long crazy lines guest list would really pissed  everyone sitting lines planning save your time money energy  another place any place  If friends dance any other spot would more enjoyable even your hotel room  <EOR> I give three stars three reasons One three dance floors smallest LOVED!

GUYS nice girls    or sure you've girls your group maybe they'll share drinks D  The promoters all pretty nice  They'll best quickly can  Sadly bouncers aren't always all nice  They're pretty chill group girls  But total assholes guys    It pretty packed club but luckily pretty big  couple rooms 3 bars  wait bar take while learn little pushy squeeze front    The bathroom CONFUSING  love decor   but really necessary label bathrooms Ying  Yang Chances most people buzzed DRUNK  really don't having think which bathroom into! Sometimes bouncer stationed right outside direct traffic but sometimes don't  LADIES LADIES ROOM RIGHT!!!  EXTRA STAR give girls FLIP FLOPS end night  Seriously favorite thing tao D <EOR> They added automatic tip bill then asked more tip  added another $150 still weren't satisfied  refused return credit card until threatened them   club itself nothing special   Bad experience because rude obnoxious people stay Venetian again  EVER  any reason  <EOR> Tao Nightclub most popular Vegas nightclubs! Asian themed venue attracts very diverse group people predominantly 20s 30s  Tao's DJs play lots hip hop which opinion best music dancing!  However Tao gets extremely packed times overwhelming  Essentially if looking club hip music trendy vibe Tao place be!  Some suggestions would be Try guest list earlier evening  Free girls reduced admission guys  1 1 guy girl ratio  Tao tends very strict this  However if guest hotel tend more lenient  If guest hotel believe wait separate line moves much quicker  Girls guest list receive open bar 1 hour least times been! stock those drinks pass them your guy friends! Always arrive early! <EOR> I love came Halloween watch Wiz Khalifa perform! fun downstairs House Music well while upstairs Hip Hop! crowded crowd seemed pretty ghetto wait scratch most them where ratchet females but hey drunk came good time girl's 21st birthday! Anyways bartenders cool music great  guest list didnt wait line  Security strict every other club Vegas    The set pretty cool well lighting  wouldnt expect club Venetian though  If your fan EDM then club would you  <EOR> I saw group people 60's but 9pm you might why came 9pm simply crowd   I would come again can't say crowd hot XS but liked even better didn't pay cover       3 7 stars <EOR> This place joke  Low budget clientele peacockers over weight people priority access  Definitely impressed staff either  Won't ever going back lord disick infected establishment  <EOR> I iike damn big place was   Hip Hop room ok music could louder   crowd little bit more energetic but house area off chains  Huge but thought odd super long line pee men  <EOR> Girls playing bath full rose petals? Confused? still am   Ok again thank Mike Nagar TAO promoter  friends list didn't pay  Just stand line ask list say name many ppl bam! easy  walk out  can't remember but see girls swimming bath full rose petals pasties them course guys looking them those they've never seen half naked girl      FREE is     ummm just leave that   The decor other nice Asian fusion influenced  Dark inside  inside fairly small crowded!  You top theres outside section  Basically TAO beach night  sectioned off  bar good dance floor hard find places sit watch when ppl leave  nice opened cramped inside is  However careful coming back down esp those heals  downfall trek bathroom bit walk   Music decent know trendy stuff if don't mind that  Does crowd going    Speaking crowd its okay didn't really talk anyone  LOL just kept friends  But did look around some good looking people  younger crowd comes around 20 slight 30 somethings  <EOR> My friends didn't want EDM clubbing all weekend decided hit TAO some ratchet hip hop music  honestly loved regretted hopping over XS later see Skrillex   TAO located Venetian but once inside you'll see huge lounge area restaurant seating guests  actual club dance floor located upstairs you'll climb dimly lit stairs reach it  Decorations awesome but problem setup club everything tight here  smoking balcony dance floor bar all aligned each other almost horizontal line there's people constantly moving past each other place other   Despite setup tiny dance floor love everything TAO  People lot friendlier other clubs more interactive dance floor  Some lady free drink wristband kept offering buy group drinks  nice! FYI there's lot twerking here  Don't surprised if someone booty bumps you  <EOR> I'm clubber second club experience since turning 21  guys clubs creep out    never back till now   My old manager knew promoter 3 girlfriends list  girlfriend's 21st birthday weekend little treat her  line outside but through everything quickly within 10 minutes probably bypassing many other clubbers before us  wristbands open bar 10 11 PM  weren't charged cover either    Music good scene actually laidback  Thankfully no creepers time! dance floor EXTREMELY packed  can't move without touching someone  <EOR> I refuse set foot club again  NEVER AGAIN!!! I back for second time only because free open bar  Never intended stay here  But alas circumstances did permit move better club night stayed  The club gorgeous  Drop dead gorgeous decor but sadly pretty enough redeem loser club  The music bad  hip hop so last decade I mean if wanna play hip hop fine but don't play straight hip hop entire time  everyone likes that! DJ vice sort saved night but none anything 1 star rating   What pisses off place owners promoters completely disregard any rules capacity  On weekends TAO gets full IMPOSSIBLE your way dance floor without getting into fights getting stepped on molested harassed  I free question people Why earth keep sticking people inside your club? didn't pay didn't pay drinks profit having many drunken people smashed together tiny place?  I tried very hard fun but absolutely impossible  Finally around 1 am some drunken 30+ yr old stepped HARD two weeks later still limping bruise covers entire right foot   I blame entirely owners no respect person's right good night disregard safety everyone inside   I've gone massive raves WAY safer place    That star giving them cute security bouncer guy looked all night  <EOR> It 4 am  should asleep right now exhausted sweaty probably more bit tipsy    That's happening     Why?  obvious  staff great   club looked good  Everything lined good night   around 11 things felt bit slow    But nothing ordinary early night   Figured we'd couple drinks then hit dance floor     That didn't happen either     Oh tried    drank those drinks   when DJ sounded bit rough drank more drinks   When didn't help drank MORE drinks   lacked initial enthusiasm certainly made dedication     But didn't help   DJ just worse   stood crowd staring motionless silently urging play something anything could dance more 15 seconds    brief glimpses hope    track mix hint promise    then inevitable slide into seated frustration when hope dashed yet another weak transition decent part dance tune into boring part overplayed single     We stuck around far long hoping would improve   4 hours later as joined crowd yet another moment motionless boredom waiting DJ pull himself together realize he'd completely lost audience 50th time hour decided throw towel give up   would no dancing   Better drunker people tried night but DJ adamant He going play anything audience liked let alone anything wanted dance to     Maybe just maybe if all happened Tuesday evening I'd let slide   Everyone needs space work new material try different approaches surprisingly better things time write negative reviews     That's happened here   Tonight Friday   Friday day pull your back bencher halfass set   Friday day put your game blow roof off     TL DR Service great ambiance decent but can't save dance club weak DJs   never seen room full loud music drunk people still unmoved   Even bachelorettes bored   Hit different spot just throw lightswitch rave your hotel room save yourself cash  <EOR> So come Tao Nightclub night Janet Jackson having private party  pretty damn cool gonna lie  felt celebrity!

We excellent table ton foot traffic right off dance floor  Easily best place  Service lacking but didn't matter  poured own drinks did lot laughing met lot fun people generally good time   Was very reasonable 2 bottles table    Meet good host take care your host they'll take care you  Highly recommend bottle service crowded nights well  <EOR> This review club only   bottle service I wouldn't dare come without crowded    first room large stage   music A OK     the DJ kept replaying same songs   or maybe just long   waitress bar back assigned area really cool nice constantly checking sure drinks clean glasses mixers   I'd come back if someone else really wanted but way better clubs Vegas try another newer one  <EOR> The Bigger Badder sister famous NY restaurant Tao become hottest places spend weekend nights indulge some city's finest nightlife  said weary overly expensive drinks cover insane crowds   If happen know any promoters sure past lines form any night weekend   Sundays Thursdays theme nights often times free cover access guest list permitted   Unless you're loaded don't think getting bottle since minimum now 3 1 bottle   aside some coolest events held fashion shows celebrity bashes naked women covered rose petals dancing slowly music artsy touch  <EOR> I've couple times now but rate off latest experience which pretty positive   does really crowded promoter did say he table   False   he really meant say but didn't he promised bunch people same table shoved area sardines   decided worth dance rectangular stage area inside situated between two table areas   Even though slightly display risk falling due drunken stupor your own space nobody shoving around   When Mario Lopez made appearance but he hung around table blonde chicks entire night   does work?  pay him?  Does he decide table?  Luckily promoter did something right close enough take picture him   Music mostly hip hop entire night since house seems standard lot Vegas clubs now  <EOR> I would given three stars but don't think it'd fair first timers looking into club  Seriously place good first club experience!   TAO first club experience certainly did disappoint me  night good club get  Great music hot dancers ladies tubs fun crowd    However six months later found myself impressed before  Why?   My experience second time TAO just dull  DJ's choice music quite strange times    rap trance some weird jazz mixed trance  Wouldn't obvious change song when everyone club stopped dancing? atmosphere just wasn't fun before  if spark disappeared    TAO now simply overcrowded overrated but definitely if you're just looking good first time clubbing experience  <EOR> Very good ambiance great food! If Asian food great place dine place be  <EOR> My bf decided attend club because offered cheapest cover charge    bad mistake  arrived fairly early probably around 10 30 PM already line  Luckily guest list pretty quickly  entrance club weird  few flights stairs hard task since wearing heels!

bounders sided other guy coz looked he paid more money table can run upwards 5k weekends     All all experience just want forget   much better clubs Vegas avoid all costs   rather unless cough 5 grand  <EOR> Let first say only pompous arrogant mysoginist men operate establishment   paid online Halloween bash flew five hours denied entrance state ID   specified anywhere ticket purchase Tao site temp ID acceptable means identification   Which find completely false being valid because expired barcode scanned   mgr said state law club rules which if should well outlined site  <EOR> Alright night

someone else even more dance floor   Third staff bouncers rude  friend came course drunk hitting someone  person upset complained friend kicked out   Fourth Its ALL women which fine if few dudes there  Women very nice even more when dress act snotty little brats which 75% women there    I more fun drunkenly walking barefoot place parking garage where friend pick 11 30  Heck even saw more men hit

reason     but second time lot fun  If you're going table Tao suggest getting upstairs main room where scene girls bathtubs etc   However if you're getting table line atrocious cover $60pp  know Vegas but other clubs i e  XS much more worth your dollar  <EOR> I am giving 2 stars because nightclub   probably would given 3 maybe even 4 dinner    Dinner Obviously expensive   reservations still waited

Patrons weary       attended club when Diddy hosting everybody knows ain't no party Diddy party  Guys would highly recommend bottle service table trendy suit  <EOR> I've twice once dinner once party   thought dinner awesome   Granted while ago food great creative   Pricey sure but expect     The club thought kick ass   over 200 Buddhas place number different rooms   bathrooms line balcony upstairs opaque glass changes when occupied vacated   They're pretty cool   think least 3 bars which circular   But would recommend table bottle service if don't want deal lines   Fun music fun people fun club!

Well if see old review 2011   Tao around while! fact open more then 10 years which almost unheard nightlife industry    Tao still solid choice but caveat is   you bottle service  general admission experience sucks because club isn't large other newer venues gets insanely packed  good news any reputable host should able offer some great bottle service minimums deals here  Depending night minimum $1000 should able secure your table main room which where action is   there many random tables hallways definitely don't want far away!  Tao also promoting new bottle service concept called V I WE which shared bottle service experience  Essentially paying open bar wristband but your drinks select table areas other people purchase wristbands  Yes alcohol UNLIMITED Vodka Tequila   only $100 males $50 females bad deal all   Tao definitely Vegas mainstay although lacks appeal some newer nightclubs still popular  mentioned based MANY YEARS clubbing experience   I give 2 star rating general admission but 4 star rating table service experience  If you're budget but still looking VIP experience Tao worth look!  Final Piece Dirty Donovan Life Advice? Best night visit Tao weekly Worship Thursday industry night  <EOR> it alright      the decor naked girls rose petals turned into confetti all good    the stairs kinda freaked thought id fall buzzin!   the main dance floor crowded crowded almost met someone   fist face      the bar service    slow   alot folks just standing bar sippin talking its hard squeeze in  if your gonna take single shot recommend taking double save time effort plus you'll buzzed faster  me   triple chilled patron shot compliments nice ballerific handsome man right bar    *if your female trying bar just squeeze your way between guys most likely wouldn't mind ordering first   return favor tell bartender next! the bouncers downstairs hatin' little  friends friend bottle service   just randomly kickin people group mean didn't roll them but wasn't VIP  bottle service area either  right stay but left other stupid reasons    the restrooms wouldn't even try bc damm line looked long!!!  music ok wasted bet dancing anything    overall experience ok alot people bumping flashing lights! <EOR> I good time but probably something fact free since guests attached Palazzo  Also only wait very short hotel guest line three minutes  hard begrudge establishment that   Yep drinks expensive weak  Yep joint packed  Yep scantily clad girls bathtubs aren't particularly titillating even shocking anymore  Yep dance floors full hot women girls nervous dorky guys   Nope wouldn't pay cover  nope wouldn't if wasn't free attached hotel   So it  Tao nutshell  <EOR> I've always wanted visit club finally to!   The entrance petal filled tubs weekends some women tubs  surprised but fun  club itself red dimly lit bottom big seating area far could tell wasn't VIP seating area  Honestly  great since definitely need place sit during evenings dance  Walking stairs leads main club  the red light all throughout fun music vibes     bathrooms kind strange big stalls hallway someone then guide but fancy too    They played music 00s which super fun throwback y me  partner vodka redbull something $17 know  pregame    Finally view    VIEW!! outside panels set no fall but view amazing!!   This fun great dancing plenty places sit downstairs decent dancefloor fun music  <EOR> The best club ever Las Vegas anywhere    Music  incredible mix what's bleeding edge right now along crowd pleasers songs Journey Thanks DJ reach! Drinks bars crowded you'll fight front but once you'll enjoy well made strong drinks  Prices average    Atmosphere  very fun  second floor go go dancers well girl comes down ceiling la cirque du soleil  Everyone looking good time  very little creepy dude vibes here  <EOR> Here ratings!  EXPECT Beautiful entrance multiple dance floors pretty big club tons bouncers very loud! SERVICE 3 CLEANLINESS 3 QUALITY FOOD n a QUALITY DRINKS 4 AMBIANCE Loud! In good way OVERALL When buy drinks sure multiple takes very long time your drinks because packed! Also very expensive sure walk lot money if plan getting tipsy drunk there!  TIP Cannot stress enough! Buy your tickets prior online print them  Literally 2 hour line general admissions line  If print your tickets through back door wait 10 minutes  very convenient! bouncers nice but if disrespect bouncers all quite angry I don't blame them   Just nice bouncers <EOR> Came last night Vegas boyfriend  When arrived long line bit confused where go  shuffled line line before finally found man list he gave wristbands went! open bar ladies going able few drinks pass them boyfriend well  far good  music your typical house music mixed some other stuff pretty nice dance along to  decor inside pretty nice but packed quick  area did some doors led balcony Venetian nice some air take some pictures Mirage across street   It did seem strict dress code saw few ladies wearing regular jeans shirts  Despite would definitely want come back next time Vegas  <EOR> Not really huge fan clubs but when Vegas     Pros The place huge bunch different rooms always find somewhere plays your music choice  number different bars but still tend pretty long lines  really lounge area great place stop quick drink before heading town    Cons Tao always considerably more crowded any other club Vegas  impossible move around inside club moving bar pain  line ridiculous if don't plan ahead VIP list    Overall Tao always fun but definitely prefer clubs inside Wynn  <EOR> As said review TAO Beach http www yelp com user_details_review_search?q=tao+beach userid=mjOKUSdIqxFPSYMB MmS9g places see seen   think status thing Vegas   People lines hour sometimes longer in   Luckily list 20 minutes all wait   Once inside understood why wait     rooms different music filled beautiful sexy people   top girls bathtubs dancing part club's decor    even open pool area outside room more music more dancing!  As imagine description many people waiting line place gets crowded minus 1 star that but  still great time dancing meeting new people etc     Staff friendly also good looking   Ladies drink free until 11pm   Can't wait back! <EOR> I Tao but crowd control where lose major points  many very crowded nightclubs seems only consistently gets wrong  surprised haven't any serious injuries people being crushed  don't blame security guys though  problem large ongoing falls back management  <EOR> Came friends 21st birthday Thursday night few weeks ago  far worst experience Vegas ever had  showed around 10 30 which time instructed arrive cause going bottle service promoter told he would buy 1 since friends 21st moment arrived bouncer checks IDs rude go  asked if he could take picture which he quickly refused because he wasn't allowed touching private property which understandable but he didn't rude it  getting ready inside same bouncer rudely denied taking group photo denies birthday boy another friends entry inside club due them being drunk   1  Vegas everyone drunk  2  people party anything drink   I asked politely please check them again which he rudely again responded getting    Host walked assured he would personally walk them few minutes settled table course going charge inform couldn't them in  Next tried charge two bottles originally offered second free  Tried talking hostess she great help  walked host assured friends would he walked head security course Mr  Rudeness  asked politely if anything he could which he disrespectfully replied aren't f**king getting into club   Called friends leave TAO take business elsewhere great night Tryst   I understand protocols when people intoxicated but when someone your bouncers gonna end well regardless   It real disappointing kept hyping TAO friend since first time Vegas birthday only disappointed  probably am first bad experience probably last  just wanted share experience everyone maybe help picking night clubs next time town  <EOR> Hmmmmm  I did enjoy fact girls vip access into club within 5 10 minutes instead dreaded 2+ hour wait   Still don't see hype all about   Wayyyyyy crowded!  Can't move around much let alone dance   hip hop playing reminiscent mp3 playlist 5 10 years ago   Don't DJs Tao any updated music???  Decor Atmosphere place grand very over the top   Vegas indeed   I can't hate   first experience Tao personally very fun   But would give 80 90% credit girlfriends ! =D <EOR> Tao where boys let off some steam  Great atmosphere music always good  However if your're getting bottle service forget it! Then again every happening club Vegas |  always nice table dance floor  Probably because drink 7 10 bottles 0_o?! staff top notch mention being totally hot! guess pay for  <EOR> LOL TAO   This review long time coming  long? very first meal husband back then he boyfriend! ate Las Vegas Tao when just couple tourists staying Venetian VERY FIRST TIME   We late flight Asian food snazzy club right hotel sounded great! menu looked tasty all well  room changed headed downstairs reservation   Considering meal Tao absolute worst experience ever EVER all 26 years VERY FIRST IMPRESSION city Las Vegas wonder ever came city enough move here  worst most obnoxious most condescending snottiest meanest awfulest that's word now waiter history profession  believe name Davey  wonder if he still works there?!!  When good ol' Davey asked kind water wanted asked Diet Coke because super thirsty it first night desert all he cut off rudely classic line WATER TIME  consistently pressured spend more money crappy food thing liked some kind fried sushi roll thing rare beef inside? guess star that drinks any desire to  spoken manner best suited dealing small mentally challenged animals  given long unnecessary explanations certain foods I guess he thought maybe never eaten below average Asian fusion before didn't know ahi tuna wasabi cream is??? THOSE WORDS AREN'T AMERICAN! MUST FANCY!    You see Davey figured very quickly probably immediately typical club goers immediately decided couple dorky Midwestern tourists worthy scorn  couple dorky Midwestern tourists but deeeeffffinitely idiots no strangers fine dining much finer Tao thanks Davey know use credit card   Yup  end torturous meal he actually explained use credit card  Now going give receipt back sign line authorizes charge amount indicated  only regret ate Tao because honestly whole thing pretty hilarious walking through club portion gave quick education exactly club why never want ever but Timothy paid meal credit card thus afraid leave pal Davey actual tip when SHOULD left cash pile garbage instead  OH WELL  <EOR> This place rocks! love variety music play low 20 dollar cover charge good friendly vibe  thing wish would've provided seating areas no charge lol  know Vegas guess clubs expect everyone else stand only rich may sit but give break pay spends hundreds drinks least concrete bench something take quick breather    Drinks start off around 15 dollars if tip your bartender well serve quick   Restroom lines 15 minute wait guys girls probably 20 25 minutes  <EOR> i once many many moons ago then again recently   club damn small   also way many kids here   <EOR> Came Thursday night decently packed  Cover $15 person depending night sure + if you're female male Music Jermain Dupree DJ ing but music wasn't jam  Venue haven't many places but told Tao smaller clubs  Hakkasan larger venues  Drinks alcohol ratios really depended bartender  Maybe because walk upstairs past some restaurant type area  empty club sure but something threw off vibe here  Wasn't really feeling music crowd people seemed bit older  <EOR> I've probably around ten times but haven't reviewed spot!  Okay here's two cents The fact years still popular does prove still happening spot   When good promoter even ratio girls guys free girls getting free open bar hour just less popular bar areas load drinks boys your group too!    The bathrooms upstairs interesting though annoying times   the main dance floor super tiny which mistake part   but beach upstairs which isn't always open beautiful more spacious   But best part all did meet boo here   despite common notion can't find any quality men women clubs   well guess found love hopeless place or am just encouraging exceptions over rules?   <EOR> YES crowded! But wouldn't expect club many celebrities most beautiful hotels VEGAS! people come let loos crazy dance night away! Yes drink expensive yes lines long but if plan ahead disappointed  first all want more girls guys obviously  Girls round your besties 9 line 1 you'll probably coupon free entrance 2 ll probably hooked bouncers 3 bathroom soon wont line  Fellas! early meet girls hanging seem more girls your group if just prepared pay full price $30   Please dress accordingly dancing shoes slacks dress pants nice shirt tie whatever just don't show jeans t shirt let trust Ive seen it! girls wear much little want sure no mind  many dance rooms wont know where go  Coat check before enter balcony beauty site see   Enjoy! <EOR> Your usual overpriced overrated overcrowded nightclub  promised free drinks  When told free drinks special promotion ended  much better places Vegas  <EOR> The three stars simply decor atmosphere  Obviously guy felt girls tubs big time dancers great touch  expected lot Asian decor but amazing see  Still Saturday night upstairs crowded made impossible move interact anybody    On top club lounge felt little pretentious bouncers feel your always way  Sorry buddy but nowhere move!!   Oh ya sure list if high roller because waiting hours in  myself two buddies list worked great  access all weekend club lounge Tao Beach! <EOR> The coolest part TAO Nightclub those bathtub girls entrance    This those clubs say Okay    done that  There's 3 floors but relatively small  personally hated room all Buddha there  Kinda freaked when roaming club drunk  Music good but biggest problem club CROWDED    I guess should come just say TAO before but definitely think other spots party Vegas without feeling canned sardine  <EOR> A very spacious venue but people packed sardines can   There's hardly any space walk around let alone room dancing   line club wraps around if come late probably won't unless you 1 tip bouncer 2 bunch girls if you're guy 3 ditch your guys if you're girl   Last time came ate dinner stamp in    actually best option   just need spend 30 bucks person dinner cut line free   This club used better way back when   Now just overrated   way better clubs vegas better music venue people  <EOR> Great club   waited line but vip status   great friend over there   she all plus 2 drink passes   and all ladies fat hook up! place great people great too  everyone should try lease once   When think tao think bunch asian people but wrong mix crowd!  you gots try out! all worth vip hahaha preload before early <EOR> we spent first night bachelorette party loved much spent 2nd night bouncing rain totally overrated!   guest list napkin nights avoid cover s'pose having group 12 buzzed girls helps tooo  warned bathrooms if don't close doors perfectly they're see through until lock then turn opaque everyone'll watching booo def best design drunk peeps need pee   <EOR> So back gamut Las Vegas reviews past fun weekend       First off lucky sweet girlfriends' hookup over here!      I've 3 times affirm vibe crowd pretty consistent     Good music lots room frolic around    What's funny when club Tao 09 13 08 Jamie Foxx hosting party     He pretty annoying though he kept interrupting DJ's mixes adding own rhymes      'hype man' ass kisser kept interrupting well 'Jaime Mothafuckin Foxx tha house!' expecting all holler jubilation     5th shout though damn annoying!

What's point then???  I remember last year Halloween Ashley Greene Kellan Lutz Twilight there     OMG   never experienced such crazy bombardment people   INSANE!  Alright well if you're girl   group girls   given dressed nicely look presentable     some promoters invite VIP section   free drinks   dance little platform if choose     guess bad if you're girls     Music wise   mostly top 40 some house electro sprinkled in    definitely house focused meaning rarely actually don't think ever host DJs performers Marquee Surrender      Overall first choice when comes Vegas clubs   However promoters pretty good job easy free most time   But   always dreaded line    <EOR> Marco head bouncer would allow friend because he appeared drunk   Only issue friend Tourette's syndrome ticks made bouncer think he drunk   explaining doorman he stated he charge going let no matter disease friend had   Management should give bouncers pamphlet informing them Americans Disabilities Act because discrimination its finest  <EOR> Club review only place amazing!!  Given decor very interesting place itself HUGE   The drink prices just any other place LV expensive small   The star gone because line LONG LONG LONG cover $$$$  But once again great club strip isn't?! In end definitely would come back place again again  <EOR> Want imagine sardines feels like? Yeah  Tao   Now before all start protesting should've dropped $$ table service whatnot should mention table service would've made no difference whatsoever review nightclub  Read observe   We 10 30 because guy essentially runs place put guestlist to quote good friend A vagina gets anywhere Vegas true   Pretentious bouncers +1 bouncer Vanilla Ice obviously cool other guys but trying act it wouldn't let because bad ratio 5 3 which understandable  understandable all lines guestlist only until least midnight even though guestlist line length foot  even though maybe 50 people line basically told wouldn't let even if waited regular admission line which wasn't any EVEN if all guestlist line emptied up  two guys party sacrificed themselves gamble casino consequently won couple hundred bucks while stuck waiting line some pretentious jacka er bouncer running 10 people line   Once inside place packed sweaty elbows pushing against while trying bathroom  didn't help some beached whale girl trying block way through crowd because she convinced cutting into dance floor? could finally bathroom    Took forever drink top off drinks weak and 3 shot limit girl   Music pretty good but dance floor PACKED  fair share packed dance floors but two tiny dancefloors weren't even big enough 100 people  Seems Tao spent all money decor half naked chicks but forgot build large enough dancefloor   So back earlier table service comment if dropped $2k three bottles alcohol STILL would've space dance in  What's point spending $$ club only able move around? If wanted sit drink would've gone lounge   Supposedly night would've better if Tao Beach open but seeing only way would back if JT became bestie convinced won't testing theory anytime soon   My friend pretty much place 20 minutes left club  Since gotten stamp decided come back later 2am see if any better guess what? didn't  Still packed still full creeps still much suck before   So if you're bunch girls only give shot since won't wait line pay cover  But if you're bunch guys trying hit girls join line don't bother  Take your hard earned cash hit another club  Normally I'd recommend table service club but please take your $2k Tryst enjoy night fun there   p s  best lie night?

Let's start only promoter talked table only black guy but thought chance didn't say anything  fun time until time leave main guy paid table happens black called speak manager accused stealing jacket he wearing    what? vegas hotel full cameras watch walk jacket just happens match outfit perfectly seriously? manager took jacket wouldn't give back until he proved he just paid $1 000+ table  Wtf?!

The guest list lines moves pretty quick girls free drinks till 1030 course! music played really good! Music beat  bathrooms odd though  seems exposed  sure if that    Basically girls stayed until 11iish then decided going bounce Marquee  asianess wasn't quite scene even though Asian    lol  guess just prefer different type guys? <EOR> The best thing club having Sir Charles Barkley's bouncers toss 22 members crew aside rag dolls  Taking elevator 2 stories really dumb gimmick    I don't know feel having girls lingerie massage each other entrance bathe bathtubs petals  mean love but don't love myself loving it  Know mean?   Anyways loud packed enough elbow room  getting old getting old  <EOR> It really hard write honest review place   many partial memories everything kinda blurs together    but soldier try best   Part 1 Review Restaurant  So if chance eat isn't bad   food little bit salty but when way wasted which time salt good   typical Asian fusion your obligatory sushi rolls   some grilled sea bass sushi roll which decent   Besides ordering dinner decent quick way full into club   Part 2 Review Club  As mentioned above Tao lot times   all kind blends together raiding bachelorette meeting Jesus Apostles hanging 300 Spartans it Halloweens at     maybe bits pieces two different Halloweens??? being hungover soon walked 11 00pm because drank all day then stopped couple hours     picture   lot fun fun times Tao definitely place me   Even though UBER crowded all time when open Tao Beach area night time my favorite place awesome  <EOR> My friends Tao Nightclub early night when still pretty dead   came back 3 hours later absolutely packed   music good dancing but dance floor small   balcony nice view drinks decently priced   Fun venue but when gets packed little much   wouldn't spend entire night but good place start  <EOR> THIS Vegas! Really  When think Vegas think trendy clubs serving best beauty's all around  think opening playboy seeing all those girls fancy club  Tao  Ms  Graham always bottle service when Vegas  only clubs once twice year hell  first experience club standing line  WHAT? know  really didn't expect line bottle service either  pretty short line but still line  experience cost around $550 00    Let explain $550 00  understanding bottle cost table would exception tip  bottle cost $360 00 which kind confused me  assumed additional $200 00 tax tip  top tipped security guy $60 00 sure another guy didn't come sit next Ms Graham while bathroom happened while first time  also didn't people walking dropping off empty cups table too  even saw girl grab handful ice bucket corner eye  problem table top deck right next stairs bar  alot traffic really didn't want expect VIP table   dancing great music awesome   atmosphere dancing area seemed nice but really dark enjoy   Would again? Maybe   But $550 00 if same table  <EOR> we came last year last vegas shabang all out   took forever kept telling come back until bottle service right away   placed near pool under cabana  very nice night drinking away watching friends faded off patron kettle one   watching people dancing drinkin   both bartenders awesome HOT!! guess hot tipped fat right?  anyways end tink bill $1500 tip since party 9 ppl  am giving place 3 stars because bathrooms Egypt trying club lost hella times even if under influence security bartenders kept giving wrong directions  <EOR> Suuuuuuper small but ladies definitely worth putting first your night's schedule   walk around strip during day pass or call ahead guestlist between 10 11 open bar   No shots nicer drinks but bartender cool gave whatever wanted music's better ones experienced well   grab your drinks boogie little bit then bounce your way if you're planning check other clubs  <EOR> Ok come back couple now because open bar more now  Because wish could remember everything review    music play main room sometimes but just way crowded  If side room back bar music more hip hop less crowded  Watch confetti! stuff gets EVERYWHERE your clothes    If you're girl only girls! escorted into separate line just girls  You'll pretty quickly that    I still dislike bathrooms upstairs downstairs QUITE difficult walking stairs hitting open bar  <EOR> My husband Vegas couple nights skiing Utah  Staying Palms  online VIP List Tao Nightclub no cover before 10pm free drinks ladies til 11pm  Arrived Tao stood line couple minutes both husband no cover given red wristband free drinks  first time Tao  upstairs towards Club crowded all stopped small bar area drinks ordered preferred drink choice them find drink free   Free drinks vodka rum something else whatever! paying drinks walked towards dance area  really liked decor club Asian theme  However dance area small essentially very packed  didn't dance b c many people little dance area Im sure all fresh lol  Establishment no windows good air flow  stuffy!  A C but could barely feel it  disappointed Tao expected  sure all hype place  layout good  much space taken all VIP tables surrounding  Nightclub should open space big dance floor 80% VIP tables  crowd young mixed  finished drink booted there  Glad did waste money paying cover charge  Drinks strong worth cost  going Tao again! else Vegas night club  <EOR> I'll nice give Tao 4 stars   Didn't wait line because part bachelorette party but seriously isn't worth unless VIP table  There's no where actually breathe  place packed all time   The ambience very cool very Asian  music kind sucked around midnight though lots oldies  yes fan 80's 90's R B but come on! When hit SWV Soul 4 Real Boys then back Milli Vanilli there's something wrong   I must drank enough  *lol* <EOR> This nice place hangout your friends    Restrooms clean   Watch drinks order <EOR> My biggest gripe Tao cramped is   dance floors small you're rubbing against every sweaty person there   That being said drinks fine music   There's also girls bathtubs go go dancers there's plenty eye candy along people dance floor but all sorta ruined cramped is   Like all clubs Vegas if your girl guy ratio least 1 1 you're going issues getting unless you're baller slip bouncers some cash   sure girls your group willing spend cash in  <EOR> This place headache   really nice decorated well entrance waiting area line but way crowded no reason   females hour 11 pm 12 pm PRECIOUS   If male friends you'll constantly hugging bar trying give your drinks your male friends also downing some yourself   Once 12 pm hits club packed both dance rooms space LIMITED   whole point loosening having fun cannot spent well TAO if  kind night you're going for   Upstairs outdoor area still pretty crowded there's much run away open air space     However magical bathrooms upstairs definite plus   doors amazed attendants working bathrooms lines very attentive helpful everyone  <EOR> This first time clubbing expected crowded but crazy crowded Tao was  wait into club wasn't bad since friends guest list  When walked inside interior really nice    It fun 10 15 minutes then stops  Why? Because gets overcrowded theres ton people pushing shoving by  People nice when trying through but getting bit ridiculous  literally getting shoved knocked all over place  wasn't able even stand place good 5 minutes before pushed around AGAIN    Other pushing shoving quite interesting experience clubbing Vegas  <EOR> The stars decor restaurant because frankly most beautiful restaurant ever in   3 stories high open platforms tables them   middle 3 story high statue Buddha!  However food only average   did appetizers best   veggie spring rolls deep friend sweet potato really good   also liked Buddha chicken but full good appetizers eat all   However night club worst experiences club   club uber packed!  spent over $600 00 dinner stamped into night club free skip line but then turned did back down wait line   When finally into club packed people could even dance but just packed sardines   cheesy almost naked ladies pools all around which added packed was   did music two upstairs rooms all   way though scene music bar great   If again would merely eat drink hang bar friends  <EOR> Get early!  Decor nice  Expensive hell      but Vegas   much nightclub person  just don't why everyone likes jam pack themselves onto dancefloor     should say standfloor    enough room move   Good music  Good atmosphere   Bartenders bit snobby   kept going back bar because no lines but around 11pm     they closed side ?!?!  really keep jam packed together don't they?  It fun     after inebriated  lol! <EOR> Went Friday night $20 cover charge both males females  Very reasonable compared other clubs Strip   really enjoyed music played fun dancing   those planning drink sure ready spend $$$$$$$$   Each drink around $15 well drinks sure much beer maybe around $7 8  <EOR> Tao far best club Vegas  place 5 times everytime place always crackin! place 4 dance rooms  1 downstair restarant 2 main floors 1 upstair Tao Beach   Waiting line     Fellas find group ladies offer buy them drinks inside you need them getting in Tao strict if roll all dudes kick out    Don't even try trick security spliting up  2 guys even single still kick being idiot loser   Last Friday 5 guy friends did just did work   Anyways fast forward able find group girls free   The bad thing place gets way pack think couple times stuck middle crowds 20 mins  Great place catch Star!!

People bitch clubs because aren't really clubbing types anyways  because always poorly review club no matter where location    Or complain club 'pretentious'    because wake 99 9% clubs ARE    Or ESPECIALLY those complain being turned back due poor dressing habits  thank Bouncers turning away because  less grubby kid club  When clubbing rocket science realize adhere dress code  mean don't church without wearing your Sunday best  don't work without dressing business casual  Why people such state shock when turned away when don't adhere nightclub etiquette?  If scene plenty other places Vegas spend your time instead bitchin' moanin'  Don't downer  There's Margarittaville plethora lounges every single hotel etc  those places instead    Now system Tao still favorite nightclubs hit Vegas! Even few years still just glamorous totally dig asian influenced decor  If loud music bit much want cool off bit inebriation Tao Beach upstairs chill place hang out  Tao Beach upstairs also fun place  always excellent time friends   The only disappointment place always insanely packed  Since most popular clubs Vegas very crowded may difficult find room dance  But when fun because people pretty smokin'   One best clubbin' moments getting table Tao  Verrry nice comfy   having room dance never problem  <EOR> This far best club night  Maybe should blame review alcohol but whatever reason really enjoyed myself least remember     The seperated floors different dance rooms made interesting ventures made way through each room  Wasn't really feelin DJ Tao beach choice music questionable stayed inside beach area   I also didn't really walk seemed mile restrooms   especially heels   definitely business!   I'd down check club again maybe even soberly when less crowded    teehee <EOR> TAO probably best decor theme appearance compared any club  But great looking decor only far     Downsides           Drinks usual $10 $15 Extremely long lines if 30 min before opening expect hour open if your guy aren't accompanied group ladies then you'll wait even longer  No room dance dance floor table ratio 15% dance floor 85% tables  When say dance floor includes hallways isles  music just average main room bad but great  Music much more diverse slightly better small room staff seemed friendly Reason           its Vegas why try it decent guy girl ratio even though seem let 5 ladies everyone guy doesn't seem way inside slightly above average ratio better looking ladies uglies women bath tubs little over rated though waitresses looked better most women there  Tips early unless slowly losing your buzz line hour two if your guy bring women even if slightly ugly don't know them saves ton time line if plan going drinking @ TAO large group table bottle  guest list drunk @ bar next door w subway inside pick handle @ CVS walgreens left <EOR> Just every other club Vegas going overpriced overpacked but place still sits top list  Why? venue large there's actually room walk dance! Wow  coming club? surprise!  Of all times staff LOT better other clubs  just come conclusion going clubs Vegas going DMV  treat shit because know inside    I'll back  <EOR> TIP trust promoters  SCAM just come lowly nightclub   It nice ladies free drinks bar but drinks diluted unsatisfying  men your group? accepted unless double females your party's ratio    DANCE FLOOR It extremely small barely any dancing room without getting pushed shoved around  workers extremely rude shout vulgarities curse words anyone   TABLES Trust promoters promise table but back word  Don't waste your time just better nightclub    Overall location poor nightclub regret wasting time Vegas there  promoters scammers workers completely condescending dance environment ghetto  Just OMNIA Hakkasan  Tao worth hope management listens feedback takes time actually improve <EOR> This very first Las Vegas club experience   friends a group 6 guys 4 girls able right away   No guest list   No VIP   just walked able cut front line which pretty long already   LUCKY!  The music hot drinks strong dancefloor kind small packed but  all right   awesome time Tao would definitely back  <EOR> first time ever club  really packed!!!! omg  drinks like    wtf  13$ shot patron and i paid 7 friends      if didn't win money back woulda gave place 2  anyway women banging  if they're bfs they're girlfriends  easiest dance if need advice    too packed tho  thought rave  <EOR> Too crowded  better clubs   Can't barley walk more dance? Good music Yeh   But Good music without even able dance same inferior music no music all    Women's restrooms located 2nd floor  own cubicle own faucet mirror  think lines longer could been   I mean concept both modern eunique but much ladies trying bussiness  think just didn't work all  If mirrors facuents located outside cubicle then time management wise  just smarter    The dance floor small  clubs both downtown L A Nashville  Both bigger dance floor's dance this  Come vegas! need bigger dance floors!!   Bottom line would come back here  <EOR> This club way small  super packed barely any room dance would reserve vip table some space  worth opinion  music really good whole set really nice but just small club  <EOR> I'm fan clubs but takes cake worst club ever   Where should start?   Our buddy made reservation dinner club  Note spend $30 dollars dinner into club  Everyone order something   fine   since expensive into club anyways  bad part starts dinner stamp your wrist into club   or think  When stairs club area bouncer tells  right stamp into club  stamp fasttrack line into club  Okay    waiting short line upstairs find bouncer head outside club realize pretty long line back into club correct stamp  waiting 30 minutes its back waiting line stairs into actual club area second floor  Keep mind other line without dinner table service DOES MOVE  ALL  If think just stroll its peak hour SOL   Anyways finally club area should all gravy right? WRONG  inch space move around overrated overhyped overCROWDED club! top bouncers telling everyone move all time keep hallways clear   but nowhere move to! way set narrow hallway once enter big bar left  turn 3 corners actually dance floor  never even made because couldn't through all people  bathroom lines insane because overcrowding  impossible drink since can't tell where lines start where people just standing  shoulder shoulder action joint    The funny thing whole ordeal people party didn't dress shirt he back change while going through process  guess dress code pretty strict  When he finally back 40 minutes later all just he pretty pissed lol  think Alli G  put best when she wrote If want DANCE BREATHE FUN elsewhere  But if want pushed around smashed between large crowds people while staring some chic bathtub TAO your place!

Labor Day weekend friends hookups guestlist free cover  First thing noticed was   why many OLD people? REALLY? 40 year olds desperately trying reclaim youth squeezing into short club attire bumping booties all about? No thanks  Second all music crackin' DJ played some awkward tracks hard bump n grind to  Also he didn't play song requests  As friends drunkenly stumbling through crowd bouncer gestured stand roped off section  thought special until spied gaggle girls sitting around  Pussyfest no thank you!  The bartender did stop lighting hair fire though  QUESTION why candles bar? Isn't fire hazard??  Overrated but going complain much since free didn't wait long line  bathrooms also really cool  <EOR> I see why avoided club long  Saturday Labor Day weekend  definitely helps rollin semi deep 7 other girls  them some kind guestlist hook up  If you're guestlist still wait some other bunk ass line luckily fast! You're pretty much fucked if don't really early and or guestlist  know some bullshit but Las Vegas all  You're also pretty much fucked if you're rollin strictly dickly because bouncers won't let without few females   Ladies if want your dancing experience minimal groping suggest stage   don't think anyone stepped dance floor made alive   Or if can't stage your cute homegirls catch attention some dudes tables worked group!

Well afraid become arrogant no longer master your craft  <EOR> I over weekend group 16 girls getting no trouble all free!  However line insane   Inside horribly packed but really awesome   Just when think you've seen whole place pops another room   decor ambiance dancers really cool   I'd love dinner sometime dining space looked really nice   Note if use women's restroom sure turn knob glass door fogs over people dance floor aren't observing your restroom habits  <EOR> More 2 half stars but rounded up   only once but opinion time enough   if don't want take opinion then stop reading     Tao located inside Venetian which gorgeous hotel   stayed Palazzo once which adjacent Venetian absolutely loved it   Tao does live Venetian name   pretty don't wrong lots things look nice cool smoking balcony area those smoke   don't way   enter through restaurant then stairs club itself somewhat awkward because see patrons trying enjoy dinner while hordes girls guys walking ready party     Tao small therefore gets insanely crowded   If bottle service stuck crowd trust gets very packed point where hard move   If bottle service lot more comfortable but comes question if bottle service worth it?  There's upstairs portion tables only people table service allowed to   considerably less crowded dance floor   The good things Tao there's open bar ladies before certain time  why rounded stars    Side story accused bartender girl passing drinks other people because wanted another drink she made 5 minutes beforehand   finished drink fast because pretty much juice splash liquor but whatever free venting complaining   The off thing Tao upstairs bathroom   Whoever designed them really no clue drunk people   clear glass door gets frosted when lock it   clearly if you're drunk might forget lock door which happened friend mine   Luckily saw she didn't lock stood front door hiding her   No free shows tonight! <EOR> The hosts club thieves  Don't if guy   rip u off in  finally moved table left phone there  He would let back lucky found off duty police officer made Tao host me   hope he prison <EOR> The worst nightclub experience party ever had  bouncer Mitch unprofessional aggressive to group women made number rude derogatory remarks  party felt disrespected escalated management site  traveling over 5 hours visit club regret decision  am even more shocked TAO would employ someone Mitch  <EOR> We come pratically every year during Vegas trip mainly because stay Venetian convenient run out   past visit Vegas bought presale tickets place since Halloween party group more guy girl ratio didn't wanted spend evening waiting line   must say though paying $20 presale ticket good idea  None wait line wraps around place all gotten under 10 mins even guys     Although must ask why oh why must many set stairs   Every time come Deena Jersey shore moment tumbling down stairs       Drinks pretty expensive but good thing ins outs usually come little early stamped run back room drink come back dance dance dance  <EOR> Good Club but 1 Major unexcuseable problem me     I wait line into MENS restrooms???? <EOR> On dance floor another girls sweat rolling down back!! place incredibly crowded touch everyone! lines HUGE!!

Tom Tom pay $20 $30   Walked hot actually believed gone hell   know club gets hot but spend little A C when 100 degrees outside?  The music really great but hated layout  dance floor some carpeted area dangerous! VIP area middle  made really difficult walk around     Didn't end staying long which suppose good thing because felt going pass out   I heard opened another room using dancing now better   I'd give another shot but hopefully learned turn A C  <EOR> I am fan Tao   many people place always packed   All publicity place working well them but much me   Unless table expect people constantly bumping into drinks spilled you   place hip hop room but when sometime last month closed off   When dance stand around    nearly impossible due many people   The workers work think highly themselves just same people waiting in   Some them rude helpful all   friend mine table 2 guys allowed come table which crap   would much rather somewhere else less crowded employees weren't rude  <EOR> Did pleasant time   bartenders friendly Specially DEBRA   She very rude kept skipping me   When asked why skipped she lied other people waiting before me   waiting 30 min drinks therefore knew those people where waiting   If Debra does enjoy job TAO club she should working there    took off Ghostbar   Now service friendly point  <EOR> TERRIBLE VIP SECURITY! I  VIP table bottle service WORTH IT!!! Too packed crowded VIP feel even worse people stuck floor smashed against eachother   I say very beautiful club when Armin Van Buren headlined weekend show amazing! But very hard enjoy when crammed sardines your VIP table! security crappy  didnt check wristbands anyone could in  But when left bathroom DIDNT LET BACK IN! friend tell them table  Total BS     There alot other better clubs Vegas check give better experience TAO  <EOR> Crowded mashups girls all wearing same clothes horrible booze like poison you horrible $12 drinks $450 bottles  scene but club pretty well appointed  Many floors  Might someone else's idea fun night but definitely wasn't mine  <EOR> That club pretty lame   $20 2am friday night enter empty club? Really? Don't wrong no problem paying club but when raining outside maybe 30 people inside    unnecessary    <EOR> I free quickly b c friend knew someone   The place extremely crowded  There's literally nowhere stand unless table     Fortunately found table sit upstairs women's bathrooms  Ummm   about bathrooms Whose bad idea frosted bathroom stalls? Basically if girl doesn't fully lock door turning lock 5 times EVERYONE the guys girls sitting tables other people waiting line see through door  probably saw 4 drunk girls toilet night while danced table   luckily them friends kind souls actually stood front doors  bathroom attendants weren't even aware    Also when no bathrooms doors left wide open everyone could see toilets  don't think creates awesome atmosphere  <EOR> First all place all hyped EDC weekend vegas few weeks ago  line balls out nuts insane looked around escalators  couldnt even tell where end line many people crammed line bouncers trying regular girls letting girls cut line when arent looking   After going inside happy see its three levels  Bottom level seemed dead why people even there? guess top 40?  The 2nd level huge look around bar decent  But all way around squeeze through crowd near bar dance floor area  Then area thats closed off girls only apparantly BS    you're lucky your drinks somewhat cheaper all other nightclubs  $8 beers $13 drinks isnt bad all  ATB DJing night def made better  But damn place damn crowded hard around frustrating   the place nice but nice  would last nightclubs mind if choose between 4 other ones  <EOR> The only reason came because while eating Tao restaurant lady came table gave free admission tickets would allow cut front line  When showed line ridiculously long but enter right away  When place ridiculously packed point where could barely move fun!!!   The lines drink bar horrendous too  didn't stay long because enjoyable since place over capacity  If VIP booth would bearable  advice skip place even if free admission WAY crowded   Oh least check girls dressed rose petals pay sit water  <EOR> I inquired reserving table daughter's 21ST birthday   13 people require purchase minimum 5 bottles wine $350 per bottle plus 20% service charge Friday night   would include entrance group table night bottles choice mixers excluding red bull bottled water which extra cocktail server assist making your drinks    Are effing kidding me?  5 bottles wine 13 people!!!  want daughter friends fun become drunken bi *%es a$$*%les!!!!

Man some people would some fun around own cultural religious relics okay?  Second floor  literally maze because walkways narrow  actually quite spacious but dance floors totally blocked off passageway some rose petal dancers lined against walls  friends bad encounter bartender too  Even though free drinks bracelets good before 11PM bartender said no well drinks only even though friend cranberry vodka another bartender  He said 3 Asian girls front boobs practically dangling out  Geez talk having yellow fever? Don't freaking work Tao dude    Dance floor sucks  also feel squeezing way through narrow passageways people's sweat dripping all over me  random elevated walkway stage also roped off  bouncers guards much stricter other clubs XS  They're no leaning against walls   Mister don't see practically pushed against wall? fault!   I guess spoiled outdoor clubs ones Encore but oh god Tao suffocating because no ventilation whatsoever  tiny balcony 30 people pack into sardines because only escape have  Even then balcony's used smokers all smell second hand smoke killing lungs instead real fresh desert air    I gave two star instead because assuming experience slightly better if $$ bottle service if you're very available single lady looking work your way into tables  <EOR> UGH TAO  Spare me  place great   Although didn't pay cover wait way long  arrived around 11 ish waited least hour! 3 long lines wrapped around balcony floor Tao on   After hour waiting finally in  bouncers weren't nice neither promotors Tao  Drinks bar least $15 pop  service pretty slow bar but bad   There multiple levels dance floors bars all must cramped capacity because NO room anything  People literally standing dancing shoulder shoulder  DJ's okay bad  decor heinous most dancers   This place okay but definitely worth wait  <EOR> Once again don't disabled chair come here  would think learned two yrs ago  If chair take all way club  Which would mean unable dance even song  just can't believe treat chair disabled way  spending money  planned table service  messed well  Disabled beware <EOR> Overrated   I'm saying bitter partier wait hours line while asshole security guards power trips  Seriously though   the line outside miles! hooked actually within few minutes but soon came conclusion would've rather stayed outside line   at least could breathe there     1   narrow stairways leading second story dance floor rooftop lounge always packed!  started bottom excited see awaits atop famous club   Within minute reaching top turned around pushed way back down stairs eager escape extreme cold rooftop disgusting humidity dance floor   waste   2   giving 2 stars because lounge downstairs actually pretty nice   and drinks strong  always plus     Comments friends made throughout night Hey   if fire right now we'd all die  Friend #1 while main dance floor know decor supposed Asian but really really awkward drinking clubbing million Buddhas watching you    Friend #2 <EOR> I never back place ever!!!! friends planned attend Tao nightclub because first time Vegas she heard lot it  club take look friend cute plus size tell aren't letting because she wasted!!!!

CONS small dancefloor over crowded!!! <EOR> I actually remember walking into TAO club time!! Mainly because didn't pre party because FREE DRINKS til 11 30! SCOREEE!!! came see Dash Berlin other weekend   To club walk through restaurant stairs  trip if you're already drunk see people eating dinner your way upstairs your drink dance on   The inside very asian themed  remember being dark red silhouettes  Also section tons candles ? which nice take pictures  bathrooms upstairs see people's shadows through doors  sinks inside your stall   The dance floor always packed    having famous DJ spinnin wasn't surprised sardines  sis pulled into VIP section where much more space dance  actually see DJ since dance floor isn't big  Lots lights also confetti fallin sky once Dash Berlin hit stage  <EOR> They way treat locals locals industry night horrible   solo meet friends entered first half general admission line  allowed into 2nd half  bright worker black suit suddenly problem DRESS shoes if dress code  matter settled  call friend wouldn't let line anymore  He also local time 10 50pm   First tell Only guest list locals   He replies he's local then suddenly its now Only guest list   Now things just reach its point ridiculous  treat locals poorly mind boggling night which designed US   Oh yeah work shoppes Palazzo which part Venetian bar we're suppose good terms Tao yet treat dirt  Simply amazing  <EOR> This review strictly nightclub   didn't even know could dinner there   best club Vegas   music seems amazing every night   heard DJ's Bay Area all know Bay Area peeps know hip hop     The dance floor big enough VIP areas over consuming   hot girls tubs wearing nothing but flower petals   two different rooms music   Bartenders usually friendly   outdoor area nice view strip   just always seem run into fun people there   TAO gets vote best Vegas! <EOR> Definitely gets 3rd star simply cuz only wait 15 minutes Saturday nite  Then again guys pay $30 in  nice check club hype surrounding it  normally don't clubs but gf few couples  Definitely more walking room PURE but appeared less bars  But felt bad those table service appeared didn't really much sitting room privacy  Music could've better PURE gets nod having excellent DJs  But didn't ripped off drinks reasonable prices  single male friends girls covered petals bathtubs very attractive  Definite eye candy but you'll likely staring other single guys hehe   Overall I'd probably again if group DJ headlining it  <EOR> Yeah Cathy Y  far off   If group single girls should no problem getting free   trouble starts once some really dirty guys all it   But choose deal situation you   Some girls eurotrash Saudi kings Vegas vacation   No problem love place    It truly ginormous  OMG passed spellcheck ginormous really word? atmosphere unique fun appreciated all different music areas  While drinks pretty good bar pricey course avoid shot waitresses come around   Those things straight pucker only 8% alcohol  Bottom line if group single girls   just show getting VIP pass ahead time good idea great night dancing bouncing around all different clubs   However if group including guys might worth getting table   Quite hefty price tag but some tables place stellar locations dancing watching all action   Others more removed worth whatever cost   Vegas club scene favorite way party night away but definitely some people  Spend some serious money some serious fun  <EOR> Tao honestly I'd expect average club scene   Crowded stuffy barely any room move breathe   can't even stay spot without being pushed opposite side   mention annoying security people strict hell   likes clubs having somebody constantly tell stop don't move aside?

I always despised clubs clubbing  Maybe its whole dressing getting sweaty long sleeve dress shirt while dancing being surrounded bunch sweaty people taking your air space  Being guy does help because almost always pay cover charge  around though since learned IF YOUR GUY STAYING VENETIAN PAY COVER! JUST LET THEM KNOW!   NO COVER SHORTER WAIT LINE line hotel guests walk into club matter minutes  even through sneakers! Actually guys front pointed BUT still quickly before could anything     Up club walk stairs  Shit packed!!! trouble getting drinks all night because people hanging all over place  want dance?

AINT PLAYING NO CHRIS BROWN SHIT TONIGHT!! Good shit    We walk back down because hot sweaty dancing  Some guy almost puked me! Luckily fast reflexes dodged way  He would gotten if he did    We walk back down lounge area find booth sit without paying bottle service  actually pretty empty lounge area Friday night  danced just hung rest night    I regret bringing big Costco sized bottle Grey Goose Vegas  Drinks pretty expensive having couple shots Patron couple beers Redbull Vodkas Adios MF want look tab  Just close your eyes sign tab walk away  <EOR> Beautiful club music just whatever until started actually playing songs whole techno thing ain't me   Lisa bartender awesome!   back dinner sure! <EOR> We stayed Venetian VIP passes easy free which awesome!  Otherwise would horrible line outside long then line people inside walking down stairs TAO nightclub TAO beach   admit place really pretty   Tao nightclub mysterious red glow opaque glass changing bathroom doors cool!  fun array dancers all time girls giving each other massages coach hawaiian looking girls giving each other sponge bath bathtub   main floor room smaller bar rooms   ok music main dance area   TAO beach way better music but its more lounge area around pools mostly reserved tables   lot hype really pretty decor   = Still lot fun   didnt stay long though guess wasn't interesting enough stay long   everyone pushes around its super crowded hot  <EOR> Long lines expensive drinks     else expect club Strip?  I think Tao just beautiful  obsessively collect Buddhas other pieces art Asian style decor right alley  tubs full rose petals water when first walk through door smell lovely  service extremely friendly especially being Vegas night club  Yeah if silly bucks blow I'd hang more often sure   I'm type club meet people guess never notice anyone else but friends when out  course hassle when takes lifetime bathroom but  why only find big clubs special occasions friends town  <EOR> Tao first clubbing experience Vegas while generally style fantastic time   We VIP line 9 30 where met some guys bunch times showed around all rooms   decor awesome   Being New York fan big swanky clubs but definitely fun vacation   Drinks strong especially being open bar for girls till 12 30   Dance floor packed but still lot room move around elsewhere   Music great   I liked bathroom upstairs could view whole place   Worth while Vegas  <EOR> After being rejected 1 OAK because friends license expired it ceases compliment point ended Tao  Didn't wait line but paid $20 cover mehh just happy point   place would suck if didn't table because dance floor pretty small bar overwhelmed    Luckily though wasn't problem partied night away <EOR> Been Tao few times now  loved first time but coming back again think differently it   First off those clubs screw guys over if don't least 50 50 ratio  came group 4 guys basically told if don't buy table we're getting in  doorman wouldn't even let wait line! Luckily made friends another doorman earlier night he let no problem   After place really cool first 15 minutes until rest crown starts filling place  Once place gets packed there's no where move no where stand no where dance  don't isn't fire hazard  must say decor awesome bathing girls nice touch  bartenders always awesome too  But doormen bouncers suck place hard move around  However everyone should visit place least once  <EOR> Tao gives off really cool vibe where feel you've found secret dark cave full dancing people clay Buddhas  VIP list made very top Tao where took drinks which very good but whatever two dance floors top level  also plethora couches   I agree many other reviews Tao just crowded  dance floor hard navigate especially since all roped off areas can't see dark couches really hard around  all those stairs heels? Eek    Overall Tao very very cool club if only less crowded  <EOR> Came fiance's b day bash  big club person imagine happy here  mess upstairs but  most clubs are  Tons people overpriced drinks  scene    Still those club could your spot  Long lines costs money  Unless you're staying hotel which friends made free in    It's big location  friend drunk fell asleep couch shook awake security  guess can't sleep shake until you're awake  Also drinks nearly all syrup  Yum! <EOR> Its hot crowded here   We free though hot girls bathing each other tubs    but overall its sweaty mess people here  10000 Buddhas scare me  <EOR> I'm big going clubs just getting groove on   best kinds clubs ones where order your drink your groove on   any clubs Vegas unless you've ordered V I P table lot cash know someone works club just then really fun   As approached club inside Venetian Hotel Casino all could see swarm people lined dressed ready paint club red   line almost looked would take good hour half two hours before reach front door let in   can't believe waited line just see all buzz about   Finally foot reached floor Tao   Luckily didn't pay since local   But those pay cost $40 just in   entered darkness set candle lights water falls decorate hallway   walked past restaurant bar where lounges seats people relax in   walking little bit more set stairs climb order club itself   Before could enter club present stamp paid   As entered two choices left right   Choosing right ended bar where statues Buddha candles decorate bar area   Next door another room where people just wanted sit relax laugh talk   call chill room   If chose left side would ended where huge dance floor place where outside smoke   It's huge club atmosphere   Only thing dance floor crowded hard dance in   But good clubs   DJ good spun good hip hop music   He knew songs choose could vibe it   Another good thing able order drinks very easily didn't wait long service   price drink average $14 00 per drink   prepared fork lot money night Tao  <EOR> Why LOVE Tao?  Upstairs  dance floor   Big bar   Large pillar next stature    where fell love boyfriend   The end   Oh yea   SUPER crowded never ever chance actually dance because packed hardly move   drinks super strong throwback few shots just enjoy music   love food too   something eggroll pie which creative delicious   K   end real now  <EOR> The music beginning night good  more people filled started playing some horrible hip hop could dance to  when crowded crowded! Even VIP section no longer blessing because people pouring in  dance floor small amount people there  women's restroom located upstairs your own private bathroom  line moves quickly women's bathroom line  encountered some creeps while well  able access nightclub easily since dined restaurant  But if don't any intentions eating first line early enough because just long when left when in  <EOR> I came Thursday night since heard Tao better Thursday nightclubs Vegas  Cover $20 guys free girls  place decorated quite nicely very stylish  Dancers red lights confetti all nice touches but club just wasn't kicking   The DJ night played mostly hip hop  couple moments where he started playing couple EDM songs thought crowd starting gain momentum but quickly faded away once another hip hop song came on  sure if experience warrants coming back certainly Thursday night   plus side staff friendly helpful every time talked them   Tip website guest list  You'll able guest list line  half size normal line  <EOR> pros free decent music car crash dancers can't look away sexy decor  cons crowded no other   barely room move  the only place sit benches where candle fell friends head nearly impossible drinks tiny tiny tiny dance floor foam gross weird layout  I don't know if would again but getting free saved place   played Sweet Caroline  <EOR> Personally think club overrated  three times now don't understand why much hype over Tao    As girl its bad gotten free each time even wrist let open bar  Aside club over packed  Its difficult dance main floor stepped many girls wearing pointed heels  <EOR> This favorites Vegas!  Guaranteed good time had   Never pay wait line   When Vegas try place worth it  <EOR> Even though place when Vegas definitely place group friends  came back March  friend hook free but place damn crowded took 2 hours walk through whole place! Drinks freaking expensive barely any room stand  friends managed corner bar but constantly spilling drinks because 2 single file lines people trying pushing  never claustrophobic before but place definitely brought me!  We stood bar area 10 minutes decided hot stuffy all left  Took another 45 minutes just club! <EOR> I didn't really understand definition word FUN until here  Where begin? wife first around 10 first playing some wack ass hip hop bar grab drink  Around 11 decided whip friend shroomy see where night could go  Within 20 minutes being introduced friend night simply more more epic  Finally around 12 ATB came outta nowhere HOLY FUCK he took experience next level  saw Vegas really while there  Everything made sense all could smile  venue epic cause its set no matter where u u always land back dance floor  finally left around 3 needless say third eye wide open then  stepped saw Vegas whole new light  strongly recommend going club chillin shroomy Lucy  sure when there's dope ass dj spinning vibes club gives truly epic  <EOR> Beautiful club! fixtures lighting great  really liked ambiance all    The place pretty big decent sized dance floor but mann place suuuper crowded when went  Pretty crazy dancing damn close folks didn't even know     Also bars different locations which usually because hate when clubs only 1 bar gets suuper crowded takes forever drink  But smaller sized bar other side dance floor only way walking through maze clubbers getting groove on  horrible  Especially if you're dancing people come through drinks hand trying spill you   cool   The bathrooms pretty cool foggy glass thing  Drinks overpriced any club Vegas  Although bartenders pretty cool  need give place another try because really didn't stay long enough feel place  Ooh   whole lotta asians though  But maybe because called Tao? hah  <EOR> This review nightclub only!   I've TAO twice since turning 21 blast both times  group always 1 1 ratio girls guys more girls  Oddly enough guys free when 1 1 pay $20 when more girls group  Meh whatever probably depends which promoter use  nice thing having girls your group aside company shuttle drinks during free drinks girls 1 hr period  took advantage deal both times laugh large groups guys paid wah zoo bottle service just most consumed girls come tables jet off without much thanks losers  happy drunk both times didnt spend dime drinks   They opened TAO Beach times pretty cool  Open atmosphere good music comfortable chairs sit while look beautiful people around you  Can't that   Why 5 stars? Because dance floor pretty packed  Expect 90% your body contact another person all times  <EOR> I used always club first night when friends ended Vegas   haven't years until night   friends rolled line late VIP guest list  short wait   pretty much just walked front line   near 1am   kind thought weren't going because late were but did   place still pretty packed inside didn't think would since place around awhile   Good thing packed because dead clubs suck   Since late stayed bar bought rounds shots until lost count   Once done fueling hit dance floor   crowded there   really no dancing space   don't think music played top 40s   more hip hop trap music   Although felt urban night crowd mixed   just kept dancing drinking made forgettable night   fun remember lol  <EOR> Tao definitely place start your night end it  early ish dinner Tao  loved crispy orange chicken very american asian but still loved it  portion sizes perfect  hate when massive plates vacation can't take home leftovers  friend prix fixe which great deal but way much food especially AYCE buffet lunch  We hooked stamps come back club  skipped whole line  club great playing throwback Usher! sorry leave reservations next place  <EOR> Tao better clubs Vegas  If only because actually enforce dress code some kind  However really isn't much place exciting? Oh girls bikini's writhing each other? Eh lots other clubs city those girls aren't even bikini's   Probably most redeming quality club first when free second decent White Russian  Other way crowded way ethnicity dominate  <EOR> #126 first time TAO actually all free meaning ALL 14 us  feeling because Jay Z supposed show night just wanted pack many people possible boast numbers afterward  majority group showed around 8pm but boyfriend drove afternoon didn't join them until almost 9pm  Some bouncers gave bit hard time when tried join friends but eventually able sneak past them    When line started moving actually led straight TAO Beach which wasn't bad move part  pool lit tons chairs around place though some strange reason nobody sitting  bar wasn't packed yet friends able drinks rather quickly mission night  However boyfriend wanted inside check place first headed back downstairs    I actually quite liked interior decor place  bathtubs girls nice touch design pretty consistent throughout entire club  Instead hanging front place right next restaurant straight dance floor back  point desperately restroom appreciative fact bouncers incredibly vigilant keeping guys away girls' restroom which technically second floor     The music pretty decent throughout night plenty people dancing  VIP crowd especially annoying night because supposed Jay Z appearance would constantly big commotion if he arriving entire dance floor would literally stop dancing stand staring direction  Strange     Overall spent decent 4 hours free  bad! <EOR> Ah yes another night club caters mid nineties babies  Plays same sorry music all other night clubs  place filled half  Asked 21 year old girls dancing bars  even close the best nightclub vegas <EOR> Came Halloween weekend  first time some friends bottle service  very well taken care but always price thankfully us   Your glass never empty freshened table every 20 minutes seemed  place great people watching  top overlooking bar  Only thing would change size dance floor big especially many people there  All all great night  <EOR> I've Bistro before enjoyed meal but review nightclub  isn't bad spot music decent crowd okay didn't wait line thanks hookup  If just want enjoy night dancing certainly Tao   What took experience down notch however snotty female bartender  3 30 girl friend needed hydrate  She asked soda asked two bottles water  bartender looks both Really?  all? though insulted ordering cocktail  Yeah bitch really  everyone comes Vegas does stupid drunk although stupid drunk would lot better  One girls group actually crazy drunk same bartender proceeded mock behind bar  bartenders Marquee XS might cute enough pull off attitude but bitch Tao certainly wasn't  <EOR> For some reason always people raving Tao   Maybe just wasn't right night when went?  Thank goodness didn't pay in girl hooked promoters running around   ushered right away which great because hate waiting line     The place croweded could barely move through   masses people surrounding bar spilled into dancefloor area   Everyone drunk falling all over each other   main dancefloor area also sunken managed slip two steps down c'mon ladies four inch heels! steps?!?!    suuuper high ceilings may appeal some people but just felt warehouse me   don't know just didn't it  <EOR> Why TAO WHY?!!?  To sum small Vegas    I wish could rave place just because many great memories but greatness nothing venue  place gets crowded fast dance floor same size maybe even smaller Incahoot's Fullerton CA  ain't nothing proud of  drinks pricey bartenders smiley accommodating security team inside nice dudes ladies bathroom upstairs pretty legit those trippy doors  TAO would receive more stars roof top bar area but always open    Overall club nice  sure cover because always guest list all comped  If more space people don't tables VIP whatever would place more spacious worth going to  <EOR> I really good time here  packed when but then promoter saw bachelorette she ushered front line  still pay cover though because super packed  group able hang group guys table nice able sit bit  drinks decent but took awhile them  bathroom line ridiculous  But decor nice able dance! <EOR> We daughter's 21st birthday everything arranged ready promised Kristen Turn 21 coordinator  fabulous time dancing loved free round drinks! Thanks Tao! <EOR> I'm giving 3 stars because being guestlist into Tao free girls group free drinks until 11pm  Thus taking into account special circumstance  Else would 4 stars cheap night Vegas   The place partitioned into multiple smaller rooms cooridor laces around dance floor leads balcony overlooking gondala rides  decor nice very over top ethnically Las Vegas themed crowd older more diverse  Bars crowded drinks expensive until intend preparty talk club getting early getting free drinks girls then better willing pay top dollar   Though best club Vegas anymore still great spot hit up   Typical Las Vegas club  <EOR> I admit upfront claustrophobic  fan being pushed around mob people while drinks constantly being poured sloshed all over me  bottle service 2nd biggest room    ended dancing most night because main room damn packed  Packed point being miserable  Hey crazy dancing man flailing your arms around check yourself buddy body body your keep wacking face! Hey drunk girl holding your drink over your head stop sloshing all over me! Yeah kinda all night  Clearly wasn't drunk enough this    The patio nice   but small difficult it involved pushing through said sea people!   Decor nice music nice but left wishing Tryst XS could breathe! XS really spoils you  start expect room dance breathe whatever you're certainly getting Tao  <EOR> Out all Vegas clubs Tao kinda sucks  isn't much decor there  pitch black  Everyone stands everywhere isn't any security guiding people move along other clubs xs marquee  would choose club again next time choice pick club dance butt off  <EOR> ha ha ok    maybe drunk figure wut goin last time  but again wasn't bad P discovered first floor all good hip hop music isn't plastered people  main room impossible! stepped onto dance floor instantly crushed hot sweaty mass clawed way back air   hahhaaha  think 3 5 if  u stay first floor if u meet cute boy did <EOR> Such mixed feelings   think yelp right 3 5 stars     sooo crowded! usually play lot hiphop which prefer dance to   but gets crowded pushy hardly dance!   The last time famous house DJ performed   only kind bored music   even MORE CROWDED   literally when main floor couldn't move   breathe basically   sandwiched amongst random sweaty strangers literally crowd terms movement  Thank goodness claustrophobic   not remotely pleasant experience Sometimes other room good option   even though lower ceiling feel more cramped   its definitely less crowded    I love upstairs outdoor area   unfortunately midsummer WAY hot! But much less crowded   lots spots sit relax   music playing could dance but many people do  Its very pretty  Also ladies often drink specials if early ie FREE well drinks Bring your fellas rotate bar tenders conspicuous hand offs yourself your whole crew plenty free drinks!!  All guys opt redbull vodka but prefer Pineapple Rum Margarita  Both fairly strong but still super tasty especially free drink!    Convenient location if staying Venetian Palazzo   its much cheaper preparty your suite beforehand try drink here   exception 'ladies hour ' <EOR> CROWDED DARK!  If lost your friend good luck trying find them   enough ventilation here   Vegas Nightclubs If you're guy GOOD LUCK fun waiting line unless u buy bottled service which cost big bucks ying yang   Crowded  No where sit unless bottled meet someone nice enough join them comfortable plush lounge area   $30 entrance normally     Guys If want come see girl wearing nothing but pasties then hit Tao Nightclub won't disappointed     Decor kinda cool   Different rooms dance which cool part     Just cup tea  <EOR> This place your typical Vegas hotspot overcrowded overpriced super douchy doormen some reason feel completely matter  guess people feel lives end if don't inside certain clubs  LOL! did some fun inside but wasn't easy comfortable  Even people bottle service seemed irritated because easy non bottle poppers immediate vicinity blocking view everything  purpose having bottle service if stand entire time might well bar  <EOR> Had dinner before thought food pretty good!

However waaayyyy overcrowded strict door dress code   Even if VIP pass wait long lines snake around shopping center lobby wonder everyone fits club space   Drinks hard also overcrowded bar crowded no room even move your hips without bumping into somebody else     If wasn't crowded would probably better time  <EOR> Whenever Vegas feel supposed thinking GREATEST TIME LIFE!  COMMERCIALS   GREAT JIZZING PANTS RIGHT NOW!  WOW HAPPENS VEGAS STAY VEGAS BECAUSE F*CKING COOL!!! But never quite turns way though still good time case Tao   Tao Asian Bistro Nightclub those places gets hyped leave disappointed especially if don't mounds sweaty bodies rubbing against you   The food surprisingly good because why would place known drunk dancing people serve such delicious entrees?    Spicy Tuna Tartare Crispy Rice Lobster Wontons Black Pepper Filet Mignon Udon Noodles absolutely tasty!  fortune cookie said let common sense cloud your judgment which ended being night   The crowd nightclub seemed friendlier other Vegas clubs   started night whiskey red wine which left little moody   switched vodka mixes Coronas   Lots money flew pocket plenty booze landed mouth!  Talked some folks danced bit night became made it  <EOR> This place straight SCAM!!!!!!!!! If come Vegas don't bring any females prepared pay $750 plus     don't matter occasion   don't matter if your guest list $750 plus your getting in   Secruity literly sure buy table  own words since don't any females guys because promoters don't paid unless buy table can't    Oh yes came man said he charge    cousins birthday he drive Cali since flight canceled      could easily paid just principle adamant where buying table   wasting hour night killed thanks Vegas actually thanks club Tao   Smh wish could give 0 stars <EOR> How FK people walk here  Seriously   I came bachlorette group 5 women lucky guestlist due girls group  club looked interesting plenty nipple stickered thong wearing women looked glass box plenty bath tubs  curious much women paid sit bathtub getting oogled creepy ass guys   Even bottle service people WALK YOUR TABLE back your little cozy sofa chair thing dance right behind which did some group feeling totally sorry that  wasn't idea really   Then  took quick glance around club saw  completely packed dance floor where every square inch covered body  looked saw whole flock lined men peering over balcony looking top boobs  Then look towards door where came going flight stairs where saw people shoving  SHOVING others regardless gender in  Wtf? seriously  FIRST time clubbing absolutely hate it    What F really suppose about?

The front desk person told if restaurant ordered food would pass nightclub   ate mediocre food ordered expensive drinks end told consumed enough!  Keep mind stayed Venetian which properties ordered full dish full drinks both us   would tried pay whatever ask but while noticed people really good looking fact tend people would invite any kind party   If considering Tao yourself favor Surrender instead much better place! <EOR> Review only night club   I honestly only remember vivid times when here   Party 8 guys 4 girls  2 1  Worst Ratio EVER    To counter bad ratio 4 guys bottle service thus making 1 1 ratio rest all in!

In order avoid eating somewhere then coming back line ended eating Tao   Beyond convenience saved quite bit money rather wait line straight club exiting then immediately re entering check ID's   No line no cover party 12?  bad   The meal wasn't anything spectacular okay but pricey   However since paying meal essentially cover kinda made way though   Kinda   wanted load some carbs drinking ordered Lobster Kimchi fried rice along Angry Dragon Roll   Pretty boring know   Overall food pretty lackluster especially given price   roll tasted fine but could find just any decent Japanese restaurant   thought fried rice lacking lobster meat  flavor but kimchi satisfied craving Korean food could bit more potent spicy though    As club takes lot space but wasn't exactly spacious   decor nice go go dancers around liven place   apparent main room though VIP section almost right center everything navigating around difficult all people   least couple bars going didn't ever walk far   more people started filing though ended going upstairs spending rest night outside Tao Beach   Despite being hot summer night still cooler outside inside   No huge problems Tao but having gone XS second trip Tao first I'd rather back check somewhere new hit Tao again  <EOR> Negatives The restaurant portion loud don't expect talk your fellow diners The food isn't all spectacular The music club crap DJ's all rooms must ADD because won't let song play longer 1 minute  POSITIVES No cover waiting line if dinner Bistro before hand Super nice wait staff bouncers Beautiful decor Lots room even when super crowded didn't feel suffocated   Not great but terrible either  <EOR> What say Tao  think everyone comes Vegas needs experience it  Sure overly crowded but crowd hardly overwhelming when 6 hotties crashing bachelor's parties  Ah good life  decor interesting hot girls tub full petals definitely amazingly hot!

Hollywood booted your table 1 59 but Sin City  i suggest booking your bottle service promoter Tao staff  Originally booked Tao directly negotiate down $1 100+ service= $1 400 2 bottles Grey Goose for 14 girls   Though may originally lower level vs upper level where ended don't know  Miraculously ran into promoter Vegas instead $450 bottle 1 free bottle totaling $700 service  area where table located upper level great elevated space back booth where danced all night    The venue  Very loud DJ your ears ring next day but expected  AMAZING special effects lasers confetti bubble foam sprinkling down mostly naked Asian models bathing rose petal tubs   Throughout night few DJ's spinning house music some better others  The dance floor extremely packed overflow into bottle service areas  Women let free bracelets pushed through section butted against table packed  point couldn't back into section because full  Excuse me??? table unlike 100 bitches standing around section  It's very young crowd LOT women  Didn't see attractive men 30's honest  Also some guy tried snatch iphones SECTION! kicked club  Okay back good  bottle service attended well  never ran mixers checked regularly  <EOR> This place surrounded naked women  half dressed girls outside restaurant bath tubs filled rose petals Then once upstairs naked women windows pretending live art  club great but crowded many people inside  however great view strip when balcony  <EOR> Came halloween night  Paid $60 two tickets wife able skip line straight in  Very crowded place Difficult breathe  Impossibly crowded dance floor  Terrible music  Dj did know music talking   separate lounge section wtih another dj much better music too  Got see some unique cool costumes  Very dark club    Disorientating    Packed full house  Bartenders nice  Drinks set back $15 drink tip  back here  Very Over rated  <EOR> Unst unst usnt unst  That's sounds TAO  But good vibe indeed   1  sure you're girl  Sorry bros  2  VIP guest list   free entry front line first enter   3  early open bar ladies only 4  Dance night away!

Bartender should done job serve customers   otherwise no tip you! Almost $60 four drinks? Screw pre funk beforehand casino  addition Tao overcrowded over limit capacity space  floor floor 3 floors literally took 15 minutes by  Once floor push your way through your way into 'dance' floor  Some dance floor because we nobody could dance  No space move let along walk two steps  comes club pay stand around mosh pit!?  Tao OVERRATED  Skip big named clubs Vegas hit smaller edgier ones  Bars lounges just good music room actually groove walk  Skip paying ridiculous amount cover for guys prefunk before hand elsewhere   We did pleasant night  sure!

But fun Pros + good ambiance + good variety music + nice Asian decor + 2 3 bar areas + beautiful people crowd + people assist every corner  When Tao Beach you'll pass lot employees corners just sure everything runs smoothly  The men dressed black suits women half nude bellies showing  Cons drinks run 9 dollars $15  kind ridiculous paying $15 frozen lemonade bit liquor it really really crowded because place be  little crowded taste    Tips * believe complimentary admission if girl grabbing pass Tao Bistro during day time before go! * early if want avoid lines  club 10 probably helped faster left club 1am lines ridiculously long still    * Don't wear jeans    people really look down *There's free valet!

Hell naw   Vegas   all pay which caused half group venture elsewhere because knew pay would disappointment   never convinced few stay payed cover inside     Now opinion club comparison all other amazing Las Vegas clubs choose from   thought club pretty lackluster well   big music good but besides that   I just didn't feel connection place Tryst BodyEnglish   bit gimmicky lack customer service door restaurant really turned off   know no high roller but eliminated all customer service regular patrons?!    also remember friend sick wouldn't let fucking bathroom help she drunkenly fend herself   guess thats own fault but still   know they're trying prevent drug use but girl vomiting floor crying loud   getting all riled just thinking it   Skip Tao dinner check club just widen your knowledge   It'll appreciate other clubs Vegas even more  <EOR> Come THURSDAY!!!! normal Thursday surrounded classy people dress no fratboy B S  beautiful women men throwing money nothing everyone smiling real security know keep jerks trouble makers off dance floor just point them gone  NO smoking no watered down drinks dance music all era's  place must Thursday night   See there <EOR> Got VIP first weekend Vegas ever did disappoint  4 bottles plenty drink also top pool which cool chill then head down club inside  great great time loved though good 6 years ago  hope still same when j head back Vegas  <EOR> While Vegas Bachelorette party weekend worked couple really amazing promoters basically onto just any list wanted while Vegas   Tao supposed hot decided check out   So maybe own fault rolling clubs later then suggested but kid when say line 500 people deep   reason lack stars many people although imagining all them inside made would cramped space but no organization ever lines no really wanted clear us   line main lobby line terrace   guest list separate guest list line but all lines kept crossing all bouncers just hanging chatting helping anyone   We bounced another club 2 minute wait     I remember Tao hey day being pretty hot maybe line long reason   But your s*it together figure manage your lines  <EOR> My hair still smells cigarettes last night type this  well did when started review last week!

Vegas    The balcony really nice bouncers sure doesn't busy  really only place conversation truly hear other person saying  When guy telling he charged $2 000 40% interest credit card come vacation literally already process walking away but alas joke if inside club wouldn't heard joke part night would ended very differently which would good bad him  Let just say Bobby Brackins lookin' some love club  no desire hook random fools vacation looking bump close possible doing such but find ton club business suits tons business men Cal Asian cool kids    After hanging balcony guy Mike the Crafters really pressuring back suite because he saw reading text message over shoulder friends gone home being able locate me  held back table he bought suite mates  Um yeah wouldn't spend sort ridiculous money table but if want dance without being cattle car find guy table  velvet ropes keep drunk wild dancers room breathe  zillion attendants making sure table drinks condiments filled  huge Kentucky Derby like cup holds ice  being offered drink table declining told least something took ice cube  Ha  bad   Mike dead set taking walk around shops towner club guy translation let's suite  review this  Don't worry didn't anything!

The highlight seeing Randy Jackson  and place popular celebrity hangout if want see celebs suggest going here   Meeting Randy Jackson however nearly impossible   much wanted take 7 foot 350 pound Bouncer couple drinks knew bad decision   The club lot better much later  around 1 2AM could actually move even dance then    music pretty good remember  and all VIP stuff bs   snuck into VIP section point danced around bit then left   sure if would back again   try another night when less crowded  <EOR> If meeting criteria complete sobriety able prove your worthiness entering mediocre clubs don't waste your time here   used lot better but no longer  trying exemplify pretentious atmosphere but nothing justify stance  another club where welcome everyone  don't  bother wanna be  <EOR> I've Tao 6 times past 2 5 years always wondered   what big deal?  Yes venue itself pretty sweet   but pack hundreds sweaty people? crazy it   The first time came Tao blast  second time great well just manages down hill there   club large several levels huge dance floor few different rooms explore   mention Tao Beach managed slap last couple years   ended just being extra line stand getting Tao Beach   Tao overrated over crowded club isn't worth hassle   TONS promoters club   and if manage walk around Venetian during day without getting hassled give $1   think endless lines lists eager club goers into club because promoters name itself   bravo! people over Tao accomplished going for   However aside cool Asian influenced decor HOT rose petal girls sitting bath tubs nothing else club super worthwhile   crowd B B+ though more people let scale starts slide down little   Who would recommend club to? Co workers don't like   It's just way damn crowded  <EOR> I club several times before always busy crowded super long lines   gf came Thursday night time surprised wasn't crowded yet 9 45 pm   gf  guest list able enjoy open bar again! 10 30 11 30 pm met bartenders gave really strong drinks!   dance floor packed smaller dancer floor did check bigger which bet even more crowded  Music great Thursday evening great crowd  come back Thursday again  <EOR> Move b@%ch WAY WAY  A girl needs room dance  advice Tao     little less women tubs more dancing space those can't afford velvet rope treatment  wait 1 5 hrs pay 20 bucks      Thank God live san francisco! <EOR> MUST  GET  FRESH  AIR!!

However ends 10 11? few minutes before ended didn't use such waste! girls bathroom upstairs overlooking dance floor love private stalls  Bathroom line extremely long but least still party line      Staff very quick attentive  fight broke vip Tables near stage knocked over all cups ice bucket  staff immediately handled situation very well  All dancers guards together clean within seconds everything back normal if nothing happened    Oh also love mirror dancing guy unique!   Overall great club great music  Girls early take advantage your wristbands! Boys early bc you're gonna line forever! Only bad thing say Tao size venue  <EOR> Truly gorgeous space but couldn't help noting hypocrisy Vegas ian excess amid such austere Tibetan aesthetic  offended Asian women everywhere Always happy ending posters every cab billboard town picture Asian girl's bum  reducing all Asian females no more massage parlor prostitutes  But Vegas baby sexism hypocrisy excess part deal VIP passes hand decided check out    Turns passes only work women  Guys seriously pay play town  $30 green eyed boy later in  should note desperately searching good house music options while here  did hours research wondering why every club website lauded its Mr  Top 40s DJ!  good thing    ? just everywhere else we'd Vegas far wildly disappointed music  single house Lounge main dance floor Beach area  visuals interesting certainly  two girls fake making dungeon setting top stairs rose petal boobied mermaids tubs everywhere  but crowd music 100% generic    If looking house music perhaps try Wednesday night skip weekends but heard several locals club its way out  Maybe Tao goers finding enlightenment bottom lychee martinis Dude don't know feel Asian heritage being reduced lowest common denominator sold top dollar masses say burn striped shirts somewhere actually cool?  Yeah no doubt  Wanna Playboy Bar? <EOR> TAO always special me  lot great nights room  decor gorgeous  clubs lighting incredible  strongly suggest anyone comes Las Vegas come hang TAO night  staff all very attractive people professional  <EOR> I much fun here!

Just last weekend Saturday night Snoopadelic  theme party horrible! friend spent LOT money VIP booth 2 bottles Dom perignon two bottles grey goose Crown all fixings mixtures leave early because craziness crowd lack security  bottom booth rope try reserve section but club packed impossible keep strangers booth  seriously pushing shoving drinks thrown when asked people section forced all ourselves because no security sight! point where actually scared thinking could trampled on! staff unprofessional did acknowledge initial concern safety when rope continued pulled away due  crowd trying walk through   allow way many people club no room even dance anywhere total ambiance night just negative me  girl  swimming huge glass cool but it  feel bad anyone VIP booth because don't even know would drink  Never returning very disappointed   and  hard Vegas  <EOR> Overrated crazy line   But cool space great Tao jitos mojitos   $13 piece better good!  I think little old better things time wait line  know good drinks somewhere else!  My suggestion If without waiting line check out  Then laugh everyone waiting line when leave before they've even chance in!  If don't mind waiting line ahead but Vegas many other things your time! <EOR> Great club best music heard best atmosphere great place dance  Staff friendly no pushy bouncers girls into club FREE could ask anything better? weird thing when entered club its 8 bathtubs filled water rose petals two girls sitting tubs together each own tub but still tub club WEIRD nonetheless  entered dance floor area another tub water rose petals another girl tried understand purpose all night  Overall awesome amazing time all attendance  <EOR> Saturday night 2 3am crap awful music  Crap  Awful  Floor kind wet places  Sticky slippery different spots  Boring all out  Probably because music crap awful   Bouncers nice though  <EOR> We ate recent bachelorette trip Vegas  reason picked Tao because hyped all celebs there  totally completely sucked!  First thing made reservations 9 15pm wait 45 minutes reserved time seated!!! absolutely ridiculous hungry wait that  horrible  Finally ordered appezitzer ahi tuna which did even until seated table    Our tuna appetizer ended being best thing ate all night  very good  pad thai entree which $30 nothing special  better pad thai Atlanta  martinis which $14 very good very creative just fancy names taste alcohol mixed fruit juice  refused dessert  tried some friend's orange chicken chicken good but bok choy came side worst ever love bok choy  tried some other food other friends all blah can't even remember got  Another thing music downstairs loud hae shout your fried across table heard    Next upstairs club refused buy drink givethat place any more money  dance floors crowded girls bathtubs well glass looked miserable faking it  Needless say left horrible place within 30 min Tryst Wynn which awesome!   On another note Tao worst place Vegas never again  Kim Kardashian idiot promoting though see why she because pretty much only club Vegas where all black guys party  <EOR> i could tell spectacular all other thousands reviews done  could tell efficient lines easy breeze through     could tell naked girls dancing bathtubs     could tell fabulous decor     could tell over priced drinks jam packed dance floor     but no read else where    instead impressed most upon stumbling end night guy standing door passing free flip flops ladies kick off heels last leg trek home  now place knows girl wants end long night!! tao did right long night doing stiletto stomp  <EOR> WOOO! just came back vegas today boy fun!  friend hook all free!  ladies also open bar until 11PM   Hooray connections! Venue nice   different rooms main dance floor huge   buddha statues everywhere 'asian' themed decor course   upstairs Tao beach momentarily but back down because only bars downstairs giving free drinks wristband ers  Music played variety  mostly hip hop recall some oldies now them  also some techno   Cons no where sit!  trust wearing three inch heels want rest some point   bunch girls just took off shoes danced bare foot  When first directed very top venue which meant climbing 4 flights stairs!  said earlier wristband only worked downstairs  so thought pretty lame TOOO CROWDED!! ahhhhhhh could barely dance main floor  All all great time would def  come again! <EOR> So f ing crowded almost even worth it  really pretty inside music great but don't getting stepped girls' heels  feet still heeling day   Not cool cuz pay thought girls free  Sure ratio guys girls 10 8  guess just don't paying cover charges  <EOR> If being pushed shoved side side dancing freely waiting forever bar having your feet stepped having people recently told no thank but don't want dance keep coming back try dance having same type music play over over your idea good time   then place you!  TAO truly most overrated clubs Vegas  honestly tries portray itself be  Sure lovely but  probably it  Small overcrowded dance floors definitely no good time  wonder why Venetian ever allowed establish itself here  partner LAVO really greatest spots Vegas dancing    The good thing ladies open bar until 10 30 pm! would recommend put yourself guest list drink then hit next better clubs! <EOR> Good food but remember being better first time went   I'm sure if quality slightly down lot good food past couple years just wasn't good thought    We all variety dishes filet mignon sweet sour chicken thai noodles    stuffed shrimp dessert can't remember  Nothing bad but best if free club admission later would say overpriced    Lighting sucked dinner prob wouldn't know served wrong dish until started eating  Server wasn't much hard attention but busser around more used drinks such    The good thing eating dinner going club later free no wait line! <EOR> Ok  I've Tao several times over past few years  favorite nightspot Vegas here's why 1  located Venetian  my favorite hotel! 2  huge main room 2nd floor smaller lounge room 2nd floor lavish rooftop area open during spring summer Tao Beach lounge first floor part restaurant    3  Bars lots choose from!  4  Seating girly girl pay price wear killer stilettos when know shouldn't  finding places sit always good  usually never problem here! 5  Bouncers they're tolerable unlike most places! lost blackberry Tao during last romp kept bugging heck some bouncers rest night  drunk nice me  = 6  Decor unlike anything you'll see elsewhere  giant Buddha statue hundred buddha statues behind bars girls sitting bathtubs full rose petals   7  Music 3 rooms playing different beats you're bound find something like   8  Bathroom ladies' stalls crazy  Glass doors fog when lock them  You'll see know talking about  If line isn't moving fast enough downstairs use restaurant  Usually there's hardly any wait   9  Beautiful people enough said! 10  restaurant too! reservation dinner stay til past 10 into club without waiting huge line  If you're group girls into club easily but might ask pay $20 each  If you're mixed group same deal just sure guys don't outnumber girls    The only downfall its popular REALLY crowded  prepared drinks splashed toes stepped on  Just try let way your fun you're set! <EOR> I really did place  friends met called club promoter pool party Vegas told gather some friends come over club  Which did sat booth which awesome   Now now awesome part  booth sat well yeah also sat 10 other people said all ask tip waitress 20 dollars  Well tip 20 dollars brought 3 small bottles water down vodka expect share 10 other random people just sat your booth your friends just paid over few hundred tips  those 3 water down bottles gone mainly random people sitting your booth expect pay least 100 dollars another bottle joke   The Only good thing place venetian which hotel staying very nice there  Maybe would different if didn't through shady called club promoter which also seem pocketing tips suppose waitress  <EOR> hmmm don't know feel night club  21st birthday but kinda late 12am saturday surprisingly wasn't long line because heard alot club well lets put way     From older people 30 40 heard very positive reviews TAO saying fun but people around age 21 25 all told club sucked lol knew judgement own this    Prices bad $20 girls $30 guys  Just incase guys curious  My first thoughts walking wow place reallyyyy nice! first floor restaurant lounge area gave zen feeling floating around because all buddha status  Those really cool considering very much fan Asian themed places made feel temple converted club if helps haha but thats just review first floor lets club    the club second floor sure you're wearing comfortable heels ladies ! music reallllly good  if you're into hiphop r b pop    don't play much edm well night went  dj night dj reflex LA's radio station kiis fm wow he playing alot good songs people could sing dance too    look if youre still curious music  But although music good    MAN PEOPLE    people reason why review 3 stars  sorry but place reminded why id rather music events clubs ! many sloppy obnoxious girls understand   everyone's just trying fun drink but please if can't control your liquor then dont drink pls   really sad watch lol atleast good friends that'll look ! many girls just bumping into everyone trying way    super crowded sorry but many older people around 30 40 dont wrong thats bad thing lol but its definitely crowd  If you're 30 40 even 50 looking good time im sure you'll fit right it    Recommend place older people ages 30 50 other fun place 21st bday except if someone performing course then sure that'll fun  LOVE LOVE LOVE music but definitely dislike crowd mentioned above  If hiphop pop music dont care sloppy people everywhere pushing shoving then place !

Walking into restaurant bath tubs full naked women tastefully cover flowers  No pictures allowed but tried unsuccessfully anyway  sat bar area until table ready drink  bartenders helpful courteous but bar very full   Once seated dinner decided share meal lobster fried rice well glazed salmon  Both dishes absolutely delicious salmon cooked perfectly  However both thought lobster fried rice very salty way greasy  literally pool grease bowl rice which surprised did drain little before serving us  After having dinner restaurant informed entrance into club complimentary all diners  big plus because allowed avoid $30 00 per person cover charge  The club very much restaurant beautiful full both naked costumed woman but time all dancing instead lounging ladies bathtubs restaurants entrance  restaurant bar club bar served very good drinks  Snoop dogg entertainment night there  When club let staff surprisingly handed flip flops all women  But downside flip flops all same size but didn't stop any women using slippers LOL  friend said relief high heels  simply took mine home souvenir  take home slippers definitely unique touch  The only negative could recall beside size fits all slippers greasy rice but rest experience wonderful  I'd definitely return when Vegas again  <EOR> If want club packed sardine party nights place go   Music cool chicks upper level cool but nothing really made want groove on  I'd rather spending money somewhere else <EOR> It Friday night best nights life  Just way wait ridiculous  half hour? wasn't aggro since talent abundant  But party 10 each dropping $170 bottle service ?

So if plan leave club early may lucky enough cop pair flip flops your stroll taxi  should complimentary incentive guys  Possibly TAO condoms?

I don't think we're really beautiful people but crowd definitely beautiful Las Vegas  <EOR> This club definitely needs higher ratings then this! all time favorite club vegas try everytime go   probably largest club Vegas very well designed lot space never gets packed some other clubs Club Pure     The only negative thing place if all guys you're getting unless table grease bouncer big time  bad quality club but trying keep upscale exclusive    girls always easy in   Once such large place three different areas then giant room where most crazy stuff happens  There's also patio where look strip  never beach but hear good things it   Don't listen all snobby people think club if real clubber try place out  exclusive reason  <EOR> 2 stars? Tao?  No isn't error  Yes Tao where all celebs party Vegas  also same restaurant Scott Disick shoved $100 bill down server's throat   However if you're celeb    be prepared for packed dancefloor Lame music  Ed Hardy Douchebags   Okay seriously  What's Vegas dresscode dudes? all them mandatory orientation when telling them look busted version Pauly D  High emphasis BUSTED because love Pauly D  But then again expect   it's Vegas! part slide   I must admit when first Tao really excited because HELLO TAO! also excited random promoter club approached gals VIP Tix when arrived  late let jump line  felt SOCIALITE!  The decor cute girls getting paid sit look hot while bathe rose petal mini tubs mini beds along wall  Buddhist theme cute however surprised noone's ever complained offensive  billboards promote place religious experience    Anywhoo being mesmerized theme hit reality place NOTHING special  main dancefloor packed  No joke  everyone grinding eachother  really no point dancing since music whack   The other room more spacious but music whack too   I've club three different occasions  first time left bad taste mouth others somewhat better  plus club IF YOU'RE GIRL BEFORE 11PM OPEN BAR!!!!

Tips Go early if can  Standard club etiquette suppose but solves lot problems  Dress up! Girls wearing really short tight dresses e g  Herve Leger style guys mostly wearing nice jeans button downs blazers loafer type shoes  Vegas! can't 'over dressed' Make sure right line  line hotel guests non hotel guests if all girls basically just walk right doorman sorry boys!   note all guy groups let all guys group behind right away    but maybe weekend if group all guys I'd recommend finding few girls line pair trying your luck better ratio all bros  <EOR> Tao favorite nightclub Vegas   Vegas probably 3 4 times year hit Tao always great time   Always   friend gets don't order bottles drink bartenders always treat right   night always very well when Tao   music always pretty good crowd usually really cool   Guys if you're looking very good looking women cool dance Tao your place   gotten point where hostile friends when want anywhere else quite honestly could leave I'd totally cool it    that's much dig Tao  <EOR> This place rocks!  w 2 girls Saturday night   Although wait line 30 min bouncer surprisingly pleasant   typical w most popular clubs Vegas sure 10pm latest dress well no gym shoes etc ample amount girls you     While entering ungodly beautiful women tubs w rose petals floating all over place   decor simply fantastic w asian inspired accents everywhere huge Buddha statue dining room area   very zen place sure   first floor club more lounge w bar lots seating bottle service   really liked vibe area particularly nice if want away dance floor while     The second level houses dance floor crazy packed all over place   There's huge bar end w bottle service areas dance floor   Music pretty standard hip hop rap house which seems norm thesedays   unique Vegas hot women all over place w more fake boobs tans could count!    Overall Tao essential clubbing 'to list' Vegas   combination decor crowd music great disappointed! <EOR> CROWDED  balls Crowded  CROWDED  Big CLUB Venetian  ITs club yea should see where Celebrities party but if aren't celebrity should leave haha  Came time Jay Z hosting something  saw but he obviously didn't see didn't care being squished death crowd  whatever  Good thing still summer beach area roof open  Hot air okay lounging area  Way many stairs  problems guest listing but whatever  friends all free   Second time came friends' Birthday dinner  Made reservations 9 30    surprise surprise didn't seating until 10 30 ___    thanks compliementary drink waiting long  missed open bar night club point  Dinner okay  food good  but anything spectacular  Lets just say lot better less money  place beautiful but its dark can't really tell  Thank goodness nice people let bottle service  Next time just open bar leave  really don't care   <EOR> Anyone weirded Buddha statues?  Being Asian growing going temple place weird   going club Jesus staring you   guess all Asians club don't care white guy took Asian religion pretty much trashed shoved down throat   They're pretty happy throwing away money degraded   Buddhist pretty peaceful   If Muhammad place would closed due extraordinary circumstances   I couldn't stand atmosphere  <EOR> I don't know why such mediocre rating Tao  actually fave nightclubs Vegas even all new clubs lately  First usually stay Venetian perfect elevator ride downstairs no taxi no walk  guestlist super easy cut off time 12am there's no rush in  There's two dance floors hip hop house always house side  gets packed sardines Tao 1am there's no room breathe  trick up! Start climbing tables rails high platforms room move  bouncers really chill long you're hot mess    Best time when Fedde Le Grand spun EDC weekend! He amazing <EOR> nightclub only worth it!  we dinner saturday night restaurant which amazing into club after  completely over crowded! and definitely miserable kind crowded no room move pushed shoved spot another    couldn't even dance floor! Seemed only space available roped off tables  also huge line outside slowly letting even more people in    could really nice if practiced little control! <EOR> There only three twin brother celebrating 22nd Birthday  arrived club close midnight before hit real birthday  huge line right front entrance immediately thought Crap line celebrating 22nd Birthday waiting   Luckily security guards told Guest List line other side entrance  Apparently didn't memo only allow Hotel Guests Venetian enter club  freaked bit another security came because visibly upset  He said he could club cover price all paying $50 each  second thought Screw just take offer because beats trying find another club nearby  few other people seen negotiating deal but cares less 15 minutes lol  He called Tao Club Owner meet ATM machine therefore greeted front line now VIP Tickets hand  Yeaaaahhh Boy!   So let just say once main floor upstairs SUPER SUPER crowded  hardly any room walk people literally being elbow elbow  instead another room which pretty small but good enough find area dance  room pretty lively set off dance  drinks expect because most drinks Vegas bar above $9 $15 range  danced dude bumped into pretty hard  guess he thought going hit something he extended arm give handshake lol  exited room since closed pretty early  back main room met couple people  drink servers pretty friendly well few good tips me  Then comes motherload! security tells step aside bit because someone coming through  happens Ron Artest which thought pretty cool  He wasn't long maybe stayed 30 45 minutes  crowd dying down around 4 left Club heading close   So far would say theres probably way better clubs one  way many people much room dancing  Maybe if find more open area good time  pretty good time but overall Air Bar Stratusphere well worth it  Maybe because stayed Hotel  lively atmosphere Tao but brought liveliness Bar  Super Fun!! think should start review one  Anyways much review just summary first experience there  See ya! Greetings Stockton Cali! <EOR>
