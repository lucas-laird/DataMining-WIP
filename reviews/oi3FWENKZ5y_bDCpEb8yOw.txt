I think idea Lakeside decor least parts it  prompt attentive service  simultaneously calming yet high end ambiance  over the top abstract lakeside show  concept fresh lakeside food  But terms execution can't say  its all there  Almost but quite    Decor see orange lots it  Think ING Direct probably orange lion orange ball's safe haven direct acquisition merge Capital One  But kind grows strange Great Gatsby kind way  am just reminiscing ING Direct? Probably little but both    miss orange ball! Anywho decor once mismatched modern homey  Think eyebrow raising mermaid mural inviting floor lamps cozy couches heavy dosage Ancient Greek buffs nude  feels page West Elm Z Gallerie but restaurant instead home  weird but kind works    Service waiter service good fast attentive might slightly put off  contradiction? Every time leave even few minutes time your napkin refolded your plate might re angled just right  properly creeped strangely attracted? Whatever floats yoyr boat  overly attentive waiter apologize fact inhale water cow absorb sponge  Nevertheless five star service    Ambiance Quiet place business dinner power lunch? good choice  romantic dinner two outside?

Needless say won't back  <EOR> Pricey!  But delicious!  If staying Wynn Encore plan spending time seeing show gambling great location enjoy Lake Wynn some wonderful fresh Hawaiian seafood   eaten twice recently both times fish flown daily Hawaii expertly prepared   Nothing eating fresh fish Islands but if can't Hawaii great place enjoy same flavors   On most recent visit last week thoroughly enjoyed Opah cooked Japanese style side fresh baby bok choi   Perfectly cooked full flavor   The restaurant offers lots steak seafood options but really enjoy being able fresh Hawaiian seafood   select your fresh fish then your choice preparation     The setting beautiful service excellent even bread selection amazing   don't forget yummy desserts!

The outdoor patio show give away great surprise   If weather nice patio must   even seen man himself Steve Wynn couple times <EOR> My husband last night dinner booked restaurant ONLY because outdoor seating Wynn lake  made reservations OpenTable over week beforehand  When told outside seat would hour wait   immediately annoyed because reason made reservations ahead time requested seat outside  worked restaurant business   if can't guarantee outdoor seating then note reservations sites etc  don't overbook your patio  If wait 15 30 minutes would understanding gone bar wait   but hour wait ridiculous   poor planning opinion   Dinner pretty good  husband ordered bottle wine dozen oysters start  Usually restaurants explain where oysters etc  seafood restaurant would expect more   nope   nothing  If paying $40 oysters I'd know little bit them since noticed 2 different kinds would nice know difference between two  guess ask next time   Next husband ordered specialty   whole lobster 4 different choices offered  bring live lobsters your table beforehand explain where each price per pound  husband Scottish Blue $160ish total 2 5lbs classic Maine $100 2 5lbs   opted chili rub  Food arrived beautifully prepared  Butter came warming dish but flame underneath lit   so butter cold quickly    My husband's lobster perfect but mine little surprise waiting  started tail once started cutting into massive amount slimey black dark green ooze coated inside tail  lighting dim kind ate parts weren't covered finished off claw meat  then asked server black green slime he said roe meaning lobster eggs  lobster pregnant  He told lucky lobster roe   however ordered expecting   plus slimey pretty look much made unappetizing  server also said time live lobster picked oozing roe just before cooking  He explained apparently illegal sold condition   I'm assuming ecological reasons but then why would still serve that? He also said lot it     I looking forward dessert dinner but because lobster appealing all lost appetite  huge fan cavier but because lobster roe slimey black huge gobs it   it something found delicacy did feel lucky all   didn't heart tell them didn't because ate claw meat much tail could muster despite some chewiness  husband looked online regarding situation found different reviews regarding lobster roe being delicacy other reviews explained usually lobster should served if roe found inside    I felt really disappointed $500 meal  Won't going back  If lobster roe sure put all your money black then   you're lucky guess    <EOR> I'm giving place 3stars because atmosphere great specially sitting outside perfect end summer night  Love orange white decor theme! say food par Wynn   I love food other Wynn restaurants can't compare  Again great view siting outside ahh ok water show mediocre food    <EOR> I walked thinking would blown away boy let down  came bunch girlfriends because wanted try something new  walked yes restaurant beautiful very trendy nice view waterfall but food horrid  salmon dish pretty much completely raw  taken aback because food isn't cheap certain amount expectations which met   I'm pretty disappointed probably won't coming back here  liked upbeat atmosphere table good location some privacy talk laugh etc  but never eat again  <EOR> Had dinner girlfriend birthday   service absolutely incredible  Ordered main lobster cooked perfectly   days fish special salmon  Absolutely best ever had   manager front desk waitress absolutely flawless amazing experience     <EOR> For foodies So tempted give lakeside 4 stars due spectacle light show animatronics display outdoor seating  friend saw Mr  Wynn dining restaurant night before meal  Lakeside experience but am starstruck all celebrity chefs starting restaurants even if never visit Las Vegas creations therefor  find hard recommend spend your few meals lake side   For non foodies If live breathe food you'd rather pay spectacle chefs name then may think lake side more exciting restaurant then  other places keep surprise delight confined menu  <EOR> This place just plain sucks!  getting turned down SW having reservation strolled into horrible excuse fine dining restaurant   menu looked appetizing however food terrible   Two ordered lobster risotto ordered pasta prawns scampi sauce other ordered short rib pasta   lobster risotto sounded promising   disappointment!
