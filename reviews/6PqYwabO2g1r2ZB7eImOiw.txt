Admittedly rather mundane restaurant chain but delivers need enjoyable meals mom  calamari crunchy toasted ravioli appropriately fun finger food soup surprising   Why? Because number soup minestrone  vegetarian am not  slightest  But something dunking those warm breadsticks into tomatoey broth slurp abandon  course all classics favorite chicken fettucine alfredo  Big white sauce fan it's cheese! Sometimes pasta bit over cooked but am expecting Mario Batali like exactness chain restaurant   I don't think ever bad experience Olive Garden  Mostly long waits F S nights  servers date all pleasant enthusiastic  Also nice enthusiastic having taste proffered wine     several times  <EOR> Denny's Italian food  doing construction time missing walls exposed dry wall smell fresh paint  Super odd but where party decided eat advance without knowing under construction March 2018   waiter super nice talked into bottomless lasagna couple bucks more teaching if eat he'd give second to go worth it  peach tea super good usual  Maybe should give discount since environment major mess  But did job food good  <EOR> Today family location love Olive Garden love much no problem waiting around 30 minutes seated  Food always good service always ok but today encountered waitress less helpful  She forgot bread sticks forgot extra plate etc  But why give them 3 time  $9 **  dinner which includes unlimited bread sticks soup salad entree dessert  older sister ordered soup younger sister ordered salad  younger sister asked try some other sisters soup literally just finished sister left over 3 spoon fulls  Anyways older sister asks another soup waitress rudely tells she charge soup because she's supposed share!!!!!!!!!!! Wth!!???? now sister can't taste soup?????????????????????? think she company policy misunderstood because 10 years gone Olive Garden ever happened us  she actually charged soup  just discounted tip going leave her  she ended paying soup she over charged  Anyways pleasant visit  won't stop going though soup good but sure ask different waitress <EOR> Good food reasonable price  Only reason why didn't give 5 stars because buy bring home unlimited soup salad waitress didn't offer another serving mean gonna another serving but offering would nice  But staff still friendly  <EOR> One fucking star! spit your ground!
