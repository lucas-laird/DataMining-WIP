Yum! Worth stopping quick snack  also sit down seating full breakfast  also order eat standing tables if getting something light   way stroll through Venetian treat itself  <EOR> I visited place 4 5 times  outdoor cafe style setting great people watching  rarely long wait fun sit across live statue watch scare kids    Aside Ravioli la Vodka   nothing else rave about  Whatever eat cooked much better other places even includes pastries  canoli crunchy but filling flat lacked dimension it if only used bland cheese  ravioli really good delicious sauce everything cooked seasoned perfection  But just cheese stuffed ravioli light yet creamy vodka sauce    The service hit miss doesn't even depend if busy not    really depends whatever server got   I would only recommend place if hungry Venetian  prices reasonable compared rest restaurants not fast foods onsite   vast selection gelatos pastries italian sodas worth giving shot  <EOR> Had made meal would 5 stars   Italian fine dining hardly   Canned mushrooms marsala    lasagna Stauffers least tasted it   squash soup campbells gourmet   Although all good home meal even olive garden quality which sucks way  and very expensive <EOR> The pasta's ok  tried gnocchi which chewy  food overall bland! customer service ok too! <EOR> My review gelato  Although carry much favors Espressamente IIIy Cocolini Häagen Dazs less pricy  $5 including tax sugar cone  Although lady served gelato seemed difficulty putting soft gelato into cone ignored request cup chocolate chip favor forgot italian name super super! Hurray home made gelato! <EOR> The cookies good cafe latte fine however     Saw place listed Palazzo's restaurant guide   There's photo shows fully stocked bakery   looked really good marked place following morning's breakfast   Mistake   First there's vast selection breads shown shelves baskets  in photo   When late Monday morning baskets empty stacked carelessly shelves  inquired bread lady pulled some monster loaf plastic bag   big  it?  Terrible presentation breads clearly they're selling many   Ordered selection dry Italian cookies  tasted good enough though hardly expert them   Also ordered cannelloni decent but when comes prefer less sweet more ricotta filling   The absolute mess sandwich   everything else ordered mozzarella grilled vegetables sandwich go   first surprise when back room hot sandwich    second surprise when unwrapped aluminum foil bunch sandwich juices dripped onto clean pants  What? Why sandwich dripping juices? Why bread soggy?  Why lettuce wilted? thought perhaps worst sandwiches recent memory  ingredients good themselves but hot soggy sandwich wilted lettuce nothing anyone should served   I'd definitely look another option  <EOR> We dinner part package various events Venetian  location food probably 4 star but service closer 2 rounded 3 overall    Located deep inside Venetians shopping  center restaurant bakery embellished Italian themed decor painted sky ceilings throughout building feel eating outdoor square  addition there's performers square few feet away seating enjoy musical artistic talent throughout dinner    The service mentioned before bit lackluster  arrived between 5 6pm although busy empty tables no wait seated  However once server discovered part promotion menus snatched off table he immediately wanted order  Then ignored until kitchen staff dropped off appetizers  mixed greens salads joke quarter head iceberg lettuce three yes counted! little green leaves topped tomatoes red onions looked picked off Jack Box sandwich  Yuck! course no came see doing    However entrees pleasant surprise  garnish sides tasty meat well seasoned perfectly prepared  Without promotional prices would still back dinner    The poor service continued long waits no checking said weren't busy  servers just disappeared inside bakery wouldn't come back minutes time  wait almost 5 minutes dessert tray  don't know if because promotional status but due delays bored attitude only tipped 14% usually 20+   would probably want back few times before giving maybe understaffed he having bad day  <EOR> Pastries Good Coffee Mediocre Service Bad I stopped early breakfast treat   Only half pastries labeled little difficulty communicating request counter person   She seemed very reluctant follow display could point wanted then when asked she mumbled something unintelligible   decided anyway but disappointed when ordered latte told different counter   Couldn't least pay spot?  No   Then she nerve keep change without offering me   OK wasn't much but know tip jar should decide if she deserved she didn't   On coffee bar   Luckily wasn't busy yet but waiting two lines would really stink   just want coffee pastry!  latte Illy no foam    think counted three bubbles lining side cup   Hmmmm  I able grab table outside shop   display case looked good wasn't disappointed pastries   chocolate pastry roll looked roughly breadstick but don't speak mumble don't know called   second pastry looked phyllo heavy cream filling flavored citron  The bill came $10  <EOR> We came desserts  sat 10 mins before could catch attention waiter even though many walking around  told wanted dessert he looked confused talk manager  manager walked over repeatedly reminded would pay 'premium' 15% tip table cloth service should just take dessert simply sit somewhere else  very taken aback attitude but since celebrating birthday some really wanted some pastries evening bought couple pastries sat non serviced portion restaurant  pastries taste mediocre best  return  <EOR> Don't come if you're rush  don't oatmeal truly worst oatmeal long time Quaker instant oatmeal would better  Horrible customer service ask order ask water ask check twice  Maybe other food better but didn't time try it  <EOR> Great alternative over priced Coffee shop TI  Half price double ambience! <EOR> We chicken artichoke mushroom asparagus chicken parm lasagna   Every dish rested somewhere between stouffers something cooked myself college   think Olive Garden better being snob love OG when want dependable familiar chain style food     I don't know place means hard rate it   Since least being seated hostess waiter checking assuming least casual diner? food however suggests more order counter grab your own table silverware joint which exists attached Bakery   think food restaurant lost somewhere between    The dishes pretty much assembled pre existing components mixed fresher ingredients i e  potatoes kinda frozen Ore Ida homefries but also given nice little saute green red yellow bell peppers    pasta sauces definitely tasted canned without any added fresh herbs anything liven them up  lasagna noodles definitely mushy tasted exactly remember canned ravioli tasting   fair chicken really tender pan fried nicely though  bit mixed matched me    There few other pasta dishes saw salmon dish other people eating looked really good maybe just ordered wrong things  place averages around 15 20 dollars plate which sounds high but compared surrounding restaurants isn't bad which may account its pre made taste  <EOR> Best gelato ever!! tried many gelato places nothing compared this!! taste authenticity!! <EOR> Terrible food dinner  Sorry but if looking decent meal don't give place try  Yes outdoor section right middle Venetian shops looks really cute  no don't let mislead don't eat here  someone expects much    We ordered lasagna chicken parmigiana  Pretty basic Italian dishes can't mess right? Wrong  lasagna very lacking all meat sauce   meat very questionable  wincing  every bite just because starving  chicken parmigiana bad but spaghetti very bland friend said sauce tasted watered down bland  bread came before entrees came basket wrapped dinner napkins    very blah bread couldn't even bother toast it?   I didn't check bakery items but just dinner entrees never eat meals again  Dislike Tintoretto  <EOR> Not bad place grab coffee rest your feet  Can't say recommend baked goods  bit tourist trap if ask  Service marginally acceptable  exactly attentive welcoming  Slightly overpriced quality  Nothing rave home about  <EOR> I seriously came lowest expectations since most food during trip Vegas pretty underwhelming  experience great though pleasantly surprised    We stopped during Saturday brunch gave table right away  ordered Western Omelette which delicious  Well seasoned very fulfilling  came side roasted potatoes peppers which good too   We also shared order pancakes those  good!!!!!!

Perfection  Now entrees spectacular but salmon rightly cooked most important all tasted fresh  husband ordered chicken marsala he loved it  also reasonably priced wines which ordered meal  looked around see others eating no being nosy just curious thought may place order pasta    Now writing total experience which why though rarely give four 4 stars giving Tintoretto's  service divine desserts tasted just sweet but imbued actual flavors coffee liquer just tiramisu should taste coffee excellent when dine overlook patio where trio flute guitar bass serenaded us  all Venetian  _ <EOR> This review based breakfast  hubby late start morning but still looking place breakfast menu  Most places stopped serving breakfast 11am  walked into Venetian through food court area didn't find anything appetizing  Walking through Grand Canal Shoppes both noticed restaurant adorable outdoor patio seating  We'd seen many times but never thought eating thinking may bit pricey  almost 12pm still serving breakfast menu looked reasonably priced    We seated immediately server Alethea probably most wonderful attentive server ever came took drink order answered questions menu  ordered food came quick  Hubby wash hands breakfast arrived while he still away Alethea busboy bring little cover keep food warm    Their breakfast menu pretty basic eggs omelets pancakes pastries such but pretty simple gal ordered buttermilk pancakes caramelized strawberries hubby ordered Italian omelet  pancakes came stack three dripping melted butter strawberries strawberry syrup  probably best pancakes I'd ever had     Hub's omelet wonderful little different typical omelets tomato sauce it  cooked Italian sausage mozzarella cheese served side sautéed potatoes bell peppers onion slice toast which looked piece French bread    Alethea came filled water glasses checked periodically didn't rush all huge pet peeve if mine while dining  setting mentioned above Grand Canal Shoppes under sky   People passing found atmosphere lovely   I'd definitely back breakfast even try some other dishes  <EOR> I needed ticket run both Venetian Mirage looking something new different breakfast   Even though reviews Tintoretto mixed decided give try   There no seating available patio ate inside   menu given soon sat down asked coffee   serve Illy coffee quickly brought   waiter asked if wanted cappuccino espresso etc  before ordered plain coffee   I then ordered Italian omelette   omelette Italian sausage mozzarella cheese topped red sauce   served potatoes red yellow green pepper pieces   also two slices toasted Italian bread   My coffee refilled twice without asking service point   way local but gave chance watch tourists being tourists   also walk Grand Canal Shops look friend gondoliers  I guess you'd call gondolette    An A OK breakfast  <EOR> Had first brunch loving bf  Egg benedictine salmon omelette delicious  Coffee soy milk also nice surprise  <EOR> It's decent price   would recommend friend    I've eaten twice  food good service decent  price category Venetian means cut few corners  Wine selection basic but again its affordable too  if want high end meal experience you'll disappointed  If want good plate Italian food decent price should happy    The bakery items little hit miss tastes but its nice feature  Illy  <EOR> Best desserts eaten  Cannoli die pistachio gelato heavenly cookies assortment die   we only tried sweets no food but place buzzing <EOR> we trying eat bouchon but they're closed 10 30 am week days  dammit  looked around venetian see else try but didn't really feel spending lot dough if wasn't bouchon   somehow ended tintoretto  mostly because exhausted time found place open lunch   tried caprese salad pink vodka ravioli spinach brie toasted panini lunch  nothing horrible though bit expensive comparable hotel restaurants not fine dining famous chef restaurants bad vegas    the portions good food nothing complain about  service     interesting  no idea server more three people serving us  <EOR> So recently returned first trip Italy now become HUGE European coffee snob  epic douche like proportions but let say Starbucks just can't cut anymore  Since return searching coffee close crazy tastiness each cup Italy  far search proven fruitless   until decided spend Saturday searching coffee Venetian  tried every coffee bar property far best  closest real European coffee experience    I walked bar ordered 2 macchiato espressos  love place because actually stand drink your coffee bar the true Italian way   barista skilled coffee Illy brand which superior anything else U S  opinion  Best all coffee served dainty little ceramic espresso cup  Paper cups piss off having beverage REAL container    The coffee good very close Italy  rich slightly bitter coffee taste nice presentation  Smooth hot delicious  course where paid 90 cents same thing Europe cost whopping $3 75 per cup yikes ! don't order ice water only sell bottled water $2    I would recommend place definitely worth trip Grand Canal Shoppes if coffee lover  cannot comment food since only visited coffee bar but lots takeaway yums ginormous pastries  pizza back too  There's also adjacent sit down restaurant but if just need java jolt head into market  coffee bar right right entrance  If prefer sit drink your coffee few tables canal shopping area  <EOR> Little stand Canal Shoppe section Venetian  just outside restaurant same name  small selection Gelato let sample  coconut mango delicious  <EOR> My review solely gelato    I am wary any gelato Vegas almost all fake Americanized trash appeals tourists    However walking past Tintoretto's gelato stand sign caught eye gelato artigianale housemade gelato italian  husband approached sure enough gelato looked real deal    But would taste??  Maria rosa kind enough let taste many flavors liked  All delicious tasted just favorite gelateria hills Italy!! Best yet felt right home being able talk Italian Maria rosa   if never left Homeland    The gelato made fresh daily premises only best Italian ingredients coffee flavor caffe incredible made fresh brewed Italian Illy espresso  Almond mandorla amazing caramelized almonds top pistachio made Sicilian pistachios    $12 two small two flavor cups  expensive although cost same gelato does Italy euro dollar conversion   We loved place much came back twice weekend  Definitely gem amidst tourist traps Venetian!
