She begrudgingly along we visiting parents week before she little Korean fooded out    In any case strip mall Korean seemed family owned  BCD Tofu House   ended getting spicy tofu soup seafood bulgogi combo while GF bulgogi entree   I'd definitely recommend combos price only few dollars more probably 2 3 bulgogi she did   The Korean woman running front house very surprised when asked things Korean names but excited when she realized Korean   Kinda cute definitely family owned feel     The bulgogi fine   tofu soup seemed little thin watery hadn't really simmered long enough absorb various flavors tofu soup favorite dishes   The space small enough wouldn't surprised see some old school Korean guys yelling ah jee mah servers attention just would Korea   Westernized degree feel awkward doing       <EOR> Good prices portions but food just average opinion   didn't really notice anything stand out   ordered BBQ beef stone pot beef bibimbap   some reason rice didn't crisp bottom pot either    and  most bibimbap   BBQ beef tasty but tad bit salty   enough banchan table meal   so  bonus   Also advertised free seafood pancake   it really should just say vegetable pancake   since absolutely no seafood whatsoever   service fast friendly  <EOR> Great service  soon walk door greet great smile really nice  Then when order bring complimentary small seafood pancake which nice crispy  Then when came portion big ordered tonkatsu plate  seemed put three portions one!!! love variety different tofu soup seafood one  great chunks mussels shrimp scallops hit spot  Also just every other Korean restaurant bring 5 side dishes refills!!

Favorite Korean food service prices  can't $16 Kalbi ribs  come lot its close work service food always consistently great  <EOR> I don't understand people rate place high  food just average nothing special  pros staff very friendly place clean    The negatives most food just bland  no flavor any dishes  Sundubu zero taste it  Even banchan lacking flavor  Just because give lot doesn't mean good    Even though live close place would still drive 15 minutes Island Style Korean food actually flavor  <EOR> Good food decent service but way expensive galbi meat! also menus new old say certain dishes include dessert but end when asked them said wasn't being offered anymore  Um okay let know before order and or update menus please? hate surprises when eating when spelled out  alone knocks off star two    This place would also better eat alone two people better value because give same amount side dishes seafood pancake no matter many your table  <EOR> Cozy Korean BBQ Tofu Stew restaurant operated friendly elderly Korean couple   Mashisoyo serves KBBQ entrees soondubu Korean Tofu Stew SW Las Vegas which great if craving K grubs but just mood trek Chinatown   I ended recently meeting friend discuss some business ideas   talking food restaurants etc next thing know late afternoon completely missed lunch   headed across street check Mashisoyo which thought sounded Japanese which bookmark Yelp least year   Their menu fairly simple  your choice typical KBBQ selections served sides  Food tastes good okay portion just tad pricy   But located away Koreatown plaza Chinatown direct competition obviously more sparse   If am area living working don't feel driving 15 20 minutes would totally adequate addressing spontaneous KBBQ cravings   The owners elderly Korean couple totally nice friendly too  know said beginning but always plus when interacting anyone person especially service industry  <EOR>
