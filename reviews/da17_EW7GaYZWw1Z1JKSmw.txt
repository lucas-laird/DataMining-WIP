<EOR> Awesome breakfast strip  tried Philly cheese steak omelette really good! <EOR> I know just Denny's expectations shouldn't high but worst experience ever encountered high tolerance level  seated near hostess station constantly listen them shout names  food took ridiculously long come table clientele less endearing  two folks sitting next basically coughing food  threw towel left having eaten single bite we did pay tip   would NEVER return no matter hungry am!! <EOR> Service sucked waited 10min no waiter came flag hostess down  Ordered chicken fried steak texture would think chewing condom  White gravy taste white glue elementary school <EOR> The service worst ever  server never came order ended getting served someone else  Then server never once comes checks because he's busy fighting another waitress because she speaks Spanish calls Consuelo which insulting poor women  He's busy fighting table didn't  orders    We party 9 divided into 2 separate areas which understandable  waited good hour before food am being generous time  other party goy food drinks r8ght away wait finish order going  Yes Vegas hectic but if can't handle rush different languages such then service industry work somewhere else   We tried hostess attention but never  once acknowledge well while she seating people down    That really damper vacation start with  <EOR> The runs immediately consuming eggs sunny side $4 slam   wait also ridiculously long 4am then 10am  Stay away your own good  <EOR> Any town USA  Friendly fast food uniform locations  Half patrons buzzed no matter time day but all good just looking reasonably priced meal Vegas  Right strip outside harrahs easily accessible open 24  <EOR> Chicken hard hardly any avacado cali club  salad also wilted lettuce  Just bad food all around  Waitress took forever check although she nice when she did  don't know if because Vegas but if just want cheap food sure come but if want good experience don't  <EOR> Nothing working all day partying all night then going Denny's 5 AM something your stomach before work couple hours   Yay Denny's!!
