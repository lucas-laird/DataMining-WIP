But damn he right garlic naan     For lunch dine in buffet plate specials your options vegetarian plate $10 non veg buck more both come your choice three courses soup app entree plus rice  each plate basically made own buffet home more enough food three meals  Add naan meals don't come mango lassi special treat   The soups weren't thing lentil more brothy usual tomato boring side  tandoori chicken app bit dry but chana samosa chaat flavorful favorite  muttar paneer chicken tikka both robust great sauces but neither came requested heat level  Overall enjoyed meal but guy thought pretty average  might come back dine in buffet but dinner prices bit higher I'd spend  may come back lamb rogan josh though!  Props having nicely appointed interior am really hoping utilize patio seating offer hookah which became focus previous businesses location  Also management should note options available through online ordering system different available site probably something address avoid issue  <EOR> Best Indian food Las Vegas!
