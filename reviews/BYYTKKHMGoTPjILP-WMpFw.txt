Avoid eating if all possible  aunt food fresh definitely wasn't tasty all  service sucked when attempted point problem cashier said he manager he didn't take complaint seriously  use dark meat chicken instead white meat which way tastes absolutely NASTY! only reason star because interior decent  price weekends holidays which isn't worth it  Even normal price $9 lot crappy buffet serves nasty food  certainly never returning ever again encourage either  worth even going  I'd rather eat Panda Express huge fan them begin but food lot better buffet's  <EOR> Visiting LV stayed nearby family group  Large open fancy typical buffet style  Food typical again more seafood some  Fair selection Chinese staples most having visited fryer  Contrary some other reviews found quality very fine selection quite broad  Fine service helpful staff  I'd again best recommendation  <EOR> I clearly hate myself   There's no other reason would ever eat China Star Buffet   know bad food   know cause stomach ache   yet occasionally agree eat here   Something seriously wrong me   Why?  Well buffet items alternate between tasteless awful   meat Chinese dishes stringy fatty random parts bone at least hope bone   might pebble    kind buffet where end eating only fried food because feels safer   least there's some taste if item fried   Bottom line don't sucked cheap as dirt pricing   Even rock bottom buffet pricing ain't worth it  <EOR> It best chinese food nor would put anywhere near top favorite list chinese  feel does fill stomach great workout gym  all stuff blah average no flavor  salt pepper shrimp two servings yummy  enjoy hot sour soup  pretty diverse small buffet comparison hotels  all standard ones kung pau chicken fried rice on  said hit miss find couple good ones  Times some maybe going through much warm best  popular choices tend replace them quick other ones  mongolian bbq section pick your protein some assorted vegetables cook you  hunger feel waiting but look good  food nothing going wow but cheap chinese buffet food  Ok   It just changed management interior lot nicer then before  while came lunch couple times  management tell greeted great smile sense enthusiasm new ownership building  Drinks could even halfway down before server filled back up  Something liked compare hotels server really came each time back came back took old dishes away    Overall say its ok  something regular but if looking some cheap food fill no problem China Star Buffet  <EOR> yuck  body hurts eating food soul hurts making body it  Barf o <EOR> I actually come pretty often  Don't know why  Restrooms  such mess should clean more often  Service bad but good should hire more people cause always busy but only 2 3 people tending customers  didn't drinks until second plates  pay extra drinks don't ask water cause its nasty  don't refill good stuff oysters crab  could least won't refill them  think its more trick if don't want refill them should just stop serving cause thats why for  egg roll huge  Mongolian station pretty good fast  Salmon good but often bones  Nice location  <EOR> If think place ok then obviously dont know look for  agree restrooms being absolutely disgusting every time ive here it grosses think whos charge kitchen practices personnel personal hygeine  ok? girl front very rude didnt say 1 word thanks when paid     just gave receipt???

Next     <EOR> As asian feel should apologize behalf all asians craptastic place  <EOR> Should read Yelp* reviews before eating here   Spent 2 days recuperating stomach trouble hotel while partner threw up   worth gambling your health cheap food  <EOR> My family looking places eat while Vegas came upon buffet  thought we'd try since all you can eat buffet $9 99   I thought coming into buffet food would good  alright  food salty some even cold  service friendly even though could barely hear asking you  <EOR> Low grade Chinese food  Veggies fresh salmon sushi looked dry gross  Overall Bland  Sure staff friendly attentive but come buffets swine out admire cheesy decor  Price should've $4 99 buffet  <EOR> $9 99 All You Can Eat Dinner Buffet w Crab Legs  If Chinese food sweet n sour chicken lots seafood stuff crawfish crab legs shrimp fish   They did bbq pork but kinda tough   Several different soup options around 60 items choose total  Pretty standard chinese buffet fair   They cook Mongolian made to order soft serve ice cream   Really can't complain $10 pp but no fan asian food start certainly did nothing change mind   Pretty boring fishy! But still good cheap eats those Chinese Cuisine  <EOR> Would star but price     less $10 tax tip including drink?
