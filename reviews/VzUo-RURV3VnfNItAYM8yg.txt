Then she said resend she'll accept but already ended ordering somewhere else  Terrible cancel order just because busy  <EOR> This first review but often feel should point perks Boba Hut  drinks pretty quickly  When usually Green Tea Peach Mango Watermelon 75% 100% sweetness top off Honey Boba Mango Jelly Egg Pudding  minute two sit down drink quickly politely served me  also last night first time ordering Loco Moco liked because cooked egg just asked over medium generous gravy  favorite thing Boba Hut all employees really nice communicate well customers  only night weekends but always nights politeness personalities  <EOR> Came actually try tarts but malasadas instead  Honestly way much sugar coated donuts  scrape off most sugar there  good yet just WAY much   I also white peach oolong teapresso no pearls 50% sweetened  Glad ordered 50% cause slightly sweet  wasn't bad yet made wonder sweet if ordered regular    Tried masubi spam Portuguese sausage  Spam great fair enough slice spam but Portuguese could use bit more meat opinion    It really quite chill till high school students school then crowded   Restroom really clean  Service great  would come back again try other choices menu  offer reward stamp card which cool since I'd back  Nice place just hangout but plugs aren't easily accessible if wanted recharge  <EOR> We live around corner decided lunch first time impressed both teas food very satisfied!  ordered drunken noodles which hint Thai basil stir fried udon both good wok flavors no soy sauce needed  perfect!    Also ordered hot jasmine teapresso milk tea 75% sweetness perfect honey boba good! back try Hawaiian dishes next          Minus 1 star fowl pluming smell upon entering establishment need bit more decor looks kinda boring  No long spoon  hot boba boo    <EOR> Came today first time try chicken pork chop potatoes potato salad good there's smoothies pineapple strawberries we're good very clean establishment very courteous operation people work return <EOR> The house milk tea watered down boba flavorless mushy  sweet all  chocolate milk tea no better taste cheap powdery  Pudding tastes made dollar store flan water  food just ok  pork belly moco better moco loco but servings small price adding scoop rice $1 25! Just rice? also comes single scoop macaroni salad which extremely mushy  the pasta no texture boiled 10 minutes longer should swimming flavorless mayo dressing  Highly disappointing  <EOR> At first place would received 4 stars customer service drink quality   Now give them two stars  Simply put bad customer service watered down slushes  past two taro slushes just purple ice little no flavoring   When called place orders both times woman which spoke no idea menu probably made drink little taro powder sugar   coming here   Brew tea bar far sure why gave guys chance <EOR> I'm stoked place couldn't wait review it  still sitting enjoying third boba type this  Lol  Place manini lot tables  just heads up    I usually terrible experience when attend soft openings but today nothing but awesome  Being Asian think programmed boba critic Boba Hut blew mind  various tea selections flavor add ons sweetness level adjustments multiple toppings definitely find something like    I Lychee Black Teaspresso drink Honey Boba lychee heaven because added lychee pieces! Also tried Honeydew Slush w Lychee Jelly super sweet  Probably least fave but boyfriend loved it  Haha  finally Hawaiian Slush w Honey Boba  Pineapple Mango slush w Li Hing Mui powder  Yes fellow Hawaiians pleased one    Onto food Delicious! Came warm very plentiful  half half combos  Chicken Katsu Kalua Pork while other half Chicken Katsu Orange Chicken  Katsu crispy moist while Kalua pork piping hot cabbage just right amount salt  typically don't orange chicken but lightly sauced wasn't overwhelmingly sour sweet    The customer service excellent! All workers very friendly attentive  Greeted served bid goodbye smiles  Already thinking next time fatty date here  New fave place sure! <EOR> Huge menu mix Chinese Hawaiian cuisine  Free WiFi  can't wrong trying Hawaiian BBQ mix combo  <EOR> Customized own drink  green tea honeydew boba spam saimin  very flavorful definitely coming back! <EOR> We driving decided stop try boba BUT 20 min can't 2 bobas only 2 girls working don't seem know left right far most waited bobas ridiculous!!!! Don't come unless entire day sit around wait <EOR> I waited 40 minutes told cook forgot order  Owner friends being catered instantly  wasn't busy ALL  Very disappointed poor service  <EOR> Had Hawaiian slush before which delicious  Tried Green Paradise slush green apple pineapple yogurt time which also pretty good  Brother Wintermelon green tea crystal boba which essentially lychee pearls bit chewy tasteless side   Overall pretty good would come again  <EOR> I finally decided give place try must say am very disappointed  ordered take since reading reviews did want wait 30 minutes food  told would actually only take 15 minutes  live 15 20 minutes away boba hut  picked crispy gau gee noodles when home    NO GRAVY!!!!! no way driving back just pick gravy  tried eating without but dry cake noodles cutting it  being irritated hangry while Boba Hut $12  won't giving place another try  <EOR> I would return Boba Hut  boba milk tea pretty good but nothing special  mostly fluff ice  fluff ice worst fluff ice ever had  Ever  fluffy nor icy  half melted when brought table! if ever boba hut sure steer clear snow ice  <EOR> Love serve Hawaiian plate foods convenient house boba too  wish offered more flavored boba smoothies  Hawaiian food instead L L  Mac salad could use more improvement  <EOR> 11 11 15 Edited The girls working prompt kept checking if ready order service good cashier Mark nice friendly  time ordered Hot Jasmine Milk Teapresso regular sweet w honey boba  really taste distinct tea flavor jasmine tea  Next time would less milk because taste little milky  Other say improved drinks added TVs  Also taste boba improved which deserves a  I've eyeing place before its grand opening try different boba places  heard good things 20% off during month October  stamp card start November   SERVICE My server Chung really nice  He would check drinks doing  He knowledge drinks try topping before getting your drink well   DRINK I White Grape Oolong Tea honey boba Peppermint Green Milk Tea honey boba  oolong tea strong because use teapresso which espresso but tea  white grape flavor good light  peppermint green milk tea okay  cup tea  peppermint flavor strong but  probably because green tea  honey boba doesn't much honey flavor texture good  wait around 10 minutes which fine but expectations disappointed   CONCLUSION I back try different drinks food  <EOR> If you're starving don't come eat   maybe 5 times always hoping best but least 30min wait ordering table   Food good  Wait bit ridiculous  <EOR> This first time trying Bob Hut since opened! energy place good food better! enjoyed crispy noodles pepper salted tofu    so yummy!!!! service top notch felt VIP's! staff very knowledgeable extensive menu all types food drink   definitely coming more often!

First ran across place when Airbnb'd down road figuring if Vegas wanted explore off strip   Decided I'd yelp find something walking distance  3 months later live Vegas Henderson exact back Boba Hut least 4 5 times   My 5 star review based food price service sorry bubble tea drinker   ALWAYS pork belly moco leave satisfied  mac salad favorites tried least 5 other Hawaiian BBQ joints since moving here  Plenty variety Chinese type dishes available well   HEADS UP! Check in Facebook 10% off  <EOR> Spam Musubi Heaven Delicious must try!! decided give them try whim while having hankering spam musubi    The menu all Hawaiian based tour flavors variety  particular specialty menu variations spam musubi! highly reccomend candied bacon musubi standard   Lunch menu option chose chicken Katsu  10 10 delicious chicken fried breaded perfectly  dish accompanied scoop rice home made macaroni salad   Absolutely loved options can't wait try more things next time! <EOR> We inspired come today purely Ono Sweetz deserts b c she no longer deserts over Paina Cafe lol  hearing came straight Yelp check other menu items before heading over since across town us    To surprise food options wha aat?  Boba Hut Chinese Hawaiian Fushion restaurant serving appetizers Crab Rangoon's Potstickers your typical Spam Masubi Spam Candy Bacon Masubi  also grab Hawaiian Plate katsu Okonomiyaki Katsu Loco Moco kalua Pork etc also Asian Plates Bowls Sweet Sour Chicken Beef Broccoli Mongolian Beef Cake Noodles Chow Mein Chow Fun etc Saimen Burgers too! Phew!!!!  We ordered Crab Rangoon appetizer  super excited see HUGE compared other places tried  outside Cooked golden brown perfection filling lacked little flavor  Definitely missing crab flavor ratio filling wonton considering larger normal could more  Hawaiian Plate Menu ordered large Chicken Cutlet which comes gravy side 2 scoops rice yes Macaroni salad  Cutlet perfect fry color nice light crispy  gravy dark thick just right amount seasoning  Taste homemade grandma used it  Mac I'm Mac salad kinda gal BUT tried it! tasted much celery onion no me  Asian Plates ordered Mini Chicken Cake Noodle  chicken itself flavorful could probably eat its own  noodles cut into small square pieces which assume easier eating usually fried down cluster  cake noodle sauce little saltier side taste buds but otherwise tasted good  also order extra sauce b c amount gave enough all noodles soft    Lastly Boba!!!! Since ate Peach Green Tea w 50% sweetness which probably could 25% would more enough sweet me  boyfriend Hawaiian Slush Pineapple Mango Li Hong Mui guess what? He really liked it!!! says lot when comes Boba drinks b c few he actually likes    P S true reason stopped tartes  No where found? Maybe delivered certain days?   The rundown overall 3 5 stars Boba Hut  food good items menu definitely find other Hawaiian restaurants valley but quite few different menu items I'd come back try    Customer service menu knowledge lacking  first cashier when asked Okonomiyaki Katsu she couldn't tell anything grab other girl didn't really know herself  asked if Katsu then asked if different dish I can't remember name  which never had? then said stuff top which asked kind stuff? B c really didn't know no description menu  She then proceeded say oh mayo seaweed some sauce?? Okay? Maybe next time? Then considering only ones place took quite while every thing come out  feel some kinks work but once think everything else better   why knocked off star    Happy Eating! <EOR> Best place late night Hawaii Chinese food course boba!
