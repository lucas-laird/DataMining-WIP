I've several times never know if good experience bad  always hit miss  Sometimes food really good sometimes very poor quality  sometimes within same meal inconsistent quality food   But when good really good though  Perfect rice fish proportion fresh ingredients food comes fast very fast efficient friendly service seasoning point! But when bad   too much rice little fish same kind sushi same plate made different shapes sizes some more rice fish different thickness different size different shape seasoning different  Once ordered grilled mackerel only overcooked smelled bad  When server came take away meal pointed wasn't fresh she took look said Oh yeah fresh  why serve it?  But thing they've managed consistent rude chefs  customers see rude servers  When mistake they're pissed off blame servers  Under old management chefs rude when owner around  But under new management they're rude all time  Once chefs asked man sitting bar give order I'm assuming man owns restaurant he manager because he walks kitchen man turned rudely said Hey your order? made plate him! could also hear yelling workers  Fantastic management style!  Have gone back probably won't  <EOR> I used Jjanga lot better saying quality gone far downhill but think finally come realization quality should surpass quantity especially sushi       For AYCE place Jjanga pretty good guess   Most AYCE run Koreans no exception  problem it   fish rice ratio great some places definitely pack lots rice but Jjanga pretty good smaller nigiri decent size fish little rice     Service always great   Everyone's happy help always come check you   All sushi chefs Jjanga koo koo choo chop Ricky   all friendly try buddy buddy when sit bar   Not cleanest place table bar often feel greasy   wipe down each use course but don't wipe down enough just same greasy towel over over again especially edge table where your elbow touches    ok enough that   only $22 lunch $26 dinner sushi expect   Food most part sushi taste ok   Your typical pre frozen thaw pieces fish typical AYCE places   thing problem all fishes laying right next each other which you'd notice AYCE sushi restaurants  NO NO   Each type fish should own space necessary cross contamination fishes but just right   bad part service seared beef nigiri some rolls too   When whole loin seared beef sits right top filet salmon sashimi  JUST WRONG   very tempting take picture send health department   don't mix poultry fish especially both raw!  Beef right top fish serve that?  kidding me   just time mishap accident type often that   All different type fish laying next top each other along beef come on?  Even though didn't food poisoning dining sure leaves bad taste mouth mind     And oyster lovers   if think freshly crack open fresh oysters serve then WRONG   recycle oyster shell they bucket that use pre packaging oysters no shell ones see glass jar your grocery store box fill oyster shells put garnish it   Definitely fresh frankly gross    If sit bar next time watch it   clean those oyster shells especially they've recycled other patrons clean wipe each shell good before put another oyster meat top?  Think twice before order next time   When first time no idea ordered tasted gross then saw it   figure   Jjanga probably still place AYCE when feel really cheap moment weakness spending less sushi  But honestly wouldn't want often knowing much germ consumed trying cheap     <EOR> The AYCE lunch option really good servers friendly service quick  quality fish always fresh too  Highly recomend! <EOR> This favorite sushi place Las Vegas quality very consistent really great  Service great sushi chefs entertaining  should be! definitely recommend trying it  <EOR> I've checked pretty much all great sushi buffets Vegas must say everyone beat!

We constantly checked liked way made sure tables clear upcoming dishes  <EOR> I came solely because co workers rant rave place  seated quickly upon arrival  don't know servers name probably because he failed pay attention give proper greeting  heard place gets pretty packed fact dead made extra excited eat! first few orders come salmon nigiri weird blueish whitish circle all every piece kinda freaked eating resembled mold  first roll came look super good crumbs sauces cuts all equal  each roll down hill  only four tables max but three sushi chefs behind bar no seating there  tried eye contact ANYONE all failed pay attention  chefs more focused themselves seemed able ot conversations everyone host servers some guy wearing uniform sure if he shift manager what   didn't really want sushi sure  effort all around just sadly lacked some rolls didn't sauces them ALL  Some fish left biggest pet peeve all time when rolls cut same size! some large some tiny ontop everything food wasn't even rolled tight  server wasn't taking plates tables kind just going around whole time  didn't water refilled am surprised even stayed long did  also heard location isn't great other one  But checking brand again  Fish quality service took big 0 5 me   Also when man asked substitutions fish he just blurted no anyone works service industry I DO knows never say no!

The favorites nigiri yuzu yellowtail Cajun albacore beef tataki garlic tuna  Even uni much fresher taste  Each roll pretty good too  Don't remember names although did prefer special rolls over baked fried rolls  Also baked mussels oysters pretty basic but tasty nonetheless  Other dishes appetizers stood mini pork steak?? baby octopus baked dynamite   Also beware!! sometimes miss item forget your order   probably doesn't happen everyone but just little reminder waiter waitress simple solution   All all place does me!

Hubs came AYCE sushi dinner rolled out   Speaking rolls only regret being able try ALL them   rolls all sounded good creative naming them!  Menu items Burning Your Ass Playboy Special  FUN!  only tried 2 rolls maybe 100 varieties because only 2 rolls 8 pieces each   ordered Cowboy Special since cowboy convention weekend Vegas Big Easy   really really wish AYCE sushi buffet loving family piggies back home Toronto we'd able try EVERYTHING!

LOVE ice cream mochi!  Drool!  Only downside only 1 per person tried green tea mango   Both excellent     Might drop more time before leave sin city     Ever consider opening north border?  Please?

Owners nice  Sushi chefs awesome   Just poor job picking Ppl frontline  <EOR> On night when Goyemon didn't offer salmon belly special ended trying Jjanga  nice thing no wait dinner  limit AYCE 1 hour but don't know strictly enforced  Dinner $25 95 which comparable most AYCE sushi joints   Some highlights menu include sashimi choice item per person hamachi kama bulgogi tobiko sweet shrimp oyster uni  Despite lack salmon belly regular salmon nigiri perfect well version apple mayo sauce  also really enjoyed yuzu yellowtail  skilled most rolls but did try hand's job  might expect drenched yum yum cream sauce quite messy   I pleasantly surprised great all nigiri was  dessert included delicious coconut flake ice cream flavors including green tea which quite creamy  downsides AYCE menu lack any specials much smaller nigiri menu less variety desserts  top waitress denied ordering more dessert even though menu does state limit  <EOR> Exactly want Asian buffet Vegas  Great service solid food  Don't forget Snapchat worthy menu  <EOR> I've looking new sushi place think definitely would come back to   Atmosphere Pretty dark  thing didn't like? table awkwardly really close table next hard chairs  tables chairs different most places    Service Very attentive  Waiters waitresses came constantly made sure everything ordered check if wanted order anything else    Food nigiri pretty good  really enjoyed beef garlic tuna sashimi  didn't eat many rolls  Janga burrito handroll little kick end it  really enjoyed because different see other places  Lion roll Pretty tasty but lot more rice used pretty full end    Dessert only mochi ice cream but could always choose mochi ice cream! <EOR> Not bad  Fun place  Friendly  I might come back  But quality fish high   I'm suspicious some two review people who've posted here  This core flaw Yelp business model jamming reviews new restaurant some heat     Is everything life hustle?  For AYCE sushi Yama Sushi better    For pure sushi Sen Japan   For spending lot money tiny pieces fish exotic locations end don't provide much pleasure Kabuto  <EOR> I usually come Jjanga usually enjoy food service but time extremely disappointed  only reason why review getting 2 stars because enjoyed food  But honestly best tasting food change your mind when takes 30 minutes your first roll    Upon entry lady guessing she new because she DID know serve all server giving benefit doubt first 20 minutes took drink orders which think wouldn't take long since all ordered water but no flag down another server 15 minutes just sitting waiting before glass water    Placed order did first roll until sitting 30 minutes  mention all ordered nigiri! Later asked them put dash Masago top baked green muscles server proceeded charge EXTRA dash Masago   Extremely disappointed definitely coming back Jjanga  Definitely letting friends know come Jjanga unless want charged extra horrible service wait 30 minutes first roll come out  <EOR> My boyfriend introduced place little while ago say awesome  expensive something everyone  He sushi connoisseur loves eat everything single thing menu  other hand only stomach few pieces raw fish before tap out  JJANGA All You Can Eat option doesn't apply everyone table which great because bf pig while enjoy few rolls love  Speaking rolls many ones tasted deeeelicious!  This place reallyyy good!  Very cool vibe chill sushi chefs  Def must try! <EOR> So disappointed service today  waitress unfriendly never returned table  flag down other people order refills  7 year old son pay full price AYCE  don't think return  <EOR> Pretty good rolls but satisfied freshness  sashimi   But variety great nice deco fun place   <EOR> Giving 3 stars service only food unfortunately would give 1 star  discuss some before when Kanji absolutely amazing  seen really great reviews place expected more  Only came husband's team dinner food free  never all eat sushi place don't think I'd ever try again  sushi everything else besides fried rice bland mean completely without flavor unless added soy sauce  fish tasted fish just nothing special memorable anything  Would back unless another team dinner would pay eat even if all eat  <EOR> My friend wanted AYCE sushi thought we'd try place never to  Jjanga list awhile why not  price right coming buck two cheaper Umiya usually to  server friendly dealing rowdy bunch throughout meal  All food good but did forget few things along way   I definitely wasn't fan handled check which bumped them down 3* instead 4*  believe manager came over handed bill then awkwardly stood 5 pulled cards cash tried figure divying bill  long time effectively cutting off but more tactful ways doing it  sure if server asked manager handle he took upon himself but again more polite ways bring check give time sort out   I'd again but if picking stick Umiya  <EOR> This favorite AYCE sushi place Las Vegas  food always fresh tasty good portions fish  incredible assortment items choose staff always polite friendly  recommend sitting bar best experience  Andy great chef other guys behind bar  number times never disappointed  <EOR> Food good used be  Different menu food served very messy way impressed new management every crew looked stressed but still mananged smile every costumer comes in  Mostly rolls full fake crab meat very little fish  used favorite Japanese AYCE place but now wouldn't even recommend it  <EOR> The place AYCS Las Vegas  always come JJangga everytime am Vegas  large selection different sushi rolls fresh ingredients friendly staff most all delicious food!!

Side note cucumber salad rather disappointing bland       but don't pick sushi restaurant based cucumber salad thus super minor!  The missing 5th star would service   server neither nor but definitely where he needed when he needed there!! <EOR> We lunch suggestion local friend ours while visiting Las Vegas  Jjanga hidden gem located Chinatown strip mall 20 minutes off strip  You'd local know it but well worth seeking out!   All eat sushi $30 made bit nervous  There's nothing worse bad sushi  But some freshest fish ever seen! miso soup yummy but son's yakisoba arrived severely undercooked chicken  When brought managements attention immediately apologized took off bill    Overall lose star raw poultry but still rate highly great sushi amazing price  <EOR> Where start sushi place bad?  Well    absolutely horrid just good terrible service   write first paragraph am torn between two stars   settled star   Let tell there   Food food    good   didn't sick didn't think fish tasted terrible all just very bland off   started off burritos which fish krab cucumber avocado wrapped rice rice paper wrap   best thing ate   actually said each other If all food we're totally sold place! however where things started worse     We ordered 2 dozen orders nigiri various fish top   Salmon yellow tail tuna squid scallops   usual thought rice should sushi rice taste fish should decent thickness good texture little chilly   place basically gave plain rice little no vinegar taste fish didn't know could cut thin   most confusing part fish warm   room temp but warm warm   sitting top oven turned didn't cook but warm   made stomach question its freshness     I also ordered couple cut rolls rice less rolls hand roll   alaska hand roll specific   call salmon slurry shoved into seaweed looks dog just puked piece salmon gristle   couldn't finish say least     Food being mediocre ok  2 3 star score why 1?  Service   After 45 minutes being seated   ordered twice eaten once   Funny since menu says Ordering time limit 45 minutes    mean seriously 45 minutes cut fish restaurant busy Friday afternoon   When say busy mean 3 tables people 6 people sushi bar   45 minutes!!! waitress responsible table kept walking past avoided eye contact add salt wound end she charged dinner prices instead lunch     Will come back?  NO   think worth suggesting others?  NO     TL DR Avoid all costs   does place 4 5 stars? <EOR> One fav ayce sushi spots town  many people carry smoked salmon but sure love **update still super bomb!!

The sushi chef Captain Choo Choo really nice friendly  staff seems very laid back fun  made some recommendations fish rolls try which saba mackarel which really super fishy some places  Fortunately actually really delicious here  flavorful without having extremely fishy taste  definitely impressed choice   All nigiri ordered fresh delicious fish  None them left bad taste mouth  Some memorable ones halibut yuzu yellowtail  Both them light sauce which didn't overpower light flavors fish   They also sushi burritos which gained popularity since popped norcal  ordered monkey burrito sushi burrito options usually come tempura shrimp some sort raw fish rice soy paper wrap  definitely big portion but delicious!

Several pieces nigiri came sauce top default   actually request without   Freshness fish ok   None died afterwards  Pretty sure shrimp cocktail drenched soy sauce base topped scallion advertised amaebi  1 order green tea green but might due lipstick contamination side cup   liquid very very light brown   server claimed green tea despite protest   Magically next cup tea suddenly very green    where Dirk Arthur performing all time!! didn't know uni came many colors   most suspect pieces left plate   server didn't even question it   She just took them away she knew  native Japanese dinnermates found tamago presentation hilarious   tamago house!

Getting place seems pretty sketch little hard find but trust find definitely worth !!!! restaurant modern looking really nice  paper lanterns placed around restaurant  guess could say ambiance really nice dinner AYCE definitely disappointed ! Everything super super super yummy ! really enjoyed Spicy Garlic Edamame ! must try bcs something different usual plain salted ones  Also appetizers seaweed salad very fresh yummy happy FRIES ! Bcs fry addict although did chance taste theirs  definitely try meat appetizer selection bcs very tender juicy ! love MEAT !   Going into rolls ! BACON BACON BACON ! definitely stood bacon roll  little skeptical bcs said fruit sauce but don't hesitant !!!!! ORDER ! very light sauce delicious ! Everything just compliments each other ! perfect especially those adventurous people there  favorites included Tuna Naruto ! really refreshing ! does over powering cucumber taste know may throw off some guests  also cool sushi burritos !!!! very unique menu but just normal roll  did enjoy sauce though   The best part night EXCELLENT SERVICE ! Definitely top notch Grade AAAAA++++ service any sushi restaurant ever and plenty ! JayJay or JJ best host he even sang which pretty great random  Everyone really friendly fun ! most important well attentive available when needed !   The only reason having 5 stars would ZERO pics sushi would look before order surprise box refer trusty ol' yelp give sneak preview  also roll fish fresh could also poke salad fish piece super fresh either    But DEFINITELY RETURN ! stamp cards probably top favorite sushi place Vegas moment even above beloved Goyemon other fav Yama sushi   *******On other visits service okay  always walk pass us  hard even order there's usually wait rolls  need sort assign someone serve each table  <EOR> The staff family  food Great! Really can't wrong any choices  drive all way South West Valley completely worth it  LOVE Jjanga!! <EOR> The food consistently great!   combined great service attention detail definitely keep coming back! <EOR> I don't know write but best sushi bar USA! Food fresh! Service excellent very friendly fast! If Vegas more time come  godly place <EOR> We took visiting family member tonight opted AYCE sushi which landed Jjanga  opted AYCE dinner which $25 95 per person  also happy hour option few bucks cheaper but excluded most specialty items  when comes sushi all rice  Call picky but when rice isn't right amount sticky falling rolls   well kinda drives crazy  wasn't case definitely plus  ordered few rolls start none them special  won't even begin talk names  All all all just bland even though drenched sauce    We figured some saki beer could things more enjoyable while looking around server noticed sign center restaurant stating alcohol being served  huge disappointment because unaware uninformed point already late leave  attempted question server but she just brushed off did we  point really no choice  Moving along decided best ordered variety other items  favorites being tofu garlic edamame crab balls golden scallops  Everything else again just okay    Not long requested check requested ice cream mochi desert waited  check came 2 seconds fifteen minutes later still no ice cream  flagged server down told worry desert leave  Overall best AYCE experience but also wasn't worst  hoping more enjoyable alcoholic version AYCE sushi dinner guest unfortunately things just didn't work favor  Perhaps better luck next time   well if ever decide drive across town again give go  <EOR> I don't think ever worse service sushi place  Tell why     1  Tell why waitress gave food order another table  45 mins later    2  Tell why ask FIVE different people oysters including manager  3  Tell why 113 degrees outside yet feels 150 degrees Jjanga  A C needs upgrade  FAN home works better tbh  Unless want feel you're sauna then move along  4  Tell why you're short staffed when EVO town  Also summer  Hashtag prepared  5  Tell why we're getting food    yet we're getting food did order? Lucky them  least someone restaurant being served  =] 6  Jjanga?
