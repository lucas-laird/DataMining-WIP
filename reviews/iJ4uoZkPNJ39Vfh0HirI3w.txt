The ramen itself cannot give 5 stars good don't wrong but chashu slimy broth lacks fortitude recommend white pepper but hey we're lucky living golden age ramen bars I'd lose Yelp cred if called 5 star ramen but ANYWAY you'll probably see bar sipping Hakashu over light rocks   <EOR> Lunch Dec  2015  Ramen undercooked bowl lacked flavor   don't think food snob just Asian guy eats Ramen places twice month worst   Would come back only happy hour try non Ramen dishes   Service atmosphere good  Food 0 5 Service 4 5 Atmosphere 4 5 <EOR> I headed downtown Las Vegas dinner another restaurant but stumbled upon gem while looking parking  glad decided come instead! ramen flavorful fairly priced  drink menu awesome well  All restaurant staff friendly helpful making menu choices  ambiance awesome played old school hip hop music coolest art  definitely back next time Las Vegas! <EOR> Itsy Bitsy tucked away busier parts downtown Ogden but absolutely destination itself  full bar addition main dining area drinks well prepared food  server Frank absolutely great funny engaging attentive  ordered chicken katsu ramen skeptical breaded chicken would hold ramen bowl but happily surprised  noodles cooked perfectly katsu remained crispy flavorful throughout  friends also sampled Angry Dragon Itsy Bitsy's delicious take mule   also stronger mule watch out!

But Itsy Bitsy's tonkotsu pleasant though very flavorful   breathed life into broth adding chili oil then satisfied it   with exception charged $1 extra egg and another HALF egg   guess personal thang but give entire frakking egg chrissakes!   Anyhow    Chicken Katsu Burger Shaved cabbage tomato spiced tonkatsu sauce   Ok now burger tasted YUMMY!!  YUMMMYYYYY!!  BUT here's thing did taste very Katsu esque   specifically katsu chicken BURGER instead ramen version because wanted bathe katsu sauce envisioning head   But actually came burger more sweet wasabi situation  did Katsu all when bit but because delicious wasn't disappointed dressing served mixed greens came burger was   fragrantly funky though funky old bad sour just funky in   hell mouth never tasted before      Spicy tuna hand roll Pretty basic came two pieces highest quality tuna but bad either     Kizakura Nigori sake Delicious!

The ramen best ramen ever had  Adding spicy meat corn best decision life  Kayla server smile service made meal even more enjoyable  hope other servers great she is!   This place way up  Cool atmosphere  Great food  <EOR> Pretty average meal if ask me  If wasn't location word whiskey title wouldn't even tried it    The ramen itself both vegetarian Tonkatsu bases we're just your average flavor  ingredients seemed thrown together sculpted true Ramen dish  portion size quite good however each ramen comes egg chasu bean sprouts which nice considering many places charge fee many those ingredients    The price just under $11 ramen each drink around $8 12  There's interesting Japanese whiskey try if interested but sure really ramen    Service horrible start finish waiting seated waiting order waiting food more waiting check  meal 2 ramen took hour forty five minutes  back future many better ramen spots town many better food options downtown same price point  <EOR> If remember sushi love place  ramen spot ramen actually pretty darn good  sushi other hand    they could without  If sushi great would give spot 5 stars! great romantic dinner great service spectacular ambience  If you're looking little spot grub bit pre funk going before starting your night downtown it  DJ spinning great touch  definitely back! <EOR> We tried Ramen Whiskey quiet Sunday afternoon  appetizer good  garlic chile edamame added unique twist familiar snack  ramen quite good especially broth extra portions pork  only town week but try visit again  <EOR> After three days working anime convention and living pizza Del Taco really really REALLY wanted some ramen  meaning try place while ending Downtown said on  Ordered build your own ramen did thick noodles tonkotsu broth extra pork sweet corn  broth amazing salty slightly creamy life affirming  pork super tender adding sweet corn definitely good move since added nice sweet component saltiness  some mint chip mochi dessert great too   The service excellent very friendly not something necessarily expect places Downtown anymore but  another discussion   definitely back  <EOR> How hell does place good reviews? all paid reviews? Tonkatsu ramen tasted salty bath water  effing pathetic  spicy meat add just literally ground beef no flavor  Cooked horribly  salmon hand rolls overpriced is  special Japanese sausage tastes Walmart 98 cent hot dogs  crap garbage  all reviewers drunk off whiskey? Because guys all crack    Notice mad sound? Coz can't believe spent $60 garbage  <EOR> Finally another new ramen place located outside Chinatown!  Great location easy access downtown area     There's plenty seating when went   Clean hipsterish atmosphere     We mushroom spring rolls tonkatsu ramen spicy pork     This first time trying mushroom spring rolls good   came 4 pieces   The tonkatsu good   wasn't salty alot ramen places around town however lacked salt flavor begin with   guess don't put msg broth if made fresh?  better enough salt much salt always add it   Overall still enjoyed tonkatsu ramen      The servers very nice   owner manager I forgot he was nice enough check see liked food gave some insight restaurant works   noodles made fresh food made fresh everyday  <EOR> After living Japan more few years difficult rate Ramen shop states    place however able satisfy Ramen urge    atmosphere very comfortable great selection Japanese whiskey    say whiskey over priced ex   Hibiki 12 $20 two ounce pour     Overall enjoyed food atmosphere drinks  all ask for! <EOR> Smack dab heart Fremont area cute super clean ramen sushi joint   I'm down raw fish but grub some noodles all day long!

Delicious  Quick friendly service  <EOR> Amazing! can't wrong here  always come smile leave laughing! Thank chef amazing staff! literally tried everything always amazing <EOR> I Downtown area when suddenly began craving Ramen took Yelp normally checked see if any Ramen restaurants nearby  first list because distance guess because name hey kinda catchy! boyfriend decided give try   Tip definitely little hard find if you're really paying attention  actually inside Ogden hotel where upon walking restaurant through doors your right  don't signage anywhere knowledge only figured passed when saw people eating ramen inside paper along glass saying entrance way arrows pointing behind us   The noodles nothing spectacular  decent  ordered mine Tonkotsu broth no additional toppings because they're all extra cost  quite surprising see even oil additional charge  Oil??? All other Ramen restaurants generous leaving oils sesame seeds togadashi etc side table   The layout restaurant really nice decorated hip paintings  staff friendly time around 6pm Sunday only table people eating  Quiet   It's bit pricey definitely something would recommend friends if craving Ramen but if area mood Ramen knows maaaaaybe come back  But perhaps not  <EOR> I am meh ramen here  Good egg butter corn though thought pork potstickers lot better  <EOR> Easy location walk if you're staying downtown near Freemont St  Food great tasty  only reason didn't give 5 stars service   Quick wait seated but then waited 20 minutes someone take order  food came pretty quickly but took another 20 minutes another reminder waitress bring 1 lemonade spoons  drink ended getting comped wait thanks that !  Overall would eat again but would hope staffed properly next time  <EOR> While waiting tour nearby Neon Museum decided stop grab quick bite down street Ogden    First impression  very similar Park Fremont's decor its artwork wooden fixtures  Clean crisp  pretty empty when went  few chairs looked straight made material moscow mule mugs  If isn't sign another gosh darn hipster restaurant then don't know is  downtown Las Vegas continues gentrify no surprise place attempts cater hip happenin'   The BF some chicken teriyaki bowl option brown white rice  Since ramen place opted try some soup $10 50 Choice thin thick noodles I chose thick choice broth  tonkotsu shoyu miso I shoyu all bowls already include green onion bean sprouts braised pork cured egg  offer other add'l toppings $1 each added fish cake but honestly couldn't distinguish if added bowl not   I didn't any whiskey sad say but did sip watermelon lychee lemonade which favorite part meal  ramen just okay  several more authentic places town them mile but fair give props joint's ambiance  <EOR> Great food  Great pricing  Great wait staff  Simple that  Definitely suggest place! <EOR> I super impressed place  came happy hour FREE unlimited champagne girls Thursday night 8 10pm  champagne actually really good  Sometimes bad champagne when its free  servers bar outstanding  super friendly accommodating  friends ordered beer didn't right away  server didn't charge it    Mainly came free champagne  However also karaoke  enjoyed small atmosphere  soon signed usually next list  People crowd would cheer even though am best singer  appreciated that  host fantastic!

We LOVED skewers appetizer steak delicious  sweet yam miso butter awesome  did care seaweed salad app  tasted very fishy   Drinks good average price  think HH specials but 7 none us  The service ok  quite wait table but watching Mets kill Cubs all good! <EOR> Came friend mine last night  heard place coworker wanted give try since we're ramen junkies  appetizers shishito peppers kurobuta pork sausage  Both delicious! peppers came couple lemon wedges sausage came some caramelized onions *thumbs up*  'create your own ramen bowl' threw loop because most places various already designed bowls but each ordered different style bowls sampled each other's  both loved broth chose I tonkotsu he miso saltiness spam nice contrast fatty pork  only gripe wish full egg instead only half but always add next time  Overall place win  definitely back!

Decor interesting kept wandering whole time loved !! <EOR> I almost didn't stop because recent negative reviews bad service  glad disregarded those  Stopped early Monday evening impressed food service  server Ilse very attentive knowledgeable menu  Great music vibe artwork   I'll bring friends when stop Freemont again! <EOR> Stopped before attending event Ogden  Happy Hour includes $6 martinis nice selection menu items  first thing noticed cool copper chairs  Classy! I $5 Happy Hour Ramen very good! nice portion very tasty  paired well $6 Lychee martini which needed lychee garnish  addition would've super impressed! still very memorable cocktail probably comparable price quality every other new  hip bar around Fremont serving days  did notice $2 PBR draft menu option lot! Maybe  homage Fremont past    The place wasn't busy when arrived 5 30 ish  few more souls showed while bar  Food served cute fortune chopstick combo dining partner adored  Since Great Downtown Parking debacle happened much less likely there  lucky could park Ogden because event  told don't give passes Itsy Bitsy patrons likely won't going back there  <EOR> Downtown LV trying hard Hipster central    and working!  Joining neighborhood new hipster ramen shop Itsy Bitsy modern decor somewhat uncomfortable disturbing artwork but also slew punny well named cocktails cute brass colored bar chairs place fits right DTLV scene  Service friendly staff all very young enthusiastic!   However ramen just mehhhhhhh  soy egg came way salty toppings stingy  noodles ok bouncy usually them broth overall just ok  thick noodles tonkatsu broth plus spicy meat  spicy ground pork nice but char sui pork almost all fat little flavor    We did order pork potstickers share which probably highlight meal  skin nice texture bottoms nice crispy  However filling wasn't anything excited about    Also weird thing   the sinks bathrooms outside?   Overall would drive into downtown just ramen but if already wouldn't mind coming again  <EOR> Itsy Bitsy such cute name! first glance you'd think you're another hipster ramen place San Francisco California  Unfortunately place standards Ramen Asian Fusion joint  place though relatively clean well decorated well maintained staff   If you're interested checking place should Groupon deal which $20 bucks $40 worth food  price paid definitely money's worth including two free Sake drinks Yelp check in   For appetizers ordered Chicken bites $5 50 which beyond delicious! Unfortunately portions little  tempted even buy another because good  perfectly cooked tender flavorful  dipping sauce just addicting  If ever come again would order two dishes alone! Trust won't regret it   For ramen each ordered Tonkotsu Ramen thick noodles $10   Unfortunately noodles just only thick thing bowl  wasn't impressed broth all  Every ramen lover knows broth break ramen joints didn't live standards  point thought eating instant noodle Maruchan  Thankfully noodles well cooked right texture steer back  wasn't fan chashu pork slices egg either  both didn't resonated broth opinion    To top off ordered Chicken Katsu bowl brown rice $10   Portion wise gave lot rice salad compared chicken  However chicken appetizer really juicy tasty! seriously  If ever come again which again say reservation I'd sure order this!  Overall interesting experience extremely hungry looking quick dinner  staff very pleasant helpful throughout experience  really took care seated promptly upon arrival  However great service awesome decor live performances oh did mention people singing covers! cute! weren't enough convince give place anymore stars  <EOR> i really appreciated wide variety toppings offered ramen  although happy hour menu very extensive $8 PBR bowl deal great value highly recommend! staff friendly service quick  mostly enjoyed ambience  spacious upscale unlike other ramen houses to  can't wait return! <EOR>
