Easily spilt between two people  Eggplant Parmigiana excellent well house salad vinaigrette  Just good place enjoy nice night Vegas  <EOR> Came last night extremely disappointed  First all entire menu EXTREMELY overpriced which suppose expected Vegas but almost $30 plain penne vodka? Come on  Secondly fair warning entire menu totally veal oriented  if don't eat veal your options very limited  ended ordering shell pasta ricotta shrimp fra diavolo  shell pasta cooked properly very hard  diavolo sauce good spicy but shrimp chewy gross  Also waiter wasn't attentive he other tables surrounding us  supposing because younger 26 but shouldn't matter since all paying same prices right? Long story short left hungry spent close $200 total insanity  your stomach pocket favor skip place  <EOR> If your $200 bottle red wine chilled white your drinking water mixed sprite your meals over priced take forever drink orders taken only half your table staff rude  accommodating then you've found place go  Considering brought party 10 all locals Las Vegas horrible experience right moment came in  consistently ask silverware drinks linens etc   None event return  Vegas many choices better food service  <EOR> I no idea history original Rao's when came group people dinner though party tried fruitlessly years eat original kind enough tell famed sauce meatballs    Since he all expectations seeing finally eat meatballs enormous veal parmesan underwhelmed nice high expectations ruin dream meal   special seasonal pasta purses blue cheese pears cranberries sage butter sauce tasty though lemon chicken friend ordered seemed *the* dish   waiter those old school guys who'd working high end restaurants Vegas since days Frank Sammy he certainly added ambiance since schizophrenic music selection Christmas Motown bit Italian thrown measure didn't much   And outside small misunderstanding wine order where sommelier gal opened bottle 4x price ordered enjoyable if bit overpriced food ambiance   But hey Vegas right? <EOR> OKAY    know Caesars Palace but gourmet! Okay admit pasta good but DEFINITELY worth 32 bucks tip    32 FREAKING BUCKS    MEAN seriously could bought three sandwiches fed friends  Also pizzas friends order 20 bucks tip tax   mean SERIOUSLY 20 dollars pizza worth it  rather normal cheap pizza cheap ass hotel spend 20 dollars pizza WORLD       THE PASTA VODKA something blah blah good but good enough deserves four stars me  Excuse ambiance nice but actually want spend money elsewhere! Let alone drop 30 some pasta thats world! definitely recommend place anyone! Save your money time buffet instead! <EOR> Great food large portions  meatballs really delicious!

What's weird maybe two months ago eggplant definitely breaded fried   lacking flavor but still least cooked should be   must changed recipe but better  My other issue possibly charge $44 small piece chicken parm spaghetti!?!?! If paying $44 chicken parm better size dinner plate best thing ever tasted   know Vegas but come on   that's just ridiculous! Unfortunately coworkers weren't really thrilled dinners either   saying just something home  However am happy report meatballs still melt your mouth good! thing still going them  I really hope next time Vegas try some new recipes fix eggplant parm! <EOR> Terrible  send everything back totally mediocre  marinara sauce tasted can  Spending kind money ridiculous <EOR> The vibe when walk into Rao's going great italian restaurant  decor architecture pretty neat  sitting down ordering nice bottle wine family preceded sip wine figure going eat  each only ordered pasta dish due indulgence breakfast lunch   wine expert sommelier     sure    made feel comfortable rushed all felt welcome enjoy ourselves  finally told server order which consisted spaghetti pear pasta rigatoni believe  ONLY 3 4 minutes food came revealing pre made probably heated up  busboy transferred food heat saving dish plates front us  tasting food OKAY  wasn't bad but also nothing rave about  only other italian place eaten Vegas Carmine's which located Forum shops Caesars would 100% say tastier  am sure much better more authentic italian food pre made found all over Vegas  would recommend Rao's anyone visiting Las Vegas  <EOR> They great service nice atmosphere  But Man    happened food?

Great time pasta improved least spaghetti marinara meatballs! sauce kind dry  But salad mozzarella perfect! <EOR> This become place Vegas   assume draw partly subliminal when lived NYC called couple times reservation told call back next year through 5 6 large jars pasta sauce every month   the food good but great Italian   buffalo mozzarella appetizer excellent   service good but waiters annoying habit sitting down your table now if odd number people always move extra chair another table   deserts good but time ordered grappa gasoline harsh kind   Also time cast View sat table next which would very exciting Star Jones still around <EOR> We very high expectations Rao's lived them  easy do!

Ouch!  great place show don't care value product   example Caesar Salad $15   better Caesar Italian Village Chicago?  even close IMHO   croutons good though   I Spaghetti Bolognese upgraded linguini no problems   nice dish pasta large but $28?  worth all if came around $12 most would acceptable   spending over $40 plate pasta salad no drinks unthinkable unless something magical food   only magic disappearance money   For appetizers family platter calamari few shrimp fillet white fish   Great texture calamari but sure other restaurants same quality much less   meatballs marinara sauce really good tender flavourful nice size   If restaurant some notoriety food   Looks Wolf Wall Street took bite me    <EOR> Enjoyed pleasant family dinner Rao's evening   nice experience fairly decent food   Two dishes quite tasty pasta clams pasta peas prosciutto   Probably best part whole experience watching server transfer pasta serving dish plate    table side   Fun!

The food good but great  veal particularly tender which seems would signature veal  paid same amount lamb dish Circo days later weren't even same league   I high hopes seeing hearing much Rao's but left very disappointed wouldn't recommend Rao's you  didn't expect good famous New York original never but reasonable facsimile would nice  <EOR> Greatest meatball ever!

Overall   tell unimpressed whole situation just smiled ate ordered more wine  gotta say   food really unimpressive  main gripe 'American Style' Italian food over abundance sauce lack flavor   high end place Rao's   would expected non issue  so  Really bland Sausage Broccoli Rabe unflavored red sauce couple meatballs really just non existent anything over top delicious  Aside bottle Ripasso place dinner stopped dining few bites  Just good    The bartenders bar very nice smiling made great martini  saving bit evening even smiled wished good night left  around $300 3 probably near average per person price but far less average dining experience  Sorry  Better luck if try out  won't back dinner  <EOR> Great food stop when wandering Vegas strip   Since pretty much impossible reservation Rao's Manhattan soon saw Vegas stop in!  during lunch there's no need reservations there's some tables outside aka overlooking busy hallway giving almost sidewalk feel sit bar which some nice sunken corners 3    Wait staff somewhat slow but food really good   Dont wrong staff really nice but ya   service sllooowwwww   noticed few people frustrated getting food time having leave waiting more 5 mns pay check   Mind busy   Bar area only half full   Most conference people no idea if made time no rush enjoyed ourselves right break time before dinner   *Affettati Misti thinly sliced parma prosciuto soppressata cubed provolone cheese gaeta olives pickled cornichons sweet marinated garlic mache greens   Delicious sure severely increase your salt intake    *Le Polpotte di Rao's traditional Rao's meatballs served tomato sauce   2 HUGE succulent flavorful meatballs some best tomato sauce   Hands down some best sauce  Really  *Bianca Foccacia really great flatbread both dishes   cut salt mop sauce   Bread crisp outside fluffy inside   Great olive oil rosemary sea salt sprinkled on   We'll definitely return next time we're Vegas since takes 3 4 months table nyc     <EOR> The first time great  next 3 visits disaster! Food gone way down quality  Horrible steak visit #2 clams sick last visit  mention lack attention waiter  prices charge service should fabulous friendly  not!  If must   the calamari meatballs good  <EOR> Inexpensive compared other restaurants Caesar's but still pricey pasta  came some comfort food given NYC location mere mortal am   I Tagliolini Peas Ham described Fresh made tagliolini pasta prosciutto cotto sweet peas diced shallots light cream sauce  ever  taste fresh sauce light flavorful same time  escort Shell Pasta Ricotta Sauce large shell pasta red sauce gloop ricotta bring all together  Delicious! split ground veal pork beef meatballs which very good  He would describe them very *very* good   Definetly full end meal  course liked but pasta what's like? Maybe NY scene raves place    maybe Vegas real estate    conspired affect expectations  good yes  did blow away  wouldn't recommend    but wouldn't recommend sense? Definetly horrific but superb either  just sort     there  <EOR> I disappointed  still disappointed  place supposed best Italian food ever quite frankly wasn't  layout place its beautiful people work awesome but expectations high food low  would come back though  dont know when since many other restaurants try LV but if only places open certain day then yes count in  don't even remember ordered  bad sign  bread tasty though  <EOR> Had dinner right when opened dinner place pretty empty wait short   Ordered appetizer share between other person pasta each glass wine each  food mediocre   my friend ordered ravioli cranberries which much better penne vodka ordered   Probably wouldn't come back here   food just ok extremely overpriced  <EOR> We warned Rao's gets very very busy around 7pm saturday night right actually pretty empty  ate bar indifferent service  Ordered Caesar meatballs start  Caesar par Caesar Applebees total waste money calories topped pathetic box croutons  meatballs other hand some finest ever had   lemon chicken really happy powerful flavors  Wife spaghetti marinara so so  did enjoy some surprisingly good obscure Italian red wines glass   hit miss but want try again  <EOR> Really enjoyed atmosphere service food  split cesar salad lasagna  salad huge perfectly dressed  lasagna huge enough two very flavorful  <EOR> In word nostalgia   The food isn't bad but many great restaurants Las Vegas really shouldn't waste your time overpriced mediocre food Rao's   If NY can't table maybe serve some emotional purpose you   But take your money Bouchon instead  <EOR> My husband back East therefore picky Italian food  seems every time he disappointed its never good  But Rao's another story  All staff host helper waiter food runner everyone kind personable  bread awesome  husband meatballs appetizer he said literally best meatball he's ever had  tender nailed marinara sauce  He Penne Vodka meal completely cleaned plate  only complaint food grilled veggies no butter oil  looked if sitting under heat light long time few veggies the arugula something squishy tasted licorice couldn't even eat because apparently don't those all  But orders just dry veggies Italian place? Probably just bad choice part because everything else awesome  Thanks making husband happy! <EOR> I could eat Italian food breakfast lunch dinner every single day    because places cuisine won over  wish Rao's hometown! old school know right  decor certainly nothing fancy  based off original restaurant NYC both locations keep Christmas decorations year round pictures celebrity diners covering walls  However lacks prettiness more food     The food oh glorious food! admit carboholic bread basket offers variety tasty options  also best caesar salads around husband usually split start off meal  most recent dish tried favorite date    Penne Vodka  simple dish but sauce just perfect! dining companions all favored dish well particular selections but did enjoy own entrees very much say least  know husband loved monsterous portion lasagna   Rao's continue go to spot husband when town  never disappoints when you're mood good hearty Italian meal     often  <EOR> I psyched dine but ended being big disappointment    food service average eggplant parm poor    better eggplant parm any pizza joint New Jersey    Carmine's would better choice  dined Carmine's NYC Atlantic City many times never disappointed    OK meatballs wee good but good everything else overlooked  <EOR> I admit give review based taste overall food experience only  Average best  Granted am New Yorker eaten best Italian food homemade best NYC  If another place think Olive Garden Italian food then would say experience amazing   I am impressed but again may be   <EOR> This first stop food trip Vegas slow introduction gastromic excess figured would wrong   sure enough very pleased got!  waiter fabulous started fritto misto other tentacle calamari ate all overly greasy   specials night sounded great scallops over lemony risotto husband prosciutto wrapped cod over parmesan risotto   Top off strawberry shortcake made change mind being served over biscuit We sponge cake angel food cake family happy lady   All few drinks each also cheapest dinner trip $150  <EOR> Lovely restaurant great atmosphere   Very nice bar   Read many reviews   try meatballs    absolutely delicious!

Place very cool looking come full meal next time but try meatballs SUPER GOOD! <EOR> I surprised extremely fast service  food came perfect order  waitress forgot name  But she blond bun last night around 6 30pm sitting area pictures owner shaking hands Bill Clinton  She very friendly waters always filled up  When reached half mark glass water filled right away  addition bread basket constantly refilled  tell employees all great service making sure people more satisfied  recommend getting linguine clams for first course pork chops chicken scapriello your entree! Great experience hopefully able into NYC location which very rare extremely hard table for  <EOR> Since restaurant East Harlem booked advance last 35+ years really really wanted try Raos Vegas  might never chance try those legendary meatballs NYC could only chance    Alright ordered two meatballs appetizer Penne alla Vodka main course  meal came rather plain jane bread good fresh but nothing spectacular    So meatballs 5oz each covered thinly sweet Marinara sauce sans any pasta  Real Italian Polpettine perhaps little large Napoli but delicious soft while retaining exterior form prevents them mushing  tasted beef pork veal parsley garlic  Yum yum  Oh yum yum!  Ah Penne alla Vodka? Now served while still chowing meatballs haha  did write that? faux pax serving but forgive them  Now sauce little thick taste think loosening some starchy pasta water would helped  But deliciously creamy nice pepper bite delicate balance pancetta garlic  graininess vodka perceptible but overwhelming    Well done  <EOR> The restraunt bigger looks   asked booth no problem    ordered antipasto two delicious    really liked salami   ordered meatballs spaghetti marinara delicious    Wife ordered angel hair pasta seafood tasty huge shrimp!   Tiramisu dessert wonderful nice fonseca   Thank Raos great dinner  <EOR> So live CT tried YEARS into Rao's NY knowing totally impossible but hoping anyway but decided while Vegas we'd see all hype about  Upon arriving 10 p m  Vegas time Monday night told didn't table two despite being able see many open tables    ok we're happy sit bar  bartender super nice very helpful suggestions food wine  tried Tuscan red 1st time despite being AVID wine drinkers Italian food restaurant fans great  husband Chicken Scappiolini or something menu isn't available line bartenders suggestion he LOVED it! Tons chicken bone in sausage smothered red yellow green sweet hot peppers onions garlic  Smelled amazing! Ravioli Pillows beggars purses stuffed Ricotta pear wow light parmesean butter sage cranberry oil sauce      rich decadent delish!!! Absolutely delicious dinner  recommend Rao's believe hype now  continue pursuit NY location but would definitely return Vegas well  <EOR> just back vegas go   world famous meatballs tremendously average   pasta dish just average appetizer glorified mozzarella stick   bread vinagrette olive oil good but come here  amount paid simply wasn't worth it   decor great waiters great  but thats why eat id rather great food dive crap food really nice place   really romano's mac grill more worth guys gals  <EOR> Besides meatball food good   veal piccotta which drowned sauce mash potatoes box!!! <EOR> Really loved beet salad lemon chicken here! Very good! Expensive but prepared it  lol <EOR> We enjoyed dinner but paid don't know if worth it  top service mediocre best  When paying 15 dollars glass wine really costs 15 dollars bottle could least amazing server server wasn't amazing  ordered mussels     to which mussel's     we clams     not great    I don't love clams though  then eggplant Parmesan husband chicken dish onions peppers  entree's good but don't know if worth price though  <EOR> The food ok    although very disappointed clams oreganata appetizer the clams rubbery   prices very high Italian food many other Italian restaurants Vegas where food better almost half price  But if your staying Caesars don't feel traveling should able decent meal place    as long don't mind paying premium prices <EOR> Date night very Italian boyfriend  9 30 Tuesday night mediocre if that   ordered meatballs penne vodka clam linguine house Chianti vodka soda   Meatballs good everyone says are  must try! would order more plate   Penne vodka Italian haven't best but nothing special   Clam linguine pass x thousand  Gross  Smelled rotten almost  Taste even worse  Frank? server ok  Wish he asked if needed anything else another glass wine but late night understand he wanted home  work food too  House Chianti spectacular btw  Order bottle if can  All all average rating  better Italian restaurants probably won't back  much selection but Italian all   <EOR> Rao's may win big points creating most imaginative dishes most powerful flavors but where counts really consistent solid food worth eating all around!    The coworkers family style sharing several fine dishes   giant meatball side you 2 could own meal   Topped some Parmesan cheese meatballs excellent   also special linguini pasta crab light fettucini olive oil sauce   clams well delicious little smaller side but full flavor baked perfection   food amount most part nearly worked hitting middle ground good sized portion sharing eating alone   Additionally bunch different types bread olive bread cracker dip your own olive oil balsamic vinaigrette!  ended meal profiteroles drenched chocolate sauce great finish   The price all dishes ended $50 per person shabby when think amount food hitting up   server super super friendly staff diligent refilling water taking away plates done   seating nice well right pool Winter closed made nice serene view   Seating seems pretty plentiful well nice middle circle bar   find Rao's it'll deeper into Casino Bacchanal sushi stand as well dessert place across way       Rao's isn't best Italian ever bad but sure plentiful tasty enough just enjoy yourself Vegas   prices aren't exorbitant feel you're being treated well   If you're looking Italian nice place Strip Rao's solid all around  <EOR> Service good but food pretty bad    ordered lasagna bolognese tasted meat ragu sauce over spaghetti    wife does 100 times better     She orderd shrimp scampi which also sub par    Stay away unless u just wana drinks people watch    <EOR> I dislike Caesar's begin with  so  so  SO much! Then throw s*** show Rao's might well home    We large party 17 called advance reservations  indicated split into 2 groups because couldn't seat 17 together  great but ok  failed mention would seat 45 minutes apart even though restaurant 1 2 empty!   The food whole different pile! obvious everything pre cooked sitting under heat lamps before being sauced served   All meats dry tough pastas over cooked nearly mushy  No able past 1 2 plate before just giving disgust   With much great food Vegas DON'T waste any time here! <EOR> My husband dined wedding dinner great experience us! servers great gave fabulous recommendations  really enjoyed meatballs other yelpers right them! also Chicken Parmigiana paired lovely Pinot Noir which delicious well  dessert Peanut Butter Tart which pure heaven    If you're looking lovely restaurant intimacy amazing food  special occasion excellent choice! <EOR> Came last month dinner  love history place waiting try it  food great atmosphere cool  review server Angelia  She helpful funny fast accommodating everything she recommended perfect  come back just her  <EOR> Meal good but charging $18 glass house merlot most expensive half full glass house wine strip  pure theft  reason never back  <EOR> Hands down best meal Vegas    Those meatballs kill me!

They pear gorgonzola stuffed tortellini's best   Served butter pine nuts   Wow   Another winner Pepperoni Arrostitti which Roasted Red Bell Peppers Tossed Golden Raisins Pine Nuts   Incredible   The pasta perfect   recommend Orecchiette because idea eating little ears aside fact its entirely delicious san marzano tomato sauce   As main course try Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken   Don't ask why just try send thank note later     Another main course need try but maybe same sitting    maybe Pollo Scarpariello Chicken Sauteed Hot Sweet Italian Sausage Yellow Red Bell Peppers in White Wine Sauce    Try send thanks later same place   The meatballs?  does say perfection?  When waiter brought couple meatballs without asking them   said didn't order    He said Try them   don't them they're me  Well gone when he came back 20 minutes later check us   Enough said   The Italian Ricotta Cheese Cake sweet but sweet Cannoli   Both perfect coffee espresso some anisette   really can't wrong place   And why decorated Christmas all year round?  Because previous owner year decided leave decorations holidays never took them down again at NYC location    Its tribute him     Oh if see huge ox man front thats Tiny   Say hi but nice   desert big place friend  <EOR> This restaurant major disappointment   other Yelpsters found food very bland expecting given its New York reputation prices   opinion food level Olive Garden below Pasta Pomodoro   YIKES!  primary reason fairly decent reviews because going see show Caesar's   couple bad experiences eating hotel restaurants Vegas   I'll stick those standalone restaurant businesses now e g  Maggiano's Casa Di Amore   <EOR> 3 5 stars! host front little rude but overall experience wasnt bad   needed find place eat before show Raos only able take party 9 short notice but wasnt line something see why  service average waiter seem annoyed something but end he nicer   food average me  ordered lemon chicken good but flavorful mashed potatoes die though  Taste its scratch buttery!

Next time trying food! <EOR> My family chose restaurant because line Bachanal seemed long  ordered crab carbonara wife ordered veal parmesan kids split chicken sun dried tomato penne dish   The crab carbonara lacking any flavor which odd because medely visible ingredients    The veal mammoth chunk flattened meat itself plate    nearly tender should completely underwhelming every regard   The chicken penne dish equally lackluster  sun dried tomatoes dried all chicken pieces gristle sauce flavorless   Additionally service less stellar  food took quite while come waitress apparently forgot people eat need pay leave some point   Overall very disappointing experience  Definitely wouldn't come back ever recommend place anyone  <EOR> Fun Enjoyable   If looking some fun dining experiences strip Rao's fun traditional establishment   Reservations Book early if because popular place due Rao's New York   Good Groups accommodate groups many sizes   Service service worth 5   definitely know stuff tell popular   Overall working together create great meal experience   Starters bad all  5 but 3 either  3 75!  a   Meatballs five actually ordered 3 meatballs split  rather large larger anticipate perfect   b   Pasta split two Fusilli Sausage Cabbage  Very nice light  ordered two dishes while rather small all bit helping fine   sausage cabbage nice mix   c  Antipasto Della Casa Very nice  Besides all normal meats cheese peppers tomatoes olives also give gran padano cheese  favorite     d   Roasted Peppers Very nice pine nuts!

DINNER RESERVATIONS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! place very busy!  I ordered *ANTIPASTI Fritto Misto fried calamari cod fish shrimp zucchini $24 I little hesitant mix but exceeded expectations  shrimp gigantic calamari fried perfectly  Sharing recommended because great portion size   *PRIMI Spinach Ricotta Ravioli $30 These ravioli great vegetarian entree  Ravioli pretty large equally delicious    *Bottle Pinot Grigio $60  *The meatballs huge friend enjoyed them greatly $19   I would definitely return near future <EOR> I love it! Great service good menu good food good wine great decor! You Las Vegas but feels Italy  <EOR> Very good service everything ordered tasted very good but easily replicated any quality Italian restaurant  decor warm but space tight definitely stage y vibe inauthenticity  Like Family Guy episode where Peter opens decorates Applebees type restaurant throwing bunch sh*t walls  You're better off spending money unique dining experience LV making reservation Rao's NYC  <EOR> So damn good would idiotic amazing caprasee salad  Service great  Very Expensive  Totally suggest it!!! <EOR> It's while since last visit Las Vegas  most memorable times when wife dined Rao's Caesar's Palace  Being two times before  made point dine short visit town  made reservations morning dinner evening phone no problem  Once arrived Caesar's night  walked through casino floor past few shops restaurant  Inside hotel challenge travel but hotel staff very helpful directions if lost  The service Rao's night exceptional  waitress Angela amazing  wait staff just good  Never dirty plate fork etc  whole dinner  Water glass always full  Asked Angela some recommendations she spot on  She really knew stuff made feel special  The food speaks itself  Rao's best meatballs anywhere  No does better  famous good reason  If come here  Start that  haven't lived until eaten meatballs  am serious  There isn't anything bad menu tried  salads pasta dishes pork chops  Yum yum more yum  Dessert? classic cheese cake  Delicious  Rao's wife's favorite place dine Vegas  service top notch  dining classy romantic old school  food epically amazing  wish could give Rao's more stars  deserve it  Bravo Rao's  wife your fans  <EOR> Tough arrive rating Rao's   Several things done really well some things done okay thing really bad service wasn't great   But overall more good or very good bad arrive 4 star rating   We reservations 8 Friday   arrived promptly only wait couple minutes while set table up   didn't love placement table put middle dining room afterthought   much room maneuver other tables all top asked move accommodated   server brought water wine list   wine list above average Strip prices you'd expect pay   Appropriately several Italian wines list   somm great he came over offered some assistance very friendly   The bread service good served 3 types butter   favorite red pepper   start 2 appetizers baked clams bruschetta two pastas linguine white claim sauce rigatoni filletto    appetizers average probably least impressive parts meal   baked clams mostly bread crumbs over salted   did nice crust top broiler   bruschetta good fresh but could used more balsamic  very basic    Of pastas linguine vastly superior   loaded clams white wine sauce great   Cooked perfectly well   considered ordering another order side dish good   rigatoni far other spectrum al dente me   way much bite   sauce didn't flavors expected menu description pancetta white onion tomatoes pecorino romano   tasted basic tomato sauce didn't any taste pancetta   pasta cooked maybe minute longer would much better but wouldn't again   For entree ordered veal parm   But group big sharing dishes also tried Uncle Vincent's lemon chicken chicken dish peppers sausage pasta special evening which lobster shrimp fra diavolo sauce   also order meatballs share   many Yelpers note meatballs massive softball size   2 them plenty group 4 each probably nearly half pound meatball eat   The entrees order preference veal parm chicken sausage peppers Uncle Vincent's seafood pasta   veal chop huge thin breaded well   really don't need knife cut fork least half time   covered marinara cheese   certainly isn't re inventing wheel but fantastic version classic dish   table loved it   The chicken peppers good both being cooked well   But star sausage   Some best Italian sausage remember having wasn't overcooked retained some juiciness   see why Uncle Vincent's popular   chicken prepared very well juicy   just huge lemon chicken guy dish lost me   But glad try Rao's more famous which saying something dishes   The fra diavolo miss   no heat all   watery tomato sauce seafood   would way better off just using house marinara   Very disappointing   guy ordered picked all seafood then supplemented dinner stuff plates     The meatballs earned reputation   tender moist very flavorful   Just incredible   Nothing more needs said hasn't said decades things   Just order them when even if just couple bites   Like said service spotty   point counted during hour saw somm more saw server   restaurant busy but am guessing place Rao's always busy   being said most part food very good would eat again  <EOR> My partner ate Rao's along three others few nights ago   am native New Yorker but never eaten Rao's here   Clearly big difference between two all good thing    table placed order baked clams fried mozzarella meatballs bruschetta appetizers partner split Veal Parmagiana Penne la Vodka main courses   instantly worried speed which appetizers arrived   Food matter few minutes  Baked clams take while bake when properly prepared arrive table piping hot   Sure enough clams barely warm intensely fishy   returned dish kitchen immediately baked clams inedible clearly made hours advance reheated something   remaining appetizers unremarkable just bad   When Veal Parm Penne la Vodka arrived holding hope situation would improve   didn't   veal nicely presented but tomato sauce most mundane boring sauce ever penne completely unremarkable even if best dish evening   just plain bad worth price   Finally other couple joined ordered profiteroles dessert    highlight meal but enough save sinking ship capsizing   plenty good Italian restaurants Las Vegas especially off strip    would recommend try those first   food Rao's mediocre  best worth prices charged   Avoid  <EOR> We did lunch Friday   didn't wait staff very attentive   food freshly prepared very flavorful   portions huge service great   Meatball Calzone which looked battleship plate   sauce spicy filling just right   wife penne marinara meatball side   meatballs size baseballs literally   closed meal sharing ricotta cheesecake fresh strawberries   cheesecake light sweet strawberries really highlighted dish  <EOR> Service little slow   When asked separate checks instead just saying yes no he said yes but explained painful steps he take accomplish it   Did take drink order non alcoholic drinks   persons medium rare filet came well done   Second time rare  May even filet   chicken dry chicken sausage pepper dish   Waiter became super friendly tip time   On plus meatballs EXCELLENT! <EOR> We going iconic Italian eatery years favorite places  However recent passing patriarch Restaurant Frank Pellegrino food service attention detail thing past   During recent visit ordered Bloody Mary bar while waiting 4 table made 6 5 oz mix ice! home made zero accoutrements I E  salted glass celery olives  $15 pop WTF?  At dinner ordered meatballs appetizer once signature dish disaster  meatballs burnt didn't flavor accustomed to  really shocking tomato sauce dark burgundy tasted made days if weeks advance  WTF x2! Having enough Bloody Mary switched bottled beer  Imagine chagrin when showed already poured  Even low brow  eatery pours your beer front patron  WTFx3! I sent back kindly requested bring new bottle cold glass try again   For main course guest ordered pasta which virtually uneatable due heretofore mentioned tainted tomato sauce  main course veal chop hot cherry peppers my former favorite which way off mark  veal which past robust serving tiny unsatisfactory  WTF x 4! During visit also noticed tables bused over 20 minutes  Something remiss RAOS   RIP Frankie if RAOS doesn't act together joining sooner later <EOR> Extremely expensive pasta   Apparently Rao's know baseball size meatballs   ok  Ours soft chewy  expected  flavor but unappealing due soft texture  veal Parmesan vodka pasta sundries tomato pasta veal scallopini  Large portions  But massive salty   still drinking water 2 days later   Service professional good  Wine list small reasonable   5 6x markup  Try other locations if can  <EOR> Let's start good  Service excellent  Wait staff very attentive prompt courteous    all say positive   The food only just barely average   Meatballs terrible   Chicken parm ok but nothing rave about   Portions small   The prices ridiculously high even Vegas standards   Definitely won't back  Oh when came time check refused split person  Only would split equally 2 4 ways  <EOR> Great food!  lemon chicken wasn't amazing but very good   meatballs pasta outstanding!  Recommended anyone wants try food but can't reservations original NYC    also very accommodating allowed order half order pasta even though menu   size portions very large definitely want come hungry   Prepare take home leftovers well  <EOR> Had enjoyable meal celebrate daughter's college graduation  meal late coming table but dishes delicious  <EOR> We tried place because figured easier table back NY   meatballs good par other restaurants NY   also osso buco shrimp scampi linguine vongole white fritto misto baked clams veal piccata gamroni umido steak   Everything good but great   Service professional rushed   prices reasonable Caesars location   guess try East Harlem restaurant day see all fuss New York about  <EOR> Pros very fancy great atmosphere great customer service   Cons food price   Experience The food really let down  came friends 21st birthday when menu nothing made think going elevated food because all looked food cook home  But course try right  If wasn't great customer service place would star  overpriced because hotel  it   Conclusion You'll spend lot money no reason forget came here <EOR> A taste old country yep New York City circa 1890   ultimate expression many come know Italian rather I talian emphasis meaning no disrespect food US   origins Naples but long since corrupted American taste bounty   Italian spirit passion sharing good food lives on   Rao's fun place mangia!

Veal your thing?   same sauce tops tender grilled shell steak Steak Pizzaiola thick juicy double cut pork chop   Ossobuco delicious   Well braised tender without being stringy   good portion bone marrow nice touch   Finally Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken charbroiled marinated lemon olive oil mixture finished same   Tart sweet bitter classic   Portions large     Very good wine list focusing Italy   Typical high Vegas resort pricing   Service very friendly efficient   Exactly would expect I talian restaurant NYC   Well done  <EOR> I larger dinner planned group horrible especially price  First told would seated 15 mins later weren't reservation  server Nick horrible  Less attentive never checked end when still drinking dropped off check prepaid left  find another waiter drinks   guess no effort when automatically 18%? food subpar  $85 person portions tiny  calamari salad fine  pasta bland noodles undercooked  entrees tiny share much flavor  meatballs average lemon chicken no flavor veal eh  desserts ok but again nothing special  service food won't ever return again especially larger event preset menu   way overpriced quality  <EOR> Way over priced average food  Good service  Think Olive garden but triple price  Las Vegas forcing people off strip good food decent price  Sad didn't use this  <EOR> Really enjoyed place! Saw food network decided try  Really good meatballs! Steak fantastic! Definitely worth checking out <EOR> Extremely overpriced mediocre Italian food no atmosphere any kind other strip mall kind but service least fast don't suffer long   Best thing said close exits Caesar's     quickly  <EOR> I'm surprised negativity some reviews below   common theme reviews restaurant crazy expensive   Hello  welcome Vegas!  Even frickin' Starbucks marked prices Vegas   Doesn't tell anyone beside anything?  Okay once 'get' things pricier Vegas does Rao's do?  Firstly don't know NYC location   Never heard 'chain' until stumbed upon Vegas location   made experience special    initially sat inner room dark booths  vintage flavored Eyetalian restaurant   If sat more outside cafe area convinced wouldn't enjoyed much   Next only waiter ever asked name requested returns trips   Yup  won't eat place unless inside being served dude   Really nice guy   Won't give name may jam little secret hideaway   Next bread drop table   Hello   God niece's jaw dropped rock when hit table   She's carb addict instant heaven   heaven watching heaven   So then order   doesn't matter exactly ordered because everything essentially same quality somewhere between B+ A    A+ they'd serve uniquely distinctive dishes bigger portions   But don't because they're taking french bistro 'less more' thing instead old school 'giant portions mediocrity'    clam pasta good but amazing   manicotti solid but stunning   gnocchi definitely tasty but ambrosia   Understand tried Onda Italian restaurant inside Mirage   Similar prices   Food between B B+   But windowless big room prohibitively claustrophobic  why sit unless hurry? Service okay but enthusiastic Caesar's   CPK inside Mirage probably offers best value all three places but you're sitting casino all thick cheesy cigarette smoke     So terrible Rao's again?   much   claimed gnocchi made fresh but buying that   clams tiny pasta but voluminous sauce subtle spicy   If manager place I'd menu much smaller but everything simply amazing   I'd use Tao restaurant guide     But told Tao owners opened Italian joint Palazzo called Lavo   Guess what?  No ahead guess    right  Yelpers say only so so way over priced   it?  it?  Good   Enjoy   UPDATE Shrimp Scampi here   simply sinful ball pasta four BIG shrimp top   only new favorite but Sea Bass TAO probably favorite dishes Vegas so far   <EOR> Ordered famous lemon chicken dish which really just half chicken la carte which maybe should noticed when ordered but oh well   tacked beet salad which good   friend didn't particularly care veal he got   The good thing allow order salads pastas sides upon request   Not sure why place popular NY  <EOR> I cook raos spaghetti sauce continue but food forgettable  service slow waited 20 minutes between appetizers main course  restaurant busy but las vegas restaurant should know clean table leave 20 minutes between apps main course desert  all good restaurants vegas easily find better meal raos <EOR> As recommended meatballs lemon chicken incredible   spaghetti fantastic well   ambiance warm welcoming perfect balance class comfort   reason review isn't getting 5 stars because waiter really bad   wait 10 minutes asked if wanted another glass red wine even though refill clearly needed time meal arrived unacceptable least unacceptable anywhere price glass wine same price wine bottle store     Also no butter vinegar served bread start meal only olive oil   While some unique bread serve cold bread without butter cheapens meal   Even asking twice butter arrived busser right before he cleared starters    the food however fantastic    We'll back food   and hope different server  <EOR> My buddy Mark Olson Findley Kia suggested try joint  Considering he recommended place outstanding food he wanted bragging rights   One first things gauge decent Italian restaurant sauce    gravy  Second meatballs  ordered meatballs appetizer  quickly served two decently sized meatballs covered marinara  If creamy meatballs probably best you've had  assorted breads including olive loaf perfect scooping some sauce   For entree decided put them ultimate test    Ossobucco  delivered  First off love chose saffron risotto instead pasta  Perfectly creamy mild saffron flavor b e a utifully done  veal perfectly braised fork tender topped marinara  far best Italian food all year  only thing lacking service  drink sat empty over 30 minutes even when he came ask dessert bring attention  Drinks must never run dry  desert there  <EOR> Disappointing   Famous Italian New York Vegas but food gone downhill  first time last year loved atmosphere food really good  Just back really disappointing  Italian American really appreciate home style Italian cooking  also taste lot different things ordered lot food try   baked clams charred top clams over cooked  even hint fishiness never want taste smell  ordered Gnocchi  special menu  Gnocchi should melt your mouth rubbery  lemon chicken speciality house dry   1 sub par dish bad night  3 restaurant past its prime  hoping annual pilgrimage Rao's but unfortunately back  <EOR> I never New York but Vegas location didn't disappoint   Delicious Italian cuisine good service amazing deserts great wine selections   Meatballs die for  <EOR> Rao's Las Vegas home style Italian American eatery feels you've stepped back time walls covered framed items year round Christmas decorations   menu designed group eat family style   For First Course Fritto Misto which pile battered deep fried shredded zucchini calamari few pieces shrimp cod served marinara tarter sauces   large appetizer which could easily shared between 5 6 people but nothing special   bit greasy bit bland didn't want any more few bites   For Second Course Penne Vodka   penne pretty al dente probably least cooked could eat pasta without complaining still raw   pink prosciutto tomato cream sauce tasty   Portion wise could easily split 3 4 first entree   For Third Course Ossobuco huge veal shank saffron risotto   veal wasn't tender would hoped didn't fall off bone wasn't deep rich flavor   couldn't taste saffron risotto wet texture veal jus poured over it   second entree could shared 3 4   Side ordered Rao's Meatball which tender moist but bit bland big enough 4 share   We skipped Fourth Course dessert because full three lack luster courses under belts decided done   For 2 people without drinks meal $158 00 leftovers took home could easily fed 2 more   price definitely better eats Vegas   If want try Rao's come group help eat volume food spread cost  <EOR> The meatballs great salmon risotto special   friends ordered fillet 2 them $96!!

<EOR> I Vegas very old friend mine grew NY    She less adventurous when comes food Italian seemed safe bet dinner two us   For some reason find difficult find baked clams LA favorite mine growing NY friend decided split order   came piping hot breading plentiful perfectly seasoned ratio breading clam spot on   squirt lemon heaven   We didn't want stuff ourselves before going night wanted something simple ordered spaghetti marinara something would normally NEVER order out side meatballs split friend glass wine wash all down   The pasta cooked perfectly sauce well balanced sweet just little tangy meatballs everything everyone them be   just dense enough crumble when cut into your fork tender enough still practically melt your mouth   Truly divine     The portions HUGE   half pasta half meatball left over end meal   good thing though because charge might LIVID if wasn't MORE stuffed   waiter convinced take food back hotel even though didnt microwave admit long drunk night tasted just good cold did when hot least felt moneys worth didn't eat McDonalds 3am   least night  <EOR> Very good food service!

Don't miss great Italian restaurant  <EOR> Never disappoints  coming 10 years never bad meal  Excellent wine list Service food  Reservations open table  Easy seating large parties loud other restaurants proper business meeting  half orders pasta portions huge meatballs  <EOR> Holy crap $44 chicken parmesan! Four meals salad glass wine $270 sure that  Food ok but nothing great  special chicken parmesan guess should asked price when waiter said specials  Won't back price unless flavor better <EOR> Dinner Rao's last night amazing   crazy thing saw owner Frank Pellegrino Jr standing wall sipping some coffee walked over struck conversation him   told I'd seen tv few times   Frankie total class act   Extremely approachable grateful   He thanked coming over talk asked where party sitting   He then added 'I'd buy all round '  He bought bottle wine!

But 5 shrimps spinach 38$ seems little high  Everyone really enjoyed fresh delicious food just seemed little pricey  AMAZING service though! John outstanding waiter really appreciate good service  Overall would definitely recommend! <EOR> Average best  Service good but NYer clams linguine all garlic nothing else  Hubby pasta Marinara Meatballs  Meatball tasty tender but marinara flavorless  <EOR> Food good no complaints     But can't help but feel Rao's upscale Old Spaghetti Factory  Rao's stereotypical Americanized Italian restaurant above average quality higher end pricing   Italian restaurant menus typically stay consistent Rao's stays within typical trattoria mold  Nothing exciting    just classics    In end I'd much rather Scarpetta @ Cosmo Otto B B @ Venetian Fiamma @ MGM  <EOR> Loved food average service extremely noisy    We chose Rao's pre show dinner Caesars  original restaurant New York only 12 tables recreation room Caesar's location which asked seated in  arrived just 5 00 seated New York room     Our server right over introduce herself take drink orders  ordered some wine looked over menu  offer all Italian classics plus some own recipes Uncle Vincents lemon chicken  started off famous meatballs split caesar salad  chose veal parm lamb chops entrees which server said favorite dishes    The wine bread came quickly meatballs shortly after  meatballs excellent!
