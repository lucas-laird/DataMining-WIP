So ironic McD trying shore balance sheets trying serve revised menu featuring sandwiches using higher quality ingredients higher profit margins installing ordering kiosks updating looks new stores   Anyway McD location sharing building gas station convenience store many cosmetic upgrades even features fairly large aquarium few varieties common salt water fish dine in customers enjoy viewing during meals  F N C Y!  But most recent only visit inside location just redeem BYGO Caramel Macchiato Iced which kiosk no problem accepting  payment via credit card accepted right kiosk well  interaction any staff kept minimum when order finally ready picked up   It would higher rated review but two large Iced Nonfat Caramel Macchiato order emphasis ICE gone while started drink waiting safe opportunity left turn parking lot  probably started 70 80% ice rather disappointing  guess next time if next time location seeing other reviewers similar experiences ask if light ice accommodated    Taste wise decent but really loving It being lackluster price value ration   But least Buy mobile McD app promo redeemed   Wait time longer expected probably because drive thru popular  But check monitor see if your order number Progress Ready pick least keep yourself loop status your order   P S  Rod bumped review queue your prediction come true  Haha  <EOR>
