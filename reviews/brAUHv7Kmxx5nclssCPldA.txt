I've several times really enjoy food although little pricey   Be careful when ordering Specials Market Price items   misquoted price whole steamed fish stuck paying extra $18!  owner refused adjust price all despite waiter admitting he told wrong price  <EOR> Beef rib signature dish yummy  juicy tender some sweet source top  really your mouth sings well $26 piece better good Also noddles broth  owner said use lots cow bones broth made special  No wonder won't feel thirsty having bowl noddles  gave 4 starts because many choices menu dumplings just ok  <EOR> Nice new restaurant! came accidently but food pretty good  Worth try?And price reasonable affordable  <EOR> Rating total experience   Food would rank 4 5   Why downgrade?

Rather opinion its more chinese beef noodle soup fusion japanese ramen but still super tasty  whats unique ramen place soup base beef won't your typical japanese tonkotsu pork ramen here  beef base its greasy heavy pork leave feeling much cleaner   almost drinking chicken soup  Aside beef stock base also comes 3 different flavors original miso lemon pepper  able try both original miso  favor miso more because broth little more richer original but both quite good  Just other japanese ramen places add ingredients such egg corn broccoli etc  portion size just right comes green onion bean sprouts 5 pieces beef  beef very tender soft much cha shus other places  serve some appetizers some rice dishes but wasn't able try any them   Service good but may because only customers  Hopefully place gains some popularity since feel its very good alternative japanese ramen  <EOR> New management just came month ago really stepped place up!

Niu Gu outlier traditional ramen styles but would closely resemble Tantan men Dandan noodles  broth clear much traditional Chinese Vietnamese noodles cleaner heavy better summertime when you're sick bed don't want eat much   lemon pepper broth sounds strange but its really similar Northern Chinese noodles  bowl brought cart then hand torch used onions give char flavor perhaps  Comes couple pieces charred short rib slices soft little smokey melt your mouth good   The Niu Gu Rib items short ribs lamb require call ahead time seems bit hassle order regular lamb chop believe 15 20 min wait time consider calling ahead if you're quick meal!  Niu Gu different traditional ramen maybe some people would consider fusion new style but much resemblance old school Chinese noodles maybe its really ORIGINAL style  <EOR> If beef ramen place   It tastes really good but wait long time food  <EOR> I would give negative review if could  STAY AWAY restaurant if don't want DISCRIMINATED!!!  Good taste limited selection long wait bad customer experience   This last meal Las Vegas trip  drove all way Bay Area  When heard restaurant owner Shanghai area  really happy hometown near Shanghai cuisine similar  But turned really unpleasant experience   First lack basic ingredients  no beef available no bean sprouts available no Chinese yam available  Somehow managed everything chose unavailable  then ordered lamb which takes 45min cook salted egg yolk napa cabbage beef tongue bowl crab soup   While 3 waiting food cousin felt really hungry suggested should some takeout meat another restaurant before lamb ready  know most restaurants don't allow taking food into restaurant  suggested ask before doing so  restaurant should obey rule  But doesn't hurt ask first  cousin waiter asked politely  waiter said yes  Another said no  Then boss's wife said no  addition she asked China? cousin joyfully said yes   She turned away immediately  cousin came back table realized he's being discriminated pissed off  She discriminating Chinese visitors if she isn't China  need point wrong   Hold on  all know she should discriminating  But should wait till angry  would she say when pointed out? She may apologetic but she may also choose pay attention all  would do? takes forever food come decided talk unpleasant experience try cool it  end cousin decided write comment back receipt  guess he's calm enough talk her  husband volunteered talk her  He's usually very calm polite  talking while husband came back said let's go  did she say?  started very politely  But she said respecting she wouldn't respect us  point nothing else talk about  decision treat customers way  would never come back again  <EOR> Xiao Long Bao best LV  Short ribs Rack lamb die for  Spicy fish Tofu divine  Double chili shrimp exquisite  Ramen soup spectacular  Dry pot dish heavenly     The only reason why Chef Jimmy's establishment does 5 star rating because does serve liquor  <EOR> I usually come restaurent Xiao Long Bao  time really surprised cus new dishes always want but rare find vegas thats chinese style DRY POT  Super delicious  But only give four star tim because service need improve that  <EOR> Great little place! tucked away corner strip mall but actually really good   Food great servers very attentive  Xiao long bao black pepper beef huge soup dish favorites  <EOR> Three dined Sunday evening   ordered Crab soup Lobster salad Spicy chili shrimp Garlic crab Pork dumplings Rack lamb Angus beef short ribs  In addition served small salads  a bean sprout bell pepper pork edamame salad   All items shared three us   Outstanding dishes soup lobster salad short ribs mostly rack lamb   sauce lamb very rich flavorful   beef short ribs tender flavorful also   presentation both dishes nicely done   short ribs  cooked 6 hours using different methods during time  was sliced placed large rib bone   Just tremendous presentation flavor it   The star rack lamb   Tender fatty ribs lamb cooked rare   fat ribs gave them lot flavor when compared lamb sometimes drier because cooked long very lean   excellent   Niu Gu changing being noodle house being restaurant serves upscale Chinese food good price point   addition iPad menu mentioned some reviews also printed menus   if want option noodle soup still there   other items igt good! <EOR> Soup filled dumplings Bao excellent  beef rib very good well  spicy shrimp dish very nice visually taste wise  While many Rave wings group did care them  service  Pricing no bargain  likely return  <EOR> This seriously delicious Chinese restaurant  We range menu  Spicy fish cat fish kung pao chicken vinegar cucumber fried rice tofu spied bit more All very super hungry all food really vanished quick   When happens sign good food table   We order more few also made Togo order  My fav tonight Spicy fillet fish super good spicy lover  chilli hot but more ginger hot   The bad thing spot service single employee full restaurant come employe more people  But most Chinese restaurants don't focus service  Five stars probably best Chinese Las Vegas <EOR> Service improved food always good especially he squid ink fried rice short ribs  <EOR> We ordered chatsu ramen miso soup base  soup delicious   Even thought ordered miso soup base soup salty other ramen places  recommended place  Good service but cash only  <EOR> I may hungry enough eat horse but sure would enjoyed food tonight regardless   With Jennifer L 's months old rave review still lingering back mind finally took opportunity visit Niu Gu Noodle House tonight when appeared near top Yelp bookmarks sorted distance   getting lost asking directions local barber professed love Niu Gu's noodles well found opposite end plaza its current Yelp map spot  Look restaurant southeast corner next Imperial which still called HK Star facade   The restaurant devoid customers except yours truly lady running front house seated booth brought menu iPad  quickly scrolling through options which included fair number traditional beef lamb pork dishes some appetizers including chicken wings apparently would take 20 minutes prepare settled came for miso noodle soup   I can't remember exact name dish but wasn't outright named ramen  Nevertheless did very ramen y feel starting moderately rich mildly spicy miso beef broth very slurpable  thin noodles cooked perhaps touch above al dente but definitely reminiscent ramen diced green onions kikurage  beef very tender flavorful made forget momentarily chashu even thing  bean sprouts nice touch didn't miss lack bamboo egg the latter available additional cost    Despite fairly modest portion lunch worthy easily reasonable deal $9 better noodle soups enjoyed town  Ramen dish enough put Niu Gu map keep open mind try next time want hot bowl goodness  <EOR> Oh hit place off day!
