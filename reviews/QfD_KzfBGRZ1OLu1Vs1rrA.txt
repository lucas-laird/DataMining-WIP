The food very good we chicken picatta penne sausage shrimp scampi    service also very good   best part price!  top shelf martini Belvedere vodka big bottle Pelligrino three entrees mentioned above which came soup salad total bill only  $41! <EOR> I used absolutely love Pasta Palace because endless pasta meal $9 99  Back day could put down 2 whole plates pasta    Unlike most places endless thing Pasta Palace does right pasta high quality extremely tasty    Besides also gave endless salad personal favorite roasted garlic!  I've heard they've stopped doing endless pasta meal which saddens Hopefully bring back!  They plenty other options tried also very good reasonable    would definitely recommend place    Its off strip which part reason why prices more reasonable    understand lots locals eat here  If way it! <EOR> We found Pasta Palace running into while getting Starbucks Palace Station which very budget oriented hotel   Surprisingly Pasta Palace turned into gem food quite good prices downright cheap service good given hotel Palace Station absolute dump   But alas didn't last   while bankrupcy hotel cutting costs everywhere last trip Pasta Palace food quality down big way portions cut considerably prices up   now looks feels fast food Italian which  bad   But if want really inexpensive Italian food quality isn't consideration could decent choice but gem once was  <EOR> Service food very slow  Messed order twice  sons birthday forgot cake  Nobody enjoyed    Overall   sucks! <EOR> While truly 5 star restaurant give 4 stars variety factors Cost Quality Dessert   Overall menu quite un exciting pasta chicken salads your typical Italian faire   cost however many dishes half might pay similar restaurant strip   All you can eat pasta many different styles $7 99   While doesn't show menu advertised throughout casino   Add dark romantic atmosphere appropriate music may nice date except when someone brings little kid lot noise    The quality food quite good though just common Italian restaurant faire   always enjoy meal accessories soup salad bread    fill bread course all you can eat ends being plate the portions quite large plate    Lastly dessert surprise though again Italian restaurant surprising    Usually take son bakery Palace Station let pick something out   However time waitress asked if would dessert asked had   She mentioned Gelato an Italian ice cream type dessert    When asked much she stated $1 99 each flavors Cappucino Pistachio Vanilla Bean name few    expected small small portion but again portion large thoroughly satisified ordered   In summary Pasta Palace Palace Station excellent choice Italian dinner hours 5pm around Midnight    Mondays dinner $19 99 per person local crooner Wes Winters performs classic Vegas style dinner show I but sounds nice time    Since am first review hope others check add input  <EOR> Really impressed food service atmosphere being restaurant inside local casino   Its hidden gem inside rough casino  its quality foodservice comparable Maggianos Olive Garden half price  Definitely coming back!!! <EOR> We only came because $30 worth coupons which didn't want waste  don't remember them but expire   Showed no reservation ended waiting close hour just table free up  Once seated giving menus never checked half hour no drinks something munch on  placing orders waited again time almost hour much just leaving remembered those coupons   service incredibly slow    As food pretty OK portions nice  Prices wasn't bad most dishes around $10 some bit more because seafood   grilled chicken broccoli liked linguini clams disliked shrimp scampi disliked another dish which chef's special  night liked      Appetizers fresh tomato bruschetta $6 99 bit pricey nothing special  4 tiny pieces considering unlimited bread sticks dipping sauce only $3 99  Which server didn't even mention recommend know even mention bread sticks when eating pasta especially olive oil balsamic vinegar table   Most places would complementary    And almost 3 hours beginning end probably could gone upstairs buffet just good pasta made other kinds food half time  <EOR> This very traditional Italian restaurant stuck basics caesar salad spaghetti meatballs   salad very good spaghetti meatballs excellent   dessert cannoli also above average    Prices very reasonable dinner two included dessert both only around $44  I gladly come back again  <EOR> I received bi monthly $10 free dining credit Station Casinos Player's Club decided try place   I walked host stand greeted right away sat only moments later  wouldn't say necessarily place you'd take date something un romantic place but nice quiet   The waitress really nice older woman  She kept trying convince special though firm ordered Rigatoni Bolognese $11    While waited main course bus boy brought basket bread garlic butter  two types bread basket breadsticks find any Station Casino buffets also some regular French Bread  both pretty good   The Rigatoni Bolognese actually pretty good  liked use veal sauce gave great flavor  portion size pretty decent pretty well full end meal    After all said done coupon only owed $1 08  tip still pretty good deal   Overall average Italian food average prices  <EOR> I think place comparable Maggiano's fraction price think baked Penne wonderful try something else next time but place may become regular stop once week  decor very nice such bargin price staff great both times girfriend other group 6  <EOR> I love restaurant  first couple months ago dinner   wasn't expecting much because location but wrong   back three times since then   food delicious   Chef Jeremy Amazing!  loved every dish tried   favorites Shrimp Scampi Chicken Parmesan Insalata Italiana Pepperoni Pizza Caprese Salad   usually never desert dinner but Tiramisu amazing   staff very friendly usually no wait   If love great Italian food must try place regret it! <EOR> For cheap Italian food casino pretty nice looking setting place probably LV   Most dishes under $10 house wine $4 only bargain but ambiance nice food good   only downside walk through Palace Station Casino takes 4 3 star rating  <EOR> every time food pretty darn good   service other hand down right terrible  <EOR> This classic Italian fare prepared wth care   Portions generous prices reasonable service superb   Pizzas looks appealing chicken entrees delicious   Caesar salad served chilled fork minestrone soup teeming vegetables   tiramisu practically melted your mouth   Staff seemed well trained knowledgable attentive but overly so   memorable dining experience  location where expecting mediocrity   wonderful surprise! <EOR> Very reasonably priced Italian food nice environment Even nicer Broiler Steakhouse located also Palace Station    thin crust pizzas mix all different flavors italian sodas actually carbonated water 20 different flavors added it   watermelon best  best pizza artichoke spinach pizza sure them grate fresh parmeson your pizzas  <EOR> Great value!  Loved food   Heads Shoulders above Broiler same hotel   definitely point eating when Vegas next  <EOR> Great value   Always appetizer   calamari meatball sliders excellent under 6 dollars   far lasagna frutti demar  Both which under 10 dollars nice portions also come soup salad both which taste food   Martinis 6 dollars piece nice sized   Dessert little small usually skip it   Sure beats Olive Garden  <EOR> There some good hits misses while trying best Italian area restaurant bargain price wise   Had restaurant com certificate used where require order two entries use it   ordered appetizer caesar chicken let count entree which nice because definitely meant side salad   chicken caesar some best salad chicken ever had   Really excellent   Husband ravioli side sausage only two dollars extra decent    walked only paying $14 two which great   We'd again simply price convenience being Palace Station where occasionally Bonkerz Comedy Club   But there's much better Italian food town actually way eat here  <EOR>
