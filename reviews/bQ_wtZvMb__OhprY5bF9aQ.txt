Interior  Some crispy bits clam some more clam flavored batter I'd say half total order  completely perplexed previous reviewer ordered another clam strips best he'd ever   catfish still silver skin underneath batter tasted pretty muddy  never understood people complaining catfish tasting dirty till now  Brrrr  pieces small pretty thin anyone looking amazing crispy fresh catfish try Cravin' Cajun Jones which still go to   sweet potato fries greasy limp within 5 minutes arrival  ate 3 hush puppies which seemed only rightly flavorful decent part plate    To top all off   ordered fountain drink root beer first thing noticed upon sip strong tap water aftertaste  heck!!!

The crabs very good   bit work goods but worth IMO   tried brains stomach didn't anything me    gave them friend   But did enjoy leg joints claw meat   $3 each solid choice!  Also jumbo shrimp prawns head on very very good!  First all pound seems lot more generous other quick seafood places tried   Obviously should same but maybe because larger more meat shells   seasoning winner here   very very good super salty overly done some places comparison!  try them!    The crab dip crab cakes also good but felt little spendy got   Although good probably put money towards more shrimp blue crabs truthfully   Tip blue crabs cooked order if plan ordering few time plan aren't sitting without between sessions   think took appx 15min between orders plan accordingly!  This regular spot us! <EOR> To start off told didn't any blue crabs due cold weather back east  Bummer but OK happens we'll eat something else although come specifically blue crabs  Then water tasted bad basically undrinkable despite being told triple filtered  Bleh  Then order 4 mini crab cakes extremely small    and deep fried  fault asking if deep fried pan fried which preferred method way most strip restaurants frequent prepare it  since pretty hungry also ordered lobster bisque which came quickly piping hot  first spoonful quite good deep distinct flavor sherry  But end bowl cooling temperature no longer tasty  None fault waiter quite informative point service  friend many times tried number different things menu said she only likes blue crabs  now know call ahead next time just come blue crabs  <EOR> Went place first time seeing all reviews  staff VERY friendly attentive  service alone deservers 5 stars  Crab Cake Sandwich Fries    The Sandwich okay  said 95% crab but some reason didn't taste right  Seemed under seasoned very fishy taste  ate crab cakes many establishments Crab Shack isn't best had  fries little overdone but still good   Overall give place 4 stars  crab cakes weren't bad people really seemed enjoy blue crabs their speciality   probably won't order crab cakes again but worth another visit try actual blue crabs  <EOR> I am 100% qualified write review let start disclaimers am crab picker  am seafood lover  However am married thoughts based partially reaction meal personal meal recitation facts   Facts important especially seafood business where product quality particular importance let's start there  Crab Corner owned two brothers previous restaurant only owned seafood wholesaler specializing primarily in    guessed crabs! supply good deal Spring Mountain Road grocery stores live crabs now running wholesale business location  I'd say product fresh found! carry Maryland crabs when season but when come elsewhere  Right now serving Texas crabs   As crabs sold based number want particular size 1 2 3 1 being biggest crab  bring 'em tray then slide them onto your plastic covered table your crackin' pleasure  Each crab steamed covered J O  Spice which apparently spice Maryland crabs  hub still talking #1 crab ate meal couple days ago  He approved both meat quality value     I crab cake platter crab cake two sides $15 95  think little expensive but course am expert crab pricing! crab cake if appreciate crab more cake think you'll approve definitely strong crab flavor  Although menu said jumbo lump blue crab meat meat wasn't particularly lumpy  Personally think little lumpier crab cake   For sides sampled onion rings sweet potato tots potato salad  Onion rings good but probably hand battered  What's love sweet potato tots? think potato salad real contender! bet based somebody's mama's recipe tasted made love  Lots egg  only thing might add some sweet pickles dash mustard but then again am question Mom?
