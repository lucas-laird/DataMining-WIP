I don't believe Xavier eats raw food even healthy general   If  he did he would understand why people care bodies would lie them it  He told customer he doesn't eat vegetables  why he blends them  healthy person doesn't eat vegetables??!!!!!!!!! would trust smoothies place any way  Probably made Kool Aid canned vegetables something   They also don't food sell there  sure if Chef Sharon anything if she does she doesn't there  Why else chef talking xavier bringing food sell?

Love place although pricey   small container hummus $7 00   But hummus die for!  am happy added sign side building Raw Food Express would never stepped door   gentleman front offered samples galore   basically meal just sampling all food   everything fresh only few things premade pick up   Everyday new selection foods sell DAY   tried chicken salad wraps course real chicken but seriously did taste chicken salad   cheesecake amazing coconut pastry puffs perfection!   Unless want already fridge day order anything off menu   call day two ahead ask them prepare food you    If looking fresh vegan gluten free food great place go   Just remember call before see call order your food week    They also serve large variety coffee smoothies   did try any but if taste anything food then am sure its fantastic! <EOR> Stopped first time great   service friendly informative food delicious   first prices might seem little high amount food salads small side but sense given quality food   TIP If you're new place few extra minutes let them free sample plate   bite everything key having positive first time experience since allows sure food before ordering  <EOR> Stopped Raw Food Express Meet group wrong day thought  wrong day meeting set coming day but wasn't wrong day meet Xavier welcoming spirit   Raw such cool atmosphere ended engaged great conversation very nice young man enjoyed green smoothie took home wonderful Kale salad    My advice would stop purpose try samples enjoy great food wonderful hospitality Xavier  plan coming back Raw more wonderful food well friends family members shared tasty Kale salad with! <EOR> I can't say enough great things place  love Raw food express can't imagine anyone could ever anything bad say place  coming over month now pretty much daily basis  Xavier awesome! very helpful answer any question regarding food ingredients  don't believe anything pricey getting raw organic fresh ingredients yes McDonald's pay 5 dollars Big Mac Fries soda which no nutritional benefit basically putting chemicals toxins your body pay 10 dollars plate natural organic ingredients  Quality does cost more worth if care into your body  far smoothies juices great thing them Xavier blends whole foods vitamix blender rather pulverizing extracting them into juice which keeps them oxidizing quickly  Thus all nutrition fiber retained buy let sit your fridge few days  think definitely need more places Vegas cater Vegan community  <EOR> Discovered little place today loved it! Tasty vegan selection awesome customer service  even sample majority food if aren't quite sure order  <EOR> Loved mock crab cakes came refreshing celery corn salad  crab cakes paired off nicely dill dipping sauce   First timers half off tea smoothies which sweet deal   The place pretty small  When came group 15 people having meeting benefits RAW foods hogging all tables  But no worries! patio tables enjoyed lunch at  I'd definitely come back again  <EOR> Every now then crave something light refreshing decidedly un carnivorous  grown household always Tahini Braggs Amino Acid hand took tabouleh school lunch style eating isn't foreign me  did surprise lack creativity   With raw movement being hugely popular over last couple years came expect now food gotten little more   refined speak little more creative  found Raw Food Express simple straightforward fare    I ordered zucchini wraps which all left cooler day  three thin slices zucchini wrapped around prettily diced medley bell peppers radish cauliflower  came coconut water Braggs Tahini dipping sauce  wraps themselves hard eat falling apart but cool crunchiness welcome braving 105 degree weather outside  sauce unbalanced  slight creaminess thanks Tahini but mostly just tasted Braggs salty  three little wraps paid $10  Color unimpressed   The only truly redeeming factor place Xavier seems though he's no secret  He'll take time explain everything making feel very comfortable  He's fantastic!  Unfortunately overall experience somewhat disappointing those wraps something would thought home hoping someone specializes eating raw vegan everyday would surprised creativity  so  Still wasn't terrible  Maybe try smoothies don't end going across street satiate appetite next time  <EOR> Raw food express definitely place wanna check if you're trying stay healthy  great selection vegetarian food juices quite healthy  neat thing place let sample menu before purchase food  Everything fresh tastes delicious  owners very friendly well chef! hours restaurant weird but if catch them while open stop in! <EOR> I love fact raw food place near where live  staff very friendly helpful other reviews pointed out  would better if open longer wknds  place first only exposure raw food restaurant  food expected  decent  but then again nothing compare far another raw food restaurant  found bit overpriced tho  mean don't cook anything     why pricey??? <EOR> Like another reviewer said found really disappointing don't use organic non GMO products I did see organic lemonade even juices elixirs  used come lot when co workers signed juicing cleanse package offered   This why don't understand prices  If aren't buying organic non GMO why your prices high? could Whole Foods custom juice same price organic non GMO  going into cost vs health debate but bring because also told someone worked organic non GMO weren't essential juice cleanse  Any foremost authorities juicing health tell different Gerson Wahls etc    To add something nice Xavier awesome  He very friendly kind  He let try everything thoroughly explain you  He always welcoming smile great attitude  almost feel bad writing review because want reflect any way    I really really want place  appreciate trying do  Overall prepared foods all cool concepts but really lacked flavor same juices  didn't care them all  WOULD willing pay more organic non GMO  <EOR> Very good vegan food go  eat but space small  more pick food place  food great!!!
