Nothing  Ironic Japanese restaurant would issues honoring promises   The food marginal  Solid C C across board  fish okay mostly bland side though  better most AYCE places but better sushi offerings Smith's  Hawaiian roll bland mushy but okay  Vegas whatever roll also bland mushy but okay  sweet potatoes tempura vegetables awesome but other veggies ranged overcooked mushy having soggy crust much moisture vegetable low frying temperature  eel sauce imbalanced toward vinegar tempura sauce lacking any sort flavor  rice everything fell apart  especially true nigiri which guess good thing because meant could just sashimi  Thankfully didn't argue crumbled piles rice back those plates  rolls barely held together  Other reviews mentioned wonder now called legacy rolls    but legacy rolls seemed more vehicle getting rid large cream cheese delivery didn't order any   The rock shrimp aioli quite good  tried friend's  texture way different expecting but pleasantly reminiscent dim sum a little context long way   Also quite good green tea ice cream  nearly gotten used green tea ice cream  more frozen egg nog green food dye  But strong flavor slight bitterness sweetened matcha apart few icy bits some better green tea ice cream had   Service worth 15% tip  When asked if wanted wasabi ginger friend said yes asked wasabi no ginger  small plate both came nothing else  seemed shocking wanted own wasabi no ginger despite asking it  Very large water glasses meant didn't ask refill tasted neutral  asked lemon water despite being lemon floating bottom rock shrimp aioli came same round ordering never lemon wedge water  Other service just fine friendly attentive but cloying   about would expect town    I feel positive reviews shills people never good sushi really cream cheese sugar sauce no teeth   I'll perfectly happy stick proven favorites Osaka on Sahara Yama Sushi Roku  <EOR> American style sushi food so  wait horrible  Took over hour simple chicken teriyaki meal  restaurant literally 10 other people  just waiting   never return again  <EOR> Worst sushi restaurant far  every fish want  stated salmon when ordered nigiri  Then serve roll person next salmon it  Worst service far  ordered yellowtail waaaalaaa too  almost every fish menu  Place garbage!!!!!

Perhaps off night but won't eat again   Hopefully act together! <EOR> I'm shock reviews just read place   I invited lunch yesterday friend cancel without place Cheyenne thought he talking near 95  Turned awful experience which could contribute much loved lunch today  Cheyenne but 215 far 95    I'll give friend regular he knows waitress very nice accommodating  She brought roll forgot put no cucumber buddy she willing take back but looked good just ate while made another without cucumber   The place clean orders came super fast God Man $15??? wrong  wrong end town but drive back again  most important things sushi fish quality cleanliness close second  Straight A's both me  variety rocks well  Preparation presentation etc    okay Nobu give but also $250 each eat there  Taste wise par Kaizen where bill easily $50 per person   Strangely enough ala carte day before cost much AYCE here  place charges $28 AYCE wouldn't eat again if paid me   So strange such different experiences same places  worth can't place  Enjoy while enough people find price going up  can't buy crap grocery store less $8 roll now   Pfff now talked want back now but still full  <EOR> The service competent  food decent  favorite but bad  Nothing really stood great terrible  Average sushi place <EOR> 14 95 AYCE lunch  Guaranteed return  love banana roll  <EOR> I don't know why came guess just wanted try lured Facebook promo  Bottom line disaster waste time driving here  <EOR> I very pleasantly surprised Tokyo Sushi House  Located strip mall atmosphere bright yet very comfortable clean inviting    Service equally pleasant Steve took very good care especially knowing first visit establishment   Food very decent AYCE disappointed all  combination rolls some tempura all very nicely presented brought more timely fashion  water glass always full wasn't any way pressured anything but take time enjoy meal  Looking forward next visit! <EOR> It's honestly worst sushi spot Vegas  special run isn't worth it  quality fish inedible  excuses being almost half items menu  service even worse  isn't enough wait staff cover restaurant  Even small size restaurant  No should unless no other choice  even blocked facebook page because wrote review am posting here <EOR> Used frequent spot since close home sushi chefs fun very good making rolls  Everyone always made feel welcomed  sad entire employee change when came visit today but kept open mind sat bar usually do  Server kind good water  usual but far usually tasted like  No sauce wrong sauce no garnish rolls made poorly cuts uneven tempura batter way thick rice poorly seasoned  you're new won't know execute rolls properly  However dirty station unappealing come wipe your bottles view  Organize fish display salmon other fish just thrown plastic wrap all messy  vulgar kitchen talk but keep BOH  <EOR> Came horrible experience other location Craig  night day  Way better experience Cheyenne location totally worth driving extra 15 minutes   Great fun atmosphere! Rolls come quickly very tasty  short handed just server hand during Saturday lunch but besides great  Come when opens because 1 00 standing room waiting <EOR> It mystery why guys don't near 5 star rating   avoided them quite some time due yelp rating until co worker told otherwise   fish fresh service fast friendly which absolute most important criteria evaluating ayce sushi joint   then next most important attribute price   offer $15 lunch $20 dinner both ayce   Seriously??  don't know because all competition dips into price range doesn't even come close same level freshness     They nice variety rolls but sashimi included ayce   variety helps because man allergic shellfish shrimp some places offer 85% rolls shrimp main ingredient   added bonus iced green tea which fricking amazeballs but extra $3  included meal price     The sushi chefs super friendly johnny spot whip any custom creation strikes your fancy     They close 9 pm which surprisingly early sushi joint plan little earlier  <EOR> I going over three years price food continues great  service fast selection plenty    All eat under 20$ great selection sake!!

Al Bundy would proud  <EOR> I've few times 3 5 gets rounded up  nice little sushi place Cheyenne 215 bit drive if you're area but worth it  decor fairly plain but always spotless  bars where say sitting bar worth because chefs actually interact joke unlike some places town  give suggestions actually help well rounded experience more fun  fish rice ratio more fair  fish isn't top line but par most AYCE  price also good being under 20 lunch even special where $15 little bit   The only complaint really hold against place service slow  takes forever anything rolls drinks  thought maybe just busy thing but when super dead nothing changed there's that  definitely place returning <EOR> Wanted try new place sushi  Many things ordered never came seems forgot about  Staff nice but great service  <EOR> I won't back restaurant  well over 45 minutes still haven't received order  even busy here! Very very slow moving staff  Unbearably slow am service industry  food definitely worth wait! Much better sushi town  Don't waste your time  <EOR> Like suspected low ratings place due typical bitter locals particular area are    I refer area NW Vegas Cheyenne Strip   Cheyenne Strip starts intersection Cheyenne Durango ends 215  yelpers live area harshest world   If liked restaurant the food good but wasn't favorite ahead give restaurant 1 star  If really liked restaurant top 10 favorite restaurant Vegas give 2 stars  no real structure giving 5 star ratings just randomly give rare 5 star if really good mood   why when click yelp profiles 20 30 1 star ratings three 5 Star ratings  Also check reviews every business located Cheyenne Strip   Every business part Cheyenne average 2 star overall rating  ratings justified? Absolutely not! residents area those certain types customers very difficult impossible satisfy    The Sushi bad all  prices best town  Where else Las Vegas $15 00 AYCE sushi deal? some reason TOKYO SUSHI HOUSE reminded places but without conveyer belt     There two Sushi houses area  first being Sushi Bomb 2nd being TOKYO SUSHI HOUSE  lot people NW area compare place Sushi bomb think  why many reviews critical  actually decided come because Sushi Bomb gets extremely crowded during dinner hours lot yelpers complain wait time seated over gets extremely long some nights  Sure place isn't popular hangout young people pro poker players Sushi Bomb but least half price seated immediately good tasting fish  Today mood maki wanted some good nigri  TSH perfect selection all nigri  everything Albacore Unagi sushi chef sends fast  Also fish TSH good fresh seafood  nothing wrong many NW yelpers claim  Many people try compare freshness Sushi Bomb actually kills some  fish same day serve but  why place over $30 00 per person place only $15 00     If follow reviews already know am very critical uncultured  people live NW Las Vegas  Before came already knew lot bad reviews rude service just cultural ignorance  servers don't much English difficulties understanding someone speaking really fast  she stupid  being rude if she gives incorrect answer your question  BTW service very good  never moment lasted more minute where drink wasn't being refilled    I guess another plus place Sushi Chef very quiet traditional  If mature older family members young children place might best choice  Sushi bomb some chefs young quite popular ladies might hear bragging he banged some chick other night  conclusion TOKYO definitely better atmosphere families young children   Most Sushi houses West Coast originally established Japanese nationals not Japanese Americans quickly sold Korean Americans  don't understand why always this? some kind common investment business men Japan? tried asking Dad lawyer best friends all Japanese American but because all born Hawaii no clue why investors Japan this  Anyone know?  So practically would say good 4 star establishment but give 5 stars just compensate all unjust 1 star ratings <EOR> Very disappointed experience  come often but past 3 4 times slowly gone down hill  past $15 AYCE then bumped $17 now $20 per person  Don't wrong willing pay sushi if worth but friends worth it  sat down ordered drinks quickly placed sushi order many times list order   sushi overall took VERY long time table  When rolls finally did come weren't even given plates soy sauce dishes chopsticks sushi chef dropped off rolls walked away without word  rolls themselves very disappointing  rice tough cooked enough  rolls cut very unevenly know you're thinking taste matters most but just mess plate 1 4 inch pieces 1 inch pieces 1 1 2 pieces  watched cooks he refilled crab meat rolls bare hands scooping touching all crab  saw sushi chefs sushi making gloves touching phone order sheets cash register then back making sushi     Why just drop piece salmon floor why don't ya  waitress nice but maybe having off day?? She very slow track down anytime needed anything more water more rolls etc  other tables untouched someone left dirty dishes just sitting there  saw group people come sit down wait order drinks order drinks wait wait waited some more just left  place gone down hill   Tokyo Sushi please together used love coming here  <EOR> Best all sushi town hands down  High quality food affordable price  always come over over again!
