The house salad fairly big portion especially considering ordered small  I'd say looked double portion size most restaurants when order same thing  personal pizza delicious exactly hoping for  greasy crust managed stay firm cheese didn't slide completely off first bite lol  Also despite saying personal pizza both managed fairly full sharing single pizza  stuffed shells barely touched because salad pizza but piece did eat cooked properly seemingly rarity experiences portion bigger expected    In end quite happy experience ended taking nice amount leftovers home us  If looking inexpensive yet tasty pizza experience wife very much recommend Enzo! <EOR> French Fries Pizza   my daughter loves it kid's dream!!! Margherita alright I'm still looking better know there  used place when La Golosita eat pasta So come back try pasta sometime   When time dessert ordered gelato menu server did tell more flavors bakery part disappointed informed that!!

Everyone arrived party served eating couple already finishing meal getting ready leave   even before ask dinner salad   given poor excuses horrible service wait walked out  <EOR> Pleasant atmosphere staff  bf loves pizza decides try new place instead pizza hut  ordered pepperoni black olive pizza house salad    The house salad came olives tomato cucumber house greens   olives quite salty salad salad itself came ok but seemed if salad sitting little bit before come table   Imagine chewing warm room temperature salad when already 100 degrees las Vegas   pleasant!  The pizza looked amazingly good  Nice size big slices  crust thin yummy  But served same salty olives pizza  Why oh why would put salty salty olives pizza! tasted green salty martini olives  scraped off all olives left side   never heard the end bf  <EOR> I've Enzo's 4 times now each time disappointed  pizza best find Vegas  quality food ingredients comparable NYC where nothing but best   family catered affair swear filet mignon better Beso's where paid $45 00 same cut steak only Enzo's butter! cheese pizza appetizers main courses DESERT unbelievable!

Even bathrooms original beautiful  Oh  yes more thing Jerry Vito best pizza Las Vegas!!! back! <EOR> Upon walking pleasantly surprised nice atmosphere  Staff incredibly friendly welcoming   came $19 99 dinner 2 special includes choice appetizer cheese pizza app platter salad + 2 pastas list  try let fact sat family crying baby in half empty restaurant mind you 1 foot away sway opinions food!   Bread brought table just alright nothing special  each ordered sangria $5 50 found both strawberry variety plain variety scrumptious! appetizer platter tons fried things fried ravioli fried mozz fried zucchini fried chicken  particularly bad particularly good  just alright food continued husband's chicken parm canneloni  type girl gets pretty excited chicken canneloni freaking Macaroni Grill unfortunately wasn't nearly good less cheese less meat less flavorful specific     The dinner took bit longer should 90 minutes especially when itching away said crying baby! I'd back but I'd try pizza next time I'd dine bar holding sangria! away crying babies  <EOR> This good but since first time inadvertently ordered enough food feed family 10 instead just two us   Probably some best pizza since moved but really extremely heavy full grease which typical New York style pizza   If your pizzas light Grimaldi's   Mind quality still very good ingredients tasted high quality   parmesiano reggiano caesar salad   brought tomato dipping sauce came garlic knots tasted made San Marzano tomatoes   We coming regularly take restaurant com certificates lots cheap specials   also two minutes down street house  <EOR> This place Eastern Avenue great   But unfortunately now shuttered closed available lease sign hanging over last visit two weeks ago   Several months ago sign door said restaurant closed remodeling   Apparently now closed good  <EOR>
