Everyone comparing them Capriottis but two different types sandwiches! dont Capritottis all  sandwiches thick cant even put mouth  usually soggy  Firehouse perfect amount meat vegtable  <EOR> Have never bad experience  Always welcoming environment  Service quick friendly  Only down side bit expensive sandwich but nonetheless best hot sub spot Vegas opinion  <EOR> Here's summary long didn't read Bread wheat white both very soft  Meat your typical selections all taste great  Much higher quality competition     Cheese many choices compliment meats rather well  suggest warm sub melty goodness  Show heat meats sous vide style process enhances meats flavor more moist   There's also wide variety hot sauces ranging heat 1 oh god why did that? large fat man great appreciation sandwiches  same way others seek fine wines chocolates search sandwiches    I remember first finding Firehouse over ten years ago floored  seriously ate least once day two weeks straight  probably reason don't stamp cards anymore  no idea Firehouse chain until other stores opened later  typically fan chain restaurants feel stale boring use subpar ingredients     The bread soft fresh flavorful  meats flavorful much higher quality cat food served Subway  cheeses creamy melt perfectly over meats  mayonnaise mustard compliment entire package bring all together  top off your amazing sandwich 30 40 hot sauces put your sandwich    Thank Firehouse making great sandwiches! <EOR> Good quality sandwiches  Tastes better subway other sandwich shops  Friendly fast service   found better sub sandwich Las Vegas  <EOR> Capriottis thousand percent better   It's place bad just Cap's waaaaaay better   I kinda think people just fireman gimmick  People love firemen   they sell anything people buy it!   I Italian no kick  lacking flavor   My husband cheese steak he really liked but he likes anything  cool place great decor but sandwich mecca    This far sandwich since didn't knock socks off probably returning    Like said Cap's better  <EOR> This best sub shops Las Vegas area  only location every time forget ordered last time  first time every time  All subs large all look delicious  Don't forget try some variety hot sauces  can't firehouse without fire!!! <EOR> Struck sandwich craving wanting try new place wandered over sandwich shop catching eye awhile now  sadly really wish hadn't   There two things good place 1 Rat Pack firefighter mural wall  2 selection hot sauces convenient little to go cups   I'm still quite sure service  Everyone sorta zoned just going through motions  No friendliness no excellence quite air annoying please away    But really warrants 1 star food  chili steak cheese sandwich smokehouse beef cheddar brisket   The chili looked good even though came topped strips cheddar cheese rings onions not shredded cheese diced onions but runny bland  almost inedible   The steak cheese sandwich absolutely inedible  essentially version Philly cheesesteak  menu describes sautéed sirloin steak melted provolone sautéed onions bell peppers mayo mustard  only flavor could taste mayo  Overwhelming mayo  wasn't good mayo  no mustard very few onions bell peppers  Barely any cheese  meat completely flavorless  All served some horrible bread   The smokehouse beef cheddar brisket improvement but only achieved barely edible status once dipped hot sauce   meat tender but flavorless  cheese didn't add much overall sandwich  rather soggy    This pretty much wins worst eating experience Vegas  <EOR> By far best sandwich chain come across  location particular 4 5 visits am very pleased only quality food but service well  Always receive friendly greeting soon walk people smiling seem enjoy working there  When order take out food ready 5 mins 10 min  drive when forget call ahead yet wait more 5 10 mins even busy day  When eat notice person come around sure enjoying everything which shock coming chain but great touch shows care  love meatball sandwich New York Steamer both just plain awesome  sandwiches always hooked goods  Good cookies too   don't even mess Subway Capriotti's anymore coming Firehouse Subs  Keep great service! <EOR> DELICIOUS subs made fresh order able customize very friendly helpful staff  <EOR> The subs delicious always except less impressed level customer service  No ever said hello smiled  if hell just didnt care  didnt bit  would rather somewhere crappier food if waitress' cashiers outstanding personalities give amazing service    I wont back one  <EOR> Ok review visit last night 1 21 13 around 8 00PM   second visit visited location when just opened up   don't remember ate time but remember thinking just any other sandwich place Vegas   well would take comment back result visit last night   I recently stopped eating meat   again sure all fellow vegetarians agree difficult find good places veggie friendly   mean don't wrong places TRY but all really just eliminate meat existing sandwiches   Well only option Veggie sandwich   didn't read description thought going typical lettuce tomato cheese sandwich   Well surprise regular sandwich loaded grilled onions grilled green bell peppers grilled mushrooms ofcourse lettuce tomato   happy see made extra effort creating veggie option rather then just removing meat existing sandwich   also liked place over 20 different types hot sauces ranging 1 10 heat   some sort raspberry hot sauce sandwich which made all better!  I definitely come back   Great job guys ! <EOR> Hands down favorite sub place eat at  barbecue brisket sandwich must have  Easily shareable two people lunch drink chips under $10 great value  Food always fresh taste should eat often won't regret it  <EOR> I given free sub because burnt meatball sub  just wanted let them know burnt meatball minute later manager presented free sub  didn't ask but jesture very appreciated  <EOR> Cute inside  italian   it good   but bestest ever  would eat again  <EOR> My husband coming weekly across town over year  obviously really love sandwiches but      the service terrible! both vegetarians ordering huge deal each every time  constantly repeat ourselves over over unfriendly staff regarding order  order same thing every time all different cold no meat more veggies  Apparently if your ordering right off menu everything cool but if want substitutions extras HUGE fiasco which aren't shy showing especially female owner    We aren't expecting perfection parade every time walk but little patience recognition would nice  sandwiches fantastic but all choices available Las Vegas poor economy good customer service must  Remembering your loyal repeat customers making want want should priority  <EOR> Very good subs! twice far great!
