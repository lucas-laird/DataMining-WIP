There's really only square cut dance floor stairs lead always wet   don't personally think should stairs leading off dance floor anyway   Nevermind few flights walk down club restaurant is  music average  really much variety  Just all house music   crowded such tiny space burned smokers' cigarettes more occasion   even smoker   said understand Vegas nightlife seen smaller clubs Lavo but many people rave place think way over hyped  <EOR> Service 2 stars Food 2 stars pasta carbonara seafood pasta bone filet charred octopus tomato salad  others said Lavo basically Olive Garden quality  Octopus filet served almost cold  item memorable meatball appetizer    Meatball 5 star excellent! Better good  took 55 min table before followed cold dinner   Atmosphere 4 star solid setting decor lighting  Lovely   Summary I'd back drinks meatball  Definitely service  don't give shit  Vegas   waiters assume they'll never see again  <EOR> I am leaving 1 star because 0 stars option  Lavo last weekend best friend's bachelorette party Vegas unfortunately Lavo absolute low point whole weekend solely because crappy customer service  table reservation bottle service arrived time somehow messed reservation supposed 1 hosted bottle promised table night although indicated would probably buy second bottle  When demanded credit card said would no hosted bottle start  said only wanted buy bottle then but insisted 2 bottle minimum  extremely common large group girls 2 for 1 bottle service Vegas done many times already BS but didn't want scene stress bachelorette just told them call when table ready meantime handed few free drink tickets trouble geez thanks totally NOT   upstairs order 8 vodka sodas drink tickets hand asked kind vodka shrugged said 'Ketel's fine'  When she brought over 8 drinks hand drink tickets when discovered only gave 6 tickets again thanks hostess even giving drink per person Geez   No big deal pay 2 drinks hand credit card 6 tickets  bartender then proceeds tell tickets only valid well vodka premium vodka  Umm saw them hand knew using them why ask kind vodka want??? asked see tickets kindly showed NOWHERE ticket did say ANYTHING any specific vodka types any order limitations whatsoever  California would breach contract but apparently Vegas where house always wins didn't really matter  asked see manager manager gave same incredible attitude  said nevermind then please 8 well vodkas left Ketels bar  refused new drinks would give back credit card unless paid more $80 all 8 drinks  Ridiculous  same time downstairs called tell table ready fine deal later  downstairs table but now can't give table without credit card hold ahhh!  upstairs being held hostage! hadn't stashed any more cards into little clutch back upstairs reason idiot bartenders probably rudest staff people ever experienced life  just asked bill for 8 drinks which left bar now cleared off technically didn't even merchandise pay for!!! when opened credit card wasn't there  asked them where literally holding away until signed bill!!

Ummm even legal?? Anyways tipped fat *ss zero dollars although keep mind literally paid over $80 8 drinks which ever touched 6 free drink tickets clutch!! she pretty much threw credit card across bar me  really being way calmer more reasonable anyone would because didn't want upset bachelorette feel bad but all decided no way hell giving SH  Y club $2000 bottle service  small crowded loud music just ok best  crowd terrible too  should begging stay haha  frankly old cool anymore I never really thought great begin    So gathered girls called 8 more way all met club Encore XS which amazing!

Play some freakin' music shut up!  Will back  <EOR> LAVO hip course  it's Las Vegas  More attempts something fusion distinguish itself other Las Vegas near indistinguishable  restaurant nightclub  original   Not crazy overpriced attempt service cuisine   Garlic bread marinara garnished table   garlic bread dripping oily mess  marinara well marinara dipping sauce   I ordered lobster asparagus risotto   Lightly battered asparagus asked no pine nuts tons lobster! Searing hot when served disappointed   broccoli bitter but still crisp   The sides all hearty but hardly heart healthy portions   Tasty own right but nothing prepared nor flavored garnished any any way would set apart even middle road local family restaurant   More stylized Vegas fusion   left dinner did visit nightclub  would upset if invited dine again  Less 50% chance would would invite own guests dine LAVO  <EOR> the bf looking something sunday night since free passes lavo saw bunch hot ass women walking towards place went  door guy fabulously nice which rare vegas great time here  started off bunch old school hip hop then moved onto house when felt dancing  perfect  small compared other clubs different experience  already did xs saturday place perfect sunday night  <EOR> Best meal Vegas  Chicken parm spaghetti AMAZING!!!

Ive worked restaurant food business 7 years know importance Host being first person customer encounters beg TROY MORGAN PLEASE consider getting rid re training your front host staff she could more just pretty face!  Moving many other reviews stated restaurant club literally top each other no separating music loud crowd  so if youre looking nice quiet dinner try some where else  Food meh    Ive better italian @ Sinatras Wynn  However some other guest party really enjoyed it  However once again already bad taste mouth first encounter hostess maybe something it  <EOR> I've only eaten dinner gone club if want club review read another review   Dinner perfectly adequate Italian restaurant however nothing special   Price wise would say place rather overpriced don't feel meal worth it   Also waiters kind iffy which felt shame   The portions large but family style large   cousin split two appetizers main plenty full   Decent wine list but would actually expect something better Italian restaurant Strip   Overall perfectly fine but nothing special   I'd say save your money elsewhere  <EOR> Had dinner tonight  Food really good  Marguerita pizza fab Truffle fries SICK! alone worth trip me  impressed Pomegranate Lemonade drink  waiter AWESOME! did feel support staff rushing clear food even tho weren't done yet Would def visit again  <EOR> Don't eat here   very few places eat under no circumstances would ever return tops list   seated party semi circular booth sitting chair edge table   People running whole 2 hours 2 hrs because took over hour half when order placed until food brought out   When finally did bring food dropped meal wait another 15 minutes before could eat   didn't even offer take anything off bill inconvenience   All would least tolerable if food least good but wasn't   ordered veal parmigiana meat thin cheese piled thickly couldn't even taste veal   definitely worst dining experience life   Next time Vegas people wanting Lavo skipping going In n Out Burger  <EOR> They changed menus around week ago tapas traditional sit down steak pasta dinners  lobster pizza really good service really quick  very pricey though  $32 lobster pizza  <EOR> Both restaurant nightclub nice look which good because other scenery little frightening   think door guys forgiving let into club   I'd give three stars if wasn't professional efficient bartenders   Jorge Jessica particular earn extra star rating being nice funny top game  Smart hard working those traits bartender  <EOR> Loved Lavo!  beautifully appointed restaurant relaxing atmosphere   full menu offered food would suit most anyones taste   opted 28 day dry aged bone in rib eye steak which cooked perfection   Many menu items might look relatively expensive but quality food atmosphere them worth every penny  <EOR> I would put places frequent regularly Vegas just Tao   Same creators   Great food great atmosphere great decor say?

Well managed  ravioli themselves just small flat unappetizing made Safeway ravioli look downright decadent  generous pillowy ample filling rather small flat tiny amount strange sour cheese filling  All all beautiful place beautiful staff but food left bad taste mouth literally figuratively  would definitely recommend coming just drinks even happy hour but eat dinner disappointed  <EOR> This place solid 3 5 stars   The club definitely 4 stars  Great music dancing lots energy good looking people top notch celebrities like kim kardashian!!!!   Tip  if little area smaller bar elevators free take over your own little VIP area skip bottle service   The restaurant solid 3 stars  food pretty average italian food but meal free entry into club skip line  service good but waiter just seemed brag all celebrities he's met much those celebrities spend drinks  kind cool hear kim kardashian kid jerry maguire night but hearing on   kind old  fast   <EOR> 0 star venue poorly handling NYE event  Like hundreds people bought advance tickets December 31 2010 priced $150 each  We arrived front venue around 10pm hundreds people waiting  Bouncers only letting bottle service   We decided drink inside casino  When came back Lavo 11pm same mob scene  We withdrew ourselves again another bar cheered midnight then tried again in  third attempt even worse previous 2 attempts  bouncer PR told club reached capacity would let anyone in   LAVO = thieves  <EOR> #food #drinks #fun  home @msfitness69 Night!!!

Please freakin' chef!  linguini literally sat fork PARALLEL plate!  add insult injury whole mess took more two hours some most indifferent service ever princely sum   Maybe Vegas glitterati see something don't starting head pounding noise nausea inducing lack lighting but all other options Las Vegas deserves close IMMEDIATELY  <EOR> I visited LAVO bunch friends final night Vegas  Maybe because just gone Marquee night before but left locale pretty disappointed   LAVO deal where eat dinner restaurant then free admission nightclub evening if open   seemed pretty good deal since few decided jump deal   Dinner 1 5 5  We asked latest possible reservation just head over club right dinner given 10 45pm table  way restaurant hit little traffic cab running late  called restaurant inform them told 15 min grace period there  found hard believe we'd lose table especially since restaurant wasn't exactly packed weeknight    Anyway right nick time seated right away  ordered variety entrees ranging pasta pizza  Average price around $25  waiter informed we'd better chance getting comped club if also ordered cocktails appetizers  Since hostess said all needed entrees declined   The food meh  Some portion sizes downright comical including friend's ravioli which joked waiter must dropped way since only 4 pieces ravioli $24 plate   No really wowed taste fact think happiest ones ordered carne pizza $24   came long bread think loaf French bread opposed circular pizza   bad but definitely worth $24   The ambiance nice waiter friendly enough  paid quickly nightclub   Nightclub 2 5  The hostess informed would wait line again club but separate shorter line dinner guests  She also said could just show receipt free admission into club   We outside waited short line the general admission line 50 people long point   men door decided give hard time because didn't any stamps restaurant which no mentioned   He then asked see dinner receipt said would only good 2 people even though paid over $30 pp dinner night when admission club $20    We didn't want huge deal back restaurant asked hostess stamp wrists then back line  no more issues able inside no cover   Inside club  The club often advertised intimate club  guess  nice way saying small    fairness exactly tiny but having visited Marquee night before place felt watered down smaller version Marquee    Music almost exclusively electro house   dance floor decent but lively other places LV  All all very happening even though place decently packed   Downstairs  The downstairs bar also open some music but very few people down here  made quick escape if needed drink or wanted smoke adjacent outdoor patio section overlooking strip     In end wound leaving hour  decor certainly very nice but give fun place average decor fancy dry place any day     Overall  I definitely would bother eating ever again club itself nothing write home about   Overall 1 5 5 rounded 2 because decor nice   Pros  Very nice Decor Free entry club if entree dinner  Cons  Overpriced entrees Small portions Feels junior sized watered down version Marquee   Protips sure wear collared button down shirt minimum guys  specifically said no polo shirts club although sported blazer polo given any problems sure your hand stamped hostess before leaving dinner going club order free entry  <EOR> If you're Vegas Saturday don't want see sun during day come here! place AMAZING!

I'm giving nightclub star because DJ Reach possibly worst DJ ever!! believe he very easy job considering terrible he is  Just select playlist hit play keep mouth shut  But apparently  just hard something  He would open mouth every 5 seconds shout random words nobody cared for  Yea know single ladies house dancing next them  Stop interrupting music just let music play!  Another thing DJ Reach could transitioning song song  know he does when he wants transition next song? AIR HORNs!!! hell? When he does annoying doesn't any sense  Songs don't match up? Doesn't matter because DJ Reach AIR HORN sound mapped keyboard  YAY! Here's quote Wikipedia Club DJ turntable techniques include beatmatching phrasing slip cueing preserve energy dancefloor  should Wikipedia remove beatmaching phrasing slip cueing replace AIR HORNing    Oh yeah club small amount people stuffed inside   P S  night before pleasure listening DJ Jazzy Jeff over club RAIN Palms  Now  freaking DJ!!

Those usually least $12    I must admit can't recall vibe entirely because all little hazy but club wasn't typical Vegas packed  Likely because Lavo isn't newer hottest clubs mentioned before  But actually think better little less known  DJ played some best top 40 music never repeated once  stayed til end great time  best part Palazzo which walk able Venetian Hotel  where stayed    Give Lavo try! <EOR> The first thing heard Lavo Nightclub small compared other Vegas nightclubs pretty damn small!! When first walk walk over little bridge overlooks bottom floor leads into main dance floor  bar area very tight especially because most people find themselves just standing stay away overcrowded dance floor    The drinks odd    gin tonic tasted rubber jack coke needed heck lot more jack! think reason why didn't enjoy place much thought would because half people terribly uptight   kind reminded LA which big turn off me  Vegas people drunk loosen crying loud!  Besides staff front door really nice  Yea    it  <EOR> Had dinner first night town  hearing MEATBALL note singular plural much around office find all about   Basically huge ball meat bigger baseball made kobe beef  terms meatballs best ever tried  Also seafood mix salad came huge chunks lobster     Then came entrees chicken Marsala sea bass  chicken Marsala left little desired came spinach mushrooms very thin pieces chicken topped very light rendition sauce  sea bass also very very delicious  skin fried perfectly stayed together plate just melted mouth  Comes small side argula salad which pair very well fish   This definitely pricier side  Also take note place bit loud we sat inside but I'd definitely coming back Meatball again  Perhaps try balcony next time which faces T I  pirate syren show   Tip if stop would yourself disservice if did try MEATBALL! <EOR> Get Deep fried oreos here     Definetly best  aumbieance great  Cute girls  great service  Alil pricey meatball  But quality great  come again  club upstairs <EOR> Good place drink   staff little over top sexy    kids but extremely nice    outside seating fun great place start end night   didn't try food but looked good  <EOR> We stopped Lavo drink dinner before checking Vegas nightlife  lounge area nice  Spacious lounge sofas chairs  No problems grabbing nice corner sofa sit drink chat  quickly some drinks made way upstairs club  early no line  However guest list night  talked bouncer guy he told talk host   host nice enough ladies free drink wrist bands comped entry  bar area quite impressive  Circular bar easy wait service  bartenders little picky free drinks ladies but okay  early hardly any wait  admit loved music night  BF bopped around danced bit  Enjoyed time bar club  <EOR> dolla  bills  in  da  air   They take really literal club  No cover charge able bypass long ass line extended cold outside  Free drinks  Grabbed $35 flying dollar bills  Pooled other friends net gain around $50+  Hm sounds good deal  Needless say ELATED! Used taxis tips  WIN  promoter  Yes even groups girls! Much faster less frustrating walk promoter wait mindlessly lines    There lounge restuarant chilling area bathroom bottom floor  climb couple flights stairs loud mean LOUD the volume ears RINGING really could turned down LOT dance floor  lost shoe Cinderella during plight four times  Then pretty  bizarre row sinks? Then comes dance floor    There HUGE crowd because convention earlier day slightly older crowd guess  music pretty good but said way loud  Joined table bigger space dance  bouncers little mean very anal having put shoes  Sigh  really particular having portion VIP section unoccupied people walk? Idks! Obviously never worn heels before  But other very fun time  shots staff making DELICIOUS FRUITY! quite sure much alcohol but girly est most delicious shots ever    My highlight still flying dollar bills  Oh Vegas  funny sometimes  <EOR> I excited come but then disappointed food good  meat sauce sucked did baked clams  restaurant gorgeous service good but food let down  <EOR> This club actually alright think friends better mood would great place party at  just suffered horribly experiences TAO trying salvage night here   The club chic liked decor very much  only complaint would amount stairs climb main club dance floor but wasn't bad  music choices good people much friendlier TAO  all lifted spirits  floor packed but would expect Saturday night?  My gripes club would just space the dance floor club area tiny lack dividers between VIP everyone else  think all clubs should take page PURE section off VIP areas just anyone sit would feel difference ppl pay extra space vs ppl did not  <EOR> Decent meal   Between excellent garlic bread apps ordered kobe rice balls meat balls kind full   able seating outside which nice   Kind pricey but between food service worth it  They also bumpin' dance club inside weren't staying but looked lot fun   fun meant more girls Justin Bieber show  <EOR> It's great atmoshphere ambiance solid service  food ok but more all entire experience  <EOR> Had reservation right in  seated inside even though requested patio seating  sat table 4 right next huge corporate event looked like  ended all servers behinds face them bumping into serve huge party food  fiancé moved where? patio  basically empty more quiet  started off some female server then another server came accused stealing table? ended instead now  other wait staff really nice attentive  fiancé Dominic crispy chicken nothing cripsy merley browned if that  chicken parmigiano tasted great but chicken didn't look cooked  Looked extra white  Next day both woke stomach issues  price Lavo should know chicken  Come on  locals back  would recommend maggiano's instead  always read birthday desserts anniversary desserts put reservation celebrating two anniversaries offered nothing <EOR> Place amazing great food great vibe!!also know know best day time party all winter lavo brunch! vegas must check place out!! <EOR> Restaurant review only    Excellent 5 star restaurant!  First class all way!  Tip Try fried oreo's! YUM!!!! <EOR> Although review completely biased due fact spent time Lavo mid 40 year old uncle place displays typical Vegas fine club lounging experience more upscale environment  line nothing Tao only 5 minute walk away would put money Lavo being just good time Tao I wouldn't know long wait though uncle VIP   I don't ask why   first floor bar swarmed single businessmen women mid 30s  bartenders friendly always offered service SUPER cute  second floor houses dance floor DJ area which only peaked into dancing mood as gin tonics starting hit blackjack tables started call name   seemed good time everyone dressed well which something admire Vegas nightlife scene really values looking good  that  <EOR> Meatballs okay everything else ordered ended being very unimpressive   lobster wouldn't come shell because over steamed  Service very good though  <EOR> Came day lunch high expectations knowing Lavo NYC   But sadly such disappointing experience first all service very poorly handled food bland poorly put together  really need improve chef recommendations pairing techniques food dishes menu  <EOR> If want completely ignored restuarant place you!  8 o'clock reservation finally seated 8 45 which would understandable except 8 open tables when reached dining area   waiter briefly apologetic attentive while searching room continually more important matter evidently   sad thing restaurant is food 4 4 1 2 kobe meatballs fabulous miso seabass amazing drinks well concocted   However took 2 full hours between appetizers entrees dinners guests starting making jokes being held hostage mid dinner   entire career entertaining clients 18+ years never horrified   already spoken management 2 times   busy being beautiful could cared less   started making jokes did best but everyone tired cranky when left idea successful business dinner any account    would never recommend restaurant ever anyone  <EOR> I think always negative attitude Lavo because associated being night club located Vegas casino   Those two factors alone always seem always bring expectation food down   Lavo proved wrong   pleasantly surprised caliber food service recent outing big bachelorette party group   The Food Garlic Bread compliementary super garlicky butter perfectly crispy   Just way it  Meatball choice meatballs thought would few meatballs but HUGE tasty meatball bed fresh greens flavorful garlic crostini  Tuna Tartare refreshing mix chopped tuna avocado   bad   Kobe Stuffed Rice Balls Aracini stuffed kobe beef   Interesting yummy filling   New York Strip Steak ordered medium because sharing family style   Actually cooked perfectly delicious  Rigatoni Sausage Bolognese rigatoni itself al dente   Nothing impressive sauce     Spinach Artichoke Pizza Soggy pizza   Enough said   Crispy Zucchini Deep fried shoestring zucchini   Yum!!  Garlic Mashed Potatoes      garlic?  Service Was all servers handsome male models?  service actually really attentive   Waters filled wine glasses never empty napkins folded whenever off restroom   Conclusion would say restaurant offers nice variety crowd pleasers some nice service eye candy   Overall 3 5 stars because food mix mediocre very good food   Definitely your momma's homemade Italian but good fun night strip view Treasure Island's pirate show's fireworks if you're positioned towards window  <EOR> THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER LVG CLUB EVER HAD   LAVO your food mediocre thank special entry passes your nightclub  Yes your special meatball pretty darn tasty   To honest think thats where problem begins  let people eat special pass club  HOLY MACARONI  your nightclub crowded bad  point body dancing itself because people squeezing left right  Drinks spilled all over floor  Slippery much? club ice skating rink? Dance? dance? hardly move breathe  COME ON! THOSE STAIRS? don't know girls wear least 5 inches high heels? ugh    Oh yeah better music though compare XS  But omg never again nightclub  <EOR> While girls vegas trip ventured dinner  ordered several different plates everyone share  food great decor amazing service good  dinner ventured upstairs club great music  but most everything vegas caters men  Half naked women roman attire hired eye candy men think forgot need some eye candy well  <EOR> We such great time Lavo  Something know only party brunch Saturday! made reservations brunch Sunday thinking attending party brunch  Turns missed but staff Lavo still made sure great time! Gary made sure never low bottomless mimosas he attentive accommodating  Also Kat bar incredibly attentive well  Great service all around  can't wait come back! <EOR> It's beautifully decorated but wait painful even reservation   Never waited less 30 minutes reservation no matter small big groups are   meat ball signature dish shrimp cocktail probably less impressive dish   meat ball flavorful juicy very tender   Most dishes oily side   size dishes huge usually share   Besides wait seated its bad italian restaurant  <EOR> Club   people fab music Top 40 bouncers ok bartender top notch  place little small its more intimate club  crowd however classy unrowdy  dance floor Packed! good way overpacked people appropriately good only fun  bouncers professional big plus  Packed Tuesday night  <EOR> Amazing scallops larger life prawns! recommend sitting outdoors enjoy Vegas hot summer night Treasure Island pirate show  great music lively ambiance you're also greeted comforting scent fresh baked garlic bread marinara dipping sauce  <EOR> I travelled 3000 miles eat Assagio's   oh wait eating Lavo??? food just ok   ordered fettucini alfredo could come any Italian restaurant   sister's pasta overly adante    or more undercooked   service slow inattentive popular restaurant   brought appetizer before giving any plates   even ask plates haha maybe wanted savage style   best part meal complimentary garlic bread   The decor atmosphere very nice   Good business meetings dates friends' outings     The reason extra star because came back nightclub put front line gave complimentary table drinks Way customer feel special!  club area small well dance floor   music wasn't really style playing some random oldies   stairs way poorly lit rather lit all causing sis fall   But second surrounded flashlights 8 gentlemen catering every need plus them noticing!  would come back again club maybe restaurant  <EOR> Every single item table divine  Starting bread yum! Caesar salads   recommend sharing someone huge   chicken parm also huge but delicious  chicken Marsala tasty lobster Mac cheese  Most meals huge  sea bass standard size also very good  said everything outstanding would just ask waiter big meal because may want split it  cocktails creative fun! <EOR> I only know restaurant frankly all need know    I ate off special restaurant week menu which thankfully everything wanted try it  But before into ordered food discuss garlic bread  If told crack you'd understand still eat it  best garlic bread world    For app calamari which excellent  Entree chicken parm only 10% smaller plate  shocked when didn't come side spaghetti but honestly would've gone waste  emperor chicken parm   And lastly but honestly should probably eat first because good Oreo zeppole  Dip shake eat whole take small bites whatever need eat little piece heaven   Whenever town again guaranteeing another trip  <EOR> I really Lavo as nightclub ! yet meal though review nightclub only  Space wise pretty cramped because bit smaller side but nowhere near uncomfortably packed Tao  Dance floor pretty tiny but honestly didn't notice until place mostly cleared good look around  play hip hop lot old songs but old way oh man haven't heard song while but  still awesome which think nice change pace all clubs play almost exclusively house music   Lavo probably 3 5 book though admit part reason because open bar courtesy wonderful promoter also guys free! There's main bar area but all drinks side bar which super crowded only bartender working there  But he really adorable sweet bartender no complaints   tl dr Everyone group fairly fun time  Would definitely come back  especially if we're staying Venetian Palazzo! <EOR> My favorite restaurant LV truly intimate dining experience  am Sicilian traveled Italy still best Italian food tasted! Great hours spot well  <EOR> Great food! nice refuge normal Vegas craziness  Try wagyu beef meatballs pasta  incredibly good  Also if you're Campari fan good negroni  <EOR> The place really nice  DJ great ambience  Although sat right away    put corner next lot traffic coming through bothered quite bit  Since very crowded bumped couple times complained but ignored few times until table next also complained  finally moved towards center restaurant gave table next complimentary desserts    Other food pretty good I'd give place second shot  Hopefully just bad experience  <EOR> Beautiful place very classic perfect professional service    The food super fresh tasty enjoyed every single dish    The desserts less good over compare other places eating   But am deff recommend eat love ! <EOR> Restaurant incredible   Meatballs amazing service great   Funny enough music going dining room better club later night!

Underwhelming   say very least   ordered gnocchi warned prior made semolina should expect denser may accustomed to  may only interesting thing dish   truffle cream simply adequate rabbit ragu meh whole thing came tepid   seems whomever doing timing back kitchen should waited Chicken Dominic fellow diners ordered nearly done before putting dish window   assessments other people party of 7 mirrored own   Chicken Parmesan 'okay' Chicken Dominic came off 'something could better myself' Chicken Marsala actually deemed 'worse Marsala made home last week'   bright spot group Lobster Scampi Pizza which friend ate delight   Overall can't say worst place ever eaten   But forgettable   little disappointing   Perhaps little more spice little more flavor some better timing kitchen LAVO could elevate itself 4 stars   But just don't see ever legs climb rungs all way top  <EOR> After seeing dead guy front Tao lil fucked all bad vibes freaked headed back room Palazzo  Came across Lavo able bypass line inside      Its nice small club its big decor  mosaic mirrored pieces everywhere catwalk faucets pretty cool    Super crowded  enough beautiful people  sure    And know am probably minority But HATE everyone mixing days progressive house?

My friend felt having Italian while Vegas decided try Lavo   service great but point where kind ridiculous   someone checking almost every 5 minutes during meal felt many interruptions     Our waiter recommended meatball appetizer which turned pretty good   it size softball good enough 4 girls share   flavorful but spectacular   hoping entrees would turn better but things downhill there   seafood Alfredo which shrimps scallops light cream Alfredo sauce   incredibly salty only finished fourth plate   boyfriend ordered Chilean sea bass   fish itself well cooked but lacking flavor   also order roasted potatoes sweet caramelized onions which also salty  <EOR> Yum! came co worker because staying Palazzo he remembered Italian restaurant he loved where the best meatballs made kobe beef  Personally don't think should waste kobe beef meatballs but hey life he wants damn kobe beef meatball  appetizer meatball huge spaghetti meatballs come smaller meatballs  tried piece tasted just regular ole meatball me  Sorry don't know tell haha  I ordered cream pasta zucchini blossoms shaved truffles  good sounds  decor inside beautiful could just sit forever because nice  <EOR> Really good food service! review restaurant only  We rarely venture Cosmo Encore food when Vegas but some friends staying Palazzo around decided give new restaurant try   decided LAVO due its location becuase seemed cool vibe   Half party arrived fairly late but restaurant very polite it   hung bar watched Hawks lose Bruins   bartender nice friendly other patrons bar   didn't check bar much caught game can't really comment portion visit   The remainder party finally arrived seated nice round table middle restaurant   awesome views entire place   including upstairs area which assume used nightclub ???    waiter Scott R  super nice funny   cracking jokes whole night   Our table ordered meatball ricotta calamari mixed salad carbonara 8oz filet 3 peas risotto spaghetti meatballs wild mushrooms 20 layer cake   Everything delicious!  portions huge everyone kind just shared everything     We check husBAND decided pick bill table say thanks friends   am charge payments tips house when looked bill saw $354 20 6 people thinking gotten off cheap that's $59 00 per person drinks coffees espressos etc     great time thought Scott R  awesome   so left appropriate tip   leaving Scott R   came over stopped husBAND told 20% gratuity included $354 20 total he did leave additional tip I apparently missed check   DOH!    husBAND blown away honesty decided leave small portion additional tip intended giving   So   that means check even less thought   great food decent price   in Vegas   what???

However 4 other red options $15    most people order red wine  glass just ask Cabernet seems deceitful   The food    was cold over priced    We grilled octopus appetizer   Lacked flavor  We also sautéed mushrooms   Luke warm best again no flavor   mess mushrooms?!  We also beet salad   ok   We decided since unimpressed apps going order $40 dollar entrees   Server inattentive he realized going order entrees he put check down rushing there    They need work customer service although menu really nice chefs might need something them excited again  <EOR> The service bit slow especially considering 5 30 place wasn't even busy yet but server friendly ambiance great trendy upscale without feeling Vegas cheesy food good   particular friend couldn't say enough good things lobster bisque soup would definitely eat again  <EOR> Lavo nightclub pretty fun came Friday night enjoyed vibe  music wasn't favorite prefer when song actually played longer 25 seconds before moving on  plenty time play song why ruin playing only small portion    We did eat cannot judge food but club nice would come back but first choice  <EOR> Considering am big fan nightclubs bad  downstairs portion very nice  roomy feel cramped most places strip  sit down nice dinner sit bar drink two  way enjoyable experience  food drinks amazing however bit pricey but strip all        The upstairs portion bad  Small dance floor nice bar next it  much room unfortunately once enough people there  Again am fan nightclubs but would assume those would enjoy = <EOR> I came friends Industry Nights Tuesday    My friend put guest list even guys didn't pay cover!

Mac cheese best ever also   Definitely coming back  <EOR> The first time came spaghetti carbonara salty eat and love salt but remember meatballs being ridiculously good  why decided return  meatballs still godly would good meal waitress pissed off    She greeted table asked if would sparkling still water  But Would care some sparkling still water? know optional  more Would sparkling still water? two choices   what kind would like   the fancy kind regular kind? said Uhh   I guess  still water  She brought over bottle water restaurant logo which common complimentary water served upscale restaurants poured couple glasses  didn't think anything until busboy came around little later normal aluminum pitcher asked if wanted refills water  waitress ran over said Noooooooo!!!! wanted still water!!! then interjected said Wait minute   did just pay  water? sorry   I didn't realize being charged still water  Jesus Christ just give free water  Tap water  Whatever fuck call it  pitcher still water ended costing $8 00 waitress didn't seem very remorseful it  Look   I'm Vegas  obviously am prepared pay ridiculous prices drinks  But cool paying tap   oh sorry    still water  fooled fancy bottle Lavo logo it  Come on  same shit  Admit it  didn't deceptive upsell tactics  If more front Slim Shady would left more 15% tip   I probably won't come again  <EOR> we saturday night guestlist but bouncer made wait outside while he approval group   whatever   guess grand opening club jamie foxx k fed mario lopez paris hilton nikki hilton busta rhymes all there   but what? ha  didnt pay which nice  its supposedly restaurant bathouse nightclub   when nightclub   restaurant downstairs   no idea where bathhouse is   way black midget fanning large black lady   bit alarming   place bit small dancefloor surrounded tables then bar surrounded tables too   kind cramped   no idea where hid all celebrities   only saw jamie foxx   tried take picture blacklisted bouncers   everytime near table would tell please step away     another plus   top shelf open bar until 12am! = good times <EOR> For Tuesday night couldn't ask better   If bored Tuesday night HERE   I called put guest list 5 girls but ended going total 4 girls   Because good ratio specially handed wristlets free entry open bar until 12am   noticed special treatment when everyone guest list them   Unfortunately placed slower line though think may because only two friends when approached bouncer   Regardless still free drinks headed dance floor!  Wait time line around 20 30 mins   just long     The ambience club similar Tao but Tao lot more decorative   Walking through line sinks indeed something regular clubs don't have   Being Tuesday night wasn't crowded enough space dance floor move around   Similar Tao don't expecting seats rest your feet but honestly danced two hours straight   needed 7 30 catch ride home would've stayed until least 3 am   Also Tao foam bubbles sprayed onto dace floor   What breaks club music   LAVO nailed this!  Dj scratchy excellent dj playing good mixture songs mostly knew   Apparently according friends switched dj when within first few minutes dance floor but honestly didn't notice   smooth transition same good music playing pretty much made night   The negatives no seats couldn't find bathroom though didn't try very hard begin oh yeah little much fun   couple friends first time clubbing blast   But if choose between Tao Lavo would still choose Tao   flying girl air bubbles girls washing bathtub extra sofas girls just lying in?  Overall though Tuesday night where party is! <EOR> I made reservations expecting great dinner  wasn't terrible but much better Vegas  steaks properly cooked based ordered but somehow both dry  first rare but dry filet mignon ever had  steak serving situation bizarre  steaks came lemon ? entire head roasted garlic ! small dish initially thought would some type Demi glacé wine reduction but turned A1 Heinz 57 !!!!!!!!!!    Yes automatically serve steak big ole helping steak sauce   messed entrees but still ate them because didn't need remade small issue wrong toppings both steaks    Without telling comped two desserts neither which wanted nor did eat aside bite each  fried Oreos were   not good  tiramisu also very odd texture full mini chocolate chips  wouldn't happy paid them  best items evenings drinks which well made well thought roasted beet salad which 100% delivered beets goat cheese  <EOR> We during Las Vegas restaurant week  worst dining experience ever   invisible waitress  Food served cold good   two business tables 20 chopped liver   Gordon Ramsey's Steak House Giadas both excellent far superior Lavo food service  <EOR> LAVO Brunch absolutely INSANE  bachelorette party blast  First off food really good! omelette which awesome  honestly think price worth expensive mixed drinks Vegas  May well your own bottle dance table you're done eating!! crazy music awesome  can't stop talking experience glad did it!! <EOR> This nightclub ONLY    My friend knew promoter all girls able free  Unfortunately promoter said boyfriend would only pay 15 bucks then right when club he told boyfriend actually 30  grrr   I Saturday free drinks ladies until 11 30 D Drinks pretty standard cranberry vodka vodka + redbull but really picky when comes drinks    Everything happened drinking ton kind blur but remember dance floor pretty cramped  almost lost purse because someone rammed into dropped purse floor  friend able retrieve thank goodness    Other limited space really liked club  Music mostly mainstream hip hop stuff which favorite thing dance to  crowd around age early 20s saw some mid late 20s people well  energy crowd really upbeat fun which dancing 100 times better    Unfortunately group kicked early around midnight because friend drunk sat floor    I would totally back club decor space HYPE anything  But just because great place just dance til your feet sore hardly walk back your hotel  <EOR> Four dined last night before show   atmosphere chic inviting    food average but very expensive   ordered Branzino received two small fillets which dry   served small salad which tasty    dining partners ravioli another gluten free pasta dish   She appreciated GF item menu   fourth person ordered flatbread pizza which best meal four us   Very nice crispy crust   wine probably best item menu   Italian red blend delicious    Service average   Friendly but particularly attentive   Las Vegas definitely better choices  <EOR> DO EAT HERE!!!!!!!

tiny dark having weave crowd   never back aside now but Champagne Brunch Saturday   I'm still confused why called Brunch 2PM but whatever Everyone free including dudes if good promoter  Only bottom room open where all tables set up    open bar girls well 2 3PM bartenders stingy ALL   There's indoor dining area bar outdoor patio area   play loud club music windows drawn but there's no dance floor if  you're looking for    Inside seating reserved table service   Outside first come first serve   Nice place chill your Free drank on     Crowd kind bougie looking honest but then again Vegas   nice pit stop before hitting buffet  <EOR> Review only nightclub   I never bigger Dr  Jekyll Mr  Hyde experience there   read reviews said club along Bank Vanity best clubs Sunday night   gotten $50 wristbands gave unlimited access Tao Lavo weekend despite getting free pass Pure Caesar's Palace decided check place instead   10 30 only told club didn't open until 11   time returned hour later place absolutely packed which isn't great thing because unlike many other clubs Vegas quite small   suppose  difference between megaclub Tao Pure Tryst etc  intimate nightclub Lavo and apparently Surrender    Anyway talent absolutely lacking when first entered ones did show let's just say fun   actually bad left around 12 30   course walking through Palazzo doing bit gambling awhile realized 1 30AM Vegas Sunday night decided give Lavo more last try   things would never except Vegas   Completely different experience suddenly became great night or regular night Vegas experience    place still packed but moving around didn't feel difficult anymore   Most snooty girls left or passed bathroom hope    course soon walked All Lights came accompanying light show everything good again   Still can't give place glowing review because before good sucked badly   yes even when good wasn't awesome because some residual lameness before still there   If nothing else Lavo certainly proves more anything town your luck change just quickly  <EOR> wish could give two separate reviews  restaurant nightclub    i'd give restaurant three stars nightclub four stars   Restaurant Review 1  service good staff attractive patrons look sharp    kinda yuppies though  all look came convention looking drink vent work  2  food salty buttery  eat    mean really finish food many but time wasn't able finish food because spaghetti  kobe beef meatballs salty  skin top mouth began peel  bakec chilean seabass good first three bites then    butter clogged breathing  rich also see pool butter plate where your seabass resting  both dishes waste really throwing away food because many starving people world  3  wasn't able try dessert because head over nightclub upstairs     Nightclub Review 1  four stars  staff sharp attractive courteous positive even bouncers genuinely courteous  whoever does hiring training should raise promotion  if clubbing often know rare  staff superb  sound system clean crips    ear shattering  only reason did give place five stars size layout  bit small vegas experience  whoever runs lavo nightclub doing great job  <EOR> Saturday night dinner April 30  reservation place weeks   wait almost 30 minutes table  reservation apparently meant nothing   checked back hostess stand couple times she completely dismissive  rude exactly  Just completely tuned out   manager point gave free round bar which nice gesture but doesn't actually solve problem waiting long table   thanks effort but  just responsive problem  don't want stand bar anymore drinks  We're hungry   The food OK  meatball appetizer awesome  steak average Vegas standards although super expensive  good caesar salad nice flavor but lettuce looked just chopped romaine only step two above Subway lettuce  gnocchi really good  Very mushy unpleasant way   gnocchi put no gnocchi   The pacing meal awful really impacted experience negatively  probably waited hour food ordering  waitress left long periods time think avoid asking food  roving manager asked if everything going well bluntly tell no    Then lo behold food appears almost immediately   knows if hot window what   The atmosphere really upbeat loud fun  dates looked beautiful sexy environment mid 30s crowd  restaurant everything right except being seated and getting food part  <EOR> All really remember LAVO open bar seeing potential future baby daddy here    Open bar ladies just back forth feeding drinks guy friends won't sober party poopers   Spent most time upstairs where dance floor wasn't big but alright size your shimmy on  Music pretty good since kind remember dancing long time lol   bad place stop if you're planning bouncing around few other clubs night but sure if want stay WHOLE night unless spot PFBD potential future baby

Time Drink! If eat Dinner must try World Famous Meatballs! <EOR> Hostess friendly  wait 30 minutes bar even reservation only reason gave table because loosing patience!  During all time 4 tables available main dining room  Unacceptable!  The food good service  But way reservation handled left bad taste  <EOR> This review nightclub    Venue pretty small cramped   I'd say would good place pre party before heading other clubs  open bar 11 12 when went  isn't much space move around people constantly spilling drinks everywhere  Getting point other insanely difficult due small space  tables close together barely even visible crowds  crowd mediocre although guys met more willing buy girls' drinks  Tuesday night found way crowded comfort  Find promoter free  I wouldn't pay here  <EOR> Very cool hip place  food great perfect portions  sure reservations  <EOR> This dinner second night town  26 seated 3 different tables but within close proximity each other    I ordered Grey Goose soda lime  just needed felt great sore throat  brought over homemade garlic bread which pretty tasty    We decided oysters appetizers which also pretty tasty!  We also ordered wedge salad which last nice crisp very tasty!!! could actually share salad   For dinner cousin ordered Chilean sea bass bed heirloom tomatoes vinaigrette  husband pasta scampi which tried thought pretty tasty too   almost forgot ordered side Brussels sprouts pancetta Parmesan cheese   friends also ordered well known meatball  tried small bite say de O licious!!!   Since checked Yelp free dessert fried Oreos ice cream table  never wrong fried anything perfect touch finish off dinner  Since cousins birthday gave very nice dessert house   The service great she no problem splitting checks up  <EOR> Small ish club cramped music just alright  Seemed lot more guys girls me  Drinks watered down free little drink band complaining  lot girls cousin's bachelorette party didn't wait line pay  only strange part many flights stairs then top bathtub side stairway girls bikini's bathing each other umm  strangest decor ever seen but didn't bother but may bother others  Let's face dress hot enough whatever want Vegas Next time going try restaurant walking past diners inside club food looked very tasty  <EOR> Oysters smaller then snails fillet mignon over cooked asked medium rare came more well done   Thursday evening which means place 80% empty service slow accurate  sure if only celebs good treatment but if your just guest hotel doesn't seem matter  Service also great served main before even eating small little oysters! Come on! <EOR> Fabulous Italian brunch experience Strip! Outstanding customer service Pascual C  Ahmed server    indulged Meatball vegan Spaghetti entree   culinary delight!

We arrived mid morning but told party brunch didn't start until 2 p m  Despite being misled phone while making reservation ahead ate  first seated outside enjoy sunshine  balcony just little windy came back inside  when switch Elton Matt server    Elton great friendly server  Matt much  restaurant almost completely empty when ate around 11 a m  which very early Vegas standards   empty half curtained off  friend sat purse down empty chair next table  When she use restroom Matt came over switched chairs  He told rude put purse chair against policy  first seemed he joking ended coming across very rude especially when she returned Matt decided would appropriate lecture common courtesy  immediately requested Elton server again! Fortunately balcony still empty because early able switch servers   After encounter Matt manager Alissa began checking periodically  told happened Matt  While want speak very highly she did come across refusing pick sides  She very defensive Matt claiming he joking because just don't know but also acknowledged hospitality industry attitude unacceptable  Alissa peacemaker appreciated concern though wish she would held firmer ground against rude service   As left did stamps could come back later party brunch if wanted  Since pools just opened weekend before Alissa told would also access Tao Beach Venetian  mentioned Alissa's name bouncer in    Overall good spot brunch great start weekend  dampened just little Matt's rude service  <EOR> Drinks Liquid silk drink basically dirty martini blue cheese olives  favorite drinks HOWEVER poorly made  enough any ingredients except olives  Tasted watered down    Whiskey sour nothing special should invest better drinks   NY drink pretty good  Fresh blackberries whiskey! Mojito did its job better choice    Food Margarita pizza good share between two individuals    Tuna tartare avocado chunks largely cut ripe  sauce bottom some vinegar taste did mesh well any ingredients tuna itself bland  Don't bother ordering this    The sea bass bland but portobello mushrooms accompanied fish delicious    Side mashed potatoes fabulous didn't taste powdered kind  also heavy    The filet mignon medium Bernaise sauce best bunch  Cooked perfectly however outter layer salty    Whoever seasons foods needs figure they're doing lives because they're doing all wrong  <EOR> From time walked service mediocre best   9 30 reservation weren't seated until almost 10 10   asked if wanted sit outside instead waiting high wind advisory effect    waited bar until table ready   checked twice host both times he acted he didn't remember us   host should remember guest when ask multiple times if table ready  Once seated candle table asked member staff light it   Instead just doing he another staff member started arguing right next table would light candle based gets tip table   Appalling! Very petty behavior establishment such Lavo  We told roughly four times garlic bread coming finally tired waiting asked but took almost 25 30 minutes there   bread amazing though   Finally waiter came took order but point already tired poor service   soon food landed table I say landed because person dropped off such rush felt plates just tossed table while walking waitress asked food far   hadn't even grabbed fork yet   food really good though   pasta amazing lobster wife also really good   Service horrible didn't even want dessert though few items did look very appetizing   Very disappointing night amount spent  <EOR> So disappointing!  food average much better Italian little ol' Columbus Ohio     Highlights garlic bread service   order WAY much food server stopped tracks   He saved ton money waste greatly appreciated   Lowlights famous meat ball good but fabulous salmon fishy     With all great restaurants Vegas worth it  <EOR> Lavo place free drinks royal treatment!!

Meatball amazing food always great  BUT tonight waiter DRUGS he asked friend see passport 3 times because he couldn't read passport hopefully just because almost closing time but hes definitely off  Another issue ordered chicken parm was good but when asked passing waiter if chicken parm came pasta he said yes course     think happened when chicken came out? al cart thought  wait extra 10 mins into meal pasta side arrive  biggest problem but restaurant such would think would least know menu MISINFORMATION kind annoying when wait       anyways hope next time better !! <EOR> This place over priced expected its Vegas all food decent   But why 1 star review   I took business client dinner   Things well until paid check   chatting afterwards its business dinner when someone seen until then came asked leave   He claimed cost lot money  But no line door plenty empty tables   You take review worth   But mind unnecessarily poor experience almost reeking arrogance   Be warned! <EOR> Business meeting here  Glad reservation  Packed place  party 5 bill $622! But vendor paid  calamari appetizer baked clams  VERY tasty  Server extremely friendly knowledgable but also great salesman  Lots selling wine glasses where never empty  bosses streaks but only dry salad then scallop appetizer dinner  Amazing scallops!!!! friend Sea bass also great! Strawberry shortcake 'ok' but terimasu wonderful!! If afford I'd back!! <EOR> Been Las Vegas many times but first time Lavo  would highly recommend breakfast macaroni cheese topped fried egg truffle but definitely would've liked little bit more truffle  made own omelette delicious mushrooms great over mozzarella fresh  side potatoes awesome overly fried which made feel lot less guilty  think best part breakfast $30 bottomless Mimosas because you're Vegas why not?! Definitely sit outside nice view strip <EOR> The entire meal salad through entree really bad  Highly disappointing especially price  Far better options Vegas  I'd suggest something Bootleggers Bistro  <EOR> I must say did high expectations LAVO especially since big fan sister club Tao  If even sisters since they're different hotels completely different ambiance    Even all being case LAVO quick bar service isn't more anywhere else  music good blend nothing retro nothing ecletic  <EOR> Got seated outside   was warm side Calamari pretty good   Overall wasn't happy price quality ratio   Maybe hit off night but celebrate    <EOR> We Lavo over Memorial Day weekend better experiences had   sat outside balcony which awesome   waiter outstanding tended every need   downfall evening food poisoning endured while restaurant   ate dinner sitting having some dinner conversation when sick stomach   apologize anyone may sitting near but struck brick upside head   asked if due alcohol drank however first drink only food eat Lavo   Overpriced unless ruining your vacation would avoid place plague! <EOR> My girl arrived Lavo ushered into VIP section some other guests  girls another party seated turned really cool  sat chatted while watching everyone else's moves dance floor    The place little small side nightclub but beautifully decorated  time maybe hour noticed hostess only came once check everything  Overall just good vibe though  <EOR> Lavo new nightclub restaurant located Palazzo creators Tao  opens officially next weekend but appeared some form soft opening weekend    Restaurant trying some sort mediterranean fusion tapas place  All dishes small pricey $7 slider $15ish small tapas sized sih don't offer any entree sized portions  tried kobe burger fries twice baked chicken breaded veal dish  All good standout veal dish  Nothing spectactular  Drinks tasty cost $12 each  Atmosphere seemed trendy but contrived everything vegas! Servers main part dressed crap jeans tennis shoes but perhaps soft opening? ate lounge part cocktail watiresses hot well dressed    Nightclub Even though weren't even open yet officially obviously weren't packed still made through ridiculous fanfare going through 6 bouncer checkpoints into club  guy told You're lucky came now when easy into    once start advertising place going REALLY exclusive! Ok ouch ugly going able once place gets cool    mmmk whatever  Also made bf tuck button down shirt which thought weird    Anyways once into nightclub really didn't feel impressed  think Tryst way better  Although dancefloors seem similar sized Tryst dance all over place   place small cramped outside dance floor think once place fills more dance floor full  rest place all VIP bar area  bar area cramped definitely no room dance if standing anywhere but dance floor  Seemed could annoying   Ok another issue had   theme bathhouse  Kind fun cool theme  HOWEVER sucked decor  all black pretty much  There's bizarre pseudo sexual ugly painting back  There's towel rack handles wall weird pattern  Tao all cool bathtubs everywhere but then build place called freaking bathhouse no such decor   really odd  mean place pretty everything just wasn't blown away  Also there's no outdoor part club part  patio restaurant however no service there! but once into club no stepping outside    Last but least   music  Again Tryst wins out  played lot old songs but fun 70's 80's songs   songs just well old  Nelly's ride Gin Juice Snoop  Just lots songs very tired but classics if sense  play trendy cool music play some Bon Jovi   none cool 10 years ago crap  Tryst nice mix songs moment 80's stuff  DJ needs help    Oh last complaint  line place OUTSIDE  Yes August going wait outside  only waited 5 minutes due aforementioned emptiness but if place ever becomes cool actually gets line would hate waiting outside hour + extreme heat even extreme cold Vegas winter  way waiting outside blows poor planning part  <EOR> Yes!!! love LAVO nightclub Las Vegas!!!! time came when staying Palazzo located just inside hotel casino    which made coming no brainer  Although somewhat smaller club love bouncers promoters here  friendly handle crowds well    My first time coming Lavo great experience  walked greeted hosts also interesting stairway where see over crowd  club just super sexy very young vibe  dress code hot club dancers think also saw Lil Jon?!

DON'T IT  JUST SAY NO! <EOR> I always enjoy Lavo but time very disappointing  seated full hour reservation time! customer guests unhappy  When finally did table Thomas C really turned around us!  He made all better felt he really cared good time   recommendations throughout meal spot even things would tried turned outstanding! Throughout meal Thomas exceeded expectations really salvaged whole experience us!  return again hope he still there  <EOR> Lavo came sunday crowd late 20's up  place pretty small but sunday really crackin  Barely space walk around around dance floor BUT love place  Good crowd people sunday good music  place really topped weekend vegas  heard LAVO Vanity really good places sunday  <EOR> Srsly could've stayed bay area some shit this   why 5 stars? LMFAO performed giving free shots patron through beer bong looked fun but trying catch some sort venereal disease Dj Vice played catdaddy dougie   pretty much sold that  <EOR> I'm sure place usually but when AMAZING   nightclub bit smaller but gets good amount crowded not much can't move but little fun    We passes some promoter free free drinks until midnight yes being group girls Vegas its perks    Then later night Lil' Jon party entourage!!  Yes starstruck   Especially since club somewhat smaller seems partying them   took picture entourage members gave glass free champagne!  AWESOME   He also made rain couple times took dollar fell floor keep memory hahha   Supposedly Nick Carter celebrating birthday but didn't see Most people would upset but considering love most high school can't believe didn't see can't believe friend didn't tell when she talked him!!  All all great time always remembered  <EOR> ***Club Review***  My friends without having pay $20+ cover because town NAB passes free  few good things experience here  DJ music also pretty good  No complaints there  even complaining $8 spent Newcastle   I am however complaining staff attitudes work here  also raising eyebrow staff missing items  Here's down Sunday 4 15 On dancefloor random patron taps friend shoulder ask if he lost cell phone  friend looks phone says then witnesses patron turn phone DJ  Several moments later other friend realizes cell phone missing only find same phone found earlier  Both friends club security info phone given DJ only find club security took hotel security  Hotel security no record it   Tuesday 4 17 While line friends steps away find hotel security hopefully more info missing cell phone  When he returns club bouncer immediately extracts line  understand he only doing job letting people cut  But rather telling back line he flat tells leave  He wasn't gonna let into club! mean friend wasn't even intentionally cheating way in  sure 2 people line behind didn't mind saved friend's spot line but even if did wouldn't try disrespect them  bouncer just wanted throw power trip around tuesday night  some major ass kissing friend's part bouncer finally let back line   On dancefloor another friend realizes clutch purse no longer wrist  panic whole group searching entire club purse  Club security notifies found but when hand over iPhone missing  guys group continued question club security missing iPhone claims haven't found one  But desperation friend says security pay $20 iPhone security's response Wait color did say was? WTF??? Why did security suddenly change story moment friend offered bribe?  I however say random patrons met place extremely cool genuinely concerned all bad stuff kept happening throughout night  even invited hang VIP area table service few different groups  Again understand staff doing best sure tables stay reserved those reserve it  when waitresses told leave tried politely explain people reserved table invited drink them  She responded biggest attitude Don't yell me! Um   hello? wasn't yelling you  just talking loud because we're club if don't talk loud then won't able hear me!  The staff needs over themselves  SMH  <EOR> Surprised open late  Nice know future goo pasta dishes minestrone soup needs more flavor   Outside seating nice  Note sure if put heat lamps soon but night enjoyable if available would recommend  <EOR> Had dinner Monday night party 8  reservations we're promptly seated  server nice but very pushy beginning let's your order way  He very knowledge explained everything but then again fast rehearsed manner almost offensive  Right minute he came table feeling he just wanted order leave  did 3 younger girls in 20's possibly he wrote off low budget table immediately which far reality  all great restaurants Vegas unfortunately wouldn't effort come back here  Also manager constantly walked floor never looked around smiled he walked around he busy bothered look which unfortunate smile your face very long way service industry  food good but overall experience just isn't worth price  <EOR> No cover short line   Good first impression   lounge club upstairs view restaurant while taking short hike up   restaurant beautiful spacious   happened club?!  intimate but little tooooo intimate   tiny!  dance floor size hotel room   The decor nice but wasn't impressed   little person fanning lady top only thing somewhat interesting    wasn't crowded seemed sugar daddy sugar baby haven   Attractive young ladies dancing old rich men staring  <EOR> Lovely Mother's Day brunch! gave purse holder! Delicious eggs Benedict truffle Mac cheese Oreo zeppoles ! <EOR> A Better Experience Vegas love line worked out   stick everyone into line unless bottle service   No pushing need front line in   Didn't need tip anything either     My night Drank 10 shots line 5 minutes waiting in   surprised well did didn't start throwing everywhere   But met some nice people line decided give them some since couldn't finish 1 75 liter bottle myself   took quarter bottle   Then took some mixed rest pomegranate juice left   Just kept sipping ladies front me   Random girls random nights   save over 200 bucks   really surprised bouncers didn't really care while waiting line   really really big plus   saw still let in   Now lets people Wow    might paid but barely spent any money drinks   just made rounds dancing random people    sure started happen but random girls just started pouring shots   Which nice   guess liked costume since Halloween   But yes girl particular just kept poor drinks   guys group weren't dancing pulled guy side Vegas    Just dance won't mind it   think would prefer someone know random guy dance them   guy started dance girl danced back   Yes success!  Then just simply started dancing other girls   sure but thing probably broke ice costume   batman robin outfit Joker Nurse scene outfit on    guys wanted take pictures then happened   Then girls just started dancing   left look friends     didn't find them random girl comes would drink   offered pay but response probably only drink girl buy tonight    Which probably true     took offer she gave number    love Canadians!  friendly     Then dance some more    love dancing!  where stupid asses come in   randomly dancing then started dance Japanese chick     random ass dude comes pushes me   let slide   Then dance girl again he comes no where pushes again!  talk girl it     She told friends tried convince ass    other friends saw came talked said he those rich white boys daddy take care if anything happens   waited outside explanation shove   girl didn't want anything happen   she told friend leave watch me   Which did happen because didn't see anytime that    But just wanted explanation   incident just killed night    being filled alcohol being filled adrenalin!  basically took mood away dance     didn't mind confronting pushes lite shoves shoves causing take few steps back wouldn't fall       angry   wanted confront but security said wasn't good idea since friends calling stupid drunk he would probably something stupid     decided leave   STUPID STUPID PEOPLE!  swear!  People fun stupid people kill mood everyone!  But other those 20 minutes    Everything fantastic! <EOR> I think more Nightclub rather Italian restaurant hmm   Anyways semi small nightclub   No huge majestic staircase no huge long winding corridors just simple layout bar couches lounge chairs surrounding dance floor down few steps   Positives won't lose your friends here!!  With regards open bar drinks believe best could come when requested bartender something fruity strong    don't know but suited its name   Also good pineapple + vodka redbull + vodka yes lot vodka      The restroom attendant very nice   Made small talk she friendly handed towel finished washing hands recognized night on!  Well maintained restroom VERY CLEAN!!!!  Sometimes hard come by   All bartenders nice attentive RUDE  <EOR> Very popular place  food decor great but music such volume I'd dine Tues  when club popular dance club Sat  instead trying dine late Sat  night did  service wonderful quick attentive  Some portions huge too  If order chocolate rolled cake toasted marshmallow sauce big enough feed table 6 8 people! <EOR> Lavo definitely cool place midnight   My pharmacy friends wanted really dance night away receiving free VIP passes earlier day Lavo decided it  Looking into restaurant decor great club inside  Being girls course did even stand line escorted straight free cover free drinks  great that! sinks along stairway really cool well actually running water along them    The music GREAT  bad song all whole night  only gripe SIZE place  dance floor really small    being small asian girls pushed around until made way onto stage   where found other pharm people  crowd itself little strange well   couldn't really determine make mix mid twenties mid thirties mixed into it  Vegas place vacation ing everyone met some conference business    I don't think would ever meet people but if you're looking place dance night away some friends place definitely fun place go! <EOR> This review only nightclub   My friend VIP status able snag some free tickets club  Walking bit confusing   winding stairway takes past bunch sinks running water  seriously thought place people wash hands throw up  But digress  pass weird walkway sinks keep walking stairs before finally club  When arrived place PACKED people  arrived around 10 45pm unsuccessful TAO   TAO even more ridiculously packed LAVO   The music really good  enjoyed music  But pretty much it   drinks approximately $13 each   Good luck getting bar though  bar packed well  waited good 20 30 minutes drinks   The dance floor small  perimeter dance floor surrounded people reserved table service   Unless table no where sit inside Lavo   hour leave because no room dance floor  <EOR> im torn whether give place 3 4 stars    it wasn't expected    thought would bigger but dance area relatively small felt bit claustrophobic     BUT    then downstairs    apparently restaurant closes allowed sit tables just order drinks hookah   yes   hookah expensive no intentions ever hookah ing there    but nice place sit down rest relax    plus made some super stiff drinks     which actually quite reasonably priced!!!  also ventured outside some fresh air patio area provided new view strip   which always plus book   overall wasn't impressed dance area but really did decor downstairs patio area    guess bump LAVO 4 stars    <EOR> This become Vegas tradition friends each every time visit!

It's fancy restaurant   Dishes pricey side if you're game splurge nice dinner Lavo   started off bowl lobster bisque $14 bucks    tasted fantastic starting full before main entree salmon came I think $23    We're also served complimentary garlic bread delicious!  While waited entrees come studying wine menu which great selection wine drinker    think lift lower jaw off table when read bottle French wine priced $9 000   If baller P  Diddy money then maybe I'd order this   meantime enjoyed Effen Black Cherry vodka cocktail thank you   It didn't take long food come when did impressed presentation salmon   share pics grubbed on   felt bad only eating half meal lobster bisque really filled up   Dessert equally tasty   group shared bread pudding vanilla gelato cheesecake ricotta topping   I stuffed but sample some when front face   nice way end meal   Lavo turns into lounge dinner upstairs where club dancing at   If eat dinner manager walks around all tables stamps your left wrist rock star velvet rope opening entrance into club   exit dining area re enter side where club entrance is   probably five steps away but once flash your stamp you're golden club hot minute   big plus considering least 50 people line waiting in   There some girls dance floor behaving themselves night brawl between two petite girls hefty amazon chick pink boa around neck clobbering each other dance floor while before security finally broke up   along two Kim Kardashian looking dancers side bar kept friends entertained short time upstairs   way crowded grown woman stiletto heels mad feet end night   Would back?  Sure if mid 20's down club scene   glad but you'll find downstairs lounging sofa sipping martini enjoying people watching all over place   note girls walking around barefoot your dogs barking kinda icky   saw least twenty girls doing particular evening night coming close   feet hurtin' but sucked kept shoes on   don't know just mention it   lol!  If you're Vegas want check cool metro restaurant lounge club then check Lavo enjoy offer! <EOR> Nice swanky! The food good also  pretty much bar scene but hey Vegas! It's loud probably best place romantic meal business meeting   You fun eat good food drink until black out  Ok maybe  bit extreme but place could you  Oh selection food drinks enormous  find something satisfy you  Don't forget try delicious desserts  Yum! <EOR> Between Lavo Tao dinner club experience think Lavo much better   food good of course also pricy but vegas club while smaller easier around seemed more upscale clientele   wouldn't back just dinner just club but if plan bachelor party needed dinner club combo again would choose Lavo easily   14 dudes great time  <EOR> This club part Lavo! Industry night Tuesdays! wristbands open bar  Really took advantage that! Haha slow first but picked leaving  Smaller other clubs but definitely hella fun   The place Tuesday night  Didn't spend dime = awesome night  <EOR> Came Sunday night because apparently wasn't greatest selection clubs open  disappointed  door management staff superb ladies  bartenders took freakin' forever bar bit messy area  place isn't big but fun  Super crowded weird funky birthday music playing every now then  did love trip down stairs all running water  pretty amazing  Overall good experience enjoyed it  Better music could've played however <EOR> So hit Lavo two weekends row weekend before Xmas New Years Day  seriously NOTHING bad say spot  when its easy girls free guys free if 1 1 ratio long girl gl girls open bar until midnight!

Only confusing part parking  <EOR> Lavo hit or miss terms crowd music but decor absolute favorite  ambiance perfect if sophisticated surroundings  Perfect date evening    I've twice nightclub  definitely intimate upstairs depending night DJ making your night making ask yourself why even bothered  first time came DJ blowing mind second time around can't even remember he played  honest bored wondering where real party at  also thinking where hell did all old people come from  Shame you! don't dare spill your drink drunk ass bitch!  why gotta dance stage table place  <EOR> First time place excellent customer service  Remarkable food  Impeccable atmosphere! 5 stars sure! <EOR> Absolutely fabulous Caesar salad  Sea bass die Scott server fantastic <EOR> Review NIGHTCLUB portion only Located inside Venetian run same people Tao restaurant turns into nightclub venue hours   However bar dance area seem separate main dining area below   bar dance area some stairs cross catwalk bunch running sinks then some more stairs   Odd right?  any case decent venue but fairly modest size   There's fairly large triangular shape bar bunch tables lining wall side those table service   dance floor other side room really packed night along some additional tables around VIP area side   There's also second small bar dance floor but sure if stocked main bar   Maybe because LeBron James house Friday night but place just INSANELY PACKED   peak basically stuck standing same place just crowded around seek shelter somewhere   Fortunately spot right counter bar easy access drinks while stood there   stood   And     stood   no idea if anything else beyond triangle bar dance floor table section since just hard move but didn't seem was   The staff very mixed   bartenders all really nice bought all drinks default really friendly us   She seemed relatively generous pours nice plus   security hostesses other hand few pegs below bartenders   Granted crowded hot kind loud all buzzed people little slow reacting them waving flashlights air people move   But really literally pushing people way largely unnecessary   mean leading LeBron himself table   just jamming way through clear area people still making way upstairs   If wished wasn't crowded I certainly felt way    then maybe shouldn't let many damn people inside!  Although ultimately didn't need them friend chatting cab driver way Lavo he nice enough give some drink coupons discount passes cover   Definitely helps talk your cab driver if though some passes concierge if staying hotel   ladies may want try come early if can   ended making Lavo 10 30 dinner girls scored free drinks until 11 00 believe   Thankfully kind enough pass along some drinks guys well  <EOR> When think LAVO think more classy lounge rather hot poppin' club  said am no means trying say LAVO hot poppin'  run same people runs TAO but feel crowd significantly different  good thing LAVO  same nice decor inside great music minus TAO crowd! definitely refreshing club Vegas room dance move! last time seriously hooked  own table comp bottle vodka  more ask for? <EOR> My group stayed across street TI Lavo first spot land right all dolled up  11 30pm Friday although back house probably pissed off having cook 5 medium rare stakes prepare huge seafood sampler multiple appetizers right before closing did grrreat  tasty cooked to perfection medium rare bad boy grilled asparagus    The chef sent over COMPLIMENTARY 3 tier holder full 9 double patron shots  say pre party? think yes  Especially 3 4 shots vodka prior hotel being within walking distance     We all great buzz when came time head upstairs club portion Lavo  club veryyy packed  music great little two step but just crowded couldn't much else  fact all left soaking wet because bubbles foam little interesting  guess helped hot but definitely left things sticky  much area lounge but pretty wide open space bar generally stays pretty open  You'll most likely able grab seat there    Overall    looking fun place place gave just that! <EOR> Terrible service can't efficiently handle party 11    We reservations 7 30pm night needed leave 8 30pm show   told waitress she said no problem   wife ordered soda waitress never came   put end table right where walkway waitstaff was   Two three them bumped into chair each every time past   scooted far could go   The menu la carte ready Vegas food price gouging!

Well friends LAVO  located beautiful Palazzo Hotel Casino! place first nightclub started night off Halloween Vegas weekend extravaganza    Upon arriving saw line formed inside nightclub another eat restaurant  best friend knew promoter guest list  Walking establishment entered restaurant  restaurant first floor club second floor  guess would ideal combination if dining LAVO then wanted start dancing right off bat  Burn them calories ya'll !  As walked stairs through hallway bit confused why bunch faucets flowing water ice cubes lit up  expected fire something else because LAVO reminded lava but then reminding lava means wash Spanish  lavo means bathe Latin  Therefore concluded made sense faucets haha! D  Supposedly LAVO overlooks Strip where see  best views all Las Vegas  When however place packed music vibe people very happening  more people just standing sitting down  trying look classy getting down dance floor    Overall okay place your pre dancing legs on  Nice decor okay music  If you're lady you'll shot free some free drinks  dance floor small stairs need watch when walking around club  <EOR> Had really good experience Wednesday night both restaurant club    It nice night sat patio which very nice spot   potential crowded quickly   Started off Meatball whipped ricotta  Ive definitely better Kobe meat balls Sorellina Boston   If eat again order meat ball  Chilean Sea Bass very good dish very bright flavors cooked perfectly  server excellent  believe name Arthur    favorite place Vegas but overall good experience    My biggest gripe much hell staff gives going night club you've paid Vegas prices eat there  bouncers worst unnecessarily rude some stupid power trip   Once club found good spot right bar closest dance floor   very small club but playing awesome music  <EOR> Lavo night club didn't really rock world  crowded stuffy but bartenders served table really attentive sweet  Initially didn't serve Tokyo tea but she made happen  Yayy her  Anyhoo packed sardines everyone sweating  Hmm maybe Tao wouldve better  <EOR> Every time come FREE open bar ladies  If you're guys drinks them  if you're girls well   it's time down many drinks haha! There's only bar maybe 4 bartenders gameplan if you're trying drink drink ie  Just stay near bar     I really enjoy music LAVO  Pretty small place gets super crowded quick    I'd definitely recommend coming FREE open bar ladies but probably wouldn't spend your whole night unless came guys pay in  that'd just rude if asked   <EOR> Great Food can't free admission Night Club <EOR> We saw Lavo Food Porn show  showing famous meatball  looked good show next time Las Vegas try it  Oh best meatball ever eaten  1 pound meaty goodness  rest meal also very good but meatball main attraction  Great service big portions  <EOR> We came friend's 30th birthday treated big long table private area restaurant  group ahd 20 people it  menu fairly limited but good selection steaks   I chose 8oz  Filet Mignon decent best  flavor light meat kind dry  treat well though paying ambiance well  would try place again except order something else  <EOR> Very beautiful restaurant super friendly staff! came Sunday brunch ordered eggs benedict oh fabulous felt mouth   very impressed quality food service  must admit some hot waiters there! love when restaurant hires good looking men! <EOR> I came dinner large group 15 wasn't impressed  Disclaimer huge Italian fan hard please genre    The setting amazing very beautiful elegant classy  kind atmosphere love when going nice place Vegas    I love  gnocchi my only Italian love couldn't resist trying mushroom gnocchi dish  love mushrooms too  Unfortunately mushrooms strong overpowering couldn't eat them  disappointed  some appetizers very good     Overall giving them 4 star rating  Probably deserve 3  asked food alone but  fair based just experience  <EOR> For LV night club little small   lost count many times stomped on   good starter club but place spend your entire night  <EOR> Good so so advertised college football place watch games   joke table service many people piled around couldn't even see games   Don't waste your time if want watch sports <EOR> this place tiny dark  came drink check club early saturday night around 11 12   lemon drop ordered good but vodka soda ordered gross  bar lounge downstairs see club upstairs and possibly some girls's skirts!    to club upstairs offer transfer your drink glass firm plastic cup  did flawlessly  schlepped upstairs like three four flights think heels walk around tiny cramped club  dance floor SMALL  each time dj played song getting into he would switch song  song would less minute before he changed it  kinda annoying   the bathroom incredibly dark  couldn't see myself all touch up  ton different soaps  heyyy just now connection i e  lavo means wash spanish  suppose explains running sinks flank hallway way downstairs upstairs     too dark  many stairs  small dance floor  bad drink  bounced 20 mins  am coming back  <EOR> Amazing food ambiance! Italian restaurants always just eh but surpasses all expectations! <EOR> This review Lavo nightclub Sooo basically snuck into Lavo via door closest front desk Palazzo lobby  sure why no bouncer door but wooohoooooo no cover! I'd stopped daytime drinks before previous visits Vegas but past trip 1st time coming indulge its nightlife scene  Bottomline looking loved decor + good time but probably try other nighttime hotspots strip before coming back again  Check photos place!   = Location right side front doors Palazzo across front desk  Easy find + there's no need wind around casino searching it  If you're walking strip there's outer awnings LAVO printed right it    Parking every casino Palazzo own free multi level garage back  entrance Las Vegas Blvd Sands Ave    Venue bit smaller side but very nicely themed dark Mediterranean decor  Downstairs there's full bar w ample seating lounge area couches + cushions  Then upstairs you'll pass some decorative urns well hallway water basins actually running water them  leads even more stairs thank goodness handrails    top which another bar + finally dance floor  bar more comfy seating around wall + far enough away decent conversation away music  dance floor small side + surrounded special reserved tables  bouncers try barricade tables floor using those velvet ropes which only leads people running into them because dance floor packed    very efficient  There's stage back wall floor + slightly tacky disco ball hangs ceiling above it    Cleanliness No problems but then again dark would difficult tell anyways  point night did see employees wiping spilled drink edge dance floor but other take good sign    Crowd weekday only part club packed dance floor where everyone seemed having good time  crowd young + fairly diverse multiple levels  many older creepy people    Music played different music downstairs + upstairs latter which bit much loud side taste  Anytime where kinda difficult conversation friend right next can't good ear drums  your typical top 40's music danceable but memorable being awesome bad    just loud   Bar previously mentioned 2 large bars 1 upstairs + 1 downstairs  wasn't crowded weeknight no problem getting attention bartenders quick + attractive well attentive  During last round drinks asked mine lighter side + bartender complied while saying she added extra into friend's drink fair  Nicely done she good tip    Drinks Vegas course drinks expensive  Everything ordered $10 $15 before tip but drinks stiff + mentioned came quickly     Bathroom sure downstairs but nice bathroom upstairs between walkway dance floor + bar  bouncers stand around + flash flashlights clear area don't fight crowd gotta do   Price Cover weeknight $20 but since snuck paid nada muahaha  If stay Palazzo complimentary entry into Lavo well  also guestlist which free but know promoter friendly bouncer  club open until wee hours around 4am but stop letting people soon midnight  <EOR> We last day restaurant week which $50 each person  4 course meal including dessert thought looked decent booked reservation  walked right people already chowing dinner having drinks bar area   As far decor pretty much usual dark Vegas decor  Since same people started Tao next door Venetian same vibe  cool balcony outdoor area faces Strip view all pyrotechnics TI Sirens show across street   On food  word describe all    heavy  2 words? Very heavy  know Italian food which heavy but Italian food steroids  request restaurant week menu waiter let known food portion sizes would smaller usual  fine us  But every dish arrived huge    just gave normal portions I'd hate imagine even bigger portions looked like!  My wife both shared calamari kobe stuffed rice balls appetizers sea bass seafood penne pasta entrees broccoli rabe haricot vert longer skinnier green beans   Honestly time finished apps just stuffed  calamari decent thickly cut crispy oily  didn't taste much meat inside rice balls perhaps skimped them   The roasted sea bass cooked very well very moist drenched butter  penne seafood alfredo some very good sized shrimp but wasn't much else  Maybe few microscopic sized scallops didn't even see any lobster meat  haricot vert very good well seasoned  broccoli rabe other hand just wasn't used to  Extremely bitter flavor thought would least taste similar Chinese style gai lan  couldn't any more different lesson learned   By time dessert rolled around just unbuckle belts slip sweat pants  brought tiramisu dessert candle Happy Birthday written plate which thought nice touch  Again good dessert but very heavy  top all off also bread pudding dessert take to go  Service very good friendly  wouldn't come back again but good time nonetheless  <EOR> The only meal Vegas worth Yelp'ing home about! Although did write reviews all others     I really enjoyed pasta interesting environment decent service  But most importantly decent meal!! <EOR> This Las Vegas RNR marathon party definitely didn`t disappoint!! Those VIP passes race skipped wait line right in  Three levels Lavo  First being bar cushy seatings small cozy tables packed course  Second level more small tables Lavo Italian restaurant night club   Third level club area packed really small  Kind hard walk through but did blast over all!! kept hearing ragu big balls as meatballs decided next visit try them everyone keeps raving balls!! <EOR> Nightclub rating only     We lucky because happened arrive during Kris Humphries' new husband Kim Kardashian bachelor party   I also saw Jordan Farmar Lamar Odom Scott   Place packed Saturday night didn't want wait line did bottle service  Cost $575 total 5 guys grey goose choose drinks   You don't your own VIP booth actually sit long couch small section along other bottle service people   Overall pretty cool club but think pretty small compared others XS Marquee JET Pure  <EOR> If looking place serves meatballs plays dance music while eat offers spankings LAVO your place!!

Lavo didn't try your meatballs but maybe next time! <EOR> Unfortunately pretty poor experience LAVO despite great interior design funny bathrooms good music above average desserts  think problem place price performance ratio  complimentary garlic bread decent  ordered 2 appetizers calamari eggplant parmegiano  Calamari barely OK but eggplant good  main platter seafood pasta $38 dish super salty acidic due overuse tomatoes  wife ordered fish dishes over which poured balsamic vinegar without double checking wife  She disgusted fish she send back  next fish she salty well but least she thought well cooked  finished dining experience order 2 desserts both above average  Overall pretty average food probably elsewhere 1 3 price much better taste   My biggest problem waitress  she took drink appetizer orders she disappeared 20 mins  When appetizers showed asked another poor fellow whether gonna able order main dishes if princess waitress decides show up  She came over another 5 minutes didn't even apologize pretended nothing happened  wait main dishes another 30 mins  didn't water refreshments think only asked once if need more drinks time  When food came already feeling filled but ate whole thing because very angry and super hard angry    When wife's food turned bad manager came over apologized +1 manager   Overall paid 4 people $350 w o bottle wine anything that  If only paid $150 $200 could still OK but price range expect high quality services delivered  Really disappointed LAVO never coming back never sending any friends there  Sorry Palazzo  <EOR> four words Polenta Fries Tiramisu! <EOR> This review only club   Lavo located inside Palazzo which also connected Venetian Wynn bridge   easy find because right main entrance   kind surprised wasn't line outside but hey complaining   free which awesome especially since some other people said charging $100 per head cover   Anyway walk some stairs you're landing   Then walk some stairs you're hallway   Then more stairs you're another landing woman being fanned little person    Then more flight stairs you're finally inside   first impression club dang small  literally bar area dance floor   bar quick good although drinks ordered which normally shooters came shot glasses   wouldn't minded much except $13 each   Wtf seriously??
