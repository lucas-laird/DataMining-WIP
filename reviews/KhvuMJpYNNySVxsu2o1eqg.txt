That'd great! All shared including rolls sushi    We hadn't seen niece quite some time lot catching all while busboys trying grab unfinished plates platters    uhmmm still working this     there's still some rolls   felt annoyed once again  Sorry wasn't eating fast enough guy! King cleaned grilled excused himself thanked job well done  Finally food cleared off plates taken away anxious bussing staff  All food delicious steak cooked perfection  PERFECT amount food 3 split that    I asked check host asked experience all agreed good  He tried pushing dessert but kindly reject we'd made previous plans hit local smoothie joint  The check left did double take total  Suddenly interested why seemed high just 3 us  Spying itemized bill actually charge SHARING! Uhmmm niece ordered couple rolls sushi totaling cost steak dinner! WTF sharing charge? I didn't bother bringing wifey cuz she probably would've made scene caused herself   I paid check smile vowing warn fellow YELPers  After telling part experience friend fellow YELPer he said ALSO secretly charge SPLIT checks! WTH? So forewarned check check secret charges  Ask dinner sharing charge added if person ALREADY having equal total regular teppanyaki grill dinner   Deductions 1 2 STAR hurried act wanting needing take order quickly  1 2 STAR trying pull unfinished plates while still chewing  1 2 STAR secret charges   May your palate always surprised goodness your glass never empty!

Personally artificial coloring everything am eating  Pink rice Pink shrimp Pink Vegetables    think should ask if you'd 'house sauce everything should optional standard   returning teppayaki anytime soon unless remove mandatory pink sauce rule  <EOR> We came Naked Sushi Event  Definitely seen TV    Thank God Groupon otherwise $45 person   We arrived late pickings slim no pun intended hardly any food left  All managed some fried rice Benihana type chef some leftover spicy tuna roll pieces  did some hot food but buffalo wings sushi well friend  Fail food selection  $45 would expect far better selection food  am bitching much because 1  Groupon 2  came little late     I give owners managers effort trying something exotic  tried create lively atmosphere however felt more visiting house party versus attending event  Epic Fail ambiance    The only thing wonder food service non nekked night?!?   I know don't care find out   <EOR> Reflecting back visit few months ago unbiased neutral mind experience worst life    Went Friday night group 5 seeing advertised special 14 99 all eat sushi    When fairly empty but weren't seated 15 minutes no given reason all  being seated sat another 10 minutes waitress disappeared without any notice even leaving any menus all  When she came back fianlly take drink orders she told tiny piece paper plastic display menu  then foud special 14 99 menu limited 6 7 different items very basic nigiri salmon tuna shrimp few plain unoriginal rolls California phill spicy tuna   No appetizers no included drinks just those  Dissatisfied irritated already asked see regular menu becuase wasn't feeeling any those she snarled said no a y c e  full menu pay full price  didn't ask prices asked menu  farfetched assumption cheap very insulting  shouldve left then but didn't    There selection happy hour cocktails mixed drinks ordered some which never arrived all  Some chose order off regular menu some chose AYCE turned off way things going simply didn't want eat anything    The food came extremely slowly AYCE often all big plate left divide them across table confusion  sushi very very mediocre need say some better prepackaged supermarket brands  Nigiri much rice sushi rice being cold lacking vinegar fish being hardly fresh  rolls bad nor great just   Boring    During entire time party dining didn't recieve polite gesture waitress even bussers   The tipping point whole night end  asking bill which difficult task simply because could barely hold server she delivered vanished once more  Ahh problems arose  grossly overcharged  She charged 6 AYCE's all cocktails ordered full price  When asked she claimed non ayce patrons ate fron ayce's plate  case trust hardly doubt dying sneak bite California roll  She insisted case even started argue  Also when asked drinks she said ordered them happy hour time when reality fact drinks 30 minutes ordered them due entire staffs negligence probably why she thought ordered them late  Also kicker? crazy $5 service charge added every single AYCE dinner patron which brought actual price 19 99 per person  Never life heard hidden fees restaraunt  Cars homes? understand  Dinner? kidding me? Our entire party furious spoke manager explaining entire situation most he did take off all mistakes even still only done because claiming wouldn't pay if corrected    To further rate place rubric based 100 points    Food Speed 30 100 Food Quality 50 100 Service 0 100 Decor 65 100 Price 40 100  Avoid avoid avoid  Service kills know wasn't just bad day just particular waitress because work starbucks same plaza ad see them regularly  Most staff extremely rude snobby  <EOR>
