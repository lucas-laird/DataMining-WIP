Mozzarella sticks literally twice price worth opinion  Whatever deal it  tipsy want food  pay cash but tell keep tab open because going keep ordering eventually pay card  He almost gave offended look when took change as no tip   back order ask if Orchard part happy hour sharp tone he replies never was     um   ok? Whatever took hefe  start walk away he yells don't tab anymore! Ok    asked i d  back  sure why he wouldn't give back begin if case  all top bathroom being mess pee everywhere cigarette ashes all over toilet seat whole thing filled cigarette smoke   While remained calm through everything most certainly won't return location  <EOR> This guy name john super racist over he took ever come he wasnt paying any type attention he avoiding trying conversion people same color things that  when he finaly decided come he ask id which totaly right but he didn't want take any 2 forms id gave him   when any other place take them any problem cuz ids them valid any country <EOR> Bartenders rude although first drink pretty fast took 20 min asked if wanted another every time that  tried order food attention but walk right pretending dont see waving them hear say 'excuse me' <EOR> Worst experience everrrrrr!!!

He interrupted boyfriend he politely said John may another    he said hold on! if he bothering him  both work service industry gave benefit doubt continued wait  then saw phone talking other guests avoiding area  When he finally made back boyfriend accidently dropped tray french fries John furious boyfriend said sorry brother which replied waiting long enough he said then he drops shit bar? Oh hell no!! said work behind bar know accidents happen he then stayed quiet decided take money elsewhere  bartender rude should behind bar     I'd rather drive extra 10 miles see Rick new spot  <EOR> It's good place hangout drink Saturdays especially sweet because karaoke  just needs more lighting better happy hour menu least new items choose from  <EOR> Since Big Dogs Nellis Owens away needed local watering hole   found place few blocks house   drinks cold food tasty very affordable service fantastic   Definitely beats other places Sunrise Manor  <EOR> Well main reason bar koo people good vibes  bartender kills vibe much literally never coming again  thought maybe he just having bad day but going 3 times pretty much confirms it  Customer service literally worst seen  Disgusting guy service industry  personable all  Barely does job because ask everything anything if sit could whole shift served    Last time brother hair food wait very long time even tell guy because he never checked food  finished food still 5 8 mins brother flag down tell hair  brother said he understood things happen but he gave brother attitude asking want?! want another want take off!?
