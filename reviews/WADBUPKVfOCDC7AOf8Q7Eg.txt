They fresh fruit completely no smoothies  Then asked baked pancake dish which supposed made lemons raspberries    and lady register said VERY good! word weren't many veggie dishes menu  looked beautiful but AWFUL! Somehow dry undercooked   and raspberries literally sour  Which should known seeing she said FRESH fruit  Ugh    Also upon asking water breakfast she charged 4 dollars brought tiny little Fuji bottle  Forget place   there's much better Vegas! <EOR> Giving extra star service nice patio area  serving sizes food big but just ok  breakfast wrap tasteless  skillet same   supplement salt pepper <EOR> Stayed hotel looking good place eat breakfast wife  Decided give place chance glad did!

<EOR> Sadly when new management company took over MGM Signature also took over cafe   All food still pretty good but menu completely changed   Feels more cater more adult tastes but prices still reasonable   Instead gelato beer tap   while  bad Vegas   literally walk  30 feet beer any other alcoholic drink but cannot gelato     A short walk down there's even full bar don't see point getting rid gelato  <EOR> Great service good tasting breakfast food   portions huge but them well  Service great if buy coffee refills all day long carry receipt  Try raspberry pancakes chicken sausage  <EOR> At first wasn't sure place   living tour first thing morning scouting places quick nourishing bite nearest area  Found little gem closing hours couldn't see menu across dark room area   decided give try am very glad did  wrap sandwich fruit Mr eggs meat dish   Both served quickly correctly delicious!

<EOR> Lunch Friday 8 7 15  Located inside Signature MGM hotel there's small cafe serves delicious sandwiches other delights  Service average   I usually visit place during convention gets pretty busy  items pricey side but again Vegas   My favorite item far blackened chicken sandwich  comes warmed side dish pickle  tried coleslaw which drenched sauce decided bag chips second time around  co workers would order pizza say delicious  also variety sandwiches eggs small alcoholic selection drinks snacks purchase located along wall    I would recommend place lunch if you're big hurry  nice sit down place outdoor seating well  <EOR> Their scrambled eggs gross potatoes cone egg meat dish cold stale! <EOR> Since there's much  close Signature Delights would your only choice if didn't feel traveling far grab bite  Food ok along decent selection breakfast lunch but service slowwwwww  ordered 2 sandwiches took 25 mins come out  place 4 people it     Prices bit high but Vegas  4 dollars Fiji water? Jeebus  also beer wine here  place sits 15 25  <EOR> I used love place point come EVERY time found myself Vegas  All because amazing blackened chicken sandwich had  very favorites ever life  told friends family colleagues  crazy woman! But just November 4th found new chef new menu  All no blackened chicken sandwich  Mind heard also best selling sandwiches had  WHY would idiot new chef take among other well selling items off menu?! Now menu seems boring generic lunch options  would formally complain tell chef suck it  BUT am giving two stars opposed less excellent ladies register served sweet attentive sympathetic plight!

Nope well    place earns name 'gourmet deli'  While menu tight sandwich combos well thought out  prices? great  Am against $10 egg sammies? Sure  But when Melrose Avenue scrambled egg whites sliced avocado fire roasted diced tomatoes mushrooms turkey bacon whole wheat wrap look past inflated price tag  Also $8 chili better best chili ever   and kinda was  your average heavy oiled sloppy joe bowl more Manhattan clam meets minestrone meets vegetarian chili damn good  Chinese chicken salad decent but probably skip next time around    My suggestion? Come if you're area HH where pizzas half price brews $2 50  Staying Signature? Don't hesitate few meals when you're rush  Nothing menu over $12  <EOR> They probably best sandwiches ever had    life    I love convenient place is  stayed Tower 2 whenever craving some real food want wait line buffet stuff face junk food I'd just come downstairs    PROS BOURBON ST  sandwich  Hands down best sammich ever had  MARKET ST  sandwich  Very close second  Huge portions  Choice fruit cup potato salad sandwich    CONS takes FOREVER your food  Sometimes 20mins  Those sandwiches $12  Most expensive sandwich ever had  Breakfast forte  ordered southwest scramble breakfast  paid $15 plain wheat toast scrambled eggs dollop sour cream fruit salad    If come back  am definitely ONLY coming back Bourbon Market  Everything else irrelevant  <EOR> We owners signature used come restaurant frequently wonderful breakfast skillets  would enjoy them mimosas coffee  things really liked restaurant where breakfast potatoes  morning came down ordered breakfast served tater tot's  eat gluten free  cannot eat tater tot's    My Huevos rancheros served ice cold cheese ice cold pepper something resembled refried beans sure because didn't eat big pile tater tot's overcooked egg    My husband ordered $14 00 Denver omelette menu but say omelettes  told don't peppers omlette   whaaaat? cold pepper served Huevos Rancheros? figure one    I returned breakfast informing them cannot eat tater tot's because eat Gluten Free foods  remade breakfast omitted corn tortilla  Newsflash chef!
