First all service weird   something never really heard huh? waiter attentive meaning he checked lot but he would ask if roll  little odd because chefs should marking off ordered   Secondly place only sushi but hamburgers French onion soup wings fries bunch non Japanese food items!  pretty cool since some kids may sushi young it    So aunt uncle did most ordering don't know some names rolls but Alfred R  pictures see!   Extra Spicy salmon salad salad salmon really good but aunt couldn't handle extra spiciness  Those chefs true word  felt tongue fire 30 mins!! good Kind spicy but could eat all  ended having them remake it   Johnny roll would absolutely delicious if cucumber weren't bitter  Maybe soaked something keep fresh discoloration!    One favorite crab avocado wrapped salmon! definitely must try! presentation attractive appealing naked eye!   I believe Jose roll tasty but albacore bit off    White tuna salmon nigri great! Seemed salmon more fresh tuna time  Also served last could fill rolls first then can't stand looking nigri when bring out  Smart sly but cool    That's all remember but wished more nigri! Oh serve mochi ice cream!   Enjoy! <EOR> I've just landed Vegas picked friend taken dinner some all eat sushi  place pretty spacious  rolls pretty good  careful ordering much because think did  2 poke salads way table 4 when you're trying eat more rolls  quality wasn't bad either  probably isn't best but no means horrible  If spicy roll prepared major spice! <EOR> Absolutely love place!

Why wouldn't flat rate EVERY OTHER AYCE restaurnt Vegas?? Then realized  99 cent extra ones basically every roll fresh fish filled artifical crab shrimp  little bummed  date didn't say anything but still pretty disappointed    Our rolls good but when pay extra AYCE then point? Also rolls then didn't see waitress 30 minutes  exagerating here  flag down another server waters refilled  Then when wanted order more waitress seemed pissed bothering her  She came over basically told she 3 other tables more imporant    LAST grown man slapping chopsticks water glass trying play music but seriously being loud obnoxious  confused why servers management wouldn't say something clearly bothing most other patrons    I recommend 808 Oyshi both within 5 mile radius place  Don't waste your time somewhere good service better fresh rolls  <EOR> Full disclosure   I am local!

Drinks food group friends well  recommend place  <EOR> I haven't back Kobe some time feel compelled write update recent experience such long hiatus    I came last night mom fella dinner  decided Goyemon but thought better knowing would probably pretty long wait Saturday evening around 8  decided Kobe instead since good happy hour specials rarely long wait  arrived much surprise 30 minute wait or said   Just sat down getting ready wait name called table ready? Yay no wait all    The great thing Kobe restaurant HUGE   always good thing but great  decor set way don't feel place big unwelcoming  very intimate feeling despite size  tons tables booths plenty room large parties which fantastic  highly recommend place large groups hoping celebrate birthdays such  restaurant size definitely advantage respect many local places cannot accommodate large parties well    On food  Solid always  best sushi town that Goyemon book but definitely good option happy hour AYCE pricing actually quite bargain  having option AYCE when feeling gluttonous la carte discounted rolls nigiri if suits mood  <EOR> I live around corner just found gem! food excellent alongside upper scale casual though eating atmosphere  am giving Kobe 4 5 stars only due fact many rules regulations all eat  came first time ever all eat sushi but decided b c would lot more expensive just ordering plus wouldn't allowed take any unfinished sushi home or share If only person gets all eat other person cannot eat any it   waitress started immediately telling pay food don't finish also half orders  Eating all sushi first time should relaxing experience open smorgasbord sushi money rules shouldn't mattered but instead felt getting arrested read rights! Overall still great sushi spot better staff selection! <EOR> Very disappointed tonight's service lack of   understand place busy see that   wait 30 mins sat again busy that   Once finally sat seated back corner feared exactly would happen next   waited 15 mins server ask if helped she finally took drink order   While waiting additional 10 mins even glass water see people seated already eating   am usually sit bad service just come back   couldn't take asked another server cancel drink order walked out   way waitress apologized blamed being busy   understand being busy but serve your customers order   shame really place  <EOR> We excited place especially since all eat screaming orgasm unfortunately expectations high  First off good service great tempura great screaming orgasm mediocre sauce basically watered down mayo  sushi just soggy sauce much  rolls bad sent back lady said since all eat can't send back but just time she will  ordered some chicken yakatori 3 times worse sushi roll but since couldn't send back resorted hiding rest napkin throw way out  Finally desert moochi whip cream doesn't together all some reason    Don't reccomend place all    It's sad because could much potential place nice  <EOR> 3 words Happy Hour Sushi!   Not only deco restaurant point only staff very kind but theyre half off yes half off sushi selection major nums sure   To top off Sundays happy hour open close!!!   I would mos def recommend coming here  <EOR>
