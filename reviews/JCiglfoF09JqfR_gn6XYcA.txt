This quite possibly worst pizza ever tasted  coming someone pregnant craving pizza starving  needed good NY style pizza  far that    My negative experience started off walking into restaurant where no greeted us  place empty should taken cue but decided give chance since right down street new house    One owners behind counter other sitting table crap all over it  Judging discoloration tablecloth looked he sitting same spot past 25 years point where he become permanent fixture restaurant  also looks decor remained same past 25 years  But digress    We ordered cheese pizza slice  $2 50  wouldn't bad if big ol' delicious slice NY pizza   She takes slices pizza     looked TINY first off     old cold  asked those slices fresh? she responds  Yes pizza fresh everyday  Um didn't ask if made within past 24 hours asked if fresh oven  clarified asked made recently? she said According health code them morning put them refrigerator right away  Then heat them order  Where come  fresh     but okay    I order extra garlic ask if  fresh  She says yes then pulls huge jug minced garlic uses bare hands grab garlic rubs all over pizza  Gross!  food comes expected looks greasy re heated day old pizza  taste bland unsatisfying  Completely subpar  would happier ordering chain   After completing meal leave neither owner says goodbye thank coming     ONLY people restaurant  never ever going back even though could basically walk ride bike home suggest eating whatsoever  <EOR> I want love pizza but just good wish would and eat pizza least once week   Just bland opinion nothing really special it  popped every now then since opened hoping magic but alas still just kinda average  local place owned local guy good patronize places this  Some people love see other reviews give try your own decision  <EOR> Do waste your money   Sabrett dogs old  Nothing fresh   pizza taste frozen tried them AGAIN     more time turned off last year    still poor customer service cleanliness    <EOR> They some real good pizza chicken wings  family owned shop totally franchise thier own dough its fresh yummy if your thinking pizza think vits also deliver next time craving some pizza doesn't taste rest call vits stop by  really nice feel welcome! <EOR> This pizza wonderful! My mom lives near when visit daughter always order pizza! am pregnant bad reflux ONLY pizza town tastes great doesn't feel sick Crust super thick much sauce cheese! Perfect <EOR> Went lunch today work  12 calzone mushroom onions  ok but just ok  crust lacking some flavor mushrooms tasted little plain though onion mozzarella ricotta cheeses tasty meat sauce good flavor it  meatball sub past which outstanding they're always super friendly when been 3 times before meatball sub   Comparing mark rich's grimaldi's calzone would place 3rd  Wouldn't back calzone though try pizza next time  <EOR> There's few things base reviews when comes great food hot spots but when comes local owned special attribute keep eye ear heart awww ! open rare trait family oriented  came into Vit's looking some food before going play some volleyball ever hearing little Italian owned pizzeria  First thing asked when stepped long here!? Michael Vito's nephew says 4 years  come haven't heard you? Michael said don't advertise gain business through word mouth  just before he said himself said myself 'They must doing something right if they're still around since 2007!'  I lucky enough meet whole gang there! tell they're most pleasant people ever met  Hospitable welcoming very warm hearted people! Michael greeted very nice tell specials $3 95 slice cheese pizza soda   placed order started looking around  dining area decorated dining room tables you'd find your own home  Very vintage style love it! While walking around admiring place Michael asked if ever fried dough powdered sugar told no he offered some straight container he giving aunt's friend  met Vito himself he told reassured even everything made scratch  tried cheese pizza brief convo Vito's wife Lois absolutely doll headed out  I loved family oriented environment being family owned restaurant definitely come back visit new found Italian family! Thanks Uncle Vito! definitely coming back soon! <EOR> As reading previous reviews wanted try Vits pizza called ordered  gentlemen took order very nice delivery lady also very nice ordered vegetarian pizza which very good dough wasn't thick sauce perfect  also Jalapeno poppers good well  try fried dough very impressed    Everything great! Thanks guys <EOR> I know place stayed open long???  close if good would order all time    good pizza over priced wings bad super expensive tried once even gave second chance never back <EOR> very over priced  pretty sure everything frozen just deep fried  hot inside understand overs hot but better ventilation systems might considered purchased next  very clickish inside usual's treated better more serviced  awkward experience  Owner talked finances other personal issues just didnt seem professional  Food nothing exciting  Blah really <EOR> My husband came night because Chinese place next door busy which husband very happy    two employees I am assuming owners place friendly quick take order  very disappointed amount time took them large pepperoni pizza some garlic bread  food good but bit over priced get  definitely back only real complaint amount time waited  want give them benefit doubt say amount time took could due fact busy night employee running door deliveries other staying back pizzas   also could seemed longer because starving just wanted eat  Haha Regardless definitely back because enjoyed pizza  <EOR> Good pizza nice people good service  think pizza little over priced size  <EOR> Average best   Very very nice people but just average taste well above average cost  <EOR> Very disappointing   Found Vit's Restaurant dot com printed certificate purchased   When arrived owner only store talked pizza   mentioned purchased Gift Certificate he told hadn't accepted since end January some 90 days ago   explained just purchased printed cert less 20 minutes ago   He mentioned having problems website   decided ahead give them try when middle aged man seems related owner walked owner mentioned gift certificate   He proceeded raise voice if fault purchased certificate  told just trying customer problem surely wasn't rather marketing website where purchased certificate he meekly apologized then couldn't keep mouth shut   then told would never eat establishment even if last restaurant Earth   then left drove another restaurant dinner   Never taste food couldn't past crappy customer service   careful  <EOR> Don't know place 5 star review  pizza literally tastes tombstone pizza supermarket  Oh forgot mention large pepperoni pizza its $24!!!! Really!? Never again thats sure <EOR> I've ordered Vit's few times now really it! same guy delivered pizza each time ordered he's really sweet  delivery never takes long time ask nothing missing everything tastes good  only pizza mozzarella sticks but definitely recommend them  crust isn't thin but don't think thick all but favorite part cheese! don't think Vits similar Dominos Pizza Hut  good thing  Vits little pricey but worth expensive anything    Long story short Vits favorite pizza place found Vegas  Don't bad reviews try yourself  <EOR> I gave 1 star because couldn't lower that   Okay sum experience bullet points case literally reading while line *overpriced pizza tastes cardboard *service terrible staff feel you've never eaten pizza your life *salad looks came bag WalMart down street *matter fact wouldn't surprised if everything came wasn't same Walmart including pizza!!! Well actually Walmart pizza surprisingly good Bottom line don't waste your money time eating here   guys obviously don't care provide good product but don't mind taking your money   Anyone gave over 3 stars must really hungry never ate good pizza  <EOR> I just start off saying owners really really great here  bf deciding factor try place   As pizza decent  would consider New York style  thin crust lots toppings little greasy side overall bad place eat  Prices you'd expect local store  We'll probably again if craving pizza don't want ourselves  <EOR>
