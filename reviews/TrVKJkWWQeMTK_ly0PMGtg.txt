Pocha short pojangmacha which literally means covered wagon  typically refer tent nowadays terms used street vendors  refers more street vendors street tent over them which really popular during winters Korea typically really popular during late nights  serve appetizers noodles soups  Different pochas different menus  pretty much restaurant  Whenever eat pocha there's always liquor involved  If you've watched any Korean dramas most likely seen one  usually tent place chairs tables main actor actress getting drunk There's actually many traditional pocha places big city anymore  mostly moved into brick mortars now    Unfortunately YasikNara don't liquor available yet  assume waiting liquor license  Huge bummer because Korean late night foods same without some beer soju    YasikNara extensive selection menu  range your usual Korean dishes such kimchi pancakes ddukbokki spicy rice cake fried chicken your not so usual but traditional pocha dishes such soondae blood sausage spicy chicken feet raw sea snails   even incorporated some fusion items kimchi pasta into menu  no matter type Korean food you'll definitely find them here    We decided order fried chicken $15 spicy chicken feet fried rice $20 stir fried chicken gizzard $15  spicy chicken feet located hot n spicy section menu section able choose spicy want scale 0 7  If want idea spicy spicy waitress told 2 medium spicy  adventure go er  If you've read reviews am also glutton spicy pain  handle heat challenge scale if tell your 2 medium  But why your scale tilted? asked base spice levels  gochujang red pepper paste tons peppers it? She told chili extracts  Well then   personal experience chili extracts don't want fuck it  friend whimped decided level 3  weren't mood fiery butts  Keep mind fried rice uses same sauce chicken feet comes in    The fried chicken came table first  use whole chicken dish pretty small chicken  probably same size chickens ones find Greenland  cut quarters comes shredded cabbage thousand island also dipping salt it  actually reminded deep fried quail  chicken itself pretty decent fried really well  However doesn't remind Korean fried chicken very much      The spicy chicken feet boneless  boneless version but $25 versus $17 plus $3 rice  level 3 spice spicy  hits lingers builds keep eating  would probably compare level 10 Thai restaurant  super delicious though wouldn't mind getting again  However would prefer boneless version but don't think worth $25 it    Lastly stir fried chicken gizzards  came two different types dipping sauces sesame oil salt pepper something similar Tabasco  dish okay    think would preferred bit more flavor  But then again could because chicken feet ton flavor everything else seemed bit bland    I think YasikNara pretty decent place grab some Korean dishes can't anywhere else city  honestly really enjoyed it  However only thing keeping coming back would price point  price point entirely high serving  understand restaurant LA but even LA those prices bit high  am sure if they're charging high prices because unique dishes but just cup tea  mean french fries menu $10 steamed egg $10 sea snail dishes $30    Three stars chicken feet spice levels  definitely come back if lower prices  <EOR> We ordered kalbi which came 3 pieces  Even worse no flavor  very surprised someone actually kalbi ribs bad     tofu stew which very flavorless  ordered pig hocks which should classic Korean dish  sauce good still very flavorless  service idea Korean tapas but really need able good food  Very unfortunate  <EOR> Finally selling favorite Korean drink Soju now  All food delicious LA Koreatown taste quality  Deep fried chicken gizzards bossam spicy crispy chicken great  can't wrong spicy menu selection  saw order home using those apps probably start ordering home  <EOR>
