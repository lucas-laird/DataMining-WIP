Fills hunger hole lunch  Breakfast chilaquiles machaca great yesterday! <EOR> Mexican food gone bad    I used patronize establishment years ago always consistent decent lunch  Times changed  really disappointed    My lunch pretty basic consisted two chicken enchiladas beans rice  took extremely loooooooong time receive food which thought unusual  looked around couple times many people dining us  When food finally arrived a bit surprised  hard tasty enchiladas? sauce really bland virtually no flavor  chicken didn't appear seasoned  past meals amazing but bad particular lunch    I understand Neon project taking place going move location  am hopeful new location warrant better food more stars!   I say although took forever receive order service still really good reason third star  <EOR> I love place   love Spanish rice opinion best town believe really picky  chips salsa amazing too  also love owner he such great host very humble guy  love promise  <EOR>
