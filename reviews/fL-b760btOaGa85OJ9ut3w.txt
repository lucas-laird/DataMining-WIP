Tasty bbq sides galore  Customer service match great eats  love finding gems RSBBQ definitely need know find joint! <EOR> Thanks Cathy's ROTD found place  DAYUM! good! <EOR> Great pork but Brisket needs Lil work   but over all good food <EOR> We pickup parts next door Rollin Smoke BBQ very convient place eat  also sweet tea which helps hot summer day  Try chicken sandwich Mac n cheese  cannot beat <EOR> Went simply because huge BBQ fans all good reviews check out  say wasn't thrilled may because order which 2 sandwiches 1 beef brisket 1 smoked chicken  beef brisket very greasy lacked seasoning came waffle fries which okay nothing special  chicken nice well seasoned but bit skimpy portion side salad mine came vinaigrette very spicy certainly traditional salad vinaigrette  Overall good service decent food but nothing wild  <EOR> I place but service slow food bad  table sat sticky general cleanliness place sub par opinion  Maybe expecting much based other reviews but can't give place high marks  try again near future see if come different conclution next time  <EOR> The restaurant very odd industrial area near auto shops strip clubs warehouses probably only area  walk haphazard restaurant much front counter but instead confusing podium order no standing most time  menu wall kind near podium better know want before walk over order  handful two four large top tables between two awkwardly cramped rooms place sparsely decorated few down lights some reclaimed wood walls  tell thrown together cheaply but seems fit homegrown feel backyard BBQ  great smell smoke fills space whole time sit never really fades away while you're your clothes when leave   The menu features pretty much all standards would expect BBQ joint but said suckered into ordering Outlaw Burger brisket onion bell pepper onion strings red cabbage slaw lettuce tomato cheddar cheese chipotle aioli  skeptical any BBQ place can't sweet tea right nervous thing given somewhat flavorless tea sat while waiting burger arrive  came just big enjoy patty alone thick mass meat  possibly bit overcooked just because its size long cook  bun far small thin hold mess even decent helping lettuce bottom create buffer any sauce  Probably best flavor whole thing onion rings which tasted far better own burger where lost myriad flavors  huge glob cheese good flavor but most other things burger just bit much it  aioli slaw other items couldn't really tell much because didn't notice them enough  think if your typical 1 4 1 3 pound burger would probably pretty good still far cry best burger Vegas they've claimed but maybe upper half  But recent complaints huge burger San Diego just much properly enjoy   Something extremely puzzling disappointing complete lack fries burger  Looking menu online now apparently $8 99 smoking deal Outlaw Burger deal just burger read small print bottom where says add $3 side drink  wish guy took order would said something spent $2 just iced tea expecting fries picture burger  burger doesn't ordered fries?! guess maybe size surely wouldn't able finish if ate anything else but fries almost always necessity  $11 88 certainly lot food but don't know if worth cost stomach bomb  feeling should stick true BBQ place known best burger   know back test theory  <EOR> We ate first time hearing great was I can't wait back We ordered 4 meat 3 side plate $19 95 Great way sample food Practically licked fingers ate tasty You must patient line order usually All food ate tasted fresh though Great ribs meats Worth try want more  <EOR> Do hire catering events     food bad service terrible    only over charge more agreed amount contract    But also additional labor request waste money    did Staff bus anything agreed   Via email amd text message  prepared hire bus staff another vendor but stated own team bus tables serve    didn't anything   Now responding any items writing bring lawyer    Not worth headache  if saw mess call invoice would understand why any kind business skill other cooking   I would suggest using any other BBQ company town deal chef lack business  One more thing   if use them sure check math    correct them during process <EOR> We Pit Special came 5 meats 3 sides  All meats mediocre exception pulled pork which actually really good  sides waffle fries loaded mash bbq beans  waffle fries tasty seasoned well nice crisp exterior  loaded mash isn't worth tasted instant mash potatoes which probably was  Also baked beans weren't great either  Lastly usually if meat isn't great sauce but time  did variety sauces choose but weren't great some them kind tasted similar  <EOR> There 4 us   1 South Trio 2 1 4 Chick Ribs Fries 1 Midwest Duo Brisket Chick Bacon Pot Salad 1 East Coast Pulled Piggy Fries 1 Islands Duo Ribs Chick Mac n Cheese      Plus all meals came drinks    1 clean    Picnic tables large though seating limited    2 EVERYONE enjoyed food    loved Chef came see if all we're doing well even times delivered food    3 Again food good looked good smelled great hit spot plenty  Almost all brought part back rooms    4 read other reviews came when wouldn't wait line  would worth wait even if hadn't  <EOR> This place outstanding!! consider myself choosy when buying ribs away home because come prefer usually cook  Man place great menu well prepared ribs  ribs just want wood cooking  Tasty tender  visiting place every time Vegas! <EOR> I word mouth say place definitely worth it  South Georgia Florida think place really close ideal restaurant  pulled pork sandwich side greens  Wasn't keen hoagie roll mainly because used pulled pork hamburger buns but  inconsequential due fact pork awesome  main method judging BBQ joints passed flying colors  Added greens perfect  If you've missing collards mustard turnip greens great combination all three  Definitely check first dessert  didn't but server didn't mind adding order which nice because consideration  banana pudding which good but would liked some bananas it  Just preference really because overall flavor inline wanted  Additionally service very courteous friendly  Overall would really unfortunate miss place especially because few good BBQ restaurants town  Check out  place worth it  <EOR> The food cold! brisket fatty cold nasty! hot links tasted smoke sausage! beans good but much pepper! Lastly fried okra wasn't crispy! <EOR> 2 stars only because food bomb    customer service needs some work maybe just having off day today   I call order pick 5 20pm  lady says ready 15 minutes  5 45pm food should ready  stand line pay  pay stand next register wait food come out   As standing 15 minutes people ordered paid start getting food    I ask girl working why people ordered getting food before when called order over half hour ago?
