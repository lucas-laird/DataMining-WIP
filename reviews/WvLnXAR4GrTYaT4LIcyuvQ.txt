What?? Chicken pho more well known dishes Hanoi thicker flat rice noodles light chicken broth  NOPE  damn it!  Guess home SF Turtle Tower      Overall Bun Cha Hanoi bad would again if craved it   other dishes want try thit kho but really wish true name served more Northern style dishes opposed same old pho served everywhere else    <EOR> This first visit rice plate forgot name shredded pork grilled pork chop egg loaf delicious until near bone  meat near little pink     I also ordered cha gio which over cooked fryer more burnt side     Price same anywhere else   Their biggest drawback location hidden when place empty food turn over ratio lot slower fresh  <EOR> Went well   OM Goodness    Do Bun cha ha noi  those non vietnamese vietnamese wanna be's bun cha ha noi plate rice noodles side veggies huge bowl grilled meats sauce   never regret it!  couldn't believe huge portion price!
