Everything done typical habachi show  difference liked shrimp he put resembled Mayo Siracha   tasty! also some flavored sake but willing try children's soda there  looked intriguing open it  think push metal ball down top order open it  know must think easily intrigued   I am sometimes   We tempura ice cream finish meal  wonderful ending fulfilling meal! atmosphere isn't rowdy some hibachi places  nice relaxing time where don't yell carry conversation  <EOR> One better Teppanyaki places Las Vegas  Key point Teppanyaki fried rice! If rice bad      forget it     can't recover  Hokkaido's fried rice good     lets continue         Good service good location   Started off nice cold sake always best way start teppanyaki Then really nice spice edamame    good hot!!! Ooooooo Yeah! Salad crisp fresh good ginger dressing  Miso soup good quality  Entree Shrimp very good  Lobster even better!!!! Super tender juicy seasoned butter garlic dipping sauce little extra touch flavor which nice treat   Lets back fried rice       key reason return teppanyaki restaurant fried rice nothing fried rice cooked teppanyaki grill     worthy returning  <EOR> Came dinner last night Las Vegas family friends 11 30 14   Place small   sushi great   Would definitely come again sushi   Hibachi isn't bad   Portions bit small other hibachi places which fine   also upcharge fried rice while other hibachi's comes it   don't serve noodles your meal which also fine   Service good   Wasn't crowded all when went  <EOR> We Teppan Steakhouse because some best reviews Yelp   also chose Teppan because 81 year old mother law never one   wanted show Japanese flair cooking singing twirling spatulas flying eggs course onion volcano    Unfortunately think DISHWASHER CHEF table   All other tables filled oooohs ahhhhs chef's tricks but lame cook did NONE traditional fun   He basically cooked food normal fashion would home   Why pay extra money this?   He didn't enough rice even fill bowls he sliced cooked steaks time special flavoring TABLESPOON GARLIC per small steak    Luckily saw before he mine asked hold garlic   wants hide flavor good filet mignon huge dollop garlic?  His onion volcano pitiful 2 layers onion rings  he left vegetables last cooked them little time firm practically RAW plate  Cold raw cabbage mix? blech! I gave 3 stars because despite pitiful skills soup rice steak did good flavor   vegetables fresh would good if properly cooked   If good chef sure would excellent restaurant   just unlucky  Hokkaido manager hope read sure properly train chefs before put them floor   fun dinner any means  <EOR> I last week Good previous times before  Wednesday night asked waiter sushi menu  never sushi      ask shrimp Tempura roll he kind explained then asked menu see wanted     couldn't decision time bring soup salad appetizers which soup lukewarm son's husband's boiling hot      No problem switched son  salads came when say three pieces lettuce half bowl ginger sauce     Believe ask waiter joking serious way guys cut back salad he said oh yeah just appetizer       Oh okay but meal $28 00      Then look arrived shrimp tempura roll DID ORDER yet    told didn't order he looked well he made it    look sushi bar guy staring kept it  told next time send back     husband kept saying send back if don't want it  chef nice guy cooked food so so he seem he couldn't wait off he could hit club   hey live Las Vegas        don't think back any time soon very disappointed    quality really down    liked them wayyy over Benihana town     <EOR> Came friday night friend's bday  Place pretty busy luckily reservations  Parking lot also pretty full  Food good everything seems pretty fresh  ordered scallops filet mignon  Scallops melts your mouth  fan filet mignon chewy flavor wasn't there  Service excellent  am disappointed why need pay extra fried rice? heck shouldn't included? portion size fried rice also teeny tiny  they're putting diet  Seriously  2 pcs  shrimp side veggies which includes onions zucchini sprouts mushrooms  think 5 pcs scallops also handful filet mignon  don't eat lot but even portion size tiny worth 30+ dollars charge plus pay extra fried rice which stupid only little barely full cup  <EOR> My favorite Teppanyaki sushi restaurant Las Vegas  owners some nicest people ever met  food delicious chef's put good show  Great place bring family! <EOR> GOOD Our group 6 2 kids 4 Adults wanted tepanyaki thought would good entertainment kids while adults drank   ha!  No way driving strip tepanyaki   so glad didn't   knew great place neighborhood really reasonable prices portions quality   I would definitely suggest steak entree   combos good but just seemed more bang your buck single entree  orders  See menu pics The chef great see pic sorry didn't remember name   too much sake  He entertaining kids actually carrying conversation us   Fried rice bomb  everybody happy seasoning sauces whole meal  two other tables kids   so definitely family friendly   The service great staffing perfect   = There's bar dining area but very small   its type you'd wanna hang eat dinner by    just saying   BAD The lighting restaurant fine when walked cause two other tables full service 745pm    cleared different tables grills   they shut off lights ambiance gets very gloomy dark   Hence 4 stars instead 5 stars  Ambiance killer   I definitely would dine again family friends   Prices good service    OH! almost forgot cotton candy hit!    i usually stay away type sweet stuff but good = kids loved it! <EOR> This place easily missed its tiny strip mall   drove decided check out  hesitant once entered found place nearly empty Sunday evening  Sure nice wait table but why nobody else here?? sit sushi bar big tables teppanyaki  opted entertainment sat big table  staff very attentive maybe much   man woman waiting tandem clearly didn't communicate  No biggie   chef super entertaining! All same old tricks seen other places but still fun  catching things hat volcano smoke onion etc   oered scallops filet  asked filet rare plus more medium why everyone afraid leave meat tad bloody? Other everything pretty decent  Sushi fresh delish  ordered noodles which almost $5 extra!! disappointed when everyone received rice but me  not sure why   <EOR> My family literally coming Hokkaido since opened when high school  World class hibachi flavorful food most important all excellent service!

Basically thin noodles garlic sauce   Most Japanese stead houses charge extra but  ridiculous   noticed when chef making fried rice $2 95 extra think other guests amount vegetables etc  added decreased last time there  My husband filet scallops scallops   First word comes mind greasy    Everything oily over seasoned   husband felt steak quality used be   scallops good taste but greasy    The chef seemed going through motions beating heart rice onion volcano    Maybe we're just used show but nothing special there  I also ordered glass plum wine   cost $6 95   Wouldn't complain but glass less 1 2 full  honest pour  There several places valley higher quality better price  We won't back  <EOR> I ordered pick craving spicy tuna roll  Ordered ultimate tuna scallop mix zucchini miso fried rice cucumber salad sashimi yellow tail  All delicious would given 5 stars wait time took additional 15 mins overall food good  <EOR> This great find  Staff friendly attentive food excellent  Jason entertaining fun cook prepare table side dinner  2 five year olds enjoyed whole experience  Memorable evening parents wedding anniversary  <EOR> Its located across Garden Park newish Summerlin Area   place very clean high end Asian Chic if such thing   Wait staff friendly well mannered   wasn't super busy around 7pm when arrived but most reached full house 8pm   Our teppanyaki chef Matt very entertaining he's lots cheesy food jokes but seemed really enjoy he doing which made experience much better! food great   steak shrimp chicken scallop veggies well fried rice   Everything par satisfying   We also ordered Chef Special Hokkaido Scallop Sushi roll   reason why ordered because sushi roll banana which ingredient never seen sushi before   the end result W O W!  Its chunk sweet banana top tender scallop both wrapped soy paper whole thing flash fried then topped surimi some yummy orange color aioli   representation dish pleasing eye taste reminds tempura fried banana almost dessert like! combination almost surreal leave wanting more!  For dessert ordered Lychee Creme Brulee   also ordered curiosity   didn't think Lychee would pair well creamy eggy things   guess wrong!  Lychee flavor definitely big part creme brulee   way lightened heaviness dessert   bottom also found chunks lychee which added bonus dish!  We left place full stomach big smile   Goodtimes! <EOR> Awesome!!! Ask Aaron chef lots good energy very entertaining!
