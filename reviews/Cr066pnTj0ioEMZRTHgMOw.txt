Groupon he said could use take dine in only   showed details valid take out he said OK well then if use charge 15% gratuity  point just left     So long story short people trying drum business partnering Groupon Yelp Restaurant com then when customers arrive being charged more front many menu items possibly being restricted dining in only when  stated ahead time then being charged gratuity top everything possibly even take out if allow it!      I love middle eastern food kabobs but lot better this   Bad food bad customer service screwing customers prices   would want take business place this? <EOR> The food delicious service superb  green sauce free must try  only reason why gave four star because doing some kind renovation corner restaurant cushions everywhere  Sore eyes hahaha  <EOR> Great food!

Upon entering FK totally hella sketchy area enter giant place below office buildings  counter asked beloved chicken breast kabobs  Now last time them meal came 2    time 1 price 11$!! Normally only around 9! work opened food box WTF! chicken over cooked seasoned all! disappointed! rice also great super plain! only saving grace pita bread!   I def impressed <EOR> After FIRST visit Flame Kabob wouldn't recommend place  MUST some place Vegas serves outstanding Mediterranean food good value   case searched online again found Flame Kabob Restaurant com   subscribe service wanted use $10 coupon   plan spend required $15 use coupon which should covered check     When arrived first thing noticed POSTED prices varied ACTUAL prices   manager defiantly told he right change prices anytime he chose   While agreed submitted he should probably update menus   Next when placed order manager argued when asked combo NO fries rice   just didn't want carbs didn't ask anything ADDITIONAL   simple request seemed much much however didn't need turn into debate   Afterwards when attempted use $10 discount certificate store manager scoffed complaining many people want use coupons   uh then WHY use them marketing tool?!?!?!  Finally while food tasty portions bit stingy soured whole encounter manager  <EOR> I say Falafel wrap amazing!  seasoned fries crispy delicious  recently revamped dining area decor laid back comfortable leisurely lunch   several lunch specials which provide plenty bang your buck  highly recommend giving them try lunch dinner  <EOR> The food its right temperature well proportioned average wait food prepared  enjoyed back again  place lil different but still good  <EOR> The lady cashier very helpful explained whole menu being first time there  decided #14 Chicken Gyro Wrap  came salad hummus taftoon bread tzatziki dolmeh   absolutely delicious!
