Sad Dragon's Alley no more  such short lifespan  pretty interesting concept beginning  something new n fresh  Unfortunately sometimes good things won't last  Hope review ignite interests people misses place do  <EOR> Walked all way find closed restaurant private function no options general public  worth risk because loooooong walk near end strip  <EOR> Not best food but good considering cafeteria  Worth try different dining experience!  FOOD food different depending when hit miss restaurant  If during slow time less food food  available cold stale  cafeteria broken into stations  stir fried station offer dishes fried rice chow mein steamed clams pork belly fried vegetables  dim sum station doesn't many dishes but offers basics shu mai har gow  meat station offers various skewers steamed soy sauce chicken  noodle station allows create your own noodle soup bowls whatever toppings choose  Dishes range $3 $11 each  Spent over $50 just two people over priced cafeteria food but worth try  Wish place buffet though   DRINK dessert station offers boba drinks if want something freshly made  bottled drinks cafeteria pay fountain drink counter  serve hot tea   DESSERT dessert station lacks variety didn't anything but dim sum station sometimes some sweet pastries aren't bad   ATMOSPHERE cafeteria pretty colorful Asian lanterns  cafeteria stations very clean because new just hope stays way  seating area very unique but most seat very uncomfortable cushioned booths if can  staff new untrained right now kept dropping spilling everything but sure learn better  <EOR> By time pay food food cold  When walk food station don't know what's prices  much authentic Chinese food Spring Mountain  come back again! <EOR> Delicious authentic  chicken feet tofu soup dessert favorite  Monday less crowded more customer service better quality dishes  <EOR> Delicious Cantonese BBQ probably best Vegas  Yes better food upstairs but restaurant beautiful still find lot same dishes found Pearl Ocean  Love boba bar all different flavors mango good  Would come back just that  <EOR> This place amazing   wife place first time everyone tentative  definitely coming back here   <EOR> The food awesome! set buffet university cafeteria style  duck prawns clams Sapporo beer tune $35  food presented its own plate following trend newer buffets town  Chinese pop music plays over speakers nicely decorated room red wooden benches need steal later  sure if supposed eat entire prawn but sure trying shell damn thing  delicious! Besides provide small red napkin choices eating fingers  ask more napkins  waitresses attempted take clam plate away thinking done     lady half plate go  Put down don't touch  <EOR> Horrible organizational system  enough people working behind counter your food  wait seated then wait disorganized line cafeteria style  only lady first station sometimes she'd help another lady  They'd help whoever attention first lol  Our food warm cold time ate cause all waiting trying food   The guy cooking cutting meat  used same tongs handle raw meat cut cooked food   asked ribs BBQ pork  He pulled raw meat put grill then cut bbq those tongs without washing changing lol    Boba milktea watered down good  canned drinks    I liked egg drop soup chestnuts it   The xiao long bao dry top but nice juicy juiciest vegas fact  Best part meal  star that   Braised pork peanut sesame like flavor good would include bones no meat wth    Bbq pork dry tough but good flavor  Ribs okay but slightly salty   Not much place expect service overall <EOR> Located first floor Lucky Dragon casino  Self parking free valet parking also available  Dragon's Alley much potential but trip disappointing   Here's summary had Beef chow fun end buffet bowl noodles all hard chewy since dried out  also cold flavorless  I'd only again if more fresh since only $2  Fish balls overpriced $4 4 alright  reheated broth but only bottom two soft  other two top didn't reach broth cold barely edible  Spicy tofu better dishes but wrong tofu sautéed mapo sauce?  Roast duck small portions but actually decent amount meat  We'd again if craving few bites duck    Overall wish best restaurant improve food quality  plenty seating décor nice  Dragon's Alley basically Chinese food cafeteria but need better warming trays keep food hot  think could really great place if paid more attention details food made smaller batches  Also slow night didn't much turnover  only within first month opening hopefully it'll better  <EOR> The food okay  prices     eh     okay  interesting place bite once  sure if we'd ever back  Possibly   What annoying cook noodle station  Chinese but girlfriend not  could understand noodle station cook chatting another customer Cantonese food  But when girlfriend asked politely he station he SHRUGGED SHOULDERS GRUNTED    So food okay but possible you'll run into ambivalent service if don't speak Chinese  <EOR> Quick but really impressive food  cafeteria inside casino offers lot different  small plates priced $4 $5 each dimsum plates $5 each but usually served hot fresh some dishes even costing only $2 congee sweet sour soup  also boba soup noodle station    We ordered the Singapore noodles plate curry flavor good no shrimp though! Soup Noodles choice rice thin thick noodle cooked order  Comes couple pieces Chinese broccoli shrimp beef balls fish balls  Choice chicken beef broth! beef broth   Broth kind salty overall pretty good  Hot Sour Soup really hot spicy  Duck small plate good but oily Soy sauce chicken prob fav small dishes tried chicken juicy + flavorful boba apparently mango slush boba  great but ran mango   blueberry slush instead which used fresh blueberries but sweet taste! Boba itself great texture would just normal milk tea or Thai tea which nice lady let sample!   also add popping boba addition normal honey boba! <EOR> I just love new Asian market style restaurant  several cooking stations alley     The food surprisingly good casual restaurant  Everything Asian wok dim sum grill BBQ noodles seafood    Great variety friends each like  Reasonable priced several small plates think Asian tapas    Definitely come back next time am town  <EOR> It took forever seated even though clearly lots seats  wasn't until someone looked manager came over talked hostesses finally started quickly seat people  food pretty subpar would recommend going Chinatown food here  Only food item tasted ok hot sour soup  <EOR> Lord help them if busy  Wait line wait line again again all stations then when your table    cold food  It okay pork buns good guess duck cuz people riding copious amounts    This cheap $30 lunch served myself  many other places choose dim sum  Not impressed  <EOR> I wanted check new lucky dragon while satisfied restaurant  Waited while table then waited line cafeteria style kitchen  multiple stations each long line very few workers each station  meat station ran all short ribs duck BBQ pork  15 minutes waiting more meat told would another 40 minutes before BBQ pork would back ended just eating fried rice soup all time   Boba station but milk tea  <EOR> For hotel food definitely  affordable $2 $10 plates   only expensive things drinks! $4  really love concept street food  many wanted try everything! food average tasting  family 4 each everything full off it  If your looking decent place reasonable prices place go  <EOR> The food really bad ! waited over n hour over priced food isn't even passable find better tasting things eat Panda Express lower price $50usd thrown away <EOR> The atmosphere experience great  boba drink station nice  used flavor syrups no real fruit just bland black tea    The food while fair priced extremely lack luster  walked bast dim sum saw them pull frozen dumplings vetoed station  would assumed 5 people would making them fresh    The Singapore noodles greasy no flavor  beef mushrooms favorite! spices actually gave flavor unfortunately didn't experience elsewhere    The grill station great concept skewers meat but I'd rather them cooked order then sitting  2 overcooked beef inedible chicken    We didn't even consider dessert main meal left such bad taste mouths  Hopefully change restaurants quality  opening day already bad  good sign  <EOR> I lot choices here  Portions price anything else use qualify your meals  I chicken stir fry lo mein noodles $6 DOLLARS PEOPLE!
