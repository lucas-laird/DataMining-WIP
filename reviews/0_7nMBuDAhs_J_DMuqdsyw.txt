Cheers! <EOR> I love hot dogs really excited try new place recently opened Southern Highlands  guess chain specializes Chicago dogs business 51 years  Although don't know Chicago dog supposed taste know didn't dig dog very much   I ordered Chili Dog cheese onions $4 50 Cheese Fries $4 29  dog regular size more lukewarm dog  chili cheese just okay bread stale ends  only thing liked meal fries  nothing special but least made fresh good portion   The service good   greeted thanked left   don't think I'd back again when many other wiener options town  I'd rather hot dog drink Costco $1 50   2 5 stars  <EOR> Somebody guys humidifier because everything serve dry dry dry  Hot dogs served semi stale buns  Italian beef tough dry even soaking au jus redeem it  fries starchy flavorless represent complete waste calories   Pass place  <EOR> Extremely disappointing experience   I visited Hot Dog Heaven near end January 2012   located formerly Famous Uncle Al's Hot Dog Grill   While place decent overall immensely better current eatery   First Impressions The first thing you'll notice when walk feel someone found abandoned hot dog restaurant squatting location trying pass off own establishment   Leftover mismatch weird decor everywhere   just feels strange place moment step front door   Menu The front menu states Hot Dog Heaven 51 Years Business    imagine true location any other     The hot dogs range $3 50 $4 59 depending type get   party tried several different types all equally disappointing   also plain dog $2 50 which located 'Side Orders' section some reason   Ridiculously over priced size quality dogs   The actual dog standard small boiled hot dog very little flavor   prepared shocked find cook just grabbed them tray slapped them bun started topping them   He griddle right next why toss dogs even 30 seconds add some bite flavor?  The chili chili dogs bland quality best   Again very little flavor   tiniest sprinkle cheese added plain white onions   seemed no interest sprucing them bit any way   line school cafeteria    The kraut dog awful point where friend didn't even want finish it      They also Hot Wings which believe $9 7 wings   come handful fries but price should double wings least   Even pickle yes just 1 whole bulk purchased pickle cost $1 59   The soda machine seems constantly broke friends mentioned way when he only time well     Overall I could more disappointed place   really hoping great local hot dog eatery but it   Steer clear while still open  <EOR>
