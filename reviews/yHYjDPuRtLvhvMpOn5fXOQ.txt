If spice try Oh Gosh never wrong Ultimate Naked  <EOR> The best sushi Las Vegas  Period     If wander off 'usual sushi restaurant' path ask servers something truly worthy chef's talents amazing array unique rare items Naked Fish's often its chillers   disappointed!    The rolls always good safe but little adventurous disappointed  <EOR> I try find new sushi places town almost getting point where need stop doing since always miss no exception     I'm certain many reviewers raving sushi Naked fish very limited NO experience real sushi i e  Japan   I during lunch time menu somewhat unfocused  lot izakaya type items well sushi items although few lunch specials interested sushi counter   all supposed sushi place   It seemed wait staff all Japanese surprised find sushi chefs not   unequivocally bad sign   order couple rolls few nigiris directly sushi chef   My goodness must waited 15 minutes until anything came out   even asked chef if he remembered ordered he said yes but he busy     Did he look busy?  Well yes way but he pretty slow inefficient although he younger 2 chefs but other no faster   Besides 8 seats counter only 3 people     Really if someone orders sushi counter serve them immediately   fundamental   know this?  Japanese eaten many best sushi restaurants Japan including many Michelin starred sushi places Tokyo   really shouldn't comparing Kyubei Sukiyabashi Jiro place Vegas but sushi chef understanding fundamental rules sushi?   why said bad sign when sushi chef Japanese   just don't he certainly no exception   When someone counter order sushi right it   only 4 total orders 2 people long does take?  well took 20 minutes quite irritating     So sushi?  Mediocre best   hard grip little air rice sushi rice liking   fish decent nothing spectacular people say   But 20 minutes waiting 4 pieces sushi lost cause point     All all quite disappointed  going back usual place   Where that?  telling any random people but if people really sushi serious wanting taste learn sushi think need start listening own palate Japan some real sushi something compare standard sushi mind   another nanchatte sushi  <EOR> The waiters waiting hour  ended forgetting 2 dishes charged anyways  shrimp came alive took cooks hostages  <EOR> Our fav sushi joint las Vegas  soft shell salad naked Twinkie roll best  <EOR> Ate Naked Fish again tonight   Food lot better time but     bunch shishito peppers more half super spicy!

Seems getting greed don't sea reason pay over 2 5 literal bite sushi  Anyway! Then wanted some yellow tail piece nigiri lol which also 2 5  When waitress informed yellowtail belly same price took it  When party received bill yellowtail belly wasn't 2 5 but 3 0! While isn't major problem being its only 50 cents extra per piece   the point waitress informed same price when clearly wasn't  add insult injury going complain something irrelevant original complaint which pictures back wall crooked hang awkward least year! might just some ocd ish but good lord fix that! always imagination sushi spots good fend shui hahaha one  bugs even right because favorite spots but owner manager need work customer vibe   food great though <EOR> Great place!

Uhm   why don't ask refund don't take order whichs didn't order then    Well  that okay cause wasn't expecting good services them because place many times service just okay even many times always put 20 25% tip service so so However place few days ago togo order  really disappointed! ! girl looks host person  She looked mad all time when she handed food tell thanks good night  She doesn't answer all just showed mad face  want ask Where hell your customer service??

Maybe but sister restaurant Kyara off 215 Jones favorite beats Naked Fish's mile  <EOR> This favorite place Japanese fare Vegas  Sure find other better places but lunch prices hard beat  love Zaru Chirashi  cold dish best served hot sweltering day  When living Vegas dish least once week during torrid summers there  Zaru Chirashi comes tempura shrimp fried quail egg seaweed some other goodies all top soba udon noodles  give separate bowl sauce dip noodles in    The rolls also great  love Lisa Lisa crunchy roll 911 spicy crab crunchy roll Ulti Oh! Mega roll  lunch menu combo roll deals really great price  Dinner pricier I'd stick lunch menu    Another note you'll often see Cirque Du Soleil performer dining here  cast loves Naked Fish! <EOR> I before am huge fan kyara sister restaurant but last night's visit made second thought place    First ordered 'premium' chirashi bowl  When usually order generous portion 'premium' fish  However although portion pretty good quality fish good  Uni which only gave piece when usually two very fishy shrimp horribly sweet well tamago  Salmon piece cut into two small pieces could tell because saw knife mark  Overall flavor rice WAY SWEET  furikake put rice overwhelming remove all top part rice however fish covering rice already absorbing all sweetness late  also ordered natto maki mentaiko ika maki  Those bad but better natto ones NF    Also service just HORRIBLE  server doesnt even greet asks order  order item he just leaves table whole serving last night  ordered cold sake ice hole single ice it  ice probably won't keep sake cold enough  Also he would just leave bottle corner table saying anything didnt even realize bottle there  When HH ask menu but server never came table take order but he did sure around check other tables  ended ordering through manager when complained service just didn't care all took menu away  Surprisingly received orders but ready leave place    There many restaurants recently opening better quality service  No wonder why Naked Fish gets slower everytime go   Ps some items happy hour menu offered same price regular menu  <EOR> Always fresh! far best sushi Las Vegas! highly recommend Lisa Lisa roll  Service wonderful ask Wanda! <EOR> The place way small felt cramped most expensive roll least favorite because wasn't good just because simplest wasn't worth money  Food pretty good service great <EOR> The service great always asking if needed anything food yummy fresh <EOR> Had dinner other night   Was seated quite fast   Service good   Rolls delicious   Loved happy hour specials   Definitely cute little place  <EOR> I really place!!!! sashimi omakase AWESOOOOOOOOME  beautiful platter some very fresh fish!

This place awesome! pretty small restaurant  around 5pm Friday seated right away  time left 6pm place full few parties waiting line table   They many sushi dishes choose from  liked full picture menu sushi see looks like  Then thought hey place called Naked Fish why try fish? ordered Salmon Miso Yaki Meal husband ordered Conch dish server told special day supposedly very good  few minutes later server came back said salmon wasn't available  she suggested Grilled Sea Bass Miso Butter Meal instead  Miso Black Cod she said similar that  kind hesitant first  mean $27 95 wasn't planning order anything expensive  But then thought hell just bad week relaxing Vegas weekend why not? Well she right great! Good flavor fish easy eat came extra cup miso side  Nice presentation two dishes well food looked very pretty!  Not sure server's name was  receipt said Wanda but sushi chefs where calling Nikki san  Well whoever she she great! Very nice friendly did good job checking time time even though busy  other servers also stopped table ask food was   I definitely back some sushi desserts more fish!
