Alls rememba chili cheese fries actually chili beans them oddly similar batch home  Super tasty!  Recently into bbq burgers w onion rings ordered pretty legit  Hubby sissy ordered Farm Burger which came w a fried egg according them yummy well   This place cheap but if you're Fremont area mood yummy burgers place  <EOR> One worst qualities restaurant rude bad manager exactly restaurant has    I last weekend boyfriend late night ordered two meals  Soon ordered noticed employee front started turning costumers away letting them know would taking orders orders another 20 min due being super behind  while decided ask why taking long food he replied grill restaurant only take many burgers couldn't many orders time     spent while looking around same 6 people before still did food either  two different people pick orders nothing big but whole time staff just talked brought signs outside didn't seem concerned stressed people waiting    Let just say seen more hustle McDonald's!!! couldn't believe mind  More 30 min still didn't food decide manager front ask refund because starving  manager decided reply told would 15 min boyfriend then asked see time check printed he then realized over 30 min said oh well your food ready boyfriend told off reminded manager should always apologize making people wait ridiculous amount time fast food never give smart ass reply when being asked refund  He then realized mistake gave money back but side attitude    I can't see place lasting long if can't handle busy Fremont street good management employees move feet then don't expect succeed    I'll never back  <EOR> Just okay  expected lot more considering price name  especially thought fries would better  But alas items tried pretty much just okay  bad mind but nothing hurry try again  <EOR> I gave place 3 stars based few things parking location quality service taste food  place bit difficult because area DTLV requires paid parking walking   bummer especially visit because wanted quick cheap burger added both timeliness cost stop  staff very nice when however only customer restaurant order wrong  only realized when road  excitedly requested grilled onions jalapeños burger only realize neither when dug in  huge disappointment! But all in all burger ate very tasty still give place three stars  <EOR> I visited place first Friday line door took 20 minutes work way line order    The location awesome smack middle downtown freemont just wish food good  think them In N Outs little brother wants cooler hip having more options when reality should maybe just focus 4 5 different burgers  flippin' sauce once again tries resemble INO but doesn't come close    I would only come back place if need some cheaply priced food between all drinking you're doing downtown  <EOR> This place cool! took minute find look start Fremont street heart attack grill then cross street across Insert Coins Bar next griffin    I just ordered banana shake onion ribs but both reasonably priced $7 88 total came quick both really good!  The shake pieces banana required extra slurp power but really good  onion rings crispy but overly flavor point  mine ketchup but good without  Some them double onions inside batter which good   The inside very white comfy  giant TV playing 90s alternative music videos but decor orange white seemed retro chic liked it  clean inside servers nice even broke $10! come back try burger next time  <EOR> We stopped last night because hubby noticed sign eggnog milkshake  While some weren't crazy selections am absolutely think deserve 4 5!  Hubby said eggnog milkshake wasn't eggnog y enough  Mr  M didn't Macadamia Crunch Concrete  But mom loved it! really enjoyed concrete created peanut butter hot fudge Oreos Reese's Cups! seriously peanut ty just looking for!

I'm sure husband visit again soon  <EOR> The atmosphere service great food good  signature sauce tangy kind thousand island extra side fries  some interesting boozy shakes looked tasty well  probably would if server hadn't brought check but pretty full burger fries already anyway  If you're huge eater would suggest sharing leave room shake  only thing would suggest offer more just American cheese burgers  <EOR> I turkey burger fries both fantastic  turkey burger sad cousin real burger did feel punishment which great  <EOR> The rating based reviews give 4 5 5  During meal would agree but husband finished eating would give 3  Don't wrong food amazing looks picture perfect  seriously kidding tomatoes lettuce pickles look should fake  kitchen spotless workers cooking turned Managers something don't see often  Fried chicken sandwich A+  Double cheeseburger A+  Onion rings A+  flippin' fries omg A+  only thing problem concrete milkshakes   things C flavor best outrageous prices  16oz only size costs $8  No thank doing again  Flippin' good burger just completely lost terrible milkshakes  recommend going but really don't recommend shakes rip off  Love Bug <EOR> Ordered delivery work night awesome! can't wait able actually eat there  <EOR> We Vegas hungry didn't want spend lot time sit down restaurant   found place walking by  portobella mushroom burger  good!

Definitely five star worthy if wasn't lousy service   No greeting all! Sat bar between shift change assume  lovely blonde finishing didn't say crap no menu nothing  Whatevs    Dylan replacement even worse  He literally looked he just crawled bed  placing order realized didn't purchase any sauce requested Dylan charge additional sauces  He asked many needed confirmed each  Mr  Grouch mean Dylan kept asking if sure  thinking myself dude if asked each sure  need not mention shared never   favorite guy randomly wanted negotiate sauce paying reassuring cost extra  Eye roll frustration simple dragged request   Dylan should apply Dicks Last Resort because he clearly hates job  Another bar patron asked he doing he replied here! Way Champ!   Order lower your expectations  food only took ten minutes did mention food delish?  VEGAN Chik'n Sandwich $9x2 Large Fries $5  Onion Rings $4 75 small order but filling Macadamia Crunch Concrete 10oz Dessert $4 75  Sauce  50  $38+ <EOR> I can't speak burgers but vegan chicken sandwich classic hot chicken both totally delicious   server freaking awesome when remember name let know but he hooked olives bloody Mary's added spice vegan chicken     onion rings good spot vegan friendly while having unhealthy glutton options really enjoyed     also just enjoyed vibe doesn't seem loud some other downtown places   cheapest no probably but quality tasty fresh really surprised! <EOR> Not sure place stay business when charge $10 77 beer! better off going Banger Brewing which very close only charge $5 7 beer  <EOR> Maybe came bad night but place nothing special  Burgers undercooked waiting 25 minutes food  Even Chicken Strips just okay according Wife  Chili Cheese fries decent  give 2nd chance guess should saw warning signs place empty Saturday night street full people  <EOR> Decent burgers but bit dry side  burgers made 100% USDA lean angus beef  lean? didn't really occur ask until started writing review  flippin fries out's animal style fries  fries themselves soggy side which didn't enjoy  However actually thought flippin sauce better spread animal fries  said fries still way better  onion rings instead  point!

No thanks walked won't back   Cleanliness says lot restaurant place could care less   Food may good but couldn't imagine myself trying it  would say Robert good employee  <EOR> My experience place good one   accused placing order did ask for   WAN server brought food out   order wrong   asked chicken tenders fries   When he brought order told did ask chili fries he said specifically heard say changed order chili fries   He basically called liar did want say he order wrong anything   would okay whole situation if he would just said bad let  some plain fries   sister law asked cheese chicken sandwich she received anyway   Wan tries say burger didn't need cheese   did appreciate way he responded all   manager very nice it   back again  <EOR> Delicious!
