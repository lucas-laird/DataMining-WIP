No substituting and apparently only person asked thus far except other veggies chef kitchen  removed potatoes almost completely menu except truffle fries THANK GOD those still   lament loss potatoes fresh market area    My husbands disappoint came moment he saw salmon no longer offered market fresh bar but rather premium entree now which he hated idea ge wanted salmon market fresh bowl filet mingnon only available if he bought two premium entrees market bowl mix all together himself  Also he always buckwheat noodles which gone instead thin rice noodles other Asian based carbs except fettuccine noodles  Another let down husband first but he did enjoy rice noodles he tried it    My saddest moment realization chef grill no longer tastes he cooks leading fettuccine alfredo sauce dish incredibly bland  sauce thin greasy tasteless grilling happened creaminess? cook also always previously very friendly would talk while watched cook fun time stood watching he looked if say need something?? Also husband cod fish tilapia bowl effectively causing dish taste fishy something GREATLY dislike since don't eat seafood    *staff nice attentive   *delicious dessert despite never getting exact combination request really should write those orders down   *warm yummy bread salted butter *drinks little rough mixtures first round but better night on   or maybe buzz getting  <EOR> Very friendly service food great  Mongolie Grill fantastic fresh  made 6 8 year old girls feel comfortable  return  <EOR> Had lunch yesterday  tapas choices excellent food itself even better!

I came friends  ordered couple different appetizers  ordered build your own sides  soy ginger vinaigrette spinach baby bok choy basmati rice zucchini chicken breast  ok  all eye appealing  kind ironic everything else very much fine dining very well presented plates  Reality build your own side stir fry  portion size money great deal  would recommend less better comes choosing your components  If order side side share taste more menu  only room roasted tomato bruschetta  good  desserts very good  tried four different ones forgot names  Each stood out  service awesome  waiter all night  food nothing wow me   The lounge area pretty cool  front patio area Boca Park  huge wide screens  could see myself hanging lounge HH checking game  food much cause nothing stood me  <EOR> They supposedly open 12  11 56 sat down eat outside  12 02 someone came said wouldn't opening until 12 15 because chef running late  Although she offered water pretty rude really inviting mention lazy late! If they're crazy getting money really top other things health safety? <EOR> I never write reviews but writing warning because place truly awful  sliders look nothing picture meat inedible  Preeeeeetty sure macaroni cheese came box  Such fail  <EOR> Happy Hour starts 10 30pm  Happy hour menu items $4 77 why taxes included pay $5 flat  smart  Cool friendly workers there  <EOR> My husband once month since two young children choose dates carefully  seeing all great reviews decided check Mixx did disappoint! modern upscale but pretentious  able enjoy large patio great weather  server very friendly offered helpful suggestions  iPad drink menu which pretty cool  Unlike most photos food drinks ours actually looked just pictures beautiful  mango drink side shot champagne  fresh delicious! appetizers tried sliders snd bruschetta both perfect size satisfy but spoil your meal very tasty  dinner concept drew location  choose all your own ingredients fresh display meats vegetables pasta rice sauces  employees helpful offering suggestions craft delicious dinner  chose filet shrimp ate beyond being full because good!!

Wrong!!!  Especially when friends together Happy Hour   worst tapas ever!!! We ordered bruschetta okay  stuffed mushrooms   Omg never seen anyone served stuffed mushrooms button mushrooms   normally prepared portobello mushrooms right?  Lmfao!  button mushrooms!!!  also ordered chicken lettuce wrap came 1 chicken cubes very dry tasted just drenched teriyaki sauce   joke!  tell  waiter never chicken lettuce wrap way restaurant prepared even waiter agrees   Overall tapas horrible but waiter very nice honest pleasant very attentive    Paid bill walked Kona Grill instead real Happy Hour drinks tapas  <EOR> I found Groupon decided try newish Westside spot  menu sounded interesting but execution very weak  It great day sit outside but table sat smallest 4 seen  Thank goodness only 2  The stir fry menu chicken thighs shrimp lo mein noodles   They no black iced tea just substituted  tropic green iced tea Arnold Palmer ordered without checking us  Happy hour bruschetta whole blistered grape tomatoes which enjoyed but husband did not  Tartare $13 77 tablespoon less tuna blah taste  Crab cake seemed pre packaged frozen enough sauce  Server nice but seemed very inexperienced untrained  No good info menu did offer another drink even when glass empty  Won't return <EOR> Went dinner couple months ago  serving sizes perfect! friend able order couple things share could try bunch stuff  Everything amazing  highly recommend going here  <EOR> I pretty stoked try place but huge disappointment  greeted right away sat outside  waited 5 minutes before hostess brought waters said server would shortly  another 5 minutes before server said sorry wait  guys want anything besides water? asked beers tap since cocktail menu only overpriced mixed drinks listed  He named off few beers including sriracha ale  boyfriend intrigued because he likes try weird beers he asked was  server told local brew he it  He liked but couldn't figure why called sriracha ale googled it  actually Sorachi Ale Brooklyn  He said Sriracha said Sriracha multiple times  dude clearly no idea    We ordered salads 5 minutes later ordered fish n chips  salads came same time meal another 15 minutes later  ordered salad before food if before  He didn't even acknowledge salads took 20 minutes came food  fish pretty good but fries looked something middle school cafeteria  clearly frozen crinkle cut fries    The beer $10 16 oz which insane  22oz strip cheaper  said cocktails way over priced    The atmosphere super weird  don't even know describe besides saying happy outside watching football projector low sound because ambiance inside eery feel  mention strange outfits staff wore       Unfortunately don't think back Mixx  <EOR> I come all time cocktails! Mar Tea Ni absolute favorite! Normally hate gin but every drink menu fantastic executed perfectly  atmosphere fun exciting bartenders life party! only flawless drinks but create fun lively atmosphere every guest coming back more! absolute BEST place spend your weekends at! Larry G Phil kings bottles masters cocktails  truly put MIXX Mixology begging knees more  would recommend place all friends looking great drinks amazing food fantastic service all around great time! <EOR> The Mixx quickly becoming new hot spots  love variety fresh vegetables proteins  some best appetizers around  definitely recommend steak tartare brussel sprouts Rib cap  Wide range food tastes accomodated  Cool atmosphere great bar very nice patio  Unique cooking style right open view middle restaurant  highly recommend trying place out  <EOR> Went few nights ago family  astounded concept restaurant  Upon arrival immediately greeted owner  He very nice helpful  could tell he wanted amazing experience there  He well rest staff provided excellent service! couldn't ask better experience best gets! definitely back would definitely recommending place friends! <EOR> I can't believe place open year  only reason giving place 2 stars instead 1 because did receive amazing service young man shaved head Cabernet good  My boyfriend ordered shrimp cocktail potstickers mushroom risotto deviled eggs rolled street tacos shrimp scampi  Let start saying wouldn't order single item again   The shrimp cocktail best simply because sauce horseradish flavor   it   The rolled tacos all rolled tacos  big chimichanga tasted similar ones $1 frozen section Albertsons  pot stickers also time frozen then covered sauce probably came jar  shrimp scampi didn't garlic lemon wine flavor pretty confused other shrimp butter noodles  mushroom risotto legit cheddar it  reminded packaged broccoli cheddar rice  Honestly everything somewhat packaged taste it  if talk deviled eggs let's just say sat table trying one   Halfway through meal middle age man looked manager came in  He seemed arrogant cocky other half both looked each other face of ohhhh all sense now   unfortunate people cut costs overcharged hopes successful  Other decent staff few good drinks sure place going them  someone else mentioned look forward new Boca Park establishment near future! <EOR> My Husband ate November 4th 2017  witnessed did tonight very shocked see many 5 star reviews  Husband frequently dined Gordon Biersch very sad see go  Every time would drive past Mixx always said try sometime enjoy going Tapas restaurants love area gave try  1st all Saturday night during dinner time  walk entire place completely empty  sat down table asked Husband if made wrong choice  He said let's just stay try did  waiting drinks seemed customers coming look menu walked out  male I'm guessing he manager seemed practically almost beg customers stay dine in  Then man I believe owner walks looking acting angry coked Tony Montana He seems angry something  He yelled because manager couldn't force people stay dine in  He storms towards bar chugs drink slams glass bar rudely says something bartender  Then he sit table towards back next cook  time few customers came dine  owner continuously gets yelling employees also cursing them front customers  Some staff would even talk back them roll eyes walking away him  sorry but think raising your voice cussing employees front customers extremely unprofessional  He's lucky kids weren't hear him  would just walked out  Then point he sitting next cook he started throwing POP ITS cook while he cooking  He then stood started throwing them across room threw them Manager waitress  couldn't believe watching  completely awkward  also awkward when he chose yell waitress just before she came table  FOOD food OKAY  Definitely worth prices  Some tapas burnt way over salted  just sad say glad shut down  shut down having running hot water long period time  Many other demerits added just enough permanently shut entire restaurant down  <EOR> My husband decided try place  usually cheesecake factory but thought would try them instead  walked 8 40 pm  bartender said closed  Instead helping because obviously hurting business  She told closed  walked boyfriend in  She making him  guess  more important building business  never return <EOR> By far worst food since moving Las Vegas  Aside poor service food sub par say least  Greek salad leaves we're old moldy strawberries old getting ready turn coconut shrimp raw  should add pregnant while eating well cooked seafood isn't bad itself having raw shrimp could serious consequences  translucent did refund shrimp insisted so but doesn't makeup experience    Overall lucky still doors open wouldn't sad see them closed permanently  Seems need little visit health inspectors  <EOR> My husband decided try place out  place looks great but experience great  extremely dissapointed reasons why 1 young lady serving table seemed if she brand new serving tables  theres anything wrong because all new job some point but made experience kind sour    2 She kept forgetting ordered did even bother explain menu worked until asked if she could help understand concept  Even she explained she made no sense still confused  Another server noticed still puzzled she came over table thoroughly explain process    3 When bowl bar whatever call very limited ingredients also ran some  Now unacceptable friday night place basically empty  should well stocked  servers actual bowl bar very quiet  did help pick some delicious sauces though  When finally down bowl bar preparing bowl cooked placed raw meat top all other ingredients  big no no  Yes know personal preference raw meat separate other ingredients even if its going cooked all together but should least asked if would preferred separate    4 When returned back table asked server if she could recommend any fruity sweet drinks  also asked jack coke rosé   She recommended two drinks coconut pineapple  time she actually talked drinks told coconut favorite good  love coconut when she raving great said ok lets that      big mistake  Both coconut drink pineapple drink extremely watered down  even hint coconut flavor drink pineapple drink also watered down  Now when she pour rosé glass only tablespoon rosé came out  She served bottle nearly empty she did even notice  She did return back new bottle served rest    5 sat down ate food she asked if wanted some dessert silly old asked if she recommendation again  Well she recommended cream puff citrus sauce mango sorbet  Let just say again disappointed  only good thing dessert mangos sorbet cream inside cream puff  rest good all    6 being extremely disappointed service received she comes table provides check  She walks away open check book  trying figure split bill between husband three guests she comes back table apologizes takes check book hand says she forgot charge bowls  all looked each other just couldn't believe all happening  Then she asked remember size bowls guys had?        really? weren't supposed know info? any she back charged bowls ordered gave correct receipt time     Had very disappointing service received would given them higher rating  say bowls appetizers very very good   chefs extremely nice  If rate place based food would given 4 star rating  5 because dessert sucked  I think concept place great place looks beautiful  think if would focus more properly training employees deliver better customer service place would great  think right now just focusing having beautiful looking people working there  return more time maybe month two see if any improvement  <EOR> Rather average also 80% plate just pasta trouble finding most he vegetables ordered other then potatoes  <EOR> We Mixx Grill tonight several friends made recommendation glad

Uh actually     sorry none those taps currently connected anything  only couple selections bottles moment  The first two appetizers tried order unavailable  server thought third choice probably but she ran off check did indeed some shrimp left  When arrived bland uninspired but edible   The core Mixx Grill concept seems de ethnicized teppanyaki setup pick some stuff off buffet grilled you  experience far neither felt attempting kind adventure both looked six pre configured entrees menu  companion's first two choices both unavailable  two six!  she settled bruschetta appetizer main  Again edible but bread didn't seem grilled much as   lightly warmed side? chose ahi tuna  literally never less flavorful  even tasty  piece ahi life  unadorned StarKist would better   Oh must also mention Lounge part name evening visited consisted pair completely generic crooners recorded backing volume made conversation nearly impossible bordered painful  <EOR> I wanted place but unfortunately fell short would recommend it   pleased see open looked would higher end  terms quality decor   Boca Park opinion could use restaurant higher end  plenty middle road options like Cheesecake Factory Kona Grill but nothing step that     To start off when first arrived heard saxophone player playing thought Oh cool must little live jazz band something    realized when sat down just guy saxophone standing corner playing along randomly radio   Inside plenty room where could put 3 piece jazz band if thats going for   came off awkward half assed guy saxophone standing corner playing random sax licks songs radio   jazz band don't jazz band but ya can't halfway     I ordered truffle fries filet mignon   truffle fries OK   better worse   filet mignon very mediocre  no better steak you'd find Cheesecake Factory   remember $30   same price maybe $5 more Echo Rig Tivoli Village right road filet mignon rivals $70 filet mignon might find higher end steakhouses strip   date ordered some chicken dish which again just OK   Overall just bit underwhelming   two bill $100   same money could Echo Rig literally 1 minute away Tivoli Village much better food ambiance   Mixx seems trying more hip slightly higher end restaurant but mind they've just fallen short   If place really great don't mind spending lot dinner  case left feeling shouldn't spent $100 dinner maybe should gone Kona Grill instead  <EOR> This third time am seeing consistent attention great service yummy food! While done build your own route very pleased last two times during happy hour find really easy just order off menu    The food great but its service really stands out  different server each time they've all wonderful  server last night Mariah incredibly attentive  friendly  food came lickity split drink refills arrived finished    There keyboardist singing jazz standards contemporary  love welcome kid even dog on patio course   only family owned non chain restaurant Boca Park well worth supporting  If Joshua Mariah servers treat right  <EOR> Got 4 00 need more help  table 8 people waitress also bartender told she's alone while fault but waiting 1 2 hr decided leave  Brios wow glad left!

Also drink complimented spoonful pop rocks add your drink just fun mouth frenzy instead  completely forgot candies fun throwback  drink itself very tasty really down easy very hot evening    Next came appetizer which lovely plate artisan cheeses served nuts fig jam brioche   fig jam light flavorful paired well all cheeses   The dinner concept remarkable choose sauce then earth veggies then land or ocean choice meat fish but your sauce choice really dictates meal  Once completed task choice waiting your server bring your entree' your table getting your table overseeing server collect prepare ingredients cooking  Just steps away where chef cooks your meal circular grill  friends opted stay table wait traditional serving meals  however am always different wanted enjoy total experience off went  chose lemon butter sauce Alaskan Cod fingerling potatoes zucchini cremini mushrooms  small buffet style serving bar watch server loads your bowl full chosen ingredients then walk bowl over chef cook  order small medium large portion food  all opted small order very happy since prices very reasonable  Once food cooked server brought dish over  Unfortunately bit salty tastes  am sure wrong but hard time finishing meal some disappointed  friends ordered shrimp scampi rib eye steak  both seemed enjoy meals but did rave them   The service hot cold   server started great but then time she would disappear large amounts time ask check twice  She trying though most likely trying find groove won't harsh  food runner pointe though  He always refilling water glasses clearing plates extremely attentive  wish would asked name could give kudos! Also gentleman approached table early explained whole dinner concept us  He really engaging helpful  He may owners but once again did name   Why only three stars?? restaurant brand new still working kinks  food good but great service needs improvement  competitive plaza terms dining options   plan return give them another try summer hope update review two stars  <EOR> Asked seat 3 adults 2 kids  She said let set table 5   she basically took table 4 grabbed chair put corner squeezed setting in  brought big copper drink no room anything  Forks falling  bread basket came  ordered 3 appetizers guess what    there no where put it  literally put stuff bench sitting in    The waitress slow  Took 20 minutes come drink order    There wasn't soul place yet crammed table 4   The area your vegetable protein bowl shit show  He run all way around give cook food  Why he closed side he needed on? already took long time food no wonder would if people here    We added new food already overcrowded table set 5 yet meant 4 children  put more food bench   Where hell waitress again? More crap falls off table  She doesn't care there's more people dressed cocktail waitress dresses versus people eating  would ordered more food drink yet she vanished    She finally comes tell look small surface space she's confused  why she never more waitress she can't even right  asked if 5 grown adults would seat them? She no clue asks bus boy walks up  He's adamant would same configuration he's proud answer lien he just won wants millionaire  bust bubble tell wrong he table should pushed this  size plates doesn't allow comfortable for crying loud plates food bench still no room  ask would happen if group 10? higher math can't figure deer headlights  The food good  The tables tiny obviously fear putting two tables together don't order appetizers  Don't order elixir the Cup itself takes whole place setting won't know do   Worst service ever <EOR> Tried Mixx first time amazing concept fun choose your meal chef cook it  Waitress friendly very helpful guiding through experience   You must try Alaskan Cod rice cauliflower  mushrooms cooking lemon butter! <EOR> The concept amazing but food kind awful  ended because Groupon  ordered bruschetta piece toast cut half smothered pesto large grilled cherry tomatoes  good but customary bruschetta  would expect least 2 pieces per person  ordered mixx bowls where pick your own items them cooked grill  O M G cross contamination place crazy  steak friend tofu he might well steak because same utensils used mixing  Two other patrons chicken again all food cooked being stirred same tongs  Additionally only little salt pepper added season food  imagine raw meats selected cook absolutely no flavor when done even Alfredo sauce asked top   I love concept completely  upscale chipotle but taste cross contamination definitely turn off  <EOR> All all just meh  Tapas undercooked drinks resembled nothing menu entree's anything but appetizing  won't surprised find restaurant Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares day  Save yourself time disappointment walk few steps over Cheesecake Factory instead  <EOR> Looks nice experience wasn't great  I around 8 45 restaurant probably half full  Despite being slow took 15 minutes someone come table ask if helped  Just slow kind confused service  think host sat section without server  being greeted placing drink order waited another 10 15 minutes until different gentlemen noticed hadn't helped since getting drinks  He very attentive rest evening  food good cocktails good  Maybe caught them off night  <EOR> Had Groupon    heard great things place  it Sunday lunch time  Only server service great  Food off grill disorganized didn't know food whose  Food definitely worth price  better Teriyaki madness if says anything  ordered crab cakes 2 small cakes appetizer which meh  $13 truffle fries  also ordered light grill bowl which $14  over cooked honestly looked unappetizing  two people bill $45   even Groupon wasn't worth all  <EOR> This such good concept  Pick carb veggie meat sauce  shrimp steak delicious! Good live music  Something enjoy patio while weather still nice  definitely back! <EOR> Skip breakfast  Waitress needed explained difference between sugar the white kind? Equal the blue kind? Sweet N Low the pink kind? 2nd time asked more sugar table  The place empty yet took over 30 minutes regular french toast bacon   Food overpriced under cooked  actually paid meal next door  <EOR> Now gaming establishment which kinda surprising  5 machines bar   I hadn't since opened headed investigate gaming situation   gaming flyer menu every machine which helpful appreciated  When place Gordon Biersch always said should gaming   They prestige being associated successful ventures mentioned Web site     Teresi's previous renowned ventures including Bradley Ogden Sugar Factory Gordon Ramsay Steak without hassles Strip  The restaurant huge entire back area empty while there  patio probably better area dining  overall space nice having cooking area open kinda cool   bar decent draft selection many bottles well  tropical Sam Adams bottle which excellent  bartender nice suggested cool drink come across Guinness coconut vodka! Bravo! <EOR> If could give no star would defiantly put that  But since forced least rate star guess leave that  deserve none all honest  embarrassing Summerlin let alone Las Vegas  Service full big air headed fools  Every place food beverage industry Las Vegas prides themselves based service  Great customer service all right? First off walking into place no hostess nor host  sat bartender noticed nice 6 minute wait just standing no notice some guests  Upon getting sat booths only other person along 4 dinner settings table  Server greeted iPad didn't even work all  much cocktail list   dining room HUGE yet there's other table more employees guests  Server snotty didn't even tell name didn't take other two settings off all few trips   ordered some apps off menu couldn't notice but calamari bland breading just smushy soggy full oil bottom pieces   bacon wrapped dates just disgusting    bacon burnt seemed made first left under heat lamp while cooking others  Last but least hummus store bought pretty sure some oil topped before sent out  Two raggedy carrot sticks some chips    nacho chips    never such poor hummus plate life  saddest yet easiest thing serve basic kitchen still couldn't deliver   those bland items barely touched actually kinda forced those way because tying order few other apps told might shrimp over over  ordered coke flat drank still but never refill within  hour for  decided try grill thing since wrong choosing your own items having cooked grill right? Well wrong again   couldn't notice but all meats all very old fresh all  tell just looking everything cheap just fresh  ahead did plate anyways because hungry  came dinner left plate chef cook sat back down  brought plate when done nastiest looking thing ever seen   straight slop   Super oily bland wife didn't even touch it  She felt sick apps looking stir fri made  tried few bites said just gross made want vomit  don't know if combination apps plus slop if just that  top whole evening off didn't air conditioning all  place Las Vegas does turn air? Along huge grill middle putting extra heat just nothing but sweat inside there  poor employees always wiping nasty sweaty foreheads over over serving guests  sit name another 50 things During massacre but rather just let them embarrass themselves  Also   guy suit manager server? never seen such unstable messes life such great yelp ratings  gotta say some paid guests straight McDonald's professionals putting 5 stars here! Does anyone else notice napkins stains them smell trash   place trash stay away!!! Close your doors your embarrassing just yourself but Las Vegas! <EOR>
