Hotpot put little everything there  very oily though but tasty  didn't many while black peppers everywhere way eating   I don't think come back  But happy tried it  <EOR> The rice noodle really really good!! best Yunnan places around California The ones San Jose area good    And also ???? could customize your choices everything  seafood also fresh flavorful spicy ingredients  spicy ?? great  <EOR> Love place  even know am eating but good  hot pot just pick meat veggie then give them and cook me  <EOR> Ordered to go food through Postmates  experience beginning end great   I craving some comfort food couple days eating burgers sandwiches  Found Yelp reading reviews looking through pictures mouth started watering    You can't order through UberEats but Postmates available 10% service fee + delivery fee  no menu Postmates place however worker super nice sent menu pictures 12 them! through IM order phone  MaoCai difficult order phone but somehow managed order  whole process didn't take more half hour food boiling hot when arrived   The Maocai ordered non spicy but still great other beef bit tough dry    The fish soup perfectly flavored spiciness ZiChuan pepper corns  fish fillet tender seasoned well   The Wonton fresh tasting comfy  soup bit salty but  okay   The shredded potato average  better ones however bad all   All all very impressed service really appreciate whoever took order patience  food superb however deserves five star being Vegas   Next time if am renting car consider stopping try other dishes especially more spicy ones  <EOR> Wow place awesome!  So did your own hot pot  noodle veggies beef fish balls more stuff  great variety think people here   The spice level grows pretty quick if 3 prepared  going 4 but lowered friend but turns 3 just right  Id say eat really  spicy Asian terms lol  The pot itself really big prepared ear lot people  Although friend able finish pot but  because eat lot lol  I thought bit pricey though because bill came $50 just pot itself  meat fish beef lamb meat balls weight lot because frozen would say  ice them   Overall pretty good  <EOR> Very tasty authentic food!!!  Fast service well   Will come back again next time vegas <EOR> I don't know if Yelp reviewers know anything hot pot but if doesn't come pot stove then hot pot  making your own style noodle soup basically    If light eater then would cost minimum $10 otherwise expect pay $20 it   All other stuff  menu  IMHO over priced      Waitress least nice except English good she doesn't really understand questions      Over all  overpriced  Could better food same price  <EOR> Damn!

Thank guys! <EOR> amazing !!!!! staff awesome food unforgettable !!! love it! sell hot sauce which must especially don't live Vegas can't all time   <EOR> They bit overwhelmed when party dozen folk walked through doors might want phone ahead give them notice if chance   At lunch time presented paper menu consisting 21 options   selected #1 Yunnan house special casserole rice noodle $9 99 since many items marked red spicy peppers indicating heat level dish   Turns four some beside ordered off menu which resulted being presented rather large basin filled hodgepodge meats veggies bathing spicy red broth   Another neighboring table own similarly sized dish minus red tinging broth   I looked longingly direction but when casserole finally arrived made little show its own each ingredient arrived separately plated tray but then quickly quickly take photo sad face dumped into ceramic eared dish resulting all good stuff hiding beneath noodles   most pretty flavorful dishes but more enough appetite served quite hot   Yunnan Tasty Garden located plazas making Chinatown Las Vegas   3 5 stars  <EOR> I am huge fan spicy foods friends delicious!!! salt pepper fried fish red oil wonton boy good! mouth waters am typing  also salt pepper friend chicken dan dan noodles which kind peanut sauce noodles  food came really fast 9 us service pretty good  much flavor everything   The only downside would put wayyy much star anise if bite into leaves really awkward feeling your mouth   lol    Overall can't wait come back Vegas try hot pot order whole menu    WARNING sure near bathroom all times especially following day if decide try spicy foods    totally worth it! Omg writing review want back Vegas <EOR> Very authentic!  family loves foods we'll definitely come back again! <EOR> All favorite Chinese restaurants never last  hope last    I haven't tried many dishes  But self serve hot pot pound worth it  only pick want eat charge pounds  meat $9 99 pound non meat $4 99 pound  put many things two bowls came less $15 both meat vegetable  love fact don't count bowl weight which means pay exactly get    The first time picked medium spicy broth perfect me  eat spicy life those don't eat spicy food regularly might need choose lesser spicy option  flavor broth reminds spicy broth Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot    The second time chose same medium spicy  But came little spicy me  ordered another set vegetables no spicy broth mixed them spicy balanced spicy level  thought non spicy going plain no flavor  surprise non spicy broth actually pretty tasty  didn't even need mix together  kind having both options   My advise all first timers  bowl meat spicy broth another bowl non spicy broth vegetables  Those two bowl rice enough feed 2 4 people    You notice broth very oily lot herbs might pleasant when accidentally eat it  But  normal   just traditional food made  oil important keep broth hot without stove  legend says long time ago lady Yunnan bring food husband worked far away home  But every time she arrived husband work place food became cold due cold weather Yunnan   she figured way keep broth hot without reheating which adding lot oil broth    So if don't something oily spicy  Then place might right place you  Which okay means more room sit  I feeling am going place every week  Especially during winter time     Spicy food  Checked  Flavor  Checked   Price  Checked  Ambiance  Checked  Location  Checked   Parking  Checked   Uniqueness  Checked   Customer service  Checked for Chinese restaurant standard Overall value  Checked checked checked    Yes Yelpers am fan  <EOR> The food okay but frankly service quite crappy shitty matter fact  seated seemed no wanted provide basic service such giving table utensils even water  call three times hesitantly waitress came sour expression face  Needless say don't care good food if service crap then place crap  gave two star reflect food but no mistake place doesn't any stars service  <EOR> I've tried Dan Dan noodles chili wonton over bridge noodles    The Dan Dan pretty good but second time noodles slightly soft overcooked    Chili wonton delicious garlicky but filling pretty minimal    Over bridge noodles tasted nothing should   The broth tasted more Chinese broccoli rich chicken broth    I know should taste because boyfriend family yunnan ate when visited  brought try noodles he called imposter version lol  <EOR> Recently visited again February 26 2015

kick it    Dan Dan Mien Have order item 3 10 visits  noodles served without soup peanuts minced meat peanut butter soy sauce  tradition Sichuan Dan Dan Mien which served chili oil but similar Taiwanese American style  Ma jiang mien which less soupy Sichuan counter part   Spicy chicken Mi Xian  Have order item 2 10 visits  traditional style Yunnan Mi Xian noodles served spicy chicken soup  soup base uses lot chili oil if spicy food suggest asking lower spice level   Beef Noodle Soup Order 1 10 times  confused Taiwanese style beef noodle soup people more familiar Yunnan style using more chili oil beef noodle soup base rather Taiwanese style which consistency soup thicker  more oily spicier   Mince Meat Mi Xian Forgot exact name menu but order 1 10 times  similar Chuan Rou Mi Xian where clear soup minced meat pickle radish served soup mi xian noodles  no spicy level great those don't want something very spicy but still traditional yummy   Self Serve Hot Pot Had 4 10 times
