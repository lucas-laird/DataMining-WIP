Compared CA locations far exceeds everything  also better deals  <EOR> Burnt toast served 20 min wait only 2 other customers  Also wait another 20 mins milkshake show receipt remind them ordered it  coming back  Very disappointed  <EOR> I am thrilled Vegas Farmer Boy's!  excellent food prices relatively reasonable staff friendly   Good quick service  <EOR> My boyfriend came first time ever because heard free Farmer's Burger 2 5 pm  only amazing deal considering $7 burger also delicious! breakfast sandwich they definitely won over all day breakfast menu! onion rings onion rings HUGE some best ever plus they're some cheapest seen anywhere! Honestly see few bad reviews but never having before very impressed plan coming back  very busy when due free burger offer yet staff all still friendly patient even owners being personable saying hello everyone came in  Everything burger tasted fresh great quality  would definitely recommend place if you've never tried it! <EOR> After being advised Farmer Boys decided visit  As entered appeared walked into Cracker Barrel esque restaurant complete curtains ceiling fans light fixtures  I ordered natural burger which comes nice bun cheese bacon chopped onions secret sauce which Russian Dressing concoction guacamole  Now TV looked good would assume hopefully would taste good  The result? Absolutely tasteless  Kudos friendly staff burger  should listened friend  <EOR> came because friend BOGO coupon burgers  deal ended being wash cuz buy 1 burger 2 drinks free burger  since getting go    really didn't need spend $4 2 sodas when could just spend $3 change second burger  would waste    anyway   ordered two burgers friends    country fried chicken bowl   other friend chicken club    my country fried chicken expected  chicken more breaded fried chicken fast food places use crispy chicken sandwich  think    carl's jr value chicken sandwich  rest bowl consisted hashbrowns   dry scrambled eggs trying hide beneath country gravy    luckily   friday bowls specials menu day  instead paying $6 19 just bowl   special $4 99 soda bowl  awesome deal!! but would order again   from could tell   burgers sandwich okay but nothing spectacular  dont think would come back own but if someone brought food wouldnt mind giving burgers chance    avoid bowls all costs!! <EOR> I've farmer boys numerous times first time location  pastrami which bit smaller expecting but tasty  would mention great service received packed place during lunch time  Manager staff prompt accurate order while keeping other dozens customers place  Also super friendly  Would recommend location over others staff  <EOR> I used pass Farmer Boys until day nothing else around today  Take chance! Good Eat! <EOR> Great expensive fast food    The food great for fast food price   staff friendly place clean  zucchini sticks really really good really hot  <EOR> Way expensive even coupon quality amount get  Okay burgers good fries  Definitely to  <EOR> Great burgers fries onion rings  zucchini sticks which delicious  calorie content listed menu know getting yourself into  burgers decently sized fresh seasoned nicely  <EOR> The hamburger fresh good but service bit slow   asked mustard ketchup instead thousand island bun sandwich saturated mustard   used 5 napkins sopping extra mustard sandwich pretty much over run mustard taste result   onion rings sweet pretty good   restaurant clean  should shown them mustard gotten new bun but taken long order hungry didn't bother it  <EOR> As far fast food really doesn't better place  Really great selection freshly made food  Burgers most touted items but think they're ok  fast food thinner patty restaurant quality toppings but always find burgers substantial bun  drive thru but prepared wait little your food  If decide eat they'll bring your food clean your plates too  nice touch but if you're feel need leave tip when people clean bring couple bucks leave table  felt super guilty first time ate no cash them  really different options have  burger chicken fingers fish breakfast salads soup homemade milkshakes  zucchini  I love friend zucchini  slices but big spears  cuts top your mouth but still order every time there  Everyone really cordial helpful  <EOR> The food good but consistently forget part your order  beyond annoying home all way back rest your order while hot food home gets cold soggy  <EOR> I generally put fast food into two categories sort upper lower class fast food   know elitist but think real difference between Carls Jr  McDonalds   Farmer Boys definitely int he upper category but does something else also   The food ordered counter then taken your table   food definitely made order but made quickly   fast food joint just really tasty food   Oh pretty huge price tag   The portions good food tasty but pay restaurant prices things   think burger $8 00 while super deluxe whopper run $5 going chain restaurant Applebee's Chili's $8 9   The decor sort tastefully tacky?  Kind Beverly Hillbillies vibe   There's lots simple country affect but chandeliers fancy faux french thrown in   thought hoot but laughing them them   I would definitely eat again food really tasty but wouldn't hitting them 3x week anything  <EOR> Quick Review burger pretty good nothing amazing but definitely better say Carl's Jr  Jack Box   quite n Out   Patty Melt delicious served rye bread grilled onions should be   fries average little soggy   actually really excited onion rings because picture look crispy flavorful   neither   Very bland breading all falling off quite soggy   would back try try some other items menu because quite selection non burger items look sound delicious   forgive them onion rings because should know almost never looks picture  <EOR> They classics breakfast fast food form  which love but burgers chili fried good too  just your typical breakfast burger sandwich joint I don't any spectacular news give but prepared spend a little more your usual fast food joint <EOR> Place nice   all it  Food wasn't great all  should've out  order extreme bacon burger combo kids burger !zucchini Boston clam chowder already pay $30!! expensive burger salty burnt  wonder survive being open  waited long time food ask server if waters kids she ask if want ice water said yes  last time saw her  Never came back water  guess what?!?

Very disappointed! busy all couldn't even cook patty without burning it! customer service location seems going down hill sadly isn't much area food wise business area   Extremely disappointing! <EOR> I'm digging fast food sit down hybrid concept although honestly felt more fast food me  Prices appropriate portions quality  real question good burgers?!  Farmer Burger $5 69 still Low carbing requested lettuce wrap not menu but no problems accomodating   meat itself thin patties very fast food think ones say n yummier bit cheaper  place can't n bacon avocado burger! Although avocados mashed did taste genuine avocados some guac processed mushy crap  bacon nice crisp better your typical fast food bacon  Honestly lettuce wrapped burger bit mess In n protein style thing DOWN PAT but overall tasty being able avocado burger  fast food place pretty sweet !   Their salads also looked awesome way better looking anything could MCD's Wendy's  Definitely back try Cobb salad 10 net carbs calling name!   Overall nice change usual fast food burgers  Avocado lovers rejoice ! <EOR> If you're traveling super hungry there's no restaurant around miles except Farmer Boys would place go  But if you're looking impressed fresh hot food along flavor aroma keep going!   Once inside place smelled stale cold french fries trash  service fine but food cold  boss loves place along but we're total opposites everything  Take advice though skip place keep going! <EOR> What surprise find burger chain different attitude! place serves friendly service great burgers all affordable price  If coming lunch please sure budget some extra time place packed   There certainly many choices when visiting place although burgers certainly favorite great selection salads wraps fish soups grilled chicken sandwiches sides etc  During last visit tried farmer's burger fries side ranch pleasantly surprised quality ingredients taste profile burger itself great burger presented plate  certainly cannot great meal homemade taste $10   I hope it! <EOR> You know first experience fantastic guess should written review then  would 5 stars  back twice since the  Dinner breakfast  Agreed kinda diner combined feeling fast food  give order number  Server brings your order  guess kind hit miss far food quality service Depends cooking guess Had high hopes breakfast meal  ordered Famers Omlet basically everything growing field dairy    Was failure  served barely warm huge chunks peppers onions stuffed hash browns cheese   got feeling cook no clue cook omlet  Brought attention duty mgr   got sorry  stated cook must backed other orders  that it  note don't think we'll back  <EOR> Love place! burgers fries wonderful! favorite part ranch dressing  service always great food always made order  would lunch everyday if could  also great daily specials  <EOR> Meat tough service good Bun nice  Nothing special  <EOR> 3 staying fairfield inn las vegas south quick easy ride over farmers   ordered two yelp special combos sunday special club sand which getting two because chiabatta each grown daughter ate half  good  really liked combos choose your side fries zuccini green salad onion rings   salad good choice ranch dressing tasty   also little cups jalapenos which put sand   those yellow peppers too  next soda machine   excited cherry coke sodas   Yes coke products!!!
