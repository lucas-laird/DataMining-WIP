This place clean really cheap   But definitely doesn't look changed any fixtures carpet etc since heyday when Elvis visited! Lots cigarette burns smelly hallways worn carpets  Good stay if just sleeping room clean sheets! but somewhere else if expect anything more that  <EOR> Of Vegas hotels stayed place ranks above only airport Travelodge only reason stayed TL someone stupidly scheduled meeting during CES  Think 1970's motel including pizza delivery flyers strewn hallway under your door  room clean decently large  all positives think of  Did mention tattoo parlor opposite front desk? discount included your fun pack when check in   It's clear improvements recent years but rather haphazard fashion Nascar theme area new and sparsely attended but rooms hotel area casino look haven't renovated 25 years  none typical amenities newer hotel motel flat screen TV coffee maker room safe   Beware annoying mandatory resort fee $6 day  object practice hidden surcharge discover when you've booked started checking should included room rate if mandatory  any event didn't see any resort certainly wouldn't paid cent use it  Maybe they'll start charging flushing fee next?  The location extreme north end strip none Vegas sights nearby  However monorail deuce doubledecker bus conveniently close  didn't ride monorail but appears limited stops lot faster but higher price  deuce modern doubledecker bus which runs between Downtown south end strip  24 hour ticket also good other bus lines if wanted away strip  Some major places LV Hilton convention center Hard Rock hotel off strip  Patience needed busy times however traffic hicks who've never ridden bus slow progress fast walk   In conclusion if you're looking cheap place stow your stuff take nap attend your hygiene while Vegas might give try but ain't Venetian  <EOR> I only walked through   But afraid   mean seriously afraid   Everything looks worn down tired   people just ones working floor but people staying there    middle nowhere unless count Hooker Emporium down road another hot attraction     I could see would work if just going sleeping eating drinking getting your Vegas experience somewhere else but then again might well put your cab bus monorail money into pot place  little more centrally located! <EOR> I did stay here  did however happen hit buffet last time vegas    DISGUSTING!

Great place play some cards losing your life savings bigger name casinos   come chill   Playing some cards free beer well $1 $2 tip waitress but still usually people just chiller tables   know its only few bucks lose every hand if mess up   know buddies blackjack noobie when she messed table couple times people didn't just leave yell her   explained she needed do   Anyway   said cheap cards   Chill people booze even better   Oh yeah dealers usually much chiller well!  More talkative other casinos' dealers  experience    <EOR> The buffet full mystery meat     I really can't complain under $10 buffet  under $10 coupon  nothing special but still better standard buffets outside Vegas    The hotel seems cool rides  far off Strip for ends Wynn would never consider staying even if $20 night gave chimp  <EOR> You truly pay casino    Rooms might 40 bucks night but theres reason   Rooms filthy stained smelly even offer dirty needle exchange customers here  should give idea your dealing here    I stayed 7 nights August bad experience first 5 minutes   Couldn't find bellboy help baggage couldn't even cart wheel stuff up  Ended taking 5 trips parking lot into lobby 23 floors down long hallway that air conditioned don't run AC any hallways floor 2      Last ride down elevator before left involved worst sound ever heard elevator  Started shaking squeaking life flashed before eyes  Thought gonna drop 10 floors    Room service always late rude overpriced    Free Lessons blackjack craps supposedly every morning around 11 tried craps lesson treated inconvenience   Poker room worst ever  dealers 70's oxygen tanks tables don't felt most popular game 1 2 limit hold em YAH!!!  Bottom line worth spending twice much money stay somewhere else  <EOR> The Sahara Hotel fun  Seriously   There's $1 black jack tables creepy Beatles tribute bands karaoke nights Cantab Lounge unflinchingly hilarious and depressing   Some rooms nice views mountains  praise ends there   Don't expect internet work try walk around alone  Once waited forty minutes elevators fixed    all while fire alarms blared old women continued fill penny slots without delay  If shower your room sounds going burst  know hot water working  Avoid buffet  steakhouse isn't bad   Have fun! <EOR> The Sahara Strip  LV hotel  Also monorail station downstairs which take down Strip any number OTHER cool hotels   I think always soft spot heart Sahara though  liked put your name television set welcoming your room  also liked made decent drinks casino    know free ones while gambling?  PLUS won over $500 day which pennies some people but novice LOTTA DOUGH!!! totally kvelling over winnings! mix people place too    young middle aged old     though many old people Plaza    My hubby sister friend mom new step dad all great time here! food restaurants wasn't bad either  breakfast buffet upstairs actually pretty darned cool even though cafeteria like setting  anything could ever want breakfast 'all eat' which why Vegas first place baby!  The Sahara bargain Strip hotel  recommend it! Just don't expect fancy shampoos soaps your room mints your pillow  least rooms didn't REEK ones Plaza  Go fun  Win some money! Just save some ME!!! <EOR> My husband decided check place because $1 blackjack  kept coming back because laid back atmosphere   This great place Vegas first timers  Relaxed completely non pretentious atmosphere  people both dealers patrons all pretty cool help if you're quite sure you're doing  fancy upscale but just fine little turned off more extravagent venues anyway   Drinks free when you're gambling might all casinos work  only casino played during week Vegas spent few hours almost every day playing blackjack roulette  <EOR> I learned play craps casino early 90's  Now yet another long line former Sin City joints sadly run course   RIP Sahara miss you  <EOR>
