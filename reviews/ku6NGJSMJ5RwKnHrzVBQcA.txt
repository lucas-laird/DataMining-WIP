When lived West Sahara used past place all time  used video poker bar looked intimidating into shut down while  saw them put dumpster several weeks guys picking place apart  Eventually put some new non lit signage  side note when golden Steer down strip mall decided recession bad enough try open lunches but  getting ahead review them  must focus huh?  There time nights g f would work would night off would walk around area dinner exploring  missed grand opening place but place looked inviting enough wandered night only few people bar  Inside looked clean well lit bar area  surprise couple bartenders as opposed bartender per every hundred customers someone setting DJ area another connecting dancefloor room    I beer checked plastic bar special promo cards fliers bar bartender told help myself  food setup behind where was  Dude FREE EATS  roasted garlic chicken veggies bread things  devoured roller!   The bartenders talking couple other end bar strategies winning something else  Damn appear getting Saget Ted HIMYM memory gap hate that  But thing always sure bar listening people's gambling strategies  listen them eventually something interesting comes despite fact 97% fluff exaggeration  all know if system worked wouldn't sitting little bar off strip  would only take actual gambling advice Phil Hellmuth Jean Scott yes woman met MGM found won lottery back home state 4 FOUR times  never told knew  She very odd behaviors before found out  Funny someone's quirks become eccentricities when find they're rich  porn star    So couple nails 4 kind confirming least competant level length play match stories let's say few rounds drinks given all around bar! All 5 us  Different mixed shots  wow  Because took 20's most 30's meaning all learn more 2 types alcohol night stomach would become bobsled race nobody wins  down thru goddamn fence    So 4 hours we're all pals telling stories crying each others shoulders FUCK love maan  Guys bipolar shotskis  decided last beer taper down merry  said goodbyes checked out  tab? 2 beers $6  paid more tip!   So basically buffet 6 drinks $15! woulda paid over $30 experience  magic Vegas  good long wlak some helped sobering pro cess  back many times after  while heard vid poker couple coming didn't see them again  bartender knew  sure   Good times roll! <EOR> Came friends some drinks food  amazing experience! read all other reviews little skeptical but came anyways! Perfect place gaming food drinks mention KARAOKE!!  Karaoke room huge!! Lots seating tables! Lights add ambiance! Just overall great  must go! Bartender fast personable! don't cowboys fan come good time  karaoke lounge room way would great private parties too!! <EOR> Great spot Dallas football games  Bar very small gaming limited The gaming comp lil tight bar honest  Separate room football viewing though always good crowd  serve food but bring food anywhere would like  several places plaza convenience including Capriotti's  All all ok place fun football chill ambience fireplaces large room off bar  Worth chance if never been  <EOR> Being EAGLES FANS going onto Red Label when Dallas playing EAGLES  must say  diehard Cowboys fans  But really nice  recommend everyone going there   Nice place hang watch football  Sorry guys lost  But EAGLES FANS VERY HAPPY <EOR> Nice club but smells very smokey nice older crowd!  only thing night only steppers!  People trying let them teach stepping!   Ummmm pay $50 00 per session!  into stepping youtube if want learn free! <EOR> I love here  Never ate single bit but locals funny bartenders cool easy  <EOR> Going other night may very possibly most fun nights ever had   Okay little dive bar nothing unique Vegas   But sign front made stop car throw reverse drive back see if read banner correctly Porn star karaoke   It's true!  Monday nights 10 00 porn stars call day jobs come rather cheery bar good vibe belt some tunes   everybody super nice   great bartenders hostess apparently over 26 000 films   point all boasting rights ever actor laid silent because am never going that   So initial call new wacky situations strong enough summon missus good friend sit drink cheap tasty drinks belt tunes alongside whole cadre adult film actors   sing   also flash more few boobs while singing if  also your thing then go   even play some crazy games which friend won prize   There may many highlights list but think personal favorites being able stun group porn stars into open mouthed wonder rendition Michael Jackson's Rock    thought singing Deep Your Love Bee Gees but  perhaps tacky obvious   But sense humor knows?  I've done lot karaoke lot bars but nothing this     would completely recommend Red Label Monday night must Vegas experience   hilarious quirky way much fun   I can't wait again      <EOR> So awful experience another nameless local Dallas Cowboy bar yelped them but deleted courtesy small biz ownership where completely ignored first timer never return again became little down because literally feenin local DCN fan base  Well say found Red Label  unwelcomed felt other spot experience complete opposite  If bleed Cowboy blue come thru! Great atmosphere w true dive bar feel accompanied true knowledgeable diehard fans! mention good friendly peeps too  Only reason don't 5stars no food served  However Caprioti's right next door bring food inside w no prob  All all know treat 1st timers won over already hospitality enthusiasm  nice place watch new era Cowboy football! <EOR> Hole wall reasonable beer drink prices killer authentic Thai menu   food real deal   Highly recommend  <EOR>
