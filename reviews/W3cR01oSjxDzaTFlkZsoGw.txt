So maybe some fault entering into food expedition but still say something   My first mistake  drawn pretty blue lights outside moth flame  food good right?  Second mistake  pull parking lot some hesitation sister says should look reviews? NAH! Let's just look menu   Third mistake look menu some confusion but already felt pot committed sit down   The restaurant best described having identity crisis decor food  food ranges Russian Soul Food Italian??? decor best described early 90s some fancy chandeliers child's play room????  The sides available BBQ dishes sense your run mill ribs bbq chicken brisket etc  but much more russian influenced side board  Some sides whited out obviously changed menu but which sides whited out varied menu menu  More confusion   The best thing ate french fries  Hand cut  fact ended pretty much being meal  mac cheese garlicky mushy good mashed potatoes much mac cheese    We making through meal minimal satisfaction when asked pay half way through because waitress closing bills evening  Let mention waitress!! Long story short possible may charged  twice meal because some miscommunication inadequacies part  promised cancelled first transaction but did present cancelled transaction receipt    Giving them card again may fourth mistake but yet determined    And another note don't take restaurant com don't fooled  <EOR> My first experience better now came back check can't say same  place still looks same but changed chefs again  would say time need change cook something if want business successful    I ordered baby back ribs comes two sides  ribs came half slab dry salty  mac cheese tasted ones microwave fried okra blah needs more seasoning   say banana bread pudding probably only thing worth coming for  But items caught eyes frychos which nachos french fries  sounds really yummy! prices think bit much since food isn't great  $20 99 baby back ribs two sides isn't even tasty    I don't think coming again if probably only going banana bread pudding if change cook better knows doing  <EOR> Do waste money here   worse excuse BBQ ever eaten   brisket very dry flavored well Mac Cheese looked boxed fried catfish wasn't deep fried but shallow panned fried told which looked just baked tasted undercooked   The atmosphere nice   waitress manager nice but owner ? snippy side when sent back raw tasting fish dried brisket wasn't edible  tried tell everyone wanted non deep fried fish now quit making everyone usually loves BBQ down list chef's credentials show wonderful he is     We warned ladies coming leaving horrible which manager started coughing   Coincidence?  think not   didn't ask but didn't offer take any portion meal off even though more half table couldn't eat it  <EOR> Boo! place major identity crisis going on  guessing changed ownership because definitely BBQ!! If want Mediterranean food it  Then take down expensive neon signage grabs passerbys  Shut off laser light show  Train your staff  <EOR> What when opening restaurant!  Future restaurateurs take notes exam    For short time Blue Fire BBQ open changes chefs well fairly significant turnover wait staff  first warning sign    The draw place pretty blue lights ornament bar sign food  Those shimmering aqua lights awkward setting once inside restaurant fine enough job distracting guests mediocre food service  ribs tough salty dry  side dishes left yearning Boston Market clearly flattering comparison  place empty both times once during lunch once Tuesday evening    This ill planned catastrophe hanging last rib  lover BBQ ecstatic when saw Blue Fire BBQ open up    Unfortunately good idea wrapped box pretty blue paper still just empty box  <EOR> I hate give publicity truly awful place but important let those living Las Vegas Blue Fire BBQ  beyond bad food lousy service  evening ended owner trying throw water table filled laptops other electronic equipment police being called intervene  According Ask com 2 374 restaurants Las Vegas  would recommend try other 2 373 restaurants before going Blue Fire BBQ  So let's start beginning  I am food writer food critic  write chef profiles restaurants cuisines beverages   If don't place just don't write it  thrilled when invited networking meeting Blue Fire BBQ  never place looked forward maybe discovering hidden treasure   I walked into very beautiful place deserted  mean single person place 6 45 p m  Wednesday night  saw banquet room filled people which where meeting being held walked in  This networking meeting wasn't planning eating full meal but planning buy appetizer drink  When waitress which found owner brought menus table filled three other writers asked if any food specials being offered attendees meeting  She immediately developed attitude some discussion found no food specials only drink specials  Then she stomped away asking anyone table if wanted order even took menu away writer getting ready order  Afterwards person table bar drink when she returned told owner nasty giving drink special price  all looked each other three bar drinks  wine $3 glass each gave $5  owner THREW money back other writers myself said she liked writer but two us   writer asked did he happened treat that   spoke said she didn't want ever return  She said right then started screaming insulted everyone started shaking fist us  walked back into meeting  We did let person organized meeting know she apologized profusely  evening continued presentation then chose leave early since hungry obviously welcomed  person knew walked along sister said almost bullied into buying food food terrible  also vowed never return  At networking meeting sponsors pay money display tables promote business  sponsor digital specialist company laptops other electronic equipment set explain do  other writers stayed behind let know later altercation between sponsor owner she picked glass water throw computers  Sara Gabriella  Creative Genius Finesse stated sponsors computer phone iPad dumped water  which she grabbed computer iPad threw them floor! partners given incident number police made report told could file charges file compensation damaged electronics  Truly most horrendous experience ever sincerely apologize any all guests subjected rude aggressive case violent behavior  Thank Debbie warning unsuspecting would be customers threat  interviewed many many restaurateurs chefs common denominator want people happy food service  Since 2 373 other restaurants Las Vegas patronize them instead  Don't patronize Blue Fire BBQ 4275 Durango Dr  Las Vegas NV 89147 <EOR> The place very pretty there's no doubt but horrible first experience    My friend decided try something new lunch when first opened morning 7 2 11   menu identity crisis going on  couldn't decide if Mediterranean BBQ American BBQ     Once finally picked burger back menu informed couldn't anything back just ordered cheese burger fries    The fries completely raw center  burger Kraft american cheese wasn't melted  pool grease plate  tomatoes quite ripe yet either  bun weird burn markings top sat close camp fire singed side  BBQ sauce KC Master piece or least tasted just it    I'm still confused play place next bar  Isn't illegal?
