The pho good but place would way down Chinatown for  <EOR> This officially favorite Pho restaurant ever  Love customer service food amazing  Great atmosphere overall  If could give more 5 stars really really would  <EOR> Ordered rare beef tendon pho egg noodle well spring rolls  Turns spring rolls just stuck pho  Food came quick   but incorrect  No egg noodles gave regular rice  Since hate sending food back just ate it  Noodles borderline mushy bean sprouts old broth little oily  favorite part pho broth very flavorful   much color which explains lack flavor  Also really skimp meat  think counted maybe three small pieces tendon same steak  Staff super friendly but better pho Kim long Saigon 8  <EOR> Food good but few mishaps  started eggrolls which came hot crispy  wanted chicken pho told ran chicken? Hmm 1130am? opted porkchop rice plate  Others ordered pho bowls shrimp stir fry rice plate   One plate came time roughly 3 5 mins between instead all together  pho bowl another pho bowl then rice plate  15 mins first dish came waitress informed friend only veggies bok Choy stir fry ok?

Coming LA place good send those post night drunchies  Totally worth it  <EOR> So trying new places area Pho kick    4 5 stars isn't bad let's try place    maybe should read more reviews hungry was    When entered 1hr before closing weren't greeted walked back find hostess nice enough but training knew absolutely nothing  Literally everything asked she no clue it    When hurried owner server told questions he answered them well enough but actually discouraged certain food though nasty thanks! HOWEVER don't know why just didn't say All left Pho because everything tried ordered wasn't available machine cook wasn't working  personally think already cleaned didn't want bother understandable but again just serve Pho certain time  At least think he owner he training hostess new waitress The pho broth definitely oilier hoped good taste but all oil ruins it  P13 Rare Steak noodles    meat wasn't excellent but horrible definitely needed extra Hoisin Sauce! But again eating Pho awhile now  amount oil broth made little nauseous didn't eat much hoped    place called Pho90 but should called Pho9  Very little chance give place another shot since DOZENS Pho restaurants even within walking distance we almost across street accident kind wish would made mistake! <EOR> I when just open but didn't leave review back then  visit again dinner thought post review would good since waitress nice us   Environment pretty causal place dine waitress very friendly  She answered question patiently gave good advices   Appetizer Chicken salad waitress recommended chicken salad ordered love it  seasoned well chicken tasted tender  little sweet!  Pho Beef stew pho soup life  literally drink all it  beef stew part happy tasted chewy rubbery dry stuck between teeth    Overall would come back again chicken salad  If could beef stew better would order again since soup amazing  <EOR> I ordered seafood pho best seafood pho restaurant   food came fast   waitress prompt   I'd come back when Las Vegas  <EOR> Very flavorful broth strong herbal kick  pho multiple countries many states place favorite broths   Another relatively unique item taro shake made real taro  Every other pho place uses just taro powder   Service great well although you're prly going pho joint service  late night hours top off! <EOR> Wowww pho good  I'd say better east coast pho general  Broth point plenty meat good portions  Thai iced tea good well spring rolls  find! Well deserving 5 stars  <EOR> What separates place all other Pho places town personable customer service is    Last night 4 hours driving home SoCal friends decided check new place because another place originally gone packed  surprise place turned amazing!   When comes Pho didn't find all exciting  But cares? ordered it  far tell bf inhaled must good  just Pho person   Their B1 Vermicelli hit spot! most places noodle veggie ration seems little off  place gave even ratio little more noodles! thankful since ordering noodle dish veggie dish! sauce little different tastier kick spicy  Though fan spicy definitely didn't mind it    The server Eric really comfortable around us  He didn't act robot server which kind understand if same thing over over again  liked he simple he checked us  over excessive  Just peaks over eye contact case needed something occasional  sound good eating  Anything else moment? question    What most place each every table plugs  almost invitation work while eat  sure if  going if people even Pho places but give option    Recommended! <EOR> The owner customer service AMAZING! She gave desert house because rarely made she saw boyfriend loving food  order pho the broth good spring roll amazing eggrolls  Tai tea definitely must would love come again  loved it <EOR> Find new spot grab beef banh mi    Normally Vietnamese places pho but ever since brisket banh mi back Anaheim looking Vegas! saw place carried beef version which great because normally most places only pork variety  don't eat pork aside spam musubi BBQ pulled pork sandwiches sorry can't resist     Back restaurant big booths along sides couple tables middle  only guy serving every table service slow  I'd rate 3 5    For banh mi I'd give bread alone 5 5! Soft inside nice crunch once bite into it  Inside sandwich you'll find few shreds carrot pickled radish some cucumbers beef cilantro  sandwich whole bad once added some fish sauce sriracha way better  However thing don't prefer use lard instead mayo spread bread maybe normal but just fan fatty mouthfeel ate around part  Maybe try order without spread next time  Overall place whenever crave banh mi  <EOR> Great waiter! Attentive considerate   Very top it! We large Pho 90 bowl huge bowl plenty even two very hungry people  Probably could feed 3  Spring rolls felt very fresh clean  The place modern quaint easy accessible bathrooms  7 regular sized tables two large table bigger parties  <EOR> Let start off saying place pretty good food  several different broths sandwich pho pretty great sandwich good but tasted better  Unfortunately place gave impression cannot handle big load customers which sad because place rather small  Getting inquired smoothies  told right off bat could order but would take them really really long time because backed up  ask limes 3 times span 15 min  Water refills nonexistent during stay  sandwich came 15 20 min Pho  All even full house 2 3 tables empty    Though food pretty good experience all ideal  I'd advise against place unless busy  <EOR> Horrible language barrier here  Ordered P4 came Tripe ewwwwww!! called server over he said English menu doesn't specify but supposedly Viet version does????? hell does sense?!? He couldn't even explain because English terrible  shrimp allergy point didn't want eat any other dishes ordered because hell know if there's shrimp In because menu unreliable point  Egg rolls whackkkkkk!
