Also someone told Fireside owned same people own Elixir green valley sunset which used all time when lived side town   Always drinks comped when played continuesly   waiting staff super friendly at Elixir    sure why Fireside different   food descent    only reason second time because friend feels local bar but if you're going drop few hundred plus entire valley your neighborhood bar only cheap cab ride away   Everywhere Las Vegas      Literally everywhere exception many places strip treat right when drop few bills   place     Awe full food just pay drinks if must but nothing special here! <EOR> Good Fish tacos fish chips burgers pizza lot good craft beer tap bottled  friendly staff  beer menu challenge read tv screen if eat bar area smoke little issue  But hey its bar  bars smoke  dinning room smoke free  <EOR> This place sucks!!!!

Why other bars accomplish task? Every staff member should given list asked remember give 5 stars immediately  Another reason most likely contributes knowing behind bar actually see bar    dark place granted  always bad thing but need put lights over your bar showcasing all liquor bottles sell stuff!  can't even see bartender disappear into the Abyss darkness   I come back place again because staff does pretty good job   Just please beer menu hang some lights over bartenders bring food prices down notch  FD  UPDATE 7 15 13  They've added draft list television over kitchen which helps see beers in    but isn't date usually   Still improvement which bumps then 4 Star range  <EOR> Great Turkey avocado burger made yummy cheesy Tator tots!
