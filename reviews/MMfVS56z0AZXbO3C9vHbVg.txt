Nice customer service but enough back even if $5 per pizza !! <EOR> Just ordered large regular pizza half pepperoni half cheese  seriously worst pizza ever  actually didn't even taste pizza  can't believe came Pizza Hut  would highly recommend ordering location  soggy greasy  Ugh! Gross!! <EOR> Beyond awful never once disappointed any other Pizza Hut  Disgusting  <EOR> Terrible service!!!!! Stay away! surprised bad reviews! Manager rude steal your money because area mistakes end!!!! Stay away!!!! <EOR> Since just choke slammed another Pizza Hut location through table review thought should give store shout out being opposite reviewed earlier   Every time ordered mobile app friend's house NW Las Vegas pizzas come hot fast   yet problem Pizza Hut location keep great work  <EOR> Because eat kind food everyday because live healthy lifestyle LOL because never seem use coupons online because don't know why but honor them when call over phone place order because there's Pizza Hut always great again seven half years over here <EOR> Just very poor experience store the manager no less    Needless say lost business   suggesting 20 pizzas year worthy loss eyes but support such poorly run store   Goodbye PH hello Papa John's  <EOR> Walked around 4pm employee walked right behind immediately asked if she could help me  Took order told pizza would ready 15 minutes less  13 minutes later pizza heading home  Excellent service returning when want another thin crispy pizza  <EOR> Locations reason chain restaurants such dubious reputation  several times last few years always problem order someone else's  service always slow whether location busy long take pizza? Somehow takes people half hour  least   The first sign place unreliable fact quote lengthy delivery times whether busy day not  75 minutes? bake two pizzas some wings bring them mile home? Forget it  easier place order pick up  should be  would if didn't lose orders routinely  only customer happen them seen other people wait extra 25 minutes when tried pick missing order   The pizzas lacking toppings  sure know skimp meats  hate say good things wings breadsticks but let them bright spot review   Oh offer some coupons your next order if issues during your pickup  But why would want come back?  If absolutely must Pizza Hut find another location  Best choice someplace else period  <EOR> You think would learn lesson  officially hate pizza hut  NEVER again    smh placed order 11 02 supposed 11 33 thats email said called spoke guy phone 11 45 very rude  told when ordered much longer he said he didn't know depends where live let know live 5 minutes away literally 5 minutes away very annoyed he said well don't know he should way  10 minutes later still no food called back speak manager course he says he manager asked corporate office number he acts if he doesn't know places hold  he gives number  12 05 hour order pizza door bell rings  No thank you  Smh  lived area years  Whoever new management suck <EOR> Horrible service slow delivery  Unless want wait around 45 minutes pizza highly suggest choose different location  ordered medium cheese sausage pizza yesterday didn't even receive any sauces requested    This very disappointing because live around 6 minutes location closest Pizza Hut nearby  would rather drive miles back Pizza Hut  Never again  <EOR> I extremely impressed recent improvements quality pizza hut rarely order pizza chain restaurants but wings pizza hut online see if any pizza deals while ordering wings  found large 2 topping pizza 7 99 took chance  pizza very good fresh impressed enough write review The wings always good although did raise price I wing Wednesday wings now  70cents apiece but guy behind counter explained wings now bigger true  cannot comment delivery picked mine myself  Very happy! thanks reading      <EOR> 2 stars because came before 1 hour estimated delivery time   0 stars quality temperature pizza when arrived   Oh wait minus star delivery drivers restrictions carrying packs parm pepper    if could minus more star knowing half half pizza would    guess should really know your getting coming but thought just might improved past couple years haven't eaten here   Wrong still suck big time! <EOR> I really wanted Tropical Smoothie but line door since they're pretty slow normally short time decided pop into empty Pizza Hut two doors down  BAD IDEA!
