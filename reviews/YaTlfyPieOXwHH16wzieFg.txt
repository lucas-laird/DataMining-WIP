No clean tables because people couldn't throw trash away left table! <EOR> Got 10 minutes before closing tonight plan carry but doors locked    When place says website doors close certain time should stay open until time   Guess maybe employees wanted cut early  <EOR> This favorite places eat but location  girl location messed order three times! Seriously just listen stop talking your coworkers! only two nice employees but but employee just completely idiotic! <EOR> Terrible service  soda always flat employees f attitude  Definitely wouldn't recommend spot anyone  waste  <EOR> Well updating last review  previously stated gave them 2 stars because food somewhat good  don't dealing depressed people inside decided moving forward would place order online pick up   When arrived few minutes pick time told sorry your order ready faster if stand line  faster if stand line when order 45minutes?! told would additional 20 minutes order but could magically faster if stood line 10 min before ordering exact same thing receipt front them  No sense coming back  tried time time again every time gets worse  last trip place point life came weekly  long cafe rio  <EOR> My question where management!?! live close Mexican food  only thing consistent shitty service  guys busy ALL time when service sucks? If didn't close crave giant burritos we'd never come back again! Imagine busy you'd if actually hired people could handle more order!   I just waited 20 minutes two burritos wasn't because swamped  closer scoops sour cream couldn't keep orders straight cashier busy restocking cups while stood twiddling thumbs    Something's wrong really hope fix it  wonder shenanigans going like proper vegetable washing glove wearing etc don't see      <EOR> This location just plain awful!  I've other cafe rio locations before wait maybe 15 20mins which although ideal something deal without crying spoiled baby  thing can't deal longer wait time which location closer 30mins gotten rides Disneyland quicker but careless attitude staff preparation food clear day feckless attitude towards customers which includes talking other staff members inappropriate behavior participated previous night apparent lack any leadership    Might add am no way prudish myself enjoy inappropriate behavior but while work keep myself wait till patrons could take offense far earshot    I returning location   I doubt even any other locations   There clearly lack giving fuck whomever manages particular location but more lay blame corporate end business must indeed good because seem completely fine losing customers  <EOR> Let start saying love cafe rio however just left am sure return location   girl working first station taking your order messed mine which didn't realize until very end quesadilla v  Kids quesadilla she basically slopping sauces meat around other orders saw make  Also gloves dripping sauces but she still didn't change them instead shook hand then wiped them dirty looking towel kept handling other people's meat cheese tortilla  line extremely slow sure person working even knowledge supposed tortilla soup  checkout cashier said they'd remake quesadilla which fine but then brought container piece meat hanging lid juice dripping down side  Very disappointing  <EOR> The girls some most unfriendly awkward people ever  Food good though  Don't expect good customer service though  <EOR> Let just say 4 stars pork barbacoa  amazing  service other hand great  employees just rude don't even offer smile really want back  pretty Skimpy meat  Oh sour cream guacamole offer free don't fall it  definitely back pork but might try another location! <EOR> First Let say love Café Rio!

Even turning down snob dial plus being excited vegan beans rice taste just off me   Granted dining area large queue fast prices fair but everything heavy processed taste   By everything mean beans cheese rice burrito pair cheese enchiladas  burrito 2 3 left unfinished mass funky beans very little else going on  The advertised peppers onions whatnot just floppy sprinkle side  cheese rice almost non existent  sure didn't taste advertised cotija  enchiladas better but less offensive doesn't equal good  Disappointing probably being swayed idea Cafe Rio more actual experience even give two stars  Yes menu more varied Del Taco Taco Bell but taste almost same    good day  <EOR> This location far worst service  Everytime food all spilling over into other bins looks unsanitary service just awful  only convenience where but tonight walk before ordering  waited 10 minutes watched all employees laugh hang OWN FREE food then when asked if could order said no because busy  never seen such unprofessionalism such large franchise  sucks because cafe rio but food service quality embarrassing name  recommend manager someone higher come anonymously experience first hand horrible job staff location does  <EOR> SLOWEST LINE EVER  Stood line 20 minutes managed move through 4 people  line ridiculously long but only 2 tables seated eating  Ended giving going next door  <EOR> The chips sals amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The cleanliness place par  staff usually miserable grumpy  They're ALWAYS rush    take time ordering  hate feeling rushed! staff obviously issues each other  cashier telling dish washers cut some veggies up  Dishwasher responded job description   cashier visibly irritated  mean c'mon    very slightest ounce professionalism such long way  need together  <EOR> I drive way 10 miles Southeastern location rather Cafe Rio  slowest service portions seem smaller well  Please open another location area preferably Southern Highlands  think all around service customer satisfaction would improve way  <EOR> Absolutely bewildered high ratings places across valley  Wife decided pick some food Blue Diamond location because new favourite quick honest Mexican fare Phat Phranks closed weekends   As watched them build burritos heart sank knew wasn't going pleasant experience  meat wet beans swimming goo tortillas split wetness wrapped it  wife's bean cheese burrito even worse 48 5% rice 48 5% wet beans 1% tiny sprinkle cheese   When eat meals burritos predictably soggy vaguely unpleasant tasting  revolting beans  generally yucky  found just edible would rate place 1 half stars overall rounding down because bit overpriced just didn't enjoy taste  <EOR> Don't understand poor reviews! burrito enchilada style medium sauce fantastic! service limited basically tell staff put your order   thats it   a lot times people can't minds   I frustrated people line normally always long if don't know want should wait line until ready! Proper etiquette taught people     Also people human little forgiveness workers   this hectic environment employees great job   all reviews bashing them over little stupid things doesn't sense     This better cafe rio locations to!  I recommend place everyone never cafe rio always leave saying right ! won't disappointed coming here! <EOR> This place sucks  Staff rude food taste processed fake  no vegetarian options sautéed veggies anything   Their food looks sitting days nothing looks appetizing  <EOR> Awesome work tortillas but      Everything salty almost burned  worst thing verde sauce  called medium  unnaturally sweet?  what? unnaturally sweet mean sugar added sauce  Weird good    Guac good  Pico good   Everything else tried well just OK  <EOR> Great food always fast always clean Blue Diamond location  love fresh warm chips queso giant chicken burrito's  wife loves chicken tostada  The kids watch them roll freshly tortillas right front you  We also enjoyed catering several times team meetings  <EOR> Order online! place always busy happy walk sign receipt back home  Everything made correctly great flavor     this def new quick fix dinner when dont' feel cooking  <EOR> My co worker took food delicious   shared pork burrito medium sauce enchilada style really big queso chips  queso really good   Would definitely come back again  <EOR> No wonder 2 1 2 stars  It's prepped Chipotle Chronic Taco any other pre made food Panda   I can't understand why takes 30 minutes serve barely 10 people line   Then throw away orders ?  Cashier says made fresh ? made fresh when sitting bin ?  Then pick salad bin refill salad  using same gloves he supposedly should using thongs ?  We shall see health department finds  <EOR> This rating should 5 stars unfortunately over past year since opened slowly watched service down drain food gets five stars but people making star  only person seems always ball cashier  prepared explain multiple times want your meal then watch them sure right  Also if order taco special asked multiple times many tacos want menu options taco meal two taco meal    but when ask guy behind counter many comes he said many wanted refused give correct answer even insisting know many meal CAME with  asked three separate visits same guy see if he give right answer always same answer  Its good thing food drinks great because pain supervise your own order being made! <EOR> Ok Cafe Rio very disappointed you   I eat least used eat Cafe Rio 1 3 times per week   I agree some other reviews regarding customer service but always ignored because generally food correctly  Plus food good portions huge   Well recently took break dairy which very sad but is   Considering usually order grilled chicken tostada creamy Ranch type dressing pretty nervous wouldn't taste same without dairy  friend recommended avocado instead sour cream  Great idea right?  So order salad no rice no cheese no sour cream no dressing  Oh wait sub avocado sour cream?  Counter guy doesn't answer just puts bowl  Ok  Great   I checkout cashier tells $  95 add guacamole  ask even though didn't cheese sour cream dressing? She doesn't reply just adds extra total    Normally may said something but tired having argue complain receive appropriate customer service   I think give normal Cafe Rio another try on Eastern but if same treatment may just over place  Obviously don't care business   It's frustrating because amount guacamole receive paltry  mean dollar should least full scoop   I used rave place anyone would listen but now take business place accommodate dietary restrictions  <EOR> Always wonderful! Friendly staff great fresh food  noisy side thought but expect family friendly resturaunt? food consistant every location which plus well  Never bad meal  Tamala Thursday amazing! am huge fan pork barbacoa but think love hate type thing  love thier fire grilled chicken highly suggest it  house dressing salads amazing!

Inconsistent food quality  come quite often given convenient location Cafe Rio admittedly quick easy food especially when want burrito  Sometimes rice undercooked weirdly hard  Sometimes meat seems overcooked difficult chew  Sometimes person puts boat load cheese other times barely enough   Other much note  Overall pretty big storefront lots seating space  during prime lunch dinner times pretty busy but staff usually friendly move line quickly wait never long    So yeah basically haven't issue Cafe Rio otherwise inconsistent food quality  <EOR> Wow burritos taste great! Over all fun atmosphere  Place colorful clean  <EOR> I've tried tried tried give location chance every time place phone order epic fail   Sure wait 20 minute line they'll order right but many times crunched time call in   Once sharp chicken bone shredded chicken salad ordered   always give wrong dressing add beans order when specifically ask left out   also prefer shredded lettuce only if stand line put order in   understand busy but just unacceptable customer service happen over over again   even contacted corporate issues addressed   unfortunate because food good but totally over giving them another chance  <EOR> Cafe rio delicious food  tried half menu disappointed taste anything  However today 630pm super busy  never seen that  waiting 25 mins line managed loose burrito  wait another burrito made  But non less love food  Could away some sloppy workers tonight dropping food all over smile face  <EOR> GREAT food  AWFUL service    They almost always never certain meats barbacoa  when disappointed when they're lacking staff feel YOUR fault having it  very unapologetic  Unfriendly staff but great food  Also tonight didn't lids fit cups!

Because sign says 11 11  worked retail before if customers standing outside building opened early if right time  don't keep paying customers waiting just bad business  should ready open right when supposed to    Then asked if any more Cholula because none shelf cashier just immediately answered no without even looking  asked Tapatia  Again immediate no  pointed bottle Tapatia saw sitting behind counter  Oh must last one! Oh thanks going through much trouble your job   Oh don't even bother attempting order extra taco  tried ordering extra shrimp taco once because order comes two swear asked then perform unspeakable  told then would pay price single taco You order two just obviously combine price  know expensive  just want three tacos! kid taking order still consult two other people before would three    I love steak shrimp tacos crave creamy cilantro dressing  If customer service better would given better rating  <EOR> Love place food!  does stressful however when you're ordering because seems pushing along very quickly but all worth it   Large portions loved everything tried although pork little sweet taste  <EOR> I've never big fan Café Rio but given convenient location online ordering decided pick some quick dinner last week    We placed order left pick time scheduled  arrived restaurant food wasn't ready yet  weren't huge hurry but seem little disorganized location  took several people handle checkout when said mom's bowl wasn't ready because chicken still cooking would take another 15 minutes offered different protein  Since didn't want rest food sitting while waited grilled chicken she changed shredded chicken  only decided did realize hadn't even made rest food yet really no need change order    The food ok but don't see myself going way return location better non chain restaurants area I'd rather give money to  <EOR> If allowed sub group reviews different fare I'd give anything pork barbacoa five stars anything but fish tacos least four stars fish tacos although trumpeted special day really wasn't all special   But let's back Pork Barbecoa which sounds comic book Swine Pirate but really tasty filling way spend your lunch dinner  come often tried other items but PB return for   Plus neices love display happiness when order extra meat  <EOR>
