SECONDLY Mingo let Found Events throw brunch party! flyer DJ lineup it  parties tend little louder normal restaurant background music because thats why pretty much everyone there   So aside little hiccup food service excellent would definitely say worth checking out  DJ most Saturdays if don't want around live music would advise coming different day  <EOR> I fan Mingo Kitchen especially many better options cheaper just few minutes walk further road   came during First Friday central location Arts District expecting great artsy vibe bar   good music ambience right but wait staff took forever serve cocktail selection awful     First off few cocktails $10 which fair Las Vegas but low quality only offer 3 low alcohol options   Then top low selection serve plastic cup   If order cocktail expect nice glass prepared PBR beer pong cup   Next charge $12 drink though explicitly said $10 menu   tell waiter he reluctantly changes price $10   But now taxed cocktail when first didn't   does work?  place seems they're trying scam people prices   know First Friday all people maybe little blitzed but some customer service selection expected nice bar   take business elsewhere nice drink downtown  <EOR> A bit pricier side Mexican food charge $4 chips salsa  Most entrees la carte but portions pretty good  Some dishes better others  Mexican risotto  very creamy cheesy addition corns gives nice texture  chicken enchiladas alright  brisket tamales sweet taste I'd say pass one  friend swears shrimp tamales I'd give try next time  other side menu offers classic American food  Overall decent option lunch when you're downtown area  I'd sit inside check modern hipster ish decor quite dimmed ambiance  Easy access plenty parking  <EOR> Kept hearing great things mingo boyfriend downtown decided try out  more expected! sat outside gorgeous day eat patio seating have  ordered mini cheeseburgers fries mac n cheese server suggested try Brussels sprouts  Hands down best Brussels sprouts forever! must try there! burgers perfect came some sauce mostly used fries which amazing well  huge mac cheese fan but wasn't overly impressed theirs but still pretty good    They didn't fish order time couldn't try any seafood dishes which hear good  maybe next time  happy hour menu great definitely enjoyed experience!  server great left full happy still money left over show!
