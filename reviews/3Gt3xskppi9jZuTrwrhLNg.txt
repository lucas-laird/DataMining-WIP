I highly recommend restaurant bar Mirage! <EOR> I'm ashamed admit but walked place few years ago while vacation friend    hence no longer friends   She originally picked place based martini she wanted menu   sat down said no longer made particular martini some reason $50 steak said we'd dinner no longer she wanted dinner   told tell server leaving   she just didn't want eat there   Since then wanted back because always GOOD meal final night while visiting Vegas every year   Fast forward 2014 last week specific   already told friends previous experience eating down whatever   don't know Stack compares other higher end restaurants Mirage but determined eat regardless   For starters super impressed wine drink dessert menu ipad   fancy schmancy!  Being last night Vegas figured split payment cash charge meal asked if could separate checks   must asked waiter many questions because he kept cool though sensed getting bit annoying   I did compensate tip larger 20% portion bill   I ordered petite filet adult tater tots glass cab   YUM O!!!! all amazing!!!

Then when contacted customer service see if would reimburse dry cleaning expenses had cleaned three times stain out no response  top all hosting big expensive dinner event nothing pre arranged restaurant came into fruition  other words dropped ball or pasta again again    In terms food okay good but mostly mediocre given quality prices  best items cheesy buttery ones doesn't taste good lots cheese butter?

Sure would anything different? Yes would seafood stack appetizer stay away small bites appetizers since definitely pay bills those  <EOR> 3 5 stars exactly would give place   basically Fix Bellagio smaller menu   Its fine which pretty looking suped bar food   opted split wings tuna tacos surf turf which plenty   place good drinks group but would much rather Fix  <EOR> We work quick meal  While did reservation 8pm didn't seated until 8 30 which bit frustrating  Other food good service quick  ordered mac cheese table brie bacon tater tots   the mac cheese but tater tots bit tasteless  salad hamburger dinner  salad mainly lettuce but hamburger very good!

Scott waiter steered right direction! Salad steak dessert     We ordered off theatre dinner menu! he suggested signature drink berrylicious! good! Can't wait come back! Kudos SCOTT     <EOR> Very nice restaurant inside Mirage Casino  Noise level much loud restaurant class   Started Seafood Stack small portions but great quality oysters shrimp lobster lacking   King Crab highlight Stack   My wife opted Hot Rock thinly sliced sirloin entree she wasn't hungry   She asked waiter said portion 4 ounces but apparently he wasn't informed properly no sense volume weight   portion 4 paper thin slices beef total weight MAYBE once   But nicely presented   Other entrees ordered Scallops saffron grits crispy pancetta green onion oil Seabass lobster risotto shellfish broth    Both excellent!  Four scallops served over minimal smear saffron grits   Two scallops dish served scallops perfectly seared while scallops second dish lacked proper sear   Seabass perfect through risotto perfect match   Overall great meal but price only justifiable Vegas would 25% less elsewhere   Service OK but par price point restaurant  <EOR> wowwww!!

Ridiculous  I literally batted eyelashes girl guessed cocktail server Neither servers suggested wines steak lamb Didn't where seated next server's station clanking silverware drawers    this added noise   If ever come again would probably just want stick bar area where full menu served     This definitely good groups   date much unless text another your conversation     *One people party 3 asked steak prepared   loud used sign language answer 'M' 'R'  <EOR> Energetic bar pub style fare very high refinement scale  Even though decor very far typical pub nice wood panels stacks wood hence name menu deliberately dominated pub like items buffalo wings onion rings pigs blanket  Sharing encouraged  also offer steaks other hearty main courses   They original appetizer called Hot Rock which carpaccio style piece seasoned oiled beef which patron cooks err    hot rock  Great taste original  However chef should really reconsider practice serving Heinz ketchup yellow mustard along finger food  least home made laternatives should proposed  Wine list decent  <EOR> Love food!!  taste buds crave amazing flavors until fix!

Great atmosphere concept  Burgers delicious! <EOR> The food ambiance Stack great however where excel food lack service  3 star rating based purely food    When seated took server bit time greet us  When she approached table she seemed lilttle overwhelmed  quick introduction herself partner  ordered drinks took while friends weren't drinking only soda seemed take while well  Once ordered apps meals didn't see server while  wanted another round drinks but since never saw weren't able order second round  She didn't even deliver entrees partner along which another gentlemen  When boyfriend received steak he commented large was  partner I wish remembered name stated people usually don't expect big is  few minutes later server approached tabled asked boyfriend if he wanted steak single 2 people  Before he could answer she stated she forgot ask  found bit odd  boyfriend said he ordered dry rubbed steak she immediately knew single but wasn't she entered order  She simply shrugged shoulders walked away    When received check charged steak 2   boyfriend didn't want big deal he ahead just paid bill   partner came run card friend going say something but ended stopping mid sentence  partner noticed some awkwardness stated he knew debating said he would fix it  He clearly read cues responded quickly  He ended bringing check back without charging boyfriends steak apologized inconvenience mistake took place  thought bit much but he insisted  floored customer service mistake he didn't cause  signing check female server came back said she going fix check  When stated partner already taken initiative fix check she stated he didn't know he doing  didn't know going on  She removed check presenter back charge steak  Basically threw partner under bus    Let clear didn't care pay steak but customer service aspect server frustrating  partner wonderful but she just seemed busy overwhelmed hostess should probably stopped seating her  still tipped 20% but only ensure partner would fair cut  initial mistake she never once apologized nor seemed care she made mistake failed provide great service  <EOR> The food absolutely amazing!!

Apparently ask bread they don't bring even dinner many restaurants do   right opened dinner service great  lettuce wraps appetizer small portion but very tasty! sea bass lobster risotto dinner friend lamb   both agreed food best strip   the food just melts your mouth! definitely going back next time  <EOR> Why why why must restaurants strip disappoint so?  The skinny Menu very limited food overpriced service bad    the only positive thing restaurant pretty  there's DJ?   The food Shared Hot Rocks which sounded looked way cooler dish ended being  trying cool version KBBQ where cook your own sliver beef lava rock?
