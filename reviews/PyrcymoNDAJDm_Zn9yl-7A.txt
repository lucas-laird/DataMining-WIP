Hell don't know but good  <EOR> We saw place driving decided check based review desire some German food dinner    The restaurant quaint around 15 tables some high tops small bar front    tables nothing fancy but decor fits perfect name because definitely gives cafe vibe red table cloth German decorations adorning walls   There's small display case front well shows some delicious strudel more later    TV which appears cable box but being used showcase different dishes while there   While live accordion music playing sprinkling Christmas decorations including tree   live music thought would bit overpowering space but turned just right noise level overpower conversation     The menu just looking various schnitzels sausages traditional sides   also decent offering German beer which served proper glass beer style i hefeweizen    Jaeger schnitzel wife sauerbraten both spaetzle   also split side potato salad   schnitzel pork crispy without being greasy mushroom gravy delicious   spaetzle good side made even better gravy mixed in   beef saurbraten very tender sauce very tasty good mushroom gravy but close second   potato salad more mustard base used my family german potato salad more vinegar based served warm but nice flavor just same   The staff very friendly sat relatively quickly order timely fashion considering all tables save high top occupied 2 servers   food came pretty fast well kept tabs drinks too   I 10% discount which forgot apply bill but happily provided  free plate apple strudel trade which happily accepted    strudel served warm some whipped cream creamy sauce well   cherry blackberry well which sure just tasty     the only thing could better iced tea   sure if specific kind just off batch but pretty watered down   Given all other pluses we'll certainly again find out     ich bin ein berliner!! <EOR> 5 5 Service We 2 people service both way  shared meal played meal half before serving  Water constantly refilled more then welcoming answering questions   4 5 Food Food good want come back again try more entrees <EOR> Stopped family over holidays   Jaeger schnitzel delicious!  Everyone family super pleased ordered says ton coming usually picky bunch! <EOR> Cafe Berlin authentic German food  rarity Las Vegas worth supporting  need more places focus getting cuisine right  Come hearty satisfying meal might find any  German household  good thing  Jaeger Schnitzel excellent found myself scraping every last bit sauce side spatzle  back! <EOR> Came try monthly buffet decided place mediocre best   This place way over rated! average nearly 5 stars beyond because would come back especially prices they're charging! $22 99 dinner buffet ridiculous when walk see hole wall joint tiny spread 7 8 items buffet most those items being sides such sauerkraut red cabbage mashed potates spaetzle etc  Don't wrong liked sides but just wish more entree type items instead just 4 assorted sausages schnitzel roasted chicken some hamburger patty looking thing    The dessert spread also joke most being stale looking worse Hostess packaged snacks   why wasn't any Black Forest cake strudel? why does German buffet serve stale cupcakes cookies? buffet includes soft drink but if want beer cost extra  If want pretzel real dessert such strudel you'll pay extra too  where does $22 99 paying buffet go?   The staff nice kept coming check refill drinks  little confused when arrived because couldn't figure reservation eventually figured some reason crossed off list even though reserved tag name cleared set table  Reservations recommended any given time because place tiny some reason gets very packed   I wouldn't say expert when comes German food but definitely some way better places cheaper pricing too  aren't many German joints Vegas but I'd say favorites anywhere still Hoffbrauhaus which surprisingly cheaper place! Yeah doesn't sense either   I'd say skip place save your money! <EOR> I loved it   wanting try place reading reviews am always hunt good German food   Friends lunch disappointed   Zigeuner schnitzel regular schnitzels   asked mine spaetzle which problem   found mine very flavorful tasty bell pepper sauce large pieces pepper it   also very happy   Apple streudel dessert also tasty seemed homemade which confirmed   Overall place little spartan inside but tell starting only imagine place getting better more refined time if successful   Plenty other tasty things menu try later such jaegerschnitzel currywurst variety other sausages such     The $10 off yelp coupon only made even sweeter   3 lunches 2 streudels iced tea tax  $23 + $10 cost yelp coupon   Definitely better german meals town  <EOR> I yesterday daughter simply best  place quaint vey well decorated stylish love bar area food delicious amazing homemade tasted German meaning say really typical stayed true provenance service great! waitress paying attention everything doing glare Window she asked if glare bothered she could lower shades      Waiters waitresses going way rare    overall?
