Dry sawdust overdone due being reheated  When told waitress she said want ? bit denial being reheated last night's unused meats I asked manager she said let cooks know this!!

Located inside Sam's Town LV place delicious! Service helpful courteous  appetizer never seen freshly made pork rinds add awesome! Must try! Gumbo soup great! All bbq food great cooked perfectly great flavor  Dish win Blackened Salmon!! flavorful delicious! Give place try awesome! <EOR> This first time son tried place out  love barbecue Famous Daves figured would try place since its open few months  things liked 1  servings huge see pics 2  Service relatively quick Saturday afternoon opened 4 00 pm 3  Hush puppies some best seasoned ever tasted definitely recommend those french fries  4  Pricing average meal came $65 00 good portion food  5  Shrimp appetizers brisket quesadillas very good recommend those well   The rest food seasoned liking instance sweet water corn bread sweet all  But if barbecue definitely worth trying  <EOR> My wife looking forward eating here  31st anniversary  wait staff very good  waiter promptly greeted took drink orders  He offered suggestions food items  During meal he checked back regularly sure needed  biggest disappointment food itself  both ordered two meat platters  wife ribs chicken ribs brisket  wife's meal arrived cold which odd since arrived less 5 minutes time order taken  ribs though smoke flavor very little meat tough tender  chicken overly dry lacked flavor  side fries cold  platter ribs same  1 3 brisket plate fat  love brisket but no means expected  side baked beans platter comes very small cup  Each platter also come cornbread lacking flavor  Since don't eat just service would say based food received won't going back Big Mess BBQ unless told made positive changes  <EOR> I can't believe lived near almost year hadn't tried it   First off Roy best server ever  He attentive above beyond ensure great experience    I ordered Sweet Tea point he asked if would also liked try Peach Tea  He also very knowledgeable menu  ordered BBQ Brisket sandwiches he recommended them sauce side could control much sauce put them  Little details much appreciated!  The sandwiches reasonably priced $10 brisket incredibly tender  lot too  actually take some sandwiches eat it sandwiches big fit into mouths otherwise   I definitely back future can't recommend place enough! <EOR> My wife Saturday evening busy  arrived same time elderly man walker  He sat hostess but took 2 minutes return seat she sat near back restaurant  Did he request furthest away seat entrance did she intentionally? knows   We sat right entrance only other occupied tables nearby group 6 8 couple  couple chit chatting waitress group 6 8 being helped someone else  Nobody came drinks first three minutes seated continually tried eye contact servers area   Our table turned served waitress chatting nearby couple  name Iris  She saw being seated she saw sitting but she kept chatting  would only worse here  When Iris did come over she asked if ready  haven't even ordered drinks yet she's pushing order food! wife ordered margarita asked water   I also asked Iris some items menu  First there's believe called The Big Mess which 5 lbs meats 5 different types 2 sides dessert  reason asked because also regular 4 meat plate costs $23 99 only comes 6 ounces each meat two sides no desert  seemed no brainer $39 99 eat some take some home  She informed possible  sign waiver then sit watch eat it  guess 30 minutes eat then if leftovers take them home  challenge aspect but if just want order pay money someone watch 30 minutes why can't that? pretty asinine   In both cases information missing menu both online person  online menu listing does 2 3 4 meat plates 39 99 challenge   separate online page not regular menu does describe challenge  menu restaurant items but doesn't describe challenge nor does any information being prohibited order if don't actually want challenge  menu restaurant also doesn't state 2 3 4 meat plates come sides just challenge does!  Another confusing thing menu lists comma separated list dozen sides all which cost $3 99  Right below also separate listing side cornbread which     $3 99  Why list other sides? Lastly online menu lists specialty drinks fact entire drink menu  presented restaurant   Menu idiocy aside let's back main story  Iris drinks give some time decide  While she gone another server didn't name but he big black guy asks if need drinks  We're even tables nice  Iris comes back brings wife drink but did bring water  She asks if ready order start asking water she says she forgot bring water  Iris did seem strange bringing only drink table two people? any case also order 4 meat brisket sausage chicken pulled pork plate   I can't even believe next sequence events  She back put order in  She comes back starts chatting aforementioned couple again leaves brings couple two drinks then when she comes table she again points she forgot water    I take opportunity ask barbecue sauce table  wanted know if mustard it  She stares 5 seconds if some weirdo alien asking then says she no idea  She leaves then shortly thereafter food shows up  BTW eventually when other server comes ask sauce he checks kitchen gives straight answer    Now food  Props being less 10 minutes time ordered time food but less impressed  Mac cheese baked beans decent but TINY served ramekins   The order cornbread massive pretty good  served honey butter honey butter but ramekin butter honey poured top   As other food sausage delicious but everything else below average  Brisket super fatty chicken cooked then refrigerated then reheated taste pulled pork meh and mustard based sauce it    We did tip Iris but did tip other server interactions with  <EOR> Margaret Top Notch! Sue sat down right away plates amazing!  We'll back! <EOR> Big Mess indeed  start finish bad bad time  server pleasant enough but far I'd go  large group celebrate couple birthdays  seated patio where good amount time noisy converse normal voice level  potatoes potato pickle chip app great  pickle chips foul thick cooked nearly long enough  ordered 4 meat tray hush puppies slaw  ribs dry devoid flavor without lots added sauce sausage tasted standard bought grocery store kind extra grease  pulled meats pork shoulder brisket sat tray oozing grease  hush puppies nasty tasted they'd cooked old oil oil saturated approx  1 8 into puppy  waited seemed eternity checks which then wrong sorted before payment could tendered  didn't care large group tip but spent feed three far better food far less money other places  keep mess never return  <EOR> Was mood some good BBQ typically Lucile's but  figured try somewhere different gave Big Mess try   Wow blown away hidden gem   New Orleans BBQ Shrimp great flavor  Brisket just melts your mouth Fried Chicken tender juicy   Bourbon Q wife Bar BQ Bloody both great   sure fit but split Fruit Cobbler sure fresh   Service good she prompt attentive  think found new BBQ spot  Definitely recommend <EOR> This best BBQ Las Vegas   We're locals tried several town waiting try Big Mess until someone knew tried first but since didn't happen decided definitely disappointed    My husband full slab Baby Back Ribs since wanted try several things 4 meat platter which included brisket pulled pork 2 servings BBQ chicken white meat both    ribs tender meaty good BBQ flavor   Everything platter excellent   brisket tender great flavor no sauce needed but excellent house sauce   pulled pork also tender good flavor texture   chicken also excellent dry very flavorful    The ribs came baked beans good flavor texture also coleslaw which so so according husband   platter ordered French fries roasted corn cob both which really good   Both dishes came very good sized piece cornbread honey butter excellent well  Our server Margaret helper Jay   Both very friendly provided excellent service knowledgeable good suggestions    The price reasonable $63 00 Total which included 20% tip especially considering amount food received   enough left over entire meal each lunch tomorrow    In town Las Vegas important locals support places provide good service quality meal stay around   definitely going back sure often  <EOR> If want full crappy BBQ meat place come  shy portions but meats flavorless tough dry!!!
