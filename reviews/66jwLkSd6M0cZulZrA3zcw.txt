Manager Danielle tried handle situation but began avoiding table which meant left without food all while rest family ate  asked speak General Manager allegedly made second frozen dip voice concerns  He very lackadaisical ingenuine responses  He sounded broken record saying already comped your check say scared order anything else do?  when drunk angry patron other side table decided intervene  He started yelling loud situation butting into business when he no idea happened begin with  collecting information general manager phone number boss before left then drunk guy tried pop table threatened physical violence  push elderly mom way because she couldn't see he trying booth us! Meanwhile GM Frank comes back table sat drunk guy back down but tells leave!  already leaving anyways but called fat coming served cold frozen food repeatedly then asked leave   I shocked  mention phone number GM Frank gave boss fake number!! lost business forever  No big loss really! <EOR> Nothing really special location but always polite food very consistent   facilities always clean service good   Great location quick convenient affordable bite eat  <EOR> The staff super unprofessional  Cussing being OVERLY happy shift ending  There's certain level respect employees should FRONT guests  Even though only sitting bar cool loud obnoxious front people don't work there  actually pretty annoying <EOR> We came sat down 12 minutes later  nobody came table  Its Wednesday night isnt busy  no excuse server come table 12 minutes even water  <EOR> Stopped today happy hour  wanted some drinks food  expecting same service menu back home Nashville  slightly disappointed when realized things same but ate anyways   First thing first although seated promptly took forever waitress come by  Thankfully when seated given menu when waitress did decide drop already meals picked out   I always order some form chicken pasta  Three Cheese Chicken Penne dish usually pretty awesome  luckily friend wanted same thing decided just 2 $20 way could share appetizer too  Also because Happy Hour ordered Mozzarella sticks along meals   The Sticks came 1st  looked great  really appreciate cup marinara sauce gotten larger  opposed cup used actually gave almost enough sauce through all Mozzarella Sticks  Progress!  Once done snapping pictures dug noticed everything good looks  sticks warm but cheese wasn't melted  very hard eat  tasted fried box covered marinara sauce  gave nine hoping least would worth money  Nope all terrible  sauce best thing them  Sad!  A couple minutes later Buffalo flavored Boneless wings came out  must say sucker wings  big wing person UNLESS they're boneless being served Applebee's  love them because they're always cooked perfection seasoned just enough spices keep coming back   I hate anticipating food  usually incredible but when hype friend myself disappointing  being said those damn wings horrible  If wasn't ranch dressing would flipped  sad mask dishes sauces  wings overcooked hard chew  only hand full them but looked cook chopped wing made 3 it  Don't wrong did couple large wings but most them really small   Just wings dropped off entrees came out  Same other dishes meals look cool little dry but never less decent  Once waitress attention because she always move asked more Alfredo Sauce  took few minutes stop back say right but time already tasted Pasta  cold disgusting  Well noodles cold chicken warm plate hot  All messed up! mention serving wasn't enough fill 6 year older     I told waitress entrees terrible she said she sorry offered bring something else out  declined because don't sending food back  told just pay apps she took plates walked off   She came back 3 4 minutes bought check  She discounted entrees Mozzarella Sticks half off being happy hour menu but Wings also he Half Off Menu listed full price  asked waitress once again attention if she made mistake  She told because didn't purchase beverage couldn't Happy Hour prices  confused because she discounted Sticks already  She then told she done favor  She said Sticks suppose discounted either   Subsequently asked manager  wasn't opposed purchasing drink but didn't way she just sprung things then talked if couldn't afford meal  sure if intentions but friend both felt slight offended   She she doing favor although already asked manager  She then took receipt said she see she do  5 minutes she came back receipt  Said manager said he would add discount time but next time would only discount if purchase beverages  said won't next time then she repeated statement  gave woman $20 away table  She brought change back left  never did see manager   I know fault food horrible rules setup but she control attitude  She just snappy liking  Plus she terrible waitress she couldn't even keep water glasses full   I've added place better lucky wasn't starving list  <EOR> The reviews true  service fantastic   But ordered shrimp broccoli cavatappi  34 minute wait pasta yellow cold  send back  When came back 3 minutes later apparently popped into microwave re served  Broccoli smushy overcooked shrimp lacking any juice being nuked just over it  15$ meal could made myself home way better this            thee Bahama mama rum mixed drink meal  sat bar 5 mins watered down point should just ordered lemonade!
