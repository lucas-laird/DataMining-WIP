Really yummy     Service good  Food great     The Tortillas made fresh good   You gotta try quesadilla     mmmmm <EOR> Came lunch recent past   Chips pretty average but salsa very good good consistency texture pretty spicy bean dip served chips also very good   Ordered gordita chicharron prensado sp? which very good fried bread excellent fillings good if little heavy onion some tacos other items which pretty conventional   little pricey $3 99 amounts fairly small sandwich sized item   Only issue very short staffed I assume dining room staff Owners no greeting when walked we assumed just pick table which did much issue pretty large dining area but took 20 minutes drink order chips salsa bean dip menus took 45 minutes food sitting down 30 minutes sitting down take orders    Service slow good weekday lunch   seemed case most customers just group   All in all good food service needs some improvement  <EOR> Restaurant lives its name    If you've craving mexican food its served street vendors hole restaurants Distrito Federal hence DF place go! No isn't any lettuce tacos  Yes gorditas stuffed LOTS meat  Portions look small but don't fooled because DENSE   Try huaraches 1 order comes 2 choose beans cheese filling  Topping tlacoyos which huaraches topped nopales cactus   They're more flavorful stuffed cheese stuffed beans  people salvadorean food they're kinda pupusas   Please support business! would thought restaurant airs B rated commercial TV ad vegas could produce authentic Mexican food yummy  towners worth couple of miles drive off strip <EOR>
