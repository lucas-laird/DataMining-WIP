Try Korean BBQ short ribs yum!!! <EOR> I decided give Gangnam Street try since new owners curious see offer  waiters name Edwin service Great! But food wise serve now amazingly great enough coming back  wouldn't recommend spot  <EOR> Food Soju good! Kimchy pancake my favorite Korean style wings Kimchy fried rice beef curry rice  waiter Jayden great! He also gave good tips where buy Korean skin care products  <EOR> Service great almost great! friend seated he served just waited next waiting order haha tell few times give minute since first time here  prices $$ but food mediocre opinion  chicken wings sticky molasses y unenjoyable constantly pick gooey Wong dressing skin teeth just sweet didn't really depth flavor typically see Korean style BBQ wings  also pork kimchi tofu which took longest prepare which fine but wasn't expecting when typically think Korean style Pork usually square slices pork belly sautéed kimchi should more smoky caramelized tofu side  also spicy squid stir fry which probably best thing ordered squid cooked well OT over under cooked a good spicy! Veggies crisp good texture dish  probably won't drive way come again stick go to Soyo  <EOR> We're glad found place  Somewhat hip Korean bistro great food enticing happy hour deal alcohol  wrong? love beef kalbi  tender flavorful  Also noodle menu something don't find anywhere  definitely back  <EOR> Still love place! manager owner still super friendly made all banchans himself morning!
