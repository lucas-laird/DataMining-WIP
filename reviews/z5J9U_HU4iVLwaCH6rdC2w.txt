Perfectly crispy seasoned just tiny hint spice  waffles good but chicken surely star  Fairly priced lot spend  Wait times long during busy times well worth it  Plus kool aid sweeeeetest iced tea if you're craving southern glass  Check out! <EOR> Tried check place few weeks ago Sunday night around 6 00pm but back due line being door minimum hour wait  Post church rush possibly? Became little skeptical when started reading bad reviews especially coworker USED big fan place  Hmph   Took gamble Saturday 8 00pm    no line no wait requested booth seated immediately  Bar completely empty surprisingly slow  yet took quite while them take order sure if because extensive menu but flag someone down 15 minutes into sitting just could just order drinks   Their menu stated surprisingly extensive  all day breakfast section omelettes pancakes french toast eggs more  lo lo's hood classics the eats section features plethora soul food esque combination plates long section additional sides add ons  But came famous chicken waffles  opted for    FOR HER TRE TRE'S which came two drumsticks waffle  chicken batter decent waffles  which seemed cinnamon kick  also ordered side BISCUITS GRAVY $4 6$ two   much larger imagined sausage gravy pretty tasty!

Sadly not  3 piece assortment drumstick thigh wing  All pieces where cooked inconsistently  Mostly impression dry chicken definitely overcooked  waffle also did knock socks off  Just plain nothing special little soggy   I also sampled cornbread again impressed  Dry lacking flavor   Husband ordered catfish doesn't seem fresh  lack better description overly fishy taste odor  Hard over  Won't ordering again    Also hate commenting service because just varies every visit depends which waitstaff but place needs some help  seated bar area which did choose hostess put only waitress working entire bar covering tables  made call? She seriously over extended unfortunately meant no service us  Never offer drink refills I flag down manager accomplished   food hastily dropped off no came check once  pointed again manager no helping she did nothing I also overheard table next making same complaint manager   Nothing done correct situation manager just simply made excuse servers calling showing late  your job manage staff fill if needed  bottom line won't coming back  <EOR> Great soul food great people  Love fried green tomato sauce   Lemonade bomb  Deep fried catfish great chicken little dry but good flavor  good hot sauce house gravy  <EOR> My lady ate stay Vegas restaurant full Southern hospitality use being Atlanta GA  food terrific spiked cool Aid definitely amazing when love drink me  chicken waffles good  best waffle ever tasted  service great made sure well fed welcomed loved place <EOR> Worst experience    daughter recommended Lolos Chicken Waffle Friday 04 06 18 around 7pm arrived 2 adults 3 kids   hostess acting hostess busser   Then took 20 minutes someone come table ask would like   Since some time decided order appetizer order food same time    Appetizer came fine however food another story   took over hour dinner arrive    While waiting took 2 granddaughters restroom when came back daughter said came packed leftover appetizer ready give check    She wait minute haven't received food  waitress seemed confused   Mind ordered Mac cheese  Grilled cheese fried fish pancakes biscuits gravy  Simple meal   Then another lady came brought food asked if forgot order she did apologize seem care        paid full meal   Would recommend restaurant family friends coworkers     No would not!!!   25 years restaurant hospitality business      seemed everyone all over place no direction  <EOR> Seriously best chicken waffles since Waffle House! mean chicken super moist flavorful extra crispy !!

Loved items menu item names especially fun plenty options seating patio bar booths TVs view normal seating   very good time  Busy but  should expected really good restaurants  definitely return  <EOR> Probably won't ever back here  Management basically oblivious lack customer service here  Sat booth 20min before getting just drink order taken  Thank god KIERA came over she noticed manager wasn't effective sending person assigned section over  many employees other side restaurant standing around doing anything  KIERA should promoted manager she fast polite knows problem solve instead making shift change excuses which management did  Didn't know shift change took 30min  <EOR> I love fried chicken  love waffles  could wrong?  Well when waffle thin bland  when chicken kinda dry bland bad combination  First time impressed decor style place  could wrong but feels took over place business something because seems mismatch chicken waffle place   But nice environment anyways  don't think around long mediocre food  <EOR> You might able find cheaper chicken waffles town  menu whole page devoted different variations dish based amount type chicken number waffles  Lil Amadi super low price $7 consisting thigh drumstick waffle  chicken better expected crunchy crisp exterior well seasoned tender meat underneath  cinnamon waffle noticeable right away  could smell plate being set down front me  Thin edges slightly crispy but overall texture soft pliable chewy waffle  warm dispenser maple syrup provided too  bad meal all but far top notch versions found elsewhere around town   One order cornbread fairly massive  large muffin topped scoop butter  bottom outside edges firm while inside moist quite chewy bits corn worked in   The service bar great  friendly attentive  selection beer other hand pretty sad  Beers tap included Bud Bud light cider something Busch light  would nice if could some local brews taps instead    This place may offer best southern food around but price portion sizes strong reasons pay place visit  <EOR> Had chicken waffles  Excellent understatement   Great tasting food excellent service <EOR> I signature Chicken Waffles dish did disappoint! chicken bit dry under seasoned but waffles amazing great maple flavor! Quite bit your buck am looking forward going back ordering other items menu very soon! <EOR> First visit Lolo's certainly last delish   combo piece chicken piece catfish greens Mac n cheese comes corn muffin       very good     huge portions     you'll likely need box  The service little slow but weren't rush no big deal    they everything fresh   food very fresh HOT   sure would during very busy time day just before two afternoon  <EOR> So give place second try   I'm third  Why?

So chicken nice crunchy coating outside but where pluses turned minuses  chicken meat dry no flavor outside coating no seasoning just plain ole coating blah! dull! edible but enjoyable  waffle saved things yes soggy but expected  yummy slathered butter syrup great cinnamon flavor would back just waffles  I highly doubt I'd back but if did wouldn't fried chicken  <EOR> The food fine but really need work service  slooooow    sitting right now waiting check  Getting servers attention hard enough now 15 minutes later still don't check  place isn't even 1 3 full he's busy <EOR> Really really bad service!  walk  I told ordered 15 minutes later ran catfish okra  two waitresses neither seemed give care table even point table near served food came way us  sure if w color skin  felt wanted along w 2 daughters  Never going back  Place gone downhill!! <EOR> Nice open space nice decor non crowded bar area nice wrap around patio shade! Way Lolo's! 5 stars that!  We Tuesday early afternoon when knew wasn't going busy  We know Lolo's regardless location seated fairly fast  But seemed hostess confused even though weren't busy  She just assumed wanted sit inside without asking she proceeded lead table quickly interrupted tell rather sit outside  Which some reason seemed delay progress halted thought process  She then tried re group whatever but took long determine where could sit outside even though only two parties already  anyways seated then greeted shortly afterwards drink orders  drinks less 5 minutes  ordered food food came only 15 minutes   They alcoholic drinks menu but don't license yet  bummer  should told once seated just FYI could prepared order available drinks   The food GREAT! Made scratch home cooking always consistent!! I frequent Lolo's Phoenix Scottsdale when ever AZ Vegas Lolo's seems just good ordered usual Nay Nay's Two waffles two eggs cup grits then add hot links side   LOVE waffles! flavor no other staple recipe! DON'T ever change them! She chicken waffles  piece chicken came very over cooked  should never left kitchen even served  But new still may learning   idk  But no biggie because never problem telling them take back  She then chose catfish which delicious!

Good food    Came friend seeing some photos InstaGram   When came noticed busy other restaurants Sundays hoping quick service   Our waitress gave time look menu before ordering  both ordered 3 piece chicken macaroni waffle   Not once did waitress manager stop check us  friend would try any servers attention but no stopped  30 minutes later when he waitresses attention she said no before he asked question  Then kept saying no interrupting him   5 minutes later waitress comes tell orders next screen! Let remind no lines door restaurant busy   After 40 minutes later finally getting refill manager brings food all he says sorry wait  never came back check us   While eating waitress only checked once   Never coming back  <EOR> Every time visited location luckily crowded busy  staff very friendly  time ordered alcoholic beverage Blue Ivy pretty good!   For meal ordered soul food platter  platter ordered chicken breast salmon croquette cornbread greens Mac cheese  chicken pretty good  greens good well very juicy  did Mac cheese  did appear taste homemade Mac cheese  cheese seem runny watery fresh cheddar  ordered yams well but forgot bring them out    One good thing Prices reasonable here  <EOR> It very busy hostesses seemed hard time managing check system  Hopefully owners managers help streamline them  while seated   wish already liquor license because probably would ordered drink while hubby sat car kids because packed  said supposed liquor license following week   Anyhow great another option Northwest side town    Update couple weeks later less busy but still no liquor license   Chicken better first time too  <EOR> Excellent food phenomenal service  Ron server very attentive other servers just walking by  Everyone no sure happy needed nothing  fried chicken?  Right point  around corner years never tried never know  Now monthly   <EOR> By far worst dining experiences encountered   family dinner turned into nightmare   Waffles cold all orders   Chicken piping hot' waffles wait maybe    husband shrimp grits 30 minutes everyone else plated   Side orders grits eggs never arrived until halfway through meals   asked waitress times over 30 minutes side orders she began giving attitude   service horrible   gone Arizona no issues   really unfortunate much potential   Maybe taking time training your staff would help manager onsite  <EOR> 45 mins wait 45 mins counting food   Still waiting   much busier places gotten food quicker   Asked drink 20 mins ago  Don't come unless your going want wait forever   Jesus Christ <EOR> I love meee some chicken waffles! restaurant always clean ambiance nice  takes awhile your food I'd think because cooked fresh  several times  truly depends your waiter your experience but generally good one  really good kool aid flavors!
