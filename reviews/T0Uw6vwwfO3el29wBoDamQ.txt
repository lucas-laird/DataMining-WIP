Only thing if eat outside    WATCH HUNGRY BIRDS! <EOR> Not impressed  Spent $24 2 hotdog fries I ordered hotdog bacon cheese  $10 hotdog expect more slice American yellow cheese  $4 fries good though  Hotdog really salty <EOR> I know live Vegas always wanted try pinks  nothing special  I'd rather buy better tasting more robust hotdog drink @ Costco just $1 50 spend $6 $7 something less appealing @ pinks  <EOR> Three stars! star each for SERVICE FOOD COME BACK? No stars AMBIENCE PRICE   Service fast no line 11pm  walk exciting  couple cops midst arresting very drunk very high half naked man  yup hot dogs to go please   The hot dogs good crisp skin juicy dogs  ordered naked dog $4 79 naked dog two extra toppings fried mushrooms + guacamole $8 07  naked dog almost $5 expensive!

Forgot which type but nacho cheese bacon jalapenos  tried girl's burrito dog bacon cheese chili  bomb!  Place no inside seating but strong cooler fans  outside seating sits right front strip   I give Pink's 4 stars because top hot dogs eaten  Although hot dogs restricted eating only when Vegas  They're frkn heavy! <EOR> Pinks okay   my cousins during winter time imagine cold was  did fact heater thingy's working    The hot dogs okay ordered mushroom Swiss hot dog which okay think if used fresh mushrooms would made much better But mushrooms umm think not  bright side enough share since pretty big hot dog  bf other hand ordered Chicago Dog he liked it  prices though just little bit overboard think Costco Sam's Club $1 50 probably way better medium drink included! talking $7 $8 hot dog polish dog  Better yet actually just buy good pack hot dogs anyway want it  <EOR> So really hot dog person but since many different kinds wanted try place out  Big Man dog sister mushroom Swiss Bf Mojave Dog  good but messy started break apart  Mines Blah should just plain hot dog ketchup! sis said ok little bland  3 hot dogs side fries worth 27 plus bucks spent! <EOR> Not much hotdog person but meeting some cousins chose  opted Chicago Polish which nothing chicago style hot dog dressed mustard relish tomatoes lettuce?

Chili dog right temperature chili tasted fine onions good mix   Definitely great snapping dog real distinct taste   Fast service much seating  <EOR> Ordered two hot dogs big mistake ended putting fridge hotel room   Opened fridge few hours later discover very odd smell coming it  hoping eat breakfast next morning before checkout but ended trashing instead   That pretty much sums experience Pink's  great big MEH  <EOR> I chili cheese dog without onions little disappointed chili did contain beans   french fries nice crispy   made mistake eating outside cold December day food cooled off quickly think may better warm   Overall thought food good but worthy all hype  <EOR> Best hot dogs ever! load toppings generously   Service quick friendly   only dislike amount seating available   almost no seating inside  <EOR> Pricey? Yes  However given all realities worth it location taste city etc  <EOR> Pink's yummy dogs burgers enjoyed patio dining without breaking budget! <EOR> My friend both sick eating chili dog   recommended! <EOR> I knew should've trusted fellow yelpers  Even though Pink's didn't very good reviews still tried hot dogs  tried chili dog very disappointed  dog no flavor all  tasted nothing if  even possible  chili just okay  Nothing would enhance dog's flavor but didn't taste any worse  only lacking flavor but hot dog also quite expensive  $8 one!  Wouldn't recommend visit place future  advice just skip place somewhere else  <EOR> This first time Pink's I'd say loved every little bit it!  ordered Mojave Dog husband veggie dog all favorite toppings   very messy meal but also quite worth it!  right before closing time greeted served smiles   Definitely stop again! <EOR> Ok food really eat star power <EOR> I gave four stars because well huge fan hot dogs anyway  Husband however loves them  While didn't think actual flavor dogs anything rave about   but skin snapping dogs even drenched quite tasty chili nice  the chili cheese fries well worth calories and sadly stomachache followed eating much!    and service super fast friendly  outside seating especially big heaters offset chilly Vegas evening  <EOR> I tried place twice now think great  dogs giant toppings plentiful  first trip boyfriend ordered chili cheese fries which huge both plain hot dogs topped them chili cheese fries more enough! place only open couple weeks special where could hot dog beer $8 think  second trip didn't hot dog beer special kind disappointed  would give them 5 stars if brought back hot dog beer combo  Overall great tasting dogs! <EOR> The food served huge portions  also good but greasy  hot dogs taste really good chili cheese fries good because cheese sauce used instead shredded cheese  good place eat if you're strip want something pretentious  all normal fast food huge portions tastes good  <EOR> Pink's supposed massive ending great drunken Vegas night  heard peeps spracking all over place some time although hot dogs good fairly unique  worthy $7 $8 range solo hot dog  Maybe just staple LV late night spot but fries being luke warm really crispy $8 hot dog tasting more $5 hot dog Pinks didn't really leave good feeling meal    The only real interesting thing pinks people watching saw cholo nerdy frat boy straight gangsta crip drunk battle dancing right front outside dining area  Even couldn't completley save pinks experience  <EOR> Meh spot on description Pink's Las Vegas   I heard such great things Pink's LA decided try lunch day recent Vegas trip   Maybe drunk really appreciate hot dogs but less impressed   plus side some interesting combinations menu but execution average   husband chili dog which mediocre best hot dog good snap but taste wasn't anything write home better hot dogs Vienna Koegel's Midwest    2 bites polish I can't remember name but guacamole hot peppers etc  which fine again less impressed meat   guess truly great polish sausage stick ballparks seem right   I'd take Wrigley Field polish over Pink's any day week  <EOR> This another cheap place lunch close hotel Planet Hollywood which where staying while Vegas  number interesting hot dogs  decided Vegas strip dog which awesome Ruben dog which really good order onion rings which can't wrong with  place nice little find service fast    Seating restricted outside only which ok did heat warmers which made better only down fall lot birds where always around but weren't bad  nice place quick cheap lunch just enjoy some people watching  really don't think could find bad dog menu pretty large menu! definitely back! <EOR> I'm big fan Pink's being LA area happy try Vegas   came family luckily able take advantage Groupon deal couple weeks before   All 3 opted Chicago Dog except regular hot dog instead polish sausage   dogs loaded toppings   casing around dog nice snap when bite into tastes just good Pink's LA   French fries shoestring fries which happen looove   fan fat fries perfect crispy   sure if onion rings but those also fantastic just right amount breading cooked perfectly   chilly also ordered hot chocolate only find gal behind counted mixing pouch powdered stuff water     Boo! Oh well hot dogs came sure did hit spot    Also naked dog add ketchup mustard onions relish pickles no charge    Yum! <EOR> Vegas sin city gluttony comes mind when think pink's  but said really hate hot dog smothered toppings barely see bun? didn't think pink's those artery clogging novelty foods love but know probably regret eating later  hot dog itself isn't anything special   its just could never even begin attempt justify putting together something eat own <EOR> Not sure all Pink's hype about  friends LA stand line hour never just Vegas reviewing   Basic hot dogs  better ball parks Fenway!   10 minute line wait but think more due incompetence staff behind counter  Glad cause now don't endure wait line LA as wouldn't way return Pinks anywhere   <EOR> Pricing Good Expensive  end day still just hot dog    Quality Good Excellent  Hot dog definitely good mix meat very good chili  Turnaround Good  Put down order drink found table order done  Service Good  cashier nice   I actually really enjoyed hot dog which ample size overspilling toppings  However end day still hot dog felt quite worth price  Nevertheless hot dog made good quality meat none processed texture artificial flavoring expected supermarket hot dogs  addition chili Pink's use hot dog taste legitimate chili slow cooked ground beef simmered over low fire soup base onions other spices  raw tomatoes threw off terms texture flavoring but end meal glad because bacon chili cheese hot dog actually very heavy standalone meal  turnaround relatively quick where never felt just standing around doing nothing but would more impressed if actually finished order before even walked restaurant find table  no waiter service cannot say much service but lady cashier patient letting take time mulling over order  <EOR> We came because closest thing resembling food sight i'm guessing probably standard place eat drunk people walking    I ordered showgirl dog humongous loaded bacon onions relish mustard sauerkraut    could barely find hot dog underneath mess condiments use fork fish it     I definitely wasn't blown away place think idea having hot dog much crap just little much me   prefer classic chicago hot dog myself 9 <EOR> So leaving LV needed quick lunch within short walking distance hotel Pinks seemed good option!  We Veggie Dogs being vegetarian ourselves pretty good!  moderate price great lunch no selection toppings all bit expensive add ons but tasty none less   also fries which  nice big portion tasted great!  The only reason am giving 5*s seating   they really need expand quite crampt such bustling food outlet  However cute little birds flit patio always provide some entertainment if you're won't able resist feeding them frie two   Overall good stop off lunch but avoid queues if can! <EOR> I should know now   3 stars Yelp most likely loser book   Grease city! $25 2 dogs 2 waters 1 fries  Wide choice toppings  <EOR> To fellow Yelpers place deserves more 3 stars    One star variety menu raging sauerkraut BBQ sauce    Another star urgency preparing order fashionable manner    A star quality food  received pinks special onion rings onion rings where AMAZING along gourmet hot dogs    And final star location nice view cosmopolitan lots lights looking around whole time  Checking scenery!   And being hot dog enthusiast place 4 5 me  Defiantly worth your time money  <EOR> We couple hot dogs jello shots fries here  jello shots basically same would find anywhere else    The hot dogs definitely good but nothing them seemed fantastic  Overall good very convenient but anything spectacular <EOR> Definitely same original  knew wasn't going good since hardly line compared LA which mile long  hot dogs seemed smaller buns hard  chili little bland too  little disappointed  <EOR> I never Pink's CA but always wanted sister decided come location recent vacation Vegas   We shared $7 chili cheese hot dog  bun cheap kind buy any grocery store kind always seems just tipping point turning stale  actual hot dog wasn't anything special   But worse part copious amounts lukewarm chili piled atop hot dog   sister ended eating just half throwing rest away  Overall pretty sad experience <EOR> Great choice planethollywood dog good fries off hook! Justbe preparedto spend little more usual since location inside hotel thelas vegas strip   <EOR> Izzz just fuckin hotdoggggg mannnn don't understand all hype about <EOR> I absolutely love hot dogs! Super delish! twice  hot dogs good but chili cheese fries weren't  didn't urge finish it  Wished Pink's Bay Area  Oh well! Guess going LA Vegas meantime  <EOR> Very expensive over processed food  don't mind paying good money good food but good  mushrooms canned onion rings frozen cheese sauce cheez whiz  If Pinks hot dog stars pretty low standards  won't back  <EOR> I've always heard Pink's while living Colorado actually discovered watching Travel Channel best eats show  location Atlanta prime location Pink's but Vegas point well! very first experience 5 days ago ordered Bacon Chili Cheese Dog Corona wash down  Needless say smashed it! LOL But much food didn't know where begin take first bite  Whatever bite high angle it'll all over place  Then bite low angle 2nd bite repeat! new favorite place quick bite <EOR> I dunno whole craze pinks but all that  service vegas great but food mediocre  think berkeley dogs near uci much better  favorite would japa dogs seattle!! bomb!! <EOR> I believe mojave dog which topped cheese salsa jalapenos guacamole  heavenly put short  don't understand why people give 2 3 stars being hard eat without forks spoons  Well topped goodies duh! The reason gave 4 star bc ordered coleslaw  Worst slaw ever had  think b c used something other cabbage  But can't blame others orders slaw hot dog place? Lesson learned! <EOR> had groupon now kind wish didn't hoping good dog but ended upset belly <EOR> I've never Pink's before but stop because supposed famous good  relatively early lunch   You order counter wait your food come eat outside overlooking Strip  notices asking people feed birds noticed birds real problem  actually table started making moves towards lunch  tried wave away actually pecked me  O_O aware birds issue particularly if you're alone   I chili cheese dog mustard onions some onion rings  onion rings right fryer good  chili dog good  ate fork  knives didn't seem available some reason?  Anyway food good but don't think worth price paid  other words paid something $16 felt maybe $8 worth hot dog onion rings  good but jeez price  <EOR> I think place better location LA  Yes food twice much but much much better view while dining  Two hot dogs two drinks chili cheese fries = $35  <EOR> For price $9 $11 hot dog may steep  But hey its VEGAS!!!

The drinks mainly Pepsi products  No Coke  When you're sitting great outdoors enjoying 105+   temperatures 15 mph breeze really don't need music   must borrowed Abercrombie Fitch store   blasting your ears   I agree Yelpers said better off just going inside Planet Hollywood finding place eat  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised find Pinks Strip  Being SC couldn't West coast one! let's start cons  shop small cramped thankfully wasn't busy weren't bumping into people  only seating patio which ok misting fans but those darn Pigeons   made very uncomfortable enjoy meal fear being pecked feet  let's pros location right across street hotel which pedestrian bridge  ordered Planet Hollywood located Miracle Mile Shops PH polish sausage grilled onions mushrooms nacho cheese bacon order fries well  dog itself wasn't salty typical sausages which appreciated but much flavor  Although liked size considering price made difficult all toppings every bite could party   price came $14 w o drink which cheapest thing out  did notice menu souvenir cup $20 which refillable $10 which LV think great deal  fries good basic nothing special cashier nice  would try again bc said SC won't actually can't lol final judgement until chili dog  Until cross paths again <EOR> This first Pinks food good! fries awesome! price great Vegas! <EOR> Why did ever think would anything close extremely enjoy L A   Rhetorical!!! bad  hot dog less then room temp  barely any chili burrito dog  must know embarrassing  why theirs wall doesn't allow see your order being prepared  Pinks all  Pinks family set bar really high many years ago  absolutely believe should stuck original idea never trying duplicate already Mastered L A   apologize proving loyalty stepping foot your disappointing attempt mirror  <EOR> The bun could better bun hotdog planet Hollywood soggy bad texture it  price could better but  expect guess all foods Vegas strip  Other absolutely delicious  Would recommend! <EOR> Would recommend friend try place sure just wait prepared smell all over your cloth <EOR> This place nothing special   You many options hotdog toppings food isn't bad but definitely overrated better places eat strip  <EOR> Loved dogs best long time  Los Angeles thought would see all hype WAS!

Mushroom Swiss Dog  yummed down matter minutes   husband even laughed scarffed all down when he'd just started eating  normally fan food this   but holy cow  wish I'd gone BEFORE supposed catching flight 3 hours  husband Planet Hollywood dog   which giant compared mine   tasted too   yum!

Stopped when first opened hearing everyone Cali   Just regular tasting hotdog bunch weird toppings   Wasn't terrible but same time other great things eat around Planet Hollywood  <EOR> I looking forward eating Pink's first time especially since heard veggie hot dogs  really disappointing overpriced  bun hard veggie dog itself chewy flavorless  whole thing very dry  husband ordered chili dog chili fries only ate half because weren't very good  also ordered regular fries tasteless really soggy when opened them later drive home   gave two stars because presentation portions huge  really full even though only ate half most meal  <EOR> Cheap ingredients very over priced really shitty cheap strip food   Go somewhere else likely disappointed  <EOR> I've wanting try while seeing food network special   While Vegas first last meal   first meal classic dog chili mustard onions tomatoes possibly cheese but can't remember sure    last meal trip life saver very long night out   guacamole burger scoop chili top    amazing chili great flavor onion rings guacamole nice touch well  <EOR> In experience finding decent hot dog when don't eat red meat pork pretty tough   all but given idea enjoying sloppy dog    until Pink's     I friends town massively hungover chose Pink's Hot Dogs pick me spot   usually just order side dish hello fried food type joint but then something caught eye   quarter pound turkey hot dog??  Could be???  I took chance ordered turkey dog simple dressing ketchup relish   keep classic   served looked more kielbasa bratwurst big   Thick juicy great flavor   Success!    Long story longer definitely visiting Pink's again   Great location great atmosphere outside seating great food   onion rings cheese fries rocked well   Bravo Pink's! <EOR> Pink's Hot Dogs probably most disappointing meal recent trip Vegas   restaurant itself really awkwardly oriented   Pretty much walk menu wall foot ahead you   Then foot left cash registers   Order your food grab your drink find seat outside patio     Now wouldn't sound bad any other city   But Vegas   If any line all means waiting outside order waiting outside 115 degree heat    Then when your food you're eating 115 degree heat because isn't any indoor seating     I ordered regular hot dog sauerkraut added   very mediocre   boyfriend sister ordered specialty hot dogs   said just mediocre well   premium price tag just expecting more   But no difference between dogs hot dogs Costco   Advice just walk few more steps grab sandwich Earl Sandwich instead  <EOR> I don't even really hot dogs much! no hot dog expert here's take We needed lunch place convenient  others I'd seen Pink's LA TV before stopped    I Mel B dog dining companion Vegas Strip  dog 1 hot dog nacho cheese sauce guac sour cream tomatoes onions  Sounds interesting very good but vacation try something different  really enjoyed it!   My dining companion's 2 hot dogs cheese chili  guac onions  He liked well  fact he told can't put picture eating online!   In addition shared onion rings water beer  bill everything $29    The food decent quick tasty  only thing didn't care warm hot only seating outside  breezy but eat quick out  Try something quick but don't expect greatness  <EOR> Just cheap quick snack strip nothing special all  good hot dog any means  huge hot dog fan spot all name  <EOR> Definitely good original but hot dogs!

I'm glad checked off places try but wouldn't back again   I'd much rather spend $1 50 Costco soda well! <EOR> After night excessive drinking   what would better breakfast giant polish dog smothered salty ooze?

I came  saw  left 2 inches dog left      next time shall less extravagantly   P S  Don't shopping try tight clothes afterwards  <EOR> The Pastrami Reuben dog favorite  don't even hot dogs but dog freaking amazing  tried others but dream when come Vegas  <EOR> We stopped quick afternoon bite recent trip Las Vegas   cold 3 afternoon absolutely no crowd   located just outside Planet Hollywood   guess would super convenient those late nights walking down strip few drinks    The location great people watching outdoor seating probably fabulous pretty day but 50's day best time sit outside    We decided try Pink's because heard before wanted try it   good but great   words grandpa nothing write home about  ordered 2 dogs   1 plain 1 Brooklyn Pastrami Dog   plain dog figured would give real feel quality hot dog itself   dogs skinny long   pretty thick casing but wish little hotter fresher  nothing made dog better Gray's Papaya dog Coney Island Dog Atlanta Varsity even Disney Hot Dog   super generic   pastrami dog pretty cool   pastrami wouldn't thought putting hot dog appreciate unique combo but same problem hot dog lukewarm best    The fries did fresh good but lacking salt flavor   would eat again?  Probably but many great options Vegas likely won't to  <EOR> I love watching food shows including Throwdown Bobby Flay  remembered few years ago he visited original? Pinks Hotdogs Los Angeles CA thinking if ever chance try hotdogs would sure so    I generally disappointed overall experience however some positive aspects visit fast friendly service though 11 30AM before major lunch rush hot fresh food    I ordered Chicago Polish hotdog entirely sure expected but disappointed because when eat least hope food would difficult impossible replicate home  better hotdogs own back yard    As side onion rings which hot crispy but didn't exciting flavorful batter worth noting    Another unfortunate part experience annoying little birds very unafraid people kept landing table nearby chairs expecting free handout    I won't going location again but I'd open trying Pinks again only LA  <EOR> My husband loves hot dogs birthday before show       Hey birthday        that being said    We didn't any line all but when order hot dog cold am hot dog lover any means but honestly better hot dog Dairy Queen  <EOR> This place delicious! Reuben served bacon but can't remember name  also split regular fries cheese fries onion rings  Everything very delicious! only complaint only seating outside  know Vegas hot hot hot  would definitely come back next time here! <EOR> I always love pinks used Los Angeles Vegas equally good just location better easier to  veggie Dog perfect filling  <EOR> If you're into hot dogs come Pink's some very large dogs come wide variety flavors tastes  hot dogs heavily loaded bring your appetite! <EOR> I twice while Vegas  Don't trust review though since wasn't exactly sober LOL   The first night chili cheese dog  remember freaking amazing  best friend told scarfed down   The second day mushroom dog I forgot exact name   just A ok   Definitely going back when back Vegas though <EOR> I'd never seen such wide unique selection hot dogs before! However reason give 3 stars because c'mon   they're still hot dogs hahaha  also felt food overpriced   I remember getting hot dog Las Vegas Strip? cheese chili guac top  actually came 2 hot dog weiners  extremeeeeeely filling but also cost $9 tax  think hot dogs should never cost much unless sausages classiest all hot dog sausages  <EOR> This worst hot dog ever $12    Cold n messed order n then told back long line rectify   name half dozen places Chicago dog ten times better   back! <EOR> The bf spicy Mojave dog showgirl dog  Both dogs filled w toppings which good but hard  just pick eat  dogs good but nothing spectacular  Pretty much home w your fav hotdog whatever toppings desire!   Customer service ok  employees weren't very upbeat while eating patio employee sprayed cleaner onto rag right next while eating felt mist   Very unprofessional gross! <EOR> We ordered polish Chicago dog Brooklyn pastrami dog chili cheese fries  weren't impressed food all  very bland Very disappointing  <EOR> perfect hangover cure but putting aside think 6 bucks chili cheese dog outrageous  wasn't bad but wasn't best either  <EOR> If eaten LA located La Brea disappointed here  selection limited because Las Vegas strip its more expensive  Oh well <EOR> After seeing Lionel Richie perform Planet Hollywood walked outside delight saw Pink's Hot Dogs   wait wasn't long Los Angeles location   hot dogs fresh popped when bite into them   Pink's Hot Dogs delicious anytime day but taste even better late night snack! <EOR> I'm LA but all way Las Vegas try Pinks  ordered bacon tomato chili hot dog which good choice  Nothing all fabulous chili hot dog but ingredients together made worth $6 bucks    I avoided long line eating New Year's Even vs New Year's Day  <EOR> It's quick cheap well comparison other options but I'd pass  nothing special anything had  Plain ole hot dog plain ole bun  Menu lots if topping options but all blah  all sorts crap your dog but plain mediocre ingredients  <EOR> The menu doesn't compare LA but still good  wait long located conveniently PH  pastrami dog bf hollywood dog  nice change buffets 4 star restaurants  good place small affordable lunch  <EOR> This place does deserve called pinks hot dogs  would give 2 if let me   If buy hot dog cook yourself would taste better   For anyone original pinks hot dogs LA eat here  might just cry   Pinks known custom hot dog place uses standard plain hot dog could probably find Walmart  <EOR> I haven't original LA but Las Vegas version Planet Hollywood Casino pretty good dog overpriced course but did expect anything else?  hot dogs firm nice casing honestly thought chili pretty good although definitely overloaded point making hot dog tough eat   health food but would definitely again if looking quick meal area  <EOR> Totally gross burger  into Vegas late night hungry close by  ordered burger grey dried flavorless think tab came $11 burger small coke  <EOR> I've always wanted try Pink's wasn't disappointed  Delish!! bit pricey tho  <EOR> I getting little hungry afternoon walking much decided quick bite eat Pink's  key word DECIDED quick bite eat  When jumped line only 10 other people front but took nearly 30 minutes just counter order  place freakin' slow!

Nothing special  Believe 711's hotdogs better  TROLLOLOLOL!  SANITATION most important Tables alright  Some dirty  fast food said   WHAT Chili Nacho Cheese hotdog + bacon  topped jalapenos  believe?? all those toppings still didn't seem all great!  SO WHATS BIG DEAL?? I guess tourist attraction obviously   Some people some people don't  best way know try yourself! its disgusting  just theme park food   OTHER NOTES Seating area lovely place cool down!  sure! <EOR> My first trip Vegas boyfriend decided before trip where wanted eat try out   Truly best hotdog ever had   guess other reviews say its just hotdog nothing special bu other hand think differently   say sausage well all different toppings offer store  really differentiate Pink's other hotdog chains sausage tastes different lot better higher quality compared others    I shared half hotdog boyfriend since saving stomach Belagio buffet but every bite sandwich delicious  <EOR> Sadly menu does compare flagship LA location  Secondly chili thick point separating clumps  LA trumps LV  Tasty but LA quality definitely there   Enough said  <EOR> My boyfriend needed grab quick bite eat order hold over until evening stopped  Pink's Hot Dogs  heard famous Pink's excited try food though nothing beats Chicago's hotdogs don't know thinking!   I Polish Pastrami Swiss Cheese Dog which sounds amazing however couldn't more off! very bland taste despite everything came with  hog dog itself just OK but Pastrami pieces came dry almost hard eat it  bf regular hotdog which hard mess but he also very disappointed  Besides less satisying taste prices incredibly high well   It's great location inside PH which convienant since staying across street however back Pink's  Earl Sandwich bookmarked next time which regret checking due stellar reviews Yelp  <EOR> It's small little place if blink might miss it   walked over hotel night hot dogs daughters   liked much wanted back lunch next day     ordered mini crn dogs cheese sauce   loved them!  Chicago consider ourselves hot dog experts   If know Portillo's Chicago would say better   pains say hold Portillo's icon   fries excellent   If looking inexpensive meal stop here   drawback tables outside pretty hot during day  <EOR> Pink's located near PH towers finally able see hype all about!!! really small inside there's no seating area inside but small patio if come cold windy night did I'd suggest take your food go!  Since first time asked girl working she'd recommend! She recommended polish dog which definitely favorite! huge! bacon chili cheese dog also good! starving hour  half walking strip going casinos able finish hotdog some chili cheese fries!!! chili cheese fries cost little over five dollars! But order lot! <EOR> Wanted something quick easy could better Pink's famous hot dogs?  Well when order hot dogs 30 seconds later ready question did that? When tasted quickly answer  Hot dog hot nor warm more cool side   hot dog large large bun fresh toppings but wants eat cold UNDERCOOKED dog?  tasted someone took hot dogs refrigerator put counter lose coolness placed them bun put toppings   Really  I didn't want back inside discuss unworthy dog cashier because knew she would receptive   She unfriendly stoned faced perfunctory when ordering  even hesitating answer question pointing menu wall instead saying word didn't want tell unhappy hot dogs   Someone barely speaks word customers won't answer questions likely accommodate complaining customer    This hot dog super over rated despite fact more reasonably priced other food options area  <EOR> Everything expected more  hot dog huge kept full hours  food done quick love outside patio  <EOR> It's no comparison real deal Hollywood! Save yourself heart ache disappointment because place definitely does deliver  Unlike original location place no line food comes quick  No windows look through see workers cooking your food  Once take bite into your hot dog does taste same  flavor lacking! <EOR> Was tempted give 2 stars but think just because ordered something ridiculous  the 3 dog night  3 hot dogs wrapped tortilla chili  adult beverage influenced decision  Whoops  would give another try something more reasonable  <EOR> *Shrug   I'm LA but actually never Pink's LA        Had first really wasn't impressed   hot dog nice snap flavor but all chocked supposed legendary <EOR> Pinks expected more you!  I stood lines 2 hours LA thought little better average  Then come Las Vegas try again barley any lines great all! am totally breaking you    I tried spicy dog chilli cheese fries  Both okay nothing special them  place small expensive seating only outside  place truly overrated  <EOR> I high expectations knowing spot where celebrities dine  for HOT DOGS!  the person register I think manager extrememly friendly willing accommodate order  food came FAST think couple minutes paying    This definitely place try if you're area  <EOR> So say thing bad place price  guess being strip overlook that  But gotten Polish Sausage pastrami swiss onions mustard  charge 7 79$!!! Wow thats lot money  Now being said dog itself good  Pastrami wasn't juicy but also wasn't dry  usually pastrami juicy little bit fat outside  Polish itself highlight  first bite juices ran down lip onto jaw  Great flavor great crunch  being said don't know if am sold being 8$ dog    plus tax course  <EOR> Not really sure really good hot dog suppose taste hot fog hot dog  ordrred chilli dog friend ordered mohave dog both equally good liked big chunky pieces halapenios Mohave dog  Huge hot dog good meal  But very clean place  Its ok <EOR> This place off hook!! variety hot dogs choose from  Vegas strip dog loved it!! fries good too!!

Another night  Its fries chili cheese sour cream onions tomatoes   shit fire!! Wish discovered sooner  ate inside front earls grip people came asking where from  Bomb!! <EOR> Visited May thanks Groupon  Basically ordered plain hot dog fries drink  some money left over groupon bought some cookies which gave away  very disappointed hot dog bun dry meat hard almost crunchy  very long but very thin didn't taste good all  fries okay but very thin  Overall disappointed hot dog definitely more hype substance  <EOR> Is everything Vegas fake?  Eiffel Tower Statue Liberty canals Venice bOObs hot dogs?  Being Norcal homeboy down south brought Pink's West Hollywood before remember hot dogs being HELLA good paraphrase Norcal speak      This just HELL without A     swiss cheese mushroom did nothing mask plain ol' boiled hot dog   You'd think $6 dog would least grilled   Maybe should stuck tried true chili dog    Maybe should drunk rather merely tipsy   maybe should just gone Earl Sandwich next door instead   This gives idea when open glitzy Vegas casino and or hip trendy club gonna bacon wrapped hot dog carts outside   usual Vegas markups lack competition Pink's I'd HELLA bank! <EOR> Pink's entering its 73rd year business  Admittedly when comparing prices original Los Angeles venue Vegas spot appears much more expensive  Predictable   Not really seeing deathly spicy option not saying gonna find one whatever could interpreted spicy some people  Spicy Mojave Dog $8 49 choice  Yeah read right  gonna basically $9 tax damn hot dog  Polish sausage nacho cheese pickled jalapenos grilled onions guacamole tomatoes   It looked tasted your basic hot dog bun here  larger Polish sausage abundance toppings really needed those large gourmet buns even give shot pick up  Fork knife would do   Flavor wise did job  basically good could expected be  Great snap Polish dog  Nacho cheese felt came container  veggies guacamole tasted fresh  issue simply price  There's no way poor panda would even want pay around $9 hot dog even if edible gold attached sucker  Besides I'd take edible gold try extract monetary value anyway   I look Yelp reviews Los Angeles Pink's around three star average same Vegas spot  Any complaints likely directed price hot dog living hype  line's also longer L A  probably also affects reviewer's rating  Still wonder if Los Angeles spot better   Pink's good experience  can't complain much food other being able pick up  But also don't want wallet reason riot again  <EOR> Not even slightly close LA location    Really disappointed overall quality taste  <EOR> We starving only 45 min before Jeff Dunham started hot dogs onion rings took back room! great cashier mad combo save money without asking  that! hard frozen lemonade best frozen drink Vegas  showgirl no relish spicy mojave dog  ate whole thing  back next time Vegas absolutely  frozen drink instead other syrupy sweet places  <EOR> Had heard much Pinks Hot Dogs decided lunch today below hotel Planet Hollywood Las Vegas strip   eating checked reviews amazed find some positive statements   hot dogs thin footlong dogs just boiled heat them up   little flavor quite bad   fries didn't bad taste no flavor all neither offensive enjoyable   Prices typical Vegas which say high food quality poor   struggling flavor such mouth last 20 mins   all expected utter disappointment   want reasonable but just can't find basis even give Pinks two stars   Stay away your wallet stomach won't pay have  <EOR> I give three stars because fairly regular visitors Pinks usually love it  last time really just don't know happened  Both dogs served stale buns pre slit down middle  Mine also crack going opposite direction no choice but eat forks  bacon mine absolutely disgusting really chewy stringy just couldn't down  surprised husband adding chili reuben kraut pastrami dog positively awful  Hopeful next time  <EOR> I hot dog covered chili bacon cheese tomatoes  don't know anyone could complain that  Ever  lines fast people taking tables left pretty quickly much wait  Yeah hot but you're Vegas expect  cry inside  <EOR> Just ate few days ago  really Chicago dog love but crazy toppings   chili cheese dog good  <EOR> Not all hyped be  Service kind sucked  weren't even greeted  Then sit not so inviting patio  Outdoor seating only way  cool during Las Vegas's summer  all menu items just messy  could done better home cheaper   But sure would great late night dinner afterhours! <EOR> I every time trek down strip continue so   The reason only giving three stars although service good place clean dogs aren't bad they're all great either   Mainly place variety   The dog itself can't hold properly done Nathans but nowhere near bad Bar S   The Rueben Dog good but hot dog itself gets lost reuben part which isn't bad but I'd taste dog if there   Now Pinks LA anyways famous chili dog   recently bacon chili burrito dog   bacon nice if undercooked but  it   cheese onions lost chili which pretty dang boring   spicy flavourful   tastes kind bean powder mixed ground beef gravy dash tabasco   anything special   If place famous something should good  why they're famous   very disappointing discover tastes something budget can  <EOR> It ok worth all hype  No space look kind dirty kitchen never want eat again   <EOR> Good food but thought price little much  spent almost $30 Swiss Mushroom Dog Vegas Dog something Man Dog small bowl chili  ate everything but Vegas Dog drunk finish it    Bottomline probably wouldn't come back again seems LA tasted better  <EOR> Total shocker  Pinks good   very good  hotdog top quality chili very good  Recommend double chili cheese dog! <EOR> Having gone original Pink's Hot Dogs California place rather disappointing  excited come ADORE original  juiciness fresh hot fries casual seating all come together very hometown feel  place none it  hot dogs tasted almost if just quickly microwaved thrown bun  Nothing special  cheese seems different well  prices also inflated though am surprised middle Strip  shoestring fries didn't taste very fresh  entire meal bit bland  initial giddiness having very own Pink's hot dog available any time completely deflated  guess travel hundreds miles fix  ORIGINAL totally worth it  <EOR> Hot dogs way over cooked   Hamburgers solid   name carries franchise but way better options  <EOR> Pink's Hot Dogs spectacular!  Both classic hot dogs specialty hot dogs delicious more satisfying if you're fan natural casing then you'll heaven   menu feels smaller legendary Hollywood location's but all classics favorites though sometimes under different names   I developed fondness Pink's while living LA missed terribly since left part because isn't much Hot Dog scene where live if visiting city great Hot Dog joints may impressed   I dismayed when didn't recognize menu I'd harboring mad craving Martha Stewart Dog wasn't found   Fortunately cashier helped identify Vegas equivalent Hollywood dogs found Showgirl Dog highly recommend it   If you're more sausage mood Planet Hollywood delicious option   missed Pink's much both gigantic dogs  <EOR> they basically your average hot dog stuff exception    their chilli pretty rad sure dog your choice    i mine chilli nacho cheese jalapenos onions mustard no regrets <EOR> Never original Pink's SoCal but couldn't imagine waiting 2 hours line this   mean ain't no Costco dog Portillo's ain't     I've few times quick bite since stay PH often   They've lot unique dogs hefty portions but most just covered excessive toppings usually just stick naked dog w chili jalapenos   just lack snap look when bite into good dog sausage   If you're hot dog quest Vegas some drinking would definitely hit spot but otherwise inside grab sandwich Earl  <EOR> Can anyone tell where homemade style corn dog Vegas? Hotdog stick wiener schnitzel don't count  Thank you <EOR> Only outdoor dining under umbrella tables   much say hotdogs but whatever reason people wait line over 1hr LA eat Pink's   Thank goodness no lines here     Hubby's chili dog $6 79 messy eat soda $2 95  combo Pastrami Ruben $8 49 combo soda fries $5 95   They another Pastrami Ruben without kraut costs more   Can't say I'd eat again unless really wanted hot dog badly  <EOR> Was 1st time goin Hella Good  Gotta back try few more things  Frys cooked very well cheese frys good  <EOR> I havent opportunity experience Pinks Southern California being SF Bay Area but Pinks actually alright opinion    Dude chill   i already said didnt chance try Original Pinks gonna write know   I ordered G   jsdoifahefoiasjfsaoif dog  tomatos onions relish sour cream cept cut onions cause onions dont along   Overall think bad choice because none condiments really complimented each other relish over powering tomatoes tasteless sour cream barely noticeable    The bun long gay looking sausage made all worth it  dog crisp bite bursted juicy flavor no homo    bun soft filling    The price way steep hot dog but may worth come back every while  all other times   There Costco dogs! <EOR> While walking through PH decided try Pink's  Let just say YUMMY!!! western burger think bite finger accident because eating si fast!

Since hot dog traditionalist mine ketchup mustard relish chopped onion  hubs Vegas Strip dog SIL her's straight plain  Regardless toppings lack Pink's dogs great! Please don't compare Coneys because would comparing apples oranges  dogs nice lunchtime experience during trip  Oh sign says don't feed birds? Heed advice  <EOR> All friends Cal said way better because put better bun holds lot more condiments overall hot dog taste lot more juicy fulfilling   It's worth try though   good hot dog over bunch heart attack causing condiments anywhere $5 $9 over tax all   serve beer over burgers fries other sides   Located strip outside Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops   worth try if you've never but don't expect anything special  <EOR> There's major difference between eating margarita eating before margarita  vouch eating margarita tastes significantly better   Being sheltered all life never heard Pink's Hot Dogs wasn't aware its popularity until here  Combined love chili ended ordering chili cheese fries Nacho Chili Cheese Hot Dog Mel B Hot Dog   The wait time really short really good place sit underneath vapor party marathon Strip  think place visited your trip Vegas but might incredibly biased chili aspect  Although chili dogs selling point could love chili really thought winners hot dogs mustard cheese sour cream  <EOR> hotdog   But PINK''S!  It's  A  Hotdog  ordered Guadalajara dog while enjoyed really worth $6? Probably considering just hotdog  basically paying $2 hotdog $4 famous name  if even original Hollywood stand what's point? Definition tourist trap    I suppose would recommend everyone try once don't try healthy  Lather sour cream cheese chili ect because if you're going wait obscene amount time $6 $8 hot dog might well all out  might help if little tipsy well cushion realization resources exhausting minimal nutritional value  Hey Vegas  Luckily myself barely lunch rush able walk order dog just few minutes  But line few minutes later crazy! Unfortunately though also December freezing outside  None your $6 toward any indoor seating    I've always believed Las Vegas embodies best worst things America all place  Such greasy overpriced famous food  Case point  <EOR> Sometimes just want indulge meat cheese bacon other junk  If  you're looking place hit spot  Definitely dieter but would definitely great cheat meal  Planet Hollywood dog fantastic  scarfed down fast  <EOR> Found place way Fat Tuesdays! become secret junt mine kill diet softly lol  Yeah Im focused lose weight wedding but everyone gets cheat day use cheat day here  last hotdog eva crave  things people hot dogs chilie dogs onion rings send trip  Mhm journey heaven each every bite  come munchies leave pot belly  dont hold back good stuff  God bless people Pinks  Omg did tell bread cheese should against law cooking something good  Oh lord sale burgers also  taste this  Hello name Queen Im addicted Pinks  Ok everyone chant along hi Queen lol  See here!

Fries crisp tasty well  <EOR> DISGUSTING!!!!   That's all say  dying some Pinks LA happened run into location  ordered chili dog Chicago hoped tasted same  Boy wrong!  The sausage did taste same ones LA  ended feeling sick eating it    Listen reviews folks don't end bad stomach ache  <EOR> I exposed Pink's Hot Dogs Food Network channel  during Bobby Flay's dog challenge where believe he won too    original location Los Angeles  guess opened another location Las Vegas inside Planet Hollywood    It December 2010 when first experience Pink's  windy did indoor seating  cold even outdoor heater  People outside eating wearing leather jackets shivering  Aside hot dog overrated  order chilli dog fiance ordered some kinda dog onions  tasted any other hot dog would order restaurant serves it   Nothing special place  <EOR> Burrito bacon chili cheese triple hot dog fun  Seating outside strip  would liked more cheese but location convenient Planet Hollywood  Enter strip side  LA institution Vegas  Enjoy once  <EOR> For lunch wanted try Pink's  finally   heard hot dogs very good decided try myself   few things keep mind when comes Pink's  size cost  explain minute   Just let everyone know Pink's outside Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops facing boulevard   walked around awhile till found sign building realized outside   Anyway wasn't line seating all outside take look menu   The menu simple pre made options even burgers if aren't into dogs  almost 10 dollars dog pretty pricey but expected famous hot dog eaterie   even special dogs celebrities flyer entrance near menu check those too   I guadalajara dog  sour cream tomatoes onions relish  and husband ate classic chili dog onions   grabbed water fountain drink total 25 dollars moved down pick area  When saw hot dogs freaked out   love toppings but really?  REALLY?  definitely fork knife dog   I love eating hot dogs hand   just way should but Pink's difficult so   many toppings dog cause flavor dog lost scraped EVERYTHING off half down matters  that fried dog   hot dog good slight snap but amazing   ate rest utensils feeling if violated some ethical hot dog code eating hands   If want try dog buy plain ask toppings side if need them way really taste Pink's dog all about   If want something really good chili dog decent   Overall dog decent least say tried once  Would fight way down through traffic again it?  Nope   But something try once say have  <EOR> Yuck     why food cold?  1 2 but 6 us        I hope opening LAX better one  <EOR> I'll short  disappointing didn't same menu Los Angeles  didn't enjoy food because it  Even writing right now bummed out  just    wanted buy hot dog celebrity made ones mother could try but just standard one  taste ones L A  where somewhat close taste but very far away  wouldn't again because just feels cosmetically made hot dog  mean look whos being advertised    Mel B Kim Kardashian Holly Madison  Bunch whores  made meal worse  Just could enjoy hot dog all  Ordered Show Girls Dog Mojave dog  <EOR> During thanksgiving vacation first dinner Vegas pink's hot dog  told pink hot dog most famous Hollywood  Since never chance visit Hollywood decided give try see Hollywood tastes   My Planet Hollywood dog comes some bacon melted cheese along hot dog  bad but did feel little bit ripped off  guess anyone bacon American cheddar hot dog bun could easily planet Hollywood dog home much lower price  because strip need pay rent renovation and advertising well ?   I would think even Costco hot dog more cost performance value Pink's Las Vegas  visiting store think need find real SoCal Hollywood Pink's Hot Dog tastes fake Hollywood!  Oh way don't order fries  Very expensive small portion  <EOR> The variety toppings your hot dog pretty amazing i e  different types     bacon top pastrami etc    weird     but shabby  wasn't adventurous try ones bacon them but adventurous try mushroom swiss dog instead plain hot dog  haha $7 mushroom swiss dog thought bad all  portion decent LOTS mayo which love did skimp mushrooms  say though if mushrooms grilled would've received more stars because non grilled mushrooms just don't taste same    However if just want quick bite carry onto your next activity bad stop  <EOR> Great hotdogs sausage dogs   Large portions   Good fries   If your looking good comfort food then place   fancy place however   Stand line your food sit outside enjoy people watching  <EOR> These hot dogs fantastic! Small quaint place! Definitely good food awesome sides  fries fantastic huge sure share them someone else! <EOR> I've heard famous Pink's years excited stop lunch  okay    but something would return for  understand things pricey Vegas but much plain ole' hot dog me  Nothing spectacular but fill void  <EOR> Still all around hot dog fan  Still Pink's Hot Dog lover  yes chili cheese fries still heaven last time around  <EOR> Been wanting try Pink's LA years but somehow just never made it   tickled 'pink' see outlet strip new Planet Hollywood   Carnegie Deli Pinks Vegas?  Heck won't travel much now if all here  fun night drinking headed excitedly ordered chili dog   It okay   didn't wow but pretty much regular chili dog   Maybe expected little much?  mean much expect hot dog?  Even then expected something just little more special   snap expecting nowhere found but perhaps hot chili factor   The outdoor seating watching crowds strip made all more entertaining   Bonus points having seen Jerry Springer for real standing same spot just few hours earlier   Sadly chili dog small ended Sirocco's late night slice afterwards   bad way end night all  <EOR> No big deal all really say    Pink's looked pretty busy happening its menu sounded mouthwatering  Its multiple celebrity endorsements new veggie dog sold $7 something later settling down veggie dog piled swiss sauerkraut    It perfect hot dog 5 year old  don't know expecting but certainly wasn't rubbery boiled hot dog stuck web gooey melted processed swiss sandwiched inside cloudlike Wonderbread style bun  all right but completely lacking sophistication  Generous sauerkraut though give them that    I doubt revisiting Pink's anytime soon many other options quick bites crowding Strip vying money  <EOR> PINK's!! Great hot dogs! Great toppings! Lines weren't long all when there!  I chilin dog! Chili good hotdog nice crispy! Another food stop need while Sin City!  I'm sorry say but Gray's papaya NYC all day everyday! <EOR> I normally eat hot dogs but love good bratwurst italian sausage   Between four four hotdog sausage dishes plus burger onion rings chili fries   We expected hotdogs sausages great quality but found them lacking flavor      would given restaurant 1 star but bumped them two stars following bacon Planet Hollywood amazing but everything else blah onion rings very tasty the chili cheese fries other hand not   when messed order quickly corrected additionally let keep sausage plate hadn't ordered  friends said unlike dogs burger actually quite tasty  For think sausages finds outdoor fair much better taste quality found Pinks      I recalled meals being much better L A      was  because waiting hour line cold L A  anything served would tasted good?   don't know but know won't returning Vegas Pink's  <EOR> I love hot dogs but just much just slender bun  even hot dog anymore when cut knife eat fork since much stuff going trying fit your mouth  The shoe strings chili cheese fries really good  <EOR> I heard lot great things Pink's when Vegas decided give shot   cute little building but prices ridiculous   cost over $11 just hotdog fries drink   thing disliked most only seating outside   sat outside birds table   dump most food because birds flying around sitting practically top me   Wouldn't back  <EOR> I'm LA native first experience Pinks Las Vegas figure  lol  On Sunday afternoon middle July boyfriend's friend decided he wanted eat Pinks Pinks went  Pinks may know located just outside Planet Hollywood  Very small small outdoor seating section which did enjoy much because 110 degrees outside   Boyfriend mentioned price little more expensive LA location  We stood line 15 minutes sun   Boyfriend ordered hot dog pastrami jalapeno guacamole forgot name   He enjoyed  I ordered polish dog which chili grilled onions  good but nothing special guess should ordered specialties  We also ordered onion rings which yummmy! Greasy big! =P Not bad but great  guess give another try but LA location instead  wouldn't back Las Vegas location though because where located fact price higher LA location  <EOR> We weren't hungry but tired passing place least splitting hot dog     well  over with   We'll back too   Onion rings size hand cuffs but hot dog absolutely delicious     We split bacon chili cheese dog overflowing chili crisp bacon   Next time Vegas definitely back  <EOR> Wow great find Vegas! Looking reviews lot people rate seating area which relatively small but review food! Looking menu everything literally under $10 definitely affordable Vegas  wide variety menu well some crazy ideas  Ordered disappointed  Great portion size amazing price! left full but overly full where felt uncomfortable  Awesome food awesome prices awesome find! <EOR> The frozen drinks appealing eyes but palate   chili dogs appealing neither  <EOR> Finally try food    ordered Chilli cheese fries really good hot   burned tongue because smelled good couldn't wait   Chili isn't spicy  Just right  If love spicy you'll disappointed   believe $6 79  Boyfriend 10 corn dogs big man dog  He said perfect   dog even snapped because skin   tomatoes onions   No picture because he really chowed down    Great service   Thanks much  <EOR> I think hot dogs oily gross  Everyone keeps saying good but did want pay 8 bucks small hot dog huge bun pile oily chili    The chili wasn't even great  felt gross eating red oil drenching all over bun  finished hot dog before chili bun  only good thing place fries  tasted McDonald's fries   I don't think ever believe hype again over something this  such novelty  should try least once say did but don't think even worth that  <EOR> OMG place better words even describe! know no business ending last weekend but sure glad did! always wanted try place out! long night having fun gambling group friends stumbled across place! Sometimes certain foods taste even better when your drunk place happens if them! ordered Vegas style strip dog added sour cream! bit messy kind expensive hot dog meal but worth every penny spent fact offer huge variety hot dog styles means returning until tried all ones I'd try! <EOR> I love going pinks Hollywood  place No Dice  Hot dog cold didn't taste very good  <EOR> Pink's Hot Dog's located just outside main doors Planet Hollywood   alright place if you're looking quick bite reasonable cost  Each day would walk past Pink's would notice never any heavy foot traffic going into restaurant  believe much direct competition around Pink's finding difficult compete    Many people say original Pink's Hollywood  While Hollywood few times pleasure dining original Pink's therefore don't reference comparison  particular location A Okay  ordered veggie burger divine  great twice during  trip Vegas  husband ordered chili cheese dog did all  Ironically he likes chili dog Sonic drive thru much better served here  quite concerning since hot dogs specialty  If Vegas would veggie burger again but  probably all  <EOR> This place kinda sad because LA Pink's huge hit  wish place could all options Hollywood does but doesn't  original toppings but celebrity specialties missing  Guadalajara Dog sufficed trips but definitely wasn't worth while having hangover   Other wait pretty short there's plenty outdoor seating which conveniently placed mist  <EOR> On last day Vegas search Pink's Hot Dogs told girlfriend hot dogs suppose really good   guess more hot dog experience   Well   experience right word it   only regular dogs but specialty dogs well everything imaginable top   First   the entrance Pinks sidewalk strip   parked back parking garage coming backside Miracle Mile lost   thought Pinks inside would entrance inside   not   walked around 20 min  trying find before realized outside   Looking over menu just didn't want old fashioned hot dog wanted try special dogs   ordered Planet Hollywood dog which polish sausage cheese sauce mushrooms grilled onions bacon   list other dogs well anything craving   order arrived ready eat     Well   it experience  sure!  Trying eat huge dog all toppings gave new meaning messy!  finish fork because just much!  While prices dogs bit high $8 PH dog good place try specialty dog while Vegas   Would try again?  Possibly    <EOR> If you're LA native Vegas weekend suddenly crave Pink's 3 am COME HERE!!!!   THIS JUST SAD EXCUSE PINK'S HOT DOGS! portions smaller prices higher  definitely Pink's love! If you've never original Pink's LA don't judge Vegas Pink's  Totally different experience totally different food    I'm just angry thinking it     <EOR> I agree other reviewers  Over hyped really underdeliver  hot dogs plain uninspired  cheap no service speak of  Uncomfortable seating area speakers blaring ads loudly you  <EOR> I PH dog must used 100 napkins  good but very difficult eat messy  thought onion rings average but good  Nothing really write home about  think next time basic dog eat hands suppose eat hot dog  <EOR> Pink's Hot Dogs Vegas repeats formula original LA store  Good enough sausage variations good ingredients cool store friendly staff  Some people tastes experience vary but never anything complain here   Chicago good option try more traditionalists always cheddar chilly options! <EOR> On morning half marathon walked passed Pinks!! All could think during torturous 13 1 miles was    Please God let same Pinks LA!! Let's honest   it's Pinks!    you can't order satisfied it! Greatest part     NO LINE!! Although sure longer open more people sprint way in   and if don't   then feel bad could experience wholesome goodness Pinks dog engulfed BBQ sauce oozing over chili covered cheese onions! <EOR> Being Miami lot hot dog places which load your hotdog tons yummy goodness stuff try green pineapple sauce    am used eating loaded hot dog   if try quail egg   This place? Why when amazing restaurants all around you   its cheaper alternative $40 plates around you   But reason why hot dog costs $8   If going cheaper maybe just hit McDonalds thats located same strip   Its place terrible anything   Its just great   why waste your money your calories?  The staff nice place feels clean plus   sit outside people watch  <EOR> First off nothing Pinks LA  living San Diego year now having lived LA miss Pinks  when Vegas saw Pinks strip really excited  soon walked should known  place everything pink looks retro 50's diner  caught off guard considering real Pinks basically rundown bungalow covered photographs only thing  actually pink sign front  Next menu  didn't recognize single 'special hot dog'  original Pinks special hot dogs LA themed name named celebrity  Pinks Las Vegas special dogs named Las Vegas theme  ask girl front counter if knew which dogs renamed which dog Martha Stewart dog  She list behind counter listed which special hot dogs renamed but she told most special dogs own creations renamed dogs original location  Uhhhh    ok  basically Pinks completely different restaurant name Pinks slapped on   Now food  ordered Chili Cheese Dog Polish sausage subbed hot dog mustard side fries totally $13 some odd cents  waited few minutes order number called  retrieve food really confused soon saw French fries which nothing LA Pinks French fries  made comment person gave food looking nothing food original Pinks woman also LA walked behind said same    So food good? Yeah decent  But worth 13 bucks spent it  shoe string fries nothing Cajun fries that LA Pinks serves expecting but good nonetheless  Worth $5 99 paid them? No  But  eating strip  Polish sausage pretty good chili was    flavorful  But overall glad tried it   The verdict if you're strip near Planet Hollywood craving hot dogs probably best you'll find  However if you're lover original Pinks your heart set your usual order don't come here  You'll leave craving wasn't curbed disappointed wallet weighs less when walked in  <EOR> Don't believe hype don't know if Las Vegas store but expected more  Overprice hot dogs nothing special them  <EOR> This place overrated   late night but don't understand line during day   Nathans better dog   say bad but Nathans better better fries Nathans too  <EOR> Overpriced get    don't see hype all about  always heard stories Pink's down LA line crazy long but pretty empty here   They pretty messy eat veggies goodies piled top dogs  ordered mushroom swiss hot dog but impressed    cheese gross! <EOR> We groupon Jell o Shots Pink's  green apple blueberry grape  took them outside nice little patio area people watch  Jello o shots really good outside seating always plus  <EOR> My friends came breakfast around 1pm night XS  Earl's 2 3 times point trip wanted mix up    Monday morning pretty much no line  guac avocado type guy Kim Kardashian thought pretty good   basically BLT+guac hotdog We sat patio very relaxing meal  food wasn't heavy felt perfect amount time    didn't think food overpriced overhyped all very different most other reviews Sure paying almost $10 hotdog Earl's right but its all relative  could compare hotdog 24 hour cafes area price very reasonable   As long no lines just short lines I'd back try again  Besides crossing fingers hoping would free there's nothing I'd really change hot dog experience just  singer Pink says perrrrfect not really favorite song but poor attempt clever names <EOR> Blech can't believe you're allowed serve people   pay it?  wait line?  sure hot dogs original wonderful but having first impression Pink's think L A  should disown shame putting name!  I Mel B sister some kind mexican themed one   Both came $10 each little expensive but hey San Francisco pay $5 really small but really good cupcakes thought $10 babies must good!  Boy wrong   don't think sister liked but speaking mine alone all could taste topping no hot dog   because hot dog bad?  Because even toppings weren't good enough that   just mess toppings none which seemed well each other everything else Vegas just way excessive   think toppings moderation miiiight good   give place point being such cute concept cute decor cute serving ware   But cute only gets far   hope you're reading reviews Pink's taking note  <EOR> I travel zoo deal which pretty worth considering amount getting $15  service friendly only outdoor seating   I Mojave dog subbing veggie dog  alright    nothing special  sick quick  portions huge    It good try but probably won't come back when Vegas  <EOR> I love pinks chilli cheese fries! deluxe just receive larger size! loaded chill love nacho cheese  favorite chilli cheese fries far! <EOR> Pink's serves good dog  But all hype expected more  toppings unique dogs good sized but $8 $9 pop should be  Thanks Groupon wife twice last month  Both times waddled away very content  variety dogs Polish dogs even Pastrami hot dog burrito  All very good  onion rings thick crunchy  great fan Windy City Beefs N Dogs Lake Mead sure if back but fun trying Pink's out  <EOR> Despite all reviews see place food network wanted give try    But regret only meal did enjoy trip   On yelp there's free hotdog offer  Somewhere details should tell hours    basically there's restriction offer which cannot find  Maybe full site mobile site   Anyways let down since just looking into snacking offer instead eating full meal   I ordered chili polish dog  It better regular dogs which looks very unfilling  onion rings okay but also spicy onions    onions weren't cooked all way through    chili cheese fries okay   Overall average hotdog stand    nothing special  <EOR> While honeymoon Vegas last week found Pink's there! thought only Cali  needless say lunch  good! husband burrito dog Vegas dog  dogs HUGE totally worth price  fries crisp fresh very tasty  also offer free refills soda  wish Pink's would open location S Fl  <EOR> I ve heard lot Pink's hoping let down when happened January   thank goodness pretty good    chili dog actually pretty tasty   I'd call cheap think $5 50 when but given location novelty expected that    wasn't much line thank goodness pretty small place    There's seating area outside sidewalk Las Vegas strip allows pretty nice view while eating  <EOR> If expensive undercooked hotdogs then place perfect  LA location much better really disappointed ate one  boyfriend could barely finish hotdogs because gross   ordered 3 reg hotdogs 1 order onion rings drink $30!!  lot $ crappy meal  <EOR> Never quite patience stand line LA place tried 2x gave before line even curved towards front  Sorry but only wait line Hot Doug's Chicago  We're Vegas there's PInk's right front Planet Hollywood hotel no line figured worth shot  chili dog hot dog itself very good well spiced no weird bits nice snap  chili tasted fine but texture gluey kind unappetizing  ended taking most off hot dog  Husband Chicago Polish dog  Great flavor but skin bit tough  fries great though  Overall 3 stars  Would come back if mood hot dog but destination place  <EOR> Being huge Travel Channel fan often seen Pink's Hot Dogs shows featured there  Luckily right hotel Planet Hollywood  able try Chili Dog minus Mustard Onions Fries Onion Rings  Fries Onion Rings really good Chili dog great flavor it!

Some favorite things!  reality however did blow away   good late night snack hungry gal beginning sober but all honesty wish it'd better especially $8 50 paid it  <EOR> I am long time fan Pink's brand   Growing Southern California made original Pink's great destination   something magical standing line 45 minutes huge number various hotdogs   Some more unique others   would take 45 minutes just decide which wanted   The Pink's Las Vegas unfortunately destination original is   menu smaller   Much smaller   handful unique dogs few standards too   really wanted don't The Mulholland Drive Lord Rings    Planet Hollywood Dog fitting casino which Pink's LV located    Planet Hollywood dog similar Mulholland Drive   same toppings nacho cheese grilled mushrooms bacon but hotdog rather sausage   Close but no cigar   Instead opted Pastrami Reuben Dog topped pastrami sauer kraut mustard   fine but nothing spectacular   did appreciate snap natural casing   signature Pink's dog   But no wait all   walked right register ordered   couple minutes later food   no anticipation receive  no celebrity photos gawk at   least none remember seeing   wasn't long enough notice such things   In end hot dog fine but location just lacks certain something original special   Next time Pink's craving think just live until LA real deal  <EOR> I didn't know much hotdog place other seen Food Network  Las Vegas strip day when came across it  perused menu prior stepping counter order  seemed budget friendly until total came up  family four ordered two chili dog combos chili dog fries drink hamburger duluxe chili cheese fry two more drinks  total $48! Yes everything Strip expensive  Even chili dogs  worried but pleasantly surprised  Y'all Duluxe Chili Cheese Fries BOMB! I'd eat those again before I'd eat anywhere else Vegas  K   fries chili nacho cheese sour cream diced onions tomatoes  Seriously eat them whether hangover not  Only draw back seating  Only patio dining available max capacity 31  plenty napkins dig in!!! <EOR> I staying Cosmo across street needed some quick food fuel gambling walk over Pink's  chili dog delicious patio Strip watching three card monte game great  trying figure game the shill believe called   Great fun  Great food is  <EOR> I never orginal LA but did OC Fair  booth bad! say wasn't looking forward understatement but  good   both hot dog burrito should just cause would filled both up  great fries also cost little bit but doesn't Vegas  <EOR> I looking forward trying place all weekend!  After having drinks all day night really wanted something bad   real bad me    I decided order Planet Hollywood dog   bacon grilled onions mushrooms nacho cheese top polish dog   Let tell ya exactly craving   bit salty side though   already dehydrated enough bacon real salty    love salty things Other never hot dog yummy big!  couldn't finish it   The wait wasn't bad when came actually getting dogs didn't take long either   liked environment fun exciting   I'll probably come back when huge appetite haven't done make up   end eating your dog you've wiped off all nacho cheese  gotten your face your freshly put make up! <EOR> Overrated  haven't checked LA Pink's because there's always line  should known better wasn't line PH Pink's   Maybe because outside casino actually into tiny little space order pretty inconvenient since 30 degrees snowing outside   I disappointed hot dog nothing special guess all toppings Pink's special  staff should bit more energetic ask if customers tried Pink's before if then recommend quintessential Pink's dogs     None here   Just people looked bored    Stop Earl's inside Casino Miracle Mile mall if want delicious cheap quick bite  <EOR> This place hyped overrated  I'd pick costco polish sausage any day over this  kind long wait friggin HOT DOG  gaahhh  <EOR> Came because coupon $30 worth food  mini corn dogs onion rings Ruben dog 2 draft beers $6 coupon   Food expected but definitely worth $15 spent coupon  Only seating options outside beware much shade  would suggest getting finding someplace else sit  located right outside Planet Hollywood little hard find because thought inside but not  Just FYI  <EOR> Pinks LA need wait 90 min Hot Dog  0 5 min! sure better LA but hey! Next best thing right?!?  We ordered Chili Dog BBQ Cole Slaw Dog  Both incredibly delicious  bun way soft instantly broke apart allowing dog fall through knife fork time! but made give 4 stars actual dog  natural casing biggest snap ever tasted! Each bite snap ! awesome! Loved dog liked toppings hated bread the fact fell apart otherwise doughy good! Pricey Though! $6 8 dog! <EOR> Call cheap but without deal would come Pink's own account knowing hyped mediocre over priced hot dogs  Luckily used Groupon deal allowed try Pink's affordable price   The stand located outside Miracle Mile shops no access Planet Hollywood casino  learned hard way  _ I ordered Brooklyn Pastrami Swiss Cheese Dog  keeping dogs plain dressed mustard  enjoyed dog but would liked even more if pastrami came hot rather lukewarm   I also sampled some bf's Bacon Burrito Dog 2 dogs bacon chili cheese onions   ordered dog without onions but came standard he brought back re made  cook nice probably because hardly line 4 pm served new within 3 minutes spit free! interesting    glad tried but wouldn't order again  also best eaten wrapper because burrito drips chili grease    yum!  With $15 Groupon fork whopping $0 52  Overall $7 52    would mind paying price but $15 52 bit steep 2 dogs  I'd rather use money buy 2 sammiches Earl's inside  back once hands another deal! <EOR> I looking forward having pinks since last time pinks 2015  They amazing great selection different hot dogs ways prepare them  I means ruban hot dog hot dog pastrami ? Awesome !!! Also prices pretty good being strip ! <EOR> I should've checked Yelp instead listening all hype  While vacation few places friends heard quite often wanted check Pink's them  Located right hotel figured it'd better places eat during trip but     much   Maybe because spoiled all good food San Francisco but Pink's didn't strike anything special  Most items seemed pretty similar mostly consisting chili bacon onions cheese other meats ton variety overall  Though say portions to price ratio pretty good gigantic filling meal $10 unless monstrous appetite won't need second hot dog   As food itself? Average  Even though most friends feeling ravenous think only nine managed finish wasn't really because filling hot dogs were  Sure they're packed brim condiments other things but mostly standard fare  actually felt kind sick bloated few hours afterward certainly didn't feel finishing leftovers looking later day   Unfortunately people thinking they'll sit indoors hot dog AC dominated environment only seating outdoors hot hot Vegas sun only few tables sitting underneath bit shade  pretty small location if crowded might just want bring everything back your room instead  It'll less messy way anyway   Overall don't think Pink's met hype all  Perhaps because original Los Angeles Vegas addition better hot dogs local joints sorry!   probably worth stop if you're Vegas but don't expecting best hot dog you've ever had  You'll only set yourself disappointment end  <EOR> I tried original Pink's Los Angeles once   Since am Vegas much more LA excited see open   just original minus pesky birds steal your food if don't them away   draw toppings   actual hot dog skinny but long paying toppings which PILE on   also other sausage bratwurst options which quite delicious well  several different options all quite delicious  <EOR> Stopped Pinks Chili Cheese dog  Wednesday afternoon no line  chick working super friendly served within 5 minutes arriving  Also tasty lemonade  Chili dog really good fresh bun  Would recommend long crazy line  I'd hit again but wouldn't stand line it  <EOR> Let just preface saying only similarity place original Pink's Melrose Ave  LA name  Overpriced mediocre hotdogs beef? made worse forgettable service people work look want anywhere BUT   Anyway would save $7 somewhere else small hotdog stand outside Home Depot Rainbow Charleston serves way better hotdogs 1 4 price  Ironic since Pink's started  disappointed Pink's would even lend brand poseur lacks awesome HOT dogs charm nostalgia location vantage obviously patrons swarming original dinky shack  <EOR> Pink's becomes delicious late night especially Vegas dog full guacamole goodness  Add fries some chili good go! <EOR> Went Pink's weekend Oct 2nd   drinking empty stomach two friends decided Pink's before meeting rest friends club   sure group friends but few drinks before intermission greasy but quick food   good bad when comes writing reviews     We starving needed food asap   actually took cab PH sole purpose getting Pink's instead just eating something vicinity first spot next drinking spot because 2 nights eating expensive restaurants clubs losing money tables wanted eat something noteworthy but cheap     According friend born raised socal good original Cali   figured mind over matter slash original is always better duhhh situation   ordered bacon chili cheese dogs fries beer    other friend a newyorker thought good but agreed wasn't awesome   Considering acclamation Pink's receives born bred LA ers changed assumption decided probably better original stand LA   remember thinking wasn't amazing experience hoping bit disappointed lack snap dog itself   Also bit    much   feeling dog better snap before doused chili      That being said did enjoy experience there   exactly looking moment   buzzed looking eat something extremely unhealthy but tasty exactly got   I'd definitely try again because some reason think just off night   some strange concoction drinks before going all might completely head  <EOR> Holy Crap!

Costed $6 so  I'd know made actually    texture wise very hot doggy   Bummer dogs don't come side    wasn't spend $4 just some onion rings  But friend did chili fries which described covered low grade meat but delicious once you're drunk enough  Speaking drunk weekends open late 3 am perfect place drunk munchies!   What else? $20 bucket 5 beers mix match  <EOR> Not impressed  hollywood dog he Brooklyn pastrami   Price pretty expensive hotdogs  two mentioned above plus fries $22  Quality Pinks known more toppings actual hot dogs  pastrami very thin dry cheese Hollywood dog nacho cheese  Quantity decent sized portions  Atmosphere bit tacky celeb pics everywhere  Staff nice people  Probs won't back  <EOR> In all honesty no reason visit Pink's hot dogs  No reason if tourist assure wherever better hot dogs  especially if local no reason all when Buldogi's two different sides town    The quality dogs sub par toppings nothing brag either  price holy cow! Nothing merits price tag which way cannot found website  also trie dthe chili cheese fries which ok but then Buldogi's chili house there's really no comparison  <EOR> I'm almost embarrassed way devoured dog covered mushrooms swiss mayonnaise  Really rather disgusting  just GOOD though! couldn't help but shovel thing down record timing  also pleased quickness service despite massive crowd surrounding us    I only wish could dogs drunken night Atlanta   only sad part it  <EOR> Tried eat Gordon Ramsay Burgr but hour half wait   Pinks right around corner decided quick lunch   5 other people    I ordered polish bacon burrito   polish sausage okay skin tough   liked bacon chili but very very very greasy   tortilla soaked dripping grease disgusting   others ordered chili bacon dogs no tortilla still really greasy   Reuben dog ordered looked good   regular hot dog didnt really all much flavor nothing special   fries thin cut crispy    I probably won't back nothing really special different dogs  <EOR> Pink's Hot Dogs favorite hot dogs! nice able grab Vegas during late night  pretty comparable original Hollywood  Same great hot dog same great chili same great kraut same great fries    I wish celebrity names associated Vegas help order! no clue comes mine but know Rosie O'Donnell  guess try up    chilli sour kraut   not sure else?

YES <EOR> I came dinner last Saturday before watching movie Regal other side Casino   LA original Pinks initial feelings bit mixed but decided give go       We hour before movie started figured plenty time enjoy meal   nice bonus location able sit around edge restaurant watch college football sports betting area   hoping Rival College team would lose but guess wishing ill team   even rivals   If half stars would given Pink's 3 5 but rounded down couple reasons   reasons speed service left bit desired   pretty busy Saturday night only two people working one kitchen register service slow   part thought menu items little over priced   but rounded down more slow service  Now important part food The Las Vegas hot dog Came cheese chili jalapenos guacamole two hot dogs   definitely better two dogs tried   little less $7   Really though chill cheese hot dog   everything else just bonus   The Spicy Mojave sauerkraut extra sauerkraut definitely saved hot dog   just didn't seem much without especially almost $7     Chili Cheese Fries think highlight meal   great portion chili cheese   fries perfect   little thicker pencil crispy outside soft inside   If looking some comfort fast food while watching game   or many games once   this could fun spot hit  <EOR> I Pinks few times Los Angeles but first time Vegas  Compared back home which LA think choose LA  But since boyfriend never Pinks location decided pop Pinks hot dog cherry  WHOA sounded little inappropriate lol  But goes My boyfriend ordered Planet Hollywood dog which loaded bacon cheese mushroom err did mention bacon?! ordered pastrami Britain dog which just regular hot dog Swiss cheese pastrami  Holy moly planet Hollywood dog monstrous compared pastrami dog  If put then next each other looks umm know evolving  Boy becomes man  Haha  Since polish dog bacon overload much buns looked quite messy  Well two hot dogs side fries coke    total $18  Bull!  Pros short line    Fast food addicting fries onion rings good portion    Very filling especially fries opens late good clubbing unless you're fatty wants midnight dinner err snack   they sell jello shots here  Cons even though line short boring  rush excitement where see people all hyped order ton food end finishing it very greasy    Made buns soggy overpriced hot dogs Costco only $1 50 free drink outdoor seatings only my boyfriend wasnt satisfied made look bad  take LA <EOR> I love hot dogs just hassle find place park then walk <EOR> LAME      As hot dog connoisseur pissed came here  Mainly because hyped much did deliver slightest    Compared Capital Dawg Sacramento impressed    I ordered dog pastrami mustard  mustard all tasted pastrami weak hell  No salty goodness just sliced meat no flavor    What bummer  Guess stick Capital Dawg Costco fixes! <EOR> So first time having Pink's totally excited  ordered something pastrami cheese husband ordered chili bacon also coleslaw onion rings   dogs weren't impressive  Hubz said chili thick pastrami dog wasn't extravagant thought would be   Onion rings good coleslaw alright   Staff friendly food fairly quick   Only seating area eat outside but luckily heaters  Glad try but doubt plan coming back    BTW park Planet Hollywood garage if you're going drive then walk through casino outside  <EOR> I chili cheese fries because wanted something pricey nothing couldn't finish  don't any indoor seating sit outside which found small table corner away drunks Las Vegas  Only problem Rap music LOUD   all played rap music  friend sat silence because couldn't hear each other when would try talk    The fries good but little greesy side  price fries good only being 5 dollars  Next time would try hot dog but maybe take since music would drive crazy  <EOR> I've two separate occasions ordered Mel B Kim Kardashian  Both just OK hot dogs themselves pretty small ended 1 2 bun left  flavors toppings creative but should beef hot dog portion size itself  burgers also very bland plain    worth money  don't think coming back again especially many other *better* food choices for example Earl Sandwich which just hop skip and jump away PH   <EOR> I love fries! think back place fries alone! main entree didn't think anything special I burger because don't hot dogs   hamburger huge though! if want more bang for your buck skip dogs beef!   I agree place overprice  <EOR> The food decent but price environment wasn't really worth it  order your food inside pick your food but all seating outdoors not really clean especially if birds flying    The portions good but place many toppings hot dog can't really eat regular hot dog  probably use fork knife brush off some toppings  food good but nothing extraordinary  <EOR> Any hotdog imaginable fantastic cheese fries delicious drinks  Nice view patio located close Planet Hollywood  returning <EOR> As native Chicagoan am thoroughly biased when comes encased meats  being said hot dogs Pink's creative ish but creative  There's actual nothing really special hot dogs except fact big covered chili  But staple Vegas restaurant strip give shot!

My friend decided order 2 different specialty dogs split could 2 kinds  ordered Mushroom Swiss Dog Planet Hollywood Dog  Mushroom Swiss Dog bit lighter side compared other specialty dogs   big bacon person which Planet Hollywood Dog but quite appetizing  However huge fills really quick    Seating outside under umbrellas  kinda nice since shaded area   Customer service good   Pink's Hot Dogs good but sure if I'd spend  much hot dog again  Worth try though! <EOR> I PH Hotdog pretty good   loaded w bacon grilled onions nacho cheese some mushrooms   nacho cheese kinda masked taste polish sausage think next time w just light amount cheese   hotdog itself pretty huge to point almost difficult eat lol    price tag reasonable $9 felt decent deal   My buddies ordered some weird stuff hotdogs wrapped tortillas actual burritos   I'd pass weird stuff didn't look good   If coming Pinks then order hot dog don't order weird stuff    ordering burger Taco joint lol    TIP  Grab FAT TUESDAY just same shopping plaza PH!

Everything made order which nice ordered Bacon Chili Cheese Dog side Onion Rings  bacon crisp chili nice meaty but cheese seemed liquid nacho cheese   however onion rings fresh    My friend's tried Planet Hollywood Dog enjoyed well  <EOR> So girlfriend planned Vegas birthday trip group friends weekend back January  time City Center just barely opened staying Aria Sky Suites  Sky Suites Aria blew away AMAZING!!! But  another review    Anyway morning arrived decided leave comfy suite Aria take stroll down strip  Being January still winter stupid brought thin ass jacket wear course did nothing keep warm    As walk across street City Center into Planet Hollywood see some people walking into Pink's Hot Dogs  since all freezing cold hungry decided rush door order some hot dogs!  Let something clear We're LA folk love heading down La Brea Ave LA Pink's hot dog late night leaving clubs  imagine excitement stepped through door cold  gearing order myself Martha Stewart dog but sadly don't offer location  Ok big deal  order whatever menu  think Holly Madison    Insert sad face  long story short did please me    I don't care condiments sides came damn hot dog when bit into thing wanted spit right out  know Pink's hot dog tastes Pink's hot dog  soft mushy didn't firm juicy texture accustomed Pink's LA  firmly believe if you're going call yourself Pink's Hot Dogs better serve Pink's Hot Dogs!   Am being bit overdramatic? Maybe  But think this    if walked into McDonald's ordered Big Mac but ended looking tasting something came elementary school cafeteria? back some fat guy's ass? then? would rather pass bosom obese woman three eyes large breast little breast tentacle hanging double chin eat another those things    If beer gambling would done nothing entire weekend Vegas but complain same  since Vegas sober say anyway      IT'S SAME!! <EOR> I enjoy coming Pinks several times year  love use Polish weenies  If order specialty dog quite large  could easily fill up  also love chili cheese fries delux style includes onions tomato sour cream   only outdoor seating if summer uncomfortable  Also am Coca Cola lover only sell Pepsi products  Aside enjoy coming here  seating faces strip view Aria hotel people watch  gave 4 stars instead 5 because price little high  paid $32 two specialty dogs delux chili cheese fries which small 2 drinks  recommend trying place least once  <EOR> Curious Pink's compares LA location waited line half hour only to    devour Polish hot dog 2 minutes  If sign Planet Hollywood's rewards card booklet chock full coupons which 10% off Pink's  course used barely made dent into final price   The hot dog okay filled overflowing toppings  thing caught surprise tough bite through chew through outside casing  mean heard hot dogs having good snap but getting little ridiculous  might chipped tooth eating hot dog  would first   Overall really worth wait any kind  If really want try Pink's hot dog all means ahead  But if you're itching snack tie over until next buffet gorge fest suggest heading over Earl Sandwich inside casino  Cheaper prices far more satisfying not mention healthier options  <EOR> Almost good Pink's LA     Almost  The Pink's Planet Hollywood does cake original Pink's Los Angeles  record cake made scratch box according dad  isn't skinny knows thing two cake  But doesn't matter because NO cake Pink's Vegas   I don't know why people questioning price? same hot dogs polish sausages Costco!
