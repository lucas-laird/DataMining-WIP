Food fairly priced burger place Vegas    The complaint staff  whole trip until point everywhere everyone super friendly personable except place  wait seated no hostess sight told someone would soon being seated gentleman stepped take order since waitress behind  He nice  He did mention wait bar drinks when bartender gets back     he seemed almost confused where bartender went  But overall didn't wait long drinks    Our actual waitress she basically talked passing without stopping never even name took forever run payment bring back card  No smile no thank no nothing her  She seemed she overworked many tables perhaps new job? Overwhelmed guess    As walking walked right past woman hostess station she completely ignored us  good night  thank would much better way treat your customers customer service   For most part food crappy service  I'd hate see staff handles busy restaurant  <EOR> This place loud dirty smoky dirty disgusting  group showed nice restaurant two steaks bottle wine place looks all  decided try any   Went asked person seating if could sit away stage because loud he said going just loud there  Then proceeded sit few tables back stage  Then he came back tossed menu table walked away  After waiting twenty minutes without being acknowledged no water no bothering take order left   Worst experience Las Vegas trip  <EOR> Absolutely love place  always stay Circus Circus when come Vegas place huge reason why  Great food main recomdations are Mac Cheese Burger EGG Your Burger Loaded Fries  Very well priced bar prices average but staff keeps coming back  most recent trip  give shout Tito Lauren  2 phenomenal individuals great customer service  Really helped great time while there  all 4 nights trip huge reason why  2 fun individuals really know guests feel great  <EOR> We came because wanted something munch saw karaoke  ordered nachos side fries  cool because sing karaoke but nachos ok enough chips cheese price should hooked up  husband said Dennis nachos 10 times better  brought steak fries not fav should mention steak fries because didn't super greasy fresh  tired big deal plus kid wanted sing karaoke  Oh waiter friendliest  <EOR> Went breakfast  Steak eggs rockin  Chicken fried steak eggs fresh still crispy  Coffee delicious  service good  prices right  Also snuck little bit last night  There's karaoke seemed really good time based crowd response  wouldn't drive Circus Circus just eat but if stay next time def visit Tatuado again  <EOR> You pay didnt pay much  bought groupon   on sale  food mediocre  Jorge never asked drinks food wine were  None good  But fact jorge never even introduced himself    Was manager there? If he wasn't touching tables   The wine list laughable   We could hardly wait finish leave  locals won't back  <EOR> For starters all seat cushions extremely worn point uncomfortable felt tilted falling whole time    Their water tasted drinking sand  Super gritty just disgusting  order bottle water!! Which listed $2 50 menu but charged $3 50 saw bill   Our waitress Elizabeth gave menus waters  Then she disappeared awhile different waitress w black hair pulled into tight ponytail came took orders told she'd helping Elizabeth table    We ordered Spinach Artichoke Dip appetizer  took awhile come wasn't awesome  way huge artichoke hearts barely any dip!  I ordered Wild Side BBQ bacon burger boyfriend ordered Ulcerator burger  came right right appetizer  Annoying   I asked Wild Side BBQ bacon burger no cheese  came absolutely nothing it???  Just plain burger    even BBQ sauce bacon    just plain!! food runner just dropped food off walked away didn't even time tell wrong  waited around looking least waitresses couldn't find her  nice lady sitting table next asked wrong told she even tried help flag down waitress  Finally hostess something Elizabeth  told Elizabeth wasn't ordered  told wanted Wild Side BBQ burger w everything else just no cheese! She took burger just sitting table untouched waited around someone could inform mistake    She came back literally 2 seconds some old stale bacon mess old onion strings cold BBQ sauce said some reason thought wanted nothing burger     now why world would order Wild Side BBQ burger if wanted nothing it???   I took few bites already knew hated first bite but wanted eat hungry  3rd bite put down  tasted eating cube ice  Everything hard cold      Again    Elizabeth nowhere found  busser noticed unhappy he asked wrong  told he grab waitress black ponytail  She came back super apologetic she asked if wanted something else but just wanted money back because didn't want wait another shitty meal here  she took plate away Elizabeth comes asks burger still wasn't wanted? tell wanted just really nasty she rolled eyes shrugged shoulders just WALKED AWAY! Wow right? No apologies nothing    We RARELY ever complain ask refunds but time to    The manager also came asked if we'd replace entree remove bill  told remove bill   My boyfriend's Ulcerator burger came correctly first time  But super skimpy fries less 10 fries came plate!! personally didn't burger looked sounded should packed flavor but just wasn't  just tasted ham dry meat    At least refunded me  really glad girl black ponytail helping Elizabeth because if she only waitress sure wouldn't gotten any service all  wish remembered other girl's name because she really wonderful   I still hungry but scared restaurants deli Circus Circus but knew Auntie Anne's wouldn't let down dinner wanted try place but instead ate PRETZEL Auntie Anne's way place!

When first arrived no host ess booth but man dressed suit tie presumably manager seated within two minutes arriving door  guy treated well checked often definitely deserves credit efforts  Sadly restaurant short staffed did see many other employees around most dining experience  few people dealt treated well but even when time bill actually ask someone bring it   The biggest issue dining upon being given menu server told the entrees available lunch  other words good majority major menu items including several wanted try available  only would having more items available made better dining experience also would gotten more money me! But seriously hard would separate lunch menu least SOME entree choices?  Music playing speakers televisions throughout meal just hard rock would expect vintage pop songs well Beatles Michael Jackson etc  manager guy said heavier stuff plays later evening understandable enough  also live stage set though no live entertainment playing time visit   Contrary other reviews stated no problem food whatsoever  order chicken fingers fries  fingers meaty crispy no tough meat whatsoever  fries very crispy cooked well  Everything ate delicious though would liked able taste entrees supposedly only available come dinner time   Overall visit Vince Neil's restaurant good just great one  am going park parking garage Circus Circus fight way through casino again purpose eating but if am casino again any reason would willing dine again  If visiting Circus Circus area anyway recommend dining just keep your expectations check  Overall give Tatuado modest recommendation  <EOR> Do eat here  food horrible! didn't high expectations expecting food along lines Hard Rock but place should closed down  part meatloaf sandwich part burger mac cheese top  Neither any flavor   buns fries stale  <EOR> Just finished eating here  bought groupon two steak plates wine included  Seriously good  really steak  literally butter melt your mouth  Definitely going back <EOR> Have ever wondered might eat ash tray?   felt here!  certainly capture dank rocker garage feeling which anything want when eating     The food very average service lacking   did enjoy walking around seeing all Vince Neil Motley Crew paraphernalia   daughter cold corn dog need say more?

He say's kidding me? No doesn't  he said he going ask bartender he took rest parties drink over heard asking bartender if he Mojito looked face he being spoke foreign language he couldn't understand then said don't know to   Well friend see probably won't move place knowing generic drink Mojito is   Well enough horrible scene food food overcooked just horrible  chicken burrito which prepared sick  party also ordered three burgers which overcooked bad   Then finally fried chicken actually decent   But Vince Neil needs kicked balls horrible restaurant giving crap restaurant  <EOR> Perhaps set expectations bit high Vegas hotel eateries perhaps place just sucks  friend visiting Vegas staying Circus Circus hotel when dinner plans suddenly cancelled  Hungry tired searching settled just eating hotel  First live music which expected Motley Crue restaurant  expected man leather chaps cowboy hat belting country music  sure many patrons would love setup however friend despise country music equivalent sitting right gates hell  Seeing pretty late anticipated wouldn't long stuck out  Mac cheese which took waaaaay long come out  waited while server even come table able order immediately when he first arrived then waited additional 45 minutes food  bacon Mac cheese way salty plate hot if just thrown microwave cheese looked sitting while  appetizing all  total three encounters server once order when he brought food when asked check   In summary long waits terrible atmosphere sub par service disgusting food  <EOR> I give place star would really half star if option that! Why because food grossly deplorable!!! service OK  We last night prior fright dome all say better food home! good!
