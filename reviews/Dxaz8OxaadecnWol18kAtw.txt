Now don't mind spending money meal if food presentation service great but wasn't really happy when left   service rushed she didn't really listen plus she kept telling probably enough food which felt she didn't time us    Maybe she just wanted leave   helped another man dressed chef coat chef but helping he said he very personable helpful more server was   She kinda disappear towards end   I high expectations restaurant Bellagio highly disappointed   Food ok   service lacking    and food presentation pretty plain   Prices should much lower quality everything     Even sushi roll between 20 30 which fine exceptional   If you're looking delicious Asian food Andreas Wynn chada Thai near China town great pay for! <EOR> One star nice bartender took care tonight   Other yelpers problem service but didn't   problem food   When sushi expensive expect really good   ordered Ikura Japanese scallop yellowtail sushi    Each piece very smail which fair more traditional but when consider each order $9 00 $11 00 $12 kind want teeny bit more substance   If substance then least some kind special preparation   Small portiions even forgivable if fish die for   yellowtail virtually no flavor weird right?   Even bad yellowtail tastes well bad yellowtail   just void anything   scallops wet mushy Ikura just okay kind fishy even salmon eggs which love order all time     also ordered eggplant skewers   so so    cut eggplant into small cubes skewered them supposedly grilled them then slopped sweet sauce usually see eel sushi   a totally forgetable dish   But worst offender evening Yellowtail's 'signature' cut rolls spicy crab asparagus green bean are ready? pop rocks   try just goof   But before diving asked nice barternder server if roll mayo because fan   She said could without    arrives looks your basic california roll   When tasted wasn't spicy pop rocks just don't work   fact ridiculous   like chef high mind night said hey! let's stick some candy sushi roll see many suckers pay $16 00 it!!    Dinner non alcoholic beer cost $79 00   Granted Bellagio should expected happy pay something worth money   But waste money calories time   Don't here    hotel many great places eat   Don't squander your meals here  <EOR> I'm aware Vegas but more overpriced places here  won't say tuna sushi pizza wasn't good because really delicious as anything truffles but digress   But only menu items less $15 salads which small  $15 20 items sushi rolls which really better described rice rolls faintest essence fish them  everything else sushi pizza included $30+ including appetizers  Save your money    <EOR> Mediocre best! high hopes while Vegas walked into packed restaurant which thought meant food delicious   WRONG  Everything menu WAY overpriced food you're getting  Rock Shrimp AKA Shrimp popcorn very sugary lacked any flavor outside overly crusty sugary flavor  Duck prosciutto even just super salty duck without much bring flavor  Any sushi roll $15 MORE regular sushi  eaten many many sushi places don't mind spending money GOOD food but if you're looking spend money would much rather Nobu Vegas  menu lacked uniqueness intriguing dishes  Flavor palette boring lack luster  <EOR> If could give no stars would  staying hotel wanted grab some sushi   The lady greeted spoke disdainfully horrified!

When said yes he actually hostess stand behalf  sure did much but appreciative all same   After waiting 45 minutes 1 3 empty restaurant finally seated  decor place nice give that  few redeeming qualities Yellowtail   We're seated window facing fountain show outside Bellagio  Nice setting  Unfortunately things down there   We ask start some edamame King Crab Dynamite starter  Then order couple different rolls few types nigiri sushi  starter arrives the edamame never actually showed within 2 minutes all rolls sushi table  Shouldn't least 5 10 minutes minimum eat your starter before rest your meal being hustled table? restaurant point probably 1 2 empty   wasn't turn over table quickly other waiting guests   It's even worth rehashing exactly type rolls sushi ordered because all pretty poor crab starter  quality fish equal those pre packaged Safeway sushi trays  No lie same level  Certainly expected given decor restaurant exorbitant prices  ready drop some $$$ good meal  certainly dropped $$$ but Yellowtail didn't deliver good meal   2 Large Sapporo's 2 glasses champagne $30 total King Crab Starter 2 rolls 6 total pieces Nigiri cost $170!! $170 left hungry   My advice anyone thinking going Yellowtail    instead Safeway buy few those pre packaged sushi trays 6 pack Sapporo bottle champagne take back your room  Same quality food complete effect even yourself wait 45 minutes eat it  best part you'll extra $120 your pocket spend Vegas  <EOR> Dined yellowtail few days ago most amazing time  server Tammy helpful knowledgeable menu  She directed into ordering tuna pizza which most delicious thing ever eaten  also lobster carpaccio filet toban  also divine droplet sake amazing! sure eat yellowtail if vegas ask Tammy! definitely enjoy your experience!

Wrong   We Big Eye Tuna Pizza Yellowtail Jalapeno Tempura Alaskan King Crab which supposedly highly praised Food Network    liked tuna pizza but mostly because liked truffle oil   yellowtail tasted odd but could fan orange flavored things sitting blood orange sauce   Meh think just me   high hopes crab tempura given waiter's high praise but lackluster did wow all   Tasted exactly sounds like  What's Food Network?  thought supposed good!  Given lackluster appetizers hoping entrees would it   taste High Steak Roll Crispy Kalbi Roll Jidori Chicken again    lackluster  c  could only taste A 1 sauce steak roll mostly only mayo coleslaw kalbi roll   rolls overly sauced making hard even taste anything else!  Luckily chicken bad actually quite tasty tender   Thank goodness  But despite chicken didn't save place mediocre food long wait times!    Throughout dinner everyone's food came various times two people would food while other ten would sit waiting   then another person gets food 15 minutes later while other nine sit waiting   then another two people would food 15 minutes later while other seven eight people would sit waiting    idea   time everyone's food came decided order dessert took another half hour before brought out!  point where almost wanted just call quits pay just leave   having dessert wasn't even worth time spent waiting    sigh   made wait much more terrible  c  resulted 3 5+ hour $$$$ mediocre dinner  c  Lots thumbs down   Waste time money if ask me  <EOR> I've eaten 3 times all 3 times very happy meal    The first two visits just normal dinners little pricey but felt worth food ambiance experience    My most recent visit little ridiculous because friend pretty big gambler group 5 extremely extravagant meal thanks him  best part literally tried just everything menu    Our flight Vegas 9 villa 915 called asked 36 oysters ready because starving  When arrived sat right away oysters ready minutes! delicious ordered second batch    All sushi fresh delicious you see pictures posted lobster really amazing I actually don't even lobster begin pleasantly surprised when going back seconds Even lobster tempura good literally melts your mouth    We also most AMAZING bottle wine  $1700 normally would never but since casino's dime why not? think called Montrachet I posted picture bottle incase wanted try it but most expensive white wine had    We also tried everything desert menu crazy sweets but ice cream pretty bomb    It fun experience honestly overpriced pricey but you're Vegas Bellagio expect? killer view if you're seated near balcony let loose some FUN! <EOR> Japanese Fusion Place  noisy actually really noisy sitting some loud chatterboxes     Alaskian Tempura $23 pretty good  Small portion but good   Seafood Hot Plate Yuck   too oily creamy     Tako cut off bumps chewier  Halibut Sashami 2 small pieces okay  Baked Crab Roll TONS mayo   nothing special felt eating California Roll but MORE MORE mayo    The only thing really good tempura  Other average  <EOR> Horiable service  8pm reservation did seated until 9  Waitress slow helpful all  Waited another hour food  Sushi no flavor  Extremely over priced food service  second time happened am all done going here  town built service place major fail <EOR> We hanging Bellagio waiting O start decided some dinner  much contemplation finally decided some sushi Yellowtail   The decor inside restaurant amazing!

During last trip Vegas friends checked Yellowtail tried following menu items Big eye tuna pizza WOW    good   loved contrast between soft tuna crunchy pizza crust  Kumamoto oysters super fresh perfectly scrumptious  Kobe beef tataki melted mouth  Yellowtail tataki King crab tempura Popping spicy crab roll yummy popping candy definitely nice surprise! Unagi roll  Yellowtail's menu definitely most creative innovative ones seen   love everything menu unique    wish could've tried all   Plus ambiance fun trendy service great     I can't wait back! <EOR> Trendy trendy oh trendy  Yellowtail greets scantily clad exotic waitresses Vegas all eat your small portioned Japanese gastro pub dishes while endless techno club music pounds background  While eating Japanese food manner isn't really style holding conversation table larger two rather difficult Yellowtail did leave tastebuds popping pleasure few select dishes  minus food took while come out  truly kind place which view Bellagio fountain show  balcony watch you're side Bellagio right action could feel slight mist shooting water!  My favorites Seaweed salad seaweed fresh two different kinds sauce tangy refreshing   Salmon sweet shrimp sashimi salmon more expensive cut usually darker orange salmon more punchy flavor  sweeter ones but shrimp fresh  heads fried perfection could eat 100% fried shell  Crunchy!  Big eye tuna pizza Now here's something innovative unique  You're getting fusion cuisine its best thinly slice tuna sashimi laid top thin cracker style crust truffle flavors small garnish tying all together savory finish  wonderful surprise really umami on  loved pairing truffle tuna sashimi crunchy texture crust offset soft raw fish   Protein roll tried few rolls far head class  called protein roll because there's no rice! well seasoned seafood fish egg mix wrapped inside layers fresh sashimi  roll disappeared seconds party didn't even try piece! Oops   Other things tried The Kobe beef tataki pretty good texture raw beef phenomenal fresh Kobe could see delicate marbling meat  However seemed waste drown soy sauce based sauce raw garlic slices garnish since both very strong flavors high quality beef should worshipped instead overpowered   The Alaskan king crab tempura apparently featured Best Things Ever Ate Chopsticks  thought good sauce savory tangy but didn't seem anything special enough TV show  could something fried bad? Seems shame fresh crab   We tried some other rolls but none else memorable  vegetable tempura nothing special rock shrimp tempura mayo y spicy sauce good but something seriously upscale Buffalo Wild Wings  <EOR> I've two times  first best experience  waiter personable just great  way provide amazing experience  second time waitress ok but no where accommodating first  Still both times food excellent  watching fountain show while having dinner awesome <EOR> Home three dollar tip  If paying Vegas prices want no limit hours something served  if want sushi restaurant located lobby Bellagio should served all night until eleven PM  11 PM?! Really? Because Vegas local most likely just getting show then maybe 1 4 way into night  Serve sushi all night   it's good business model   However if serve sushi don't put white onion it  totally gross  Maybe chef playing joke us   Dinner two $80 including horrible plate mushrooms sauce tasted something high school cafeteria weird onion roll something tempura'd which never wrong    Also server insisted reaching table maneuvering through tiny gap between left shoulder wall  someone sneaking only bringing chopsticks    I'm sure fun place drink we weren't given drink menu but vodka tonics watered down    Eh when convenience Vegas  <EOR> I've always loved yellowtail    Just yellowtail prices  admit visit most expensive bill had    But also covering birthday girl  10 girls     $959 double damn being said     server  Emmanuel very attentive  He asked once name if waiting birthday girl  he knew she was    He kept calling name all night  Even snuck dessert menu over while she bathroom break! He's good    Really good! stuck trying figure he bathroom queue  Lmao   Right away ordered edamame which wanted both bowls sweet chili instead sea salt the best way order them     There few things table    Let's see if remember them all      My favorite roll high steaks! shrimp tempura roll topped filet mignon A1 sauce  interesting combination    But good one    Mushroom side     much flavor!!!!   Rock shrimp little dry  good Nobu  Chilean Sea bass great tasting    Small serving    Nope barely remember anything else I lot drink but post pictures!   Just sure when come bring both your wallets because won't cheap night out  Also if you're big group don't split checks    even three ways!!!! <EOR> There pop rocks popping spicy crab roll literally popped mouth   POP ROCKS really!

Tuna Tataki  4 stars    Every time visit Yellowtail always order this  think because simple but luxurious quality taste   Plus see each individual slice inspect its quality while admiring its beauty     I am Hawaii where Ahi KING!  But say tuna tataki light subtle silky texture  nice firm fish melts contact tongue  Surprisingly great quality tuna restaurant middle dessert!!  While Chef Back's sushi rolls fun try come enjoy semi naked fish basking all its glory    pool spicy mustard sauce   Delicious last bite!  I order when wicked bad cravings ahi Hawaii   This tuna tataki hook line sinker    Duck Prosciutto  4 5 stars    Perhaps love dish because rarely find any menu?!  Of few places duck prosciutto Yellowtail favorite place it!  The fatty salty curing duck breasts through them all more delectable    Yellowtail's version isn't gamey all  Just deli thin slice duck which delicious ice cold beer!!  The saltiness addicting micro beets give duck lightly floral flavor while adding nice crunchiness   I love rolling greens into each individual slice duck eating roll   This dish really entices back Yellowtail all years  Maybe best world but best thus far!

The ambience fantastic  restaurant beautiful but little smaller then expected  rainy windy day balcony closed but seat right next window could see Bellagio fountain show very easily    As service    didn't really server  felt he ignoring rushing away when trying talk ask something    All all would definitely again when some extra money splurge dinner  <EOR> I made reservations wife read opportunity fine Asian fare overlooking Bellagio fountain   shown ideal little patio table overlooking fountain   evening weather perfect  both high spirits   could wrong?  all food all drink      We started evening $20 cocktails   let decide whether would considered overpriced    Mine OK but wife's choice vodka spicy pepper strawberry puree   sour call over waiter ask if supposed so   He said no sweetness strawberry puree supposed compliment spicy pepper flavor   He returned bartender then made better tasting one   Well minor slip $20 drink but stuff happens right?  We ordered chef's tasting menu paired various sake tastings   Before could even take two sips pre dinner cocktails food runners kitchen started dropping plates food front race through dinner   ignored food while enjoyed cocktails looking over fountain Las Vegas Boulevard   asked waiter slow down   Ultimately begged just stop completely     The chef's tasting menu supposed six courses dessert   made through three courses before told waiter just stop   chef embarrassing himself   Each course worse last   first course kind sashimi pizza   consisted four minuscule paper thin pieces fish communion wafer truffle oil drizzled top   waiter said signature dish   wife tasted said communion wafer burnt   Jove she right   apparently over toasted them all could taste oil burnt cracker   Oh OK drink bad first course disappointing but great view   would certainly better right?

The food 1  tuna pizza pretty good  Bread tuna sad  But hey shows chef knife skills cut fish thin! 2  King crab tempera chopped deep fried  Small portion but good flavor  3  Salmon roll  Same any roll sushi place  But double price    Would come again?

Also clearly timing issues dishes came two time   large party some people watch others eat   just amazed dropped off food since large party took while determine ordered it     waiter pretty clueless also! food itself pricy yet decent  edamame good well seasoned   Besides definitely worth it   would only again if forced to    If definitely visit other sushi places strip!! <EOR> Was LV work trip group opportunity sit outside terrace! view incredible food equally great!  Highly highly recommend big eye tuna pizza may sound strange sushi restaurant but man hit! Great assortment sushi sashimi   For fun also recommend popping spicy crab roll features some pop rocks! <EOR> wtf hype   waiter food sound lot more interesting then really is   portions SMALL heck amount money pay   Ok really case quality over quantity but quality barely justify cost   If seating night try request sit outside   You'll able see Paris's Eiffel tower across way water show   mostly come view but don't come starving!!

We greeted personally Chef Akira Back offered bring all personal favorites menu glad he did   Everything mouthwateringly delicious but 3 must haves Tuna pizza don't ask just eat truffle oil!   Baked crab roll melts your mouth better chocolate Tempura crab why wouldn't order that?!  Extra tip sommelier help sake pairings she'll even tell which ones good your skin!

Why would he place MANY orders once?  The service completely ruined faith Yellowtail  Between being shoved back having wait forever refills drinks experience waiter knew he ordered much food expensive group 20 22 year olds professor likely because automatic gratuity don't know if return  If your waiter tall man glasses closely cropped hair let order your group   If despite reading treat customers decide est Yellowtail anyway give tuna pizza try  few other dishes slightly redeeming qualities restaurant but never forget way staff abused trust myself peers  <EOR> High end sushi higher end price   Check full review helpful photos http asupr us ap yellowtail  Yellowtail quite luxurious setting which quite fitting considering fact within grand Bellagio casino   decor upscale but trendy same time   addition extravagant decor inside Yellowtail you're also spoiled absolutely breathtaking view famous Fountains Bellagio   First off acknowledge eating Yellowtail comes premium   already expected increase price eating Boston compared eating Vegas   those two factors mind still found prices little high side   Normally I'd fine paying premium high quality sushi but price Vegas sushi got    felt price paying more surroundings location   found dishes smaller size but all quality quantity   Still would liked little more bang buck  some rolls tried Big Eye Tuna Pizza Micro Shiso Truffle Oil Simply put thing amazing unique   stark contrast soft delicious tuna crunchy pizza crust   just all worked very clean flavors   Kobe Beef Tataki Spicy Daikon Garlic Maldon Sea Salt The Kobe Beef cut paper thin but combination crunch garlic sea salt dish sure winner   Melts your mouth   Tai Snapper Extra Virgin Olive Oil Shiso Tosazu The extra virgin olive oil dish divine   slight peppery taste gives snapper nice little kick   Excellent stuff   Toro Scallion Roll Blue Fin Tuna Belly Green Onion On small side but classic combination   Fish nice fresh rice perfect   Nothing special just very solid   Popping Spicy Crab Roll Cucumber Asparagus Pop Rocks Amazing unique roll   Yes description does say Pop Rocks   Most unique roll may ever had  <EOR> We walked Vdara eat Bellogio  thought eat Olive in Bellogio also but am Asian  decided Japanese  Tuna pizza disappointed only good seaweed salad  Service slow compared other restaurants Vegas  <EOR> Worst place ever!
