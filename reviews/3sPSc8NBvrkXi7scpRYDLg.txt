Very uncomfortable soon sat down could feel hard metal coil edge seat  I would seats replaced ASAP  Something decor just seemed thrown together tacky  Enough decor itself hole wall probably long time until afford renovate relocate    More importantly food which surprisingly good when good! AYCE $20 definitely deal  Proportionally though some things just didn't sit well palette biggest complaint would much salt seasoning far little     Ceviche instance bit salty point where didn't want finish starkly opposite everything else ordered   Salmon nigiri didn't thrill namely because both pieces sinew attached that slightly stringy part isn't suitable nigiri     Overall flavor just wasn't either      Soft shell crab great surprisingly few places seem right which first things ordered gave high expectations  crispy spinach undernearth paired well but unfortunately bit salty    Ordered few other rolls spider roll instance much cucumber which seemed marinated? taking away other flavors   Lemon Salmon roll lackluster lemon slices being far thick edible roll despite description recommendation Yelp    Some last rolls ordered some best   Master Payo Corn Crunchy Kitty   As far service would also probably rank around 2 3 stars well  While friendly attentive service just far slow especially only 2 tables total being served time   Simple things should come quickly  I E  order nigiri shouldn't come soft shelled crab  also put off bit limitations AYCE only being able order 1 each nigiri but luckily wasn't thrilled salmon order anymore? including dessert  But hey $20 anyhow  Also bring back those crepe dessert items! certainly sound delicious!  Just work making establishment bit nicer inside experiment more some lackluster rolls mentioned definitely return  Unfortunately doesn't Sushi Twister when comes service food decor moment however  <EOR> With many solid reviews ratings new management improvement really wish could give 3 5 stars but much hate give 3 stars solid 3 star establishment experience    So Yelp buddy mine Eddie seen reviews place mentioning let's give place try  Now live totally opposite side town but pictures reviews thought hey let's give shot    I'm type  turned off depending location plaza but all looks inside food  But $20 00  AYCE sushi interested place would turn out  walk surprised limited seating lack off decoration non matching tables chairs booth seatings could feel springs underneath    Being avid Yelper did yelp research place before coming knew place owned managed Japanese Asians matter wasn't startled when servers chefs Hispanic  did also seem more family owned run operated establishment  impressive    I bit confused beginning because hand written signs outside said AYCE sushi $19 99 but nothing stating if limitations AYCE menu if certain items only time order which some were chef server verbally let know AYCE specific limitations    I started sashimi orders ordering sashimi salad sashimi platter unagi nigiri nabeyiki tempura udon soft shell crab  platter thought really good light house onion sauce different twist reg soy ponzu sauce  sashimi salad very good! loved mango light citrus dressing salad! nice change sesame ginger dressing  salad spring mix compilation but definitely more greens sashimi  unagi nigiri pretty standard regards rice fish ratio  nabeyiki udon wasn't all great  disappointed  chicken udon seasoned way did compliment tempura udon broth  pretty much only ate noodles aged egg shrimp tempura  soft shell crab menu says laid bed greens but when order extremely surprised more another spring mix salad two very small soft shell crab pieces    Lots salad green fillers which beginning liked salad but now already over it    Next round ordered sashimi rice bowl again topped piled spring mix greens few sashimi rice buried underneath  Again salad again?! also ordered shabu shabu steak roll popcorn shrimp spicy tuna roll yellowtail Kama  ordered yellow tail special roll but forgot even bring out    The shabu shabu bland meat topped roll more chewy tender  popcorn shrimp roll nice kick enjoyed roll but point starting tap wasn't big deal forgotten yellowtail special roll  most disappointing yellowtail Kama asked cooked well done devouring crispy outsides once made more inside collar bone fish pink cooked  Luckily noticed before friend taken another bite    The chef came apologize treated dessert house strawberry mango mochi dessert included AYCE those course yummy any other mochi    I'm huge supporter local business being loyal customer but try objective honest yelp give audience full understand experience its entirety  think demographics may targeting but place lacks presentation comfortability me  AYCE menu little limited liking when know pay $3 more better quality experience  truly happy see other solid reviews loyal customers bad food all just AYCE sushi place choice me  see myself driving way across town when better quality elsewhere  terms all AYCE sushi places valley places stands solid 3  <EOR> In short food fine but service ambiance nonexistent  knowing should just fine  Arm yourself Groupon discount really won't mind   Walked staff watching TV dining room  walked abruptly shut off dispersed  sat sushi bar ordered two rolls miso soup  water but no soup  Chef made rolls made small talk  He friendly  Server took order rang said but two words never checked refilled drink brought soup    Menu standard Americanized rolls addition usual Philly Cali Dragon stuff few house rolls each around $10  Menu also offers AYCE kitchen items included addition sushi  some interesting options any roll into low carb cucumber roll riceless flat rate sushi burrito iceberg lettuce? Didn't opt try those items   The Julio Jr roll Chopped albacore green onions cucumber topped halibut cilantro jalapeño ponzu sauce fresh but didn't much ponzu sauce which probably would kicked flavors bit  Salmon Lemon roll Salmon tempura garlic aioli masago avocado asparagus topped salmon lemon ikura ponzu sauce decent even if combination tempura salmon fresh salmon new and odd me  Neither asparagus nor ikura much flavor    Can't say likely come back   wasn't even much lack service server turn off much overall careless attitude  No thanks  <EOR> The service really really super friendly prompt   That rest review really disappointing guess  finally found another place great service but into food likely wont return    I just having solo lunch before going grocery shopping next door  popped seated right away given water  given time check menu then checked fair amount time like said service good!     I ordered miso soup dragon roll  Pretty easy right?   The miso soup BLAND  Seriously barely any flavor weird texture it  could barely even drink broth    The dragon roll  Oh dragon roll  start roll done loosely falling apart every piece picked up  Annoying but worst thing ever  that     taste  Again much flavor other places maybe enough sauce top? could also because cut eel seemed really really cheap  mostly soggy slimy skin fat no actual eel meat  texture gross actually gagged couple times    Return customer? Unfortunately not  If just item both might willing return based service well but both food items striking out  Plus dragon roll all time favorite why would return less great taste when elsewhere great taste same price?  Prices reasonable average sushi  just didn't stand compared many other sushi joints  <EOR> I'm sorry agree everyone low review  see guys business long  came twice before posting review  Just case having bad day first time  only sushi item if its just order sushi item the lion add cream cream cheese it  fabulous! 5 star sushi BUT service does suck  don't believe mean mean but workers barely speak enough English customers asking  example would cup ICE  Yep hard across  Anyways leave alone feel totally ignored  forget getting refills because left alone   The part really turned off special   See feel specials meant bring back  perhaps entice order more different items because special awesome! Well chicken teriyaki special rice    more rice    rice again oh bit chicken teriyaki  little literally laughed say wait didn't order rice side teriyaki chicken  ordered teriyaki chicken  My BF diabetic frankly keep rice lol did give more chicken which plus but did really complaint first place? My suggestion if want teriyaki chicken? Lava Bowl literally 1 2 mile street Flamingo  teriyaki chicken only cheaper but more tastes better too   Sorry guys! Hopefully all honest reviews changes made your restaurant  <EOR> WORST SUSHI PLACE IVE EVER TO  sushi rolls good all  many sushi places Vegas just opened few months ago  explains why ZERO ppl eating when walked takeout  Should known  Never eating again  only positive review friendly staff  Super friendly nice! Maybe other rolls tasty but rolls blah  rolls literally falling apart rice fresh  <EOR> Just tried sushi very good  doubts first but proved wrong  would definitely come back  <EOR> Bait switch manager literally told bad kept interrupting menu where several items advertised then unavailable   They hand written sign window all eat $19 95  wife ngiri menu really small limited  told AYCE ngiri sashimi figured made limited selection  Once seated drinks served waiter then told orders limited single order each fish per person per type  each could order tuna sashimi order tuna ngiri    We already seated drinks figured deception unintentional  ordered sashimi when brought only 3 pieces but menu said 6 pieces per order  when waiter informed sashimi only 3 pieces when all eat   We should left but meal before show stuck figured we'd best it   The next surprise learning could both ngiri sashimi each fish  Instead now now learned  ngiri sashimi  if ordered tuna sashimi could then order tuna ngiri   To matters worse single chef service slow   How could worse? Two limited items jumbo scallops small scallops immediately available because frozen taken thawed  Another item menu snowcrab sushi which sounded great but told none available   By point done ordered all sushi could due single order limit   We ordered desert when bill learned desert included all eat  server told argued it  asked manager he told he manager  asked owner he told owner California good luck contacting him  He told pay desert if don't bad absolutely insane   I certainly never return place  <EOR> I'm going rate friendliness staff 4   very nice people   I'll rate actual service 3   Slow restaurant slow service   And sushi itself 2   being bit nice here   The sushi isn't fresh probably because place ghost town   asked sushi chef freshest fish he said all it   If  true none fresh standard because sampler plate salmon yellowtail tuna slimy gross   Service mediocre   keep asking stuff even though only three customers restaurant   Literally placed own beverage order speaking used plates kept stacking all way until end meal   They made mistake girlfriend's order no onions    she's allergic   They served 4 things didn't order which seems nice first until realize three them filler items including plate fried rice sushi concoction signature item sorts   tasty enough but need 6 8 pieces fried rice filler all eat meal?  The miso soup which didn't order although normal miso soup worst miso ever had   The ambiance place all off   Japanese decor entire staff speaking Spanish TV playing show COPS   just weird   no making statement people speaking Spanish simply saying all things combined made atmosphere restaurant feel bit off   Finally don't beer wine license further altering atmosphere   The sushi game town fiercely competitive place definitely work cut them   Unless things change major way can't find compelling reason ever back when many other places superior  <EOR> Went last week Groupon pleased     son all eat he own check due Groupon    He said food excellent    both salmon dishes which very tasty    Very clean every nice    Convenient location    definitely back  <EOR> I Hello Tokyo four times far 10 days must say best sushi ever had   traveled all over United States job sales manager simply best! excellent sushi rolls soups most pleasant customer service ever experienced life    STRONGLY recommend try them sometime  hidden treasures Las Vegas!!! <EOR> I freaking love place  probably best sushi Las Vegas outside super fancy place MGM Grand  prices better all them pieces fish large fresh tender perfect  rolls clever amazing  There's lot awesome food part town Hello Tokyo total gem  there's amazing Yelp check in deal too  <EOR> I 6 7 times  reason why keep coming back  staff super friendly professional  food WONDERFUL  price best town such consistent quality  here! won't regret it! <EOR> Amazing sushi sashimi  Everything tasted wonderful but rolls tad big  Good atmosphere friendly staff fast service clean bathroom  It's affordable don't feel work hard money's worth but don't let fool you  would still come if charged double  <EOR> OMG! reviewed place yet when come several times per month? bad   I absolutely love place  Yellowtail Special go to roll happiness  gentleman runs place absolutely masterful  fish selection top notch menu creative work he does them exquisite    Love place  <EOR> New owners place neighborhood super nice chef nice staff  far food quite good!
