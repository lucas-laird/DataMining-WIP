Coming Florida resident fresh off plane very hungry  very excited see location drive thru  But anyways      salad ugly wish took picture but really topped off quarter avocado put it!!! okay being charged  99 avocado but least give least half! say refund? Sheeesh together <EOR> I excited when found Panera opening closer house  going stop but son fell asleep car decided drive thru instead  to go containers here? sandwich wrapped paper only even covered all way  baguette just sitting paper bag  lady taking order gave food both extremely friendly but little disappointed food served   order take before other Panera's hasn't this  If waited until home sandwich might dried out  But because ate car little messy having anything containing food  Wonder would served soup if ordered that! <EOR> Ordered through rapid pick which supposed ready 2 09  When at 2 15 order isn't shelf man working informed would ready soon  Then few minutes call back tell bread choices sandwiches chose available wanted instead  Instead calling phone number provided waited until let know prepare food  ended having wait until 2 34 food where side bread sloppily thrown into bag  sure point rapid pick when isn't ready 5 10 minutes but instead almost 30  could just ordered food through drive thru would faster  returning Panera location  <EOR> I love food Panera  Only thing place slow service  Staff behind counter chit chats guests doesn't seem notice all people waiting line  seem always wait line during hour break always rushing eat back office  also ordered salad no cheese but some reason always add cheese always return food order corrected wait even longer  <EOR> This place awesome  used Panera farther away but new place great because there's convenient drive thru  soup sandwiches great healthy  also love customer service here  There's always friendly welcoming staff just st Starbucks  highly recommend Panera bread because if drive thru but all paneras fabulous  Great food customer service  bit pricey Starbucks but worth it  Enjoy great job Panerabread  <EOR> Some worst food really long time  ordered half cashew chicken salad yet didn't even cashew  chicken flavorless dressing cup less quarter full dressing  also ordered half turkey bacon avocado sandwich part outside avocado stem sandwich  Gross feeling bite down that  Plus half sandwich half salad drink cost almost $17!!! Don't waste your time money here! <EOR> I start saying love Panera Bread   happy when saw opening neck woods   awesome drive thru   usually order online quick pick option but even better   I recently breakfast first time loved four cheese quiche   daughter usual pumpkin muffin happily finished   know new but staff happy helpful   really hope staff keeps service newness restaurant wears off   Great food great service drive thru!! <EOR> I love Panera but really annoying   I order bagel toasted cream cheese gave those dumb plastic cream cheese  containers barely covers half bagel  nearly enough cream cheese myself  Einstein bagels trumps give lot more cream cheese you  Smh <EOR> We ordered lunch 8 people today spent $100   person bringing food didn't know sandwiches soups she bringing us   She just kept putting food table when asked she replied don't know  pry open different paninis figure which belonged whom   She did same 5 soups came out   tortilla soup actually COLD    even warm!  When told she said heat ourselves microwave!  never such terrible experience   Panera breakfast but it'll while before return!  just opened already slacking!!! <EOR> Seriously Panera!!!!!! waited half hour your drive thru line cup soup even hot $5 00  Chicken noodle never saw piece chicken  Did count noodles carrots???? Only saw three carrots  three bites bread last three bites ever Panera  Progresso soup cheaper could buy whole loaf banquette $1 00!!!!! <EOR> This nice modern location stopped quick breakfast kids   Nice selection pastries bagels scones muffins  croissant nice buttery  microwave warm up   Asiago cheese bagel yummy!! offered toast which great  Cream cheese add $1 40 bagel $1 39 which wired   pricey   Mango smoothie $4 69 tasted more plain yoghurt mango don't recommend  <EOR> So just little irritated say least!! Don't expect much when order phone such cleanliness great service because going inside really having any interaction employees! Now love Panera because soups sandwiches very good always great choices plus healthy choice over normal fast food !!   I would say could easy screw other online order very straightforward instructions order ! ordered soup salad two sandwiches! sandwich ham cheese nothing guess ? everything !! Please see attached photos! also missing other side chips !! <EOR> I few Panera breads around Las Vegas area but never received service great! location friend mine lunch right away greeted smiling faces  cashier Alex took order wearing pink shirt which loved but didn't notice she general manger!  ordered food which she helped decide suggested try chili which never end loving it! She kind she brought food continued check throughout time which thought incredibly nice! even noticed well she ran cafe staying top orders even going kitchen help very impressed! When finished meal waved over because wanted know name thank personally great customer service  when noticed she manger! often places 5star treatment manger! Usually back front looking over everyone else but Alex took time sure every customer well taken care another Panera! new rainbow location best!!! <EOR> Put order online     order ready right time Panera wasn't busy    manager double checked order wrong! order missing additional items paid just glancing bag even checking all items  co worker ordered completely separate online found additions paid salad! Neither salad croutons them lettuce good  excited opened nearby but drive extra distance Green Valley location now on  gave 2 stars because girl greets people nice  <EOR> My husband Pecan sticky bun very good  wasn't lunchtime yet but made available creamy chicken soup sourdough bread bowl  hit spot cold winter day  shortbread cookie mmmmm   Definitely come again  Fast welcoming service  Clean restaurant  could better? Add some television  Relaxing atmosphere quiet Sunday morning  <EOR> This location consistent other locations across country  If other Panera's know expect  decor little more updated compared some locations  <EOR> Update     no update  15 days later still haven't received refund  horrible management! <EOR> I pretty disappointed today when ordered food online selected rapid pickup  arrived grabbed bag obviously know now should've checked order before leaving    I ordered group size chicken rice  turkey wheat sandwich  Well home given chicken noodle soup  Which fine BUT literally all broth  no way share 4 servings because couple noodles chicken it  literally all broth  Then sandwich maybe two pieces turkey it  just thrown bread even spread out  Pretty disappointed  cost $24! Plus time gas grab lunch bc deliver mountains edge  called refunded but still  price pay horrible  going again  <EOR> I love Panera Bread but location messes order every time  won't back  last chance gave them order 2 Fuji apple chicken salads 2 bread soup bowls  kids love apple salad because apple chips top  When home instead apple chips sliced real bruised apples sliced thrown top  salads come side  chose bread each  Big surprise   no bread  2 bread bowls come side  chose bread again  But course no sign bread when home  positive manager filled order because sat waited pack before brought home  didn't check bag before left figuring manager would certain order correct  Nope  understand forgetting put sides bread but replacing rotten apple slices because no apple chips! Really? when manager saw salads he KNEW incorrect still handed without saying anything?? Poor  location worst every time!! No excuse! Panera's upper management really should step locations act together! <EOR> Unfortunately location serves ice cold meals  returning known meal would feel biting into ice cubes when order through drive thru then would them remake money back  husband love Panera but last few times should learned lesson returned sake spending $10 nastiness sandwich ever tasted  Coming woman hungry looking forward eating expensive fresh sandwich complete let down threw directly trash  no surprise when location closed down serving people everything but fresh food  all  <EOR> I eat soup always depend chicken noodle soup good turkey chili good onions cheese but corn getting way just little much corn  still order turkey chili hopefully consider little less corn  <EOR> The food great but customer service rewards program aren't best   If order Kiosk  fee medium coffee   give opportunity that  yet any thing rewards program  spend 20 00 month   seem very disorganized items bring ready  <EOR> I always loved place  menu atmosphere healthy options even much happier now finally expanding opened house  ordering system restaurant convenient delivery drive thru Panera bread exceptional place! <EOR> I come panera bread lunch break maybe more then should because love broccoli cheddar soup  Sadly time around cup received soup all over it  tried grilled cheese well tasted tad dry  <EOR> For record wife never bad experience Panera Bread past   But NEVER back location Rainbow Warm springs We recently visited Panera Bread South Rainbow casual dinner Saturday evening   walked no special expectation thinking would just any other visit    Unfortunately wrong   The first negative vibe happened cash register   noticed young man chatting joking customers before perfectly normal   However once wife stepped he gave blank stare failed utter any sort basic customer service greeting us   ignored silence said hello proceeded placing order   He seemed some difficulty managing POS system big deal  Although none 4 employees observed standing around throughout restaurant doing absolutely nothing way side helping out     Once found booth noticed pastry ordered given counter   decided wait employees deliver food which point would ask pastry   longer usual wait which interesting because more employees customers yet still wait long time food food brought kindly requested pastry brought well     The response received employee Sure but future reference supposed pick your pastry counter  thought unwarranted attitude she said such annoyance   Panera Bread plenty times before knew normally they'd give pastry front counter    if forgotten never big deal any server runner bring forgotten pastry table   wife really did appreciate attitude server   If anything comment should made employee manning front register remind them forget give customer pastries they've ordered   bad customer service   After 3 4 minutes employee finally returned pastry sourly asked if needed anything else   Once said okay she then proceeded head over kitchen talk laugh other employees duration stay   About half way through meal while managers leaning counter lobby texting phone heard argument erupt kitchen   employees distraught yelling profanities only assume another manager   employee removed uniform apparently quit spot far could tell   entire restaurant fell silent briefly tension filled air rest evening   As observed employees point all saw them doing laughing each other texting doing absolutely nothing work related  Managers again observed texting phones lobby doing nothing apologize customers disturbance   It also amazing sheer number employees working time versus amount customers restaurant   ratio wayyyy off   Whoever did work schedule certainly did job correctly   would also appear large amount employees break concurrently sitting eating socializing main dining area   strange because other restaurants if employees break eating would normally sitting away customers behaving such way would disturb customers   I managed restaurants past always great lengths ensure customer always pleasant experience if did would way ensure knew aware situation would everything could rectify bad experience encourage them return future   management team location did no such thing   most unprofessional dining experience ever would very surprised any current staff around much longer if reviews keep cropping up  <EOR> First time today  Cashier fast script ask repeated again then still couldn't understand she said nevermind   Food wasn't worth price  Soup tasted sandwich slapped together without care  <EOR> We pleased see them arrive close house!!
