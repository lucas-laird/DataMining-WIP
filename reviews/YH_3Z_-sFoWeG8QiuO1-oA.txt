Spring roll Nem nuong good but bit pricey  <EOR> I super excited hear Brodard's opening Vegas  most popular item nem nuong cuon which delicious especially paired special made sauce  When opened reported sister location Brodard hence different name  Being fan viet foods means bringing other types various viet cuisine aside usual pho    My friend came lunch break 30 minutes   quickly seated ordered  told waitress time crunch needed fast! Luckily did speed received food ate paid fairly quickly    We shared order nem nuong cuon com tam bi cha suon nuong   Nem Nuong Cuon grilled pork sausage spring roll $4 95 2 rolls when saw price bit surprised  If remembered correctly $1 50 roll Brodards  Ok maybe transporting fee something  When rolls came seemed smaller  Ok  Took bite  seemed similar but seemed something missing  When tried sauce surprised HOT sauce was  definitely dont recall sauce being hot  Luke warm warm most  Ok  Maybe just made sauce  sauce tastes completely different  really underwhelming  didnt those mysterious tangy bright flavors sauce Brodard had  Overall quite disappointing  May  Com tam bi cha suon nuong broken rice plate shredded pork egg meatloaf pork chop shrimp deep fried shrimp cake wrapped soybean curd $11 95 Overall decent size  kind fed two people  portion size pretty good   pork chop shrimp bit underwhelming  Need more seasoning  deep fried shrimp cake wrapped soybean curd pretty good  Freshly fried soybean curd skin nice crispy while shrimp cake still moist hot  Egg meatloaf pretty good  favorite viet foods    Overall food ok  Maybe hyped place bit disappointed when experienced it  Service overall decent  things good timely manner    Maybe give them few months speed maybe change bit  Hope better  Would really love different viet restaurant =P <EOR> Nem Nuong? better term delightful bites   Nom nuong! even better yet Nom nom nuong!! sure lot say spring rolls your life  But trust trying nem nuong here    never spring rolls yo life!!!  I've never Brodards Cali based spring roll institution which hear same owners Nem Nuong  seeing pics made Brodards famous check out   The restaurant really well designed  probably most upscale Vietnamese restaurant town  sitting down ordering food came reasonable time   Nem Nuong basically pork spring rolls  But run of the mill ones typically served  would comparing Little Ceasars pizza made Italian Michelin rated restaurant  think sets apart fried egg roll shell stuff inside roll  gives marvelous crunch!! wondering while eating why doesn't every place this? should law  enforce it    Judge Dredd  Because am law  pork generous piece really tender well seasoned  probably best bites all year! But hearing little bit overpriced compared Brodard's but  typical Vegas food compared So cal food   Bahn Xeo Now if guys know favorite Vietnamese food whole world pho but actually take Crepe  But French version  more giant omelet kinda stuffed seafood bean sprouts eat Korean ssam wrap lettuce mint sesame leaves pickled vegetables  thought OK  didn't blow away  inside seemed little bit pasty undercooked   I would come back try pho broken rice dishes  nem nuong legit would encourage everyone try out!  nem nem nem nem nem nem nem nem nem <EOR> Feels being back home little Saigon Orange County  probably try 3 times month  Nem nuong just brodard but prices scream Vegas  take here <EOR> We came Nem Nuong try famous Nem Nuong Rolls also curious try some other dishes featured Weekly Magazine   We ordered combination Pork Shrimp spring rolls both delicious! shrimp ones absolute favorite    generous size rolls stuffed yummy contents very tender pork Shrimp crispy eggroll    We tried Combination Pho Seafood Udon Soup Combination Rice Plate Pork Chop Grilled Shrimp Egg Loaf Tofu Skin which unfortunately did care for   Maybe different region seasoning am tasting but did care anything else tried except rolls     The place nice service very pleasant pricing fair but am pretty sure all stick when coming Nem Nuong's Rolls  could seriously meal just delicious rolls  <EOR> Whoohoo!
