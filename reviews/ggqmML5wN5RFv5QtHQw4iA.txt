Although Visa Rules preclude merchants asking cardholder ID except specific circumstances discussed guide merchants cannot ID condition acceptance  Therefore merchants cannot part regular card acceptance procedures refuse complete purchase transaction because cardholder refuses provide ID  important merchants understand requesting cardholder ID does change merchant's liability chargebacks  However slow down sale annoy customer  some cases may even deter use Visa card result loss potential sale  Visa believes merchants should ask ID part regular card acceptance procedures  <EOR> Had reservations place   fast food Lobster?

Check spot  coming since 2013! disappointed  Thanks Kevin! Excellent customer service rock! <EOR> Bought 12 oz lobster bisque soup stated chunks lobster? could hardly found even teaspoonful finely chopped small container deceiving! Definitely worth $10 00! <EOR> My wife found place wandering through Miracle Mile shops Planet Hollywood   ordered Fish Chips plus Lobster Roll   Since checked Yelp also gave free beer!  The service little slow only Waitress Cashier Expediter but she doing best served smile   food itself very good lobster tasted fresh covered mayo   bun buttered lightly just enough give nice crust taste but much soggy   fish chips soggy did any oily residue     Overall quick bite eat looking seafood option place go! <EOR> I think place great cashier recommended lobster fries 50 50 Lobster crab roll  Food really good but great  think if love lobster enjoy place  <EOR> Ok figure better catch reviews since vacation going back forth Frisco Vegas home     LM only thing brain when am over Miracle Miles shops area Planet Hollywood    Mmmm yum yes! Lobster Roll baby!  This location frequent most Las Vegas ok group dinner show five time  Staff no issues getting big ass order together  Dan super cool patient us We ordered lot no holds barred night   Lobster Roll Fish Chips Lobster mac cheese Lobster grilled cheese sandwich something Amazing!!!  Chowder bread bowl Big basket crunchy fried chips fries Slaw   This visit crazy but fun wish could eat every day but know practical  don't think could ever tired menu seriously   I highly encourage ordering three favorite items lobster mac cheese fish chips lobster roll sandwich   In opinion prices standard mean pay think quality high worth get  specialty meal menu can't find Maine style lobster rolls lobster mac cheese every corner  <EOR> Decided Lobster nice lobster roll lunch today  before but don't much memory probably because hung over crazy bachelorette party last time haha  Anyway today ordered Maine lobster roll cajun style which basically just adding aioli sauce scallions free top your choice butter chives mayo celery  mayo celery plus cajun style  Then comes coleslaw waffle fries but option adding $2 fries crab loaded some other options    sure why load fries?  Food came lobster roll looked great  Huge chunks lobster  excited! But once took bite letdown immediately  much flavor lobster all  didn't taste fresh seafood  could barely taste mayo even aioli sauce  gives?? Plus thickness bread roll really takes away bites lobster put mouth  Then crab loaded fries blah  waffle fries bit hard sitting little while wasn't hot  Again crab didn't taste fresh either  would pass upgrading regular fries next time  onto coleslaw omg worst coleslaw ever had  NO taste whatsoever  felt chewing grass    err   mean cabbage  Ugh      Anyway experience today  All all little below average  If lobsters shipped Maine see why doesn't taste fresh since most likely frozen  would come quick fix  But really doesn't hit spot all  Plus mention increased price $24 roll now which even more pricey before  But hey do? Vegas you're probably hung over hungry spending lots anyway  spend spend spend away! <EOR>
