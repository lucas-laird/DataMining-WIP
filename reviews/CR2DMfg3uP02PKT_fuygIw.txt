Oh price even better! <EOR> Many reviews Lefty's say best pizza Vegas least top five   If  case may move back east   understand being west coast going hard find east coast pizza   lowered expectations picked Lefty's based reviews Yelp   mistake was   I'm going start off review food   rest experience great but some simple mis communication no bearing actual food   To start ordered two pizzas   plain pie mushroom sausage pie   ordered mediums thinking should more enough food two us   menu says medium pizza 14    pizzas 14    arrived comically small boxes seen personal pies single slice take out   remined hopeful however pizza within big taste   The pizza within big anything   flat very stiff bland crust   Good pizza crust bite then spongy texture inside   more texture garlic knot   heavy doughy   cheese greasy   sauce ok but nothing save rest pizza debacle   All told pizza expected based Yelp reviews   dont know where some your pizza east coast but if getting lied to   Las Vegas pizza search continue elsewhere   Now other factors contributed 2 star score   house 2 miles Lefty's   time night ordered pizza should door 30 minutes less   90 minutes call find where pizza was   Turns driver couldn't find street new neighborhood isn't map yet    matters worse person took order never took phone number unable call ask directions   To top all off delivery charge   ended paying $2 driver come 2 miles deliver luke warm pizza hour later expected it   know gas expensive but if am paying deliver food better right fast   To Lefty's credit did recognize fault offered two free pizzas   If system keeping track store credit good system taking down delivery addresses dont expect see those free pizzas anytime soon   course based pizzas last night may want to    <EOR> Saltiest pizza ever had  Couldn't even eat which impressive considering starving waiting 90 minutes delivery  Totally disappointing reading positive reviews  <EOR> We live 1 2 mile restaurant  Last night ordered bucket wings French fries  told guy took order cross streets he stated he knew exactly where live  quoted 40 minutes delivery   hour thirty minutes passed called find where delivery was? guy said driver lost  remade food would deliver 20 minutes  Another 40 minutes passed call again when guy showed food   Today brought salad lunch  almost done eating when found tip rubber glove container    WE NEVER ORDER PLACE AGAIN  <EOR> Horrible pizza  always order veggie pizza would come soggy  would call complain said  comes because veggies wet    what?? eating pizza dipped water <EOR> I don't write many reviews but when do     This far worst pizza ever life  If you're area looking pizza pass establishment  staff unfriendly  seating area well    storage area pizza boxes place looked hadn't cleaned since 1995  I'd rather eat dogs food pizza  <EOR> I really want place  taste good but cold pizza  sure if ate would good  garlic knots sick  flavor texture off  Kinda raw  delivery girl sweet really sold product good job  Next time won't delivered maybe better experience  <EOR> I really hoping we'd found another great pizza place nearby   Unfortunately place    We ordered Romano pizza described fresh garlic grated romano cheese oregano Sounds great right?  Well received cold pizza cheese crust   cheese parmesan comes shaker off shelf   inedible   ordered meatball topping   meatball zero taste   sure meatballs were   sauce zero flavor   very dry tried putting olive oil didn't help   Usually stomach any pizza but wasted money both ate half slice threw rest away    We also ordered pizza fries   Again sauce must cheapest no flavor ketchup would better   Again inedible    We tried zeppolis thank god ordered 12 because dinner   Luckily couldn't mess fried dough sugar  As see other reviews tell is   Trust when say order anywhere else   Papa Johns Dominos even bake DiGiornos  <EOR> Ehhh    if LOVE  garlic ok  much me  Everything ordered tasted garlic oil  Won't back  Wish loved place cuz close home  miss Frankie's Eastern wigwam !!!
