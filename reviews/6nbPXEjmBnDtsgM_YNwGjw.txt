Great Grinds! <EOR> I expected really mindblowing experience all hype around original location positive comparisons drawn between two but Eastern outpost restaurant lands merely really good category   Island Flavor Express Regal Colonnade plaza Eastern Pebble very clearly Hawaiian restaurant given all depictions islands reggae ska music typical plate lunch menu options  also offer varying specials some desserts although desserts seemed run waning evening hours  decor very simple but doesn't detract experience  sure walk far end counter place order but feel free sit down if you're taking to go  They'll bring food your counter or table if you've picked table    I ordered mixed plate $11 25 Furikake Chicken Kalbi Short Ribs +$1 00 particular meat   presented foam to go box even if you're dining in  favorite part actually macaroni salad which salted good way creamy you'd expect  chicken kinda KFC Gen Korean BBQ not so good way  more dry stringy texture moist natural chicken texture furikake didn't stand much sweet glaze did  Sriracha saved day though bestowing little extra sweetness along much needed acidity heat  don't having add condiment something stand but very glad option   As other parts dish white rice cooked perfectly kalbi great rendition tender beef nice touch ginger some charring  little fatty side but let's remember fat = flavor which proven case  Actually muted sweetness when eat something sweet Furikake Chicken but able taste full flavor when dove into leftovers  If mixed plate again kalbi probably something pork dish  sweet   My friend shared spam musubi $2 me  nice sized portion but rice ratio bit high me  Also seaweed little mushy which friend pointed may side effect heat lamp  Although interesting seasonings herbs Island Flavor's version prefer Ross J's rendition which sure prepped order   I also tried friend's oxtail soup $10 which actually comes real bowl if you're dining in  Unfortunately can't compare renowned Hawaiian oxtail soup hotel downtown because yet try it but version tasted well seasoned meaty  vegetables welcome sight but watch not so edible ginger inedible bay leaf  I'd consider ordering again especially now we're getting soup weather daily although might to go order otherwise bring own soup spoon avoid dealing inadequate plastic spoons   Given food reportedly much same OG Island Flavor wasn't quite impressed I'd hoped  certainly enjoyed having plenty leftovers huge portions definitely come back try other proteins specials pork chops w mushrooms onions anyone? but expected experience something sublime other music  Maybe find future  <EOR> I am glad found closer Island Flavor  Though smaller since express definitely just delicious! food quality always staffs friendliness experience much greater! <EOR> Love Island Flavor!!!!

So spent good chunk today Yelp researching places eat those may offer lunch dinner daily specials well those closed Mondays  Yeah am afraid admit research potential places might eat way some people research plan European vacation  But WiFi sporadically cutting which Cox technician blames 2 year old Netgear router impromptu query took longer expected  time narrowed down list picked spot already very hungry way past time Hobbit's second lunch   Luckily Island Flavor Express just few minutes drive surface street without much traffic   Finding parking space also difficult although did drive side building locate vacant parking spot designated short term 30 minutes parking   Upon walking saw Today's Special quick glance opted ordered Kimchi Fried Rice Korean Chicken Wings instead Furikake Chicken helped secured decision come today first place   Yeah when comes food am fickle that   None boring 60's diner conversation starts ends usual me   So few minutes lady took order dropped off box filled Kimchi Fried Rice surrounded mob Korean Chicken Wings the container closed   Even without picking tell edumaguess going substantial soft thud made when made contact surface table  But could totally hallucinated result low blood sugar level   But picking only confirmed 6th sense off all   The Kimchi Fried Rice also contains pieces chasu just kimchi would suspect  decent best but portion definitely high end spectrum serving size   Korean Chicken Wings cooked nicely but sticky ones served Korean Fried Chicken spots around town  But awhile whole meal elevates your sodium level much love Hawaiian Sun products Island grub single enough  plan ahead buy 2 cans $1 25 each soda fountain water   I'd totally back again hopefully Furikake Chicken distant future   Price 4 5 5  very reasonable portions get   Parking 4 5 5  plenty just might walk bit if spaces directly front available   Tastes 4 5  Nothing fancy but pretty good worth coming back more  <EOR> Love place!
