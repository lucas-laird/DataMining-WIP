Let tell every bit worth wait!  trudged through cold rain here!  I ordered box 4 tenders cole slaw fries Texas toast drink   MMmmmmmm   they're every bit good remembered!  opted take full advantage experience eat alone inside restaurant I normally don't dine solo would rather to go    interior very nice clean staff friendly   didn't take very long food which  plus   just taken red eye Honolulu night before hadn't eaten thing since day before almost 4pm needless say pretty famished   This may blasphemy but know Cane's known its Cane sauce   But just expected really am fan Cane sauce   Plus tenders delicious enough themselves and am condiment holic Ranch mayonnaise    did some mayo fries though   Funny thing only fries earth eat without dipping them into anything McDonald's   Back Cane's    great food great service   glad able down Cane's during many weekend trips Vegas   Hoping stop again next time town! <EOR> That sauce straight worse black tar heroin  bucket sauce just dunk whole piece Texas toast there  good ice! <EOR> Nice fresh hot juicy  must when town  every thing fresh fryer  Drive Thur wasn't busy all super close strip  Win win  didn't any pics but empty box  smashed chicken didn't think look back!!!! <EOR> I came Las Vegas Uber driver recommended trying Raising Cane's  didn't understand hype since thought just fried chicken  But gave try since don't Raising Cane's where East Coast  just first bite immediately understood why people love place! chicken super moist believe cooked fresh? Which great because know aren't eating chicken sitting under heat lamp however long  sauce AMAZING  sure sauce good  definitely unique but seemed super simple just good     The only downside feel little pricey would consider fast food  But paying definitely worth it! <EOR> Not really fan Fried Chicken Chicken Tenders general  But would still say place alright  love toast  order just itself  People pretty hyped over Cane's sauce but wasn't all great me  Prices average $10 meal  big box meal much finish own  But boyfriend able finish rest mine  literally ate toast half chicken strip   Customer service could use some work  lady working drive thru pretty rude made obvious she just wanted leave  <EOR> I love Cane's  brand spankin new location just opened Tropicana Valley View  always box combo comes 4 fingers crinkle cut fries Texas toast slaw drink  always sweet tea delicious  personally don't coleslaw sub slaw extra fries  could sub extra toast  no toast extra slaw no fries extra slaw  idea    So normally when think chicken fingers think dipping them ranch right? Well but Cane's doesn't serve ranch! first disappointed  chicken finger without ranch girl without high heels something that  But Cane's sauce AKA crack sauce  stuff addicting  peppery ketchup but think made mayo  box combo comes 2 sauces but always more  also honey mustard sauce well if you're into that  <EOR> Finally!!!! canes chain near commute  total sucker fried chicken strips fries toast    Wait coleslaw sauce simple but damn good   pretty sure location less 6 months old but business booming food Fresh staff friendly bathrooms PRISTINE ! highlight bathrooms because if you've ever traveled Tropicana near 95 always see filth area  Hookers walking every hour day many Budget Suites hooker pimp motels course magnificent Wild West Casino across street canes      You Raising Canes go! <EOR> Duh   Cane's why wouldn't five stars ? perfect if you're looking you're quick crispy chicken yummy sauce it  <EOR> I ordered big box meal drive thru comes 4 pieces boneless chicken fingers fries coleslaw Texas Toast Drink   due heavy 5pm Vegas traffic took 20 minutes drive home 4 blocks away before could try it    First Chicken crispy juicy dry soft tender eat only slightly warm   The dipping sauce thousand Island dressing without minced pickles similar sauce packet    I say all honesty prefer KFC original chicken much tastier opinion   The Fries soft limp coleslaw Little creamier KFC version Texas Toast best part meal lemonade okay    Summary maybe would tasted better if tried fresh without 20 minute wait before digging shrug   I doubt ever back many other choices restaurants Vegas  <EOR> This favorite fast food joints  food great quality never ever ever mess your order! food always comes fast everybody works really helpful nice  Also if your dog car usually offer treat her  <EOR> Best friggin chicken ever had  Scrumptious!!!! Delicious lemonade some friendliest service ever seen  <EOR> Wow food good! chicken strips hot juicy while crinkled cut fries crispy delicious  really cole slaw too  Service good but food took awhile but probably made fresh order which worth it ! <EOR> Chicken fingers   special sauce nothing special  Good service but trick point trick isn't worth effort  Oh people come Texas Toast grip even remotely garlic bread  <EOR> Instead coming chicken strips famous Raising Cane's dipping sauce come Texas toast  carb lover only sense order extra toast every single time  Each slice costs $1 each  toast made perfection  crispy outside fluffy inside warm! chicken tenders paired dipping sauce also another must try if you've never tried Raising Canes  If decide opt meal options you'll crinkle cut fries along your choice beverage  Cole slaw another side option  menu limited but rather much prefer way because larger menu longer takes indecisive people mind like me!   Try sweet tea if sweet tooth me!   Tip order dine if want more fries  Transfer food box yourself if need take your food go  <EOR> I love canes its way home work never no problems orders everyone real sweet   <EOR> not best location  food used made order      but last 4 5times cold chicken fries  happened?? live 3 blocks away took caines off weekly rotation reason  however 10 11pm night  chicken fries sitting warmers staff clean before closing? unacceptable!  i try them again during lunch let u know <EOR> Raising Canes establishment always feel family food always point  visit Vegas no different even exceeded expectations  Brandon manager took care group made sure great experience food top flight always truly saved long day vegas pools! Appreciate hospitality!! <EOR> Very fast fast food very hot juicy chicken fingers  Nothing fancy just chicken fingers kind thick batter  Even if order sandwich just three chicken fingers bun lot sauce piece lettuce  good grab drive through fill your tummy but nothing fancy all so ever  <EOR> The best chicken strips more thick chicken breast tenders there  They're tender juicy crispy coating  fries perfect complement Texas toast oh bad good  Texas toast thick piece buttered bread grilled crispy edges definitely good those counting calories but excellent choice carboholics  Everything made order comes piping hot  coleslaw helps balance all fried goodness  little bland but good crunch it   love getting kids meal cheap snack go  lemonade perfect balance between tart sweet but ask less ice otherwise you'll cupful ice few gulps lemonade  Fresh ingredients equals great tasting food  Every Cane's line inside but they're always quick your order out  Service smile well  <EOR> This three Raising Cane's probably worst one  ordered through drive thru which wasn't busy  just wanted there  fries stale bread soggy but boyfriend tired back complain  really never any complaints any Raising Cane's until point  just mental note come back one  <EOR> Love eating here the food all ways hot fresh every time order keep good work  <EOR> Stop today buy the hard hat family value  Notice didn't come fries  Brandon manager nice enough give two order fries no charge  employee place nice  If your staying strip don't forget grub canes see brandon  <EOR> Not great everyone claims  ordered box 4 strips   good filling but chicken wasn't crispy liked everything else wasn't fresh  late night around 11  Maybe just location time day?
