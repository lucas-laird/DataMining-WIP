When management relys solely gaming its self highest income extraction players becomes low class casino poor hospitality poor experiences players     would suggest newcomers fooled Arizona Charlies short term impressions use keep you   There far better establishments choose better atmosphere much better experience else where     Happy Gaming! <EOR> This isn't first time but first time checking in  normally just randomly hubby family play bingo  smaller local casino doesn't much tables play if you're looking variety card games roulette  love roulette but whenever never really see table open floor lady kinda just looks then doesn't say anything  actually happened twice  even walked table she just looked then turned around  Threw off guard but just made want really play there  basically around 10 11pm bingo session over  love bingo attendance  workers really nice great see always remember regulars when buy tickets paid out  regular but when notice that  Props bingo room!
