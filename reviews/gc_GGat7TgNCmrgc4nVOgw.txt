<EOR> Made reservations OpenTable  slow sat ASAP  $40 corkage fee bottle wine brought  thought very high just ordered drinks    I barrel aged old fashion  many ice cubes  Tasted bourbon ice cherry  $16  pass  also took over 10 mins cocktails ordered them    As far food goes  Ordered French onion soup start  Again took long long time come and slow time 630pm   Soup tasted good although very watery  Presentation awful   No bread anything table waitress Mariel rarely came around    Main course took excessive amount time come out  Meanwhile no waitress sight    Main course Rigatoni Bolognese  Pretty good however came only warm hot  Waitress didn't check again    We asked check left  give 2 stars  Standard over priced Vegas Strip restaurant doesn't pay much attention detail quality  don't think coming back  <EOR> Situated where Nobhill used new Michael Morton tapas joint  immediately noticed decor kinda felt winery Napa  White washed wood covers floor ceiling candles lit borders ceiling tables chairs made feel sleek outside dining experience    Our server quick drink orders  pretty decent hand crafted cocktail menu  caught eye Punch Drunk Love mint infused Hendricks Gin Lillet Rose Fresh Watermelon Juice Fresh Lime Juice  suggest if going more drink trust delicious want more one should share family style comes carafe    Sticking idea shared plates decided against doing entree just ordered bunch tapas    Roasted Cauliflower appetizer good maybe little heavy red  wine vinegar wish would've tried Cauliflower Mash instead    Sea Scallop Benny Sunny side quail egg chorizo chipotle hollandaise  excellent  flavors very unique   Octupus Ceviche Grapefruit Pickled Jalepenos  pretty good think liked Taro Chips more ceviche though   Ricotta Gnocchi Braised Short Rib Pea Puree  Awesome  no wonder signature dishes  short ribs tender  it   Littleneck Clams Coconut Chili Broth  good broth little salty but thankfully coconut did mellow salt  Ask extra piece bread dip into broth    This place little pricey comparable La Cave  tapas definately sharable more two people   Everything pretty good including service  also vegan menu  <EOR> We never experienced dessert this  flatbread Nutella bananas bacon vanilla sauce peanut butter combination truly indescribable  different flavors just bursting your mouth  such amazing unique dessert  must try  <EOR> Solely disappointed service evening  ordered appetizers crab cakes heirloom tomato salad french onion soup  All amazing  Well seasoned most part  Nice flavors  However server Julie never took dinner order waiting hour ordering apps even though floor busy Thursday evening  Sad thriving business could great but staff  No time substandard service  <EOR> We looked menu dishes sounded delicious staying hotel   surprised yelp reviews weren't higher  ambiance great service wonderful dishes ordered fantastic   halibut salmon both amazing   Only reason didn't give five starts because peanut butter chocolate cake wasn't great low grade black tea and no other options     Must also note sommelier wonderful advised great wine pairing recommended Italian red yet menu   Wonderful service overall fantastic dining experience   Highly recommend <EOR> I came dinner before concert Grand Garden   seated promptly back room rather take table bar   whole place including room very dark mirrors most notably running length ceiling   My server brought menu water glass filled   server stopped again asked drinks ordered usual iced tea which soon brought   dinner consisted three tapas plates  octopus ceviche grapefruit pickled jalapeño shrimp risotto tomato fondue arugula ricotta gnocchi braised short rib pea purée   dessert chocolate makeout  a warm chocolate fondant salted caramel cream peanut brittle caramel sauce   The octopus ceviche very good   dish good citrus flavor grapefruit pickled jalapeños added good contrast   Served dish small amount corn chips which ate along octopus   The shrimp risotto OK   nothing special dish   shrimp large but dish whole lacked any wow factor whole standout    shrimp also bit chewy   Last ricotta gnocchi braised short rib pea purée   really liked dish  short rib very tasty opposed bland ricotta gnocchi no discernible taste pea purée all   Still liked flavor short rib softness gnocchi made good fit   Dessert chocolate makeout  almost chocolate lava cake but mercifully another rendition ubiquitous dessert   chocolate fondant rich could piped salted caramel cream directly into mouth   peanut brittle small amount caramel sauce added texture flavor dessert   Service varied   iced tea brought no sugar other sweeteners   When server came time he stopped then asked if  wanted any sugar   asked some artificial sweetener which he never brought   he few times stopped busser asked container sweeteners no time all   When came time dessert different server stopped asked if wanted dessert   ordered her   dinner original server brought check took payment   The server didn't ask if needed anything explained menu nor did he mention more off menu special   other server mention couple them tab e next asked them if restaurant before   She then describe some dishes told people if any other questions ask her   think maybe she should whole time   bus persons very efficient removed finished plates timely manner   Crush OK   Your paying Strip

He great suggestions great food! <EOR> We very nice meal Crush  tvs hide behind panels walls wasn't huge fan them all being on    but all other nice restaurants long wait times  wasn't quiet romantic date hoped but certainly delicious!  I could tell tvs could hidden away thT very nice private room back which would perfect weddings parties  night tvs though wanted romantic date desert elsewhere  definitely return though!! <EOR> Good service great tastes but little pricey portion size  Food came super fast which good thing but if comes fast prices shouldn't high such small portion imo  again because flavors amazing!!!! <EOR> Food staff awesome  wedding reception very gracious accomodating even though exceeded count expected guests  All guests loved enjoyed food good ambiance  Again thanks crush everything  <EOR> Just left star sisters meal which she absolutely raved about gnocchi braised beef    However myself mother ordered off vegan menu having blown away vegan menu both Aria's Blossom Encore's Wazuzu same expectations Crush  disappointed  ordered risotto tofu Gardein chicken  food bland lacking creativity  carrot miso broth tofu lovely but wasn't enough call broth $18 Gardein chicken ripoff  buy meat analog all time prepare better myself  If you're going incorporate vegan menu better simply opening package dumping plate  people unfamiliar product might pass but if you're catering vegans can't serve chicken way call good  also asked salt pepper because lack flavour time arrived food cold    The vegan menu definitely needs re do chefs should take cue restos Wynn Encore    The drinks good  Service mediocre  <EOR> So while ago when restaurant week going bachelorette party  realized totally spaced writting review      Coming into place super big but cool vibe  There's big hanging swing chair corner sure people love take selfies in   remember all around food decent although someone some type fish plate did look smell fresh     thing really irked several others couldn't seem understand medium rare steak was   First well done then when tell waitress cook wrong she looks oh done enough     no way over done   Then guy running joint ya well those cooked medium rare but cook more myself   Super condescending wanted Google medium rare shove face   come inside almost raw rare  point whatever I'd rather undercooked  starving   overall flavor dish fine desserts end very good but bottom line if serve steak high end spot strip know cook better job client recovery  <EOR> I visited Birthday things started promising  Super nice venue menus promising  Then came service  place fairly empty but service extremely slow  did receive waters right away but busser  Curious George cocktail which good husband asked sample SinCity Light which tap  took quite some time she came back full glass beer  woodfire pizza good but took 25 min  beef tartare little salty  philly cheese dumplings ok  tuna tartare amazing but small price  surf turf main dish filet over cooked but enough send back lobster over cooked very salty  California wine flight perfect  then done seeing server another 20 minutes she brought super cute happy Birthday dessert  might completely different review if chosen different food items more attentive service  <EOR> Wow wow wow  Absolutely amazing  Expensive but well worth every dollar   Make sure visit <EOR> Crush live crushed restaurant  honest food wasn't all bad but service horrid  Started attitude hostess when requested place more light  ask third menu even though told Angeli server third person  ask steak knife filet entry pepper gnocchi  remind Angeli remove returned gnocchi bill  Lastly mentioned both reservation when showed celebrating two birthdays yet nothing came although other party did candle etc     Bottom line shouldn't remind staff job job is    Ahi Tuna good flavor but always feel sesame seed encrusting detracts tuna  Gnocchi least favorite ricotta gnocchi having now flavor meat being salty return it  Halibut good but sauce again salty even though kale wasn't  Filet best bunch being properly cooked  frustrated service didn't bother choose alternate entree replace gnocchi skipped desert later peanut M M which didn't need being reminded job     Paid while holding noses giving minimum tip should zero percent    Told manager seemed frustrated  Great news many choices strip White Castle Subway etc  give superior service  <EOR> This solid dinner option couple small group  portions sizes conducive large groups sharing  decor cool  room quite dark  sat time per reservation  While food good think priced high get   Given tapas style able try several options  Salt Pepper Frites come garlic aioli romesco dipping sauce  fries good flavor sauce them even better  good sharing option   Mixed greens comes prosciutto pine nuts cider vinaigrette  ideal sharing but portion good ok   We tried few wood fired pizzas  all tasty  crust good texture flavor  sauce tasty toppings solid  great sharing   I also tried Hand Cut Beef Carpaccio  comes petit watercress shaved radish garlic parmesan aioli  solid choice  could used little more flavor but ok  radishes skipped them maybe add missing flavor  <EOR> Came daddy Julez day roaming around   Honestly place seems nice but none dish memorable  A+ Service everyone very attentive stylish B Grilled chicken pizza eh pizza said nothing memorable more soggy side chicken little dry  C CA Sea Bass think fault because didn't read menu thoroughly but didn't care tomato taste   other hand dad really enjoyed said fish cooked just right  A Ricotta Gnocchi tender fell apart your mouth best
