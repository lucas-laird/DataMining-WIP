Well turned security officer? Weird good  Then ordered easily pretty delicious anywhere Vegas chicken quesadilla? But first bite could taste old greese taste  OK yukk! hungry driving around looking where eat  Then half way thru meal pick large clumps chicken top almost no cheese?   It torturous! Then gladly left finally  and all could smell smoke emitting kitchen permiating old greese way to my car! Ohh  never again! waitress pretty nice  feel sorry working smelly place serving food!!! <EOR> I am sad reviewer recently bad experience here  Maybe right before closing not excuse just bad luck  eaten dozens times never anything outstanding   Absolutely best cheese enchiladas Las Vegas! grew South Texas where cheese enchilada King know supposed taste  <EOR> My husband lunch tiring high priced haute cuisine Strip  excellent  very high standards Mexican  spending time living Southwest  Chile Verde just right verde sauce fresh excellent  Corn tortillas fresh off press  Chicken cheese enchiladas maybe bit cheesy but delicious  Even rice beans outstanding  Hubby started ceviche pulpo fresh tasty  atmosphere indicative location authenticity  simple but clean service very friendly  Next time visit LV we'll stopping by  <EOR>
