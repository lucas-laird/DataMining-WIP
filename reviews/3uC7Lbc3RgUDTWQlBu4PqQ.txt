I think better offering strip look elsewhere  <EOR> Wandering around Venetian Casino admiring all ceilings architecture stopped watch gondolas canals   Nearby small Bouchon Bakery which never heard of   son informed pretty well known best bakery country decided try something   chocolate croissant coffee choice enjoy sitting canal enjoying views could easily imagine yourself Venice   The pastry wonderful see reputation earned   noticed cookbook display ordered when home   Bouchon Bakery cookbook masterpiece baking photography recipes documentation historical French baking techniques   look just drool hours   cookbook little unweldy size but lures into thoughts could actually create something good yourself if willing much work devote time some classic baking creations  <EOR> I bought two large macaroons $12 around 1230 stale chewy  <EOR> Ordered red velvet cupcake well chocolate Carmel Macchiato cupcake cold dry  tasted much better cupcakes grocery store! Oh Mr  Keller disappointing! <EOR> Don't want restaurant but still want chocolate croissant? Well go  walking off brunch headed snack made way back LA   I requisite croissant but caught eye homemade nutter butters  Which really two large cookies creamy peanut butter filling  Basically large peanut butter cookie sandwich which tastes just Nutter Butter!   Bouchon you've proven your worth  know your pastries back put more them mouth  <EOR> My first time tried 3 pastries  pistachio macaron kouign amann chocolate almond croissant  early afternoon did feel huge selection choose from  kougin amann favorite 3 pastries  dense flakey caramelized exterior love  chocolate almond croissant more dense any almond croissant experience but boyfriend said proper almond croissant should prepared something little different  3 flavors available macarons  pistachio good flavor slightly chewy texture light crispy exterior  macarons large end but baked perfectly  pastries certainly step above your standard French bakery if love pastries must eat while Vegas! <EOR> Unfortunately Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery Venetian huge disappointment  It began trying find small counter located most obscure location within massive property Venetian Hotel   felt frustrated time finally arrived made comment location many employees behind counter   young lady looked shrugged shoulders   She couldn't cared less   Remember?  Thomas Keller experience guess should remembered part   Once made selections passed over cashier many other people behind counter they literally bumping into another because many people behind counter where repeated order cashed out   selected ham cheese baguette heated good   No complaints   bread fresh because heated nice crunch it   also ordered several other products sake review because having recently returned 3 month stay France wanted opportunity fair comparison   Keep mind selections exception TKO standard faire anywhere France mind right selections sake comparison  The almond croissant heavy weight    soon picked knew nowhere close almond croissant would find anywhere France any Stateside French bakery   FILLED almond paste no flakiness whatsoever pastry   took couple bites tossed it   pulled Financier bag took couple bites just big heavy something other  I am trying sound snob but come realize American French sounds good Bakeries French Bakeries   definitely American style French Bakery   products heavy way big size lack any French them    So wrap thought employees made feel lucky Thomas Keller establishment   location or secret hiding place particular kiosk  counter ridiculous   finally French Bakery but bakery where pick something resembles bakery item would find France most French Bakeries Stateside  Sorry Thomas   just sayin'    <EOR> Flaky perfection  Everything tried delicious including coffee which fresh hot  rarely give 5 stars but give credit where due  tried chocolate almond croissant creme brulee pastry creme cheese pastry  <EOR> After visiting Bouchon Bakery Napa Valley just visit Las Vegas when there  brought friends along because wanted see huge macaroons  careful though because place pretty difficult find I even trouble directions given Venetian associates     The only thing purchased Bouchon Bakery full set MACAROONS a total six pieces   NOTE If buy 5 macaroons 1 free  macaroons $3 50 each    I purchased pre packaged set six macaroons which containedVANILLA PISTACHIO RASPBERRY COFFEE CAPPUCHINO CHOCOLATE brownie?

If recall correctly saw pastries croissants danishes muffins sandwiches ham Swiss baguettes cakes cupcakes cookies eclairs came for macaroons   Macaroons sell $3 piece however must admit huge should opted route however being fatty am bought pack mini macaroons $13 all flavors coffee chocolate vanilla pistachio raspberry caramel      The macaroons light fluffy smooth the filling     can't describe words fully justify macaroons but reckon back every time am Vegas simply because work hard workout hard $13 pack macaroons devour entirely less 24 hours?

If love pastries definitely Bouchon Bakery   located Venetian   near Grand Lux theater   lots yummy looking pastries but specifically macarons which cost $3 50 each box 6 different flavors $17 50  <EOR> Long line inefficient staff  Maybe expectations high but just wasn't good hoping calories  bread pudding carrot cake cookie  Eh  <EOR> TIP upstairs downstairs location! Had say first because waited line downstairs 15 minutes  heading Treasure Island took elevator next Bouchon found another bakery counter upstairs no line   Anyways love love love macarons   So far tie between pistachio salted caramel  little pricey $5 each but they're 2 5x size normal macaron they're just amazing   My second favorite thing vanilla chai latte perfect macaron D  Coffee prices comparable starbucks   Sad say actually haven't tried anything else here  really only able come while taking long walk strip  Again sad say don't ever stay Venetian hotel where would much more convenient  <EOR> MACARONS MACARONS MACARONS!  When you're Vegas yourself favor Venetian yourself box macarons maybe even two boxes   They're $17 50 total 6 macarons  might little pricier most but delicious! texture pretty perfect  Delicate flaky outside chewy inside  YUM! favorite coffee flavor which usually don't macarons but excellent !!  But still think Euro Pane's salted caramel macaron #1! yet find beats that! although Chantilly comes close   But very close tie 2nd! it! <EOR> The only reason place 2 stars instead 1 because great raw clams oysters  Unfortunately weren't even served mignonette  kind place serves raw bar cocktail sauce?

Our wait?  45 50 minutes   naturally expecting some really top notch food coming  fact really counting having some gourmet waffles particular morning! Well would believe place actually ran waffles!!! run waffles? Sure perhaps restaurant could run frozen Lego waffles but would expect restaurant making own fresh waffles which should NEVER run of!

Every single thing point  See photos  <EOR> There two Bouchon locations Venetian Resort  quick service bakery counter hidden underneath back stairs casino floor  somewhat hard find but worth effort   The location mirrors bakery shop located Yountville serving limited selection French style pastries coffee  no line when visited which allowed blueberry Croissant chocolate Macaron paired espresso little effort   The pastries very good although blueberry Croissant regular cut half filled cream fruit instead baked in  Macaron very delicious good flavor texture  espresso done well served tiny cup tiny plastic lid   This great place enjoy famous Bouchon pastries without waiting actual restaurant  hard find but impossible forget  <EOR> It hard find  lost trying find place  stopped clock tower location first  outside tables but selections limited  lovation inside Venetian hotel casino floor  Around corner Grandlux  Small but more variety  Cheese danish excellent!!! Eclairs good but outstanding  Chocolate almond croissant wonderfully also  <EOR> Horrible cappuccino  caramel macaroons biting round piece rock  Bouchon bakery Yountville loved it  inside Venetian blah blah totally blah  <EOR> I visited part search perfect French macaron locally  Bouchon macarons 3 times size normal macaron but also 3x price $3+ piece  But buy 5 1 free  perfect texture thin crispy outer shell over perfectly chewy center  filling just right amount but filling accounts 4 stars vs 5  good but sweet buttercream type filing even raspberry  prefer real fruit filling little tart it  Overall delicious would recommend  If prefer fruit filling tart well I'd recommend checking La Belle Terre bakery W  Sahara  <EOR> Bouchon creates best macarons tried date FAR best strip   tried macarons Sweet Factory Payard simply compare   They're huge  size 3 regular macarons and priced match! but flavor texture point   generally am fan fruit flavored macarons but love raspberry flavors here those along pistachio vanilla go to's   vanilla eclairs yummy too   recommend snagging tickets Phantom then munching couple afterwards! <EOR> I dying stop Bouchon bakery five locations renowned Chef Thomas Keller  checked off wish list today!

These classic little French goodies yummy  Crispy outside chewy flavorful inside   raspberry pistachio   think maybe 5 6 different flavors which also change seasons   also offer other baked goodies but enamored lovely macarons   def  must stop when hit Sin City again  <EOR> So last weekend wife came Vegas celebrate birthday   way stopped Bouchon breakfast   location Beverly Hills but first time Vegas location   wife both ordered Petite breakfast which comes pastry coffee juice eggs bacon sausage side fries   food good obviously place know its pastries   did issue service   Halfway through meal noticed served juice   When asked wait staff told did come meal which little confused because waiter took down order   wasn't until check asked another person he clarified indeed included brought glass already finished meal   Also fries never came time someone came see if everything ok already late told them cancel it   Needless say felt waiter just totally ignored when wasn't even busy since seated 8am sunday morning  <EOR> Expensive almond chocolate croissant no good all dry maybe old couple days   No come here  <EOR> After two weeks slacking off because school just started  and especially weekend partying Vegas sitting bed suffering consequences listening monotoned funny but tries professor lecturing through podcast   only thing saved pulling hair delight munching pastries brought home Bouchon Bakery!!!  I Financier Pain Au Raisin total $5 25   Trust very fair price pay heaven your mouth!  First devoured Financier which Madeleine but better!  encrusted sugared sliced almonds which gives perfect crunch while cake itself perfect every way both texture taste!  wikipedia ed financiers supposedly financier derived traditional rectangular mold resembling bar gold    boy truly bar gold   At point going give Bouchon Bakery 4 stars   Then        then finished Pain Au Raisin breakfast   taste buds any more spoiled?!?  thought being day old would depress quality croissant like pastry but noooo   raisins aren't pruny actually taste meat raisin  and sugar crystals instantly dissolve your mouth!    I admit skeptical first  but now believer!  can't believe didn't try Bouchon Bakery last time stayed Venetian considering first thing see once leave Venetian Guest Towers!  definitely coming back try everything else offer! <EOR> I've Bouchon Bakery Yountville which give rating 3 much better Vegas kiosk  When last time cupcake overly sweet could only eat couple bites macarons lacked crispy shell tasted more whoopie pies cookie little hard  Overall baked goods location taste very fresh  always crowded staff isn't very friendly rushes people line  <EOR> stopped coffee stand cappuccino   coffee just average   Nothing special   Croissant tasted day old    Sold ham cheese croissants   Staff clueless inefficient   over restaurant purchase items stood bar 10 minutes only ignored bar staff    I Bouchon's Napa wonderful   Won't back don't recommend Bouchon's Vegas   Disappointed! <EOR> Ok advanced home cook baker  course Bouchon first culinary stop Vegas   thought may overhyped seemed overpriced   also assumed macarons would steal show over flashy less sophisticated sandwich cookies     So wrong   Days later back Midwest am gorging goodies dreaming Bouchon   Such classy excellent staff helpful friendly   Late hours bakery?

Delicious flaky buttery Chocolate Croissants  Macaroons just heavenly too  They're light airy uber sweet  coffee strong side    Well see why Bouchon Bakery Foodie destination Las Vegas Strip  worth stop grab little something munch while hotel hopping  <EOR> I only macaroons  tried pistachio mint chocolate chip vanilla  All three perfect! Each bite airy crisp outside sweetly flavored slightly gooey thin layers inside  brought back chocolate raspberry macaroons gifts  wished space fit chocolate fruit lime tart but only eat much day  <EOR> Having Bouchon Bakery Yountville slightly disappointed selection location  decent selection specials but don't carry items chocolate covered macaroons  larger macaroons also aren't large macaroons Bouchon Yountville although price still same     They special where buy 5 macaroons 1 free  choose your flavors some pre packaged  macaroons themselves although big used still really delicious   even couple days they're good!   Now know where location Vegas it's theater Venetian definitely sure stop treat  wasn't busy all when stopped afternoon weekday  <EOR> Closed more 45 minutes before 9pm  Said woman packing away unsold pastries macaroons just decided close early  Annoying planning last night strip around stop sweets  <EOR> Wow really?

I visited purchased food Bouchon Bakery first floor Grand Canal Shoppes area  just off Strip near B B Burger outdoor gondola ride  happened upon another Bouchon Bakery when upstairs afterward original location somewhere inside Venetian  found most convenient slightly wider selection its overhead neighbor   I took two items ate them within few hours  Croissant $3 75 go to pastry version golden brown outside chewy outside enough buttery flavor anyone but diehard butter fans  Aside easily some outer layer flakes off comparable any other versions town both on Strip off Strip   The Kouign Amann $4 50 another classic although tougher find  both more difficult less popular  version does lot right crispy chewy textures expected sugary flavors  think cheats little though easily see glassy sugar layer flat side kouign amann dough just doesn't enough layers  way flat compared other good versions had  However if blindfolded would likely no issue   As long parking stays free Palazzo Venetian I'd consider making regular stops Bouchon Bakery some pastries  first taste good enough let's say 3 75 stars averaged between two bites optimistic similar results if venture into cookies macarons other baked goods cinnamon rolls monkey bread on   <EOR> The chocolate Bouchon $1 75 super rich but bad price cheese danish very buttery flaky but little more pricey @ $4 but expect @ Venetian hotel strip Bouchon most part   Sm  coffee $3 Stroong   definitely pay if you're guest @ Venetian best place quick pastry cup coffee conveniently located near guest elevators   **there's no tables chairs bring back your room take 4th floor enjoy poolside = <EOR> MACAROONS!!!  4 days Vegas made point stop just those delicious macaroons keep reading about  There's no secret macaroons just simply heavenly die but probably best ever no lie   The filling little more buttery which loved because contrasted sweet crispy cookie perfectly  splurged bought 2 gift boxes mini's regular sized  first glance prices may shock but size cookie quality taste well worth it   I didn't actually eat most them until home since stuffing face everything else strip haha  Scared cookies would lose crispiness literally scarfed down macaroons few days  surprised though fourth day cookies nearly fresh still  experience haven't any macaroons stay edible more two days if weren't eaten yet!

Until next time sweet carb a licious bakery am forever fan! <EOR> I really TKO but eat them right away because funky filling turns yellow sitting few hours  macarons good but wish would them half size half price could eat more flavors  try different flavors but don't think eat more without getting sick   Plus if don't flavor I didn't chocolate then feel guilty throwing away $4 macaron  dark chocolate lover but flavor just seemed way intense macaron  also tried     Blueberry Financier ehh ok but plain almond way better  bad don't right now    Apple Croissant Amazing esp if love apple crisp Dutch apple pie  sure toast panini press   Almond Chocolate Croissant  pretty good but chocolate dominated hell marzipan regular almond croissant better but don't now   Bouchons INSANELY DELICIOUS  always buy package 6 $10 take them home bake them toaster oven couple minutes  kind crisp outside very soft melty inside  very high fat put wad paper towel under when bake them  always soaked grease figure eat more because am sparing myself lot fat grams lol!

Honestly looked more danish croissant since pretty flat filling   basically blueberry muffin center croissant around it  Nice twist blueberry muffin! muffin part moist croissant part light airy  <EOR> When Vegas knew find place macarons  Because  Vegas??

Strawberry Almond Croissant tasty! Fresh strawberries under almond topping  bit heavy    ate plane going home promptly fell asleep   Chocolate Bouchons Everyone needs little mini delicious brownies   There two bakery locations Venitian    review bakery next pedestrian overpass walkway Ti  <EOR> So yummy  only reason did give 5 stars because no longer sell chocolate dipped macarons  <EOR> Bouchon tucked away under elevator outside Phantom theater Venetian  tried 6 piece box macarons apple tart  Both delicious  prefer macarons over those purchased Jean Phillippe Sugar Factory although while more expensive macarons way bigger taste better  6 pack each macaron costs less $3 piece isn't bad end  back macarons if ever Vegas again  <EOR> A convenient bakery located sprawling floor Venetian  place great those want grab delicious baked good comfort knowing comes same pedigree Bouchon restaurant just few floors above   With clear glass cases showcasing beauties behind invisible cage displays baked delicacies much sensual gluttony you'd expect city word sin added its alias  Everything enormous macaroons dense filling bread pudding  Mix cup coffee hot chocolate perfect pair   Though pricing bit expensive even macaroons hovering $3 each your wallet might appreciate going spending spree area however if decide splurge least know bet you're gambling on  <EOR> Damn your beautiful pastries   No because can't stop eating them   But because convinced keep ordering incorrectly surely something case delicious looks   Turns  just situation all here     You solid gold star strong delicious coffee but done handing over hard earned cash disappointing baked goods   They're just good   red velvet cupcake dense almost stale   chocolate chip cookie dry dry dry     Thanks though coffee  <EOR> Since missed bakery last time ate Bouchon Napa really insistent check Las Vegas location   I grabbed snack EVERY DAY while partying Vegas  also didn't help staying Venetian just elevators ride bakery     Favorites chocolate eclairs ham brie sandwich  bf really enjoyed bread pudding still moist yummy crunchy texture outside   And used really dislike macroons until Bouchon! Probably reason review bumped 4 stars 5 stars because still dream those damn chocolate macaroons    The only minus? don't live close NYC Vegas Yountville locatios  But maybe good thing? keeping dying sugar induced death    <EOR> This preferred bakeries strip where tend stop every time Vegas  small outlet hidden behind escalator casino level Venetian may little hard find if don't know looking for  seem pretty popular encountered line each time but moves fast  tried bunch baked good cupcakes chocolate croissants danish scones sticky buns beignets cookies etc over visits  All products fresh taste great specially sticky buns which loaded pecans coating caramelized sugar which balances taste pecans very well still tend sweet side  cream danish other hand only mildly sweet filling appeal people don't want deserts sweet  Prices most items around $4 mark which in lines pay other bakeries strip  <EOR> Best Americano ever had  PB chocolate red velvet cupcakes overrated  Carrot cake cookie good  espresso drinks  Can't them  <EOR> It treat quality French bakery right strip   Since bakery restaurant prices reasonable  grabbed pastries some fruit nearby Walgreens nice breakfast hotel room  <EOR> If you've read reviews know love desserts known pregaming dinner and occasion breakfast something sweet    On recent visit Las Vegas paid pre dinner visit Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery  couldn't mind wanted try but eventually decided raspberry macaroon good par Paris standards red velvet cupcake meh! definitely better cake dry frosting strange taste sprinkles tacky finally chocolate tart delish! never wrong chocolate     Bottom line definitely better but if your Venetian desperate something fulfill your sweet tooth isn't bad option  Just note there's no seating you'll take your goodies nearby food court which clean plenty seating consume  <EOR> Very good brunch! Very tasty food Very very slow service!! food took much time come even dessert took forever! <EOR> Despite all reviews did try macaroon   chocolate croissant which flaky light delicious fresh    tried 2 other strip area coffee shops neither could hold candle this   espresso very good well   Really no place sit down sit slot machine eat   look pastry case takes away then turn back middle tacky town  <EOR> Everytime Vegas resist urge stop buy display case  Everything looks good!!!  As DIFFICULT however decided restrain myself  plan trying assortment moderation  only mean more Vegas trips woohoo!  Thus far tried red velvet cupcake vanilla macaron course few TKOs  Red velvet cupcake good but best had  vanilla macaron however best had  textures down nicely well thought balance flavor  subtle overpowering  JUST right which appreciate   As TKO tell exact setting where when last bit into one  memory stay forever  stop walking order savor moment  *pauses think back   * Anyways filling cream inside soft pillow sweetness melds perfectly decadent chocolate cookie  definite must try   As coffee good  sweet taste but bad  Nothing world either  won't hurt accompaniment delectable pastries store though! <EOR> Love love love! place stop very short work trip Vegas  am step closer actually dining Thomas Keller business! dream French Laundry but Bouchon Bakery now! LOL   My goal hands famous macarons  yes worth trip yes massive! $3 50 per macaron $17 50 box 6 which included raspberry caramel vanilla coffee pistachio chocolate  also buy 5 macarons your choice 1 free which obviously works same price $17 50 but chose flavours  Yeah kinda pricey but macarons hard find city good maracon even harder find  am use smaller macarons Bouchon ones size small palm  quite delicious light crisp exterior but full flavour inside  favourite pistachio but they're all great box set   The madeleine $1 each quite yummy too  But disappointed croissant $3 75 wasn't buttery wanted but very flakey  surprise yum mocha! OMG mocha absolutely amazing smooth espresso taste sweet bitter chocolate  $4 75 small mocha worth every penny!  The bakery Venetian right Phantom Opera theatre just around corner Grand Luxe Cafe under set escalators  There's no seating dedicated bakery basically pick place  <EOR> Looking good Macarons Las Vegas? Bouchon Bakery your craving fix!  I would've given them 5 stars but 2 things knocked them dow me    price flavor selection   Macarons fresh soft filled flavor! Larger typical macarons  Quality freshness wise   best far!  Flavors changes season season  but general flavors usually seasonal featured flavor   What tried Mint Chocolate Chip delish! eating puffy andes mint! Mint chocolate balanced perfectly  special order puppies though because season  Vanilla simple creamy Pistachio great taste flavorful Pumpkin seasonal but surprisingly GREAT!!! Coffee bad  Location Located Venetian Casino hotel under behind escalators Grand Luxe Restaurant  If price isn't factor then would highly recommend! <EOR> Came pit stop before boarding flight home   many choices didn't know get   boyfriend actually ate bistro night before   their bread amazing if something pair with     I settled  *Oatmeal cookie [omg delicious crunchy but chewy   I wasn't able finish several days still maintained its freshness!!!] *Vanilla Macaroon your typical coconut macaroon but those mini sandwich pies   SO DELICIOUS ice cream yet LIGHT   again wasn't able finish BUT did maintain its freshness   so should eat sitting!]  I wish ventured off tried more stuff!  count down days return Napa Vegas more!! <EOR> Whenever Vegas point breakfast every day Bouchon bakery   far superior Wynn cafe unsurprisingly cheaper too!  Don't bother drip coffee espresso drinks here drinking water   also fan madeleines  they flavorless foamy   But everything else had?  Phenomenal!    Try croissants especially STRAWBERRY ones Parisian macarons coffee vanilla pistachio favs muffins red velvet cupcake focaccia PB J brioche   eponymous bouchons just okay but definitely satisfying if all want fulfill chocolate y craving  <EOR> I discovered place when Vegas craving macarons   My first visit early June filled surprise macaron twice size regular macaron! when took first bite fell love  macaron crispy yet airy inside chewy filled delicious cream middle  macaron absolutely perfect no complaints it    However when visited Bouchon again week disappointed size macarons  macaron size now very inconsistent some larger others overall macarons shrunk  When ordered box back June all macarons perfect uniformity  Now some small while other flavors larger   I also tried turkey sandwich fell love  bread cranberries raisins when toasted perfect complement turkey brie cheese  sandwich every morning am still sick it   I plan trying other pastries when visit Las Vegas again but hope macarons disappoint  Thank goodness macarons still taste same    <EOR> Not impressed  macarons just ok definitely worth special trip for  only unique thing huge price worth it   We ordered salted caramel pistachio coffee flavors  think coffee best since wasn't sweet  Caramel sweetest difficult eat near end since each bite worse worse  first time wish macaron actually smaller bigger!  Overall I'd probably skip place next time back try different bakery! <EOR> Yelped place love desserts! wanted try macaron first time  walked Venetian found bakery all way other end entrance   It small place saw different colored macarons green orange white brown macarons  asked flavors macarons he said pistachio orange vanilla chocolate  vanilla chocolate original flavors see taste   The macarons decent size took 4 5 bites finish them  tried vanilla    good!!!! inside eating ice cream other outer layers soft nice chewy texture    The chocolate good but chocolatey rich me  But slowly finished throughout day  <EOR> i absolutely adore Bouchon Bakery Yountville    when saw opened Bouchon Bakery place abode imagine sugar rush immediately felt?  helas stick Yountville  perhaps during summer months anyways    the macaroons crunchy afternoon hours though softer morning hours  seemed dry desert weather affected baked goods more Mister Keller thought why even server said so    same applied english scone purchased  indulging decadent goodness original bakery more feast eyes more anything else  safe side something uber buttery pain au chocolat  can't wrong chocolate  butter  mixed together    better luck next time  <EOR> Behind huge escalator    missed twice even asking employee   literally underneath backside escalator next wall dead end  But if happen stumble upon yourself favor boxed set macarons! brought some home even 4 days still held nicely soft chewy without sticking your teeth  <EOR> I'll real simple lost souls seeking French patisserie    located front Phantom Opera behind escalator  No need search around looking signs thrown off  simply put it    wife loved chocolate croissants large macaroons solid  Fin  <EOR> Favorite macaroons = lemon chocolate   variety gift pack thingy really did other flavors raspberry vanilla coffee think pistachio? really didn't those flavors because bland way artificial raspberry    Lemon chocolate stood because lemon perfect mix tangy sweet chocolate best ganache wasn't sweet I'm dark chocolate fan nice velvety texture inside     Chocolate chip cookie just okay   prefer mine chewy very crispy dense   BUT tomato feta pesto foccaccia DIE FOR!  thick moist fluffy slice foccaccia layer pesto tasty roma tomatoes feta cheese top   Such yummy snack prior eating Wynn buffet   BF didn't eat lunch could eat more buffet but needed little snack quiet growls! <EOR> Great bakery inside Venetian two locations    Coffee very good baked goods sublime   did take breakfast couple times     croissants buttery flaky   Also almond croissant blueberry muffin cinnamon roll little pastry cannot remember name     all delicious quick bite tide over between buffets large meals! <EOR> Once saw Thomas Keller knew try bakery! Bouchon Bakery somewhat hidden public view  located next Phantom Opera Theater next Grand Lux Cafe inside Venetian    The day decided try Bouchon Bakery morning search good latte pastry cookie  When down elevators hotel room spotted little spot packed busy  came closer saw all buzz about  Delicious looking pastries breads desserts more delicacies! figured go! really did want spend more $6 did night before small cappuccino Coffee Bean Tea Leaf mediocre   WOW! Everything looked amazingly fresh! really wanted try foccacia feta onion oven dried tomatoes chocolate croissant sensational looking fruit tarts Bavarian Creams golden chocolate transfer patterns   but resist! going lunch friends decided buy vanilla soy latte cranberry biscotti  combo winner! latte sweet very well sweetness biscotti   The next morning before left Vegas figured buy some macaroons! purchased chocolate raspberry macaroons very good  macaroons texture cross between cake cookie but fit will! soft chewy flavor swirled palate sweet! filling inside them just right did look sloppy  Excellent! $3 50 each    little pricey but Vegas!  You also purchase coffee beans!   Customer services very friendly! <EOR> The macarons not confused macaroons only bakery items gluten free but wow amazing!! bought box bring home kids trying vanilla yesterday  Yummy sugary heaven    <EOR> I tried every single french macaroon place Vegas best   However better other cities   macaroons bigger most but pretty pricey  <EOR> Great place grab some coffee beignets before heading pool warned chocolate beignets sell early  <EOR> I stopped chance since staying Venetian didn't time sit down lunch day  original plan getting just sandwich turned into sandwich raspberry macaroon which surprising because swore I'd never another first taste Jean Phillipe la madeleine cup fresh squeezed orange juice     The orange juice ok   no pulp which always question whether really fresh squeezed but tasted fine   sandwich turkey sweet twisted bread incredible   I'd say  best sandwich life    The best part entire meal though definitely raspberry macaroon   said swore against all macaroons eternity but just looked pretty scrumptious caved   best decisions life   cookie everything imagined macaroons would more  outside slightly crunchy soft moist center just happy decided share   couldn't shut cookie thank goodness couple locations CA won't wait Vegas every time craving macaroons  <EOR> It final morning before check didn't want buffet breakfast Grand Lux Cafe again  since Bouchon Bakery just near lifts rooms thought I'd nip right downstairs quick pastry hot tea myself friend  Oh boy 9am already long line waiting place orders  Thank goodness system taking orders while you're line your order pay time cashier around corner    Unfortunately found when place your order around corner unless already know what's being displayed front counter only seen several awesomely delicious looking pastries display      and likely missed everything else front counter display around corner  few more items such cookies breakfast croissant French baguette sandwiches yoghurt mixed fruit cups etc  Yea could've added items order but busy didn't want dirty looks customers line behind me    plus everybody behind he counter busy didn't want bother them      plus already ordered more enough    I ordered raisin danish ok called something raisin French but forget name spelling blueberry muffin  Yes both totally fresh yummy! However raisin pastry thought bit thin don't full usual fluffiness inside     the outer crisp nice light though  blueberry muffin very good too    and both sweet thought they'd which glad about  <EOR> This review based kouign mann   I came croissant stumbled upon display Kouign amann!! OMGOMG!! bought 4! honey  crispy outside super flaky inside  think rare stumble upo Kouign amann widely made most bakeries  macaroon didnt look pleasant  <EOR> We wandering around chicken its head cut off trying find place  ever ask directions say yes thank then few minutes later forget person just said? If you're huge casino lots shiny lights loud noises lots distractions hey happens   So finally find tiny to go bakery behind escalators  thought more sit down cafe type bakery  peer into glass case everything looked good  Then saw prices especially french baguette sandwiches which looked skinnier version Lee's sandwiches  $9   We ended getting croissant two macarons all which huge size over $3 each  know large sampling bakery offer but everything tasted just okay  some reason thought croissant would taste better ones Costco gasp!     The macarons remind giant cookies ones Cookie Monster eats holding hand  light semi chewy overly sweet  can't quite describe but smaller sized macarons Miette Patisserie SF Ferry Bldg tasted more depth flavors if  all possible non savory dessert pastry  <EOR> Food Vegas just good! Even though bakery top notch Vegas standards just A OK 3 items tried here! <EOR> Yet another disappointment yelp list winter break  don't know if because came 9PM macarons but best friend promised  did buy 5 1 free deal large ones the smaller ones would've only cost dollar less which made ??? oh well eggnog salted caramel pistachio chocolate raspberry  all flavors salted caramel definitely best then pistachio chocolate raspberry eggnog  All macarons crunchy liking  shells slightly dried didn't chewiness biting into  flavors themselves weren't vibrant  didn't feel pure taste each flavor macarons sadly    Honestly such let down but saved trip Bouchon chocolate almond croissant  never thought could croissant much but hit spot  Even though took full 5 days finish croissant thoroughly enjoyed every chocolatey bite correct if wrong but think also spread coconut between flakey buttery layers  croissant didn't stale tasted million times better lightly toasted convection oven    So definitely come chocolate almond croissant  Maybe swing earlier day fresher macarons? But past macaron experiences much better Bouchon they tasted way better lasted lot longer take caution before shell $3 cookie  <EOR> I come just macaron's  If could eat nothing but them would however checking account can't handle it  last time 12 macarons coffee spent $50  buy 5 1 free deal head  myself think am spending much just deal    When first bite into cookie slight crunch outside shell then cake consistency then chewy THEN most heavenly center anything could center goodness if sense    GAH GOOD when hits your lips    My favorite flavors chocolate vanilla    The chocolate most amazing ganache melts soon hits your tongue  Usually think vanilla plain but case here  see vanilla beans pods light sweet just amazing   STOP READING SOME!!! <EOR> Wow   gf sucker bakeries decided group   pretty damn hard find maybe just retarded    walked all around Venetian find it   But man worth search   We strapped time quickly ordered recommended Yelp    macaroons   Holy hell am huge pastry sweets fan but amazing   two favorites spiced pumpkin well vanilla   But bomb   Pistachio good well   strawberry disappointing  but may just lost glory pumpkin!  I'll definitely returning   Six macaroons $17 pretty hefty but worth it   Give try  <EOR> I came search delicious macarons boy did fail! read many rave reviews yelp regarding macarons! macarons DISGUSTING! tasted gummy crackers gone wrong nothing close macaron should taste like  bought four split between two husband ended tossing all four trash around corner  Yuck! <EOR> Oh gosh! special restaurant! must take elevator tower floor arrive special spot  Love ambiance dark wood panel windows view outside dining area  bad only bakery pastries amazingly delish because sure meal would equally awesome! wait staff impeccably dressed very professional  special place!!! <EOR> Love love love! Je suis amoureux  I didn't try Bouchon restaurant Oyster bar anything else just bakery and visited downstairs bakery   But already love everything place    The coffee delicious including lattes  pastries all looked great  But reason coming macarons    Wow! huge reasonably priced and often some special going on July buy free chocolate covered macarons   light crisp outside creamy melt in your mouth filling delicious  favorite vanilla macaron followed think pistachio  salted caramel coffee macarons worth your time well  much fan berry flavors others tend but colleagues told raspberry fantastic  may just because lot mind blowing macarons nearby where live but disappointed every since trying and even good ones small compared Bouchon's monster macarons! Fellow Yelper Vivian H  gave tip downstairs Bouchon Bakery enter Venetian right down escalator typically shorter lines upstairs grab seat on pretty fountain chow down  true!   From now must visit each time Vegas  <EOR> I've come conclusion huge macaroon person but check Bouchon because rave reviews Yelp since time kill      I hoping try carrot cake cookies but unfortunately 2pm worry plenty famous macaroons beautifully lined up  buying them sister friend decided any crazy flavors may like    I vanilla myself coffee chocolate  HUGE  http www yelp com user_local_photos?select=FpZ0Z9WfAehLwRn8TZlegw userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww  Holy moly  more fun taking picture eating think  No but good  cookies crunch them while still keeping airy texture them  filling wasn't overly sweet each own distinct flavor    They weren't cheap think $3 50 ish but heyyy some seriously awesome macaroons macaroon enthusiasts check em out  won't disappointed!

Almond brioche  Cheese danish  Croissant  Fruit tart crust   Jeers cupcakes astoundingly boring  Chocolate good but better  red velvet dry dull  carrot cake hopes but quickly dashed when tasted dayold   I thought pretty pricey average tasting baked goods especially all raves  Maybe caught baked goods off day? try again next time Vegas   BTW damn good coffee  <EOR> Funny never made Time Warner Center New York even though live there  Anyway carrot cake sandwich TKO three macarons vanilla chocolate coffee  Macarons good but actually thought big flat bit crispy  definitely weren't best macarons ever had  liked cookies better  recommend both  Overall everything delicious but considering price expected them blow away didn't  Doesn't mean won't come back but exactly having dreams them usually newly discovered sweets! <EOR> One first things wanted try Las Vegas macarons Bouchon  All friends ranting raving macarons wanted see hype all about!  guess high expectations    I expected nice large bakery but small   few selections  price macaron $3 50   cost lot more thought worth! bought 6 only because didnt know when would try them again dont know where find San Diego    Im really glad bought many because ended tasting really good!

Hate tarts often soggy stale sitting long bakeries? something three four dollars Bouchon selflessly saves tart lovers world tired pasts display shelf deception consequent grief    This humanitarian aid station found near Venetian elevators guest rooms  <EOR> Bouchon  really need adjust expectations accordingly because due hype always associated Bouchon all things awesome far all experiences bordered only OK meh my other experiences Bouchon Bakery NYC Bouchon Bev Hills     But just mostly sad  the fool once fool twice thing now fooled third time!!! During trip NYE2012 some time kill before all festivities took walk strip  spotted Bouchon bakery excitedly pointed bestie place suppose BEST MACARONS! all excited picked pre boxed mini 6 $12 share bunch different flavors bask its glory    The first 3 box straight stale  wouldn't realized until last 3 realized much better tasting those were  $2 each dinky unacceptable    In future would definitely question pre boxed stuff ask long sitting there  premium price tag should mean consistency    I am disappoint  <EOR> Bouchon Bakery BEST MACAROONS EVER!

This definitely stop next visit Vegas! <EOR> When Bouchon Bakery usually thing macarons  just can't resist those delicious giant cookies  best town  Expensive but worth price  Everything done right love cookies whoopie pies yes even cupcakes    Pricy yes but worth every penny  Most recently discovered TKOs precisely did packing quite punch taste buds  <EOR> Recently stayed Venetian Bouchon located right before entrance guest room elevators   always tempting buy something everytime passed by   lines long everything display case looked mouthwatering!  I wanted niece try place because she loves macarons   She 6 pack macarons   raspberry pistachio strawberry lemonade coffee vanilla bean salted caramel   coffee pistachio best tasting flavors   others good but good   We did try few other baked goods but cannot recall exact names them anymore   remember all tasted quite good though   Surprisingly prices very reasonable well   We definitely Bouchon Bakery must visit stop whenever we're Venetian  <EOR> Bouchon Bakery actually pretty decent  food looked amazing wife thrilled visit since she mad croissant fan   But can't give them more 3 stars  expected way more pastries pecan roll good but nothing swoon over   So A OK is  Would nicer if little cheaper seating closer  ended getting lost looking place sit just ended Coffee Bean Tea Leaf upstairs  But definitely nice little quick breakfast if your buffet night before left more bloated old Elvis  <EOR> I high expectations little bakery stand because Bouchon attached heard great things restaurant  However little disappointed visit here  decided red velvet cupcake caramel macchiato  $3 50 cupcake good deal size muffin! Most cupcakes same price but pretty dinky size  frosting wasn't overly sweet red velvet nice moist  tad bit doughy though but nonetheless pretty good  coffee however where things start going downhill  Maybe came bad day maybe new worker but caramel macchiato before various coffee places never this  $5 smallest size when picked cup surprised light cup compared other girls ordered other Lattes such  opened cup found filled halfway foam barely any coffee asked barista if correct order  He just kept saying  suppose be  didn't seem right but any case didn't scene it  $5 half cup bitter coffee foam well worth it! also few other things sandwiches such but all bit pricey  Expected suppose since Vegas  <EOR> This place amazing  Flaky fresh pastries  little expensive but totally worth it  Eating patio authentic experience  <EOR> It pricey   might things you're craving   might wait line   But Thomas Keller baked goods everything crunchy flaky epi bread TKO his Oreo equivalent which its own flavor texture addictive worth all that   tucked under escalator front theater next Venetian hotel tower elevator must stop every time stay there  <EOR> I heard hidden Bouchon happy find last day Las Vegas if anything because jonesing some coffee   They all baked goods other locations have  surprised though did find coffee good when main sit down location two days prior  tasted little burnt maybe? certainly drinkable but divine   Either way would hesitate come back location fast more central casino happenings  doesn't same ambiance other locations course but great if you're go  <EOR>
