I always use avoid eating ramen since restaurants around town always tiny crazy packed when weather cold rainy  Waiting 30+ minutes worth Especially when already hangry  use frequent Jinya but started notice screw toppings broth  price steep add ons just don't hook use to  Thier service lacking well  use #1 spot when opened few years back sadly slowly downhill there  Props takoyaki though!   OHJAH warmed quickly like comforting bowl ramen   Here's why 1  never wait table  2  Attentive service employees eager help 3  Food served shockingly quick 4  Quality ingredients wholesome flavorful balanced broth not oily salty light 5  Thick perfectly meaty fatty sliced chashu! Totally drool worthy! Order extra always!  6  Prices reasonable isn't $5 2 thinly sliced paper thin chasu every other ramen joint 7  Most importantly skimp toppings broth! hope never changes!   *Recommendations The takoyaki great 4 5  The tonkatsu favorite 5 5  My toppings chashu menma bamboo scallion soft boiled egg corn seaweed wood ear mushrooms 5 5   *Pro tip Ask toppings side black garlic oil spicy chili paste  add nice kick your ramen isn't overly spicy  just extra $1 chili $1 garlic oil but definitely enough split between two people! Add your broth taste 5 5  *Secret menu Garlic lover? Ask fresh garlic  hand tool crush bulbs yourself then blend crushed garlic into your broth! Really packs flavorful punch  love it  5 5 <EOR> My sister came pick told going Ohjah thought Oh!

Possibly new fav ramen spot  back soon! <EOR> While Vegas craving some epic ramen  searching coming conclusion all good places off strip ended taking  quick 15 minute drive spot  Luckily place wasn't packed immediately seated  Everything looked good menu quite difficult decide ended getting ton stuff  ended getting everything gyoza chicken karage even fried rice  course ramen but favorite part meal fried rice  Imagine fried rice Bennihanas but million times better bigger cheaper  Everything else pretty tasty but man oh man would totally trip just fried rice alone  Next time planning ordering huge plate all myself! Overall if you're area craving some yummy Japanese cuisine then definitely check spot out  <EOR> Heard Ohjah through Yelp whilst browsing through good finds came across let tell environment appealing aesthetic quiet! Ramen bomb! back sure! <EOR> This place great ambiance  servers friendly attentive  When Saturday night didn't wait long  ordered Ohjah Ramen boy yummy! portion huge well broth ratio meat items came with  flavor broth rich oily all   enjoyed place much!!! <EOR> A few months ago noticed place would opening soon since husband frequents Freedom Firearms few doors down  twice far am happy finally good ramen place near house! favorite still Chinatown but good option days don't time drive down there    The menu similar other ramen places choose your ramen option add additional toppings well extra noodles  also fried rice fried noodles appetizers side dishes  far tried Shoyu Miso Ramen  Shoyu good but favorite Miso because broth rich very flavorful  usually avoid drinking much any ramen broth obvious reasons but just take few sips since good!  Service excellent! staff very friendly attentive  check few times really tell care want provide great service  drawback though don't curry  think side curry bowl menu would awesome!
