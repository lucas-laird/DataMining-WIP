All marinated course  complement each other quite well    The rice some ground pork top  didn't much meaningful flavor  tea flavored pork chop standout meal  Nicely fried resonating flavor  Portion size excellent charge   The milk tea instantly forgettable  Might come back try some more popular ones matcha ice cream milk tea    Service mediocre  3 5 stars overall  quick easy comfort food  <EOR> Spent 15 dollars two medium bobas  think  really ridiculous especially when service sucked  <EOR> Huge menu full things probably never heard about    There tons tea drinks assortment foods cooked tea   Every time come try order something new   Honestly sometimes when look items menu ask myself just making stuff up? always end having something good but amazing     While place gets crowded service far good drinks aren't expensive lots choose from   last visit cold Wintermelon milk tea   can't really describe wintermelon looks since never seen but taste pretty mild satisfying     This fun place experience food beverages most likely never before   Before come expect less stellar service you'll no problem getting most station tea  <EOR> on VACAY yet still craving some Jasmine Milk Tea w pudding!

Worst customer service ever  Server name Yi rude taking order walked away us  Once food brought table hair chicken wings     Sure won't return <EOR> I'm impress!  roommate always boba tea thought give try   I bit disappointed   Parking stinks over priced service structure confusing   only thing think amount seating space but if getting something very frustrating because don't area wait   People kept running into confuse where drink   stand front station where servers picked drinks would never gotten drink   and ask if drink   server looked very doubtful drink because did reciept drink   girl took drink let know drink   even funnier staff making drinks bad mouthing customer where he standing while waiting drinks Mandarin   don't believe customer understood Mandarin bc saying wasn't pleasant    It's bad place but if patience drive circles around building looking parking space then place you   if having people running into seated standing waiting your order drinks place   and if over pay drink   ding ding ding bingo place  I would suggest going Ranch 99 shopping center boba place   but just suggestion  <EOR> I apologize but screw owner place      0 stars would more it   having great time enjoying tea desserts until gentleman sitting corner told quiet loud SSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Pardon laughing friend's funny story   asked employees he said he owner   again     screw place  <EOR> Just came snow ice boba tea didn't realize food too!

Remember ask extra sweet butter! D    RECOMMENDATIONS TIPS Stay away Chicken Curry definitely subpar at least time tried overcooked looks and tastes TV dinner food or leftovers gross   ALSO come during lunch instead because lunch specials include reduced priced milk tea drink your choice      DETAILS DETAILS DETAILS                                               Atmosphere Even just dining area there's hardly ever wait   People come some fast authentic Taiwanese food atmosphere reflects that   no frills place serves drinks to go meals those want place sit when hot summer freezing cold winter outside     Service Like most Chinese restaurants eateries biggest complaint when food arrives   If party 5 more don't count eating same time because serve food comes your table   always seems lagging entrée appetizer drink dish prevents having completely satisfying meal   servers sometimes shy neglect say hello  thank you  Food Quality Selection The food just average   Depending order may above average! LOL  portions generous enough Asian diet but may enough others consider ordering appetizers well perhaps Sweet Butter Toast Fried Tofu    If order Dumplings prepared last entrée served because time takes steam them      Pricing Value Convenience Overall would say restaurant good value simple fast authentic Chinese food Las Vegas    find myself coming back every time come Vegas because value   well priced food comparable   although think venture other restaurants Chinatown Vegas would probably return least milk tea drinks still probably best town  <EOR> I've only ordered Strawberry Milk Slush but often drive way it  almost strawberry cheesecake boba form  must try!!! <EOR> When comes Boba Milk Tea hands down some best I believe tea boiled leaf powder which correct way    However service could should bit friendlier which why gave them only 3 Stars  <EOR> In LV likely best spot Tea   Although franchise love tea no boba other add ins   The best thing Osmanthus tea half sweet   Friends liked popcorn chicken peach black tea Matcha milk tea green tea ice cream   Bathrooms aren't very clean separate men women Cash credit card accepted      Am definitely coming back! Love! <EOR> Their boba delicious but service could really improve  quite attentive friendly especially when gets little crowded    I suggest Matcha Green Tea w Boba  Comes generous amount green tea ice cream top your actual drink  <EOR> Came Boba drink something eat daughter no sign saying please wait seated sat nearest table server asked move next table rudely place busy plenty tables open available   If business wants start signing seats customer should greet customers sign stating please wait seated !!!! favorite hang didn't mind customer service low greeting terrible just came Boba drink  Now business lost customer  Tea Station definitely all that! Taking business elsewhere! <EOR> My drink actually okay can't complain that   issue them stamp your stamp card unless pay using gift card  WTF kind stupid policy that!  Maybe LA Vegas different policies but know sure multiple Tea Stations policy     Other thoughts boba wasn't chewy be   Taro bbtea EXTREMELY powdery worst had  Maybe time thing but wont coming back find out  <EOR> As name suggests great place all kinds tea   milk tea close gets ones Taiwan   Although bubba tends slightly overcooked   am fan food here      it's really just drink dessert place! <EOR> My favorite Milk Tea spot!!

This place good dinner fancy kind  also good lunch snack!! definitely recommend friends definitely again when visiting Vegas! <EOR> I used come all time when college  still where everyone seems bubble tea even though now more options around area  said place ALWAYS packed evenings especially weekends  Save your time your order to go try somewhere else Saturday nights  quality pricing menu variation decent nothing groundbreaking  cafe located centrally China Town quick 10 minutes Las Vegas Strip  Energetic ambiance due place always being packed  also serve food but bit overpriced compared similar items other restaurants area   A few less ideal comments parking lot always packed dimly lit I actually don't really feel safe parking walking car if park behind all restaurants back lot because there's pretty much no real lighting area  True story chased homeless person car when leaving Tea Station few years ago  service staff could smile bit more AKA least look they're enjoying serving you  few questionable interactions staff even regular  only accept $10 minimum any credit card charges  bathroom also kind gross could definitely benefit remodel regular cleaning sorry say it!   <EOR> Stopped some boba dining Ichiza    Though bit confusing first time coming since everyone busy behind counter left looked restaurant   Stood bit bewildered   walked out   looked yelp again   yeah serve boba gotta place   walked back drinks happy again  <EOR> Best boba town! It gets only 3 stars because comparing SF LA boba  good if you're rush but still worth it! staff normally friendly but place where leave your own thing group you're which really refreshing certain occasions   really flag down servers if need attention  sad thing seem periodically raise price no sort stamp card rewards system place  boba cooked very well but soon price drive away completely   Try matcha green milk tea it's yummy scoop green tea ice cream! boba milk tea hot during winter mango shaved ice it's seasonal takoyaki  <EOR> Our drinks tasted fine however am service  lack of   There eight all ordered different drinks different sugar levels  girl taking order did fine job she didn't mix anything up  Once handed drinks different story  Let ask this if group orders bunch different drinks wouldn't common sense label cups know which which? When asked which drinks which she took guess then told why don't just sip each cup then know never anyone tell Tea Station trust plenty    I gladly donate box sharpies them write down names if needed  don't even started whole stamp card policy  <EOR> Service slow    standing register 15 minutes no even acknowledged us!  ordered Taro Almond Boba nothing special! <EOR> Service better time around  Even if crappy still think its best boba had  <EOR> Service VASTLY improved since last review four months ago   Four months ago general attitude place pretty much 'burn down build new one' now 'hmm   didnt use hate place? oh well   '  So yeah staff MUCH more attentive customers despite being full being empty    They no longer decks playing cards available loan nor lot places plug electronics juice but free wifi isnt bad   Been coming enough establish few favorites Mixed Fruit Tea hot cold When served hot could little sweet side 'omg mouth burning but dont want spit because kinda tastes good but holy crap causing lots pain' type hot  nice little perk if finish tea open little pot pieces fruit used flavor your tea Served cold boba yourself treat    Ginger Logan Tea hot when feeling sick during winter months  Very mellow soothing tea tastes bit honeydew melon  Again open pot eat re hydrated logans inside   Instant Beef flavored Noodle Egg Ham It's instant noodle fried egg slice thin processed ham  5 50  right mind would pay 5 50 instant noodles cheap enhancements  Normally wouldnt but cant identify brand instant noodle cheap enhancements just taste damn good   Will keep ordering only replenish occasional craving sodium   Honorable Mentions Spicy Chicken Wings Yeah 'spicy' understatement   Are really spicy? if you're used eating Korean food sucking crawfish shrimp heads Hot Juicy then no wings spicy glass milk  Still they're seasoned nicely juicy inside while lightly crisp outside   Been Yelp'ed Possibly Never Again Fried Wontons Bland lot flavor nothing special  Teriyaki Chicken Where start   Chicken grill marks but very little grilled flavor also very little teriyaki flavor  rice teriyaki sauce didnt well together  rice moist instead soak sauce just blanded sauce up  Looked good picture but grab instant noodle next time  Tea flavored Japanese Style Ramen Yeah   didnt taste tea all   Broth tasted heavily pickled bamboo which also floats around soup  Priced higher larger serving compared instant noodle egg ham but didnt tastes good   Spicy Fried Chicken Another case where 'spicy' understatement  pieces lack consistency  big meaty juicy inside another small dried but crunchy there's bunch others float middle  breading little heavy seasoned enough  <EOR> Came few friends visiting LA   friends obsession place    Butter Toast side scoop Vanilla Ice Cream If Butter Vanilla Ice Cream then might just find yourself new habit!   fat slice Toast tasted sugar crusted bar butter! slice toast came warm cold ice cream   'Ahhh'     Kinda reminded Lava Cake Chart House Morton's   Just melted mouth   felt pretty guilty eating but worth sugar fix butter fix?!   Watermelon Juice Boba tough time choosing drink since many combinations choose from  noticed chalkboard hanging wall special items written it  saw watermelon love watermelon especially during blazing summer heat! thought most refreshing choice just added boba  Fresh tasted sticking straw into actual watermelon! boba itself right chew sweetness  nice choice cool yourself down!   Place Clean Simple happy bright colors   typical boba restaurant decor  Service prices fine  Decent spot drink cool off high off butter! <EOR> So enjoy food drinks but when seated trying eat service bit slow  time day busy all but employees seems pre occupied each other  Its quicker walk counter order want then sit wait them take your order seems  Other food drinks awesome  tried yogurt green tea boba interesting good! something ive ever found back home hawaii  think place would well hawaii  tea chicken katsu another interesting thing but def good somethingi havnt heard of  Def spot ill keep coming but most likely sit eat just because attempts ive seating eating there  <EOR> If you're going worth coming recommend ordering tea   would avoid paying overpriced boba bubble tea milk teas   However specialty teas teapots definitely worth try   tried grass jelly hot tea pot   served hot but gels gelatin cools   red beans boba maybe some other ingredients don't remember   never paid $7 $8 bubble tea before!!!  Ridiculous   I'd look nearby competitors bubble tea but food tea I'd definitely recommend checking place out   location bit inconveniently off strip near Chinatown area   place small cozy clean bright lighting  <EOR> I've going place years   Buried heart China town offers some best teas town   always brought friends try hot taro milk tea boba   friend mine lovingly calls cookie tea    recommend every one   They strange atmosphere but sometimes think willing blend   Just visiting different country going into restaurant different culture experience   think all reviews talking when mention service   friendly?  No   accommodating?   Certainly not   try be?  all   respect that   So long serve quality tea can't find elsewhere back  <EOR> This place really gone down hill! Used best place boba food but while price remained same quality changed    More expensive compared other boba places but service terrible quality both tea food changed lot  noodles rice plates used big yummy now bland just disappointing  drinks hit miss if lucky good if then sweet just same  Same service depending working service decent absolutely terrible    Got coconut milk tea today very strong coconut smell flavor but way sweet could finish regular size    Haven't couple years came back today because cousins visiting country liked place when visited few years back stick Brew Tea!! <EOR> What say Tea Station except only spot used boba Vegas   Other spots did stand quality drinks Tea Station   other locations California am glad taste drinks same     The drinks little sweet but always order them half sweet which tastes better because boba itself already sweet     Try Milk Slush brown sugar those really hot days! <EOR> Rose milk tea? YESSSSSS   Let's real place super annoying  parking atrocious usually going next door main Chinatown plaza walking over thing if you're going right when open credit card minimum obnoxious $10 but top service also nonexistent someone please come take money?   However if know you're drinks snacks great  <EOR> I enjoy Boba less Milk Tea time time establishment open late convenient location Spring Mountain  fairly close workplace   The inside gleaming very modern esque tables booths floor tea sets availble   Tea Station actually chain being only Vegas     Onto tea!   So milk teas lot   They're SUPER sweet but they're rich tasteful enjoy without actual boba it   syrup teas all very sugary sweet if your first time recommend almond tea few boba try it    would try around different tea houses Spring Mountain because two them actually made them fresh ingredients artificial syrups     They also tea flavored snacks hot treats such soups takoyaki WOOOO TAKOYAKI!    Beware takoyaki HOT center even if exterior seems cool   fried Tofu also nom nom nom but remember place meant snacks comfort food   meal elsewhere but having quick bite more appropriate   You take your Boba tea discounted price well   I find night crew anywhere near par day crew   day staff pleasant talkative cheerful   night crew rather forcefully shoo close closing time very short sometimes difficult talk to   roommate can't stand staff point she won't past five  <EOR> Your service sucks !!!! come back !!! servers rude didn't know give good customer service   I'm very disappointed !!!! Will recommend anyone come here    Vey poor service !!!!  They need improve customer service <EOR> I'm surprise rating Tea Planet    it should more stars    cos me   is really good   they good selection drinks   I pick different drinks all time   and always good   I love thick toast   and food great   I've lot Taiwanese boba places  in NYC SF but favorite   = <EOR> Fast  clean  Great boba  perfect amount chewiness  Matter fact think stop now taro smoothie boba  Yum! poetically extra friend  <EOR> When first moved Las Vegas newfound friends took some boba  never knew such drink dessert existed until introduced them grateful did because able share favorites yelp* anyone ever agree 100%!

JUST paid     receipt prove it  guessing she just confused   but still    rude  green milk tea location definitely no where good San Diego Fremont California  super excited drink too     but ended tasting whatever  good next day because hungover   but other wouldn't come back while Vegas  <EOR> I first introduced Tea Station last night  best friends town having dinner decided come desert  first time place pretty stoked see boba selection  pretty busy last night but seated right away waitress very helpful cordial  ordered brick bread hot almond milk tea gotta say DELICIOUS    orders didn't take long come everything just right tasty    My only gripe prices drinks payed $60 4 people    Yikes!  The service good drinks great! definitely back again <EOR> I am upset last experience here  saw lights late night group kids ordering when walked however worker mopping floors asked if still able serve us assuming okay since people literally ordering moment woman cleaning told if paid cash fine  Since boyfriend only card said would right back because cash car  parked just off side grabbed wallet headed straight back in  walked noticed cashier distraught look face if she irritated last customers come double checked if okay because didn't cash first time walked she trying tell system already shut down but she didn't understand assuming because other woman said if paid cash would able serve drinks  annoying when employee okays something when clearly did communicate each other going on  didn't want upset irritate even more having 2 more drinks which would taken extra THREE minutes worth closing procedures?? but mostly did want spend money anymore because worked service industry many years customer should always come first  rude demanding things coming late thing but polite very apologetic because all wanted boba fix  very poorly showed any interest accommodating us  She very hesitantly said she would serve but genuine all  instantly turned off lost craving  apologized inconvenience very polite even said thank you  Hopefully she felt little regret wished she just helped us  never Tea Station again  Since woman refused service refuse spend money establishment  <EOR> I'm lover anything matcha green tea  macha green tea boba milkshake matcha icecream bomb diggity! sucked whole large cup dry! food ok  bathroom really dirty outdated  flush wasn't working  hope fix that  <EOR> the order  milk tea  good milk tea adjusted taste   boba come expect tea station   enough satisfy boba craving! <EOR> I really think 3 stars bit generous   My review place long overdue countless times going here   Honestly think only reason giving them 2 stars because cafe serves its purpose sit your tea or if you're craving street food all means it then out   It's very convenient your drink give somewhat prompt service   But service when comes sit in horrendous   Along trash talking Mandarin customers they're pretty deficient hospitality department   Short story time bill came around $15   gave $25 since big bills   does sense keep change   $10 tip?  kidding me?  ask change when she gave short couple dollars cents   left no tip  Just know bit better tend tip ONLY if service ridiculous   never given any tip because bad food  something risk customers   But city where tip percentage among highest nation believe tip should reflection establishment's hospitality   Thus she received no tip  <EOR> This place awesome! always come friends staff food boba always great  shave ice dessert huge!! place never disappoint <EOR> One few places town offer great Taiwanese food  But staff inattentive prices steep have   Also heard cleanliness restaurant cleanly place is       just avoid bathroom altogether wreck  <EOR> I came first time couple weeks ago small group friends  shared pot hot taro milk tea pearls cousin pretty good  place seems hit miss though other people group didn't really got  passion fruit tea juice sweet black barley tea didn't taste good  sure better pearl tea places there  <EOR> If could give establishment zero stars would! star giving them much credit! just left place experiencing WORST service! waitress decided would good idea take order without writing down  Well  when things started head downhill  ordered two Taro Bobas which served no problems  also ordered garlic chicken wings which missing garlic sauce basically PLAIN chicken wings Strike 1   also ordered  beef instant ramen which pointed menu she nodded yes  stupidly thought nodding yes she understood wanted order soup  However waiting 30 minutes   the soup NEVER arrived table Strike 2   asked waitress when soup going arrive she mumbled something walked away  Then she came back table menu hand  SAME MENU SHE NODDED YES 30 MINUTES AGO? happened? Your super human memory failed you? She told something wrong computer which why order never placed Strike 3   Sounds little suspicious because rather busy when your computer didn't any problems ringing orders customers arrived but somehow order placed 30 mins before didn't your computer ? Sounds someone trying play fool! believe computer issue fact waitress decided would good idea memorize order rather writing down ensure correct  She NO PROBLEM picking piece paper pen take down order customers sat down us  why didn't she write down order? Because only two people order short? obvious she needs START WRITING orders down because she couldn't even accurately place order 4 items! Also why llie? if you're going lie use better excuse  think your customers stupid? wouldn't upset if just honest told forgot but instead would rather try deceive me! Train your staff better because your service atrocious! <EOR> I usually come lot never complain anything  When came time  ordered icy strawberry jelly drink squid balls wings    When drink took sip    OMG seriously thought drank pure Strawberry syrup crushed ice  sweet ask water pour half dilute it  didn't bother complaining because fixed water    Other wings slightly over cooked loved squid balls  <EOR> the fruit blends boba almond milk tea oh yummy! toast sugar sinfully good only reason why 3 stars because service so  <EOR> This place completely horrible service  come your table minute sit down if aren't ready order won't come back another 10 minutes unless somehow flag them down [ but usually pretend see you]   Their drinks mediocre best  don't seem cook boba consistent basis  also minimum purchase amount each person table  charged two dollar fee if don't meet it   The only reason really because only places town where boba 9  Other wouldn't waste time  <EOR> I stopped busy morning some tea  really just blew mind Tapioca ice milk tea boba! bowl noodles  Tea flavored beef noodles think called? Both amazing  broth very flavorful rich soaked into all contents beef carrots noodles making them both very tender complimenting natural tastes very well  boba tea very chewy nice delicate flavor  tasted fresh  server quick getting things very polite  definitely stopping again! <EOR> Only putting two stars because boba other customer service garbage flat rude feel uncomfortable because obvious talking badly language even manager isn't professional <EOR> I live Cali always tea station Cerritos decided try LV  Bad bad service guys name see ce don't know  But reason said werent welcoming cousins cause busy shouldn't excuse  Aside tea really really good  bad didn't LV  FYI only accept credit card if spend over 10  <EOR> I haven't place forever! spot every time visiting Las Vegas! bubble teas snacks scrumptious!

The servers didn't check all  all disappeared back  Waited another 10 mins put order  could left without them noticing    This place really gone downhill since last  think used wait 20 mins parking before just drink them  <EOR> After experience last night returning here   My friend's decided boba having pho nearby  all frequent different boba places pretty often Tea Station before   We walked no greeting which normal order to go  flipping through menu briefly settled small large Thai tea slush fried taro balls  Total came $23    or did it?  The server brought Thai teas then slush shortly thereafter  waiting another 10 minutes fried taro balls showing finally asked server long would until did  He responded put taro balls your boba  fried taro balls  explained supposed fried taro ball food item add into drink  would think  simple misunderstanding taken care right? WRONG  When told should fried taro he answered back extremely matter of factly well did SAY FRIED taro ball? don't THINK so    now    isn't first rodeo  know difference between fried taro balls taro added into your drink  Knowing sure asked FRIED taro balls didn't want big deal told he must understood could just fried taro balls since already charged them  He said charged  told total $23 charged them  Apparently because he started naming prices drinks  $7 51 LARGE THAI TEA  $6 SOMETHING SMALL  WHAT?! NEVER charged much Thai tea anywhere ever  Even when know fact brewed properly just some powder  alcoholic drinks strip less that!  Anyway    he smug look face soon told fried taro balls lack thereof if say gotcha! Terrible service  No attempt rectify situation  Prices high  used come often  visit reminded why stopped  won't coming back  Especially abundance boba places all around China town  Almost anywhere seems better choice point  <EOR> why continue  come back even while desperate boba tea? customer service horrible! Doesn't matter if last year year guy girl      just horrible ! blame bad management  Won't returning! <EOR> I going tea station many years  noticed last handful times people work EXTREMELY rude   I last night when friend walk lady does greet us  She asks go  say sit down  When she FINALLY comes take order some questions her  She answered them but did seem happy it  tell need few more minutes    She walks away doesn't come back 10 minutes  soon fed friend gets attention male employee  He seemed especially annoyed  When he asked if wanted medium large said medium  Before he walked off asked if medium smallest size  simply double checking  He said YES rude tone stormed off    The drinks eh  better past  once did server check us  we're clearly finished she ignores doesn't bring check  Mind place busy all  ask it  She brings over   Another 5 minutes later she continues ignore us  even looking around clearly ready pay  She still doesn't come over  hand bill cards asking split it  She mumbles okay walks off    At point done  didn't tip them ALWAYS tip but worst customer service very long time  take business elsewhere  looks place pretty awful reviews bad service yet continue nothing? okay  won't returning tea station  <EOR> I'm mad right now want curse review but going to  inside five minutes didn't even order anything because made mad left  slightly busy nobody greets there's no clear line system people waiting place orders  standing think line but maybe middle floor still sure   the server walked past didn't acknowledge say excuse    Keep mind server  inches away because large place  1st all customer should greet me  2nd all common courtesy say excuse when come into contact another within 6 inches   After he rudely walked past maybe 10 times boiling inside left  Literally all keep customer say hello busy right now help soon done something that  Also    more employee could helped just man ignored left worst impression    Today lost great customer  loyal establishments order lot always tip  take $ else where <EOR> From awful parking situation attitude encountered mistake made end Meh  experienced better    The Tea Station located Spring Mountain  If live d Las Vegas spent any time recently much more need said other parking sucks!

Does some flavor? answers all three questions YES  Therefore place qualifies five stars  If some other foods munch your boba milk tea Thai iced tea etc there's plenty options well  <EOR> So far Tea Station handful times every time experience solid  also conveniently open late which great when go to boba shop Kung Fu Tea closed  would definitely return Tea Station try massive drink selection    Drinks Boba average above average compared majority boba shops tried Vegas  boba always cooked properly plus boba doesn't taste dishwater!!

Toast sugar butter? amazing   If want more meaty salty snack  Definitely squid balls if you're adventurous down seafood snacks! Its tasy seafood flavor but eat expecting might imitation seafood artificial seafood because texture sort feels way   I think service subpar  job  but glad best impression whether would happy tone greeting smile  <EOR> This second time coming dont  plan coming back  Although drinks delicious service worst  friends only allowed 40 minutes order even though still hour left clock  waiter spent half 40 minutes ignoring us  finally getting attention order tells they're boba  What?! work boba place California boba any drink even if 5 minutes before closing  customers very important given great service them happy more likely come back   wasn't able finish taro slushy asked waitress nearby if could cup lying friend Lia noticed well waitress rolls eyes flipped head sound  woah!

Tea Station same plaza Ichiza parking toughie sometimes since very limited number spots plaza may parking deities your quest well! <EOR> This place horrible service!  straight point! Never coming again!!!! worth aggravation!! <EOR> Had almond milk tea just okay   watered down lacked flavor     The service definitely best but stays pretty busy   suppose know right thing order   I prefer Volcano because service outstanding boba teas blow place water   <EOR> Late night drive back California     definitely need fuel some tea!  Saw special week month Iced Milk Green Tea w boba made sure only put half sugar  still tasted liiiittle sweeter normal and know because many other Tea Stations caffeine definitely helped drive home   Service ok decently fast to go drinks  Place seems gets packed easily since limited space especially near ordering counter   One thing really did some waiters just smoking directly outside within few feet store entrance  Right when opened door  when leaving huuuge whiff smoke nowhere run hide  thing if other random customers because can't really tell them where but waiters definitely don't need any worse     ugh  <EOR> I hate place! used come everyday 10+ yrs! Yes 10 yrs! typo  am addicted boba  You'd think someone comes everyday would treat better  place! petty stuff doesn't matter buying gift card earn stamps putting much ice if ask less give attitude because cheat amount tea drink  it  Business business  However someone brings much business ridiculous mark up! pay just lil under $7 per drink! Times everyday 10+ years  tolerate rude ass service because drinks  dont much options CA does continued go! anymore!!! Thank god found place better everything better service drinks price!  Icy Juicy Spring Mtn Jones! pay $4ish drink because come everyday treat great! best value Icy Juicy  Authentic taiwanese drinks less w wayyyyy better service cant wrong!  Today going Tea Station 3 years now and counting cuz took business else where     came back imagine told couldnt serve Rose milk tea apparently still remember less ice which ask it  Excuse a hole?? want charge cup full ice nerve tell only regular ice? Did forget Im customer dont drinks watered down? Plus pay $7 it? told them else where tell never back! Management doesnt care either  bunch cheap chinese shit heads here!

Never look back say! drinks bit pricey but can't really find any other milk teas around taste good T <EOR> OVER RATED!!!!   I remember back days when place use spot be  Now all competition around China Town would last place would go    Haven't awhile but since near area wanted some Thai Tea decided stop by    Reason 1 star  I walked workers look unconvinced them coming in  walk straight area greeted Hello more told them order Large Thai Tea please $6 22    OMG $6 22 kidding me!!!!! Thai Tea  Dang  extra value meal McDonalds    Once drink expecting best $6 22 Thai ice tea boba life     Well    sure didn't happen! Thai tea watered down boba hard!   Bad service bad drink! Very upsetting! sure coming back again!   FYI everyone all lot more tea places near area  <EOR> Oh Tea Station where shall begin? pretty good friends when started know each other but then abusive ex gf started showing your bad points really quickly  going place months but sampling other boba tea places around area now know better places where customers actually treated respect  Why bring respect when talking cafe? Because all service  lack thereof case    There two wait staff members boy girl always seem giving only but other customers hard time when ordering drinks  even experimented different ways order drinks Pointing drinks drink counter speaking slowly enunciating each word learning Taiwanese Okay maybe last but might well have  lower aggravation pissy meter off wait staff members  Nothing works  often annoyed angry can't your order right first time  worked front house cafes before larger establishment once showed signs level discontent disrespect guys show  gotten being embarrassed thinking made mistake being embarrassed don't know customer service  Probably only constructive criticism say retrain two wait members touch screen punch your own orders save time money customers    But enough bad good drinks consistently good some very good helpful members team older pudgy guy usually mixes drinks young short girl always seem happy job   I would give place star if wasn't consistency food drinks  Remember people eat places good food drink but only comeback if good service match   My advice? Why take abuse?

The service always fast good whether sit down order go  only few times but I'd definitely give another chance try something different mango green tea  <EOR> This only place Vegas trust boba milk tea  tried numerous places always just end asking myself Why didn't just Tea Station? Tea Station consistent drinks every time order just imagine it  drinks never sweet unlike other places where feels drinking melted ice cream  love different milk teas when mood iced tea love getting White Peach Oolong    I usually drinks to go never experienced any problems customer service  Yes prices little higher but don't mind paying consistency deliciousness perfection  <EOR> You tell tea isn't fresh  tastes sitting all day  Compared other branches doesn't compare  service par because waiters waitresses tend talk amongst themselves sometimes end ignoring customers  only because use Ten Ren branded tea  Even though offer free Wi Fi never works  always tells down  price more expensive too  <EOR> This place used boba shop couple years back since location pretty convenient course before any newer boba shops opened around it  Now just place when need hang spot place meet friends because busy cause friends just want boba fix  drinks pretty average! Nothing special honestly    only real good thing matcha milk tea w ice cream boba! I'd definitely recommend any matcha lovers cause drink gives right amount matcha flavor even if you're fan you'll still find really savory Ive let friends fans flavor try loved LOL   actually number seller stays true that  But  probably it  idea having tea based foods intrigued when first heard it  Noodle dishes don't stand much  haven't tried many other foods though saying food sucks lol  If eat definitely recommend trying takoyaki balls though! Just sure eat them right away you'll burn you're tongue LOL tea flavored fried chicken rolls actually pretty good too  Service hit miss  all just depends cashier server is  bit traditional sometimes engaging conversations asking questions menu hard but  really inevitable since said more traditional boba shop rather more hip americanized  ones let's say kft chewy boba  Giving place three stars because only couple drinks food good because sometimes service terrible rude workers sometimes service somewhat decent  hating workers but lot times they're really friendly welcoming ' If ever drop try matcha milk tea w ice cream grab yourself bite takoyaki balls! Pretty standard basic things recommend but they're pretty good lmao  <EOR> Came few times because open little later Chinatown  2 stars because spicy wonton chicken wings other would come here  Service horrible! really need improve customer service skills if really want locals come back <EOR> I came best friends town son  thought knew ordering but no idea until bit into it  When saw menu looked thought crispy spring roll  wrong ! outside wasn't crispy all looked shriveled skin  tried really hard try eat them because friend treating didn't want rude  pretended really good said good should really try some   friend took didn't another that  tried eat third but while friend son looking all teas spit napkin  couldn't take anymore   finally told friend she understood because she didn't them either  glad same taste!   I also tried Taro Balls which really good  fried golden brown sweet  friend's son also Honey Dew Slurpee drink he let try  didn't want give back ! tasted better then Lychee drink having ! <EOR> After heavy dinner some family wanted something cool drink  place always busy first impression every time area  Service only OK but things come fairly quickly but once items delivered soon forgotten next group enters  Tasty Drinks but kinda overpriced compared other places  <EOR> Being boba fanatic when saw tea station excited because tea station both Fremont San Diego both very good  However when ordered royal milk tea tasted very fake  menu said earl grey tea but tasted remotely similar  Also never asked level sweetness wanted which recall being pretty big point chain  boba balls good though! didn't drink didn't give satisfying boba feeling  friends rose milk tea regular milk tea none them tasted great either  did appreciate nice seating open during Xmas Eve    Didn't try food because eat dinner but menu fancy food looked tantalizing  Oh also want comment music  appreciate good old jay Chou classics  Whoever chose music must really jay fan bcuz nonstop jay Chou 30 mins there  No complaints though! <EOR> I'm only remaining member family regularly Tapioca Tea Rooms even though introduced them kids when teen agers  best Boba Joint back then Tea Planet place known Tea Station now called    What good Tapioca Tea Room? wide selection Teas without Tapioca Balls  good selection snacks    Tea Station provides ample selection snacks outright meals  ambiance aimed teen age crowd decor tell when walk into Tea Station don't teen ager frequent establishment  fact don't even order Tapioca Teas  bench seating against right wall enter runs entire length establishment    handsome teak tables chairs further define seating spaces  Very classy nice atmosphere   My favorite Tea Tapioca Green Milk Tea Green Milk Tea Honey    both Tapioca balls   My favorite snacks are       Tea Boiled Egg    Chinese Sausages    Fried Tofu    Bean Cake     Braised Pork Preserved Vegetables    Instant Ramen 1 Egg    Picked Ground Pork Rice     Why doesn't kids Boba anymore? They're mid 20s now they've graduated friends finer eating establishments  main reason give crowd Tea Station mainly non Asian now    them taken over different crowd   After five years having Tapioca Tea Tea Station    seems definitely changed  ordered Green Milk Tea Tapioca right dinner Ichiza upstairs Tea Station  wait staff seems little older little less friendly  course could mad only two persons waiting 70% filled establishment past could four persons waiting customers  also rule all Tea Stations person can't sit any tables without ordering snack meal    ridiculous! crowd getting little older also    age crowd weekday 11pm seemed more late 30s predominantly teen age college age crowd back when lived Las Vegas  But ethnicity people time night contradicted kids said declining Asian audience    over 70% people 11pm Asian   One thing hasn't changed though Tea good ever  <EOR> The owner really need fire all kids! don't know why r working if all horsing around ignore customers  drink should take 25 mins make   no excuse  Starbucks million times busier drink came less 5 mins  Last all don't expect tip u u gave attitude!!!! want find owns joint complaint  <EOR> A fine place your tea boba cravings satiated but many faults place location barely give recommendation  Located Chinatown place apparently hot spot college Asian crowd visits Saturday nights  Parking atrocious  Tea Station located two story plaza several businesses limited parking  crowded Saturday night expect circle perimeter find elusive parking spot  Service so so bit rushed  payment annoying there's minimum use your card  Ugh    Drinks good food average  really depends familiar tea other items  love taro hot taro milk tea without boba simply going back 90's slang bomb  ginger jasmin tea  bit strong though  Prices bit high some damn tea  always buy smallest portion available  Food isn't good enough recommended stick drinks    Lastly issue bench seating against wall  Maybe bony ass but extremely uncomfortable hard  put cushions mitigate problem but doesn't work  Bruised behinds aside alright place convo your bff loved one  Otherwise would rather stick coffeehouse  <EOR> I LOVE matcha ice cream green milk tea! worth $5+ depending size get  giving place 3 stars because service wait time  employees almost always rude wait 10 15 minutes drinks  <EOR> Typically boba lover excited try new place some friends but whole experience just seemed average   The service pretty slow being such small space expecting bit more attention  only plus size fast everything came out    I mango green tea boba  tasted fresh but really anything special then any other place  also felt way much ice enough tea  boyfriend also shared tea dumplings  tasty but nothing special either   Overall very average place grab some snacks drinks  wouldn't recommend going your way visit  <EOR> Lovely little place come enjoy tea some food if you're down it  Service good overall good menu selection choose from  Living Green Valley would head down again    Get some custard your boba tea! <EOR> I'm people comes place late night right before right delicious meal Ichiza  might think getting tea middle night birds but not cools    I really tea here  usually always mixed fruit tea which mix different fruits steeped flavor your beverage  tea really good comes piping hot kinda forces spend some time there  place cool serve things other tea  boba shaved ice type things other things haven't gotten around trying yet  Plus prices right though dislike spend $20 more use plastic    The only reason place doesn't deserve five star rating? Some girls work kinda mean  just perpetual rush  Even days when gone kinda empty they're always kinda mad me  time friend asked girls something tasted I believe she asked taro tasted like waitress says can't describe it  describing apple tastes like  tell apple tastes like? Because can't funny retrospect but wasn't funny then    I'll continue come because place much think great casual date spot but just wish waitresses would nicer  <EOR> I don't know if order what? When walked little busy   EDC weekend lot people looked stopping some Boba     We easily able seat ourselves available table   look 2 servers floor   Let tell kept passing even served other tables sat down us   probably good 15 minutes before recognized no menus   until finally said Umm yes menus? ordered hot medium cup mango tea   really delicious   Overly priced sure   $4 cup tea   Good tasting tea but knock socks off let spend another $4 cup tea     eeeeh definitely better service tea  <EOR> I come all time favorite ice cold rose flavored green tea  tastes very sweet perfumey but love since unique  does relax more then give kick some other teas  many flavors delicious tea combinations choose boba well  food reasonably priced good lunch  open fairly late which nice if want stop buy something light tasty  Staff very friendly  Nice atmosphere  taro iced smoothies really good too  also blooming tea well  <EOR> love place!!!!! ive tried lot drinks never disappointed  bubble black tea kiwi jelly drink passion fruit drinks lot delicious drinks  strawberry french toast pretty good too  <EOR> During recent visit Las Vegas looking decent place milk tea Chinatown area  While tea menu quite extensive unimpressed rose milk tea ordered  didn't much flavor all pretty watered down  first time Tea Station always heard positive feedback location back home  service bit slow place wasn't even crowded  Maybe just need stick California New York if want decent milk tea future  <EOR> Pretty good tea including hot tea cold boba drinks  mix them very well good taste    However kinda pricey but guess pay partly environment awesome mixed drinks   Ok atmosphere place hella chill relaxed its pretty awesome  truly care long buy something  One time group 5 two people bought just regular drinks sat messed around good hour half word glance impatience people working there   It very chill environment good place just kick it    now best part open 2am everyday 365 days year  including any major holidays  such awesome trait restaurant have  top alter prices just because holiday guess keeps people coming    Ok enough also serve food well little snacks boba drinks but also serve actual food  greatest but late night dinner snack does job    OH if good let recommend chicken curry  delish <EOR> I awhile back cousins could sworn Tea Planet  But stll same still great  really enjoy honeydew snow ice w boba  taro snow ice w boba good too  never ate but heard good well  Great desert meal  <EOR> Drinks good tastes every other Tea Station to  But employees need some work  need work customer service staff usually friendly just very negative attitude look them   Also parking isn't great over there  <EOR> I don't know name but guy taking to go orders rude group I  walking boba tea guy your party? yes   sure? whole party yours? confirmed again  seemed issue even though told getting go    So told wanted he amount take wallet he's cash? sure cash  looked do? Why would he say he gives total even though he there's no sign anything? He said really rude too   Luckily boba delicious I'd burn place ground     I doubt coming back  People Volcano Tea nicer  <EOR> 3 5 4 stars if service isn't horrible food isn't overpriced    5 stars tea selection staff knowledge teas  fell absolutely love honey ginseng tea  If you're sick sore throat flu    highly recommend tea! down smoothly clears your sinuses  offer large selection iced hot teas pot cup bobas quality good flavors delicious  something everybody    Now food    good selection they've expanded food menu but prices pretty steep Asian food tea spot  dishes appetizers stand $1 2 lower  Although portions generous presentation lovely end off the strip Asian food prices shocking most locals  Needless say food range good great  all only places Vegas offers green tea noodles yum! rice dishes come complimentary side dishes Korean style   definitely enjoyed meals    hearty plentiful    Aaaaand service    AHH! horrible service! workers nice but experienced  No sense multi tasking forgot few things ordered    chase someone down refill waters  Whenever needed ANYTHING took way long anyone approach deliver  Hopefully re train servers overall experience customers improve  <EOR> I give 3 stars ONLY because love coconut milk tea boba  pricey but obviously worth keep going back quite often    At Tea Station flavor amount sugar overpowers tea taste which probably isn't good health wise haha which why find boba addicting  If you're looking boba more tea taste suggest Volcano Tea instead   One thing dislike service  always order drink to go waitresses never smile never greet always blank face on    When pay cash most time automatically assume rest tip which should NEVER do  Because assume owe them something paying almost $7 dollars 16 18 oz  drink TOP girls turning around speaking different language co workers most likely trash talking probably shouldn't leave tip  But anyways   Overall heard great things food LOVE boba whole atmosphere place nice    Parking sucks though  <EOR> For some strange reason always something against Tea Station  thing such long time since last don't really remember is  But something stuck mind years avoided place plague  bad service? Reading other people's reviews could it   Anyway finally returned evening hang friend  didn't order anything demanding just couple drinks  waitress took order quickly drinks came good time then left alone talked couple hours  When time leave easy enough flag waitress down check way   Other people mentioned service vastly improved  second that  certainly fast accurate then invisible when didn't need them  still choose other boba places during day when everything open but if need late night fix just chill late night hangout spot Tea Station solid choice  <EOR> I would absolutely come back Brown Sugar Boba Milk Tea alone  just right blend sweetness enough didn't overwhelm tea base  other 2 friends hot rose tea green tea boba respectively boy did look just yummy    Other independently owned cafes sambalatte holly's cuppa etc starting wrap 8 30pm left more commercial chains until realized galpal driving right back West side town decided just bring Tea Station    Considering first time actually sit down enjoy environment pretty fixated little frames hung walls miniature tea holders mention  'Free Wifi'! only criticism service  wish waitresses more knowledge menu since aren't any descriptions underneath item names  Also important take note place doesn't't start filling till 11pm Thursday night if you're into more mellow vibe I'd suggest come early  <EOR> I pretty often  When friends visiting other states want boba usually bring them here   I think pretty good food drinks when craving snack  pretty chill place good hang place young people older   I green milk tea matcha ice cream green milk tea brown sugar milk tea  All them good! food tried sweet garlic fries chicken butter toast condense milk  both great! highly recommended sweet garlic fried chicken sauce use delicious! I give place 3 stars maybe potentially 4 stars because customer service isn't great  don't seem very friendly  just straight forward want order  don't seem type ask everything give much attention customers  But alright because food good <EOR> Best taro slushee outside Taiwan  disappointed   powder!!!!! or if mixed hell lot better anywhere else ever US <EOR> This place great    how u possibly place    what else say     tons varieties tea beautiful alsome     D <EOR> Horrible service waited 20 minutes drinks   drinks asked leave because special day gave 20% discount drinks   Apparently discount means can't stay   But only two 4 drinks discounted shaved ice  wouldn't let friends eat saved ice all kicked out  <EOR> In Cali Boba places Asian Starbucks every corner  boba places Vegas nothing places back home Cali price quality service just drop your standards   Tea Station only really sacrifices service price  Its Asian establishment expecting much service begin with  waitress may forget your boba straws attentive seem don't want talk you   This probably most expensive boba place town some drinks starting $5 medium! appetizer easily $6 $7 cheap lunch dinner meal    However teas really set place apart  more apparent tea taste other boba places town ingredients just taste better   only ordered coconut jelly comes scoop ice cream top  Ordering everyone around table envious you  menu # C66  others around table order stuff lychee taro mango  All meeting approval taste department   Tea House probably best boba place town if we're only talking taste  Service price could much better but if isn't big concern place your boba fixing Vegas  <EOR> Hmm two words    HORRIBLE SERVICE ! why place where youre gonna treated shit  other hand boba good  BUT     ive much better ones  <EOR> This place great having quick lunch just hang out    Although big fan customer service long take bring your order drinks food enough keep coming    If you're fan fruit team like am Caribbean Fruit tea good start  sweet bitter   One favorite meals order tea flavored teriyaki eel  love comes soup three small dishes because always something healthy always feel full every time  <EOR> I used come lot during high school some time into college  fun atmosphere where friends could hang enjoy boba drinks snacks  time found myself spending less time boba tea shops suppose drinking less well  Now into boba tea again many shops popped don't visit Chinatown anymore it   My visit prompted convenience  few minutes opening shop empty  intention order counter but girl asked if sitting down said Yeah sure! signaled sit table  She brought table mat menu peruse  meeting friends lunch simply interested boba drink  figured some time kill why sit enjoy cup especially since serve your drinks glassware   large menu usual variety teas  When ready order another gentleman arrived table when asked boba he said Oh boba isn't ready  want other toppings? disbelief  Uhh   No    only wanted boba    ummm   When boba ready?  30 minutes  thought but realized if 30 minutes didn't really mean 30 minutes may enough time wait perused menu briefly settled tea without boba   My Large Iced Honey Milk Green Tea arrived plastic to go cup point dining in? silly straw  took sip immediately regretted every step brought here  gross  don't know if boba usually masks subpar tea if long since last visit but just couldn't drink it  ended leaving shortly receiving drink because lunch plans changed walked counter pay  thought misheard server when he told total SEVEN DOLLARS  large milk tea without boba toppings cost $7 02 including tax !

Shouldve named Rice Station something dont know? crazy packed customers waiting seated? Somebody please shed some light  Okay now all say MAD BRO? swear     not  LOL <EOR> DO support tea station  kicked store saying disrespectful didnt tell why   which not  charge extra boba  server didnt tell beginning it  Which Price wise thats fine said no worries but principle being honest your customers  servers name jonathan going tea station years yet never seen there  took 10 min take order wouldnt give recommendations drinks well also made ask questions across store  am embarrassed whole store heard  am respectful elders appreciate servers hard workers but unfortunatley server rate 0 10  <EOR> Another boba place disappointed in  ordered signature milk tea   tasted sugar milk tea sugar bobas  texture boba fine   But need cut back sugar! sweet overpowers everything  even waited ice melt could hopefully dilute drink bit   didn't help cuz still sweet   on next boba place!

Tea Station !!!!This place packed  Great food tea course  <EOR> I'm Vegas week Tea Station recommended friend swears best place around boba milk tea  Boy she wrong because ended walking store!   The reviews ass backward customer service absolutely correct  walk counter douche kabob employee walks over just stares pad  just ok hi take medium boba milk tea grass jelly please  then he says cash?? Uh  is does now feel am middle some drug deal? why does matter if cash?   Me errrrrr   I just credit card three bucks  Douche Kabob yeaaaaaa $10 minimum points sign dude going order ten dollars worth your stuff just use credit card  just want drink  Douche Kabob sorry can't anything then  well somewhere else then walks out Some advice Douche Kabobs Tea Station if going run business based drinks which run 4 dollars average   maybe should consider joining rest America allow paying customers use credit cards no minimum  Because look jackasses otherwise now instead glowingly positive review there's another negative your store internet public consumption  <EOR> While visit Las Vegas usually find way LV Chinatown few times   visit stopped Tea Station twice favorite drinks   TOGO counter busy time served quickly then waited 5 7 minutes drinks made   green tea boba less sugar   friend milk green tea less sugar   word Delicious!!  During quick search did see some other options drinks Chinatown but seem always come back old standard Tea Station   only gripe drinks getting pricey around $8 $9 two drinks    Xie Xie!! <EOR> Terrible Awkward setup  Drinks taste old stale  Prices high compared other spots   Redeeming factor glassware if your drink yeah fancy   I wouldn't back  <EOR> Our out of town guest dire need some boba before she returned back Wisconsin   Seeing Tea Planet all time many jaunts Ichiza first time in   place always popping late evenings no exception weekday night   We grabbed table window perused menu   took all awhile order since didn't know where start   getting orders able deck cards part crowd   BF shared large Mango Snow Ice $6 25 no tapioca   Good stuff mostly because tasted mango puree   other friends order Chrysanthemum tea which came two tea cups medium Lychee Snow Ice tapioca $4 75 Iced Black Tea   When ordering black tea waiter asked if he wanted hot cold he opted cold   He didn't expect sweetened though   ended being okay end but took surprise when he tasted sweetness   To grub ordered Fried Spicy Chicken $4 50 which deep fried basil   BF grub various boba places offer it   also tried Fried Tofu $4 50 which pretty basic comes hot sauce   But decent when want fried junk   tried ordering Taiwanese Pork Pacman $6 50 but waiter strongly discouraged ordering it   ended Fried Squid Balls $4 50 which exactly squid balls! Not those kind balls duh! Food pretty pricey when look over but you're really beverages   also serve random things Chicken Alfredo Pasta $7 50 Squid Jerky $4 50     The cool thing place chill hang out   grab deck cards just good time  Apparently having much fun though 'cuz told quiet down  You'll find people all ethnic backgrounds well which always think cool thing   Service just okay   never cleared table put plates shelf next us   good couple hours ordered throughout stay  probably why allowed loud selves stick around     Overall places allow hang play cards   Serving some cool beverages good snack foods share always decent place kick it!  Sidenote $3 minimum per person  I added pics drinking snacking business profile! <EOR> The only downside place servers slow  Tonight just picked own table took them 15 minutes just say hi     Other place great! Love close late! <EOR> I'm quite keen service  service horrible  Maybe could say bad timing but regardless time still horrible service  Walking find own seat? guess since happened servers running fro perhaps avoiding newly arrived customers  Whatever case ahead pulled myself chair    Waited quite bit finally order server but think time already fed bad service  Fast forwarding bad service drinks all right  Tasted better    Still hunt finding nice place decent service serves delicious tea  If anyone else let know  <EOR> I ordered simple tea egg minced pork rice took 45 mins foo show up  follow server busy chatting away other servers he seemed surprised such item menu!   The order comes individual bowls plates each item  some reason   felt ran ingredients shorted serving size  minced pork barely filled half bowl   No checked during meal 8 oz cup water sat empty over half time   It sucks few Taiwanese places available Vegas  would recommend tea station anyone looking hassle free meal!! <EOR> Prices little high when non traditional stuff but milk tea its variants good here  Service pretty fast but no credit card under $10 policy stinks  <EOR> Good spot quick service workday lunch  food hit miss but boba tends consistent except shifts days when run out   hot boba presentation favorites restaurant warm comfortable feeling but only when busy Friday nights pretty hectic there  <EOR> My favorite drink Green Tea Boba ice cream!   IMPORTANT order to go area  If take forever someone take your order receive your order!!!!! <EOR> Ordered fried chicken steak 2 pieces metal strings it!    never back again! ! <EOR> HoneyMilk Green tea Boboa Lychee jellies  NEED REALLY SAY MORE?

Perhaps because located very busy complex thanks Ichiza upstairs Kaya Zizzy bar next door place just always full people  However if really look closely everyone orders drinks   just place hang crowd around   pretty much loiter making busy all time    But reality Tea Planet expensive overpriced service HORRIBLE  Majority drinks start off $5+ tax medium even though nothing fresh but powdered   large drinks $6+ tax   Finger foods such spicy chicken $5 + tax small plate meal $8 99 up   Some noodle bowls $12 00 +tax   Everything overpriced portions skimpy  Don't fooled tea flavored prefixes menus   There's no tea flavor any it  top occasionally raise prices portions seems smaller smaller over time    The other day met friends order usual Royal Milk Tea pot  pot supposed size medium $5 + tax urn large size    when ordered using size names wrote menu waitress no idea eff talking about  She kept asking size wanted kept repeating pot  only pot urn menus supposed know size  She should know because she works but sure enough she didn't  Everyone talk something bad say girls serve there  only slow but attitude bitchy especially when mess your drinks tell them remake it  Overall price pay service just horrible  since bring drinks customary tip them too  worth all bad service  <EOR> Decided wanted boba eating pho closest place down street   ordered drinks to go but sit down if wanna order some food  ordered Green Milk Tea w boba hubby ordered Milk Tea boba  Both good but kinda pricey drink $6 large  Service kinda slow took awhile drinks  <EOR> Very sad day  Just found don't any Thai Tea  lost few stars me  <EOR> Boba  West coast boba   We craving boba dim sum off down street tea station  hibiscus something black tea man boba good! simple midwestern girl me   happy good tasting boba  would thought  boba right amount chewyness  mean don't wrong tea station isn't your Joy Yees but still definitely good  <EOR> I still need boba fix even when am vacationing Vegas   I usually always when Vegas  Pretty much same any other Tea Station to    Their boba good  Its soft chewy  Prices opinion bit high boba  Service all other Tea Stations very friendly but better boba places vegas to    My usual drinks are Milk tea Jasmin Green Milk tea Thai Tea Coffee Milk tea <EOR> It's hip place hang late   hot grass jelly alright   soup sweet bland but bean sweet compensate   finished bean left half soup   taro soup better   Hubby mango jelly ice both love it   matcha green milk tea ice cream popular it  I would come back try different thing <EOR> Minus 2 stars horrible horrible service today maybe worst ever experienced     What hell did deserve this?!!

They stamp card free drink 15 drinks think   They also snacks bento box offer pretty chill place hangout friends casual first date    If slightly sweet floral coffee try rose coffee interesting! <EOR> Good drinks   Service kinda iffy   but whatever   A bit pricey side but Vegas   Drinks tad sweet  <EOR> This first boba experience did disappoint  really love place  drive 15 mins   I don't care! tea always fresh staff always pleasant  continue come long live Las Vegas! <EOR> Tea Planet OMG! only real Tea place Las Vegas!!!! frequent often  Even food pretty good here  pork knuckle here  bf likes tea flavored chicken place known pork chop  also taiwan ice here  tea good use TEN RENS  all dishes come minced pork may want ask if  used to  If don't see menu ask them  you! <EOR> There's another tea station Northern California where am very busy popular  decided give location try since something familiar  WORST DECISION  took ten minutes order because apparently cashier doesn't know enough English  When came turn order cashier kept asking unnecessary questions confusing order well  Seriously? should straight forward when am reading menu telling exactly want milk tea pearls regular size  complicated that?     we coming back  seems everyone inside time only take advantage free wifi      <EOR> Damn greeting little better before    I haven't awhile due nasty attitude giving if don't want business    Can't deny fact Tapioca best Vegas but service better    When business does well comfortable don't keep start slack off some levels    I stopped going year bc terrible service  Only came bc friends wanted dropped in    Turned little better ? Maybe finally caught Yelp ? knows just maintain good service your sales increase  <EOR> I really want say screw place!!!  Service horrible   They're rude slow friendly all!!  usually take drink even such quick transaction they're just uninviting   I tried sit down dessert once took while acknowledged   flag waitress down   Forget asking suggestions communicating child   ordered mango shaved ice but can't tell tasted because waiting 20 minutes never arrived   Apparently excess servers standing around kept ours occupied bother punching order   mentioned she looked surprised saw tell person behind counter he proceeded it  F that    walked out   I come because occasional boba craving eat off spring mountain lot   finding other joints serve boba along shit service don't come anymore   place overpriced consistent boba really OVERPRICED!  Btw   sure always taste your drink before leave place   ordered large milk tea taro to go BF once didn't taste cause him   Well home gave tasted purple water   paid almost six dollars pissed   really wanted back but just waste energy   Here few places found serves boba cheaper yummier nicer cashiers 1  Boba City Cafe 2  Cefiore 3  Waffles Cafe 4  Easy Life Boba Tea And believe Q cup opening off jones where China Mama located  <EOR> In all honesty place isn't amazing      It over priced over iced  But can't stop coming back!   This good place catch friends plan where next  Thai iced tea boba iced lychee green tea boba staples  yummy but nothing incredible    I recommend getting your tea to go because then wont sit around waiting someone take your orders bill   nor tip ]  Now if you're ordering food  another story another review not     Perhaps am drawn place because sitting outside nice night people watching sipping tea planning night feels pretty good    guess worth few extra bucks  <EOR> I just quick drink class  original boba milk tea  okay boba little bit soft tho but service BAD  Made really set  <EOR> While place worthy four stars unfortunately agree many others say service isn't great should thus reason why give three well technically wish 3 5 option! aside menus full options where variety teas milks bobas even plates appetizers meals choose from  coming since high school perfect environment locals come sit down group play some cards light snack tea afternoon evening  place usually mobbed later hours day but otherwise always find place when catching old friends discussing business matters  <EOR> 3 5 stars Tea Station!  I first came Tea Station Vegas outing boys   them crush worker all forced join ride   Seeing there's minimum card purchases all advised bring cash   bad little tip!  While find prices bit high bubble tea mike delicious Rose Milk Green Tea Royal Milk Tea   There's no way around it   perfect amount sweetness flavoring   haven't tried much food any other drinks but still pretty delicious cup tea   They pretty extensive menu compared any boba tea houses sell lot tea   Parking challenging but hey Chinatown   always super busy staff bit snooty times   Oh well   just give liver break drink some milk tea  <EOR> Loved place  honey lemon boba teas excellent  Fun feel back  <EOR> The food really hit miss but boba pretty good  gotten green tea ice cream boba great! There's also some sort taro dish  served hot dessert soup   really yummy  food options toast always safe bet  soups they've stated contain tea flavors aware certain dishes might expect  Other boba always delicious served large quantities great place hang friends  <EOR> My gal pal decided stop dinner boba drink  previous bit nervous should order  praying did order boba drink may would disappointing   Luckily finally decided rose milk boba reviewing menu which lot beverage options   My drink perfect amount sweet truly enjoyed which really perfect dessert just having ramen dinner   The prices sure high small rose milk boba 5 75 which more expensive favorite large drink Starbucks ouch!!!  I back hit Lottery Vegas Jackpot way order large drink enjoy! <EOR> This place sucks!!! came around hour before closed guess upset waitress  She super bad attitude  date she embarrassed me  date asked eating utensils she took them next table threw them table  beef soup good but boba tea grainy disgusting  worst service boba ever life first time ever left tip life  Terrible! <EOR> Drink snack wise I'd give place 4 stars but service bumps down 3  I came first time friend 6pm Thursday weren't many other customers  Unlike other boba places place sit in sit table they'll come take your order give your receipt etc   As fan matcha matcha ice cream milk green tea C1 just absolutely wonderful  could barely stop drinking finished really fast  pearls but hard please regarding tapioca balls I'd pass next time   My friend ordered butter toast  She said condensed milk supposed come side but charged $ 75   totally worth though  we ended dipping last pieces into condensed milk cup!  Would definitely come back next time town! <EOR> Lame ass expensive place  Flavors sweet nd artificial  Place crowded nd small nd loud inside <EOR> For 200th review only fitting write favorite subjects   BOBA!!!!!   Tea Station may favorite place Vegas boba  Sorry Easy Life  only ton teas options delicious icey mountains sweet amazingness good service full food menu YAY! fried chicken pretty yums    I came bestie dinner boba both ordered fried chicken meal   came yummy broth just momma's dong gua soup! some taiwanese veggies rice bowl friend chicken  Definitely hit spot  course also ordered green tea BOBA always tea Tea Station phenomenal  boba also cooked just perfect right amount bounce chewiness The biggest PLUS and why place gets 5 stars let friend sit talk hours without rushing out  Even when place started getting more crowded evening on  prob could sat talked 5 hrs without being interrupted! Awesome    <EOR> I hate bearer bad news but    haven't place forever because service  sucks because used favorite spot   I'm really into teas review would towards service see    Yes may good drinks but boba little bit more pricey side  feel people because cool thing do  perk they're open late but extremely busy times  even when busy service still sucks  People come just sit hours talk play games sometimes takes while if wanna sit in   The last experience horrible one  came large party 10 people  waited table when finally 30 minutes later dude served just told sit down put menus table walked away  last saw him  took 45 minutes realize weren't going take order    left  Mind during whole time would look take order he kept saying hold hand gestures would continue talking another worker behind counter  Throughout time he would also serve other people people sat still yet take order  all said forget left  he stared walked out  Right he walked table grabbed menus  Sucks cause all super hungry wanted try some food boba! if he didn't even care business    If could would given 2 stars  But added more because strawberry slush good used know  Now just pass place whenever China town  bunch other boba places just good better prices much better service care customers   My friends haven't since  <EOR> Love place  staff very friendly  always welcomed when come friends family  wait kinda annoying specially when waiting table but then again popular boba spot spring mountain  <EOR> Decent food just ok service  Only redeeming quality they're open late  Place study friendly seems pretty relaxed night <EOR> I liked Tea Station near where used live Fremont CA   glad find another Las Vegas   menu pretty much same remembered California   The drinks good but again made powders most other boba tea places bobas cooked well   pretty relaxed chill place hang some snacks play some cards surf web while kill some time   Service usually good but sometimes rather poor if end rude server most likely mainland China transplant   What place the snacks tried mostly good Sweet butter toast tea boiled eggs Tea flavored fried spicy chicken can also prepared non spicy    Dislikes 2 waitresses rather rude  Cost less order drinks but orders count towards Buy 10 1 Free promo card   And prepared pay cash charge small fee paying credit cards  <EOR> We stopped into place while waiting table nearby resturant  ordered Royal King Milk Tea earl gray red bean shaved ice  good! red bean ice cream before but fantastic  variety textures temperatures awesome  Great place hang out  Staff attentive but annoying  If lived side town would frequent place  <EOR> Although boba good customer service prices want reconsider going place   servers really need work customer service means giving attitude when ask them questions  would try going other boba places kung fu tea brew tea bar        bomb boba better price better service <EOR> 6 years ago did American FOB thang flew Las Vegas see Taiwanese Hong Kong R B sensation version J Lo shitty Mandalay Bay Events Center at ticket prices would U2 Cure Radiohead blush suppose call C Lee stage name Coco Lee real name ahem    Ferren Lee gotta love Hong Kongers try creative English names     http en wikipedia org wiki Coco_Lee the pic link old btw probably find some more recent material youtube if want idea    Coco 100% Chinese speaks fluent English having spent much time since age 10 attended UC Irvine some point yet somehow through vocal training belt in prime which sadly past voice almost sounds Mo Town somehow managed develop some serious badonkadonk looked came straight outta Puerto Rico    So sat down whole show Coco work crowd most whom older A$Ns younger AZNs came more conservative families didn't seem clue behave pop concerts needed cues pop $en$ation herself she needed more encouragement audience via louder screams some AZN announcer trying work crowd again end first set encore when reverse true western rock concerts audience automatically buck wild encores without cues   some point bit worn jaded pseudo imported A$N pop concert experience lame turned where half songs no live band backing song lip sync'd studio album playing background sorry Coco ain't Janet Jackson prime sang danced immediately thought where could unwind madness or lack thereof    So Tea Planet came into play  knew place TP not toilet paper actually Tsing Shong Xiao Dzan aka Tea Station Cafe  also owned same group family operates chain them across Southern California and two locations Nor Cal Fremont Newark them mainly stationed location San Gabriel Square Valley  SGV    We no set wheels own cabbed within less 10 minutes    Don't remember much place except menu mirrors Tea Stations Southern California but quite same quality vibe  iced mixed fruit tea overly sweetened was favorite drink Southern Cal TS   suppose location better Nor Cal Newark decent passable sure way better Quickbux some other tapioca tea joint  Then again bit biased fan Ten Ren straight outta Taiwan   In words friend TAIWAN ROCs!
