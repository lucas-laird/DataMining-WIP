What really blew away customer service waitress awesome i think name Kelly long haired brunette guys serving meats super friendly  Even unexpected incident during lunch Pampas could prevent very kindly offered another lunch next day house!! truly says lot manager staff    Now 7 31 13 different server think name Miranda something that  idk if she new but She never checked anything always different girl getting new plates drinks  felt little weird but again great experience definitely recommend it!!   Thank Pampas! Definitely spot next Vegas trip <EOR> If could give Pampa's negative stars would however system doesn't allow give less 1 star!!  This worst experience word go! We time share coupons waiter completely inattentive just didn't care deal us  push double cocktail door which came immediately took good 10 15 minutes rest party drinks   started timing horrible    Meat started coming before ready signaled such   The shrimp deveined major Poop vein mussels very overcooked rubbery essentially inedible   And then dessert ordered coffee espresso first then tiramisu  tiramisu soggy lackluster best  worst part completely finished tiramisu before coffee ever arrived   When received bill some questions waiter bit snotty having answer them   Then came final straw card used pay bill tip cash when received charge slip back signature mandatory gratuity added charge slip he kept cash   We took manger looked bewildered lost explained situation   In end cash tip back left unhappy very dissatisfied   Don't restaurant spend your hard earned money elsewhere  Vegas many options chose from  <EOR> I pretty disappointed place   There only type beef coming around  am used several types local churrascaria  Peppered Garlic cut cut    Sausages just ok  Turkey wrapped Bacon probably best thing offered me   The sides salad bar pretty small great variety  Which really doesn't matter much because just some rice powder stuff dipping meat in   Servers all robots all hungover    no life them  And sure took sweet time coming back    Don't know keep food that? Maybe why knives duller party Joe Biden's  They didn't want shankin them whole skewer meat   Caipirinha OK but try White Wine Sangria here    excellent    Oh almost forgot  coupon $3 off per person mysteriously vanished table  <EOR> Where should start?   This set up  theory sounds amazing! Buffet 12 different grilled meats carved your table relaxed filling eating experience  Throughout entire strip promoters passing buy coupons which sweetens experience even more  problem tiny buffet limited sides only saw 5 6 meats no where close 12 constant fight few meat selections your table which caused frustration   not relaxation  Additionally BOGO coupon BOGUS! did half off but couldn't buy basic buffet upgrade add grilled shrimp beverage which your total $4 50 cheaper price regular buffet  Doesn't sound Payless BOGO sale me  Other gimmicks few grilled meats actually tastey  ham steak really good! If did prefer rare meat request separately which caused more waiting frustration  wasn't single side amazing  Just different cold salads  think buffet deserves $25 needs some additional sides     Final advice pay extra dollars eat buffet nicer hotels  Thank later <EOR> This pretty shocking having Pampas Palo Alto CA   everything Pampas know not   tables cramped together meats overcooked dry tasty ambience    just no   We'd opted surf n turf rodizio something regular Pampas does offer seafood offerings pretty shocking too   Measly broken off pieces fish drowned sauce dry sad looking mussels scattering headless translucent shrimp   Never again  <EOR> Checked into HGVC Elara offered 2 1 dinner Pampas Grille  Must order drink coupon water table  Advertise 12 kind meat but only 7 kinds came table  meats poor quality sirloin garlic steak chicken sausage pork grilled fillet mignon grilled pineapple  Even 2 1 coupon bill came almost $100 because drink must order  Then bill suggested tip bast regular priced dinner final total over $120 two  think next time want eat good quality meat would Bucchanal Buffet  <EOR> Nice decor services  salad bar variety great! many options salads breads      Culture Cuisine Zhenbei Group 8 <EOR> I am write bad reviews but worst vegas experience  sat reservation time waiter walked left sitting 15 minutes no water watched walk few empty tables section  Finally bus boy stopped brought water 10 minutes later lazy rude waiter came over ask drinks  When ordered he brought pitcher ordered drinks no glasses then took 10 minutes bring glasses didn't pour drinks us  food pretty good guys walking around skewers great fast  Finally waiter came back check when pitcher gone forgot drink order  Finally asked bill voucher place staying he brought receipt $45 wasn't covered tip optional gave card back he gave charge $59 charged card  couldn't find 10 minutes asked manager  When she came over she asked bill he said he added 15% gratuity when questioned manager did nothing  didn't big stink just signed left    That should illegal them tell thing charge another! totally felt waiter scamming 2nd tip    he threw away $45 receipt brought new one    I can't believe that! Super wrong! Bottom line decent food but worth price other Vegas choices illegal practices    Don't go! Expect some worst service anywhere! <EOR> It's good overall  sure well done meat  haven't any seafood wish more seafood instead meat  <EOR> Delicious food  voucher Hilton grand vacations upgraded meat rodizo $10 pp where bring around variety off Brazilian bbq meats try  Sirloin definitely favorite  Cheryl server amazing  both happily full end <EOR> This probably favorite steak restaurant Las Vegas even though pretty pricey but worth  food yummy many servers holding meat stick going around pick whatever want  love grill bacon grill lamb  No free refill strawberry lemonade  Everything well far until lady coming asking take pictures which complimentary  Later meal come check if those pictures then decide pick up  However staffs working photo station just completely ruined day she gave cold glance when decided take it  $50 3 pictures wow  She started bargain but still said no  Overall give restaurant 4 stars food very good nice waiters but manager should take look those people working pictures inside restaurant  come back food! <EOR> Yummers! discounted vouchers Tickets 4 Less counters strip  Paid $3 discounted price $24 95 instead regular price $41  guy ticket counter said sell most vouchers Pampas all shows combined  Good deal  dinner all eat 10 meats  say favorite roasted herb chicken  Some meat bit dry tough chew through but pretty satisfied different flavors  some other brazilian bbq places where meats just all start tasting same  Another favorite bacon wrapped turkey  turkey really moist but think  because processed  came cubes those long sticks  If remember correctly two types filet mignon  remember liking wasn't parmesan   The service excellent  brought own wine  When called said corkage fee $15 but turned $10  waiter also manager kept checking taking away plates  Additionally separate buffet lots salad choices  liked pineapple salad kale fried bananas  Yummers again! <EOR> 6 Dinner Christmas Eve Nicole best  food beyond fantastic more then reasonably priced  Thank very much Nicole Chef Josh  <EOR> I just happened Vegas new year since saw place past decided try it  Salad bar ok meats bit salty really raw bloody but surely disappointed service  Waitress show only 3 times when first sat table when she brought drinks when she gave check! literally ask servers bring meats table since seem just pas guess just want eat salad bar In other words price service quality ratio good all <EOR> The salad bar great large selection   meats tasty would hoped steakhouse   meat little flavor would benefit little seasoning   service fast very friendly   again hopes meat bit more tasty   Also sure discounted meal vouchers ticket shops strip pay half price your meal  huge savings when consider normal prices $50 meal! <EOR> This first yelp review but disgusted food write it  Apparently half positive reviews restaurant came same IP address yelp told when came write review  should say something! food disgusting ask manager even complain  Rice undercooked pasta room temperature meat low quality  Manager did take food off just paid 2 sodas  Please careful spending your money here! place fit restaurant  <EOR> Bought coupon restaurant TixForTonight seemed good place try out  Suffice say very pleased service variety general deliciousness greeted us     My first impression Pampas style over substance regard very much mistaken  Yes fancy restaurant matching feel however also warm welcoming infused overall pleasant feel  waiter Dave consummate professional  drinks never empty strong crisp  Despite fact only hour open bar met no delays given precisely much could drink time  service beyond reproach  What's more servers managers also very ball asking consistently enjoying meal if everything satisfaction  service really five star quality   As food superb! salad bar fully stocked more pasta vegetables sides could ask for  could very easily happily indulge only sides still very satisfying delicious meal without fault  However would miss main event truly sensational high quality meats brought served your table  particularly favourite perfectly cooked Sirloin yummy spicy chicken  But all meats divine well worth extra money if only variety unlimited quantity receive  only fear place somewhat wasted due small appetite  But if you're big eaten then promise place dissapoint    Fair warning though Pampas as might expect considering unlimited nature remarkable quantity does come hefty price tag  cost $130 two and including discount   Expect pay big   Overall truly sumptuous night definitely repeat next time Vegas  Well worth money   And remember come empty stomach  <EOR> A hidden gem Miracle Mile   Tucked away back alley restaurant some best food Las Vegas   recommendation anyone thinking dining come appetite all eat option daunting all varieties meat side dishes offer    staff very friendly professional  very knowledgeable items menu  <EOR> I very hesitant reading many reviews  Groupon great experiences poorly rated restaurants past it  husband celebrating anniversary along first time away kids overnight wanted good food   Server Constantin server  He incredible  He welcoming friendly comedic appropriately down earth  Where some people give lower level service when Groupon he did NOT  He even reminded Groupon includes dessert save room!

Thank Andres  <EOR> We free dinner voucher but didn't include rodizio    damn   pretty much only reason I'd want hit Brazilian steakhouse  did include sirloin mashed potatoes salad bar plowed onward but most underwhelming experience entire time Vegas  left glad didn't pay $43 + tax tip bad food slow service   Our food took hour come out  Half hour into order notified computer down order hadn't sent back kitchen  Ten minutes later kitchen working plating yet took another 20 minutes  hell doing back there? meat presumably already cooked since servers walking around restaurant plating nothing special just sliced meat plate why did take 30 more minutes top computer failure? Barely made show   The salad bar odd  Caesar salar makings but no Caesar dressing  sweet sour chicken at Brazilian place? some pastas but few enticing veggies  piled potatoes carbed up  grabbed some cheese bread pao de quiejo usually heavenly but very over cooked downright crunchy hard  sirloin good but wait an hour good     Two gentlemen next bar rodizio but served onto tiny plates kept having flag down servers by    Crowded interior greasy floor expensive terrible service   best Brazilian steakhouse experience head Fogo  <EOR> T's cousin wedding dinner private room   could resist trying just little everything?  Nothing exotic alligator    Just standard all pretty damn yum   But don't care distracted meat skewers are   Promise whatever don't miss cheezy biscuits!  Seriously must dozen   no idea whether cheezy biscuits Brazilian don't care   Cheezy cheezy cheezy heaven   3 1 2 cheezy stars   And bonus points never empty glass Cabernet! <EOR> This great experience while Las Vegas  server Jimmy awesome  food very food bit selection seafood slim  would recommend saving 10 dollars person seafood  Jimmy really saved experience because hostesses very friendly  <EOR> Eh terrible but best Brazilian place to  Luckily bogo voucher would really expensive just so so food  Most meats well done everyone group prefers rare medium  Shrimp way over cooked sitting steam table long quite rubbery  Even little green thing upright guys didn't come often enough group carnivores  <EOR> I've dying try Brazilian steakhouse awhile when noticed Groupon Pampas valid when going Vegas jumped it  purchased lunch deal which included two all you can eat meals meat seafood salad bar plus alcoholic drink per person dessert share  ended being great deal!  We checked salad bar first slightly disappointed it  expecting more green salad bar less pre made pasta salads  Caesar salad soggy which seemed odd considering restaurant just opened less 30 minutes before  standouts salad bar garlic mashed potatoes chicken noodle soup which found helped give stomach relaxing break all delicious meats    And speaking meats those steaks amazing! Both tri tip top sirloin melt in your mouth delicious! others mentioned they're rather salty but salty tooth heaven! loved having meat carved right table being able much could fit tiny stomach    Unfortunately other meat mainly pig based don't eat pig skipped ham pork loin  even bacon wrapped chicken  tried chicken leg but didn't care it  Besides steaks good bother anything else    Thanks Yelp read amazing Pampas' grilled pineapple knew request some  think usually bring your table but 30 minutes yet see any  asked waitress she notified kitchen bring out  sweet delicious balanced rest meal perfectly    Our meal ended choice four desserts  probably odd but none four choices cheesecake chocolate cake flan tiramisu appealed me  more pie ice cream kind girl  would chosen chocolate cake even though huge chocolate fan but boyfriend wanted try flan let it  stuffed meaty meal much room dessert anyway    All all I'd definitely come back another Groupon next time Vegas  <EOR> Went Pampas three times finally decided write review  first time special date night wife second wedding reception third family reunion  food average when compared other Brazilian steakhouses Vegas  great deal restaurant com  meats average but pineapple amazing  salad bar mediocre  price coupons still great deal wonderful time friends family  step above Yolies but couple steps below Texas De Brazil even further Fogo De Chao  <EOR> Horrible service  Craig server yelling writing review   Will never come back  <EOR> So last time came experience wasn't great but decided give another try thanks Bill  give special thanks replying back message wanting things right  shows much he cares customer service          Let start off saying amazing Amber waitress!

My least favorite thing probably salad bar  pretty much choose pre made salads since didn't individual salad toppings anywhere just plain lettuce things cole slaw potato salad green bean salad etc  However bunch cheeses choose well some breads chips soups other miscellaneous items  Lots options!  Get white sangria! tried mimosas but white sangria better opinion    The service BEST  Everyone nice enthusiastic    Some meats great some just okay  give wooden cylinder red end green other  Green side = more meat red side = no more now  gorging meat little over hour while favorite sirloin! tender medium rare juicy  Some pork pretty dry didn't much that   They also bacon wrapped chicken sausages tri tip grilled pineapple etc   The seafood dish bring mussels well some shrimp salmon ask another if finish plate since won't bringing around meat    We flan dessert delicious! uploading picture later    Overall would again Groupon  <EOR> We've all other Brazilian restaurants Las Vegas  best!

Posted pictures reference  <EOR> My first experience Brazilian all eat place pleasant  atmosphere fun if sit outside near bar because hear half hour rain storm Miracle Mile shops  Speaking where sit inner area near buffet more crowded lit more brightly  preferred spot near bar more intimate  Some Brazilian music would nice addition little quiet    The food very tasty abundant  11 year old he still qualified child's price which nice because he's big eater all eat rodizios expensive  He fill cheese rolls which big hit!  buffet yummy salads side dishes  Rodizio ordered came app  dessert  chose mussels coconut cream sauce which very good  tiramisu lovely well    The service good even less crowded spot restaurant  meat coming around skewers doesn't stop! bacon covered scallops great beef dishes good too  Only lamb pretty over cooked flavorless  grilled pineapple great touch!   We return more Brazilian meat fest! <EOR> having 2 other brazilian bbqs near DC wasn't sure expect   i must say slightly dissapointed   meat selection wasnt impressive   while good selection other meats lamb chicken turkey pork dissapointed beef selection   no ribeye no short loins filet mignon wasnt good either   the salad bar also pretty standard    not whole lot just few basics   salad bar texas de brazil would blow away   probably highlight grilled pineapple   thats good thing when your specialty meat  <EOR> Not sure why all bad reviews    Came group 6 food service awesome     <EOR> Since can't give less star do  I ordered shrimp technically all eat dinner salad buffet bar $50  In hour sat bar order shrimp ordered 2 more  last two never came  The tasted great but bit over cooked  bartender good but kitchen let down   On positive note talked manager he brought box shrimp bartender bought beer  <EOR> Awesome good great service many times found best waiters time asked renan although dodger fan raiders fan but forgive thanks renan <EOR> Delicious filling dinner  Easy walk Elara   Friendly courteous service   Lots kinds cuts meat  Nice salad bar pitcher caipirina good night! <EOR> The food delicious  server friendly very helpful  manager came over twice very polite  hubby definitely coming back! <EOR> Before begin review sure check coupons groupons before coming here     1  Food variety 1 star Only Included meat rodizio try tip top sirloin rest options chicken thighs pork sausage  salad appetizer bar also very limited options   2  Food quality 3 star Top sirloin definitely best offer sure your try that  3  Service 0 star Extremely slow compared other Brazilian steakhouses  4  Atmosphere 3 star  5  Drinks 2 star I recommend getting all drink deals if downing your drinks your money's worth since drinks relatively weak <EOR> We visited Pampas Thursday during lunchtime   three stars shows dissatisfied several things just shouldn't happen restaurants    First off strange way seafood brought tables when gets groupon 'surf turf lunch unlimited alcoholic drinks dessert option'  server brought plate mussels shrimp cocktail sauce fried baked fish  interested neither fried baked fish nor mussels  unfortunately left plate thrown wasted food  Why dont waiters just ask customers would prefer? Rather assuming bringing seafood trash within 30 minutes  Why bring small plate shrimp asking wanted keep replenishing them needed?   Secondly wait staff appeared very busy during lunch strangely enough random waitress came over tell wrong table being sat hostess which very confusing  ended staying table but felt something tell customer talk staff potentially made error look correct situation  comment she came back once again say same thing until waiter conversation around actually being correct table     Third selection food buffet area pretty good meats all tasty  But didn't feel waiter came enough times ask doing if wanted refills alcoholic drinks   Overall if ever back Vegas probably won't back Pampas  <EOR> BAIT SWITCH     AVOID ALL COST!  Heed bad reviews  Wow  Just wow  Taken cleaners then some  ordered two meat special going evening New Years Eve   Before ordering presented $50 Groupon coupon  explained could use coupon along 2 1 deal  ordered  dinner bill comes only charged 2 1 deal but bill included host other charges a second 2 1 charge amongst other things brought total nearly $150  worst part $50 coupon we'd given them they'd only applied $37 50 it   fifteen minutes arguing legitimacy bill logic somehow $37 50 equals $50 just paid bill left frustration  kept receipt just case want take complaint further chain    report them Nevada Attorney General  <EOR> We love place  many times  meats tasty juicy  vegetables fresh  drinks good  desserts die for!

 I've couple different Brazilian churrascaria's before probably worst had   expect more Vegas   Perhaps having late lunch between lunch dinner meats but assumption still doesn't poor tasting food horrible service price   Atmosphere The restaurant itself looks great nice ambiance   bar several drink selections choose well wait   restaurant hidden between couple others within Miracle Mile shops located Planet Hollywood stay hidden   Food We party 4   3 meat plates mix plate both meat seafood   mood some good surf turf!

LOCATION Pampas restaurant off beaten path  mean off beaten path located Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile but you'd actively search because won't actually stumble upon it  actually hidden behind two table service restaurants whose names can't remember but if know where Panda Express then you're near it!  RESERVATIONS SEATING You easily reservation via phone Open Table always recommend Open Table because just another way rack rewards points eating great restaurants  made reservations last minute like made reservation 2 9 30 hour before time requested despite being late still accommodated  Granted wasn't very busy night but always appreciate when restaurant accommodate us    We wanted more secluded dining area instead sitting indoors main room bar area seated outside corner two top    DINING EXPERIENCE Absolutely phenomenal  server Hallie truly top game continuously sent refills alcoholic beverages every time she noticed running low empty    The meal itself great  surf turf meal includes churrascaria experience where runners walk your tables offer different cuts meat but also includes family style platter seafood which includes mussels orange glazed tilapia shrimp salmon  If you're budget I'd say skip surf turf but since bought Groupon deal just wonderful perk meal    The meats cooked medium rare if sensitive stomach always ask meat cooked medium well well done they'll cut slice cook inside kitchen  Keep mind won't come immediately!  One thing also liked if particular type meat you're looking top sirloin filet mignon wrapped bacon always ask your server he she order you! Unlike many churrascarias definitely great option use iPads place your orders    DRINKS First water free! honestly did appreciate having pay $2 bottle water server didn't actually tell because assumed already included meal  Anyways just heads up    Caipirinhas many different flavors!! sweetest strawberry course best you'll lime  very strong alcohol content third drink could definitely feel it    plan ahead take cab uber here!  Sangrias WHITE SANGRIA ALL WAY  honestly could even taste wine all  just tasted fruit juice which always mark truly great sangria    DESSERT You choose between four different types chocolate mousse tiramisu cake flan other dessert honestly can't remember   We chose tiramisu perfect finish very filling dinner! cake light airy perfect hint coffee   Overall would love return Pampas based wonderful experience boyfriend had  only gripe meat very dry don't exactly sauces them either  churrascaria find bit problematic meats your specialty cooked well done either  hope future find way meats juicier when return confidently give them 5 star rating deserve  26 100 <EOR> Excellent service!

No don't think unless someone else coupon paying <EOR> Worst restaurant ever food mediocre but worse service simply cannot found anywhere else   party 11 reservations Pampas    even took them more 45 minutes table   Most waiters look forward large parties lots potential tips however ours avoided us   The menu some good offerings it   However because taken long seat waiter being attentive most ordered salad bar because running short time   Irritated majority party ordering most expensive thing menu keep mind group well dressed well to do people waiter began collecting rodizio plates table loud he possibly could if being passive aggressive would put more time clock us   then pointed he'd failed take meal orders three people party which irritated further   He mistakenly collected rodizio plate party ordered meat rodizio the all eat meat when diner informed he shouldn't taken plate away argued diner 5 minutes before checking he himself written down meal order   The food salad bar decent good variety mostly well done does good job light fare   people most disappointed those ordered all you can eat meat   menu said neverending parade meats    actuality served 20 minutes while rest eating bar neither anybody else restaurant   manager stopped ask if people getting meats which told no past 20 minutes   guessing he chewed wait staff because slow trickle rotiserrie spear holding waiters slowly started making rounds albeit far being neverending parade all servers appeared sour grouchy being made work   Most would come cut off small slice walk off leaving friends sitting trying flag them down more   As meat itself?  Nothing special   Most overcooked   bacon wrapped turkey good but often bacon wrapped anything bad?  Overall very disappointing price tag people most satisfied those just $19 salad bar because hungry rush leave   Funnily enough red green markers put table green sign servers bring more meat red tell them you're full   diners party ordered all eat meat finished dinner hungry turning markers red just could collect checks continue night   As rude waiter?  He delinquent refilling drink orders and 11 people way club order lot drinks point more occasion members party walked bar order drinks   When asked split checks he became visibly irritated us     lets see group 11 people four couples some single guys why would separate checks mandatory gratuity added sense?  many 28 30 year olds pay 10 friends eat expensive restaurant this     waiter then around table argued every drink orders which wasn't much thanks being AWOL    15 minutes later he tosses down drink bill basically said he made no effort try break up   In end thing waiter did right add gratuity both food bill drink bill   Everybody party 11 gave exactly he earned deserved tip $0 00    If you're looking all eat quality buffet MGM Grand Aria   If you're looking bad service Dick's Last Resort bad service least entertaining prices more reasonable and quality food sadly comparable    no reason anybody ever eat Pampas  <EOR> Wonderful dinner tonight!
