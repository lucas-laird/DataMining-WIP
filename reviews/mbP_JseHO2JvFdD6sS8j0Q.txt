I individual The Works pizza pretty good  think frozen through quick bake oven but still liked it  Subway  <EOR> This pizza best ever had  husband said best he had! shared pepperoni personal pizza because just wanted snack  did expect random pizza place taste good! only downside price because 10 dollars  think decent price would 8$ max BUT would buy again!!! <EOR> Fire ass Pizza didn't expect fire 100+ worth better Little ceasers cardboard Pizza <EOR>
