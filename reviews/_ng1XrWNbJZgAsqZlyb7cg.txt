HORRIBLE FOOD <EOR> Just FYI those might purchased Amazonlocal coupon dump   I ordered food take pay difference when guy taking order said take coupon  He mumbling something letting people know  OK now paid $10 cannot promised he some other guy walked apparently worked call owner   Well same story   they accept coupon  he said Amazonlocal depositing whatever percentages owed promotional sales  Luckily able refund Amazonlocal   Those purchased voucher place don't even bother order just refund! Also call themselves President's Pizza well    I seen another Amazonlocal voucher place well but never purchased Thank Goodness! your refund!!!! way all die hards perhaps food decent which why fair rated but most salad items even available    Hmmm   False advertising both counts here?!? <EOR> I Groupon place same day   total hole wall very easy see   no sign business name only banners say Shish Kabobs   Inside only 3 tables sit down cleanest looking place ever to   very odd because wall sub menu says President's Subs unsure if they're running 2 businesses what?!   When walked owner front immediately walked back   He didn't welcome never returned front walked in   kid front desk seemed he no idea going no idea take Groupon   entire experience quickly became extremely awkward just interaction kid   almost wanted just leave say screw $8   When he brought plates instead putting down front he handed directly us   When he handed forks he dropped directly onto plate   don't know if he nervous new just plain awful job    The food mediocre   Nothing all special it   rice bland pitas weren't anything special even meat wasn't great   friend shared 1 lamb 1 chicken plate    lamb almost tasted fish although she didn't say that   very chewy greatest lamb ever had   chicken looked delicious marinade beautiful but taste wasn't good look    NOT RECOMMENDED     PLENTY better kabob places Las Vegas serve better food better service same amount probably even less  Maybe subs better??  only reason gave place 2 stars instead 1 because food edible   But honest would rather just gone McDonalds! <EOR>
