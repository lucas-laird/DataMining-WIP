Overall food split soda pizza hubby $14 the soda   pizza crust nice crispness bottom however rather doughy me  Toppings okay great  would say probably your average store bought pizza nothing more less   The most impressive thing champion eaters would need eat equivalent three large pizzas each finish monster challenge  Although ultimately none Yelp teams finished 10 pound monster enough tried complete difficult task  <EOR> My wife 'welcome neighborhood' coupon Graziano's year ago which 2 free medium pizzas 2 drinks  pizza surprisingly decent ate all sitting  Thin chewy crust decent sauce no canned toppings  semi low expectations when walked because bunch 6 year olds running laps around place half restaurant Chuck E Cheese style game room  restaurant side peaceful enough conversation    Saw pictures wall 10 pound 2 person pizza eating contest contestants big pizza itself whole time eating 2 free pizzas feeling pretty confident would able polish off half contest pizza    A few months ago driving back LA stopped off I 10 grab quick dinner ended pizza place Beaumont CA formerly Graziano's  looks taste texture pizza clear new owners kept old Graziano's recipe  easily ate entire large pie  IMHO best practice pizza eating challenge may actually Graziano's try eat much pizza during $5 99 lunch buffet     Here talk thread planning upcoming Yelp Vs  Graziano's pizza eating contest http www yelp com topic las vegas restaurants with eating contests <EOR> Decent food non existent service daily buffet including pizza pasta broasted chicken salad bar $6 49  pretty much come broasted chicken which very juicy delicious  Pizza buffet decent but if order off menu food lot fresher <EOR> I can't stop raving place  food just 3 9 stars but customer service top notch!

best part doing way if pizza buffet kind enough us    Being few pizza buffets compare town CiCi's Graziano's definitely lot better quality few true family friendly places town  <EOR> This 1st time ordered Grazi's   real pleased enjoyed pizza    ordered Grazi specialty uuummm good     called back placing order added 4 canoli's order didn't bat eye   They made real canoli some fake things find Stores Vegas    all all coming back spot sure    <EOR> I agree Misti 4 stars but place nothing Shakeys Philippines  never Shakeys LA  potatoes big  Wish more mojos  Need slice them thin  Anyway food ok  didn't know free drink only 2 3  hade pay 1 85 drink  Thought kinda high but need money someway   looks great place parties kids  Garlic knots good  guy making pizzas did 2 different veggie pizzas us  All all good sure back  kept table clean  <EOR> We came son's soccer party  pizza tasted cardboard lot games ate tokens didn't give tickets when should have  pizza seriously thin cardboard pizza employees all teenagers don't know do  them didn't fully understand give son junkiest dollar store multi pack toys exchange 25 tickets  difficult  would never come own accord but likely back next soccer season  Hopefully pizza less cardboard like    BTW complained machine eating tokens giving tickets  said they'd check then didn't  stood counter talking coach 10 minutes waiting them give back eaten tokens no cared! <EOR> I normally won't review restaurant until several times   case making exception  First positive pizza drinks fine pizza buffet restaurant  average just fine   restaurant spacious clean   Now negative youth soccer league partnered Graziano's host end of year parties kids  team reserved tables particular evening almost two weeks prior party   evening arrived almost all tables reserved but no tables held kids parents  When staff management asked immediately took attitude somehow fault   took almost 20 minutes resolve service followed reflected earlier attitude leaving feeling if forced them accommodate us   least other team same time same problem   bad business Graziano's clearly overbooked evening    very poor take guests   restaurant potential but won't back definitely can't recommend Graziano's kids' group activity  <EOR> I love place  think could come back everyday disappointed bored place  Yes carry pizzas but really want lunch buffet! only $6 50 most days week well worth price  Oh but if want drink extra $$$  give water cups though   The buffet includes some type salad bar plenty choices toppings soups different types breadsticks broasted chicken which don't like disgusting overly large sized potato wedges pizza dessert pizza other desserts brownies gross cinammon rolls delicious     There bunch specialty pizzas included buffet well including some deep dish options  specialty pizzas tried included buffalo chicken barbecue chicken pizza  Those two favorites along just plain cheese deep dish pizza which reality anything but plain    Their garlic knots great  very salty lots garlic flavor them  think could eaten dozen those if stomach steel    Overall couldn't ask anything more pizza place  They're perfect  If want something isn't buffet just tell cooks you  Great service great food!
