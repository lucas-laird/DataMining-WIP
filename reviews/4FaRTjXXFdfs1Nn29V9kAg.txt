The music bit questionable but changed when asked   Overall very good back  <EOR> Broth flavor didn't seem developed other noodle houses town  probably back because close house but wouldn't drive many great options just 5 miles away Chinatown  <EOR> Interesting enough place but food just isn't very good  would normally write longer review but just isn't much else say beyond that  fries probably best thing but mess fries anyway? <EOR> Got garlic ramen blown away flavor  absolutely back  Staff attentive Joy let know some coming additions menu  Highly recommend getting your feet wet initial offering  boyfriend looking forward next time! <EOR> I am excited new ramen place close by! shared both Spicy Garlic Ramen Miso Ramen partner Cashu Rice Bowl appetizer    The service great seated personal booth intimate which like  quickly served Chasu rice bowl start with  really enjoyed combo saltiness meat balance onions rice together  main course definitely preferred Spicy Garlic Ramen because more savory salty compared Miso Ramen which bit sweeter broth  partner preferred miso all your preference  tell noodles aren't made fresh but didn't ruin meal  Because would come again convenience if craving ramen nearby but would probably Chinatown homemade noodles  <EOR> Having lived Japan 5 years also having tried other local Las Vegas ramen restaurants would give place meh   stumbled place open only 2 days hit soft opening  Water tap filtered tastes chlorine  Fried gyoza just ok more vegetarian gyoza edamame weird  Black Garlic ramen  broth bad  Noodles just ok little fat chewy  soft boiled egg cold center seasoned all  won't hurry back but might try few months work bugs out  <EOR> My work partner lunch around 5pm place empty  Tonkotsu Ramen point broth smooth rich noodles nice bite them  Joy waitress super nice kept smile face  $10 lunch money well spent today  <EOR> This ramen good! price amazing! service excellent too  highly recommend place  black garlic oil ramen  did eat whole cloves garlic but appreciated them being there  When am back side town return enjoy some more ramen  <EOR> A hidden ramen gem buried maze burgers pizza ice cream joints  fact area because taco place caught eye  But digress    Delicious food  Excellent service  Non pretentious  Friendly helpful staff  Extensive menu traditional foods drinks well more ubiquitous offerings    We would definitely come back  <EOR> Workers can't understand English eat meat pescatarian asked guy if pork miso ramen because eat meat he said no mam no pork ramen guess what? order comes without corn ordered meat tell excuse asked no meat  he looks confused if he can't understand saying simple words  Then he says no tell no pork sorry what?! clearly did tell argue he should take back remake but instead he wanted turn tables me  should difficult order right first time maybe should hire someone understand English if going taking orders  <EOR> First time here  Grand opening  crowded  Nice relaxing ambience  started fried Brussel sprouts appetizer  then added fried shrimp shishito pepper appetizers  main course spicy pork don Tonkotsu ramen bowl pork belly  Everything delish served hot    3 Sapporo large beers tab $55  deal! plenty take home too! <EOR> Worst ramen town  Never huge fan ramen choices Vegas Shoku bottom list long time  tonkotsu ramen looked delicious but tasted burnt garlic milk  chashu barely any flavor which surprising because supposed super fatty pork   <EOR> There's many things said great Ramen Ramen place  place's advantage  Its close Dad's place  he loves Ramen I  why three stars? Well let walk through it    The place itself should describe it  relatively small  made front restaurant into waiting area which think would've better place more tables  place swarming people  Its just gives off vibe wasted space  Its totally owners but  just opinion  overall ambience nice  party 12 people across Dad even small shop didn't seem noisy  guess place sit maybe 28 people  But tables arranged doesn't look cramped  Unlike some other shops where feels you're sardine packed all sake Ramen    Service let's talk that  shabby  two servers time visited  guess still getting used working place because seemed shy approaching us  don't bite well unless you're made Noodles is  Nothing bad though said place new  pretty sure time shop kicks servers probably more acquainted need do  waters pretty fast although always try see if Calpico  Which did refillable though  though fatass found gem  food took bit time due larger party versus just dad  Unless take hour serve bowl Ramen don't think  issue  best parts restaurant  chopsticks man! Yes chopsticks! Holy cannoli sorry know Japanese restaurant mean each own but thing absolutely hate being served wooden chopsticks when dine ither people  start rubbing sticks together they're trying light fire  mean come on! same excuse every single time don't want splinters  Unless you're purposely rubbing stick your gums hard splinters  Sorry rant  plastic Chopsticks   where getting to  look kind fancy too  tip kind rough hold food better  But isn't chopstick review isn't it  Moving on    The food hmmm put it? There's parts parts don't fancy  granted only ordered bowl Ramen then bowl Katsu rice noticed few things  would need come back few more times really nail food review down but here's two cents  ordered Shoyu based broth  taste there's better places  But its really close competitor favorite Ramen place  noodles some chew them  chewy would them but bad  standout bowl ramen would Chashu tasty  tasted seared bit before serving  chef mad Chashu skills  If would come back place would pile Chashu  Seriously good  Don't quote though  picky food  Just guy likes things tasty  Onto rice bowl  ordered Mayo Chicken  least  looked me  don't menu hand while writing review  Stop food critic  Just some dude likes Ramen shops  chicken katsu diced some mayo put top  would prefer katsu whole   just though  portion rice bowl pretty big  dish itself tasty but couldn't finish it  already full nothing taste  still wished calpico refillable though    Overall would say place become competitor but its still new lot people know yet  come back few more times since interested t <EOR> New favorite Japanese ramen place! quite cute place  your own ramen  Simply pick base soup toppings want  favorite black garlic ramen extra spicy  <EOR> Solid ramen place side Vegas  pork fantastic  black garlic awesome! <EOR> Had Tonkatsu Miso Black Garlic Ramen fried rice gyoza Karaage everything par pretty much any Ramen joints town   Jinya Kobo Sora Tatsu Monta Moko IzakayaGo many favorites believe would put place instant favorite  There's finally more west side town! <EOR> I dinner family  Ramen good favorite spicy don  lady served table nice fun!!! <EOR> Very tasty ramen we'll back  Shoyu ramen Black Garlic ramen enjoyed them both  Also deep fried Brussels sprouts which tempura battered good  <EOR> Food good  can't say food service did anything different distinguishes itself apart other ramen places  thing stood made Calamari Tempura  definitely traditional version most restaurants it  Tonkotsu Ramen Noodles  would come back family gladly eat again  <EOR> Overall just okay   somewhat ramen maniac isn't favorites town even top 5   best thing black garlic ramen chashu really excellent bbq quality thick   broth mediocre only warm beginning cold time halfway through bowl big negative me   Nice amount whole roasted garlic chunks   pretty spoiled all house made noodle joints now Vegas didn't really noodles thicker chewy style similar those packs buy grocery   ramen plenty filling sufficient amount noodles broth thick rich fatty style   husband spicy said equivalent Kobo medium spicy level   Chicken karaage alright just little plain   Takoyaki good cooked through properly   would probably come again if primarily needing ramen place lot appetizer side dish options  <EOR> I'd give place 3 5 stars  Ramen ok he miso  don't pink radish which kinda surprising  <EOR> Popped lunch today solo  treat?! seated right away vibe place super cool which sometimes deter foodiest foodies away  But tell music hip comfortable volume lighting nice food   omg good  Niku ramen which came two slices pork tender tasty helping spicy pork soft boiled egg protein packed yay mushrooms bamboo tasty over salted pork bone broth  damn good rich  service superb  really don't enough nice things say place  Normally heavy all portions but all ordered more satisfied struggled finish being full  waste drop  Seriously guys hardly came air once tasty dynamic  Each bite adventure  work just down street expect come once week lunch  happy came in  Keep up!

The servers friendly yet see crazy busy they're always able accommodate walk in  <EOR> So decided check new place business took over jumping rice rolls  pretty much same inside some paint more seating different music  Which already looked amazing understand staying budget when entering very strange benches front don't know sit your self luckily someone popped seat us     One better ramen places today miso pretty good might come back again try some others  now stick other two favorite ramen spots challenge entering exiting parking lot  <EOR> Unfortunately second experience bringing place down   place still smells bleach   and ramen bitter black garlic oil time   noodles also slightly overcooked   inconsistencies might drive little further Ramen Kobo   Also lamp above table two dead bulbs super dark   Takoyaki still legit though  <EOR> Yummy yummy ramen  ordered to go restaurant  wanting try since opened didn't disappoint   I ordered go to ramen style Tonkotsu  extra pork cuz things meaty  love came egg wasn't add on   did order spicy which some reason extra cost  spice level perfect me    The take away set came 2 containers broth itself  amount broth fit perfectly into container other goodies  wish more broth though    I really enjoyed ramen back more  delicious rich flavorful <EOR> A good Ramen spot  If craving ramen way home work location convenient me  may best but if you're area don't wanna drive all way down China town recommend place  <EOR> I ramen place 2 afternoon  busy server served immediately he introduced menu since first time visited place  ordered Takoyaki black garlic ramen  good BGM nice    The chopsticks very unique unlike used other places    I definitely recommend place  <EOR> Delicious food   squid balls fantastic   Ramen equally delicious savory    service ok only gripe portion size ramen VERY small   Paying $12 14 bowl soup expect something bigger    2 hours dinner found myself making sandwich home because hungry     sure back but more around lunch  <EOR> I think found new favorite ramen spot !!  wifey recommended try place since fairly new     walking restaurant   awesome ramen life poster store front   right away feeling place going awesome    walking in   greeted host waiter   sat right away   since wasn't busy   dinner time im sure place start getting busy very soon     decor very nice very simple   cool wall art decoration towards bathroom   lighting little bit dark lights little bit dim   all must take picture food before eating people   maybe use flash little spot light nice lighting effect   or sit somewhere else towards back bathroom    during day??  when usually ramen   black garlic style ramen if it   ask black garlic oil   place dedicated black garlic ramen   vampires beware    awesome !  also ordered chashu bowl call chasudon order gyoza because why not   prices very reasonable !!  everything tasted awesome exceeded expectations    wife ordered same thing thought garlic y must vampire    but did mind all   maybe add some butter vinegar   if don't garlic y water very cold filtered     the host waiter provided great service   refilling water   asking if want anything else   getting vinegar wife   etc    definitely come back   sure !!  enjoy ! <EOR> Very cute place!

NBD ended ordering Miso Ramen just chasu corn  broth just okay  wasn't best tasted but also wasn't super bland disappointing  Did thick noodles fatty charsu  more thing add tried Kokoro Japanese Style Fries which looked good photos yelp  Guess wasn't fan Oknomi sauce which made kind sweet  fries should taste sweet any reason lol    On side note customer service friendly attentive  husband also liked ramen better liked mine  Maybe give place another chance future  But when eat ramen need love it  going back usual spots! <EOR> This place just opened used Jumping rice same owners different restaurant concept  Considering just opened cut them some slack since also closest Ramen place south west really want them improve coz high chance come back  give them 4 stars but decided 3 stars based factors  shoyu broth though did look shoyu looked more tonkatsu explained because use pork broth base   best broth all ordered  just right  the black garlic ramen tad bit salty although still good flavor the kids Ramen broth horrible way way way Salty made almost inedible though nephew devoured his the chicken karrage good flavor but seemed  quite cooked looked tad bit pinkish raw although flavor good just maybe need cooked little bit more chashu pork good other places though   seemed used just regular pork belly ok but melt your mouth delicious chashu pork   So few minor adjustments new ramen place potential become 5 star place would try rice dishes next time since did jumping rice  <EOR>
