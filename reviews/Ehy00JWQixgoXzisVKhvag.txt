But night mercy struck guests occupied hungry  Okay where could quickly casually? bolted Pizzeria   First came bread  delicate basket but sliced mini loaf butter  Golden crusty outside golden fragrant inside flecks herbs some decent sized holes otherwise tight crumb  You tell reading bread cookbooks  Quite tasty  Mike stomach keeping mind relocation Vegas near future ordered starter grilled meatballs both butter leaf salad Gorgonzola hazelnuts egg  Mike's customary bacon mine without  Thumbs Mike meatbals  liked salad better Greek ish Bar Grill fewer ingredients kept flavours being lost perhaps  Still more interesting tastier salads many other places around town part reason Puck loses star here  much love good salad course wouldn't bother next time  Perhaps if you're vegetarian don't feel meh he offers  That said Mike liked salad well enough but agreed wasn't anything special  We each own pizza partially because different preferences partially because already excited idea having some Puckian leftovers next day   Choosing though hard  vegetarian usually pick between variety vegetables always include something icky  variety cheeses  Margherita  could Margherita but could also mushroom bechamel fontina arugula thyme  could eggplant crushed tomatoes fresh mozzarella oregano  maybe could try Yukon Gold potato mascarpone Brussel sprouts rosemary hold guanciale  hate Brussel sprouts yet still sounded good!  In end chose caramelized onion pizza creme fraiche arugula olives  Mike Italian meat think  Something pepperoni anyway  don't recall because pizza Darn Delicious all other pizzas discontinued exist  Oh fluffy chewy soft thoroughly cooked crust! If thin and floppy isn't your place  near buttery onions melted tongue without being greasy  fresh little pops arugula  olives discreetly flavourful without being unpleasantly bitter  would ever able face little black rings chain pizzeria again?

My husband veal osso bucco he said veal dry disappointing but gnocchi good light   I don't know if having bad day if all time  husband before thought wild boar ragout really good before but waiter talked into trying osso bucco dry   Wolfgang needs spend less time shopping channel more time restaurants  <EOR> Cucina first dinner when getting Las Vegas couldn't more pleased choice!! pleasantly greeted Tony server provided only delicious meal but entertainment well!

Se merece dos estrellas y media porque 3 no llega especialmente para la expectativa que genera El lugar esta dentro de un shopping como muchos de los lugares de Las Vegas pero este de alguna forma decepcionaba mas el lugar era realmente shopping y el restaurant como uno de esos locales en uno de los pasillos abierto de todos lados y con mucha luz artificial  Me sente en la barra y pesar de que eramos pocas personas en el local llamar la atencion de un mozo parecia tarea imposible  Finalmente logre que dieran bola para traerme unos ravioles sin mucho gusto nada que estaban medio frios ni les cuento para cuando trajeron el queso parmesano  cobraran por ellos un precio bastante alto   No creo que vuelva <EOR> Wow place serves SALTIEST clam linguini ever tasted!  No exaggeration may well saltiest dish ever served   Ever   ate two friends two ordered linguini other friend bolognese   could even eat food without first putting lemon juice neutralize saltiness   mention friend's linguini most creamy sauce while mine mostly butter herbs they made same pan wtf?! always known Wolfgang Puck's restaurant nothing write home but experience extremely disappointing   wasn't cheap either   no soda refills offered just weird tasting tap water   Which also needed lemon just tolerable   Ridiculous  <EOR> This happy hour worth it   chunky tomato soup not happy hour menu starter Delish   If good chunky soup   Then mushroom pizza white sauce  interesting flavor but liked it   Then calamari ok but price good presentation ok   service bar  Plus 20 percent off YELP  <EOR> I wish give no star all   My wife long day couldnt wait come back hotel  we ordered food togo but server very unhelpful order wrong  We ordered pasta salad forgot include forks   When call complain manager he claims provide unless ask it  Doe sense you??
