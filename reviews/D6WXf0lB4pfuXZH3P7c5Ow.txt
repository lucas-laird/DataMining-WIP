small udon even look bigger so called large rice bowl   also ordered spicy udon soup asked them if mild spicy waitress spoke super soft voice again the soup premade already just tell she didn't even effort best she accommodate request asked nicely can't ask chef anyway? saw ran chef said spicy udon soup less spicy chest immediately said ok obviously chef totally fine but why did she shot down soup premade already cut short just disappointed whole service experience really hard hire decent waiter waitress now day? <EOR> We came finding previous Izakaya place shut down Oodle Noodle opened up  experience actually below expected but still pretty good  servers kind rude some kind alarm issue going however still pleasant whole dinner because food pretty good  We kimchee nabe udon spicy cod roe pasta  both tasted better other Japanese fusion noodle places but little bland compared actual flavor main ingredient     come back if crave food! <EOR> This place pretty dark quiet  service very young friendly  We ordered fried tofu braised pork chicken nanban carbonara udon mentai cream udon okonomiyaki  The tofu chicken nanban ordinary  best consistent nanban much more flavorful satisfying  braised pork tender nor tasty expected yelp reviews 5 star rating  braised pork udons' flavors both good but noodle pork exceptional Monzo Spring Mountain Road  okonomiyaki best flavor ingredients octopus pancake  Would return?
