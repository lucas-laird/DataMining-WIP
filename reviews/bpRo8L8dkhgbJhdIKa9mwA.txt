Looking back perhaps guaranteed gratuity meant no incentive good service   The food delicious  several veggies all fresh but nothing spectacular macaroni which highly touted good but again best had steaks which even most elite foodies group said best they've waygu sliders which mind blowing  No signature cocktails all coated candy $18 apiece which absurd non artisinal bar cocktail  drinks Grant Achatz's Aviary less that   We left without complaining physically rush sure rest night's plans weren't messed up   Would back food definitely warranted second shot but I'd weary  <EOR> If gave 5 would never room improvement   staying Cosmopolitan thought we'd give place try   usually always Stack but hungry long day races   seated right away service amazing   all ordered bone filet couldn't happier   truffle fries creamed spinach asparagus terrific   Drinks stout quick table   first time left steakhouse Vegas without dessert but way full   atmosphere dark laid back modern visually pleasing  <EOR> Absolutely love place!

Great texture flavors mixed well    foie gras french toast  if eat wrong it'll taste wrong   little bit everything same bite chew all together   surprising loved it  pumpkin ravioli  some people might texture pumpkin but love it!  refreshing taste opinion  organic filet mignon bone filet  both delicious cooked exactly wanted can't complain think bone better but both great   lobster good but stand comparison rest meal  sides mac cheese sweet corn pudding mushroom pot pie spiced maple carrots   standouts mushroom pot pie sweet corn pudding  dessert sorbets come small scoops small cones SO CUTE but careful dropped scoop few times cheesecake pops chocolate mousse okay   don't remember else but none them standout maybe TUMMY STUFFED    Recommendations mushroom pot pie foie gras french toast bone filet   Also music seems louder night later take into consideration earlier dinner date vs trendy rowdier scene later <EOR> I must admit first bit hesitant giving place try  haven't many reviews yet restaurant which made little uneasy choosing place  All knew wanted try restaurant Cosmopolitan both vibe menu STK attention    We checked Chandelier Bar managed lose some money tables before heading over 8 00 reservation  first impression place bit smaller expected other reviewers right saying music bumping    We sat bar 10 mins  before being seated  Although would rather sat back further actual dining area seated another dining section right off bar   I guess made some good people watching bar like guys lucky poker pants   see pics ! Also thought might little hard first hold conversation over music but surprise wasn't all   but maybe  because more drink louder naturally spouse probably just everyone else haha The bread amazing amazing took bite just stopped wouldn't full off just bread   starters foie gras french toast beef tartare  Both exceptional    the foie gras french toast very interesting flavor while being sweet same time beef tartare actually best tasted  only ever tried 3 life but just surprised fresh light tasty was!   I ordered filet which bit over cooked medium but didn't want send back just enjoyed could it  husband's ribeye cooked perfect rare he just ate whole thing! side enjoyed maple glazed carrots sweet corn pudding  sweet corn pudding tasted dessert almost side all  passed actual dessert just enjoyed wine    Our server great! Usually when restaurants often attended team servers  sometimes even hard figure head server but STK server stayed whole time which enjoyed    One thing wanted note music definitely bumping other reviewers correct saying if looking quiet romantic dinner two   this isn't place you  If looking upbeat space some great service food then STK might just looking for  <EOR> Bad food  hooker bar best!

Luckily suppose just stopped snack lounge area   situated sort couch next strangers  but  okay   When cocktail came around ordered hamachi sashimi beef tartare   food took little while come but busy thats okay too     The music live but service really why STK 2 star me   hamachi good nothing rave but still good   Instead receiving beef tartare given beef carpaccio let waitress know she rudely said Well said carpaccio tartare but did want take back?'  YIKES fault can't hear music really loud!  She took back promptly delivered tuna tartare   Closer but still wrong let know she kind just walked away   When she came back we hadn't touched it she asked if wanted keep it    confused if she meant keep instead keep also just said no just beef tartare please   Finally beef tartare came apologetic busser hamachi good but best   Everyone lounge seats next supposedly amazing bread everyone keeps yelping about   complementary?  never received any    because she found difficult?  also ordered beet salad go   When says comes arugula means few sprigs   would call more side order roasted beets   I would try STK again because feel need try some steak amazing complementary bread but open lunch?

The portions steaks sized depending size order but shared medium between two people stuffed  <EOR> This combined review twice within weekend  First time pleasure accompanied greeted chef  party 10 which private room   meal creamy corn lobster Mac cheese lobster thermadore  Mac cheese completely burned tasting lobster wasn't juicy tasting  shrimp cocktail pretty good  felt bad telling anyone wasn't happy meal  much good time laughing just didn't bother it   did let friend taste Lobster Mac cheese indeed burnt  Didn't donuts which more disappointing    Fast forward two days came again birthday party 9 total  waited extremely long time but no complained more catching trying best things  greeted deepest apologies along best service ever  tuna tartare spicy crab shrimp cocktail  All amazing!!! Ginger mojito pretty good if say myself   Now dinner  Each something different other two days ago did however let server know service he assured same  same dinner lobster thermadore but server mentioned he put everything side  also ordered creamy corn mushroom pot pie recommendation server  course creamy corn always delicious oh gosh mushroom pot pie gooooood new me  lobster good nothing two days ago  Which weird chef come greet us  But meal totally different two days ago  Loved dinner  everything Delmonico  tuna filet salmon chicken  Everyone different sides funny thing someone lobster mac cheese tried again Vegas location wayyy better two days ago  Scooooooorrreee!!

Come now  gouging     I don't mind dropping money quality steakhouse meal but when wine ludicrously overpriced go  hard overcome   Because enjoying some fine red cut carnivorosity     Plus think old fart ripe age 36 but steakhouses best in opinion when classic old school types   Some Frank Dean playing background leather booths gin tonics before meal etc     Techno music?  Cosmopolitans?  Cosmo resort trying awfully hard young hipster vibe yes some those kids some serious money blow   guess need place those people  decent meal paid way much it mostly due wine cross place off list forever scene  kids your fun though   then wait line pay $50 admission into some similar techno playing club  <EOR> STK located inside hip Cosmopolitan Hotel celebrity chef  Remember awesomely wacky Chef Stephen Hopcraft season 7 Top Chef? pretty sure might top list places seen Vegas   Ok cares people let's talk grub   If you're looking place grab quality slab meat you're right place  sides classic steak joint generally hit spot  Solid meal much better most generic overpriced steakhouses LV Strip  <EOR> So good!  wife did date night here   Everything great quality flavor food   Steak great best but still great  If looking best quality steak Mastros wins  PROS Atmosphere!!!

Service fantastic! greeted seated right away without any trouble!   Kiiiiind expensive meal alone $130 for 7oz la carte filet mignon overcooked glass $20 Malbec sides $12 pop then factoring an awesome well deserved tip  don't mind dropping dough nice meal trust bf's biggest pet peeve ha! definitely better but really nice evening   Great music best server  wish could remember name!! something regal he should wearing ascot monocle smoking jacket all times  pretty sure started W   <EOR> Great truffle fries mashed potato kale salad  Steak perfectly cooked  Nicely seasoned comes choice sauce  <EOR> Wow!  waiting all week Vegas!  can't help but feel just little bit cooler having eaten STK   moment walk hostesses managers bartenders servers diners all outgoing excited high energy beautiful cool people   fact probably most uncool person place haha   Top off some delicious food some great beats coming speakers night STK better great night casinos   OK really but whole lot better way spend your money bad night tables!  Since STK Cosmopolitan would expect little hipster side meant bad way does disappoint   Chandelier may coolest bar Strip STK complements well   mentioned atmosphere loud side mostly old skool hip hop playing probably best place if looking quiet romantic business dinner   Our service team very attentive knowledgeable accommodating     I petite filet which done perfectly   table all kinds sides but particularly enjoyed truffle fries mushrooms creamed corn   For dessert server whipped little sampler plate table which excellent     One downside only single bathrooms line little long although imagine could find just outside restaurant     Be sure reservations because room little small side sure bring credit card because bill little big side   If Vegas celebrate something special just want live beautiful people night dressed head over STK  <EOR> Went during brothers bachelor party Vegas  Incredible night! Steak seafood platter delicious but atmosphere made night awesome  DJ bar music pumping  almost club restaurant combined  wouldn't quiet dafe night but perfect start night town  definitely back  <EOR> STK blast always good time  However if you're thinking having business dinner would recommend it it's club lounge feel DJ stating around 7 00 each night VERY loud save business talk somewhere else just come fun  Watch though management decided put some bitchiest snottiest unfriendly 20 something girls hostesses let power heads! Still waiting some your party? You'll wait  Want little earlier your reservation? You'll wait even if place isn't crowded   Want different larger table? You'll feel disdain roll eyes ask special request   Why mgt put such unprofessionals first point contact beyond everyone encounters them even staff  <EOR> I dined STK couple years back remember thinking just OK  birthday enjoyed company celebration  didn't let bother me  When invited again free figured why not?  Either stepped steak game STK fell off even more because overall NOTHING impressed me  Wait fib mushroom pot pie side dish good enough order again  dinner would cost $145 best part side dish?!!?  My boyfriend ordered gyoza field greens salad 20oz ribeye sliced mushroom pot pie panna cotta dessert   First sharing way go  Other potstickers being extremely small coming only 4 costing $19 happy portions servings  offered split salad slice steak very appreciated things that   They staff game cleared plates gave fresh silverware every dish  salad needed more cheese croutons   made enjoyable  steak just ok  amazing bad  bacon butter top super succulent  side mushrooms came classic looking pot pie crust when cut into 4 types mushrooms creamy sauce  highlight night! panna cotta never again! Wrong consistency just all around enough flavor me    Another downfall glass wine $17  understand fancy steakhouses charging more specialty cocktails high end liquor etc  But even then ranges $10 $15  $17 glass mediocre wine pathetic    I STK's concept  sexy club feel high end food  Except wasn't vibe got  More cutting corners steakhouse caters local adult industry rich tourist old men eye candy   Vegas needs don't wrong  am hating adult industry least  But when well known Vegas working girls dine regular attracts certain crowd  wouldn't see those same girls down street Herb Rye thank God    Overall favorite part DJ bumping 90's jams mushrooms  gladly skip drunk red head tourist sitting next screaming spilling stinky wine pervy old guys   However Vegas place everyone just mine  <EOR> I last week bunch gals bachelorette weekend   wore different color wigs management know talking   Anyway ordered ribeye steak one more expensive steaks house which very nervy fatty very little flavor  other girlfriends did same say! side dishes mac n cheese creamed spinach ok  mushroom pot pie pretty good  feedback rest group less expensive plates pretty good  service also pretty good reason why giving STK 3 STARS  don't plan going back though next time Vegas  Gallagher's New York New York much better n prices comparable  <EOR> Ate 6 7 people literally ordered most menu  liked almost everything usually picky  never disappointed any STK but first time trying much food  <EOR> Fantastic ambiance excellent food!  Probably best steak experiences ever had   Phenomenal sides main selections   Decor mood music excellent   server John started strong but finished extremely weak once food delivered   He ignored point on  never asking meal if anything else needed   definitely needed cold brussels sprouts reheated but weren't going way flag down watched pass time again tending tables 8 5 around us   Shene the serving assistant? bus boy? fortunately delivered making sure great experience made sure paid attention to  He wouldn't accept extra tip saying he just doing job  Thank Shene thank STK whole great dining experience  Please remind your staff what's important customers paying top dollar gorgeous dinner  <EOR> Edit posted original review below decided give another try yes very next day   time order 10oz filet mashed potatoes  Though took MUCH longer food time nice because didn't feel rushed did night before  also much quieter easier talk person sitting next Tuesday compared Monday     The filet extremely tender cooked perfectly  ordered mine medium rare plus  Again flavor left something desired and already knew going filet isn't most flavorful cuts but still better Sirloin which briefly read review below     I upgraded 2 star rating 3 star because second night lot more enjoyable but definitely want give different steak house try upon next trip Vegas  Oh yeah mashed potatoes pretty damn good but could used little pepper tiny salt               My 1st review Monday evening I STK birthday few years back best steak ever had  Hands down    Decided try again last night sirloin just wasn't remembered  wasn't flavorful tenderness just average  averagely moist cooked tiny bit underdone but nothing would complained about    It nicer restaurants Cosmo atmosphere terrific but fairly loud crowded last night but expected lot more popular restaurants   noise level more less caused date shout each other whole dinner  Again nothing would subtracted points over all score over but something keep mind   The Mushroom Pot pie wasn't bad but basically bowl liquidy mushroom filling layer baked dough over top  Nothing special frankly little bland    I posted different review saying sure going come back STK but know some restaurants off nights most likely give another try  <EOR> I don't mind loud places    but most ridiculous place ever been  more able conversation friends when Bonnaroo  am exaggerating when say waiter *yell* us    That said all food great  rib eye cooked perfectly super tender  mashed potatoes excellent well  Despite having scream service very good too    I wouldn't back but if don't mind really excessively loud environments while eat you'll some very good food  Prices ridiculous but guess  expected Vegas steakhouse  one small other thing    'full bar'? No  no draft beer! Which seemed really common Vegas  mean its steakhouse having nice cabernet anyway but why no draft beer? If want beer $9 bottle Blue Moon? Maybe because Portland live SF    but expect good restaurants few good drafts  Some micro brews nice Belgian SOMETHING! <EOR> Elizabeth Matt nice made 2 visits amazing   came month ago no reservation sat bar   best decision ever made   old fashioned cocktail gf    point!  Dinner wedge salad candied tomato balances richness blue cheese awesome   Filet cooked perfection  Sides Mac n cheese soy glazed haricot vert perfect   But must say dessert sweet potato doughnuts blow mind    Both visits made 5 but know yelp deletes 5* reviews gave 4!  back stk pretentious boring other steak houses perfect place us <EOR> Everyone enjoyed steaks  porterhouse great  asked no onions but grilled onions only plate  Dessert ok  mashed potatoes ok  Dinner 4 cocktail $389 00 kinda high  Points off loud music front staff hosts thought very high themselves  <EOR> From start finish place great  Seared Big Eye Tuna choice evening did right  Service top notch  Great Wine list too! must if Area  <EOR> This quiet romantic place unless enjoy yelling your partner over DJ middle room  being said very good steak place   Came friend actually ate two three nights Vegas   steak first night bone in ribeye foie gras butter grilled  medium rare very enjoyable friend sirloin filet foie gras grilled seared rare also top notch actually bit more melt your mouth tender     However star show beet salad am sure if always menu but came back second night just eat delicious appetizer again  <EOR> We party 14 put awesome room took great care us!!

Seriously good!! ordered blue iceberg salad which good but friend ordered chopped veggie sale which looked amazing! main both ordered skirt steak which tender cooked perfectly  side ordered truffle fries which good but wouldn't order them again  didn't order dessert because full but I'd definitely come back try other things menu  <EOR> Really fun vibe but food just so so   steaks flavorful but sides delicious   If dropping kind money dinner want really good steak   The ambiance really cool think NY lounge scene restaurant   Loud music DJ but really worked   group ate before big night definitely mood fun  <EOR> I did everything power move pre clubbing bachelorette dinner STK instead original plan Palm probably good but also old    some convincing bride simple phone call STK easily able seat party 9 quite possible greatest steaks ever had  Rib cap special top truffle butter  Worth every  Damn  Penny  steak meets dreams regular  Truffle Mac cheese Also regular food dreams  Best Mac ever had  Ever  Ever  EVER  Truffle Lobster Risotto special decent flavor but small serving worth price  bit bland could use more parmigiano    The ambiance other STKs very hip lively perfect spot dine before hitting club  Only weird thing place lack bathrooms there's only couple   But guess since located inside hotel casino could easily leave restaurant bathrooms far outside restaurant anyway  But food service far outweighs minor convenience  Also if say yes bottled water start pouring water FIJI bottles  extra $10 15 bottle I don't remember exactly much but just careful because they'll sneaky   <EOR> Went Sunday dinner friends  Amazing food  Amazing service  Amazing ambiance  Made reservations via OpenTable prior arriving  bread blue butter amazingg! ordered creamy yukon potatoes 10 oz filet  guy ordered 20 oz bone filet if mistaken HUGE  literally could shared steak both would more satisfied  <EOR> I've lot steak establishment life but probably best place steak ever had  14oz Delmonico amazing medium rare truffle butter added    Sides ala carte weren't anything special but ok Cauliflower gratin Brussels sprouts  wouldn't order sides again though    This LOUD restaurant beware if you're looking quiet intimate setting because play music reasonably loud    Finally Vegas gonna expensive  You're looking $200 $300+ two people easily especially if drink  Two dirty martinis $41 dinner two additional drinks two sides two salads two steaks additional $269 00 before tip  All all around $350 dinner drinks  <EOR> I love restaurant  Service great food even better  meal didn't rush door  able order more drinks while listening great music  bartender even sent over special drink us <EOR> this place tight  literally piece meat plate  noticeably great piece meat where taste obvious high quality which guessing STK supposed justifying themselves worthwhile fancy restaurant    plus if want order anything else like fries lobster mac cheese extra $11 20  wouldn't mind if fries lobster mac cheese any extra pizzazz compared normal versions but wasn't case  just regular old mac cheese hardly any lobster! needless say very unimpressed STK  place stuffy overpriced $600 6 people 3 girls 3 guys sufficiently yummy   best part bachelorpad yacht feel interior   if you're into kind look  <EOR> Out Las Vegas Memorial weekend  Stopped STK try somewhere new  finishing meal felt place nothing Spectacular very Loud music filled fancy good looking people  more scene steakhouse  Would come back anytime soon becuase food quality more important scene  <EOR> Great service food  only complaint place feels little cramped  Other better steakhouses Vegas  <EOR> The Kobe steak maybe greatest thing ever eaten  Melted goddddamn butter  creamed corn side world  Also would highly recommend tuna poke well  Outstanding service gorgeous Armenian siren I'm only describing way because can't remember pronounce name want STK give props being great recommending both Kobe steak creamed corn   Would definitely eat again  again  again!!! <EOR> We waiting 2 1 2 hours must say sincerly disappointed  am really picky when comes good steak heard  place great   But must say waiting time WORTH IT  steak came burned fat   YUCK service Super Slow  would think amount money paying could least good steak  must say  enjoyed Steak Lobster dinner WAY more TGIF NEW Orleans 13 99 next day   Would highly recommend   instead STK   <EOR> It little difficult reservation but figured since may great restaurant!  selected restaurant because always reading Twitter Mag etc  maybe would lucky see celebrity   LOL   Anyhow early reservation before Vegas show   When Cosmopolitan hotel 3 levels escalators there   just felt restaurant part mall    hotel   kind awkward seeing all other restaurants same floor Food Court!  seated right away served baked bread blue cheese butter chive oil   wasn't fan but okay   think its more acquired taste   waiter very nice gave good recommendations   ordered caesar salad it's standard us which good   Filet Medallions husband ordered Skirt Steak side Mac Cheese good Mushroom Pot Pie excellent !  dinner okay die anything   time restaurant definitely filling parties bachelorette parties etc  fun people watch  cool restaurant but wouldn't rave food its more ambiance IMO  <EOR> A few members team STK while Vegas work  food ambiance great but really made great experience waitress Jackie P  wine selection point she just really nice attentive too  She's also very pretty which doesn't hurt  Bottom line going great choice Jackie P kicks experience notch  <EOR> Awesome restaurant few drinks good dinner!



Anyways let's over positives  service good friendly waiter strong knowledge menu  pushy gives time space  Other goods bread corn dessert  steak some better others mine slightly charged the cowboy steak   favorite part meal probably dessert donuts cheese cake both really good  Oh yeah truffle fries pretty good   The negatives portion size sides $13 two people won't full one  Also pricing drinks might $13 15 per well drink? maybe little bitter alcohol portion tab since casino drinks free or while losing hundreds ! Lol  Another negative stated above partially charred steak friends said theirs really charred  Mac cheese mashed potatoes meh! Guess overall slightly disappointed $750 meal 7 us  <EOR> Food service atmosphere    Everything perfect    except volume music  really cool atmosphere  promise won't hurt vibe turn down just little  Seriously    <EOR> The food great actually full price  around 9 00PM its chill hip hop playing music type place  If some quiet type restaurant well you     I just wish weren't sitting next some couple looks just met  because making whole time  why some other places hotel instead restaurant lol  Anyways      Out all things ordered loved foi gras wild mushrooms steak most!!! fries also great!!! foie gras cooked perfection steak!! beed carpaccio usually favorite but place    The customer service also great!!! wish remember lady's name but she really nice helpful  <EOR> STK pure Vegas   All hype show but underwhelming when comes substance   service alright certain points waiter did seem rather put off having explain certain items menu   excited foie gras French toast however wasn't impressed quality foie dish didn't work me   fillet well cooked but nothing spectacular especially given price   Parmesan truffle fries unfortunately undercooked somewhat crispy outside but still raw inside?!?  However place does 1 star playing 70s 80s music avoiding need play Top 100 music!  decor cool modern but certainly didn't food service  <EOR> We early dinner STK dined private rooms  black padding little odd but least shielded noise dining hall  Service very attentive servers ever present yet annoying    We shared crab cakes chicken skewers crostini seafood platters start  kale salad crispy quinoa delved into 7oz  ribeye lobster tail  beef cooked perfect medium  tender minimally seasoned allowing natural flavor juices really shine  accompanied few sides shared mashed potatoes macaroni cheese green beans none which particularly memorable  Clearly focus entrees   The salted caramel budino huge large finish meal but topped cookie crumbles whipped cream making few bites able take delightful   Down hallway restrooms guy manning table full bathroom essentials  Again more odd thing but guess Vegas  <EOR> Friend mine ate STK last Sunday LV   Other friends traveling opted catch Beatles show elsewhere town hearing review show know friend better evening   Two guys steakhouse dinner stays pretty basic drinks salads steaks few sides   ALL GOOD place   admit having some reservations based prior reviews regarding noise level restaurant am very pleased say didn't experience all   Maybe those running STK read reviews toned down?

Music awesome! Food cocktails good! Great service! Thanks STK enjoyable evening! <EOR> For least decent steakhouse nice element array restaurants Cosmopolitan   Pros The menu pretty customizable  means if know want if don't you'll probably end picking something doesn't hit spot you  divide cuts meats into small medium large special categories those add your choice rubs special add ons I chose skirt steak peppercorn crusted example   Then order sauce well horseradish! Sides also surprisingly tasty   the green beans hit table despite everybody thinking them just because needed vegetables Great service  Cons cost bit  more expensive average nice steakhouse other cities as you'd expect They enforce dress code some degree   which bit surprising given see people all sorts attire casino floor floor down  They'll stop if you're wearing swimwear you're walking line if you're shorts flipflops For some reason turned music pretty loudly middle dinnertime point where felt club given very dim lighting  The special dishes sound absolutely amazing but couple people table wagyu the less expensive special which still $100 plate portion size almost laughably small which guess ordering something premium Vegas <EOR> Steak amazing       filet medium cooked juicy creamy spinach side made me feel Popeye   atmosphere even better  There's reason top steakhouse Vegas <EOR> Food really good  service ok don't expect any waiter waitress smile you  little bit pricey  expecting spend $120+ if don't drink  $200+ if drink  Generally speaking good place steak  <EOR> Great service! feel very welcomed  Food amazing worth every dollar spend  Definitely coming back another night out! <EOR> Everything STK amazing except service   food delicious   think steak best decade!

I shared Short Ribs Carrot Butterscotch Celery Cipollinis side Parmesan Truffle Fries   Short Ribs very tender flavorful fries your typical fries some bar  They're cut almost steak fries but almost perfect rectangle   totally taste truffle oil goodness! Both served pipping hot which major plus! Just keep mind since steakhouse going pretty expensive  why good share some dishes won't cost your wallet Servers pretty attentive filled waters anything else needed   but even better waiter gave all complimentary Lemon Drop shots dessert! Super sweet him! <EOR> I really wanted love place based all hype  actually just okay  came birthday dinner group 4  Service really great  server spot on  food other hand okay  thing really annoyed if want your steak taste super yummy order extra sauce cooked $2 extra  did order extra sauce since figured expensive steak must amazing without extra sauce  steak actually just okay  would compare steak would find diner  Also annoys crap when feel am being nickeled dimed  $2 steak sauce??? Just add $2 price each steak call complimentary sauce  wanted special dinner birthday but didn't happen  least company made it  Would recommend place  <EOR> Two stars because ambiance service good   food sucks   all sounds fantastic but just doesn't come through   bone ribeye ton appetizers   appetizers okay steak awful mean w f u l <EOR> My party 4 came dinner greeted great service  server friendly attended food complaints professionally   Bread blue cheese sauce chive olive oil rather adventurous really enjoyed since fan blue cheese  Unfortunately friends didnt enjoy quite much each its own!  Beef tartare black truffle sliced radish soy caramel Love fragrance black truffle brought freshness beef  potato chip also very fresh  Really enjoyed this   Pork belly soy glaze pickled radish ginger first time served pork belly over cooked much tough chewy  great  send back  second time much better more well seasoned though still little tough liking  I'd give pass   Lil BRGs wagyu sliders Super good!! didnt add truffles foie gras but if chance again I'd definitely try adding both!  Medium Sirloin steak best steak night  Steak beautifully cooked soft easily cut layer fats making steak dry  Definitely recommended   Medium filet foie gras topping Steak slightly dry liking but foie gras beautifully cooked    Medium Rare Filet Medallion first time served beef way overcooked  cooked tasted overly charred beef definitely past medium rare  sent back beef perfectly cooked second time round  Recommended!
