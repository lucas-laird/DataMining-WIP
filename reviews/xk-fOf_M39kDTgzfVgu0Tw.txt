Rachael's kitchen see month! <EOR> Good food guess  But way over priced service pretty terrible  They're usually rude very rarely actually your order right    If decide eat pay online  Half time they're shoddy online system doesn't actually transmit your order  If order online don't expectations they'll actually your order    Also always check your to go order before leave store  3 last 5 times haven't given type fries ordered  <EOR> It's walking distance Container Park Fremont St  love downtown vibe location has  Same set decor menu other locations   Orders taken smile served another smile  friend both ordered sandwiches sides fries  ordered pressed green drink  Food right other locations  that consistency know expect Rachel's Kitchen means something customer  definitely keep location mind next time exploring downtown  <EOR> I've only few times but never disappointed  Excellent customer service ALWAYS amazing food  If love yourself order acai berry smoothie Smoked Turkey Avocado sandwich  Best items menu far concerned <EOR> This place benefited having somewhat normal menu very hipster trying hard area town    Prices absurd being only place know protein shake downtown known grab every now then  Things your standard banana peanut butter protein shake $8 bucks when $5 any other smoothie shop earth  Needless say stop coming in   I live downtown all supporting local establishments but when restaurant ask employee questions menu item expect answer hold let ask   hate that  Why don't know your own menu only work there?   I've turkey burger very forgettable egg wrap even more forgettable  wife pancakes think she kinda liked but other time together she veggie burger  garden burger whatever call patty full cheese tho menu made zero attempt aware this  She ordered without cheese  If worked would raise flag person doesn't want any cheese? then wouldn't want your customer paying $10+ dollar shitty meatless burger aware cheese riddled patty? answer no  Also if worked wouldn't known cheese patty cause no works knows anything    They received extra star serving coke products keep mind actually star review much needed but undeserving boost  <EOR> I place  simple  simple  perfect place pick quick lunch while downtown  interior easy eyes reminds bright little cafe  menu selection pastas sammies eggs smoothies salads 'lighter side' menu where keep those heathy items  items turkey sammich smoothie aren't anything write home into detail but exactly menu described them completely satisfied after  Tack online ordering check in offer 50% off beer wine local delivery on awesome delivery bikes Rachel destined become good friends  <EOR> I always count delicious food when eat but  even best part  service always impeccable!! constantly above beyond create great experience  would highly recommend them!! <EOR> I sum experience today A catastrophe errors  Walked Saturday 1pm  Three people besides myself inside restaurant  Three employees behind counter  walked register  acknowledged even looked at  employee phone other two talking each other backs me  minute passed nothing  moment should realized going bad experience    One employee eventually comes register doesn't say hi  sorry wait but just says here? The phone still feet away never acknowledging      I ordered 1 04pm  ordered simple grilled cheese sandwich  sat down  1 28 no food service telling made error  time several employees kitchen behind counter talk relaxed each other  Working afterthought all them  front counter ask speak manager because yet food  employee back never returns  Another employee standing eventually comes says am charge right now what's wrong  said want refunded want speak owner  She phone  Talks two minutes then hangs up  Then proceeds back work acknowledge again  confront say where manager  She said he 15 minutes  wait him  The audacity suggest could wait waited 30 minutes grilled cheese never made  walked out  doubt ever return    I stopped going often due two previous health violations SNHD poor customer service  Today solidified desire return sure people know work do  <EOR> Dudeeee far best service all Rachel's kitchens ! Mannnnn give much food ! def stingy nothing actually don't come side ways other Rachel kitchen location workers ! <EOR> I ended going Rachel's lunch because many healthy options areas near strip    The parking situation pain even though spot use credit card parking machine only takes cash coins    I sampled tuna curried chicken salad before deciding order  tuna excess amount mayonnaise chicken dry  looked menu additional five minutes because did know order skeptical because did think food par based samples  decided chicken sandwich light menu friend chose tuna even though she tried well impressed   The sandwich poorly stacked because lettuce placed bottom became wilted  did enjoy seasoning chicken which all could taste when eating sandwich  friend said tuna overly watery which made tortilla soggy  She also thought much tuna additional ingredients needed order combat mushiness tuna   Both times Rachel's found food average lazily made  <EOR> Awesome environment  Great food good coffee solid service  Justin's service second none  <EOR> Loved it! best breakfast! Ordered freshly squeezed juice acai smoothie smooth delicious! top off playing Beatles album just perfect! <EOR> Wow disappointment ! first ordered eggs bacon  Toast cold  Bacon cold  Potatoes pathetic frozen pile fried squares  WTF ? guess place gets rated lazy non cooking fools Ogden condos  <EOR> I love Rachel's Kitchen  am always pleased food service  Great place lunch  come often  smoothies great  Hawaiian bliss favorite! Also albacore tuna wrap bomb! fishy filling  Cobb salad today very good  flavors mix well house made dressing yummy  <EOR> There 4 people restaurant took sandwich salad 30 mins made  Ridiculous  Don't come your lunch break cuz won't back work time  <EOR> Rachel's Kitchen offers large assortment items menu  recommend smoothies  very refreshing  service good most days but always trouble ordering over phone  I ordered chicken Caesar wrap side French fries slightly disappointed  wrap awesome  good portion  But amount fries sad fan  I would give place chance again but eating ordering go  <EOR> While passing through Las Vegas way Reno stopped into cute juice bar some really cool bicycles front  Since driving all day nice lady behind counter recommended couple 1 oz  wheat grass shots give more energy rest journey  She took great care run wheat grass through juicer few times sure she every drop juice out! wheatgrass before but don't remember being sweet  don't know where source theirs but probably best had    We also couple fresh juices  green base kale spinach cucumbers ginger  other beet base ginger other fruits  both really good refreshing  Even kids liked them  didn't try food since pretty tight travel schedule but definitely back next time come Vegas! <EOR> I really dig place  always come because live close but since life style choice changed vegetarian place sticks even more me  many options me  Never noticed before  Staff friendly always place clean always lol  place going great food friendly staff huge menu  always find something here   I fresh juice cucumber apple pineapple  Man crisp refreshing  Great flavor  Then breakfast burrito wrap  only disappointed two things  asked some egg burrito over easy egg would run all over burrito  cooked over hard  also asked if could cut because easier eat way but did cut server noticed asked remake but could tell didn't wana re kinda hoped would eat way  If your running food notice problem back fix before hits table  Even though wasn't IDEAL burrito did taste good  Otherwise very happy customer Yelp check in free muffin carrot raisin muffin very good! <EOR> Was DTLV work looking breakfast  place close hotel  scramble eggs sundries tomatoes goat cheese basil avocado  OK  Eggs definitely over cooked tough time ate them  potatoes point though cooked just right  Price decent  Would consider going back getting something else  <EOR> My order incorrect cold upon arrival  Paid twenty bucks food  delivery regular sandwich cold fries <EOR> Sadly disappointing bland food high prices long wait minimal service   I walked 10am Saturday otherwise empty restaurant sign? asked if pastries vegan  waiter did know ask chef also wasn't sure said probably weren't  Then asked if any smoothies could made non dairy he said yes some  asked 2 possible options he seemed remember alternative vegan menu handful potential options he could show me   I eventually ordered steel cut oatmeal $5 added strawberries bananas $2 25   waited 10 minutes oatmeal  bag everything could need unfortunately food worth wait price   The oatmeal watery bland even taste   1 sliced strawberry half banana sliced top it  fruit flavorless guessing frozen thawed oatmeal   I wouldn't recommend vegans maybe eggs bacon better  <EOR> Yami always nice sweet whenever walked through those doors  place best very very healthy highly recommend it!! <EOR> Food great setting chill    Away Vegas craziness unwind  ordered Turkey Avocado Sandwich grilled vegetable chicken   Both excellent  portions generous  <EOR> The service food incredible  haven't seen many people kind energy restaurants  Big shout Justin being kind putting smile faces  back sure  <EOR> First stop Vegas certainly didn't disappoint  breakfast wrap delicious Justin super kind attentive girlfriend loved juice bar juice wasn't super sugary fruity over load but instead savory spicy green juice   Highly recommend spot! <EOR> It awesome pineapple juice veggie burger signature pasta everything just amazing  Would definitely back again !! <EOR> YUM! sure if quality everything menu same ordered but if then YUM!  The Favorite just damn delicious   love Goat Cheese really topped off  Avocados too?? Can't wrong that  side bacon ordered delicious well  but all bacon good bacon right? definitely order place again  delivered maybe dine next time  <EOR> SO beyond dissapointed  Rachels Kitchen  placed delivery order 11 15 quoted 30 minute wait time  When waiting 45 minutes called find if way  very rude guy answered phone said order ready waiting picked up  When said delivery he said No its hung me  called back only answer again  He placed 11 minute hold woman answered said would remake sandwich 2 juices send them right out  now 12 45 just called back find sent yet  fail! dissapointed Rachels Kitchen  your ish together  <EOR> I'm sure fuss thought place okay best  food little odd recipe not bad anything just different great     For example mushroom burger apparently comes multigrain bread whereas might expect brioche most restaurants  understand maybe health bent and hey Santa Monica all more power that! but certainly never impression should expect come that  breakfast omelette came well just fine    Again something I'd consider terrible but just definitely think other options available being Vegas Vegas all  why those places?  GOOD healthy? free wifi clean bathroom OKAY almost all it BAD umm   odd bread choice? <EOR> 3 stars almost generous  440 sandwich  paper thin slice chicken  sandwich 95% bread tomato  sweet potato fries just average  Tommyknocker imperial nut brown $4 bad though  funny jury duty day  ran courthouse place try ran back  would reluctant give second chance food  Happy hour might reason come back but even then why would I? plenty other better places drink  many options downtown see myself going again  <EOR> Rachel's Kitchen becoming favorite Downtown lunch spot me  normally come when want food  tasty healthy ish keep satiated throughout workday   I usually order Chicken Caesar Wrap side sweet potato fries  name suggests Caesar salad wrap  don't greedy chicken which sliced thick contents aren't drenched dressing  especially wrap option substitute flour tortilla wheat tortilla   Their pecan chocolate brownies sweet fudgey  They're little heavy side but perfect shareable desserts top off meal    Lunchtime full diners making difficult find seat  Plus parking bit pain  Although could place order pick delivery    Rachel's Kitchen great addition handful local restaurants Downtown serve food  delicious made to order  <EOR> Wow again! Imagine Subway where everything truly fresh healthy! you??! Yeah   me neither  However Rachel's Kitchen Downtown LV least give hope mankind  I travel especially LV sea All Eats Fried Meat chains 14 1 pizza even more difficult find heathy options  vegetarian but eat plants when road  often search Vegan restaurants just healthy options did previous night  Once again left such place disappointed lame choices basic lack VEGETABLES $35 VEGAN plate tasteless hipster feed   I'd eaten breakfast Rachel's last year just recalled being stuffed !   Swung time lunch sandwich something  WOW! Forgot great choices offered! Ordered smoked turkey Avo sandwich took chance side salad  No chance whatsoever choice! No typical 3 leafs iceberg 2 tomato wedges crouton smothered bottled Ranch here!!! Hallelujah!!! base dark leafy greens diced tomatoes nice pile julienned carrots cucumber slices soy based sauce I think   Awesome! But pretty sure even turkey sandwich more vegetables vegan meal night before! Nice pile dark fresh greens tomato slices avocado  really exaggerating  Even two choices fresh made iced tea  Feeling healthy stuffed again  looking forward breakfast tomorrow before heading out  <EOR> I found myself really unexpectedly disappointed Rachel's Kitchen   All other locations great reviews but failed see where all hype comes from  Ultimate Grilled Cheese    very ultimate  Thin sliced white bread some cheese couple tomato slices  expected thick crusty bread really quality cheese    boring kid's menu grilled cheese  could made something way better myself home wayyyy less nearly $8   The french fries breakfast potatoes made fresh frozen  turkey turkey sandwich isn't nice piece turkey breast boring lunch meat  use light hand apply seasonings much flavor   The service really friendly though  smoothie reasons am giving 3 stars instead two peanut butter blast delicious non fat yogurt made least gives illusion eating healthily  Since location literally right downstairs probably stop future pick smoothie but nothing menu couldn't tastier fresher version upstairs way cheaper  <EOR> Quality ingredients great variety super friendly  family tried soups sandwiches juices salads all delicious  Great all around daytime food environment! <EOR> First time visiting Vegas looking good place eat  Came across Rachel's Kitchen  staff super inviting  love music  playing too  Food delicious but favorite thing visit 2 awesome girls helped us  Both super friendly smiley talkative  If ever visit Vegas again definitely stopping again!! <EOR> The service much slower Centennial location  would think being busier area town would same if better service  food always good just wish didn't wait 30+ minutes food  <EOR> I tried place twice service terrible didn't matter food tasted   Both times wait order 8 10 minutes register staff unfriendly no sense urgency getting orders out    The orders both times took 20+ minute  time only smoothies ordered    They brought items time long delays between everyone served separately   I enjoy Summerlin but never again  <EOR> Service good food not  Very bland  breakfast burrito vegy scramble  Won't return  <EOR> Very clean delicious fresh  best part probably friendly staff though  Thank Justin welcoming recommending some great options  Looking forward eating again soon  <EOR> Was yesterday service beyond slow    food order wrong     TWICE! girl took order nice but  only positive thing say place  food was     forgettable     would've better off going McDonalds saving myself couple bucks  service food just worth it  <EOR> Came Friday afternoon some coworkers   Four ordered separately but right another   person food almost immediately upon sitting down but halfway done second person received ordered   time third person received order check mine still waiting   should noted ordered same menu item second person receive order   counter check mine came FINALLY!  fifth person joined late into lunch but ordered while still waiting item   There's came shortly mine   zero sense!   Ironically visit almost three years date last visit experience almost identical minus fact no where near crowded no lines plenty seating   Rachel's food but if want eat group place would risk going lunch   Even though ordered separately all line together time group only ones placing orders   Maybe spot win takeout but won't returning takeout otherwise unless coworker choice which case probably decline offer  <EOR> Their chicken caesar wraps amazing  Rachel's lot good healthy choices lunch  Don't forget try sweet potato fries  <EOR> My wife ordered bacon cheeseburgers  bacon wasn't drained blotted   burgers cooked unevenly liked nuked kinda rubbery  Disgustingly greasy  Probably could better burger across street Heart Attic Grill  fries cold  hate cold fries  service however excellent! <EOR> Oh wanted go?

Hope see soon!   Jaime Kastner <EOR> This pretty solid place eat  Fresh quality ingredients taste generally very polite friendly staff  place I'd recommend quick bite eat however  located bottom floor nice condo tower right corner Downtown Las Vegas Bum Central  Don't surprised see homeless person sleeping patio   The environment inside very clean although bit cluttered seating arrangement  more communal dining your own separate table  bathrooms always spotless which clear indication value cleanliness  even bus your tables on side note I'd recommend using glassware dine in guests save waste  You're already bussing tables washing plates flatware    Back food  Huge menu done right  Again cannot stress fresh everything always tastes  cook everything order menu boasts some familiar foods upscale twist without upscale prices  Everything very moderately priced considering quality food service atmosphere   I'll sure come support business when come back tourist   Thank food memories first place partner breakfast together    Get 440 way  favorite sandwich here  <EOR> Great DT Vegas location very friendly staff clean trendy atmosphere  food fresh healthy yummy! scarfed down The Favorite which proves why favorite when back am sure again! Can't wait back more  <EOR> Gave place 3 honest tries  3 different items 2 different times day over month period  food just doesn't taste great    Omelette    Burnt small portion frozen style cubed potatoes    Tuna melt    Flavorless tuna salad needed more salt mixed in   Burger    post photo    If  medium well I'd hate see well    Maybe if buy enough well done patties put them into trash compactor they'll turn into man made diamonds! Fries limp definitely cheap shoestring kind suggestion put them separate breathable bag to go orders own humidity doesn't them into soggy mess Pricey quality food probably justify because juicer behind counter making them healthy place charge premium  Take your money elsewhere better lunch breakfast experience    <EOR> Food tastes homemade but downside cheap actually yourself  cheap coffee but there's no flavored creams vanilla  You'll better off getting coffee 7 11 down street  There's fruit smoothies plentiful  Decent place but prepared low expectations  <EOR> I am preferred customer their loyalty program regularly order smoothie work nearby  salads before well although super fresh nothing special   especially price  felt if skimpy ingredients  They'll give large container but barely any lettuce toppings  thought would try wrap see if things any different   Today tried  Caesar wrap  menu chicken Caesar wrap asked no chicken problem said    My order over $11!! Caesar salad wrap!! same price would if chicken it! standard practice food industry would never pay price simply Caesar salad wrap    The wrap completely soaked dressing dripping wrap beginning soggy  still ate because hungry needed back work but would never order food again  stick morning smoothie  <EOR> Got catering service delivered! Service definitely fast efficient  tuna wrap chicken sandwich scrumptious! salad fresh dressing very light tasty  <EOR> I looking coffee place breakfast burritos found Rachel's Kitchen  Bonus menu plenty options me  The people behind counter friendly helpful welcoming atmosphere general relaxing  impression team behind  cares very much creating experience customers love certainly me  Fantastic food seems everything made scratch  Looking forward going back! <EOR> Had wanted try Wild next door but doesn't open until 11 am  Rachel's kitchen great menu lots options though! Everything seemed fresh lots healthy options   I opted the favorite omelette Justin BLT sandwich egg fries   The omelette awesome loved mixture sundried tomatoes avocado goat cheese shrooms! homefries lacking seemed store bought kind  Justin enjoyed BLT also!  also ordered berry smoothie   made frozen yogurt instead soy milk which made creamy frozen!  I also iced coffee soy milk but wasn't best     much soy milk coffee grounds settled bottom   They currently awesome yelp deal half off any alcohol  Woohoo! Great way attract customers! Unfortunately road trip afterwards no mimosa brunch!  I glad came before lunch rush place seemed place be!  Definitely worth trying fresh food worth prices! <EOR> Delicious breakfast  Everything fresh tasty  Just perfect relaxing healthy breakfast great price  Highly recommend French toast breakfast burrito  Sounds heavy breakfast but perfectly portioned  Yum! Two thumbs fresh juice too  <EOR> Good selection fresh food  Smoked Turkey Ciabatta bread BBQ chicken wrap  Both really good  <EOR> I Rachel's food but they're very stingy  ordered chicken sandwich fries lunch  taxes delivery fees paid almost $20 handful fries  wonder why people end fast food places  pay $5 enough food fill them up    <EOR> I work breakfast week really pleased everything ordered up   starters everything just tasted fresh made right then   fruit surprisingly biggest highlight everything just tasted good wasn't mushy some fruit selections be   Their breakfast wraps also really great few varieties mixed each tasted great did french toast bread sticks   lady brought everything incredibly nice made sure everything needed then some   Overall very enjoyable experience nice way break busy morning work   I'd back try when little more free time but initial impression healthy fresh delicious which ideal trying 1015 fingers crossed eat little more responsibly   But least close work perhaps try them during lunch breaks burger sandwich  <EOR> I know lynched but very very disappointed place  number issue? Premade veggie patties  Factory grade  seven bucks? No  place boasts healthy choices but doesn't its own veggie burger? myself stay away them because full soy sodium hate HATE seeing them menu anywhere  But whatever other things look great   So Breakfast Ultimate Grilled Cheese  Most certainly most ultimate grilled cheese ever had  bread soaked grease cheese good  small tasteless tomatoes didn't add flavor all  only thing enjoyed off plate potatoes    I also Peanut Butter Blast smoothie pretty darn good though very peanutty still very refreshing   Perhaps just order wrong thing but really far veggie alternatives quite lacking  Maybe just location Downtown but left baffled supposedly great healthy place  <EOR> I ordered two breakfast burritos acai smoothie travel lodge circus circus  The food delicious! delivery lady very nice delivered food 15 minutes before expected delivery time  Definitely recommend ordering when come Vegas again  <EOR> Great spot delicious food Friendly staff good vibe  The pasta Alfredo delicious! Their free wine great perk highly recommended  <EOR> I experienced Rachel's Kitchen first time tonight since opened building  ordered turkey sandwich wife chicken caesar wrap  turkey sandwich good but wasn't anything amazing definitely worth hefty price tag regular  turkey sandwich some avocado  Its something definitely made home  wife said chicken caesar ok but nothing impressive either  really dissappointed because feel aren't many good restaurants downtown yet aren't located casino ones great limited hours  place also limited hours   closes 7pm weekdays 8pm fridays saturdays  overall impressed  <EOR> Glad tried place out   heard good but always impression vegetarian type restaurant   so!  two trips excellent burger pretty tasty turkey wrap   very varied menu including soups salads burgers even some alcohol   Glad place opened close office!  should weekly visit   prices reasonable well  <EOR> Service Justin quick friendly   Food fresh tasty   Coffee great!
