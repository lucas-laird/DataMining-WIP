Food came fast feasted took home some food  15 20 mins! absolutely hate coming into restaurants last min sitting around knowing they're closed  Lol work restaurant industry am fan when comes people coming last min sitting around hours close  no bueno! <EOR> Some best Chinese Las Vegas since Cathay House closed  best neighborhood may seem cleanest but delicious authentic food worth it  <EOR> For some reason food don't taste same   family going years  few generations  There's nothing real Chinese food  Good portions space  server doesn't even know jellyfish  add salt food plenty go  <EOR> This place great! If you're fan small Chinese restaurants probably best city to  family always gather ocassional weekend celebrate birthday   Prices fair food great  huge fan calamari place always seems consistent making very delicious  restaurant itself very simple functional its appearance  find interior decoratives much look if  your thing  But if purely great Chinese food looking nice treat  <EOR> Believe little restaurant very good point years ago  really liked crispy fried oysters  family used come family dinners good prices   Years later become so so ok place but better places why come here? kind place   cheap lunch special lots choices keeps bringing customers also might regulars live area helping place stay afloat  bathroom passable but could cleaner  last time came eat couple strange patrons haven't come back  just better spend money place really ya know?
