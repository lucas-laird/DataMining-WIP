I'd skip ordering OJ  Turns bottled concentrated Tropicana stuff  Does taste fresh squeezed nor does taste fresh  Reminds sour OJ sipping sessions during depressing hospital visits  Definitely gonna roll coffee next visit   Prices more reasonable breakfast menu  sandwich tater tots OJ all under $5  end spending almost twice much getting something off regular menu   P S  Free Wi Fi offered here! <EOR> I love fat burgers but last time families order right ever time gets dirtier dirtier   unclean stopped going   example smash burger Sahara compare inside cleanliness   taste FB better but don't want eat some place dirty   Imaging kitchen don't see like  <EOR> Wow terrible costumer service  Called place order pick up  Young lady answers tells hold on  stay phone 5 minutes while hear chatter background nothing being busy  Then heard someone finally pick phone hang without even checking see if someone line  across street 5 guys instead now  <EOR> First off food always great  good  But made experience wonderful JAMIE  She very nice professional  Made dinner well worth it <EOR> Ordered 4 med burgers cheese fat fries onion rings 4 drinks   Priced $40 which bad burger joint made ordered   we figured would long wait but didn't realize would 20 plus minutes   However reading all reviews knew worth wait   Burger came dry nothing other reviews where others said juicy   Huge disappointment!  2 stars since onion rings fat fries decent  <EOR> I've other Fatburger's valley far worst    Came 5 50pm order two burgers medium large cheese no tomatoes some fries  cashier very nice however don't fooled nice face does mean sense urgency  order punched 5 59 since know burgers order expected food ten minutes   Wrong  female cashier male cook absolutely no teamwork whatsoever  all over place literally falling apart only 4 5 orders screen  food just sitting under heat lamp good ten minutes before she decided grab hand off  20 minute mark getting impatient because elderly woman order two burgers before she ordered me  politely asked where food cook said coming right if complaint wasn't fault because short handed    That's load BS opinion  manage high volume restaurant any competent staff handle multiple orders ESPECIALLY when whole menu essentially burgers fries  Even two people proper teamwork sense urgency sense priority should able handle work load especially since trained do    6 34 comes around finally food along other woman waiting orders come which long ticket time well  cashier said if came next time said botched food would replacement  don't want replacement  want into food establishment order within reasonable time period  30 minutes acceptable ticket time two burgers weren't even made properly    Other locations good just needs some serious improvement  <EOR> I showed work burger fries Saturday night 410am  posted hours door read open until 5  employees inside locked door then proceeded laugh ignore me  Unprofessional infuriating  <EOR> Overall good place eat  location 5 times now good decent  restaurant itself isn't cleanest  bathroom very old restaurant kinda old now think it    Fatburger gets very expensive well  Two people getting 5 oz burger cost around 20 25 bucks!
