Yes please   quality menu excellent deal   Fried chicken skin check Chicharon bulaklak check Plus plethora classic filipino dishes   PS Skip coffee unless nescafe instant coffee  <EOR> Visiting San Francisco  tried eat ofcourse its buffet eh  Everything well food  Walang complain normal filipino cuisine cheap price $9 99  Masasabi ko lng dun sa owner nung restaurant n naka orange apron sabi nung ko worker cya daw may ari  Kaya pala kung pagsalitahan nya ng masama ung mga tao nya sa restaurant kala mo kung sino  pinapagalitan pa nya sa harap pa ng customer  Sana man lang madam kung may concern ka lang pls  Nakakaawa yang mga workers mo dyan kung ganyan ugali mo  always talk them close door  Huwag nmn sa harapan ng mga customer mo  Nakakawalng gana  Kung ganyan lang din ang trato mo sa mga taong nagwowork sau  Sana maclose ang business mo  Grabe nya sigawan ung matanda nakakaawa  Isipin mo nalng nanay mo kung ganun gawin sa kanyan  KARMA! <EOR> I love filipino food    buffet such great deal only $8 99!! excited see big selection food choices  However all food really let down    Everything way salty esp soup karekare  customer service wasn't bad everyone stated  However instead being bland thought food salty  going back even if price amazing <EOR> I always come some food to go staff always friendly helpful  plate rice two types food $5  deal!  The food best around lunchtime right before dinner  that when freshest because turnover number people eating there   On Sundays dining room packed full hungry Filipino families chowing down buffet keep food coming pretty regularly  only around $8 person quality Filipino food place great group people eat   The only thing don't area where restaurant located  Directly across Maryland Parkway Sears the Boulevard Mall place want car into restaurant quickly vice versa when done  parking lot also pretty full may around again park roof  also most pleasant area around evening  no qualms restaurant itself however!  When come try sisig bopis  They're both usually pretty fresh delicious  kare kare also excellent extra bagoong  Try out! <EOR> I really enjoyed Filipino buffet  lot cheaper ones Hawaii also much variety  love could also your own fountain drink refills  anything fancy but food pretty good  rice kind mushy only problem   They also sell snacks super happy watermelon seeds available purchase!!  Remember bring cash because  all accept  <EOR> Ended 2015 Filipino BANG review let's start 2016 another Filipino review!  Although hate say bit more whimper   Oi Kusina Ni Lorraine really wanted you   mean packed weekend peeps everywhere   even wait 20 minutes seating    busy were!  But most important stuff *the food* kinda lacking   Looking many other reviews see Kusina Ni Lorraine coming average best   I mean place lot going it   Large interior nice long buffet line even Filipino market connected right next door   Some downers kinda questionable part town yes lived near Maryland Pkwy  over 6 years while attending UNLV very little parking unless squeezed upper floor parking some marks cleanliness   I over downers   But man food itself?  gotta good gonna take ya' down notch   Sorry Lorraine but some better Filipino food other eateries across Las Vegas   your all you can eat buffet $8 99 person really just OK   might just but lot items similar tones BEIGE   some color food!  Even though admittedly don't often eat more 'exotic' stuff when comes culture's choice vittles   Fried head tilapia?  Eh leave tatay   Bulaklak crispy fried pork intestines aka chitlins ?  Unless hot fryer save Lipitor another meal   Dinuguan pork simmered pork blood ?  Sometimes but really gotta mood gotta lot rice   The food Kusina Ni Lorraine just didn't whet appetite day guess   some rice duh    some pancit which bland side where flavorful tiny dried shrimp?    lot other main dishes just weren't appealing day   Maybe burn having much rich food over holidays   Maybe because reminded own Grandma's Filipino dishes no made better her    Maybe just wasn't hungry?  Nah hungry   Maybe fact lot food day way pork based?  Well really can't complain much there   love pork   think just overall blandness everything tried   bistek beef cooked onions bad but really good father in law's   lacked some flavor missing something   adobo wasn't point day but Filipinos mess adobo?  mean come on!  national dish!  But really low vinegar didn't acidic kick   vegetables well just vegetables   even sinigang lacking taste   soup made bones??  Ugh let down   Surprising?  'dessert' bar which all cheap fruit some wicked decent pineapple!  Yes!  actually sweet treat eat!  But wow weird part   It quandary much even forgot take pics all food   foodie!  really must tired drive back Las Vegas San Diego Christmas holiday   Kusina Ni Lorraine just didn't impress!  I'll back again give Kusina Ni Lorraine another try sooner later   just hope food!  But $8 99 AYCE definitely decent value   HOI HOI!  PSSSTTTT! <EOR> I found little gem yelp because craving some Filipino food right down street  food served buffet style taste just mom's cooking!! come often work grab combo plate go  place highly recommended! <EOR> Great selection popular Filipino dishes  Good deal $8 99 per person  Come early avoid crowds  <EOR> Sunday morning family craved Filipino food before leaving back California  aunt local recommended place    They opened 9am came around 9 30am 1 family present  welcomed instantly upon arrival lady told Tagalog just food eat then pay once done  all Filipino food many delicious dishes comfort food choose from  $10 00 per person def worth money    The atmosphere super home y comfortable  Many customers came we're told same eat first then pay after  TRUSTING HUMBLE!!

I hope your liking <EOR> This Filipino food buffet you'll ever LV  friends visiting SF man restaurant best selection food taste cuisine very tasty highly recommend all guys try favorite restaurant whenever come visit  <EOR> My family hubby did weekend trip Vegas celebration brother's birthday  honest whenever Vegas generally stay strip never really outskirts  time things different since mom determined some Filipino food Sunday brunch before long drive home   She heard friends place great   course any other parent pleasing child more trying to avoid confrontation child ended here   At 10am shocked see place running  long buffet least 15 different dishes ready eaten price $8 99 pretty unbeatable    The staff very attentive very sweet while loved all options felt food bit saltier heavier side  Then again Filipino food all about  put into perspective none close being hungry even 5 hour drive!   The ambiance inside did give authentic Filipino vibe very roomy! Unfortunately outside littered homeless people asking change   did feel bit sketchy    All all good experience! <EOR> This Filipino buffet smashes all Filipino buffets Cali  big selection all favorites grew to  chicharon bulaklak dinuguan beef steak sisig more  Plenty food unbelievable price   Like parents when growing wasn't any air conditioning but plenty fans  food atmosphere made feel back home  ordered halo halo dessert topped off already sensational meal  Definitely going back again when come visit Las Vegas  <EOR> came first time hubby cuzzen   it alright   not much selections filipino buffet type  <EOR> Great spot Filipino dining  Classic buffet style set everyday Filipino staples  Great price great food great customer service  felt home parents haha <EOR> Hands down worst Filipino buffet ever to  really didn't food selection not varied enough bland restaurant could little cleaner   My major gripe when found long piece hair fish  pointed wait staff lady just took away plate without offering any apology  top still charged full price buffet  realize restaurants different policies when handling types situations but least staff could done acknowledge complaint instead sweeping under rug  never again  <EOR> Absolute gem Pinoy food fix while Vegas    Food selection aplenty definitely something everyone     Service friendly may fast but hey all savoring may next best thing items since motherland   The best part Small bowls hold all those good food akin yet another winning  Vegas buffet Wicked Spoon Cosmopolitan!
