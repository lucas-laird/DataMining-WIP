As far food concerned pretty good most part  wife decided share variety dishes could sample different flavors menu  started off nachos which came loaded tender Chile Verde cheese over top crispy tortilla chips  Good but forgot don't cheese pork  Something weird happens when cheese mixes sauce meat  result gelatin mixture wet sloppy cheesy goo  Next time no cheese please    We also tried carne asada burrito rice inside  Tasty but better versions town Los Tacos example  fish tacos kept hearing much fishy disappointing  But hey Las Vegas! fresh fish be? star meal adobada taco seasoned well perfectly cabbage hot sauce  Next time would order handful those just fine    Prices reasonable spent 23 00 all food large soft drink  back visit Phrank support restaurant he obviously cares much about  <EOR> The breakfast burrito site!

But spotless clean cute nonetheless   The man counter could more welcoming polite  assume Phrank he featured pictures wall  He asked if before then walked through menu   After tantalizing description both settled carnitas Carne asada torta  sandwiches awesome!! Soft bread griddled crisp filled flavorful tender meat crisp fresh shredded cabbage cilantro onion   bread smeared refreshing white creamy sauce   Phrank explained use same stuff fish tacos   sandwiches served lime wedges 4 types fresh salsa   All great flavor   decided preferred carne asada slightly more carnitas but loved both  The menu included lots choices tacos burritos tortas nachos salad flautas on   wereso happy when left spent $16 lunch two two drinks    Phrank even stopped table 3 times check level happiness   He offered more salsa refilled drinks!
