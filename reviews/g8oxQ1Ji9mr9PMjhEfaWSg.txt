Came all girlfriends bachelorette party great time ! Bartender laughing whole time!!! Would highly recommend!!! <EOR> The name says all  should your last resort   We walked restaurant many times before deciding looked load fun food okay greatest    The biggest problem restaurant server yes know you're supposed sarcastic service he mouthy which great  But aside being pretty much ignored most time even though he pretty much just wandered around most time    Near end meal two girls came he sat bar talking them he completely ignored he also another large table probably seven people bug bill    The second problem drinks bought large margarita souvenir glass yes did order extra shot came strong couldn't drink it  husband did but did bring server incredibly strong bitter complaining mind just let them know all he said well he ordered extra shot didn't you?  So all all very good meal save yourself some money else where  wish would have <EOR> Went Dick's Last Resort over 4th July weekend  Surprisingly wasn't busy  concept restaurant employees obnoxious rude cruel  great job bringing concept life but reality feel take far    If your first time they'll explain run down restaurant  gloves off  When taking initial order didn't even chance order appetizers  When waitress walked asked order appetizer she didn't even acknowledge me  also wanted clarify if free appetizer yelp would work if check in  Literally 5 minutes before food came server brought food    The food overall ok nothing special honestly  Typical bar food decent bbq french fries weren't any good  charge tap water  But price paid food definitely worth it  When bill waitress said redeem free appetizer yelp doesn't apply appetizer ordered  WHICH WOULDNT ORDERED FIRST PLACE IF ACKNOWLEDGED TOLD FIRST PLACE    Overall give 2 5 stars  Would back unless someone knew really wanted go  I'd rather eat food court buffet  Save your money spend else where  <EOR> We friend's birthday dinner reservation but wouldn't seat group until entire party arrived only 2 10 people missing   understand if show more half your party hadn't arrived but seriously 80% group there  read reviews some people found Oscar much but honestly he great!

just settle drink bar instead wasting money food  <EOR> If dine better some semblance sense humor play   if your sour mood appreciate some a hole behavior jokes then come place cheer up   walking few hours wound chance best meal week   much food but great service laughs throughout meal   food offers standard traditional fare sandwiches burgers BBQ like   BBQ pretty good Mac N Cheese quite yummy amongst sides   The HUMOR THOUGH priceless   weren't joke Dick's Last Resort but knew something special   brusque welcome number sarcastic shout outs husband fired joined fun   Since seating being picnic thrust into some situations where diners start ripping into a trio immediate right couple leaving a duo striving romantic evening trio's right   meal continued waiters sense customers hats appear funny inflammatory missives   I really appreciate attentive and savage diatribes times service   felt comfortable unpretentious atmosphere   Dick's Last Resort doesn't try something not   what simply natural order things  <EOR> I other night super excited but Dick's really did meet expectations  seated right away  good but more fact weren't busy service   I anticipating insulted offended all good stuff but I can't believe saying server insulting enough  mean he didn't come insult enough    The table next behind ordered around same time finished meals before even food  understand may because fairly big party 8 us but  really excuse  also waited over 10 minutes just drinks water ___   Besides everyone else actual glasses while plastic cups  What's that?
