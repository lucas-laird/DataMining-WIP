One personal favorites brisket part two three meat combo plate pulled pork ribs remaining options   However top choice far Grand Champion Plate currently $24 00 well worth it! which essentially let's try little bit everything barbecued Memphis offer  also entree would usually purchase aforementioned birthday promotion   The servers invariably friendly attentive portions generous wait until big appetite before coming trip worthwhile    Takeout orders also available those adventurous souksy prefer consuming delectable barbecue run just Bonnie Clyde  <EOR> A couple co workers talking good buffalo chicken salad was     area always mood try new things  wasn't great first impression place    I ordered called order picked through drive thru   Which nice convenient   I also side fried okra   start okra    tasted ok very light flaky   Honestly prefer little bit more crisp breading okra    Overall buffalo chicken salad pretty bland  your choice blue cheese ranch dressing  chose ranch  salad you're typical iceberg salad mix topped two onion circles croutons 4 cherry tomatoes cheddar cheese buffalo chicken   start saying buffalo sauce chicken decent but croutons mushy wasn't much allure besides chicken sauce    choose something different next time  <EOR> Not time great place eat now if say anything your incorrect meal your servicer gets pissed off use come weekly but stopped now know why just don't care shows back  sure! <EOR> I love myself some BBQ but honestly say Memphis BBQ truly falling off map quality food  briskets very tough rolls hard well  even ask waitress if she could warm biscuits inside microwave because just hard  only place only last resorts if McDonald's closed  would choose fast food over place just being honest  <EOR> I don't know thinks real BBQ  must 1 never eaten real BBQ 2 never food flavor before   This CRAP disgusting bad location no flavor  Brisket sandwich NO flavor bbq sauce all fatty meat  TriTip just few slices fatty meat no flavor The hus puppies OK kinda burnt  $25 bucks I'd rather eat anywhere else  waste time money  <EOR> For people don't recognize REAL Southern Style BBQ Texas Memphis even Kansas City Gates BBQ even Los Angeles then may good enough them   place yesterday seeing page online few times   Boy extremely disappointed   ordered three meat combo $19 99 plus tax which gives three small baby back ribs small link cut  four five tiny slices beef cut two side orders  Looked kids meal  far stingiest BBQ establishment even gone entire life   Road Kill Grill three meat combo $16 45 PLENTY meat BBQ good   two meat combo Road Kill Grill $14 45 gives more meat folks three meat combo   Los Angeles place called Ribs Nest El Segundo Western ave REALLY GOOD BBQ three meat combo last time checked around $15 50   give PLENTY meat sauce   NEVER patronize establishment again   Overpriced NOTHING money   Shame them!
