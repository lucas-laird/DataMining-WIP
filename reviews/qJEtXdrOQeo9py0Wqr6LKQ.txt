She more miserable looked sky disgust mumbled something else  ignored it  then asked put lil more mozzarella  it  torture her  then asked fresh mozzarella she totally squeezed water off cheese onto pizza  never seen more miserable disgusted rude employee life  other tons employees all courteous helpful  <EOR> I first heard Blaze when wanted some pizza checked new place near where lived  didn't really feel waiting line time didn't go  Today some people work saying great pizza decided stop try dinner  glad did  young lady helped very kind informative walked through ordering process  start price only $7 95 all toppings would like  Then huge variety toppings complete control over much little want each one  variety pizza dough but picked favorite which thin crispy  surprised delighted when found actually thin crispy  best dough ever anywhere  crust slightly burnt places but  alright me  grew eating Shakey's pizza always little burnt too  pizza very good definitely going again  <EOR> Place completely ruined evening  Showed time pizzas ready  left twenty minutes pizzas supposed ready  Arrived home only find no garnishes pizzas Pesto Arug back met confused looks when told them messed pizzas adding proper toppings garnishes   After waiting another 10 minutes pies   they handed them AGAIN no garnishes  heck?! Then proceeded put wrong garnish wrong pizza   seriously? Walked $20 garbage boxes cold cardboard cheese     Not even apology Manager even offer something right hour life never back because incompetent staff  <EOR> Im happy there's Blaze pizza northwest side town! My family love love love Blaze Pizza because inexpensive tasty service always excellent  only downfall freaking busy place get! However when came pick pizza line pretty short 5 7 people   Wednesday afternoon just opened place two weeks    When first walk feels chipotle but pizza options  pick your dough sauce cheese toppings  your way down line build your entire pizza your liking  Then baked pizza oven which why freaking tasty! dough always perfectly cooked pizza oven    We usual gluten free dough marinara sauce sausage mushrooms artichoke Parmesan cheese  But order whatever want  There's 50 different meat vegetable sauces choose from  If fits they'll put on! Remember though becomes more difficult eat pizza when there's many toppings! sit down take box go    I definitely recommending coming here! If visit during dinner times it'll least 30 minute wait longer especially weekends    Happy dining J Tran <EOR> This place while love pizza finally decided stop by     Regarding menu simple straight forward few pre selected favorites standards   course also create your own pizza whatever you'd like     For review just standard BBQ chicken pizza   perfectly cooked finished quickly   Father's Day while wasn't busy decent line able through quickly   time paid until pizza could more five minutes   Top notch! Well done team    Wood fired pizza pretty easy hard mess up   Having said if bad temp setting someone doesn't know doing could easily end crispy pizza soupy middle     Happy say didn't happen   Between Blaze other standard Pieology would say preferred crust bad boy pizza     Overall Pieology still rocks better BBQ chicken but very close second here     Where location probably takes over service  Fast friendly very clean   decor relaxing modern   When pay your food should good experience   If pick right now I'd pick Blaze     Thanks whole team making Father's Day lunch fast yummy  <EOR> This place some best pizza variety different toppings use doesnt take them very long bake it! <EOR> This second time eating blaze pizza  pizza seriously good best had  crust thin flavors pack such punch your mouth salivate every time think blaze  staff very friendly facility clean would perfect any occasion  Almost reminds chipotle but pizza rather burritos  Would highly recommend anyone never eaten before try out! <EOR> I love blaze pizza all unlimited choices toppings put your pizza  If can't choose base sauce want ask half half  kale quinoa cranberry salad delicious well  But if coming Blaze Pizza getting damn pizza  sure try lemonades frescas!
