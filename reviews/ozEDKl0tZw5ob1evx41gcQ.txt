Highly recommend Mac cheese added ghost pepper cheese broccoli salad    only issue place vocalist band playing patio Tuesday October 14th not sure if every Tuesday night thing off performance     vocals bad actually enjoyed band   attire simply something seen establishments such Sapphire's which think great such places just family restaurant  <EOR> The Draft House very likable  kind bar hang while  During day barn open which separate restaurant area especially good those w kids   Food served day night though if you're during late night hours you'll receive much smaller menu  staff exceptional  haven't staff issue yet  They're friendly barn they're friendly around bar area  graveyard bartender Ty especially cool guy  seen running around crazy when slammed he still manages keep going dry even when we're sitting table away bar   grave Chef also pretty cool  brew own beer large board showing current offerings    They certain regular brews well seasonal ones appear time time  tell front actually hate beer  truly fond it  bit jealous beer drinkers really  just walk into place order drink nice easy like  mixed drink all depends bartender's skills wine well most places only stock cheapest crap plus seems pretentious sometimes try ordering wine some establishments   yeah jealous  say though drink beer pretty good  best regular brew certainly Red Hydrant  down pretty easy works w most any food there  Black Lab Stout's pretty good not good Guinness but pretty good well w some hot chicken fingers  Several friends quite fond Leglifter Light  bit light personally but didn't taste bad  seasonal brews favorites probably Raspberry Wheat Cherry Wit  run little quickly though if see them board try them then  No putting off until next visit they'll disappear you  Rebel Red another good seasonal one  always worth check board  actually list beer pairing options menu  On food mostly good    Garlic fries smothered garlic chunks you'll smell them days cheddar cheese curds w both horseradish ranch sauces sweet potato fries chicken fingers all great stuff  Grandma's Pot Roast Melt very good muenster cheese horseradish sauce w au jus! Salads huge quite tasty    Southwest Melt tasty turkey pepper jack affair w avocado more below    Wisconsin Steak Brat a ribeye brat mozzarella bun pretty good though brat little bit salty me  Fish chips decent  Burgers great discovered especially sauteed spinach there  turns into great garlicky gooey mess but now discovered always it  Phillys good  especially Southwest Philly w poblano pepper jack avocado below! Breakfast foods tasty well    The other side things consistency issues sometimes particularly between day night shifts  Apparently daytime chefs likes little chinzy things  You'll order philly comes w perfectly respectable amount meat nighttime might only 2 3 during day  avocado prime example this  Ordering late night menu Southwest Philly come w 2 kinda thin slices avocado each half sandwich  overkill they're robbing boss something but bun coverage  proper amt when see sandwich  Now order during daytime just might only paper thin slice per half  once ordered avocado burger during day  extra buck so  When came thinnest slices avocado ever seen only mind big ol' burger  really? paid extra buck this?   Other less pleasing things walleye broiled w citrus glaze once seriously bland  might try other ways serve sometime  grilled chicken sandwich twice once during day once night  Both times dry burnt dunno what's w one  Fillet Sliders Malibu Turkey Wrap just ok  only salad option late night menu I think Southwestern Steak just ok  late night menu some seriously good food but if want something lighter  I'd see another option two added when don't really want fried food lots meat which does happen sometimes    So place gains 4 primarily service atmosphere beer selection  Most food good  Much great  Now if they'd just fix consistency issues give some damn avocado during day when order could consider bumping them some more  <EOR> I come Draft House thing   beer   Yes some tasty food into second but beer king   don't know other beers though only ever in house made ones   IPA best ever while Guinness boy core stout almost stray   Red Hydrant Ale also very good I'd say par any good ale there   Now if could Cider I'd very happy  Food food okay but best   Cheese Curds I'd say best option   You'd think Wisconsin bar things Nachos would just dripping cheese but you'd wrong   garlic fried just regular fried epic crap ton raw chopped garlic top good    All all I'd come back and do! I'd definitely tell anyone looking good small brand locally brewed beer check place out  <EOR> First timer Big Dogs   and probably last timer   don't think back    Big Dog's last night packed bar Monday night football high hopes good food service restaurant   beer appetizer  Ordered cheese curds appetizer  okay seemed might sat quite while kitchen before being delivered table    never dinner  waiting long over hour dinner asked check paid left   waitress apologized stating experiencing troubles over new menu    UPDATE manager contacted apology experience invited return Big Dog's another try   Everyone deserves second chance   take them real soon update  <EOR> We visiting Las Vegas Orlando FL wanted experience off strip well try some local craft beer  place 15 miles north strip really difficult locate  party 5 greeted seated spacious booth  server Debra explained beers detail ordered several Peace Love Hoppiness being favorite  traveling companions well versed craft beer but Debra managed them beverages enjoyed  shared pizza several entree salads food awesome!
