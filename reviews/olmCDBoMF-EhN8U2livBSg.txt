We walked oh gosh smells amazing here! eyes straight case filled cookies  over 20 different cookies offered variety seemed endless! But before could any further take few steps back pull number  number system sure pull right when walk because tend busy! clerk finally called number even though really wanted everything opted 1 2 lb  cookies $8 23 which yields 10 20 cookies depending weight obviously   Freed's Bakery also offers 1lb  box cookies $16 45 which yields 20 40 cookies  prices extremely fair considering cookies aren't your usual chocolate chip Snickerdoodle  We're talking gourmet cookies people!  I include descriptions cookies because why not?  Almond Cake Cookie soft almond cake cookie topped marzipan dipped chocolate topped sugared almonds  huge fan marzipan could've gone without one  good but best   Almond Florentine thin almond sugar crisp dipped chocolate  Very sweet crunchy necessarily cookie still delicious!  Chocolate Fudge Thumbprint buttery chocolate walnut cookie filled Freed's homemade fudge icing  Chocolate Fudge Thumbprint least favorite selection  wasn't chocolatey imagined but rather bitter dry bit bland  If want something chocolatey Fudge Cake Cookie   Crystal Butter Cookie delicate cookie rich buttery flavor topped crystal sugar  cookie reminds Danish cookies blue tin appear around Christmastime  know blue tin your nana turns into sewing kit when cookies all gone  classic easily favorite amongst crowd   Fudge Cake Cookie soft chocolate cake cookie topped Freed's homemade fudge icing dipped chocolate  Calling all chocolate lovers! must cookie  definitely favorite hands down! Chocolate chocolate chocolate where could possibly wrong?  Mint Chocolate Wafer Mint buttercream sandwiched between two chocolate chip wafers drizzled chocolate  love anything mint chocolate flavored no brainer  crunchy wafers paired nicely mint buttercream   Nonpareil Butter Cookie delicate cookie rich buttery flavor topped nonpareils  layman's terms cookie covered rainbow sprinkles  What's love people?  Russian Tea Cookie buttery vanilla walnut drop cookie hand coated confectioner's sugar  Oh  My  God  melt in your mouth good! Absolutely heavenly!  Sprinkle Butter Cookie delicate cookie rich buttery flavor topped colorful sprinkles  Exactly rainbow sprinkle cookie but coated sugar crystal sprinkles instead   It's safe say Freed's Bakery satisfied sweet tooth  Perhaps placing online order special event future  Freed's Bakery very well known cakes sure they're nothing short amazing  cakes display beautiful tell crafted pride  Amazing work! come back slice soon!

Good thing walked right when opened    I ended getting small version 7 think strawberry shortcake  Wow delicious  layer upon layer scrumptiousness   Of course deal through Yelp which if check Freed's bakery spend more $6 4 free cookies! Always check deals To cookies sweet but cake delicious  <EOR> We marshmallow flavored pumpkin cake aunt's birthday back October  bit pricey cost $50 but nonetheless best cake ever tasted entire life  aunt also said best part tag cake also edible  <EOR> Nothing special bought mom birthday cake 75 dollars taste Walmart cake   Disappointed   <EOR> I ordered cake daughter 's first birthday beautiful delicious  red velvet cream cheese filling  cake moist sweet  Very lovely cake  Before communicated them via email process very easy fast  Then ordered online just couple days before birthday party just puck store  Very convenient  sure check when store cookies  <EOR> Their products still great but lacking customer service now  staff didn't smile didn't seem very welcoming maybe pre mother's day chaos? <EOR> Always good despite being packed last visit prompt courteous  Yes pricey but can't compare grocery store cakes plethora yumminess awaits when walk through door  <EOR> All good things read bakery true   We going town celebrate milestone birthday called them advance order cake over phone   incredibly helpful designing cake very patient many questions changes   They obviously great local reputation because when told concierge needed them store cake prior event found Freed's said could guarantee would still chuckles    The cake design came even better expected taste vanilla strawberry cream center fantastic cupcakes red velvet amazing best tried   When pick cake staff incredibly helpful boxed cake securely no easy feat since alot decorations top   Sadly also try some baked which all described awesome brownies black cake cookies   Don't forget your Yelp check special free cookies  <EOR> The staff extremely helpful evidently creative bunch! helped truly customize cake exactly liking came wonderful!!   I ordered over phone Beware prepaying card over phone   charge $5 fee which completely avoidable if just pay when pick cake    It came wonderful  sent picture used main design created theme off it  received compliments all those tasted it! <EOR> Well     unfortunately visit BIG DISAPPOINTMENT   ordered 2 Napoleon's 2 Parisian Brownies     for almost $20 00!  Napoleon's absolutely horrible   suppose flakey crispy layers pastry dough   were brown burnt hard bitter thick layers some kind dough  appeared old even edible   Nothing Old Freed's used Trop   eating Napoleon's all life    and never bad   brownie ok    but used either   tasted came freezer freezer burnt tasting   sure what's going bakers Eastern location    but clearly something is!  never bakery didn't ANY PRICES ANYTHING!  Very very strange   Needless say     I recommending bakery friends bridal shower all   guess good things never last  <EOR> Freed's best bakery town 15 years ago wedding cake plus wife's 40th birthday cake good  <EOR> Don't forget pull your number! newbie's mistake  store usually steady busy willing spend few minutes wait time  Also willing spend most prices calculated inflation decade now  But indulgence does come cheap  Good deals coffee cakes $13 59 Bavarian 7 layer cream cake $7 49 around that  Totally worth it! Staff friendly patient  Willing answer suggest needed  pre ordered cake but must good cake shop looks always busy  bought cakes cooler  Ready don't disappoint  <EOR> Great place! Efficient line best eclairs town! Great variety good making most requests  even challah rugelach holidays  Family loves samples chocolate covered strawberry deals always favorite      guess supply demand allow them expensive  Best bakery side town <EOR> Don't anywhere else!

About month before wedding own cake stand cake topper   wife calls Freed's gets Jayme    again   First she starts off saying don't order file which did   Then she starts giving attitude using own cake stand instead renting theirs then other crap other stuff   wife ends talking Max he gets done   Thank god only deal lady few times because getting little hand   tell people job but work wedding department worst customer service ever maybe time re evaluate things     So wedding day comes cake which tasted good only thing saved review 1 star   If didn't through someone else every single time things done would easily 5 star review  <EOR> I ordered daughter's graduation cake Freed's  say enjoyed professionalism A 1 customer service start finish  ordered cake via email since live Los Angeles just easier transact way  used website pick cake then all questions answered via email someone named Janie  crafted beautiful delicious cake  arranged pay pick cake right graduation way private reception  cake time flawless exactly ordered it  only thing better way looked way tasted  just back long graduation weekend don't photo share but promise add later  Thank Freed's Bakery stress free simple experience  Additional plus located nice shopping center ample parking  ticket system if when busy no need stress  Just take ticket wait your number  highly recommend bakery  wouldn't anywhere else when Las Vegas  Thank thank you!! <EOR> We stopped Freed's last night while waiting pizza order yes know   really healthy   really surprised see large selection cookies macarons macaroons cake slice was    We took time looking over all selections  many favorites!
