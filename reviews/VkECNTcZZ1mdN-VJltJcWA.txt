Well ordered pad Thai wasn't really   real Thai food before sure if because place Thai Chinese restaurant but don't think coming back again  <EOR> Use overpriced food years until time when delivery  Keep mind would drop average $50 $100 order place  knew name order voice regular  night order usual spend around $70 plus usual tip pick delivery $10  pork larb half purely fat  Nasty! back next day see if could money back refused  told them fat said always she opened container squeezing fatty meat which bs because ordered dish many times them past  included throw away pieces half dish wouln't give money back which think now around $10 give take  woman front whom way clipping finger nails said could something else  didn't want food but friend told just ahead maybe could give someone else but ended throwing away since didn't want take chance someone getting sick  couldn't believe arguing wouldn't give money back especialy since such loyal good paying customer many years  Don't waste your time money here  <EOR> Don't waste your $  Service good but food no where near authentic  Everything extra sour sweet  aware if party 6 more 'surcharge' don't tell until questioned bill  <EOR> Don't even bother dinner  $ 30 00 per couple without alcohol  Very little meat any main dishes group ordered 6 smallish portions unable share  Spicing seems random regardless selection ordering  Dated cluttered dining room seems more appropriate 60's Pizza Joint not good way   None plan returning  Pad Thai left uneaten just very poorly prepared Diabetics Beware really sweeten stuff  <EOR> Came because Pho place next door lifeless   Watched Bama ND BCS game eye flirted single booth across enjoyed AMAZING Pad Thai its jungle like decor   almost asked second order take home next day   The noodles melt in your mouth soft which contrasted nicely fresh bean sprouts shrimp   also sugary chow fun shaped though personally liked effect might alienate purists dislikers msg   Also sure if quick service extends more noodles easy keep pot    also slow night them   Oh if haven't worth knowing exterior isn't very imposing small place strip mall    Will back?  If lived neighborhood I'd probably regular   prices though probably just start using sugar home made pad thai   Maybe it'd fun take date again see if cute single visits     Pro really fast service  literally under time took wash hands  casual atmosphere despite ambitious decor FRESH food crisp bean sprouts shrimp Con Dinners start @ $10 plate Noodles sugary more other Pad Thai had soft  Update second time   green curry great decor better remembered  This place gem worth price if good Thai  <EOR> Why poor reviews? Came girlfriend yesterday all nice  Thanks loved fried rice! <EOR> Let start off saying LOVE thai food! being said strongly believe pad thai easiest most popular dish Thai restaurants  would expect nothing short delicous    least edible matter  pad thai arrived extremly greasy no flavor! no idea cooked long cooked for    but noodles turned into giant plate flour mush glistened oil!

New management must mean new cooks and or recipes    Every time came Vegas business I'd eat take least once  Tonite no exception  However exception tonite last time eating here    Tom Yum Goong soup least 1 4 cup VERY large woody lemon grass pieces  pick all before could eat soup  large quartered tomato soup ?   Filler??  Broth wasn't very clear bit oily  generous amount shrimp  Way way many mushrooms though  Nicely spiced though    The King signature rice dish lacked pineapple chunks cashews  pork nice chicken bit dry  only 2 shrimp dish lacked flavor  rice sticky slightly sweet   anywhere near quality used be    Portions each smaller more expensive recall     When called place pick order wasn't asked if wanted spicy not  asked extra chili sauce just case  Good move part    Sad  place Vegas  I'd even entertain clients occasion if weren't pretentious  <EOR> Food ok Server nice But price VERY HIGH! price up  worth quality food getting  Even groupon  come back  <EOR> Still best place Thai food town  coming 20 years  Don't fooled location shopping center  delicious classic! <EOR> If worked school area King would Thai food without doubt  lunch specials irresistible!  The decor location kind  if dining log cabin adorned beautiful Thai decorations   Now food items impressed chicken satay crispy duck curries  Pad Thai isn't anything memorable  I don't think found very flavorful    It's nice King other locations   <EOR> I really liked place    I lunch special chicken pad thai which came fried rice soup egg roll small salad  wasn't fan soup which described chicken noodle rice vermicelli noodles chicken stock pitiful amount small chicken chunks it very bland but didn't show soup wasn't concerned it  salad pretty good pretty sure dressed some sort sweet chili sauce vinaigrette which perfect because used leftover dressing bottom bowl salad dip egg roll  fried rice typical pretty tasty bland fried rice kind way seriously really enjoyed it   pad thai although good mom pretty darn good  chicken wasn't over done dry which good sign didn't ask any lime which unheard of    Chao Thai down street think lunch specials might taste touch better at least say pad thai customer service severely lacking  I'd rather spend money here  <EOR> We always enjoy mom Pop friendly Thai restaurant whenever visit Las Vegas  going several years  back again recently once again everything outstanding  kids love Thai fried rice but couldn't enough green curry   Here's tip order mango juice  freshly made site real mangoes  concentrate  absolutely delicious  <EOR> I never eat again   Food wasn't all great  Ordered 4 meals   2 meals where still cold just taken refrig warmed up  Asked if could something else   told no food prepared especially us  clearly came microwave then table  service horrible  No customer service  Maybe better off going Lakes King I  Different owners probably better customer service better cooked food! <EOR> Stopped today pleasantly surprised!

Items ordered Thai spring rolls Glass noodle salad chicken shrimp Ginger seafood dish Pad Woon Sen chicken Yellow Curry substituted yellow curry sauce green curry sauce Dishes run bit spicy found but am wuss  <EOR> Prices seem $2 more any other Thai place but if food matches then overlooked most part  Wandered dinner 9pm very nice looking employee steered towards Singapore Noodles substituted chicken BBQ Pork  dish acquired taste because yellow curry effective  shrimp chicken dish both above average shrimp stealing show  curry flavor wasn't strong some other places which good thing overall dish pretty good rendition standard better meat  would better under $10 which most places especially around UNLV should charging  Probably worth another visit though  <EOR> Amazing food guys must go!
