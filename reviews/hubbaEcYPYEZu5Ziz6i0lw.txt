Mantra Masala's food generally OK perhaps quite tasty some favourites but terms value going downhill fast point even proximity home call back  <EOR> I few weaknesses Indian Food such am gauging place those weaknesses have   are Naan Bread Curry Chutney   I found myself ordering Chicken Curry during visit   Naan came automatically but tiny bit soggy just warm   naan fresh HOT!

I may back only because very close food decent  <EOR> Oh boy  rare bad review  Let state clearly tried give place benefit doubt  first thought Maybe because insert any day week but Monday maybe because alone date colleagues   half dozen benefits doubt   No more! never going back   No cocktails no beer only wine  Lunch Specials advertised but apparently no lunch buffet  no way could restaurant considered competitive  West End London far! Silicon Valley Washington D C  even desert wasteland Indian Cuisine Southwest Neighborhood Las Vegas  Even field 1 restaurant doesn't rate     Unless live Southwest Neighborhood would never know place exists except listing conglomerators apps app store   probably just well   Service consistently slow though courteous  truly only Indian restaurant west Decatur but would never know it  Ask booth table right next telephone   so listen chirping ringer ring hook entire length your dinner  classic example poorly run restaurant gives Las Vegas restaurants bad name   Why phone ringing off hook? Because everybody 10 mile radius ordering those UHAUL style food delivery places only Indian cuisine restaurant area  food authentic? food fairly priced? wine list good?  think answers questions probably yes but really authentic Indian cuisine ? If read original owner's numerous publicly available print media articles would conclude no more authentic Indian cuisine restaurant   don't think most people frequent customers choose eat because restaurant's value authenticity wine list   and really couldn't care less poor service   think most frequent customers restaurant eat because work nearby Dignity Heath San Martin hospital complex live traffic jam central nearby housing developments  Mountain's Edge Rhodes Ranch both developments notoriously crammed gills more residential units supported surrounding businesses causing huge infrastructure problems    any mega complex apartment villages plague Southwest Neighborhood  restaurant never attract sufficient level tourist traffic because its location no alternative restaurant ethnic specialty within any reasonable amount driving time residents aforementioned housing developments local employers hospital totally accustomed poor quality poor service business always remain    The ambience restaurant holds no value romantic liaison business conversation even large gathering UYE  Only those LOT time hands come night  only retirees families multiple children bother coming night which describes predominant makeup those live neighbourhood     I  doubt anybody but management restaurant Yelpers never chance visit restaurant ever read review  being said offer piece advice  bet can't guess is     Try Lamb Vindaloo  Save room Mango Lassi ? No  simple Bring bottle water your purse when come dinner  Better yet just next door Teriyaki Madness save your money  Why restaurant's ambience poor? telephone ringing constantly starters  Secondly interior design seems designed some computer game The Sims midgets vengeance against tall people  Also second booth cloth thread bare stuffing poking out  booths placed close together little person fit into them without feeling table poking stomach am far certainly candidate weight loss! mantra should if time lean time clean but sadly not  <EOR> This favorite place lunch! lunch prices great food comes quickly  wish tikka masala came more chicken though! Don't even ask substitute anything lesson food costs run restaurant  never dinner  place closed Monday  <EOR> very good! some buffalo wild wings but instead ended having some indian cuisine  Service very good! way chicken curry basmati rice garlic bread right oven    Nice small place  <EOR> I craving Indian food  why chicken curry cauliflower potato both taste same much favor best Indian food ever had     <EOR> Hands down best Indian restaurants town  owner really nice guy gives exceptional service food die for! coming back more  Very impressed! <EOR>
