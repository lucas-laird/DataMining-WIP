Horrible customer service!  sure food wasn't great either    even PF Changs charges $28 plate   Absolutely recommend hole wall   prey your teenage children hike prices  1 star because forced to  <EOR> Our family ordered lots party trays Dragon Wok many togethers   last week however never order Dragon Wok again     We ordered party tray Orange Chicken party tray Crab Rangoon   Simple right?  NOT   When order delivered house receipt correct order printed it   When food inside however tray Crab Rangoon turned tray Pot Stickers   time thought wasn't huge deal but wanted Dragon Wok correct mistake   called immediately within 2 minutes being delivered   Here's where gets bad       The woman spoke Carol insisted eat Pot Stickers place Crab Rangoon would give $3 00 credit the difference price between two    Although might seem reasonable many teenagers house expecting Crab Rangoon   thought your mistake Dragon Wok should fix it   told Carol would prefer Crab Rangoon delivered     After MUCH prodding she agreed but then insisted would pick Pot Stickers take them back   confused already opened container picked surely weren't going sell them again!!  Carol insisted needed Pot Stickers back sure wasn't being dishonest  I should've stopped conversation right did Dragon Wok just call dishonest?!?! told driver could come see Pot Stickers when he brought Crab Rangoon but already contaminated   fact 5 year old niece knowing any better already eaten two!  figured mistake should fix no matter right?!?  WRONG!    The driver arrived tray Crab Rangoon but would come see Pot Stickers   He Carol phone she proceeded yell returning Pot Stickers Or else  tried calmly explain driver could see them she would know wasn't being dishonest but few hungry kids already eaten them   She wasn't going serve them anyone else mistake first place!  She yelled she would charge credit card Crab Rangoon well   told would fraud if she charged credit card without permission   She then yelled she would call police   WHAT?  Over Pot Stickers?    Again point should've kindly said good day hung up   important eventually end same page woman however stayed phone   She called liar told stealing Dragon Wok then here's KICKER told she going lose job over your conscience  said EXCUSE me??  Why would lose your job?  Carol if want speak your boss let them know simple mistake will   no need into bigger deal is  *I willing speak boss vouch her!!*    After she causing SUCH ruckus!
