Sansei Japan sells Americanized Japanese fast food pretty tasty price  First someone usually always standing outside giving samples chicken taste   usually hooks in    Also cook everything order  cook flat top which open customers see worker prepare food  pretty nifty! Everything serve comes to go container which useful if you're planning home right away hours shopping mall  each box usually pile ton food which great when am sulking starvation mall! try your money's worth  small variety items beef chicken  even sushi! Also some sort special always going 4 99 5 99!  Again food's best but all know Meadows just average food court  but hungry never complain! <EOR>
