Bad  plate served small impossible tackle smokey mess without spilling over onto table  Speaking messy food asked napkins threw two wet nap packets table  Hope Guy's other places better! <EOR> My husband decided try place first anniversary last week  husband huge burger fan seemed sensible place go  didn't reservation since still fence all day  Friday night expecting much longer wait quoted 40 minutes accurate   There enough room everybody waiting really annoying  front staff just seemed unhappy there  lead host barely even looked computer while she spoke guests  did observe older couple coming host stand old man very friendly but said lead host no personality eventually seemed old man uncomfortable exchange  really frustrated because when used work service industry would never let guest feel this  did see smile once during 40 minute wait  other hosts seemed friendlier but mostly seemed fake  also saw manager bossing everybody around but helping out  Big pet peeve!!! Managers above your employees  If weren't hard work wouldn't around! We finally sat server very friendly  She very attentive table she few others too  husband likes gulp drinks tends lot work servers tip  night he didn't even need ask refill  once! am kicking myself right now remember name! ordered mojito really good  Husband tried Dragon's Breath Chili Cheese Fries appetizer  waffle fries amazing chili good but nothing special  Motley Que Sandwich husband tried Mac Cheese Bacon Burger  barbeque sandwich phenomenal husband enjoyed burger  However still didn't feel prices justified  better cheaper barbeque same husband burgers  The portions big didn't really table space them but guess made work  really should more mindful but really didn't expect music would loud  husband couldn't normal conversation without having raise voices level past comfort zone  also noticed busser slacking off chatting servers when three dirty tables within five feet him  consider eyesore dirty tables lazy employee   Overall husband okay experience  definitely remember come romantic date night  would great place hang some friends though  Food great server great music way loud comfort bigger wait area more efficient seating during volume managers need leaders bosses friendlier front staff!

She said right off because they're strip although need walk around place into Quad find entrance  prices selections especially burgers seen lower prices various hotels along Strip Las Vegas   The burgers many options burgers along Strip become very picky taste MEAT burger rather just all fancy toppings places putting burgers entice order  Three ordered three different burgers surprisingly meat all three tasted different toppings  actually talked extensively different tastes meat alone burger whole  while burgers overpriced good  Many Las Vegas meat experiences meat okay just no special flavors meat itself  burgers taste came mostly toppings   The fries fries although standard fries come burger mix three waffle curly regular   Drinks both non alcoholic well alcoholic very pricey   Service good   Overall standard Las Vegas establishment pricey themed  Although must say impressed quality taste burger meat  Which why star #4  However probably won't back without BOGO  <EOR> Being fan Tripple D Guy Fieri thought would give Las Vegas restaurant try   BBQ Chicken Wings Tri Tip Dip Sandwich   wings tough if took old leftover wings cooked them again resulting tough tender morsels   Tri Tip didn't much flavor itself but au jus dip good   $14 red wine blend nothing write home about   All all expected food Bounds good but fell flat staff courteous efficient atmosphere fun  <EOR> Mac cheese burger great presentation taste pulled pork sandwich pretzel bun excellent barbecue bourbon sauce  blows away Gordon Ramsay's pub  Nice selection diff fries your plate  Definitely must your visit LV  <EOR> This place freakin amazing!!!!!! ordered bacon Mac cheese burger fried ice cream  burger huge juicy delicious  best burgers ever had!!! quad fries came also amazing  spice fries amaZing didn't really need ketchup any sauces  However Hot sauce did enhance flavor even more  fried ice cream humungous! pretty sure 3 4 people take instead person  covered cornflakes came banana peanut butter strawberry pineapple hot fudge maple syrup  Combine everything together delicious  only reason giving 4 5 because service slow  waiter took forever getting water taking orders  even different waiters filled water bring food  while see other waiter walking around doing things waiter no where seen  <EOR> It's Guy Fieri walked into room LINQ   Suddenly somebody lit hair fire   rapidly burned down fuse   then he exploded   That appears Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen Bar decorated   The staff then found stray pool blood used ink write menu  All while being possessed ghost which summoned watching Diners Drive ins Dives reverse upside down television   What getting at If know anything Guy Fieri you'll know expect   may even enjoy if you're type walk into Hooters TGI Fridays think American Dude Bar Kitch vibe just bit tame   This serviceable restaurant   If find yourself Vegas particular part strip cannot possibly manage walk another 500 feet some place any place better then guess could worse   The fries appetizer good   party ordered both Vegas Fries Truffle Fries   Because Vegas   french fries   When waiter recommended ribs thought sure   Hell yeah   If there's thing Food Network Frosted Tip Chef Chief knows put menu probably ribs   Oh god   Oh god no   No no no no no     Three ordered ribs   dry   overcooked burnt nearly inedible   responsible waiter even seemed understand ribs huge mistake came back check mere minutes delivering them   He didn't ask if everything good   He didn't ask if anything else needed   He straight asked sure want eat those ribs? No thank kind sir   did not   He took them all back different variations burger   burger fine    cooked preferred temperatures   Nothing special especially compared many options may find within Vegas block place   That waiter along good fries decent burger saved review being star   But really ask yourself if other options available why going here? <EOR> I'm big Wing  guy wings some best ever  The service fantastic great food order arrived quickly !

The biggest negative stupid wooden tray plate food served on   think anything wooden kitchen quite unhygienic all heard  chopping boards harbouring bacteria but also line wooden plate paper which eventually softens juice meat ended several mouthfuls goopy paper where stuck food pleasant sensation nor anyone noticing digging mouth!!!!  Overall really enjoyed place would definitely come back if am town again some day  <EOR> Very disappointing  brisket all fat  Mayor Flavortown burger over cooked dry  pretzel bun wasn't fresh  first basket fries cold  replaced them hot fries good  manager server did best try happy  appreciated effort bit avid fan also having enjoyed Pleasanton CA restaurant past meal huge disappointment  won't back  <EOR> This food great staff amazing finished entire plate food all say yummy yummy yummy!!!!!  must when Vegas!!! <EOR> Disappointed price quality food par! looking forward fries extremely hard almost stale! pastrami burger loaded meat bland! hype all but be  <EOR> Having once before excited come back  pool all day boyfriend couple many but he wasn't rude sloppy  He just needed water food  bartender treated joke  No smile joke friendly gesture  You're bartender its YOUR JOB NICE!

Loved atmosphere but music might loud some! <EOR> So assumed place would great because name  Boy did ass myself  good all  best thing place decor  restaurant looks super cool but food fail    We waited 15 mins table  While waiting could see ton food waiting under warming lights which didn't give good vibe start with    We seated kind rushed order  place packed sure waiter didn't rude  He really just being worked death    On food  ordered signature burger looked nothing picture  comes onion ring tasted cooked hours before  burger cold fries old presentation sloppy  food reminded awful Hard Rock experience San Antonio    Overall save your time money try another spot  wasn't worth $38  <EOR> My husband stopped because saw sign drink specials   Once saw drinks menu forgot all drink specials ordered specialty cocktail   I asked bartender if he could watermelon margarita sliced jalepeno it  He thought second offered Kick'd Caddy margarita said he could add watermelon juice  extremely happy found place because lot places don't watermelon   BEST MARGARITA EVER HAD! can't wait back again another one! <EOR> Delicious wings but felt cheated  Half wings chopped off sake representation <EOR> The prices seemed higher Gordon Ramsey's burger joint! food good!

Loved wings burger Mac cheese sent shivers down spine   Great lemon drop martini well basil! <EOR> Somehow expecting more famous name fairly high prices   Ordered basic burger along signature Mac n cheese burger  Also ordered plate truffle fries   All food tasted good don't wrong  But GREAT? would way come back?

Still sandwich really good  assorted fries hard side seasoning little much  came whole dill pickle  Mine seemed already bite it  Hmmmm    ? One last note     Most takeout packaging nice  think buy cheapest cutlery kit buy      White medium weight polypropylene  Thin ply napkin included  cheapest buy  spend lot nice bag little takeout boxes portion cups skimp big time cutlery kit  Net net = pretty good  Liked last meals Burro Boracho Rio Laughlin Vegas Bakersfield better  <EOR> It's located LINQ hotel but connected outside  We ordered brisket trashcan nachos bacon mac cheese burger  nachos bomb! Worth $20 bucks  brisket nachos meat barbecue sauce type flavor good portion huuuge    The burger however definitely worth $20 bucks  well warned many reviews but just try it   right! worth it  Hahah   save your money! <EOR> Went Guy Fieri's last night last meal Vegas before flying home morning  triple t truffle fries delicious  came truffle dipping sauce also served wing sauce dipping  big plate fed 4  almost ordered seconds accompany Mac cheese burgers but pleased assorted fries came meal  split 2 burgers half able fill four well  only thing little disappointed particular burger didn't seem same hardy portion mac cheese friends did hard really taste macaroni it still good though   Also little disappointed told run pepperoni fondue dippers ordered I also heard table behind ordered something behind ran of   guess  happens when try order dinner midnight  <EOR> I would love give place 5 stars because food world delicious!! But forced give three stars because bad service waitress rude boyfriend she only came table twice once take orders second give bill she never came check see if needed refills drinks didn't even name because she short start  She's lucky she even tip all  <EOR> I struggled giving two stars three    breakfast last weekend Thursday morning   atmopshere pretty cool staff attentive    ordered bloody mary few minutes later received biggest bloody mary ever had   really pretty good pound vegetables rim   few people around asked also ordered one   very happily suprised when bill came find only $10    didn't ask price when ordered when arrived thinking myself   Vegas probably $25 drink   Haha   For breakfast ordered chicken fried bacon biscuits gravy    reason two star review   meal gross   chicken fried bacon fried until almost black   burnt   biscuit very big very dense dry   gravy lukewarm lumpy pasty   wasn't very good gravy   tasted flour   added way much flour gravy some reason when cooled down gummed up   If star dish biscuit gravy biscuit gravy better good which not    bacon big disappointment   If going bread deep fry something bacon which sure actually kind tough do then right don't it   would just happy regular bacon good gravy      Some sandwiches saw come other people looked really good maybe just ordered wrong thing    local while before come back Vegas again but probably won't try food next time   would stop bloody mary though eat somewhere else! <EOR> Some friends stopped town few weeks back   all decided goto linq Guy Fieris restaurant where landed   mac cheese burger   5 5 burger mixture fries came waffle crinkle steak    Would definitely visit again  <EOR> Hi feel compelled right review illustrate people right wrong   gf Guy's night signature burgers beers   severely disappointed when burgers came cold very tasty   wrote letter let tell you They delivered   Guy's Executive Chef Tony wrote tell sorry he invited back round burgers drinks   decided give Guy's 2nd chance wow Service awesome Mgr he new offered fireball cherry shots awesome   Next ordered mac cheese burgers awesome say least Atmosphere great Tony Executive Chef came several times see doing Unbelievable!  Vegas local far best experience had!  Highly recommend Guy team top notch   Thank you  <EOR> The food place incredible!!!  However service worst ever seen!  staff slow molasses all look unhappy? <EOR> Ok really wanted lunch indulge some those amazing looking burgers signed off King Food Network  Unfortunately time didn't allow experience flavor trip      so squeezed brunch  Now    as wife reminded me    I made rookie mistake when visited establishment  safest dish instead venturing unusual unknown pallet  said honestly say ordered bacon sausage eggs      with huge biscuit  Quite frankly was      just plain ol' breakfast  No surprises there       not even Vegas sticker price!  LOL!!  Mimosa's real good  look forward coming back try Guy's inspired burger!! <EOR> I really wanted enjoy place but failed many different levels   initial problem long wait approximately 1 1 1 2 hours   Once finally seated environment very loud hectic  hard hear rest if party without yelling back forth  menu very small everything very pricey quality food serving  ordered Mac cheese burger expected lot flavor all mediocre burger some flavorless macaroni top it  wife ordered street tacos $20 brought few tiny tacos didn't compare local taco shop would give 20 them bigger better full flavor same price   Definitely another tourist trap celebrity name many other ones strip   Won't returning sadly but sure many ignore review try waters themselves  <EOR> We two appetizers two sodas bill cost nearly $50   ordered trash nachos   ok although really taste  paying name only   Overpriced  <EOR> We searching good burger place last evening Las Vegas ran across Gus Fieri's place LINQ   what disappointment   I new trouble when server asked if medium well ok   She frowned possibility cooking them medium rare    a must eye premium $20 burger    so settled medium both burgers   ordered Original Mac Cheese burger   Original came medium Mac Cheese well done   burger patty maybe 4oz   where's beef??   definitely more toppings burger patty served warm hot trio fries   flavors ok both but definitely $10 burger best!  Trash Brisket Nachos ordered well definitely better burgers   cheese sauce nachos bit bland but overall fairly tasty   worth second visit definitely poor reflection Gus Fieri opinion   a big disappointment! <EOR> While another trip Vegas Wife knew needed come back  Well missed mark time  did show hungry because assumed would wait  wasn't wait good start except seated some waters delivered runner sat 5 mins before waiter acknowledged us  before waiter seemed lack any personality  Kind vibe bothering him  place busy but plenty runners looked waiters walking around am sure day    The food time also just okay  did come hot  started some chicken wings  tasted good but could warmer  shared mac cheese burger which also could hotter    We let manager know issues time he super cool understand  He totally apologized made some corrections bill   We left full but happy expected since made sure eat visit  <EOR> BBQ wings overly sweet  lot unnecessary garnish didn't enhance overall flavor  fries buffalo sauce bits bleu cheese beyond salty to point being inedible  Which unfortunate because looked really appetizing  Greek salad joke  Mushy tomatoes cold wilted veggies watery hummus    On plus side and only reason give two stars tasty margaritas fast service attentive staff    Worse average bar food esteemed opinion! <EOR> Because tried many recommendations show come try own food! Very unique cool decor  Staff all super friendly  came Sunday afternoon only 10 minute wait  Waiter greeted gave some tips food  decided order onion rings Smash Burger Bacon Mac n Cheese Burger  onion rings lightly breaded highly seasoned  came dipping sauce onions sweet  presentation really cool came hanging board pipe  Smash Burger favorite because most flavor beef perfectly cooked those homemade thin pickles just made even more tasty  husband Bacon Mac N Cheeseburger HUGE! tasted good but little much didn't much flavor  Other definitely must try all die hard Triple D Fans! <EOR> I really wanted place but service terrible go!!

Great way start day! <EOR> It's everything would expect Guy  Outstanding  Huge burgers full innovative flavors sauce combinations  turkey burger back twice order again  won't disappointed  Delicious  If Guy love place  <EOR> First off why listing Guy Fieri?  name restaurant Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen Bar   tried updating name denied   annoying   mean Yelp event here   would think could name right     We stopped late dinner   10 pm limited menu but less busy bad trade off   short line even though restaurant inside mostly empty   Parties 4 less wait line   5 more check hostess   When front asked if wanted sit inside outside bar   didn't preference until hostess told would 15 min wait inside outside could sit bar right away   bar was   Funny though much wait when dozen's empty tables all around     We sat bar cider Guido's Freaky Tiki   ordered Fireball Whiskey Wings Quad Fries Bacon Mac N Cheese Burger   OMG all amazing   good   admit little surprised   wasn't expecting good was   don't chicken wings loved these   burger excellent   Loved fries all dipping sauces   Portions big enough share   Don't people next trying give fries because each ordered Quad Fries way much  <EOR> I can't review food did stay eat! Unfortunately turned off TGI Friday like decor crazy priced menu items  35 00 smoked brisket sandwich? don't mind paying high price great meal but food looked commercial predictable  worth money bar food  <EOR> Guy hits park one! several times now each time great first  burgers always cooked perfection toppings point each variation  truffle fries die for! Unfortunately never tried dessert because entree appetizers such large portions no room  but times skip appetizer dessert  Keep great work Guy family love it! <EOR> Food worth try elsewhere  Burgers overcooked trash nachos literally trash ceaser salad worst dont waste your money hunk old hard bread wings dry small over cooked lacked good sauce  Vegas fries okay winner evening  Cheesecake pretzel salted nightmare  BEWARE TOOK SMALLEST BITE AUTOMATICALLY FILLED DISGUST NO JOKE WORST  IF LOOKING DESTINATION TRY SOMEWHERE ELSE GOOD DINER DRIVE DIVE  <EOR> So if party four less wait outside restaurant if five more inside  don't understand but okay  four waited just 30mins  Sunday lunch    We seated given menu  looked over menu but good idea already wanted order  now we're just sitting waiting thinking over weekend Vegas since just hours away going home  Well time passed passed   okay we're super hungry we're still waiting someone introduce themself us  boyfriend flag down server tell them we're waiting service! top still waited extra three mins someone come by  When guy did he honestly creepy  Plus he just visited another table cuz he carrying trays menus  He asked if wanted anything drink then going but kinda time crunch told ready order then too  food took awhile but worth wait    order Double Barrel BBQ Wings BF ordered Mac Cheese Bacon Burger  friends ordered Fireball Whiskey Wings Sashimi Won tacos  loved wings!!! much flavor came some veggies  Plus top wings onion strings yum! piece burger juicy oily lol  loved fries came it  also Fireball Wing  didn't think spicy good but spice wise no  friends also ordered Triple T Fries later while eating  Those took foreverrrrr come out!!! good though but man   The food AMAZING! service TERRIBLE SLOW! server took checks took 12 mins! Why? saw making drink @ bar another table his  Isn't bartenders job?? Then he took them then did checks! if you're going stuff @ least behind solid wall wasn't even wall block him  could see him!!!   Like seriously!!! server worked @ fancy fancy restaurant where service speed more slow side  wasn't isn't kind place  seated @ 12 55pm  thought going hour 15mins NO! till 2 36pm! know cuz wanted leave Vegas 3pm  still shopping do  annoying way wanted end last meal there  yeah server costed rating star else would 5 star review  <EOR> This place sucks     never come again poor customer service    Manger ass hole just surgery     sitting where 105 no mister nothing   he going wait another 45 min just inside table      Don't come again <EOR> It's Vegas!  attitude everyone strip when something happens there's no other explanation however when comes food name Guy Fieri you'd better come something better  cap off day strip hopefully finish off good note  restaurant sits pretty busy corner linq expect constant traffic noise occasional drunk A hole passes your table belts some crude remark  restaurant dcor very cool opted sit outside but few minutes knew should enjoyed interior especially hot day but thought should just tough all Vegas! initially seated right next railing but since windy asked seated further inward which sparked look hostess if killed kitten  sitting waited 10 minutes before waiter realized sitting even though he passed several times he promptly took drink order since waiting while decided give dinner order well  drinks arrived 10 minutes later beer cold yummy if multiple people your party drink same thing recommend pitcher instead individual drinks might save few bucks  20 minutes later food arrived presentation good but portions disappointing price  Now mind Vegas! prepared pay Vegas prices anything order especially place bearing food network star's name  burgers OK but definitely worth hefty $20 price tag find hearty tasty burgers somewhere else strip cheaper price  Greek salad definitely disappointing four large pieces romaine lettuce small serving mixed vegetables some feta cheese middle definitely didn't warrant $20 price tag either  Then came wings 8 drumettes $16 yes  $2 wing drumette but hey Vegas! both varieties hot wings BBQ wings both sauces tasty but halfway thru wings both couple wings raw middle set those aside ate others  When waiter stopped again told he said tell manager took plates offered kitchen cook couple more declined didn't want take chance point  lost sight waiter again until he came back offered dessert looked each other wondered conversation manager went  declined dessert asked check  check came course no adjustments uncooked wings but thought manager would stop apologize course he never did paid bill left  Now thing understand reviews don't expect any compensation when establishment comes short but expect them try if try give them full credit consider review  appears Guy Fieri's Vegas restaurant riding reputation hinging possibility name excuse any sins staff management may commit but there's long way name fix all that  disappointing see Guy Fieri's restaurant just another pedestrian eatery strip comes short all phases operation would rest assured if Guy sitting table witnessed experience would some vacancies location  hundreds choices strip those other places your primary choice avoid Guy Fieri's your belly wallet thank it  remember all Vegas! <EOR> I looking forward trying Guys food long time finally chance recent Vegas Vacation   Located Linq Hotel Casino Restaurant pretty hip vibe some damn fine looking waitresses  place pretty tightly crammed together if your looking romantic dinner elsewhere but if exciting place good people watching then fits bill The food however hit miss   First off starter Triple T Fries  seriously good long all things mushroom  Crispy thin shoestring fries topped Black White Shaved Truffles Truffled Gouda Cheese served Truffle Dip  portion huge but course finished them all  Next entrees  Turkey Picnic Sandwich entre great perhaps better sandwiches recently  Thick slices moist roasted Turkey topped cranberry relish melted Swiss creamy coleslaw here's kicker    Crunchy BBQ Chips  Its all served between sliced pretzel baguette slathered Guys  signature donkey sauce basically fancy thousand Island dressing    lot stuff stuffed into sandwich but all mixed great together every level flavor showed each bite  Also side sandwich mix fries seasoned BBQ spices  needed more fries but also excellent course finished them   good Sandwich very disappointed wife Simones Smothered Chili Bowl entre   rather large bowl chili arrived table topped melted cheese sour cream scallions big hunk cornbread looked impressive  However once moved cornbread bowl itself barely half full actual chili  Then first bite both agreed better chili local Wendys  Someone took wrong turn Flavortown ended No Spice Nursing home  perhaps blandest bowls Chili recent memory  disappointing end otherwise great meal  least experience would say depending order could walk away very happy very letdown Guy's  would return again but stick sandwich menu  <EOR> Guy Fieri awesome funny guy HUGE personality love shows big fan   While food pretty good felt could lot better considering Guy Fieri's restaurant  Am huge burger guy ordered burger little dry lacked flavor  Bowl chili tasty good heat level   Customer service decent but needs improvement  mainly slow   Decor pretty cool   Hopefully work some issues food service other good place  <EOR> Great food  Quick nice service  Friendly atmosphere  Big portions heavy meals  Could easily share meals here  Good beers tap  Bar sit if preffered  <EOR> Disappointing  typical greasy American food but higher price point just being Strip  <EOR> We're Las Vegas locals eaten many celebrity chef restaurants Strip  opinion bigger TV star worse restaurant  sense Guy Fieri's did disappoint  5 30 p m  Thursday wasn't crowded  Unfortunately half indoor seating direct blinding sunlight  wear sunglasses during dinner blinded  sadly many patrons did wear them  Seriously? acceptable  Then waitress I don't think she ever told name which lucky can't call out disappeared barely order asked several times refill waters  She never even came back take cocktail order told needed few extra minutes order  Oddly she extremely attentive table next us  Even then glasses sat empty forever  food salty over sized portions over priced  $19 pulled pork sandwich   high even Strip prices  Did mention SALTY?

The Mac Cheese Bacon Burger far awesome display just looks but wonderfully seasoned beef fries lived hype  if love mac cheese side share not menu   However recommend getting fried onions side think they're fried in house   couple crisps good bite but mixing them all overpowers mac cheese yumminess    Now disappoints  really underwhelmed Pepperoni Fondue Dippers     hype worthy  dippers simply pepperoni flavored chewy breadsticks wrapped pepperoni advertised some Yelp pics  Booooooooo telling fans when ordering they're getting end night leftovers  drinks meh   few seen pics served water glass without any real presentation umph  Plus no copper tins mules which bit bummer     Fun time visit check off list but way better options if town limited time  <EOR> My name Jaclyn Vegas visited cheesy celebrity chef restaurant  But hey tourist!   I blame Bloody Mary mostly  beautiful full garnishes immediately one   even though eaten shortly before  sausage bacon French fry full harvest pickled vegetables some lettuce fluff all up  actual Bloody wasn't good Hash House spicy peppery but runnier less tomato flavor  preferred  course still happily drank dipped garnishes deep red liquid    The REAL star drinks apps visit Guy talian Fondue Dippers  know  name alone cringe worthy but damn dippers pizza crust pretzel love child then swaddled pepperoni  Briefly crispy then satisfyingly doughy  served Sausage CRACK dip cheese dip literally could enough    Sure cliche but blond guy wears upside down sunglasses neck knows suck hungover millennials middle aged Food Network loyalists Linq pretty drinks obnoxiously named appetizers!

If recommend getting burgers! <EOR> We quick bite before heading Vegas last weekend  place pretty packed but managed seat within 10 min getting there  Our server really nice but extremely slow  drinks 20 minutes ordering food salad burger little over hour  only thing came rather quick check course   Food Greek salad boyfriend mac n cheese burger fries  salad must worst Greek salad ever had  dressing really heavy none vegetables actually cut up  individually cut each vegetable bite size which though rather peculiar presentation  The mac n cheese burger well done instead medium rare boyfriend asked but fries delicious garlic aioli sauce made give place 2 stars instead 1    Drinks both good bloody marys which cool presentation but Bloody Mary mix store bought just terribly mixed    All all place very touristy hence really high prices sub par food service but still lot people because location  definitely never going back next time Vegas  plenty restaurants quality food same lower price  <EOR> Guy's strategy  Take southern food put endless amounts cheese fry it  Then serve cold   Service really good though  Food very good least featured Las Vegas restaurant  would recommend spending your money elsewhere <EOR> Truly fan food service  seated promptly table wobbly moved   no big deal  just took forever acknowledged   mind point restaurant crowded  Maybe somebody missed shift morning?  Ordered version biscuits gravy which essentially chicken fried bacon    texture bacon underneath breading soggy    not appealing    and salt     seasoning dishes but am still parched hours later   And then long wait bill dropped experience even further  would recommend Chayo Linq better food not service equally poor    C'mon Caesar's Entertainment    step up! <EOR> The food great presentation very nice  Overall good place eat strip  <EOR> This such great dining experience   trash nachos   Friendly staff   Good food   Yummy food   If your every Las Vegas your food stops   <EOR> I ate Shrimp Tacos which very good order again  boyfriend ordered Mac Cheese Burger  want huge fan would order again but popular one  might just tastebuds couldn't appreciate burger  next day  back dessert  tried Mexican Churros  honestly pretty disappointed  really hoping best Churros ever  Instead long pieces over fried dough crunchy just fell apart  Next time try something different  Over all love Guy Fieri loved restaurant  Oh    almost forgot!

Needless say struck nerve all us   Despite telling greeter spoke phone weren't prepared us   A member group even took Twitter asking some assistance  nothing   In any case waited probably hour sat waiter shared similar likeness hairstyle Guy seemed rather overwhelmed us   He said he only going repeat fixed menu once we're 17 people LOUD restaurant dude kind knew type experience going based just initial observations    The food OK     Nothing I'd return let's put way being objective   service other hand bad   sure tip included party size think often people tend feel when  case don't put much effort   Things water being refilled dishes being cleared even everything absent   It's gimmicky restaurant   but experience only would return but wouldn't recommend it   There's just many other places eat town wasn't anything made want return  <EOR> Unbelievable!

Something quite right  food doesn't represent name marquee leading believe perhaps just  famous name slapped onto mediocre best restaurant  Disappointing  square ice cubes nice touch though  <EOR> I love Guy Fieri course while Vegas stop fine establishment  lettuce wraps lemon drop martini which fantastic  staff friendly pushy when need them  waiters waitresses outfits little funny looking but  problem just throwing there  Guy needs restaurant CHICAGO!!!! <EOR> OMG!

We came Monday night just wait 15 minutes outdoor table  Service quick waitstaff great  outdoor space decent size covered don't worry sun beating down hot day    Back food LARGE portions! If visiting can't store doggy bag definitely consider splitting  3 split 2 items which perfect amount food  Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps Tatted Turkey Burger  chicken wraps 3 different meals one spring rolls chicken skewers lettuce wraps  chicken skewers pretty good but wasn't blown away lettuce wraps spring rolls  turkey burger other hand best ever had  When friends wanted order turkey burger little disappointed but absolutely loved it  many flavors anything but boring!   This great casual dining spot strip prices pretty reasonable  place when visitors town  <EOR> Increiblemente delicioso!! Las hamburguesas son muy ricas  Muy abundante! Un poco costoso pero lo vale! <EOR> I hopes really good meal ordered pork ribs  love pork ribs  probably worst ribs ever had  only overdone but difficulty telling difference between meat bone  steak knife could cut through charred overdone meat  When told server he came back chef message sometimes meat smoked long overdone  No apology   just way was  Any chef any sort pride work would never send burned meat lame excuse it  hope Guy Fieri would embarrassed meal come kitchen  If stay away ribs  service very good but won't return  <EOR> Let start saying burger super flavorful delicious! If weren't server would gone 4 starts sure! Mac n cheese burger amazing! server acted though inconveniencing every time talked him  <EOR> Here am back Flavatown  am fan Guy's menu but GFLV really didn't live think Guy would expect restaurant which bears name   Upon arrival sat bar tended Mike would consider inept best else just plain rude  way start lackluster visit    Caesars emailed coupon free beer which tried redeem  Even though codes terms clearly Mike no clue made wait over 15 minutes before finally told just charge beer sick waiting   Next ordered 68 Cajun sandwich  enjoyed other locations know expect  Mike then demanded open tab  indicated would all wanted but Mike refused allow just pay ordered  He claimed policy  admittedly snarked back but begrudgingly capitulated  would just annoyed if wasn't fact attractive young lady sat next ordered he gave option opening tab not     Next came sandwich  heartbroken  68 chicken andouille sandwich onions peppers celery butter hot sauce served along melange fries  Said fries tasted lukewarm if sitting under heatlamp while  hoagie roll would cut half due being rubbery  celery cut long way making hard chew through  instead buttery sauce sandwich filled straight hot sauce  perhaps most offensive chicken tasted if frozen advance microwaved rubbery tasteless   I high hopes Guy's college hometown joint but totally disappointed  advice White Castle across street sure use frozen patties but least know expect  <EOR> I love Guy Fieri but $18 burger? better sure comes hot juicy those prices!

The food bit pricey found especially restaurant bar type ambient but expected strip you're also paying big name owner chef    Nevertheless if Vegas need check place out! <EOR> Best nachos ever entire life  service great friendly  only disappointment mac cheese hamburger  party overcooked burnt no sauce burger barely any mac cheese  Guy Fieri's restaurant expected more  back nachos  Everything else really disappointing  <EOR> I didn't want believe reviews but they're mostly true place average best  pepperoni cheese fondue sticks Asian chicken wraps  Neither memorable worth coming back for  Best part sitting deck people watching  Over priced too  Disappointing thought guy's place would less blan <EOR> The Mac N'cheese burger delicious!! would've liked little more sauce though  Service good  Clean restaurant  Fireball wings good thankfully wasn't spicy  Overall really enjoyed!
