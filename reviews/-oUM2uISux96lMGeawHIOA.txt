And finally food  ordered fried chicken sandwich  Oh boy actually big plate disappointment  could tell microwaved precooked  Even though covered buffalo wing sauce breading looked obviously soggy if sitting around while  Also menu says supposed brioche bun  served plain old wheat bread supermarket  really knew wasn't fresh cooked because when bit into warm  steaming hot normal fried chicken sandwiches  fries only thing good    So underwhelming dining experience came conclusion bar masquerading restaurant  Based enormous somewhat comically fruity drinks desserts target demographic place 20 30 year old girls girls night type thing  If want real food elsewhere  <EOR> I mean say!! am frequent visitor  location used Group Deal Vegas perfect! Unlimited mimosas! <EOR> I only wanted come try huge goblet drink pretty sure going overrated disappointing but instead turned really it! staff very friendly even though waitress incredibly busy she took good care checked frequently  ordered raspberry watermelon mojito  only complain drink became carbonated because dry ice didn't really think worked flavors but just personal preference   also ordered chocolate chocolate chocolate crepe really good but honestly can't wrong chocolate really  Yes price little bit high maybe but fun restaurant lot different types desserts drinks  would come regular dinner rather would just recommend drinks desserts! <EOR> If wasn't GroupOn offer would never visited place  GroupOn $40 worth food $25 long Mon  Fri  around $4 $5 more any day includes Fri Sun GroupOn  arrived town Thursday dinner first night    We seated right away since guess Mon  Thurs  busy night  soon seated regret decision  family look menu talk choices but could barely say word without screaming because music loud!!!!!! guess don't want talk anyone nice conversation over food   The next regret came when saw prices menu  $40 GroupOn order $20 rainbow sliders 5 tiny pieces comes $4 each where two bites each it  also order $19 shake which came bonus tiny slider   I going check Yelp 50 percent off smoking goblet but told cannot combine GroupOn  Lucky break realized later since would rather spend money elsewhere    The worst part being seated next elevator where all night long scantily dressed women brought wait staff  must free ticket there  There's much space between elevator table bit distracting  elevator also close another room where wait staff keeps going out  must felt seated next restroom    This place just hyped Kardashian family other celebrities  Vegas least once year definitely those time visit only  <EOR> I excited come check out  finally able come dine friend  First thought use Groupon but then say can't use bec 4 people able use it  wasn't able use  bummer     Then checked store   Ok difference between store compared other candy stores ?

Sugar Factory must try if you're Vegas!!! <EOR> It's right par Vegas experience but food drinks average overpriced opinion  goblet drinks impressive but pricey upwards $40!   The atmosphere bougie ornate but also somehow really superficial large chandeliers bold dramatic decor classic finishes it's beautiful space  Then there's copious tvs photos celebs brand whoring your face along loud music    Service good  Fast attentive but mid week lunch service can't speak weekend dinner service might look like    I could see maybe returning huge over top sundaes desserts fondues special occasion but definitely won't making way into regular rotation extra overpriced drinks mediocre food  <EOR> Omg where begin!!!!! While visiting vegas past weekend decided stop check place out  seems pretty popular well known  ambiance upbeat diner feel  ordered some sliders start took forever them come knew sitting food line because almost cold ice when received them!  Before putting order sliders requested sliders would light salt server then says SHE DOESN'T FOOD complete shock hearing such rude comment frustrated  working industry years would never say snarky guest obviously your job tell kitchen requests essentially server does? Anyway ordered country fried chicken nightmare chicken greasy burnt!

I visited family during annual Las Vegas trip fun experience  quite honest food little bit let down  opinion place overly hyped which lead high expectations food   They really interesting desserts drinks but food tastes mediocre  wouldn't claim best ever tasted but wasn't horrible   I'd definitely recommend Sugar Factory if you're looking fun night wanting try something new! Take lots pictures because food especially milkshakes picture worthy but don't overestimate quality food  <EOR> The kids loved milkshakes  much twice  chocolate martini delicious course doesn't love smoking goblets  food mediocre best worth money  friend average grilled cheese  didn't omelette because waited long server 4 02 stopped serving eggs  just example awful service  first time drinks dessert service wasn't bad although took 20 minutes extra spoon another 20 check  second time took 30 minutes seated even though nobody waiting  Then 20 minutes server take order then 40 minutes order arrive  ask different waiter food  made sure ask check when food came  course charged omelette wasn't allowed order  took off obviously but just another example horrible service  place desperately needs good manager better trained staff especially prices charge! <EOR> I Monday evening friend  wanted drinks something eat since job pretty stressful  Wanting stay close strip decided trying Sugar Factory since neither since opened location but when still Paris   We reservation 6pm but arrived 15 minutes early  greeted right away sat promptly  host very nice  The decor restaurant cute French bistro like  love black white red color scheme   The menu pretty large tons drink food options  took little while decide wanted server very patient  We ended getting mac cheese pops 2 Caesar salads split 3 goblet drinks 2 lollipop ones Gummi one   goblets yummy cute just remembered  little over 3 hours staff cool it  friend said would finish drink head soon but manager said no stay enjoy long want  really nice!

If someone orders ice cream always safe assume he she wants spoon!! felt condescending! all cookie very dry ice cream good but cookie kind ruined whole dessert    When ready leave waved credit card air when saw Chaz waking attention because he managed avoid eye contact long earlier evening  Chaz noticed hadn't eaten much dessert asked if subpar  told cookie pretty dry tough he said he would let manager know but told worry because tired just wanted go  He just stood he didn't know then he ran bill  No apology food wait no thanking coming nothing he just gave bill watched tip left  gave 20% even though he did deserve just because felt awkward watching!   I appreciated manager stepping fill waters food when waiter no where found he wonderful  Unfortunately due quality dessert terrible service won't back  Next time just grab ice cream cone because ice cream did look pretty delicious walked past way out! <EOR> Brunch wasn't great hoping  Although photos look appetizing food lacking flavor service could better   We ordered steak eggs also apple pie waffle  all looked good then took first bites  steak under seasoned potatoes bland  waffle actually really good  Crispy sugary   Our server didn't check often orders came wrong  restaurant practically empty wasn't even excuse    think place should stick sugary items leave savory stuff professionals  Totally over rated place  Skip it! <EOR> Brenda server great very sweet  She made experience  But if your alcohol mediocre candy shop  ice cream nothing special but presentation amazing <EOR> Decided visit Sugar store since just wanted take ice cream hard choose ice cream wants since usually want them all  decided wish shake bar add shot vodka too! shake great without vodka but alcohol made much more fun  Always impressed staff professional awesome talk with  <EOR> After 4 5 hour drive back Grand Canyon little hungry but much given hiking sun certainly sapped resolve        I've dreaming Bacon Cheeseburger shake since first saw photos few weeks ago chance since don't eat late already 10 00 pm time dumped car   Sugar Factory open until 12 00 am ran over fast could     They set shop newer Fashion Mall lower level ever since Serendipity left coveted Caesars storefront other HEXX no place screamed Vegas north end strip   interior fusion between Willy Wonka + Moulin Rouge + Steampunk which means enjoy sitting while music pounds away background   Sugar Factory takes everything know American classics such sandwiches burgers milkshakes drinks optimizes them   when say optimize really mean bigger brighter   For example drinks but instead typical cup drinks come goblets   goblets need hold two hand cupped around mind you   no small drinks here   vibrant colors induce rather repel   table next ordered drinks liquid nitrogen dramatic effect   In case ordered Bacon Cheeseburger strawberry milkshake Caesar Salad because exactly craving   Others party ordered Turkey Avo Club sandwich others ordered just drinks wings   milkshake everything expecting more   mini burger even good but strawberry milkshake typical milkshake fancy world   Caesar salad fresh crisp exactly wanted spending day sun exploring   heavy   The Turkey Club looked good but seemed little dry   IE  wasn't enough avocado same tomato lettuce   usually use seeing stuffed sandwiches but lacked filler looked bit airy   Overall however friend enjoyed sandwich french fries lightly seasoned shoestring kind   kept nibbling throughout course evening   Bear mind later hours day hotspot caters lot groups celebrating birthdays wouldn't recommend bringing your little kids around 10 11 pm hours   music awesome dance but NSfK Not Suitable Kids    staff person very attentive checked various intervals which appreciated   Overall great experience back quick bite dessert late hours day when everything closing  <EOR> I say little pricey but luckily found yelp 50% off $40 drink   Staff all friendly food really delicious colorful never bright colored cheeseburgers before life    Jason server super friendly guy director operations JOHN way way cool  <EOR> Atmosphere trendy food very poor  Fettuccine Alfredo sauce must've came straight jar ordered angus filet medium rare came dry must've sat under heating lamp while before getting us  promotion if sat outside food 50% off figure Vegas summer heat which tolerable food quality pricing  Wait service food bit excessive  Silvia server very kind apologetic did everything she could first experience better kudos her! <EOR> I just experienced worst customer service ever today  First all birthday made reservation table 15!!!! expecting table ready set which arrived reservation time which 7pm no helped first ??

We came place seeing ad meet greet UFC fighters  ad also said contact them reservations  Naturally assumed meant see fighters would need patron booked reservation showed time  fighters however did not  showed hour late  when did arrive place became circus   There no organization whatsoever  asked waiter if possible meet fighters as dining restaurant purpose he said don't tell anything what's going walked away  When tried closer told line if wanted picture    so why did reservation as ad suggested spend $$$ dining if we're supposed line behind nearly 100 people weren't patrons? Eventually did manage some pictures since process such mess couldn't really stop anyone dining restaurant doing so    But feel really bad people waited hours line most whom waiting 40+ degree weather meet fighters showed hour late + further delays because people assume friends restaurant owners something skip line meet fighters   To matters worse burger cooked properly  ordered medium well but received well done charred  fries great least going them?  While wanted order dessert experience left such poor taste mouth no longer wanted contribute guys definitely avoid them future  <EOR> My kids blast here! waiter Chez amazing he very attentive even couple jokes sleeve kids  came two girlfriends children all agree great place kids adults well most fishbowl drinks made non alcoholic kids awesome music beautiful decor excellent food  desserts die creative!! back more soon maybe without kids next time!! <EOR> Purchased Groupon $25 $40 can used toward food beverages Retail    We purchased * hot wings which excellent  Perfectly seasoned little hotter usually get  * mixed green salad side Sesame ginger dressing * Tomato Basil Bisque served 4 pieces grilled bread topped melted cheese   This came $34  split each dish fulfilled two ask to go box   So still $6 use but did favorite candy which chocolate covered gummy bears getting bag pre made cotton candy   TIP As bonus location gave complimentary cotton candy exclamation big puffs cotton candy  <EOR> Used Groupon  Enjoyed everything place  Everything good  bacon cheeseburger sundae French fries! <EOR> Ariel awesome! rainbow sliders good!
