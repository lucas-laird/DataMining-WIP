Great food stuff very friendly but floor tiles thru place very disgusting should cleaned once every 6 months total turned off come healthy department don't see that? <EOR> I don't appreciate portions feel when pay money want much meat vegetables but purposely give more vegetables then meat don't know reason why going drive away panda express hope could change maybe just location  Don't expect your money's worth unless speak they're still going act can't it  But food great  <EOR> I don't know panda  But every freakin time girggles stomach after    <EOR> Mmm beijing Beef!

Does Panda Express give employees discretion whom ask whom trust?   think should corporate policy somewhere says simply anything over $ ask anything under $ don't bother     think Hai W needs some additional training before he insults all your customers    set foot location again because him  <EOR> Great option when you're mood some asian fast food   place very clean well lit   Service fast efficient   food pretty good never seems 'old'   even hour before closing food still really tasty!  they'll fresh if they've run something   All all great asian fast food really fast!
