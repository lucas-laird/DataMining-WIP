FOOD     oh    really recommend place   AND although crowd now often young annoying crowd love them really starting international nights  Such diverse crowd  always fun when stay dance any night  <EOR> Been going off years now place kinda mixed bag  hookah food always pretty consistant good  service seen better days seems high turnover  Turns into mini club weekends which fun  However underage wannabe douches creat havoc some nights  Just open mindset fun enjoy your hookah food  <EOR> Both dining hookah menus extensive  yet able find labne goat yogurt cheese anywhere else   enjoy hummus babaganouj falafels but most all kabobs  never once overcooked lamb even when inundated Saturday night  standard start night dinner then hookah then dancing Almaza   brought every visitor rave reviews  refreshing change pace exorbitant celebrity chef'ed restaurants Strip without sacrificing ambience service most all quality meal  <EOR> These guys really need few pointers experienced waitresses hospitality staff   For thing appears only 2 waitresses serve restaurant hookah lounge regularly contains more 70 80 people  means you'll your service 30 45 minutes which unacceptable  top it'll take 20 minutes bring beer  It'll take HOUR BEER  Just beer!   It's shame because people come inside pretty hot  smoking HOT hispanic girls    EVERYWHERE  talking cougar aged hispanic women Blue Martini girls young    Foods okay  Hookah pretty shitty because coals put themselves out  flavor tobacco itself almost nonexistent which adds frustration regulars come inside here  met many people 3 days coming share same complaints    And why many cops hanging cars outside? Every hour see two cop cars lurking parking lot waiting pull folks leaving over   feel uneasy     And bunch holes men's room  holes kicked everywhere  <EOR> I ordered lamb kebab which fine  friends ordered beef shwarma a bit unrecognizable unlike traditional shaved but arrived big shred filet kebab inedible completely well done They having happy hour special included free app entree  took three discussions them honor insisted only 1 free app 5 person 5 entree table    Ordered Tanqueray cocktails but Bombay Sapphire arrived  charged more expensive Bombay Sapphire   Really if going keep pulling fast ones your guests please everyone favor close  <EOR> Thursday night salsa night fun  arrived 10pm surprised hear no latin music greeted relatively empty restaurant  But next hour passed could see place filling 12 midnight place packed   What heck?
