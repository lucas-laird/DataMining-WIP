Roscoe's waffles may better but chicken blows them water  don't know prepare seasonings use but seriously perfection  outside really crispy inside juicy  don't care hungry I'd rather wait hours 10 minutes other chicken joints  Lol  <EOR> The food really good stupid cheap ordered 2 chicken gizzards 2 two pieces chicken waffle dinners 1southern catfish fries  all 23 dollars  only complaint gizzards little over cooked but everything seasoned perfectly  Now place looks crap side but grade would back  <EOR> So starters shocked walking into restaurant seeing running it  Second food isn't made until pay your order prepared wait  Lastly food OK  ordered 2 pieces chicken waffle  chicken really good  waffle plain  Overall cheap tasty  <EOR> Me wifey always drove place finally decided check way home  Every time drove always said same thing  Sunny's Chicken Fish? Sounds good but place looks kind shady   Well folks let first tell shady all  stopped around 6 30 dinner never felt any safer  really shady place   Now important stuff   All gotta say Fried Catfish plus Chicken n Waffles no matter what    The Catfish $5 99 two options  Southern which basically cajun Beer Battered  Both very good   cajun style cornmeal pepper spice while beer battered option gives crispy coating good flavor  Comes fries which also decent  love both options because when bite into taste flavor catfish tell freshly seasoned battered right before getting dumped fryer  freshness fish evident every bite  know some places might sandy bottom ocean taste but its non existent   The Chicken n Waffles $3 99   OMG  dont know exactly coats chicken but damn could eat itself  While savoring almost forgot waffle came it  end meal didnt matter dipping syrup all tasted good put together  Oh also some hot sauce just case syrup your thing if its simply enough   As comments place being attractive compare nice quiet nerd type librarian glasses hair tied up  Once know them open actually very attractive rich personality  know say  always quiet ones surprise you    Some random info  take cards  There's no bathroom  least nice sink wash your hands done licking your fingers all flavor   So closing always open mind trying things first time especially when something seems sketchy  place diamond rough hole wall etc  Whatever cliche want fits  back lots other people  matter fact ordered more food take home family loved it!

Lolbs    say because tried several times come but closed whenever I'd think them don't answer phones when called expedite service  hopped car drove over alone  Coming North Las Vegas down Lamb side town drastic change environment  Chicago people let describe coming Oak Brook worst Chicago project ever  saw drug transactions several prostitutes w ass hanging dresses  very LIT environment   hood never above hood but just aware!  The environment clearly doesn't deter patrons 130ish place still jumping new old customers  browsed menu decided 20pc wing lemon pepper flaming hot 2pc chicken snack side order gizzards  YES ALL MINE! Hell wanted try all just case never come back lol  20min wait order ready lady shows your order confirm accuracy when looking mine don't see flaming hot wings  don't recall if she rang them hunger pains long ass wait don't inquire grab shit go!   Driving back down Lamb eating omw started w the gizzards  Very fresh hot! didn't seasoning added them  would've preferred none lemon pepper those disgarded quickly  Next hit lemon pepper wings FRIED HARD! Taste very good but should've pulled sooner  saved last 2pc chicken snack which thigh leg last  extra fresh juicy but again seasoning gizzards present  chipotle seasoning  gross me  ate thigh but nothing else  left rest kids didn't eat any it  Lol would return flavored wings only  almost forgot write review which isn't good  Service ok quick nothing major stood out  <EOR> I wanted try somewhere new but also wanted some decent protein ridiculous leg workout  Sunny's Chicken Fish sounded might trick   Located few minutes off 515 perhaps less reputable parts town Sunny's serves lot kinds fried goods might expect part town fried chicken chicken wings six fries 100 per order chicken fingers cheesesteaks fish fries few sides  sides menu however gizzards livers  Definitely typical but definitely reason went   When asked gizzards livers Sunny asked if wanted them mixed together aka order  surprised but very happy especially when saw half and half order still cost $3 29 still huge portion  Both organ meats lightly battered fried salt pepper likely some other pieces lending great crunchy exterior  Inside gizzards delightfully chewy whereas livers squishy very gamy  Don't order livers your own if don't know you're getting into!  My other order chicken waffles  sure if $3 99 right charge since most say $3 59 but won't quibble over few dimes  two pieces any typical fried chicken pieces order  chose dark meat leg thigh   actually thought chicken little less flavor batter side orders but piping hot juicy made to order  Hey it'd better fresh waited least 15 minutes possible explanation later    The waffle soft crunchy all even though dined in  syrup standard stuff extra you'll need it but hot sauce way acidic taste  Overall definitely favorite rendition chicken waffles although certainly reasonable price   Speaking which prices appear mostly if all identical photos taken close when first opened  don't offer burgers anymore  suggest calling ahead as many others observably did minimize wait time   I would try different entrees before going back chicken waffles but still giving Sunny's solid 4 stars because good value do math some portions though because offal anything but awful  <EOR> This pretty straight forward Chicken Waffles place  spent $5 00 two peice chicken waffle meal soda honestly say left satisfied flavor price! Next time back am going try hot wings  <EOR> Honestly am addicted wings wings prices  twenty wings large order fries under 15 00 bucks  lots flavors choose your wings sell battered fish tried yet but sure post <EOR> First time so so experience   haven't tried chicken yet   I southern fried fish order gizzards side coleslaw   I liked slaw fish okay order gizzards lot a square takeaout tray full tasted good but overcooked  Fries came fish just okay  <EOR> Yummy!

I definetley come back  Just tip though    really busy during lunch would want phone your order pick if rush  <EOR> What well  ordered two southern fried fish chicken waffle meal six piece wings  meals besides chicken waffle come fries  wish would taken picture menu board  wasn't complicated  recall sides consisted cole slaw some type baked bean fries chili?? looking paper menus but none   I highly suggest owner just print menu paper tri fold return customers     The fish really good well fried give lot  Hubs daughter liked chicken said well seasoned  saving wings lunch tomorrow  tasted good too  Quite honestly thought food pricing super cheap  paranoia wondered really fish where did them chickens? But mind price point where restaurant located probably suitable neighborhood  four meals $21  could give 25% tip?  This restaurant hole wall  employees attentive friendly food good  <EOR> Hands down best fried chicken ever had  bit wait time but because its made order its definitely worth it  $4 box stuffed fries bun full wing thigh  Great value fantastic chicken  service also very friendly  <EOR> great food reminds few los angeles spots  just answer damn phone sometimes nobody wants order sit crowded ass parking lot food thought lol <EOR> Long wait but its worth it  Wouln't anywhere else but here  cheap dont know whats sauce but am addicted  <EOR> Good people Good food!  Small restaurant   Big taste  Respectably speaking      don't knock until  try it  <EOR> I've place bookmarked minute finally strolled today  ordered chicken waffles gizzards fish  Chicken Waffles gets 5 5! Very good while wall reasonably priced  Everything cooked order fresh piping hot which always appreciate while dining out  food took 15 20 minutes come early Sunday afternoon during holiday weekend  gizzards 4 5   very good seasoning   little tough but $3 29 huge portion  complaining  Fish 2 5  looks good but taste wasn't memorable  little dry type fish unspecified  hope no missing fish pond aquarium!! LOL! Fish dry didn't good flavor  I'd recommend Mario's West Side Market fried fish if you're side town   All all   good experience was  Don't expect whole lot interior if plan eat but you'll pay minimal amount some pretty damned good food!
