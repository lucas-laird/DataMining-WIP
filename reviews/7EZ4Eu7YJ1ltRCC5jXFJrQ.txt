There much variety buffet  If want pay $30 pasta pizza Panda Express Chinese food   wise move  Also advertise seafood section some huge deal   But just fried fried that  shrimp wasn't even peeled    The pulled pork chicken all soggy drenched BBQ sauce  beans canned  hate when salad bars don't let salad you    Overall service horrible too  understand buffets crazy but pretty much neglected call over manager    I am only giving additional star because its simply edible desserts good! Mini donuts ice cream cookies    least didn't mess part up! <EOR> Just dinner midweek Wed   Food ordinary no seafood no shrimps no crab legs  Selection poor lines long probably because hotel guests given free 2 for 1 coupons  few years ago lot better back then  Wouldn't again  <EOR> I come vegas every two months    good value good options   Last buffet next door   and worse customer service options food   People!!! Just say hi helping believe servied well   But overall food fresher service excellent great  <EOR> After having great dinner experience Bacchanal Buffet Caesar's Palace night before hoped breakfast Treasure Island buffet would just great  dismay case  2 stars because really wish more choices available  mostly breakfast food dessert vegetables sushi some variety meat  only fruit available watermelon maybe some oranges  But guess  $17 95   +1 star omelet bar  only food actually pretty decent  quality eggs other ingredients just great would typical breakfast place  didn't much difference just because you're casino buffet  2 stars because wasn't else much really appetizing  wasn't much taste bacon powdered eggs  tried hard enjoy eggs benedict but bread stale   0 stars because service could lot better attention table  Bottomless mimosas good though!  I definitely try somewhere else breakfast next time Vegas  <EOR> I only speak breakfast mini donuts made all worth while  ate $25 worth those alone  All items bakery side delicious  best yogurt parfait Kim ever had  breakfast bakery omelet bar  <EOR> Worst dining ever    food dry bland  Sushi rice horrible  management should really consider redoing whole place shouldn't even called hotel buffet  <EOR> Overpriced $30 person cold bland food Don't waste your money!!  somewhere else!! <EOR> Some guy gave two voucher excited eat buffet   food looked good but eating place wish guy didn't give voucher   worth even half price heck worth eating even if FREE! Unless someone paying eat don't care your food taste worth it     Don't suckered into place   Shame them charging people crap!   Now reading review shame going!  can't say didn't warn you  <EOR> Thank goodness 2 1 voucher staying hotel  Otherwise would pretty upset paying $23 99 measly selections had  mean am even happy paying 1 2 but if im comparing would pay eating sit down restaurant then fine Ill give them that   All saw 2 different salad bars? barely much selections already need 2 different salad bars? mean different types salads would mix making fancy all but really   2 different salad bars?  The kind selections much different your traditional hometown buffet golden corral buffet chains  Ok fine maybe pasta selections made order better but  it  dessert much better either  All saw lot pies small donuts cinnamon sugar powder sugar chocolate maple   ice cream half melted when given me  Thats gross  Only best thing creme brulee which used actual vanilla bean torched sugar fresh top layer nice crispy   Service server came once give drinks that  collected plates quickly but no refills drinks even asked if wanted refill   Unless no other choice wouldn't back  <EOR> Excellent selection food  Food all tastes great! Mac cheese mashed potatoes amazing  dessert buffet also great  Good service  Hotel gave 2 1 coupon definitely worth it! <EOR> 2 1 ok otherwise rip off  gave 2 star because very inexpensive 2 1 coupon  food just average sub par offered strip  <EOR> This good buffet strip  selection wide since wanted eat seafood great place  Very nice staff atmosphere all eat crab legs wouldn't happy that?   Giving 5 start since felt met expectations  Nothing earth shattering but good experience overall  <EOR> three digit zeros plus time tables resulted seven comped buffet brunches  most known buffet strip but definitely better buck deals if paid lesser value   they usual selection however quality atmosphere add plus one  little more updated but overly huge point where staff can't even manage  two tables serviced ease during fairly busy dining hour   dishes surprisingly enjoyable ingredients balance wouldn't sick quickly  generally buffets i'd take bite move quickly next  however actually remember finishing plates here  <EOR> Sad far down pace gone  Worst customer service table picture lots plates sitting edge table untouched over 40 min  No asked if doing ok over hour  Mind just spent over $100 buffet two teenagers myself  love vegas buffets but if you're looking taste selection people clear tables continue eat isn't place  Don't pay $32 95 per person Sadly years making buffet when kids tournaments softball  No more  done  <EOR> Well two stars completely pink chicken husband's plate    Nobody wants food poisoning Vegas  Employees nice   I liked salad creation station amount drink choices   Organic coffee?!

All drink package $12 50! <EOR> So friends randomly came across buffet hotel because starving saw prime rib crab 25 bucks    haha where wrong that?!! anyways  all wanted prime rib mashed potatoes !! sushi wasn't great friends ended just eating top unagi raw fish while putting aside hard rice use  believe macaronie did give stomach ache because little cheesy Chinese food ok tad bit greasy  Yeah can't say much because basically giving them 4 stars prime rib  Oh! crab better expected wasn't salty unlike other buffets tried  good selection desserts cotton candy chocolate puff thingies variety ice cream crembule not sure spell that fruit chocolate tarts lot more! getting excited moment because just wanted indulge myself chocolate sweets  Although T I  isn't well known Bellagio's buffet came actually being pretty satisfied content food there   but  only because prime rib  sure other resorts especially Bellagio awesome buffet recall better selection food  <EOR> Very expensive but vegan options!!! pasta bar chef prepared delicious marinara tomato mushroom spaghetti   Also pizza station made special vegan pizza no cheese all veggie pineapple pizza    ready less 10 minutes fresh   Rainbow sorbet always favorite requested bowl strawberries side all perfect   no complaints   think price might people turn away but if food promo $80 $100 think may worth it  <EOR> This buffet just yuck only things tasted half ok mashed potatoes which very liquidy but enough butter save it lobster ravioli chocolate covered strawberries   really don't recommend wasting time luckily only $24 person during dinner killed time before show but still thoroughly disappointed   Flavors Harrah's which couple hotels down buffet best but *way* better more options   buffet really didn't much displayed everything such unappetizing way no effort all   hadn't eaten all day even some bad stuff should've tasted amazing haha but force myself eat enough satisfied womp womp really can't recall server must mean he she barely because recall every single other server trip   What's more where sitting tables close together hard just really didn't enjoy experience all now know never ever stop there's any other reason TI see Mystere did yea wouldn't way come next time even if coupon!  Le Village Paris hotel best even better Bacchanal Groupon deal seems going indefinitely would same price going I'd invest steer clear here  <EOR> This first Vegas buffet  boyfriend food poisoning buffet  selection small often difficult food because set tradition buffet style  more cafeteria  pasta section chef would whatever ordered  ordered some pasta which ended tasting pan he cooked in  didn't eat more couple bites before completely disgusted  Everything else didn't taste good either  terrible buffet  dessert selection good but don't buffets dessert  star crappy food!!! <EOR> Definitely worth $22 champagne brunch when food meh   way better food same price elsewhere  place some kinda gross eggs also eggs benedict but least omelettes good coffee strong  desserts displayed well but cookie tasted stale  would only convenience drunken stupidity  TI buffet good buffet all might well spend extra bucks cab another hotel buffet food  <EOR> We came weekday lunch because staying TI two for one coupon  glad used coupon but hope no pays full price buffet    While layout fine clean selection minimal  tried just everything but just didn't find anything better meh  Even desserts weren't very tasty  If looking Appleby's experience might disappointed   The pasta station probably best all food even gummy unappetizing    If looking buffet Vegas keep looking! <EOR> Taste golden corral but worse  getting *hits 3  2  1  no really lol   I would recommend place all    quality food good other buffets Vegas  ate right before hopped plane    Great   wont again    Not worth money time curiosity  <EOR> We dinner 940 pm We told restaurant closes 1030 pm  After started take meal told rush grab could literally eat fast last meal   Lights dimmed while eating food trays being removed mad rush folks just spent almost 70 $ worst experience any buffet vegas  Sad state when take yr money literally chase patrons while still eating  <EOR> The only good thing buffet salad besides mediocre best   Mirage buffet worth every penny 32$    Even if TI buffet 10 15$ would still next door pay difference much better    Selection flavor name it  <EOR> Price right $16 00 buffet Sunday  service good food good especially deserts  But big variety food  Otherwise would 4 star  <EOR> Worst buffet ever!! yourself favor eat somewhere else!

Also great dessert area where choose fresh mini doughnuts cotton candy also house made ice cream   The main reason ate because 2 1 buffet pass staying  TI otherwise sure if would eating again  <EOR> Excelente elección si te alojas en el hotel    Y aunque seas de fuera   Cuando te registras en el hotel te dan 2x1 en comida o cena y un precio con bebidas incluidas muy asequible  Ni en España te encuentras un buffet libre con bebidas incluidas por 8 euros   Después aunque sin oferta sale el doble si entras 5 minutos antes de que termine el almuerzo y disfrutas de los dos por menos precio   Con lo que comes no cenas y son 2 comidas en una   Recomendable la repostería y la pasta  <EOR> Not best Vegas buffet ever had  even close    I don't tiny plates each stations absence self serve salad bar  T I  clearly trying present high end buffet smaller plates but ultimately detracts whole purpose buffet getting lots different food all once  least  buffet    Aside presentation buffet food itself very good  prime rib flavorless salad requested spinach salad blah  mac cheese half step Kraft  sushi really killed station selection maybe two three pieces different sushi each plate stuck taking combinations created you   sushi wasn't even very good! Mushy rice bland fish  crab legs shrimp ok tasted pretty fresh    I enjoyed chocolate covered strawberries macaroon dessert  But all all weak buffet visiting again  <EOR> Got free lunch buffet two since promotion while booked hotel  food itself doesn't really stand Vegas being synonyms buffets gets rated little lower end  mean food isn't bad but also isn't good  service provided excellent though  waiter hostess very friendly  would probably say two best things buffet free    I mean doesn't love free meal two dessert pretty good  cotton candy!  So would pay price over $20 per person buffet? Ummm probably but if coupon then say give try  If looking more high quality buffet then would recommend checking Wicked Spoon Cosmo hotel  <EOR> DO eat here!  disgusting!! husband paid $73 supper gone less 10 minutes!

Loved creme brulee NY cheesecake chocolate covered strawberries red valet cupcake  Everything delicious  Wish more room desserts!   Overall buffet okay service average   Plates taken away timely manner staff never came check refilling drinks  Hence probably won't back again if part Mystere deal  <EOR> Their specialties noodle soup but coming just two reasons blueberry donuts cotton candy! Yum  Otherwise rest buffet average  <EOR> 2 5 3 stars  On last day decided try Buffet  Being guests hotel receive 2 for 1 coupon Monday Friday buffet  coupon paid $20 two people however without coupon $18 20 per person breakfast lunch   For being buffet Vegas major hotel resort expecting much more  Yes pretty good selection foods American International but feel didn't extra mile other buffets would   The boy immediately drawn BBQ station had Pulled Pork Cornbread Biscuits Mashed Potatoes Macaroni Cheese BBQ Chicken  Our favorites pulled pork BBQ chicken mashed potatoes cornbread  Both pulled pork chicken great sauces both sweet spicy  mashed potatoes good really fluffy  Cornbread sweet moist happy wasn't dry! macaroni cheese wasn't great maybe type cheese used but came across more macaroni cheese sauce more traditional macaroni cheese    Overall think great option if staying Treasure Island especially during week use coupon  However more high end buffets Strip other delicious options hotel itself just wasn't memorable  <EOR> Good price but food only so   probably won't back   many great places eat Vegas settle  <EOR> For night stay coupon 2 for 1  half price buffet

maybe 5 times over years decent until year  seems remodeled free regular drinks but severely limited food selection  sushi horrible super fishy the bad fishy taste rice hard dry  seafood just clams

bar where pasta choice  Service pretty great  There's just big entree selection other pasta   pulled pork ribs ham mashed potatoes sweet potato couple more things   they might change menu   sure <EOR> Pretty much bad all around considerably worse remember  I've before decided drop again past weekend b c 2 1 coupon room  came dinner maybe thats why everything tasted bad    or maybe its actually bad     Overall selection food pretty limited   The Sushi The rice old  mean no other way say it  fresh rice  If rice home 4 days later unplug rice cooker leave lid all way open 24 hours because dumb then slap piece fish crusty left over rice put fridge 2 hours extra cold then same kind sushi TI  bad   The sea food ok guess  None tasted really fresh all heavily seasoned baked slathered stuff   The crab legs decent   The potatoes tasted sitting quite while   I couldn't bring myself eat dessert afterwards but comments rest table less positive   I'm buffet hater since buffets occasionally but just

Noodle Bar actually passable but pho super dark brown soup tasted watered down soy sauce   Eggs Benedict overly sour hollandaise sauce  *shuddergag*  You're mostly safe dessert arena I wolfed down two creme crème brûlées being let down most savory foods but stay away bitter berries  Other safe options include bacon country fried potatoes breakfast steak    if you're lucky!   The breakfast steak great way test if Lady Luck smiling upon you  Whereas friend's steak pink cold center comes letting meat defrost fully before throwing grill   Mine over cooked texture jerky  Yes  considered myself lucky       Two stars because service actually decent large party also if someone handed free voucher I'd still crème brûlée TLDR wouldn't bring second worst enemy buffet  Worst maybe  second worst  <EOR> It's no wonder they're given away coupons hotel guest eat here  Buy free!

Okay compared other buffet options place isn't best fanciest but pretty damn good bang buck! Sunday night feeling kind disappointed letting town friends pick restaurant dinner  However 24 bucks pretty decent selection food  Absolutely no wait clean pretty good service    My street creds I first into cooking food when college  being rejected numerous girls getting zero action decided time change  needed new makeover boost geeky image  applied cooking position Mediterranean Italian Restaurant near home learned cook all sorts dishes  never became professional chef but continue enjoy love food  9 years later 55 lbs heavier new passion traveling trying different foods around world  <EOR> Overpriced much variety cost  never eat again  would better off going steakhouse pizza joint  <EOR> This buffet disappointment   weekend seafood dinner prices $31 95 per person October 2015   Since staying Treasure Island part resort fees includes 2 1 voucher buffet decided try buffet    We stopped around 6 30pm very long line   Since late lunch figured we'll come back 9pm giving hour before closed   I assumed reason buffet wasn't good came unpopular time which Sunday night less hour before closed   problems when 9 15pm still long line into buffet   Looking inside lot empty available tables  Most them cleaned off too  line fairly quickly but time seated already 9 30pm   They did tell closed 10pm food removed then  seated hostess sat very tiny table  lot other larger cleaned off empty tables  When asked hostess if could just sit another table   she told would stand corner wait another table  less 30 minutes before take food away decided just sit tiny table   When getting food tell lot food sitting quite while  prime rib dry avocado darkened etc  also weren't clearing tables frequently closer 10pm  Afterwards   when 10 30pm told time leave now  time sat down less 1 hour eat  If paid full price place would 1 star review   I would image if came early evening food would better would service although would never pay full price buffet  would give place another try 2 1 voucher but would come better time  <EOR> Ate breakfast  decor nice omelet bar super fast tasty  huge selection but enjoyed all items got  sure why reviews rating low  eat again before trip over 2 1 vouchers choice even sweeter!! <EOR> Food service good   I 2for1 price coupon include beverage    Treasure Island hotel gives some coupons customers stay there   It worth lunch us    Oh! liquids included  If extra charge that    They don't variety foods desert only just American style dishes such turkey rolls bbq seafood at lunch breakfast at brunch time salads etc but quality good tho    *they cotton candy  <EOR> How should say this  guess would exception  time writing place review but rather warning  Please stay away buffet place  food quality taste hm   Let see thought wouldn't any buffet could worst chinese buffet Circus circus buffet  Apparently is  if planning meal avoided all cost  <EOR> Why? Why did give them another chance? Oh right    Because only buffet actually Tix4Tonight dining pass   several buffets list booth but when then pulled list website they did provide actual list only buffet TI   Stupid there  Awful  Simply awful  Hard think possible but even worse two years ago  stay business? <EOR> As any buffet going some hits misses  TI pretty good variety but definitely smaller some other buffets to  Luckily friends 2 free vouchers staying hotel only paid 1 ticket which $33  buffet divided into different classes cuisines around world seafood Asian Italian American dessert good pasta station my friend's lobster ravioli righteous salad station customizable salads fancy topping options Prime rib very juicy tastier ones buffet many tasty desserts including bread pudding mini donuts cakes ice cream delish cream puffs eclairs  The bad limited options overall but especially dessert station seafood bar limited crab legs shrimp over salted from looks menu Asian noodle bar disgrace Asian food  Quick tip stuff your face if you're planning going night wearing skin tight dress high heels  extra food baby really does number especially when inebriated  <EOR> Food variety limited but tastes good D The pastas great  <EOR> The only reason why came because stayed Treasure Island didn't want far  First off price $23 dollar lunch!! Typical buffets nothing special really wanted Prime rib but serve until dinner= <EOR> I always enjoyed Buffet TI first time tried lunch 2006 past Sunday when tried brunch  another reviewer mentioned am also surprised low reviews place  While smaller other buffets therefore offers fewer options selection food dessert solid  really food here  last time particular service stood me  friendliest most attentive service received any other buffet  also loved bottomless champagne offered brunch order mimosas just order champagne mix your own juices you non alcoholic drinks your own   also loved last time aside special order egg omelet station also protein station where create your own bowl them give pre determined ingredients  cannot remember all options protein bowls but list those do salmon chicken quinoa beans edamame spinach boiled egg lettuce field greens etc  boyfriend joined brunch fell love mango lasi bread pudding saying lot because he's Indian high standards lasi drinks he's big fan bread pudding  <EOR> I am sure better food price came because guest hotel two ribs dry pasta mediocre rest just fine <EOR> Had breakfast into lunch buffet past Saturday  11am 1pm   Ehhh its ok  desserts only good highlight  But everything else so   Decent selection mostly standard lunch items  coffee espresso machine    made amazing mocha espresso drink separate cappuccino drink  Both amazing  <EOR> Treasure island buffet Vegas waste money  am actually right right now am taking time write up  First all customer service hard find food fresh pizza burned out  thought would different experience <EOR> Great fruit seafood  Spanish food well  most surprising thing  Asian noodles pho soup here  <EOR> Service spotty some servers nice crazy woman salad bar just rude  Pricey enough selection but decent quality    Don't  large group charge extra  <EOR> Good buffet! bit pricey very much choose lunch time but offer very fresh  Everything very flavorful tons beverages choose very good small dessert selection excellent customer service very nice set very clean  <EOR> This buffet used favorites couple years ago   last week greatly disappointed quality food served   hope turn around but likely recommend return anytime soon  <EOR> Good omelette bar! rest standard  two breakfast buffet $22 which thought solid value strip  some random Korean food line  liked French toast too  <EOR> I before atound 5 years ago must say major improvement before  price place excellent! All dishes tasted really good 5 all satisfied food return again when Vegas  <EOR> this favorite buffet strip   Decor nice tables servers felt high end buffet  Visited dinner  deserts fantastic even gluten free options although those bit dry staff pretty unfriendly server very nice seemed irritated he refill drinks pick food   dessert chef kind elitest but cares food totally made it   Pasta incredible pizza wood fired sushi crab leg options well   wanted visit Caesars Palace but price bit high ended here  Only reason 3 star due staff most looked hated life hated job more  <EOR> This first and far only Las Vegas buffet  Eating buffet list things but very high priority  did end TI?  It all started standing line TIX 4 TONIGHT buy tickets any discounted show we already seen O   While line learned could also buy discounts buffets  $2 bought $4 dollar discount netting $2 savings final cost $12 per person before tax tip $15 tax tip   big deal but good enough reason pick TI over any other buffet option only discount available Friday lunch stopped decision process right many choices 8 people good thing     So it? Well don't really anything compare though later brother did take look Wynn's dinner buffet  All say WOW probably would worth extra $10 per person lunch buffet Wynn   plenty entrees many different cuisines Chinese Japanese BBQ Italian pizza home cooking Mexican fish dishes soups salads sides galore well very large dessert station complete cotton candy mini doughnut making machine    Everything sampled OK  Other pot stickers sushi nothing worth second though did eat everything put plate  few dishes especially pizza bit salty but bad could eaten   Our server did great job keeping beverages full  expecting beverages non alcoholic included but nice surprise   So end OK experience but many other buffets Vegas TI's am likely repeat    One last bit info Parties eight more hit automatic 18% gratuity  <EOR> My hotel stay included buy free meal voucher decided give buffet try   I suggest cut your losses head straight dessert bar  Fruit tarts lemon meringue pie ice cream toppings creme brulee mousse much more crown jewel buffet  shame tucked away corner opposite where all main buffet entrees are     Speaking main buffet entrees found most looking rather unappetizing  barbeque section only section really looked tempting  filled most plate with  Thankfully meat nicely seasoned mashed potatoes baked beans comfy corn bread only slightly dry  mostly filled until stumbled upon dessert bar   The sushi section just looked sad  attempts California Spicy Tuna Rolls display  also salmon sushi very pale pink dry looking slivers fish top  No thank you    Overall pay for  glad didn't pay full price worth it  <EOR> Your typical buffet Vegas nowadays your asian sushi station American Italian pasta station salad bar crazy dessert station  Most food unremarkable but dessert station everything ice cream cookies bread pudding mini donuts bananas fosters cheesecake creme brulee cotton candy  Did miss anything? Service nice except being seated near two large parties wedding group 30+ really large family 14  guess if there's crab legs peel n eat shrimp must seafood night $26 bucks  <EOR> This easily worst buffet while Vegas  also most expensive one  meat tough dry sides looked unappetizing all tasted pretty bad  Indian food section actually tasted good but left mild case food poisoning  desserts actually fairly good which only reason giving 2 stats instead 1 but other buffets better  If you're looking good Vegas buffet experience try Luxor instead  <EOR> Nothing special   needed salt lot food  Pricey offered buffet  favourite probably cotton candy   I think should revamp some upgrading menu  <EOR> **** CRISPY BACON *****  We Wicked Spoon Thursday tried bacon disappointed   We 2 free vouchers free Buffet Buffet Treasure Island   Was bit unwillingly because reviews Yelp But going pass free buffet??
