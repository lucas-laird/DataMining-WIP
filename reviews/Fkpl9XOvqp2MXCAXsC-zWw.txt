The new menu item Jack's?   Chorizo Sausage Breakfast Burrito!   Si senor!   A breakfast burrito fluffy scrambed eggs accented Chorizo spicy sauce grilled onions! wasn't half bad! combo meal hash browns OJ totalled $4 49!   That's less two full spins 1 cent slot machine played 30 ways 10 times value!
