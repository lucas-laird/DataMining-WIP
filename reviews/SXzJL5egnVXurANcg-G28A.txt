If could given NO STARS would done that!! <EOR> The last 3 times little Caesars warm springs Durango gotten extra most bestest pepperoni deep dish  All 3 times all pizzas hardly any cheese them  when say hardly mean literally see pizza dough between pepperonis because there's almost no cheese  Super frustrating considering supposed extra most bestest advertisements show tons cheese  Yes know only $6 but should give advertise  <EOR> Every time there's always plenty hot readys ready lol staff always nice sweet   Pizza always seems fresh   $5 pizza expect  <EOR> This Caesars isn't great when comes customer service   Don't wrong though pizza bomb! However need fix way help customers   Every time boyfriend always doing stuff back front staring computer where take orders   literally face sure see order them finally notice am waiting order taken   employees seem hate being there   just see faces respond just care all   sorry say but every time only because convenient nearest Caesars house   feel employees bad vibes task them help speak take order     One instant came late night coming back class place packed people waiting   didn't even know where line even if line   People just waiting super small waiting area   Again counter sure she saw she took order   She told would take 15 minutes believed her   stood next another lady asked long she waiting she said 45 MINUTES! just acceptable   wow if she still waiting order am definitely going awhile started regretting even getting pizza first place    lady next order left she pretty mad employees since really took long time     After still waiting 30 minutes gone by   girl working took new batch pepperonis put oven   She just started calling numbers way mine   Long story short ask if 1 pepperoni pizza ready she just say oh yeah didn't even say thank sorry long wait   ordered 1 pizza! giving people ordered ordered   don't know system going but just needs change   just come pizza fast possible  don't even expect staff nice manners towards other customers anymore  <EOR> I walked immediately alarmed long line ahead me  scene chaotic overwhelming  approached register place order two large cheese two large pepperoni pizzas  cashier told would take approximately 10 15mins  understood well explained them would just across street Vons would return before then  gone no longer 10 mins most  returned find even longer line two cashiers arguing  complete utter chaos  observed while waiting order     * man walked stole someone else's pizza  * two cashiers leaving front store behind counter talk other associates   * cashier accidentally dropping pizza pizza while giving them each customer   * associate did work day came greet everyone  She walked behind back counter continued talk distract all associates  * manager working associates behind counter  He very quiet gave no direction authority  only figured he manager due uniform  He should front dealing upset customers rather hiding back  * told approximate 10 15 min wait  ultimately waited 45 mins  continue repeat cashier order was  Did mention birthday?   My overall experience absolutely horrendous  would never recommend going back site until management replaced  associates polite reassured order its way  However does excuse work ethic terrible customer service observed other unfortunate guests    The pizza hot fresh promised  worth 45 minute wait struggle endure  <EOR> Only perk location cheap prices  six dollar large Cheese pepperoni pizzas  Great deal if you're trying pizza budget large group    Unfortunately Hot n ready Pizza advertised never hot ready    So if want mediocre pizza going wait 20+ minutes unfriendly service along would highly recommend going location    I haven't another little Caesars while can't feedback other locations but if anything worth paying little extra somewhere else  <EOR> I give place chance avout 3 times year  never any Hot N Ready pizzas always 20 30 minute wait today watched cashier handling cash prepping breasticks no gloves washing hands  Staff also always unfriendly  no idea pass health inspections  <EOR> This location dont even deserve 1 star rating   but gotta press order post this  employees might getting payed less pace getting damn pizzas done really show it  place order talk 3 different people tell yes order hold on    call back 5 min etc   management gotta people job fair some shit lol least better customer service  geez <EOR> Dude time again little ceasars messes everyone's order taking 30 mins hot ready pizza can't even cut pizza save life won't back place garbage manager needs new staff fact need all new staff period  <EOR> Everything place awful  5 years ordering customs pizzas having every single order screwed some way another done going here  <EOR> Just terrible  waited 15 minutes pizza suppose given between 5 7mins that's person register said he couldn't even remember name nor apologize  place needs some serious management! <EOR> Understaffed disorganized   should take half hour pizza   Definitely worth lower price  <EOR> I expect only few things little Caesars  1 pizza hot n ready 2 take money exchange pizza 3 don't argument front customers then awkwardly try conversation try defend actions  only thing did remotely right take money  Oh standing 20 minutes waiting pizza meant take 8 minutes  <EOR> We actually few times where wait 10 15 minutes figured if called would time side town  Thursday night 6 30 knew would dinner rush ahead ordered pepperoni Hot Ready side BBQ wings  said 45 minutes said  perfect since North LV  jammed packed  Now no line indicating ordering picking everyone just stands waiting called forming random  lines! now 7 30 when finally kid behind frazzled rushed he said wings aren't done another 10 minutes mind passed 45 minute call placed  leave when manager different uniform everyone else points direction where everything pilling wings ready  Now if 2 cashiers more employees lines indicate ordering pick ups smoothly  Pizza hot good but wings weren't tasty  probably won't coming during dinner time anymore  <EOR> Lines always long! time just turned around home seeing line  even 2pm  shouldn't long wait time  rating location very accurate  shame  <EOR> Order just cheese pizza crazy bread  Waited 20 minutes asked ordered just pulled pizza bread 15 minutes!

So    SORRY Katheryn your half cheese half pepperoni pizza did order  The management does care training staff  handle money touch food  Everyone seems playing much back talking loud being very unprofessional  Coming met few nice staff members doesn't apply all them  But them nasty ones gotta go!  I've noticed staff always changing much come haven't seen same staff more once   I love pizza but sure there's other locations just good  never coming back one  Save your gas your money find another location save all drama  <EOR> I've few times picking Hot N Ready pizza friends helping around house  never actually ate pizza but usually looks fairly decent  staff definitely needs training customer service just being professional  There's middle aged woman just loud obnoxious  She's friendly but doesn't really understand need tone down your language yelling while front customer  Today she needed change just stood screamed it    When home set pizza friends slices all laughing it  slice 1 4 entire pizza! several tiny thin slivers slices  mess  Although don't expect measurements taken perfect sized slices maybe basic lesson geometry wouldn't hurt  <EOR> I concerned apprehensive stop given all recent poor reviews particular location received but needed grab some pizza quickly took gamble  Friday nights would expected busy long lines but two employees working front precision  Service friendly fast accurate  under 4 minutes  Great job Little Caesars! <EOR> Can't Little Caesars go to take meal kids I  Extramostbestest legit!
