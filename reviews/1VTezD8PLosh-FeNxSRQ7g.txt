Beware paying always sure keep all your receipts otherwise would additional charges never authorized     Needless say never ever ever million years trust any HARD ROCK facilities!!! <EOR> Apparently drastic improvements between time reviews written when dined last night  boyfriend loyal AJ's diners sad see close but anxious try Rare 120 see compared  absolutely stunned great everything was  needed push reservation back hour because staying strip long very happy accommodate us   host hostesses super friendly  waiter named Jonathan he worked AJ's before closed  Jonathan only very knowledgeable menu now versus AJ's menu but gave great recommendations friendly   bottle Seven Deadly Zin's zinfandel boyfriend often home shrimp cocktail crab duo start  Delicious delicious delicious  entrees ordered 6 oz filet he ordered yellowfin tuna split mashed potato trio  best steakhouses Vegas Los Angeles Texas far most amazing filet could remember  tuna equally amazing  mashed potatoes hard screw but lobster mashed absolute best  capped all off mini dessert Key Lime Pie  God would eaten everyday if he liked dessert  die for  bid adeu Chef John door complimented wonderful food  only regret hadn't tried Rare 120 earlier trip because left very next morning  definitely first stop dinner when come back  Thanks!! <EOR> Ate last night  6 12 told would wait until management finished meeting  Finally asking 3 different times hold kept claiming management meeting  Don't know seating group 9  obvious restaurant pretty empty point   The point frustration came when some diners arrived seated  asking again finally decided seat us  Only took 21 minutes seated no reason ever   Obviously little pissed off point but wasn't going let ruin dinner  old AJ's client knew steak going good  wasn't disappointed! steak delicious!  OHH but service needs HELP  think Carl's Jr  better service  When food served waiters no idea where place food  expect most restaurants but place where spend minimum $60 head actually spent $90  also ordered another round Kobe beef meatballs beg them 3 times finally brought it  month being open think most problems should resolved  But looks going take longer  won't back least year see if service issues cleared up  <EOR> Ok girlfriend calls says she free dinner Rare 120 Saturday night  said count in  can't very pleasant sit dinner must scream person next order hear them talk  forced listen super loud 80's music watch movie Flashdance  furniture made cheap plastic coating found very uncomfortable sit on  server sweet but feeling she very new service industry   salad boring felt would great added candied walnuts goat cheese cherry tomatoes  first piece steak rare rubbery spit out  Mash potatoes served platter tasted come box lots butter added  Still trying figure why all other tables roasted potatoes us  found myself staring wall chose decorate empty bottles alcohol  what's point? young lady front desk oblivious surroundings  know trying club atmosphere but really need decide want be  <EOR> Another comp dinner time sober enough remember indeed did eat much  I know expect complimentary dinner right?! eh = We provided salad which oil dressing loving balsamic dressing just oil   rare steak over rice which just okay   Drinks still point service still great   Still looking forward going back actual dinner provide more details but isn't comp tastings supposed entice come back??  Well based theory may return  = <EOR> I frequent Vegas quiete often whenever am Rare 120 those places stop grab bite eat  place does mess around! friends usually share bunch apps grab petite filet mignon  always leave full happy  also amazing Sweet Tea cocktail die for! <EOR> It's shame place great ambiance being Hard Rock its rock music blaring in  really wanted just nothing really worth raving about  food average overpriced is  quite simply expected better    I started Two plus Two heirloom cherry tomato salad mozzarella burrata  tasty but big appetizer plate came 3 massive balls cheese heart attack plate! date ahi hamachi tartare which bland    I King Crab Legs main hubbie combo filet mignon lobster  ordered trio mash creamed spinach side server recommended 2 sides 2 people  He must upselling couldn't even eat between 2 us    The mains better part dinner crab portion massive but really hard eat  served without shellfish fork any other tool meat out  partially cracked but enough use  also ask server wet towel no finger bowl brought table  steak according hubby good  part disturbing amount butter everything made rich eat  potato tasted overwhelmingly butter spinach grease slick both butter sauces served meal    The main reason why Rare 120 2 stars rather 3 service  server unbelievably bad    1 We drinking glasses no doubt expensive bottled water server came topped glasses tap water    2  When said something water he came back new bottle but left glasses still filled tap water mix uh supposed pass back forth between 2 drink bottle?   3  When asked glasses he brought scorching hot glasses  Dude no brainer change them empty table behind you!   4  ask pretty much everything should automatic water new napkins cutlery drinks plate put all seafood shells something clean hands with  server never eaten before no idea people would expect   Can't say ever give place second chance worth hundreds dollars you'll end spending  Steakhouses everywhere Vegas no doubt better there  <EOR> The food good great  But honestly if your restaurant called Rare shouldn't overcooking your steaks 2 6 table     The restaurant apologetic but only comp'ed drink  Also bone in ribeye pretty heavily salt peppered  <EOR> We staying Hard Rock hotel all agreed all mood steak decided give place shot  started off good pretzel bread give beginning great Spicy Ahi Tartare appetizer delicious but then downhill there   My hubby ordered Steak Trio Two asked cooked Medium  came looking quite rare rare fact looked same rare steak friend got  send back 2 times!!! never done before certainly would never expect steakhouse  Meanwhile whole time did see waiter  sure he even existed  ordered bottle wine which halfway through meal    We ordered mac cheese side which wait well  When asked said thought didn't want it  No apology anything just apparently fault  other friend filet Mignon which he said more fat expected cut meat    The good Spicy Ahi Tar tare Mac cheese Best Both Worlds lobster steak friend he said good  Pretzel Bread Trio mashed potato's   The bad Service service service Cooking steak properly important steakhouse We didn't dessert thought might take another 3 hours that  end waiter tried talk but late  Hopefully they'll improve they've great location  <EOR> So first off biased because AJ's favorite Vegas steakhouse years  ate time before but right opening reserved judgment   Got comp 2 last week marathon gambling session  Both ribeye app salad kobe meatballs two sides asparagus cream spinich     Best thing say above    good great  certainly hip vibe fitting rest Hard Rock I'd reccomend if you're already staying Hard Rock expense account comp just craving high end steak don't want leave property    There's really much reason otherwise  <EOR> Have agree some other reviewers there's nothing really special place  husband few months ago reservations recommended  service good very attentive  ordered filet mignon sides mashed potatoes trio mushroom pot pie asparagus creamy spinach  steaks sides good but hubby still believes would off better  If ready spend some $$$  <EOR> My boyfriend ate Sunday night  use restaurant com certificate  surprisingly busy   Ambience The restaurant nicely decorated  liked large chairs arms opposed regular dining chairs  Lighting very dark  did projector near bar area playing movies Weekend Bernie's  Top Gun    Service The hosts waitstaff all friendly  expensive restaurant didn't stuck stuffy feeling   And now food I loved serve pretzel rolls opposed regular bread rolls  butter accompanied them hint mustard compliment pretzels  mustard flavor subtle mustard hating boyfriend didn't mind it   Appetizer Rice Cracker Tuna spicy blood orange lime aioli  It intriguing waiter's suggestion sealed deal  delicious  crispy coating around sliced pieces ahi tuna just right aioli flavor complimented tuna very well   Entree Bone in 18oz ribeye My favorite cut meat  flavorfull  seasoning minimally perfect enough supplement steak but overpower natural flavor   Sides Mashed potato trio lobster truffle rosemary parmesan I love mashed potatoes never tasted mashed potatoes these  lobster batch pieces lobster mixed good lobster flavor  truffle mashed potatoes very strong pungent aroma flavor  bf didn't but felt still pretty tasty  rosemary parmesan less intense flavor but still very delicious  Mac Cheese 4 cheeses smoked bacon sauteed onion I liked use penne pasta noodle flavors good  Just standout macaroni cheese   Cocktails Rita 120 Tequila pomegranate citronage agave lime juice  very tasty mix  Sweet Tea I don't remember exact name but tasted just sweet tea  Mmm   Dessert Molten Chocolate Sundae dulce de leche ice cream The name description very deceiving  clarify waiter described brownie souflee chocolate liquid center  ordered came discovered lava cakes  Luckily exactly type dessert craving but misrepresented   Overall very nice delicious experience  <EOR>
