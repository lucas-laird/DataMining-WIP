If focus dish avocado advertised should decent amount  must really small avocados based came first time  some time manager brought new wrap double all ingredients which didn't request but appreciated said side veggies would soon but forgotten  point guy almost done eating few bites wrap asked box  gave getting vegetables which server brought she brought box because according she asked around veggies no claimed them she figured mine  ended taking home majority food eat home  wrap good but extra ingredients requested manager  guy said food tasted good large portion but chicken more breading meat  star friendly server other star wrap tasting good but only doubling ingredients  avocado wrap fried chicken waffles 2 ice waters glass milk $28 00  Likely won't return  <EOR> Just walking he door hungry smell breakfast  Whether you're dinning alone couple group seating accommodate you  There's counter service booths tables chairs small outdoor seating area  great local spot breakfast brunch lunch dinner  all multiple times never meal did like!

Oh might because cook leaning over chatting server assume manager  When customer sees then gets half ordered !  then when other half finally arrives meanwhile just finished first half because took long 2nd half arrives WHAMO wrong!!  Maybe cook should spend more time cooking less time chatting help! Maybe! I would give zero stars if possible  say afternoon last week first time good fast everything came cooked same time thought would give breakfast shot BIG MISTAKE  does restaurant down fast?

The meal itself sublime delicious diner food made fresh ingredients generous portions  service however where Metro really shines  Though restaurant packed greeted seated fed record time  Even water glasses kept magically full if wonderful friendly diner fairies   We've all restaurants where servers cater only designated sections felt ignored when need help but nobody nearby assigned us  Metro Diner  Every employee passed table stopped ask doing seemed genuinely interested answer   Metro Diner gives employees flexibility take care guests instead following rigid micromanaged procedures  which feel insincere inefficient  When server dropping off food realized made sub home fries instead hash browns she brought replacement under three minutes without having consult server took order approval manager otherwise jump through hoops things right   I don't single complaint  Metro Diner exceeded expectations every way  Bravo! <EOR> This place amazing! portions huge food amazing!!! food cooked perfection!!
