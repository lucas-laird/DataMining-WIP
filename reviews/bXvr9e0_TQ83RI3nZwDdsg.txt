I several times  think food could better Colombian restaurants NY  Specially la bandeja paisa should more food price  service ok <EOR> I keep telling myself give poor place another chance but unfortunately again December 2013 service horrible food usual good all   Whenever any Latinos town Colombians highly recommend place all since want any enemies  If craving Colombian food Los Angeles quite few places authentic deeeelicious! decor horrendous feel cave someplace <EOR> * fair didn't actually stay sample food    I only think handful times actually walked restaurant which intended eat at  Unfortunately them  why My fiance bought deal over year ago restaurants com try place  actually really excited give Columbian food try but whatever reason hadn't gotten around using coupon  finally decided just plan it  looked over menu really looking forward coming here  expecting little hole wall simple but tasty food    And maybe would gotten different day  Unfortunately day two major red flags present    1  When walked handful people sitting front room which basically convenience store front few tables  weren't offered seat room  Rather hostess walked larger back room where lights turned off  She told off because trying cool restaurant down no air conditioning building    We arrived 6 00 pm Wednesday  didn't seem though expecting customers    2  second walked fiance both instantly noticed entire building wreaked sewage  smell could ignored  Sorry but if place going eat smells waste don't confidence your sanitary practices    I've never restaurant smelled immediately left  health department might want drop inspection  <EOR> Unfortunately food Colombian  Staff impatient  much better Colombian food elsewhere  <EOR> We little spot Sahara Decatur quite frequently! Ever since day when wanted saimin Aloha Kitchen but time changed minds wanted something different? remember friends checking Oiga Mira Vea caption pretty eye catching  said YUUUUUUMMMMMM     Yeah  pretty much all need hear see know where going lunch! small inside there's wooden door slides back reveal restaurant night club during late night hours! GENIUS! Also entire staff family which always love! definitely your typical hole in the wall serves some best food kind place! Try Cuban sandwich which marinated pulled pork carnitas soft grilled french style bread smothered white melted cheese pickles little mayonaise   know doesn't sound healthy when write all but hey don't Colombian spot eat healthy  sure! Oh yeah if you're fan oil drenched soggy fries which not then might wanna skip eating them getting them all together    Just stick sandwich! But honestly now all know real gem place empanadas! can't explain feel when bite into beef delicacies? way chicken vegetarian well non red meat people there  Just sure ask extra Aji sauce because darn sauce closest thing eating pure bliss! simple fresh love it! If you're still full then head over glass case where hold baked goods try freshly fried bunuelos!!! Pronounced BOON WELL OHS   I think?  Anyhow they're balls dough mixes different mild cheeses inside then deep fried! very heavy snack but worth try! just all clear this    When making your way Oiga Mira Vea please sure 1  Wear spandex comfort purposes  2  Bring designated driver because might fit behind wheel wards  3  juice diet 3 days prior prepare your body experience you're here!

El servicio terrible la mesera nos recibió y nos sentó pero pasaron 40 minutos y yo tuve que ir llamarla para ordenar   La comida se tardo tanto que mis invitados y yo pensamos que train la comida desde Colombia estoy exagerando obviamente La comida estuvo regular pero se tardaron tanto en servirla que mi pollo estaba frío y el cocinero era el que repartía la comida entre las mesas por que la mesera no se encontraba por ninguna parte!  De seguro que estaba en el baño usando su celular!  El lugar se ve como un restaurante que debería estar en un barrio clandestino    HORRIBLE EXPERIENCIA NUNCA JAMÁS IREMOS AHÍ EN NUESTRAS VIDAS! <EOR> So good! husband slumming Savers when he noticed sign Colombian food  love all food South America but only Columbia food via Florida  Florida's version very heavy plantain sliders  husband both ordered milenasa  He chose green plantain Maduro  food amazing!

Tell Mr  Risotto   sum total answer   No apology no acknowledgement maybe pot chicken rice reheated few times many    Any restaurant problems any dish   gone back over over restaurants which problems mainly because owners genuinely concerned quality food desire customer positive dining experience   other hand why should return place where reaction critique shrug even if enough good things menu warrant second visit?  Karma kounts book  <EOR> I multiple times hoping improvements but service worst  negligent unprofessional imprudent  Sadly waitresses' bad attitude more enough turn away any customer  in your face approach comes off very condescending manner  Colombian great disappointment   El servicio es lo peor  horrible por no decirlo de otra manera  Como Colombiano este lugar es una gran decepción  <EOR> Talk interesting spot  cousin's birthday she loves salsa dancing found place late Saturday night  Walking entrance little confusing  looking dance club looks Mom Pop sandwich shop  cousins made comment felt Speakeasy  He's right on  entrance club part through some doors side guarded guy dark clothing  put quotes around guarded because he checking IDs anything   Anyway dance floor fun  Most aren't much way salsa dancers but all managed good time  only problem time when waitress came over drink orders  wanted something basic gin tonic but she didn't understand asking for  dinging them that just mentioning it  ended just getting Sprites strange coconut flavored sodas  wouldn't mind trying some sort Colombian alchoholic beverage  If only knew was  <EOR> This place great find  great food great prices   bandeja paisa really good  empanadas delicious  <EOR> This ONLY authentic Colombian Restaurant Las Vegas   several times fam friends  place never seems disappoint all   small little section when come where grab quick bite eat jet   also more spacious area where normally Rumba Nights which Fri Sun believe  also sit dine if wish   also liked little market authentic Colombian products   little pricey but worth getting   bought Colombian Coffee grounds which neatly packaged   MEH!  coffee delish!!
