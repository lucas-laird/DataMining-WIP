Second time location horrible  work restaurant industry usually takes lot wrongs think service sucks  Upon arrival more 10 tables entire restaurant sat promptly  4 minutes server Tara even stopping greet asked first person walked happen manager if could server offer drinks  He took drink order she finally rolled right before he delivered drinks  ready order she took order slow took 26 minutes food come out  She asked if needed anything said no but few bites into meal noticed son didn't all condiments came fajita dish waited bit then looked around saw server tending tables server nowhere found  asked other server passing if she could server but instead she offered missing condiments  always server came just little late  finishing meal looking around even slower restaurant fewer tables server nowhere found again  cashier paid bill course leaving came server always minute behind  sure if she doing side work eating taking break just hiding but sad every time looked around restaurant she almost nowhere seen  guess problem if you're slow there's no excuse poor service which exactly felt received   To honest location 3 minutes house but I'd rather drive further Tropicana location better service food  <EOR> Big breakfast portions lunch dinner sizes seemed smaller  Great crew  Table prerty wobbly new open  <EOR> Yummy!!

I also noticed holiday decorations almost non existent   just wasn't festive  Made note self NEVER PLACE AGAIN!! <EOR> Food good but service horrible  I'd say ate 15 minutes but 45 minutes top 30 minute wait did waiting seat due waiting server  order wrong missing 2 drinks top kept giving biscuits thinking would rectify situation  All servers young seemed really care job  first visit expectations weren't met wasn't even high which sucks because really wanted place  <EOR> We pretty good experience location     came weekday morning weren't busy  seated quickly because other locations town knew wanted ordered drinks arriving table  food came pretty quickly tasted good   The only problem had waitress checked early into meal then didn't see quite while  result waters coffees weren't filled ate   As stated other reviews location newly opened still working 'new restaurant' issues    I'm certain we'll back location soon  <EOR> After eating few times place isn't par other locations yesterday most likely last time   wait staff nice but food low quality   ordered hot turkey sandwich   turkey light purple color odd ick nothing hot wasn't appetizing all  wife cheese burger looked old if sitting    nothing good   bottom line Pass location  <EOR> Excellent food service  came close closing but waitress very accommodating didnt rush us  omelets outstanding cooked perfectly  definitely back! <EOR> We really excited trying Black Bear  sat corner booth right next window  No came over even talk 15 minutes seated  When busser noticed sitting he came over asked if questions  began onslaught people we literally 3 different people wait us   course ordered fried chicken  meal lot options soup salad veggies Italian style green beans lots carb options corn muffin  waiter did ask any options past salad  remind other choices  selected Italian green beans mashed potatoes brown gravy  Honey ordered western burger Parmesan chips  When salad lettuce freshly washed but dried ton water plate  Nothing special just greens shredded carrot 2 slices cucumber 2 grape tomatoes  When meals finally came green beans potatoes gravy cold but plate hot according runner  send back food completely inedible  manager graciously took meal off bill considering didn't eat guess  gracious him   I don't know   reason am giving 2 stars over 1 honey liked burger  service wasn't great couldn't try food tho looked ok but never cornbread muffin   If come back might try breakfast but may need work some kinks  <EOR> A really complete menu which choose  Service prompt courteous attentive food service fast  Burger excellent fries meh mom's omelet great w  side fresh fruit   Server very very good if wasn't already retired I'd talked else he'd do     <EOR> Place mess  Tables cleaned off   When entering waited 10 minutes table then people behind just sat down did same  Service terrible even thought going other location cation Tropicana which excellent location   Black Bear needs fix location back  Tropicana location choice <EOR> There something quite off restaurant can't put finger it    review cover hottest day restaurants history  fact     The atmosphere mostly mix beautifully designed theme furniture cute wall chair art zoom away open Midwestern wilderness faster scoop calgon click Ruby slippers   But none could possibly enjoyed fateful day partner decided dine because air thick humid above anything else dismay hoping escape torturous sweltering Las Vegas summer establishment's air gone out   partner some reason decided could still werq    Little did know food restaurant would leave lot desired especially given reputation painted employees when made initial queries dishes   We decided food even if waitress wonderful Tara something    When home expected warm food but worth given cool 74° keep apartment which literally down street     The bacon cheeseburger quite lot look but tasted day old McDonald's lard   plenty fries but even tasteless underseasoned  serving size large extra large but flavor lacking non existent   bad because until ate thought nothing bacon could taste flavorless   sad day   The new York steak dry but still seasoned appropriately which saved trash cans wide hungry mouth   since all food poor steak shoved into little Styrofoam boxes   presentation therefore should be   Acceptable when taking into consideration size serving   asked Brown beef gravy somehow white gravy   But waitress did offer choice 3 gravies   Idk whose fault would be   cooks?  Management? Waitress?  I recommend bear claw almonds   waitress heated pastry which made softer   buttery rich taste complemented bitter decaffeinated coffee well size pastry definitely something write home about   Truly exciting way start end meal I think having no air worst mistake history restaurants even Google if Donald Trump owned chain which dozen locations sprinkled western US he doesnt    If going comfort food would add more flavor   If going home style cooking would add more flavor   If want compete Biscuits cafe Egg Le Belle Terre Blue Ox various lunch options area need step game   order right keep warm hot sure humid sweltering oven inside your establishment   basics think Bob Laurie Manley might need back them     In conclusion atmosphere spot thanks wood workings Ray Schulz sweeping colorful bear mottled murals Steve Gary Fitzgerald   Tara server quaint friendly seems take position lighthearted ambassador comestibles libation   food itself lacking   AIR CONDITIONER WORKING might come back few months   Until then recommend eating here  <EOR> The food amazing here! However 2 star review because service   party 13 when quoted 35 minute wait time   also stated fine  waiting 55 mins no air conditioning leave told girls worked front leaving sat but sat 5 parties 6 more instead   dad asked manger hostess started laughing because apparently funny  spoke manager wasn't very apologetic  He did say now table  took 10 more minutes before seated  Once seated no menus took another 5 minutes them   eaten ton other Black Bear's only Las Vegas  am beyond disappointed may never come back  now gotten food going 1 5 hours waiting   Edit time food 90 degrees almost 2 hrs waiter nice but food wrong couple items  manager did give use 20% off couple pies plus  don't think going back location anytime soon  <EOR> Went breakfast while back food great  Only little problem wasn't enough people working day food beverages delayed  <EOR> The food good but girls particularly ones working Saturday morning 4 25 2017 some serious issues  seated girls places 1 set silverware table where 4 people sitting then walks off  asked 3 times silverware ignored then asked waiter he walked off stupor then upset walk cashier ask silverware girl then grabs big handful silverware drops the  Enter table walks off  probably worst experiences restaurant 45+ years   All girls front almost acting if something half asleep  Management never even reached tried contact discuss complaint don't think anyone cares customer service here  review fir location Sahara Durango  <EOR> We always great time Black Bear Diner!

Maybe would appropriate response  She then walks over table behind pick dirty dishes says something under breath me  turned around said Excuse me?
