Also loved white peach margarita had   For meal shredded chicken tacos which alright but could definitely used more chicken less lettuce  looked small pile lettuce tomatoes top tacos ran meat!  Worth try if you're staying Luxor other adjoining hotels but personally think better Mexican food places Las Vegas  <EOR> The chips DE freaking LICIOUS  I came enchiladas corn but fell love free chips!!

Rice beans good   Good know tacos à la carte $4  Overall came tacos tacos good bad  <EOR> Nothing special here  Food service mediocre WAY overpriced  complimentary chips comes two salsas one red green which both really good  first batch chips perfectly crispy delicious but second batch tasted weird  oil cooked old burnt  ordered mango ginger margarita which $12 super yummy  But $12 would've liked more alcohol it  wasn't strong enough  boyfriend ordered modelo $7 carnitas $20  carnitas crispy cooked perfectly delicious came awesome habanero salsa  habanero salsa comes tiny container if want more charge $2   So why only 3 stars? Because  good ends  bad  ordered Alambre tacos $18  plate comes 3 tacos rice beans  tacos weren't good  sounded would amazing but bacon cheese overpowered any other flavors just didn't taste right  couldn't taste poblano steak all because all could taste cheesy bacon  $18 3 tacos? thinking? rice gross  huge rice fan picky but rice nasty  tasted rice would offered buffet came box  also hard  boyfriend took bite never touched again never leave rice plate but couldn't finish it  black beans tasted came can  tortillas weren't fresh tasted microwaved  If going overpay food better fresh delicious!  The service spotty  flag down people ask refills everything chips salsa water    Our waiter passed table lot saw chips margarita empty never asked if wanted more  wait while refills bill also which pretty annoying when you're just sitting waiting     Overall? worth money  Low quality mediocre americanized food    Pass  <EOR> Is expensive?

The food AMAZING  loved all three ceviches expected tuna best but mahi mahi WOW  two salsas came chips really good some house bottled hot sauces table well husband taste testing  He said tacos outstanding  didn't really expect anything special maybe why pleased flavors but truly delicious meal positively stuffed happy didn't order anything extra off appetizer menu!  The atmosphere nice but open everything else going around sort just middle things  sure when some partying going little wild but very subdued relaxing  Friday afternoon   Our service good good food but waiter responsive when asked more water refilled several times during menu  food came quite quickly chips refilled right away when asked more bill brought timely manner  Restaurant com certificate paid less $20 tax tip couldn't stop talking good food was  Vegas strip restaurant prices decent  highly recommend but Restaurant com first!  Unfortunately they've changed restaurant com certificate though $25 off $50 but still say it!  YUM O  <EOR> Don't waste your time your money  Chipotle fresher better tasting food whole lot less money   Del Taco  Hot Dog Stick matter  restaurant overpriced HUGE disappointment    Chips ok noted previous reviewer salsa meh    pork carnitas tacos plate comes rice refried black beans   Most pork OK but pick decent amount charred crispy fatty bits  Rice totally undercooked no flavor   Black beans ZERO flavor  No joke zip zilch zero flavor  date Alambre taco plate same bland rice beans  He claims tacos ok bad      Our drinks weren't any better  lemon drop margarita date mojito  Neither drink drank completely  Mine sour  undrinkable wondered if made gone bad batch sour mix rookie first shift job night any bartenders know talking    Mojito average    If find yourself staying Luxor your first night Vegas you're starving ready good cocktail HERE  Keep walking  Act don't even see it   Spare yourself frustrations severely sub par meal now renamed Taints Tequila grab slice Coke NYNY   Then hit main lobby bar just down escalator some well poured totties  Cheers!
