I loved clubby feel restaurant  very much place reminded back east its dim lit recesses    However seriously HAPPENED FOOD?  We oysters actually very tasty  would order those again  good start  excited   I ordered steak sandwich which came thin grisly piece meat probably cheapest cut Sysco  Why asked wanted meat cooked beyond because cheap piece meat incapable being cooked any other way done  encased plain dry white hoggie roll topped slice seemly unwashed lettuce slice tomato red onion chipotle mayo side   However saddest part plate INSTANT mashed potatoes  just broke heart sitting sad flavorless gelatinous plate   Why would your patrons? Why?   The other half burger which adequate  meat thick onions flavorful bacon thick crispy  vegetables shining star lots flavor good variety cooked al dente    However plate ran into trouble because flavorful juicy vegetables right next burger plate which time served made burger bun soggy  would easy fix put veg  ramekin  fries ok    Overall drinks bar service Atmosphere A++++ 5 stars but foods really disappointing  <EOR> Hands down best steak ever had  Fabulous atmosphere walking straight back into era class elegance  experience worth paying for   <EOR> Great restaurant Freetown! strip but looking visit Freetown evening Triple George thumbs everyone   Really pretty vintage interior  bar takes entire room!

See review S+O aka Stewart + Ogden more information other restaurant here   Anyway fiancee ate other day   reservation place busy all   First off layout very strange   Two booths set little room another table between them   If place busy can't imagine sitting booth literally having someone else sitting right next table   literally close if someone sitting table would impossible booth without asking two people table move     Anyway seated waitress Rebbecca it some non standard spelling explained steaks seafood flown daily top quality   given sourdough bread butter olive oil red wine vinegar   sourdough super sour butter olive oil red wine vinegar made even more sour   eventually asked some more bread just butter but still sour more later    My fiancee Chicken Christopher side mushroom filet mignon loaded baked potato   food didn't take long arrive but pretty unimpressed   steak undercooked middle charred outside   even ordered butterflied prevent happening but no dice   potato good lots toppings it   fiancee liked mushrooms but felt chicken ho hum   both onion soup felt best part meal  very good cheese it   Anyway probably 10 minutes sitting asked aforementioned additional bread butter   waitress ended forgetting only additional 20 minutes waiting   end meal waiting around 10 minutes check only walking front house ask check did she pop up   She gave check reprint because she forgot take into account mentioned beginning meal would doing room charge   On way asked talk manager Case   didn't complain food but did complain service   He said he surprised because wasn't very busy but offered free lunch next day   He said he would around lunch gave card told ask if came next day   NOTE Case messaged Yelp discovered did actually talk Case restaurant   Case white manager spoke black   However he gave business card said told call etc   some other manager pretending actual manager   WTF?  We tried take offer around noon next day   front house indicated he today wasn't going today he wasn't last night   She said no manager duty yet she couldn't comp anything but if waited while different manager William? would there   said screw left   Long story short decent prices but food ranges average bad service some worst experienced any steakhouse   dozen casino steakhouses Vegas ranks bottom 2 service only M worse food only Binions worse    I'd highly suggest going Andiamo D if want steak downtown  <EOR> Pot Roast die for!
