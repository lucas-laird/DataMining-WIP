Enjoy! <EOR> I say am really disappointed unimpressed     This sushi place located inside Green Valley Resort   would think being touted high end sushi place things would better run    My hubs Friday night debated between Sushi Chinese food choose sushi Chinese restaurant dead  Usually tell tale sign    We asked sit sushi bar normally interact  sushi chef   true let tell ya    Moving waited 10 mins before even acknowledged waitress until sushi chef   start ordered Blueberry martini hot tea hubs just simple coke no ice   brought drinks umm water no martini site  another 10 minutes sushi chef finally asks if would something   hubs orders roll guy just walks away even asking if want anything acknowledging sitting there   hubs excuse quite few times before sushi chef would even look again   place noisy only 4 other couples place   But did put order in   Yeah!  During whole space time seen waitress once   Now two working place seeing other lovely girl working half restaurant taking drinks conversing etc   waitress Brandi looking around other table besides looking just raising shoulders going don't know     She finally reappears hubs gets two rolls tuna salmon sashimi   good 25 30 mins she brings martini   water glass empty husbands soda does she offer fill anything ask if need anything else?  Nopers   actually ask other waitress dishes poor soy sauce into    Now food itself good   sashimi really thick cuts salmon tuna   husbands spicy crab roll ginza roll pretty good   ginza roll actually best thing ever   heavy tasty   Warm crab kick  Really big rolls too   hubs happy said sashimi thick GOOD cuts fish   nummy    We through meal she standing other end sushi bar chatting child hostess   She no other tables but us   try several times attention bill   takes another 5 minutes until just stand ask it   am someone scene even really gets outwardly cranky please don't think rushing her   politely asked check  most attentive she all night     I say pricey price tag lack service caused really give place big old thumbs down   your neighborhood sushi spot instead one  <EOR> I don't know if because hadn't Japanese food awhile if because tired eating same food every day but Sushi + Sake great!  During stay Las Vegas usually stay Tropicana which sadly only three restaurants choose steakhouse Italian cafe various cuisines eating quite boring  night grandma wanted Asian food preferably Japanese  used stay Green Valley Ranch years ago knew Sushi + Sake great Japanese restaurant decided visit hoping still amazing dishes enjoyed many years ago  Luckily did!  My grandparents both LOVE deep fried soft shell crab watari kani ! hesitant try but grandma talked into glad she did because amazing! crispy perfect ponzu sauce understand why wanted come back here  little no breading around crab just light fry amazing crisp ness   I love spicy tuna but sadly no where Mainland same Hawaii but Sushi + Sake gets pretty close  debating between three rolls but ended choosing Wet Wild roll spicy tuna topped tuna garlic ponzu sauce   garlic ponzu sauce delish sushi roll itself good enough amazing even! closest home found far!   My grandma unagi don which HUGE fillets unagi which she hard time finishing  grandpa chirashi which according grandma less fish she remembered  But both happy dishes   I also ordered chicken dumplings thinking going gyoza but sadly Chinese shumai  Kind regret getting them because nothing special all very disappointed    The service great well  server don't know she knew but could tell Hawaii explained she Hawaii too  She very attentive gave extra otoshi which yummy!  I really wish grandparents still stayed Green Valley Ranch could enjoy restaurant more often but sure during next visit we'll come back Sushi + Sake! <EOR> Went Sushi + Sake tonight all eat hubby   Everything great start finish   Yeah pricey but made sure rolled there   2 hours still food comma haha   would totally come back when ever back area   We're sushi lovers stick but other dishes looked great too   family next some noodle beef dish disappeared pretty fast  <EOR> Last day vacation Las Vegas  Sushi Craving ensues  Staying Green Valley Ranch Resort  Remembered sushi joint right inside casino  Dragged boyfriend downstairs into Sushi Sake  Place rocked! First off Cute atmosphere  Fish tank backdrop small clusters tables intimate seating areas  sat right front sushi bar able see chefs preparing meal which fun  Service starts delicious cucumber salad arrives almost soon take your seat  Upon chatting owner discovered he fellow Bay Arean moved Las Vegas open own restaurant  Really neat guy  Friendly but overly friendly just right sense humor left wanting talk more soon he disappeared  felt very welcome staff took many pictures boyfriend without even asking  sushi great veggie shrimp tempura actually some best ever had  Boyfriend stuck fried rice which world  Super fresh unlike fried rice other restaurants tasted healthier but without losing essence fried rice should be!
