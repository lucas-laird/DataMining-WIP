Rambo's located your typical Vegas neighborhood strip mall but interior pretty unique  Much Metro Pizza Decatur Flamingo reminds 80's Saved Bell diner place fully decked 60's theme posters surf boards books 60's tie dye etc  There's even TV all sorts 60's era commercials playing music playing throughout restaurant period  brought place girlfriend couple months ago but looking menu she nixed idea we're trying eat healthier isn't much front choose although quite bit  offer few burger choices initially self titled Rambo Burger 1 2 lb burger stuffed special combo cheeses topped stack pulled pork bbq sauce topped onion ring toasted bun but contemplating just didn't appetite such thing visit  Instead waitress' other recommendation cheesy cheese burger 1 2 lb burger stuffed topped combo cheeses topped bacon lettuce tomato   What brought bit less groovy  Sorry to  meat didn't much flavor cheese supposedly stuffed wasn't noticeable but lots think fat chunks  also very dry end ate pretty quickly  bun bit big meat but good buttery fresh sweet  way much lettuce pull some off  cheese melted good but don't know 'cheesy cheese' just kind regular cheeseburger  bacon flavorful but some cooked enough bit chewy  Yes chickened ordering signature burger but if sign might question why top 10 list read past   The fries other hand very fresh great first but little oily near end  Still decent natural cut variety  pickle slice bit small but hardly deal breaker  additional side option seemed little excessive pasta salad seemed good idea but just ended being bit much food  piece bazooka gum bill nice touch though  final price $14 46 normal local spot 'fancier' burger but can't say I'd spend again  sure Rambo's offers plenty tasty options breakfast lunch dinner but based meal can't really stand burger  <EOR> Got cheesy cheese burger fresh cut fries chocolate peanut butter milkshake   DELICIOUS!

I must preface review disclosing horribly hungover morning when Rambo's  could barely read menu headACHE! bright colored interior actually made sick  BUT some aleve large amounts water consumption able feel human    Rambo's help   Note read menu wrong  defense very lengthy menu   thought Pick 3 deal 3 side dishes eggs benedict  no idea when picked 3 items ordered Red Rock Benedict actually ordering 2 separate menu entrees please refer previous paragraph    I think place awesome  ANY place board game table where kick husband's arse Snakes Ladders while waiting appetizer gets vote  Breakfast Lunch Dinner available all day another big PLUS book  husband serious offenders eyes bigger stomachs cliche  He overwhelmed all menu options  took 15 minutes before committing order  Rambo Burger clearly lunch item it 9 am but husband could resist urge  ordered donuts appetizer fried zucchini     accidentally ordered Eggs bacon toast hash browns Red Rock Benedict    Right dominated Snakes Ladders awesome idea game boards table game pieces donuts zucchini served  donuts ask? don't know because husband didn't share!!! Apparently menu clearly states fried zucchini whole zucchini's worth zucchini but must missed part see paragraph 1    We ordered LOT food  lot!  red rock bene good but the focaccia bread 5 inches high    would perfect if slice bread much thinner  But no worries  hubby wasn't big fan rambo burger   he said lacked lot flavor would expect all ingredients  He did finish off bene he really liked that  eggs good bacon crispy  All pluses book   hands down highlights meal Zucchini hear donuts  definitely going back because want try all items hand battered  hand battered zucchini just delicious    The service spot but maybe tad overwhelming couple times     but couple sitting next within earshot definitely getting irritated number times waitress asked sure can't refill your iced tea it 4   BUT really liked staff definitely game nothing without refill when asked refill gave refill cup   nice touch ladies   The book menu definitely leaves plenty ideas next time  definitely coming back minus hangover !!!! <EOR> On last visit took bad service whole new level  half hour before being acknowledged table  ordering didnt drinks 15 mins food took 45 minutes!  There server running around chicken without head nervously mentioning she new there  Each time encounter wanted ask where fire was  When inquired food she check reported back such somber nervous way thought she going break news dog died something  Dramatic much? Hold together isn't life death   The check wrong many levels  charged meat eggs which didn't side fruit which could replaced meat extra egg whites  friend charged fruit even though she plainly asked if she could sub potatoes fruit  accidentally brought both charged both     It took long credit cards back thought could sooner leave cancel damn cards replacements mail before they'd return    After all food just good enough back there  Ever  place circus poorly staged that  <EOR> I live down street Rambo's really want businesses area well Hubby try them often budget allows  first visit 2 weeks ago immediately loved theme abundance 60s 70s memorabilia  just overall fun place much see do   table cards books husband spotted TV trivia game he snagged when walked in  saw other tables checkers kids coloring books crayons much more   made second visit 70s themed diner today inspired Yelp write it  sad see negative reviews customer service restaurant because experienced GREAT customer service both times in  food does take little while but Husband just played games flipped through books table while waited If food fresh delicious wait while it    So let's it    fresh delicious Both visits ordered fresh doughnuts which fried perfection then coated cinnamon sugar served hot   ordered small size which perfectly sweet appetizer    Our first visit Husband ordered Groovy Deal which turkey avocado croissant served fries coleslaw  He really liked impressed freshness ingredients  ordered BLT added avocado   also very fresh delicious but really mess BLTA?  ordered strawberry shake dessert which thick yummy served just diner shake should be   Today strolled around 11 30  husband breakfast mood lunch mood which perfect because Rambo's many menu selections satisfy either  ordered BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich crinkle fries coleslaw   boy ordered Country Breakfast Platter  sandwich HUGE messy delicious!

Blow candles already! I eat outside place smelled badly perfumes!  I ordered 5 things off menu try little everything  hot dog good chicken sandwich nothing comment fries burnt burger dry tasteless even thousand island rest dull boring can't even remember was  <EOR> I place  But forgot even existed until saw Yelp again    literally 1 block away me!   This cool little 60's themed diner all throwback decor  Old books games memorabilia posters they're everywhere! I'd say its little overkill but good way  it! food honestly special  all  or least anyway   ordered breakfast burrito super bland  much seasoning all  Which now think why am giving 4 stars?   Oh yeah because its such rad place hang out  Maybe decor distracted food     OH! just any other diner 60's offer free WiFi! <EOR> I place several occasions  am firm believer giving every place benefit doubt    Consistent 2 areas Terrible service cold food   You pay lot money mainstream food! <EOR> Thought we'd try out  Looked kooky kitchy maybe bit fun    Well service pleasant polite but straight away wife weirded taste water then Coke  ice! Something wrong no idea what    just tasted funky  some more soda no ice  Problem solved    Ordered AYCE fish n chips fresh cut fries comes chips  Back goes  wife notices chips taken off fish sitting there  Forgot mention   small restaurant open plan kitchen  Quite warm Food comes fries  Yay! Fish still hot  Double yay! Short lived    Neither fish batter nor fries seasoned  fish fries cooked well maybe even good tasted     Meh Almost definitely going back  <EOR> My wife love going breakfast lunch dinner  60's decore playful fun food very good  Everything appears homemade especially desserts  chicken fried steak gravy fantastic monte cristo sandwich awesome  Also love homemade brownies! <EOR>
