No where did say dessert would come marshmallows too  Therefore wouldn't recommend Taiyaki driving distance just picture because wasn't even presented well enough snap photo  details fish really compared others pics  Beware hype  other hand also lavender black tea topped salt foam  drink ok  Although place does wifi large tables which would good studying catching friends most likely won't back  Plus order odd because counter sit down wait them? initially sat down some friends but greeted menu anything  However saw another table attended order taken table  ended going cashier  still stumped why place great reviews even elite members  definitely think deceived  <EOR> Cute little place  Banoffee toast sp?     amazing!

Sensing theme hope    desert came same manner time greatly spaced apart except gave waiting second taiyaki  I don't think problem server but rather kitchen sister noted when she settling bill orders input correctly    In all spent almost 2 hours cafe left extremely disappointed     They should probably just stick drinks only enjoyable part visit  <EOR> I've place booked marked months finally chance come  place spot chill  Glad don't China Town spot chill eat some good dessert  place packed cold Friday night  atmosphere nice chill  Place clean staff little short but friendly  ordered two different types honey toast taro smoothie  honey toast delicious! Perfectly plated nice crispy just he right amount sweetness  didn't try taro smoothie but Sister said used powder didn't taste good  <EOR> Yes pictures place looks great  But disappointed food  loved Octopus balls but fish waffle very disappointing  definietly cute pictures just pictures  But filling literally pudding bread used dense  understand need sense structure holding stuff but little much  But great drinks though  ordered Yuzu very happy turn out  <EOR> Cute cafe aesthetically pleasing  Great presentation but great taste  Service little lacking could use some improvement   What motivated try place definitely pictures taiyaki! looks gorgeous GREAT pics but sadly batter pretty dry thick  takoyaki decent  green tea lemonade somewhat bitter best item ordered matcha espresso latte which isn't sweet prominent matcha coffee flavors    Needless say came Cafe Summer first time high expectations but average experiences during few times here  <EOR> After reading fantastic reviews Cafe Summer decided should give place try  love some taiyaki egglette waffles  seen Yelp pictures said items told myself I'd set expectations low didn't look right but many 4 5 star reviews brought here   Despite having lowered expectations still underwhelmed unimpressed quality products  Some drinks look all cutesy Instagram shit  where should stay don't bother eating drinking stuff here  waste money time calories  diabetes elsewhere!  Taiyaki Limp  Anything limp plain sad  Nothing should limp  good taiyaki should some crispness withstand melty ice cream toppings  somehow compensate Viagra needing cone sadness served wire cone  chose Nutella vanilla ice cream Oreo crumb  Nutella filling tasted lot more grocery bought chocolate pudding hint Nutella  Oreo chunks crumbs but  bad  thing whole bad  1 5  Egglette Waffle supposed crisp shell soft interior  flaccid waffle plate  Presentation boring consistency even worse  more little balls pancake  matcha egglette didn't really much matcha flavor it  1 5  Each dessert costs anywhere $5 6  much considering sub par quality get  Sure service kind great  two only given spoon  asked another spoon but never came  took few bites paid left  vowed come back  worth drive  <EOR> I agree some other yelpers   worst takoyaki ever eaten     We also ordered green tea red bean egglette   ok   Presentation little sloppy considered $8 dessert   All pictures looked pretty attractive hope high until your first bite  <EOR> Cafe Summer cute cozy cafe located Southwest side town Rainbow  There's plenty parking love don't travel Spring Mountain indulge yummy sweets drinks  decoration adorable  Since last time they've added Zen Pod as pictured   start company based San Jose offers convenient pod computer order conduct business  company's website said first pod placed somewhere public  Besides environment very peaceful  few parties studying plenty seating!  The only dessert tried taiyaki  ice cream filling great  option choose your ice cream flavor filling flavor topping  ordered matcha green tea ice creaming taiyaki Pocky red bean filling  Everything good except shell way hard  Taiyaki typically soft waffles however shell eating potato chips  plenty other desserts want try addition savory snacks won't deter coming back future    We ordered lychee rose orange yuzu drink  butterfly pea tea wasn't flavorful typically other places but wasn't bad either  lychee rose super refreshing  light carbonation hints lychee  many options drink menu hope come back try them all    The customer service polite fast  came bad experience nearby dessert shop nearby glad another option    Definitely check place if you're area whether need study catch friend they board games   <EOR> Cute place but definitely came wrong night  first choice desserts wanted try the brownie crepe cake plan B plan C  Then tried order Oreo cheesecake along tiramisu honey toast did end getting guess what    they're too  wanted ask if anything else  I'd completely understand if place busy  girl working tonight rude unapologetic helpful all  desserts mediocre getting them slammed table when being served cherry top perfect night  Lol  If you're known your Taiyakis drinks great    but why give any kind recommendations why all extra stuff menu <EOR> Came weekday night wasn't busy besides group girls studying beside us  Cute little Asian inspired cafe anime looking characters wall some cute music    Ordered pork belly rice meal did expect huge! Came bento box multiple slots items  Definitely worth price! Pork belly some special sauce definitely favorite good choice salty sweet either  Came rice some cabbage sauce did expect t much   Also ordered jasmine milk tea boba bad either  Boba cooked nicely but just wished usual almond milk tea menu but drink selections variety  Last but least dessert! taiyaki fish waffle filled ice cream Nutella filling marshmallow  Taiyaki thought pretty good but then again never real thing Japan  fillings ice cream inside nice touch picture worthy but thought should've used mini marshmallows instead big ones  Overall definitely place try would come back  Gonna try honey toast next! Hope does justice trying find honey toast just good ones Hawaii  <EOR> While Cafe Summer three times yet try dessert section  first visit ordered Volcano wing which good but wasn't worth trying again  didn't create mouth watering sensation nice have  same Chicken Steak rice ate during another visit  Although haven't tried dessert menu would suggest putting your money rather main dishes    Along desserts Cafe Summer known drinks  wide selection drinks boba coffee  tried Orange Yuzu seems Cafe Summer's specialty multiple times during visits  say hype worth picture but  it   The Peach Tea best  sweet refreshing perfect taste summer  Besides would refrain trying most other stuff menu now  <EOR> I've twice experience bit better second time around but much    The first time came during grand opening  saw buy free sign see there  Little did know promotion just house milk tea  unaware until excited drinks chose bill came $14 we ordered chicken   THEN told BOGO included  sister disappointed she canceled order completely somewhere else    I came back second time give another chance  thrown off fact restaurant type theme where order counter pay BEFORE leave  almost forgot pay because used paying drinks right ordering  would less confusing if sign telling order then pay before leave  please wait ot seated maybe someone door direct us    maybe  just me   I wanted try matcha espresso drink but really nervous so  friend ended getting both try stuck hokkaido milk tea had stay comfort zone because embarrassed ask redo drink don't like   took sip matcha espresso immediately regretted it  Matcha espresso probably combined taste must acquire  also wasn't very fond hokkaido milk tea definitely better most likely stay where know won't disappointed  <EOR> This place another cafe unique items  stuff ordered hit miss but must item   Orange Yuzu Tea Shit fire only does look unique tastes good too   Grapefruit Tea Nasty medicine forced take kid     Blue Mojito good until realized drank all syrup drink just turned into soda water  Basil Shaken Chicken feeling cause weird aftertaste  Volcano Wings Fire especially breading topped ice cream     Hong Kong Waffle Ok     All all excellent edition emerging Rainbow Road food scene  <EOR> Cafe Summer looked cute all IG pics but experience impressed likely back   I Matcha Espresso Latte drink which just average me  wasn't horrible great  appreciate good matcha flavor though!   I also tried Taiyaki red bean green tea ice cream which really disappointed with  best part ice cream    which could've just bought own own market  What's wrong taiyaki?  1 waiter didn't bother writing down 3 different orders table's taiyaki repeatedly wrong dishes   2 didn't include all toppings such pocky advertised   3 don't tell but put marshmallows between ice cream bottom red bean layer space filler  while you're just eating fried flour marshmallows  Which jam all  didn't red bean layer bottom since literally just red bean some whole beans weren't crushed into paste  just much couldn't even finish taiyaki point   TL DR Don't waste your money taiyaki    My last order Basil Shaken Chicken  Let warn now because staff unfortunately didn't takes while cook don't if you're rush  waiter forgot order hunt them down 3 times ask if order ready yet  When finally dish getting ready leave  actual flavor full basil pretty decent commend them that  wish came typical sweet sour sauce though!   All all wouldn't recommend place due horrific service mediocre food  <EOR> Cafe Summer new Asian inspired boba dessert spot Las Vegas    We decided try Taiyaki aka fish see all over Instagram  decided see hype all about  put strawberry ice cream marshmallows two pocky sticks top  cute when arrived tried take cute pictures before melted away  does messy only give napkin suggest asking bowl if want eat normal messy    Overall average place sure if would come back  <EOR> I when soft opening  They're very welcoming gave good customer service  tried rose tea its <EOR> One newer milk tea boba places opened up  really different other spots perk they're open late  tried Hokkaido milk tea ok great brew tea  Also tried classic milk tea just little sweet  Jasmine milk tea though milky smooth lot jasmine flavor  boba good consistency served warme always stop whenever want late night boba fix  <EOR> Cafe Summer new cafe added southwest area! Compared other cafes around southwest area cafe savory snacks well assorted drinks cannot found elsewhere throughout area  Last week friend decided try place since wanted new cafe before   When very chilly outside employee decided offer hot water before ordered drinks warm ourselves up  ordered hot osmanthus milk tea which recommended employee friend ordered lychee green tea boba  Both drinks great!   Even though Cafe Summer deciding changing closing hours 2am 11pm winter employees let stay long wanted very kind it  Currently believe decided final decision changing closing hours 11pm winter    Next time visit Cafe Summer want try savory snacks orange yuzu tea which very colorful  10 10 recommend Cafe Summer menu items service! <EOR> Super cute little cafe!  You dine take out  came friend dined few other customers well still drinks desserts relatively fast   I tried Hokkaido milk tea favorite kind milk tea  actually super good! liked tasted genuine milk tea because tea used super flavorful   I also tried taiyaki  customize flavor ice cream toppings fillings  combination strawberry ice cream mochi nutella filling which thought super good!  I definitely back look forward trying new items menu! <EOR> Had high expectations place but ended being disappointed  came because yelp reviews pretty good  ordered milk tea  tasted horrible!! should've stick usual place  items menu okay  wasn't great but also wasn't good  Definitely wouldn't coming back here  <EOR> dessert pretty good ordered taiyaki nutella vanilla ice cream nutella seemed more chocolate pudding versus actual nutella service really slow guy served took forever take order then take check place really clean though overall good dessert  <EOR> Had almond milk latte strawberry banana egglette liked them both!
