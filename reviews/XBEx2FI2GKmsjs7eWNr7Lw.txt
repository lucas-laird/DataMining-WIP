I started review over month ago forgot submit it!  So first time acai bowl loaded fruit granola   not sure if granola honey forgot ask  If vegan DON'T FORGET ASK because sure   Anyway  ordered bowl asked made coconut milk instead soy  did no problem   Now deal   it says alllllllll over signs even guy took order said too   it's cut made order  why takes longer  Ok  well explain why ever time gotten bowl fruit frozen  frost bite but def SUPER THIN ice hard bite   I'm bitching fresh frozen fruit eat home smoothies daily  just saying always surprises fruit way when each time guy says fresh cut  LOL!  The mango smoothie hubby once super good    I really don't know often far Rainbow even though live Rainbow bowls no ordinary bowls stay home Vitamix <EOR> Decided healthy meal dessert smoothie ordered definitely did disappoint   apple base smoothie mango strawberries helped alleviate heaviness lunch meal   There's much add addition all hype revolving place did chance try acai bowl but would plan next time town   drive thru kind took while but deliciousness freshness drinks made worthwhile   Everyone enjoyed smoothies friends fruit yogurt which basically looked parfait he thoroughly enjoyed well     All all I'd say sure stop when town next time point try acai bowl!  Given fact weather bleh such heavy meal prior visit over good picker upper <EOR> These guys great but    twice everytime wait least 15 minutes order only two line  second time sat drive thru 10 minutes  left without giving them order  happened April 20th  know takes time but dang its slow  <EOR> Had earlier month brought friend large size  She gave right ate lunch  Yet somehow    still able finish gigantic large acai bowl  I'd say large container maybe pint  give take  small portion    Topped fresh fruit strawberries bananas blueberries coconut shavings first thought    should eat going gym huh    XD Traditional Acai Ah sa ee bowl made organic acai guarana apparently rich caffeine strawberries non fat frozen yogurt blended w choice apple juice coconut milk soy milk  Topped organic granola coconut shavings agave nectar honey    The first topped agave nectar felt bowl whole lacked little bit more sweetness didnt know honey option suggested friend maybe honey would better   acai fruit bright refreshing but light  But tons organic granola score!   almost meal its own  2nd time myself search breakfast through drive thru  told through intercom just minute    minute later hear voice off side while concentrating menu outside   XD guy walked notepad take order LOL surprise   Judging first experience large thought regular maybe same type cup bowl but shorter  pulled window surprise regular cup size tall  Then thought DANG ! $1 difference should gotten large ! XD worth large _ Cut fruits topped honey time presented nicely  wrong honey though  adds    different flavor it   maybe good honey  maybe next time ill ask agave nectar again but little more?   Experience noted  Large instead Regular   regular finished time home   only live 10 minutes away  Err    Maybe ask little more granola love granola some reason    XD om nom nom <EOR> I love place  fresh absolutely delicious!! must try  wish open Sundays! always crave acai bowl time sun  refreshing! <EOR> The owner terrible customer service!! First he refused service because asked if could bowl put larger cup  DIDN'T MIND PAYING EXTRA BTW   We ordered 2 large Acai Bowls added extra toppings $3 4 extra received 4 pineapples 4 blueberries  asked them if could put bowl larger cup rather short change other ingredients attempting fit everything same size cup  Again every time came mentioned don't mind paying extra larger cup  POOR POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE WAY RUN ANY BUSINESS!!  Will coming again don't recommend place anyone unfortunately experience  again experience only speak myself  <EOR> This place best acai bowls Las Vegas!

Kids eat free spending 9 99 which isn't hard all  Best drive thru! Wonderful healthy place meal smoothie <EOR> Close house huge portions acai every bowl  really did enjoy maybe next time ask more agave syrup  service slow though if call in  Only downfall place very small no where sit slow service  heard burgers good am very picky veggie patties next time try it   TIP Spend $1 more large acai bowl worth it  <EOR> I disappointed acai bowl whole experience  acai bowls but place  doubt come back   I roll down window place order second window because speaker wasn't working  drive through window awkwardly high  drive SAV window still high  You'd need drive semi  strong smell grease air  sure if coming pupusas place next door but 8 30am pupusas place wasn't open yet   I Traditional Acai Bowl pineapples protein  asked if pineapples fresh kind protein use  pineapples frozen shipped California  protein powder flavorless because sells more  Each topping add on $1 extra    The service pleasant  told took $1 off purchase but didn't tell why  first customer day but wait least 15 minutes order   My acai bowl very soupy couldn't eat car without making mess  use straw then scoop granola fruits spoon  granola soggy overall flavor lacking  <EOR> My boyfriend decided try Juice 'N' other day gotta say place hard miss due bright colors its building compared neighbors  pretty small place fact think could even turn into food truck deal if didn't want actual location    They drive thru area well walk area  actually didn't notice drive thru ahead walked instead  pretty good amount items menus ranging wraps smoothies course famous acai bowl everyone rages about    So since most known item acai bowl then ordered  decided regular sized acai bowl  guy took order down asked if wanted traditional acai bowl  wasn't really sure he meant     asked  He said could customize liked  didn't really know utmost freedom until read reviews more closely visit instead subbed two items    Their traditional bowl bananas strawberries blueberries honey coconut shavings topped honey believe  instead bananas coconut shavings wanted mangos raspberry  Then top because first time customer upgraded regular large  which very generous them    The wait     sort long something doesn't typically take long time make  Then again never made types things actually wouldn't really know  But also some drive thrus coming through maybe too     And he came traditional acai bowl  Huh? Haha he said mind sometimes busy completely forgets  he made traditional acai bowl instead customized ordered  He gave traditional top re making order walked away two large acai bowls! lucky day!   Anyways though maybe because didn't want bananas acai bowl didn't look filled original  blueberries missing perhaps because two he didn't fill bowl? knows    The flavors acai little bland expected be  Granted very familiar acai flavor but bowl sort     watery  runny well  Perhaps need put more frozen yogurt thicken up? love granola mix though  very well fruit  bowl wasn't really sweet which plus  very refreshing really filling too  boyfriend didn't want any stuck whole bowl own So may average most but service amazing experienced far  bit slow but eh time  definitely want back try more things perhaps try another bowl time little smarter ordering <EOR> This place yummy! wish Juice 'N' Henderson area! looks those places where would your smog check your car something but besides gotta love place!
