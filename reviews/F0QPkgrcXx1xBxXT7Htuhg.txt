Went Thursday night kind last resort very impressed   right away no reservation   decor nothing fancy a nice old school steakhouse   server Todd great   Brought samples drinks try   Blood orange cosmo great   Wedge salad good but lobster bisque top notch best   steaks fantastic   meat high quality much gristle just right amount seasoning   rib eye actually very lean rib eye filet great   desert tiramisu which never ending  Overall best steakhouses ever  <EOR> Ok here's deal! know Bally's older resorts strip  heard brunch fantastic  really never heard very many things actual steakhouse good bad  Well let put this    I've much better terms service food atmosphere!  Ok now good stuff food! Having many steakhouse's around Vegas matter many others around country didn't hope very much  It'd comparing BMW Chevy  Both great but details matters! Now knowing looked place Chevy mid level steakhouse catering more family crowd    To start house special bacon wrapped scallops over bed red pepper salad? Hum  think more bacon wrapped scallops over few silvers red peppers  Scallops great but just needed bit more substance    The second appetizer lobster bisque  Everything ok but seemed more lobster meat needed    Now steaks rib eye's solid  Nothing really negative write about  Just usual suspects  However couple things worth mentioning lack flavoring various sauces offer diner  Since 3 eating thought we'd mix match sauces offered  ordered red wine green peppercorn morel mushroom sauce  quite honest all tasted same! Heavy cream no honest flavoring various ingredients    Just classic steakhouse's side dishes all al la carte  being said potatoes ho hum sauteed spinach well least water should drained bit fries? think frozen  Oh well? do?    Now service   Very polite but would say need take page service 101  i e  being polite only much while knowledge food all way! being said servers did know sauces asking about    just referring listing have    Promptly correcting error key great experience but none   wrong sauces brought us   no apology   a steak someone ordered returned kitchen being kinda off    no apology   asking specials were   did know      With city filled great steakhouses might think twice before coming again  <EOR> One best meal ever had  prices high but well worth it  made reservations through Tix4Tonight 50% off entree can't that  service best ever experienced hard beat  atmosphere old vegas quite nice  think if dinner very pleased  <EOR> My fiance came dinner Tuesday night service fantastic!  wish could say same food    Right seated hostess brought over 2 glasses champagne said wanted wish 'a prosperous healthy new year'   ordered waitress noticed kept looking watch because thought might running late show asked if limited time   Service quick staff friendly attentive   manager came twice once say hello other see doing       The food below average 'nice' steakhouse   both steaks nothing ordinary   creamed corn shared way sweet   also didn't staff stood around dining area   perhaps slow night but still didn't enjoy eating group people standing nearby talking looking around    The manager stopped way pulled white rose flower arrangement handed said 'for beautiful lady'   very well taken care of   if only could step notch food     HI great service LO not so great food <EOR> While Bally Steakhouse doesn't name TV chef tied great dining experience   staff takes pride service provide   thank coming sure 5 star experience   food does disappoint  <EOR> I very reluctant because past reviews however pleasantly surprised! AMAZING! food great service great too!

Way better expected medium rare very nice sear tender  didn't need add any additional seasoning which great   probably better steaks eaten short life rock   took several pictures Capt  Chaos posing steak!  He impressed too  asparagus cooked just right potato was    potato  All all very happy meal would most likely back when if stay Bally's future!  Word <EOR> My husband Vegas honeymoon found Groupon place decided buy Groupon try out  Decor very old school other reviewers mentioned  fairly early reservation seated promptly   Dinner served two breads baguette bread fruit nuts  appetizers ordered escargot  drenched olive oil garlic herb sauce fantastic sopping bread in   main course ordered salmon husband ordered duck   salmon delicious nice crust sauce but burned all  sauce came advertised black bean sauce but more citrusy gingery kick pleasant but overwhelming  veggies dish tasted fresh crisp  husband's duck cooked medium rare high quality cut meat  He seemed really enjoy meal though didn't chance taste    We didn't dessert left full but overstuffed  didn't wine cocktails due dehydration oppressive heat Vegas July can't really review those selections  But overall really enjoyed dining experience Groupon made totally worth it  would willing return pay full price meal splurgey occasion   Note dress code but pretty casual basically stuff 'no tank tops'  <EOR> We ate walking around all day going any further Strip unable Open Table work reservations  Admittedly self conscious walking casually dressed but seated right away    Servers nothing but nice    They offered both sample cocktails  tasted orange cosmo which would happily ordered another but much drinker   I special Wagyu 6 oz going try eat 18 oz steak nothing else completely caught eye terms entrees  Bread amazing ate much it   The bacon wrapped stuff shrimp very tasty just right portion asparagus   My notoriously picky eater husband loved French Onion Soup even liked tasted fan it killed 18 oz ribeye  Enjoyed Caesar even though dressing mixed he hates dressing    Dessert creme brulee cheesecake 2 spoons    It's VERY expensive but worth it  even grabbed business card hopes convince coworkers MIGHT good spot annual Vegas dinner   Also if you're Total Rewards Member knock dollar off most items  <EOR> This far most disappointing dining experience while Vegas   service neglectful best   waiter even presented check without asking if wanted dessert   meals unfinished because quality meat poor steaks tough  Yet waiter never asked if everything ok meals   Overpriced mediocre food   would dine again left feeling ripped off hungry  <EOR> The place just okay  Nothing spectacular   decor dated menu dated manner which serve carts? Really? Table side salad service? dated   I contemplated whether okay since Vegas  Vegas history Bally's Steakhouse part it  However think excuses place   fine play your history but using excuse lack updated menu decor unacceptable   The food okay  would very upset meal paid full price but Groupon did to  $30  dinner fine  paid $58 dollars bill much   I understand place set close its doors really bad  Given location history believe could viable option dinning north strip especially considering competition high priced venues such Picasso Bellagio    I think would still recommend people give place try before close doors if nothing else able say dined resturant frequented Liza Minelli Frank Sinatra  <EOR> Had Sunday brunch group 7 friends because Groupon   Oysters large worse Caesar's  The free mimosas Beldevere shots Bloody Marys good   The filet mignon lobsters also very good  trying find caviar but didn't any some lamb mint sauce very tasty   Sushi also pretty good  Fruit good too  Selection pretty small overall though   Not sure would worth normally though  <EOR> Granted expectations little low but Bally's Steakhouse blew away    This old school steakhouse stepping back time 1950s   where could dine side side Frank Sinatra Dean Martin  Everything very professional moment check hostess enter restaurant lobby  Though restaurant huge tables packed closely together  mix booths along walls well free standing tables center room  Servers busboys skillfully navigate trays cocktails trays meat    The prices much more reasonable some more trendy steak restaurants Gordon Ramsey talking you   But food just outstanding those newer more expensive hotspots    Start appetizer   I highly recommend Escargot Stuffed Mushrooms friends loved salads  dinner Filet Mignon   cooked perfection! literally ate every bite  Truffle Mac Cheese Mashed Potato sides also wonderful    Our night Bally's Steakhouse classy highly satisfying! <EOR> It excellent! Great service very attentive waiter brought drink samples    I ordered herbed chicken mushroom caps  <EOR> I would never pay much meal quality but great meal because free! just into being doted over serviced paying $50 steak    They brought samples signature drinks blood orange Cosmo gentleman jack apple brandy guys  First all sexist much?
