My return trip several weeks later much better!  Michelle being behind bar brought happy prompt service   She clarified all orders   yes would rocks smiled well informed menu items general sense pride job    We repeated tasty fattening trio dips remembered order  veggie fajitas sans onions   Success! I can't give more 3 stars due to Lack ambiance music we played own Pandora first time Low quality ingredients especially pink white tomatoes iceberg lettuce  However back because sometimes just need some crappy delicious Tex Mex margarita       Happy hour $3 99 margarita $1 89 dips  Less 5 taquitos chicken fingers wings mini chimichangas    $2 3 beer <EOR> This favorite restaurant ever since kid  Honestly its because chicken fingers homemade ranch  Its literally best you'll ever taste  Don't wrong though other food really good too  <EOR> I don't want sound snob   but worst Mexican food ever had!!!

Way much everything  Maybe changed but why spend dough food elsewhere better? I just came back review because Yelp told unfinished whatever means    Because intimidated Yelp women finish If want lump 'o cheese best mediocre Mexican food enjoy yourself  definitely better McDonald's  <EOR> Macayo's chain but staple visits Vegas  Partly because 2 blocks mom's house partly because absolutly LOVE tortilla soup  super simple consists broth cheese tortilla chips little bit stewed tomatoes  No meat  I really chips sauce  chips thin serve two different sauces  mild slightly chunky other little hotter smooth taco sauce  Both good but typically gravitate towards hotter combine them together  Also can't pass margarita when mom  If purchase margarita glasses discount margaritas whenever bring back in  bought probably 20 years ago but never think take me  Guess should try remember next time head Vegas  Macayo's popular football game hangout high school students back 70s always little nostalgic there  Unfortunately back then only ate burgers <EOR> shame assholes own biz your father work hard build 40 yrs family eats 1 6 times month last time all three sick enchilade sauce story tells all place new onto old product your items need food your kitchen last person 9 00pm order old dangerous sick nasty sauce fucked family fucking assholes shame you go business work fucking taco bell motherfuckers <EOR> We because gone since little  because Cha Cha Bob  world's most delicious chips salsa  TCTs  because delicious  new location bright clean  Service quick friendly  love cheese enchiladas! love fill Cha Cha's huge hat margaritas  Cheers  <EOR> It just ok   Very packed Mother's Day which completely expected actually sit bar area very quickly !!

The salsa great chips very average but queso  good !!  Las Vegas ton Mexican Restaurants but all same far flavor !! <EOR> This worst service experienced! should known service would when started phone call made asking if open making sure closing time woman straight hung saying word  When waitress Maria upset because asked refill drinks then slammed drink table then smacked hands down thighs  Other taking order flagging down refill drink didn't see rest night! waiting forever finally walked front asked bill ourselves  lady upfront asked table sitting printed receipt handed sign it  No good night thank your dinner   nothing  No communication all! VERY disappointed going back! <EOR> Worse remember  Stale chips rice with  entree additional charge  BBQ chicken salad hard piece chicken ice berg lettuce  Nice staff  <EOR> I am impressed  Friendly staff server Brandon very attentive couldn't asked better  food bland no seasoning  salsa taste jar  would never come again  need hire new cooks help them more authentic menu  chimichanga fried more grilled burrito  <EOR> Service excellent food horrible  Everything flavorless including sauce use instead salsa  place old could use update decor menu  <EOR> One word    Bleurgh heck happened place? only good thing going them chips  <EOR> What awful experience  First asked if anyway kids soup salad couldn't beans instead salad  She said no then came solution would close 8 dollars four year old  No thank you  husband ordered meals specifically because came guacamole  25 minutes order taken received meals told no guacamole wasn't no big deal  still charged husband 10 79 then became nothing more bean rice burrito could gotten Del Taco 4 bucks  won't back  <EOR> Well If you're looking authentic Mexican food isn't restaurant    The decor cute guess  mandatory 1 star to   You see birthday dinner table 14 deep  advised waiter would which check FRONT  pain separate checks some guests table being servers themselves made sure patient accurate everyone's lives little easier   The food came nachos allllll cheese meat  Nachos should balance toppings!  My mom fajitas overcooked mushy  margaritas weak could perhaps passed salty virginitas  Again table 14 people won't bore rest dishes   Worst part checks    So waiter comes back starts writing down big roll receipt paper  What? No wanna home now  should easy part where swipe card tip go    I first hand off debit card  over 15 minutes check card being everyone else theirs back already  accidentally adding 3 different things another guest's bill kept card sort insurance if couldn't figure items belonged to  upset wasn't any communication waiter's behalf because very understanding person  But sit around while everyone else left table did feel very good    Unprofessional unauthentic unimpressive  You couldn't pay return  <EOR> All hit miss reviews threw friend looked them before even though Die's choice way she said well mixed reviews bit nervous sure   We seated woman front desk admit she wasnt friendly all she didnt ask if ever before even say welcome Macayos she simply asked many 3 sat us       Hugo waiter he BEST!     Friendly engaging very helpful menu    sure he suggested few things very good   And Horchata wish agua frescas but hard find would seem      The die made all drinks all soda except horchata then ordered TCT which seen GREAT       I Cheese Relleno Ground beef Tacos   refried beans rice dessert fried ice cream     back!  Oh clean comfortable bathrooms super clean! <EOR> This place wonderful! Great atmosphere! waiters very polite respectful  Great service!  food great   blended frozen strawberry margaritas always made patron tequila die for   fajitas favorite but burritos enchiladas amazing too  Try Baja enchiladas burritos! Reasonably priced! highly recommend restaurant! <EOR> The food terrible  location twice lunch  first time ordered combo  plate taco enchilada second time beef fajitas  chips tortillas stale flavorless  obviously freshly made but bought restaurant supplier  entrees mushy also lacked any seasoning  Both times service bad slow inattentive  should take 90 minutes your meal drinks should refilled least once prior requesting check  price would better meal Chipotle Zabas  <EOR> A wide variety Mexican eats fajitas chimichangas tacos burritos seafood salads  greeted  chips 2 salsas chips good salsas okay  mini sampler great 2 mini tostadas 2 mini tacos taquitos chimi small tamale  Serves tostada dish full sour cream guacamole  Server efficient checked few times  good experience! <EOR> Chips Salsa great here  I'd come Macayo's just hot smooth sauce!! Mmmm nom nom nom     <EOR> Big disappointment food fresh tastes canned tomatoes instant rice   Beans microwaved before serving too  Place clean tables sticky  <EOR> I love Macayo's! try New Mexican places    always come back  Chips N Salsa best! know Vegas if love Macayo's TCTs   plenty food your dollar  favorites Tostada Del Mundo Chimichangas fajitas favorite   also try fried ice cream tortilla soup order though  All other reviews they're here <EOR> Macayo's serving most white washed Mexican food ever tasted couldn't agree Cassandra B any more    except think awesome  Look when decide authentic Mexican food list places don't look 1  Summerlin 2  End list  Growing Minnesota Taco Bell ethnic tastes Macayo fits bill perfectly  Add its 10 minute drunken stumble    err walk home couldn't happier    I think compare Macayo other similar restaurants Macayo good border grill but WAY better say Cantina Laredo just every other Tex Mex style restaurant state  those don't authenticity check every restaurant guide Macayo n00bs  Step 1 Margaritas  lots them frozen rocks  least 3  Step 2 Trio Dip love Queso  Queso mean white cheese dip some Mexican restaurants  Las Vegas appears Queso wasteland BTW if reading know where White Cheese dip QUESO FUNDIDO thats gross please send message first born    any other born matter   Macayo does traditional white queso but yellow cheese dip certainly passable pinch  trio comes dip bean dip combo cheese spinach dip shockingly good  say shockingly because would ever think ruin perfectly good cheese adding spinach? Sorry popeye but vile weed no place plate destined human consumption  digress  Anywhoo should finishing your second margarita time polish off dip trio  Step 3 Entrees  really big menu however only 2 correct choices food order Fajitas Chimichanga  Lets start fajitas best but crapload pretty good food money  No real complaints  chimi really good  those don't know Chimichanga burrito then fried french fries anything edible south  few different chimichangas but honest should Marg 3 point subtle differences probably lost you     Step 4 If still conscious return step 1 rinse repeat    Some people said the salsa bad   exaggerating its certainly passable  no idea if house would guess not but    its free salsa beginning meal its really important    Others said service bad never me  several times during busy hours while servers aren't all over place never more few minutes without water glass chips table  <EOR> Walked boyfriend just two  No greeted no said word nothing  Clearly worker could simply said moment      nada  left literally 1 minute later  <EOR> Macayos would consider TexMex style Mexican food  comparable say nearby Bonito Michocan? No  Cantina Laredo  No  Cantina El Dorado?  No  Why? Because they're all different styles Mexican food  based state Michocan style food specializes organic other trendy Mexican place  apples oranges really    With said love all types Mexican food  mentioned think fare macayos considered TexMex think perfectly acceptable terms flavor  best Mexican food world but tasty consistent    What sets establishment apart Baja sauce  can't enough it    menu states spicy but beg differ   southwestern taste buds think nothing near spicy but some may consider mild  Only those w really sensitive taste buds would think spicy    My fave menu items include Baja burrito Baja chimi green chile burro enchilada sampler request shredded beef   green sauce tasty  Also fun request server put green sauce Baja sauce your burrito awesome taste experience    They service regular quality   last visit sat dining area bus person tray full chips salsa asking if anyone needed refills   first seen that nice touch improved customer service during dinner rush    I believe chain originally Arizona  restaurants outdoor seating slightly different menu but very similar   little bummed NV locations don't outdoor seating AZ counterparts <EOR> White washed Mexican food ? Yeah kind of  Your options already pretty limited Summerlin but any place unapologetically serves medium jarred Pace salsa store bought chips ranks pretty low revisit list   Lunch combos cheap menu lot choices  Stuck fairly safe options including chile relleno I liked sauce but pepper soggy no spice chicken enchiladas bland unmemorable rice beans did stand out    You worse Mexican food but also better    maybe getting margarita food more tolerable  If come back it'll HH  <EOR> I love Macayos  grew Vegas Macayos always special occasion  love chips salsa  hot sauce best tasting sauce ever  eat spoon chips gone  The California burrito best enchilada style  also heard seafood great   I've never disappointed going Macayos  <EOR> I've eating all life if could would rate 10 stars!! While your traditional Mexican food sure tasty!! sure try TCT your fellow patrons thank you  Enjoy!!! <EOR> It okay   Husband orered carne asada burrito    husband said tasted nacho cheese sauce used instead shredded cheese   Combo meal okay   chile rellano shredded beef sour cream green chile enchilada  <EOR> Good mexican food great price  family friendly environment sometimes little family friendly  service usually great served quickly  Recommend if having large event  <EOR> I didn't great experience but kinda wanna taco 'bout it  That Rachel  Fail #1 party 6 adults + baby shoved into half booth only probably comfortably seat 4  Then chair added other side table extra room  arrived few minutes everyone else would requested moved if drinks chips weren't already table  seating arrangement cluster  hardly any room ourselves let alone food  felt sardine wasn't even sitting booth  Everyone's elbows touching no room plates  Most ordered TCT which large tortilla cheese come round metal trays just no room all    Fail #2 server  He nice friendly but sucked serving  problem considering job  6 15  shouldn't hard  ask multiple times refills sides stuff ordered arrived etc  Food dropped off wrong person all quite annoying   Fail #3 food  start ordered baja sauce eat chips  baja sauce cream cheese jalapeno dip amazing  eat bland tortilla chips serve cause salsa serve actually just tomato sauce awful  Anyway sauce supposed come hot but arrived cold table  sent back right way asked made hot  weird because bowl came hot but dip not  If eat sure ask side that  entree ordered TCT shredded beef beans sour cream it  friend ordered TCT shredded beef sour cream but side  received TCT all toppings side  big deal but just another slight annoyance  TCT favorite thing just big ass tortilla cheese toppings  If best item damn tortilla cheese would say  problem   All all would say visit want come back ever again  sad! eating Macayo's years  If looking good Mexican food would say NACHO place  <EOR> I coming location over 5 years still love day  figured long overdue review  say lunch menu awesome quick Mexican restaurant staff super friendly  always come lunchtime because stay full until late hours night  say mex bowl today looked little less meat compared other bows but still filled up  dad enjoy coming because always love waiters waitresses  Hugo you're man! seen years always look your smile  major shout waiter today Charles! absolutely fantastic funny! Thank constantly checking us  Tip isn't 5 star gourmet Mexican cuisine just come enjoy food  Enchiladas always point no matter protein sauce get  <EOR> Not sure putting positive reviews   This place sucked  Service slow all friendly  chicken chimichanga made dried canned chicken bland rice side   girlfriend tacos she said made Taco Bell seem viable option next time we're seeking Mexican food  took bite agreed  <EOR> Great food!!!! Totally delicious food great prices  Seniors 20% off  Lunch best deals town 20% off deals  Never once bad meal everything ever tasted fabulous!!!! <EOR> How dare call mexican food  place disgrace Mexicans  didn't think ANYONE could mess taco but sure enough proven wrong  feel bad wait staff working here    it's fault food tastes inside gym shoe  only people would find food good people deprived authentic goodness mexican food really offer  <EOR> While recently Vegas decided back try old love  No strip club girlfriend Macayo's Mexican Restaurant   And just trying resurrect old flame fizzled extremely disappointing  Sometimes just better remember good times move on   Like love tastes change  love person matures other doesn't move forward  Macayo's just bland  No spice  No atmosphere  Baby you've lost loving feeling   Friendly service? Oh yeah   enthusiastic server? Oh yeah  But now place better suited those palates prefer plain  Period  <EOR> I've eating MacoVegas since 1974  never bad meal  abondagas soup best town! margaritas also best  I really wish would open new restaurant centennial area!!!! <EOR> Seriously AMAZING!!!!

Nice job Macayo's having BEST service staff seen long time!!!! <EOR> Food okay doesn't compare tp Lindo Michocan    Service okay waitress good customer service    Got food fast able eat without hassle   Recommend cheaper option Lindo Michocan  <EOR> Macayos Vegas institution  going overall since two  location 20 years    We're regulars know several staff name  Service sometimes hit miss but nothing ever driven away Macayos likely never will  <EOR> I parents other day because coupon   I ordered shrimp verde enchiladas  When arrived chicken  called waiter over told couldn't find any shrimp shrimp enchiladas  He apologized new order   which shrimp  enchiladas okay but probably wouldn't order again   My mom Baja enchiladas which she loved  dad also liked beef taco Baja burrito   We all chicken tortilla soup start which very good   I wasn't overly impressed meal but may just ordered wrong entree   The salsa served chips less stellar  <EOR> Great food!!! carnitas delicious!!! Quesadillas great!!! sampler plate appetizers yummy!!! Cool decor!! love here!!! <EOR> The food delicious just taste wanted   Baja sauce super flavorful   chimichangas shredded beef chicken rice beans   Rice super fluffy   Jay server really sweet talked history place talked Vegas   service 5 star quick  return when come back! <EOR> My friends Las Vegas area convention looking somewhere off strip eat  Lyft driver recommended Macayo's  little far strip but glad made 20 minute trip restaurant!  The server awesome  food delicious  price right! would definitely recommend establishment if looking some Mexican food definitely check place   4 5 stars  Great food  Good prices  Friendly service  Definitely way back  think would enjoyed restaurant more if weren't hurry back strip event  <EOR> My favorite Mexican restaurant! Others may more authentic but place hits spot  Service always great food delicious! can't happy hour food drink specials until 6pm either! Must try!!!! <EOR> My wife enjoyed chicken burrito but combo fajitas really flavorless  pieces chicken shrimp nice size pretty tender but beef particularly appealing  everything bland no real taste  Even onions peppers  whole dish just blah  <EOR> Waited bar half hour table which wasn't problem cause drinks good  Finally table but server very rude  simply asked what's good he replied the carnitas walked away  Thankfully chips salsa half hour wait food only server come back over tell tamales said else want decided leave  worked restaurants while chose pay penny experience  sure if another server would enjoyed everything but def won't returning <EOR> Great food  Comfortable atmosphere  Excellent service  Perfect big family meals  Love TCTs old Vegas favorite  <EOR> Second time coming still amazing food service  Linda great!!!   This time remembered order enchilada green sauce good flavorful  chicken taco light crispy overflowing inside stuff  rarely finish plate food but gone lol    Husband's beef fajitas smelled amazing usual all side fixings    Will returning! Consistency nice restaurant  <EOR> Ate few weeks back   rave chicken poblano totally delicious   If your fan chili relenos try version!  Nice decor friendly staff reasonable prices  <EOR> I really dislike restaurant  food flavorless waited really long time food which weird considering crowded  never tasted guacamole plain flavorless fajita ordered also less tasty   return even if free  <EOR> Worst taco ever ate  Tortilla very hard must cooked stored several days before filling meat lettuce   Won't going back    <EOR> This place reminds place las cruces NM called la posta! looks you're sitting inside someone's backyard eating drinking!   The food good but true Mexican food  think place more American Mexican food rather true hole wall Mexican food  waitress brought wrong order she sweet because she let keep meal anyway  You're seated your table then greeted bowl tostada chips salsa  Okay y'all salsa isn't true Mexican salsa  tastes pace salsa red sauce  salsas pico tried seeds charred pieces cast iron skillet taste homemade salsa pico    The amount food give very generous portions though  If appetizer HIGHLY suggest getting chicken wings! crispy nice crunch you're looking when eat wings!  first favorite  left 3 freaking to go boxes! looks didn't even eat! also deep fried ice cream dessert good! ball vanilla ice cream coated corn flakes honey mixture places flat cone plate  think would say second favorite because craving ice cream!  All all don't think place would first choice Mexican food  kind reminds Applebee's chili's Mexican food  <EOR> The food always great but every empty table dining room dirty wasn't busy   bathrooms clean though   Overall good experience  <EOR> I lived Los Angeles Chicago Dallas most life feel am good judge Mexican food   restaurant better many reviews but dead regard salsa   Bland isn't even adequate description tasteless red sauce   chips OK   Liquor isn't way judge restaurant but important tavern bar don't include evaluation   server Linda best had   glasses filled frequently Linda checking regularity   chicken Chicken Enchilada fresh properly prepared   enchilada itself could spicier but freshness made it   other dishes around table good but great   re fried beans good   rice average   nice restaurant less adventurous  <EOR> I going Macayo's since toddler  far favorite Mexican restaurant town tried almost all them    Parking pain location getting parking lot little dangerous but totally worth it!  The Sahara location always seems loud always parties going but doesn't take away atmosphere all adds it!   I loooove Tostada Del Mundo! best things menu! <EOR> After few visits family then family friends review time!  Overall could any number Mexican restaurants but giving fours stars few reasons   Read on     The food   tried two things menu both delicious Street Tacos carnitas choice meat Spicy Chilorio   street tacos flour tortillas instead corn but pleasant change   amount meat them very generous very delicious   stuffed very happy   Spicy Chilorio actually mild but still very delicious   definitely new favorite comfort food perfect tortillas side begging ordered chilly day   Fresh chips two kinds salsa enjoy while wait your food ordering everyone's orders came together very reasonable amount time     The staff   Both visits included incredibly nice staff person seated waiters waitresses took care table   know even best food served bad staff ruined    problem  great staff!  The decor   believe pretty standard chain but nice necessarily standard terms other Mexican restaurants   artwork painted walls instead just framed pictures very nice change pace   Everything also very clean good repair   Parking   There's lots parking around restaurant   Take note entrance west side building would thought front facing Sahara Blvd    Frankly entrance where more convenient relative where you'll probably park   Not much more say other definitely back regularly hope see too! <EOR> Macayo's oh Macayo's love MUCH   going Macayo's over 15 years life   When moved away very first place requested when off plane   grandma knew almost all staff which extremely friendly way!   My favorite thing bowl albondigas  soup large TCT *drool*   tried other things course such yummy cheesy enchiladas big tasty chimichangas rolled tacos   I never experienced bad soup chiladas TCT I'd say well over 200 times  pretty good record   must say though hence why minus star handful times when gotten chicken items find over cooked flaky   would say hit miss but other three items just cannot wrong     Hawg dawg now need some! D <EOR> Came across little gem when mother law ordered take them never ate then left behind her bad  look entree beef enchiladas rice beans treat  until put microwave heat layed down passed night  When woke next morning mad myself  long story short hunt location down because mother law didn't remember name restaurant  She did however remember whereabouts location  Didn't take long find them google search yelp investigation  ended ordering same thing missed DELICIOUS!!!!! husband chicken burrito he greatly satisfied well  All all worth hunt look forward trying them again  <EOR> So dissatisfied favorite restaurants! boyfriend regulars restaurant really taste Mexican    My Boyfriend wanted shrimp burrito but prepared fajitas green bell peppers red bell peppers grilled onions  He didn't want seasoning shrimp because he special diet diagnosed diverticulitis  He cannot eat anything seasoning seeds nuts  stomach can't handle it  taste nachos enchiladas  cashier taking order didn't want dine said she would Check cooks first see if could prepare boyfriends burrito without seasoning   manager eventually came over clarified could but checking see freezer she discovered running bell peppers only small amount green ones no red ones   run ? She said shipment would coming until next morning   couldn't believe but unfortunately ended leaving going down street Nacho Daddy  Unfortunate because food even comparable awful no flavor cold   All wanted favorite Mexican restaurant come through   <EOR> This go to place Tex Mex   lot reviews call Macayo's Americanized authentic  say yeah baby!   just want   soaked heat drenched lime juice loaded cilantro otherwise messed any myriad ways various Mexican restaurants around town found food damn near inedible taste   Just good solid flavors exactly expect each dish   despite iffy Yelp! reviews can't only because many decades place still packed   Tasty comfortable convenient cheap exactly Mexican place looking when moved Los Angeles  <EOR> I've coming Macayos all life favorite restaurants frequent Vegas valley  Mexican food pretty well  most often order fajitas share someone always delicious!   Lots complaints reviews chips salsa but personally love chips especially love smooth salsa  <EOR> Tried Mexican restaurant other night  always said need try because building attracted colors  The entrance doors strange feel doors enter club something  greeted nice lady soon entered restaurant  decided bar  The restaurant simple maybe plain opinion  Bar nothing fancy Happy Hour served 3pm 6 30pm  We ordered 3 items Happy Hour Menu  Jalapenos queso Mini Chimichanga beef chicken options side sour cream guacamole some Sonoran Wings  I little disappointed Jalapenos queso looked melted cheese wings OK spicy  Usually always finish wings but time  The salsa waiter brought wasn't home made We ordered Corona IceTea   I spent $15 price why am complaining about???  I added star because price mention service Excellent staff very nice well      I curious tried sure if eat again  <EOR> I've loyal patron Macyo's since before even born yet tonight rather disappointed margarita  tasted straight sweet sour mix  food always good but when Mexican restaurant can't margarita made right there's really big problem  <EOR> Well least Sahara location lot better then E Charleston location   servers nicer restaurant cleaner Happy Hour bar good <EOR> Well food wasn't horrible but wasn't best Mexican food either   didn't however find very dis tasteful when placed order ordered TCT carne asada street taco husband ordered plate tacos   When order came he brought two full orders tacos immediately explained only ordered 1 taco    He said don't worry won't charge whole plate just taco rice beans which ordered   said okay    ate only taco   He gave box take home rest    put away box neatly  He later came took box away said mistake can't give food point just waiting check    said don't mind paying it    He took anyway he toward front desk speaking cashier cashier proceeds tell now deducted other tacos order   said okay no worries aren't trying anything free pay fine    She replies took off   waiter again gives box food again!  said okay thank you    Then when pay cashier took hands says no took off  found miscommunication toward very rude offensive   offered pay food never gave option    food twice TWICE took away   does that!!! behavior am giving establishment bad rating   first time here    excited eat now never come back! food going trash   could just left alone acknowledged mistake let day   rude! Kyle waiter didn't catch cashiers name   calling manager well  <EOR> Haven't sincere early 90's  Now recall why    Flavorless run down needs updating <EOR> Always love Baja Beef enchiladas bean dip   best Mexican food city mean would insult Lindo's Roberto's even Juan's Flaming Fajitas but pinch does job   Service usually ok but something off last visit   No hostess station actual hostess   and people just standing around perplexed   waiting 5 minutes mind several waitresses waiters walked station them asked if anyone helped lady came over seated   found shortly seating she wasn't hostess only because hostess magically appeared berated lady seated RIGHT FRONT US   Way uncomfortable   Way   Hopefully just kurfunkel it'll different next time around because when need Baja Beef need Baja Beef  <EOR> My favorite place town hands down  eating since little  gone enough know service depends person but chips salsa oh word  could just eat those    My favorite thing tacos authenticos  split someone kinda built own tacos    To finish your meal recommend churros  prefect ending  French vanilla ice cream delicious top  <EOR> Love place!  Surprised see lot negative reviews   say some things menu  am crazy but think depends order   to's include spicy chicken wings which very flavorful spicy where can't enjoy it   give more enough lightly breaded your typical wings bar   blue cheese good nor ranch don't bother   sauce all need   shredded beef burrito enchilada style very good   more generous beef TASTY!  wife loves chips salsa but really don't salsa bland runny me   Now absolute MAIN reason TCT appetizer   die for   Personally just cheese only but put anything want meats source cream guac tomatoes etc   Just try cheese only dip smooth sauce give chips salsa   good!  Happy dining! <EOR> I love food especially chicken Baja burrito  Baja sauce outstanding! love refried beans  hard find good refried beans Vegas  favorite Mexican food   With being said biggest complaint chips salsa  same 15 years didn't then still don't it  But because food much keep going back    The atmosphere bit old school  but think does need some updating  used great coupons newspaper but stop doing quite some time ago bummer! don't nearly much  <EOR> I think last mediocre experience Macayo's last justify finding new restaurant   A friend location dinner recently   seated normal dining room section   and then left ten minutes   Well during time perused menu picked exactly wanted   When waitress finally approached table she took drink orders then left before could give appetizer entre order   She came back fairly quickly drinks took appetizer order then left again   As waiting appetizer order a cup queso dip heard approach recently seated people behind ask them drink order   woman indicated ready order food also she prepared take order   people seated us   point heard party behind inquire queso dip waitress responded girls over just ordered queso when done bring your table first see looks like  Really?  already waited long enough pretty hungry but wait longer bring item paying another table display reason?  She finally came back actual orders requsted grilled chicken quesadilla no peppers onions just chicken cheese   waitress asked me    don't want chicken normally prepare onions peppers? No just said didn't want that   When food came plate only quesadilla no sour cream no quacamole   nothing   stopped asked if she could bring side sour cream she says    thought when said no garnishes meant everything  Ok first off never said no garnishes  said didn't want onions peppers food   She also failed honor friend's request prepare enchilada extra sauce   I think just sick getting ready paying experience just mediocre   know quesadilla enchilada next time just stay home all myself  <EOR> The food mediocre worth high price  waiter rude bad attitude beginning  bus boys did most work best thing place  very disappointed back  <EOR> Stopped dinner food below average service  would liked desert but since waitress would required order luck she never showed again food served   After waiting forever check finally register asked if could pay    No tip left which rare me  <EOR> I really dislike Macayo's but mom loves birthday only reason step foot place anymore  Considering dead 6 30 guessing only fan  really no surprise Decatur location closed many good eats around willing bet they're hurting too   Every time come food just seems worse worse  chips usually decent but time around cold stale  wife ordered tortilla soup fajita quesadilla decided Baja chimi  If look photo see greasy soup fajita even worse   she picked piece completely soaked  Luckily she already filled stale chips TCT she didn't eat much  Baja chimi ok but tortilla also tasted stale say shredded beef lacks flavor putting lightly    If you're mood Mexican food don't waste your time Macayo's  much better places town many which same price even cheaper! only reason giving them two stars instead made pretty decent margarita waitress time around very friendly  food barely worth star until next birthday won't coming back! <EOR> This place around since high school food still same  Just good staple  give 5 stars consistency  <EOR> As born raised Las Vegan going Macayo's since kid  pretty much native's standard Americanized Mexican    My faves    Spicy Chilorio delicious mix creamy cheese chiles onions shrimp chicken  Served large helping beans side tortillas heartier more delicious chile con queso   Baja Chimichanga A huge chimichanga smothered ranchero sauce well classic sour cream based spicy Baja Sauce    While some locations closed over years menu slight tweaks Macayo still provides comforting taste grew with  <EOR> During visits location ordered dish but without chicken trying vegetarian diet time  waitress brings chicken  politely remind ordered without  She argues tells No ordered chicken! Shocked she's arguing incredulously reply vegetarian diet why would order chicken? She gave more attitude talked going back   A few months decided give location more chance  food terrible overcooked etc   asked swap entries  wife way back table bathroom overheard waiter making fun being picky  does that? such person even job waiter? Hopefully he job picking trash side road no longer works there  But we'll never know because never ever ever going back Macayo's   In summary poorly prepared food even worse service  Save yourself trip  If want know dining just stay home microwave burrito repeatedly smack yourself face it  <EOR> We friend's birthday she craving  two babies group which fine because seemingly family restaurant  needed change son but don't family restroom changing table bathroom  thought couldn't right but asking employee confirmed  ended having take son car cold night change him  None employees seemed care   After wonderful start dinner things didn't much better  chips didn't refilled neither did drinks  food OK best  server friendly but wasn't enough salvage night    This place used nice but no more  <EOR> I love place  grew coming Macyos since little  Use Charleston until close  Such great family place kids loud fun  started bring kids keep tradition alive  <EOR> I came while vacation because aunt grandma always come here  sat right away decor reminded favorite childhood Mexican restaurant   I love chips salsa but salsa good  Neither impressed me  chunky tasted Pace thin tasted enchilada sauce   We ordered chili queso dip good! ordered pollo con Espinaca which pretty good  Tortillas great beans rice average sauce amazing but actual meat wasn't  sauce would amazing if fresh grilled chicken breast but chicken tasted frozen precut strips lean cuisine meal  rubbery great    My dad fajitas said meat flavorful but veggies overlooked  personally soft veggies but each own!

They're very consistent dishes great wait staff  <EOR> This review regards takeout order  placing order 1 45 pm finally received order 2 20  Originally girl took order said would take 15 minutes  While overlooked delay cannot overlook awful customer service  Melissa H  called supervisor completely unreasonable no business current position  simple incorrect order turned into nightmare  When asked take person correct order blamed mistake met rolling eyes  When requested better customer service Melissa continued blame me  absolutely shocked she any authority Vegas classic Macayos  frequented location over 20 years consistently bring friends family here  However those days may behind if service fails improve  Melissa stated hurt ability train new employee but rather viewing situation harmful she should viewed learning opportunity  Melissa acted scorned teenager rather employee delivering customer service  together Macayos  <EOR> I've going Macayo's probably 30 years  love it  TCT extra yummy  usually shredded beef burrito enchilada style chicken fingers both delicious  also used gringo cheeseburger which always good well  husband loves Sonoran Wings spicy  <EOR> Macayo's serving most white washed Mexican food ever tasted  Bleh  food entirely bland lacked any distinguishing flavors  Let known choice eat first place  I blame husband feeding mediocre food!   CHIPS SALSA Chips average but goodness gracious watered down salsa worst to include store bought ever had  Zero flavor  basically red water  1 5  CALIFORNIA BURRITO $10 49 Way much sour cream forgettable every way  Presentation very boring well  1 5  BAJA BURRITO $10 99 husband said wasn't bad but agreed would coming back  3 5  SERVICE waiter bright spot visit  He kept refills cleared plates quick like  He also check ASAP when asked  Food jiffy seated right when walked in  4 5  ATMOSPHERE Kind sad nothing special  Decor drab layout weird  tried seat domed auditorium area A C fans blasting first  Nope happening  moved different section much happier  2 5  Return Visit?

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015 #33 <EOR> Very good food 130 pm Service very slow waiter forgot items then took extensive time bring table <EOR> Why many people hating Macayos? food awesome  service sucks!

If want tasty Mexican delights decent prices no big hurry spot  Word  Ole! <EOR> After waiting 15 minutes greeted server thought would suck patient  However worse! soup ordered layer grease top margaritas watered down cheap sour mix  Furthermore food came different times leaving kids without cold quesadillas  server far apologetic sorry came  always look positive though the salsa delicious  However safe say think stick other favorite Mexican spots next time  <EOR> Probably worst macayo's town food terrible <EOR> When visit Macayo's Mexican restaurant need understand Toasted Cheese Tortilla TCT serving them forty years if longer!  If want place where food bland great soup world best TCT then Macayo's if want heat other 1 260 Mexican joints valley! <EOR> Horrible service Happy Hour! met some friends happy hour last Friday not idea sadly disappointed  happy hour specials reduced priced drinks half off appetizers  problem 90 year old waiter huge difficulties taking orders getting them right  ordered drinks took forever receive even though sitting 5 feet away bar  walked bartender at bar point order another drink quickly told wait old man come back  appetizers ordered came sporadic order some never came all reorder  He even brought few didn't order  saw another table haggling waiter check he received well  need hire additional waiter bar area during happy hour find multitask efficiently  group 10 people took 3 hours 10 drinks 5 appetizers    On side note food mediocre best  <EOR> This first Mexican places tried right moving Vegas years ago  where many different locations but Sahara we'd visit most    One reasons coming back Baja sauce love everything  usually Baja chimi  your choice meat usually shredded  Always tender good flavor  rolled flour tortilla then fried smothered chili relleno sauce finally topped Baja sauce  also sour cream guacamole top off    Usually thing bit soggy time reaches table only ends still bit crisp  But really don't mind come Baja sauce!    You alone rice beans both husband's choice fries! end less bowl chips two red salsa chunky bit smoky  top off sopapillas butter honey!   I thought service attentive prices fair flavor food worthy another visit  best tasting food category no but can't Baja sauce! <EOR> Never bad service here  Never bad meal here  Baja burritos sh*t  Carne asada carnitas always cooked order here  <EOR> Bottomless chips salsa amazing margaritas amazing food! If am craving Mexican food place never disappointed  am super picky always order just way asked  Amazing place! <EOR> The service nice but food simply inedible  Don't it  If want cheap tasty Los Tacos Sahara  If want best price issue Lindo Michoacan Desert Inn  only authentic 5 star Mexican Las Vegas  <EOR> I torn between 2 3    2 doesn't mean never come back but does mean food quality prefer sit down Mexican restaurant   those casual eateries where food slightly better fast food joint but totally unpleasant  chips very pedestrian  salsas could made canned tomatoes   If friend wanted stop I'd ok but if wanted nice evening wouldn't place   Other food ambience casual comfortable everything clean waitstaff attentive friendly  <EOR> Such Vegas staple!
