*BE AWARE* For starters am avid Indian food lover travel India quite often friends family there  love culture plethora cuisine different regions India offer  MANY Indian places tried throughout Las Vegas Taste India WORST facility ever tried  many reasons why   First foremost food   As entered place almost completely empty only other table occupied  they family business   chose table walked over scan buffet quickly very surprised saw  isle food great selection choose but just basics such chicken korma tikka masala jeera rice etc  All food saw looked incredibly unappetizing  should left right then but wanted give benefit doubt  BIG MISTAKE  I noticed food almost no touched literally caked sides metal bins sitting in  All food above temperature basin therefore dried sitting most likely HOURS  All condiments sitting melted ice looked just thrown bin  also couple flies sitting them  utterly disgusted   At point really wanted feed insatiable need Indian food personally would feel quite bad If just left new business  stupid choice made  I decided tikka masala palak paneer some rice   I cannot even describe bad excuse Indian food was  First all food tried UNDER PROPER TEMPERATURE  chicken tikka masala tasted mixed canned tomatoes chicken  horrible room temperature  palak paneer even melted properly spinach almost separated unknown sauce consisted of  this?!  The rice flavorless mushy but clumping together  means chances rice RECYCLED  no means fresh  Everything tasted very bland  I ordered naan garlic plain  looked very fresh when guy brought but then noticed still very doughy  even done baking all way! I started become very weary food front slowly scooping bite minutes apart then just giving up  even half hour later started feel effects FOOD POISONING  Sure enough was  really sick throughout day vomiting profusely  very ill next few days unfortunately    Overall food horrible selection Indian food  quality far sorry excuse representing Indian cuisine people INDIAN! could better Indian dish home Italian! am surprised health department shut down place improper food temperatures  People should eating reason alone   I could horrible restaurant but feel people should aware places care more money quality food misrepresenting Indian cuisine all about  place shame  never again  <EOR> Ordered off grub hub phone both restaurant grub confirm did desert ordered which fine did offer alternative  When 40 minutes past estimated delivery time past called restaurant  seemed no idea why food said would check into it   10 minutes later no response called back no answer next three times  phone grub hub now hour past delivery time when delivery showed up  informed confused because they've never delivered before  paid collected food  food arrived luke warm mediocre  specified instructions would dishes extra spicy  actually really bland which disappointing considering much husband love Indian food  portions small rice paid extra almost non existent flavorless  First time ever received disappointing  white rice  extremely upset considering cost which expected when ordering Indian cuisine worth it  never order again  <EOR> The best Indian Restaurant casino city! menu wide range items both North Indian South Indian!
