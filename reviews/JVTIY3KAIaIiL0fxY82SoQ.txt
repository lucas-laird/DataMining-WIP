I ordered truffle mushroom burger  portion size actually small palm size but surprisingly packed flavor juicy  lacked staff made flavor    They literally cash register open person getting food orders ready   Surprisingly efficient but still took forever order since stand line wait your turn    The menu overhead counter  Unless perfect vision and or 7 feet tall wouldn't able see menu decide ahead time until counter  just made line much slower    The prices bad  Two burgers two fries sweet potato fries came $31+  <EOR> Located Rio across Chippendales show  first past winter really liked when came back made sure stop place again  burgers great fries awesome! If you're Rio check out  <EOR> Very disappointed Burger way overcooked fries hot fresh  location just ran very well  <EOR> Wow place destined rest failures location  Literally 8 9 employees working empty restaurant when arrived  Ordered two simple burgers which correct second which grilled onions mustard ONLY!! Came extra ketchup lol  Sent back new while 7 8 employee's stood around talking texting  worse supervisor stood around chit chatting employees  shame burgers just okay  <EOR> Not worth $8 burger $5 50 more fries  Salad isn't bad but many seeds  think place way overrated  <EOR> Burger far dry  tasteless patty totally unseasoned tastes leather  Salads far small prize charge  Couldn't feed bird lol  Thanks but no thanks  Next time rather starve  <EOR> Was Vegas 4 days 3 nights visited Smash burger last night  customer service excellent  Everyone very personable  Prices great food lets just say really enjoyed great taste flavored just right  did tell staff pleased were  Gonna visit Vegas again soon  staying Rio same staff  Great Job guys continue it  <EOR> How 20 minute wait plain hotdog bun?

Burger patty flat didn't even come close fitting bun   Seasoning burger patty left much desired   Fries underwhelming  Overpriced quality food  If you're looking burger joint place! <EOR> Had guacamole bacon combo first visit smash burger  fries special seasoning which would've better without it  entree free thanks deal app where entree free purchase order fries drink which saved $9  meal overall decent but don't fooled nice appearance restaurant still fast food quality  Decent burgers  fries just whatever  best spot but probably best option low cost meal area  <EOR> Average burger Rio hotel but given price bad option  burger feta cheese without bun pretty good but nothing memorable    Price around $10 believe  <EOR> This first time trying smash burger given wanted quick good food cheap Vegas perfect fix  classic Smashburger great definitely try Smashburger again future  <EOR> We time crunch needed something quick could line show  Despite staff being loud unprofessional liked cheeseburger fries   Staff very loud seemed clueless used harsh language when customers earshot  <EOR> Nice see Smashburger Rio since no longer near home  big Sin City burger fried egg bacon grilled onions onion strings  first rate  David usual big classic smash complained seemed smaller before  Maybe just enough toppings  Tots nice addition menu good  Wish closer home  <EOR> Stopped doing Voodoo Zipline Ride Rio   The service friendly helpful Khalilah took order  ordered spicy Baja grilled chicken  He ordered classic smash burger spicy fries   We took seats waited food  food arrived less 5 minutes  group seven  all enjoyed burgers  fries skinny salty  <EOR> Food very good possibly best burgers had  didn't wait long food all even though sit down restaurant service staff excellent  Everyone friendly attentive! <EOR> Some friendliest service received trip Vegas  woman country smiling kind happy explain certain parts menu offer suggestions   I opted big smash Burger smash fries  burger solid  Probably 3 3 5  better most fast places  meat slightly charred but overly crispy  bacon cooked perfectly haystacks great  egg unfortunately cooked over hard  didn't ask sunny side but didn't asked preference sure if typically this  fries ok  Good flavor but fan shoe string fries  <EOR> I'll try give place benefit doubt  More less leaning towards 3 5 stars solely because convenience pricing   When staying RIO lot food options don't open until 4pm lame generally limited your options unless offsite room service etc  Plus when you're Vegas more just couple days appreciate aren't going pay small fortune eating Smashburger    I classic smash fries  fries   I'm sorry folks awful  Cold   pre frozen flavorless   The burger itself wasn't bad  house sauce tasty just perfect amount  Beef patty decently seasoned toppings fresh  If eat again I'd just order something without fries no biggie  cool thing place receipt held code $2 off your next purchase within few days time which suppose nice    This place nothing write home am little sad didn't really options outside burger but can't really complain when full meal under $15  <EOR> I enjoyed food  bacon avocado burger  Scrumptious!
