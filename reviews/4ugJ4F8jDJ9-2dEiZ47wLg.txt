This go to place date night   friendly smiling hostess waiter service five stars   Hubby date night hanging Onyx bar listening awesome live music which also located inside Red Rock Casino ready dinner   seated immediately no wait!  Menu incredible lots offerings  Since down few cocktails tell hubby did all ordering   started off some lobster tacos which incredible   Tasty little yummy treats plenty chunky lobster bites   Next ordered some shrimp mushrooms   mmmmm then some thin slices beef seared over hot stone!  Some miso soup cold beer also order   I back! <EOR> I've review backburner while guess finally come back it   Mind ate Hachi back while ago when Happy Hour still effect   So   I think late last year   Reason because staying hotel $50 food credit could use during time   thought would good idea Happy Hour try lot little   ended being so so   Hachi Japanese Sushi restaurant located Red Rock Hotel Casino one fave stay cation places    really only small handful places sushi corner Summerlin area   Naturally lot folks end sushi fix   would think Hachi would step game bringing some premiere eats   really only give place 'average' when taking food value   Food ok value greatest   guess because markup when restaurant hotel   But kind money spend Hachi could almost full meal another fine dining restaurant Red Rock T Bones   Yes possible especially if carried away Hachi ordering multiple signature rolls nigiri sashimi cocktails   Watch cash!  Back when visited did menu where 38 things under $8   wifey concocted entire meal $50 food credit   several tapas sized dishes cocktail two dine on   Bad thing don't recall everything right now   five six different dishes when consider drinks tax tip right above $50 food credit mark paid $65 total $50 food credit + $15 pocket    Very good cheap date night dinner!  Here's remember did have Crispy Spicy Rock Shrimp chipotle aioli Hachi BBQ Baby Back Ribs crispy noodles butter lettuce Vegetable Tempura including pumpkin onion asparagus avocado zucchini broccoli shiitake mushroom LSD Roll spicy shrimp crab tempura flakes avocado spicy ginger mayo  The LSD Roll kinda 'meh'   tasted more shrimp anything else   stars night Crispy Spicy Rock Shrimp Hachi BBQ Baby Back Ribs   Those ribs tasty!  Sweet little bit heat but definitely some Asian flair   guess might some hoisin ponzu BBQ sauce   Cooked just right fall off bone but soggy   shrimp great well aioli   chipotle gave some oomph accompanied tender fried rock shrimp     Reason remember having review because recently thought eating Hachi again when noticed rid touted 38 under $8 menu   new menu now?  Some changes some additions but definitely bit heavier price   Also noticed place just wasn't busy past   Prices definitely affect traffic especially dank economy   ended just eating food court instead   But give them some HOTTIE hostesses!  wifey merely just glanced   Glanced   But hot   Yes hot   Hachi restaurant?  Lately hot  <EOR> Top 3 things Hachi Famous Joey ask your waiter! Asian pear drink amazing LSD sushi roll <EOR> Slow service plus just ok food   Spent $80+ baileys jack ginger 2 sushi rolls edamame   Marijane roll dry didn't taste fresh    edamame took 20 30 minutes come out   worth $$   decor course beautiful but possible fabulous decor food service else where  <EOR> After disappointing dinner night before different Red Rock restaurant hoping just satisfied   Hachi delivered then some   large group back rooms   wait staff very attentive suggestions sakes beers spot on   started mixed green salad which crisp cool very nice   then shared variety rolls including spicy tuna pink elephant favorite qualude  loaded salmon jalapeno avocado   For entree chose chicken yakisoba noodle dish   enjoyed lot but full salad sushi couldn't eat much it  colleague next seared beef tenderloin medallion said amazing  sure looked good!  dessert all shared chocolate fondue   wrong warm melted chocolate?
