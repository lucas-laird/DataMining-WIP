Overall very mediocre Armenian Middle Eastern Mediterranean restaurant     The staff very friendly atmosphere very Armenian definitely points ambiance   The food sadly nothing write home about   beef kabob dry chewy chicken kabob while very tender almost zero flavor   The hummus mutabel also quite run mill   We still haven't found great middle eastern joint Vegas yet very much hoping would place  <EOR> Excellent food beautiful interior good music! LOVE kabobs! Another A+++++ <EOR> *Dated 1 23 12*  Located Decatur Obannon next Trader Joe's Royal Cuisine offers your basic kebabs hummus mutabel babaganush well some other offerings such sturgeon Basturma Sugux think dry salami sausages    Also noteworthy menu Armenian based hence sturgeon Basturma Sugux    Upon entering double iron ? doors reveals surprisingly roomy kitschy brightly lit interior  Armenian staff very friendly helpful answer any questions may menu   Prices very affordable ranging $8 99 $15 99 main courses comes huge portions   sampled lamb chops combo platter again served huge portions almost family style size  lamb chops very tasty well seasoned   combo platter very generous although found pork chop over cooked dry otherwise chicken lamb very well made   try eggplant caviar homemade pickles serve there   dessert suggest homemade baklava which overly sweet does medicine taste other restaurants  bill appetizer two entrees dessert came under $34   Overall food good service kind slow but expected new restaurant   hope work some bugs seeing just opened quite recently   In glut Mediterranean restaurants Las Vegas Royal Cuisine gives more bang your buck  <EOR> This place really gem! Honestly expecting much its location but once walked place really nice   suitable even somewhat formal smaller events gatherings  really should try hummus it's really good grainy! All dishes ordered seemed very fresh server wonderful  If you're near don't pass up  <EOR> This wonderful restaurant   decor gorgeous did all themselves   some pleasant Russian music playing food amazing   only did taste good very affordable   chicken kabobs rice house salad topped off Baklava   would highly recommend venue! <EOR>
