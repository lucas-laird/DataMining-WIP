Come hungry! Leave happy! Awesome place never seen fine sushi restaurant!!! <EOR> All food great but could really some improvements when comes service  last night dinner friends  Host nice greeted door  15 minute wait before sat  bar completely empty around 7 pm  When asked if could just sit bar since all doing AYCE she told entire bar area reserved big party  party didn't even show until little past 9  floor three waitresses tending all tables once  them came greet take drink orders another came right after  Being waitress myself know most restaurants waitresses divide tables into sections  first things ordered soft shell crab tempura  20 mins asked waitress if kitchen possibly forgotten order she said takes longer would ready soon  Ok understandable  But another 25 30 mins still come yet  When asked another waitress took order she said she would check it  didn't come until pretty much full ready order dessert  know definitely forgot ring in  Also took forever refills waters  waitress came take sushi orders again she only took mine then left immediately without even looking other friends asking if wanted anything else  Overall food great said but really need step game service especially semi busy night last night  Maybe three waitresses floor isn't quite enough? <EOR> This favorite AYCE joints Vegas  Ahi Poke great flavor  Nice spicy You order much want  limited order per person few other items yellowtail jalapeño sashimi other sashimi dishes   The quality fish going measure Nobu Katsuya barMASA  Obviously!

Doh management please give your staff tools need exceed guests expectations  <EOR> 12 21 15 Christmas date boyfriend la carte orders  Spicy tuna rolls 3 5 5 My boyfriend ordered since big fan sushi  Based he says 'good but enough ' When asked wasn't enough he simply said little rice enough filling  order came 8 pieces   Calamari Tempura 4 5  Nice warm  really sauce tempura  Minus cause according BF lacks salt   Bulgogi 4 5 really enjoyed one  boyfriend said personally 4 stars because bit soggy but think tapas did lot flavor bit kick although looked little dry first   Shrimp skewers 3 5 5 both  He thought greasy but dry  personally love shrimp but wasn't anything special one   Pork Katsu 2 5 Breading falling off one  some point whole side came off Katsu really dry  But fair sauce super good despite made lot better    Miso soup 4 5 salty enough boyfriend but he does love miso soup 4 5 is  took looooongest time come out    Service 1 5  okay brutally honest service sucked  waitresses spoke quietly if all other waiter initially took orders completely ignored altogether  Hardly anyone checked except maybe once twice while grabbing dirty dishes  miso soup     Never came until he asked waitress 10 minutes finished rest food?  Also while ordering waiter polite all  literally ask ourselves check 10 minutes finishing everything  what's that?  TLDR Food decent price paid but food servers ourselves service needs definitely reevaluated   boyfriend outright refused tip just bad service he doesn't want back  <EOR> Not impressed all  fiending sushi friends suggested Doh because new restaurant she wanted try out  restaurant nice open clean  AYCE sushi price same most others town sushi okay  horrible but great either    Service pretty nice but bit awkward  very knowledgeable  friend asked Dr  Pepper when servers took drink orders  She left came back tell didn't any Dr  Pepper  friend asked Pibb she check see if well   When she came back she suggested ginger ale   because most obvious substitute? Also girls bringing food didn't know half rolls were    Down biggest problem Doh CONSISTENCY  Although presentation very appetizing dishes huge problem consistency  stand garnishes way plate same dishes different but food should always stay same  Some rolls ordered liked did taste good when ordered secondary roll  also ordered buttered scallops literally every single piece varying textures  wasn't going eat anymore first piece way soft fell apart but friend said all different  didn't actually believe until kept popping them into mouth discovered right she was    All all Doh okay restaurant  much better AYCE sushi places town same price Doh unless dragged back wouldn't again  <EOR> Service slow  Water glass empty  sushi fresh but doesnt taste good  sauce over powers sushi  <EOR> Simply great Sushi Services  loved everything  place  Now its new favorite  spot    <EOR> Terrible service oily food  write down wanted menu give order hostess  Never received order time  Servers never came check ask busboy check drinks  way gave tip busboy  Most dishes salty n over cooked  recommend place  <EOR> I loved service kind children attentive  Korean BBQ bulgogi Aria Roll supa spider roll Vegas roll pink lady   2 orders gyoza steamed fried  delicious second trip here  Everything made order  <EOR> This place far best all eat sushi Las Vegas  best priced all eat think 20 lunch 23 dinner fish all super fresh perfect no bad cuts meat  just good melt your mouth cuts  I definitely would recommend place anyone <EOR> Absolutely love sushi here! always point  come lunch dinner all eat which reasonably priced  only reason didn't give them all 5 stars because service little better  servers nice no doubt but confused orders couple times  reorder miso soup twice before finally brought out  sister also ordered never even brought out  She just gave reordering hers  first time happened assumed because only server even though extremely slow next time happened bit busier but still busy most sushi restaurants to  Long story short still mixed orders  still recommend place delicious! <EOR> I came boyfriend's family birthday  originally going eat Goyemon but busy  decided come since bf's parent here  When called said no wait    The food different compared Goyemon course didn't sushi fix  food more tapas compared sushi  rolls don't rice which cool  Most dishes seemed more Korean  Some food bit over cooked well    The workers didn't really pay attention even though restaurant wasn't busy  Many workers sitting phones eating bar  workers also chatting another  didn't take away empty dishes know where place new dishes  track down workers if wanted order   Honestly surprised customer service bad  liked food first but while seems isn't much eat everything same  <EOR> I just ate lunch  21 95 all eat sushi off menue sushi costs 11 per roll  place quite clean since new everything looks nice stylish  its fairly large space sushi restaurant thats pluss if want lot folks meet somewhere sushi might good place  sat sushi bar wasnt very crouded hour arived chef Alan?  think name chef sat near able give lot individual attention order recomending items talking design menu  very entertained sushi all quite nice pretty  <EOR> This place claims all eat but warned sashimi lovers only order serving per person sashimi ordered salmon came three tiny very dissapointing    Its first time all eat restrictions food! understand would pay if dont eat everything order but restrict people order stuff nah!

I running around town family tow since off hour decided try out   The interior frankly shocking  antiquated library meets formal study  Lots wood work molding everywhere  Love interior design  Spacious open  Full sushi bar back   Very nicely designed   When asked quiet but polite server some questions space she politely responded she didn't know   We ordered up! did fare?  As far highlights lows    The seafood ramen rich generously portioned  The breaded chicken just awful  Seriously awful  Dry chewy tasted frozen hour ago  Bulgogi spot on  the okonomiyaki such bastardized version real honest to Japan messy goodness made feel sad  pizza version  Everything else pretty average aka forgettable    The general rule doh seems Korean dishes above average but Japanese ones just wacky poor execution   A lot dishes needed come when done ensure hot but since timing kitchen off server waiting few take some dishes cold!  Now music  Yes music  Clearly someone's iPod shuffle  Now before slammed anything really kpop jpop  Super junior GG beast etc  But playlist would play English song quietly followed three really loud Korean songs    Then 3pm weekday family pleasure listening some song Nikki Minaj Eminem featuring F bombs lots colorful language  Awkward   It took long time all food very few people restaurant  Not mention customers arrived sandwiched all row huge restaurant  Come spread bit!

Food quality food good but little underwhelmed  sushi snob but just few things off  Apps spicy garlic edemame neither spicy nor very garlicky disappointed  Cooked tender though! The screaming o sashimi love good screaming o  sauce supposed everything but unfortunately didn't enough just didn't pack enough punch expect sauce  fish quality great however! The rolls WTH Something Wrong Screaming O Rock Roll Fire Hole  Again sushi snob but none rolls wowed me  quality good but flavored lackluster  example Something Wrong roll if say spicy garlic ponzu sauce expect experience other restaurants type sauce sauce just slap across face flavor but didn't that enough sauce didn't deliver flavor  Screaming O roll hopes would sashimi both sauce quantity punch again let down  Dessert miffed didn't plum ice cream  Some weird excuse fridge wasn't working blah blah blah but vanilla? Odd  settled strawberry mochi which ended forgetting ordered ask them again  banana dream yummy! Should've ordered instead  A few pluses Baked Mussels DELICIOUS! Tender came hot right amount mayo sauce! definitely ordered seconds these! Nigiri Super white garlic tuna yummy! Good rice fish ratio  Nacho Daddy probably favorite thing here  Just right amount spicy tuna crab copious amounts sauce all layered nacho! more could want?! only criticism would should sub store bought nacho homemade perhaps fried wonton  But still great!

Why did come here?! way Mr  Tofu when lady told try Doh because food really good    I definitely regret decision  AYCE review perhaps may better experience   tried items tapas menu   portion sizes joke price quality presentation   regular tapas size most appetizers   ordered okonomiyaki bulgogi galbi Korean ramen kim chee fried rice   okonomiyaki only dish okay terms flavor but no way amazing   seemed lot Korean pancake disguised Japanese dish  ordered regular honestly cannot imagine small tapas portion would be   regular kim chee fried rice came size small rice bowl   and pretty much lacks any real flavor   also ordered galbi regular size tapas bulgogi    but when arrived both same size dish   Very sketchy when brought server he seemed kind confused wasn't sure if regular tapas size   really wasn't rocket science literally 3 small slices beef dish    He back kitchen confirmed made mistake   He then tell received regular size bulgogi he would allow keep it   very generous you?!  regular size bulgogi dish size hand    and small hands   regular galbi finally came regular size portion should be   clearly waiter didn't really favor bulgogi   Perhaps should just own your mistake   However definitely galbi just kalbi cut off bone really wasn't tender flavorful  Korean ramen looks instant ramen fancy pot bowl    pretty lame  Being Korean run establishment    you would think would Korean food better   better Korean food food court   Way better Korean options Vegas   even same plaza   positive did decor restaurant   But overall server just awkward really friendly knowledgeable  Hiring teenagers don't really care jobs bad idea business  no plans return  satisfied meal grab snack elsewhere afterwards    <EOR> Doh okay  Sushi kind small but tapas really good! Pork bulgogi beef bulgogi tapas personal favorite  If you're salmon lover am unfortunately aren't many specialty rolls salmon  Just nigiri sashimi   A couple friends came Tuesday night around midnight service pretty good  server let order many rolls! Sometimes tapas would take forever come sometimes came fast   But hey happens   Last bit advice  Definitely if you're budget ordering AYCE  wasn't really anything menu stood AMAZING  <EOR> Doh offer some new sushi rolls without rice  sushi ok but much rice compared other AYCE sushi places  appetizers some great korean Japanese tapas  services very slow  Overall food bad! <EOR> I'm huge all eat sushi fan but place great  Rice sushi ratio bad places pack rice condensed astroids  only gripe service very lacking takes long time someone service you  Because give them stars  <EOR> If AYCE sushi buffet simply offered fresh fish all usual suspects rolls would automatically 3 4 stars few years ago   But fortunately people LV isn't case anymore since many spots stepped game post Goyemon     While service atmosphere good hot rice some weird interpretations think Japanese fusion missteps biggest reasons won't returning customer    Getting into details    know expect authentic cold well seasoned sushi rice AYCE but straight cooker bad  menu okonomiyaki that   eaten hundreds okonomiyaki far whackest all   Ketchup top?  consistency crepe?  Everyone sells roll called something wrong    Maybe should call something wrong pancake   put deep fried shrimp head into miso soup   Try having fly well native Japanese my wife   Amaebi terrible   drenched thing sauce then put tobiko top   assume just way covering something else  Steamed pork belly weird   Koreans eat way?   steaming high end bacon   And finally sushi roll peanut butter it   typo   mind's telling nooooo  but BODY   While respect them trying push fusion envelope terrible   Peanut butter avocado shrimp tempura crab fried coconut top tastes would imagine would   don't understand why thought would good   If wanted extreme whole roll way   Pork belly beef would better choices combine PB shrimp then just put Cheetos all over mofo     Tetsuro P  saw checked stopped say hello which cool   He asked if doing authentic just said no without going into any detail since right front sushi chef     Not say complete loss some good parts   bomb which wrapped avocado decent   waitress mainly recommended Korean dishes bulgogi skewers which skipped since plans eat Korean next day   also enjoyed yellowtail jalapeno   But won't enough come again   would Umiya both Korean owned over any day week  <EOR> I confess never eaten sushi until tried Doh Sushi 7 15 16   am fan! son took dinner great find Spring Mountain  am fan parking lot really hard find place park!
