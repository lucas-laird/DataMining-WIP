Taco Bell fast food restaurant  just can't resist chalupa supreme oh prefer them much more Del Taco  Usually your orders correct never skimp sauce napkins  love that  Hate other fast food restaurants don't supply those things unless ask stingy napkins    This location pretty good  Today forgot tacos disappointing  Yes only $1 taco but doesn't want order correct? Plus drive thru attendant wasn't very friendly bit weird  He asked see ID credit card totally understandable but then meticulously checked ID point where felt he thought thieves  Usually quick check name ID photo comparison does trick but nope he did more that  Just strange  Didn't help he didn't use meticulousness check order correctness  Yeah probably back because love some Taco Bell but probably double check order next time around  <EOR> The Six Shrimp Taco meal came total 10 shrimp    Every order before 5 every order mine 3 wrong except one    They fixed mistakes multiple wrong orders but good Taco bell though clean  <EOR> 24 hours always hit super polite customer service!
