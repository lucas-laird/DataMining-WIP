Thanks great experience  <EOR> It's airport food  come expect much when dining McCarron  typical experience held true  overly clean pieces dried food left silverware case well silverware napkins under clean table no real sense anyone cares there  But guess when captive audience why try?  The positives experience food Mediterranean influenced grilled chicken salad very tasty  chicken dry but flavorful kalamata olives sliced very tiny but plentiful dressing light texture  All over great value quality location $11   husbands pepperoni pizza also nice surprise  pepperoni bit zing cheese sauce seemed fresh taste  both water found odd both glasses came zero ice    Our server pleasant while service wasn't terrific she sure better some service airports   So money considering location I'd suggest trying it  also advertise dessert tiny doughnuts both chocolate raspberry dipping sauces  sounded delish but didn't partake  <EOR> If guys back would quit talking REALIZE work restaurant located airport    wouldn't take 15 minutes meal!!! When 4 people entire restaurant <EOR> This great pizza place airport  pizza made fresh right front you  pineapple bacon boyfriend goat cheese added chicken very delicious  <EOR> I really enjoying in airport Sammy's until bill   server Alicia really friendly attentive efficient   flight delayed 6 hours wasn't leaving until 1AM she very kindly said could table until 12AM     Our pizza New Yorker really good Islander cocktail   Unfortunately no prices cocktail menu   pizza seemed reasonably priced $14 00 given airport restaurant but really surprised when cocktail cost $15 70   good but particularly large   felt bit ripped off   So all all very good service very good pizza but overpriced cocktails   wife's glass wine $16 50 guess off easy   Caveat emptor  <EOR> This overpriced crap   pizza bland tasteless terrible consistency  lobster bisque zero lobster it   paid $35 person didn't even drink alcohol   place   Terrible  <EOR> Meh know airport food came low expectations but Sammy's able meet even level   The kitchen kind slow   When BBQ chicken pizza came would say pre made crust mediocre toppings thrown burnt pizza   All chicken cilantro onion stacked middle pizza   also sat next server station extra joy hearing servers complain each other slow was   On plus side server friendly while she table checked back twice   Diet Coke kicked instead making wait them change she grabbed bottle charged fountain price nice touch! <EOR> It's kind unnecessary review airport restaurant but consider public service announcement   Sammy's open later nearly every other food option D waitresses really cheerful   great  Kobe sliders brutally bad though  hyperbole say same quality beef available across way Burger King  find hard believe Kobe any Kobe like beef seemed any low quality supermarket frozen beef patty  non alcoholic drinks $4   BK Port Subs aren't good choices but they're no worse Sammy's  <EOR> Typical travel style airport EARLY TSA lines hassle waiting plus love airports shopping !!

Maybe little gestures but  just it! LITTLE gestures long way  She almost made uncomfortable way she stared while ordered  sitting next couple also heard complain busser came took plate away before asking if he finished which he wasn't asked side dishes back  side note overheard waitress chatting bitterly host nearby server station don't know doing messing schedules am guessing some management issues  FOOD food wine ordered however delicious! ordered small Chardonnay to try good ordered bigger that  What? wasn't flying plane   also ordered New York Style pizza yum status  bit bummed didn't Gluten Free crust options heard other Sammy's but figured maybe due airport location size menu etc  actually didn't feel bloated sick eating crust most often pizza dough happy camper  scarfed whole thing down along wine hopped onto plane home    So  why 3 stars   If experience Christmas ized food gift Santa service visit Grinch!  ***Wish Sammy's Phoenix!!! <EOR> Omg amazing food inside airport?!
