Finally answer phone then proceed tell driver scared come back house actual words he said dark he felt uncomfortable then manager added store close all all pizza cannot delivered  understand manager cannot child driver deliver pizza if he claims uncomfortable still want pizza decide down myself now LEAST 20 minute late pizza mmm yum  Plus it'll nice put face driver must 12 yrs old  I no front when KNEW coming! literally waited three minutes before driver noticed customer front all he did call manager back back  Guess what? He looked 35 years old the I'm really trying curse throughout review but am LIVID  manager comes looking he's now scared way guy looks around 18  he's young manager but he obviously lacking confidence intelligence whole scenario having him  I'm just wondering few things  why jobs all would mean though driver really needs look into new job if he can't drive normal looking neighborhood night definitely poor choice career  But also wondering why no checking front more frequently extremely easily accessible donation jar reach entire time  Someone could easily walk walk out  Why phone calls weren't answered until almost closed actually definitely calling longer 15 minutes  actually did ask why never answered phone response he counting inventory walk in  KIDDING ME!? Your phone ringing repeatedly during span few minutes really aren't going stop answer?? if couldn't hear your employee couldn't tell phone ringing REPEATEDLY!!!!!!??!!?!??!???!?!?!! WHY HELL TWO ONLY ONES STORE FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?!?!??

Ill back sure  <EOR> I ordered simple online order tonight 5 58pm  Typical online responses through online system  watched online tracker intermittently    6 49 driver departs delivery  7 30 getting knock  No big deal  Until he hands pizza box cool touch almost soggy box bottom   beyond annoyed  Remember avoid Noid!  Nope wasn't avoided  worse part all calling manager  Getting nonchalant response sent over top   felt he couldn't cared less  offer send another pizza  Thanks but no thanks  don't time  stores second shot success  failed Dominos  <EOR> These clowns sent burnt brownies  wish when ordered online would stated employees clowns  hope enjoy burnt brownies  <EOR> First time ordering chain pizza delivery since moved Las Vegas am very satisfied purchase! searched couple other local chain pizza deliveries but did service area  am happy Domino's delivery options because am extremely satisfied  late night craving pizza around 9 30 pm able order delicious customized pie dominos  Within 25 minutes pizza hand  found online pizza tracker useful found quite accurate  pizza came exactly ordered extremely delicious satisfying  would suggest dominos any locals area  Next time need pizza delivery location to  Thanks!

Ordered pizza last night n didn't delivered until 45 min left store it  What's point hanging tracker if you're going take forever?? doesn't take 45 min dominos apartment  takes 10 min!!! Then when ask delivery guy what's going on? He said long story    acceptable? No  When called store speak someone pizza being late didn't even care  All said don't know why he's late   he should any minute  No sorry anything that  just unbelievable nobody cares customer service  never order again!!
