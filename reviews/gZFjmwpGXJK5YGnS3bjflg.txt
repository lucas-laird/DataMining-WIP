A Family Board Game Store which highly recommend visiting     When first walked into Port Subs if ALREADY doing asking much  two young men short frumpy girl glasses working floor  girl nonchalantly posted against wall young man serving Mother young daughter  don't know rubbed wrong most   The fact all physically turned heads see walk without saying Hello I mean shop next door busier place man running store more courteous  He took time Welcome wish everyone walked good day fact she laughed obnoxiously while she watched walk already wasting time    We proceeded give them benefit doubt considering dead close 9 00 pm  made beginning line waited some sort acknowledgement would helped soon but STILL no spoke us  girl clearly being lazy don't give shit attitude walked away wall made beginning line  She then literally began doing all closing duties right front TWO HOURS left before closing  don't know where she learned work taught Customer Service but need rid cancer store  apparent am first report girl's attitude horrible shop ran which why am surprised still business!  Anyway proceeded wait 15 minutes until young man poked head into back waved other employee some help  Finally I thought but girl halted back flat said front No don't worry wait  Go!     I couldn't believe girl! She really making wait NO REASON other fact she didn't want lazy JOB   worked hospitality years worst experience awhile! When heard remark disgusted asked boyfriend if he ready leave since clear did want serve for whatever reason   When turned leave store girl laughed rudely said See! if fell plan   People don't deserve employed disappointing see them take advantage opportunity GIVEN clearly she didn't EARN it   job obviously hard handle people take advantage Employer should no longer employed! She everything SHE wanted but Customers? couldn't believe she okay she represented herself establishment  guess should walked minute acted busy say Hi right you! But regular Port Subs expecting satisfactory service  never waste business hard earned money ever again Port Subs location    To General Manager store would advise hiring some hard workers would appreciate opportunity employment truly benefit your location  unhappy girl and say girl because she clearly mature enough work needs because your downfall  Definitely won't EVER recommend someone visit location but back ensure review previous customer reviews heard  If girl STILL all reviews she ALONE accumulating then  think only appropriate action would contact Corporate Office well BBB if can't simple change own  <EOR> If weren't busy parking lot would definitely more often!
