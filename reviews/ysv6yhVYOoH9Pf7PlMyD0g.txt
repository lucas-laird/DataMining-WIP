I'm big fan show respect Wahlbergs building dynasty but think Paul would disappointed he sitting me  actually more things noticed he'd probably want know correct staff time management bar especially but things would post here    Good tasting food good service  Underwhelming food  2 5 stars bump cool staff  <EOR> Had great experience here! Marks favorite Thanksgiving see why! good! Turkey patty stuffing orange cranberry sauce mayo butternut squash  Honestly best Thanksgiving sandwiches beside Bobbi Caps  Also onion rings thin good  Also Caesar Salad fell short wasn't fan dressing ranch  add balsamic vinegar kinda weird me  But overall back  locals come back anytime which rocks! Also Lucy server  She amazing nice knowledgeable patient! Great service  <EOR> I burger 1 3 lb added bacon  excellent  Perfectly cooked  bar staff very friendly  Prob best deal restaurant burger strip near Cesar's Palace  <EOR> As lot people wife lives Wahlburgers TV show  travel lot Las Vegas Business she mentioned should try  decided why couple hours before launching town stopped in  wait 5 10 minutes but mainly due being busy Sunday   I Original Burger added Bacon ordereed Onion Rings  food came quick first glance looked really tasty  Burger cooked exactly bacon crispy over done all vegetables lettuce tomato pickles looked fresh healthy  onion rings came separate Basket which large enough share probably two other people    The Burger great  Cooked correctly lots flavor close something would home grill  no complaints  onion rings good expected  crisp but really salty  could even taste onion  batter use light but salty all tasted salted batter  Hence loss star    I would really rate place 3 1 2 stars  service little light  understand place busy but server disappeared order arrives really did check see if could use more water anything else  mentioned salty rings he just agreed but way awesome right  thinking    The real question would try again  Heck yeah  cool place  liked Burger atmosphere vibe  really busy when say light service understandable  onion rings need tweaking hope all time  <EOR> I very impressed  expectations high but really loved Melt  taste good  fresh  good dipping sauce well  BBQ burger also delicious but didn't read jalapeños  Fries good  Only downside Mac n cheese  just ok  All all coming back  <EOR> If live west Mississippi don't many choices try Wahlburgers take when Vegas  super busy long line table skip line sit bar! Yes full bar seats outside seen people sitting right next ton luggage outside apparently didn't want leave Vegas without trying first thing came to!   way Marky mark funky bunch did good job some best burgers while some best tater tots! big greasy other places easy please  drinks service might hectic since busy bar but food comes right away which means keep going kitchen when customers coming crazy  Great quick bite drink when want enjoy few some good food while people watching  <EOR> I thought burgers mac n cheese super tasty husband however telling drunk taste mediocre  would still back even sober  <EOR> Food delicious loved server Alexandria H  6 year old daughter ordered Root Beer Float she entertained asking ID  daughter she cool! <EOR> I super excited try waiting forever open  told hour wait several open tables but could sit bar  Ordered Mud Pie adult shake ice cream behind bar  She made s'more adult shake instead  going ice cream again She instantly remade correct drink  did remove check which nice but would gladly paid $15 taken over 15 minutes drink ordered  food good but both burgers asked modified no jalapeño no squash correct   All all would try again but maybe few months once system down  <EOR> Great food fast service awesome Bar!! Even though first day open organized top things thought open while  <EOR> I know Vegas strip but very pricy OK burger  add ons cheap  Example fried egg bacon 1 00 each  guess just expected better hype  say bun excellent  Sodas first threw off 4 95 each but comes souvenir cup  Also employees take your picture free postcard but try sell picture package  just eat  <EOR> A must Vegas friendly folks working great food!!!!! Looking forward return trip everyone should try Alma's Mac salad crazy good!!! <EOR> I'll admit bypassed hour long wait into Wahlburgers upstairs Redneck Riviera no wait ordered Wahlburgers food they serve same food upstairs    review solely food overall atmosphere   would give 4 5 stars if could because ordered tater tots rather greasy   burger though?  totally legit   enjoyed every single bite   house made pickles good   would wait hour burger but wanting try burgers every time gone Vegas since opened   Super thankful serve them upstairs able burger without wait   know  kind cheating but hey do?

The burger toppings ice cold made burger patty room temperature  asked well done still bleeding  couldn't believe it! check 2 burger combos came $45  clearly upset because basically paid name  Never again there  Terrible service over priced food bad experience  sad restaurant probably ruin franchise    The menu just plain  TV show hear signature burgers brothers did see anything  walked Luxor Wahlburgers just felt disappointed whole experience visit   We paid walked while all nameless employees played phones bartenders shooting rubber bands each other  Monday around 10pm restaurant 20 guests  restaurant needs some new management waiters name tags dress code  <EOR> Nothing particularly special food but partial Wahlburgers because Boston roots! Prices you'd expect strip place  Service good! <EOR> Since live nearby decided see if another burger place could offer anything better what's already saturated market  Advertising business probably done because Mark s being popular actor   Took 8 minutes walk Saturday night  ticket reads 9 23PM  bar ample seating did table's ordered Burger go  Returned home below taste liking  eaten lots burgers Las Vegas  place won't visiting again  strip prices 10 95 would fine If small burger decent burger but failed test  worked lot conventions food booths  sure if Wahlburgers  break into current competition products across nation  preference Carl's jr only because first Angus beef burger but haven't sacrificed size still quality product  looked some orders being served while waiting felt fries other items small size compared Wendy's  McDonald's in out Johnny Rockets Jack box other fast food  places  If want pay more less its your Right spend your money wherever whatever  different opinions taste  wasn't satisfaction recommending friends others  really hoped would something give four possibly five Star rating but fell way short  <EOR> First impression great but still skeptical  When saw prices menu didn't think food would good but holy crap amazing! last great restaurant reasonable prices!

 Wasn't expecting much  Melt fabulous  burger Texas toast full flavor  also Burger cooked perfectly full flavor  Buns grease lime stars good  back many times  <EOR> The burgers great loved place only compliant staff seem little confused wife 3 different people come if ordered just sat down  But over all great place eat burgers  <EOR> It toss between 3 4 4 just because food bad  good hamburger just great one  Maybe expecting more if want great burger Gordon Ramsey burger over planet Hollywood  Service good food burger joint food <EOR> So growing 90s totally loved new kids block specially Donnie Wahlberg when Wahlburgers opened know definitely check out  supposed open earlier Vegas but guess delayed finally opened last year just chance check couple weeks ago  Watching them TV excited try all food see exactly restaurant was   saying totally hyped getting here  Now five stars listed strictly food customer service  another story  But first  let's talk food  Sweet potato tots definitely must if would totally love Jenny chicken burger which delicious love thin sliced onion rings something different usually see burger joint also government cheese sandwich which also good mother mixed drinks OK kind pricey $14 drink but oh well first time again food excellent would love try mac cheese when back Vegas again  wish would open Hawaii would awesome  layout restaurant though outside looked two story building but wasn't  very surprised didn't sell merchandise restaurant actually outside another chaos buy all merchandise  When brand but really cold when we're Vegas 30° cold  Now let's talk customer service which horrible disappointing  Again watching show reading some reviews seem great place great atmosphere but server John only came table set give drinks then didn't see again until he came back table give bill which thought odd  other servers did bring food but wasn't they're excited anything no  how's going how's food nothing just drop food left understand if busy but 130 morning wasn't busy  No came check if needed more water anything just really weird  noticed employees would much rather stand talk story each other instead making sure customers OK  also did inform John server first time excited did come only Hawaii but obviously didn't any difference level customer service going give which zero  There's anything could changed would say would train staff better interacting customers  Again five star rating just strictly food  if read customer service probably give them negative stars  But if you're Vegas want good burger definitely check wall burgers great selection burgers also some other dishes some great drinks  hope next visit better especially since flying all way Hawaii experience wall burgers  just say did journey kiosk outside strip bought items bring back Hawaii friends gentleman working kiosk Francisco he awesome he did great customer service gave free Blinky cup some kind strawberry slush once told Hawaii biggest fans said excellent customer service would definitely back  need more Francisco's working whalburgers just opinion  <EOR> My dad watched salad sit ready served 10min  mom sister could barely finish burgers weren't flavorful all  ate burgers nice small half filled cup cold fries  Mac cheese ether grease some weird juice bottom cup  whole family left feeling ill food poisoning  excited try no way going back  <EOR> Friggin delicious  Open until 4 am  Thank Wahlburgers  Food fast hot tasty  Straight forward burger fries   Best drunk food ever  $8 kids order enough adult  Great portions  Friendly staff  Super happy stopped here  <EOR> Loved loved loved burgers  tater tots extra crispy came pretty quickly  servers confused entire time  only ordered three things but three different waiters help up  seemed bit unorganized sections serve where  would again but would order  <EOR> Donnie's Fave came some guacamole bottom bun underneath jalapeños couldn't tell there  Based photo shows actual slices avocado however bar keep brought more guacamole no questions asked  other item sweet potato tots amazing  <EOR> Very good burger but price high $10 00 burger doesn't come anything  I Liked soda cups keep  Overall five guys cheaper just good  <EOR> Nothing special place  ordered burger the fries separate nothing special  ordered well done am glad still pretty thick dry   best part meal  side onion rings which didn't very much cut into tiny slices didn't much flavor anything because size shape hard dip into ranch which thought would add more flavor them  basically 2 burgers side fries side onion rings bill just few dollars $40 we water drink   Neither boyfriend would back don't recommend friends  end fast food regular burger sit down prices  <EOR> Not type burger   highly recommended thought should try it   Decided Burger which imagined signature burger special sauce   Veggies dominated taste think cucumber pickle instead dill   special suace seemed missing wasn't special   Actually bun best part meal sweet soft   Fries seperate sodas $4  The decor non descript along bar altough part bar outside which could nice if weather were  <EOR> Mac cheese bad chicken sandwhich ok  Really expected more  Prices little high poor quality <EOR> I give place 1 star  service alone  burger quality little league baseball park  Patty no flavor looked pre made frozen patty  12 99 burger only mind fries 5$ extra Out     mention 1 hr wait in  <EOR> Had melt  Ordered med comes pretty rare  Both sides burger seared but meat still blood red  asked if medium told No  sent back re fire  Second melt came back cooked same way  told then medium  eaten enough know medium med rare  When texture meat still uncooked medium  fries pretty bland  Overall just another food place  prices Vegas store outrageous  Melt fries soda $ 25 00 single person  Far ahead Vegas strip prices  <EOR> wow   just WOW  good way!!  i guess since can't no star negative star reviews just going refer star waitress server had  because she actually really really cool truth told felt bad girl  because no nice should deal VERY OBVIOUS bullsh t going place   my gentleman friend stopped try place while vegas last weekend here  i'm originally massachusetts everything wahlburgs'   at least much average person myself should know based mark donny's acting movies etc  im rabid fan but theyve done some good work    so also wanting douche baggery witnessed reflection them  but should know whats up     the kitchen manager vegas strip location could use few lessons  least which being following categories 1 having using decorum general 2 service industry general 3 behave unprofessional attitude having no manners jackass   in general   because fella clearly needs some help    when customer orders double dog just wants 2 plain dogs nothing them   you'd think  pretty simple thing mess up    one dad's burger cooked medium plain double dog PLAIN  yes plain  nothing difficult that    especially when your cool server way verify nothing?   just 2 plain hot dogs? say yes everyone's happy folksy things going just should     until some other waitstaff brings your order 2 hot dogs EVERY FREAKING CONDIMENT slopped them    gentleman friend kind exchanged looks like   youre kidding right? wrong table  nope your plain dogs    okay    so no big deal whatever back    and wrong order courtesy a hole managing kitchen turns into freaking debacle jackassery likes which just could  not  believe   he  kitchen plain view us  VISIBLY denied getting order wrong gave both innocent girl just brought order table server took order rash sh*t made beyond painfully obvious he INSISTING ordered way served then took sweet a$$ time correcting order    and clearly grudge   as two plain hot dogs eventually brought table WASNT EVEN F CKING COOKED!!! obviously grilled cooked  other cold weirdly grayish brown   honest cripes just looking like     no   there NO f cking way just happened  but did  shaking head knowing if really funny more mildly psychotic   still dont know    what know if your job managing kitchen restaurant STRIP LAS VEGAS cant even muster above junior high school level maturity   forget professionalism all just behaving capable balanced person   you need f cking fired    just straight fired  find something else which doesn't involve human interaction  kitchen manager's display just beyond inappropriate time poor beleaguered server told taken off total just relieved wouldnt further scene    we just thanked being cool left good tip wished good night hell there    take off check thanks    that definitely acting blatant jackass front your staff customers  sack sh t  burger kind gross too  ordered medium came back practically mooing just tasting bad   i decided further test patience behavioral issue plagued mental case thought myself leave alone    couldnt even imagine would come back    $25 sh*tty burger obnoxious display  left cursing own self even suggesting try place wishing just gone mcdonalds instead  <EOR> I love Donnie watch show  Always wanted try place but didn't high expectations  thought grab place but actually sit down place service  burger tater tots

Wahlburgers new kid block when comes burgers Las Vegas   Unlike other Yelpers Other Guys tried place thought burger pretty good  didn't order straight menu because nothing really appealed me   Sixth Sense wasn't going impressed   opted build own burger which consisted 1 2 lb burger patty 5 oz grilled chicken breast fried egg   Yes did   Happening  burger huge big enough feed King maybe even Three Kings   Taste wise disappointed   chicken tender meat flavorful greasy egg gave Midas touch   Combining all three favorite protein sources together made Perfect Storm   Although enjoyed burger food Wahlburgers Invincible   also tried Bacon Mac N' Cheese Tater Tots   bacon mac just okay tater tots needed little more work deep fryer  obviously didn't finish tots left couple Lone Survivors   Terri R  Ty W  standard 1 3 lb burger while Lore D  delicious looking patty melt   could tell everyone group satisfied burgers   could feel Good Vibrations    The wait issue especially since Wahlburgers located off strip  waited outside close 30 minutes table 110 degree weather   wish restaurant Transformer outside could least plug cool zone us   Yes hot seemed even warmer inside because restaurant big green house   Price biggest drawbacks   cost burger around $8 creation over $12    Besides wait prices service great   server very attentive Management even checked few times   Free Refills?  Yes!  Free stickers younglings? Double Yes!!  decided against dessert Departed paid bill     Bottom Line   I originally came expecting worse but left satisfied both burgers service  Peace!!!   2016 Yelp Review #42 <EOR> It very good  Though gonna regular burger other place  buddy burger bite yummy  mom sloppy joe  very tasty  Only reason why am giving 4 start ranch  different  something but maybe other ppl may it  <EOR> Had send tiny bowl fries back 4 times!!

The best part meal Spindrift ice cream float   it  ordered burger no bread I'm gluten free   When plate arrived looked giant salad  Someone taken meat patty cut into tiny pieces toddler  Weird  greens fresh But didn't any type dressing flavor  hunt pieces meat  meat pure grease  No flavor  also asked avocado spread extra pickles  didn't receive either  brought later  Avocado fresh but homemade pickles vile! Someone made them incorrectly  pickled things myself made mistakes  Seems ratio vinegar wrong  edible   Overall felt wasted time money calories  many great places eat Vegas doubt ever return  <EOR> Be prepared wait table because gets busy  melt burger sweet potato fries thin crispy onion rings  burger lot smaller bun came but homemade pickles delicious  Then crispy onion rings came cold ask them reheat them  sweet potato tots really good don't forget ask some sriracha ketchup dip them in!
