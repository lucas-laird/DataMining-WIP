To counteract ordered side garlic fries share   While many places Garlic fries Gordon Biersch best   fries very hot fresh just right amount garlic   Often places overwhelm dish garlic but Gordon Biersch   If ever grave garlic fries come here  <EOR> Glad visit restaurant today during happy hour   prices great portion sizes   Mediterranean Chicken light menu expecting something small but decent still left feeling satisfied   staff very friendly noticed all really work together serve customers  gentleman helping knew beer able tell types flavors expect each   beer sampler since guy knew product he suggested order which drink them he point   This place great lunch family small business meetings early evening drinks friends  <EOR> Worst service ever  waitress took drink refill literally never brought back  When asked she admitted she totally forgot accused trying complain free dessert  Um no just wanted drink ordered    I ordered salad dressing side  When salad arrived completely drenched dressing  When asked waitress she glared then she snatched salad took off stomping toward kitchen   My mom ordered veggie burger which completely inedible  cooked all way through someone just slathered refried beans onto bun  Also frozen middle    My mom asked waitress if could cook burger which clearly frozen middle   when waitress really lost it  She started screaming waving arms air yelling restaurant  going chef tell face! tried deescalate situation telling wasn't necessary when she lost yelling RESTAURANT!!! Then she tried stare down she stomped back towards kitchen    K she clearly wanted know restaurant  experience restaurant should able 1 refill drinks 2 accuse customers trying free dessert because totally forgot drink refill 3 accommodate simple requests dressing side 4 serve frozen burgers 5 scream yell customers ask basic service  All those things ultimately forgiven but yelling customers trying stare them down acceptable    Gordon Biersch = Worst restaurant experience Boca Park hands down  <EOR> My first visit Gordon Biersch pleasant one  decor comfortable seating interesting things look at  when restaurants broken into smaller spaces is  There's raised section booths bar flat screen TV back area glassed section wi fi you pay use space     Nice wood floors help create warm atmosphere   The meal pretty good but nothing special fish fries  However garlic fries definitely tasty   service good prices all right  Bottom line I'd come again I'd recommend friends enjoyable time  <EOR> GLUTEN FREE GB  Having gluten grain allergy difficult find restaurant where eat sick  Today husband awesome lunch Gordon Biersch without having any symptoms cross contamination which trust feel immediately    hesitant even try place didn't dedicated gluten free menu however when walked manager  Matt  very knowledgeable gluten assured he could help find things menu   Matt sat he spent time comparing allergy menu regular menu   He awesomely patient going through ingredients etc   decided caesar salad  warm grilled chicken   he took orders explained them waitress he back kitchen sure staff understood precautions   husband salad although gluten free he said equally fresh delicious   When finished meal Matt even came back check sure everything okay   highly recommend GB Rampart whether food allergy not!  attention detail obvious care customers admirable   ADDENDUM My husband back GB last evening evening crew definitely didn't gluten knowledge down servers manager Matt day crew   waitress thought gluten oil ??? she told entire meal ate day before definitely gluten free! split second hoped gluten miracle cured celiac?   Very doubtful  when heard comment asked manager Amanda help   While Amanda very nice totally willing assist prompt allergen book Manager Matt shown day before helping find gluten wheat free food   Amanda admitted she totally aware allergens which found odd manager restaurant also admitted many gluten allergies days  through allergen book ordered exact same thing day before  caesar salad  warm grilled chicken  asked instruct kitchen change gloves use new bowls etc  avoid cross contamination something Manager Matt brought before could    time waitress totally into she monitored kitchen sure those directions followed    And lived     Moral story If allergy anything still self advocate    least GB ask allergen book figure yourself survive write next day  <EOR> Awesome food friendly staff really good beer  else could want restaurant? <EOR> My wife restaurant week half ago last dinner Vegas   delicious burger beer wife chicken dish   also shared calimari appetizer before main courses   venue stylishly decorated food very succulent   only drawback slightly messy table when first came just few crumbs also waiters seemed take long time slow night   place partially filled unless crew vastly understaffed would no reason food extra orders take long   those minor reasons 4 5 stars   chocolate melting cake die for    Otherwise good place go! <EOR> It's long time since visited Gordon Biersch   remember when first opened Paradise place trendy   long time ago now chain just another take likes Yard House Chicago Brewing such   remember last visit San Diego branch food very good beer good atmosphere great   latest visit Boca Park location results bit downgrade food chic factor but otherwise still quite satisfying   We met friend wife really looking forward restaurant week deal $40 3 course   Alas only Paradise location    why that?  only mildly disappointed since figured we'd probably spend less money now proceed order couple apps calamari blue crab artichoke dip entrees   Seafood Cobb Salad Lobster Shrimp Mac 'n Cheese Fish Chips Cajun Fish tacos   calamari very good rightly crisped coating perfect taste albeit calamari weren't exactly plump   artichoke dip disappointing tasted sour cream y crab flavor lost it   couldn't tell if  actual crabs not   think would better tortilla chips rather bread   I Mac 'n Cheese because mix lobster shrimp sounded interesting   wasn't exactly Mac 'n Cheese though Bowtie 'n Cheese pasta macaroni pasta   Loses effect bit but tasted mac n' cheese they're forgiven   taste tasted typical mac but addition seafood definitely better   Ample chunks lobster shrimp quite well cheese pasta mix   dash truffle oil would put park think   Also tried fish n chips while appropriately crispy tasted fine would preferred more traditional batter more panko crust like use   Didn't try cobb but humongous tacos huge also you two      The server very pleasant throughout but committed no no   Towards end meal she came dropped off check letting know shift over need settle   think very bad practice breaks rhythm flow dinner patrons   Why can't let next shift take over settle check instead when customers ready?  may quarter full don't all share tips anyway?  Still detract otherwise great service deserves 4 stars end     Four beers couple glasses wine all came $125 before tips   bad but tend think bit overpriced get   Beer price very reasonable though $3 75 pint home brews   likely revisit but probably more happy hour apps drinks rather dinner   All in all marginally 3 5 stars food decidedly 3 5 stars overall   place may epitome why Yelp should grant 1 2 stars   Food for 1 Factor Well big bar front but air place doesn't necessarily put single diners ease   May bit social inside eating drinking your lonesome    <EOR> I used love coming here  here On two occasions where wait ridiculous food amazing used be  sad when happens restaurants  used love guys <EOR> Gordon Biersch gone through lot changes left some regulars bitter taste  worst experience recently hope last its kind  Our party 3 sat patio Happy Hour  server rushed very rude  She didn't apply free beer coupon until inside find manager  none sight but she came over fixed asked twice  gave coupon when ordered beer   She practically threw checks down only came back once refills  When asked she said told earlier all fine  WTF??? The beer great happy hour pizza very good   We celebrating birthday wouldn't come back if wasn't Stein Club   If Ale House opens Summerlin area GB toast  <EOR> The first time Gordon Biersch right opened we'd gone Happy Hour   before economy tanked spoiled Kona Grill's HH offerings which lamentably now ghost its past glory Bring back Goat Cheese Pizza!!!    Gordon just couldn't compare never back until invited those Listen Spiel We'll Serve Dinner events held small private room wayyy back restaurant even past rest rooms   back door we'd Lake Mead Blvd   We choice three items preceded small Caesar salad Pasta Marinara Chicken Teriyaki Shrimp Tempura Chicken Marzen sauce   ordered chicken having no idea Marzen sauce supposed umlaut no less but wasn't smart friend ours ordered without any sauce because turned heavy gloppy pinkish concoction mushrooms   Hubby ordered same thing   served garlic mashed some soggy vegetables   I realize dinner may entirely representative GB's usual fare but should enticement patrons trapped two full hours before morsel food served definitely Gordon Biersch's doing sure want come back order regular menu   Except excellent service nothing food restaurant bucket list  <EOR> Stopped GB late happy hour but super hungry ready eat on  perusing menu when WHAT'S THIS?? blue cheeseburger!! Kobe blue cheeseburger might add! called Kobe Black Blue decision made right then there! paired seasonal brew but cannot remember called! strong ale  Anywho burger came knife shoved right middle! pretty funny  Nevertheless pulled proceeded eat burger delivered cut down into little lady pieces  nice thick patty relatively juicy  All all good burger  just wish MORE blue cheese  book really never much  dining partner Kobe cheeseburger fried egg  Vegas thing? never seen many fried eggs burgers before! HAHA! Anyways good dining experience but **THINK** Kobe burgers test out  don't know if permanent GB menu just instinct no actually said   never seen them menu before  believe search continues! Next stop Cheesecake Factory's Blue Cheese B L T Burger! <EOR> When need happy hour reverse happy hour Gordon Biersch usually gold option  hadn't some time but remember garlic fries being must along beer tap  number basic bar food options choose most solid    Service basic enjoy option having indoor outdoor dining location  usually end patio if isn't cold hot  <EOR>
