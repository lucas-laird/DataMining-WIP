Parking awesome plenty space live that  restaurant immaculately CLEAN! Spotless would even say  staff clean professional very knowledgeable being vegan  even vegan option sushi bowl! Awesome!!!!!   Food AWESOME!!!! right now!!! Amazing !!! <EOR> At first glance Sushi Burrito Bowl looks welcoming clean environment  clean part right but very welcoming  staff aren't very friendly helpful  no music playing which didn't like  strange staff didn't seem trained interact when customers walk through door  No smiles asking wanted order  Just stares   The items menu laid but didn't mention serve tofu which very exciting surprise  also offer vegan patty vegan sauces clearly labeled  creating your burrito roll hands mat burrito isn't very tight  don't eat fish but definitely didn't look great quality  food alright but options limited hope expand try different toppings  <EOR> Overall place deserves 3 5 stars being decent  little sushi bowl spot satisfy your basic craving  looking quick lunch take drove place decided give shot   I greeted right when walked busy yet since just opened 11am  storefront nice clean only table occupied manager family think  girl behind counter Shayla? friendly enough she made sure eye contact smile  She patiently waited while browsed menu  wish she little more engaging  Usually other establishments try some anticipatory question remark help customer  would nice if she tried little maybe inquire if questions if first time here  Especially since slow business time  However she attentive enough while placed order   I ordered custom bowl salad base salmon yellowtail proteins then seaweed salad edamame toppings  bowl complete garlic ponzu sauce  Quality fish good flavor sauce complimented ingredients  think portions little small which why added salmon saw yellowtail scoops were  toppings available left more desired  Did miss masago smelt egg ?  favorite topping! Price decent $11 ordered   Would go to spot sushi bowl? Probably not  Everything ok nothing more less experienced better town  Would come back try again? Absolutely because least room small adjustments better results  <EOR> So fist sushi experience but first sushi burrito experience  Seriously delicious  Love fresh salmon tuna Ponzu    staff friendly service quick  definitely back quench quick sushi fix  <EOR> I walked first time  place super clean workers very nice  love sushi burritos decided give place try! ordered #2 which spicy tuna amazing! loved lot sushi nice fresh  Defiantly going come back again <EOR> The burritos properly wrapped lot ingredients came out  burrito no sauce much sauce  Otherwise burritos above average amount protein solid flavor  many jalapenos #1 but still good  ceviche surprised being excellent  healthy amount shrimp price best part meal  <EOR> Never again  would say pretty knowledgeable sushi burritos poke  multiple places fair share great experiences  decided since just opened hoping above average experience  First off presentation great employees said hi basically  it  didn't explain menu anything  also didn't really seem wanted making feel same way  ordered just standard salmon burrito seaweed salad  friend ordered yellow tail  burrito poorly wrapped began fall apart upon eating  only seaweed salad burrito hard mean hard  always eat seaweed salad couldn't even bite into take mouth multiple times  pushed aside continued eat  Here's where takes turn worst  friend took bite happens?? piece hair!  unacceptable especially being brand new place! never write reviews long but fact always eat sushi burritos  very disappointing  If you've never sushi burrito before all means try place however if sushi burritos lot then would highly recommend going somewhere else  <EOR> The food fresh but wrap worst want able eat wrap once opened paper fell apart said  <EOR> I always water store next door think looks great  check day  Well day today am really happy did it! real deal sushi burrito  cannot wait another soon    I nice chat worker byron   Very friendly attentive service  <EOR> My family eaten four times now  Each time food fresh plenty variety portions average good friendly service  The reason won't give five first two times Byron cashier all good  third time another cashier don't remember name when she gave receipt she also gave additional receipt told text words shown free food  thrilled starting fast food place excited thinking promotion just started  However again Byron again working  order given when cash register pay Byron placed promotion receipt top cash register where many other promotion receipts  Byron asked if wanted receipt said yes well receipt he just put top register  Byron instantly gave left but left bad feeling getting ripped off while Byron giving promotion receipts friends keeping them himself free food  Food great place really clean gives feeling healthy but hate being ripped off  <EOR> Worst experience ever establishment  When walk nobody greets just stare until order  actually quite awkward  None ingredients fresh avocados old brown shrimp tempura soggy all fish dry very strong fish odor them list on  Just don't here  Stick more well known sushi burrito joint  <EOR> A disappointing experience    place mirrors similar sushi bar concepts elsewhere town but service unfortunately dull sushi burrito itself strangely dry limp   exactly zero other customers when came order out    good sign   Also must confess worried fresh fish if seaweed refrigerated enough   But hungry scarfed all down despite reservations    Luckily did ill but wish read earlier reviews before knew other customers sick does surprise me  <EOR> I'd never back place  day off craving bowl wanted try place  close home  Saw two miles spent little over $10 worst bowl ever had  spicy mayo sauce none other ever before don't mean good way  restaurant bright clean but sign outside says the best bowls Las Vegas lie should taken down  craving isn't satisfied bothered wasted money going place better way better <EOR> Service friendly food good  Big spacious dining room love build your own bowls burritos  back! <EOR> Good convenient location hear three times current time placed order over phone call back tell ran rice told would 30 minutes canceled order over all place great poke place crab meat sauces pretty good though but deff lacking topping verity bit pricey <EOR> I paid almost $10 Sushi Burrito grilled chicken avocado  food wasn't fresh  chicken same rubbery microwavable stuff Subway other fast food places use  wasn't filling   Overall just good value  You'll way better off heading over real sushi place  Hanabi good place shopping center across street  <EOR> Besides awkward atmosphere no greeting I'd say giving place 1 star being nice  boyfriend fans sushi burritos recently moved area thought we'd give place shot  ordered #5 which comes shrimp tempura tail still attached pre made crunchy all  Once left throwing 3 4 burritos away afraid eating old fish getting sick  home sure enough became sick threw burrito boyfriend bathroom stomach cramps  eat here  <EOR> So good  Good price  Miso soup great too  Staff excellent  Definitely coming back  <EOR> Told soft shell crab gluten free  breaded  no understanding food allergies nor care  Told them going eat somewhere else  did seem care all  <EOR> I've eaten twice now over past 3 days they've consistently done fantastic job   price really affordable definitely don't skimp fish fillings  <EOR> Used love place highly short staffed but sometimes worth wait if long haired guy your burrito    Some other dude made burrito nothing used to     Plus now only offer flour burrito vs other choices had    All all expect spend 15 minutes waiting before there   Which horrible if am break <EOR> Came friend check since close house  Made own burrito see yellow tail wasn't good right when opened container  Smaller sizes most sushi burrito places but bad price  Biggest turn off other yellow tail three bite into burrito see hair ever happened hairnets????
