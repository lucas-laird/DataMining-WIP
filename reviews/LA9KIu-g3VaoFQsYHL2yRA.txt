Won't retuning just because haven't heard good things new menu  sister recently said totally changed everything  <EOR> Operated Cantonese star am voting already!   But let's serious Teriyaki Company pretty awesome   $3 99 teriyaki bowl hear second to none awesome deal lunch   Teriyaki chicken lunch plate egg rolls $4 99    Speaking egg rolls absolutely LEGIT   Being Hong Kong myself know legit egg roll when see it   twice long ones usually see similar teriyaki chicken places timing frying superb   egg rolls don't none those crazy cabbage fillers but instead pure chicken wait it     chopped chestnuts!  Yep!  chestnuts act filler but also create extra crunch need it    But chestnuts egg rolls find Asia least well to do restaurants Hong Kong   Still convinced?  usually don't even eat egg rolls come meals but would back TTC just egg rolls   Now since am TTC again egg rolls might well better your standard chicken teriyaki plate!  Now mind still chicken teriyaki bowl all don't expect life changing experience because restaurant it   However if interested fresh chicken just right amount teriyaki sauce slightly moister usual rice then TTC all!  I also tried yakisoba also awesome   don't know yakisoba awesome but was!    Listen feel bit shameful giving TTC 4 star just because located somewhat gross side town basically mock Asian food but feel wrong yelp TTC because actually know doing worth!  try it! <EOR> So Yummly  Whenever im Vegas stop here  Teriyaki Chicken bowl fruit smoothies without boba  No extra charge extra teriyaki sauce either  Its simple delicious food  <EOR>
