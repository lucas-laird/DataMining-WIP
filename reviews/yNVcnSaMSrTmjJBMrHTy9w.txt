As soon four seated fast train began! wine bread table seconds which thought nice quick service but no idea fast! Then waiter came over take order within 5 minutes shabby!  Then BEST part little old iconic man 36 years came sing song someone's home town but he quickly told move way another waiter bringing food us! within 10 minutes receiving salads which 5 minutes orders placed  Stay now best here! Once shoveled down supposed great food prepared 10 minutes less most bland homemade sauce plates quickly scooped overly sweet cappuccinos brought no chance order anything different which tried enjoy but waiter then came politely told needed table leave! The sad thing already paid bill generous tip! If known would told leave because needed table 3 other tables also empty would left them tip equal quality service food   $1 00! I many places very busy nights NEVER told leave room!  Maybe should convert place take out only where could through line look pictures USED treat customers place your order look more pics while being serenaded gentle little old man cage high off floor so he's way pay pick fast food leave!

On previous trip Vegas convinced now husband another friend try Battista's Hole Wall  heard place years but never made finally wanted try it  Yes looks bit sketchy outside I think guests could see building room Bally's said looks place where prostitutes hang but truly fine upstanding business  Live little people!  Anyway since Battista's really enjoyed food previously all wine INCLUDED meal decided wedding dinner here  always happy did   There already large er? group reservations 7pm Saturday but since only going 40 people able same time  all table but room other diners where basically sitting L shaped table configuration  thought fun other diners well hope enjoyed some speeches toasts    Now important part food  couple pretty much pulse everything chic cool tell happy dinner Battista's since recommended several time them  good reason thought food excellent  Eggplant Parm wish could taken large portion leftover me  Everyone spoke gushed food especially cappuccino  don't drink coffee opted but those said best ever had    In addition dinners all extras come them asked servers bring dessert plates assortments had  Sadly no cannoli but tiramisu spumoni  mentioned coffee girl didn't try tiramisu but spumoni excellent! knew much bring nothing left!  For those looking large dinner Battista's believe total bill $1400 all in   bad 40 people somewhat sober when came left full tipsy! let everyone order whatever wanted off menu wasn't condensed menu keep prices down  highly recommend Battista's Hole wall large small groups!  PS accordion player visited several times such cute man! bad group didn't know more words  Amore! <EOR> Dined Battista's week   those complain prices Battista's think important point bottomless glass red white wine included price   red certainly fine wine rather I'd call easy drinking wine   food pretty darned good   pay $22 every day decent egg plant parm all wine stomach   added feature note accordian player rounds serenading each table   While big fan musicians performing table old dude real gem  <EOR> I came 21st bday last year good! literally hole wall place back side all hotels strip  Batista's next two liquor stores but place hidden gem   The portions pretty big all shared but wind garlic bread pasta eggplant everything else made perfect dinner! plan coming back real soon  5 starts batista's <EOR> So came high recommendation  Food right atmosphere reputation  Service not   Very impersonal rushed  handed check before service even complete   wasn't overly busy visit   rate two stars because atmosphere food charm   But place needs reset focus experience less focus fast turn tables   Unfortunate but won't back  $30 person dinner small ask experience   asking much just some decency  <EOR> Old time Vegas its best  Great ambiance compared ultra glitz glamor mega casino restaurants  Food very good  Carafe house wine salad garlic bread all great  true test any Italian restaurant spaghetti meatballs  meatballs some best had  Spaghetti could used little more sauce? lot sauce  Asked pleasant wait staff brought soup bowl extra sauce  would definitely come back  Seems locals favorite which always good sign  <EOR> Everything wonderful   atmosphere unique especially menu wall   wife alfredo sauce loved it   sausage penne which great   carafe wine comes meal   I'd suggest white wine even people don't wine   white wine subtle taste works well italian food   espresso end much more hot chocolate normal espresso    The only issue owner coming around accordion   very awkward if don't anything tip with  <EOR> Parking 4 5 Parking easy find right outside building plenty spots available  kind dirty but its big issue unless if planning eat lot   Ambiance 1 5 Light very dark  When walked into restaurant felt navy seal trying break into Binladen's compound using night vision goggles  seriously need lighten joint  Noise level average your average Italian restaurant   Service 2 5 I reserved table 4 sited immediately when full party arrived  would recommend reserving table ahead time especially weekend  server very good he wine garlic bread right ordered he wasn't annoying other places where waiters keep bothering see doing  Also avoid musician whom table table literally playing nothing but small tune feel obligated give money    Food 4 5 Food pretty good   Meals range $23 45 courses contain salad soup garlic bread house wine red white entre cappuccino  ordered salad which good wasn't drenched dressing many other places  House wine all drink but pay for   Garlic bread pretty good  wasn't overly laced garlic butter complemented well main entree  main entre sausage penne meat sauce  Meat sauce delicious sour just right amount sweetness  spicy sausage amazing flavor cooked perfection  best part meal cappuccino which comes all meals best post meal hot dessert ever had    Overall 3 5 decent off strip joint  prices very reasonable good meals but ambiance service does need some work  <EOR> When think Italian food Battista's always comes mind  hidden gem plain sight  You've probably driven countless times never noticed it  Next time you're Linq keep eye right around corner    Walking through door walking through time machine  Back days well dressed gentleman classy dames  White linen tables cozy booths romantic lighting always full laughter  There's quirky accordion player walking down aisles offering tunes tip  atmosphere definitely adds experience    All menus displayed walls above you  if you're blind bring your glasses  prepared large portions  Sharing recommended  start your meal complimentary garlic bread salad which very tasty  Oh did mention unlimited house wine  Red please!

Highly recommended going fun time   Probably great intimate date  <EOR> Just hop skip drunken amble off Strip Battista's unexpected delight  outside looks sleazy bar maybe extension liquor store next door  inside looks low rent version Buca di Beppo walls cluttered photos inscrutable memorabilia  worried food would taste Buca but fears assuaged    They start off free wine tiny glasses large party carafes white red  white perfectly pleasant chablis though didn't sample burgundy companions pronounced nearly palatable   Then garlic bread appeared  idiot gorged myself it  quintessential fluffy but chewy loaded salty garlic ness    The minestrone soup also included tasted fine though base bit gummy  Most tablemates opted salad just understand   By time lasagna arrived big brick covered molten cheese full could only take two bites  But man good!   The food very straightforward American style Italian cooked generally pleasing textures  Very appetizing stuff  good took several more bites lasagna should have    To cap night offer little mug cappuccino topped whipped cream  Honestly tasted hot cocoa which fine me!  The prices outrageous course being just off Las Vegas Strip  $25 lasagna cheaper entrees board  But considering extras large portion sizes appealing renditions American Italian classics I'd say worth shot  <EOR> Just loved restaurant last visit  Love idea having all meal!!  The Cappuccino end meal  <EOR> This place great value   Food served generous portions complimentary wine prices very reasonable dinner especially if Italian food    I'd say entrees better average but some better others   garlic bread dangerous   just kept refilling baskets   tricky    nice change spending much hotel spots character or something cozy feeling    Apparently around while all pictures stuff people past   right off Strip but definitely gets pretty busy reservations  <EOR> My husband daughter discriminated man named Ariel aka Papa since hispanic because he came table take order whenever he felt didn't bother telling daily specials came table see if needed anything if wasn't guy getting tables ready next customers would never gotten salads soup  Ariel aka  Papa came every table gave them excellent service made sure everything needed  discriminated Argentina Man spoke Spanish left no tip shitty service he gave us  manager nice gave cappuccinos ice cream daughter  <EOR> This small but romantic place serves great food   well worth visit would recommend anyone looking nice Italian home style cooked meal  <EOR> Very good price bit high but worth it!!! Only complaint would say when walked told 15 min tables sit bar later when seated many empty tables believe just winged bar sales <EOR> So thankful finally introduced place many years  If local would eat every night! Delicious! Very reasonably prices especially being close strip  Ordered lasagna think $23  lasagna great but salad garlic bread cappuccino unlimited wine special complimentary desserts!! Love place beyond belief! sit same table waiter Vito used serve Frank Sinatra Elvis Presley  headed back Vegas week already warned 5 Battistas virgins taking them there! <EOR> After buddy landed Las Vegas asked cab driver take hole in the wall restaurant away strip  He actually took restaurant named Hole Wall  knew?  Menu wall  Bottomless jug wine table  Food served your mother's bowl plates  like?  Sure eat those restaurants strip owned some famous chef never heard pay $50 head  family style restaurant doesn't take itself seriously casual atmosphere good meal money   The food quality may top notch but just another canter house wine  Welcome Vegas baby! <EOR> We ate tonight food excellent delicious but filling  Service fast very polite efficient  prices whole meal including red white wine well garlic bread milky sweet cappacino favorite kind  smaller appetites ordered 3 meals 5 2 covers $13 each added  would nice if price without alcohol most party didn't drink  <EOR> In town another week end Las Vegas consensus pick night town dinner destination   italian family style type place though particular style Battista's marks uniquely Vegas location   The menu wall 15 choices ranging spaghetti Steak Caruso    Free white red wine included meal   The portions enormous   veal parmesan terrible but expecting food terrible wasn't big deal   free cappucinio came meal hot chocolate?

When seated she failed give menus  Once service handed off waiter however things improved considerably  Food great waiter great  Prices seem high until account fact wine included  Cappuccino too!  Edited returned Battista's subsequent trip Las Vegas thoroughly pleasant experience   even gave cappuccino since meet someone dinner   Upgrading rating 4 stars  <EOR> I truly disappointed  going years but other night last time  tell friend cool place was  friends meal over cooked sent back changed more then meal  because waitress charged friend wine soup bread minimum charge dinning  Terrible service  soup being service big stainless steal pot no top sat roller cart  cart walkway lot foot traffic  <EOR> Appetizer good main course disaster dessert corn sirup nightmare  wine red very good price  Service above average  Would back?

But seemed norm place  Nonchalant attitudes everyone there  could care less first place   I'm debating whether give place 1 star but remind myself Sunday dinner your family's house  sometimes family members bad days  give 3 stars because did enjoy food   I just won't back  better places eat where patronage appreciated  <EOR> The hubby took place surprise never heard anything place pulled parking lot confused  place sure hole wall in great way   your face fancy but food service five start restaurant! soon walked door smelled amazing! menu reasonably sized  every meal comes bread sticks salad soup all drink wine cappuccino end!

First off wait table 30 minutes half empty restaurant!   What's about? Some sort marketing ploy people think doing better then are?  They winded giving tiny booth back place dark corner where could even read menu!

Aside grease delicious rich tasty  meatball very dense stuffed all kinds fresh herbs garlic  easily six ounces   Battista's great place great city you've your fill buffets quick bites wonderful sit down meal Italian restaurant does right  <EOR> If want old school vegas Battistas deliver mobster feel   However recommendation stops there   Bloated prices quite frankly mediocre food reduced once must see visitors place avoid   Even portions shrinking   started garlic bread which stale almost no garlic flavor   salad call lazy salad   essentially lettuce some fillers instead shredding chopping cheese unidentifiable salami substance simply put block cheese salad round piece salami   Clearly chef takes no pride leaves kitchen   kids small bowl ravioli 13 95 which boring   adult menu starts 24 95 high price over $30 00  tried chicken parm   ok but chicken moist sauce watery   side ziti  flavorless   spaghetti meatballs ok but meatballs overly dense     All all disappointing meal   used recommend place town guests but no longer   also appears raised prices when High Roller arrived which place no longer affordable value  <EOR> Ambiance fantastic! Very romantic if enjoy sorta thang  Sauce reminded Ragu but terrible  I'd rather purchase good wine separately but suppose handle complimentary bottomless bottle house red white offer though tastes bit watered down  cappuccino probably kid but adult nothing more hot chocolate  Again though free meal   Meal prices ranged $23 $40  Sure back again but mainly romance  <EOR> So know place kinda cheesy  Okay lot cheesy  But liked it!

More hot chocolate coffee honest   Service good  kind enough split party two help check easier  even gentleman come serenade accordian! would definitely come back again  <EOR> The food good but overall experience subpar  Prices high lighting at least back corner room near kitchen low wanted sleep lack customization your meal choices big downside  Each meal comes house wine garlic bread soup salad cappuccino which probably explains overly priced plates  However felt almost forced into getting all extras  example besides trying didn't drink any wine which wonder much wine waste night? Similarly cappuccino served whether want it  Some people group didn't drink theirs probably would passed even asked especially if would lower price meal!  The biggest area improvement though would service  Simple things or think simple even common sense introducing yourself smiling pointing useful information long way e g  menu wall but initially thought just part decor  would nice if hostess pointed when showing table  server decent little more friendly but he assistant or maybe he food runner? uncomfortably awkward  hard put into words he doing but basically he hostess could definitely improve customer service skills   I want restaurant especially because seems lot history main dishes good  However don't think future visits Vegas include going hole wall place  staff plenty room improvement communication customer service skills  <EOR> ***Para pasarlo bien***  Battistas tiene un ambiente muy especial  Muy concurrido con mesas muy cerca una de la otra ruidoso pero se nota que todos la estn pasando muy bien  El men es de unos 20 tipos diferentes de platos principales con precios que van desde 29 dlares hasta los 49  Incluyen ensalada o sopa el menestrone es muy bueno Pan de ajo exquisito artesanal y abundante Vino de la casa el cul parece no es muy bueno plato principal y un tipo de caf chocolate para terminar la cena  La comida es deliciosa y abundante alcanz para el almuerzo del da siguiente   Creo que es un buen lugar para ir con amigos  Hagan sus reservas es muy exitoso  La lasaa y el filete mignon deliciosos  El servicio es rpido pero impersonal los meseros no realizan recomendaciones y parecen un poco abrumados por el poco espacio y la gran cantidad de gente  <EOR> If want something little low key inexpensive dinner Vegas try looks original Buca Di Beppo   The bar nice but fancy  did reservation really nice sit bar drink while waited table   I guess since didn't reservation booth got corner kind squeezed behind booth next table   But fine since didn't much since no way knock into woman's chair closest us   The service friendly   They complimentary house wine which very nice touch  If picky am sure buy bottle well   There complimentary garlic bread too   The house salad really nice   The Chicken Parmesan good but spinach incredible  could eaten huge bowl! also side pasta   The Spumoni dessert different ever seen  slice cake  much cold hard  would liked better if sat  20 minutes  love Angelo  Brocato's Spumoni New Orleans comparing   But star meal dare say even better spinach complimentary cappuccino  world   I am glad nice because short walk hotel  <EOR> When Vegas   This restaurants iconic Vegas course try it  made reservations which totally recommended promptly seated when arrived  place totally old Vegas feel it   The menu wall  literally  server arrived quickly took food order  No asked drink  guessing because house red white wine complementary   The food came quickly good! veal Parmesan yummy! portions large come hungry  <EOR> Not groovy expected food wise ambiance wise   around 915pm group 5   Seated immediately greeted service staff   Wine red white AWFUL horrible cheap box but worse stuff   Still due someone daring someone else drink killed 2 carafes white 1 2 red   Blech    still tasted bad didn't any better!
