It's nice see water show while you're eating but also entertaining see neon sign bare chested men right next it  Romantic entertaining all once  <EOR> I almost feel bad giving Circo four stars instead 5 but all honesty amount money throw down place really should better  say quality meal solid  Great pasta excellent sauce arguably best meat sauce ever had seafood seemed fresh  Service also par would expect  sommelier knew stuff took time give some good suggestions samples  Also its great location nice view Bellagio fountains night    Despite all positives few things detract Circo opinion 1 aesthetic although understand concept entirely bright colorful liking  Fabrics materials used good furnishings seemed well made but theme wrong  family didn't matter but don't think good 'date' destination    2 emptiness Saturday night around 7p literally 3 other tables entirety large restaurant  know Vegas struggling economy but plenty other restaurants weekend which packed mostly full  means people don't feel its worth cost doing poor job promoting place    Overall nice experience still solid choice if you're catching show Bellagio as were want pretty top notch Italian quiet setting  However don't think great value think better restaurants spend your precious and fleeting Las Vegas dollar  <EOR> I restaurant week   started sour note when wait 30 minutes past reservation time seated   People would walk then seated prior maybe due fact made known restaurant week?  Once seated service great sommelier very helpful which why review 2 stars   Most food pretty bland under seasoned   six dishes calamari appetizer only good one   Overall disappointed definitely expected more  <EOR> We apparently off night cooking  lobster soup special salty MIL's tenderloin came rare when she requested medium well done  sent back she still couldn't eat second time still rare uneven charring throughout    That being said hubby's pork chop mushroom risotto simply divine  only wish could gotten name merlot accompanying wine  definite yum     I think we're willing give place more try next time come back just see whether fact off night cooking  <EOR> We staying Bellagio since Sunday having wonderful time   Wednesday tuckered barely did anything all day   woke 8 00 p m  starved whim decided see if could nab reservation Circo   luck   Upon entering restaurant impressed   decor excellent   treated princess   semi private table view Bellagio fountains   Almost everything ate truffles sommelier talked 45 minutes wine training   going back Bellagio month hope try Circo's older brother Le Cirque!  Oh   may add dessert fresh cherry cotton candy it? <EOR> I many times cannot food service ambience   love La Cirque same family but particularly love Circo because prefer Italian French   just heard Circo closing can't believe Bellagio would let fabulous restaurant leave   Please keep it   Many many people love won't seem Las Vegas without Circo here!! <EOR> Food pretty good  lobster gnocchi which pretty good  Portion small but guess most upscale places like  However lot lobster dish which very nice but gnocchi little mushy side which sadly seems problem gnocchi lot places  view great if window table look over fountains during shows while eat which great  staff very good checking enough without getting annoying  gnocchi mushy portions little larger feel might given 5 stars <EOR> I disappointed place even pretty low expectations    The food pretty good but much memorable it  When finished almost felt just well eaten macaroni grill   The rack lamb huge well cooked but again nothing fancy something just could made home fraction cost  strange took only 7 minutes time put order time table  does huge rack cook little time? around $55  Pasta dish quail sausage forget name dish but pretty good  enjoyed much more rack lamb    The dessert gross  some banana thing pretty much worse anything Sizzlers' buffets dessert choices   If came back would stay pasta dishes meat dishes pricey offer  would much rather splurge over craftsteak kobe menu  Yum     Service pretty horrible  Maybe believe smiling greetings even quality checks  just seem interested turning over tables quickly possible    One last thing  If want somewhere dine watch fountains ok circo but if want much more romantic atmosphere better view show Jean Georges' Prime Steakhouse  same level lake much better view  food service leaps bounds better over well  <EOR> Just o k   am sure if expectations outweighing experience but way felt     calamari good lobster good     didn't dessert over jean phillip instead  <EOR> I'm big fan lasagna  but Circo's version delicate delicious   meat reduction glaze perfect accompaniment   complimentary chef's selection dessert samplings impeccably arranged wonderfully tasty   Would return again future visits! <EOR> I just came back dinner Circo  reading all rave reviews very excited try place  love all fresh red yellow rose bouquets each table very classy  also decent view fountains though party sitting 4 tables back window  liked circus theme done very creatively  ambience nice but food taste wise fell short especially price  raspberry fizz martini delicious though!  I decided try chefs tasting menu cost $88   chose caprese salad duck ravioli scallops lamb picked strawberry tart dessert   The food arrived within good time though thought took server little long greet take order beginning    The caprese salad just ok  served special kind very smal leaf basil  only little sprig essentially no basil flavor  Duck ravioli nice liked mushrooms paired with   Only scallop served tasting menu but large one  presentation very nice this  thought scallop cooked very well favorite dishes though scallops other places liked better    I didn't really care much lamb you pay extra $9   heavily encrusted herbs but surprisingly didn't taste strongly herbs  meat seemed fairly chewy hard time cutting knife ordered medium rare really red    The strawberry tart ok  arrangement strawberries top tart pretty  filling mix strawberries something else? very mushy didn't much flavor  also mini strawberry smoothie served along side  some pop rocks interesting surprise  strawberry sauce smoothie bit intense tasted fake strawberry syrup sweet  think smoothie made real strawberries would better  <EOR> wonderful deco food experience  Love dessert donuts! <EOR> Worst restaurant ever eaten LV  tried nearly 100 top rated places  GREAT VIEW though  They served overcooked tenderloin bad send back     We spent nearly $200 between drinks lame apps waste time money elsewhere!!!! <EOR> Reading some not so impressed reviews thinking party lucky good day   Keep mind menu seems change once while! guessing every 2 3 weeks?

Some best spaghetti ever could texture noodles richness sauce   Enjoyed smoked swordfish appetizer panna cotta delightful jiggly bellini sunburst straight head   Service impeccable   setting fun circus Bellagio fountains window   Knocked off star scary monkey unicycled above kitchen bar   Distracting   squid seafood stew little over cooked too  <EOR> I honestly say worst food experiances since eating Uno's once when hurry  arrived Circo large group 11 people which reservation for  asked table close windows could hopefully view fountains but seated far away center restaurant  cannot blame them this  know difficult accomodate large group prime location did really bother but would nice   I am huge foodie eaten many places well working industry significant amount time consider myself pretty understanding agreeable when comes dining  However unlike anything ever seen   Our party seated cocktail waitress promptly came over i pads containing drink menus  Personally find very odd because table 11 obviously restaurant only limited number i pads she sets down 2 table share take turns sliding through electronic pages  Completely STUPID opinion     Just give regular drink menu    read just same paper i pad  cocktail server returns few minutes later ready take drink orders  all nod response ready order something her  She gets through 4 people before leaving table  10 minutes she returns drinks 1st four people completely ignors she rushes set them down then leaves again  finally flag down server assistant ask return rest table could order drinks too   With drinks finally hand move order meals  pretty smoothly promptly salad courses  Then never ending wait begins main courses  waitied hour 30 minutes between when salads cleared when received entrees  Now am very patient don't mind wait between courses but excessive even standards rest table nearly understanding vocally upset wait   Most table ordered Filet which seemed mostly okay  Some slighltly overcooked but real problem  All steaks served nastiest asparagus ever seen  spears looked under heat lamp back kitchen hours  mean seen better looking asparagus Outback steakhouse buffet line   During meal 1 instance any waitstaff coming check see if everything okay liking     which certianly nearly whole table  honeslty some worst service ever any restaurant all life  waitstaff rude manager willing even listen dismay issues food   I would recommend Circo  many options Vegas many them well worth price  Try Mortorano's Rao's Lavo if looking Italian  <EOR> The view Bellagio foutains awesome   But  pretty much it     Our waiter told dish keep bringing people back definitely lamp chop   ordered along another coworker   fatty oily really much better   crust good portion large but wasn't expected the dish people come back restaurant Circo   I am giving them 3 stars because beef carpaccio app decent sorbet dessert   But don't think I'd back again   all those amazing Vegas restaurants choose going list re visits unless someone else paying  <EOR> originally recommended coworkers europe said place very authentic italian food    the service impressive three different people serve bread drinks food all very cordial  server very personable attentive  liked weren't pretentious stuffy    the dining room bright interestingly decorated course nice view famous water show  early able table right against window    was eating budget didn't order off pre fixe menu but tried things seemed recommended other people  figured if you're having italian can't wrong pasta tried braised duck pappardelle spaghetti bolognese  both excellent portions generous  definitely tell difference between freshly made pasta box pasta  well worth it    we also tried dessert vanilla panna cotta strawberry compote which very light refreshing bits citrus swimming berry sauce  nice balance tart sweetness smooth vanilla speckled panna cotta    overall nice meal but only complaint person going around asking if want picture taken which kinda touristy nice meal  <EOR> The food close 3 5 but service closer 2   Overall enjoyable experience but amazing sure worth price   used Bellagio food dining credit essentially free meal other gratuity     We seated partial fountain view which meant seat great view while other seat no view all   given option wait table full view though did ask     We seated shortly thereafter brought ipad view drink menu   settled Nino Franco Prosecco which good   sommelier bit curt he wasn't exactly impolite but he definitely warm engaging   found waiter same attitude   Both fine but did nothing all engage suggestions evening memorable     We skipped appetizers since nothing really appealed us   did bread basket which lackluster   requested balsamic vinegar add low quality olive oil which brought no problem     For entrees husband Pollo grilled chicken breast potatoes salad    chicken good but spectacular   salad handful baby spinach leaves three blackberries tossed very light simple vinaigrette   salad made very happy ordered salad appetizer clear lack attention composition salad broken bits spinach salad comprised two ingredients impressive      I Mama Egi's Ravioli which good but outstanding   pasta very thick far thick ravioli opinion   filling good   dish overall little rich did quite finish it   offered cheese ground pepper many Yelpers were     For dessert shared Grand Marnier Souffle cappuccino   souffle good enjoyed it   believe overheard waiter telling table next pre prepared then just finished Circo oven which why only take 10 12 minutes prepare   cappuccino actually outstanding good flavor impressive foam     The restaurant's ambiance overall nice enjoyed fountain view   service support staff very good particularly young man refilled water but head waiter sommelier unimpressive  total two glasses prosecco chicken entree ravioli entree souffle cappuccino $121 00 pre tip    thought bit high mediocre quality both entrees unimpressive service  <EOR> This place pretty phenomenal  booked special occasion through Open Table walking in Bellagio terrified  place looks cheesy hell outside  expecting  clown seat dinner   Luckily inside made it  decor still circus themed bit strange but more subtle way  table overlooking fountains which made something seven water shows   Maybe just cheap but I'd never restaurant levels waiter before  All whom serve me  felt Titanic pre Iceberg   date split burrata appetizer which lot mozzarella even two people  Mama Egi's pasta came much larger portion anticipated pretty happy that  pasta delicate creamy exactly should be  head waiter gentleman seemed more happy help wine recommendations but those sort things intimidate me  apple dessert incredible wish could eat every day   It's great little place if need celebrate something special if just made mad cash playing blackjack  <EOR> Overall would give restaurant 3 stars  atmosphere would describe upscale circus theme  view fountains beautiful service top notch  food mediocre  filet tenderloin  good but best steak ever had chicken dry over seasoned rosemary calamari dry flavorless creme brûlée good  When paying top dollar food expect something can't chain restaurant   would suggest going Olives instead  <EOR> Perhaps really quite good maybe began low expectations   Regardless impressions Circo splendid   originally able reservations because called just hour before but finally able reserve table without fountain view us   restaurant decor rather extravagant fact looked restaurant version Cirque du Soleil which believe going for    Anyway believe hand rolled spaghetti along another pasta dish VERY good   Speaking someone spent several months Italy ate way through delectable goodness definitely impressed   Wish bay area! <EOR> my pasta bolognese super tasty  friends steak phenom  table view staff really friendly    it honestly wasn't anything AMAZING over top but tasty good time really no complaints! <EOR> Four stars  Its toss between 3 4 4   Nice restaurant  Nice menu  Great location see fountains dining room  am sure if outside seating possibly but cold when Early November   I steak filet horseradish potatoes spinach etc    good  I'd say scale 1 10 10 being Capital Grille 6 7 husband lamb he did it  He didn't Circo general   The service good  Its almost good think just barely crosses line being rushed  came Saturday night 6 30 crowded   I'd say mostly full packed     I might try again  think if look line menu most likely disappointed  <EOR> OMG! place amazing! came getting married asking concierge palazzo incredibly romantic restaurant  food amongst best ever had  husband ordered truffle risotto $75 main worth it which incredibly creamy flavoursome ordered osso bucco where meat melted your mouth combined ceamy polenta rich gravy  exception woman front desk attitude nth degree in any other situation would walked away  She should work there! service impeccable  Loved loved circus setting ambiance restaurant overlooking water show Bellagio  <EOR> The food really good  expensive but tastes it  service very poor  talking food taking longer normal because restaurant wants converse poor  talking empty glass entire meal 30 minutes until your server takes your order poor  didn't appear though servers fault noticed he others bussing own tables   high end restaurants meant run  If spend kind've money restaurant service better good  <EOR> Due some hotel room issues treated dinner choice decided try Circo place always wanted try   busy Tuesday night further complicated celebrity 3 bodyguards 2 photographers house seated 15 minutes reservation  fine no hurry   seated must say server willingly returned spicy Bloody Mary would ruined taste buds dinner   replaced specially made blended margarita apparently bar only made rocks   made salad dinner choices told server only return 20 minutes later say lost your order having?

Aren't menus given when you're seated   Evidently Circo does different way     When restaurant advertises its pre theatre large sign website should given when regular menu   Ordering pre theatre menu doesn't less customer those order off regular menu   Before leaving main server asked if wanted more cookies politely declined   putting away credit card getting charge slips together another server came plate those cookies   politely declined again     Finally really dislike when website menu then different real one   Crème brûlée good but really wanted experience Nutella panna cotta   If you're going online menu keep to date   This would normally 4 star review if rating simply food   service off such can't give four stars   reports Circo would closing spring   If reports true service sign lack care some respect? <EOR> We hosted committees dinner all very nice time  took little long bring food but  expected group   Very careful attentive pleasant staff really difference  Very positive folks work here   The place joyously decorated very well appointed  assured two VIP sightings restaurant well outside casino   Everything tasted fresh excellently presented tasty  even re created favorite mixed drinks upon request didn't charge fortune it    though may everything else ordered!

The bread Yess fans  them tasted pan pizza crust  the whole table agreed  good!   Meals  Pappardelle Wide noodles served sausage wild mushrooms  looking forward dish think only fell short eyes because its sauce  rather its lack thereof  NO sauce just almost excessive amount melted butter covering dish  good but almost tad bland  mom sister enjoyed dish though   Mama Egi's ravioli order appetizer split another dish someone else table  Extremely delicious but also extremely rich  couldn't eat more four five mini raviolis without wanting stop because rich   Quail  never quail before sister's boyfriend ordered dish  only bite but liked tasted  He said better he used to    Dessert We ordered bombolonis donuts  ooh sugar covered goodness  Came raspberry sauce strong chocolate sauce    Overall Circo wasn't bad  wasn't bad all  its strong points but also fell short some areas  willing pay share money food Vegas wasn't cheap which fine but could much better  personally prefer Stratta over Wynn  <EOR> Ex boyfriend brought dinner birthday while Vegas  don't know why but ended 3 different servers which actually wasn't big deal me  salmon good but nothing spectacular   But could just biased since haven't come across good salmon hasn't tasted bland yet   The only reason giving them 4 stars instead 3 because table sat at  put right next window could watch bellagio fountain show would off every often  highlight evening  Plus decorations ceiling very nice  <EOR> First time dining nice restaurant inside Vegas hotel didn't quite know expect  Would slot machines table?  I pleasntly surprised Circo  First all reservation  Saturday night couldn't until 10pm without reservation  lucky able that   Most tables view water outside Bellagio  could watch water show here   On food  Excellent  better pay but service top notch  glasses never even close empty spacing between when server would visit your table just right not often    MAKE RESERVATION!!!! <EOR> Fantastic meal service food both perfect  hand rolled spaghetti bolognese sauce now am addicted hand rolled spaghetti  creamy perfectly cooked  split tiramisu dessert far best tiramisu ever had  Perfectly rich yet wonderful dark chocolate bite no alcohol aftertaste    The wait staff top game  fantastic moment enter until moment leave bathroom great too  Very soothing colors cloth napkins your hands!
