Even through all food just ok   would just avoid place somewhere else  <EOR> They very friendly efficient  But food only described mediocre definitely worth cost  <EOR> Good price goos buffet  If mlife member  het 5 00 bucks off each dinner buffet  Its little annoying though stopped serving primerib stopped putting crab legs going put only flank steak  little disappointing  dod all eat made order pasta bar  could your  own yummy pasta  dessets lacking big time though don't desserts  If beer champagne wine all drink add 7 99 bad  <EOR> The Cafe looked nice but wait 10 minutes table  Once seated noticed restaurant half empty   The menu impressive  bad food didn't match  food just below average  many other places eat would better  <EOR> Although wait staff friendly general your experience vary considerably basis time day can very busy your server sometimes just seem disappear while wait    All all food well prepared tasty when but would recommend unless big crowd keep entertained while wait interminable while your food   Sometimes arrive late breakfast time food arrives feels should ordered lunch instead   fact last time did!

After waiting 17 minutes totally barren table I finally expressed concerns server assistant brought table coffee water  Keep mind full 17 minutes sat down   The waiter Thomas finally made table seemed rude no apology service time no special attentiveness delay nothing more toll taker waiter  fact saw three times 45 minute meal no drink refills no 'how's your food' no 'can anything else' no interaction all   The restaurant all busy but he made no attempt hospitality all   If he asked would commented meal food very good but would passable if lack attentiveness meal experience especially when traveling!  Feeling annoyed again left table sought assistant manager  explained experience he simply shook head literally did say word just shook head no 'I'm sorry your experience' nothing  demeanor attitude did nothing more add frustration   On way restaurant asked hostess manager cafe she didn't know could only provide statement 'Ralph think'   An unfortunate unenjoyable experience could improved significantly little hospitality  <EOR> The good The all drink strawberry mimosas The all drink bloody ceasers The bad Way over priced The lack staff refill all drink beverages The turkey bacon swear over cooked salmon jerky My French toast sucked My husbands chicken ceaser salad sucked   Should House Blues  Left disappointed still hungry     <EOR> Had breakfast because staying upstairs Four Seasons drowsy drive  Mediocre breakfast set almost $20 each  Coffee $5 which way overpriced  would recommend unless no other choice  <EOR> If your looking away Vegas noise secret place  food overpriced?
