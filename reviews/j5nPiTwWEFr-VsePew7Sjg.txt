Really? Oh those watered down iced coffees small cups hot coffee also cost $4 50 each  3 honey toasts 6 drinks 1 soda bill came $52  more expensive delicious BBQ ribs dinner before coming place  am disappointed! <EOR> Just left place such disgust  car sure name correct write review   Whom ever hostess today absolute pits! making faces when requested all veggie rolls she made wait least fifteen minutes food packaged go  would still sitting right now if asked much longer? Vegetable rolls long does take right? When asked take out she rolled eyes slammed down whatever she doing marched over food saw sitting fifteen minutes earlier    Food packaged wasteful manner   Every roll own Styrofoam container causing roll around become unrolled   Unrolled rolls great    The All Eat location downstairs better dollar less rolls ordered here    She probably overcharged me   would surprised  <EOR> In terms having bad experience Ichiza haven't really one  Sometimes place busy servers frantically running around which sometimes leads forgotten orders but whatever if don't end paying what's harm  hankering kimchee fried rice Ika Yaki grilled squid grilled cow tongue Yellowtail tartare    I love tender grilled squid ginger sauce served alongside  kimchee fried rice just perfect amount pickled cabbage spicy but leaves wanting more  tartare phenomenal although sometimes wish actually more yellowtail less other components a stack fried wonton crisps topped sushi rice pico de gallo lettuce mix chopped yellowtail avocado  Now want some! <EOR> I think little overwhelmed first    they've lot good stuff menu even more wall menu!  Some hard read as faded writing illiterate bastard    although when comes kanji suppose call that but pretty much wanted try EVERYTHING   Since only old man ended getting fried chicken there's three different types but told server no cutlet katsu style red snapper carpaccio seared ahi tuna miso ramen yellowtail tar tar   lot food    hurt good  =P  Gotta say fan carpaccio but  just me   very well prepared quality VERY good    just first time tried based recommendation turned thing!  Everything else BOMB   ALMOST good Furaibo near hometown   Actually upon further review Ichiza more extensive menu say they're good =D  which saying lot!  Not best ever entire time upon earth    But if you're mood    strongly recommend it <EOR> No trip Las Vegas complete without trip Ichiza  family is  previous visits very hard table due crowds but particular trip able table no trouble all  Maybe due economy but maybe because Ichiza now opens lunch instead just dinner people come early instead late night  think  why always run ramen soup stock whenever around 10pm  bummer since wife craving chasu ramen   This time tried salmon ochazuke which never before  rice salmon nori green tea broth  different bad  always love miso butterfish never fails every time    Ichiza best enjoyed bunch friends love eat drink but no matter food always keep coming back more  <EOR> So far Ichiza far favorite izakaya style restaurant  don't Japan experience authentic hardcore Japanese food   My favorite ika yaki honey toast ice cream  Yummy!! <EOR> You know good when all see Asian people lined waiting seated  delightful experience   I wanted take Lover nice authentic Asian food experience  During stay Las Vegas searched places where locals eat stumbled upon Ichiza  When place packed dinner  menus scattered all over four walls all written Japanese English translations some  short simple ended visiting Ichiza twice during week long stay Sin City  good   Below managed taste Ichiza Potato crisps = mayo wasabi sauce dip  complimentary appetizer first visit   Skewered sweet peppers = little bitter taste but some nice texture worked Sapporo    Skewered beef tongue = Oh really can't express good is  just find yourselves  Perfectly seasoned   Garlic grilled baby bok choy soup =  mission perfect dish  little bit fresh crunch outside but perfectly steamed inside  soup broth AMAZING  really mouth orgasmic   Beef tataki ponzu sauce = again AMAZING  beef fresh tender just melts your mouth  Well seasoned taste layers flavor  Definitely MUST HAVE Ichiza  FYI don't even rare beef!

Try black cod honey toast two thumps up! <EOR> Great food great staff  just wish wasnt packed all time! Worth wait though! <EOR> This go to restaurant whenever Vegas  miso cod honey toast must  rest really personal preference  girlfriend always hamachi which decent  Sometimes share big table if crowded but good price point quality food  <EOR> Classic Izakaya aka beer food good times  usually few items  Yellowtail tartare beef tataki grilled salmon belly Agedashi tofu sashimi salad uni mochi  switch picking choosing few items menu wall! Sashimi salmon yellowtail okonomiyaki oysters ponzu sauce beef tongue stew seafood quesadilla jalapeño fried rice etc  list on  Great place share bunch food   I visit Vegas maybe once twice year  frequent Ichiza many times  pretty close strip not really walking distance take cab! located Chinatown  If large party accommodate but call reservation   Oh dessert! Try Honey Toast  Its pretty amaze  <EOR> So keep mind would give 5 stars fact inland but would probably 3 star if rate against other izakaya Japan   I visited 12 22 dinner Las Vegas Bowl   atmosphere typical izakaya would find Japan won't dock any points since actually supposed fairly dingy but good food   Maybe typical crowd would minus   The zashiki tatami booths back typical Japanese rowdy college crowd playing loud drinking games which again would probably minus most   This place always crowded even though reservation I say loosely because don't think really take reservations except large groups rowdy college group wait 20 minutes seat large table front   However table cleared reseated more comfortable location   The servers all Japanese which helped some easier order Japanese explain things   Also rate order which food came typical Japan randomly whenever ready   comfort factor there   The draught beer bit better normal places where actually head beer but still use Canadian made stuff think bubbles aren't creamier kind but thinner kind   often disappointed Japanese beer totally different   We had Spinach sesame dressing bit more dressing usual but still good  Garlic baby bok choy nice crunchy light flavor except garlic chips which added little umphh it  Mackerel miso yaki standard decent miso yaki  Motsu ni used red miso just ok  Tsukune chicken meatball skewers just right amount browning  Shishito pepper skewers little spicy side  Crab fried rice tad greasy side  Beef bowl little beef behold but broth good  Sour plum chazuke didn't taste can't comment   I liked all dishes except crab fried rice bit oily   satisfied izakaya fix   But come back other items weren't written menu but wall menu   If you're looking fine Japanese dining but if you're missing izakaya scene Japan until your next visit there   4 stars all around service atmosphere can't exactly call ambience food keeping mind supposed bit unkempt side izakaya  <EOR> Great food! Great environment! Good service  great place try something new! Each time if something looks appetizing ask know order next time  Cons smells kinda funny  Overwhelming amount options shut down few times due health code violations  yet sick tho  <EOR> My friend never more happy take her  own selfish reasons course We arrived soon opened doors dinner seated right away  proceeded order following items   1  Sashimi plate probably t freshest sashimi plate ever experienced 2  Butterfish black cod 3  Pork Belly 4  Beef tongue 5  Chicken skewers  6 Soft Shell crab 7  Ama Ebi 8  Tofu 9  Uni 10  Mackerel 11 Shrimp Tempura 12  Vegetable Tempura  They all flavorful tasty  Great price    The service great  keep asking refills napkins  food it  <EOR> I heard place often finally come try out  initially made reservation 3 6 30pm when showed party 5   no problem accomodating even though clearly busy   there's great vibe ordered practically everything off menu! started takoyaki chicken gizzard skewers tofu agedashi fried squid udon noodles  then finale    Honey Toast!!  staff super pleasant very helpful   I would definitely back again order rest menu <EOR> It's along same lines Honda Ya OC but much more crowded   Food pretty good but you'll stay active flag down servers additional orders refills etc    Gosh such flurry dishes ordered can't remember all   honest can't think anything stood if did remember don't remember names guess you'll count other yelpers that   remember only couple dishes standouts rest fairly good   But best part price   picked tab 6 people $120   small eaters   stuffed beyond belief consider great reason come addition late night hours   also provide pitchers sake continue Vegas drinking tradition risk sobering even second   = Worst part service   guess vegas thing anomaly bc every other Japanese restaurant seems pride themselves first foremost quick friendly efficient service   But girls looked frazzled everyone young care   All waitresses available help but even then lookout any chance flag them down   Immediately upon entering you'll notice third dishes available order posted many separate pieces paper all walls restaurant   Since getting old eyesight worsening walk around view every additional dish menu   little annoying sure other diners didn't appreciate hovering close table while mentally checked specials   came Sunday night party 6   wait 30 minutes before table freed could accommodate us   place pretty small but Ichiza's credit people big large community table seemed together some meeting didn't leave time arrived past time left   ran honey toast which read other yelpers being problem but hard keep supplies around honey toast?  But I'd probably come again bc Ichiza represents break away buffets excessiveness Las Vegas really did enjoy myself once sat down   Also account Ichiza's value skyrocketing if come late night even 12AM   Price $120 6 people ton food Food Good Very Good Service Mediocre Ambiance OK specials wall long wait sit down hurt it Location Good It's strip mall few other restaurants none which packed parking fairly abundant although crazy Monterey Park strip mall   <EOR> the best japanese food town    hands down   eel kakiage tempura roll beef bowl natto roll egg drop soup tofu salad katsu shrimp tempura asian style omlette ramen yakisoba honey toast dessert all other items posted all walls restaurant! <EOR> Avoid going all costs  girlfriend dined 3 28 18 food poisoning result visit  completely incapacitated following 24 hours  used frequent customer establishment but no longer be  Attempted contact restaurant owner inform them experience no avail  Reporting Southern Nevada Health District  urge all others avoid dining here  <EOR> Definitely locals find   Thanks yelp   same great fun open atmosphere usually expect good Japanese restaurant   Memorable dish Ahi Tuna Salad and      So all talk Honey Toast?  quite hesitant because toast +honey+butter+a scoop ice cream many citings yelp reviews   and $10  because yelpers try it   and must say THANK YOU  most scrumptiously delicious dessert eaten long time   great natural honey sweetness creamy vanilla ice balance  all top huge piece buttered crispy toast gave awesome texture      So why 5 star?

Small place try avoid busy times  <EOR> Hands down favorite Japanese restaurant Vegas  Very authentic food well some modern twists  Beef Tataki tongue wasabi octopus oh bacon wrapped mochi  Small location generally wait times but worth it  Late night hours also huge plus  Every chance try come when town  here! Trust fat kid <EOR> We late night snack  place packed    At first saw alot customers Japanese  good sign right? really   food mediocre pricey small   On other hand atmosphere very lively very hip  Most patrons party goers young crowds came club hopping  Also staffs all young Japanese girls very good looking ones way no way screw service   So if don't mind spending little money your heart food  feel hip  <EOR> If want reasonable pricing good japanese food Vegas off strip restaurant definitely place   Don't expect great service though but definitely open late   honey toast good also    Don't order Bonito cut thick tasted very fishy good compared other places   Sake Udon Ramen   pretty good also   Big bonus   located next Tea Station 0 <EOR> This place great reasons rent car when vist Vegas it's still close enough where taxi   great little izakaya very reasonably priced  never disappointed anything ordered only thing gets tricky figuring since there's many things and all wall   menu give doesn't show everything   think should print list all stuff wall hand rather trying see what's available   Some things enjoy recommendation would order whatever sounds appealing share your friends Beef Tataki Rare slices beef Hamachi tartare mixed w avocado served fried wonton wrappers Salmon skin salad pretty large portion your daily dose roughage Honey Toast save room dessert! <EOR> YellowTail Tartar toast crackers! Awesome  Peppery egg drop soup good Avg  But good Spyder Roll <EOR> My parents visiting LA all restaurants chose Ichiza  Big mistake  Wow! am shock service tonight  3 times never problem until tonight  moment walked waitress sat door parents didn't want sit because cold  asked sit somewhere else she would move even though half restaurant empty  confusing did sense    Then continued order two specific problems encountered  1 ordered garlic bok choy  Granted never ordered before but 4 95 literally 3 bites bok choy  honestly say stem broken into individual pieces  blew mind!! almost thought joke  Yes everything small but beyond small portion miniature  thought no way be?  Then ordered 2 tuna sashimi salads asked dressing side  She brought small bowl half filled ponzu sauce which dressing used salad then she brought small bowl filled sesame oil  Ok no thanks dont want pour oil right onto dressing  asked more bowl ponzu sauce she made biggest deal sending back talking everyone it like crazy asking something ordinary  sorry but two salads don't think its difficult bring two bowls dressing side smile  order dressing side everywhere acted alien asking way  she brings back literally 1 tablespoon ponzu big bowl  WOW! humiliated embarassed took parents telling them really good place  know always trust food taste blown away waitress  Now don't want judge place simply waitress but both waitresses way guy back shook head when she brought back oil ask was  guess she didn't know sesame oil looks even though she works should know menu????? Poor service again  If customer asks more dressing bring it  paid %60 food  least do  Also waitresses never came refill water ask if everything ok even once  guess she pissed off dressing incident    Now don't want sound those annoying people thing wrong change mind restaurant  But if am going bring town visitors am loyal customer think deserve some decent service  never come back never tell others come here  Also am missing anything the food really ok not bad but WAY better elsewhere  Ichiza broken forever! <EOR> Being town stumbled upon restaurant during late night when most other restaurants winding down closed  significant other drove around looking place eat revisited plaza whim  outside looks pretty normal unexciting  walked around saw place took leap faith entered inside where quickly seated  reminded izakaya style servings Japan pictures food walls addition some repeated actual menu misspellings all   laid back relaxed vibe  starving wanted something filling udon ramen side maki roll  food came fast tasted point! both pleasantly surprised  whole experience reminiscent visits Japan although obviously much different but closest could aren't many options Orlando!    If chance revisit Las Vegas area place would list  <EOR> Coming MUST whenever Vegas! Honestly eating down strip great but  costly food just starts much  Exploring areas outside strip lead Ichiza which probably favorite restaurant Vegas now    The wait little long  recommend ordering off specials listed wall just ignore menu! <EOR> First time trying Ichiza  must say lots special fishes  ordered Butter black cod pretty good Stir fried gizzard liked it Spider roll don't worth price  Yellowtail tar tar ordered because everyone said its good would order again though  Salmon chazuke I'd recommend chopped salmon small pieces think would've taste better  Beef tataki really good!  must order dish    Beef Tongue skewer think alright Agedashi Tofu this   Raw tuna appetizer forgot name its different but didn't it  I believe back place if visited Vegas again! <EOR> I lived Las Vegas almost 10 years luckier game fine dining most people entire lives  Ichiza spots miss most  crave all time hope fine substitute S F  area someday soon  Unfortunately only discovered during last 6 months thanks late night dinners japanese yoga guru Yuko  best Izakaya ever to  If organs business liver stew die for  sake soju cocktail selections wonderful well   You must open mind empty stomach truly enjoy your dining experience  Warning may feel if some time warped Sin City Shinjuku  Don't worry if O D  sake always downstairs Zizzy's sing your self sober some karaoke  <EOR> Outside Japan better izakaya  rare find US   Generally izakayas don't necessarily amazing food it good case but should good drink menu stay open late  Ichiza lacks somewhat shochu department beer selection wasn't huge either however food prices all really reasonable give +1 star based that   would all time if lived near Spring Mountain  <EOR> Bad experience  hostess lady short hair standing front restaurant rude unwelcoming  She didn't want give corner table although no she standing awkwardly waiting until another waiter stepped probably told just give table when no there! other empty tables open but she wanted wait table leave! No ever came coke refill when cup empty staff just standing around  food did anything better either  Udon stir fry bad sourness rice gravy salty salmon collar salty on! Nothing special worth it  Also food started burning whole restaurant coughing horribly  <EOR> By far favorite restaurant town!

Service very fast very friendly  going back tomorrowwwww <EOR> The problem service   When arrived first person encountered server look confusion when 1st interacted deer in the headlights expression started complement performance server   When 1st arrived tell 2 baby    she glances around some free tables tells need wait   stand some time until manager approaches bit surprised look face quickly sits vacant tables girl glanced at   ask server high chair son    stand 5 minutes until manager approaches gets one   food took long server never came check never any drinks refilled hunt down server check     I want clear place good take kids to   son actually great restaurants   son doesn't throw tantrums throw food run around   He sits high chair some noise nothing crazy eats   Granted there's gonna some food floor but  worst it   When server saw food floor    deer in headlights   honestly 1 2 cup scattered noodles rice floor   She responded though took everything ordered threw all over restaurant!  Don't wrong    food excellent!  saw many Japanese couples around restaurant eating which huge sign wife place would most likely authentic   quality freshness food proved outstanding   wife San Francisco used frequenting Japan town authentic Japanese food place seemed  authentic used to   Quick conclusion bad service don't bring young children authentic delicious Japanese food <EOR> We Las Vegas few days having eating GIANT portions great food casino's restaurants strip wanted some Asian food outskirts town   First best restaurant saw Ichiza yelp   definitely lived expectations   food awesome service great price right   Dinner 4 cost 94 dollars stuffed    think tried 15 different dishes   pretty extensive standard menu but posted all over restaurant small placards new dishes try some which did try great   If looking Japanese food Vegas place go   Hands down  <EOR> Order everything menu loved every single peice ate #delicious <EOR> Salmon Sashimi fresh!!!

Then  called complain but all owner said was   uhuh   uhuh    well if eat presentation good   uhuh   uhuh   He wasn't even listening   rude   felt very unimportant insulted all years recommended place everyone wants eat late   Anyway  second final review place   huge difference if guys care read first review   sorry Ichiza but just lost customer   guys care anyway   <EOR> We dinner  packed line door  don't eat sushi but husband does  sat sushi bar behind traditional Japanese table floor mats kneeling  Japanese pop music background all diners Asian speaking variety languages  felt transported Japan  beef curry stew rice  good but best Japanese curry had  husband ordered several sushi rolls  all very good large portions price  sushi menu huge specials posted all over walls sushi bar  ordered charsu pork roll think pork bun but came sushi style rice rolled nori wrapper  good  nice chilled sake presented little square box cup  very good   We definitely back  <EOR> Went group 8 all disappointed  Thought would good reviews  people more adventurous seafood still didn't stuff much  just really wanted good sushi rolls if want come here    FOOD Spider Roll 2 stars Really dry really plain    Tar Tar Roll 3 stars sushi tostada  Pretty good just better spider roll     Eel roll 3 stars Probably best roll 3 tried  Flavorful dry  Just very healthy because fried stuff top    Black cod fish 4 stars Perfectly cooked  Best thing here    SERVICE 2 stars Didn't menus chopsticks plates until asked them  also really hot inside hotter outside Las Vegas summer we're talking about! also smelled inside  big group back tables where need take your shoes off sit down   probably why place smelled   knows what's peoples feet  gross!  Overall place rolls  really didn't any them much just ate cause hungry  Stick entrees maybe? Well maybe since other people group all different entrees weren't impressed all either  <EOR> Since moving Vegas New York City really struggled find great food reasonable prices   always heard people say youre lucky live nyc best food! but never believed talk until left   really disappointed most food here   seems unless want spend ton money most meals just mediocre found same true Ichiza   Walking liked atmosphere busy lots locals little choatic prepared great meal all fantastic reviews   first two dishes had seaweed salad garlic stir fried bok choy probably best things ate all night   simply prepared indgredients fresh   We moved broiled butterfish which way greasy finish   sushi which especially looking forward quality would find NYC supermarket   avocado spider roll browning crabmeat fresh   tuna spinach roll fine but fish nothing very memorable   Maybe learned lesson youve gotta drop some cash eat well Vegas   steer clear fish land locked state!  I would back anyone appreciates fresh fish ingredients stay away  <EOR> Located Chinatown area off Spring Mountain Road mixed reviews spot  having between 6 8 times impressions 1  late night dining option plus  2  long lines avoid weekends all costs   3  Cozy interior more half menu items tacked onto wall    nice touch    4  Staff welcoming but service seems level off there  5  Food service marginal best timing ordering process accuracy etc  6  Food selection quality decent but better Japanese cuisine there    I enjoy going once while but visits becoming less less frequent    Likelihood returning next month? 20%  Likelihood returning next 6 months? 50% <EOR> I'm sad report Ichiza changed significantly  honestly don't know happened behind scenes new owner? new manager? all cooks quit? but restaurant bears little resemblance its former self  food noticeably worse selections far fewer place way less crowded I realize being crowded isn't positive feature its own right but lack customers and place used crowded until 3am sign only person noticed Ichiza's changes worse  <EOR> This place very delicious Japanese food  order yellow tail tar tar takoyaki agedashi tofu sashimi platter name few  quality each food item beyond expectation  only downfall forget bring your food items  follow them waiting  took while bring food then also forgot some dishes  still charged  But other service friendly food amazing <EOR> Came late around 1am party 3  packed  place located  heart Chinatown upstairs    The location small  Definitely suitable BIG groups  probably accommodate work but snug there    Very very very authentic menu  recommend ordering menu wall  even menu all Japanese place traditional comes  pretty much order anything request order it  Just don't know much charge     The raw shaken beef appetizer must try  Very very  delicious doesn't taste raw    just melts your mouth    We also salmon nigiri  Super fresh tasting  also udon seaweed salad  Definitely different way seaweed presented prepared    Everything taste wonderful definitely very traditional  bit expensive side but Japanese expected  But definitely worth it  <EOR> My friends swear place regularly dragged along late night   The service acceptable   great bad   I ordered katsudon soda taste second   bill $15   outrageous   All Donburi rice bowls menu $6 $7 dollars   served Tonkatsu asked if katsudon said yes just hadn't updated menu while hence why wasn't there   No pretty damn sure reason wasn't hit charging double price when bill   $12 50 rice bowl insane   never across four states two countries paid more $10 basic rice bowl   tonkatsu plate menu $9 obviously wasn't pork vs chicken caused price raise  alone reason would back   don't getting cheated bill if going pay level upcharge better spectacular service eating strip   At least katsudon wasn't bad   wasn't particularly good but least wasn't bad   pork chop cutlet whatever pretty small but tasted fine  <EOR> A very well rounded japanese restaurant! Back where yay Canada! japanese restaurants primarily AYCE restaurants run chinese people all menus look same  Ichiza however offers unique menu combination flavours never seen heard anywhere else! ex  bacon wrapped mochi  who would've thought that! Overall would definitely recommend big group try most menu believe certainly worth try! If offer criticism though would say Bread thing ice cream kind over hyped  Didn't find all special  yummy but nothing unique  end day though Ichiza probably favourite japanese restaurant far <EOR> I haven't year two   Reason being last time walked friend smelled bad  turned off almost thought pregnant!  Well walked tonight same disgusting smell if didn't wait long seat probably would tolerated stayed   Weak sauce cool back its hay day! <EOR> As long time fan over 10 years  reason take vacation Las Vegas  owner ethnic restaurant Santa Monica more 20 years would give review owner adjust better  No body Sushi Sashimi better Japanese  No No other Japanese  food used great sad change  love place want ever  <EOR> as far festive japanese ish style places eat give 4 5 5  sometimes its wait table but most part worth it  seated laminated menu however majority menu plastered all over walls throughout restaurant similar small restaurant say sakae nagoya japan       the only thing missing in which fly japan specifically eat place called Yayoiken Chicken Karaage  If Karaage id eating almost everyday   is place fun food culture  <EOR> ok took off some stars b c menus IMPOSSIBLE order from   basic menu  60% restaurant's offering it  then theres 2 little stand document holders desserts other stuff it   everything else wall   seriously kind pain butt lazy walk around entire restaurant check offerings   didn't see uni mochi chawanmushi most pics yelp menu   HONEY TOAST MUST place   little pricey $6 95 pieces toast honey butter inside along huge scoop ice cream but HUGE   save room it   pretty damn good   way better guppy's brick toast tea station's toast   skewers def  think honda ya tustin lot better   but decent probably wouldn't gizzard liver again  they little squishy even gizzard liver!  beef tongue pretty good though very tender   there's probably 5 different skewers choose from   minus stars lack variety unless more options other ones menu   a very plausible possibility everything tasted bit over salted im guessing drink more beer???  agedashi tofu wasn't crispy enough just soggy   salmon skin salad good enough but enough lettuce just lots salty salmon skin       i think if you've never honda ya shinsengumi yakitori would definietly give place 4 stars if you've never japanese izakaya would def  give place 5 stars   but give 3 stars because everything overly salty lot clientele seems people don't eat lot izakaya   but 3 stars honey toast!!! <EOR> The worst restaurant never seen  don't know why service bad never come back   <EOR> HONEY TOAST    I don't need say anything more place  honey toast  it  Now    Ramen average but tapas delicious  jalapeño fried rice panko quail eggs bacon fries pork tenderloin pork belly  <EOR> This place good wanted say amazing  Ordered few specials all tasty but nothing blew socks off  read place think maybe just hyped much  If lived nearby would probably stop lunch late night but certain across town just return  say beef tongue mushroom butter excellent definitely would recommend that  Staff super nice friendly  honey toast is   toast honey ice cream  wish could give 3 5 stars better accurately reflect opinion definitely better average but favorite Vegas  <EOR> I picked place based solely Yelp reviews looking feed large party   wanted excellent food but given size party length stay wanted keep cost economical least evening   Ichiza perfect   I think I'd back 40 times even believe tried everything   Everything ordered great food fresh tasty     unusual too   Starting beef tongue skewers which deliberately called beef skewers friends very good most ate theirs even knew though some them chickened expected   Uni topped ricecakes wrapped seaweed tofu salad bbq squid hamachi dishes galore other terrific things   server made few recommendations simply no way pick given huge variety items wall menus   Our party 14 did sit bit parted two tables next another area side where take your shoes off  sit down   intimate enough but would nicer if large table but small restaurant so     My table which consisted 6 people separate bill   ordered LOT food stuffed gills time left   also ordered least 5 6 bottles unfiltered sake     which friends pounded Gatorade   All all between six all food alcohol merely came $33 per person   Economical indeed   Ichiza while located far strip second floor Chinatown strip mall  definitely worth visit your trip Vegas   Excellent food friendly casual atmosphere good service   guaranteed good evening   FYI use website reservations   Being worrywart called few days having made web reservations confirm party's reservation indeed existent   Good thing did because no record it   am sure happened but then proceeded freak ask if still come Friday said perfectly fine   if going large party plan reservations  pick phone call   use website     <EOR> Kinda hard add anything new other notch bedpost Ichiza  high expectations delightfully surpassed  group 5 ordered ton food beer sake just pointing items wall random bill totally reasonable I think less $40 person   Everything fresh delicious exquisitely prepared  service so so but cares when your taste buds dancing Macarena your tongue? Hamachi collar phenomenal red snapper carpaccio honey toast  can't remember everything ordered but nothing disappointing  much touted bacon wrapped mochi good but really just tastes bacon ain't nuthin' wrong just sayin'   <EOR> Went back Ichiza again even better last time  Wifey ordered gazillion dishes because drunk hungry always  all fucking Vegas! Anyways food remember ordering following dishes Uni  Red Snapper Carpaccio Wasabi Octopus Yellowtail Tar Tar Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab Grilled Gobo Pork Pork Belly Skewers Shiso Spicy Fried Chicken Fried Smelt   Although uni isn't fresh shell still tasted amazing  Ichiza hollows whole lemon puts uni into cavity lemon cucumber slices ponzu sauce fresh wasabi  sour salty flavors yummilicious moaning walker The Walking Dead   Mmmnnnguuuhhh!

The yellowtail tar tar good but hard eat  pretty big mouth barely able fit whole piece in  Looking around realized maybe supposed eat pieces  Regardless combination fried chips rice salsa marinated raw yellowtail avocado something think may implement Casa del Ricardo  Thanks Ichiza!  The deep fried soft shell crabs tasty but really made dish ponzu daikon sauce  ended drinking sauce asking more  Also am huge fan gobo combination grilled pork gobo pure bliss    Only two items tasted meh  pork belly shiso just so so spicy fried chicken worst dish ordered  consisted fried chicken marinated gochu jang Korean chili paste made chicken way salty  think should just gotten JFC Japanese Fried Chicken aka karaage    However saved best last  fried smelt  Yes simple but just fucking wonderful  Western cuisine animal aspect taken away fish  mean order fish filets restaurants no fucking bones  order fish chips fish deep fried no idea type fish even eating  Well Ichiza's fried smelt case  three whole smelt fish all glory head to tail  amazing little fish exploding roe  fact fish 90% eggs!

Great food reasonable prices large selection choose from   octopus cucumber salad chicken yakitori grilled squid miso soup   Everything delicious service excellent  Def  worth visiting  <EOR> I've since teeny bopper years roller coaster! remember use much different now  some reason food just good use be  chefs appear same least them can't quite pin point why  flavors just isn't there  example always order jalapeño fried rice gets worse everytime order it  Por que?!! love joint twist Japanese cuisine but definitely improve quality consistency  Service still decent  Maybe need bring back #TBT  <EOR> I didn't even know place until friend wanted meet somewhere middle where live thought China Town  looked Yelp figure where should eat  starving!   I discovered gem  They've open 14 years! busy but only 5 minutes wait  parking lot sucks but find park next door China Town Mall if need to    I hungry but wasn't feeling well perfect tapa style dishes  read Yelp food items wall different menu items but better excited ask those  She recommended couple Yelp also helped figure dishes order off menu    I wish took pictures everything but hungry only picture! ordered lot perfect amount fullness after  variety healthy seaweed salad sushi sushim blue fin Colombiai fried goodness fried chicken skewers chicken gizzards    The menu could little overwhelming since its large looks really Japanese but just ask waitress recommendations! felt needed piece paper write all numbers down!

They just everything imagine menu  even including menu items posted all around walls even above sushi bar  little bit overload first time looking menu then checking wall some items pictures item   ordered few things off menu item off wall    The beef tongue excellent kim chee fried rice good sashimi plate they offered two different types awesome tuna hamachi  mackerel star beef tataki ponzu sauce raw beef thinly cut mixed ponzu dipping sauce could order ten those content happy interesting things mochi wrapped bacon pork butt dish    Talk small place holds less then hundred people need some patience depending time day week  take reservations two hours only two hours before if want walk hopefully long wait  waited maybe half hour bad  parking much around building since lots business same building  park regular Chinatown   I great experience look forward next visit  <EOR> Quickly sat table 3 45pm Tuesday  happened happy hour  Half off Kirin beer  bottle blueberry sake hot green tea   blueberry sake sparkling sweet   ramen balanced flavor   black cod good firm texture little fishier prefer  Mini corn dogs curry batter very light   juicy crunch them  dipped spicy mayo  yellowtail sashimi mixed avocado served over rice tomato onion sandwiched between looked similar fried wonton  nice fresh tasting crispy part flaky hard  Nicely put together   REALLY wanted honey toast   only little more room left boyfriend didn't want any  didn't think would worth spending almost $8 dessert could finish alone  service quick attentive   happy food here  Total before tax $61 13  <EOR> Ichiza missed thee   This place open some time now used come beef bowls  delicious! But foodie am today didn't see food same way care all great things offer   But now Yelp side  discovered new side Ichiza  amazingly delicious side  seems if secret menu something because most items saw pictures Yelp listed menu provided  must posted walls though but can't read all cause all over place  awkward when trying read items off wall because people think staring awkwardly them   So whipped phone pulled Yelp ordered food based off pictures! Started off deep fried baby octopus which thought would dipping sauce but server said flavors already octopus  she right! seasoned well fried perfectly   Then Uni Ponzu sauce  love some Uni! yummy  Small little order but worth it  Very fresh  then yellowtail tartar  best! price worth it  sure if ate properly though didn't seem easy eat cleanly  Then pork shiso leaf looked big picture small order nothing special can't remember other stuff got  But definitely disappointed anything   But MAIN reason chose Ichiza evening dining Honey Toast! bigger thought  green tea ice cream rather vanilla  delicious  didn't room try other desserts crepe mochi wanted to  But visiting often many opportunities      We arrived dine around 10 15p busy but still couple seats available  sat bar right next server station saw all food coming out  Yellowtail tartar very popular good reason! Service good asian place  quick    Only thing feel am missing some other goodies because isn't listed menu but rather all walls  But thank goodness yelp! isn't fancy restaurant but cozy authentic Japanese place good pricing   Oh since sat bar see sushi chef cut whole fish into sushi  Interesting We ordered 6 items dessert totaled $42 soem change  honey toast priciest item good    but dunno if worth it  home much cheaper! <EOR> Oh man know everyone just loves place    Well couple times usually beef bowls     So time around decided more specialty stuff    So lots different things pork onions skewers beef tongue skewers buttered clams hamachi sashimi beef carpaccio miso cod salmon Kama     The skewers ok good kyaras but ok  clams ok well but little salty liking  Hamachi sashimi good  beef carpaccio oily  Miso cod such disappointment mushy very salty just lacked sweet flavor usually other places  salmon Kama also salty didn't seem cooked right   Surprisingly compared other reviews actually thought service great  very attentive   Sorry maybe off night <EOR> I traveling work Vegas wanted try something different before flight out  found decided try it  seemed very traditional or shoud say authentic?   seems place native japanese would go  Much food items part typical American palette  food good service good  biggest challenge Japanese hard understand ordering  would great translator  <EOR> Been bookmarked try ages     We happened driving around 6pm realized might early enough snag table without much wait  No such luck  hour estimate sent back car power nap  When returned however found name crossed off many others  Alas line moved lot faster estimate ended only 20 min aware even overestimates happen    Along overwhelming menu which said basic walls wallpapered handwritten flyers various specials  wasn't easy see everything table mates already seemed figure lay land and 'best of' yelp followed suit few best loved dishes  would loved walk around read everything   The grilled squid great  served more less lukewarm temperature sliced width wise but presented whole light sauce grated fresh ginger side  tender grilled flavor nicely balanced others  also substantial filling  agedashi tofu also great  really liked mochi wrapped bacon  bacon neither overly salty nor fatty nor chewy just thin non overpowering sheath mochi  tried chicken gizzard yakitori which neither liked  chewy gristly nondescript  also sushi fresh eel ? top liked   The honey toast yeah large probably much two seemed right four us  honey soaked bread underneath ice cream motherlode  I'd try home sometime  seems simple but really good! Definitely gotta come back try more stuff!  Quick Update almost year later 12 30 13   highly recommend reservations above any type food recommendations here  Despite vast experience gentleman front estimates far unpredictable  Last year he overestimated 40 minutes hour wait  Today he underestimated 50 minutes 30 minute wait  However year baby major understimation ended deal breaker which rough since already waited 40 min only told that  <EOR> This place very good   While Vegas wanted local eat locals rave about   yelped what's around found authentic japanese place     We ordered Beef Tongue really really good   Very flavorful but little bit chewy side    Miso Ramen Tastes ones Japan   Authentic hint spicy   pork rib inside soup die well perfectly cooked egg    Just right    Red Snapper Carpacio ordered reading reviews Yelp   just okay me   snappers sit lemon slices wasn't sure if should eat whole thing just fish   presentation nicely done though  Gyoza pretty much tastes same everywhere   It good back next night time Beef Tongue time tastes less chewy really good Soy sauce ramen think Miso tastes better   soy sauce bit plain didn't come pork rib   cha shiu instead which pork slices    Chicken Gizzards Very good   Perfectly grilled!

friends invited Ichiza boy pleasantly surprised  Back Hawaii izakaya eateries common being heavily influenced Japanese culture all did expect GOOD authentic izakaya restaurant Vegas! honestly loved food atmosphere would hesitate eat again again   Anyway ordered ton food  No nigiri sushi least night visited but sashimi grilled items delicious  won't list everything but faves beef tataki hamachi sashimi pork belly w shiso skewers red snapper carpaccio miso butterfish pork ramen grilled garlic shiokara  much more menu wanted try but could fit any more food tummy!  Prices really reasonable compared other izakaya style places to  cozy atmosphere made feel right home  busy night but waitresses really friendly helpful    Will see soon Ichiza! <EOR> I liked place though uninformed little intimidating   seated bar regular table low table cushions   give small little menu but real menu pieces paper handwritten prices English Japanese posted walls all over restaurant   If you're looking fine dining experience where waitstaff holds your hand through entire meal you'll little lost Ichiza   ahead walk around look walls things you'd order   They're all pretty cheap   The servers attentive friendly always keep your glass full don't worry that   don't drink often almost always driver wasn't able sample sake such but ramen beef curry red snapper dish all excellent though ramen wasn't exactly taste looking for   little soy sauce spices perked right though!  I recommend beef curry but time playing safe   more adventurous next time but meanwhile recommend place   comfy any fun if you're tense  <EOR> Sad but true place really did live hype garnered yelp  fateful day last weekend hubby rolled upstairs location politely greeted wait staff  Looking around seemed quite empty but course could because literally within 5 minutes opening hour  hunger pangs gripping stomach full day gambling walking around Las Vegas strip ready pounce anything waitress brought out    Even hungry no redeeming quality bacon wrapped asparagus brought before us  Unlike other yakitori concoctions other izakaya's California lacked smoky charred goodness want come back another bite  Worst yet somehow stuck oldest asparagus spears market literally spat fibrous outside tissues   ummm  yeah   it wasn't pretty    To add insult injury miso cod overly salty which understand sometimes case but yet experience Japanese restaurant left many bones cod fillet place  spitting bones other  think chef counter saw darted eyes away    Suffice say probably coming back next time town  Love Japanese food love izakayas but definitely did love place  <EOR> We made reservations did wait table although put big table then asked move received drinks smaller table accommodate larger party   Liked any thing yakitori chicken meatballs chicken gizzards okra kim chi fried rice gyoza potstickers agedashi tofu yellow tail tar tar pork belly  So so service flag people down lot having walk around place see all items wall udon  Overall very good izakaya place worth drive off strip try something more authentic  back try some items did to  <EOR> One best Sushi restaurants Las Vegas!

But oh yes was! am now bonafide Ichiza fan  Living Japan few months fairly picky Japanese food  place takes all Japanese comfort foods puts them place  party 4 shared 16 different dishes lot which recommended waitress ALL which mouth watering good  wasn't single dish wouldn't order again  can't wait next trip back Vegas eat again  <EOR> I love Ichiza live nearby Saturday night when sushi kayas que 45 minutes decided try something new  few friends came super hungry! ordered sashimi steak appetizer California roll two bowls ramen some pork dumplings beef bowl  All food came 80 dollars  wanted check seperated but no real receipt couldn't read servers handwriting other everything delicious even though felt raise hand wave flag if wanted refill glance server  Food good maybe lessbusy night service good too  <EOR> Awesome interesting inexpensive place   japanese tapas place   Lots small plates feels local college bar   place picky eaters but if want spend some time eating all kinds different exotic tasty bites here   honey bread ice cream dish dessert also bakery next door awesome   Oh ya girls work cute friendly  <EOR> Despite all reviews warning needing reservation came Sunday night no reservation group 6 around 7pm seated immediately    The options endless many posted around restaurant rather tiny menu hand you   We Mackerel Iso yaki favorite dish  Must get! fish deliciously savory yet soft same time  good    Salad tuna tofu second favorite dish  loved way cold tofu paired salad tuna sesame oil    Chicken egg rice bowl quite good flavors come together really well  If you're looking something filling this    Egg custard super smooth delicious also filled umami flavor mushroom I'm more used seafood flavored egg custard but version surprisingly delicious    Iko yaki grilled squid actually underwhelmed dish but think others enjoyed it    Chicken gizzard really liked skewer  Nice crunchy   Chicken skewer Super juicy chicken skewer   Beef liver Wasn't huge fan because texture  But if cooked liver you'd probably fan this   Beef tongue really good super savory juicy  liked lot    Seaweed Salad seaweed salad expecting  Rather green seaweed red seaweed bunch lettuce  sure I'd again    Ponzu uni good but underwhelming  I'd probably opt something else   Yellowtail Tartar felt fish wasn't particularly fresh just being masked avocado crunchy cracker  Wasn't impressed   Kimchi fried rice surprisingly liked although some friends didn't enjoy it  I'd just share   Prices reasonable opt super cheap meal chicken egg bowl moderately priced sushi sashimi offering    All all great food drinks nice atmosphere just chill chat friends  <EOR> remember Angelina Jolie when she married Billy Bob?  long time because now refined philanthropist mother of Jolie Pitt clan paparazzi shy actress does all resemble Angelina those times controversial grungy FUN   Ichiza old Angelina plus delicious!  Atmosphere timid eater likely share tables strangers may even share tables strangers well shoes less them   But if making friends over sake exotic meats fish then come order drink start staring    other people strips paper glued walls which much menu written most them far away end seeming you're staring other patrons anyways !  Did mention restaurant shy?    The current Angelina does seem eat but old did she probably devoured things chicken gizzards skewered stir fried beef liver beef tongue all which tasty Ichiza   personal favorites buttery beef tongue chewy skewered gizzards     If present Ms  Jolie did eat she'd probably enjoy tofu sashimi salad refreshing cold tofu top quality fish over fresh romaine avocado zesty sesame vinagrette approved anorexic starlets   Okay all Angelina talk aside love Ichiza most because grain epiphany happened hole in the wall Japanese treasure broiled rice balls best thing happened anyone  fan slightly burned crispy rice   balls not Angelina fantasy sorry disappoint some you made Ichiza convert  <EOR> Great late night eat! Buta kimchee curry only couple good eats there   pretty much always packed reservation prepared wait because very big restaurant   workers all very friendly always smiling   ordered bottle kirin once wasn't very cold they probably just stocked fridge but other they'll seeing again! <EOR> Possibly favorite restaurant Vegas  used lot busier but guess izakaya boom slowed down bit  definitely know what's good because lot choices some just alright    From regular menu MUST miso black cod  butteriest silkiest most delicious fish you'll ever eat  Other great picks share group kushi katsu yakitori shumai  ramen also really good but little heavy tapas easy share    The key order stuff off walls  best are Mochi wrapped bacon  Each skewer 2 3 pieces mochi  Sticky greasy awesome  Jalapeno fried rice  top choice next miso cod  Mix spicy paste!

Croquettes  specials croquettes ask them  gratin croquette filled macaroni covered gravy  Otherwise regular potato ones  Okonomiyaki seafood pancake Just because can't very many places    And last but least yes  should honey toast because Ichiza did first I think? still does best  If you've never seriously must  smaller orders available but can't vouch I'd just big deal    I love Ichiza variety overall feel place  always good experience definitely unique place bring friends family introduce them lot different Japanese foods    PS  shochu which can't find anywhere Vegas liquor stores serve rocks ! <EOR> I am simply rating based Honey Toast since only thing ate when there  Some people said worth all hype   NO!

I give place rare 5 star only because no other competition speak Las Vegas far know    I lived Torrance Tokyo now live West LA near Sawtelle course! think know thing two Izakayas   place even specials wall runs things night proper Japanese place always does   I think lot people caught place since pretty busy   think good idea reservations   made some but arrived hour early   place really tiny if reservations kind show because actually put sign keep standby customers waiting   I am pretty tired Hamada Japanese place Bally's near sportsbook Sushi King still sad see place go    sad see great Stardust shutdown general Japanese fix   nice pretty good alternative   Incidentally found place looking phone book   just avoided all Japanese restaurants tacky names normal Japanese restaurant would never use such Shogun  Samurai  Sumo similar names   One last thing prices pretty reasonable Izakayas go   crazy ordered bunch meat dishes such gyu tataki shiro maguro tataki katsu o tataki seeing theme here? few drinks bunch other things three bill still around $100   stuffed gills   yes very hearty appetite  <EOR> Two words honey toast  *o*  It almost closing time around 1am when came friends some honey toast  When toast arrived table shocked ginormous was!  I figured honey toast would size brick toast Guppy but way better! ice cream top just wowed me   I split three other people portion more enough  savored every single bite  evened ice cream honey throughout toast every single bite heaven   The toast came around $8 little pricey opinion but definitely good   didn't chance order food sure everything else tastes like   The service definitely good  patient friendly even around closing time  <EOR> I love decor feel place!  Feels Tokyo all writing walls   around opening time 2pm Saturday filled fast    Yellowtail tartare Built sandwich crackers instead bread rice filling topped yellowtail mixed avocado   don't why highly recommended because party all agreed bland!  Braised pork belly half cooked egg Some parts pork tender some dry   Egg cooked perfectly   Broiled butterfish its name extremely buttery but because fish itself but also cooked    perfection!  loved small lotus root slice nice accent   Berkshire pork sausage mustard better quality Vienna sausages  look disgusting upon sight see picture but taste delicious mustard   mustard also isn't strong typically is may need more   Okonomiyaki If know home would stick that  can't mess okonomiyaki much even mix restaurant just that   Uni natto squid roll Now truly unique item see any izakaya Japanese restaurant   acquired because everyone likes uni natto   eat buttery uni then u sliminess natto while trying chew squid   think bit ambitious putting all together because can't really enjoy any items   Jalapeno fried rice HOLY moly   thought jalapeno fried rice would mean would throw some diced jalapenos stir frying but if cooked rice potent jalapeno water   spicy   Honey toast really liked simplicity because Taiwanese versions which include multiple ice cream flavors plus chocolate drizzle plus wafers plus whip cream plus whatever sugary substance exists pantry   just buttered bread vanilla ice cream drizzled honey   If would tell them easy honey   Some may think butter also excessive but liked softened bread   Izakaya fun least 4 people order variety items taste them all   Any more 4 would leave maybe 1 2 bites smaller dishes which would problem if all liked particular one  <EOR> I thinking much missed real Izakaya food  then realized haven't reviewed Ichiza  Let tell much loved place when live Sin City   we'd come least once week   sometimes two few months straight  We'd filled frequent diner card quickly getting max  discount within 2 months  Since moved back Cal yet find another Izakaya good inexpensive Ichiza  Yes   inexpensive keyword economy!! So   in nutshell main reason miss Vegas   sad huh? <EOR> Oh poor Ichiza    pains see this   Ichiza used best stops Chinatown authentic Japanese food unique environment  Sadly past success now replaced disappointment   What used quick friendly service now slow indifferent   During last visit 50 minute wait flag down server refills order in  food came waves thus everyone table able start finish same time    As well publicized repeat offender Health District am starting thick twice stepping foot inside here  food quality dropped off noticeably well  chicken egg bowl close room temperature when few noticed reduced portion sizes   What used darling foodies looking Japanese fix Ichiza spiraling downwards sometime hope clean act  <EOR> Great good awesome service   My boyfriend came Sunday around 9 30pm waited five minutes table  ordered ichiza ramen shrimp tempura bowl crab fried rice cod miso butterfish   crab rice cod absolutely delicious  I'd definitely come back recommend place anyone  <EOR> Oishii! love place   hand scribbled menu items around walls bench like seating   felt favorite spots Hawaii   food selection endless everything quite tasty typical fare creative specials   Prices very reasonable service status quo busy place this   Thanks buddy wife introducing place! <EOR> Was definitely four star worthy good  wouldve given two stars but service pretty good  Don't remember much meal besides fact nothing all awesome  Honey toast=not amazeballs everyone be  Woah 3 inch toast! Big whoop      Bottom line ichiza isn't best but apparently appeals las Vegas crowd  all matters right? Don't come expecting amazing izakaya style food  Want visit good izakaya? LA  <EOR> This review 3 5 stars   Very good Japanese through through   Quality every dish but nothing blow water   chicken gizzard stir fry spicy tuna meatball liver   Each unique flavor different selections most sushi spots town   Usually half menu rolls sushi places Vegas but Ichiza only around dozen rolls then few more specials   seemed if specialized more dishes sushi   prices seemed few bucks more expensive other places town but overwhelming   total bill near $35 including 2 sakis     Ichiza located China Town second floor unassuming shopping centers Spring Mountain   line 9 30pm which nice see place crowded which apparently usual outcome   give another try future experiment menu but far plain sushi spot think better alternatives town   would consider Ichiza quality Japanese restaurant local meal  <EOR> Another great visit Ichiza  Brought bunch girlfriends broaden culinary landscapes  Must reservation cause place packed! Just love getting those jealous glares folks wait 30+ minutes table when glide order  Pitchers Kirin awesome well worth $15    The goods Yellow Tail Tar Tar kinda nacho w raw yellowtail salsa avocado chip rice bottom  Deep Fried Bacon Wrapped Pork Loin need say more??

ENJOY! <EOR> This place delicious  love it  many noms  Shout Jenny Z  taking group here!   We 8 people dinner each paid $17 16 dishes share family style  Imperial Palace cabbed which ended $7 person back  place small but intimate cozy  Wait staff all very attentive nice    My favorites for pics see photos added + Takoyaki octopus balls! very interesting yummy + Ichiza DX Ramen Slightly spicy but fantastic way  Great broth yummy veggies   + Hamachi tartar great appetizer avocado lovers lots interesting textures    This great place try little bit everything  delicious  sake also pretty good  <EOR> Been plaza ate two other restaurants surprised took long find Ichiza! food delicious    It little annoying find consistent information when open website on home page contact page yelp different times listed  door says 5pm 2 30am last call 2 30am  guess means don't happy hour anymore?  I other person sat bar  open kitchen see chefs doing whole time    We ordered shared beef tongue skewers chicken yakitori skewers crab meat fried rice yellowtail tartar tuna tartar salmon sashimi beef tataki  Everything came perfect  tartar yummy order both tuna yellowtail  salmon sashimi best thus far buttery fresh  bill came around $70 because ordered two large beers but definitely worth quality  probably going come back every time Vegas now   It's located small plaza limited parking during dinner time  <EOR> The ramen based seaweed soup very much vegetable based  lot msg soup well    The meat Chinese sweet stewed comes block rather thin slices    It expected but maybe should lower expectations ramen place near Las Vegas  <EOR> Even place Dirty Dining still wanted give chance  Food very mediocre other places town much better  Service very professional  told server please order gizzard she served gizzard skewer  wanted garlic chicken gizzard  Honestly haven't while didn't remember also skewer kind  But think server she could asked  If she politely changed order still acceptable however she later gave attitude slammed plate  Never coming back again! <EOR> First time back couple years   Lots changes some new items some old   food okay but compared other izikaya type places town lots items overpriced i e $8 00 bottle Japanese beer!  R u kidding?  won't comment wine prices because didn't wouldn't purchase wine prices saw menu   really upset though place adds processing fee using credit cards heck eaten most expensive restaurants Vegas never charged such fee   pretty sure credit card fees built into business price points processing fee just ripoff far am concerned   going back  <EOR> Came actually seeing some girlfriend's facebook pictures all awesome food several years ago  review written 2 visits   First visit came bf bunch appetizers Takowasa wasabi marinated raw octopus others all fantastic  also sashimi platter which delicious  also ordered ramen which weren't liking since spoiled all ramen shops SoCal but none less very good  Awesome izakaya atmosphere see myself going night good time next time  honey toast ate car drive back LA just good   Came again friends several weeks re hashed bunch appetitzers along beef tataki well miso black cod which smooth buttery miso added depth super satisfying  curry beef bowl heard good things it  again honey toast but time every better since toast still warm crush crunchy good honey ice cream    MMMMM!

Now look back don't really remember ate except fact took pictures  remember uni being decent Wagyu carpaccio well  ordered lot food felt everything just mediocre  Maybe off day but Friday night people waiting regardless fact open tables  menu all over place bit annoying  wall specials then another more specials  those sitting window tough see specials just felt rude walking someone else's table look writing wall    Overall thought honey toast would save night but didn't  green tea ice cream good but toast dry never ordering honey toast again! Ichiza big let down hope if ever come back again won't disappointed  <EOR> Bread pudding fire service ok     Seating bit crowded uncomfortable well    But food ok desserts <EOR> Ichiza locals Japanese restaurant pretty close strip because everything always fresh but also crazy busy because small parking lot sucks!! best thing loaf Japanese bread fill vanilla ice cream honey  Sounds weird but must have! <EOR> Came today looked forward Honey Toast but quite disappointed friend treated over here  First all when place 2 tables filled  third set customers come thought hey maybe awesome service  Long story short couple things happened  Servers kept rushing even though no people line  halfway through Ramen Bowl server already asking if through food spoon  right mouth   servers managed put bill $79 50 even though barely ordered anything a Ramen bowl Gizzard Skewer Beef Bowl Honey Toast which servers kindly adjusted us  But sheer fact if didn't bother looking bill then would've paid 3 times original bill supposed be  Gizzard Skewer kinda fell short  bill over $50 even unheard of    I'm willing give place more try since restaurants bad days but near future honest  <EOR> If want hang night prepared wait   If want eat when open 6pm   Having Japan my son Navy stationed say atmosphere menu ambiance resembles neighborhood Japanese eatery   Let's call place is  Hipster's hangout serves Japanese Tapas   If really super hungry bring your wallet   Sushi just so so but cooked entrees good   Service very scattered however lot more traditional authentic then typical Japanese place Las Vegas certainly better value places located Strip   Parking does suck suggest bothering just parking lot center next door   If don't want wait Korean Gardens BBQ next door  <EOR> I liked place XO special soup great just wish put more pork belly bowl! nice sized chunks pork could eat stuff itself meal however pretty sure I'd die some kind salt overload    least I'd happy though!  dessert bread thing absolutely awesome too  you find pictures through yelp pictures above  actually massive feed more 2 people  ice cream mixed honey bread just everything come together all nice like     would definitely come back however removed star because broth doesn't ton flavor wish more it    however egg pork it    surprisingly waitstaff friendly fast! looking forward third trip ramen house    only BAD thing grade food service police C    subtracted star because even though can't guess why C    sure somewhere  dis concerning <EOR> This place fantastic   all food incredible but love convivial atmosphere great service   drinks crazy cheap pitcher Kirin $15!!! stuffed ourselves   think $9 50 black cod tased just good Twist night before $185 tasting menu   adding Vegas rotation   They're also open till 3AM <EOR> I can't believe reviewed Ichiza before! many many times each time consistory good  think good restaurant intimate cozy meal two big group  think tried everything menu least half stuff posted walls  many good things describe but really if aren't picky eater pretty much everything delish  always seem gravitate towards pintxos though  perfect place town order bunch dishes share table  When usually beer sake didn't really me    I usually try reservation but if later evening should fine  think serve food until 2 3ish  <EOR> Place busy when came but lucky enough seated bar  keep mind reservations next time   We had Tofu salad tuna sashimi tofu salad reminds scrambled egg whites bit salty but least tuna tastes fresh  OK try once    Grilled salmon belly marinated sake lees very flavorful cooked perfectly  order again    Black cod fish marinated miso sauce salty! delicate flavor cod fish ruined    Skewers chicken yakitori chicken meatballs tsukune sweet shishito peppers all very good  never wrong skewers!

Seafood quesadilla Suggestion server  Two crispy tortillias sandwiched around thinly spread sushi rice covered salmon tuna squid white fish sashimi surrounded daikon sprouts topped off Cupie mayo  MMM MMM MMM!  When all else fails flirt waitress ask recommendations  girl but dang those waitresses cute! <EOR> Great place check least once if Las Vegas     Two tips Check photos Yelp if can't decide over 100 items menu alone  Speaking menu seems spilled onto walls    offer more items then listed menu   Don't shy just walk around check them all out  <EOR> if most favorite place ^^  Layout not typical looking sushi styled restaurant Ichiza very authentic Japanese oriented    menu items line every wall decor all wood seating looks cramped two sets seating large parties back    admittingly kind arrangement feel very overwhelming first but atmosphere becomes upbeat exciting once sit down ^^  Service outstanding amount customers service   won't lie say u there's no waiting food it's crowded 8p 1am but time within reason never long   the waitresses friendly cheerful VERY BUSY chefs actually find time special arrangements your order if buy large quantities same item   Food this EXCELLANT place if want something UNIQUE    something leave lasting impression exotic japanese cuisine    everything agree your palette but majority items full flavor taste !  they prepare all kinds dishes every method    sushi breaded meats dim sum items rice dishes noodle dishes tofu dishes raw meats fish beef octopus etc      seared steamed fried   menu ENORMOUS !  Pricing the menu well balanced pricing    MOST items $2 $4 allowing try lot dishes without burning hole wallet like TAPAS     additionally you'll find yourself only spending around $14 main dish   Closing i've lived Vegas 4 years   TON places eat mention TON sushi digs    but find Ichiza 2 3 times month because LOVE JOY discovered eating hope too ^^*  Recommendation excuse spelling 1  Beef Tataki seared raw beef 3x orders of 2  Beef Wagyu Carpaccio  3  Chicken Gizzard bowl 4x orders of 4  Diced Beef Cubes ask spicey 5  Salmon Sashimi fresh CHUNKY 5  HONEY TOAST EVEN if feel can't eat anymore  let know if need any questions answered   think must've earned master's degree eat often ^^ <EOR> I would give place more five stars if could  because friend mine told good was  let down  small sushi bar limited seating but food worth wait if busy  all kinds menu items posted wall  Everything tried far excellent  try desert ice cream inside bread honey  <EOR> And then roach ran across table      and another booth deal spring mt  But coupled horrible service  Maybe sign server forgot half order ? Im going miss honey toast beef bowl sorry Ichiza good run! <EOR> Probably favorite Japanese restaurant Vegas    Environment restaurant very traditional table seating bar seating large table where sit pretty close floor  restaurant very social where people enjoy good food but also some sake beer  Every time some groups drinking pretty hard I can't probably every other time Service don't many waiters chefs but all work really hard bring food quickly well your table new order provide water    Food absolutely love food here  really reminds Japan  variety options similar restaurants Asia menu everywhere menu booklet ones wall  Also don't appalled when see menu food also faded picture hard imagine food ordering  usually order lot tapas nature try lot food  Everything super fresh love sake doesn't soy sauce taste    Overall suggest everyone try restaurant whether visiting Vegas  great spot socialize enjoy different foods  price pretty fair quality well  Definitely worth trying! <EOR> I'm sorry    didn't think place cat's meow     Honey Toast = Innovative but just Japanese toast honey drizzled top scoop ice cream  Tasty but easily created home if Chinese Japanese bakery near you    Yellowtail TarTar = Good but nothing write home about  TarTar served chip probably huge 10 years ago  Still good today   Fish tasted fresh  back try more items  <EOR> Food very authentic delicious but seating very limited   Reservations need made least 2 hours advance  <EOR> Beef Tongue Stew  Wasabi Octopus an order skewers bowl white rice   and youre good go <EOR> It deserves 5 stars becoz its authenticity Japanese food but comfortable its dishes taste when tired all overpriced European classic food strip  wondering place why people would prefer spend $400 couple's dinner if eat $8 each places this? really 25X more delicious?  We ordered only 2 dishes but completely satisfied both them  Pork cutlet bowl probably most tasty flavorful fried pork ever although rice beneath egg layer kind soggy  Beef udon sweet flavor making very interesting taste   Bottom line If car Vegas want sth warm ur stomach crazy night Ichiza definitely worth 4 miles driving  <EOR> Yummy food great price but wished service faster   wait table long also check   Although food delish   recommend grilled whole squid grilled salmon collar sure   the honey toast dessert  **a must try** <EOR> If take chefs Ichiza open new bigger restaurant trained servers hostesses etc    would probably best Asian restaurants all Las Vegas    The issue Asian restaurants general poor service  really put damper your dining experience  Instead hiring experienced waitresses clearly understand you're saying attentive throughout meal many Asian joints hire nieces and or other family members perhaps even random attractive Asian girls    Let's just say Ichiza    phenomenal Japanese food  Authentic overpriced extensive variety offered all over walls menu  Your ramen definitely better Monta's at least  opinion   always crave your curry udon pork onion skewers fresh oysters pretty much everything else offered tiny space restaurant But please please please work service aspect!   On several occasions restaurant group waited 15+ min approached seating  watch hungry thirsty 2 3 waitresses duty walk bus tables stare other tables giggle back just plain stand around  usually flag someone down inform we're ready order once feel rushed rather difficult communicate half time  food takes little longer average Asian restaurant which ok    but once don't expect see your waitress again  Or   see walking around but she won't acknowledge your existence  Good luck refills!

Whenever China Town hard visit  red snapper carpaccio chicken meatballs honey toast    tons things love menu! always look forward coming in  Normally give star less bad service    But food good but know    Service isn't amazing  <EOR> I USED love place   USED enjoy coming even wait table open up   service USED better!!!  However friends noticed BIG decline service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  servers mainly women pretend understand say ask for   think ridiculous seated wait more 15 minutes before someone even comes your table take your drink order much less your food order   which always already know want order since regulars long time now always take guests out of town food   Don't wrong food still great which only reason still come   But food quality busyness establishment EXCUSE BAD SERVICE!!!!!!!  review clearly all over place but am extremely angered disappointed experience friend last night because came specifically food which craving!!!!!  But did BAD SERVICE again!!!  First all seated made several attempts try server's attention and even guy front looked he charge seating people also same guy made eye contact friend trying motion ready order but just seemed ignore next 10 minutes    Finally attention server let know ready order she another server take order then never came back check rest night   wait staff just seems disorganized because different girls kept walking food brought various girls   ordered food all once because knew would take long time second order if wanted   food came some items before others ate pretty much taking time enjoying food during which time no came ask if needed anything refill waters hot tea       but instead three times three different servers did come take bowl pretty much empty but more sauce which still working but without asking if done just trying take off table   mean JUST ASK FIRST if done before taking plates away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then still two more dishes waiting which friend asked two servers please check remainder order   But don't think even did   Because when almost done meal pretty much full still hadn't gotten last two dishes   friend asked another server cancel orders tempura butterfish which girl said ok let check     but countered said just please cancel orders because he waiting almost done eating      but she still check order which again asked them two times prior check while mid way thru meal       then immediately she came back both dishes   response oh convenient when almost done ask cancel order bring right away     she just smiled shrugged   OBVIOUSLY hadn't forgotten order because she brought them quickly which made believe food done simply due sloppy service inattentiveness brought rest order late      much less why friend's shrimp tempura already soggy when she it!  INEXCUSABLE SERVICE which why didn't feel least bit sorry when decided leave tip less 10% bill   I MEAN REALLY        totally guys always busy   But should already used train your employees better far being more organized ready such rush   Also many people staff I'm thinking least six servers last night which if think small place should enough cover tables provide better service attention your customers no should experience such CRAPPY SERVICE!!!!!!    I now come food alone NEVER EXPECT GOOD SERVICE ICHIZA'S       which overall should bad review!  Places really huge following whose food exceptional worthy coming back should ashamed when don't deliver quality service    and even more when SERVICE SUCKS OVERALL!!!!!!! <EOR> This place awesome  share Japanese food Hawaii actually surprised say best  food fresh especially fish! pretty much whatever want  love coming ordering something new pretty much every time  also decent prices food which isn' expensive drink prices pretty reasonable    The only down side place gets pretty packed even weekdays  time came hostess actually skipped over names waiting list ended waiting 2 hours! 2 hours worth some really good food but hey 2 hours waiting outside restaurant   If MUST honey toast  If haven't before you're probably thinking Honey Toast?
