Service excellent shout Kevin made sure everything great!! <EOR> Walking into place much going back time  almost feels wrong using cell phone inside   It farmhouse type feel  but modernized trying to hard to be farmhouse type way  know looked long before cool look that    The omelets incredibly well priced  pretty much all $11 6 egg omelet only 50 cents more egg whites unless wanted 3 egg omelet  then $1 less   I Little Chick a Dee Omelet which white chicken breast onion broccoli cheddar cheese  pretty tasty  strongest flavors but nice light   My fiancee Rio Grande Surfer which included chorizo sausage cheddar cheese  usually big chorizo fan but really good quality    Each omelet comes house made potato chips which oddly appealing anti crunch them  Absolutely addicting but when potato chips addicting? Nonetheless loved unique spin put them   The honest truth can't place price wise  favorite omelets Peppermill across town but those still 4 dollars more place albeit tastier   But if want support cool little piece off the strip history Omelet House won't disappointed  Plus staff really homey friendly  <EOR> Cute place tucked strip mall next Smith's  Standard though extensive breakfast menu 20 different incarnations omelettes avavailable   The lobster eggs benedict curl your toes its amazing  Portions generous  couldn't finish omelette hash browns known harboring lumberjack's appetite track athlete frame   I shared order pumpkin bread right oven  Slathered butter taste heaven  <EOR> We looking good breakfast place near Palace Station yelp ran across hidden gem only mile would definitely come back along bringing some freinds to  prices fair food great flavor all homemade  But waitress Priscilla just best! <EOR> Amazing Omletes Staff Melia extra awesome if your corned beef fan Hash!!

I'd swear purchased supermarket taken wrapper put plate microwaved  My wife ordered sausage eggs   She felt sausage freezer aisle same supermarket  I am far food snob love good dive greasy spoon restaurant every once while but feel Yelp let down one   cheap Vegas buffet would more satisfying today  <EOR> With all great reviews       place definitely stopping list       boy disappointment   First       dÈcor older quaint Midwestern       but dust some things looked while       definitely need good dusting   Second       food luke warm tasteless very disappointing   Order biscuits gravy side extra biscuits       while first biscuit great side biscuits looked tasted texture dinner rolls   though new potatoes home chips       tasted stale crunchy   All thing considered       better breakfast choices       sure if ever back  <EOR> This place looks million years old but service food awesome     Had eggs benedict throw some kind seasoning  paprika parsley over everything   Tasted real yum   potatoes off hook   Banana nut bread really good pumpkin ok   Waffle nice large too   lobster version eggs benedict which supposed bomb but seafood allergy no thanks   Be careful much order don't order 3 4 things even if sound look good   Great bunch hungry guys   far strip   Travelers feel welcome   Big parking lot  <EOR> What hidden gem Vegas!

Giant omelets 5 6 eggs believe  Tons options well other breakfast classics  potatoes are   different more lilke soft potato chip hash brown home fry but good same  Definitely worth try! <EOR> I wanted leave only 2 5 stars however option  Omelet house place visit each timeI visit Las Vegas  omelets large portion chips best chips ever had  pumpkin bread amazing forgo calorie counting when dining here  Sounds 5 star worthy rating right?   Wrong here's why    The restaurant closes 3pm  visited restaurant past Saturday Sunday group 6 both days arriving near closing   Saturday food wss great extra take home however several group noticed rushed tone energy server  always back Sunday ordered exact same omelet  egg white omelet added lobster additional veggies  food came no lobster omelet   Now due many food restrictions intolerances suggested coming know lobster omelet satisfying filling  However when told waitress no lobster she said because she told chefs add she rushed off  dug more through omelet looking lobster still no lobster! told waitress again she pointed egg white said theres lobster  Its shredded   lobster shredded  just omelet day before  pointed friend next said look lobster omelet shredded  She said well told them put there  She then confirm cooks said put there  offered take off $5 upcharge added lobster   Herein lies problem Typically when restaurant gets your order wrong remake fix your meal   Because close 3 informed food could fixed because chefs now left! dug through omelet until scrambled eggs plate no lobster  told waitress specifically came ordered lobster  She took plate back managee then determined yes fact NO lobster omelet! Yes waitress removed omelet bill however left hungry disappointed frustrated service   My suggestion restaurant The waitress takes immediate action if plate cooked incorrectly especially before closing   cooks should leave until waitress verifies all plates prepared ordered   Be mindful your tone you're still clock   The manager should address issue customer directly  better customer service  My suggestion patrons Dont visit just before closing  prepared subpar service   I know if visiting again experience  <EOR> Very long line  No working counter hostess station getting service chaotic best  Food mediocre  worth wait chaos fighting seat  If your looking stress free pleasant breakfast? Avoid place   Please see Owner posted initial review establishment     3 9 2016 * think wrong Omelet House  1 We always 5 hosts owner working door Sundays  2 We counter hostess station  3  All 25+ floor staff trained eye contact anyone waiting seated if unable seat customer say something effect Someone right away  located Charleston Rancho  Read less   So first off?  establishment listed Owners response   no idea where 25+ floor staff hosts matter   Never saw single them helping addressing anyone entry   No ever made eye contact no ever even recognized there   Secondly sign when enter states Pease wait seated    Thirdly owner states he she no hostess station but 5 hosts!
