Awesome! <EOR> What thinking? should known better then place eat breakfast sandwich while waiting flight home   Auntie Anne's known pretzels  should gotten breakfast but when saw sign $4 99 breakfast sandwich thought cheap enough give good ol' college try!  Auntie Anne's sells two types breakfast sandwiches          1  Bacon Egg Breakfast Sandwich 2  Sausage Egg Breakfast Sandwich  After purchasing two breakfast sandwiches two coffees which came $15 95           I realized food coffee just plain lousy!   I give friendly clerk A+ customer service when walked counter order breakfast sandwiches 2 sandwiches under heat lamp  ordering sandwiches       he grabbed both sandwiches under heat lamp but other clerk bought some new sandwiches          he promptly threw away breakfast sandwiches sitting under heat lamp gave two fresh breakfast sandwiches which came freshly whatever reheat items   The breakfast sandwiches         they sucked! give solid 1 grub         the bun hard egg very rubbery  Egg Bacon breakfast sandwich barely tasted any bacon  coffee weak too        but course wasn't expecting Starbucks son!  Had bump star good customer service             but if come just stick pretzels         I'm sure  specialize in  <EOR> Awful customer service! employee rude condescending  She did hear order when corrected she rolled eyes proceeded talk another employee while she fixed order  Something along lines she said now      she wants this! simple mistake could handled completely differently  left without order returning  <EOR> I cinnamon sugar pretzels bites pretzel dogs   time bites bit over cooked sat around long chewy bad way   Taste okay texture calories definitely not  <EOR>
