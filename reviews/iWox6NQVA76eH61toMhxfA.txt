Overall Spicy Pickle nice experience new chain restaurant  during rush lunch hour Tuesday placed to go order took little longer expected but pleasantly surprised quality food  Meh may little pricey but worth it!  Plus Spicy Pickle sign just happy! loves giant pickels?! DO! <EOR> Went probably two weeks grand opening still bit empty but just meant food going quick! did pick 2 deal which $8  tried some spicy turkey sandwich which wasn't spicy even when cashier warned it  also tried seafood crab soup winner especially sandwich dip it  pickle spear delicious wish bigger  Overall good sandwich place eat if options open spaces okay price   My four stars service mainly because workers came once but twice see if everything alright  Maybe  because only family but still  <EOR> I really want love place   four times now two times bad food experiences   first time ordered chicken wrap chicken WORST chicken ever   think cheap Tyson Hormel chicken freezer section wouldn't even feed dog   ended unwrapping wrap getting all fillings except chicken   I decided give another go   Bandido bread wasn't cooked all way through   tried tried keep eating but just couldn't stand mushiness bread   kept examining sure bread because flavors very good but ended tossing more half sandwich The other two times did bad experience staff polite  why gave three stars   sure try again because really would great lunch $8 00+ dollars  <EOR> Poor poor poor!!  I ordered Med sandwich   opted red wine vinegrette instead requested spicy ranch sauce   also ordered side cole slaw   1  opened cole slaw immediatly noticed wasn't mayo based cole slaw   Alright no problem   Mayo based favorite but enjoy vinegar based slaw well   First bite no flavor   2nd bite no flavor   see some kind liquid added but wasn't vinegar   sure but absolutely flavorless   Didn't finish it!  Plain shredded cabbage coleslaw!!  2  sandwich   opened found no spicy ranch sauce no red wine vinegrette   completely dry sandwich   Dissapointing say least   goto fridge bottle creamy parmesan ranch ate entire sandwich   good despite bread being bit dry side   3  first 2 complaints wouldn't enough leave negative feedback   third complaint icing cake   When bit into sandwich bit down into something bit hard   enough crack teeth but enough let know something isn't right   spit chunk lettuce core   cheap and or lazy spend 10 seconds core your lettuce before shredding it?!  Really!! <EOR> I've only visited place once far good  plan going back trying other sandwiches <EOR> As other reviewers stated place pricey doesn't necessarily match quality pay although palatable cost aside   Portions decent wait time long   I ordered South Side which roast beef cheddar focaccia   bread shipped possibly day old fresh certainly baked site   Roast beef standard deli cut probably deli site well cheddar   The place moderately crowded lunch but wait terribly long long manager decided stop ask long waiting   New help kitchen?  Perhaps   Bring prices more line place trying sell return   isn't gourmet deli  <EOR> Lets see    Where begin?? staff extremely unfriendly ! ordered Gobbler cheese broccoli soup  Gobbler bread stale hard no tomatoe mayo no feta cheese only 1 artichoke scarcely spread sandwich  driest grossest sandwich ever! soup super bland gross!! WORST meal $10! waste!! Never ever here! hope place shuts down again stays business!! Gross!! <EOR> Better Subway if you're looking quick bite lunch  Also keep place nice clean  Try Bandido Pannini favorite  <EOR> I wanted love Spicy Pickle but your pickle liked best  Bandito panini Peppered turkey pepperjack roasted red peppers sundried tomatoes chipotle mayo  took sandwich time eat pretty soggy  blend flavors didn't save it  give second chance dine maybe try specialty sandwich instead  <EOR> The food service great HOWEVER meal provided its way over priced  You're already paying over 8$ sandwich but build your own combo its exact same price but charge avocado charge bacon extra but main part sandwich general  offer pasta salad potato salad orange slices spicy pickle side  But orange slices mean 3 don't offer any sort dill pickle kids  <EOR> Wonderful spot lunch wide selection sandwiches soups  Food made fresh order  Generous outdoor seating area those nice days  Nice able free combo when check Yelp  <EOR> I always told good when down working area took lunch break  good but still thought little $ quality food was??

Such disappointment when paid $10 sandwich taken only unwrap realize ALL expected  mention tastes bad totally unhealthy!
