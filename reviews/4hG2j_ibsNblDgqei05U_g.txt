Then told reopening somewhere else  Good! Well last visit Vegas told Mr  K I'd visit new location together couple friends visited Social House now located inside TRULY IMPRESSIVE Crystals City Center which wasn't even last visit Sin City      Walking noted carried over same modern hip theme   bar lounge area just nice very similar feel   took seats bar ordered some appetizers drinks off happy hour menu   friend sliders which didn't try but ordered tempura like shrimp which quite tasty    The general manager kind enough give whole tour restaurant ALMOST nice old location   OK lying really nice but really nice old location where two floors simply knocked socks off   Similar old location did include patio dining area but really patio when you're just overlooking rest fantastic Crystals City Center indoors     Because fancy dinner planned evening couldn't sit down actually meal Social House which always SH's selling point old location   But GM did invite back try amazing coffee promised we'd back dinner dessert   Despite having dessert amazing dinner promised delivered running back Social House coffee   believe coffee $14 gasp? but Mr K took seat lounge waited patiently through brewing process which rather fascinating    long time ago come Social House dough balls which still remain mind best desserts ever   thrilled find still menu course beg more dessert !  did note now called Lychee Dough Balls should first hint   The coffee spectacular promised   dinner SH must try coffee  Their dough balls???  THAT? I could touch no more but dough balls filled lychee gel concoction some sort would ooze first bite   While am big fan anything oozes  just bad bad combination   Bring back old dough balls!  Why mess perfection???  used perfectly coffee!  In end don't feel equal old Social House several reasons dock star   But Social House STILL hippest joints Las Vegas excellent Japanese fusion MUST try place! <EOR> I'm really sure if place   They're set where couple small rooms each room couple tables it   might little crowded if decent sized party 10ish    The things stood menu some Filipino dishes you're used seeing any restaurant serves sushi   According waiter head chef Filipino guy   waiter did very good job selling stuff but Filipino certainly knew better pay $18 six pieces lumpia $20 some pancit   sure chef cooks them well but those two dishes should never cost much unless enough feed army   Most ordered less memorable really stood steaks   filet came rare ribeye came medium rare   Both amazing!  I'd back order just those   A couple hundred dollars spent 6 ok   little overpriced sold but hey  Vegas  <EOR> Let preface 4 star review saying FIlipino American adobo sushi =_=  but also foodie minus 2  stars notsoknowledgeable servers night poorly paced courses   food refreshing fusion twist normal Japanese impressive   I highly recommend sitting oustide patio because overlooks pirate show TI boasts birds eye perspective spectacle   Plus star that  <EOR> +1 great looking place +1 food very good interesting rolls  +1 great parties +1 more once trying place Las Vegas only place ate!!! +1 waiter attentive filling water asking meal etc <EOR> Great ambiance tasty sushi!

 Shared salmon tartar cod lettuce cups some sushi rolls   Only complaint would sushi rice bit dry hard  <EOR> I believe good ramen cure most any non communicable disease related ailments great ramen entirely change your day  bowl Social House lies somewhere between but considering found strange land where such simple pleasures hard find found worthy extremely high praise  cannot say tried any other dishes unfortunately day visited weren't offering lunch special  available during week which includes 2 other courses addition ramen however bowl enough lock Social House regular stop when visiting Vegas   My service also exemplary which isn't easy task considering sat bar only item eat but Jonah managed best keep dozing off winding noodles face 1 afternoon  Yeah long night watching sun come although thankfully wasn't stuck Vegas Motor Speedway friends attended night's EDC event which shut down due wind trapping everyone ecstasy induced frenzy few hours  heard though Steve Aoki protest set pretty memorable well worth headaches  Jonah seemed know all blondes looked just left Peepshow audition name typical menu orders strolled clearly guy doing something right   But back ramen  $17 bowl pork belly tonkatsu broth think slightly cheaper if want seafood miso versions   pricey but isn't? definitely recommend pork belly though even if you're vegetarian because Vegas whatnot if cheat your husband cheat your diet and might help take your mind off all meat your face Thunder Down Under which just know your best friend Orphelium photos eagerly awaiting next time forget return organic sewing kit accidentally break them front Thadly   pork bowl quite plentiful http www yelp com biz_photos 4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g?select=nHoa4e7h9Fe8ocEHkMI44w# PhxZpR8PqXM_IFuzOupXg minute two soaking steaming broth extremely delicate easy dice your chop sticks  broth itself good bit depth well but highly recommend dumping entire side portion pepper spices crispy garlic added flavor  time bottom bowl really nice subtle burn going mouth exactly thing needed day started right direction   The setting pretty sexy it's located inside super luxurious Crystals mall bold brooding teahouse sort way while those ideas may seem rather juxtaposed promise works  would love return Social House full course dinner meal if ramen any indication but time being content knowing found likely only places quite possibly best offer favorite post drinking night cravings  <EOR> I Social House when still Treasure Island!!! 21st birthday large group  Although made reservation specified balcony still wait good 15 minutes before table made available us    boo that  friends actually very stern chat GM since acting if weren't going give us  Because group hot girls mostly my bf time us seated right next window balcony watch Pirate show  loved did since watching show awesome! boat right watch show ate  Hot seamen 12 o'clock! first time Vegas being legal age drink definitely those experiences left lasting impression fun memory   Social House itself very overpriced if could determine form menu yourself  Six dollars tiny cup miso soup?! No  Just no    I think alcohol poisoned point time trip because really couldn't eat anything  stomach hurting all throughout sharp intense stinging pain could barely move entire weekend  guess  drinking excessive amounts alcohol 5 nights straight before heading Vegas    whoops  Because only ordered miso soup 2 orders sushi    being salmon  good but great  Certainly worth amount charged   If wasn't paying might enjoyed more haha  friends all enjoyed meals  remember people loved black miso cod entree hope still option new location City Center   So yes birthday  looked good as see photo besides small stint bathroom where friend refunded soup middle dinner great time there  Ok maybe TMI    but deal it  You've read worse   I miss location     if only TI pirate show beautiful gold box wall entrance great take pictures front of! look forward day trying Social House its new home but special occasion  don't dropping money Vegas no reason  <EOR> Friend feeling having some soup night out  Saw place Crystals shopping center thought miso soup! However looking menu something 10x better Tonkotsu ramen!! didn't high hopes since just came back Japan recently but surprised broth really good  fact writing review reminds back tomorrow  Although broth very tasty downside egg japanese style seemed someone through practically raw egg which don't necessarily mind but wanted authentic soy sauce egg   Noodles great both friend left very happy  <EOR> The worse sushi ever lives  Pretentious syrupy service  Extremely over priced tiny portions  When complained sushi horrible manager took away food brought something else choosing  don't even spicy tuna full it  He said because some magazine said great if didn't then must because couldn't them  presumptuous! still nasty he didn't even adjust bill  paid over $100 left hungry because never eat  NEVER again  <EOR> Umm dissappointed  think motto eat drink socialize something  came cirque show freakin empty  looking menu see why  place overpriced overrated just plain over  tempura platter cost 3 times much any regular good japanese place but tasted 1 2 good if that  Why pay 24 bucks when 8 somewhere else? Everyone knows love food fried failed deliver all levels taste value variety    This place just all looks no substance  Inside its all swanky posh  also incredibly hot hostess would seat outside balcony  am going give two stars server nice house music playing  'sake flight' sake sampler decent  usually only take sake bomb form sapporo beer  <EOR> This review only pertains bar lounge area happy hour   Happy hour 5 7pm everyday     We some time spare before going see show stopped here   Staff welcoming really friendly but would describe them attentive   No wine happy hour menu   Thumbs down   ordered two food items off HH menu can't remember exactly its called can't find HH menu anywhere online    them fish sliders   TINY   But good   other thing ordered shredded meat over fries cheese other stuff   disgusting   Super greasy salty   wish sent back refund    One star friendly staff clean hip setting bar area   Another star having NBA playoffs TV  <EOR> Still favorite sushi cocktail spots vegas   Bonus because usually suite Aria Vdara making place short walk away   Try red champagne   addictive   Way stay consistent SH!  See January CES  <EOR> I prix fixe dinner before Mystere show   Everything fantastic!  am spoiled all top notch sushi joints bay area   place could easily rival best sushi anywhere   From start finish everything top quality   Especially cod   wouldn't ordered cod if wasn't choice prix fixe menu but glad tried it   mouth still watering think tender tasty was   Try sparkling sake won't disappointed if bubbles   If aren't fan sparkling variety extensive list choose something your liking   So why 5 stars Keeks?  Well TI which means put lame ass Siren's cheesy hoochie fest pirates while eat   If table away Pirates Caribbean meets raunchy Showgirls then it   Unless into sort thing  <EOR> My husband grand plans foodie crawl through Aria which basically involves hitting 3 4 high end restaurants trying 1 2 items bar plus cocktails   First planned stop American Fish happy hour but    closed!  Second planned stop Sage and    closed!  Bar Masa also closed! Dammit!  We started lose faith nonchalantly suggested Social House Crystals because never there   If menu didn't appeal least could Sapporo bar re think strategy     I expecting something akin Kona Grill    typical sushi but nothing write home about   wrong   walked sat bar   friendly bartender gave menus discovered actually pretty decent cocktails!  I Socialite $14 which spiced rum passion fruit juice orange juice serrano chili   didn't really taste chili but all good because yummy!  My husband Cachaca Espuma $16 which cachaca fermented sugar cane lime green tea vanilla coconut foam referred espuma    bartender grated little lime peel top   big fan coconut smell pretty strong but husband made dent foam could try drink below without gagging pretty good!  For food tried yellowtail crispy jalapeno garlic dust tiny cilantro just microchives used everything few years back calamansi soy $22    think calamansi type citrus fruit but didn't ask   excellent!  crispy jalapeno adds good texture different just having fresh pickled jalapeno tossed top   garlic dust!  Everything should covered garlic dust!  Awesome idea!  We also tried crispy pata which crackling pork shank pickled carrots garlic served chili vinegar side $24    vinegar very strong warned only dip pork little bit   pork shank both crispy skin tender meat   Also bones some tasty bone marrow inside chopstick fish out!

Being completely blinded glitz glam Vegas didn't' realize full blow restaurant   The walk staircase main dining areas feel you're bank golden safety deposit boxes surround you   Asian decor when hit rooms very subtle some rooms very traditional others   atmosphere really fitting name place   Things really lively if outdoor patio seating overlooks strip   The food absolutely awesome here   If you're picky sushi whatever  fresh here   ahi hamachi fabulous salmon excellent   Flown all way Japan overnight lucky batch sashimi   however hidden gem mini Kobe Beef sliders   OMG heaven King Hawaiian roll   flavor texture taste       ecstasy tongue tell OK    that could've put differently but let's move on      If need buzz want some exotic tastes liquid form offer many different types sakes won't find your regular sushi bar down street   There's over fifteen unique ones if more time I'd tried them all   Pricey but very much worth it  <EOR> Happy Hourrrr! favorite combination words   They serve happy hour everyday bar until 8 sorry  can't remember time starts   doesn't love place offers happy hour daily?! Anddd great food options? Can't that    So ordered Tonkotsu Ramen $8 Angry Tuna Roll  Both packed flavor super tasty  don't even fish but intrigued description angry tuna roll decided try out  did disappoint all  broth ramen perfect amount seasoning noodles cooked just right    The ambiance also really cute would perfect date night    If you're concerned overpriced regular menu then should least give happy hour shot! <EOR> Social House Asian fusion when Asian parents hear word fusion little grimace face  They're old school  don't fusion  But found Ishiyaki menu dad excited  Ishiyaki style cooking where cook meats fish veggies etc  hot stones    However when stone came wasn't stone ceramic looking grill plate  dad asks suspiciously stone? pretty boy waiter smiles says yes but way yes don't really know anything please don't ask any more questions  doesn't look stone dad keeps asking  mom wrangle dad start eating we're also other people don't want stink tell ok stone    as all look grill plate  later found internet most ishiyaki nowadays done natural stone but man made stone composed minerals keep stone hot lengthy amount time  Some stones actually look real stones but others look grill plate saw  would nice if waiter could explained instead just smiling looking he lying for all he knew he was    Food We ordered couple meat veggies seafood veggies plates cook ishiyaki well miso soup rice  Everyone thought miso soup pretty good  rice according mom rice connoisseur not  three dips came Ishiyaki dishes thought only miso based ok  kobe beef came good other grilling foods  Since did own cooking can't say rest other menu items are   We ordered mochi ice cream dessert  order came 3 unique flavors  forget but lychii best one   Service Service slow slightly snotty only partially attentive  asked extra chopsticks grill items arrived use them cooking it's sanitary thing but waitstaff forgot and nowhere found until almost done dinner everyone just flipped chopsticks back forth cooking vs  eating  Another thing brought dessert Treasure Island show starting  encouraged closer watch but desserts left table melting whole time  would nice if took back freezer while watching show but didn't   Verdict While think people might come back pretty sure parents fusion haters would come back especially since wasn't authentic ishiyaki imagining  doubt I'd come back either  little hipsterish place didn't vibe service enough return  There's many restaurants Las Vegas would more interested trying different instead  <EOR> Eh bruddah da kine sushi served sucked  wasn't fresh  probably first time complained freshness sushi restaurant because places Japanese sushi chef would never serve anything fresh well raw    cooked becomes employee meal ! but da nihonjin Hawaiian sushi chef sat front just let slide  probably worst places to   Also don't expect any chef specials because clientele patrons frequent place haole's first timers rolls california roll type diners don't anything ordinary even typical items real Japanese restaurant  Instead its bare basics   The interior really nice but probably only thing going itself because service sucked too  week Halloween place bascially empty yet couldn't even mange three people sushi bar      luckily bartender took charge made sure seated  <EOR> Meh  Very good service  Server made sure knew exactly ordering nigiri means comes top little bit rice etc  atmosphere lovely  Generous cuts fish nice fish rice ratio but quality subpar  awful just nothing write home about  really sucked rice  Really? rice sucked  left over last night?

The food ok     should ordered some sashimi but didnt opted some boneless braised tamarind ribs did tamarind taste    actually  no flavor whatsoever    My boyfriend sashimi yellowtail jalapeno he loved it    he also another dish but cant remember right now  All remember leaving really feeling it   didnt think restaurant food all that    If want some asian sushi you're better off going restaurant Encore usually full asians if  any indication authentic food is   Overall would say place sucks definitely coming back  <EOR> Took clients few nights ago   server Daniel great!!!  place busy music kinda loud he let sit back patio over looking mall   great place eat some business done   all tried seven course tasting menu   quite good yet pricey   cocktails prices high Demon Slayer $31 00 beer selection world   Tried several selections ended costing much dinner gasp    Also Japanese beer Gingakogen which came beautiful blue bottle could drank several those but $18 bottle settled one   Enjoyed Kobe Sliders $24 00 fantastic   Loved fresh sashimi featured tasting menu   This place definitely splurge but hey     life worth it!  service attention every detail really nice experience  restaurant dark modern artistic    Definitely check happy hour   The bill four people eating drinking themselves silly over $650 00  <EOR> I think good 3 4 times mostly poker comps mostly already good buzz going entering place take grain salt  When you've munchies hitting bottle even bag cheetos gonna seem 3 course meal    Try seat outside balcony overlooking strip  way enjoy food pirate show  crowds gather ridiculous but if you're restaurant you're gonna great view   The food itself obviously overpriced seems little rich which probably why tastes great  don't remember seeing anything extraordinary menu but everything ever tried rolls kobe sliders chocolate balls bag dessert all least pretty good  Some great   The service kind spotty  sat down before then asked change tables forgotten waiters occasionally etc   With all mind its still fun place sexy atmosphere  would come back time time again  <EOR> D E L I C I O U S! headed 1st night town nice dinner  exactly got!

Yar!!! <EOR> We just left here  little disappointed two things  bartender Phil very negative energy Asian restaurant  He seemed unpleasant if he didn't wanna something he showed through service  Secondly chicken teriyaki over cooked  felt place over all fun hip cool place but something's need more attention  <EOR> Expensive but very good!

Everything very fresh chef does great job creating interesting dishes lots flavors but still taste sushi  Sometimes feel modern sushi rolls particular over top ingredients sauces don't even taste sushi but case here!  My husband Cocktails 1  Tea T loved tequila based cocktail came cute teapot 2  Some kind cocktail bacon infused whiskey hus which he sent back  smokey tasting   Food 1  Edamame Always good  serve 2 ways sweet salty which nice  2  Vegetable tempura Perfectly cooked airy crispy delicious! 3  Yellowtail Jalapeno Sashimi awesome! Very light flavorful jalapenos hot all   4  Lobster Tempura Roll husband's roll pick  great though favorite  5  Seared Albacore favorite husband agreed    My complaint while restaurant beautiful DARK point being comical  mean guess created ambiance but geez    <EOR> Food rather pretentious  If Japanese Filipino fusion your thing place go   Dined cousin 1yr old nephew Sunday Christmas  Having child tow didn't stop venturing into fine dining evening   Our meal started shrimp pork lumpia served sweet chili sauce flavors reminiscent Filipino style home made lumpia rolls heavier price tag  There's no set guidelines good lumpia making rather subjective household household  short good lumpia   The second dish Hokkaido Sea Scallops came salty!

Decor Bordello Bird Nest Service Hope Daniel enjoyed tip much he enjoyed being server much  <EOR> My girls + boy  Social House Bachelorette Weekend   All say really service every which way possible dining establishment can  Decor check  Charming cute waiter check  Melt your mouth kobe check  only thing possibly made little sad when saw bill   my goodness did those 18 pieces thin orgasmic meats really cost nearly 100 bucks?!?  most expensive orgasm ever had!   With all naughtiness aside Ambiance Dark brown hues manila lights  Made feel dining ritzy cave brightly lit crystal city center mall  romantic everything would stereotype Vegas upscale joint   But somehow wished little brighter could actually see food  When dining appeal plays great tricks belly  case social house couldn't see freshness yellowtail carpaccio its brilliant colors until home check pics  Did yellow tail appeal match its freshness? Absolutely! But if maybe threw couple candles could see food would instant gratification instead going home 3 days later find out    Service waiter just your typical waiter  He did whatever he could serve anyway he could  Provided very charismatic dialogue never made feel bunch commoners eating could pretentious place  manager also stopped apologize when slightly over cooked dining companions raw steak really friendly  other words try strive per perfection    Food teased enough without much further ado food  started toast bachelorette red champagne made tint hisbicus  yummy sweet kiss  those likes taste liquor because wasn't even hint taste  Deceptive because bride little happy afterwards   drank fast because delicious    Appetizers yellowtail carpaccio tempura jalepeno 5oz thinly sliced Kobe toro tartare  Entree Kobe hanger steak  yellow carpaccio absolutely great  fish melted spice jalepeno subtle could barely taste it  provided perfect crunch  tuna tartare lacked little flavor first taste but then little rice balls injected flavor flair its texture    The kobe beef prepared ways fantastic  garlic seared kobe far superior over spicy ponzu  Both melted but garlic seared unique flavor it  Kobe hanger yuzu egg very tasty but didn't melt appetizer  None less very tender   Also yellow tail roll chimchurri good but nothing extraordinary comparison rest meal     For dessert complimentary truffle lollipops  yum     Conclusion Social House am impressed  But why must  wallet bleed hard  Fortunately live way far away become new addictions  Because if closer it'd abusive relationship your kobe beef would doing ass smacking  <EOR> Just came back Vegas past weekend  often love explore new food restaurants  must say favorite restaurants ever!

friend took past Thursday together tried few items menu including yellowtail crispy jalapeño citrus peel miso cod kobe gyoza more sashimi item but cannot remember moment  comfort zone also ordered guava ginger tea well Normally only drink green tea     With exception kobe gyoza everything quite delicious especially yellowtail item which say probably best yellowtail quite sometime  If come must try yellowtail plate   I am crazy tea herbal fruity flavors  However if tea connoisseur may appreciate tea selection lot more me   Social House unique classy decor  very dark plush seatings reasonable level music pleasant atmosphere  especially love decorative walls light fixtures  <EOR> Scenester sushi bars generally all glitz less fish   would expect even moreso Las Vegas   would incorrect   Reservations patio overlooking pirate show easy Thursday night crowd mixed bag older rich guys wives younger hipsters wearing True Religion   everywhere else Vegas however isn't much look spend     Seating prompt servers quick      too quick IMO suggest most expensive menu items when buddy asked recs   Admittedly though he knowledgable menu knew guide non sushi loving friend some safe choices   Throughout course meal selected sampled Tempura shrimp cold udon sweet sauce Unagi Avocado Rolls Kobe Tartare Roll Jalapeno Hamachi Tartare Cracklin Scallops grilled eggplant Chocolate Lava Cake Mochi   Each dish delicious friend raved Kobe roll much actually ate beef first time 7 years happens Vegas guess  Particular standouts flawless Scallops Cherry Blossom Mochi   After pirate show AWESOME angle directly behind w o crowd made way bar area although particularly 'scene' great time   waitress friendly not mention gorgeous drinks pricey but tasty especially espresso Martini crowd fun   All told scenester sushi club place nice fish much fresher most places like   If you're looking place good view strip some dinner time entertainment happening scene afterwards decent prices expected Vegas Markup food quality I'd say Social House might fit bill  <EOR> The food good but don't think its worth price  Suchi good loved lobster roll but again its filling costs much  jalapeno yellowtail lived its hype but wouldn't pay price again  <EOR> A bit torn review      approx 3 5 4 stars Social House surprisingly hipster place Crystals Mall high quality stylish food good saki   But service bit odd   late dinner cycle when accepted dinner reservation   Yet seemed wanted rush out   timing seemed off many items took far long arrive while other items arrived super quickly   Food = 4 5 stars Service =

AWESOME!! <EOR> Social House part TI's continuing makeover  offers modern take Japanese food well obligatory sushi bar  However Social House little more that  Operated same people run Pure Caesars Palace designed half restaurant half lounge  night dining tables convert into cocktail tables   Social House's chef left Nobu work here  overall feel menu reflects Nobu roots but some new twists  Choices include Kobe taro chips peanut sauce coconut lemon grass soup citrus peel miso cod soy mirin kurobuta pork belly tamarind short ribs  sushi bar serves usual suspects   The feel place varies according where sit when go  There's sushi bar couple other bars indoor seating outdoor seating  Late night place turns into hybrid restaurant lounge high tech tables adjust become smaller more lounge like   During early evening hours Social House feels mostly restaurant  ate lounge  dark wood floors dark wood tables  lighting level low provided mostly small lights hanging dozens wooden bird cages suspended ceiling  Moderately loud Latin American music heavy playing  lounge partly faces Strip TI's pirate show  interesting twist!  Sesame Kelp Salad pretty good version standard dish  green seaweed tender yet crunchy sesame seeds enough sesame oil give flavor  very large portion would good candidate sharing   I followed Orange Peel Miso Cod plus bowl steamed rice  long ago would deemed exotic nowadays pretty common  However  say wasn't good  Indeed fish soft yet flaky cooked just right  sweet but not sweet glaze nicely flavored   Social House prides itself its sake selection  sake expert but fun try different types  good place experiment  sake served very attractive bamboo carafe matching bamboo cup nice touch     I'm having some trouble providing evaluation because just simple meal wasn't around late enough evening see place night spot  spot light early dinner I'd say pretty good reasonable prices  <EOR> Great food yellowtail crispy pata perfect!! definitely come every time am Vegas  <EOR> The food fun!

Also striped sea bass which probably climax entire meal  Sous Chef Jake may know Bouchon??? prepared perfectly   At point full but finished  Jake brought ultimate roll other roll memory fails recall  ultimate roll goddiest roll ever  Covered raw kobe beef outside all kinds other pricey goods inside roll rediculous  wish ordered earlier when appetite still present   done? Nope! Sous Chef Jake brought custard type dessert very excellent bread pudding absolutely finish!  Even though current moment lightgroup no accessible menu view it hesitate check place out  top 5 meals Vegas w o doubt maybe top 3  <EOR> Don't waste your money!!  Completely over priced bad quality well   expected better restaurant city center   Shiybu MGM way better! <EOR> Review Social Hour Social House's Happy Hour bar lounge area    I recently event   While waiting decided try ramen friend used work said really good   Plus read few reviews positive feedback dining experience here   Service bar Efficient particularly friendly but knowledgeable menu offerings   Food came fast!  Food Tonkotsu Ramen Chasu Poached Egg   Broth okay particularly rich creamy but also salty which more traditional Japanese ramen broth style   Noodle cooked but still clumps where did separate during cooking process sadly disappointing    liked fried garlic pieces which added flavor   would add Sriracha which offered automatically if wanted spicy  Pretty much same experience Candace C 2 years ago    Chasu inconsistent   piece light color decent fat tender   other piece clearly darker if sat unwrapped exterior also partly burnt not just nice seared but charred carbon    Overall Debbie N's ramen experience hoped for  trust both Yelpers' opinions which night day differences consistency appears issue   Price ramen more expensive other local ramen option which now lot   mega resort pricing effect   I would come back try other items menu especially 50% off dinner food purchases Social House Tomodachi Friends Social House Card   But now just sub par 2 stars experience  <EOR> I come thing   Happy hour ramen   Happy hour ends 6 but never really busy here   broth creamy fantastic   pork money winning meat add it   noodles great   think favorite soup!  other dishes good but come specifically ramen   service always good domestic beers $3 50   could wrong? <EOR> Nicely decorated friendly staff  must try seared Albacore roll!!
