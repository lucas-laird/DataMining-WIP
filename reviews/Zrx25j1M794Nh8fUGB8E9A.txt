I love TGIF ever since but never wrote review   food good dessert miss happy hour drinks cherry top   inside Orleans great place dine before going movies bowling or gamble gamblers   <EOR> I frequenting TGI Fridays restaurants years but able eat around  six months   Last weekend opportunity eat surprised some more recent TGI Fridays policy changes   If order cheeseburger want change Swiss American cheese or vice versa dollar upcharge   found any changes not just add ons dollar upcharge   Want extra sauce?  dollar upcharge   understand raising menu prices due inflation food costs but unnecessary upcharges seem bit much   lot similar restaurants genre   If TGI Fridays keeps other business's getting those customers   awhile before family willing walk back into TGIF restaurant  <EOR> Wish could give LESS star WORST dining experience EVER had  Food service BEYOND terrible  salmon lobster steak lobster   No amount steak sauce ketchup could improve taste rubbery food  miserable entrees took OVER 35 minutes arrive BOTH cold!  waitress Autum no explanation delay did return table refill almost $4 00 drinks! She further dragged feet bill  Took almost ten minuets bring bill another charge us   manager offered free desserts compensation but did want waste any more time taste any other awful dishes establishment which never return to  <EOR> Service great atmosphere cool  My gf fans TGI Friday multiple ones Vegas  just hate say but food nearly good other ones  disappointed because places look consistency but wasn't prepared well when others  service everything great which why gave 4 star but definitely just other ones  <EOR> My husband Vegas just last week April 16 20 stayed Orleans which where particular Friday's located   If could would give 0 star rating   very long time if ever before return     We decided eat Friday's Friday evening April 19 which last day Vegas  having drink two Alligator Bar decided wanted something eat   walked over Friday's only 11 45 p m   only 2 people waiting line hostess nowhere sight   saw people cleaning tables mopping floors finally gal looked over asked if we'd seated   should first indication dining experience only going down there     We seated Sara server came over take drink order   few minutes she came back take dinner order   husband ordered chicken dish also Caesar's salad   Sara placed food order  last time she paid attention us   She totally forgot husband's Caesar's salad   Evidently she felt more important stand hallway take pictures some balloons front   Besides Sara 4 5 other Friday's employees doing same thing   more important look pictures cell phones instead paying attention customers!    Considering restaurant hardly busy waited 30 minutes before food came out   When did just absolutely horrible   husband's chicken dish salty he could barely eat it cheese covered chicken totally burnt many places   ordered Korean tacos I think  called impressed all   Very little meat many greens carelessly tossed inside corn tortillas didn't look taste anything way described menu  Right before food came Sara came over table tell husband she just realized she forgot salad!  course she did because cell phone far more important her!  Thankfully charged salad     In meantime two more diners came into restaurant   totally ignored employees   Finally gentleman literally chase down server asked them if Friday's still open!  Finally 5 7 minutes couple seated     By time husband upset decided needed speak manager   Sara came over ask food husband said wasn't good experience he wanted talk manger   Sara did manager expressed displeasure   manager nice enough charge husband dinner she did give some gift certificates complimentary appetizers desserts   However entire experience left very negative feelings Friday's     I don't know does training particular Friday's but something sorely missing   Since when does hostess station remain empty Friday night?  Customers should chase down employees order seated   servers should standing hallway looking pictures cell phones!  service    complained manager all sudden servers doing jobs   shouldn't come that!  Sara worst servers ever had   If she's poor server relatively slow night cringe think she when busy!  Needless say Sara given tip   tip poor service forgetfulness     We've eaten Friday's past always good food service   happened Friday night just inexcusable   If Sara company don't want work Friday night picked wrong industry   recommend Friday's all unless enjoy being ignored forgotten served sub par food   don't  why won't returning Friday's when stay Orleans future   I'd rather bag junk food Orleans' gift shop before back Friday's! <EOR> If could would give place zero stars friend mine actually used work location  Crazy much changed anyways seated pretty quickly but took server 10 min just great he's very little menu knowledge   he greeted grab beers which flat hell didn't see another 10 mins take order order taken sat 30 mins waiting aSalad pasta dish  manager duty come over discussed happened she couldn't care less just left but know see why service shit starts your management if don't care servers don't care  saw  Worst service ever gotten EVER!! never give place business again your shit together take care customers even if don't care act your customer feel more comfortable   If manager would expressed actual concern would little different   <EOR> This great place chill out  girlfriend came 11pm Sunday still happy hour until midnight  ordered Jack Daniels Sauce Chicken Wings Shrimp Margaritas  full little tipsy when left  server great very friendly attentive <EOR> This place always great food!
