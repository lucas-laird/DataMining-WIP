Keema chicken normally menu many Indian restaurants   because Keema means ground minced chicken more home cooking really type food restaurants serves  I don't know why shouldn't! As eat alots Indian food know exactly wanted eat didn't even check menu   ordered Keema chicken Plain Naan Rice Papadums Raita    Their Keema chicken good   lots ginger expected   Exactly mind   wish put green pees but big deal   Papadum spicy crispy   ordered extra snack tomorrow night!!

Food selection very slim too   There's gotta better options Vegas    <EOR> i would love give zero stars if could Yelp? maybe feature implement?? anyway bottom line WISH i'd stopped read reviews before plunking down $26 2 lunches could never back!! food disgusting bland tasteless hopeless worse mediocre could on  there total 5 dishes rest lunch buffet filled lettuce onions chutneys yogurt dips no real veggies actually dip in  samosas leaking oil pakoras nasty didn't taste pakora batter but stuffed some dal some sort save money curries GROSS ugh!!! when u enter u see all awards plastered walls?? handing out??? don't here   its full retards serving nasty food that'll u barf whether u're hung over not  <EOR> This review based first time eating Indian place!  Went place suggestion friend jon loves place   Went Friday night pretty empty  5 parties ranging 1 6 people pet table   The staff seemed pretty bored which added boring ambience  There's nothing scream Indian restaurant     Our wait staff pretty good always when needed   They gave little much time over view menu   I'll start off appetizers   There's complimentary plate baked type chip?  served 2 different sauces  sweet red thin chutney  other spicier green salsa verde  Overall reminded chips salsa    We ordered meat Samosas start  They're pretty much ground beef empanadas Indian seasonings  Overall good but definitely stand I'd back for  Very mild   I ordered tasting dinner   This came basmati rice naan goat curry chicken curry shrimp curry  also served cool cucumbery white sauce sweet dessert cup   The portions good enough share   Although all really good   food definitely tasted just came serving pots  only seemed meat stewed curry goat  chicken shrimp servings came off if chicken shrimp added into sauce before being brought out    Also three different curries seemed varying heat  goat most mild then chicken then shrimp being spiciest    I'd definitely recommend getting meat dinner if you've never Indian food    You little taste everything   The menu definitely hard understand  There's goat veggie seafood chicken section each 6 8 different options your choice entree in   The descriptions really don't give any idea expect order  I e  Chicken spicy curry sauce VS  Chicken very spicy curry sauce   I hated seating place  should definitely new interior designer  tables close no booths! felt unintentionally eaves dropping everyone's conversations   For food I'd definitely give food 4 5 five  only complaint would food wasnt served completely piping hot  dish warm while others weren't ect  But taste definitely awesome! All curries different ordered three different dishes eating naan rice changed tastes too   Service 4 5  satisfactory no complaints but nothing spectacular   Price 3 5  huge fan Thai curry but just doesn't seem worth price  meal mango lassi which underwhelming Samosas $7 $45  2 cups curry rice naan $21 24 dollars    I would definitely back! But only when want splurge  I'd rather Thai curry ] <EOR> Well just dinner hour ago tried because friend's recommendation   say just okay little more would've spent if gone India Palace  The veggie samosa very good spicier most chicken tikka masala good aloo matter spelled mutter alright but mixed tandoori quite disappointment  little pieces chicken lamb prawn which forgot actually put plate brought later! mention when split lamb still raw inside   meh     Should've kept original plan gone back Indian Palace   oh well $88 bucks gone live learn    <EOR> The chicken tikka masala very good  dinner special comes basmati rice naan  also kachumber salad  dinner excellent  <EOR> Pathetic food unclean chairs environment  Useless place  No variety buffet top all non sense <EOR> Used huge Indian snob when lived LA Vegan   Indian some only food Vegans actually eat rest assured certain dishes won't contain butter eggs cream   If Vegan  restaurant you   did however lots vegetarian options   Nothing extraordinary  but buffet   think typically must drop little expectation convenience super fast simple lunch options   naan bread awesome!!  found server quite attentive   He filled water probably 4 times hour   would back lunch  <EOR> Sticky floors watered down curries much selection fort lunch buffet  First last time here    Things avoid 1  Sambar mostly water eggplants 2  Idli rock hard 3  Butter egg curry enough said 4  Goat curry only sauce no meat  Avoid place <EOR> Best Food long time! Lots love food  Everything fresh well prepaired  The staff most considerate friendly  would reagular stop if town  <EOR> Awful food  Cold  came group friends wight pissed off  Expensive  Less quantity  would recommend  <EOR> I've come group friends every year past 7 years weve never disappointed  really surprised see average three stars  If your dishes spicy side let them know overall food tends milder other indian restaurants area  usually leave having eaten way much but its good just keep eating! <EOR> After being disappointed Capriotti's Sahara closed walked around came across restaurant  When first saw store front listed dinner buffet 5pm 10pm woo hoo! But when walked turns didn't buffet dinner at least night came minus star false advertising!    It's okay though because ended ordering Vegetarian Thali which almost mini buffet itself Palak Paneer Channa Masala Rice Pakora Naan    Kheer! all very good! especially liked Channa Masala   The interior restaurant clean well lit  Service attentive always full glass water  <EOR> Brief summary place great service authentic appetizing food great decor amazing value!
