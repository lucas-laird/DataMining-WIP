The gentleman behind counter helpful offered suggestions  knew wanted Angry Dog $5 95 no question there  other leaning toward Bahn Mi Dog but swayed try Carne Asada Dog $6 95 Euro fries $5 95 since came highly recommended   After drinks tax ourselves $25 meal  Pricey two dogs fries but if they're good they'll worth it   Sadly just ok  hot dog itself weakest link  salty lacked any all beef flavor love Chicago dogs   toppings however good couldn't save dog  bun bit stale big  good meat bun ratio didn't deliver  didn't prefer dog over other  Any difference flavor cloaked saltiness   The fries odd mix  consumed them but no idea ate  When recommended expected gyro fries Euro fries  recognized topped cheese but beyond no clue concoction was   If want goodness Dogzilla guess means haul ass OC track them down  <EOR> Man where start place?
