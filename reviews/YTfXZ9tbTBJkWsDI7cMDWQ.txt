Hot tea complimentary too    Will come back again try other dishes  <EOR> Decided come seeing reviews Yelp  Even though only few posted each seemed solid decided give try   My first impression good! Lots Asian restaurants quite dingy dark dirty  However Liang's modern well decorated clean! loved planes hung ceiling  server told owner's husband used fly planes Taiwan  cute! loved added personal touches but cute way rather random   What ordered Bok Choy mushrooms bamboo shoots holy shit this! three ingredients complimented each other very well  sauce cooked delicious  Bok Choy tender another plus  really enjoyed veggies    Fish hot chili sauce asked them if could mild AF said no problem! Came pretty quickly huge portion  Could need little more salt but still good devoured every bit it  dipped few pieces vinegar enjoyed it    Shrimp two ways Pretty good! Half cooked sweet sour esque tomato sauce while second half more simple sauté  Again huge portion but dish also pricier side  Prob wouldn't again but good!  XLB best XLB but still hit spot!!

But see whole box contains lot oil  If want charge 11 dollars bento box then should sure worth it   Compared little kitchen pork chop rice give 4 side dishes which flavorless  Although  pork chop bit over cooked day when tried only 8 dollars   I'll choose little kitchen guess  <EOR> Pretty avg  food Good service  XLB good Beef roll better noodle man but bad Spicy won ton sauce different bad way Pork chow mein not bad <EOR> I'm sure describe place but typical Chinese restaurant  First all attached real estate office which kinda odd  When walk 50 model war planes hanging ceiling escorting your table  menu American style Chinese food but more authentic type China past trips  food excellent portions right size oversized but skimpy  Mongolian beef very tender plenty flavor  also chow main noodle dish but them wide noodles    only place Las Vegas where they hand noodles tell  such wonderful consistency fresh taste  only negative found service absolutely horrible  slow almost non existent  Besides having wait long time place order counter napkins silverware son  took even longer check box  place would great if service would improve here  <EOR> This great off strip Chinese food restaurant  wanted juicy pork dumplings found them!
