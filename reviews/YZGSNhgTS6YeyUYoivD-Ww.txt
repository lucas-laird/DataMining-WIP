This place isn't prettiest newest place drink beer town but value can't beat   Main St Station seems getting shaft compared California across street super full people restaurants   love Hawaiian food but love beer more!!  If walking area Fremont Main again then sure stop blonde ale! <EOR> Everyone else giving place much higher reviews think just ordered wrong   ordered four cheese pizza absolutely disgusting   reminded elementary school pizza   not good   did look other tables ordering food did look good   also fried mushrooms just okay   The beer sampler good why am giving place 2 stars instead 1   reasonably priced around 5 bucks so   The service just okay   place packed think server doing best she could do   I would try place again if downtown but wouldn't way there  <EOR> We decided stop lunch recently   Portobello Burger which giant portobello place hamburger   quite nice actually if mushrooms highly recommend it!

Delish   We loved beer sampler 6 samples $5 50!!  cheap!    enjoyed mango beer although bf thought sweet    also really liked porter   Bf liked red pale ale   perfect balance meal   The atmosphere any brewery restaurant  think Gordon Biersch   But pleasant inside lots TVs service pretty good   We'd definitely back would just order something different   probably sticking more traditional bar food just getting prime rib own  <EOR> People raving place since started going Vegas   Let's just say      what's hype for?

Travis ordered sausage mushroom pizza two side salads   pizza good drinks refilled plates cleared   room full business TVs baseball game playing   Overall experience good! <EOR> Over last 4 years place seems better better  When first realized place inside Main Street casino just seemed sports bar decent food crappy craft beer wouldn't spend $1 75 pint on  years gone noticed big improvement beer even better food  Normally when think food downtown Vegas garbage fried Twinkies cheap buffets some tough $2 99 steak eggs   My last couple visits gotten really good burgers under $10 good steaks under $20 surprisingly great sushi would never expected place  known beer wings burgers  all high end mediocre expensive restaurants Vegas nice know there's still place where some good food without breaking bank  <EOR> Believe easy find local beers Vegas  Most casinos contracts big distributers generally all carry same beers biggest breweries  if want local seek them out    Triple 7 restaurant brewery located Main Street Station downtown Vegas  variety standard bar type food burgers sandwiches fried stuff but also sushi bar which cool   But best part opinion brew own beer  According menu few hundred gallons time  When dropped 7 beers ranging pilsner stout there's something everyone  did taster styles accurate all very tasty  Great beers all    Lastly place downtown aren't going gouge prices  highly recommend place  <EOR> Ha!  hubs reviewed place few years ago basically said same thing time he did then   detergent there???  Beer doesn't taste good when tastes soap   Anyhoo steak salad which expecting   ordered steak medium came well over that   starving didn't send back ended being pretty tender regardless   odd part salad part meal probably less greens side salad   top also put hot sauteed veggies side plate   pile hot zucchini onions wilting tiny salad   thought order wrong but when receipt did say Steak Salad    did taste pretty good overall though     The beer OK   Red wanted try Mango Hef but wasn't able order casino floor   Drat  <EOR> Second stop Microbrew Mini Crawl    place essentially huge restaurant Main Street Casino   Easy parking across street your 3 bucks back   We shared burger average   also couple Irish Stouts   Triple 7's Irish stout thinner less sweet Guinness stout   Las Vegas seemed fairly good deal   1 2 pound cheeseburger fries 2 draft stout beers just under 16 bucks  <EOR> We particularly horrible experience restaurant family  huge delay getting seated could see servers clearly overwhelmed which understand but really problem refused hire extra staff   Upon getting seated least another 15 just order in  When finally food vegetables clearly frozen  still almost cold meat cooked correctly just all around dismal experience  else where  <EOR> Been coming CA couple years now  There's bartender name Brad    TIP BIG! He amazing! upbeat knowledgable helpful! <EOR> Vegas Downtown Fremont Street inside Main Street Casino  tried crab dip garlic edamame oysters shooter vodka Tequila  Pretty good price service fabulous  <EOR> Since Steven trying keep things simple trip decided just brewery  other reasons why just chose brewery trip  Some probably guess why chosen if reading reviews past month  though only half story tell full spectrum story later time  We chose Triple 7 simply because good overall score Yelp! also brews haven't heard before  Watermelon Hefeweizen! Well time didn't Watermelon Hefe anymore but did Mango Hefe which immediately ordered! unusual Hefe down smooth tasted awesome  But only beer allowed bird! The food Triple 7 could take leave it  funny  Many people often say good casino food cheap is  trip least much  food mid priced would say often times sub par regular restaurant outside Strip   I ordered Taco Salad tasted fresh enough but also seemed uninspired didn't really TLC needed good dish  guacamole also tasted bit odd   If Triple 7 didn't such good beer would generous star giving  food didn't impress least favorite meals  But beer  Ho no! <EOR> We during lunch mom's birthday  decided since coupon gift certificate Main St casino  didn't any beer review just food service    Nothing really special except dessert    deep fried cheesecake    It good but good enough plan exciting adventure dessert check some other reviews few adventures Service ok   Food bleh ok  So so    The waitress seemed waiting ALL other tables side restaurant  wasn't packed but wasn't empty  two waitresses working during Saturday lunch time  see why wasn't packed  didn't any rude service but didn't any great service  She didn't check enough qualified great excellent service  Other taking order giving check she checked maybe    twice  She seemed she just there  Just work  Sorry won't score good tip    We ordered calamari fries few dishes some sushi cheesecake  All okay so so    Nothing great calamari fries fries came few dipping sauces  seasoning fries seem separate fries  doesn't fries tasty  calamari so so well   No table really liked dish got  all just okay  Nothing bad  Just so so quality  fried sushi roll nothing tasty it  fried rolls before at breweries bar type places delicious  disappointed one  other non Japanese non Asian breweries bar type places good sushi    Other dishes ordered philly cheesesteak okay  brother barely ate half it  other brother ordered fish vegetables he said bland  He only took few bites didn't eat rest  usually eat lot!   We ordered caterpillar roll but waitress gave california roll charged caterpillar roll  it's few dollars more california roll  She apologized changed bill but again    she just seemed she didn't care serve or maybe job  knows      The fried cheesecake good first time trying glad more okay  But just good great  Maybe  also because disappointing service all other food while there    No really enjoyed food probably won't again    If ever again gonna try mango brew   didn't offer any beer menus suppose know? <EOR> Great place right off Fremont street  Great parking even better food !! <EOR> Love coming happy hour 777 mainstreet casino  Perfect spot sports some beer  always friendly staffs great service  <EOR> We always come least once every trip  family loves jumbo shrimp  always order prime rib  Did know use your Ohana book selected item! <EOR> They excellent IPA  definately place check age Casino kept beautifully  <EOR> We mission find delicious shrimp cocktail  Saw reviews made trek off main street into 777    Alas cocktail four Jumbo Shrimp small plate 2 tablespoons cocktail sauce  $11!

Some party ordered cups chili  cup size very large   I ordered fish tacos  Big mistake!  fish nondescript limp flour tortilla few pieces shredded wilted lettuce  wonder told chef wasabi should fish tacos? fish although battered fried adequately unseasoned  thought maybe didn't season because fish taco tried someone's fish fish chips order  fish also unseasoned tasteless    Also staff seemed having problems taking orders timely manner  8 party bit difficult flagging down waitresses getting drinks  weren't even very busy day  Prices reasonable  <EOR> I pub crawl  great! drinks well priced food all looked smelled delicious    However until eat can't really rank place any higher three  Especially since mad hanging around bar  sorry wanted order drinks bar then drink them bar   God forbid  <EOR> Las Vegas Brewery Stop #4  Triple 7 Brewery located Main Street Station Casino Downtown Vegas  nice chance visit area again  Much more going then remember years past  sampled their Royal Red Lager Marker Pale Ale High Roller Gold Blackchip Porter Brewers Special   I believe Pumpkin Spice Ale  The names cute first brewery really vegas gambling names which surprised us  beers good   seemed tried lots different styles including Belgian quadruple which didn't try  brewpub nice change because dedicated area beer food didn't video poker every table  Great place watch sports large group  defiantly try again  <EOR> As mother staying Main Street Station decided visit dropped off bags Hawaii try Triple Seven Microbrewery  already order planned ready before arrived   Guacamole Burger Sweet Potato Fries 3 5 stars ordered cooked medium  first couldn't find guacamole but under cheese packed tight  wasn't gooey squishy first anticipated  burger itself quite juicy hint salt which stood out  also lot olives between meat cheese well  Between tomato lettuce some surprisingly fresh red onions  it definitely hits fast  usually fan caramelized onions burgers  sweet potato fries average yet crispy delicious fries should be   Crab Artichoke Dip 3 5 stars crab flavor hits immediately tell soaked crab  amount oil bit off putting since made feel sluggish tired  Little balls thought potatoes mother confirmed indeed artichoke hearts  served tortilla chips flat bread  would bread slather dip  Otherwise your chips crack under hefty weight!
