Clean barely smelled food until people next order  Vegetable Chou Mein he Szechwan Beef Brisket  good portions might even need take home box  would wish hot tea option vs just cold drinks hot soup cold drinks don't really well digestion  perhaps non spicy egg spring roll enjoy since everyone eats spicy? seems lot to go business since there's lot seating  ate well under $20 w just water drink  <EOR> The Mongolian Beef Chow mien bomb!  ordered beef noodle soup spicy     think would better eaten restaurant   price very reasonable noodle pulling delight watch! <EOR> The food 4 stars   Why 3 rating?    1 ordered appetizer main main came 4 minutes ordered appetizer arrived when 1 2 way through main  feeling should ordered app just waited   But thought would give service try timing    2 If going run open kitchen seat people along counter area glass watch ready all eyes you   show   star    2a If you're going open kitchen glass glass should clean   not   talking little flour hand made tossed noodles being glass   I'm talking glass hazy needed attention  3 containers tables hold Chili Oil Soy Sauce Black Vinegar dirty   spoons looked they've changed long time dried crusty residue around top lids nasty   May take bit effort but when customer finished dining  spoons should changed lids should wiped down   Perhaps keeping condiments serve would better remedy instead leaving them every table    4 employee came into open kitchen  He wasn't wearing gloves   He reached into pocket pulled wallet inside brought sum cash   He began count fan it    He put back wallet walked behind rear curtain you could still see legs 4a Another employee came behind curtain when he did could see employee 4 peeling fresh leafy vegetables bare hands    He never washed hands handling dirty money   5 When informed server situation he said he wasn't manager but would tell them   He back minute two came back said thank you' 6 employee needed wash hands still standing doing work    then said server HE NEEDS WASH HANDS NOW   He back person washed hands     They still new place   food indeed delicious   Am bit worried eating full meal watching sanitary habits employees?
