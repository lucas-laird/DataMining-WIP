The burger star menu available single double patties purchased cook home owner open ingredients even meatatarians should find flavors palatable    Other menu items little less successful beef bahn mi sandwich didn't anything tossed couple bites fish tacos best described mediocre   yet try popcorn chicken because always sold out   Counter service fairly friendly  could use speaker announce order numbers rather scream them  Also multiple issues confusion over restaurant being closed open some customers being turned away then others being welcomed great feeling when looks picking choosing serve but appears just confusion  <EOR> Awesome!!

Cilantro Salad Burger Tumeric salad Shakes fried Zucchini all fries Excellent!!  even stopped more time before left home Cali!! back!! <EOR> This place's burgers fantastic! fries other items could use bit more consistent quality department  service bit erratic alternate location it under different ownership    This definitely welcome niche market those looking support cruelty free fast food hits spot  <EOR> Soooo delicious awesome!! burger best popcorn chicken yummy!

The next minute SNL skit everyone complains millennials    Rather just say something normal oh sorry didn't hear asked combos let charge difference aka when totally understandable mistake happens   not big deal cashier starts rudely and totally unnecessarily arguing whether ordered combos   Seriously  having conversation  Well trying barely hear over music     Even says Oh didn't even tell kind fries want big evidence sure knew wrong  Because course customer totally responsible knowing options one    After little more equally unnecessary back forth he finally says uh guess fix it  Thanks dude  should Plan A   I've before everything fine but experience kinda killed me  Definitely lapse management walked into restaurant looking being run that  <EOR> Already fan Veg house now fast becoming fans Vegeway!

When arrived first thing caught eye wide selection food  Ranging burgers chicken sandwiches fries popcorn chicken zucchini fries Bahn Mi fish tacos shakes salads  When came two burgers regular fries curly fries zucchini fries popcorn chicken bahn mi road yes try everything!   consensus is Burgers 10 10 I'd definitely recommend getting burgers here  allow single patty even double  also new burger guacamole which didn't but based off burger alone tasted sure guacamole wouldn't bad adder  meat really good flavor sauce add closest tasting you're eating Big Mac    Popcorn chicken 10 10 would say solid choice get  pieces pretty thick nice layer breading deep fried perfection  sauce comes chicken really good it Cajun sauce     Bahn Mi 9 10 lot potential great but think bit dry opinion  put sauce tastes really good just enough    Lastly course fries good like all fries are zucchini fries decent  would just recommend getting fries unless you're mood zucchini    So overall would recommend anyone looking nice cheat meal come here  Again don't come looking anything healthy lol just word caution ready fork decent amount cash prices little steep considering fast food  <EOR> I'm new no meat dairy lifestyle  VegeWay definitely must! First trip ordered vegan beef sandwich which bahn mi sandwich  good!! Next trip Hamburger grilled onions  Burger delicious!

over ordered could try food but bet high calories didn't feel should finish all  Hard any kind idea many calories fats food  Nevertheless good cheat meal if you're craving fast food  <EOR> Best vegan fast food ever had  staff always friendly always good music playing  portions good sizes very filling  recommend white chocolate peanut butter shake good  <EOR> yummyyyy good! glad fast food vegans burgers good but popcorn chicken strawberry milkshakes holy crap YUMMY!!! love place hope open more all over! <EOR> I hankering healthier meatless day hopped yelp found gem  kinda knew expect high reviews photos  ordered double vegan burger opted fried zucchini water instead regular combo  sandwich delicious! patties little softer other vegan burgers but super tasty  fried zucchini light tempura batter just good  came dill creamy sauce reminded tzatziki maybe actually called that  also version Big Mac sauce  Man those sauces just threw meal over top  Prices good couldn't even finish  stuffed took leftovers work finished them little later cuz couldn't stay away  Highly recommend back  <EOR> Ehhh am feeling it  pretty excited try place because many raving reviews seeing social media but letdown  First all enjoy Vegan eats lack meat what's missing here  just nothing spectacular even remotely special place its food   I selected Double V Burger Meal Curly Fries Drink $9 89   Certainly cheap meal  burger ugly far cry photos I thought only happened major fast food brands?   patties misrepresented real product extremely thin plus fresh vegetables almost non existent seriously leaf lettuce didn't even over size bun buns big   bottom line didn't taste great  wasn't bad but certain nearly same amount calories sodium its non Vegan counterpart totally worth it  add already insulting meal side fries dismal probably same ones find grocery store's freezer section    If you're looking Vegan place based solely fact consume animal products then though many better Vegan restaurants town   However if you're looking eat healthier place you  Vegan does equal healthy! <EOR> Only able try pop corn chicken today but SUPER good! should serve bbq Frank's dipping sauce tho   I surprisingly impressed ranch actually very picky when comes ranch dressing   I can't wait back   Wish kinds places all over  <EOR> Ummm  Love veggie house but place greasy  suppose  point?

A small table become available ordered sat down filing cup Dr Pepper waited order # called   took 10 minutes  very reasonable based busy place was   I added ketchup mustard refilled drink Raspberry Iced Tea sat down enjoy meal   I've vegetarian almost 30 years having all sorts vegetarian vegan burgers over decades    Some people prefer type similar consistency flavor beef some prefer those made more mix vegetable products don't really flavor beef     tend fall into former category burger absolutely phenomenal!  only downside pretty messy eat  vegan cheese product made two vegan meat patties slip slide   The fries good but nothing all special learned hard way Raspberry iced tea machine needs calibrated better liquid product barely tea raspberry flavors compared identical machine other places    After wolfing down food feeding frenzy    wanted another burger    Turns guys table next thinking same thing    because wasn't enough food initial orders because burgers tasted good!  I ended getting two more double burgers brought them home     very tempting eat right now 3 30AM but fighting temptation    Even two Double burgers refrigerator somewhat planning return trip VegeWay       better worse opposite side LV area just haven't need often   But food price VegeWay nice unlike most other restaurants place destination expect frequent customer   If you're vegetarian vegan tries avoid food texture flavor meat poultry don't need try VegeWay   Otherwise though should definitely try it   Even if you're vegan vegetarian should give food try if you're curious      On future visit give some other products try   Obviously vegan restaurant clientele rather limited   However enough LV area keep place fairly busy even newness  wears off        Think kind Burger place vegans vegetarians  comparatively inexpensive flavorful food friendly intelligent staff   drive thru lines kind long strip mall parking lot isn't really set long drive they lines    Also interior seating area kind small especially prime time lunch dinner hours place may crowded however based experience last night wait isn't bad very much worth it   They wifi customers but secured guess ask password it wasn't posted    The only negative thing think vegan milkshakes looked kind small $5 price but maybe  just being cheapskate   There plenty nice expensive vegan vegetarian restaurants Vegas but only place know sure show off vegan vegetarian friends come town VegeWay I'd love carnivore friends give try too  <EOR> When your friend asks try vegetarian out   give shot  pleasantly surprised cute little fast food restaurant  sell more just burgers  Menu also includes vegan fish tacos vegetarian popcorn chicken    I tried single party burger  Guac free!!
