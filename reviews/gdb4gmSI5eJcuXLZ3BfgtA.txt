Must try  glad don't drive all way china town great Chinese food <EOR> I literally only thing House Special General Tsao's chicken  hope restaurant review based upon sole item won't frowned upon but defense dish good!  much more different other general tsao's tried  crust fry chicken lighter airier crunch most  think attributed higher cornstarch vs  flour ratio batter  pieces also cut into larger chunks which feel eating less processed good quality white meat chicken   don't know all put general tsao's sauce but could literally eat anything slathered sauce  seems lot honey brown sugar much more caramelly other sauces tried  never attempted homemade version sauce but know never compare why bother trying    The egg drop soup point especially fried noodles serve soup  Eggroll perfectly crisp filling good  lunch specials find strange always portion sweet sour chicken included  Frankly would all general tsao's style but hey complaining  Maybe signature dish something Idk   want try boba day but most likely powder mix no fresh fruit  <EOR> Not good   we always circulars thought would give try  Everything bland   egg fun Yung horrible curry   they say Thai but only 2 items  Don't waste your money <EOR> This near best Chinese fast food town  Good service LARGE portions great prices tasty! Very clean joint well  If looking lunch quick dinner IT! <EOR> They clean but most chinese fast food places only rent food here  live 3miles away date barely made home  wish two barhrooms apartment  price plenty food staff amazingly nice attentive  <EOR> As first time customer admit name drew in  don't live area can't compare restaurant others area but combination fried rice very good  checked yelp reviews ordered pretty mixed   The only suggestion meat wasn't seasoned grilled other BBQ pork   rice cooked well plenty egg which think dish   Hot tasty food served quick reasonable price just needed area  <EOR> I'll cut chase   food okay   If area want quick bite hit place up   If hankering some good Chinese food I'd suggest drive down Spring Mountain better yet California the state hotel    Having just come back LA where some mind blowingly good Chinese let down here   would put restaurant same taste category Panda Express   tasty but really Chinese food  <EOR> This place great hours operation very convenient   specials offer trying new items day   always good food top notch   matters but seem another reviewer Asian     I only gave four stars because best Chinese food ever but way better other offerings area including China China Xpress just down road     As special positive note may laugh use bathroom other day when picking order and     clean   No trash ground no urinal mystery stains   No faint odor cigarettes    always plus books when restroom facilities clean more faith ones kitchen  <EOR> Had them last night  Great morning left overs  staff polite courteous  love beef Mongolian  feel bread chicken much mushy  BUT great place fast good clean! <EOR>
