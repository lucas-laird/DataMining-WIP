Very disappointed portion food  ordered 2 item nilaga bowl use second item size salsa cup  tiniest bowl ever seen   Needless say meat potato tiny bowl  kare kare made pata instead oxtail which hard rock  sisig okay  top all server rude! Completely lost appetite  <EOR> Seriously good Filipino food  Better some restaurants charge twice much  They've recipes down service super fast  <EOR> If could give 0 stars would  While ringing customers cashier phone entire time rude  No acknowledgement customers whatsoever  <EOR> If there's place should avoid ordering Filipino food especially during holiday place   Very unorganized!! Being somebody town thought save trouble cooking just order food  time pick food told don't ticket order  Luckily mine!!  The stress place gave before New Years unbelievable   So if don't want through same situation would avoid place call hours before sure your order ready  <EOR> I excited because close home but disappointed bad service  called suplado because voiced opinion talking shit tagalog  Wanted give no stars but prices cheaper then most pinoy stores <EOR> Good stuff! Swabeng busog! Masarap! Kaya kumain na kayo dito! highly recommend place! <EOR> Very little parking isles way narrow any real shopping today lumpia tasted yesterdays fried fish  really need clean deep frier  <EOR> Closer home lots choices Filipino turo turo even lechon but expensive comparison other Filipino turo turo worse skimp portions give  bought XL Kare Kare take today when home turned mostly sauce no meat just bones! Servers help heavy faces  <EOR> Sometimes food super fresh enjoy when is  Other times sitting days  because price right always Lechon Kawaii bit shopping  am however disappointed catch workers eating buffet line which major food violation! Although just worker grabbing piece meat tongs eating saliva while eating most unsanitary  also experienced bussers cleaning tables spraying cleaner tables right next where eating making meal myself nauseous! think if management showed more discipline staff would everyday  food would better wouldn't worry getting sick lazy unsanitary people  But hit miss am thinking maybe should visit anymore  <EOR> Lots variety if you're looking quick simple place Filipino food  variety aside product availability should also mention grocery store connected all eat buffet which reasonable prices  location ALSO quick service food station to go orders hence Express   <EOR> Worst market ever encountered  employees super rude  costumer service at? If your unhappy your place job leave don't show attitude beginning end ridiculous owner needs re evaluate employees maybe store would worth keeping but I'd rather place shut down! won't ever step foot store again! People recommend store biggest mistake id rather take long drive seafood city take business else where! <EOR> If you're craving Filipino food side town recommend place  bit small but doesn't really bother me  Always variety dishes choose from  really kare kare pork sinigang mongo if eggplant omelet  \m <EOR> Whenever hankerings some quick cheap Filipino food come here  typically order 2 item combo kare kare lechon kawali 1 additional side something looks good day perhaps some goat kaldereta pork binagoongan even fried bangus   food pretty decent price keeps coming back kare kare all time   Other turo turo spots only serve certain days which bummer since always seem want when they're cooking it   end back satisfy craving     With extensive selection food surprising busy here   You'll find something satisfy  <EOR> I other location Maryland pkwy expecting buffet style   First inside Filipino store small area seating 7 4 seat tables line window side food counter runs same length   small area but surprised amount choices had   ordered salmon sinigang pinakbet both really good   Price 1 item = $4 99 +tax 2 item = $5 99 +tax <EOR> Be warned!!!! waste your money put unworthy calories your body restaurant   Quality food= sucks Price= ok Food selection= sucks Customer service= sucks  Dnt waste your money here  worth it  <EOR> Very scary sister ate ordered fish coconut milk vegetable week ago night sister both skin problem irritation fish both ate place  also ordered pinakbet can't even eat because super salty inedible    my sister called CA begged eat place again next time  <EOR> No Star this!
