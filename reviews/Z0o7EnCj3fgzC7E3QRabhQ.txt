Oh yeah food pretty spot on  Everything during meal amazing  Stop thy place out! <EOR> First little background  eat every single night bar none know almost every restaurant Las Vegas  Chairman players Station Casinos eat restaurants very frequently   We tried LT shortly opened  food good not great despite fact only 3 occupied tables no manager ever visited table  several issues kitchen but new let go   Tonight tried LT again  Nothing changed  continue issues kitchen among other things  water glasses sitting empty being told water coming eventually bar ask water ourselves  embarrassing   We ordered large Caprese salad which quite good it better good price   also ordered white pizza which OK  ordered Chicken Parm dinner which OK all  doesn't even come pasta! extra $3 pasta  asked half marinara half Alfredo sauce extra charge too    When salad came asked some time eat before pizza parm came out  told would take 15 20 minutes perfect!   But chicken came alone without pasta without pizza less 5 minutes  asked if could keep warm until finished salad but literally 2 minutes back time being delivered clueless manager named Sabrina  tried tell just sent back kept warm but she confused defensive frankly totally uncaring  back again only come back couple minutes later time pasta underneath chicken  no Alfredo sauce found until 5 minutes later when came separately small bowl   We told pasta would served square dish but came underneath chicken  cost extra   Our server Marcus excellent personality must frustrated lack support manager well numerous deficiencies kitchen  could manager back up? wouldn't frustrated absolute failure management? Poor guy   I tried talk Sabrina but she could possibly cared less say  tried explain myself let know very engaged local restaurant scene but she having none just defending herself stating long she restaurant business  Instead welcoming feedback she annoyed dared even talk her   After knowing all issues occurred she never came back table  once  She never apologized  She never offered even cup coffee  Nothing  She walked past several times nose air both literally figuratively    And never saw approach even single table check anyone dining room  Maybe she just couldn't handle truth   After finished eating sat while Sabrina lots opportunities come back check things right  She did none it  She knowingly intentionally let leave unhappy   Frankly she embarrassment Tony's good name total misfit restaurant  Tony did where he today allowing such unprofessional managers represent him  hope he gets wise cuts before new restaurant much potential crashes burns   We try again maybe third time maybe last time  absolutely certain report back experience  <EOR> The caprese salad yummy basalmic dressing outstanding! mozzerella pepedew peppers took notch  also ranch pizza hawaiian don't think called that pepperoni sausage pizza  Loved them all! favorite ranch! some extra dressing dip crusts in   waiter also bartender wonderful  Friendly attentive knowledgable  Did expect much inside Palace Station but place hit park! <EOR> The first time dined pizza very good though them charging substitute toppings very odd server Kash good checking refilling drinks  came back few months later noticed menu different asked it  can't remember servers name time but she very sweet let know restaurant still says Little Tony's even though now owned Station Casinos  She said  why menu changed even though still attempting Cal Italia Dillinger I assume Tony's permission several other items Salami Cheese Board several pastas Caprese House Special made house made hand pulled mozzarella honestly many other items mention no longer available menu  still says Tony Gemignani website restaurant really no idea what's going lol  menu certainly different last visit food absolutely different even size    Mozzarella Sticks $7 came 7  sticks side sauce very good  bad no longer menu anymore when back!
