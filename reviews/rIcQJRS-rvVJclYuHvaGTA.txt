Yah  then gotta order your sandwich angry little teenager watch them sure gets made want it  Which problem because watch them love that  Especially since just easily ask Hey few more pickles? mayo mustard combo fact slice meat right before putting your sandwich  Usually #5 turkey ham smoked cheddar but yesterday #3 turkey salami cheddar   Typically don't salami type meats but turned pretty good! reason ended getting sandwich because said want number 3 er meant 5 but apparently lady did hear correction  Oh well mistake kind made day because try new sandwich liked it! However still kind bad she wasn't listening enough hear correct myself   Oh well all all POS  If often sure stamp card eventually free sandwich! <EOR> I purchased two subs roast beef pastrami first time buying anything never back  bread isn't all fresh neither meat  smelled just starting spoil  service bad  She needed more pickles while making sandwich she put hand container grabbed handful while dripping pickle juice every where then she used same plastic glove wet pickle juice fix sandwich  When said don't bread wet she dumb founded if she no idea she doing something wrong  PLACE WANT VISIT  <EOR> Its hard sub     never Port Subs  believe location business  bread wasn't cooked    lady sliced meat wiping blade nasty towel    Corporate needs look location  <EOR> I love Port Subs reliably good sandwich! wheat bread option cold cuts freshly sliced order  prices decent    This particular location isn't favorite  employees actually REALLY friendly  But lunch crowd impossible quickly  restaurant also really small cramped  Weekday lunch rush also occasionally means dirty tables  know only because employees can't making sandwiches cleaning same time    I love sandwiches won't let lunch crowd keep away  But think order online might process just little quicker you still wait line people ordering sandwiches your online order   <EOR> The hours suck  Every time pull parking lot they're closed  Only open 4 hours Sunday's ?!
