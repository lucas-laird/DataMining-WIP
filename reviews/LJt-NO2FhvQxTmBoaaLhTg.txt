Read reviews but decided try anyways   Walked waited close 5 minutes anyone say word though busy  Finally seated waitress clearly hates job   ask beer list she says right front then ask beer prices which listed menu   She says don't know couldn't tell LOL joke! walked never return <EOR> We've gotten takeout couple times figured why 3 wives angry   Because pretty much everyone works angry bad mood     sheeeesh! food alone bad though   3 star worthy   We tried *Grilled Hot Chopped Greek Salad $11 99 love Greek salad enjoyed dish   topped grilled Gyro meat warm pita bread   *Buffalo Chicken Sliders $9 99 Comes 5 sliders   nothing impressive   prepare messy   paid extra $1 99 onion rings but gave fries   *BBQ Chicken Grilled Pita Pizza $11 pizza 6 big but comes soup salad   guess healthier choices haha   HOT TIP if want avoid super smoky bar air use back entrance    it's smoke free <EOR> First time ordered Shepard's Pie   Now know isn't authentic Irish Pub wasn't expecting but come guys least effort!  Shepard's Pie consisted bland mixture ordinary ground beef no seasoning could detect mixed green beans some ungodly reason covered layer bland potatoes covered layer melted cheese very well could Kraft singles   wasn't baked slightly roasty you'd expect actual Shepard's Pie but rather could very well microwaved   all less mediocre   Additionally manager bartender Reggie visibly stressed provided less polite service   Possibly OK place Harp Guiness though far better but don't eat there  <EOR> After reviewing previous reviews think twice trying Three Angry Wives because service issues   wonderful experience   service well quality food   let reviews sway trying establishment   fish chips caesars salad loved it Husband bangers mash just OK   All sandwitchs look wonderful coming kitchen definitely back soon  <EOR> We're area time dinner   Heading into closed off section diners sat booth   We chose order dinner entree section menu which only available 4 pm 11 pm   All entrees served soup salad vegetables garlic bread choice baked potato mashed potatoes fries   * BBQ Pork Ribs Slow cooked own sweet savory sauce  $18 Husband ate all pork ribs along sides     * New York Steak 14 oz  steak lightly seasoned broiled your liking topped mushrooms sauteed fresh garlic herbs  $19 finished steak mushrooms along string beans baked potato   There nothing special meal standard food although bit expensive   Service fine steady stream customers coming dine well   Apparently happy hour better call ahead check times happen  <EOR> I excited try place  liked music atmosphere but dark read menu the couple came leaving offer turn light on  no official server which understand can't helped if someone calls but really disappointed experience  ordered veggie potato add cheese accidentally put into computer add ham  told guy took order picked ham off ate it   not big problem  Except nothing done right he just seemed really annoyed us  When bill charged added ham  asked removing he told he did favor bc charge cheese cost more ham  He said he could read body language didn't husband a restaurant manager seemed upset  He then offered another potato?? Bc  wanted finished meal  Um   if mistake admit your fault inconvenienced customer least try right without poor attitude  Needless say left nothing but paid 50$ tab frown  <EOR> Bartenders amazingly slow unfriendly never came unless waved down  Bar currently 7 people 3 people behind bar couldn't look more serious  No personalities  never back  <EOR> When you're mood good beer dark bar yummy comfort food spot  only wish could enter non smoking section without walking through smoking section  <EOR> I thought place good choice try right   boyfriend sat little bar table good view baseball game   wanted try specialty dishes asked server Meat Loaf she sold item   boyfriend choose beef stroganoff dish egg noodles   Both dishes very flavorful very large portions   time left full!  service food great!  back! <EOR> Hoping authentic Irish pub experience Irish beer friendly people? Don't come here  No Kilkenny Smithwicks  Nothing food menu remotely non American  Unless count Shepard's Pie which actually English shouldn't count it  In pretty much empty bar asked move bartender some old guy could gamble machine sitting at  gamble other eight empty machines Old Yellow Hands!
