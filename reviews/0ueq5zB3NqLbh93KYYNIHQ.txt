I ordered Panang curry shrimp found flavorful spicy  shrimp cooked just right tasted great over some steamed rice  thought might little salty could ordered bit hotter I think did 5 probably could 6 7 next time   While enjoyed meal might try few other curries before coming back one   One favorite dishes spicy basil rice expertly executed perfectly 'spicy'  ordered beef thought could more meat but rice vegetables great complemented rest dishes quite nicely  Would definitely order again maybe chicken next time  level 7 good me   The spring rolls HUGE! Greasy good filled deliciousness  order came two sauces looked standard plum sauce other something garlic and maybe ginger? floating money!  Bottom line order if area! even if aren't  You'll thank all other 4 5 star reviewers later! <EOR> I food but few recent visits am taking down star    I think owners nice male server think manager very talkative friendly but servers isn't equal rest people good experience  older lady K name can't remember receipt said exactly but think said Kae several times hate call people but they've rude forget orders wrong orders once when just BF during UYE she gave curry no ordered few peoples things came wrong types meat most recently family didn't orders all doesnt really check people    Last weekend brought mom grandma law  Apparently mom law signed left customer copy receipt instead says merchant   really doesn't matter records but receipts print minus confusion  She parking lot catch yelling over over need copy  gave wrong copy  Where it? even when digging through mom laws purse she kept mom law back inside  Mom came back irritated  Said she continued repeat herself over over making feel she did something terrible tone voice when just piece paper  Its tried something bad she kept even when mom looking where she put receipt    I would come back certain foods but try come when friendly manager guy in  inlaws don't want come back though want only take them Pan Asian  <EOR> LOW LOW PRICES!! TODAY!!   Actually every day    You're going Thai Grill atmosphere unless really miss atmosphere your Grandpa's basement rec room  Light brown paneling rules day completed couple TV's sitting cabinet table red vinyl booths accented occasional touches almost matching duct tape  All needed furnace water heater peg board wall filled tools Grandpa's basement Thai restaurant illusion would complete    So food ask? legit hole in the wall find?   I'm quite sure  Mussman Curry shrimp  ordered medium but would hotter next time  sauce nice flavorful no remnants curry flakes seen other Thai places  included shrimp potatoes carrots onions peanuts  veggies fine although some them crinkle cut which found oddly distracting Thai food  shrimp good but little chewy  Could slightly overcooked could thawed quickly 2 methods same result chewy shrimp    I also ordered Thai iced coffee  server brought Thai iced tea which immediately started on  He quickly realized mistake brought iced coffee  drank most both actually preferred Thai iced tea  good earthy authenticity it  Between coffee tea fingers flying right now BTW    The total bill decent but outstanding meal? $12 06  Solid    There steady call in drop orders going local repeat customers knew name   generally good sign    The neighborhood is   well security guard patrolling lot dark  leave that  <EOR> For many Las Vegans heading part town might equivalent jaunt Thailand but really isn't far! happened side town other day  always curry adventure decided bold despite advertised lunch special served egg drop soup crab rangoon  items don't really say Tasty authentic Thai me   Looking over past reviews am pretty sure interior redesigned over past year  saw remnants wood paneling lining hallway bathroom but rest restaurant now kind Pier aesthetic  nicer anticipated   The service super friendly although did bit miscommunication  did want lunch special waitress thought did  She brought egg drop soup smile which point explained wanted dinner portion curries  She left egg drop soup couldn't resist teeny taste  describe succinctly cornstarchy English peas  didn't even eat entire teaspoon  definitely advise skipping lunch special   After soup wasn't sure expect  hand if can't deliver decent egg drop soup execute curry? other hand why should Thai place good egg drop soup first place?   For main dishes red Mussaman curry both tofu  Perhaps am looking hard enough perhaps isn't popular Thai dish but hard time finding Mussaman  admit giddy see menu! Given consistency curries would say using lot cornstarch thickening  neither thick nor thin  good sign  tofu fried but quality  ate mostly Mussaman flavor addictive  a true comfort curry  But really sweet could tell if tamarind perhaps some sugar delivering saccharine punch  should send taste buds bootcamp! minor detail wish more potatoes carrots dish    They don't brown rice  where does leave me? If side town really food oasis few respectable dining options but probably won't drive way return unless mean Mussaman hankering  But oh love Mussaman    <EOR> I say pleasantly surprised when dropped here  just moved part town Summerlin finished unpacking yet  decided try find something decent area eat  Thanks help Yelp!  So walk into restaurant Monday night pretty dead  decide take look menu some take out  girl front pleasant   I ordered Raw Salmon Raw Shrimp Spicy Fish Sauce #94   girl front checked chef mentioned salmon fresh but shrimp was  ended getting shrimp though more looking forward salmon  Anyway she then asked spicy wanted 1 10  Being used most other Thai restaurants area knew even 10 would weak sauce  Boy happily wrong  dish probably around 9 spicy scale loved it!  As actual flavors dish together beautifully  Raw shrimp large chunks garlic lime mint healthy dose minced chilies heavenly  definitely felt pain end meal which actually quite large  Bigger expecting   I'll definitely give place another try especially because saw sign says deliver! <EOR> Holy Thai joles!   I Sunday around 7 30  place empty other 20 Yelpers all gathered around table    Everyone ordered various drinks but most people opted Thai coffee tea  Thai tea great  would say most closely resembled iced chai tea latte Starbucks but even better doesn't cost arm leg    For apps entrees all ordered shared   best app far beef jerky  Unlike typical beef jerky pieces meat cooked but dried crisp marinated tasted teriyaki   I would say best entree tasted spicy shrimp pad thai dish  Great flavor spice  great each order pick spicy want it  give 1 10 scale   I wanted daring show off much enjoyed Thai cuisine ordered Jungle Curry  While some people may enjoyed thought tasted earthy    Other own bad decision really enjoyed food company  <EOR> Just finished takeout order Thai Grill    I'd previous time dining thanks spectacular memory no idea first time   remember enjoying since process trying visit review many Thai restaurants best Dan P impersonation figured worth another try     First thing note noticed online menu option getting seafood lunch specials   absolutely love salmon decided trying usual Basil lunch special but salmon instead chicken   even asked gentleman took order phone if opinion combination would okay I wasn't sure if love both items separately clouding decision   love bacon love cake dont want bacon cake   Okay maybe do   Nevermind     He said he thought would work okay it   also ordered regular iced tea including tidbit reason   When pick food all neatly packaged already   always love though did include regular iced tea bag which always throws off sensibilities hot vs cold well carry place bag appropriately car    Upon getting car promptly removed tea main bag way   Back office removed food started eating   Another noteworthy item soup lunch special actually included which seemingly rarity experience lunch special take other restaurants   soup very light brothed vegetable soup which enjoyed   When opening Basil dish much different any I'd ever seen before    Large chunks veggies carrots bamboo shoots cucumber squash tossed usual ingredients   decent amount salmon which skin left which plus far concerned   Overall enjoyed even though salmon didn't taste extremely fresh me    Even though did still think prefer standard preparation dish used just every other thai restaurant ordered it   honestly questioned if even I'd actually ordered  different was   Now onto regular iced tea     When removed bag car noticed different color usually expect iced tea   figured might some sort flavored tea which while prefer normal unsweetened wouldnt end world   Instead fairly certain thai iced tea which fan which actually potentially cause issues lactose intolerance depending way its made    ended throwing 2 sips clearly disappointed this   In end dont think would end Thai Grill again future generally know expect when order    Friendly service nice flavors Basil dish bump 2 star review would earned otherwise  <EOR> This great little secret hidden away small shopping center   few times usually very busy cannot figure because food delicious   love good eggplant eggplant tofu all dishes five spice perfect   Nice big pieces eggplant wasn't mushy   We pad see ew pad prik pork   Both dishes again cooked just spicy enough loved them both!  finally last dish beef panang   solid great flavor curries rich sometimes runny but perfect   know seems lot food but husband pretty typical     They open until 10pm place clean service great food great  <EOR> I've tried place before in dining however don't care location ESP night time decided take even though 6 miles from my home   ordered pork larb spring rolls Tom kha soup Thai BBQ chicken    OH Yummers!!! gave lot food same price most other Thai food restaurants!
