Gourmet hot dogs eclectic menu pulling Korea Mexico Thai balanced some American comfort   friend shared carne asada fries bulgogi sliced jalapenos amazing sauce   spice did disappoint food brought some culinary nostalgia wasn't expecting  <EOR> I brought food truck office lunch 60 people   Boyzie owner very helpful via email easy work with   previous great experience another food truck hesitant try strict hour lunch period again     Boyzie ensured would able all employees fed within hour recommended cutting down some options menu save time  took pre orders staff sent Boyzie week event   The truck super early around 10 45am even though lunch wasn't until 12   able set first group 20 food right dot 12pm requested for    rest staff all food before 12 40pm record timing     The hot dogs super delicious fries AMAZING!  guys came fast super friendly being 107 degrees outside     Thank again making seamless us   hope use them again soon  <EOR> Gut truck    Naw more flavor truck sent foodie God's   I waited waited waited try finally day came  line moved steady pace which course key food truck  tried Euro special fries Hawaiian hotdog  highly doubt could made poor choice but think definitely made right decision   Both exploding flavors over top  pineapple salsa Hawaiian sweet but much point took anything away pork butt  pork butt both well   as good any pigs @$$  Phenomenal choice ingredients friendly staff well put together gourmet meal food truck   easiest 5 stars given wow  <EOR> I've waiting try Buldogis food truck hearing many good things seeing everywhere! However pretty disappointed Bahn Mi  description made seem fun mix bunch different but harmonious flavors spicy salty sweet savory   but all fell flat  messier tasty opinion    Luckily Euro special fries made it! Yeah I'd eat again but if happens probably just stick fries    <EOR> My wife walked greeted right away hello welcome buldogs big smile workers face  place busy ordered chili cheese dig Hawaii dog  super delicious  French fries nice crisp  food fresh prepared wonderfully  coming back soon  <EOR> Honest God probably best hot dog ever had  said no expert when comes gourmet hot dogs but Buldogis served very VERY good one  definitely keep eyes peeled truck future <EOR> Buldogis best food truck ever anyone says otherwise insane! Anytime where food trucks look Buldogis if Buldogis isn't then usually just won't anything  euro fries fire! favorite Hawaiian dog Everyone working Buldogis always great food trucks restaurant  favorite hot dogs forever! <EOR> The price if would veggie dog inside regular hotdogs  just spot too  prepared worst experience something isn't even good hotdog stick  waste money took ten minutes  <EOR> The same olé Buldogis all know love!  We ordered some favorites such Banh Mi Dog Euro Special Fries   toppings taste you'd expect   excellent!  The only difference price   Most everything solid $7 which little less buck more brick mortar shop factoring sales tax    Well worth considering convenience truck   If see truck nearby worth stop!  Some best food truck goodies you'll find <EOR> I meaning try place but never chance count them being other side where live but encountered food truck First Friday try it! expectations place high did fail meet expectations  banh mi dog order euro fries all say WOW! pork belly bacon really complimented both hot dog euro fries  sauce flavorful nice kick it  slaw really good taste it  sausage juicy  All say buldogis some freakin' tasty hot dogs would definitely recommend them all friends  <EOR>
