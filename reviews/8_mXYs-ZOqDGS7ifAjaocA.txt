I luv support local establishments but also feel order survive especially economy right now people need feel getting bang buck cause $10 00 nowadays should provide more just good sandwich      <EOR> Wow cod shrimp   Excellent!  glad found place yelp   can't wait tell add seating next store <EOR> Went dinner other day  wanting try new place couple weeks  Would better if some tables  time home food starting little soggy  fried shrimp excellent definately order those again  Wasn't crazy over fried oysters though  <EOR> Looks closed down!
