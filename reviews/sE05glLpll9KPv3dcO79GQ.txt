Grub yummy buffet type food puts very good mood! <EOR> First off can't comparing seafood buffet twice price ones   seafood buffet many selections seafood   really snow crab cut half no shucking do   usually fill then warm station fried squid oysters shrimp   also grilled salmon mahi mahi   price 17 99 foods tastes good atmosphere great reminiscent old Vegas waiters excellent   pay points really enjoyable evening out  <EOR> it wasn't bad price $17 person   mashed potatoes needed milk cream stiff kung pao chicken horrible however did enjoy sushi boneless chicken patties flavored well  staff pretty friendly but décor sorta cheesy  whole time thinking Vegas Vacation know scene where Chevy Chase Randy Quaid hit buffet   it wasn't bad haha  say much better Treasure Island Buffet $30 person back 2012  <EOR> Awesome selection meats chicken pasta seafood sushi Chinese Mexican dessert  little taste everything don't buffets but love prime rib price $15 99 per person dinner great buy  Everything tastes great cooked perfectly constantly putting fresh food    The dinner plates all warm food hot salad plates hot salad cold sushi cold kept ice wasn't over stocked either   The staff all friendly helpful everyone smiles face very clean establishment  Kids welcomed very affordable take family night out    I highly recommend establishment if love buffets if aren't your thing give try you'll enjoy did  <EOR> Disappointed fact visiting decided lunch stopped paradise buffet wasn't told brunch ended 15 minutes arriving sat drinks first place mind since end very little selection new server switch change came rudely saying now only dessert since brunch over asked speak management manager blonde lady didn't name offered stay 30 min into dinner time honestly point didn't bother getting upset anymore because myself children already hungry decided grab dessert leave overall food ok say pay for!!!  Definitely coming back no communication between employees customers   Plus hearing staff dispute two tables down duties unprofessional  Wouldn't recommend unless u super hungry Fremont budget   <EOR> The steak served steak night way below average  roast beef carving station much better  Decent fried chicken salad bar  Pretty much would expect typical buffet  <EOR> On last night Vegas decided stay downtown try buffets area ended Paradise Buffet   $9 99 person regular buffet Monday Thursday really pretty good   decor very casino ish but try seem more tropical fake palm trees flowers everything   doesn't look bad inside though   lot different varieties food try   dinner companion little upset though didn't much way cooked vegetables   buffet downtown pretty good  <EOR> This buffet sucks!!! disappointing huge let down  prime rib chewing rubber  A 1 watered down  Don't here  You're better off eating   McDonald's! Don't waste your money time expectations! only two small lanes nasty cheap food! kind buffet that? Effen sucks major! <EOR> Well quite cheap used but can't complain $60 family four kind variety    just totally full everything imagine crab legs California sushi rolls    god some pigs there    watched dude literally take entire plate sushi rolls like 30 pieces thinking Dude WTF!

There really isn't ever whole lot going on  Very average traditional American food  would least expected some Hawaiian offerings seeing popular place Hawaiians   I would only recommend buffet if insatiable taste something overwhelmingly average  If much better  <EOR> If paradise think stick normal life   The Paradise Buffet Flamingo Casino Hotel most sorry excuses buffet second worst buffet eaten Las Vegas   The buffet hard find hard selection limited food just isn't good  While most buffets Vegas pride themselves seafood Paradise Buffet very little it     The center portion buffet dedicated shrimp cocktail crab legs but unlike Aria Buffet other top venues crab legs cracked open  buffet also some sushi but dry sitting while  sushi selection also very limited worst Las Vegas   The rest buffet nothing more home cooked items pot roast macaroni cheese Caesar salad boneless chicken  almost expensive glorified Old Country Buffet  But least OCB didn't pay $20   Of course if check in Foursquare save few bucks buffet  But Vegas wants stand line save money buffet  Just put five bucks into machine instead let ride   Best bet Skip buffet visit Flamingo just see flamingos outside  <EOR> Ate twice breakfast buffet  food average best but great price  Made order eggs omelettes decent enough  Bacon crispy but  preference  Service 4 star  If you're staying Fremont then it  <EOR> Hey cheap buffet Fremont Street  want? salad bar paltry but cheap buffet salad besides me?   good mashed taters decent roast  clam chowder gross though  Mexican portion buffet which enjoyed decent and California pretty hard impress Mexican food! I'd back  <EOR> Compared newer brethren Strip never overwhelmed buffet offerings side town afraid Paradise ironically named falls neatly under description   visited Wednesday evening line 10 15 minutes long   Then price reminded why tried buffet Fremont   $35 two!  days price more places Bellagio Caesar's Palace   Everyone register table nice folks keep your drinks full table cleared     Sure saw coming but come bulk quality   sampled shrimp pasta cream sauce roast beef fried chicken some stir fried vegetables Chinese station   steak night but didn't look steaks cook center station weirdly next desserts which also oddly where put sushi   Pasta meh   Vegetables meh   Fried chicken unbearably salty just ate breast meat which dry but hate wasting   Roast beef carving station tasty!  If hadn't discovered chilled peel eat shrimp three plates those would gotten slice own   marinate shrimp bay spices just enough brine flavor them   Squeeze three wedges lemon those heaven!  ate money's worth left just right level full     Would return?  Only if happened side town right time   Otherwise I'd still say more exotic buffets worth even more money  <EOR> I would given 3 1 2 stars if could only overall quality food offerings   We ended Tuesday night seafood night   bit pricey $27 99 1 person but really lot choose from   Let just bullet point 1 sushi should set fewer pieces rice wouldn't dried was   2 salad bar seemed fresh enough but didn't even bother that   had leave room everything else   3 cold bar oysters crab peel eat shrimp few other items wasn't sure about  shrimp good even though peel them   4 hot bar another story  Pasta didn't any ribs pretty tasty adequate meat crab yummy but would nice if least pre cracked crab crackers available ended using fork breaded shrimp ok nothing spectacular breaded clams I really looking forward but disappointed rubbery corn good seafood bisque soup probably best part meal!  5 dessert options plentiful but couple tried bit dried but still tasty   I guess real buffet person best judge seems much money little food take but buffets good   Our waitress friendly filled drinks timely manner  <EOR> Great location variety food selection however advertise unlimited lobster crab legs    they no lobster all    <EOR> I really don't wanna sound mean but buffet comes below average when comes vegas buffet     We're fremont area looking brunch   even if we're heavy eater vegas known buffets!

Sadly Friday seafood buffet drastically underwhelmed   taken all claws off crab legs left very small pieces crab broken legs etc     During stay ate breakfast lunch dinner   weekday breakfast excellent deal lot selection  brunch weekend overpriced essentially same buffet during week    For price good value   Place very dated but does give charm  <EOR> I mean look cheap buffet fill up  came breakfast buffet tax drink clocked around $10  However options super limited just few meats pancakes omelets insta eggs  eggs just       wow gross  <EOR> Came Prime Rib night prime rib lacking  dry overcooked tough  other selections buffet below average lacked flavor just dry mushy eat  desserts okay though    If eat cafe side Oxtail Soup  delicious! wish chose back cafe instead buffet    <EOR> I didn't any coupons paid 7 49 plus tax place   pretty happy until Main Street Cafe paid 7 99 three times variety food   However if gots coupon then Paradise might your bet   could really only find chicken worth eating   oh few items dessert area  <EOR> As far Buffets decent  better worse Imperial Palace   Nothing buffet really stands out  food selection plentiful but quality food could better  lighting really dark which didn't like  wait staff friendly attentive  <EOR> The pricing good service better buffet Vegas strip  during Thanksgiving week hard find place eat family 6 without super over charged  line moved quick food acceptable still varieties  If budget just trying eat basic dinner spend some time enjoying dinner your family  job  <EOR> i really buffet  Ive gone twice  first experience better second  I think Ive reviewed already  <EOR> Horrible  Simply horrible  food way below average single dish even ok relatively cheap price    An old electronic board hangs above tables displays todays date january 14 1998  board however sadly only thing  stuck 90's  restaurant's interior screams tacky early 90's design perfectly harmony staff's hideous flower patterned shirts dresses  owner hasn't thought making design change something never fully understand   But main part course food  honestly say worst buffet ever plenty  prime rib night course looking forward trying advertised prime rib  extremely blend reminded crappy pieces meat used school lunch first grade  lasagna macaroni salad crab salad even desserts all tasted last week's leftovers  Even bread stale terrible    Also nice surprise afterwards pretty sure food poisoned buffet  ruined whole evening afterwards surprised now when see other fellow Yelpers food poisoned well    When left place wanted stand outside warn people going there  girlfriend literally stop doing dragging away    So please whatever avoid place all cost  worth ruining evening your whole trip because restaurant's cheap prices  place feels crappy buffet cruise ship feel sea sick without even being ship  <EOR> it ok        ive experience buffet many many years ago prime rib roast beef very dry little tiny friends roaming around small sushi area  server took awhile check but ladies front very friendly  Many other options near try but hey       its buffet price should down just tab bit options serve  <EOR> UPDATE 2013 This place still great become Las Vegas tradition friends I  stop every time trip coincides seafood nights Tuesday Friday   soup day rotates always special treat when clam chowder  cold seafood continues highlight buffet although hot foods gotten slightly better although enough yet 5 star buffet even very affordable price   turned many friends onto place 11pm closing time great friends drive Southern California work Fridays  last trip crab legs no longer split  prefer them split them easier eat but know others feel unsplit crab legs retain taste better  biggest surprise now added snow crab claws  delicious despite being little hard eat although once learn trick they're easier eat snow crab legs even harder shell   _______________________________________________________________  This surprise last trip  really wasn't expecting much since never really hear any downtown buffets outside Fremont's sister property Main Street Station  Well hungry seafood fantasy night sounded good decided give shot    The room served might described tacky some but really it  old school feel  actually where Trent Mikey ended eating losing all money Swingers  movie does come close capturing feel room  Plus service pretty good    The main draws seafood fantasy night snow crab legs split easier eating oysters peel eat shrimp  crab pretty good  shrimp tasted good but seasoned would preferred them unseasoned  oysters awesome  ate dozen friend 2 dozen  sure others buffet more  oysters small but tasted good fresh  good any other oysters ever had just smaller  usually am weary buffet oysters even Rio's famous seafood buffet terrible oysters but good  also small sushi section which pretty basic shrimp nigiri California roll variations  surprised didn't more variety  also clam chowder no notices because put next honeydew melon  actually finished eating wanted few pieces melon dessert when noticed bowl  chowder very good  friend said best thing buffet  He ended skipping dessert eating another bowl chowder  Actually instead using little chowder bowls he grabbed ice cream sundae bowl dessert station himself huge bowl clam chowder   The other items buffet also mostly seafood  Nothing really stood except trout which very good  Some items little dry side such lasagna almost no ricotta seafood enchiladas  would preferred if kept more regular dishes instead doing many seafood dishes seafood fantasy night  little turf surf only items weren't seafood bread vegetables meats carving station fried chicken   All all really impressed quality price  <EOR> I am those old veteran longtime Vegas visitor still remember awesome $7 00 buffet Stardust Hotel Casino place torn down way   Those days long gone  Now Vegas turned into expensive culinary experiences cost range $35 00 $45 00 per person hotels Paris Trump etc  restaurant where hamburgers $75 00 each  What?!   Anyway no frill buffet offers variety dishes relatively cheap price  believe paid $15 00 per person dinner weekend  wait 25 minutes which bad compared likes Buffet Rio  food nothing special your typical pasta pizza dry roast beef water filled ham plenty desserts etc    This great place if just want fill your tummy gamble downtown  <EOR> Great food  Great price  But most all all Ramon  If sure ask sit station  He's best! <EOR> Food bland tasteless  Dry chicken tasteless vegetables questionable tasting baked potato hard dry desserts  Everything unfavorable   Place clean Staff nice Ambiance okay <EOR> I highly enjoy place usually cheap located Old Vegas  They usually unlimited crab legs other sea foods available which delicious  also great dessert selection   I enjoyed however past visit hiked price seafood which wasn't worth it  selection minimal   $30 pp necessarily worth it  Otherwise usually super cheap  <EOR> I eaten before terrific  tried again Sunday definitely wasn't worth extra $5  food all bland chase down waitstaff drinks refilled  <EOR> I place cause used kid family  remember liking Crab Leg night but back recently regular night felt kind sad  sushi terrible  liked mashed potatoes cream sauce chicken  it  waiters terribly slow too! <EOR> This buffet located Fremont Hotel Casino located Fremont street downtown Las Vegas   The buffet kitschy tropical theme    little sad reminds time when South Pacific more trendy now   buffet smaller Main Street Station nice Golden Nugget buffet   The food fine but wasn't large variety   dessert actually good   atmosphere dark gloomy   servers seemed worn tired   server complained 8 years working changed Coke Pepsi now he's all confused   This isn't buffet those Strip but pretty inexpensive bad investment  <EOR> For price place awesome! husband ate 5 7 days here  Great staff great food! <EOR> Very friendly prompt staff  Terrible horrible food  Fresh prime rib dry hard  Baked potatoes rubbery butter did taste cream tasted more melted plastic  corn bean veggies definitely frozen before probably cooked over over again  desserts okay surprisingly   Even $14 person dinner good choice AYCE  might well good steak very good sides Second Street Market Grill few feet down  <EOR> Not sure why only 2 5 stars   maybe people comparing buffets strip  Obviously going everything but price selection nice variety  brunch includes breakfast lunch dinner options  classic Vegas hotel casino buffet offers great selection great price only $13 50 players card!

But alas all just lackluster   sorry but even forgot take pics encounter lacking buffet   know many tourists especially Hawaii folks just buffet general all you can eat crab legs endless wonder   But when you're LV local myself kinda expect more your buffet!  Paradise Buffet just borderline OK much could find outstanding   The crab legs decent plentiful buffet but most them cold!  crab legs warm but really any station setup them serve warm crab legs   don't think hand chefs your plate ask them steam them either   Wouldn't funny!  All say please don't try this   interfere already disgruntled busy chef    asking trouble!  Most other offerings Paradise Buffet lacking well   baked fish alright but sitting under heat lamp long some pieces tough   Just FYI if Friday night mostly SEAFOOD being offered!  if you're meat only type person your night   Although serve nice prime rib au jus which probably best thing ate night   Medium rare extra au jus creamy horseradish side?  Made some good eating   But Las Vegas every casino some kind prime rib   it's practically staple!    The other seafood choices didn't impress much   fried clams soggy overcooked   pasta eh just pasta   Mexican offerings night NO BUENO   Just flavorless   Don't started sushi served RIGHT NEXT soft serve ice cream machine!  Talk fusion!  Unfortunately sushi just plain terrible dry rice suspect raw fish   Even basic Cali Roll falling apart   Besides prime rib only other saving grace buffet sandwich station located salad bar   Yes sandwich station   your own sandwich thinly sliced ham turkey roast beef!  Then pick cheese 2!  think only cheddar mozzarella offered night   roast beef turkey sandwich cheddar ton mayo helped save sanity   wasn't gourmet but familiar    Hardest part buffet swallow $22 per person  B Connected players card!
