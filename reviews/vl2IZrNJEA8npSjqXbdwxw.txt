Even daughter stated 5 stars she's picky seasoning texture food  Waitress many tables still able check take time order  We'd pick place over later ihop down street  <EOR> If ever you're Vegas drive off strip try place  Everyone's already said it Red Velvet Panckes ftw! pretty small place but quality food amazing  Along Red Velvet pancakes ordered Carrot Cake pancakes Almond Joy Pancakes side hash browns  carrot cake pancake exactly sounds just eating slice carrot cake  Pretty delish   Almond Joy pancake little overwhelming  think flavor should stay chocolate bar alone  45 min wait service good fast  such diverse selection pancakes its amazing but if you're feeling overwhelmed just try red velvet can't wrong! serve pancakes half stack full stack  Half stack 3 pancakes full 6  sure eat full stack but kudos you  definitely those places kinda try once  <EOR> This place incredible 10+ times awesome everything single time  Waitstaff great attentive orange cream pancakes crack! Always worth wait    fav Ranchero Skillet New Mexico green chile abundant perfect Added bonus Reggae playlist airing background   <EOR> The food amazing ! food deserves five stars but tiny you're basically squished   Wait 15 30 minutes long   Because its always full   <EOR> I'm kicking myself never being place all times Vegas!   This definitely must when you're town    Tons dishes choose all full   Easy place honestly great gem hidden desert    The servers friendly accommodating    There only few seats early avoid long wait    Parking does packed carpool if can    If you're strip it'll take 15 minutes without traffic    Trust me    place must!   Try fresh squeezed juice any specialties    Be sure tip well  <EOR> Wow those red velvet pancakes made register Yelp could give them review  quite reluctant first pancake flavors offer but wifey decided try it  Luckily first 2 times no lines  Anyway tried Red Velvet Pancakes Eggs Benedict made instant believers place  servers also great efficient pushy  Food served immediately even if waited long time open table  Also tried Adobo Fried Rice White Chocolate Pancakes Carrot Cake Pancakes eventually succeeding visits haven't disappointed bit time  Folks try place definitely breakfast heaven! <EOR> I think food babystacks very good but big issue establishment  won't seat unless your entire party there  understand sense case person gets seated bigger table then rest party doesn't arrive until much later which could cause wait times lengthen  However sometimes people only hour lunch if party meeting able early order everyone's food table time everyone else gets then what's wrong that? All food being ordered same time! Especially small party three which would take big table even if rest party held didn't show all food would still gotten paid for  Also if your establishment doing well unpleasant policy bc all people want eat your food then bigger establishment  Babystacks no hole wall even tourists there  would nice place afternoon brunch when family town friends except small  really food place but today made feel good work situation  When called girl answered phone said manager's call when asked speak manager she said Well he's busy if wanna hold would awhile  Just disappointing service  <EOR> This place favorite pancakes  two different types lemon pancakes favorites red velvet ones die for  service always great always busy  highly recommend place  <EOR> i discovered 'baby cakes cafe' back when offered groupon  luckily bought max which think 3  should've hubby buy 3 more groupon account  i digress     i haven't back since changed name baby stacks am curious reasoning behind name change  hoping still under same ownership   either way always great experience baby   cakes   stacks   this establishment  they wonderful selection filipino hawaiian breakfast lunch selections well extensive pancake selection  they also offer daily specials well daily pancake special  my favorite red velvet but lemon ricotta pumpkin banana p'cakes also quite tasty  the adobo fried rice omelet good better most other places town   the benedicts really good  but best thing restaurant they'll just anything want  whether subbing something menu just simply ordering something off menu they'll accommodate you   i haven't clue cook anything therefore can't attest freshness food  it would nice know if they're organic farmer friendly establishment  whether own sauces batters such  the only thing did notice maple syrup comes those costco sized cans  i think if more farm table type place i'd easily give them 5 stars   the coffee only just mediocre  i really wish they'd coffee game bit  i think that'd huge difference well   the service always great here  yes usually bit wait restaurant itself quite small  this place those hurry food run  it's relaxing spot those looking burn some time good food company good people  <EOR> We came weekday around 1pm no wait  Yay   many things wanted try but only eat much kahlua pig benedict  hubby spam scramble short stack bacon pancakes share   We both liked spam scramble most    simple yet delicious!   The kahlua pig itself also good though I'd say benedict hollandaise sauce two flavors competing each other   didn't quite together opinion   The bacon pancake just okay too  such high hopes since love both things   hoping bacon crumbled inside pancake but more two strips bacon plopped onto cooking pancake  pancake also seemed fluffy me   Maybe meal its own would've delicious but since already ate other entrees before trying became much   I give 4 stars overall because service superb many more things want try menu! <EOR> Wow! Simply amazing wish knew place long time ago  introduced establishment boyfriend absolutely love it  All employees courteous friendly long waiting times but only because wonderful are  Despite busy staff remains professional restaurant remains clean  They best sit arriving guest but location very small waiting time bit crazy   This restaurant needs expand business hours open more locations   I highly recommend everyone give try Babystacks very inexpensive amazing  <EOR> Awful  waiting 30 minutes hour wait girl said would still another hour  food good  Plus could use good cleaning over whole place  Next time want breakfast keep driving find another place  <EOR> Really delicious food favorite breakfast place every time come Las Vegas <EOR> Absolutely amazing food! place great customer service great place eat! Definitely try Eggs Benedict Loco Moco! <EOR> Go group sample many pancake flavors can! all surprising delicious    If you're going spend $ breakfast place it  honestly HATE spending money breakfast  pancake except some flour water?
