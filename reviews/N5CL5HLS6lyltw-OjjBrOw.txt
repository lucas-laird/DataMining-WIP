Management needs clue hostess seating people  avoid two  people sitting six tops making your larger parties wait tables  let people seat themselves its mess  Also give your servers busser during happy hour Monday busy but only 3 servers working no bussers no seating people   why takes 20 minutes drinks out  Its fair your servers effects tips ability money   Bathroom trash overflowing crushed chips  all over floor waiters station   This place could great if management gave staff tools succeed  <EOR> The drinks good! food pretty average little bland  carne asada cooked okay but fair portion price  chimmichuri sauce tasted nothing  Chips salsa good  Service decent  pretty much mediocre every way overpriced  also playing Beatles Bob Dylan   like thought Mexican place?? Would come back? Probably no  <EOR> I amazing experience Hussong's tonight thanks upbeat Bar Manager Jordan great fish tacos! man top notch customer service skills  He nice right off gate attentive entire time he even brought some bean cheese type dip try because first time there  He super personal demeanor totally feel you've known forever  don't give many great compliments restaurants because customer service seems dead most places but rave food salsas team tonight  all rock!

She spilt water table decided wipe dirty rag right next other friend's meal  Overall attitude just felt shitty    All flavors odd disappointing  Nothing ordered mentioned cilantro yet found all over meal  fried avocado heavy oily just good  Caramel filled churros contained exactly zero caramel  biggest disappointment street corn  easily most bland street corn tried    The only reason might find myself back would happy hour but definitely no rush  <EOR> The Mandalay Place believe exact restaurant even though happy hour all day Sunday great idea friendly quick staff food just ok   Many other Mexican restaurants better   margarita very sour   Good spot large group nice atmosphere prices     Check in free yummy Mexican corn back now haha   long Hussongs Cantina always just so so convenient   Happy Taco Tuesday happy hour! <EOR> I love Bulldog drink Chambord Margaritas   yum!

Coming business aspect why would choose over others?  We ordered rice bowl three tacos  Our food wasn't appetizing  only meat mediocre chicken  steak very funny taste having stomach bug really don't want mess food poisoning!  In other words won't returning   Wish better luck <EOR> I place  micheladas elote ceviche stacked quesadilla good  However service could use some improvement husband some friends brought don't feel worth coming back too  am still willing give another go  <EOR> Great food great happy hour great staff!

She said cheaper but somehow ended paying $23 4 tacos rice waters   We'll back but if see Naomi running hills  <EOR> After reading reviews skeptical but came late lunch Sunday  wasn't packed but started sat down  elote grilled corn delicious  also guacamole good much tomatoes read previous review  chips warm fresh also came 3 additional salsas  grilled shrimp Baja tacos hubby ribeye tacos spicy but also very good  would definitely coming back  Also server great she wasn't slow attentive  <EOR> Food AMAZING much flavor good portions  Drinks strong atmosphere always fun  Love place! <EOR> In all honesty didn't think memorable  service good food mediocre    Walking vibe reminds more cantina located beach  authentic Mexican cantina  waitresses friendly but short awesome  Amanda server great refilling drinks keeping food front us    The steak tacos some worst tacos ever had  shell awkward between   hard? soft? soft tortilla half way fried  good  fillings minimal  Barbacoa filling delicious but again shell confusing    Salsa normal nothing super tasty  Chicken quesadilla amazing  aioli inside chipotle  Tangy goodness  Margarita good but wasn't ordinary since margarita mix  Elote good but better street corners  just wasn't enough sauces balance char  Good but great  Pretty good price wise since free when check Yelp    The prices affordable especially since Sunday all day happy Hour specials  Also Monday through Friday happy hour 3 6  would only come back happy Hour  <EOR> This 10th time awesome usual  friendly waitress suggested some new menu items shrimp guacamole  best guacamole ever lot  came some pork rind side 3 salsas  margaritas voted best vegas year lvrj going argue   We came bad experience Mexican place down street Tivoli village  <EOR> We way Kona Grill when parked noticed Hussong's decided try since Kona looked pretty packed    Our waitress nice atmosphere cool but star lies quality food drinks    We ordered pitcher white sangria pitcher looked 7up maraschino cherries tasted non alcoholic Capri Sun  Zero buzz had   Chips salsa next  brought tray three different types salsa guess maybe there? Pineapple Chipotle Habanero  only remotely good habanero  other two literally awful didn't touch them taste    On recommendation server ordered pork belly tacos  wife ate carne asada tacos  Both dishes lacked serious flavor pork belly some reason diced extremely small taco  When ive pork belly its always whole really flavor texture fat meat  just strange    At very end meal waitress finally brought waters asked when ordered Sangria  already paying bill  Thanks that   Also WAY overpriced  <EOR> This first time found food good service quick friendly Chris manager simply outstanding!  Great seating view   a sure Friday place  <EOR> Terrible greasy food should known when saw rotten tomatoes market cart entrance  Food bad greasy  Bartender made several comments didn't appear very happy assist anything  Food hade no flavor poor quality ingredients <EOR> We've few times usually very busy which probably explains bad service time  We're Sunday afternoon  sat least 10 minutes before someone brought chips salsa but didn't take drink order  waited another 15 before could server take full drink food order  none times exaggerated promise   Another 10 minutes ask again drinks  Keep mind 3 other tables sat already gone through 2 rounds drinks before finally server bring ours out  over 40 minutes folks    Bad management really issue here  they're understaffed serve 80% full house no knows tables  hate badger servers because know hard work but asking much least drink order taken within 10 minutes  place isn't big  probably back but if even half full  <EOR> Made open table reservation 7 only waited few moments table ready  Server needs little better checking customers therefore lost star  Good food great value! <EOR> A wonderful incidental find during lunch Boca Park  am SoCal haven't any decent Mexican food last 8 months Las Vegas  colleague joking saying drive through Alberto's better anything town  Well say am rather impressed  The ambiance very casual which wonderful lunch  Don't know restaurant during dinner time since Boca Park restaurants zoo during dinner weekends    We two servers greeted gave history restaurant explained menu made some recommendations  service point enough attention pushy overly annoying just perfect  chips fresh very delicious  array salsas could choose plentiful  really spicier choices  original margarita wonderful  ordered combo tacos Baja shrimp Carne Asada   Baja shrimp best outside Baja Mexico  Carne Asada filled flavor  really enjoyed beans creamy delicious   Excellent food paired great service! <EOR> Fantastic food even better service!
