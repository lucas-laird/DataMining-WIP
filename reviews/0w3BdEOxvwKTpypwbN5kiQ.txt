I'd never seen brisket that  Anyhoo 3 stars because smoke grill annoying face pace involved tending food  couldn't just relax eat  salad very good though meats talked above  sides  I really only cared doughy pancake things  NO IDEA rest stuff actually aside seaweed type dish sprout corn thingy  Also your rice come oil  tastes oil without knowing layer salt sits bottom  when dumped into rice ruined rice  fault? Maybe  But if don't know salt you'll likely same  watch out  Prolly won't come back unless lady drags back  <EOR> This place pretty good pretty good value joint off strip    Since called tofu hut please note specialties just that  Tofu! Specifically Korean Soon Tofu dishes  Keeping mind ahead ordered kim chee beef soon tofu  dish itself bad think may needed little more salt but then again decent ban chan took care that    I would back try some other dishes  other Vegas spots open late!

usually AYCE bbq $16 99   kalbi used be   short ribs?  now serve boneless think short rib style more tender   Pork belly weird taste it   Hubby likes chicken   Good banchans used potato salad oh good  <EOR> Always experience bad customer service lack of  started going across street D J K BBQ  Food better Tofu Hut customer service excellent  don't think ever back Tofu Hut  <EOR> I always comes Korean Bbq  Price good food good especially beef  tongue   much choices but meet good enough     I more paid for  Its $12 99 10 00 pm   and  $16 99 before 10 00 pm     place lot cheaper best compare any other Korean BBQ place   <EOR> I couple times  try different kind tofu pot  all good especially little side dishes   However never try Korea BBQ  Because good price always wait long line even late midnight  <EOR> Service meh  server zoned grumpy unprofessional  The kimchi radish side dish MEH  I liked side dish jap chae clear noodles marinated soy sauce oil tho   I ordered dumpling soft tofu soup medium spice   It okay best had   The rice cooked stone bowl scooped stainless steel bowl served   water poured into stone bowl some remains flaked rice left served  It appeared BROWN    diarrhea the rice okay but spectacular  As stone bowl DON'T even taste contents  left bad burnt taste tongue  Gross  Totally ruined meal  <EOR> I'm going fess admit know nothing Korean food   only other Korean restaurant prior wasn't good   But now am vegetarian am always afraid different place fear little fishies might lurking eat   Well getting coupon Tofu Hut decided finally try some Korean food again   We Friday night place dead only couple white 20 somethings sitting tables   guess wasn't good sign   Unlike most reviewers actually really great server   He pointed everything vegetarian could made vegetarian 2 tofu soups 2 entrees even brought bottle sauce use some dishes could look label bonito vegetarian    He very friendly never annoyed questions   He also attentive kept water glasses full   They started salad   much it just some iceberg lettuce dressing but actually pretty tasty   ordered bibimbap buckwheat noodles both without meat of course    bibimbap came order tofu soup which nice little surprise   The tofu soup really flavorful favorite part meal   even nice enough ask if could crack egg before did knowing vegetarian   expecting good things everything else but sadly just progressively worse     The banchan boring   kimchi bean sprouts iffy fish content pickled seaweed ok but little flavor potato pancakes tasted absolutely nothing   bibimbap ok but lacking flavor depth   could course fault dietary restrictions but don't think should hard season some rice veggies   buckwheat noodles just some cold noodles drowning salty liquid covered some iceberg lettuce   Meh   It sad since such helpful server but he really couldn't save meal   Perhaps just under developed Korean food palate?  really hope not    It appears though everyone comes barbeque maybe you're better off ordering that  <EOR> This place good  nice selection meats    We ordered squid tripe Spicy pork belly beef tongue  When your order squid whole squid which cool tripe also beef intestines which really good cleaned intestines pretty well because don't any strong flavor would normally if someone didn't clean well  beef tongue very tender pork belly which lot because nice kick it  Yum  thought side good well  could them more without being charged extra    Service ok  But only because busy  pretty sure if weren't busy service would little bit better  But  any place   What really love place quality everything really good price offered  Well worth it! <EOR> This place hella amazing  couple friends then brought roommate now she's addicted    This place always packed prepared least 30 45 minute wait  <EOR> Good Korean bbq place  serves reasonably priced grill also table order section case want see full provisions  being said limited amount space may wait while longer since isn't much grills  salad great comes 4 sides all day all eat bbq grill  nice grill menu but lacks things some veggies put grill  Great place choose niche bbq place  would keep coming back  <EOR> Wow such bad reviews place?

guess change monotonous   The place no frills KBB but found slices meat seemed better quality then average KBB  Tongue brisket staples good more surprising short ribs tender cooked very well  The grills themselves very seasoned meats did stick  Ban Chan good but over abundant  <EOR> I love place  best AYCE restaurants town  often meat good great price $16 99 per person  tried everything menu but now only order beef tongue pork belly squid kalbi steam egg which most  salad other sides pretty good well   I think offer $13 99 per person 9 pm but price can't kalbi steam egg  Their place small may wait if during dinner time  <EOR> All eat BBQ! steamed egg best dish  marinated foods really sweet  <EOR> It's first time only thing didn't really service  No even greeted when waiting server even walked past couple times check list without even saying word  rude  food great pork belly fatty more fat meat  salad really good give 6 banchan many eat  Lol  think $16 99 good deal considering amount food get  short ribs yummy ribeye good but best quality meat  paid for  definitely come back girlfriends next time  <EOR> First time here   as vegetarian didn't find whole lot menu but ordered bi bim bap meat egg less  'ok'  tofu soup medium heat however AWESOME  <EOR> My family always wanted try Tofu Hut most time stop always busy long waiting list  Sounds pretty good place AYCE Korean BBQ right!?

Does anybody actually eat other side? would imagine profits would much more substantial if entire place converted KBBQ which would definitely cut down wait times  finish new price much better options such Hwaro BiWon Doh  would only return Tofu Hut now last resort  <EOR> Best Korean BBQ Vegas  Love marinated pork belly squid  salad addicting  Staff friendly  long wait weekend nights but  expected  Korean BBQ spot! <EOR> Steamed Egg Goodness!!!  Any way arrived 11 30PM AYCE BBQ $13 99 11PM 5AM pay full price $16 99 10AM 11PM if want short ribs steamed egg 11    We started short ribs ribeye marinated pork belly   Right placed order sides came out   tofu noddles dish pancakes favorite everything great   When meat arrived waiter helped piling ribeye all together because cooks juicier laid short rib pork belly    never really worked BBQ before must looked first time because kept coming back moved around stuff   Basically its hotter side grill other     The short ribs very tasty however trying keep some manners rip meat off bone lol!  Rib eye marinated pork belly also very good but since didn't really move around kinda burned   For second order ordered brisket pork belly   waitress suggested steamed egg since paying full price anyways   really thought     ok try its probably just going egg topping some Thai food   brisket came huge serving fresh frozen! pork belly equally good time actually kinda hang cooking     Now gold medal steamed egg came she warned going really hot   probably waited 2 min  when took first bite    OMG never egg before   mean whole new outlook eggs   come theory its egg steamed chicken stock green onions   Seriously taste buds dancing singing!  waitress  came back sure everything good told try beef tongue squid but full   After hour half finished all meat some sides   She came back Korean drink dessert very very sweet! paid she told its only $4 pack 50 Asian markets   bill came $36 60  Totally worth it   Since don't lot experience cooking Korean BBQ 5 stars because extremely  helpful courteous   service really could any better! think humoring them while trying cook but all good fun  water always full all sides refilled when asked   probably place we'll back during late night eating binges  <EOR> I've many times They serve good food but when we're way called asked time close girl phone said 1am she said there's no available seats close right away I hungry birthday And says online close 2am <EOR> This ayce bbq place average  Good price good food nothing great  bulgolgi could more flavor  Service ok but since busy hard flag down two servers when needed things    The AYCE $18 30 per person tax   I did see did special AYCE  price 10pm $13something <EOR> First time having KBBQ Las Vegas I'm LA very impressed  Everything good deliberation shouldn't hard  Only drawback place long wait but granted Friday night  expected  Also lobby sitting area very small resulting lot standing  Wish would expand place but overall pretty good  <EOR> One best Korean BBQ places town  may wait hunger grow but does food taste much better  salad filling BBQ comes your request unlike other places BBQ Nazis   prepared wait cheaper others therefore require long waiting period  <EOR> Tried Korean BBQ AYCE Las Vegas Chinatown  first time party three arrived 1 30pm Tuesday   did wait all table   The service prompt asian friendly   mean asian servers don't usually engage patron other types restaurants cultures   said server fine gave service sort smile  She no means rude testy   This only 2nd time cook your own spot   ordered marinated sliced ribeye beef tongue short ribs brisket  also steamed egg  meat items all very tasty tender except tongue which chewy side but  probably is   ribs especially melt in your mouth tender   steamed egg nice counter all meat   The meats preceded usual pickled vegetables kimchi nice vegetable tossed salad  rice very good also   All in all tasty fun experience   such great bargain!  Thumbs all around  <EOR> Amazing Korean BBQ well entrees   sides always nice changed different all time   Everything fresh prepared nice   Friendly staff customer service great   white broth soups which find funny since am Korean   All all FAV spot Chinatown Korean BBQ  <EOR> My first time here   definitely last! While food okay cleanliness level definitely turned off ever returning    I came fiancé 10 month old son Monday afternoon  When arrived wait just couple minutes them clean off table  When table noticed still dirty! Still condensation rings cups still greasy sticky multiple parts table  ended cleaning ourselves baby wipes    We needed high chair son oh wish high chair cover provided us  high chair nastiest high chair ever seen  lots dried food sticky all over! tried clean baby wipes but only much could do  doubt ever cleaned high chair  disgusting nasty   We seated against windows could just see amount dust dirt window sill  floors also super greasy   could literally slide around floors  just loved getting banchan served filthy tray pieces raw meat rice it  Would kill them wipe down serving trays?  Normally wouldn't stay place all red flags  But appointment didn't time somewhere else   We ended ordering marinated ribeye short ribs beef tongue beef brisket pork belly  all pretty standard far Korean BBQ places go    Standard Korean BBQ filthy restaurant  No thank you  <EOR> Went Tofu Hut first time some friends absolutely loved it! Food great price  $16 99 good AYCE  However im only giving 4 stars because seems since include gratuity your check $4 05 don't pay much attention customer service  did ask few times refills which included friend getting seat find server  <EOR> I used really Tofu Hut  thought late night special such great deal! $13 99 10pm    However recently back Korea where Korean bbq constantly  more expensive eat Korean bbq but meat quality much better  last time Tofu Hut meat horrible  Kalbi tough  Most meat tough dry  really enjoyed steam egg salad but eating Korean Bbq eat those items    The service decent  neither good bad  Nothing worth noting about    The meat quality pretty horrible don't know next time returning  <EOR> Their late night special includes seating area featuring secret menu item called false hopes  <EOR> Great price!!! Lots meat choices!!! super delicious beef tongue  better if more kinds sauces  <EOR> This place good all! didn't change grill when needed brisket sauce tasted water  marinated pork appetizing  Also ran brisket sauce!!! could've made more! <EOR> Tofu Hut usually place friends frequent night alcohol binging around town   usually come AYCE since they're open late 4am    always order rib eye brisket marinated pork belly bean paste soup so good all alcohol!    amount meat consume $13 99 very much worth it   Come if you're having some late night munchies  <EOR> Fact if upwards 18 tables your dining room 2 servers whom manning cash register need Asian math enough people manage operation    I came right before Christmas fam bam because nothing says holiday cheer hot bowl tofu  all tofu premises around Vegas usually frequent Tofu Hut below + Consistency + Flavor + Prices lunch specials M F excluding holidays things wait for Seating Ban chan Water  Hot tea  Beverages general  Having your order taken  Your check    So another math lesson 3 pros 5 cons muy malo  However when your pros outweigh cons but come back otherwise solid tofu fixing? If can't 'em join 'em  <EOR> I wouldn't back   only good thing stuff your face only  $16 person   However always line half store reserved non korean bbq customers which saw NONE because space used inefficiently   Almost all meats very bland until added oil concoction already table   No server offered any advice using oil nor did even notice oven wasn't lit when meat until said something   Very inattentive servers most didn't seem speak understand English   Even salad comes all eat very bland   then find charge automatic gratuity parties only 4 more   guess tip added TOP total tax   fact pushed over edge   thing charge gratuity such small group then pay poor service then find charged ADDITION taxed amount?!?! Very uncool unfair   said wouldn't back   BTW thought Korean BBQ meant bone in short ribs Kalbi    Apparently even meat called short ribs all eat menu that   instead fairly bland tasting meat no bones  <EOR> Honestly first name restaurant threw off but once or if you've heard other people Korean place!  I always love going lot isn't anything cooking your own Korean BBQ  side appetizers always available you  place bit small but isn't bad amount AYCE people  regular side where just order food but actually haven't side just enjoy AYCE much!  One small thing would change close some grills are  some tables I believe 2 or 3 grills same table  wouldn't want grill same someone else's party cooking reasons  Also neighbor's smoke could travel your side when you're finished cooking vice versa   I still love coming though definitely come lot  <EOR> I've coming Tofu Hut years gotten better over years specifically service  don't think simply fact since usually 2 3 times month recognized regular customer but observe other tables getting good service well   Food pretty good whether decide All Eat regular menu  AYCE good great value favorite meat brisket  also love salad greens soups bean paste egg come along meal  banchan some best tasted any Korean restaurant    Overall good service decent value above average option lunch dinner late night feasting  loyal customer continue come long nothing changes   Tip When you're done your meal waiting check but can't seem flag down server just front counter pay your bill there  <EOR> This place really gone downhill  Yes price cheap all eat korean BBQ but willing risk your health cheap meal? Korean restaurant where see no Korean customers  saids all  <EOR> If you're expecting great service   then place you  BUT if delicious tofu soup all eat korean bbq then your place    All tofu soup don't exceed 10 dollars   You all little korean side dishes if just order tofu soup all eat korean bbq   I think all eat korean bbq cheaper most places Vegas  If remember correctly dinner time all eat 18 bucks so  <EOR> Stopped old favorite last night Tofu Hut Spring Mountain just east Harbor Palace other side   craving some hot tofy soup seafood but noticed huge sign window advertising all eat bbq $16 99  wife it!

Bulgogi overcooked time went    much biggie because short ribs perfect  biggie customer service  When asked employees politely refill side she walked right past without acknowledging then returned later just taking dish without saying anything looking me  She quickly came back refill but found rather rude being acknowledged all   as if wasn't there  cool  Overall service inconsistent every time head here  Depends server course but everyone Yelp knows love friendly people tip generously it  Tofu hut realized expect much staff anymore   I eating quick fix Korean  If wasn't affinity towards soup I'd prefer ambiance experience Soyo located Rainbow Blvd Warm Springs <EOR> The food pretty good  If want Korean bbq he place be  small place wait might very long depending when go  all eat variety bad price  <EOR> I don't usually going korean BBQ because just eat home family  night decided some friends because just finished date night some paint wine thing  three hours drinking wine painting hungry  decided Tofu Hut because AYCE option  Also starting 10pm AYCE cheaper normal during day  kind busy ended waiting around 20 30 minutes  old korean ladies never very pleasant nice never smile  Whenever ordered meat food would give blank stare walk off  Also salad bland tasteless  Part korean BBQ experience eating yummy salad comes it! salad no flavor really dry  felt if eating bunny food ugh  Next grill burning much bottom started burn  thought boyfriend's pants fire first started freak out  bottom part grill overheated something much smoke smelled gas  thought going blow might think im overexaggerating but ten seconds did  old korean lady rushed over took off grill then dumped ice everything  all lost appetite did want eat anymore  asked check once did apologize happened even give some type discount even finishing food  NEVER coming again <EOR> I really hate because once Go to spot KBBQ   best late night price Vegas $13 99 even regular all day price $16 99   mean really cannot price!!

I tried AYCE which very good under $20 dinner even cheaper lunch  meat good fewer side dishes other places but order bean paste soup steamed eggs your AYCE which every place has    The best deal combinations listed under Lunch Specials but ordered dinner too  4 people usually order Chicken Combo Rib combo which comes two meats two soups  Order 2 extra rice everyone happy satisfied stuffed! Comes under $40 4 people very good food!   Have coming years continue come back  Service good come often waitress remembers usually asks if doing same always <EOR> my family used LOVE coming Tofu Hut  Every birthday dinner special occasion etc  long time staff knew remembered us  Then things changed    Before things changed it's least 2 years would given place 5 stars  Now give two    I haven't eaten probably least 2 2 5 years things may changed since then    My husband eat night decided Tofu Hut  arrived waited 5 minutes seated no reason busy waited another 5 minutes water drink order taken  Oh didn't give menu's either  Good thing already knew wanted didn't need them  placed order when ordered drinks  drinks came when husband's bulgogi came table  another table seated already received food 5 10 minutes before Chris' food came yet ordered other table ordered kalbi which also ordered  When Chris' food came food did come out  couple minutes later other table received food  told Chris wait eat food would cold  checked all    After 10 minutes waitress brought ANOTHER plate kalbi other table looked very concerned already front them  She did bring food  Instead she into kitchen where 5 staff talking over why extra plate which am sure assuming order made twice  packed food offered other table NO CHARGE!   Chris finished food before any staff ever came check table  still received order  furious! Apparently though waitress remembered order put before co worker notice original waitress passed check table next us  commented woman would paying bill which she very concerned  manager came ask why explained situation  Rather apologize offer any sort acknowledgment mistake manager became angry insisted pay bill because food almost ready  ALMOST READY?? point waiting NEARLY HOUR!   We paid check though tempted simply pay Chris' walk out  wrote note points improvement considered tip  back since    Note long enough ago did all eat option if says anything timeframe  <EOR> This place great  Always long line waiting BBQ but still people waiting it  Because deserve waiting    I love short rib beef tongue steam egg  Especially when eat meat salad delicious    We come back soon <EOR> Average kbbq spot  Don't expect quality meat good service  understand gets busy but when you're slammed you're just chillin front when continuously ask water gets annoying  many kbbq spots where they're busy still best provide best possible service  Price good but said don't expect great quality meat  Just something cheap filling  <EOR> About year ago line door Pho Kim Long across street thought Well why don't try something new?  Tofu Hut place across street all eat? bad be? Thankfully experience wasn't bad all back number times since then  Note also first  Korean BBQ experience   Thank Tofu Hut being open super late offer this! cheaper lower end Korean BBQ spectrum Spring Mountain offers IMO higher end being Honey Pig but  another review altogether  all eat specials really AYCE 13 99    Tons decent food 12 choices available meat cook eight side dishes salad pretty rockin' tofu soup whole thinly sliced meat combo     My only complaint no AYCE person need least two  The staff review stated always flustered because huge groups loud crowds show half drunk place ends mobbed they're unfortunately under staffed   staff friendly kick Korean programs show television which usually karaoke K reality programs     If night particularly Friday Saturday night hot spot the club crowd around 1 2 3AM   if you're looking quiet dinner don't recommend those particular nights   My current favorite thing tofu dumpling soup spicy tofu soup some hot dumplings simmering away there   spiciness level pretty good although could PINCH more medium     I also recommend bibimbap clay bowl sucker stays hot quite some time take your time  <EOR> Fully satiated eaten grilled meat Every night only eat night place often come But never commented barbecue more cost effective favorite salad eat 4 5 bowls each time Although service normal But barbecue OK Give praise <EOR> Disappointed  LA BBQ much fat  Where beef? C'mon    Maybe because combo? Cheaper regular price should deserve that?  I mean tofu soup fairly okay but tofu soup LA Bbq together because just perfect combination  Maybe because SoGongDong Tofu place New Jersey gave really good experience might high expectation but still feel isn't right  I try another tofu place next time  <EOR> Compared most KBBQs town variety setting does Tofu Hut  stumbled together some friends first semester radiology school ended  first KBBQ outside California trying others Woo Ché Korean Garden Kimchi Korean BBQ strip Tofu Hut satisfies palette leaves pleasurable stomach ache being full !   Each everytime come place huge group  Now place isn't super big but staff especially Rachel very accommodating helpful  talking groups 6 8  mean groups 12 15!  If you've already know mean   Most time visit haven BBQ late night 13 99 special AYCE  Aside AYCE ala cartè menu well  side dishes salad bonus festive colorful flavor Korean cuisine   favorite pancake   pancake mix vegetables fried batter usually served warm   starchy texture brings more soft chewy feel crunchy bunch little appetizers bring you   If come little earlier evening order steamed egg mix rice with! twist Asian folks anyone likes fried rice  say? work best! Haha! now meat Brisket  most popular choice AYCE menu! thin slices easy quick cook serve  seem burn really quick if leave them grill minute longer soon they're browned   Add bit soy sauce lemon while grill extra flavor! Ribeye bulgogi  meatier meats!  personal favorite meat department   ribeye very tender takes bit longer cook  flavor exceptional suggest adding bit more  majority your choice meat   also order some garlic slices side brown edges grill! BOMB!  Marinated Chicken  least favorite  takes while cook can't eat chicken when looks vampire bit into neck  Unlike red mea meat family chicken isn't flavorful but if chicken bit spice take patience cook off side back when because does kick!  Beef tongue  very skeptical first but taking chance try really flavorful  looks brisket if only comfortable having your own tongue your mouth ask your friends what's before start shoveling into your face!   Burns quick pull off grill fast enjoy!  Squid  someone knows cook right  if aren't decide Mr  Iron Chef just know if over cook you'll feel Fido home chewing rubber! Add some vinegar hot sauce some garlic chips you're set!  Pork belly  Looks big slab bacon tastes pretty much same  cook extra crispy bacon! Add some sesame oil the stuff tiny dish salt it extra MM MM flavor!  Note If aren't radish fan don't eat square vegetable reddish sauce  called daikon  But always suggest trying everything once  Other yelpers appreciate taking team! Oh if decide take your date give them courtesy reminder whichever car decide take smell BBQ few days! Hahaha Happy eating! <EOR> Definitely favorite Korean Bbq Vegas! all other restaurants Vegas still never fail stop Tofu Hut when visit    Definitely come hungry  All eat $16 99!!   All sides good salad give tasty!!!! just eat that! favorites definitely brisket ribeye!   Ohhhh mouth watering just thinking tofu hut! Can't wait next visit! <EOR> Meat quality isn't great if you're looking cheap Korean BBQ  Only half restaurant dedicated KBBQ while other half nearly empty most day I don't see why should add grills other half place since drastically cut wait time half since people    If you're looking authentic KBBQ somewhere else  <EOR> The service fine its standard all eat Korean BBQ place if you're someone wants server cook then Magal but if you're person likes grill yourself I'd definitely liked place its affordable price efficient refills meats drinks  group friends busy Friday night bit wait list but fast servers quickly brought meats grill  fun dining experience service accommodating its standard  <EOR> I haven't eaten almost three years  heard would close doors due health issues main concern  However experience amazing  quality food great price paid well worth it  wait attention received wasn't best which why gave three star rating  If waiters didn't look bothering them every time asked extra rice then would've gave them higher rating  <EOR> The food okay but restaurant looks dingy staff always seem annoyed see you   I wouldn't minded enough start exploring other kbbq locations  until night 1 15 a m  friend arrived late night dinner work gotten off 12 30 am posted hours 2am 2 30am but 1 15am very rudely told leave weren't seating anymore guests because close closing time  need update honor hours!  Also didn't realize until other korean bbq locations even option servers help cook your food if you're unsure something other kbbq places practically insist let them chicken but Tofu Hut servers all just stand around chatting counter give dirty look when finally attention  <EOR> By giving place 3 stars being generous   Meat good service good but name place TOFU hut  BBQ Hut     My Nipponese wife ordered Tofu soup tasteful flavorful faucet water  just color soup   love soup but pretty disappointed    Sorry guys!!! <EOR> Great food  Just can't behind idea paying much cook own dinner  <EOR> This restaurant alright  wish customer service better  severs host barely talk every time girlfriend never give straws cups  would ask them every time  food overall great if cook them your satisfactory level  Other then business booming expect see lines before coming here  don't know happened salad but good  <EOR> I 2 days ago when Vegas family vacation  food bad but service very disappointed   @ 1045 pm which special price customers eating between 10 pm 2 am   3 adults 2 little kids   said kids charged half price adult which fine however did tell short rib order won't covered promo price   ordered 2 short rib 2 thin beef 2 pork belly  2 steam eggs 5 people   Because 2 order Short rib wouldn't want charge promo price even kids ate meat barely   If ate lot meat usual all eat places wouldn't mad  However late night only ordered 6 portions meat but still charged full regular price even kids made very disappointed customer service  Before left told them felt getting charged full reg price but did CARE!!  I RECOMMEND PLACE   <EOR> Thought wouldn't place  But turns did  Didn't opt all eat since date wasn't hungry  Next time try all eat! <EOR> Located just off Wynn road Spring Mountain China Town Las Vegas   I give place 4 stars straight point only because keep coming back more  must mean something considering nothing really special place  simple simplicity gets  small AYCE Korean BBQ enough choices satisfy those Korean craving tastebuds  But any given night prepared wait anywhere reasonable 30 minutes sometimes ridiculous 2 hour standby  pretty much hit miss just expect expected  10 00pm discounted price $13 99 compared $16 99 regular price which still bad   Just know discounted price include short ribs steamed egg  opt those prices those menu items included   This place KTNV channel 13 news Dirty Dining before but guess sometimes dirtiest place taste good! No pun intended but saying good status acclaim   times however clean enough but behind kitchen only prying eyes know    place could improve size but think renovating place question   Again place anything special but local hot spot amidst Chinatown district open late those night owl cravers  recommend though! <EOR> Nice price ayce korean bbq   Small little shop good list cuts choose from   I first discovered place friend since haven't found decent ayce bbq place   First attraction price   Two different prices offer prefer late night     A lot people marination meats but prefer simple fast cooking meats   Load brisket sliced rib   Easy cook easy see if cooked properly   Don't want consume undercooked meat   enjoyed service very fast pace top bringing asked for   did try intestines but no taste   Very hard swallow   condiments offer wonderful always steamed egg   didn't enjoy bean soup very much much flavor     Place gets very packed coming early recommended   menu selection folks choose instead doing ayce  <EOR> Came first time today dinner around 7 30  Food great AYCE! reason why im giving three stars poor seating system mediocre staff  Other place good! Would recommend fun dinner experience  <EOR> Yes would think place called Tofu Hut would know something tofu but don't   listed under specialties Stir Fried Kimchi Tofu waiter acted he'd never seen menu before   end result kimchi stir fried spicy sauce some scallions which actually tasty but very exciting surrounded uncooked un marinated tofu slabs   right way prepare tofu   wasn't even any extra sauce stir fry put tofu   can't speak meat dishes but dinner companion didn't seem impressed  <EOR> Visiting area stayed Palms hotel far all restaurant  Decided give place try  nephew wife told place all eat dinner order AYCE four  favorite short ribs really good  also steamed egg wasn't good all  no flavor tasted bad wet scrambled egg no flavor  But everything else good give restaurant try won't disappointed  <EOR> The food usually well worth AYCE BBQ  If come between 10pm 2am everything $13 99 usual price $16 99  also short ribs steam egg those items no matter time come $16 99   If never Korean BBQ before great place start  recommend salad pancakes brisket steam egg    Watch long wait cause take over hour seated sometimes  place small service BAD but hey your doing cooking BAD service learned brush off  hit miss us  days when salad meat point then days where everything just doesn't taste right  most part leave FULL satisfied another many once month spots  <EOR> Wow worst service ever   Friend recommended place because good food is  Turns he's right  food pretty good  marinated ribeye slices pork belly    When service came around no greeted sign basically  seated 20 minutes server came around notepad started wait well nice meet too?  After she never came back different server orders refill drinks give check which all due asking it   Food great service needs lot improvement    <EOR> A nice show stopper restaurant take family friends to impress where grill your own food  Food amazing it does help if someone party knows cook meat   if definitely learning experience you   All eat over all good place  Only recommendation if your traveling big party arrive early  party 7 waited bit table  Also if traveling big party apparently gratuity included bill without server informing indicating bill   just heads if don't want double tip <EOR> How cool! never place this! guess could consider lazy part cause cook food yourself but  it! Nom Nom fun!  Transfriendly B+ no issues <EOR> I place first time definitely back   I lived Seoul 3 months really missed eating food  really into Korean BBQ but hear its great  Love traditional daily Korean menu    The waiter awesome torn between tofu soup Bibimbap but he pointed bibimbap comes tofu soup its only buck more? perfect  all those little banchan kimchi dishes bring beyond stuffed but good kind stuffed    I'll back sure    also suggestion kimbap rolls would sweet! <EOR> Great stuff Tofu Hut! really love Bim bim bap  kimchi jig gae really good well especially cracked egg  Yum! service quick  great place reasonably price simple quick Korean meal  recommend any Korean food lover Vegas  <EOR> Waited over hr half  worth wait nor price  Meat selection mediocre  Side dishes alright  Can't compare Socal KBBQ  <EOR> I couple times past but couple years mainly due recent health issues having around 2013 but decided give another try came last month Rachel Stephanie K Michael K  Friday night when arrived 30 40 min wait! Wow never seen packed! guess people weren't concerned health violations anymore which good sign me    Once sat down ordered bunch food including marinated short ribs kalbi spicy pork pork belly marinated pork belly marinated rib eye bulgogi beef tongue steamed egg  also brought big house salad rice banchan dishes while waited meat  banchan ok really only liked kimchi  salad surprisingly very tasty actually wanted more! salad banchan refillable don't shy! all eat!  As usual favorite meat pork belly! basically just sliced pork belly but great salt pepper oil sauce mixture give you  kalbi bulgogi good but thing kept wanting more pork belly! also couldn't enough sauce even though simple  show sometimes best things life simple things! steamed egg also awesome could've eaten multple bowls! least favorite marinated pork belly which looked mushy chewy pork belly all     The grills ok just sure yours turnt because ours wasn't beginning trying figure why taking long warm up  vents also nothing you'll smell grilled meats when leave I'd suggest getting all dressed come eat here  staff ok well  Sometimes hard server's attention because busy flag them down walk otherwise won't really checked on  Parking also pretty horrendous busy nights may drive around multiple times find spot all   At $16 99 AYCE Korean BBQ place hard value remain KBBQ spot  <EOR> I honestly love love Korean Barbecue  absolute favorite thing do! Tofu hut great place KBBQ  love place  meat great marination little sweet but Americans would love them  meat give frozen  frozen block meat cut them right before give meat frozen when bring you   The salad great little salty but still good  long kimchi salty but good  other sides pretty good well  love love pickled cucumber  And don't know if Asian thing just them but they're very attentive if sense  could careless customers  Every time asked something always give ugh again? face  Asian myself worked lot customers but would never that  They're stingy doesn't want give food  order brisket beef tongue 3 times before them  If busy would understand but no there  just seemed very careless   Food quality wise very good delicious   Customer service wise pretty bad   They charged 18% gratuity only 4 party  another thing  don't mind tipping all really don't  according service provided but service pretty bad   Usually give more then 18% but since want just 18% just let them   If you're looking good food don't care service say it!

This place offers great korean bbq experience fraction price other similar places offer   $16 99 all day few dollars cheaper 10PM why even bother anywhere else?! =P  The food great offered many selections meat    Off top head Chicken pork belly tripe marinated short rib beef tongue brisket even squid   few more remember take picture selections next time    If paid regular price also order steamed egg dish   came piping hot green onions mixed fluffy eggs   Very tasty but let warn again comes really hot!  Prior arrival all meat served many side dishes which included rice seaweed chopchae noodle dish something chopped fish few other things   The standout side dish salad   Im sure but very very good Come early!  place big other places fills fast!  wait long     If storeowners read would definitely recommend considering changing other half room the ala carte section add more tables grills    half room pretty empty save maybe person while line building front door   I should checked place sooner definitely coming again  <EOR> Pretty good price! Honestly coming New York where cheap KBBQ least $30 seeing AYCE KBBQ $17 !!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! insane    Place small but 5 10 Saturday probably wait 10 15 minutes  line didn't unmanageable during time until time left probably around 7 00pm    Recommendations short ribs obvious choice well seasoned marbled good! rib eye steamed egg! Would avoid sliced pork belly pretty salty regular pork belly probably what's more standard  Brisket ok but way much it  <EOR> I really hate mean but think star even more place  service bad  waitress seems never hear pretend rude  volume ur voice yell order served  really many things order menu just few items  Also give big plate meat first order then plate becomes smaller meat less  just stingy parsimony  most frustrating thing doubled charge tips without noticing us!!! behavior bad kind deceiving customers!!!

I only gave place 3 stars because think place just average  they're horrible but they're also breathtakingly awesome know mean? but just satisfy your Korean food craving? it'll do  <EOR> Yeah would say Hut good word describe place  kind small being Korean Barbeque joint    Here's deal  When first come left half restaurant designated AYCE while right half la carte  sure sign your place line  Don't forget include time signed along number your party   I would say room 48 people total whole restaurant  really busy days just might waiting while sit down   The day total 16 party  Surprisingly seated waiting 30 minutes  bad party size   So here's low down if AYCE your option  need minimum two people pick option if going solo then la carte your only option  $16 99 per person any time  $13 99 10 pm 2 am  No take home  Duh!

Oh sure wear shirt don't mind getting scented pork various other meaty aromas   AYCE Korean BBQ  know drill bring plates raw meat cook your very own grill  thin cut meats cook much faster!   The salad pretty good helped myself many seconds    The service mediocre  seemed bit short wait staff practically jump down more meat!   Overall nice experience  <EOR> It's really hard say anything bad place serves piles piles meat  bit wait since killer deal all you can eat K BBQ but pays off end highly affordable good selection    The only thing say service could improved  ask beverage water never refilled whole time there  also left without chopsticks half meal which made things difficult say least  won't keep returning though when hungry budget    Are better places go? Yes but worth money sure  <EOR> Do deceived name  They're called Tofu Hut but much more tofu  Korean Barbecue AYCE table grill place  kalbi short ribs squid pork chicken many different side dishes    We waited 20 minutes table  first good sign  service bit disservicing themselves  need bit better system but say? Chinatown  just kept going back forth thing time takes while things some times thus one star off    They really good soup Mae Won Ton really yummy  Definitely try every single thing item list bring tons friends   best way!  I'll back rally some more friends! <EOR> I obviously made very very poor decision because did choose all eat menu   around 11pm Thursday night 45 60 minute wait since only few tables available bbq   saw some other people eating off menu decided instead   opted stews terrible   Everything tasted just quickly thrown together soup base dumplings  soup base tasted those premade tofu soup packages Asian grocery stores mixed some frozen dumplings also grocery stores   DId ALL   service wasn't bad    pretty attentive   If ever back try bbq instead  <EOR> OK gotta confess best tasting best priced KBBQs probably LA southern California I love BBQ Night Hawaiian Gardens CA    But Vegas might best!  Sura BBQ Buffet but pricey   especially dinner price   Other places Korea Garden BBQ House Chinatown just downright horrible   brother used come often tofu soups years ago always thought Tofu Hut good    But now AYCE Korean BBQ $16 99 really really good   probably A book!

Before BBQ times once strictly sold variety soondubu soft tofu stew   not so spicy all ultra spicy all depends your taste buds  still decently priced  But why spend near ten bucks mediocre soondubu dish if pay few dollars more eat king? <EOR> My cousin decided mark calendars afternoon brunch Korean BBQ  place recommended great recommendation   The place small but nice quaint decor  place very clean well   I'm huge fan Yakiniku places think fan Tofu Hut   From array small Kim Chee dishes nicely cute marinated meats even simple salad very addiction asian vinaigrette gave complete final touch   The waiter always checking table replenish appropriate times never imposing often bother   The price just right place this   Unlike most Korean BBQ buffets food brought table portions much your liking wherein other buffets food meats often exposed mercy dining patrons   #IsThatSanitary?

I think place pretty decent concise solid menu  absolute favorite thing order KBBQ beef tongue course order first  friend savor every slice along whatever else order another  bring even just looking them plate obvious cut much much thinner  picture cooked slice both first second orders post     Now it business  am pretty confident ability devour beef tongue point where question if restaurant money off me  However slicing meat thinner way secure profit! Just order another might say  Well say thinner cut slices scrumptious more hearty slice  Also harder cook darn grill  quickly MELT if aren't gifted swiftness grace grilling ninja  Therefore am sad    Nevertheless did enjoy dinner Tofu Hut regardless sad beef tongue  ordered almost all other meats off menu good  felt service responsive polite almost always waiter nearby if needed anything  would come back but quest find KBBQ place absolutely love continues    <EOR> Food amazing always but service complete shit always too  asian dude working right now learn smile better customer service  Oh more thing don't tip yourself when didn't crap <EOR> Wow quality meat gone beyond edible here  Used come eat lot cheap decent quality meat  Now meat tough no taste but bunch seasonings  Kimchee very bad well  would rather pay couple bucks more better quality meat  worth $16 99 all    grill very dirty   seems grill needs good scrub  won't back again <EOR> We don't korean bbq there's always long line    Since everyone always line korean bbq seated right away menu side    I always order tofu pot beef sometimes dumpling  ask heat level mild cause hot spicy  serve mini dishes before your meal kimchi pickled veggies    The bulgogi spicy chicken really good tender delish   My family going long time now hasn't change! <EOR> HORRIBLE customer service!! Door says open till 2 am REFUSED service 12 40 am  When questioned choice service said wait threatened call police despite fact requesting nicely table  Normally would eat but horrible harassment level customer service shows company doesn't care guests  worked over ten years customer service industry never treated cruelly before  warn anyone wants eat please stay away  <EOR> I restaurant   Spicy Tofu soup amazing haven't able find better town   I always lunch think little pricey service isnt best  <EOR> I miss place much  only lived LV semester before moved back home Reno  am thankful introduced place place where lost KBBQ ginity  Since leaving Vegas many Korean bbq restaurants but none compare Tofu Hut   wish tofu hut convenient everywhere go! miss much delicious sides sauces salad MEATS  Everything place perfect  price?

Best Vegas ! Excellent Service much wait time very affordable   <EOR> I say ever since Tofu Hut reopened service quality food improved lot  servers very nice often rounds around tables ask if want water more meat  used painfully difficult attention servers but almost everything Tofu Hut seems much improved   So admit fan side dishes any KBBQ place mainly just rate meat quality price service  Meat selection pretty standard brisket marinated ribeye pork belly chicken squid lunch price think $12 99  dinner pay $17 99 short rib steamed egg additional choices  KBBQ Vegas  cheapest price know of  meat selection and taste pretty good price good service good  giving 4 stars though because can't help but compare KBBQ LA which same quality $11  But still think Tofu Hut best choice KBBQ Vegas people wanting pay $20+ each  <EOR> Decent price pretty good food  If again I'd stick marinated pork belly short rib rib eye  brisket tongue sliced thin reminded Steak Um  much flavor those 2 cuts   Come usual assortment sides rice salad good but mostly untouched chowed meat instead   Service fine don't really come much asking if need something you'll need flag them down but enough staff wasn't problem  <EOR> This place isn't horrible but definitely pay for  chicken carried gelatinous consistency regardless long cooked  ribeye awesome great flavor every time cooked  There's way better option Maryland parkway Algonquin across street Blue Berry Hill  Much better service environment food  little more expensive but well worth price  <EOR> After night clubs wee hours morning friends decided head Tofu Hut  restaurant small clean welcoming  obviously during happy hour around 3AM Korean bbq never tasted good!!  For $12 99 endless choices meat not including short rib side dishes  very skeptical cooking yourself part since bad experience San Francisco but just yummy! gotta give them 24 hour restaurant food service exceptional! <EOR> The food used pretty descent here   However quality declined prices higher   Service always friendly when there   isn't much banchan side dishes probably wouldn't anything other SoonTofu soups   Still place  supposed specialize  Tofu Soup isn't great should be   plenty better places go  <EOR> I've going over 10 years  Tofu Hut feels home family! All eat cheap delicious  reccomend getting pork belly brisket dipping oil salt pepper sauce give you  night gets crowded but just write your name down should seated few seriously worth wait though! <EOR> This place ok  main draw late night price $13 99 ayce BBQ 10pm  best Korean BBQ place Vegas? opinion  But good enough come back again late night price  however find service spotty sometimes bit unfriendly  <EOR> My recommendation ribs coffee  I would love work tofu hut  chefs easy here  leave cook your own food  think  cool concept allows cook your meat rare well done want    The brisket fatty  felt chewing bubble gum but ribs delicious  also vending machine gave 4 oz  coffee 50 cents  don't even coffee but priority milk coffee everytime come here   The sides pretty good  gave large variety choose from  liked tofu dish served best    The customer service bare minumum  lady came around every once awhile refill water cups but it  She didn't even talk or smile while she did it  very robotic like   The food very good but better  why feel three star rating appropriate  <EOR> I love Tofu Hut late night special  both AYCE Korean BBQ regular entree items  However number tables Korean BBQ limited there's usually 15min 1 hour wait  meat selection good but limited 100% chance smell afterwards  <EOR> Only $16 dinner time  lot menu but servings stomach full! Satisfying  rather korean garden  Better price bigger better meat   The only thing disliked service  barely pay attention you  Greeting welcoming weak  party 3 waiting line first list then 2 korean guys just walked stole seats   made complaint host didn't anything chewed them myself  Told them off table wait everyone else is  People waiting pretty upset too  always scout them ask refills always forget straws  Other food good  <EOR> I can't believe took long write review  Even though more kbbq places now Tofu hut always special place heart  5 years ago Tofu hut first Korean BBQ experience Las Vegas    It does busy long wait  Especially if big party  service ok  depends busy but try meat quick  remember gentleman worked every time came he remembered order  He doesn't work anymore though  10pm price amazing affordable  But gets super busy around time well    The meats ok  normally beef tongue brisket short ribs pork belly squid  lot which nice because don't keep ordering  salad AMAZING! favorite all kbbq places ate at! really best one  also offer Korean pancake side  recommend warming little bit grill little firmer  also give everyone steam egg bean paste soup unlike other places  Which nice because don't share  <EOR> My favorite AYCE korean bbq place but prepared wait 1 hour before sit down actually eat if come during lunch dinner hours  Good food long wait though  <EOR> This used Korean food    The last time stopped must least year so  service good used be  AYCE line long per usual  walked front wave someone down because regular menu  Everyone ignored probably thinking just impatient AYCE customer    I ordered usual spicy shredded beef soup  could hardly wait anticipating strong flavors spices made grow love dish  Unfortunately mouth tasted watery strange tasting soup  Something different    cabbage?!

Its pretty hard bad tofu soup mean most time general tofu palces just average good but bad its something tolerate  but man place worst EVER mess tofu soup? called Tofu HUT?!!?!?  I stumbled across place because usual resturant Mr Tofu closed already really mood tofu notice accorss street Tofu Hut  thought hey perfect! MISTAKE!!!

Yes know tough finding stellar AYCE Korean BBQ Las Vegas especially all visitors Cali for nia   But Tofu Hut twice within month some reason even other AYCE Korean BBQ joint right down street which shall remain nameless but we'll call SUUURRRAAA must telling something   At Tofu Hut price $16 99 AYCE all day long?  Hard pricing   But $13 99 AYCE late night special?  Even harder   Try finding table 11 PM HA better chance getting tickets San Diego Comic Con!  line ridiculous!  Mainly because Tofu Hut only 12 tables available AYCE since other half restaurant menu offerings exclusively   Yes know sometimes quality Korean meats consistent   time decent next time lackluster   First time quality suspect but last couple times meats actually better OK   each own   But kalbi short ribs damn tasty!  Just wish would include bones suck cartilage around them HEAVEN!  also good your joints way   Yes know LIMIT only 4 meats sometimes 3 per table any time   Just order your meats done it   No sense arguing   Just cook your first order meats eat BBQ drink soju merry sing along some Big Bang Girls Generation THEN order another 4 plates meat   Steamed Egg while you're because delicious   Yes know banchan may seem small selection compared other Korean BBQ places   But know what?  aren't bad all   all your basics kim chee seaweed bean sprouts couple others too   Just politely ask extra TWO orders kim chee   Wife hates but tummy loves me   Don't forget large bowl salad!  Good stuff   Lastly yes know service Tofu Hut strenuous times   Just remember you're Chinatown   almost NO nice!  saying racist myself am eighth Chinese!  yes employees Tofu Hut come off bit rude uncaring   expecting turn down service French maid? Hmm   I'm sensing some role playing near future  guys must tired running back forth unlimited amounts carcass rice devouring!  imagine   these folks around fermented Korean veggies ALL   DAY   LONG    bound anyone bit stinky attitude   Plus they're surrounded smoke HOT @$$ grills entire shift   ever scrub those cast iron grills burnt meat caramelized Korean marinade?  ready tennis elbow   Believe when tell you   if you're never food service industry just don't know   if don't know   well now know   IT   IS   TOUGH   UNGODLY even   while hate bad service realize someone did take job being server dishwasher   I know ain't easy keeping smiley face all day   Luckily recent visits only borderline rude almost pleasant even!

Very limited seating but price! choice 10 items pork belly brisket etc choice continuously until can't eat anymore! side salad well delicious  interior could use renovation would improve overall experience   But when comes down food good deal! <EOR> horrible service line 20minutes long even though open tables  made switch seats just because can't just order meat  said you're allowed order just plate meat which no sense  <EOR> LOVE veggie tofu soup  always order spicy ones  price reasonable  <EOR> Loved it!!! Must try especially if your visiting  prices cheap worth it  All eat 16 99$  ordered brisket short ribs soysauce chicken ribeye  Enjoyed all little sides well  Coming Hawaii desperate need rice definitely happy that  <EOR> Their tofu soups 5 stars order seafood seafood beef   Everything else very average kalbi Korean BBQ beef short ribs yuck   Almost seems going bad   Go tofu soup you're A OK but anything else your call  <EOR> Korean bbq good excited try place all good reviews  restaurant pretty small grills each table    The staff wasn't very excited help friends I  quiet night could little more excited people  never came refill drinks refill meat sides  All eat yeah right!

Side note compared other kbbq best salad good random cravings it  Just other good places expect wait during peek hours but totally worth it  also huge lot always find parking  <EOR> I don't understand place rated best Vegas  completely mediocre  place incredibly small wait horrendously long     I saw Yelp reviews AYCE prices similar ones Los Angeles why hell not?  Boy around 7pm weren't seated till little 8pm    A side note annoying when people show give X amount people but then change amount people last minute causing everyone else wait even more workers readjust waiting list    The food mediocre best   My steamed egg tasted egg shells it  happened twice! spit out  Ugh favorite dishes cool   The marinated ribeye best followed spicy pork belly    I wouldn't back  <EOR> Finally actually eat!

From past visits place customer service always 50 50  Some days they'll point need asap some days they'll just hang cash register even busy night   <EOR> I've eating much lately  Way much  when text invite Tofu Hut AYCE 11 30pm?  It first time there  really didn't know it  $13 99 place kills $26 table grilled item ordered Pho 1 just few nights ago  Then again you're probably supposed share one   $13 99 choose everything but last two items short ribs steamed egg those available $16 99 AYCE price but happy sticking $13 99   We started Sliced Ribeye Brisket Beef Tongue  ribeye most flavorful but soft spot beef tongue nay freakin' heart beef tongue! brisket OK  liked ribeye much ordered another plate  also added Tripe Honeycomb mix  love tripe too  nice spice charring grill added nice flavor   On final round Squid Marinated Pork Belly  squid OK but lot flavor  pork belly good spice well steamed rice left I wasn't eating much point   Speaking steamed rice bring plethora side dishes meats Kimchi Pickled Cucumber Pickled Radish other stuff can't name  Everything hit table delicious   Oh yeah  friend wanted order OB but settled Hite  bad beer but nothing memorable   Overall give them four stars  Granted first time any place does style AYCE but fully enjoyed it  fun time some photographer friends hadn't seen while  Jason put best when he said don't know if needed giant meat fest but sure enjoyed it   she said?

Lastly sides also very good  sometimes serve glass noodles potato salad which favorite   only place town gracious side dishes give decent amount even if person   If ignore service concentrate food quality I'd definitely pick Tofu Hut any day  <EOR> I wanted take friend mine experience some Korean BBQ my fav! just show first choice AYCE closed course pulled phone yelp app  meat pulled very fresh calamari looked just plain weird meat fatty when finished cooking bacon  waiter took FOREVER bring check  Only reason second star because open late  Only reason would back really late night nothing open need fix Korean food  <EOR> Definitely worth your money! all eat serve lot meat portion  If love Korean bbq place must! <EOR> Hello All    tofu hut around 2 pm    slow    asked all eat bbq    But said its 2 people minimum lol   never coming back here <EOR> If hungry very hungry recommend elsewhere  However if hungry does mind waiting LONG LONG TIME service then right ahead just might restaurant you   Service overall absolutely terrible  restaurant stingy don't give appetizer dishes until your main course completely finished cooking all other Korean restaurants give appetizers first thing right you've ordered food  Also if just dine going bbq wait longer because serve people bbq first then maybe come you    Food so so  would another Korean restaurant if many them Spring Mountain Road China Town why come receive such bad service?! <EOR> **Summary** Korean BBQ review Korean BBQ part Tofu Hut where cook your own meats eat them  Minimum 2 AYCE least 2 people getting it  Quality quality fluctuates  When good great  When small pieces look less fresh  However never gotten sick yet cross fingers   Price They're quite bit cheaper your average Korean BBQ place  **Price** $13 99 AYCE Lunch Short ribs Steamed Egg excluded $16 99 AYCE Dinner **Ordered** Marinated Sliced Rib eye Brisket Beef Tongue Short Ribs Steamed Egg **Notes** Korean salad side dishes provided beginning meal  rib eye short ribs come marinated  They're quite flavorful but eat them alongside un marinated meat  brisket beef tongue un marinated usually dip them sesame oil salt concoction  If tastes plain didn't put enough salt ask more  steamed egg Korean salad side dishes nice non meat compliment rest food  Sometimes heat grill leans side table  If you're other person then both move side  If more someone's just screwed  **Recommendations** I'd recommend place if you're looking cheap Korean BBQ place feel rolling dice  quality fluctuates gamble  best better other Korean BBQ places  <EOR> Tofu Hut    love hate relationship   Service AWESOME most time but sometimes feel forgot there   Meat quality isnt best but its price cant really ask more   We always AYCE  Just brisket pork belly  because everything else meh     and dont even talk squid   i thought going seasoned   its not   they throw plate just give you   really?     wow   lol  idk why alway6s end but said   its love hate realtinshui[ lol <EOR> As late night options Korean near work Tofu Hut shabby option  favorite soon dubu?

Look no further Tofu hut  place kbbq group friends I   16 99 opening till 10pm 13 99 10pm 3am   The food bad meat depending which choose usually frozen unless marinated  marinade use good but any marinated kbbq causes grill toast over  meat fresh yummy when really late  Finally sides come food good    The service hit miss  Some days really good others bit lackluster  understandable people good days bad days  very quick taking your order brining your order out   Overall bad place grab some late night kbbq know find work some late night munchies  <EOR> I've tofu hut quite few times now    going tell best kbbq town   But tell great value     Maybe don't best cuts meat maybe selection small maybe banchan isn't great but under $17 all eat place certainly satisfies craving Korean barbeque      I would suggest kalbi steamed egg   Almost always delicious even if sometimes miss  <EOR> One best kbbq places bc its cheap pricing only 10pm   personally love brisket beef tongue pork belly squid salad  The salad compared other kbbq places amazing dressing! assuming sesame oil based dressing its delish! brisket more fatty side but fat always equals more flavor  Everything else pretty much same other kbbq places   Customer service ok  Depending servers  coming year now would say least once month  They've improving customer service  Especially guy server! He's really nice  wish would check lot more refill your water without asking   Overall food pricing customer service  Also prepared wait if you're coming late night special  totally though! far tofu hut #1 kbbq  <EOR> How written review place yet?  I'm least once week  When pair good food even better prices am even more?!  The AYCE KBBQ prices both lunch dinner rest  mean $13 99 between 10 00pm closing then $16 99 any other time  can't compete that    You  Just  Can't   Their appetizers prepare your mouth glorious meat you'll eat  favorite Korean pancake tofu  house salad also amazing  contemplated endless times see if could pick order just salad alone   As meats favorite would good o'fashion pork belly  brisket follows then maybe marinated pork belly  If you're extremely hungry ahead order steamed egg  perfect combo rice   The only reason why place 1 star away perfect 5 size  really wish bigger! Half restaurant divided long gruesome wait if come wrong time  <EOR> Had random k bbq craving other day decided try tofu hut  place Korean food but first time w $16 99 ayce    Started rocky half empty but stood waiting seated felt forever while frazzled server busser both ignored us  few other service issues follow but sadly authentic Asian places aren't known great service  is    Anyway food great decent selection banchan the sides surprisingly delish salad romaine cabbage mixed w light dressing think kochujung sauce  ordered bulgogi kalbi short ribs spicy chicken spicy pork  meat quality marinade really good but fan marinade pork chicken  Both lacked flavor pork really excessive fat gristle    Although included ayce order fried mandoo which seemed homemade pretty generous portion  Also spicy tofu soup which arrived boiling hot yummy  Tried steamed egg which incorrectly described kind custard  more really fluffy omelette seemed scrambled raw egg poured onto little bit boiling broth w green onion  Surprisingly good must try   Service mediocre just 1 poor guy running around busser girl spoke no English she just stared although pretty sure coke still coke Spanish too  Things better once cooks came help wait tables he actually awesome server  I'd suggest ordering everything once while attention pretty aggressive flagging them down    Sounds pretty bad experience but probably fav ayce k bbq places over sura woo che  Quality seemed better good selection ban chan  main negative compared others they're good changing grill charred bits stuck but probably would if ask  all k bbq places just prepared smell Korean food rest night  <EOR> All eat $16 99 per person  Wow lot food!
