Rude serious attitude adjustment needed   am normally condescending rude waitstaff any place but once every often person comes along just want to     want to     UGH   Given fact am Korean myself  when  run into people Korean establishment hatred intensified   Considering fact many patrons frequent Kimchi Korean would hope owners would take more care ensure waitstaff par any other good Vegas establishment   Anyhow aside woman Kimchi pretty decent Korean restaurant open all night long think can't beat   Just keep mind  if 4 AM did Sunday morning ask guy server tell woman Grace said keep least 10 feet away your table all times 20 feet away food   Banchan decent plentiful     meat good  Al Jjigae  Yook Gae Jang also quite good      I would give four stars but being awfully generous take off only star wench  <EOR> This place used great but gotten worse everytime visit it  effort compete price sacrificed quality  Especially noticed shoe leather texture briscuit fattiness bulgogie  no longer serve side dishes  Instead replaced salad bar  <EOR> My family loved place during trip Vegas  Instead BBQ separate entrees all tasty!!! buffet style side dishes awesome well  Every item super delicious  service kind fast  If visit Vegas again definitely back Kimchi restaurant  <EOR> We actually way Orchard Buffet lunch when passed place located plaza across Walgreen's   Orchard Buffet Korean BBQ?  course when you're hungry you'd want all eat Korean BBQ!

Yes please! Shabu shabu? Yep yep!  I love Korean BBQ  I'd eat once week minimum if could afford it  Little spendy * nice restaurant  great place take date romantic evening but also comfortable enough could just walk big morning Home Depot jeans T no would bat eye   The food service excellent  just feel those beautiful ribbons beef sweetly marinated melting mouth  if you're vegetarian fear  side spread bring more enough fill your belly if you're dining carnivorous friends    We very good friend Japan Mr Matsui  He proclaims himself master chef he bananas while young lady tried help prepare meats  No no no! Thank you! he stopped then sent away demand More garlic! More garlic please! quite amusing luckily girl just laughed it  Wouldn't quite funny if he'd made feel bad   I digress  food's excellent service fantastic  highly recommend BBQ  little costly for but Kimchi definitely getting pay for   * Spendy must West Coast thing  never ever heard life back Midwest  did hear weird though  Wisconsin they're fond using borrow inappropriately  Example Hey Linds borrow book when you're done? *shudders* <EOR> Avoid place    came friend late night sat down  Looked AYCE all eat menu $34 99 $35 99 per person! left before ordering as did bad mouthed Korean ladies Korean    can't say quality food    This place complete ghost town only customers way! alone tells place isn't all great   I moved Vegas long ago Los Angeles complete rip off! good LA Korean BBQ AYCE charges $14 99 $19 99 for premium meats   understand place open 24 7 located right strip right past WYNN Las Vegas Blvd    The prices charge screams Tourist Trap   I would never come take friends here  many better ones fairly priced Spring Mountain china town area  <EOR> I heard place really good  course upon arriving prepared order many things  But little discouraged prices  place pretty expensive  lot dishes around $20 up  all eat deal $27 $37 depending kind meats want  But since group just ordered bibimbap Mandu soup cold spicy noodle  Overall really good  flavors point  But thing didn't wait time food arrive  while waited bunch sides unlimited side bar  sides reeeeaaallly good  <EOR> I regret eating restaurant! food ok service bad price expensive! 15% tip also enforced bill although just self husband  place joke! <EOR> Excellent everything eat bbq  good place when want eat meat  almost try all meat menu <EOR> We party 4 first time eat korean bbq tried least dozen Korean bbq east coast west coast   Anyway waitress she nice side dishes typical other korean bbq  non marinated meats good picked $29 99 buffet 9 kind meats but didn't know only 1 type marinated bad thing meat wasn't marinated correctly just sugar even enough soy sauce dash sesame oil tasted nothing korean bbq disappointed dipping sauce worth it  won't come back unless if u plan eat others instead buffet  <EOR> I come place where AYCE Korean BBQ essential life know damn good Korean BBQ deals when see one   Kimchi Korean BBQ end strip near circus circus plaza looks hooker's front yard  came low expectations food since   pfft its Vegas hell thinks KBBQ gonna good Cali? ahjumas old ladies really shove meat everywhere! Damn! small AYCE list which believe around   $22 cheap AYCE but seriously think  enough meat us  PLETHORA choices  NO JOKE  pick your own side dishes side dish bar although wished more options   any other side dishes you'd ask   Although cucumber kimchi Oi sobaegi wasn't there   asked lady   she said we're sorry don't any  shit not  5 minutes later she comes big plate it  guess either    just made secretly hiding me   These ladies also REALLY cook your meat  They'll stand cook cut dispense meat you  hell yea   These ladies lovely  I'd definitely come back if Vegas again  Hell   freaking catch gout something just eat here! <EOR> I would come turnip soup bar  Other wise expect typical Korean faires here  Nothing special  <EOR> Kimchi Korean BBQ all eat amazing!!!!!  The meat fresh setting restaurant clean comfortable  don't feel greasy smell BBQ when finish which important because while Vegas wants smell meat?!  The all eat BBQ only 22    and includes everything  waitress nice enough combination meats instead just one  side dishes soup salad fruits fresh delicious too   Our waitress also helped cooked meat perfect timing! Soda kind expensive but rest Vegas which $2 50 per can  Overall I'd again sure! <EOR> 24 hour Korean restaurant next Encore  think 10 times all I'd say all eat best deal  Everything else menu average best  bbq entrees aren't good enough order alacarte  Service pretty inconsistent   Understaffed rarely checked on  Side dishes self serve buffet style which kinda annoying but least pick want  <EOR> It's actual Korean restaurant strip   Pricing good   However its bit lazy   example banchan served via all eat bar     all well fine but doesn't really give Korean experience   ordered Soon Tofu which didn't come bubbling would liked   Service okay  <EOR> If want  authentic Korean food don't there  The side dishes entree bland sweet  guess being strip must decided food sweet appeal non Koreans especially Japanese   only logical conclusion think because Korean food should sweet  The kimchee hot stone pot rice came warm kimchee juice still bottom  told them take back  came back 10 min  Later  Still right warm it should sizzling  soy bean den Jang chee gae sweet well bland  called manager but waitress never called me  complained worst Korean food long time   am visiting los angeles which best Korean restaurants outside Korea  think know am talking about  It's sad because super bowl Sunday  bad  must change cooking concept since attract non Koreans  If alone would cancelled order walked out   Trust stay away unless your food bland sweet   There better Korean restaurant  think Ginsang south side strip better  Korean restaurant strip pass Stratosphere better  Korean restaurant old shopping center Sahara north strip better  <EOR> The last two times Vegas come AYCE KBBQ  came across place because friends just left XS en route peppermill breakfast foods corner eye saw bright sign said 24hr AYCE BBQ  Needless say     flipped U pulled into parking lot some grub   I am probably best judge place because both times visited under influences alcoholic beverages  However say confidence meal alright  4am AYCE KBBQ definately hit spot    On both visits pretty much order same typical meat selection  say did dressing salad served however steam eggs hit miss  first time eggs perfect fluffy second time overcooked say least    This best KBBQ ever honest doesnt come close best but midnight post party eating say its pretty good    The 2 things turned off follows A friend asked split tab two credit cards host split charges but used card twice  basically card changed entire meal  big deal because friend just gave cash but kind annoying    asked host call cab which turned friend family member owner place  driver tried overcharge ride back hotel when objected he gave more reasonable price  did he think were?? Vegas Newbs??? Sorry mister    its does cost more $20 bucks drive few blocks Vegas  <EOR> I remember going Kimuch liked food years ago   brought bunch Fashion Friends during MAGIC Las Vegas Fashion tradeshow    When first entered restaurant good feeling place since 90% customers Korean Japanese   I ordered bunch BBQ item Bulgogi marinaded sliced beef Ross Gui sliced beef without marinade Hya Mit Gui sliced beef tongue table  All meat tasted tender fresh   really liked Hya Mit Qui   very tender flavorful   sesame oil accompanied dish very good quality  All BBQ dishes came Man Doo meat dumplings Naengmyeon cold noodles    didn't neither dishes   noodles tasted soggy without texture Man Doo flavorful      My vegetarian friend ordered Jab Chae fried clear thread noodle vegetables Bibimba vegetables fried egg rice without meat   She really enjoyed both dishes   I happy see OB beer which very well Korean BBQ   They also private room seat 15 25 people   don't think Kimuchi best Korean food nor decor but defanatly great time having networking business dinners shi shi Koi Tao kind restaurants every night  <EOR> I discovered place almost 10 years ago accident list every time Vegas  I'm Korean BBQ aficionado any means can't speak authenticity food  But everyone taken over years sometimes unwillingly scared left completely satisfied surprised much liked it  Everything super tasty staff great guiding through dishes people typically order   A good beginners menu two people would meat order bulgogi   soup order tofu seafood beef   Add more if needed  There's also all eat option  But never done that  They'll even help cook your food your grill if you're completely lost  There's also large sides bar which believe complimentary  many great choices might start full before your meat cooked  spicy cucumber slices favorite  And course Kimchi  Delicious  Smooth crunchy just right amount sour  I might also add located small shopping center  very easy park  <EOR> The place any other korean restaurants southern california area  meat good well side dishes  liked glass noodles but didn't come buffet order separately  Only few customers where eating weekend probably because its location  <EOR> My favorite place Las Vegas Korean food unlimited side dishes great noodle dish Naengmyeon favorite very friendly service other dishes without meat if vegetarian me <EOR> I've 4 times over years food service good   But 1 1 took 45 minutes order come out   always Yuk Kae Jung which very consistent   time friend Kimchi Chi Gae Dwae Je Pu Gogi which couldn't figure suppose be  <EOR> 24 hr AYCE came around 11 30 pm Thursday night  Nothing super special place  wasn't super special but there's bad thing could really say place either  Meats good bulgogi marinade actually sweeter used to  bad taste but good  Just didn't wow  all  What's cool though buffet sides help yourself more sides wish bug waitress more everytime  Customer service fine waitress attentive us  never before may come back again  But trying different KBBQ places  <EOR> 24 hour Korean bbq   could better that?    oh    dunno   one actually cooks good food?
