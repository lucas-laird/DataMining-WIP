Armando blamed kitchen guess don't fire entrees separately appetizers  Some restaurants fire appetizers then check table's progress before firing entrees  recommendation busy day Yard House would place your appetizer order wait 15 minutes then order your entree   We sixth person join food arrived drink arrived just time all done eating  Overall experience nothing special  generally order appetizers reason offset hunger pace food enjoy company your experience meal   Outside service complaints Chicken Tortilla Soup very good  creamy white cheddar flavor slices avocado tortilla strips addition nice portion chicken  bowl soup large generous portion could easily appetizer    The entree portion Chopped Salad w salmon fresh looking generously portioned  comes typical tomatoes bacon avocados addition corn cucumbers celery onion cilantro   For dessert decided try Mini Peach Apple Cobbler S'Mores Brownie  All three bits crust topped cobbler delicious  S'Mores brownie required topping ice cream ordered afterward because dry eat  <EOR> Service slow   Food okay price    favorite probably won't back really long time  <EOR> You can't really wrong Yard house  food amazing service usually good    This particular visit during happy hour buzzing people  Good vibes good food  = happiness   My friends ordered received orders within 5 minutes  servers extremely nice observant drinks plates    I don't think could've asked better experience  <EOR> The service great drinks delicious   wasn't fan food   Maybe ordered wrong thing something but better   price paid don't think worth it   see paid service which amazing   Thank Derrick D <EOR> They such great food selection  Reasonable portions    say endless options alcohol    My favorites poke nachos ahi tuna sashimi lobster garlic noodles which die for    It could crowded n noisy times  But great watching games  <EOR> I miso sea bass  dish alright  bass cooked well but rice cooked well enough  rice crunch it  Being someone loves rice bothers me  really enjoy soft rice dishes  does add texture does prevent dish getting soggy but needs happy medium  bok choy cooked well roasted  delicious  admit miso sauce rice pretty salty  complimented lightness bass   I also taste pan seared ahi tuna  interesting one  ahi cooked perfection but bean sauce exxxxxtremely salty  Unfortunately individual came same conclusion  say fish cooked perfection fresh   Environment extremely loud packed  Personally cup tea  food worth though  <EOR> When come happy options raw fish  huge sushi fan always craving __ because healthiest dining options there    I gave yard house 3 stars rating food items   Everytime come food OK  looks appealing but feel really lacks flavor any excitement  spicy tuna roll which nontraditional roll  avocados edamame spicy tuna between  sure looks sounds good but flavor MEH  also tried ahi sliders just weren't good    See yourself    3 stars because beer selection obviously fun but other I'd honestly some place else carb cup fill least some decent food complement it  <EOR> There 25 30 minute wait Friday night  wasn't bad but took over hour appetizer   that's ridiculous  waiter kept telling appetizer would any minute he even said aren't busy! Anyway chicken fingers appetizer BBQ bacon cheeseburger truffle fries  fries absolutely delicious! BBQ sauce burger very sweet  think waiter said maple BBQ sauce    The food pretty good but restaurant kinda loud  Overall good choice Town Square but wouldn't way eat there  <EOR> Okay few things going brought almost guaranteed manager comment but whatever happening   Went last night try Gardein line here  very excited see vegan meats added some dishes  cool that?? But upon doing some internet research before ordered found due cooking methods ALL dishes wouldn't vegan vegetarian  cook everything same grill meat  sense does make? None  having black coat putting bleach all over doesn't resemble black coat anymore tainted  If mix vegan food meat point?   And comes why 2 star  STANDARD PROCEDURE VEG*N MENU COOKED SEPARATE PAN  your way ask even then manager comes explain going taste same if grill  Hmm really think vegan WANTS dead cow mixed food? HELL NO  Granted Yardhouse already taken *some* action put little dot next few items absolutely come contact meat since items fried same basket everything else  But haven't specified ALL menu items come contact animal products which okay  would really helpful if people come know right off bat  If hadn't phone night literally would gotten sick since haven't any sort meat 6 years    Here's would suggest just other companies before Chipotle comes mind please automatically all vegetarian Gardein items cooked separately meat  don't want lawsuit la McDonald's  ridiculous vegan meats come then cross contaminate them animal sources them even vegetarian  Oh isn't just Yardhouse all them trust contacting your corporate offices today  Also would nice if could put little V next items could made vegan vegan menu  ordering easier confusion your staff minimal   Anyways ordered veggie sliders come fries also ordered side sweet potato fries  Matt ordered thai chicken pizza  some back forth sliders couldn't even bread only wheat bread vegan them protein style wrapped lettuce  sweet potato fries appetizer severely lackluster  Very bland no taste no toppings sugar anything  couldn't sauce since contained bacon guess  where all flavor is  aforementioned back forth wait staff food  seriously only meat bun in case lettuce sliders? NOTHING else? No tomato onion even ketchup mustard? serious? taste Gardein patty wonderful but almost $11 plain patties ridiculous  fries way better sweet potato ones but just wasn't worth price  wish would suggested order veggie burger since  essentially did anyways cut patty into four pieces pass them off sliders  least then could wheat bun toppings    It very difficult throughout night try signal waitress  know very busy did ask lot questions such but she expert ninja  best customer service world  also unfortunately don't see Gardein line lasting Yardhouse  Until cooking items separately becomes standard procedure see lot vexed veg*ns  Honestly point having vegan meats if they're going end same grill actual meats? just don't logic  Yardhouse itself bit pricey understand but least give customer most can  Plain sliders okay  fact don't think anywhere completely bare sliders    Due lackluster food outrageous price tag lack good customer service Yardhouse really deserves 1 star review but still love chain decided put vegan faux meats menu  intent but execution awful but easily improved upon  might back since other items looked appetizing but only when want deal headaches hassle  Until then stock Gardein Whole Foods own delights home  <EOR> We've going Yard House long time  Father's day took 35 minutes food which cold server didn't seem care he cleaned tables around us   I work service industry understand busy but food sitting window long enough change color   It last time eat any Yard House same service issues Red Rock location  <EOR> Food really good chicken nachos first time   wow certainly dish sharing few people   huge portion!

I can't claim best every vegetarian  Some people strong faux meat experience others want opposite  anything traditional burger texture some kind spicy flavour lot umami fullness  got  potato bun  Fresh but very squishy  may try wheat bun next time   But before we'd already charmed appetizers  Onion Ring Tower tall its name implies kept luring fingers back  rings crispy but greasy dust Parmesan over all   Throught meal lemonades kept coming each free refill ring sugar around rim  Okay  *definitely* putting Yard House short list sure things   And open until 2 a m ? this? full menu until 2 a m ? entire page Gardein vegetarian items wings sliders thai pizza sandwiches plus everything else near novella menu available most restaurants pack night? half priced pizzas appetizers only during regular happy hour but also 10 p m  Sunday Wednesday ? Squeal! <EOR> Food decent Customer service poor  large take order today  When trying pick order employee introduced himself Conductor restaurant told he busy help Togo orders  First all should looked order probably spent more most people sitting down your lunch specials  Am second class because order Togo   would suggest trying different location if want experience yard house  <EOR> For reasons unknown son likes come when Town Square each time gone haven't really left thinking anything spectacular    Service hit miss mostly miss food good but nothing really YELP about  Till last visit     We dined last Friday night server Brandi awesome! She friendly attentive suggested some good stuff made laugh  She touched table just enough times feel didn't search someone if needed something    As food tried street tacos  Korean short rib taco chicken   really really good! also tried poke stack delicious!

To date biggest Yard House stepped into tell during happy hour pack quite big punch sure  The location itself massive tables everywhere inside which made very quick wait time imagine!  Foodwise decided black truffle cheeseburger some local inside dinner mates truffle fries  The burger itself pretty filling certainly know prepare medium rare burger when requested a pet peeve   The patty juicy showstopper truffle sauce accompanying burger actually truffle fries heavily salted am used here  It turned around view maybe more Yard House then just Yards?  A low point waitress just having quite Vegas night Scrooge year round  Initially she threw coasters down table ordered drinks continued slam down random items through meal ketchup food etc but did seem try cliche schmoozing when came time delivery bill  That bit disappointing did all blank staring each other if really just witnessed but did rule meal end!  The overall atmosphere seemed quite calm cool relaxing  It did share loud tables but must lemonade when given lemons <EOR> This teh townsquare loc The food quality superb better expected never having yardhouse before Loved huge draft selection did imbibe alot various styles beer Truly enjoyable  Bride both enjoyed food apps entrees service excellent even though became quite busy We unknowlingly entered happy hour perhaps ordered more libations apps would normally would but just landed few hours earlier glad try something new overall superb def return <EOR> I absolutely love Yard House's happy hour!!!

hosts nice fast server super cool made feel comfortable  would recommend anybody come here  <EOR> Great food huge draft beer selection  Don't house beers just mediocre many excellent other beers order  My big problem place though beer pricing  If come during happy hour fine prices clearly stated menu  actually during happy hour beers priced fairly really cheap but fair happy hour appetizers great deals delicious   But if come outside happy hour no prices listed beers  hundreds beers all priced differently  Asking waiter brings vague response The most expensive $8 50 most them less that  But ain't much less! easy spend $7 pint without realizing it  So   insist waiter give price each beer before order  better plan come only during happy hour  <EOR> Yard House perfect place lunch dinner watching  movie  twice but last visit when actually tried food   Every time visit always crowded especially nights when there's football game which reason why friends waited over 15 minutes but wasn't problem   Yard House huge menu begins several pages dedicated beers other alcoholic beverages  good selection foods order  particularly liked section where sub dishes containing meat soy   FOOD  + Baja Fish Two fried fish tacos topped shredded cabbage pico de gallo guacamole sriracha ailoi  also comes side beans rice but opted steamed vegetables instead  tacos good little spice them   didn't enjoy flour tortillas  prefer corn over flour any day when comes fish tacos  also didn't small tacos though learned order more two receive however any extras cost additional $5  glad inquired since waiter didn't mention when asking questions ordering additional tacos    Originally wanted just beans no rice but waiter said counts side  asked if reason why considered side because beans rice mixed together  He said no just restaurant's policy  He also said he could ask kitchen if he said correct but he wasn't hurry just stood waiting order said would cool if he'd ask  ok then forget it!   chose steamed veggies instead over stir fry option  steamed vegetables but veggies received watery disgusting    + Chicken Nachos generous friend offered share humongous plate Chicken Nachos since two little fish tacos consumed didn't satiate me  nachos topped chunks chicken guacamole cheese sour cream beans onions  nachos tasted better tacos but disliked fat skin left chunks chicken  cool   SERVICE No problem servers hostess but displeased waiter   + understand place packed when visited but waiter didn't come table until 10 minutes seated  ordered beverages took  five minutes return drinks    + When finished food plate empty utensils down sitting eating indicates am finished eating he came table three times looked table said nothing then walked away  When he returned fourth time he asked if done eating which replied yes then finally took plate away   + He called friend bro when SHE asked another glass beer  guess side ponytail makeup magenta pants really screams bro    + previously mentioned he didn't bother returning kitchen inquire question beans rice came tacos he also tried buy more tacos without explaining charged extra  understand  implied additional food costs more but should also mentioned because  just good honest customer service    OVERALL  I see myself making another visit Yard House but skip fish tacos mediocre service which hope won't experience again  <EOR> The service great considering busy hence 1 star give place  food 0 stars  Other would given place no stars  ordered angel hair pasta bf ordered dip side sweet potato fries friend ordered grilled chicken sandwhich broccoli  When all orders came tried fries cold  mentioned boyfriend when he touched sandwhich also cold  thought bit weird but when friend took bite if sandwhich he said chicken also cold  thinking maybe because sandwhich wouldn't warm even though bf ordered roast beef dip  took bite pasta pasta dry bland COLD  seemed left long time because pasta kind stale  far worst meal eaten  No party enjoyed cold food  food over priced serve cold food  did notice yesterday night because sitting front kitchen food coming fast but food standing forever  saw 4 dishes waiting picked roughly 10 min  No wonder food getting cold!

If love healthy salad die <EOR> While Yardhouse basically restaurant adults also really great families   I'm huge fan Yardhouse even though chain locations all over west really great food probably best on tap beer selection seen any restaurant   As food tried all kinds dishes never disappointed  favorites garlic lobster noodles surf turf burger a hamburger asparagus lobster bernaise sauce Spicy Tuna Roll which may best appetizer type restaurant Las Vegas  basically deconstructed spicy tuna roll looks birthday cake layers endamame cucumber tuna avocado  awesome even kids snacking endamame before entrees arrive   The beer selection immense used perfect but take points off because recently removed Tetley's one favorite beers   But honestly? Any place both obscure Belgian ales Pabst Blue Ribbon draft can't bad   As kids menu you'd expect but all food just little better quality normally similar restaurant  fact mac cheese good I'm pretty sure there's some truffle oil your kids might it  Though you'll probably enjoy next day lunch   I can't vouch service other Yard Houses but service Vegas always outstanding  very few instances where problem they've taken money off bill rectified situation immediately   I can't say enough good things restaurant if find yourself shopping Town Square need quick place lunch really best  <EOR> Working near town square would always coworkers atleast 2 3 times week  past week hair pizza server audacity tell  funny there's no girl cooks back Then he asked if wanted another  Because little incident no longer ever again  hair baked inside pizza happy hour pizza trust wasn't trying free  ate slice well  extremely disappointed no manager came say sorry  coworker paid bill left  left two stars because great experiences before but time sealed deal coming back  <EOR> OMG   Why didn't know place!  1000 beers tap!

Anyways ended asking manager 30 minutes later because food taking over 30 minutes   He very polite made situation right food everything AWESOME   good start but things happen big deal  Definitely appreciated manager didn't catch name but everyone food all excellent   Highly recommend   <EOR> Normally love going Yard House would just stock appetizers but time decided order entree just try it   I ordered SEARED SEA SCALLOPS which comes description orzo pasta wild mushrooms white truffle sun dried tomato sauce    Sounded great but disappointment when arrived   First off given 4 scallops   Two which must bay scallops two which must larger sea scallops   first thing noticed received 4 scallops which all same size but seems cooked same amount time   Any seared scallop eaten perfectly seared scallop knows want middle still slightly translucent   two smaller scallops completely white over cooked   sear side much sear other side enough   two larger scallops closer perfect sear   However scallop falling apart bad prep almost white side receiving no sear all   For orzo pasta description indicated wild mushrooms   am huge mushroom fan love almost every kind opportunity try   However feel as well most people probably think button mushrooms shitake mushrooms wild mushrooms     I know most sun dried tomatoes kept oil keep them moist   But when added sauce far much reserve oil added sauce   If tilted plate bright red oil would able leak onto table below   far heavy sauce such tiny pasta orzo   Now realize am Yard House celebrity chef named sea food restaurant but would least hoped entrées would good all appetizers had   chef would still able provide equally sized scallops plate would receive overly greased pasta   All all detour returning Yard House some apps beer but detour ordering entrée again  <EOR> Not good place conversation because very loud  However food very good! ordered gardein thai noodle salad small less 600 calories! ahi toke bowl 300ish calories both delicious  only complaint use bit much NaCl food   Prepare drink gallons H2O when home  <EOR> The Yard House Town Square packed sardines! always liked Yard House because entire Gardein section fake meat dishes menu just nuts for  started hyperventilating first time Yard House  always end ordering Spicy Chicken Gardein Sandwich which runs $12 $13  some weird reason Spicy Chicken Sandwich menu but online  Regardless waiters know exactly talking when place order  portions always overwhelming which takes happy place     The menu beer section Yard House ridiculously huge  think  why Yard House popular great groups! vibe Yard House great  People buzzing if don't mind talking loud you'll fine  dim lighting everyone prettier lol  prices sneak though  those restaurants where bill wonder high  Sneak attack!! <EOR> Had good lunch  Great service bar numerous bartenders making sure covered  Food very good  <EOR> Great beers tap happy hour ridiculously fun [with appetizers drinks half off hellooo] food alone good  Even pizzas    Their service EXCELLENT! wanted Bailey's milkshake dessert server nice enough even though wasnt menu  sweet that?

The only thing missing REDDS Apple Ale! <EOR> Not sure what's more embarrassing fact other day before going see Master rave two thumbs up! spent $120 dinner 2 Yard House fact thought worth every penny   say average opinion Yardhouse low but think typically thought place grab some cheap happy hour appetizers some beer place spend $30 entrees   Well did damn happy results   We arrived shortly before happy hour ended started Black Tan also ordered seared Ahi Sashimi appetizer which pleasantly surprised find half off happy hour menu which also discounted price beer bit     Ahi appetizer several times almost always winner   venture say best kind among chain restaurants   entrees dining partner Pepper crusted Filet Mignon ordered Ginger Crusted Norwegian Salmon    Both accompanied Wasabi mashed potatoes which always enjoyed slight hint wasabi every bite   salmon little masked all toppings namely carrot strings ginger crust sesame vinaigrette     Usually would find negative but I''ll damned if all ingredients really work together here   known sneak bite salmon own time time anyhow found nicely cooked   The issue entire meal filet which ordered medium little inconsistently cooked   Some seemed cooked Medium well little no pink while some did seem cooked ordered   able taste little both sections found them both tasty though some pink more liking     Service great throughout ordered several jack cokes once happy hour ended constantly being refreshed   When informed waitress movie she made sure bring check quickly   When check first arrived slightly taken aback price and amount alcohol we'd consumed but realized worth it   also made appreciate could into Yardhouse choice whether great $30 experience couple drinks onion ring tower sandwich all great steak piece fish extra   can't or much anything else Applebee's folks!    Later theater while everyone else fleeing exit midway through sat content   initially blamed poor movie taste others but retrospect perhaps contentedness meal beforehand transferred over cinema experience  <EOR> I atmosphere yard house but food isn't amazing   more vegetarian vegan side basic american staples you'd expect brewhouse   didn't american cheese odd   tons beer options but food options seem strange me   I'd suggest sitting outside seems nicer less crowded  <EOR> Had dinner drinks Yard House Townsquare last night  Heard nothing but great reviews place! did disappoint!! waitress Nancy sweetest! celebrating sisters birthday she surprised birthday dessert!! drinks great el picante fave food even better!! Thanks unforgettable night!! We'll definitely back!! <EOR> Happy  Hour  Poke  Nachos    That's all need know  happy hour 3pm 6pm order poke nachos  AMAZING  Anything off menu honestly delicious  great selection happy hour menu well alcoholic beverages obviously !   The staff great haven't bad experience yet  only thing bringing them down star ambiance guess say  definitely darker louder side but can't complain much since TVs around restaurant playing any game think of    But other food great staff great! highly recommend going here! <EOR> The food amazing! server brandy standing! Leo manager duty very attentive quite helpful helping choose menu item  highly recommend place! disappointed! <EOR> Celebrated birthday second time location last two months find mediocre say least    Cold fries side dry pastrami sandwich stale bread   Flavorless drinks hair Mac cheese  Sure take off bill but forget hair? continue celebrate empty stomach Since didn't offer another meal option?  Service lacking genuine interest because staff busy discussing Sunday football tickets  Parlay buy points that    Thanks pointers but drink refilled empty plates off crowded table?!   Wouldn't rush back any time soon  suggestion try another restaurant town square  <EOR> Second time Sunday evening movies decided return Yard House dinner  blonde house Ale came fast cold! thirsty hit spot    For app onion ring tower once before husband ordered again  just previous version just fried onion rings served dipping sauce just okay    I wanted try french onion soup could add pastrami sandwich  soup really good served deep rich flavors beef broth onions all covered melted cheese under cover french baguette bread  Very good soup    My pastrami sandwich served pickle fries fair amount meat  served fresh bread decent size husband ordered seared tuna sandwich decided trade off he took half mine took half his  admit pastrami better  tuna lightly seared seemed fresh but tuna sashimi style without any bread!

I used eat Yard House least once week because GREAT GARDEIN menu but unfortunately change today Apparently no longer serve any Gardein Burgers which huge BUMMER! vegetarian burgers super delicious didn't taste any different real one    I am really disappointed thought Yard House progressive restaurant which open minded enough incorporate conscious vegetarian trend    <EOR> We very impressed selection beers prices weren't bad either  place packed even though could tell slow day  <EOR> So w few friends watching C's Lakers game few weeks ago drinking 1 2 yard Pabst   Well  we're pretty much done w 1st round beers looking order some food when accidentally tipped pretty much empty 1 2 yard glass over shattering table   4 staff people hurry table there's virus loose clean everything 45 seconds   AND THEN offer free round them because they're worried glass beers     Wait  didn't break glass??  Weren't beers pretty much done??  getting rewarded this??  Ummmm  ok  SURE!!!  So 5 stars service!!  guess if you're hard cash want free round could intentionally break glass there     <EOR> I usually place well enough but location must put much effort team morale  Everyone looked miserable felt complete inconvenience whole meal  first greeted girl dropped menus but informed she off actual server would over shortly  decent wait later she came back say guess your server you? ordered beer she just blankly stared while assumed she needed id started digging purse which seemed annoy in defense am only 25 cut some slack there  put order but when spinach dip appetizer came chips provided looked burnt definitely tasted wait server stop talking coworkers kitchen we clear view booth gesture over ask new batch weren't nearly black  Again gave slack because she didn't run food see chips before landed table but then she must forgotten request because didn't chips until actual meal came out  plain tortilla chips same ones originally received  She again sat kitchen talking other servers probably annoyed she take more tables since fairly slow as food server am fairly positive she only table seated paid before meal came other table three men ordered beer each ate food   Only making note say there's no way she just very busy  bad days but girl hates job just wanted made very apparent she couldn't until table  very meh food wasn't great terrible server deciding factor break experience Veronica made definite bust  Won't back if am sure sit bar top where working staff can't hide  <EOR> I usually Yard House once week past few months  never problem until couple days ago when came friend   Came happy hour Wednesday night  First all food great always  ordered pint Heineken cocktail drinks  food onion rings chicken wings bbq chicken pizza mushroom lettuce wraps  Everything tasty  only reason Im giving them 2 stars   However day far worst service had  sure guy's name but found very rude  ordered he didnt come check once  While still eating he dropped few boxes check without even asking if even needed if wanted dessert  6 slices pizza over half onion ring tower couple chicken wings left   felt rushed  would understood if getting ready close but wasn't even 11 yet  seemed he didnt want all    I honestly hope only awful experience because food wonderful  <EOR> I've Pasadena many many years ago dragged husband because loved beer selection    Beer usual awesome   both thought food pretty good prices weren't great but weren't crazy bad either   actually loved way cooked chicken chicken caesar much probably best caesar and order lot them since moved Vegas area   Wouldn't come regularly because Town Center which crowded tastes   Plus many other choices try come regularly   Oh music play mostly classics very  very loud   didn't bother but husband really annoyed it  <EOR> I'm usually fan chain restaurants but few items coming back  Tuna tower GOOD  Also tried truffle fries first time loved it!! All other plates tried good  Service always great  <EOR> Went dinner dad expecting much but service amazing! enchiladas Crème brûlée both die for!!

We arrived host said follow table  few minutes later she finally decided walk towards she done chatting things absolutely work related   Once table magnificently pathetic server didn't even bring 4 waters solid literal 25 minutes  did however beer meantime    We ordered food while all eating drinking waters still never refilled but once over 4 5 hour time span  waiter way avoid table because think he acted if way demanding  know getting drink refills taking food orders tough gig but  your job   We asked bill split between 2 couples ours came half correct when he brought first time  Then 5 buddies friends walked door stood around say hi because they'd seen each other years  When waiter came back asked correct bill supplied card charged correct amount while friend paid cash portion  When came back being delivered another waiter I'd charged 18% gratuity tab party 9 because standing friends buddy didn't anything back!  The waiter left because place closing  he charged basically told didn't time remove gratutiy could charge even if group over 8 people friend $14 change because guy just kept it   I'll never back again  terrible service terrible people  If just did your job correctly first place wouldn't your way steel your tips people  <EOR> I haven't bad experience yard house locations at  service good food great atmosphere decent    They good deals lunch specials if dont mind going during week  admit however only tried tree things menu  Mac cheese2 favorite  Don't let name fool more carbanara sorts Mac cheese  <EOR> For first time Yard House very impressed  reminded BJ's but more college older crowd place rather place bring your family    We during happy hour 3 6 pm Monday Friday  Appetizers 1 2 off well beer martinis  tried Pomegranate Martini which excellent! love pom juice drink didn't face squint  couldn't even taste alcohol! end night Asian glow face few sips glass  GEEZ! good!

Anyhow Mom area decided stop Sunday night dinner   pretty crowded but sat immediately approached friendly server took drinks appetizer order   add    if know anything beer list nothing but long   really nothing exciting it   Anyhow beers came quickly server took order   figured app should any minute but instead sat waiting waiting waiting    until BOOM! entrees came out   told food runner never received app he said he would happy take food back app sent he could just sure aren't charged leave dinner   Uh no    we hungry ordered app want it   he takes food back start worrying am going end moldy bread again entrees going sit under heat lamp until ready them     I saw server talking Manager then came over table apologize error crab lobster artichoke dip would momentarily she would ensure meals made fresh  Also app would no charge Once received dip really good disappeared quickly   entrees fresh when received them did moldy bread  WHEW! server also apologized said error which know isn't easy   Now all may seem big deal but previous experience having returned restaurant over year moldy bread just really disappointing   used Yard House almost every Sunday big group friends loved food service   Now seems both gone downhill am sure if find another reason back   very generous manager comp app but am looking free food   just want order come correctly timely manner without mold  much ask?
