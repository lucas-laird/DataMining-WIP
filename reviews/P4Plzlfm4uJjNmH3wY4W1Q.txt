Well smaller hoped for   Next time Italian Beef Sandwich  <EOR> I've wanting try place awhile especially since several friends hyped pretty decent  outside building misleading  may look old janky but interior decorations very nice  staff front also very friendly but staff usually does break whether revisit location not  chili made location  canned chili that tasted identical Hormel's Chili     The hot dog received The regular one pretty lukewarm  presentation looked great  taste however very underwhelming  couldn't taste actual beef  texture also very weird  never tried chicago style hot dogs wouldn't know but hot dog itself tasted pretty cheap  Maybe polish dogs would've tasted better but tasted almost no better Ballpark hot dogs  Wasn't big fan rest ingredients especially relish either  only notable flavor hot dog peppercini    The fries weren't great either  very greasy soggy  could stand greasy and or soggy if flavored but pretty bland  give place another try but wouldn't touch hot dogs fries again  <EOR> I today   ordered hot dog fries told they're fries   serious?   first ever me   hot dog $7    insane price hot dog but hungry paid   wait fifteen minutes hot dog come only other customer restaurant   When hot dog finally arrived cold didn't provide any napkins   thoroughly disappointed back again   Now starting feel sick  <EOR> Hot dogs excellent    If you're Las Vegas you're looking best tasting dog place    The only thing very lacking SERVICE    service leaves lot desired   No thank you's all  It's almost really don't appreciate business  <EOR> Fries cooked perfection chili dog topped best lime zested chili onion cheese  Great authenticity presentation various memorabilia  <EOR> I drive place multiple times week way home meaning check while now since heard pretty good  Don't let appearances turn away  While outside looks dirty shack inside actually pretty nice although small    The menu pretty simple staff really nice patient when trying decide get  2 Chicago dogs fries drink which #3 specials list $10 99   which definitely higher Chicago   but Vegas guess  bad  ordering paying cook began making food door less 10 min  food pretty good fries natural cut skin still which like  dogs pretty authentic similar you'd Chicago but seemed less filling   good thing 2  would probably come back especially since want try some other items gyros Italian beef  <EOR> So glad Chicago dogs within reach once again  Since moving Ann Arbor Detroit four years ago couldn't decent Chicago dog without driving back Ann Arbor   If red hot done right Viennas buns pickle spears relish come direct Chicago  Once  done there's usually much else complain but fries   The fries reminded wonderful very salty slightly soggy in good way fries Demon Dogs RIP under old Fullerton el stop  Just enough skin left them them great  <EOR> Have always passed place weekends when take ride Exotic Pets always wanted try  out   Finally opportunity Monday week   Looks hole wall place outside want question quality food brutally honest but nice surprise!  Themed Chicago place seating 25 very most plus some outdoor tables well   offer Vienna Beef hot dogs regular jumbo sizes polish sausage Chicago beef sandwiches couple other sandwiches   ordered kraut dog which comes sauerkraut seasoned w celery salt yellow mustard poppy seed bun   know Chicago hot dog traditionally sport peppers neon green relish which believe sell well but grew eating hot dogs charbroiled ketchup mustard onions dill pickles  crazy toppings never appealed me    until now!    LOVED celery salt seasoning sauerkraut!!! Way Chicago!  huge difference imo overall flavor hot dog   used dog horseradish mustard but celery salt compensated enough satisfy taste buds   french fries handcut never frozen  cooked perfectly ketchup fries Fry Sauce!!

Cashier's first impression bored unfriendly  He didn't much say while taking order seemed he cook getting along  having little tiffs whole time while there    The food Jordan Hotdog     SEVERLY over cooked   borderline burnt  Very dry  Nothing proud of     Cheesy fries     cheese?! Nothing cheesy them    Lemonade    Why am rating lemonade comes dispenser?!?! TASTED PURE COPPER!!! Did taste anything lemonade    We certainly returning  staff rude unfriendly did leave good first impression    <EOR> The place filthy   booths dirty crumbs but black dirt   floor hasn't seen clean mop years   cooks allow stop both here     The food horrific   Kraut Dog maybe beef frank  sitting water for long? rubbery   Nothing dog special except price $3 99    350% mark rubbish     This no place lady   Hence room smelly men grunt rather speak     It took 35 minutes hot dog cheese steak ums fries   35 minutes hell hole  <EOR> This those places whenever drive see reminds check sometime  Well 100th time decided finally drop take plunge   Of course when walk see walls nothing but Chicago based teams paraphernalia  guess should expected that  Now if  only find Seattle themed restaurant then would set  Seahawks! Shameless plug know but love Hawks death!   Anyways stray off beaten path going over all tantalizing choices pretty easy read menus ended getting Chicago Beef Italian Sandwich  your basic roast beef served Italian style which includes sweet peppers opted provolone cheese  also your choice your sandwich dry wet dipped  Now pay attention especially noobs because determines just much beef juice au jus your sandwich incur  Dry just that  No juice whatsoever  Wet put little bit your sandwich  Dipped literally dip whole sandwich beef juice! last option perfect meat lovers just cant enough juicy beef goodness  Just little warning though very messy due sogginess factor would recommend eating right away restaurant home because wait factor  try eat picking use fork    Price came 10 bucks change  Trifecta option which basket fries drink 2 dollars more  Judging saw when somebody ordered fries looked golden delicious skin them  think  all fries should served because part potato actually good you   Service decent  ordered food timely manner  guys behind counter very friendly   The overall ambience place very casual enough tables chairs 15 people  don't recall seeing bathroom  But then again wasn't really looking im sure if not   Overall would come back place try some other items well  Since its bit pricey though everyday occurrence type thing once while should good   Yelp 2014 365 Challenge Review #1 <EOR> First off want people understand location under new management ratings done prior September should taken into account   I dropped lunch served best Italian beef Sausage sandwich if ever if knew  saying lot  I'm going disparage any owner's competitors but mom pop type place although owner young woman she sure cook Chicago way  She deserves business because prior owners closed 6pm weren't open Sunday's many folks still aren't aware new hours  Want quick meal take home work?

Although service does take awhile serve good dogs if you're willing wait   Also unless wrong haven't found another hot dog place sells black cows the drink    Try drink  it's good mean could probably yourself but think  signature menu opinion   Quick stop fair food great cows! <EOR> You guys amazing mean amazing food but closed Saturdays?  your website yelp don't advise customers business being closed      Trip across town served disappointment <EOR> I coming Chicago Dogs off since 2003 always found hidden gem until recently   building ancient service past mediocre but food always saving grace   Yesterday however visit bad might second last visit!  took friend between sampled Mustard Kraut dog Maxwell Street polish mini corn dogs side fries   polish cooked well but onions overcooked ruined flavor dog   buns cold corn dogs overcooked perhaps dirty oil tasted terrible   French fries probably best tasting item even borderline overcooked   Add apparently common malfunctioning ketchup dispenser nearly empty bottles hot sauce once actually found service better food   Giving them more chance before crossing place off favorites list    <EOR> The Hot Dogs place great  Everything shipped Chicago prices very reasonable  Chicago Dog 'Works' Gyro some curly fries  Very very good  reason place only gets two stars because service  may 'Bimbo' behind counter much makeup enough brains run register may surly cooks prison tats serve food  look back now am sure roaches scurrying around floor waited food  try drive thru but help no problem swearing storm waited wife kids  Two visits enough me  <EOR> mehhh       Prices high service slow 20 minutes hot dog!
