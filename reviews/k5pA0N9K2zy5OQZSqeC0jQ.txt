Unfortunately answer seemed NO capital letters  tried wait line thinking would quickly but unless owner believes Wolf Wall Street's philosophy any publicity good publicity don't think event did aimed do  staff interacted sadly infrequently seemed nice they seemed focus front line back but neglected middle many times took lady behind line saying give water everybody line except over staff happening walk same time them realize they've neglected middle but did seem much preparation event  Maybe try Burgerim day but event headed excitement ended disaster even waiting couple hours line decided leave did seem worth it  <EOR> This first time BurgerIM LOVED it!!

Step 2 kind patty want? Beef Chicken Vege etc    Step 3 style want? Classic California BBQ etc    Step 4 side want? Fries Onion Rings etc    I think would better just offer several different types burgers show photos product   I ordered two classic beef burgers fries drink  $10   I don't care fries  Instead regular fries they're small thin discs size quarter  taste fine but just wasn't satisfying french fry experience  see why some people might them but prefer traditional thicker fry  onion rings looked delicious   The ketchup mustard located corner near front door  things little inconvenient  When picked order instead going back table walk tray over ketchup mustard station  burgers served tight cardboard type box  Since prefer mustard bottom bun I'd remove burgers box flip them upside down right ketchup station  Because I'd rather handle food ketchup station skipped mustard   After sat down realized forgot put ketchup tray fries  now back carry whole tray back over ketchup station  silly  Just put ketchup mustard every table done it  salt pepper?  As burger itself ingredients crisp fresh  whole thing well prepared similar homemade mini burger  thought taste fine but wasn't really all impressed  same money there's other burger options around town much better   I would eat again but only because little curious Cowboy burger bacon onion ring BBQ sauce  If hit back otherwise don't really see place becoming regular lunch spot me  <EOR> The place very nice granted new but VERY disappointed  ain't even burgers you're getting small sliders prices regular size burgers  First time better believe gonna last  Two stars only because place nice clean  Again granted place new <EOR> What joke place is  long boycott establishment myself because handled grand opening food giveaway finally decided WTH let's give them shot  Unfortunately should held tight boycott  walk lunchtime just table any patrons served right ordered figured wait shouldn't long  Wrong    apparently takes way more time realized cook burger size quarter  even though tiny little pucks meat priced regular sized burger  none would drawn ire simply made teeny tiny burger ask them which did not  even close  when called let them know goofed didn't receive apology but rather told come back correct burger  Yeah pass that  But if enjoy paying more itty bitty portions subpar customer service place you  <EOR> Burger IM great because power choice here   crave burgers am Los Angeles   honor living near favorite burger grilled chicken pineapple avocado bacon cheese!  never anywhere else   When picked LAs Vegas Weekly read feature hunger   option veggie burger well!
