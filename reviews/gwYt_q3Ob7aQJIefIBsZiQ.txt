The chicken fresh DELICIOUS! best thing ever special sauce! dipped fries chicken texas toast sauce only gave container  need give more special sauce  actually impressed meal overall  def  eat again future maybe least once week  must try if chicken strips  <EOR> The food good   regular chicken finger basket came coleslaw texas toast   chicken fingers nothing special Cane's Sauce alright great everyone led on   am disappointed don't ranch dressing    coleslaw good if coleslaw KFC coleslaw but still good   Texas toast probably best part meal silly sounds phenomenal   Honestly quick stop something different pretty good overall  <EOR> I've multiple raising cane's probably cleanest all ones to    I usually just 3 finger combo since anything more little filling  really big fan toast but theirs really good! chicken always battered correctly fries amazing  sweet tea really great too!   The workers hit miss sometimes  Sometimes they're nice sometimes they're not  Lol <EOR> I tried Raising Cane's first time today  ordered Box   4 Chicken Fingers Cole Slaw Texas Toast sauce  also tried sweet tea    and sweet tea  Just right amount sweet yet could taste tea  fries skeptical first but hot fresh good  But chicken fingers wowed me  Crispy outside juicy inside cooked perfection  when dipped into sauce   I wow why people come much! Texas Toast first ate whole piece usually hate Texas Toast but good!   Add great service 4 star review really close being bumped 5  back bring others when do! <EOR> Raising Cane's food good  No doubt that! But today messed order  Instead giving three box combo  gave caniac! Most would probably like what's big deal? more! thing don't eat much  don't even finish fries! food waste  Feel bad person getting three box combo instead caniac combo  <EOR> I don't visit fast food restaurants often but Raising Cane's! chicken fingers juicy all white meat accompanied light crunchy batter  combos also come crinkle cut fries Texas toast coleslaw delicious dipping sauce properly dubbed crack sauce good chicken fries  and toast  really good everything!!  The fries just normal probably frozen crinkle cut fries they're whatever  bread slaw both fine well  Nothing special guys but good chicken   The other menu item everyone really enjoys Sweet Tea  good reason since yummy refreshing  bit sweet taste normally half sweet half unsweetened great balance   When Rebels win season FREE Rebels Combo two chicken fingers fries secret sauce your game ticket  redeemed within 24 hours  <EOR> Although Raising Cane's just opened area Southern California decided try Vegas when town   came close midnight weekday Yelp directed one   If quite honest high expectations place   isn't bad but think more hyped anything   pretty generic chicken fingers nothing terribly special them     The concept great   All service chicken fingers   lot restaurants concept where serve item   If you're super hungry 6 strip box but really think 4 strip combo box good enough   size chicken strips pretty large   coleslaw decent best but Texas toast good   The chicken strips bit lackluster dry but Cane's sauce it   Think creamy zesty ranch sauce   food hot through drive thru came relatively timely manner    Why knock two stars?  food inconsistent   Some pieces incredibly tasty but others just tasted dried chicken    really want place but until more consistent 3 5  <EOR> If could spray canes sauce perfume every morning probably would   If socially acceptable bathe canes sauce fill tub    If could swap blood canes sauce would probably die    But I'd willing try it      Love quick food me   husband shake caniac combo   He's teacher 20% off comes $7 50    bad two eat      FYI swap cole slaw Texas toast bonus canes sauce if want   always both toast      Fries aren't mine blowing but them lot   crinkle cuts if wanted know    fresh well everything    Fingers made order    Always hot always pretty juicy    But little bland me   Without sauce wouldn't taste buds seats     Staff always nice    Noticed sometimes slack cleaning tables    when shoot cleaning spray recklessly all over     Always winner quick meal tastes good won't break bank   Just slightly clog those arteries    yourself favor eat some veggies tomorrow your canes today  <EOR> They best employees  shift manager Mike took care previous issue comping meal today  Totally above beyond service  totally shocked very well fed along little family  caniac go to menu swap cole slaw toast butter both sides extra cane sauce! lemonade delicious along fries  remember when first moved Las Vegas used frequent location because new me! would eat 3 times week  Now just careful when eat because definitely cheat meal  love staff love food quickness cleanliness everything  <EOR> Fast service classic cane's! Great quick snack yourself kids  <EOR> Mess orders 70% times  Food good  recommend ordering without modifying menu avoid paying extra getting wanted  <EOR> I LOVE PLACE!  Simple menu tender chicken strips fries toast SWEET TEA!  YEAH!  actually give place 4 5 stars because found slaw somewhat bland   drive thru two Vegas trips row now   should open Orange County     Attention Raising Canes Management Portillo's Illinois pulled off OC   too! <EOR> Love place!

Honestly think little overrated there's nothing spectacular raising Canes  chicken strips decent but quite small  give tiny portion fries when order combos thought kids meal  sauce ok but nothing amazing think just ranch mixed ketchup  sweet tea fresh squeezed lemonade  prices decent  always plus  always extremely long line through drive through prefer in  Las Vegas version Chick fil A  come back if friend wants but other without canes  <EOR> The caniac combo perfect sharing! includes six high quality chicken breast tenders large order crinkle cut fries piece Texas toast coleslaw large drink two super secret Cane's sauce  food cooked order everything hot crispy delicious  lemonade made pure cane sugar definitely worth 30 cent upcharge! Although menu very limited those items there's also sandwich available made 3 chicken tenders lettuce kaiser roll well! <EOR> The chicken strips amazing would recommend place  expensive <EOR> Kinda disappointed first time eating here  Major downside flavor chicken fingers  none actually   no flavor seasoning breading  Its crispy only some parts fingers big no no me  really chicken crispy all around  honest even KFC more flavor more crispiness thats just sad  Chicken fingers pretty big size soft however also borderline dry  Hence dip into canes sauce ketchup crazy tenders more tasty tolerable  kinda regret ordering caniac combo eating third chicken finger couldn't force myself eat anymore just dry bland crispy The combo came crinkle fries which tasted good long ate canes sauce hehe  sauce tastes better fries chicken itself surprisingly  sauce sort reminds thousand island dressing mixed lime juice  coleslaw nothing special  texas bread just toasted bread butter  Service super quick cashier nice  Unfortunately think first last time visit here  <EOR> For canes once while type place  sometimes end feeling crap eating but tastes good going down  box no coleslaw extra toast extra sauce  sauce really good everything plate  fries perfectly fried chicken  Sometimes give over fried chicken breading hard end picking off  place also busy sometimes seating limited  <EOR> I seriously love place  Chill place take son eat some good food  never liked fried chicken sort food ever before trying Canes  now once week  chicken always juicy sauce  the sauce good  could eat buckets sauce  fries great to go ketchup packets awesome  squeeze dip it's little things life      really lemonade but usually wait until ice melts bit SUPER sweet  son loves though  garlic bread point melts mouth well  Overall just love it  gets really busy sometimes close most all holidays employees time off  Sign rewards program emails free boxes  <EOR> This Cane's location near many other good fast food restaurants if crazy busy Cane's gets sometimes very short walk drive reasonable alternative    Raising Cane's pretty much does only entree item chicken fingers   Granted sandwich but just chicken fingers inside bun   Given only entree should good right?  Well mostly good long don't eat often     The chicken fingers usually moist tender but when tough dry for whatever reason awful   Unfortunately most case last visit   Their fries crinkle cut just plain great   If only offered other entree items could enjoy fries burger non chicken finger sandwich   The cole slaw forgettable but cole slaw eater begin with   Even those cole slaw don't when container overpacked bursts open when touch lid not unusual occurrence any Cane's    The Texas toast ok but of course bready really needs dipped Cane's sauce fully edible   Fortunately welcome swap toast extra sauce extra cole slaw   Service always seems good cheerful every Raising Cane's to   Perhaps add secret ingredient chicken employees cheerful perhaps just love serving chicken fingers   Whatever reason yet encounter unpleasant Raising Cane's employee any other location   Parking seems okay but only arrived off hours  <EOR> Wasn't sure all hype but totally now!! Best chicken strips ever had!! Sauce give amazing see why charge extra it  Service friendly  Can't wait come back! good!! definite must try while Vegas! <EOR> Yup chicken finger specialty place   Shall chicken fingers chicken fingers?  Pretty good stuff   If nearby chicken fingers just bit gotta it  <EOR> I love canes closest me  Anytime feel need some good ole Cane Sauce Texas toast place go  Oh love chicken here  sweet tea also great when feelin little ache sweet tooth maybe just need dentist   fries also very good! Dip them Canes sauce honey mustard even better taste! <EOR> I Cane's but least every other visit location give fries soggy wet frankly don't look appetizing all  sure we'll going anymore reason alone  Chick Fil A never issue  <EOR> If you're mood chicken fingers Cane's place quick awesome meal!  Me husband usually Caniac share   Its typically just right amount food us   Comes 6 fingers fries two pieces toast coleslaw drink   6 fingers might seem much split between two people but sides pretty fulfilling meal two people     The fingers always tender juicy   perfect amount breading never really greasy   fries nothing just fries coleslaw just coleslaw   texas toast definitely something mention   awesome   Its toasted perfects!  take little bit toast wrap around piece chicken dip sauce   The sauce biggest selling points here   spicy mayo peppery sauce   hand hand chicken fingers IMO!  My suggestion would eat there   food tastes much better fresh doesn't soggy would if took home   Plus refills delicious sweet tea! <EOR> Actually give 4 5 course round half plus infinity rule 5 stars   half star comes off due Texas toast being healthy covered garlic butter cheese oil topping order more effectively clog so called arteries those really important?    Interesting fact Raising Cane's based Louisiana part capital raised start business came salmon fishing Alaska   Pretty cool huh? food!  Chicken fingers pretty much bulk menu really REALLY good!  batter isn't heavy other chicken fingers don't feel all greasy when pick them up   sauce come with?  Some kind tangy mayo based dip made different eating fingers usual honey mustard BBQ ranch although think honey mustard certain locations     I split Caniac combo wife which allowed 3 fingers each both sauce cups my wife tasted sauce but ate most it cole slaw split toast fries shared large drink  Liked cole slaw wasn't oniony  fries standard crinkle cut but taste pretty good sauce!   Raising Cane's inspired find best chicken fingers metropolitan Chicago area   Fortunately live nowhere near place otherwise would probably gorge Caniac myself every day ends y  <EOR> Amazing customer service garlic toast die for!!!! buttery garlicky party mouth! Mmmmmm   chicken fingers very light breading  greasy all  signature sauce amazing!!!  Check place out  <EOR> I love cane's but location needs together  know just dunks but if paying something address issue don't even attempt fix then very upsetting me   We came ordered food  combo asked caniac combo Arnold palmer another large Arnold palmer keep mind charge extra drink   drinks lady hands regular Arnold palmer thy just lemonade not even natural put Minute Maid one   told wrong order she brushed off kind shrugging said well  said order     look receipt left turns right <EOR> Always fan Canes  Today packed capacity   could tell workers racing  tiny snafu but food perfect  employees second none    definitely continue being loyal canes customer  <EOR> These guys messed order TWICE! didn't bread today yesterday forgot drink  unsure business practices  <EOR> Finger lickin' good Having sticky fingers given only way should obtain having chicken fingers fries Succulent piping hot fresh tasty    No variety sauces sauce all provide   Hey Raising Caines why bottle sell tasty sauce please?!  sell ice tea gallon why oh why sauce?!  addicting Peter Lugers steak sauce home which times sneak tablespoon of    would same sauce! all flavorful sauce extra sauce please since also dip no don't double dip fries fries always done right burnt mushy   coleslaw may just favorite Made fresh ingredients daily always order extra <EOR> Raising Cane's awesome  always order Big Box Fingers made fresh come HOT  its best let them cool off bit  French Fries good offering Onion RIngs wouldnt bad thing  Staff always friendly checking sure everything ok  Something sauce  prefer Sweet Tea  wont disappointed  <EOR> I must ordered vegetarian combo wasn't enough poultry meal spark PETA protest  Perhaps running low chicken but fried strips much larger French fry contained little no chicken  Far different location Las Vegas Blvd which always plump juicy chicken strips  Even dog unsatisfied search table scraps elsewhere  2 stars Cain sauce though! <EOR> Went early only car front drive thru  wait 15 minutes food home see wrong! ordered two Caniac meals no slaw extra fries then two extra sauce three toast somehow ended 7 pieces toast handful fries!

Love chicken bread Cane's sauce!  Service always good even drive thru! <EOR> I preface review noting fan fried food general especially chicken    Raising Cane's actually quite tasty  just don't understand hype  pretty basic although taste ok don't anticipate making them staple dining rotation  dipping sauce nothing amazing but does well chicken  fries very meh  They're crispy least lack flavor  If going eat again I'd probably only order chicken skip fries    All all just ok but good alternative some fast food joints town  <EOR> Cane's sauce addicting  Good service quick juicy chicken  Never order wrong cold gross  <EOR>
