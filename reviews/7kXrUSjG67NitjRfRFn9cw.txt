Really worse all time   slow stock everything average food terrible service  Maybe should consider closing location rather remodeling  <EOR> This first review ever because don't care enough post reviews  But needs said McDonalds consistently bad  only reason back because closest house  Tonight ordered South West salad received italian dressing it! Lol sons kids meal two drinks two apple slices 10 single pieces French fries no toy  Horrible  All burgers stale  We'll taking drive further McDonald's now on  <EOR> I currently view McDonald's more restaurant serving inexpensive snacks meals  opinion McDonald's level few below fast food powerhouses starring N Raising Cane's Panda Express  When dinner far horizon want calm appetite order off McDonald's $1 menu look forward better meal  $1 menu features large fountain Coke beverages sausage buritto hot spicy chicken sandwich double cheeseburger small coffee other foods      Both check ins when hiked Angel Park Trail system  McDonald's convenient Angel Park Trail system which includes Bonanza Trail Kellogg Sport's Complex Lone Mountain Trail  restaurant convenient respite outdoor activities  reach McDonald's Angel Park Trail system Bonanza Trail which really east spur Angel Park Trail you'd walk past Kellogg Sport's Complex walk under Buffalo Drive tunnel K Mart turn left Lone Mountain Trail  Crossing Washington Avenue pedestrian signal you'd turn left McDonald's right     far location am curious why McDonald's passed over building restaurant corner Buffalo Washington  existing restaurant few thousand feet east Buffalo Drive Washington Avenue sight lines motorists driving Buffalo Drive traffic signal north Summerlin Parkway  Then again being McDonald's another location couple traffic lights north Buffalo Lake Mead Boulevard       older McDonald's  surprising considering near Kmart  no theme  Just basic McDonald's dining indoor playground area     two check ins basic McDonald's snack  first check in quaffed down limited time Chocolate strawberry Frape  yummy caffeine boost cost $4 600 plus calories  Fortunately halfway point hike I'd burn some off  follow check in snacked Hot Spicy Chicken large Coke  Coke flat  no no! If service wasn't decent wasn't manager presence review would fall flat 3 stars sink 2 stars      try review places when am regular  Now am Duke probably see status fade location time emphasize decent restaurant snack light meal off Angel Park Trail system vicinity Washington Buffalo  <EOR> Came back coffee drive thru best service!!! line super long when first drove mentally prepared wait come flabbergasted look few seconds later see line gone! Lmao Great friendly customer service now super fast!!! Great experience coffee now regular customer location once again!! Thanks! <EOR> Don't eat here   bad customer service   food cold made wait outside   seems employees more interested talking then working  if want McDonald's somewhere else <EOR> Worst FUCKING McDonald's ever life  Employees cussing customers  Rolling eyes when someone requested extra  Smirking when gave wrong size fries ordered paid bigger one  Food ALL over floor  Friends discussing drug sessions cashier front ordering  don't nice part town made such horrible McDonald's  need all new employees  <EOR> Slowest service ever! don't high expectations mcdonalds but geez when there's line 15+ people would expect would put two people register  They're understaffed too! cashier took order then prepare food  AGH   TLDR people work slow motion  <EOR> Came drive thur 2 44pm Sprite coke Diet Coke Dr Pepper ice cream line backed couldn't even leave sat line until 2 51 just smoothie melted    Meanwhile 103 outside <EOR> The worse McDonalds all McDonalds  cant even put sundae together  Last time cold BigMac oily cold french fries  really nice manager called but hesitant trying again  Today decided give try really    thought couldnt wrong sundae but boy wrong!!! put fudge side dripped all over lid   didnt even offer cup holder as usual   No more! Avoid mcdonalds unit   they always mess something up!!! no interest being contacted  ? <EOR> Just hit drive thru place  Ordered large Fries large coke  fries half full coke all ice didn't give straw ketchup  <EOR> Ordered 3 Big Macs none them came lettuce all looked sloppy used cheeseburger buns  Disappointed  <EOR> Bunch ghetto people run place order wrong EVERY SINGLE TIME  If thru drive thru ALWAYS check your order before pulling off  <EOR> This particular McDonalds very dirty poorly managed  Trash left tables trashcans overflowing onto floor trash also all over floor restaurant  restaurant dirty kinda regret eating here  STAY AWAY <EOR> DO COME HERE! stopped late dinner daughter   ordered 2 #7s chicken finger meals   could understand order taker he spoke low didn't speak English  fries old cold very crunchy sitting long time  woman window tried give 3 drinks ordered 2 then she asked AIGHT three??!!' What??!! <EOR> I also wish could give zero stars  drive thru 5 cars line decided just order would faster  parked front entrance employee came door locked it! knocked but wouldn't open it! obviously couldn't keep drive thru line when left no car moved further in! particular McDonald's location should shut down  <EOR> Love taking kids sun set  For extended play time! toddler play area 2 level structure kids climb slide on  area walled off main dining area keep eyes kids still some work done  Place clean bright  Lately came 2 toddlers infant tow  cashier kind offer carry food over play area when became ready  very nice gesture much appreciated! <EOR> First cashier drive thru although very capable sweet looked away spoke facing away window when she told owed  repeat amount while facing me    I only ordered two items large soda ice cream cone  next window server handed cone made poorly leaning over 45° angle  When looked she looked said want cup that? she also recognized precariousness it  said yes but dumbfounded when considered would serve such hazard ridden item particularly when know consumed car  When she came back still bit surprise told she should never served such thing particularly through drive through window  She smiled way   The cashier servers young  fault them  fault manager supervisors instruct employees address customers face face especially when addressing them only serve items prepared correctly if prepared correctly then discard them start again   McDonald's messed up  <EOR> McDonald's McDonald's but when forget things constantly some  rude people working don't frequent location its just convenient close home  <EOR> It's breakfast time no orange juice seriously!  As driving still kind annoyed orange juice charged coffee  Wow !  As opened bag sandwich when hell did order McGriddle  could sworn ordered biscuit cheese egg      little bit attention detail would nice people want $15 seriously <EOR> So actually ended McDonald's default because shopping Trader Joe's literally only restaurant area   disappointed first because really didn't want eating fast food chain especially McDonald's since hundred them back home   However changed tune when saw menu     This particular McDonald's items menu Hawaii locations don't offer   instance handful items value menu never heard before   Bacon Cheddar Hot 'N Spicy McChicken sandwich which don't sell Hawaii McDonald's locations   less $2 can't wrong!  Bacon cheddar?  Yes please!  course fries also couple Baked Pumpkin Apple Pies   November pumpkin season apple pies baked   ones Hawaii fried   baked ones taste much better fried ones     Sure customer service kind crappy but don't expect great customer service McDonald's   does?  cheap eats fries   plus eat items don't sell Hawaii locations  <EOR> sometimes just want sweet tea 9000 chicken nuggets okay?! DONT JUDGE ME! haha but mcdonalds helps quell inner fast food junkie! <EOR> 0 stars if possible  cashier just made food while kitchen guy stood drive thru talking some friends even walked window while paying asked it  Wow  Great job guys  No wonder your business 2 stars never anyone line  won't back  <EOR>
