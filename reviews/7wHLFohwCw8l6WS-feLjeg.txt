Maybe we're type people he wanted restaurant?  he having bad day?  sure     but 15 minutes into dinner he's laughing joking shaking hands other patrons sitting bar  then again another guy leaving back  demeanor completely changed  when manage own restaurant treat everyone same  Respectfully nicely  There's giant stick dudes butt  Really needs over himself  ever back?  Nahhh plenty other restaurants better service food  Sad staff affected actions lose having busier nights  Because never recommend place anyone   Hopefully he gets act together learns treat people    Oh did mention single group sat table requested???

Two people $150 won't back  rather jap restaurant cosmopolitan hotel price! <EOR> Other Mama located Durango just North Spring Mountain inside same center restaurants Norm's TC's  restaurant itself small side somewhat tucked into back corner complex  Inside you'll find modern but homey inviting feel  There's minimal seating alongside fairly small bar I'd imagine there's going wait during peak times   but worth it   In addition regular menu they've also daily special board hangs wall towards back restaurant  looks many items rotate but visit some non standard specials including $1 oysters  There's plenty options between two even few things those don't eat seafood  stomach able take would likely ordered everything menu  Instead party 3 decided share few things     Spicy Edamame Per 6 years olds request started these  Solid starter but live name  They've kick much him  sucker spicy food though couldn't stop eating them  use dry seasoning opposed spicy sauce find lot other spots   $1 Bluepoint Oysters Juicy plump delicious   and cheap  ordered two sauces Pickled Pepper Habanero Ponzu Salsa  Neither did much taste  habanero flavor basically nonexistent first although salsa great flavor didn't think complimenting oyster well  see sauces great praise maybe just off visit?   Oyster Foi Rockefeller order oyster rockefeller normally but foie mix couldn't resist  Then came ate them asked eachother foie?   seen pictures ours looked maybe half foie others maybe less  Maybe just off visit but based wouldn't order them again   White Fish Ceviche Paired perfectly crisped sweet potato chips must try opinion  Unlike prior sauce ceviche very present but enjoyable habanero kick  fresh cilantro nice balance aren't skimpy fish  When run chips delicious own   trust one   Amberjack Crudo Quite possibly most popular dish good reason  Fresh tender fish delicious sauce little bit sweetness little kick  first time having amberjack thanks Other Mama constantly craving order anytime restaurant it   Live Scallop Excellent!

Cooked perfectly! Love restaurant  definitely come back again! <EOR> Oysters fantastic among best ever coast coast  Tuna tartare mediocre waffle fries good but nothing write home about  Perhaps having some sort sauce accompany waffle fries would provide extra flavor boost needs in general necessarily tuna tartare dish   Prime rib eye also similarly mediocre sauce times adding dish other times taking away steak's natural flavor  cocktails good desserts nice  meat tender but slightly overcooked medium rare  menu good overall but you're really oysters  <EOR> On way home Las Vegas boyfriend stopped Other Mama Happy Hour  available daily 5pm 6pm 10pm 11pm  Interesting hours considering they're only open 5pm 11pm    Apparently though last call 15 minutes before Happy Hour ends  Quite restrictive      From Yelp pictures and Yelp's categorization Other Mama Sushi Bar expected see sushi menu  very least thought we'd find blue crab caviar asparagus hand roll  being used Other Mama's main picture Yelp    But nope! Imagine surprise when server dropped truth  no sushi rice made all  Thus no nigiri  No hand rolls cut rolls  Only fresh sashimi crudo dishes such fluke ocean trout amberjack snapper    At its core Other Mama raw bar  addition sashimi place specializes oysters artfully prepared seafood dishes handful hot appetizers  pictures Yelp page simply outdated  menu undergone massive overhaul within last couple years but those sushi pictures consistently remained voted top    Here's ordered     CEVICHE $8 Mix octopus shrimp white fish habanero  Side house made sweet potato chips  Great blend fish nicely complements sauce  Good size two people share    UNI OYSTER IKURA $8 piece per order sea urchin salmon egg served small oyster half shell  rotate which oysters use  Kusshi Oysters British Columbia  fresh delicious  gone soon    We only space small meal else  would've tried few other adventurous dishes menu    Even though disappointed rebranded menu say everything delicious  Pricey but stellar  Also Other Mama 20 minutes Strip  way but far  Worth visit anyway! <EOR> When Norm Yelp Las Vegas speaks listen   He gave great tip share now Other Mama  If looking something different your place   For example fresh oyster topped uni ikura    what creative combination!   Next Crab Caviar hand roll    wow   I enjoyed crab flavor didn't taste much caviar but noticed slight kick fun!  Then uni nigiri style   yum! Don't agree uni butter ocean?  Last but least half dozen NY Prime Oysters  chance select 2 dipping sauces picked Honey Lemon Ponzu     great variations enhanced oyster experience!   The above 4 items some specials day  more items regular menu understand those change once while    They service excellent maybe because sat counter   ambiance intimate quiet  imagine could busy later evening gone close opening time  liked free parking cute decorations inside restaurant!

Oyster prices gone 50 cents! Yeah yeah know some don't give crap 50cents but super stoked solid number $1 $2 change  course bound happen increasing popularity time    Duck Island $2   Fanny Bay $2 Beau Soleil $2 5 Kumamoto $2 5  No $1 oysters available day dream shattered  2 each try them all out    My favorite Fanny Bay all them ordered two more  wasn't fresh hoped  Granted Las Vegas transporting stuff across land no seas expected but unfortunately neither mentally expected nor noted me    Amberjack Crudo 4 stars  delicious probably highlight meal    Caviar French Toast 1 star   I read some review having french toast warm?
