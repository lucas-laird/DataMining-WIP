Besides L L NW part town now another option   LULU Hawaiian BBQ!  Food fairly similar between all Hawaiian BBQs   but honest none them compare back home Hawaii!  LULU while step right direction just OK   Décor almost same Ohana Hawaiian BBQ huge lit menu boards too!  all them Hawaiian menu basically 95% same other Hawaiian BBQ restaurants too   Funny same employees too    pretty much all Chinese!  No offense y'all   but where locals atmosphere eh?  local Hawaii worker sight!  No pidgin English!  No IZ Kapena Pati 3 Plus playing stereo!!  Ack almost automatically takes star away!  part ambiance!  locals home!  Back food though which very much par all other non Hawaiian owned Hawaiian BBQ places all Las Vegas   Cooked efficiently tastes really really just A OK   something missing don't know   love?  Something lacking   food feed sure its large portions while pretty tasty just don't feel NOURISHED   Perhaps soul thing?  Anyway family partook in Fried Fish Combo Plate Hawaiian BBQ Mix Plate BBQ Chicken Beef Kalbi Chicken Katsu Curry Combo Plate  Each combo plate comes 2 scoops rice 1 scoop macaroni salad   If you're going low carb mini plate!  2 scoops rice massive!  But yummy extra shoyu   Macaroni salad delicious dose black pepper Tabasco   LULU's macaroni salad tad runny though could used more salt   Entrees itself average nothing fancy write home about   Fried fish seemed more batter fish   Chicken katsu ehhhhh   the chicken pounded way thin certain sections lot more panko meat   curry chicken katsu sure bag too   artificial tasting   If you're gonna least use GOOD brand!  normally don't katsu sauce served any restaurants usually cheap mix ketchup Worcestershire sauce   If know ahead time visiting Hawaiian BBQ bring own!!  Bulldog Kikkoman Katsu Sauce does trick just fine!  Best thing ate probably Hawaiian BBQ mix plate   chicken beef kalbi grilled very well flat top good sear those tasty caramelized edges   Great hot white rice   would order next time if come back   Generous serving except only 1 piece kalbi   More kalbi ribs less BBQ chicken!  insist!  Not bad experience overall LULU Hawaiian BBQ   may back again next time local food craving kicks in   Maybe then see local Hawaiian working behind counter!!  #hirehawaiian <EOR> I stopped whim today during lunch hour  looking something quick wanted switch normal splurge Greek food same shopping center  Enter LuLu Hawaiian BBQ 2  already sort knew wanted when counter because browsed menu past seems lot L L which I`m very familiar   ordered BBQ chicken mini plate go   First impressions while waiting? store clean employees friendly nice warm temp It cold outside right now   felt comfortable waiting plus smelled delicious there  waited 8 minutes employees brought bag table sitting which nice   When home ripped open bag popped lid super familiar container impressed amount chicken got  Plus separated cold macaroni didn`t all gross styrofoam container hot chicken rice  also included napkins cutlery side sweet soy sauce  Sweet  Now taste   Now where experience falls apart for ME  Everyone own taste standards   rice rice  fluffy tasty little soy sauce  macaroni I`m sorry say while creamy   was incredibly bland  kept digging expecting flavor released  finished but definitely impressed  fact little sad having L L macaroni past  I`m still slightly sad right now write this  wanted love macaroni  Annnnnddddd    the chicken  OK  rubbery skin underside which easy peel away but made less desirable eating experience  thought flavor fine but lacking  don`t know  entire meal needed salt punch something more  fine  Would back?
