In general Panara bread major disappointment     food flavorless     Which would ok if bread good but mediocre      tried sauce add flavor boring sandwich employee offered pesto     watered down zero taste     spent almost 10 dollars breakfast sandwich caramel latte also bad threw away!!! never throw lattes away     second time ever being there     gave another chance but no more   <EOR> I've coming Panara Bread location some time  food ALWAYS fresh!!
