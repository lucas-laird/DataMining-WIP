Sometimes service terrific Adam Carlo Alicia sometimes service good nearly every Sunday morning     Management always trying save dime    Occasionally evening experience truly well cooked well presented meal   tell when visiting substitute cook   sometimes meal service 5 Star but often   Usually mediocre but least ordered looks too   However 9 10 2016 Stopped quick meal HARD ROOTBEER   being phased hear bad    On sale now $1 50 glass!  Ordered Chicken Fingers ordered hundred times been going Pub almost 10 years expecting ordered years   Instead some small strange shaped pieces overly deep fried crunchy chunks   Horrid!   Didn't want cause fuss nearly broke tooth trying eat    Waste $$   Tried peel off thick granite coating but impossible since little chicken fused outer rock formation   Adam usual accommodating self tried explain even getting more 'chicken fingers' since hard chunks small   simply more same brick hard batter posing chicken fingers   kitchen should ashamed   Ellis Island must give something better plenty restaurants L  Vegas   decent cook doesn't over cook everything rock hard hire few more servers   Quit messing things menu years   wouldn't fair let customers know when something dramatic happens menu item?  If making high enough profit Oh those chicken fingers used good then take them off menu   disappointed may stop going Pub altogether  <EOR> No need Ellis island place all same food might actually better!
