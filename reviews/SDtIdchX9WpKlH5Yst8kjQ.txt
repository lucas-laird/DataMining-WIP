Lumpia still same fan but kids enjoyed it  husband beef plate he said bit better time around chewy tough but wished served warmer hot when plate came out   Latijas good  Kids enjoyed    All all its continued progress wish business best luck  chamorro community very big always critics  Keep good work!

Enjoyed visit felt island! If wanting try food Guam your place! Red rice bbq kekeguen cucumber salad empanadas   you won't try anything it  definitely must try when Vegas area! <EOR> First time trying Guamanian food loved ! flavor red rice musubi made phenomenal  sample platters eating fusion feast Japanese Filipino Hawaiian Spanish food  <EOR> Not sure everyone raves about  Never Guamanian food before but doesn't seem anything special  food average chicken rice just that  fried seafood balls heavy greasy  Took quite while food only ones there  I'd say better food options close but guess place if crave Guamanian food  <EOR> I curious place  never Guamanian food  just ok  biggest problem took long your food  30 minutes   much me  food pricey too  rice ok but didn't much flavor  chicken only thing liked although wasn't anything special  tasted something would grill yourself  lumpia bland empanada wasn't great mushy meat something inside  don't remember name other item but chopped chicken into tiny tiny bits way much vinegar  didn't care it  rib weird teriyaki flavor didn't care either  woman front friendly but busy multitasking taking orders preparing food making people wait long time order  <EOR> First time trying place out  did take rib plate good eats  Place clean people friendly   Bringing family eat here  sure try next  <EOR> Second time here  love it  Especially chicken kelaguen  Also first time trying chamorro beignet   OMG mango sauce top LIFE ! <EOR> This first time loved it  LA arn't very many Guamanian food places around  when came Vegas made sure stop ad try place  If you're area must stop  Hafa Adai plate  Everything good customer service great  Friendly staff cool feel whole place  fiancé definitely coming back every time we're town  <EOR> Some best chicken rice Las Vegas area but marred mediocre sometimes outright apathetic service  closer bad fast food place service anything friendly neighborhood eatery  But chicken good enough worth it  <EOR> I wanted check place  Nethless say am Guam but lived thought see food place comparison ate island  Well first time people serve very friendly but food cool  decided give another try since wanted try other stuff  figure am bringing business them should try appreciate it  Well second visit LAST too  Again service sucks  People friendly   The food salty  ordered whole main entrée $13 00+  threw food away because taste horrible  only enjoyed extra side dish cucumber daigo  pickles $2 50 extra  wasn't salty  good experience again  NEVER recommend place any friends family  <EOR> There aren't many places Guam food mainland   would think now most locals Guam would know place add list must haves when Vegas   So       review mainly meant those never heard any Guam food   Bottom line The bbq taste going different probably any you've had   But it?!  kidding probably LOVE regardless which may choose    distinct soy sauce lemony combo    And if don't love least then least say tried something new right?    A side note locals congregate talk   island thing     just let them be  <EOR> Sweet tatiyas red rice masubi octopus chicken kelaguen bbq bottle King Car road   yes am HEAVEN!

Lol pleeeeeasee <EOR> Note owner stated promo purpose no ladies blonde hair work brother law follows IG point young blonde hair ladies place  being said maybe your promo someone's hair stayed kitchen area ? which into food  does explain that!  Admitting use lemon POWDER real lemon means your employees take lazy way powder if needed which tell never same REAL fresh squeezed lemons  No matter which powder use squeeze best way tell difference  ex chef GUAM able right away especially watery kelaguen    Tatiyas suppose round enough said  Again lazy way cutting any shapes  Advice cookie cutter much faster perfectly shape   The coconut issue part kelaguen recipe long guys took food 30 45 minutes  Someone could kamyu then added coconut kelaguen  can't worry leaving important part recipe because spoils fast food industry everything should made fresh every day  Don't tell save days ?  good!  As gas grills then explains NO SMOKE CHARCOAL FLAVOR meats! But totally understand follow all rules building  But course when say GUAMANIAN food expect island style  starts Charcoal bbq back islands any family event bbq gathering    I see didn't anything say red rice ? probably because sure living name seen other reviews  stated found uncooked hard pieces plates just mine   Last complaint timing orders appropriate 30 45 minutes all say put yourself customers shoes ? Then think if ever want back    I hope your restaurant best  know hard business but few easy things brain stormed  want come support culture respect doing but any chamorro know always good bad reviews  hope year sooner things easier better  family would love come back  Focus more restaurant your reviews because answering all reviews necessary all  Everyone always opinion mines! <EOR> So wandered upon place getting eyebrows done know TMI  way Shilas eyebrows fantastic   never food Guam sure expect  pleasantly surprised!

First time trying chamorro food place did disappoint  Coconut everything! even happy hour 2 5pm Monday Friday daily specials! Latiya chamorro dessert must try! <EOR> Mouth watering food amazing selection run sweetest people  glad place recommended same everyone loves Asian islander food just wanting try something different but full flavor! personal favorite spam musubi empanadas but combo fiesta platters must going back soon more  YUM  Well priced good location  <EOR> I truly appreciate having restaurant Guamanians Vegas  Maybe getting close closing but thought ribs salty empanadas didn't taste anything empanadas Guam  food did take awhile come but understandable type meat serve  liked all jars pickled stuff reminded cash counters all mini grocery stores Guam  <EOR> Too expensive small portions dry meat 3 main reasons 1 star rating  don't usually write reviews but $30 spent such waste instantly write one  eaten Chamorro food before when first Chamorro restaurant opened Eastern Avenue several years ago  food delicious  Sadly kept increasing prices giving less food which probably led demise    So spent $30 buying 2 Fiesta plates but felt big ripoff   red rice cucumber salad lumpia egg roll kelaguen chicken shrimp fritter ok  more upset meat gave me  BBQ chicken very dry  tasty but wish used chicken thighs instead wouldn't dried up  Additionally would think paying $13 50 plate would more just 7 tiny 2 inch strips chicken  didn't BBQ beef extra BBQ pork rib which super dry  didn't even taste fresh  tasted cooked night before    I probably would never recommend place nor would ever come back  I'd rather eat Korean BBQ Hawaiian restaurant BBQ much juicier tastier  <EOR> First time visitor! bf apartment hunting today saw Red Rice checked reviews yelp  returned evening dinner order Togo  Christian cashier kind courteous also gave some background plates  He great food amazing!
