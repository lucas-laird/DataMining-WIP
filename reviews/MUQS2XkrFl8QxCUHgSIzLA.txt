The staff also very friendly love it   when comes customer service  <EOR> Amazing food!! Cheap prices  Service fabulous! could redesign menu but only thing could possible say negative  <EOR> Was Dessy's tonight dinner  3 25 dollar gift certificate restaurant com   place decorated kind oddly  sure all pictures indians around it  seems wait staff wears cowboy uniforms wasn't most visually appealing decor guess saying    Our server nice attentive without being overbearing  thing sort irked drink glasses  thick glass pint glasses ice don't much drink them if drink alot beverages during your meal you're gonna flagging down someone every couple minutes   Also menu no wine beer list but think serve them  no idea really waitress never mentioned them  woulda nice because hard spend 50 dollars unless you're going steak lobster which none we're mood for    The food ordered came quickly pretty good  california chicken but wouldn't order again unless put between bun some bacon some kind ranch based sauce  just doesn't belong plate itself IMO   salad bar good   greens other mixins basically anything want put salad very fresh inviting  7 different salad dressings available well  Also bar wings which decent pizza which didnt try tacos nacho ingredients pudding ice cream spaghetti? think    So end all bill 45 before tax didnt end using coupon  we're planning having drink two which would made enough use but menu nothing it  even looked desserts didn't see any  think restaurant would push things drinks desserts because creates higher checks profit margins    I probably would return dinner because food mine least does warrant return salad bar which liked 9 dollars just much considering goto Sunset station dinner buffet @ 9 99    However being small business definitely support them doing obviously doing something right being open 3 years  If change decor menu offerings little think would generate better business  <EOR> Dessy b's good is  Great price  tried steak wasn't bad honestly  Nothing write home but wasn't disappointed suppose  however better places sure if return but if you're looking decent cheap meal find here  Also don't remember name but little Latina lady server she super nice! <EOR> Came 1st time family quite dissapointed  young lady serving polite but lacked efficient service skills  did receive refills all  She never checked see if needed anything  salad bar supposedly offers ice cream but offered that  Ordered country fried steak very below average  seemed two frozen patties slapped gravy  Salad bar clean fresh but nothing special  Although fried chicken really good! would recommended restaurant returning  Came expecting traditional home cooked type meal but received exact opposite  <EOR> Good good good Great service nice food clean great selection salad  Ribeye set ny steak+lobster tail tender juicy tasteful  very happy there  <EOR> I steak fried shrimp  say pleasantly surprised  very delicious  Steak juicy cooked medium exactly ordered shrimp hot n crispy  Definitely coming again when town <EOR> I've coming years couldn't recommend locally owned restaurant more strongly  Great food great people  always come when am area  <EOR> This place little ways strip but    Food service good prices reasonable  steak tender steak steak sandwiches real steak tender  meal strip would way more paid d may good  back next trip LV  <EOR> The service excellent!  food fair  Food prices reasonable   However visiting restroom left wondering kitchen must look like  dirty restroom sewerage  issue   cracked toilets handwashing area may over 60 years  Mildew smell top poop smell coming sewerage very GROSS  left very didappointed  reason plan going back  <EOR> Best steaks Vegas! coming true carnivore  Great service never look around waitress  Don't let outside fool did me  Take chance you'll amazed  <EOR> I came good burger one!  homeade potato chips choice side great alternative fries   I added $3 49 salad bar which really buffet   buffet good sized obviously salad but they've also chicken wings tacos nacho fixings pizza ice cream!  Lots filler items such jello salad potato salad whipped cream etc   basics terms fresh veggies but nothing exotic  wouldn't call buffet outstanding but selection ok add on entree price right   guess budget could also full meal buffet  well maintained clean   I agree comment when comes customer service   no frills atmosphere former sizzler   Seems mostly locals know   <EOR> This late post but back day January 2015  ate restaurant mothers birthday 18th  lived around area restaurant years ever since Sizzlers years ago    When into restaurant first shocked see uninteresting restaurant all images wall  plays tune old Wild West Indians Cowboys but interesting least    The plates averaged price but quality good  did enjoy any 4 plates had  Each meal lack flavor presented just least bit interest  ended spending close $90 4 people no enjoyed plates nor service  hard interested place all  waste time money  <EOR> We Vegas before New Years thought I'd use Yelp help find restaurant budget price   Dessy Burgers shows top search list decided try out     I really disappointed   Why did other reviewers vegas locals give restaurant  5 stars??

I generally small unassuming places put more effort into food fancy ambience food sucks    Highly recommended if you're just interested good steaks  If you're date trying impress isn't place you   Have Fun Safe God Bless!!! <EOR> Came over DBSH lunch request some coworkers   first sure think     After looking over menu recommended all eat salad bar   much way selection but say all ingredients fresh   Service friendly solid three star experience  <EOR> So place basically sizzler run new management  steaks good portions no leftovers  steak endless shrimp great deal  bring shrimp big plate don't continuously ask more  best place world but would consider going again    PS Don't order mashed potatoes obviously boxed bland  <EOR> We visiting Vegas week asked lady lived area steakhouse along lines Outback but local something tourists don't see  She suggested Dessy B's  great pick!  The decor bit outdated but story steakhouse came good can't really blame them honestly decor doesn't ton decent food   The story steakhouse used Sizzler but Sizzler decided close four restaurants area leaving tons people work  district manager Sizzlers decided time open own restaurant  He loan hired back most employees closed restaurant named Dessy B's  employees themselves actually helped re finish interior change over Sizzler think if remember correctly actually own part business   Anyway food pretty good  wouldn't say five star but definitely better Sizzler! boyfriend split chicken steak dinner broccoli side plenty two people  food simple but tasty made Mom's kitchen   They serve breakfast lunch dinner  wanted back breakfast but Canadian friends wanted IHOP apparently don't those Canada   sure breakfast would've equally good    The prices weren't bad split dinner remember but total bill chicken steak dinner two drinks $16 without tip    I think those visiting Vegas looking something little less flashy strip really enjoy place if you're local definitely check out! <EOR> Dessby B's steakhouse really good place eat some really good food  waitress very happy cordial  She continuous smile face  Christian music playing softly restaurant   building doesn't look appealing outside but don't let deture going in  old sizzler restaurant closed down reopened into amazing restaurant   miraculous story behind reopening business  story every table   also very nice salad buffet  prices reasonable  kids menu tween menu too  potatoes skins sizable  delicious  come order 4 $3 99 <EOR> Instant mashed potatoes?

Ribeye steak slighlty overcooked kind tough  Salad bar decent  Baked potato pretty good would better thicker quality sour cream  look place pretty bad want turn around leave obviously remodeled several decades  <EOR> Ordinarily I'd 3 stars but steak snob Dessy B's doesn't deserve snobbery say? Even though meat cuts seemed mediocre again pickier most steak REALLY tough argue price being Las Vegas reasonably close Strip   Staff nothing but nice  Very friendly accommodating prompt every step way  Really cool salad bar setup little everything   The verdict If you're Yelp looking steak joint off Strip won't American Express calling wondering if you're trying buy island you'll Dessy B's  <EOR> Great service  sure!
