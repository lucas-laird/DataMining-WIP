You've helped find bar  close home  BUFFALO! Well actually Utica but close enough  Sheet Pizza yup hot wings check beef weck poutine hell yes!    On dive bar tour 30 co workers demanded bus stop first  brought little tear eye watch friends devour plate poutine running mouth weeks Yeah all thought sounded gross!  But guess most would think cheese curd gravy over fries doesn't sound appatizing but sure enough hit! few them even gone back sample some other fine Buffalo area dishes    My visit Moon Doggies blur drunk pretty quick back again soak rest scene    I remember place pretty crowded Wednesday night before 30 buds rolled in  don't think staff friendly but I'd pissed if only bartender watching 30 fools ready party walk through door    I'll early catch Bills game pretty soon!
