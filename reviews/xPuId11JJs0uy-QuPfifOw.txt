I feel lunch menu bit over priced even Vegas standards  blackened fish tacos talapia cabbage salsa arugula tequllia cream sauce  fish wasnt seasoned expected being blackened but good  sure squeeze lime over because brings flavor sauce  side fries nice chrispy bar service great  hostess friendly very unhelpful  Watch drink prices  listed  iced tea $4  <EOR> The Artisan Burger jalapeño bacon bomb   Bartenders fast friendly <EOR> Food really good little expensive wait staff gave your space but available when needed   table sat large living room coffee table surrounded sofas still sure if regular table overflow   Burger beer set back  $30  Ouch  <EOR> After arriving long day travel came grab food sit patio   we asked if needed seated said no they'd right out  Waited least 15 minutes again inside let someone know outside  2 tables entire restaurant! 2 bartenders! Walked because obviously didn't want service! <EOR> The Signature 55 Burger served nice soft bun  While meat doesn't taste freshly cooked hard say no jalapeño bacon  No problem if your phone dying electrical outlets your table  should try now? While best food town closest edible meal near convention center  <EOR> Giving place 1 star review being gracious  negative 5 stars would more accurate  waiting over hour tomato soup grilled cheese cold  took bite grilled cheese also cold  sent back  10 minutes later same bowl plate then realized same grilled cheese taken bite still plate  Oh but wait really horrible deplorable thing plate dining companion first  Which means sandwich she taken bite from  GROSS!!!! <EOR> Arrived Friday night  long drive LA ordered Chopin martini but Chopin   asked Belvedere too   Geez Vegas Friday night and can't keep bar stocked! Disappointed   Menu selection much more limited shown Yelp  <EOR> I think place no idea NAB conferences starting Saturday service very slow  Took over 40 minutes Signature Burger $16 which tasted just ok  Could more flavor  side salad just bunch lettuce disappointment  only good thing say waitress did comp meal due excessive wait  did offer local craft beer but IPA $11 ?!? Overall try something different compared convention center fare  yourself your wallet favor  Stick convention center which far faster  <EOR> I momentarily excited see cocktail list Old Fashioned real OLD Fashioned no cherry no orange no club soda just Knob Creek sugar lemon Angostura bitters menu promised  Great! But first he tried use Jim Beam  hell no  Then came cherry orange  Dude menu RIGHT FRONT YOU  only 8 cocktails described never looked? But wait there's more trying weakly dissolve sugar packet into diluting amount club soda why can't bars keep freaking simple syrup hand? putting bourbon he asked want bitters? Some people don't bitters  Well then Old Fashioned pointed out  he proceeds dump OUNCE VERMOUTH followed few dashes Angostura  guess could call drink Don Draper Crapped Manhattan  sad    But bar staff sure put effort friendly otherwise  Though when asked local beers ordered local IPA lunch would've nice bartender mentioned 22oz bottle before opening pouring  didn't need much bloody lunch  Thanks but no thanks    Only 3 beer taps empty    The Margherita flatbread crispy edges floppy everywhere else probably because tomato sauce all over which pizza Margherita    God Old Fashioned making sad  <EOR> My friends staying Renaissance conference  back strip around 5pm decided eat grill 55  When arrived told 3 different reasons why restaurant closed  No gave time frame when would opened any options eat  sat lobby 30min saw 2 women seated restaurant  see if open were  became annoyed although everyone knew waiting no came tell open  seated ordered meals waitress came over let know manager jack would taking care check    We expecting all  would've happy percentage off bill honestly expecting nothing  great he acknowledged feelings did something it    Also food AMAZING! steak sandwich oh god delish  expensive  <EOR> Had some friends staying hotel where Grill 55 located  Decided sit down some wine little eats  Angie bartender only outgoing smiling she really knew stuff wine food!

Renaissance hotel being comfortable having many wonderful seating areas decided eat lobby area couches when meal came  staff restaurant super friendly  Upon first glance restaurant bar area looks very clean such wide selection liquor choices  food menu all sounds great too! many hard choice order       Now ordering way time reflect pony court recent panels just came from  waiter took order very busy reach guests service them extensive  Most those attendance Grill 55 today those pony universe  am glad Pony Con held Renaissance just royal dining choices select from    We finally decided Grilled Steak Sandwich lunch onions held  side chose french fries  eat healthy tomorrow  pair steak wine Riesling thought would compliment steak  Riesling Chateau de Michelle perfectly steak   When

dressing salad  ask dressing  3  Salad just greens   No tomatoes croutons cheese etc just lettuce  4  Steak sandwich huge chunk fat   Normally would give 2 stars but staff friendly upgraded 3  <EOR> Grill 55 little strange bar attached Renaissance Hotel right near lobby near some live music Fridays TV Envy restaurant   wouldn't expect much honest but surprisingly pretty interesting solid restaurant if you're around area     Grill 55 super casual although I'd recommend sitting bar over table    Seat yourself grab menu   items aren't numerous seem pretty safe such sandwiches salads   However taste surprisingly fresh tasty   favorite fish tacos which surprisingly spicy tangy sauce two nicely sized tacos hot fresh tasting white fish   also came fries salad   presentation also nice see tacos being held stand   also grilled cheese night which also solid although wish heated sandwich more cheese completely melt    tomato soup came pretty good too   bar don't forget free spicy wontons basically little tangy chips    drink selection isn't shabby mix cocktails $12 beer wine $6+    also happy hour which never able down by   Food items little pricey ranging usually $12+ but context Vegas food badly priced     Service fairly friendly nice place open till 1AM grab your late night fix   Seats comfy AC full blast even some music nearby if come right time     Again don't overly ambitious expectations grandeur compared likes some exquisitely designed and pricey restaurants Vegas   However late night or earlier snack especially near LVH the LV Convention Center which devoid lot good food foot Grill 55 god send affordable Vegas eating area  <EOR> Grill 55 conveniently located inside Renaissance Hotel next convention center  most restaurant Last Vegas hotels casinos decor appealing atmosphere inviting   Came bit lunch ordered some appetizers Old bay calamari $12 Black bean quesadilla $12 Chicken crispers essentially deep fried chicken strips $11  They gave some seasoned tortilla strips chips start meal  chicken crispers bit burnt clamari looked good but lacking flavor even sauces  black bean quesadilla best three  <EOR> Some coworkers came lunch during MAGIC week since very conveniently located next door south hall prices same convention center choices  comparison eating place much much better but overall restaurant sure I'd way come here   The food good but nothing great  menu consist simple cafe style options burgers salad sandwiches  wedge salad cup tomato soup  salad good fresh but soup pretty bland tasted can   Overall good lunch stop decent food choices  service also good very quick friendly even when busy  <EOR> Being right next convention center place surprisingly prepared seemingly ANY business   food wasn't prepared listed limited menu appetizer came everyone table 1 2 way through meals salads zero dressing them came none side few more miss fires  desperately needed someone clear tables noticed tables sitting tons plates them server completely tied trying wait many tables  would otherwise seem great quick option stop some fairly reasonably priced food instead eating concession food convention center but today  <EOR> Arrived late
