Thank Goodness place no longer service suck $$ innocent tourists! <EOR> low quality food  burger i'd rather n appetizer tasted frozen food sitting fridge couple days  gross    would come back  <EOR> We sat outside good view people watching  excellent view no wait dinner though during week    The food tasty more fusion side traditional Pan Asian fare  entertainment night man lounge style entertainer very good didn't ruin meal any way some entertainers want pay more attention them your food companions    The server very informative recommendations spot on  sure ask portion size some entrees huge side portion completely filling  <EOR> Went late night cocktail sorely disappointed  No hostess area leaving find own way go  restaurant ghost town patio few groups  decided sit bar where proceeded wait bartender well over 5 minutes being only patrons bar ridiculous  Mai Tai made mix which didn't taste quite LA location used when asked sweet drink waiter replied cocoa? said sure    little did know he meant COCONUT! Ew! $22 later more then half glass coconut sludge left counter impressed    I am saying anything food didn't any but cheesy decor slow bartender didn't eager come back anytime soon  <EOR> this place HORRIBLE! waiting 10 minutes even waiter come table took another 15 actually drinks  drinks really really weak way  ordered calamari  same time drinks didnt receive calamari until already completely done meals  must admit tho calamari some better calamari ever had  there some fun live music nice view Bellagio fountains  other those aspects plus calamari would definitely say DONT here  <EOR> Ive before walked waitress really rude  decided give another im glad did drinks Mai tai mehune *spelling maybe off sorry* amazing food also chicken salad fried rice Service great but incorrectly spelt drink forementioned missing its little doll which sits side glass run last 2 months!!! What!!  table construction headguys sat 2 tables away blue prints inside quite obviously deciding where new place going fit thats sad really liked it  <EOR> I happen enjoy Trader Vics   First off tiki theme loves it!  Second fruity rum drinks hammered could love it?  But we'll move onto food   Off appetizer side menu recommend fried calamari only because delicious alone but wasabi aoli serve awesome   Very similar lemon chili aoli serve fried calamari but different same time    As entree's happen ahi tuna filet   Seared sauce served compliments fish really well   course order side lobster mashed potatoes because those also really really good   friend agree potatoes but he'll highly recommend orange miso sea bass entree     I always leave stuffed but guilty kind way because eating sea food  <EOR> STAY AWAY!! There thousands better places strip!!  We really looked forward dinner first night Vegas   What waste time money   The food quite average   only good point  The service disgusting! seated waited 15mins while dumbarse serving staff decided assigned table  Then once figured played 'rocks scissors'? don't know! then spent another 10 mins waiting someone take drinks order    all downhill there    This surprising since 8 wait staff standing around walls picking arses still early only 10 diners house   We section 2 people another large table 8  waiter pretty much said f*ck them Im just going wait big table  left sitting shyttest  dining experiences Vegas   food rather overpriced style quality wine list very average   If want great food great service good price avoid Trader Vics try Hawaiian Tropics other side PH  oh don't take Opentable voucher there   don't know HUGE drama abou cashing it <EOR> Great location but damn if trek there   Trader Vic's inside Planet Hollywood which used Aladdin   If park hotel's parking garage walk through wannabe forum shops clear through casino finally Trader Vic's   good news worth walk   signature drink Mai Tai damn tasty   giving two coupons which good thing considering Mai Tai set back $10   also shot Jaeger which tough $8 swallow   bar spacious   There's also amazing outdoor dining area deck   really best locations strip   Right across Bellago   Should even nicer when City Center finally done   I Caesar Salad   good   croutons clearly just decoration they're hard rocks   also cheaper items menu $7 50   Lots seafood   place smelled fish when walked in   saw some items menu 30 bucks   Good place take date before hit club  <EOR> When Sunday early lunch What ate Malaysian Beef Satay Coconut Chicken Maui BBQ Chicken Salad I drank something ruhmba He drank Mai Tai x 2  Overall Loved beef satays!  coconut chicken okay sauce only thing saved it   both liked salads confirming really BBQ chicken salad since looked more waldorf caesar salad   BBQ Chicken isn't expect but tastes great serving chicken plentiful!  The real question Would back? Yes  <EOR> We simply because read two things 1 some guide Vegas mentioned great view strip Bellagio fountains outdoor dining patio 2 article Polynesian food Saveur magazine few months ago talked Trade Vics invented mai tais possibly crab rangoons one favorite Chinese restaurant appetizers      It beyond expectations all around gorgeous night perfect sitting patio   great view fountains great little band keyboardist steel drummer perfect touch    Service good mai tai quite good very powerful   many times original any food item but little different come expect Mai Tai     Food excellent would put more details but stupid web site doesn't menu it   Stupid!  Anyway put together Polynesian smorgasbord crab rangoons short ribs some lobster thing paired order all in fried rice  Everything great rangoons little bit spice them which different good  sauce short ribs I think it great   fried rice possibly favorite though filled shrimp pork beef fried scallions while overloaded heavy soy flavor could literally taste heat wok rice all seared together perfectly just delicious     Highly recommended  casual night great view good food finger foods starters aren't big ordered actually fine two we hungry though but could bunch people order bunch apps some fried rice town  <EOR> The lay out so so  Mai Tai really good  bartender very lovely very nice she put Charlie C getting smashed bar  Hopefully she lined another job this  <EOR> I Vegas girl friend decided going roam own awhile  Trader Vic's LA Beverly Hills Hotel several times but yet famous Mai Tais    I spoken friend earlier day he told Mai Tai must Trader Vics  just lost several hundred dollars Planet Hollywood Casino attached Trader Vics thumbing through Players Club book found two deal  SWEET!

Save your money!!!  If know anything Trader Vic's history expecting anything heard very very disappointed was   I money burn!  wanted buy all ceramic mugs bowls sell because famous for    I asked waitress 'which drinks bar come glasses buy'  She looked confused   effin kidding me?  She didn't even know talking about   felt stupid said uhhhh ok never mind   When walk only thing even looks Polynesian giant Totem pole center room    that's it   Literally    it   I am normally very picky eater but decided live little wild side order some Mango stir fry   took two bites done   can't tell if just living toooo much wild side taste if really tasted shit   Anywho waitress realized wasn't feelin took off bill which definitely appreciated   The pineapple chicken tender appetizer good    all say   save your money time  <EOR> We heard Trader Vic's before heading Vegas thought we'd give try upon arriving PH   TV fried rice husband steak sandwich   rice good all different meats seafood but rice didn't much flavor   steak sandwich good mushrooms chips different   sat inside could still see strip   waiter wasn't overly friendly he tad slow   am luke warm Trader Vic's    <EOR> Food sub par but drinks patio perfect   Even semi chilly March afternoon being outdoors casinos much needed change pace   Four stopped afternoon intermission led remaining day night's chaos   If don't want something sweet try Honi Honi mix bourbon juices served cup illustrating some pretty interesting positions    If want front row people watching grab seat edge patio watch America walk right by  <EOR> We wound dinner because coupons 2 for 1 mai tais coupon free appetizer purchase entree    service couldn't nicer more attentive he tipped excellent service accordingly   However found food lacking   chicken red thai curry tough overcooked sauce oily uneven   calamari appetizer much better   Mai tais marvelous     My advice? Come drinks appetizers before show but eat your real dinner elsewhere  <EOR> My friend hit Trader Vics Saturday afternoon while Vegas   sat outside few drinks each great time!  drinks strong music good server though busy very nice   even tip bussers where should night   He even called girlfriend ask advice us   really wonderful time if lazy afternoon Vegas place good time!    Mixed Drinks $9 12 <EOR> Yeah no idea place Asian inspired menu  Trader Vic's? Sounds American me  think there's back home but never tried now never will  Everything looked good menu   Nice place good service but poor food bit pricey    Lobster Potstickers Recommended server over Crab Rangoon  Ok $10 piece crap only 4 potstickers! could barely taste lobster meat probably probably size pink nail  over drenched soy sauce    Sea Bass bad but little rich flavor  think truffle oil which big fan of  high expectations sea bass having best South Beach FL  Nothing compares   Filet Mignon Just ok  much flavor little dry overcooked  wasabi mash potatoes much wasabi me  Mushroom side wasn't bad   So all $90 including tip? No thanks! enjoyed cup noodle funyuns hotel room lot more  Stop fake Asian inspired menus  real thing  <EOR> Ok still owe 400 bucks they're closing   just great  gonna earn pushing porn patio  several GMs complete staff turnovers later  Plus eviction notice    I right  Thank everyone supporting blackballing TV  wanna thank Sysco Deluca   Also Coors Nevada Beverage surprisingly Southern Wine Spirits  <EOR> I've two occasions awhile back check happy hour another time grab some lunch some visiting friends   Their happy hour didn't offer much terms food mostly just alcohol  Which guess good thing depending you're looking for  shared Kahlua Pork Sliders braised plum sauce Hawaiian sweet rolls okay nothing special   tasted more char siu bao Kahlua pork if any sense you   drinks ordered ended being part happy hour special disappointed when saw bill  Shouldn't tell what's included when ask?
