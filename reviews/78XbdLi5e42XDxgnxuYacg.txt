Good food great atmosphere excellent service   Jack always feel special  See soon Susan <EOR> Ohjah certainly deserves all 5 stars high quality food presentation outstanding service   A little background information why giving 5 stars  Hubby lived West Los Angeles 11 years enjoying some great Japanese food   When moved Orange County late 2011 highly disappointed lack good even just decent Japanese food area it quickly became apparent OC Yelpers did know considered good food    past 4 5 years hubby really missing Japanese food but given OC   Hubby brought little visit in laws Summerlin Easter yesterday Cali   Mother in law suggested Ohjah since eaten two weeks ago first time really enjoyed it   no idea MIL doesn't even Japanese food! She many disappointing experiences life  guess Ohjah converted her   Husband skeptical wasn't ready try until he read Yelp reviews yesterday evening   decided eat dinner celebrate Easter pleasantly surprised delicious everything ordered was     We around 4 PM avoid dinner crowd promptly seated many customary greetings   ordered following Shrimp tempura dinner included vegetable seafood tempura miso soup salad Miso soup Special Roll Combo  chose Volcano roll without cream cheese Philadelphia roll Blue Diamond roll California roll Edamame Green tea ice cream Vegetable fried rice Tempura ice cream  tempura banana*  Comments food 1 If looking order few Special Rolls Special Roll Combo really worth it buying 2 getting 1 free! Such great deal delicious   Nice presentation added plus   Everything fresh including raw fish   Although volcano roll notated spicy roll wasn't which happy since typically eat spicy foods  2 Miso soup didn't any but son extremely picky eater secondary Sensory Processing Disorder enjoyed it  3 Shrimp tempura delicious even extremely picky eating son ate two bites!! 4 Additional tempura included yam cuttlefish imitation crab onions   liked thick batter light didn't appear greasy   Husband said tempura sauce sweet though  typically dip tempura sauce but didn't because already really delicious  5 really expecting just scoop green tea ice cream  giddy when bowl 2 scoops 2 mounds whipped cream arrived! Before could pick spoon little 1 3 way through first scoop    6 tempura ice cream arrived shortly waiter politely commented put extra tempura banana which typically separate order   exclaimed husband just comped tempura bananas?! thrilled because good! Even MIL skeptical tempura desserts enjoyed them   guessing maybe comped because waiter asked if first time told first in laws second   Unfortunately in laws kind pick bill didn't know comped tempura banana felt embarrassed leaving bigger tip even though tipped 20%   7 vegetable fried rice nice variety vegetables i e  onions broccoli green peppers carrots    ordered picky son usually eats restaurant fried rice when cook it but he didn't even eat any because he into Miso Soup   expecting greasy Chinese restaurants but wasn't   What added great dining experience very hospitable waiter   He attentive personable checking quite often making small talk especially son which always nice since staff other restaurants wince when see toddlers coming dine     When walking manager owner asked heard Ohjah explained mentioned previously   noted certainly leaving positive review Yelp   don't typically write Yelp reviews same day unless good or bad      In laws mentioned used Denny's did terrible couldn't even decent hash browns really happy see replaced great restaurant   hoping people leave more positive reviews restaurant thrives   In laws live less 5 minutes away needless say back!  Next time hoping try hibachi menu  <EOR> I've only once but plan going again    We hibachi table show par better other chain hibachi places    The choose 3 meat option offered much protein reasonable price we steak shrimp scallops husband ordered stuck basic veggie option  no  additional fee split plate which always enjoy  When chef realized splitting he cooked steak each preference which find high class customer service move    tempura perfectly cooked light flakey  veggies fresh crispy which leads believe receive fresh produce daily  sushi well prepared but few other yelpers mentioned little small side which fine appetizer  would bummed if ordered entree    The service spectacular  No dirty dishes sat more 30 seconds  enjoy restaurants staff works team rather saying your server definitely culture Ohjah    If live area you've probably received flyers mail free sake bombs appetizers which help really enjoy 3 course meal under $50  <EOR> Great restaurant  Love food service   truly enjoy eating satisfy Japanese cravings !

Shoot even salad overcooked   okay just kidding that  But really everything super overcooked  fighting against amoeba dysentery something? it???  2  place needs little renovating  fun atmosphere especially hibachi area but everything feels 5 10 years due renovation  It might even old but feels that! some areas where cleanliness rather repairs needed obvious  know Ohjah!  3  service really uneven  enough attention table water tea glasses filled within reasonable time    rather sincerely asking everything tone question everything RIGHT?!! EXACTLY CONDUCIVE HONEST FEEDBACK   like Dude killed steak dead would chance afterlife even India! plus side why 1 star fun rollicking convenient  place dine  If came just drinks would terrific time   maybe just off night  But don't take your most important client your best sweetie without checking first  <EOR> This some new chain go to partner discovering couple consider close friends  first experience good gone back multiple times service food always consistently great  offer great deals checking them Yelp just helpful tip if plan dining there  sushi fresh clean service quick professional  Just beware location Lake Sahara Hibachi only if your mood sushi avoid location  never Hibachi but sushi best tried Vegas great price  Try them leave review!!! <EOR> First off very nice interior design  just don't expect when drive up  Service excellent staff nice professional very friendly  Glasses never empty attentive  Food great trepan best had  menu many good items we'll sushi looked awesome  coming back try sushi    There many Japanese sushi places Summerlin but place hidden gem  try it  <EOR> My favorite place ever! Its affordable hibachi  Everyone works gives positive attitude  glass never comes close being empty before refill it   chefs awesome! interactive hilarious! Its such classy place! No matter if its date night kids your whole family everyone great time  <EOR> Came company Christmas party weeks ago all really good time! first time hibachi restaurant wasn't sure expect    thing did know ahead time pretty pricey I'd only come special occasions but quality food overall experience worth it   We reserved bigger private rooms which two hibachi grills cook stations surrounded countered seating  I'd say enough room party 20 so  Eddie chef assigned side room super friendly little show he put while preparing food hilarious!  Their menu pretty big although I'd recommend sticking hibachi route  There's several meats choose including few different seafood options  ended getting filet mignon sushi roll which MORE enough but if you've real hunger eying more thing hibachi menu I'd try Pick Three option  $30 choose any 3 meats excluding lobster Kobe beef etc  If order any hibachi item also onion soup simple salad appetizers along your choice fried rice noodles   All all glad came Ohjah! complaint scheduling conflict reservation  scheduled 8 00 but once arrived still earlier party having dinner private room  Eventually wrapped all smoothed but little disappointing regardless  gonna knock off star that    OTHERWISE Ohjah great  back! <EOR> I going here  very convenient specially if want some Japanese Hibachi Thai dish place  son loves crunch roll spider roll  Love discount LVAC membership card  I'd recommend place  <EOR> I come order same thing I'd hate try something don't like  order Beef sukiyaki  flavor really good little sweet side  soup clear noodles veggies generous amount meat rice side   can't stray away dish all time favorite My son really likes fancy taste 6 year old  He orders shrimp udon tempura  He likes extra shrimp tempura tentsuyu course side edamame  He loves eat halfway through bowl    Service very good really tend tables    We eat pretty simple maybe we'll try Hibachi table someday  <EOR> My favorite Las Vegas sushi spot!
