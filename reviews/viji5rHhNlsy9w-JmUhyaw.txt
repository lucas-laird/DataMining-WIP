Happy Holidays! <EOR> Came 20th anniversary amazing meal served Rose believe new favorite waitress she above beyond great day family Thanks bunch <EOR> No  No  No  Other hostess greeter looking completely stupefied upon walking cohorts unprofessionalism took quite some time served food which lacked flavor  server slow requests such requesting upon order being served order therefore request again did remove dirty dishes accrued seemed lack basic customer service skills  drive further other locations prior coming again <EOR> How group's excitement eat lunch turn into bouts awkward silence confusion?  Piss poor customer service  how   tortured watched salad plates soup bowls water glasses run empty   repeated attempts them filled apparent lack urgency behalf server assist   Every other server seemed keeping tables    but ours      was lunch himself  <EOR> Olive Garden used favorite family recently cut back menu extensively many favorites gone   suggest checking menu online before coming see what's left  <EOR> I'll first give credit where credit due Olive Garden's recent rebranding efforts new logo font some more modern menu options welcome give nice facelift company   However may much change very well executed menu now boasts selection italian tapas which basically extension appetizer menu most which $5 $6 discounted $4 during happy hour special sorts offered Mon Fri 3 6PM  Tried polenta shrimp dish four shrimp atop bed polenta tomato olive sauce good value four shrimp but sauce overly salty unbalanced many olives  Server apologetically revealed dish isn't going over well   Though they're most known pasta dishes and okay breadsticks usually just come unlimited soup salad lunch special $7 much along breadsticks  Good value good flavors usually stick zuppa toscana but chicken gnocchi good something different    In addition tapas portion OG now small menu featured dishes healthy preparation lower calorie typical pasta dishes  few steps right direction guys now work execution   Additional note never cappuccino here  worth $4  Drive through Starbucks afterward if must  You'll thank later  <EOR> Great experience  Fast service  Excellent food  Highly recommend! Waitress kept checking us  Refilled drinks without asking  Even manager duty came checked see if everything ok  <EOR> The Olive Garden only thing truly believe every state should dozens of  could use less Jamba Juice stores could use less 7 11's but survive without multiple Olive Gardens   And might seem odd statement seeing live Hawaii where no Olive Gardens all  if just stated can't survive without why am still alive?  Well live off hope  Hope day eat Olive Garden again  Hope indulge myself breadsticks salad soup   Thankfully most recent trip Las Vegas able take gf Olive Garden  seated short wait game time baby!

Our meal generous good also sample wine offer when seated   This decent tasty Americanized Italian food review only warrant 3 star rating  am huge fan authentic traditional cuisine am aware Olive Garden commercial concept lacking flare   I must mention server Maria simply Amazing  service she provided during meal world! <EOR> Ate Monday night first time over four years   and wish made choice    Everything gone PRICE   It's dining real Italian Restaurant    Vino's Ristorante Cannery Casino North Las Vegas    But sadly food its presentation real thing         All real meat enriched entrees expensive  eating real Italian Restaurant   my wife ordered Chicken Margherita    like pizza Margherita! When arrived two skinny pieces over cooked chicken breast covered some type commissary red sauce pieces hard identify over hill green leaves believe basil   tasted awful   my wife ate piece chicken offered rest me    I tasted saucy   and chose decline eating offering sadly put off place forgot photograph chicken whatever dish     even worse only serve breadsticks   and asked coated any butter sauce   it arrived breadsticks tasteless    bread should taste good PLAIN!       did order?          I ordered dish should tell good Italian kitchen is     Spaghetti Meat Sauce    it arrived bowl unadorned any garnish    probably sign other diners around ordered cheapest thing menu    I wouldn't call meat sauce would call bunch ground red stuff tiny tiny specks gray colored stuff represented meat part dish      it taste lots ground garlic mixed perhaps Italian flavor enhancers   it bitter tasting garlic sauce no redeeming value    what source lukewarm spaghetti      A good Italian Restaurant cooks sauce sauté pan then adds spaghetti finish its cooking sauce  enhancing its overall flavor    the spaghetti arrived absolutely white big dollop meat sauce top   Yuck    the whole meal cost $33 + 15% tip    I would eaten better In N Out $12 00     <EOR> Stopped because close   glad did   Excellent service food great margaritas!
