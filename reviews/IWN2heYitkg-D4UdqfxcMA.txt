Apparently more important entice new customers take care your current ones  Obviously food once served cold really fast    I ordered soup which excellent smothered fries which supposed pulled pork it  tore fries apart found small bite size piece meat  When questioned server he could cared less  But didn't surprise he could cared less anything  requested salt pepper when food delivered  ended having table because he just disappeared  Meanwhile don't forget dining room freezing soup getting colder minute   People next ordered coffee but didn't spoons  requested spoons several times again waiter just disappears  sure coffee cold while waiting something stir with  garlic bread ordered burned  laugh said just home  But seriously kind chef burns bread then sends kitchen? wait staff professional would serve it??  So nutshell service bad restaurant freezing food ill prepared no cared  manager came table swipe Groupon couldn't bothered ask dining experience  high prices deter most people  Having Vegas dozens dozens times still shocked when glass pop your table $4 95  truly highway robbery    I HIGHLY recommend any other many dining options close by  Mon Ami Gabi right next door 1000x better same price  <EOR> THE spot #Brunch bottomless mimosas!

She took care second sat down  back every weekend see her  <EOR> This place awesome terms location  located right along strip full view Bellagio Fountain  However  pretty much extent me  prices expected high blew mind burgers steaks didn't come sides  ordered New York steak but handed prime rib instead  didn't feel complaining just accepted smile  However first bite RIDICULOUSLY salty  5 days worth of sodium in that single bite salty  manager also ordered steak both sent steaks back because girl size zero slacks fit into next day couldn't afford any unnecessary bloating   Our steaks came back *much* better terms seasoning  Definitely more edible which good! Unfortunately steak very fatty don't necessarily blame restaurant know most prime ribs are extremely greasy  wish could dabbed napkin but didn't want coworkers judge me! small side balsamic glazed onions extremely greasy well sure drench food oil while cooking  Some people love but however am fan   We also ordered dessert platter while good wasn't super memorable  Service good waiter very personable food came within reasonable amount time   If come back Vegas don't think I'd visit place again  However conveniently located strip good place if don't mind high price tag slightly above average food  <EOR> Super awesome food great patio! brunch before race great way start day! <EOR> BEWARE CNF CHARGE!!! totally bogus charge put your bill say because law states all restaurants opened 24 hours required have  completely true just okay place anyways  Giada's Bouchon down street much better food  <EOR> Nice porch  Food very well prepared  colossal bloody Mary share  Chick full food good Spivey Mary  chicken waffles enough share chicken very moist  breast thigh split  farm fresh b fast best potatoes eggs done perfection  Highly recommend  Keep mind portions such totally shareable  help the$$   It while since prior review  some reason did post then 2017   visit again 3 2018 good  <EOR> While walking strip came upon place promoter recommended happy hour  two selected specialty drinks $14 watermelon mule refreshing beverage! food all tasty cooked perfection  Its great size restaurant modern furniture  bar pretty big dimly light main dinning area clear view strip right across Bellagio Fountains  nice spot dinner date cheap prices quality Vegas dinning  private hole wall spots cushions  love definitely come back during next visit  <EOR> Our waiter super attentive polite  food great!

Anyways food great prices bad its location  give them benefit doubt fourth star despite slowness questionable service  <EOR> Restaurant better brunch which takes place 7 days week vs dinner  Dinner menu over priced pizzas $20+ limited variety lacks cohesion  sampled good but once again over priced  short rib entree $38 size Tomahawk steak bone just large  Although enough two people could serve smaller portion lower price  Mac cheese $13 bland tasted Kraft white cheddar straight box  Even server agreed  White bean hummus $10 great but give little pita bread youre stuck half jar remaining no pita bread     One sticking point see returning sending any friends fact cant use 20% off business card give Opentable giftcard same time  treated cash other discount offered restaurant  could split check created hassle but its worth it  Manager came snidely said 'you use 20% off next time ' want your business but bad enough honor own discounts  <EOR> Let first say back day Sugar Factory favorite restaurant all time pleasant substitute    The vibe casual wait staff extremely friendly accommodating  weird thing noticed wait seated upon being seated walked through whole empty dining area  dunno but worked because sat patio weather beautiful    We ordered garlic bread appetizer Hexx specialty drink  bit weeny when comes alcohol asked if bartender could wouldn't really taste alcohol  accommodated very nicely Hexx tasted amazing  offer many different drinks wines Sugar Factory Potions which takes place Goblets    I ordered chicken delicious eggplant also cooked perfectly tasted sweet  did order French fries where lost star me  paid $10 basket fries stale cold  only ate 5 them disappointment but other items ordered perfect  let slide knows circumstance was    I definitely recommend place quite expensive but pretty view great dining experience  <EOR> My husband purchased Groupon just try most recent trip Vegas LDW   We gravy potatoes which amazing guacamole which meh spicy jambalaya which amazing!

Unfortunately friend found piece plastic wrapper ? dish restaurant another one  thought unfair restaurant took original dish which friend ordered chicken garlic bread when brought back new no chicken garlic bread  um excuse me? friend didn't mind but if happened definitely would've said something    Overall experience HEXX enjoyable  However because carbonara incident would give solid 3 5 stars  Service good though end waitress even split bill 6 ways convenience  say food overpriced but   it's Vegas do    <EOR> It's OKAY restaurant  Lots hype reviews but worth price desert pretty small price  brownie espresso ice cream  Brownie good ice cream not   Waitress extremely rude literally no reason  every other worker talked the seater etc   Wouldn't recommend all experience  <EOR> Was für eine leckere Pizza Carbonara! Der beste Boden den ich seit Jahren gegessen habe! Als ein schusseliger Ober ein Glas mit Pellegrino Wasser auf unserem Tisch vergossen hat wurde die Flasche am Ende nicht berechnet immerhin 10$  Unbedingt über groupon com einen Voucher kaufen! <EOR> Dined dessert Lip Smacking Food Tour  Sat outside warm night watched all hustle bustle Strip  cake unlike any cake before  even candles celebrate anniversary   aww    Service prompt informative   return full menu dining  <EOR> This restaurant took surprise stopped ate cause open when landed which super early turns 24 7 establishment  food however isn't you'd expect all night place highly recommend cinnawaffle mixed berries but any order great  Another tip ask Steven section awesome server very helpful  <EOR> We decided nice dinner last night Vegas Hexx  browsing groupon deals earlier day seen deal Hexx  menu looked pretty good when closer dinner time bought groupon decided check out   It 9pm able sit outside patio overlooking fountains which nice  Soon seating waiter took drink order asked applying groupon  He then told just show phone when bill  Okay  No problem  But then he tell more 4 hours since buying groupon  Well maybe bought 1 2 hours prior dinner   wasn't new groupon rolled same day anything  read all fine print prior purchasing any groupon habit nowhere does read must 4 hours before use it  conveyed information waiter then proceeds tell Oh SURE there  point little frustrated annoyed  reread fine print  then told wasn't policy but groupon's policy  thinking hmm  weird because earlier day purchased groupon Eiffel Tower experience literally 5 min before walking without issues  when read groupon faq's all reads most Groupons used right purchase until expiration date but may combined other specials promos   Again told 4 hour clause site  We'd walking around all day  hungry  wanting wait 3 hours more decided leave   I figure since waiter wasn't very empathetic guaranteed somehow misread fine print would ask lady door  She told apparently just meeting groupons information told but she would ask manager us  part short manager came definitely more understanding scanned groupon amazingly worked within maybe hour half being purchased    Lol  All trouble?   We seated back same table  shift change super nice waitress wish could remember name   ordered everything pretty smoothly out  spinach artichoke dip which average  shrimp scampi which pretty good  more generous shrimp expecting  boyfriend chicken waffles ate everything plate assuming he enjoyed food  plate also decent portion size  He originally ordered jambalaya although good way spicy eat comfortably  did feel food little overpriced quality but Vegas    I am glad groupon though  But guess wouldn't put off initial service if didn't groupon    Just aware buy your groupon well advance y'all  save hassle  <EOR> Came bar past weekend  excited trying Bloody Mary because read reviews saying best ones Vegas  disappointment bartender totally rude  She gave menu completely ignored after  husband even said 'excuse me' couple times when she walked but she just kept walking  Mind restaurant DEAD  time just 2 another couple bar but bartender way concentrated helping couple  ended leaving without ordering anything definitely back here  <EOR> We made reservation OpenTable all special request met when arrived  seated immediately patio just requested    We choose outside patio quieter quite lovely  waiter greeted offered three types water Pellegrino Fiji tap  reasons choose patio because see fountains Bellagio show beautiful entertainment while wait your meal    We ordered shrimp scampi spaghetti meatballs chicken parmesan!

My friend indulged 4 them during leisurely  brunch said STRONG!

I love atmosphere Friday afternoon DJ playing music  But music loud inside can't hear your server conversation your spouse  saw lot people texting tables joked  probably communicating each other because loud  recommend sitting outside if DJ playing music   BEWARE restaurant adds CNF charge your bill  Ours over $3 second day never found fee for  <EOR> Amazing food amazing drinks! come every year group trip Sean Server 2 years row he best! friendly attentive  Hexx Benedict <EOR> The service outstanding appreciated staff members clearly well trained must treated well enough content work  Kudos them management   The food somewhat disappointing terrible but great either  roasted Brussels sprouts which fine calamari which brought table just warm deep fried foods should always piping hot dressed overwhelming sauce subtle sort flavoring careful preparation hoped for    Additionally very loud dining room  server stated due all windows being closed  view fountains nice feature place  Perhaps place visit summer    Finally question $$ rating least borders if qualifies $$$  <EOR> This most favorite memorable restaurant!! boyfriend nice dinner 1st time Vegas sat window looked water show which pretty cool watch!

All meals maybe slightly above average other waffles waffles definitely above average! brunch general definitely worth price but pricier side because location course   The service very okay  server super nice just extremely slow though  I'll come back atmosphere view  <EOR> Decent brunch  Crazy Bloody Mary choices 24$ endless Mimosas else girl ask for?  sat outside which recommend   fun people watch much less noisy  Food typical brunch style  Nothing special  Service great  Perfect mid morning hangover food cure  <EOR> I best burgers ever $16 better be! However rating lowered because other item ordered  husband jambalaya he said shrimp cold  sausage chicken old  could see dried out  mixed results food  drinks great  service Maria impeccable  <EOR> Stopped Hexx drinks apps arriving Vegas Friday afternoon  perfect spot sit outside relax people watch bit  crab cake great calamari good chorizo meatballs okay  pitcher red sangria which good but definitely tasted more juice wine pretty sweet strong   However some reason bill pitcher cost $10 less said menu no complaints here!

Anyways  came wanting something savory healthy unfortunately options heapingly sweet big unhealthy options around lunch time  Boo  left chose another restaurant    That same weekend came around 2am   VERY limited menu late night  Which ok  But UNFRESH seafood were   We lobster sandwich think lobster between two biscotti's size comparison flat left Caesar salad no dressing   We ALWAYS cocktail shrimps because they're amazing but case tasted old fish warm      And hummus stale pita bread     I'll also add intoxicated quickly sobered tasting awful quality food changed Just because late night  really made think $100 bill worth 3 items? Probably not  Really disappointed because much better but just during different time but quality shouldn't change just because high traffic times do  <EOR> The food average worth price  Margarita Pizza flatbread tomato pesto basil mozzarella   decent  fiancée shrimp scampi  noodles okay but shrimp bland super oily  would only appetizer  artichoke dip amazing  <EOR> What great restaurant brunch!  place packed ended eating bar   bartender fantastic spent time recommending drinks favorite food items   She spot on   food great even accommodated daughter law's gluten allergy   only downside 2 young hostesses treated everyone line bother   we leaving restaurant somewhere else when spotted 3 spots bar   Best decision day!  back hope hostesses more professional  <EOR> The food beer amazing however only bartender staff which made service bar slow  3 total bar service still slow  wife veggie pizza prime rib Both really good  wife even liked prime rib she usually doesn't enjoy meat all pretty much vegetarian  Used yelp checkin free dessert which bonus  <EOR> Had fantastic meal today lunch hexx  Brunch amazing bottomless mimosas wonderful  food super good great menu items  Prices also very good especially atmosphere location  always very happy place  Customers always seem happy staff friendly efficient  server Sean did amazing job made dining experience wonderful  Hexx definite must when Strip!! <EOR> LOVED views here!  food delicious staff super friendly attentive  <EOR> The first time visited sweet shop  ice cream cookies both great!

Worst service ever!!!! Me husband brunch ordered VEGETARIAN OMELETTE husband ordered margarita pizza waited 40 minuets orders drinks then when when drinks food finally came VEGETARIAN OMELETTE BACON inside omelette!!    vegetarian 16 years !!!!!

<EOR> BE AWARE HIDDEN FEE YOUR RECEIPT CALLED CNF CHARGE WHICH 4 7% your total bill   very deceptive unnecessary   Heard few other places  following suit    Skip strip shop stay downtown   Between resort fees parking fees CNF fees ridiculous     I feel sorry servers because people generally leave big tip normally would   Wake greedy las vegas casinos restaurant owners           before late  <EOR> On vacation Vegas first time over Memorial Day week  hadn't eaten strip yet wanted snack concert Planet Hollywood  read reviews little cautious due suggested inflated prices unsatisfied reviews  very pleased!

Just keepin' real The Real Foodie <EOR> Nice brunch spot located Paris hotel street facing Bellagio  Friendly attentive wait staff  Food great but nothing special different your typical dishes   especially considering price tag  felt $20 omelet home fries bit much but just rolled it  space clean indoor patio seating  Recommend patio seating course! <EOR> There lot great place   great things sit outside people watch   whole lot going on   restaurant nicely decorated very modern   wanted try carrot cake pancakes accommodating letting order only 1 2 order   also ordered chilaquiles guava mimosa   Everything delicious pancakes shredded caramelized carrots between top dollop cream cheese frosting   great excuse cake breakfast   chilaquiles very tasty spicy husband probably would liked add something give kick   Between two couldn't finish pancakes   Overall place solid  <EOR> We great brunch Hexx!   staff dressed Game Thrones theme waiter Sean wore well!  Sean recommended apple cheddar bourbon chicken waffles   great!  He very attentive engaged conversation which very cool   Good service rare LA!  Hexx worth calories   Just walk strip burn off heat <EOR> Took 20 min someone even come table order  food looks good but we'll see long takes server bring us  <EOR> Had dinner last night friend until morning 3 am would given place 4 stars but 3 am she threw all dinner sick bed all day   know Vegas but can't blame alcohol neither drank last night nor did eat anything else left restaurant   She's all signs food poisoning   Which really sucks because we're town attend conference paid pockets now she's missed full day sessions   We're praying she'll feel better tomorrow   far best she small sips Gatorade   She ordered pasta dish think house specials   pretty sure listed ingredients might egg yolk   Looking back now seems odd why list egg yolk unless raw which case heck?  She thinks she remembers seeing but time giving much thought    The location amazing right across Bellagio fountain    far dinner okay   ordered spinach artichoke dip which best ever had   main course fillet which cooked exactly ordered medium but bit dry lacking any flavor other when pepper dusted before cooking happened touch tongue   very small dollop 'steak sauce' plate suppose incase pepper didn't work   tasted sauce nothing rave I'd prefer something better homemade A 1   This space used occupied Sugar Factory    really hoping eat there   wasn't until made trek Mandalay realized Sugar Factory gone   Another small positive note Hexx just opened literally   think last Friday Feb 27th first night   place still fairly empty 7 30 pm Monday night     Might empty because new might empty because friend isn't only spent next day puking dinner   I visit Vegas lot keep eye Yelp reviews see if one time fluke   Bottom line should here?  If want great view fountain fabulous spinach dip give shot   Just stay far away anything else menu might sick if cooked prepared properly   Good luck! <EOR> was little disappointed brunch here  ordered gravlax benedict really realizing salty gravlax maybe fault  general though think could've still enjoyed benedict completely overcooked eggs top  other friend ordered benedict egg poached correctly other also overcooked  just can't understand restaurant mess poached eggs consistently  i'd say best part meal tiny side mac n cheese shared among us  views atmosphere lovely but food nothing special  <EOR> Why try Hexx?   Because simply most underrated restaurant Las Vegas    I've coming since opened  restaurant unique 24 hour farm table restaurant great late night excellent lunch dinner during normal hours  food amazing quality impeccable    The manager Juan staff outstanding spot whenever Las Vegas  <EOR> We used travelzoo promotion 2 4 course dinners wine flights   Pretty disappointing   started charcuterie appetizer 2 cheeses 2 cured meats giant pretzel condiments   huge decent quality   2 simple salads also good   3 wines came just salads decent wines small 2 oz pours   Unfortunately rose white served cold but room temperature within minutes because small size glasses   Promotion still today lists sea bass which taken off menu   also lists 14 oz ribeye but menu price now higher promotion value   discussion ribeye but smallest 14 oz steak ever more 10 ounce   Way over cooked ordered med rare grey all way through   Venetian cheesecake mediocre   better cheesecake Outback   worth money even promotion  <EOR> Wonderful food amazing service! Food portions match price compared most places around here  Highly recommend it! <EOR> This place incredible especially brunch! Bottomless mimosas plus Hexx Benedict cinnamon waffle such delicious perfect combination  made experience even better amazing wait staff! Sean great! definitely come back every time Vegas! Only sad part rid chocolate candied bacon!! <EOR> Amazing service Great short rib loved Ecuadorian brownie Love French sized portions food dont over eat <EOR> the food great  hexx burger  looks strange when see white chocolate bun but actually pretty good  sweetness strong but balances salty burger  choice beers though great  <EOR> Excellent service friendly staff great food  Nice outside dining great early morning brunch  also plenty seating inside when weather warmer  staff very attentive helpful  <EOR> Sugarfactory closed place new sugar factory  candy store everything else looks exactly same except some changes menu    The drinks which previously made candy now made fruit which always great thing  still smoke both kids adults smile snap    Im b w 3 3 5 place kind wish yelp half point system increase rating half point   We came dinner lunch  Dinner definetly better experience lunch  dinner lunch menu similar except some slight differences    For dinner spinach artichoke dip appetizer shared shrimp scampi entree  dip quite tasty came chips pita chips  dip tasted much better chips stuck them but if extra hungry appetizer quite filling   The shrimp scampi delish cleaned plate away   For lunch friend ordered chicken waffles hugee dish btw another friend ordered cheeseburger  Both entrees ok  chicken definetly star dish huge portion  Easily shareable between two people third could also take some bites  Only thing didnt dont tend huge portion fried chicken just being dumped waffle thus making soggy  also plain maple syrup theirs strong cinnamony kick if order plain one  <EOR> Sean man awesome server attentive  Very good food  Highly recommended lunch spot  <EOR> Taylor waitress amazing    best spot breakfast far  Off strip Paris  Bottomless mimosas  Goood vibe food true pictures taste even better  Breakfast panckcakes potatoes amazing  Breakfast croissants die for  certainly back ever time touch down Vegas    yassss  love it! <EOR> The Hexx cool spot if Vegas  perfect any occasions fancy want if want dress casual come  environment restaurant fantastic  employees best employees Vegas energetic positive attitude always smile  servers Sean Charles attentive friendly really took care really well  food food AMAZING!

Waygu beef aged? She would answer question then list off favorites section menu even though never asked suggestions     because questions each major section could walk right now order entire meal start finish  She very nice but kind information wasn't asked nor relevant anything did ask  <EOR> Great casual dining! Big patio strip  server attentive fast  pasta husband jambalaya  Although dish vegetarian server asked if wanted chicken shrimp added shrimp which perfect! Would definitely again  leaving noticed nice little bar well might try before leave  <EOR> I don't understand why people work industries where deal people when clearly don't want bothered! waiter very unattentive acted if inconveniencing him  Even hostess sat seemed disgruntled  clearly interrupted fascinating story she telling other hostess    No worked seemed happy wasn't even busy!

Well suppose would because Mon Ami often full gills while Hexx half empty   Other though     The menu little bit something everyone including pizza two which seemed place but only little bit   items among eight listed entrees sounded good but Hexx seems mostly steak house   My wife started sharing Surf Turf Sliders creative idea which pretty good but far astounding   then each wedge salad which tasted wedge salad pretty good   entree decided try steak other usual favorites filet rib eye hanger steak   Once again good but great   Perhaps  just because hanger steak cheaper cut   perhaps not   Anyway most flavor came Bèarnaise sauce   side creamy mashed potatoes very good   wife thought Spaghetti Carbonara excellent but seriously isn't dish sort excellent definition assuming afford calories ?  Our server pleasant attentive but made significant error adding check   One last gripe which specific Hexx   Both big casino chains Strip MGM Caesar's seem insist online menus include prices   annoying   reference Yelpers meal described above two rounds drinks came $170  <EOR> My Desert Mash drink phenomenal!

TRASH TRASH TRASH!! many nice places Vegas worth even going here  general restaurant TI better service junk place  honestly wish could leave few bad reviews because people need know place VEGAS QUALITY shouldn't waste time  <EOR> HEXX newer dining establishment strip  open 24 7 breakfast lunch dinner  first experience decent but few things kept making four star review  Here's dealio     HEXX located front portion Paris Hotel Casino wraparound front side patio  great people watching taking view breathtaking Bellagio fountains  Since husband staying Paris entered through casino where hostess stand but no hostess  hate awkward feeling wondering if you're meant wait seat yourself  decided carry planned ask first restaurant employee came across  walked walked finally standing outside entrance opposite side restaurant where another hostess stand three hostesses  Just suggestion but girls might want spread bit avoid confusion   Once seated patio finally ready enjoy lunch  patio does table umbrellas light misting keep cool  felt perfect even though topped 100 degrees  Then again desert lovin' girl    The menu plenty variety all your typical Vegas prices  turkey sandwich served fries $16 but suppose gourmet price being served avocado cranberry challah bread right? still very tasty though decent portion well  rare food envy over husband chooses  more often other way around but guess off game because wanted switch plates during entire meal  did he looked appealing ask? Chicken waffles  just any chicken waffles but chicken breast tenders apple cheddar waffle served bourbon maple syrup  He gave bite $24 lunch entree he caught drooling over more once confirmed suspicion    should've gotten THAT!   Our server though sweet girl seemed bit off  She over poured ice tea nearly missing precious phone didn't seem confident answers few questions had   I'd willing give HEXX another shot due fact plenty things menu begged try them  Helloooo chocolate pancakes caramel syrup    talking you! Give better experience next time bump star  Until then    <EOR> Food drinks great  Best part server Sean! Hands down best service! Thanks Sean making bachelorette lunch memorable experience! <EOR> Great food environment  Breakfast fresh light delicious  wait time breakfast rush around 20 minutes but great shop next door where grab coffee treats chocolate concoctions  Grab seat patio enjoy Bellagio water show while dine  <EOR> Whenever Vegas stop Hexx because food really good bottomless minosas   However last stop Hexx over weekend amazing   waiter Tracy made visit exceptional   She hype woman provided Vegas experience expect when restaurant Vegas   We initially seated table directly sun without shade she spoke manager sure moved inside despite unpleasant hostess  She kept mimosa glasses filled rim made sure all having great time   Tracy entertaining genuine provided all services needed  She infinity beyond!  Thank Tracy!   This place gets really busy reservation  <EOR> Chilaqiules good  Huge portion two people could probably share  Chicken waffles best had  Place feels very hip loud music patio seating almost loud though  Staff wasn't friendly but service good  <EOR> The worst service Ive ever experienced restaurant caliber  food aweful brought different times  Two guests entrees 20 minutes everyone else   If money no object dont care quality service find place acceptable  <EOR> Terrible service  watched waitress look few minutes before she even decided come over table  Maybe she debating if she wanted wait table not  food average best  host recommended jambalaya  ordered  filled nothing but pepper spice no real flavor  going pass place moving forward  <EOR> It would 5 but charge resort fee tax restaurant!

If enter inside Paris Hotel confusing where hostess stand located sign two hostesses necessary <EOR> This place didn't impress all  ordered Chilaquiles bring mountain  chips very little salsa pretty dry  pork meat pretty tasty  order another side salsa lil better   Service super slow  seat list 10 minutes before anybody came offer water  order water take forever table   probably won't come back cs know  other places way better food fast service  China poblano example  Eggs Benedict blah! Better order them room service cosmopolitan hotel <EOR> Honestly really really wanted love place did start great but slowly downhill  probably should read some signs when first arrived  brunch probably around 9 definitely ahead usual brunch crowd yet line front see hostess table  truly didn't understand why because saw maybe 8 tables people  Once closer saw 2 woman hostess table them wasn't doing thing  would walk others table woman would just stand staring off into space without even acknowledging next person  also strange everyone before seated which most 3 tables told would 15 minute wait  Wait exactly? see tons tables open    Of course eggs benedict brunch  pretty much no brainer order if offered  far best eggs benny's ever had  wasn't served your traditional English muffin served over scalloped potatoes  cheesy delicious sad when cleared plate  Full transparency dish only reason even giving place 2 star rating  also ordered Bloody Mary meal which didn't come till food arrived asked it  Usually huge deal but given all other service issues just annoying case    So why 1 star rating without eggs benedict factored into equation ask? Because service continued down hill just disappoint me  Both friend huge yelpers take lot time write reviews check post photos etc  both checked asked free dessert offer  Even though already clearly communicated start meal wanted separate checks told 1 per table  someone rarely even yelp probably wouldn't cared but put lot hours into yelp  girls write just bad but awesome reviews well  think pretty stupid tell pick gets dessert share  people getting word you  Sure may great case but if ran better establishment could free advertisement essentially  clarify review no means way getting back them either    By time dessert already asked waiter separate checks 2 times point  2nd ask he finally brought check  combined check  ask yet again separate check  honestly irritating even ask first place  No should ever assume people paying together  should always ask if together separate  don't care more convenient you  worked food before always asked customer before ringing up  When separate checks arrived really just 1 slip separated out  then tell which card he could charge cards correctly   Honestly no should deal crap dealt restaurant  While dish amazing don't think could deal service simply eat again  <EOR> Dinner fantastic! cocktails sight    made dry ice actually smoke! must try broccolini I! loved much ordered second plate!!! Chelsea amazing server very attentive  desserts chocolate sampling delicious well  definitely back next time town  <EOR> Had chicken waffles carrot cake pancakes side bacon  Groupon breakfast ended being around $25 person but  bad Vegas prices considering Strip  pretty quiet when breakfast around 9 30AM waiter nice attentive   really liked decor very sleek modern  Would recommend if you're getting Groupon! portion sizes didn't look huge but leftovers flight back home! <EOR> We brunch such great food atmosphere came back later weekend dessert drinks  All chocolate made house delicious! <EOR> Really great experience both service quality food  ordered Chilaquiles meat lover omelet bottomless Mimosas  wish pictures but devoured meals before could bad! Sean Bobby really took care made meal memorable  Drinks never empty lots recommendations things strip  even treated sample Hexx Chocolate made house good  Can't wait come back experience dinner menu  <EOR> What great stop brunch already fantastic weekend Vegas concert! friend happily greeted waitress Tracee waited upon Jordan well  Besides enjoying wonderful company personalities ate fill veggie omelet fruit meat omelet excellent potatoes  bottomless mimosas great well worth $23  Don't surprised if takes little time your food drinks they're busy reason!

Sure if website adequate disclaimers may right respond screw similar its guests if would to   However disclaimers intended when less hour passes between quoted price someone accepting the stock market excluded    waiter returned $13 credit check since manager wasn't able find subject change without notice  ***Note all restaurateurs if 45 minutes earlier your website stated cheaper price anything corkage parking menu items someone decision dine your restaurant based comes directly your restaurant honor information your website ***  An appropriate response would Thank letting know   We'll update website course honor price time  Any other response serves litmus test anyone serving your restaurant   The food good but music loud casual conversation   Fortunately dining solo   If guest would found challenging converse   reason needing assume risk any restaurant's mistakes would return   I give 1 star value because paying valet parking almost doubles cost breakfast regular solo diner   suspect using free parking may going take much time everyday diner lunch break   My server Julio great   service score reflects overall experience which even truly service oriented server Julio can't overcome significant mishaps management  <EOR> Great place bottomless mimosas!

Nothing special $18 burger! fries average  asked server side ranch dressing  service SLOW  took good 20 min just ranch  way restaurant wasn't busy around time  ranch tasted Hidden Valley ranch bottle  Ehhhh    To summarize review slow service overpriced bland food at least lunch wish option order breakfast instead! Definitely disappointed   2 stars rating though because view Strip   But honestly would rate place 1 5 stars  <EOR> Stopped Saturday brunch morning  advised would 35 minute wait first available table place busy waited  35 minutes turned 45 which turned hour    hostess explained cleaning tables but lots lots open tables  inquiring wait time twice finally called in  brought patio but table direct sun without cover asked if could sit other five tables two outside shade  told those tables already called can't swap table another open table five feet away? Hostess gave no effort accommodate  Why would they? long wait list cares two unhappy people  walked no effort anyone stay    If type person likes hospitality quality over quantity isn't place you  They've lot work terms managing seating guests giving accurate wait times  Save yourself headache somewhere else  <EOR> Considering place open late decided eat walking around strip  ordered couple apps burger share  guacamole little bland but enjoyed pork rinds came it  charcuterie board amazing  Fresh baked pretzel meats cheeses alongside stone ground mustard awesome  bun served burger made white chocolate  Which sounds weird but really really good well  only thing offset all service  little busy patio server forgot couple times  <EOR> Came Sunday morning some breakfest  Techinically during lunch time but serving breakfest until 2 P M  french toast which good but nothing amazing! did fill up  also drinks made dry ice which smoke come cup which very very cool but once again nothing amazing  service good being day new years when everyone should groggy wanting work  guess being any wait its good quick bite but other then would probably try something else next time quick lunch  Nothing special here  <EOR> I disappointed intending going sugar factory but ended here  bottomless mimosas which disgusting because pre made all orange juice but food great   water leak roof asked moved while middle moving 2 waiters came basically screaming couldn't sit where moved to  embarrassed but manager came over offered 2 glasses champagne alcohol doesn't bad service mention prices high let's just say won't returning <EOR> We lovely breakfast place outside  food delicious staff even better! Marife sweetest! Would 10 10 reccomend <EOR> We celebrate birthday food absolutely delicious!!! single dish gushing over  number 1 word tossed around throughout meal FLAVOR  flavors just spectacular noticed meal tables lacked seasoning condiments which know means don't need them! mean even down French fries! truffle garlic came incredible mayo  Delicious  friends dad degree culinary raving veal he ordered  buffalo calamari delicious well  wish could've tried more!   The only downside menu limited  sandwiches burgers only offered lunch hoping order veggie burger  somebody doesn't eat meat can't much dairy felt somewhat limited which why chose calamari French fries  But tasted delicious filled wasn't complete let down    Thank much your service HEXX! <EOR> Stopped drink maybe appetizer  server alexia sold entire meal happy she did! crispy broccolini amazing! light crisp full flavor  boyfriend shared burger finished off bake sell which personal favorite  All recommendations excellent  She very informed menu genuinely excited serve us  Can't wait come back hopefully alexia server again  <EOR> On last day Vegas came brunch  Sat near patio because couldn't sit patio stroller   wouldn't fit  Lame! My husband ordered Chilaquiles French toast  husbands food almost spicy eat which saying lot French toast tasted little funky we're super soggy  starved say anything though just wanted eat before baby starts crying again haha  Overall average brunch  better San Jose way cheaper prices!! <EOR> This trip Vegas nothing short awesome  few bumps road all persistent street marketing teams but  all part Vegas  Luckily didn't stop experiencing great dining experience HEXX kitchen + bar  modern atmosphere made whole experience cool  All furnishings lighting decor tied into theme  food presentation very neat fun  drinks smoking dry ice food hot fresh   From extensive menu decided pancakes bacon  order came 3 large fluffy pancakes  Topped powdered sugar parted whipped butter nutty maple syrup  great syrup awesome pairing pancakes  wife enjoyed pepperoni pizza large enough two people enjoy  pepperoni pizza larger normal covered pizza couldn't see any cheese because many pepperoni  pizza topped off toasted shaved garlic  garlic looked large Rice Krispies but flavor pizza even more savory  both enjoyed bottomless mimosas great kick start day   I really enjoyed restaurant definitely back visit next trip Vegas  <EOR>
