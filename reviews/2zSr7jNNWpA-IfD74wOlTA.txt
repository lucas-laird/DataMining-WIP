Idk but back which unfortunate because close house  Maybe different graveyard bartender?  The girl servers good but wait drinks which slow too     <EOR> I don't really post reviews unless its REALLY good REALLY bad location   I'll start saying gone location few times since opened  literally pass twice day every day  location nicely decorated food good even though bit overpriced people work very friendly    HOWEVER encountered few issues  time phone ordered food picked paid cash  noticed short changed $5 $10  can't remember since beginning year  didn't really care much simply didn't anything point since figured human error rush   To avoid decided start paying card  Well     I just looked transactions when logged into account credit card noticed charged twice last time visited  first charge processed amount totaled WITHOUT tip second transaction processed card tip  annoying    Not sure if occurs just location all locations but disputed transaction without tip since second transaction tip through  decided stop going PT's altogether    Also rewards point thing sucks since must your card your points  If lose your card open new least  when member while back  would nice if could just give them phone number email address credit your rewards points track your visits purchases through phone app most other places do    Hence haven't bothered rewards system while now since lost 3 rewards cards  start new rewards card lost prior rewards points every time lost rewards card   So if PT's ensure check your bill your correct change check online charges duplicate charges    PT's big franchise Las Vegas  There's least within two mile radius deal kinds issues  <EOR> Great new bar Area  Gotta love PTs group bars Vegas! Good food service   Need check happy hour 5 7 pm 12 am 2 am  <EOR> Not bad PT's Gold location!   For PT's service isn't shabby food consistently decent  few bartenders become familiar staff they're all friendly    It opened last year bar's still fairly new inside nice clean tavern decor  never smoky which always plus  There's also plenty televisions which nice watching sports games!   I frequent location video poker drinks mostly  right corner Buffalo Warm Springs convenient bar meet drinks Southwest part town    Just don't dirty martini  asked if use any vermouth not  olive juice tastes funny  <EOR> I've passed PTs couple times waiting come since opened month ago something that  Came around 6 Wednesday happy hour! believe happy hour starts 5 ends 7 drinks half off selected $5 appetizers    I ordered chicken fries snakebite gilroy pizza table  chicken fries bomb! sure if offer appetizer other locations if new but definitely try out  Tastes just Burger King! gilroy pizza always hits spot  sure what's all but sausages well alcohol lol  snakebite good can't really mess beer know    The service alright wasn't exceptional others made seem  establishment looks much bigger outside but pretty small when come in  little sad don't really any darts pool tables anything  closest PTs home probably back  <EOR> We usually only during evening but decided late night drink   service great bartender dj he wasn't very friendly all   the service great all very disappointing  <EOR> Since when charge 2 50 pineapple back vodka shot ?? Lady rude never back !!
