If more drink forget ever getting refill  ain't comin  Actually when order diet coke expect come oops forgot Seriously breakfast ain't hard honey   might well forget your food too  Your dining partner may theirs but you'll wait 10 more minutes yours without any type acknowledgement suspect its normal because lack reaction  hostess' 2 4 visits acted server assistants  other 2 other servers brought food  Why tipping server when everyone else does your work?    cash register hostess stand situation even most non claustrophobic person want scream 'stop touching me!' Crowded understatement   The last time server ignored entire meal never said word exception 'what you?' take order but she dropped check tried start some half hearted dialogue 'our plans rest day' woman don't know you  ignoring isn't going save your tip    We'd love talk manager      but never seems hold any presence floor  Is even one? <EOR> CRACK POTATOES!

Couldn't ask better service! food great!!! <EOR> Egg Works notorious wait but if you're party  three less location out  more ideal places west side town if you're looking full breakfast over abundance sides because price offer more expect portions I would even far say maybe even much! Ordered vegetable crepe without swiss cheese sides wheat bread seasoned potatoes  vegetable crepe HUGE delicious give more seasoned potatoes need! If you're bread lover they'll give five slices meal! delicious could only finish half entire plate  Service fast friendly even more when sit bar top when just two another reason why enjoyed it    no time! I understand unusual bright lighting could problem enjoying your breakfast atmosphere maybe don't want hungover people enjoying much time grubbing mornings? but bright lighting didn't bother whatsoever and appreciated waking some! If bright lights bother outdoor porch area enjoy beautiful morning!  One better Egg Works locations Vegas very satisfied! <EOR> As always egg works knocks park once again! girlfriend came location breakfast while waiting car ABC Hyundai  quickly seated wasn't busy but early enough where everyone normally still asleep    This location brick oven pizzas such which pretty cool!
