But no worries just listened know what's happening   couple gets seated couches other side waiter well waiter high fives them smiling general good spirits might associate hookah lounge  couple having completely different experience those waitress serving us   Some time smoking drinking waters decide order food just some hummus  waitress essentially ignores even though trying grab attention grab waiter  He says grab your server standing right behind he disappears then she disappears even looking direction   She come back want order something ?  thinking order personality thought  Now several different hummuses say thinking some hummus which one     she leaves  Doesn't explain differences if comes anything nothing  Cuts off leaves  She arrives back hummus soda  Doesn't say word when she deposited food drink table leaves again   Meanwhile waiter couple couches still high fiving couple smiling joking them ever present attentive couples experience  Some more time waitress comes back everything ok ? before could ask refills comment food she splits   Doesn't even let answer her   nearing closing 1230 close 1   Suddenly she appears check   time girl decided she wanted shot   waitress deposits check table oh gonna order shot  She seems put snatches check says want ?  want?? want someone wants job  want   Anyway she returns drink check again  then comes back few minutes later asks if check ready   Now she's barley paid any attention whole night yet when she wants money suddenly she's paying attention?   say no not  now 115am   music does down bouncer starts pulling hookahs off tables she returns  give check hope great time everything hope see again no kind interaction all   leave no tip     The waiter great talking people he serving grab he what's your name Vico really great waitress terrible see actually care people's experience if come back want request you   You're great  He says sorry that   man hears complimenting dude he says hey thanks always great hear employees doing good   tell awful waitress no personality different experience those Vico had   He apologized but seemed know case     So summary place  really great hummus vibe great too   service inconsistent if lower side service you're gonna terrible experience if good servers you're gonna great time   2 stars ZERO tip low end service     ***update***  still haven't back  <EOR> Food very good legit Greek food know Hookah louge but smoky bar gaming area <EOR> Monday night Olive drug     once try try again    then introduce friends it   Well if Olive crack then drug dealer 2 new converts  BTW folks no drug use here   but caught analogy it!

I rarely side town when hood wasn't sure where eat  Thank goodness thing called Yelp  Based reviews decided try Olive    I admit when walked afraid yelpers reviewing party quotient perhaps food atmosphere dark bar like little rough around edges  expectation food low based atmosphere  seemed great place Friday night throw down but perhaps weekday lunch  beer pong pool expansive hookah room   I almost didn't order falafel pretty sure would disappointed  However couldn't resist ended falafel baba ganoush  baba ganoush arrived scene basket pita  expected average pita lurking basket but boy wrong! warm pillowy pockets divine dough    soft fresh  soon snuck may hand into basket retrieved pita knew things gonna real good  Seriously pita probably softest town  baba excellent right balance creaminess smokiness    Now falafel  appetizer plate husband ordered sandwich  When hit table thought oh no because wrap pressed pita  However presentation ended being brilliant perfect vehicle delivering falafel falafel burrito! When cut into piping hot bean ball eyes lit because saw green! Prior seen falafel Vegas parsley and or cilantro give nice green color  falafel great consistency flavor pretty delicious  may tad salty but overall impressed  Perhaps because expectations low but really want back try them again  strong contender  <EOR> We recommendation place horrible  service worst  waitress ignored only paid attention males food horrible too  beef old didn't taste good all  even tried being extra nice waitress thinking she having bad day  Needless say never back tell everyone know bad was <EOR> This review going testament AMAZING service horrible beginning night   I used come Olive years ago when lived near location   always enjoyed food service nice   Saturday night came friend first time probably 5 years  We belly dance show walking said hello few people looked seat   girls helped organize event pointed covered couch section 2 people sitting NO RESERVED SIGN   many tables signs said Reserved but did not   asked if could join couple sat down   The couple moved little while later sit closer where girls would dancing shortly approached owner     She said TON attitude section reserved   didn't seat here   can't sit here  I felt Mean Girls !
