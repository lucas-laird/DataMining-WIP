When check offer free cannoli ask cannoli but then show them yelp screen  they shout yelp cannoli instead guy getting cannoli which results getting super tiny 3 bites  literally cannoli   mean its free thats cool but something doing just feels cheap   offer free cannoli don't but giving some half pint imitation just leaves sour taste  to least  Not sure where health department grade posted   that bothers me   Also people kitchen don't wear any hair nets anything some them real long hair just flowing around   Does seem ideal set prevent contamination   Parma ham did work pizza when cooked ended super crunchy huge slices just put pizza   Cut into smaller pieces maybe?  Also pizza gets very soggy pretty fast due runny sauce moisture cheese   sure would avoided but little irritating when whole piece super flaccid few minutes   Overall pretty good although definitely no Settebello   Hopefully even better time  <EOR> It first time weren't impressed  price charging expect better  walked all staff eating lunch dining area  No said hello greeted any way  walked counter man walked seemed annoyed interrupted lunch no smile no nothing  When started say wanted he told wait asked many pizzas getting total  Just very rude  told first time unfamiliar menu  When he told 53 dollars jaw dropped  Yes should read menu but 1 00 per topping hardly give any  When sat down eat two dirty tables around us  place dead 3 employees just standing around talking  shouldn't look dirty tables while eating especially when employees standing around certainly price food paid  say pizzas did taste good that  Next time Blaze pizza where prices amazing staff friendly food great  <EOR> I twice definitely want try couple more times  heard Novecento Weight Watchers meeting all places  decided try friend's birthday    We all ordered different things could taste everything  believe Bianco pizza pepperoni pizza eggplant parm some other pizza salad top  Bianco pizza far best initial taste test    On second trip Margherita pizza which pretty bland  dough undercooked slightly burnt  Probably because cooks 90 seconds 900 degrees    As stated want try place again  am big fan Italian we'll see  <EOR> Pizza cooked perfection salad deliciously light!

Bring your own container old bottle fill take home! <EOR> Every time come into town required stop  Awesome pizza great service always clean  highly recommend place  <EOR> Overall summary Average best some notable flaws but some work could good  willing eat again if things improve   The Good Prices decent   Pizzas handmade made front Subway style   Nice classic pizzeria decor   Friendly staff   Caesar salad good albeit large isn't really large   The Bad The smoked salmon pizza was    weird  also much garlic dough little soft rest flavors muted garlic   The lighting uneven  Half soft white bulbs other half daylight bulbs  Its small thing but throws ambiance off   We weren't given plates eat pizza share salad  eat napkins   The utensil condiment basket only fork olive oil dispenser empty  some other tables grab some first three checked didn't any either   They forgot free canoli asked through Yelp promotion  <EOR> The pizza good   some issues   First all place promotes 90 second pizzas   case   took hour eat Friday night   First issue   line place order   enough staff   similar pizza places 20 people behind counter   place 4 employees hand total wait tables cook take orders bus tables clean   enough people restaurant size promotes speed sign outside   place even half full    seemed take 10 minutes waiting order   Another 10 minutes move down line assemble your pie   Another 5 pay seated   15 more food arrive     The main issue see establishment layout   menu board well past where place your order right angle read line because fluorescent lighting reflects off sign making impossible read   happens nobody decides want until counter   Then need decide crust size sauce toppings before even read sign   toppings bins no signs   can't even tell half them line no clear list menu board   Also don't usually complain but person taking orders does seem speak English very well   accent strong could tell words she speaking   She also seemed understand saying again issues layout   employee asking questions behind glass   standing front busy restaurant crying children loud TVs   hard communicate environment this   should wall behind where customers stand block sound   So anyway process convoluted     tell them size want first    Then sauce then toppings   didn't find could gotten calzone until already pizza half assembled   another beef this   only choose between 7 10 pizzas   don't know but want able choose least 14 inch pie too   eat 10 pie then some when am hungry should need order two pizzas full    menu poorly written communicating staff difficult    didn't see bottled soda prices board sold drink wanted   Sorry but don't sell any drinks stay business   Someone doing job   So ordered several pizzas sat down number table    waited waited   took no less 15 minutes pizza come table   wonder 90 second pizza take 15 minutes cook   dining area also understaffed no silverware dirty tables      pizza itself tasty   crust sort chewy good flavor well cooked   also generous toppings give them thumbs that   Margareta pesto pizza ordered white pie also ended red sauce because poor communication staff   toppings drinks expensive because dinner 3 ended costing $35 two 7 10 two soft drinks   No leftovers   wanted order some appetizers desserts but nobody asked time through ordering process literally worn out   If can't customers table within 10 minutes walking through door then need rethink your concept   Nobody should need wait long   Maybe need full table service   Another suggestion would better written menu paper handy people standing line   needs photos things especially non pizza items prices   way many things people decide while line   line move very slowly   More staff along pizza line would also help great deal   I may back but going look discount before again   3 stars = A OK   Service brought rank down   would give them 5 stars food   2 service  3 atmosphere  <EOR> This 5 star review pizza because exactly way  close enough    Fresh dough NO thick fatty crust mozzarella cheese just right amount many veggie options top  even arugula  Needless say am  fan cheesy fatty artery clogging American pizzas  Sorry if offending anyone intention    Normally when hardly ever order pizza chain pizza places feel full achy only two slices  But actually could finish entire pizza margarita pizza mushrooms basil     Cannot comment anything else menu because only pizza far  guys behind counter very nice love watching first guy spreading dough out    The place very spacious clean twice now no problems  Hopefully back soon  think found favorite pizza place except when own home grill    but nothing top that  <EOR> If you're ever Centennial area know mean when say there's ton restaurants all 1 mile radius here   fact there's really no need ever leave shopping center if you're hungry  But here's issue most restaurants franchise corporate owned   obvious pleased Chef Marc's Novecento Pizzeria opened here   Less year since opened finally chance eat here  am pizza fan but don't opportunity often  when lunch bunch Yelp friends Novecento came weren't passing it   We didn't partake $25 all Yelp eat  ended sharing pizza side meatballs  Lets start meatballs  meal itself   lot peeps rave homemade sauce but all meatball  No fillers here  Each meatball packed flavor protein   actually full couple bad boys   pizza shared Margherita which consider guiltless type pizza  much except pure taste Naples  Taste texture portions more enough  Now here's bonus half pizza only 370 calories  means zero guilt when ate half pie   I'm fan great tasting authentic gets pizza  Novecento definitely did disappoint   Novecento also offers bunch other pizzas if can't decide which then opt build your own   When mood some good pie know where when Centennial area   Novecento rock!

Shit many places would've just eaten silly mistake because fault   or least required line again but guys expected come back clear things both screwed stopped tell it   just bush league bullshit  Couple decent food unjustified hype 2 star rating  Simple that  <EOR> This place awesome!

Then over soda machine Dr  Pepper out    pizza delivered topping asked missing  send Pizza back counter add topping  clear place very poorly managed probably financial trouble which why lacking items menu  Just take sandwiches off menu if can't fulfill item! bar area hot mess needs thrown just pile throw random crap storage area misplaced items    It's shame because pizza actually fantastic!!!!    Suggestion management  business professional course understand can't always present  Invest your restaurant purchasing cameras manage your business remotely when present  Also hire someone old enough developed strong work ethic all kids there!!!!!  Clean all clutter Keep making great pizza because loyal customers     <EOR> One best pizzas ever had  much flavor really taste basil sauce  sausage mushroom onion bell pepper pizza  good!!!  definitely back!!  Mmmmmm <EOR> Friendly staff great fresh pizza! Customize perfection lots options weirder your vegan gluten allergy  gluten free  <EOR> All people work super friendly helpful! pizza good    but other prepared cooked nothing flavor really blew away    It's definitely Napoli style pizza  less toppings better  fresh mozarella really nice touch    thought overly flavorful sort sticks itself rather gets stringy when bite into it   If you're looking traditional Napol style pizza great choice  But bringing whole family getting full     quite place  bit expensive  two personal size pizza's minimal toppings $30    I'm happy tried out    but probably won't first pick when we're mood pizza  Just because preferred pizza style NY style     Oooh! Here's GREAT thing though    Gelato die for! Pistachio! YUM! again people work WONDERFUL!! Might worth trip just atmosphere  <EOR> Food okay crust tasted burnt toppings weren't all way cooked frozen pizza store tastes better this  <EOR> This closest thing true Neapolitan pizza unless fly Naples Italy goto Ma Tu Vulive! purist only Margherita  char bottom people complain supposed there   900 degree Neapolitan Pizza oven! Hence name  Met owner once told keep great work  favorite pizzeria Vegas! <EOR> Everything looked great but execution lacked   think may come down having much water cheese  Despite pizza's bottom being perfectly blackened pizzas both sloppy messes could even picked without falling apart  <EOR> Another pizzeria town? now only pizzeria!
