Plus somewhat frustrated when place isn't busy don't no love    As food  almost all curries  don't think nor remember them offering any green curry but  biggie because don't tend order green curry anyway  think all curries delicious am especially fond panang  All curries great portion meats veggies  I typically ordered chicken tofu curries both cooked well into curry   terms flavor chicken satay isn't anything extraordinary but believe portions might slightly bigger most Thai food places  Tom Kah soup excellent great balance coconut citrus broth meat  Lastly noodle dishes  particularly fan  come inconsistent  sometimes great balance flavor sauce dish other times dry overly saturated sauce    I wouldn't mind coming back again standard Thai cuisine service  shabby area  <EOR> I am never east side wouldn't found place without recommendation   place super casual homey decor feel food very comforting   chicken yellow curry mild wasn't feeling spicy sure hot since wasn't pushing it   flavors good curry wasn't watery! staff super friendly  <EOR> V good food service won't disappointed  can't believe very crowded all  Try tofu curry eggplant dinner both fantastic <EOR> I live literally right next door ping pong  very easy just hop over apartment walls grab some food here  absolute favorite thing pineapple fried rice  believe written review them before but year ago still ordering pineapple fried rice today  Curry good well but just sucker pineapple fried rice  service always great staff always very warm inviting  <EOR> Really good thai food! client vegan nervous picking restaurant but reading some reviews decided would good place  wrong! sure back some more clients before looking perfect house friends family members  <EOR> I ordered food grub hub 8pm  Restaurant closes 9  called restaurant confirm order  said 45 min hour  hour half later there's no food delivered called restaurant now no answer  think second time happened them  shouldn't take orders waste time starving people  considerate guys  Ordering food luxury  don't spend extra wait around starve disappointed  <EOR> I crispy garlic chicken   okay really crispy anything   Good but  nothing special  <EOR> Have slowly seen place thought promising downhill  Tonight's experience 1  Loud rap music hip hop playing 2  Server did pay attention any details order spice side brown rice white  extra spoon 3  Waitress gone table over 15 minutes serving food    That's enough      Would recommend point  <EOR> Always amazing mea glad restaurant near Company Sanset   All worker love everything fantastic restaurant!

I called lady said would spend $50+ food delivered all way Mandalay Bay  Well 5 girls perfect bound spend more that  Anyway delivery guy came less hour straight hotel room! 4 chicken pad Thais crab fried rice  pretty big size could last each two different meals   The only reason why gave 4 5 because better Pad Thai  Maybe because usually fresh restaurant? don't know but still good! definitely order them again when am town feeling lazy restaurant    Good food reasonable prices great customer service fast delivery! sold <EOR> Next Sunset Park order once more times per week   small quiet place strip mall miss if pay attention!  eat lot Thai food pretty much where ever try lot different places each Tom Kha Gai soup   might most flavorful one!! much flavor all dishes love it!! brown rice also fantastic if brown rice give try!!

Check  Boring! more conversation friendliness McDonald's drive thru  Presentation poor  Looks something poured buffet line  Pad see ew noodle cut short  no chinese broccoli  flavoring very good  portion small  Panang curry great  veggies beef slices good  good portion curry but poor serving rice  balanced  Self serve to go  No bye  Best received to go but don't dine in  <EOR> Food good love seafood mix curry tasty wish give more muscles but price very satisfying   Also duck curry just good    The spring rolls ok didn't practical it   Tips place give deals Groupon take them! 12 dollars 20 steal saving money good thing while trying budget your month bills want eat great   Sadly ate all food before taking pictures next time update pictures <EOR> Mainly reviewing comment prices   because listed $   spent $22 00 spring rolls larb salad iced tea    $     While add food decent   Nothing special though  <EOR> First time eating great experience arrived two other tables finishing meals sat down  12 55 meet boyfriend lunch  knew he wanted chicken Pad Sei ew 6 95 Thai Iced tea 2 75 shrimp pad thai 8 95  ordered both dishes 3 4 spicyness which wasn't spicy  thinking should ordered 4 4  Both lunch specials came chicken cabbage soup which really tasty! YUM! The food came minutes ordered which surprising but then other tables already served  boyfriend didnt arrive until 1 20 before he arrived asked friendly waitress if could warm because didnt realize he going late food would come quickly  I would defiantly come back again BF said he would come lunch again  <EOR> The food tremendously overpriced while quality mediocre best  only serve very small portions sort expected Thai restaurants however food exceedingly small  Moreover try use Groupon because only charge regular price but add restrictions  bought $40 Groupon told needed order additional $30 food    which did  When thought would around $50 turned nearly $80  Remember rules changed when door BEWARE! Personally speaking return feel BAIT SWITCH  Again    BEWARE! <EOR> One favorite authentic Thai restaurant   All staff very friendly nice   Fast service  Nice atmosphere  Great food  My favorite dish Tom Yum noodle soup yummy    <EOR> Very cute restaurant good lunch  servers staff friendly well  Always down support local Asian American businesses  Also happy serve tom yum noodle soup  You'd surprised many times don't see menu Thai spots  <EOR> I 9 28 pm  close 10  Service HORRRIBLE  Very dismissive  happened They tell sit anywhere second sit down pick menu second waitress doesn't say Hello aking want  explain literally just sat down need minute  She looks annoyed says K  but close soon  said thought closed 10  she said Soon please hurry  Then flag down ask question dismissive again  then order something she marches off  No nothing  While waiting other tables leave just literally start cleaning around feet getting mops making lose appetite  No seems even see me  Finally dish set down besides fact waitress set down marched off silence food really pretty good  Thai basil sliced beef got  Anyway waitress didn't come back  finished water  Needed more  Needed pay  Finally flag down pay  total 12 bucks wanted leave no tip but left $1    How horribly rude  close 10 customer come 9 28 feel rushed cleaned around ignored  <EOR> We locals since 09 well passed place many times  Seeing 2 smiling faces outside sign right next Sunset park  location always reason dining here   We entered very welcoming restaurant very tastefully decorated  surprisingly impressed  waitresses also hostess welcomed entered  Once seated waitress quickly returned take drink order order if ready  came often refresh drinks worked together sure customers happy  Again surprisingly impressed    Now food  started spring rolls  veggie best but good  prefer meat ones but wanted try something new  entrees Swimming Rama chicken side fried rice very well seasoned just right amount spice  Now Crab Fried Rice must try!! scrimp crab use sticky rice all come together  might ask lil more green onion since just hit spot meal   Oh love add lime water!!

The Pad See Ew pretty good but also really oily  don't think best but flavors seemed really good just because much oil! Granted hungry ate everything  Pad Thai also pretty good  didn't many complaints although really disliked curry other sister got  came really whack peanut sauce seemed solidify something  don't remember called but just good  Ick   In terms service slow  obviously because two waitresses serving everyone huge restaurant which odd concept   weren't even lot people but waitresses still took long time give water food tea and   everything  really need hire more people during busier hours  expecting bigger turnout?  Anyways food's pretty good  wouldn't mind coming again really but just need amp service  <EOR> I Ping Pong Thai  Seriously  someone frequents Thai places best isn't downtown strip overpriced    Lets cut chase place strip mall Sunset  unassuming  drive right past if aren't paying attention  place clean staff friendly attentive long aren't during personal lunch breaks come now everyone needs break    I personally ordered Thai Basil Chicken Tom Kha Gai soup Beef Jerky Panang Curry Chicken Pad Thai  absolutely LOVE Thai Basil Tom Kha Gai soup  ingredients fresh dishes spicy if them   sure check spice levels! server state levels 1 10 another stated 0 5  tip skimp spices if spicy stick 0 1!
