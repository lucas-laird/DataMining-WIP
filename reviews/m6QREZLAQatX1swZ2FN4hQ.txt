After ordering latte discovered talking owner several Cuppa locations town  She very friendly answered several questions had  Latte excellent overall experiance something your way for  <EOR> The location OK although nearby parking scarce   find parking couple blocks away theater   The problem pastry isn't well cooked coffee doesn't taste very good service exceedingly slow   On positive side seating ample shop air conditioned   Honestly think Starbucks Samba Latte both much better choices  <EOR> Nice little new place!  Coffee good nice change big Seattle liberal hangout  <EOR> Wasn't impressed    Went slow Tuesday around 1 ish wasn't great   The menu opinion confusing no prices listed anywhere normally coffee stuff  also written chalk SUPER wide menu hard see whole thing  Unless drink order every coffee shop you know one menu isn't helpful basically just flavors   The biggest issue ordered pastry coffee wasn't given time coffee came out  wait around it  When barista noticed waiting something  she let know she'd grab minute  Meanwhile she kept making other drinks having conversation customer  Waited 5 10 minutes pastry handed me    Barista apologized wait but     c'mon  see standing around 5 minutes waiting instead taking 5 seconds step away drinks you're making grab pastry glass container   instead wait 5 10 minutes while finish all drinks that ordered WAY already waiting   Just little things frustrating    Overall sense bar flow order things made processed wasn't very efficient but coffee good  But good enough deal everything else  probably won't return  Waiting long pastry + awful menu + *that* great coffee isn't worth me  <EOR> Was excited here  10 30am Saturday very loud band playing inside coffee shop  also took most inside tables  loud hard order hear your name called your drink food  2 other people could even hold conversation with  When asked girl calling names name she said she didn't even answer she just said your's  Uhh ok but 2 other people well  She looked confused told sandwich was   not but what  Once finally all food drinks 3 sat tiny table outside could hear eachother  coffee pretty good  Food alright but definitely worth experience  <EOR> Great coffee  Cute coffee shop feel  Awesome live music  place frankly dirty  seats tables clearly needed cleaned  busy isn't surprise  wouldn't stop going back rating them high however  <EOR> Quiet little coffee shop just other location great place read book study  free wifi plus  Plenty seating inside patio  Perfect place come morning cup coffee if aren't looking regular buzz chain shop  hope keep around wonderful shop! <EOR> A great much needed addition Downtown Summerlin! iced caramel latte delicious  espresso great flavor strong enough drowned sugary caramel  Spacious inside seating wide variety books plenty outdoor seating too  If only if scrumptious pastry dessert selection would've 5 stars me! <EOR> Ok love place   Right downtown Summerlin   open  7 weekdays 8 weekends   Plenty books read staff very friendly   Nice decor excellent drinks   Prices spot on   return! <EOR> A much needed addition DTS  Cuppa opens early 7am weekdays 8am 9am respectively Sat Sun well before any businesses open  am sure appreciated DTS employees those looking early cup without crowds   Holly crew excellent latte offer variety goodies enjoy along your fav bev  comfortable patio well plenty indoor seating    ******This store now closed  Snother coffee store suppise open soon  Makers Coffee believe   If suggestion would add umbrellas patio  ne needed warmer summer months coming on  <EOR> I love coffee thought would cool place check but nothing special  just regular coffee shop Downtown Summerlin  coffee fine but no need comeback  <EOR> They recently opened already favorite location clean fairly spacious there's huge community bookshelf patio area  addition coffee drinks menu few pastries bagels sandwiches light bites  when stay awhile dine in ceramic mugs enormous your drink size practically double! <EOR> I come all time work really close  Downtown Summerlin really expensive but place inexpensive must if you're looking cup coffee bagel pastry your morning meal! work inside random office building Downtown Summerlin Mall appreciate place Cuppa simple fact eating mall gets pricey   I'm talking $20+ freaking sandwich some chips!

time DT Summerlin legitimate coffee shop   granted location isn't accessible drop shop i e  if wanted come study you'd lug your stuff through mall  unless right when opened parked street    There ample seating atmosphere nice lively    I brought pups Sunday morning right when opened  beverages tasty albeit typical cafe selections prices  croissants delicious  yet try breakfast selection but anticipate good also  also serve meals such sandwiches quiche etc   I really patio seating area  enclosed let your dogs roam around bit as long patio empty when without fear them running into street  You're also allowed bring pups inside while order    I met Holley proprietor cafe she very nice responsive  She told they're hosting Canine Coffee May 20th  also able speak hosting meet dog group which she very willingly accommodated  <EOR> Finally Downtown Summerlin home coffee shop  nearly three years customers no longer rely tiny Starbuck's Macy's caffeine beverage  past Monday just down pedestrian pathway Macy's Cuppa      Cuppa just Downtown Summerlin needed  comfortable space relax caffeinated beverage bakery treat sandwich  Today relaxed first cup drip coffee then hazlenut late  Relaxed key word because plenty seating arrangements relax  ironic visit coffee house caffeine boost yet end hanging couple hours mellow      Cuppa did fantastic job creating inviting third place which term hangout spot outside home work  evident before stepping inside  Bordering pedestrianized streetscape heart Downtown Summerlin commodious patio attached Cuppa gives passers subconscious message place stop relax  cool April afternoon place enjoy hazlenut late  patio furnished tables sofas  ideal spot Downtown Summerlin people watching  inviting environment also permeates large coffee shop  walls adorned pictures funny sayings  Halfway into coffee shop library surrounded plush seats  Bordering left wall plate glass windows overlooking Downtown Summerlin  right counter takes large portion        walked counter two occasions order  overhead menu made ordering simple  Off menu ordered medium coffee costed $2 55 then later medium hazlenut late came around $5 25  Both times friendly batista welcomed me  both times mug      thought more highly hazlenut late coffee  deals where quality high but personally did agree taste  those deals where several people would greatly appreciate it  personal taste thing  Maybe next time try pour over  other hand hazlenut late taste preferred  nice list flavors create late  Next time switch around another flavor  must add sweet taste sugar free syrup      Cuppa missing piece completed Downtown Summerlin puzzle  Finally 2 5 years Downtown Summerlin home coffee shop where spend time relaxing setting quality caffeinated beverage  <EOR> And soon arrived   it gone    I just found Cuppa's last day Tuesday bummed  Because basically LIVE Downtown Summerlin SUPER bummed great coffee shop leaving quickly!  It's super cute place few book shelves full books peruse great array drinks food  guys bulletproof coffee!! Granted haven't overly impressed coffee overall   it's worth ambience location  SUCH killer location coffee shop really surprised didn't better  Though based all recent closings seems many restaurants Downtown Summerlin  The only other coffee shop mall Starbucks unless count espresso bar weird guy's clothing store where everything always 50% off  I'd love another coffee shop move into place I'd even if Starbucks just relocated spot instead Macy's!   Goodbye Cuppa nice while lasted  <EOR> This place such disappointment! love coffee shops  love warmth service seeing variety drinks   coffee shops happy places quite opposite    First off customer service terrible  young man took order made drinks sounded he forced rather enjoying job  said first time he made no suggestions  tried ordering some pastries but all he said we're no sorry other suggestion else may like  store lost money because decided food elsewhere just order drinks    The drinks did order green tea lemonade slush iced chai  slush okay  great but bad any means  Just something I'd order again  chai where most let down  personally base good coffee shop off chai chai gets 0 stars me  entire cup filled top ice barely any drink drink  Also chai doesn't even taste chai  literally tastes watered down horchata  If wanted horchata would spend 1 4 money horchata Roberto's    Lastly rude barista never replied when said thank drinks boyfriend made point say bye thank left  no surprise barista nothing say response  would never back again know lot people Downtown Summerlin way sure no wastes money here  <EOR> The people super nice  cold brew perfect    try cinnamon roll croissant awesome    Ask them heat up  <EOR> The staff friendly mall needed coffee shop  still prefer Starbucks unfortunately  Also kids friendly which great House moms meet but if want peace quiet maybe place you  outdoor seating nice when cooler outside  <EOR> Fabulous tasting Latte! Cuppa great place extraordinary coffee atmosphere occasional sandwich when feel it  Don't worry also offer pastries your mouth water smell your mind melt flavor   Glazed cinnamon roll lemon bars can't overlooked   I've always coffee fan coffee shops easy lazy but rare find place checks all boxes Cuppa DEFINITELY checks all boxes  <EOR> I believe 3rd Cuppa location other two locations extremely pleasant staff!  Coffee always 'good last drop' Delicious well! drinks 'spot' made immediately upon ordering  Cuppa staff always making sure tables kept clean tidy   Food always fresh however normally order caffeine 9 10 times into Cuppa <EOR> DTS needed coffee shop  desperately hoping something similar Tivoli Village offers  husband ordered iced chai tea lattes  adequate though dominating creamy flavor  Could used boost spices think    I want see Cuppa well think should take some things into consideration The seating looks haphazard really disorganized eye  Tables placed wherever turned way that  also doesn't seem there's enough tables    The empty bookshelves looks sad messy  openly encourage lending library buy filler books   There doesn't seem enough outlets    The patio needs umbrellas  <EOR> What nice find Downtown Summerlin!  Great little coffee shop inside outside seating   Nice menu super friendly staff!  look forward stopping again! <EOR> I'm obsessed place   can't believe haven't tried glazed croissant until now! breakfast sandwiches beautifully quickly made   Bacon Egg Cheese croissant fabulous even iced green tea light perfectly brewed   Smiling faces early open quick service excellent food!  perfect! <EOR> FINALLY!!! waiting good coffee shop open Downtown Summerlin foreverrrr! Lol  especially glad Cuppa since always fan Russell location nice local coffee shop Summerlin area isn't Starbucks chain    First off GREAT coffee! am absolutely love White Mocha Latte almond milk reasons keep coming back here  friend also tried Lavender Latte agreed bests! Definitely recommend those drinks sure  Matcha Latte alright really wanted but couldn't really taste green tea flavor    Second love nice study spot! Keep mind doesn't lot outlets tad bit noisy when gets busy but love going since closes 9pm which later most! nearby house which plus since other coffee shops stay open late pretty far me    Third outdoor patio ideal those love bring pups! always DTS dog patio enclosed gate don't worry your dogs running off lol    Fourth love atmosphere good amount seating inside outside  even nice little library books if just wanna enjoy cup coffee good read!  They offer pastries some savory croissants but menu food isn't much  also great customer service pretty fast making your coffee    As nursing student definitely happy finally great coffee study place DTS! <EOR> Decent coffee decent espresso fairly comfortable seats friendly staff  many outlets but think saw few  Probably only place worth going all shopping area terms food  <EOR> So excited great coffee shop DTS  Coffee sweets service great  Welcome neighborhood  <EOR>
