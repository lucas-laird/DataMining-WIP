The hostess very nice seated right away   waiter came over right away he attitude   When asked if any flavored lemonade iced tea he told yes   When asked flavors he told pink lemonade which lemonade flavor regular iced tea which iced tea flavor!  obviously he did understand question correctly answers very condescending     I told needed few more minutes please come back   When he came back still hadn't decided could tell he wasn't happy having wait us   Instead being polite checking back few more minutes he decided ten minute conversation table next completely ignoring us     After being talked down then ignored leave only THEN waiter asked if wanted order something   told NO going somewhere else better service   He happily smiled said O K     I NEVER walked restaurant life!  But certainly wasn't going spend good money talked down ignored waiter   waiter does any way reflect class Mandalay Bay such poor service provider employed hotel class no idea   recommending restaurant any one! <EOR> Unfortunately Yelp doesn't let no stars   Otherwise would gotten zero   also don't think read reviews because still suck   late breakfast early lunch   counter took forever!  workers behind counter no concept time   Also no dining area family just sat down Manager told them couldn't sit there   Um    no place   Also people wanted breakfast but since don't really breakfast she must told least 10 people walked away   don't know but need change ways   Oh food   Well croissant wasn't exactly fresh coffee ok but all worth paid for   Also going pay $14 bagel lox???  am just saying!  If Mandalay Bay do yourself favor DON'T GO! <EOR> food expensive food great experienced better BUT fries good  would come back here?  probably not <EOR> If actually chance check place Yelp would passed   My friends looking place grab something light going Noodle Shop until saw menu   Oh hells no cannot justify spending much noodles when them fourth price SGV   recommended place because thought just burger joint   I'm sorry suggested place!  good!  French Onion Soup sweet used cheddar cheese???!?!?!?  Also really no soup because all bready!
