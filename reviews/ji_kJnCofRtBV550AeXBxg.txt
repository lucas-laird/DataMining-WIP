Well better late never! If you're familiar BA LE Sandwiches Hawaii location ain't anything it  I came opening week few months back lot things saw looked delicious   Out came familiar face street the owner Dakao knew sandwich gonna good am now was fan Dakao  ordered #1 Dac Biet few other things when time pay owner said machine broken on opening week? Luckily Lincoln just sandwich which good   A recent clip Action 13 News' Dirty Dining series featured Cathay House Ba Le over various violations which caused both businesses shut down temporarily clean act  Simple things employees washing hands mold maintaining clean kitchen storing baguettes uncovered cardboard boxes food thawing outside no refrigeration  shortcuts foodhandlers take Sanitation 101  just hate thought wondering  other spots Chinatown other free standing ethnic eateries around town  know lot places continue same practices  Its only matter time if when caught  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter ZERO!  *You playing Russian Roulette any time dine especially ethnic spots around town which tend take shortcuts when comes foodhandling sanitation <EOR> I'm thinking same Bale Sandwich Alhambra Ca   asked lady but she said owner wasn't she didn't know    The #1 Banh Mi Dac Biet okay   kinda puny left couple layers meat marinated veges   lady friendly though smiling lot making recommendations   11 00 am only customer   Lee's Sandwich looks cleaner better layout display although prices more  <EOR> Another beloved exotic eats place Hawaii turned upside down franchising!  Ba Le Hawaii most decent places Vietnamese food!  introduced it   time Ba Le Sandwiches snack came your Hawaiian Airlines flight Hawaii West Coast!    Let elephant way first   Ba Le Big Lots all wrong signing mentioned another review   Two separate words  BA   LE!  BALE!  funny!  Dunno messed signage looks franchise owner wasn't watching crew day   Being fan Ba Le back when used live Maui upon entering location kinda let down   mean middle lunch   no rush?  Empty tables?  Limited signage foods numbers?  What's going on?  All BAD signs   should turned around left   But bit bullet walked counter   Only picture menu sandwiches   Nothing noodles bowls ones used remember   Banh Mi sandwiches run average price all other places town between $3 $4 each   ordered #1 House Special D B  otherwise known Dac Biet   $3 65   Upon ordering sandwich checked other items most Viet places wrapped counter   love some Shrimp Spring Rolls but ones sitting counter $3 pretty warm touch?  Pass   weren't even sitting cooler fridge normally don't mind long fresh hour ago but didn't bother one   Super warm!  sauce looked bit more watery like   Could tell sitting possibly early morning   Hello salmonella!  Took good 5 7 minutes sandwich come back kitchen   came wrapped required white paper rubber band around   still nice toasty outside made back 5 minute drive back office still warm   Upon opening sandwich very average   Meats but pretty scarce   Smaller portions pate cold cuts head cheese would like   bread good size a bit smaller Dakao but crunchy outside chewy inside intact   veggies sparse textured would them love fresh snap!  happened jalapenos?  Mine missing   sandwich didn't enough mayo mix ran bit dry especially towards end bread   Overall just OK sandwich   price would expected more ingredients   It's funny hard sandwiches   I'm sure back Ba Le or BALE anytime soon trying pho   Each table missing key condiment Viet food hoisin sauce!  didn't see bottle anywhere!  Maybe hide back something   probably give them another chance sandwich just eat comparison   Ba Le should run similar special Mr  Sandwich Dakao   buy 5 1 free   Maybe attract more customers?  hate see place never busy   The lady taking order very pleasant time around no bad service me   However take note   no cards!  Cash only!  Luckily $5 emergency bill handy wallet pay     Ah Ba Le Sandwiches   how miss so   BALE place supposed your franchised stores just isn't cutting far   Please fix fix fast! <EOR> Yesterday eating pho same plaza guys decided worth shot pick sandwich to go  chose banh mi dac biet #1 which $3 65  other sandwiches just $3 45   I've heard guys same owner Dakao which offers $3 25 sandwiches  means Ba Le should little better  can't really distinguish two shops' offerings unfortunately  Maybe there's slightly more meat but there's still major dearth veggies overabundance bread which again why don't typically Subway   top some cilantro did reach sandwich yellow  Spoiler alert good cilantro yellow   I've grown appreciate pho offerings Las Vegas recent weeks but still sold banh mi thit all  If want experience type sandwich would better wait until you're good place California  <EOR> Shout Nelson Q having good eye letting know business opened today! myself down 30 minutes heads up   Dedicated!  I arrived expecting chain  based Hawaii  Unfortunately independently owned all Bale used back home but  where disappointment ends  owner seeing sad expression enthusiastically told much better place looking for   lot live since childhood memories pate banh mi   I came knowing going order pate sandwich but didn't see menu  Upon asking told could pate sandwich asked if wanted without butter  opted no butter letting pate own rich thing   The sandwich huge only $2! sure if regular pricing grand opening pricing seeing all other banh mi $3 45 which own pretty competitive Vegas  The bread crusty crisp outside while light buttery inside perfect! Way better Mr  Sandwich par Dakao  vegetables just right cut richness smear chicken pate which actually minimally applied  cilantro provided herbal kick love dearly  Jalapeños heat  Sriracha because   Well   Sriracha every table equipped it  Based bread veggies alone major banh mi contender LV China Town strip   They offer lot soups deli items well though sandwich just right unable bring myself sample anything else   And nice plus hot jasmine tea brought when sat down brewed just right bitter    Update! speaking owner he also owns Dakao road but he says he likes bread better because different oven  = <EOR> The food place sad restaurant service itself even sadder  new restaurant think need work few kinks overhead lighting super quiet interior  quiet bright harsh place felt overwhelmed while sitting eating food    As food asked banh canh soup house sandwich  banh canh tasted alright despite odiferous emission coming off it  why noodle pink!? Meanwhile house sandwich little hollow limp looking  tasted good otherwise    Just additional note shouldn't cleaning floor while customers inside eating  strong pinesol bleach scent does intertwine well whatever eating    Oh isn't Ba Le ?? should space between ba  le sign front otherwise  name place bale bale hay  Just sayin'! <EOR>
