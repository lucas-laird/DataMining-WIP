Joe waiter he extremely polite point! MOMENT he noticed drinks empty he fill them when weren't he still came by  Very impressed Joe's service!!! Thank You!!! <EOR> Ok only came eat Cannery Buffet because closest neighborhood   As being local Las Vegas over 20 years never seen lower quality food life     It's hard understand why wouldn't just put littler portions food instead just letting large amounts food sit just turn into most nastiest looking food you've ever seen   I'll admit salad bar pizza descent      But it      Prime Rib nothing but fat if would let post picture  food picked would totally disqusted grossed out! photos show HUGE LIE should deamed false advertising!
