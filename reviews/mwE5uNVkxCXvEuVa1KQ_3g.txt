Also crowded bar pool tables  Definitely new spot! <EOR> Update convenient bartender give receipts individuals group they've paid  Definitely need file dispute somewhere sure doesn't become common occurrence!  I would rated place 4 stars if wasn't end where bill incorrect bartenders' Ryan G  response  way just because last ones leave  leave tab open ourselves group 5 people others charge shit onto card bartender no right allowing people charge onto card even add items weren't paid because he couldn't pay attention  Did he pocket cash ended responsible two added items very possible  constitutes fraud management should keep closer eye guy  If guy then bar taking advantage large isolated groups come adds items weren't ordered increase profit    We ordered two sex beach pomagranite punch whiskey sour ordered water not bottled before shift change  Then end ordered two tequila shots somehow wings AMF drink added tab when decided leave close tab    I tried ordering tequila shots earlier night but Ryan busy showing some customers cellphone instead left returned counter bit later quarters pool table again  tried hand tip getting coins but he just turned around walked away handing quarters ended being placed under rubber mat counter  Kind explains why tab ended incorrect because negligence lack attention he pocketed cash paid other group decided use since paid credit  sure keep ask receipts if part your group pays cash   AGAIN BEWARE leaving your tab open reasons above which why skeptical leaving open first place but since wasn't busy Monday evening thought would ok  terribly wrong was  fair overcharge customers because couldn't your job properly?  Pool tables cost $1 each game uses quarters only maybe just works better coins   came little before 11pm unfortunately didn't names original bartender waitress  He great seem sense humor brief encounter waitress good could better she seemed she didn't want didn't seem happy when told sister still deciding first legal drink should only few minutes since arrived  She warmed bit later very attentive frequently coming back check apologized taking long bringing boyfriend water he requested  Both definitely better providing service Ryan did    Restrooms clean plus  Large area hang yes bit smokey  smell once pass first set doors  may may return establishment   since first experience turned this    I really hoping could come back place take advantage loyalty program versus going PTs Sierra Gold all choices Downtown area  But plenty other bars more games better service around town gladly take customers <EOR> Consistently phenomenal  All Bartenders game  Super friendly accommodating   Menu great  mention handsome Tuesday rocks  Yeah John Patrick <EOR> The service terrible! group friends bon voyage lunch  took them almost hour iced tea  practically beg silverware   food arrived 40 minutes   completely forgot group members order charged extra 1 50 someone ordered extra gravy  Despite everything through servers did much demonstrate hint empathy  didn't seem care all  worst part if it  am exagerating  definitely going back  <EOR> Patrick Mo rock! awesome Martinis feel comfortable always drinks ready when walk in  definitely return because them  Great happy hour well!

As good food reason 2nd star regular would become living working just down road won't returning  Which saddening since Molly's closed food good    Don't expect stay seats may choose common courtesy establishment unless Brianna  <EOR> First Likes  Liked hamburger it tasty    Liked beer it cold    But even won't return but perhaps just clientele want   neighborhood pub video poker decent food chill ambiance isn't place that   jukebox nightclub loud!  good chunk people hollering communicate another perhaps attempt ensure being understood but just added cacophony place   Some people might dig feel home place where can't hear yourself think but  thing   really soured experience other rowdy patrons   rowdy fun way but rowdy obnoxious way   People angrily scream f bombs some sort misguided attempt attention   Looking 'round customers staff all clearly annoyed but no bar took initiative quell brewing storm   cashed bailed saw inevitable confrontation between those folks patrons came good time  <EOR> Great service loose machines good food cool atmosphere  more want local bar! Also music point! <EOR>
