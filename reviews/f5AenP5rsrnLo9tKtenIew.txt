The management seems nice enough  Clearly owned managed actual chinese people suppose ought somewhat reassuring when seeking any sort ethnic cuisine  lunch special well priced 6 bucks included egg roll   The egg roll your average spring roll  Probably would nice if served some sweet sour sauce but lazy ask some  I ordered szechuan chicken item don't always see your typical chinese fast food restuarants  decent  fair amount sliced chicken served sliced onion bell pepper carrots ginger glazed dark sauce  quite salty did require additional soy sauce imagine already added spiciness seemed come some sort pepper oil  spicy enough satisfy palate  didn't feel need ask additional hot sauce  satisfactorily filled thanked them pleasant meal   The verdict Nothing special say your run mill sit down chinese restaurant  food quality good enough earn your business but don't think worth going your way for  could probably find tastier food PF changs honest but guys aren't bad deal if find yourself spring valley area  <EOR> me bf decided try place day even though many chinese places impresses most time   but both agreed food actually really good  tastes fresh  wonton soup amazing surprisingly they're very generous w putting shrimp wontons it  mongolian beef also delicious  overall recommend try it  mom pop kind place dont see those places much anymore  very affordable too! <EOR> PUBLIC ALERT!!!

Jenny Chad Debra   you're all right   fault looking any reviews until checked picking order   actually considered bringing whole bag back refund without trying any it     Then Yelper denial kicked in   thought Well   Jenny's review few months ago ordered different stuff maybe better     Everyone Chinese bad be??  OH BABY BAD!!!   Their family dinner special looked enticing   2 entrees soup pork fried rice 2 egg rolls crab rangoon $24 99   usually means leftovers but actually meant straight garbage reality   Hot sour soup give them credit soup being hot   1 2!  Nice job   am sure managed soup bland very oily but did     Chicken broccoli quality chicken rubbery   chihuahuas enjoyed gave 3 5 Yelp stars     Shrimp garlic sauce When last time garlic sauce red uber sweet?  Eff chef     Pork fried rice best worst still lacked lot flavor     I such disbelief actually called them let them know bad all was   person spoke said they'd save phone number I'd free entree next time order   HA!  Maybe if contemplating suicide!  I would advise all reviewers bestowed 5 Yelp stars Cheng's Express avoid Chinese restaurants KJ's HK Star Wendy's Noodle unless you've consulted neurosurgeon first because your brain would EXPLODE if ate any those spots  <EOR> My bf eat often  He's San Francisco Chicago both live cities authentic China Towns VERY picky Chinese food! Cheng's Express delivers both flavor service! He War Wonton addict am huge BBQ Port Egg Foo Yung fan never disappointed  combination fried rice excellent chock full shrimp just full chicken pork  fact small mom pot adds its charm family awesome very personable  bonus   they deliver! <EOR> Oh Good God  NO!  I stopped other day lunch because weekly run lunch pricing meeting  wasn't mood getting everyone else thought Chinese long lunch special why not?  So tried did  never again   You walk helpful friendly  place big clean   Of course your typical standard Chinese fare   menu big many many choices    I spend least ten dollars could use debit card ordered pot stickers which cost same lunch special figure  chicken garlic sauce fried rice    Okay truth told am never satisfied fried rice Chinese place because know good fried rice but most fried rice any Chinese spot always bland under seasoned don't much gripes when comes bad fried rice  pile sriracha soy sauce work somehow    However chicken dish NASTY  chicken tasted pieces rubber chicken slightly chewy but chewy  don't know can't explain  just odd  flavor sauce off just good  broccoli dish fresh could see yellowness it  Bad idea cook serve customers  Yeah just didn't it   Pot stickers saving grace place  Only reason gets two stars because could did eat them    Good thing only paid $6 00 lunch special  But let's just say paid $6 00 very upset stomach rest day    Pass stop Go  If deserve directly jail  <EOR>
