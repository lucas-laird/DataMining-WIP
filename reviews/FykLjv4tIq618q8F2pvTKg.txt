Anyway Krazy Buffet isn't bad all kind most buffets couple times find 5 6 things  like   It almost worth going just chicken stick  <EOR> We heading down mountains we're hungry   Some wanted sushi while some wanted crab legs   We'll Yelp way diwn found place    find sure  everyone's appetite satisfied   even pocketbook! <EOR> Here Sunday afternoon lots cars parking lot thought would see why   $11 99 all day price bad but little high Vegas   Food average didn't find anything special here   Crablegs worth effort sushi good few choices   Frogleg batter really really salty  Place feels cafeteria   Probably never back but much worse other chinese places   Deserves 2 5 star rating  <EOR> We stopped spotting while driving down Rainbow Blvd   we're disappointed!  could believe variety high quality options including fresh sushi crab legs   place packed food does sit long   create your own bowl which would cook your own creation  great vegetarians   found several foods thoroughly enjoyed ate much end!  many things wanted try   really liked friend bananas   Yum! <EOR> I fan old Krazy Buffet fan new one   If you've never best asian buffets   Sushi really good  tonight some best salmon nigiri awhile including regular sushi joints   Dinner $11 49 believe send $1 10% off coupons semi regularly   almost 5 stars but Pacific Seafood Buffet being $7 49 dinner without coupon having better selection just can't   But Krazy Buffet wins customer service sure! <EOR> Mediocre food very small even Party Room   don't think worth amount pay even 10% off   imitation crab sushi weird texture because pre frozen thawed out   desserts aren't even very good white rice hard oily some reason   The service good waitress very efficient polite  only reason 2 stars  <EOR> Krazy Buffet far favorite asian buffet  Ive always came satisifed  food always fresh when visit location area where choose your food them cook ala mongolian bbq style   Im hooked !! <EOR> Me wife came other four family members try place OK welcome front desk typical asian dude aggressive look may manager     really surprise service food offering buffet  Verity small but small containers food fresh quick change   I three attempts whole bunch crab legs muscles other seafoods   breaking start them   Sushi bar     most sushi sitting long time cant even eat bcos dryness  Dessert OK know offer much $10 $11       But want tell more thing waitress girl never seen buffet lke kind fast service she deserve extra $$$ tip finally We back sure     <EOR> Wanted try something new because usually China Star  looked Krazy Buffett thought sounded decent  seated right away drink order taken  All food looked great very colorful  When sat down drink missing ask it  finally brought other drink which tea but no straw  ask straw  Long story short waiters did nothing very cold unfriendly   ask refills drinks then brought man tea pepsi cups  didn't even dump pepsi first tasted funny  only thing did fast bring check  Just weird vibe place no wanted work  Seamed stood around talked language more anything  Service   no bueno <EOR> A 3 star sure   For place a Cheapy Chinee Buffet fits bill   Nothing served all impressive but least most part place clean   pricing doesn't impress much other Chinee buffets around town same price cheaper same type food same quality   swear expect Cathay House type food!  Totally different!  All usual suspects Krazy Buffet Fried Rice Chow Mein Beef Broccoli Sweet Sour Pork Orange Chicken which way Panda Express does better haha Egg Rolls Egg Fu Young Mongolian Beef various types faux shi fake 'California' roll type sushi Won Ton soup Hot Sour soup   Quite number dishes   also option Mongolian Bar included price where pick your veggies raw meat serving line chef du jour in case young Mexican kid named Pablito  or Jose? cook them teppanyaki manner     For American crowd added Fried Chicken Wings the MSG added ones Buffet @ Asia them much tastier French Fries pizza kids too   pizza Chinee buffet somehow good?  Must cheese?  some secret MSG sprinkled top good measure?  Hmmm      There's decent looking salad bar but dessert bar little lacking   Come love some mini chocolate powdered donuts    but Chinee that?  course chocolate vanilla soft serve machine     Food ok tasty if you're hungry dime budget   fill but somehow leave feeling empty   Then 2 hours later hungry again!  Asian boy yes part Chinee trying racist   no joke me   Seriously   ate fill left feeling lil' bit queezy   Then few hours later hungry again!    Of course dinner may better but don't know   way cheap Chinee moment pay $12 per person dinner   feel options better dinner another buffet same type although mention names   But think might already earlier review   bad!    Krazy Buffet good option those tiny budget but don't weak stomach!  Don't if you've sensitive tummy   know place touts don't use MSG but man some food bit salty side!  sure extra glass water wash down   perhaps fortune cookie too  <EOR> This place worth going too  eating moment opened but only shrimp crab unagi sushi  dont really eat anything else love seafood part its far house when want eat crab evening teens love coming never sick  nothing ever smells its old  crab ever single night which wonderful if want crab shrimp come eat away its price never changes  <EOR> Let start off saying tried both lunch dinner weekend dinner only time go   Why?  Because oysters crab legs crab clusters green shell mussels crayfish clams   case didn't notice all seafood   If don't seafood don't bother going dinner   Also don't if can't eat $20 worth crab legs only paid $11 for   worth price you   Seriously if don't seafood then it   If seafood snob also place other words don't bother if ask questions seafood responsibly sourced?  Salmon farm raised line caught?    Just don't bother   also place impress date   Romantic? Nope   Fancy?  Nope   Dressy?  Wrong again   Casual all way   And accept simple fact it best place world eat but price bad   lot really crappy food pans but also few items really crave   servers work hard always take away empty plates bring drinks take care whatever ask     I only ten items eat enjoy them   don't deserts  don't sushi   occasionally eat some Mongolian BBQ   focus hot cold seafood   Shrimp crab oysters mussels clams crayfish fish   all   Where else Friday AYCE real crab $12 99 ? <EOR> The food OK its any typical Chinese buffet restaurant could find east coast  But must say sushi section great along crab legs had  <EOR> Lunch best time go  Hot sour soup buffet  good is  only fairly good Chinese buffet north west  <EOR> We tried restaurant first time last night really enjoyed it  friends live close eat often decided give try  weren't disappointed     I started off nice steaming plate Mongolian BBQ put together myself veggies meat wanted  ended getting noodles beef chicken shrimp sprouts onions mushrooms bell pepper broccoli  didn't add any sauce because when cooked came perfectly seasoned whatever guy poured grill  meats tasted very fresh beef especially tender  A+ Mongolian BBQ!  I each several sushi choices  nice array different rolls choose from  Very nice selection  only thing sushi say lot them tasted same seemed use lot same ingredients imitation crab mainly   However did very good selection sashimi could try all different types meats way   The hot food section didn't quite much variety other bigger Asian buffets but delicious  especially enjoyed Sea Bass cream cheese rangoons  rangoons perfectly bite sized wonderful rich flavor  could used little more crab rangoons but delicious way were   We did wait quite while check but server kept drinks refilled pretty well overall  people working front counter behind sushi Mongolian sections more friendly servers but servers seemed polite enough  restaurant whole seemed very clean  restroom smelled actually wonderful weird know lol clean  offer gigantic bottle hand sanitizer door which nice perk  If only could each person use walk in! But then again lead horse water    So overall good restaurant going experience! <EOR> I've buffet many times favorite  always come eat crab legs best  sister came eat today 12 9 2015 blown away saw  almost finish eating  when nowhere looking roof seen RATS crawling right top where food at  only ones saw 4 other customers same section where seated saw it  asked talk manager tell saw apparently he already knew rat infestation problem  He said he already contacted Pest Control yet fix problem   all disgusted did pay meal  Those RATS BIGGGGG!!! don't know long there  need close down restaurant  reporting them health department!!! <EOR> Really boring bland food many options  least 6 other Asian buffets Las Vegas near bottom list terms food  Decorations fairly decent staff friendly  Plus charge 2 79 drinks when most others include drink  Better different Asian buffet  <EOR> Basic Chinese food restaurant  Below average food flavor  Poor dining experience  Saw two bugs main food area looked some sort small roach which crawled under into where food being served  <EOR> This buffet very good variety options   food pretty good but really top quality   Yet price low    If  asian food certainly try  <EOR> keazy Buffet outside looks old BUT soon enter eill see veey clean modern restaurant  Looks deceiving outside  food assortment huge  particular location mongolian buffet station  various seafood chinese food  food good price affordable  if ypu check tbrough Yelp ypu 15% discount  <EOR> military 1st responder discount!  support those support me  hit mongolian buffet once   decent solid standards veggies meat  whitefish sashimi crap   tough iced good   rolls ok  clams mussels rubbery hot entrees good variety fried sauced veggies meat lots jalapeno enhanced dishes please spicy savory cravings  wait staff busy prompt plenty clean dishes good cleaning messy customers   more few fat slobs front me   mean untidy customers   haha overall i'd bring few friends liked   I'd noodles veggies probably mushroom ginger mongolian entree served over chow mein     enjoy! <EOR> Totally true shit hole  hole place shit hole  The food looked fall shit hole  Don't waist your time somewhere else   I give zero stars   <EOR> This buffet pretty good affordable price $12 99 dinner  dinner all day Sunday's  lots seafood choices here  includes crab oysters shrimp crawfish fish Mongolian BBQ other food  didn't try sushi  fish didn't look super fresh  good customer service  server took all dirty dishes away refilled water  <EOR> Krazy Buffet nice clean outside well inside  your typical American Chinese buffet food enhanced MSG there's also soft serve crab legs those bananas strawberry sauce why always bananas strawberry sauce??

Then he gave option just stop eating he wouldn't charge meals  DUH  would recommend place worst enemy  R d c u l o u s <EOR> We enjoy eating long day adventure  crazy eat krazy buffet !! <EOR> So compared other dining experiences same variety place rollercoaster  Sometimes really good other times so  However last time came wife say Friday night being really STINGY steamed crab legs in 3 hours brought fresh crab 3 times  wife could hear others complaining amoungst each other tables near sat stalked food restocker  crab dinner line always just slightly more full water line full broken pieces which could very well tell contained no traces meat left inside shell  wife ballzy asked food restocker fresh crab which did receive fresh crab fresh attitude which lady said same thing problem? Shrugged shoulders stompped away   not want deal work nice people job all week long <EOR> I return  lunch b c heard good reviews place but sushi fresh fish did taste fresh seaweed salad tasted old but almond cookie ok  <EOR> About best Chinese buffet seen Las Vegas but personally Chinese buffets LV just average nothing special  Very clean open  Mongolian BBQ plus but needs flavor section teriyaki schezuan etc little quicker higher heat Everyone party full enjoyed themselves  <EOR> I love sushi!

Plenty crab legs  Chinese 100% recommend buffet restaurant  <EOR> Good service  best chicken dishes but sushi better expected  very fast refills sure plenty drink  came 4pm paid 11 dollars  Orange chicken leaves bit desired but overall definitely good experience overall  <EOR> I last Sunday early birthday dinner brother  treat  Sunday all day dinner price which would around $12 WITHOUT fountain drinks  dinner variety seafood includ  sushi other types Chinese food  HAPPY oysters boiled crabs shrimp  Those stuck to    But unfortunately those most likely oysters gave bad case stomach flu  Eeeeek! still sick typing whole thing trying crap pants  Anyway wouldn't back  food pretty yummy but definitely worth getting stomach flu ever again  unless want spend next few days week making constant trips bathroom eventually going hospital guest! place perfect you! <EOR> Went today lunch  far favorite chinese buffet Vegas  usually crab legs weekends but changed only dinnertime weekends boo!

The kimchy rotten brought hostesses attention   she brushed off said smells just fine dude ran mongolian grill looked acted if bothering somehow  very odd   friend runs 20 minutes left joint cussed hours taking there   I felt bad     Never again any price  <EOR> Cannot selection quality you're paying here  minutes late able lunch price per person but even increased dinner price per person still really good sushi seafood steal price! <EOR> I've three times its price decent   very large selection entrées   lot food seems actually food unlike buffet Asia where eaten before tastes cardboard  booths tables big large groups ambient music nice lighting   Overall decent! <EOR> Price pretty good but food extremely greasy  Could more variety  Seafood bit tasteless but rest okay  Atmosphere tacky bathrooms so so  don't see myself returning  <EOR> Ok girlfriend daughter love place Ive slowly expanding dining radius when said lets buffet couldnt say no    What mistake!
