Working all all uncomfortable made feel unwelcome   It's bad poke bowl but worth price tag service improve ahi tuna could improved  Go!ku West Las Vegas better raw fish IMO but first foremost ramen place off strip take into consideration if you're taxi'ing walking  <EOR> If shopping around Fashion Show Mall hungry?
