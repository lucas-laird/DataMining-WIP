To start when arrived front no hostess stand direct when someone did show didn't bother ask any seating preferences   asked sit bar area Sunday Night Football   plenty seats 6 pm Vegas quite early     The next problem flights craft beer actually just 2 bottle beers each person   no draft beer   When hear flight expect small tasting size samples multiple beers   beer poured bottle then another delivered once finished   Also when first ordered 4 beers list available   waitress came back selected those let know selections gone   already thin list choices Blue Moon Sam Adams fine beers but again expected craft beer flight    time she came bring second round yet another choices ran 3 bottles ago  lack communication availability between bar server absurd     The lack server attention didn't stop conveying beer availability   taking order having come back mustard ketchup didn't see again until she brought bad news beer   No refills water checking us   food good quality but if build your own burger practically every topping extra   cost $3 avocado mayo   best food night spicy shrimp item didn't intend getting   Clearly target audience but maybe shouldn't trying lure people craft beer flight deals  <EOR> Since Simon gone Cafe 6 quickly replaced it  Cafe 6 looks same decor only change menu  cute menu burgers sammiches fries salads even some dessert which call love handles  decided grab couple different items try everything could some coworkers   We orders U Pick burger trio  First burn your face off second turkey snack last belly wash  burn your face off hot tasty  turkey looked funny taro bun which blueish purple but very tasty  apple cranberry dressing good  Lastly belly wash favorite  Beef BBQ sauce more ask for  also order BLTA stack  BLT avocado total winner  also came side fries waffles fries  also comes house made ketchup  Super yummy  Last but least ordered some wangs  decided sauce side  decided try sweet Thai chili  very good  could just them there  filling delicious meal  really excited try more items  sure going BLTA again maybe side wangs  <EOR> 5 BIG STARS! found great place through Groupon wasn't sure expect  Great service time walked time walked out  Every dish delicious!

The decor ambiance super very modern floor ceiling windows overlooking pool literally few feet away  FYI pool goers mixture Good Bad those that look like me    Service  Great! waitress very friendly knowledgeable fun  only drawback being when she brought check she showed total $50+ then said she manager apply Groupon which took over 10 minutes  mean why upfront?     Food  best burgers ever had perfectly cooked order absolutely delish! Onion rings very good waffle fries meh  But homemade Sriracha Ketchup killer!   Beverages  flight beer good but interestingly on tap  Which meant opening 6 bottles but only using portion 4oz guess   Strange   As others mentioned bit trek but definitely worth journey! <EOR> I'm burger person  skeptical coming here    But am total fan  located palms place where old Simons use be  Sunday night    wasn't busy    But definitely should be!

Haha  older kids smokehouse which devoured even its notable size both said really really good albeit little messy  other son ordered Short Rib sloppy joe rave reviews well  friend did BYO said taro bun excellent choice really made burger top notch two younger kids Chee burgers which just plain sliders   All burgers besides sliders came fries some ordered sweet potato other's plain both good  Each burger ran $15 each  Even though food good going tell you SKIP SHAKES! They're honestly equal McDonalds milkshake which Palms downstairs ones cost whopping $9 95 + tax worth it! Wouldn't minded if notable some extent but they're mediocre best even big  $50 shakes sub par kind pulls wrong way into could've great review  service slow while restaurant slow  never understand that    Anyways summarize food good  your shakes elsewhere! <EOR> We enjoyed fireplace view pool   tried choose your own sliders   If near restaurant try out  <EOR> So staying Palms Place 8 days came last year great  only restaurant inside Palms Place  Yummy burgers good service   However apparently month ago switched menu only burger menu rest whole bunch randomness but looked decent actually good meal first night which probably would received 4 star review   also came breakfast next day yesterday also started serving breakfast   Breakfast ok   smoothie didn't really mixed berries chia seeds whole bunch other organic stuff side yummy scrambled eggs  Hubby overnight oats important part review oats sliced strawberries sliced bananas top see attached photo    This morning wake starving want some more those eggs but try smoothie just strawberries bananas? Apparently not  told can't rude bartender yelled waitress handle question instead going back cook himself   9 00 am there's nobody bar   There's 6 people restaurant which more average seen couple times during pool lounging see into restaurant    I'm sorry why can't that?  understand exciting flashy two smoothies menu actually plain extremely simple strange part know ingredients because bought single cup milk $3 00 night before because craving being weird isn't part review      So again you're telling cannot blend strawberries bananas some milk some ice together charge double actually costs make??  sorry but kind customer service that? Yes understand menu but many restaurants modify something you?  wasn't asking them five course Michelin starred dinner   asking most basic smoothie ever  Am acting entitled? don't mean be  pretty picky always ask modify things whether no sauce food take away lettuce instead provolone cheddar mean asking world here   Am wrong?  just feel every restaurant ever gone above beyond now except one     However waitresses both days very nice   Back bartender though hostess told order through takeout first all no greeting then when honey asked if could strawberry smoothie he just shook head no didn't even open mouth   when he yelled waitress actually busy instead going ask himself     We would ordered eggs smoothies every day week would much rather pay overpriced food good customer service   Ps just noticed since wrote review uploaded pics previous experience year ago show review doesn't time but man look pretzel bun    sad changed dinner menu!! <EOR> Confused why 5 stars but oh well  came checked into Palms Place disappointed food  service however fantastic  server amazing definitely extra mile take care us  He really excited kept energy high even though both incredibly tired  ordered Rock Shrimp appetizer ordered Build Your Own turkey burger he ordered Smokeout which apparently known for also sweet potato skinny fries  shrimp appetizer okay  wasn't great absolutely terrible  think batter could little better fried little longer don't think should toss Tobasco Ranch  LOVE Tobasco however made really soggy  probably best thing ordered  turkey burger really bland  normal toppings lettuce tomato onions added mushrooms  put way many onions overwhelming taste  Usually don't complain because onions but must given half onion  Smokeout looked unappetizing he said he really unhappy it  didn't even want try it  sweet potato fries pretty good but tad salty   We didn't come back although would if food good  convenient if want something basic   like fries  don't recommend place  <EOR> Nice restaurant right next Palms Place pool  Very overpriced hamburger raw  undercooked but RAW  waiter did check back fifteen minutes he delivered food no time send back another one  No burger me    <EOR> Went lunch hardly anyone restaurant service very very slow  food actually pretty good greasy cooked seasoned well he friends hot crispy flight beers worth price however re pick beer choices because lot ones picked eventually gave said bring whatever also few hiccups such order being wrong something floating girlfriends water long hair napkin utensils   wouldn't visit place again without another discount groupon   If paid full price would asked manager sure  glad waitress very nice attentive she could be  coworkers seemed doing almost nothing stood around chit chatting tables sat dirty 20 minutes people left   <EOR> The Burger right picture sham dont ask your burger med welldone no flavor anyway pretty sure frozen pattys theyre menu 90% burgers <EOR> We selected Cafe 6 because right Hotel  surprised great end  Dinning hall looks new clean  Food options where awesome  Food great  worth try  would come back <EOR> We came groupon  server jeannette fantastic  salmon burger prepared perfectly beer selections great  come back?  100% sure  setting wonderful service top notch  <EOR> We invited Café 6 Palms Place comped meal   Located 6th floor hideaway very inviting upscale feel floor to ceiling windows overlooking pool   We attended immediately Jeannette wonderful server   Though restaurant looks classy full bar no cocktail list   no wine list   Instead restaurant selling off remains its predecessor's wine collection replacing it   Huh????  The only Riesling available both dislike   Instead ordered Ace Pineapple Cider Beer Cider menu hubby Sierra Nevada    If don't you're SOL   could million calorie shake along your Health Food meal   They're probably delicious   Fattening stuff always except Fried Twinkies    nice stock selection local brews but non beer drinker lack wine huge turn off me   pineapple cider interesting tasty but sweet even me   We started Baked Soft Pretzel enormous creature served Dijon Mustard Warm Cheese Sauce   Loved but needed room dinner first entry take home bag   We ordered Dr  Pepper Shroom burger without Dr  Pepper Glaze   never liked soda but did want all other stuff it Roasted Portabello White Cheddar Caramelized Onions Dijon Mustard Brioche Bun   asked medium slightly less but good 'ol days would burgers medium rare fine Health Dept  damned   Mr  G  Smokehouse Burger he enjoyed lot   ordered onion rings waffle fries well done   onion rings humungous didn't dare eat more one   waffle fries perfect crisp well done but burnt simply scrumptious   couldn't even finish burger took home lot fries remaining onion rings   We finished dessert Die Chocolate   full whole nine yards asked ice cream served all other stuff packed go   did miss beautiful presentation seen some photos posted but three scoops chocolate ice cream served made almost comatose 'cause ate much it   Café 6 lot going it great atmosphere big tasty burgers rings fries pretzels desserts stellar service   But great menu just TWO entrees few sammiches don't sound particularly enticing bar looks bar but maybe just mirage oh  different hotel Strip pricing   If you're craving burger beer may just your place  <EOR> I greeted promptly politely hostess   Don't name cafe fool beautiful space enticing menu   see being fun lunch spot off pool nighttime date spot DJ    The only reason didn't give 5 stars because only simple dish can't fairly judge them food   BUT salad delicious! Big pieces crab meat tasty dressing   First impressions important restaurants server Maddison made great one   She huge smile when she approached table very sweet   Thanks girl! <EOR>
