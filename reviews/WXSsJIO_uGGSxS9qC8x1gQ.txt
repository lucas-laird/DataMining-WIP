Overall love place back! <EOR> First let say ahi salad awesome  Delish  die for  new fav indeed  But food isn't reason meh rating  there's some weirdness place    1  There's sign door which leads beautiful shaded patio ceiling fans says Please sit patio   No explanation why  Why can't enjoy beautiful weather outside? Especially since running ceiling fan there  2  music play horrible house type music would hear dance club  way loud gave horrible headache  3  cashier completely uninterested smiling being welcoming doing anything but bare minimum job requires  When asked nutrition info she said when partner came back he'd able estimate me  No followed saw someone return  4  When ordered salad asked if wi fi  Ms  Apathetic said yes  tried connect when sat down course needed password which ask for  heck? Why wouldn't just tell someone asked wifi password is? BTW healthy2eat case need too   I left feeling because am ripped shape she felt no business being here  think delish food alone won't help place survive  Time tell guess  <EOR> You kidding right now  place called The Protein Source? <EOR> Was first time very nice place Very friendly staff    think menu great defiantly back try more !! <EOR> Food awesome service great  love bison burgers but favorite steak lovers bowl  Definitely great healthy choice anyone wants good quick meal guilt free  <EOR> Absolutely fabulous!  most delicious health foods!  place designed athletes but anyone should try it   came athlete daughter last night dinner good came back breakfast   last night Bison Bowl elk bowl both really lean tasty patties over mounds very fresh sautéed veggies over big pile very soft tasty sweet potatoes   Fabulous    morning gym looked each other decided come back   both ahi tuna bowls   fresh juices protei  shkes awsomw well   try thier protein peant butter protien balls grest   place very reasonable given foods $8 $13 per meal but great value  <EOR> I live right down street many times  dined well ordered go  messed both boyfriend's to go order last night but first time ever happened wasn't upset  Also both agreed food tasty mad   I always order Mediterranean Quinoa    delicious! also Western Avocado Salad minus cheese but meh best  Last night ordered California Cobb wrap also without cheese cabbage wrap  While bummed because eggs completely missing hard eat because kept falling apart still very good  actually very surprised much flavor without dressing included side  loved ordering again please don't forget eggs next time!   boyfriend Steak Lovers Bowl although he asked jasmine rice brown rice instead he also said super delicious  Eh still pretty hungry but did just finish Pilates workout   Additionally love people work there  They're really smiley very helpful  always appreciate them!  The downside price  Mediterranean Quinoa always seems great because if under $10 lunch happy    well under that  fact all salads reasonably priced unless add protein which never do  But between two last night nearly spent $30   just entrees didn't order any drinks   problem because  price you'd spend 2 entrees nice sit down place  know use quality ingredients but Protein Source more gym healthy bite to eat spot think some things should less expensive  If would eat more often already do  usually meal prep own protein carb green if lowered prices bit I'd build your owns pretty often  Though  gripe say made positive changes menu recently  Being healthy spot shocked didn't nutritional information posted  menu now info which great!  Tip Check Yelp $1 off protein shake juice <EOR> Healthy food spot located flamingo 215! stopped workout LVAC  menu have! many different choices  steak lovers bowl absolutely loved it!
