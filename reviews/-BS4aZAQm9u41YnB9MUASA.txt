Odd  MINT TEA ALMOND PANNA COTTA Doesn't initially appear panna cotta but surprisingly successful  flavors all somehow work together despite initially being turned off grapefruit top not mentioned menu description   BF inhaled dish really loved it  found enjoyable but also very odd  mint tones dish almost come off bit medicinal   The food fairly tasty but did particularly wow me  Maybe expectations set high but expected bit more satisfied $70 dinner  Perplexed why couscous offered side but instead only available entree   Service attentive professional throughout  <EOR> Decided try Moroccan food first time  Once enter restaurant taken Arabia Moroccan lamps Persian rugs silk seats  staff incredibly friendly waitress answered all questions big smile  owner even acknowledged welcomed us  Started meal Moroccan salad which contained assortment boiled eggs beets peppers potato carrots tomato  tasty paired every bite fresh bread brought it  entrees ordered Braised Beef Short Ribs Royal couscous lamb veggies  braised beef very tender but little sweet taste since marinated apricots honey cinnamon  However lamb dish ok lacked flavor but lamb cooked well  Also order mint Moroccan tea    One unique aspect place belly dancer entertain guests  Overall experience pleasant! <EOR> Ate twice both times found fantastic   Unfortunately Las Vegans no desire anything good now location closed!!! <EOR> To update previous review place increased prices almost double decreased food quality most likely stay afloat  last beef dish all fatty only 3 cubes beef when before lean meat plenty it  even charged tea refills! location great sure many people know them  Such shame loved place but rate going don't know if back long stay open  dropped star 4 3 stars but well way 2  <EOR> The food delicious!!!! atmosphere quaint service great!!!
