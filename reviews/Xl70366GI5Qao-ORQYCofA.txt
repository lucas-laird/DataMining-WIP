I love portions food! bring your food ridiculously fast ladies working sweet! glad live close because favorite Chinese place ever too! Definitely worth price everyone should give shot ! <EOR> Greasy nasty   If dish contains vegetables tofu then tons tons grease should referred healthy  Nor should called vegetarian if said vegetable dish contains chicken beef broths sauces   Also QUIT A+WALKING THROUGH PEOPLES' yard!  S I D E W A L K  reason should learn respect property   Then trip over knock over fence FRONT owner house should probably   I don't know   say sorry maybe try put back pick up!  look them then just continue saunter through yard!  Also if order wrong vegetarian ordered off VEGITARIAN MENU cannot eat food because messed order then should probably deliver new take old back maybe   I don't know   give money back since just  couldn't eat it   probably should try charge ANOTHER plate DELIVERY fee   wrong seriously?! <EOR> This place go to take place  right house delivery fairly quick  don't speak best English but little patience communication difficult  order chicken lettuce wraps crab Rangoon wonton soup egg drop soup chicken chow mien beef broccoli  haven't ever poor meal am unsure all bad reviews place hole wall gourmet Asian cuisine  Service food delivery speed acceptable <EOR> The food very tasty  Shrimp Fried Rice really good nice size shrimp  Shrimp Chow Mein also really good again nice size shrimp  Broccoli Beef SUPER!

Mind parked right front place definitely demerit against them every right responsibility business prevent sort thing happening  phobia homeless folks but there's nothing having filthy greasy booze breathed hobo greet car way into restaurant  whet appetite   Once give guy some change walk typical strip mall Chinese take out style eatery am immediately greeted to go? across room  When ordering ask if unsweetened Iced tea  She doesn't know she asks girl right next ignores her  stand 20 seconds silence before man walks lists off iced teas  ask all sweetened? He lists them all off again  He didn't understand question  America times where run across foreigner cannot understand language place nod ask water  first bottled water receive previously opened  tell them look crazy before getting new bottle    When food arrives server places largest plate chicken katsu ever seen table front me  would extremely impressed ordered beef broccoli  tell server same look lying something  Finally beef broccoli arrives large plate accompanied second large plate covered steamed rice  Looks good! NOT!   First all given large spoon eat beef broccoli  point don't feel getting another look pretend am accustomed eating broccoli spoon smile say thank you  Then take first bite  DISGUSTING!  tasted pounded beef fat covered pure oyster sauce dipped salt  broccoli bit overcooked every often while hovering over plate prevent lap spillage whiff some foul stank feet  No plate  worked enough short order kitchens recognize scent  filthy dish water  appalled bothered write review  would normally bothered write review strip mall place but gnarly want prevent anyone going China One  <EOR> USED love place!
