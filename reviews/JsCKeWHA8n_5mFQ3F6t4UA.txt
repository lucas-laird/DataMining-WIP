Salsa chips amazing  actually pleasantly surprised because everyone knows good salsas hard come by  restaurant adjacent bar club great variety Latin music  If looking your feet wet night scene Vegas but timid shy quiet ready plunge great transitional place to  Because if feeling dancing getting quite yet then finish your food dance  But if feel dancing then step right into scene  Overall great service good experience  Another neat fact actually Gonzalez Gonzalez New York City  love way hotel all kinds restaurants NY  <EOR> This place great  chicken tacos best sky high drink  <EOR> I think place better before  Since started eating fish lately every restaurant fish used highlight meal  At Gonzales Gonzalez tried grilled pacific swordfish lime jalapeno butter which comes rice beans I really couldnt taste lime jalapeno but fish tasted divine cilantro rice probably best rice ever eaten  I two nights row  thats good fish was  Service great prices your typical vegas prices  <EOR> If you're California someplace good Mexican food avoid place  nasty  If you're Nebraska don't know difference between horse meat steak then may place  Overpriced but give extra star non alcholic drinks being included  meal price  Otherwise need hire chef fire cook  prices indicate chef cooked food but some minimum wage jockey back warming tv dinners   <EOR> Good place stop beer grab bite eat  side street New York New York  Outside setting great  Waiters order taken food recived   Food decent beer cold  Plenty  people watching time staff didn't push along your meal   Last word    Relaxing  <EOR> Great food  delishious  Ask Nicola he boom  He great food drink suggestions  <EOR> Yummmy yummmy! bf tired scrambling around different hotels night decided eat little mexican place NY before show Zumanity started which 10 steps away   salsa chips GOOD not watery full random crap Anyways He ordered tacos ordered steak salad  Vegas 5 days whole time kept craving back  steak tender sauce over lettuce such great taste it  Everything plate delicious  onions tomatoes avocado  BASED looking perfect  fatty lot taste  day think Gonzalez y Gonzalez  Mmmm <EOR> Once again loved place   waiter Raymond great guy   top all requests   happened during running Kentucky Derby   Place hopping  always fond memory place particular day wife won first bet Derby   Dinner basically free!!!  I fish tacos good!  She chicken taquitos   Though chips salsa come small cost Raymond gave extra which very much appreciated   say possibly best part meal salsa   IMO some tastiest salsa ever  Great environment within NYNY  <EOR> One favorite spots Vegas  always sit patio area people watch feel we're streets New York City! ordered carne asada tacos which come beans rice always swap Mexican rice cilantro option  steak nachos look small portion but definitely hit spot! Very hearty  Definitely recommend spot! <EOR> Edible but no way enjoyable  Perfecto Patron margarita far perfect  menu states made lime juice but taste strictly syrupy mix  corn tamale appetizers sacrilege no reason deep fry tamales which why stupidly ignored menu's description fried crisp  Unfortunately regarding tamales menu accurate  final disappointment shredded beef burrito which simultaneously spicy lackluster  decent item ordered also least Mexican  the steak salad  WOW! rendition just thankfully What!?! also worth noting charge perfectly average chips salsa  All all experience underwhelming unsatisfying  won't heading back  <EOR> Delicious chips salsa! shocked pay chips salsa but worth it! Some best salsa had  combination beef burrito chicken taco  Shredded beef delicious  would eat again  <EOR> I've died gone Mexico   Best bang buck   Come appetite because food filling   steak shrimp fajitas   Fabulous!   guacamole chips   Made right front you  <EOR> The service place nothing complain about    Appetizers amazing  Enchiladas meh  Shredded beef tacos bland!   I would only come back place when appetizer happy hour order steak nachos  Stay away entrees  <EOR> Ran into restaurant while walking around New York New York Casino during happy hour  did small happy hour menu however don't eat meat didnt help me  buy free margaritas during happy hour  portobello mushroom tostada comes black beans  really good  mom chicken tostadas happy hour menu she enjoyed  service ws pretty slow however appeard waitwr only person working floor time   would return  <EOR> On Friday night only host working  Friday night Vegas summer probably going bit busy side  least more host would better service greet seat   being seated took while greeted  Eventually server greeted took drink order  Since sitting while knew wanted eat but he did give chance order all once  hate when happens   busy but least look while taking order    The food good  tamale enchilada combination   portions good except would slightly larger portion rice     The lower rating response lack luster service food  would return food  <EOR> Mary GM always takes care when we're here! Service great   recommend steak nachos table side guacamole    Always amazing  Hard find good Mexican food strip but love place! <EOR> The king crab guacamole life changing waitress great! Definitely stop if you're near New York New York hotel  <EOR> So if weren't bar they'd only star  seated booth crumbs covering seats then sat table probably 15 minutes before server came over  ordered drinks chips salsa $3 free   server checked could specialty on the rocks margaritas souvenir cactus cups gave price before putting which nice  boyfriend's gonna $46 he said okay but strong absolutely did  bartending place extra star  took very long time them come which sense given special request but once did we could see them sitting server counter seats server passed them three times without grabbing them until flagged down    We steak chicken fajitas steak more medium well medium rare didn't care much  chicken good seasoning cooked properly better  boyfriend trio dish which came chicken enchilada okay basically pile mush without much flavor pork tamale disgusting       really disgusting  looked identical enchilada but can't even describe gross was mini taco okay      They forgot corn tortillas asked server but then forgot remind again ten minutes later once could finally flag down  felt bad table next point because reminded second time tortillas refill soda she turned them when place order then realized she forgot tortillas them then turned take order again then realized sodas empty refilled then finally actually took order  Happy served but pretty chaotic   Overall I'd recommend visiting bar only maybe even pass chips salsa since don't feel they're really worth $3  food wasn't good amount time took food everything came food just waste  <EOR> We staying NY NY Hotel Casino thought we'd try Gonzalez Y Gonzalez pre show dinner   Arrived 5 30 PM seated dining room right away   baseball playoffs bar T V  which part front dining room   bar 5 younger guys watching game them drunk he barely able sit stool   most plays he would scream shout loud completely disrupted dining experience could tell everyone around disturbed this   However bartender continued serve him   Even friends telling quiet down   manager came over spoke but apparently didn't ask them leave all remained and disruptive show continued     The food good although nothing exceptional   restaurant charges nominal I think $2 95 chips salsa which good   service average above average   Overall would say give try but lose star food nothing special star manager failing ask drunk <EOR> this place GREAT! Came Friday night last trip Vegas loved it! late dinner midnight service great friendly attentive  I carnitas plate which very delicious   dinner club inside  only no cover everyone all night ! also playing latin music  Cumbias merengue etc  Just clubs!
