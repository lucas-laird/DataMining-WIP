Nothing sitting bin scooped out  made quickly ordered  back recommend place! staff very pleasant too! <EOR> I eat when need quick Mexican fix food always good fresh  staff always pleasant helpful salsa bar always clean well stocked appetizing  Pricing fair flavor plentiful  <EOR> The customer service bland best   Angelica isn't someone should working front counter   She uninterested more concerned interrupting more taking order   We would ask question she'd interrupt We're   drinks salsa   In middle ordering she'd stop listening completely turn around conversation another employee   What's worse pretty sure owner sitting chair end counter doing stats day   UPDATE food   If first time Baja Fresh would never come back   The food bad   The grilled fish hard tough jerky  beans weren't even cooked through   They still dry nasty   The tortillas tacos felt they've left all day   We never come back location again   Horrible representation Baja Fresh franchise  <EOR> Girl front counter wouldn't even lift head eye contact she seemed sick coughing shirt hands then touching food  just left food there! Lack staff well <EOR> This place delicious freshly made order Mexican food! especially shrimp tacos baked fish tacos  always seems clean staff smile greet when walk in  good customer service too  love salsa bar usually order extra chips because  downfall! <EOR> I fresh mex concept  Its decent meal when your pinch want something light but fulfilling  particular location always clean staff friendly   salsa area maintained free spills junk  Ill back again  <EOR> I used come often wife several years ago decided come back quick bite memories place pretty decent quick fresh americanized mexican food decent ingredients   most recent visit anything but good   Ingredients marginal 'assembly' food very sloppy all topped off baby roach salsa bar   Portions absolutely huge but would traded 2 3's more quantity meal better quality ingredients preparation whole meal just looked sloppy mess me  <EOR> I won't coming back until see under new management sign   No air conditioning drinks bought counter unrefridgerated no ice   Dirty salsa bar   Half drunk bottle Snapple case drinks purchase   Napkins kept kitchen available cleanup   Dirty seats tables   Employee cell phone ignoring concerns   Food mediocre   Guacamole did resemble anything fresh   Dirty bathroom   Bad dining experience   Really bad because used Baja Fresh   noticed quality going downhill but today final straw  <EOR> I love Baja Fresh but location killed desire eat any Baja fresh anymore   food terrible   used eat fish tacos least 2x week loved burritos   fish always greasy overcooked mostly batter   am fan cilantro now overkill where can't pick out   Used love salsa bar   the roasted salsa which supposed medium gotten hot can't eat Basically phased substandard food  fresh   cleanliness another issue  <EOR> I use all time loved it!  It's ok can't say running back anytime soon  use crave place    sure changed since last time here  I just can't put finger it! <EOR> I work same parking lot restaurant seen place shut down Health Department 3 times over last year so  Each time door note stating shut down due inadequate refrigeration if remember correctly    wouldn't take chance eating just posting because everyone walks past place every day probably wouldn't know many times they've shut down  <EOR> Came today now know why come while  Ordered 3 Tacos chicken cheese only came black beans n rice  Beans n rice very hot typical flavor  Chicken Tacos came green sauce did order  Chicken warm best could even melt cheese ate first one  Tacos came very little meat     out 3 maybe enough meat taco  Food brought table well miss delivered someone else!  Won't returning learned why stopped coming! <EOR> Umm surprised no reveiw yet location!!!! O K  anyways Baja Fresh looks feels typical Baja Fresh  order wait them call your order pick your order  salsa bar also your own drinks  never felt location dirty slow  Sometimes orders mixed but hey aren't all robots yet     I really only excited over Langostino Lobster tacos YUM!!!!

Yes said FREE did stutter?   Tell them Duke sent you  Live Las Vegas cryin' loud! <EOR> I love Baja Fresh really excited close home  But service hit miss  Some days lucky nice competent person then other days much    They also some strange ways operating business  hours instance 10 45 9 45  Maybe just but find odd business would close 9 45 instead hour all other Baja Fresh franchises  when gone early day opened 15 20mins late  Also once you're inside most comfortable wait since AC broken  Forget eating summer heat!  The food consistent other locations still convenience when craving  But wish ownership management would something improve service  now impression really don't care all much  <EOR> Sadly place sick   once but twice  decided try more time more year later course sick again  sure particular thing ate  disappointed because food used great but now much    Not going back again  <EOR> Went 1 13 11 chicken mango salad delicious  skipped tortilla shell bowl added everything spicy salsa bar ton limes  What's great Baja Fresh vs  Chipotle food looks tastes better salsa bar free  Yum! <EOR> You most watch New 13 Restaurant shut down health district inadequate refrigeration further feeding sabotage theory  Do know eating today? Back July 30 complained sauce flavor told you're only person complaining well thanks inspector doing job  <EOR>
