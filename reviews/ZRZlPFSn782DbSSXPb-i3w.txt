Dated  just hotel  Only came because offered complimentary breakfast  place very difficult find  only thing actually ate omelet freshly made omelet bar  Then filled myself fresh fruit  other food options great waiter never came pick plates done with    Even though breakfast other options including fried chicken fried shrimp mashed potatoes which looked last week's leftovers  Upon leaving gave souvenir cup  definitely would pay eat here  Hopefully place part renovations  <EOR> Incredibly place even worse other reviewers said it  Feel free eat cereal dinner right across scary looking sushi  <EOR> I know rare 3 star review place preface saying only Las Vegas buffet ever nothing compare but enjoyed experience   I dinner while wandering along strip night thought your typical buffet wide variety options weren't gourmet but still good   think key choose right options   crab legs awesome totally worth $20 since probably ate $30 legs alone   Other favorites included prime rib mashed potatoes spicy tuna rolls   Salad bar just OK desserts   This really good deal if hungry! atmosphere pretty tacky but within Imperial Palace  expected  <EOR> We buffet part Buffet Buffets pass purchased other casinos   While pass good idea stopping buffet not    We lunch suppose edible but better food college dorm cafeterias   Golden Corral looks 5 star buffet comparison!    The service poor  <EOR> Overpriced offer reflected lack customers but isn't really bad might offer reasonable alternative waiting long line  <EOR> Granted pretty cheap buffet strip  doesn't mean should eat here  really really bad  fact no idea why still open  very small selection food reminds would nursing home  Worst all place smells Diarrhea  <EOR> The price definitely very good buffet strip but reasons behind low price are * mediocre food quality  * very limited selection can good thing though * utter lack care any staff a lot stations nobody replenishing foods therefore lot empty stations when 10 20 customers entire buffet Very good beef stroganoff though  <EOR> Poor food  Poor customer service  Terrible!!! Don't waste your money!!!! <EOR> yeah good remembered now back couple times year   buffet Paris Rio instead   <EOR> It terrible  honeymoon husband last night decided buffet  Now since Las Vegas week feet sore ankle lot pain  staying Imperial Palace decided would best if just stuck buffet hotel  should sucked walked  decor bad   I felt back 80's  very empty charged $22 semblance buffet  Bad selection bad quality badly cooked  only good thing crab legs   and didn't even finish because husband very sick mid meal run yes RUN back hotel room  He sick stomach next day half  worth money take your money better buffet  <EOR> I hadn't restaurant many many  years because first only dining experience bad   Wow   what difference few years makes   probably most budget friendly Harrah's dining experience   Just basics no frills no champagne brunch   But food served quite tasty   Buy 24 hour meal pass $45 give try   sure dinner but brunch gets vote  <EOR> DAMN    some harsh critics below! Emperor's Buffet isn't complete crap overpriced  paid $12 99 brunch buffet Friday  Brunch until 2 p m  Since stayed Imperial Palace follow them Twitter people    night $20 decided eat hitting pool  waffles hard    pancakes hard    scrambled eggs weren't real eggs    bacon funky    desserts terrible    BUT! sausages good corned beef hash good shrimp cocktail good favorite actually beef stroganoff  surprise!   Yeah spend $40 brunch elsewhere but wasn't bad $13  always choose Ellis Island over any brunch buffet but lazy walk drive anywhere  <EOR> I'm cheap ok? don't deny it  when see breakfast brunch buffet just $12 99 really excited  Unlimited food $13 bucks?!?! HELLS YEAH!  Unfortunately quickly became hells no Tuesday morning circa 10 30am no line no wait table  Great! tummy growling mouth salivating mind racing all yummy things gonna pile plate  table promptly ran grab plate  Salad bar?

Looks alright but don't eat eggs  Pass  Meat station? vegetarian! settled couple pancakes syrup diced potatoes biscuit w jelly lemonade  Unfortunately if don't eat meat eggs your choices pretty limited   Pancakes rubbery syrup cheap kind thin watery sweet stuff  Biscuit alright but cold  Diced potatoes tasted frozen generic brand your local Vons  lemonade as well OJ apple juices drinkable kidding couldnt force stuff down! tasted powedered drink mix full chemicals added tap water too  NASTY!  After being able eat anything plate an amazement all own fat girl very last remaining options Salad bar pastry stations  Salad ok piled high plate filled veggies  Pretty hard eff up  Pastries did look appetizing all just grabbed hard plain crissant merry lil way   Bottom line spent $13 eat low quality salad drink water  disaster!
