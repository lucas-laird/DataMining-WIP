We'll take back! could worse? customer service! admit partly fault disregarding red flags because many  starters being asked calculate own total balance seems absurd  Yes heard right  gave order twice while taking he giving look if stupid  He gave balance forgot add drinks  Then he adding drinks decided add burrito  He looked said okay just your phone add $1 70 drinks $5 65 burrito  your balance  The experience terrible! rude stared whole time there! Singing loudly intentionally trying feel uncomfortable  night! <EOR> Onions onions onions  Ordered lengua burrito filled onions  Also ordered shredded beef nachos no meat only onions   Very disappointed  <EOR> This location took over terrible failure used Amigo's Tacos must say improvement! food always made fresh when order it  usually visit during 7 9pm time frame which plus don't serve something  sitting all day  Carne Asada Fries delicious  Reminds Mexican food joints East Los Angeles  Oh almost forgot mention    guys know English which always plus when asking questions words other those menu  <EOR> I've many Roberto's far best one  location very clean service fast profecional employee food great  <EOR> Some days hit miss because right next door house but iv straight bath room issues eating 2 occasions   staff friendly convenient just sure don't plans words <EOR> My poor postmate came location around midnite July 4 2017  staff jg robertos messed order postmates delivers messed order postmates returns robertos retrieve missing half order staffing robertos refused fulfill remainder order  postmate kind enough pay missing portion order  spent $30 order $12 worth food robertos location refused fulfill missing portion  Customer always right  Fix it  won't sending postmates location anymore nor visiting location anymore  <EOR> The carne asada fries ok   hook little bit more   more cheese guacamole sour crème tomatoes onions   just hook up! <EOR> Every time come service embarrassing no smiles hellos thank yous  always see same guy register once made mistake attempting smallest bit conversation nothing  Looked 5 heads  also pretty tired getting ripped off portions ingredient ratios  Done location  <EOR> Very good!

But then first bite came wow could spit but couldnt   The beef obviously sitting mushed pile old stock vegetables warmer several hours  The tomatoes flavorless still green disgusting cheap product  beans       omg really?  hell ruin beans!!!  tasteles runny!   I tried eat hopes least bite would taste good but never happened  every bite only kept thinking wasted 6 dollars !   I feel sorry those give Roberto's high rating because never good mexican food realize kind junk serve  I would rather chalupa taco bell     What shame  <EOR> Roberto's breakfast staple me  pure simplicity everything most attractive part place   appreciate most place franchise  Its 24 hours stopping before work 7 30 am problem  stand line look extensive yet straight forward menu order pay BAM you're done! normally order carne asada breakfast burrito steak eggs cheese tortilla grilled grill less few minutes receipt thang    The food isn't overly seasoned honest theres nothing special them  But guess  them good  easy food exactly says  burritos size human baby okay big but definitely double fister   easily eat half morning full until lunch eat other  prices unfortunately dollar but quality food hasn't sacrificed  restaurant bar full condiments jalapenos hot salsas vegetables dress your food  regular customer continue be! <EOR> I eat regularly because work parking lot  tons choices nearby but still eat more other places lot  Mainly because many favorites menu tough old  usually call order then walk over    This favorite robertoes definitely most consistent location    The main reason 3 stars because total gamble food comes ordered bet comes right 65% time  When comes wrong still good though just ordered it  example order #4 no rice extra beans place    mess lot  chorizo burrito add potato add cheese also commonly botched  never messed carne asada burrito tho     All all good food good price  Quick tasty valley terrible Mexican food  Try customize your order  yourself favor grab some free jalapeño soaked carrots salsa station! <EOR> Pretty good place if you're looking cheap Mexican food place always breakfast burrito bacon pretty quick 5 10 minutes every time  <EOR> They're good use be  lowered meat portions  ordered carne asada fries put more fries less meat use put  If lowered price along portions then would give them better rating  Other food good staff just fine  If price big concern then don't it  <EOR> Great breakfast burritos  Food always made order  Customer service usually fast friendly  breakfast burritos huge six dollars  Great deal! <EOR> How many 24 hour mexican fast food places does town need?
