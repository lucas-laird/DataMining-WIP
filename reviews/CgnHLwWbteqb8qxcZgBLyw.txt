I chicken curry bbq chicken  recently tried pineapple curry   request even did half chicken half shrimp me   I've tried crispy duck but wasn't really impressed but everything else pretty delicious  curry mild well anyway  very tiny kick it  wish sometimes would give option spicy level   The servers always nice   they're super attentive would come across neighborhood restaurant Applebee's Chili's TGIF etc   But  expected pretty much any Asian restaurants    The only reason docking off star because would option determining hot spicy dishes should be  Other Thai restaurants <EOR> Weekday lunch specials always bargain no exception Thai BBQ W  Flamingo   From outside Thai BBQ looks fast food joint   But you'll surprised nice sit down restaurant feel inside     There 14 choices under Lunch Special menu only them being vegetarian   I L 12 Beef Panang Lunch Special Chunks tender beef cooked curry coconut milk served steamed rice  $6 50    more excited curry coconut milk beef part   sauce definitely tasty white rice but beef bit heavy   made great leftovers bit peanut sauce says Husband   Whereas he chose L 14 BBQ Pork Sate Lunch Special Marinated pork grilled bamboo skewer served peanut sauce cucumber sauce fried rice  $6 50    He usually Beef Sate but offered during lunch special   Nonetheless both really found myself nibbling more protein mine   cucumber sauce more cucumber salad red onions jalapeno slices vinaigrette    I really liked version Thai Ice Tea $1 95   strongly brewed sweet!  Yum!   Service great  handful customers waiter attentive friendly   Definitely no problems there   Sidenote could definitely update bathroom though   However appreciate Charmin toilet paper use! <EOR> I first fell love Thai food Seattle   little restaurant apartments used live would only order Chicken Penang Curry   Since craving some decided come here   Their Chicken Penang Curry wasn't great Seattle but good enough   sweetness spiciness wanted   only downfall restaurant pay $1 25 rice when most other Thai places give freely no charge   Maybe economy affecting them charge it  <EOR> OK must stay loyal Thai BBQ chain because introduced pleasures Thai food  BUT must say particular location really let down  location number times first review them disappointed report staff really needs stuff together! found much better Thai food restaurant no longer going Thai BBQ unless extremely desperate Thai food  WHY? Because final bon voyage visit Thai BBQ experienced worst service delivery    The hostess night unbelievably rude example arrived 9pm close 10pm when she greeted she looked watch rolled eyes  mention mean mug saw when first walked in  Then follow literally two minutes sat down she came asked if ready order she didn't even ask if wanted something drink first  waited meal glanced over noticed 1 she never smiled looked extremely angry 2 talking phone while she sat other guest  worst hostess world!! OK meal felt extremely uncomfortable every time waitress came which wasn't whole lot finally time leave decided nice leave tip $1 even though felt she really didn't deserve it  Meal less $20  walked car glanced back noticed waitress mad dogging left! NO JOKE! She blinds open staring down  Then she followed outside stood gave look death! KIDDING  TOP she came second time car pulling started pointing yelling something couldn't understand  point burning rubber parking lot! understand leaving dollar might insulting but figured better nothing given crappy attitude poor delivery  known would harassed parking lot night ornery waitress mightve brought some protection    I don't want end negative note because said started Thai BBQ far meals suggest BEEF SATE comes delicious peanut sauce DIE Marinated sliced beef chicken mixture Thai spices coconut milk grilled served bamboo skewers cucumber salad  Chicken Sate but wasn't good beef  huge curry Yellow chicken curry good except huge fan simply adding sliced green peppers curry spicy  very least try side fried rice DELICIOUS! sweet you'll love it! <EOR> My first last time eating Thai Original BBQ   Oooooh dramatic!  bet can't wait see disaster incurred!   Well none   right food ordered close enough being available time promised service price fine      No reason won't back compared all other quality Thai offerings Vegas offer simply wasn't good enough   first admit Thai BBQ suffering affect being 21st Thai restaurant tried Las Vegas many which outstanding every aspect   can't help but compare any new Thai restaurant class acts such Weera Thai Prommares neither which exceptionally far location Thai BBQ    All being said let's it I called order Chili Chicken lunch special because seemed closest normally order when Thai also because lovely photo uploaded same dish photos here   No seriously look beautiful dish http s3 media2 ak yelpcdn com bphoto IBxLi C_it0Rm m6N0TQDg l jpg     told it'd ready 15 minutes arrived probably few minutes beyond that   Upon entering took few minutes solitary server order   wasn't extremely long wait she did seem very busy waiting actual tables didn't bother me   If she phone using snapchat tumblr sextor whatever new app kids use nowadays I'd little more bothered this     Got back office little disappointed few things   1 pic posted above?  Mine looked nothing that   chicken chopped sloppily beautifully ground see above   going Wendy's expecting 99 cent burger barely fit Wendy's mouth commercial only receive your pet hamster gobble bite   2 No eggroll    matter fact nothing but chicken dish rice   Now nothing extra promised advertised but seems pretty customary most Thai restaurants provide SOMETHING lunch special besides discount   If anything adds little value could used being charged $2 brown rice upgrade      The food provided tasted okay but great   rice seemed little mushier prefer mentioned before chicken pretty haphazardly chopped up      Sorry Thai BBQ ultimately winds being worth 2 stars   If you'd gotten year ago probably would eeked 3   Doc Brown when need him? <EOR> This 2nd time here   again left satisfied!  ordered pork larb Thai BBQ chicken Thai ribs come shrimp fried rice   Loved chile lime larb   taste fresh clean   Chicken juicy flavorful pork looked yummy but did taste it   Price everything 31 00 only downside charge more rice   at 1 95  steep just plain rice   Other feel prices good   Restaurant clean but service bit slow but pleasant   def back because food really tasty! <EOR> I'm disappointed!  second visit Thai Original BBQ   We ordered Shrimp Pad Thai Beef Broccoli both very VERY salty   MSG?  assuming horrible headache rest night   Pad Thai wasn't very flavorful Beef Broccoli looked gross didn't even want taste it   ended tossing all having cereal instead    Sadly won't back   If need Archie's Pin Kaow   Where service just friendly but food beyond amazing  <EOR> Must try Beef skewers        dipped Peanut sauce  Ridiculously good! Salads good here  Other items just okay Pad Thai fried rice  Didn't drunken noodles   Prices cheap during lunch special time  crowded  <EOR> Been other locations town but first time outside doesn't look promising but inside looks much better rest  Its decorated dark woods statues type place wouldn't mind sit down meal  came because $20 $10 groupon woman register super sweet  lot times places kind give little sneer when break groupon restaurant com but she just pleasant smiley    I did order ala carte garlic short ribs honey duck spicy beef salad w Thai tea  really fan chain's shrimp fried rice never house specials  Total everything $28 cheap!  Friends highly recommended spicy beef salad but wasn't impressed  When saw slices beef description assumed piece beef sliced most other Thai beef salads had  thinly sliced then cooked basically they'd put noodle rice dishes  Cooked julienned carrots served over few romaine lettuce leaves w cucumbers onions chilis lime juice cilantro  5 10 spicy just enough heat me    The garlic shirt ribs probably fav dish there  Its generous portion little pork ribs fried super crispy dredged sweet soy sauce  reminds Hawaii style Korean chicken  Yum! Ribs mostly meat lot boneless chunks fatty which plus   Honey duck also disappointing but least reasonably priced  half small duck $8  says roasted but pretty positive fried  really crispy ribs but meat pretty dried out  no seasoning taste its own but served sweet honey sauce side    It ton food 2 ppl sharing still lot left over  best original Thai BBQ chain Vegas I'd definitely come back because bought 2 groupons! <EOR> Ok now all must know much really dig Thai BBQ!
