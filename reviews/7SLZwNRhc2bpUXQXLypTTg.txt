Jason very friendly kind  food came hot fast  place clean people friendly  <EOR> I'd say worst location! service sucks love BK whoppers often every time choose location mess order same thing every time whopper tomatoes onions pickles once last 5 times going made right having wait no reason 5 mins burger when there's no front awful! then today little 4 year old daughter grabbing bite way town order usual nuggets kid meal 5 mins town she tell she's done fries but there's no nuggets bag!!! Way Burger King thanks charging kids meal only daughter star cause she only half thing fries! Needless say upset lot enough felt need call talk manager let them no awful experience just find phone rings no ever answers 9 times called if let ring long enough fax machine! unhappy things turned today way avoid going back Burger King let alone pitiful location! sad when can't even ahold management anyone matter let them no poorly doing give them chance fix mistakes time let alone previous 5 times past 2 weeks alone!!!!! hope manager location actually reads reviews feel free contact tell really think your staff! <EOR> I'm pretty surprised negative reviews here    quite bit never any major issues other customers having   Most time food fresh tasty but occasional sandwich light ketchup mayo   The biggest issue location when ordered Icee overfilled shoved into window all over car  Luckily none interior but didn't even apology  <EOR> 20 minutes drive thru double bacon cheese burger fries shake! burger no bacon!!!! kidding me??!!!! Somebody needs place together  <EOR> Wish could give 0 stars!!!!! numerous times every time worst last  last time last straw  eating anymore!  The play place room RIDICULOUSLY scorching hot! am wheelchair health issues  hot room sick! Also daughter almost threw food  pack food leave earlier wanted to  asked staff if could turn A C response tried tell owners AC broken wouldn't fix it    Um okay  good business move when business Las Vegas!!!  Every time breakfast sandwich burnt! annoying! no excuse cooks deliberately wrap Burt sandwich send out  PA Lease! Obviously don't give crap!   Also every time through drive thru person taking order did know menu didn't know take order  repeat ourselves countless times only did wait drive thru over 20 min when order wrong    PLEASE If you're wanting whopper different BK! place sucks! <EOR> I rarely eat major fast food chains reasons this     husband way home baby sleeping back  craving cheeseburger he wanted ice cream  stopped already cleaned closed ice cream machines  WHY BEFORE ITS EVEN TIME CLOSE!!! Ugh!!! <EOR> This most conveniently located Burger King where live  right next Lowe's plaza where frequently shop needed household items   After stopping Lowe's good place pick quick bite eat currently two $6 00 special chicken sandwich Whopper worthwhile option   This Burger King used extremely slow truly poor service long ago  However diligently filling complaining when submitting provided online customer surveys checkout appears worked wonders  Service now first rate!  Regarding question which prefer Burger King McDonald's am much more Whopper Big Mac person  really can't remember last time Mickey D's  years baby  <EOR> Can anyone say Hot Mess? location disaster   sure going when popped lunch   actually having hard time thinking nice stuff say review which never good thing   notes needs some serious help location!  1  more staff! shortly main lunch rush 12 45pm place seemed really understaffed crowd   only person talking person orders she handling drive thru pick window well   lady front when walked waiting knows long   waited another 5 minutes before being acknowledged    time 5 people line behind me  really only saw 4 people working while waited   2  Hire happier people   work stressed because busy but don't need take me! didn't complain wait polite even tried order something super easy   Being snapped pleasant especially when am being nice   felt bad employees until fussed at!  Geez Louise!  3  Clean place ya? area where your soda mess   spilled drinks melting ice all over place   know people slobs but means need someone clean area time time   also straw wrappers all over place spilled ketchup near ketchup pump area   hard find clean place put tray down items needed   4  playground super lacking   First off really small   Second oven there   seemed very little if any air being circulated around there   Third definitely made bigger kids   steps climbing area big super tall 2 year old climb   She sad because she couldn't play other kids which whole reason came here!  I say food pretty much par other BKs just took FOREVER come out   Needless say won't back Burger King any time soon   please listen warning if during lunch time otherwise LOOOOONG time  <EOR> If could give 0 stars would  just drive thru cut line  when tried confront employee he just ignored told order  Place trash don't there  <EOR> I ordered chicken sandwich asked if wanted cheese said sure   charged extra cheese then when sandwich no cheese all it   THEN wanted diet coke meal give me  tasted awful!  asked lady window if diet coke she gave she yes disappeared before could tell bad   pull around front wait because food wasn't ready   When she finally brought food told she might want check diet coke because tastes awful she said yeah just told walked off   No need another drink  something different  Nope just left gross diet coke would straight garbage charged cheese didn't add   Won't back  <EOR> I am surprised many negative reviews actually better Burger King food normally hot customer service actually really better then most Burger King's come regularly normally morning time  <EOR> Worst service lied size mocha Joe    Clearly small cup but saying its medium only staff but also manager    <EOR>
