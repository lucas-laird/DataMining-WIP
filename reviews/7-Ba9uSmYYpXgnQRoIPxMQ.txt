Such youthful faces very beautiful! Needless say we'd started right foot    Moments later drinks arrived super fresh mojitos served little glasses  skeptical portion size being enough mojitos being favorite drink but strong flavorful sipped all night without need another one  When bill came $7 50 tiny treasure  sure I'd pay much again friend's flavored mojito cost $8 50  wish wouldn't raise price whole dollar some flavoring    I ordered Arroz Con Pollo chicken rice because theory probably basic traditional dishes down science  wasn't disappointed  dish big enough split between two people I think $14   chicken although dark meat tender fell right off bone  rice flavorful cooked well can't say enough good things fried plantains came it  cooked perfectly!  My friend Vaca    something something  time she explained she'd ordered think mojito kicked in  super flavorful shredded chicken served white rice black beans  felt chicken dry when alone but combination everything dish wonderful  She no complaints ate whole damn thing    We took sweet time having dinner spent well over hour never felt rushed out  bill came 52 98 before Groupon paid left  end night highly satisfied I'd certainly back  sure would order alcohol again but such nice addition meal certainly would tempted  <EOR> Dined Havana few times including hosting big family gathering salsa night   Service hit miss grandma waited hour food while everyone else theirs  ordered favorites   pollo ala plancha plantains mojito  try $5 lunch specials   figured would take advantage lower prices since usual prices bit high food  very disappointed see items chicken fingers meant kids?! value menu  could increase business lowering prices bit    $16 chicken onions beans best deal  <EOR> I consider best Cuban restaurant Vegas  bit haul considering its sister restaurant Florida Cafe located less ten minutes house but food Havana Grill lot better some reason therefore worth drive  Though service isn't super speedy perfectly occupied slices buttered grilled cuban bread need restrain yourself finishing  limiting myself piece ok half favorite dish ensalada playera $10 lunch which glad see served regular plate rather ridiculous impractical shell shaped bowl previously served in  salad contains small succulent shrimp ripe avocado baby tomatoes roasted red bell peppers sliced red onion atop bed beautifully assembled mixed field greens served mojo dressing wonderfully pungent lemon garlic  reminds salad good cafe California where fresh healthful ingredients parallel intense flavor sense hearty satisfaction  no complaints whatsoever salad because exactly kind food enjoy  If looking something bit more filling without feeling stuffed however should husband pollo alla plancha $10 lunch   thinly pounded chicken breast grilled perfection served sauteed onions  onions could definitely sauteed longer some nice caramelization but chicken great accompanying 'moros y cristianos' black beans white rice die for! flavors latter meld together bits tender pork create Cuban staple you'll want eat over over again   Another item usually Cuban sandwich  case you've never Cuban sandwich consists sliced ham roast pork pickles swiss cheese pressed white Cuban bread loaf spread mustard until warm melty  version well executed tasty although better New York haven't found another town compares  offer half size well which would enough appetizer two small meal   Although food prices fairly reasonable dinner gets more expensive drink prices absolutely not  Even Strip can't away charging $6 Miller Lite unless perhaps best restaurants generally don't even serve Miller Lite  Even worse beer Havana Grill doesn't come table icy cold  Perhaps trying give taste authentic Cuban refrigeration temperatures but prices want refrigeration expect Ritz Carlton or any decent bar   Anyhow just thought should let know you're before bill  <EOR> Yummy!!!!!!
