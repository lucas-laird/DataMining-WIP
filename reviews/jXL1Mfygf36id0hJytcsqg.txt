Nice location crowded fast very friendly service   This review refers carryout order newly re introduced Cheesy Bites pizza  Generally am fan Pizza Hut find Pan Pizza greasy    tried Cheesy Bites many places around world especially Europe a m a z i n g  European version Cheesy Bites benchmark  for pizza connoisseurs yes Pizza Hut good The Cheesy Bites themselves slightly disappointed when comparing them EU ones  European ones big puffy filled cheese  new ones smaller crispier without much cheese  actualy smaller version Stuffed Rolls Pizza Hut had  should point cheese slight tanginess didn't same Stuffed Rolls mind am very eclectic and even weird when comes cheese for example hate cheddar unlike 95% people unless you've tried other versions Cheesy Bites probably won't notice difference    Otherwise crust sauce just perfect  crust chewy soft without greasiness sogginess combined sauce very pleasant sweet taste   The price large Cheesy Bites $12 $15 if choose specialty pizza like Lovers pizza while may cheapest pizza town especially pizza chain good value something different  If just want great cheap pizza try Jesse's Pizza Pizza Dear $5   The pizza baked adequately maybe would better minute less but baking Pizza Hut usually automated   The place wasn't crowded Friday night service fast very warm firendly such rarity days   Overall I'd give version Cheesy Bites 8 5 10 store 4 5 5  <EOR> Ordered big box pizza online   arrived 15 minutes late entire order cold   wings disgusting mess garbage   If fed wings dog PETA might intervene  <EOR> This place doesn't even deserve 1 star  Placed order 414 6pm delivery Called store 630 check order  told mix order leaving store now  call back 5 minutes said card declined when order placed therefore order coming  When asked why nobody tried contact told manager Steve worker multiple drivers tried calling untrue first all second if card declined when placed order why earth would multiple drivers trying call if never left store  Horrible customer service definately dropped ball  Steve manager no handle crew slightest clue workers telling customers  never recommend nor give restaurant another go  <EOR> This place quite experience late order then messed called manager he said he sorry offered 5 00 off next order  Sorry its over year since ordered them probably 10 years time  why papa johns taking your market thought because ingredients fresh  good luck  <EOR> Pizza Hut usually favorite place order pizza always been  last order made off cold good  gave credit ere very nice it  Made things right  $80 order   I decided use edit now couple weeks later order again  half half large stuffed crust pizza  pizza came incorrect toppings ton pepperoni top side missing another topping  called told them second time wrong said they'd give another credit  $40 order  The girl Logan incredibly rude asked speak manager  She said she manager  told she rude  She said she apologized she wasn't rude  told tone voice rude disrespectful  She said well giving credit? told understood but she's still bitch   Granted shouldn't called bitch  But ALWAYS loved Pizza Hut  feel they're going shit  could hire manager rude customers over phone poor fixing problem  definitely think twice before ordering them again   Pizza hut favorite entire life food employees going shit    Thanks friendly help LOGAN! <EOR> Placed order delivery 10 15 store closes 11 00  call manager saying he needed cancel order because because other orders before mine wouldn't time  estimated delivery time 25 35 minutes app which would well before closing  He unapologetic when suggested sending another worker finish deliveries maybe staying open bit later fulfill orders especially because right now obviously very busy time business why close peak? He quickly said no he can't obviously only giving option  No apology no rain check no empathising  Just nope can't  Bad business bad look store its choice management  being willing stay open maybe extra 10 minutes just shows poor amount enthusiasm work ethic store  patheticism probably would shown quality food happy cancel  <EOR> I ordered $5 deal today  second time row really enjoyed thin crust pepperoni pizza! hut favorite crust which free upgrade   bunch different free crust flavors choose     Overall Pizza Hut best!  I sit down restaurant option well    grew dine Pizza Huts  many them just doing delivery nowadays nice change  <EOR> Made account just right review wish 0 could give  ordered pizza them didn't receive till 1 1 2 hrs late  First off warm cold cheese already hardening  Why idk since stay no more mile down road  bit into pizza nothing but dough! called them asked if could talk manager which Veronica she completely rude once told happened  spoke very calmly never once rude  When asked refund she told she'll give credit next time ask pizza well done! WTF orders pizza undercooked option ask well done? First all Veronica dough needs cook certain temperature since contains eggs which lead food borne illness smart ass  Even though already knew BS called 2 other pizza huts confirmed wasn't such thing  NEVER EVER order Pizza Hut again  Last Pizza Hut tried complete disaster well  Pizza Hut please train franchises bit more  <EOR> Pizza ok  Any large carry $10  Can't wrong that  only 8 slices finish myself  Always ready 10mins so  Standard pizahut pizza  service usually great friendly quick  <EOR> omfg  second review ever only because am mad right now   i tried again again give place chance failed every time   coming morning cook Pizza hut utah understand sometimes mess occurs but when repeatedly no excuse   firstly pizza cold I CARRIED DOES COLD WARMER??? barely any pizza sauce toppings sparse wings soggy couldn't stand eating them  ladle sauce per 8 wings which enough coat wings but remove crispy ness  ugh  done giving them chance   save yourself horrible pizza order some place else  if could give negative stars would <EOR> Horrible   Manager Steve full excuses doesn't care concerns care customer service   Corporate hear want wright here   Never ever spend money again   <EOR> Wow surprised negative reviews  gotten pizza couple times any issues  last night staff super friendly pizza ready when hot  <EOR> Went ordered large pepperoni staff rude place seemed dirty   Maybe off day stay positive but call see social media  Thanks <EOR> Constantly figuring ways disappoint  Food quality gone through floor also very customer oriented noticed many times if order within hour them closing call excuse bring your food  Random excuses  done many times change delivery times dont lie just hungry !!!! <EOR> Place freezing outside temperature 40  Employee responded per direction owner  Thermostat locked  Hence all employees jackets   Fortunately Hawaian Barbeque chicken pizzas both excellent served piping hot   girl register quite friendly kids group great attitude  <EOR> Pizza Hut added more ingredients delicious  Amanda very friendly  carry food time  Thank you  <EOR> My coworker pizza here  cheesy pizza good but pepperoni pizza gave instant food poisoning love pizza but cant say feel comfortable returning here  <EOR> I honestly can't believe many bad reviews   don't order pizza often normally wouldn't Pizza Hut but location wonderful  ladies friendly pizza really good  good good just good Pizza Hut  Once made mistake order just gave free pizza re made another us   veggies side always load up  Honestly only pizza want order  <EOR> My one star rating mainly because wings Pizza Hut god awful want warn people before purchasing them   If want pizza them right ahead but steer clear selection wings!   A night ago having craving wings let tell Yelpers terrible craving   ordered Pizza Hut's medium wings lemon pepper wings   The first thing wrong both types prepare them   wings drool over always end craving later kind fried baked until skin outside wing crispy   Then obviously drown wings sauce bam you've yourself something die for    Pizza Hut's wings?  actually coat wings very VERY thick cake like batter cook them way   then coat wing select type sauce that poorly made well    take bite majority batter!  If you're lucky meat off bones which barely thick flap wet not crispy chicken skin appears STEAM cooked meat    The sauce coat batter anything but extraordinary   medium hot wings super strong smell vinegar coming off them but little no heat spice level all   lips didn't burn while ate them tongue wasn't crying time out   Yes yes know!  MEDIUM ones but generally SOME heat them right?  Wrong   Perhaps taste buds growing immune but level heat medium wings just downright criminal   I high expectations lemon pepper wings those favorite kind wings but turned sorely disappointed   horrific made broke me   Clearly name type chicken wings should level overpowering sweetness correct?  took bite wing covered appeared gooey sauce specks pepper totally turned off   sauce SUGARY   never tasted lemon pepper wings anywhere where tastes though put honey some form sugar   could barely taste kick pepper   quite frank don't think put any sort pepper because all tasted sweetness   tasted someone slathered battered piece meat syrup   If wanted something would gone into reputable restaurant ordered chicken waffles    Needless say am thoroughly grossed never touching anything 'wing' related company anymore   Truthfully don't even want touch anything Pizza Hut all because experience only left feeling physically sick poor quality food but expensive complete waste   Never again  <EOR> Pathetic     staff insanely rude called store complain order girl just said k thanks hung !! kind service !? Nothing but young kids work plus pizza made family sick ! Dirty store save your money somewhere else cares costumers <EOR> I ordered cheese pizza cheesy bread 5 45 online  pizza supposed arrive 6 30 but 6 35 didn't any text when would check online see said still being made  called girl asked name then she oh no under breathe finally she said delivery hung fairly fast  Around 6 49 text saying delivery  pizza finally around 7 01  pizza extremely oily when would hold soggy oil  Normally would called said something but three hungry little boys  probably won't ordering location again  <EOR> We tried location twice sorry workers care but location royally sucks!!!! first time pizza undercooked pretty cold now time pizza room temp  forgot chicken wings 30 40 minutes later then said now understand problem delay time because construction Eastern time ordered 5 00 rush hour   did replace chicken wings that forgotten delivery but guess 20 minutes piping hot  Why something forgot record time but cannot food door when say! things say hmmmm! Anyway family back supporting mom pop pizza joints around care people! Support your small businesses Las Vegas forget corporate people don't give crap any us!!!! <EOR> This place horrible donot order worst Pizza Hut ever  ordered some wings 1 30 later love literally 5 min away  know does  take 1 30 hours bring some wings nor does take long make  Another great surprise delivery boy came attitude when questioned why did take long  Then he gave serious face straight said no late made within quoted time dono your talking about   First all F**k talking second all lucky didn't smash those wings your face! Better check your people work location comping people's houses attitude  Again worst place order anything from  Pizza Hut should really something people work location because honestly little Caesars would better place go! <EOR> Very disappointed location  2 last 3 times pizza made correctly nor fresh when delivered picked up  manager immediately claimed manager soon said would complain order sound fishy all? totally disrespectful when called complain told did order pizza correctly   asked extra sauce pizza clicked online  wrong way that? He then suggested click twice extra extra sauce when reality marks unmarks box extra sauce  He told he back making all pizzas all day he made just ordered it  He then proceeded tell nice day hung me  Unbelievable  If could give them no stars would  <EOR> Five stars great customer service! son received  coupon free personal pizza school  some odd reason store didn't personal pans available upgraded medium pizza  Nice someone took time talk manager able accommodate us  <EOR> Horrible experience put order 8 pizzas picked 7 15 pm order requested 3 hours advance arrived exactly 7 15 said running little behind which ok If 10 minutes but ok 40 minutes later wasn't party work related meeting everyone waiting me   taking business somewhere else  <EOR> I can't even give place star  Terrible customer service  guy hung because he couldn't order right asked speak someone else then manager when he refused someone else  If paid take pizza orders then your job if can't then find someone will  find another job!!!!! <EOR> The deep pan doughy seemed cooked live block away store took hour pizza hot just above warm   Chicken wings hot good  why gave them two stars     might give them another chance month two    Pizza lovers give them try might right   cross street other pizza place  <EOR> Ordered 2 pizzas  1 meat kids 1 without  Ended 2 pepperoni pizzas  Disappointing since don't eat meat  ordered online  probably best order person although reviews don't speak highly doing so  Otherwise haven't any issues ordering here  <EOR> Been many times pizzas great but always same crap water cups they're almost always water cups claim want charge regular cups even though tell them you're only gonna drink water won't even give small cups water want charge anyway  fault if never water cups never way satisfy customers if would end world give customers small soda cups drink water since never water cups always instead  <EOR>
