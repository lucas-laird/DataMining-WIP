He handled situation perfectly getting new steaks turned delicious!  My review definitely dry steaks manager handled but waitress treated us  Throughout entire evening she continued non impressive  When came deserts she reference last table before handing desert menus  seemed if she didn't want order anything  Well did  Just receiving desert she dropped bill reminded last table  Very rude say least all thought  Usually higher end table bill doesn't come until everyone done eating coffee other items served  Well her  After just few minutes she reappeared grab payment  hadn't even put card folder yet because all just started eat  second bite  just pulled credit card placed envelop while she stood close by  Meanwhile mother commented weren't done eating yet  waitress didn't even acknowledge her   Wait gets better! she returns credit card slip while signed all discussed tip leave  all pondered bit decided leave 10% tip  Which $50     wasn't expecting come back grab slip before left but guess she did! she walked away watched back kitchen  able watch face when she opened envelope she laughed  Then she walked over manager LeRoy showed him  She began smile smirk while watched jestures knowing she referencing all only left $50 tip  She then walked back kitchen started speaking others return laughed carried on       By now feeling sick stomach nerves  kinda person enjoys kind reaction  always person over board tip appreciation evening  felt teenager others talking right front face     Almost bullying feeling high school  So left starting taking birthday pictures front restaurant  5 hadn't all together awhile all wanting family picture  Well guess shift over walking front door? Yup waitress  Since she walked right past said Thank   She then proceeded ignore wasn't walked right past fast pace even acknowledging us  Making experience even worse! Ugh!

Grass Fed? new innovation greatest meat ever grace earth? Flemings just says wet dry aged aging beef necessity anything brag about  cook beautiful steak Costco 8 bucks pound Flemings expensive price  friends ordered enjoyed sampled tasted fine  But $50 fine? No F****** WAY! steaks la carte which just ridiculous if you're paying $50 steak give customer baked potato  sides including potatoes priced $10 $15 range which just stings because now you're certainly paying $60 your entree  sides marketed Family Style but it'd only give nice portion split between 3 people   I ordered Fleming's Salad $10 New Zealand Lamb Chops $20 simply baffled served  When order Steakhouse Salad expect something large proportions  all salad no protein costs restaurant practically nothing and none food labeled GMO Free Organic   received little salad something would leave little girl wanting more  add insult injury dressing sweet tastes no acids besides baby tomatoes would give  pretty buzzed wolfed down anyway  When ordered Lamb Chops alerted server indeed little plate food didn't care because paying $30 chicken breasts  small but decent unfortunately given room temperature meaning sitting while friends orders made  Come guys twenty bucks wrap little chops some foil!

The manger very nice appreciated feedback   He offered pay glass wine which refused My tip only 10%  felt badly but when thought service tempted leave nothing   four star rating based delectable food service received past  haven't really decided whether return  can't figure reason disrespect received waiter  probably again because food wine  We'll see  <EOR> Note although ate menu seated bar   Table experience may different service My first experience location admit although food good service bar great expect more restaurants Flemings   even though food good nothing excelled point distinguishing location any trendy restaurant bar Las Vegas  Therefore give them  A OK maybe leaning 3 5 star good rating but enough fan   The bar small crowded   staff friendly which appreciated   during happy hour few appetizer specials happy hour $9 00 price point we chile calamari then some small plate specials averaging around $24 00 per plate  filet $24 00 approximately 5 oz meat shrimp scallops which don't recall exact price but around $21 00 came two medium large shrimp two scallops The calamari excellent decent size portion   Definitely best value enjoyed  The Filet honestly looked cut table knife five ragged cut pieces meat   cooked properly tasted fine   Also shitake Risotto more mush took away dish   The Shrimp Scallops good accompanied goat cheese grits   didn't feel preparation justified price point however essentially plain scallop plain shrimp grits which most flavor dish   scallops cooked perfectly however plus count   All all food good standout good service great price bit high due location reputation  <EOR> So decided finally stop Flemings bit date night!  def glad did    We reservations sat right away though early evening joint wasn't terribly busy   But evening passed became hot bed eclectic mix people being south end strip  Our server Luz introduced herself gave menus drink ipad tablet very informative selections questions through entire evening   Luz great relief some most recent experiences other servers different restaurants   She paired wine perfectly better half's menu upon request ol lady    We both ordered Monday night special menu   choice soup salads 3 different entree's two sides 4 options choice 3 desserts   both french onion soup which great   Then main course both ribeyes   dessert she carrot cake walnut turtle pie neither left trace dessert  For ribeyes all say excellent!  Great seasoning cook both ours spot med  rare medium   fair warning though  plates serve main courses EXTREMELY HOT!!!  warn place them table but again HOT!!  Don't even think touching them without using napkins grab them with!!   They also offer complimentary sauces steaks bearnaise peppercorn another cant recall   bearnaise peppercorn   Both great neither actually needed steaks   steaks seasoned really well flavor beef really comes each bite    My only complaint really complaint just head scratcher ipad tablet drink menus   understanding those more convenient drink menus pages actual dinner menu   quicker more user friendly navigate list thats paper   Every drink wine option front no need select tab select option scroll down select variety   etc etc   tablets popping but really gained any credibility usually just end side table closed while read paperback versions    But said really complaint against Flemings just tablet idea general    Overall great experience beginning end Flemings   back!! <EOR> My husband wonderful lecture attend Fleming's  Great right! During lecture prix fixe menu served  First nicely asked if wanted red white wine  started Sprite  Its Thursday   No happy hour me    Then shrimp cocktail served  cold enough   nearly enough cocktail sauce two large shrimps prawns got  shrimp didn't taste fresh me   just bleh   Next salad course candied pecans vinaigrette dressing  love salad  Can't wrong  Just looked little sloppily plated   Next nice warm bread AMAZING spread served  fantastic  favorite dish   bread  Haha  Then came entree  ordered chicken husband ordered filet mignon  personally think chicken better steak  juicy flavorful  Weird right?

Maybe because getting $40 off $100 meal offer gave crummy table??  At 8 00 seated MUCH nicer circlular booth server very friendly   She never asked if dined Flemings started telling use iPod wine also assumed must rarely eat red meat she told dry aged steaks better other aged steaks     Stephen decided share steak each ordered starter he Wedge Salad Shrimp Cocktail then ordered NY Strip share 2 sides Signature Onion Rings Garlic Mashed    The food delicious 4 stars but quite honestly think 3 stars could suffice     Thankfully gift card Costco $100 card $79 99 discount email $40 off bill if spend $100 $121 meal came $81!   best way eat Flemings!
