Red 8 nice Asian restaurant inside Encore however food okay   Nothing crazy since palate loves authentic Chinese food   Ambiance gorgeous service friendly yet improve better price ridiculous but does expect inside Encore  <EOR> While traveling Vegas decided take stroll into Red 8  sister remembered place featured Rachael Ray sometime ago  decor stunning but hey Vegas  food just mediocre  ordered some dumplings chicken satay  better  remember sister ordered some watermelon juice she kept raving must some good juice! service nothing exceptional bit wait seated but  normal Saturday night  nice try but definitely worth money <EOR> Check ceiling entrance!  restaurant robust atmosphere put lively mood!  The best part meal dessert   start had   ordered mango pudding delicious!  also other desserts appealing   lychee sorbet coconut pudding etc  but aside mango pudding also ordered fried banana ice cream  know hard mess fried banana   But Red 8's fried perfection  sweet soft!!!  The main dishes included mongolian beef sweet sour chicken both which moderately spiced   nothing extraordinary dishes   suppose tasted comparable chinese food any China town only served fancier plates   also vegetable fried rice average     Although lively mood dinner having spent entire day filled activities food did necessarily sustain mood   felt little dehydrated towards end which why drank lot water ate most desserts neutralize slightly salty taste beef  <EOR> Went dinner last night BF craving Asian food   Food ok moderately priced restaurant Wynn but probably wouldn't return     Cantonese Potstickers lots meaty filling but skin wrapper wasn't best   Mongolian Beef extremely tender cuts beef but sauce wasn't sweet enough I hate say but PF Changs better! Green vegetables garlic stir fry probably best dish veggies fresh crisp included nice variety Chinese broccoli asparagus baby bok choy broccoli carrots mushrooms plenty chopped garlic!  Woo Palazzo would probably more authentic    <EOR> I guess getting all wonderful reviews  thought Red 8 really just okay   ate Wednesday night flying little bit late well place pretty empty  very low energy which might good if  you're searching for   Our waiter nice enough but all helpful no suggestions no explanation menu regarding sizes dishes recommendations regarding whether should share etc  live South Central Texas although love Asian food no expert ordering because other disgusting huge Chinese buffets no Asian restaurants around here  needed help knowing big dishes order properly felt lost  would loved more adventurous ordering tried new things but menu just lists dishes zero explanation what's them   We ended pork steamed buns spring rolls bowl Hot Sour soup Kung Pao Chicken  steamed buns favorite things disappointing  weren't cooked properly gooey soft delicious found round ball like presentation expecting since only ever them shaped more taco  spring rolls fine it's spring roll   mother Hot Sour soup she's extremely unable tolerate spice eyes watering she sniffling she couldn't finish third it  Kung Pao Chicken conversely found bland but decent   I really don't see any reason I'd back Red 8 certainly wouldn't recommend it  <EOR> Great service wonderful meal honey glazed shrimp must have  also never wrong crab rangoons appetizer <EOR> Our trip Red8 lunch very enjoyable  found food very good  Plan pay more would Panda Express  Serving size good entrees served 2 3  treated selves variety bows pleasantly surprised serving sizes 3 4 pieces  Service slow sure enough time enjoy your lunch  <EOR> I DID EAT HERE  Even though don't advertise menu Red 8 serves SHARK FIN  Please support businesses practice disgusting tradition  <EOR> Stopped into Red 8 Buffet long line  am glad did!

Reply ' Everything'   never eaten thought everything would good flavorful   Wrong  service would think being Wynn service would good  Again WRONG  something spicy took very long time server bring refill water  wave down  good experience but where birthday girl wanted go  <EOR> I ate Halloween pretty pleasant   wait staff very entertained when came costumes!  made reservations seated underneath gigantic crystal dragon   decor very oriental yet contemporary   Let start disclaimer though cannot compare place Wing Lei other reviewers done   only Red 8 casual dining tier versus Wing Lei's fine dining classification but Red 8 meant cater different crowd   Tourists yes but different type tourist   doesn't want splurge food just wants something quick eat wants Pan Asian meal because essentially Red 8 serves   A reviewer earlier described place pretty accurately Panda Express steroids   Just throw some Indonesian Thai Cantonese dishes you're all set   The food pretty good nothing stunning but something worth its money   pineapple fried rice which very nice since don't know any other restaurant that   actually all mooching off each others' dishes can't remember everything ate!  All know would Red 8 again often but if there's small occasion celebrate   I'm giving place 3 stars because food   Noodles Restaurant other casual dining restaurants similar Red 8 deliver much better terms food   can't fault service flawless   vibrant worth going back just see them again   Sadly can't say same food  <EOR> My husband just gotten into Vegas long weekend starrrrrving   didn't want typical room service type fare looking something different   staying Encore just walked through hotel over Wynn stumbled upon Red 8   We walked restaurant saw words dim sum did us   sold   We each cocktails which tasty but forgettable   Nothing special here   We ordered dim sum appetizers only since dinner few hours didn't want fill up   We ordered Steamed pork buns Amazing   light fluffy Shrimp dumplings Very good but nothing fancy Chicken Satay chicken good but peanut sauce little boring Pot stickers Fantastic   Extra meaty   Sometimes pot stickers all filler no meat case here   We left very satisfied but craving more pork buns   good  <EOR> Really low end considering Wynn Hotel   No reservations sure stay right    only waited 10 minutes   service slow but friendly either  husband liked Mongolian beef   thought veggie fried rice bit oilier side   pretty Vegased meal wouldn't enjoyed much anything but smoke free air  <EOR> I impressed   Rich server he great!  Cantonese pot stickers prawn dim sum   Both delicious came 4 pieces each   ordered Kung poa shrimp hubby sweet sour pork   Maybe most authentic but good   shrimp very fresh!

restaurant itself very modern chic  Definitely your typical Chinese hole in the wall  smaller size Las Vegas standards  service average  felt always hurry some reason  would only able ask thing before walked off it  Why would want give yourself more work?   Anyway family ordered many dishes including Mongolian Beef Beef Chow Fun etc  very hesitant set bar low ordered own dinner entree Pork Preserved Egg Congee  $12 bowl congee bit steep but Wynn!

Really expansive menu prices pretty good Wynn  Only complaint smoke casino little much taste meal <EOR> First impression place beautifully decorated lot red gold accented furniture  Asian highly approve decor!   As food feel entrees hit miss depending order  party 5 looking other dishes wish ordered something different  But instead 'Classic dan dan noodles pork' dish paled comparison Beef Chow Mein Mongolian Beef friends ordered  biggest complain classic dan dan noodles pork no pork mix own sauces seasoning  black sauce came dish super salty conservative while mixing else you'll end dish bland yet overly salty    I also asked palm pocket expensive dim sum item nothing rave about  Now understand mix bad good ratings place  careful order! <EOR> A nice place causal dine out  Authentic Chinese flavor  Cannot wrong any appetizer dim sum noodles soups  Fair price if looking formal place Wing Lei Red 8 where some awesome food  Same taste Red 8 Wynn Macau  Highly recommend  <EOR> I would give four stars but overpriced  combo fried rice $16   dish tasty two prawns but c'mon $16?
