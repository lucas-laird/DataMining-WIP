house  despite rather shocking turn events ended ok   Also shared couple sides  red peppers some best ive ever had  also featured something called Robuchon potatoes  Ok please bare second while  slight completely spoiled foodie rants  before ordering Robuchon potatoes called them this  even told waiter guys must serious set balls call your mashed potatoes Robuchon potatoes  say because actual Robuchon potatoes simply most amazing potatoes ever had  good refuse believe anyone else them properly  waiter said actual Joel Robuchon even gave thumbs trying them   Jose Andres' Robuchon potatoes arrived  really good  am sorry say good real deal Robuchon potatoes  Don't wrong also mind blowing  But good original  suppose its saying prefer Lamborghini over Ferrari  Someone should smack around complaining this  Although feel if going use term Robuchon should held that    Lastly desert plate selection various tarts treats al excellent   One more thing mention  service top notch expected  Although feel waiter disappeared times  When wanted complain lamb took several minutes track down  flag down busboy another table someone help   So go  Jose Andres took another culinary adventure never forget  wanted give place 5 stars but lamb mess slightly lacking service made knock off star  no doubt again give them another shot  probably need mortgage house afford but hope next time give 5

<EOR> A friend did tasting menu finest meal Vegas  Each dish done perfection  created work edible art  pacing felt right though dishes filled table couple points  Two spent two half hours eating which seemed perfect   The real standout server staff supporting him  wasn't dish brought table where he wasn't immediately present explaining ingredients why dish special  added enjoyment meal tremendously  He also told restaurant into detail food kitchen pride  Empty plates cleared quickly settings reset regularly  occasion support person tried clear unfinished dish still enjoying    The atmosphere unmatched five open theater kitchens provide entertainment during occasional lull conversation  smell wood smoke filled air adding already exquisite ambience   Be prepared spend top dollar Bazaar Meat but regret spending single one  loved it  <EOR> We amazing experience  sat bar tartar carpaccio olives  Everything delicious  cocktails also great  staff attentive nice but little awkward  Also cocktail waitress directly next obviously ear hustling everything said while wrapping silverware which also awkward  decor IKEA  only downfalls  management staff amazing food servers  want back meal dining room   Thank Yaasine nice experience always being most gracious host  <EOR> I've couple Jose Andres restaurants now Bazaar SLS Beverly Hills e inside Jaleo Cosmopolitan   Andres' tricks gotten tad old   fois gras cotton candy salt air margarita fun try first time but then thrill factor fades fast    The concept modern steakhouse all dark woods bullheads masks   love all open kitchens but Bazaar Meat feels if Andres just kinda phoned in   side over sized menu feels weights ton fun molecular gastronomy little bites other meat potatoes     From molecular side tried fois gras cotton candy   super sized pork skin Chicharrón greek yogurt They're kidding when say super sized  huge fun part when server brought silver mallet break into pieces     Bagels lox cone classic Foieffle new item haven't seen before which little bite sized waffle filled liver pate peanut butter honey   little gooey messy eat     Sloppy Joe just ok just name says mini little sloppy joe  For entree split Wagyu Beef Cheeks entree Robuchon potatoes brussels sprouts petals  potatoes buttery Brussels sprouts nice citrus y vinaigrette counterbalanced all richness potatoes   enjoyed beef cheeks but little weird beau   should forewarned saying headcheese made from   Overall great Vegas dining experience where style trumps substance  <EOR> I excited trying Bazaar Meat Bazaar location LA several times loved it  Let's just say isn't Bazaar Beverly Hills  Upon arrival atmosphere fun crocodiles ceiling fun mismatched chairs upscale hunting lodge type ambiance  mismatched lamps close together feel though lamps plus though  place doesn't know is  told similar Bazaar LA tapas but tapas more centered around meats  asked every dish ordered told all them tapas size but case  few tapas top menu but rest full size meat veggie dishes  menu confusing  servers try explain things but much cover  If wants steak house steak house if wants tapas place specializing meat then should but trying both isn't working   prices astronomical quality  Especially since Cleo next door best Mediterranean tapas ever reasonable prices casual unpretentious attitude  Bazaar Meat trying pretentious but still bit if don't order expensive meat dishes see disappointment your server  Timing off well  know tapas come all different times but some things came right away same time while other things came almost late  server extremely professional seemed really enjoy job  He great knowledge menu  ordered Air bread Kobe sandwich item menu but making special delicious  best thing all night  If familiar Bazaar LA air bread Philly cheese steak similar  no idea bread light airy when bite into cheese just melts out  Top off fig jam Kobe beef yourself delectable treat  Its $12 small sandwich but worth every penny    Air bread Ruben Same air bread melted cheese concept but preferred Kobe beef Reuben didn't care thousand island sauerkraut   Brussel sprouts fruit lemon air dish sounded interesting but proved  inedible  horrible smell lemon air weird  taste atrocious fruit did all  took bite done that   large portion tapas size  Cauliflower 2 servers told amazing told tasted candy  cauliflower half black strong burned Smokey flavor overpowered all other flavors  slivers lemon top which made taste little better but don't recommend dish  Sloppy Joes comes 2 sandwiches way bigger air bread ones  fun blast back childhood but exactly is  tasted would gotten your school lunch gourmet version hoping for  Classic Beef Tartar neat because made your table   am big fan raw meat dishes but any case did taste good all  parker rolls came great though little sliders it   Chicken croquets fun served plastic converse sneaker  husband didn't he thought tasted fair food but really liked them  supposed taste fried chicken potpie which think taste great  would great if little pieces carrots peas real potpie but taste great  Don't lemon nitrogen drink amazing  If LA its similar that  rum lemon flavors edible flowers  consistency nitrogen nothing ever tasted before  feast your senses  Truly phenomenal  Vanilla bean ice cream experience another feast your senses  3  scoops Madagascar vanilla bean ice cream crushed pieces ice cream cone recipe 1920  3 sifters coffee beans Madagascar vanilla bean aged rum  smell sifter then eat ice cream drink rum  rum excellent whole experience really fun decadent  10 piece dessert sampler some good but blown away much  cream puffs highly recommend came hazelnut cream  Mango cake great  Fruit tarts good but really tart  Pomegranate tart great  Salted caramel coffee chocolate good  box breakfast  Jasmine green tea excellent  Best green tea ever coffee amazing well  I would come back air bread nitrogen cocktail tea dessert  If want excellent tapas meal Cleo  <EOR>

Does restaurant sure single patron forgotten  drinks filled dishes cleared quickly? If sat table person tucked into corner? Does wait staff modify presentation specials since solo diners into meal show idea?  Well points experience fell flat  first offered seat kitchen bar not drink bar when asked instead placed almost last table back huge restaurant  sat table room four but walked dozen other open 4 tops much luckier area restaurant     I hope reading since handed five different menus  Three explaining fixed price multi course options standard menu huge wine list  waiter's explanation made menu easier  But five menus front felt studying college library    I ordered $125 multi course option there's lots small plates bite two coming out  Dirty plates stayed table long time  Drink glass no alcohol stayed empty really long times a good 5 7 minutes   Since way back near back kitchen entrance probably where dish prep areas wait members frequently table without grabbing something dirty off table   I'd say single diner experience less desirable nice   However food very good  Endive Caesar salad tasty  crunchy pork skin super light pork find style poof tasty  Tartare slider quite good too    The buttered potatoes decadent should probably come side Lipitor  Seriously scoop your plate looks slab butter  But delicious fantastic rice potato mill consistency  Chateuabriand tender but came chilly  another common solo diner challenge food often sits    The $120 per person fixed price menu plenty food person without doubt   Overall food well above average  If you're Vegas group you'd probably here  But simple business dinner even group?
