If took number deli say 23 42 food next    there's problem  Simple math  place busy but nothing warrants kind service  third time asking where missing rolls while exhibiting some visible displeasure waitress did bring some free sake but no rolls the price being sanity   When finally did arrive basically when coats leave sent them back completely tired waiting being treated sake drinking children   The final chapter? When member party calmly spoke owner self importantly posts himself sushi bar apparently watching orders made man nerve argue only waiting 30 minutes  1  owner argues customer? 2  Even amount time ridiculous roll!!! completely baffling especially since often pretty positive owner recognized us  empty space shopping plaza if pattern service continues friends watching afar  Very far  <EOR> The food delicious but service so  being sat table took 15 minutes before waitress came check us  food ordered didn't take long sushi come but she came back maybe 3 times during 1 5 dinner  More likely going back  <EOR> Sushi quite fresh tasty if little pricier other sushi spots Eastern Ave   Rolls very fish heavy which ideal!  Atmosphere customer service wanting   waited 45 minutes 4 rolls come time not ordered    When asked waitress rolls she mumbled chefs having cut cucumber?  Given number choices great sushi Henderson area probably return  <EOR> The staff reported couldnt reduce stereo volume music playing   Music loud  If your women pierced inked your place  <EOR> I love cousins LV always know best AYCE sushi!

No problem know plenty places can! Needless say don't waste your time  <EOR> I love place    All eat food aren't those all u eat sushi place purposely let more rice d fish  Thx friendly waitress called Jacs  Highly recommended <EOR> Although steakhouse sushi where at!

Bottom line its moderate prices semi decent food but ridiculous waiting time  sticking sushi mon road again  two stars because least decor tables comfortable  But then again she put such small table pull two more chairs end booth style table scrunch together  <EOR> Mmmmmm  garlic edamame BOMB! sushi looks good but don't eat fish tempura broccoli roll  Yummy! <EOR> The star cause food ok     BUT WORTH WAITING 45 MINITES 3 ROLLS! wish rude places but being server myself never grow pair     but man tempted place  FIRST problem when getting seated someone bumped into apologized but reciprocated  Then when leaving recognized bumped MANAGER!! Way lead example jerk  Moving on    doesnt better seated hostess she says she'll back menus    um shouldnt them begin with? menus when arrived 5 minutes later photocopied pieces paper which werent even folded properly really cant follow straight edge crease? food ok just ok  probably would tasted better if food table quicker  server said busy night    um first table tiny little room aside half sushi bar bein full????

With gripe servers would deduct star but least courteous nice   five star rating deserve   definitely come back again some time  <EOR> My friends fellow yelpers raving place months now Yama Blue Fin faithful  place lunch yesterday BF did AYCE  Sat bar area booth cuz bar crowded  rest place empty saw back  Started pot stickers calamari mentioned party 9 back holding orders would small wait  no problem  Pot stickers really good! Ordered 4 pieces garlic tuna bf  specialty roll   something helmet  It soft shell crab inside roll well shrimp tempura  garlic tuna looked smelled great but texture rough  possible raw fish? tempura shrimp flimsy   crispy but flimsy  Next ordered some edamame which offer salted garlic did garlic  also ordered philly roll  BF ordered some albacore  15 minutes waiting philly roll   asked where waitress said coming shortly  He finished albacore ordered garlic tuna kobe beef burger some chicken yakitori  He received tuna kobe beef burger still received philly roll  Really? cold roll takes 2 minutes Yama Bluefin!  Asked again   was told oh let check  Different waitress check mixed party 9 apparently never made  30 minutes now  still waiting  Finally came 2 minutes should  top off salmon fresh tasting all  Put sour taste mouth done eating day  freaking waste time   My issue A service asked waitress numerous times ice water never it  Finally fifth time asking  B bar area crowded when arrived but maybe 5 diners total including when leaving  C If large party dining understand things take longer but don't consistently blame large party back when seeing chefs front cleaning stations prepping new fish service  D seemed 3 waitresses  all playing team role helping but when orders being messed food being received waitress placed order going know if received when other two serving dish taking empty finished dish away  waitress table area   seems work better  Maybe original waitress placed order did know if received food because other two clearing plates   I guess place great if want other food included AYCE price but sushi fresh Yama Blue Fin  stick those two places thank very much! <EOR> I'm sure why many people giving place bad review haven't any issues every time come here  I recently moved Las Vegas area three times each time great!  I tried various sushi places around but sure favorite  Every time ordered all eat  service always great well server particular awesome   although forgot name she tattoos piercings She fantastic super sweet she gave awesome recommendations well  She super attentive bringing more sake water checking plenty when ready order more rolls  Even busboy friendly chatting asking if needed anything else  The food favorite any sushi place  poke salad delicious veggie tempura cooked perfectly sometimes noticed certain places don't cook sweet potato all way awful eating when hard rock great here  tried various sushi rolls each time but favorite sure lasagna roll  Yes know more amercanized roll but love different textures flavors packs all bite  Even more traditional rolls all yummy! I raved all friends back home great place is  I sure going back again! <EOR> Great fun service atmosphere   Presentation great   fast Friday night food terrific   new sushi spot  <EOR> Great place feel amazing  chefs nice very welcoming  Im fan chef rolls but wouldn't place that  Instead nigiri sashimi amazing without doubt  only worth if your doing all eat Been 3x now love its minus some cons slow severs kinda seems roll selections all sounds amazing but taste aren't great  <EOR> Let start off saying never back location  regular Southern Highlands location over year now love can't understand why isn't any sort consistency between two restaurants    In order excellent nigiri sushi need excellent rice  Undercooked cold rice doesn't cut it  fish frozen which fine because its all eat but why does salmon nigiri look different then salmon rolls? Almost looks freezer burn  When mentioned waiting x treme orgasm sashimi salad 35mins response don't worry its still coming unfortunately lumpia never made all  Having educated servers would big plus when order tamago then say egg sushi simplify server replies oooohhh always thought piece cheese confidence experience definitely doesn't grow  top why does tamago xtreme sushi Southern Highlands look taste completely different tamago here? Nothing sense all   Overall food edible but below average service slow mistake laden below average product knowledge  should probably burn down collect insurance money stick quality version Southern Highlands  <EOR> Food reasonable all eat menu vast  server Jax friendly helpful    We'll back  <EOR> I feeling going bad first few minutes  No hostess greet pretty dead lunch soy sauce wasn't filled previous day days glass casing fish kept didn't look clean etc  When tell employees management don't care establishment wonder if there's anything else you're just seeing  end order wrong waitress stated lazy sometimes dirty sake glasses food just okay lacking presentation  Just glad groupon didn't pay full price  <EOR> The sushi overall very good however presentation size seemed differ bit depending which chef made it  Lots choices seems fresh   Prices seem standard AYCE       Cool atmosphere outdoor seating area     We've tried all steaks thought very good   Service for some reason still hit miss     Soup automatically brought table when sit down   Personally I'd asked first if would soup feel bad telling no thanks bring over     The chefs very friendly greeting when arrive thanking coming when you're leaving   Nice touch   The owner usually evening   He's very accommodating whatever he ensure happy customer   Overall would recommend place   Again love patio seating when weather good   Very relaxing  <EOR> Just left 5 minutes ago  waited lobby 10 minutes never greeted anything  wanted try place because love sushi but guess busy new customers  experience places business quickly  necessity please customers especial new ones  never again recommend same you  <EOR> Yikes    why many low ratings?? = My special someone groupon here  Next looked reviews yelp  Average 2 1 2 stars total 200 reviews  Ummm    what am getting myself into!?!

I've seen place years finally gave try today didn't check Yelp before coming came knowing anything place  We step inside first impression  bit perplexing  some kind wine display window left then then further leather lounge furniture kind look nightclub lounge bar  sushi bar right place looks modern traditional sushi restaurant  follow host which turned waiter say he didn't really give welcoming impression but followed left down dark hallway then booth where cozy kind dark  never dined place before little dark loud music didn't care first but later changed into music liked traditional Rock started hip hop but later mixed into other blends music welcomed subtle changes  host said someone would right take drink order but turned he became waiter  Once again say he very efficient but really relaxed more uptight some reason  tuesday around 5 30 quite full dinner time  both wanted All eat plan picked several items looked interesting  waiter didn't write down order but did repeat requested before he put order point felt good hands  roll tongue twister something moisty poystie deliciousty  Russian Missle found name amusing Tuna Tower  Chihuahua Poke others  can't remember moment but really good if complex selection sushi items  really Japanese curry almost ordered noodles rice but never around because sushi kept perfectly occupied!  First all don't know history restaurant  know while but banner above place says Under New Management   best part Sushi #1! Every bite very fresh flavorful  can't stand various Ponsu Eel whatever kinds sauce most places put sushi often request put on  Sometimes remember sometimes forget various sauces sushi decorating plates absolutely perfect! None overpowering salty flavor profile sauces perfect best ever tasted  know sushi rice very important component sushi experience case could actually taste separation rice fish  rice perfect subtle seasoning made spot on  actually taste sushi all every plate presented each item hit mark far both wife's tastes concerned  LOVED sushi although service kind cold side waiter very efficient never really lacked anything  Yeah ginger wasabi portion Xtremely stingy but didn't really need more since food didn't require much help taste department  I am still kind surprised negative reviews everyone leaving but case can't find much fault here  Maybe diners coming peak times staff overwhelmed because short staffed? Under stress waiters overwhelmed A game  am hoping came Xtreme Sushi turning point food quality service  dine again sure hope future visits won't let down  always looking good place sushi but because inconsistent preparation other factors continue search did today but first try Xtremely Awesome! <EOR> ** WARNING may lengthy ** I visited location Southern Highlands wanted place just because! first experience however definitely ensure NEVER EVER return no matter occasion   This toughest reviews write because many things wrong during time there  Now am taking into consideration fact new restaurant some employees may never worked restaurant before please think am being critical  fact worked 2 completely new restaurants know goes  My boyfriend arrived 1 30pm  seated small section booths  waitress Tatjana came over introduced herself well menu  She extremely cute friendly quick water take initial orders AYCE    We ordered straight sushi first Screaming Orgasm Amaebi Albacore Garlic Tuna 2 Spicy Tuna Hand rolls Anago  1 2 Krispy Kristi Roll 1 2 Helmet Crest + 2 other half rolls  A few moments Screaming Orgasm came out  decent  sauce seemed bit bland  finished though then 2 spicy tuna CUT rolls come out  put down table even though mentioned didn't order it  During time seemed lot confusion regarding table numbers  3 different people came table wrong orders MULTIPLE times but nigiri came just time   Amaebi served plain best  Albacore seared albacore  ordered PLAIN albacore    yes seared albacore regular albacore menu  MUCH better  Garlic Tuna didn't taste garlic sauce it! closer taste cajun 2 spicy tuna hand rolls never came  guessed must 2 cut rolls table decided might well try it  Before even chewed once put tongue could taste rice  tasted if soap rice  really strong bad taste even overpowered spicy tuna  Anago unlike Unagi Anago usually prepared actually sushi chefs store bought  decent Sushi Factory wins   We never 4 half rolls even 1hr+ waiting  waited some more  The waitress did acknowledge asked order mussels combo tempura anyway  Hoping see if ANY rolls would come out  mussels came probably tastiest part meal  But other orders still nothing already 3pm   Our waitress let know kitchen little backed also mentioned  she'd speak management see she could do  First saying hope don't pay this  But said No your fault  waited 15 more minutes  No manager    I finally enough  didn't want seem rude flagged down waitress again explained work soon asked check  She said very sorry your experience couldn't agreed more  Tatjana gave 1 2 off trouble which thoughtful  She asked if management speak yet told yet but would love if she'd come by  When management finally came a mid late 20something brunette hat on she seemed if no told situation stared blankly  explained sure new restaurant all still figuring kinks but received hardly any food felt neglected opposed rest restaurant  She responded Well supposed soft opening family friends only just weren't really ready only table happen  told weren't complaining  just want let know although upset another couple could much more upset now it'd wise address issue order prevent happening future  kept pleasant even though irritated STILL HUNGRY mind you  wondered If table happening knew then management cannot fix problem?! Especially if ONLY table problem?!?! Just table pay extra attention to! Honestly unprofessional poorly handled poorly executed  IMO looked OVER staffed considering herd employees walk through table   Besides main waitress great even offered dessert end AYCE even though didn't want any  would star rating her  tipped 20% because customer service alone   There lot good sushi restaurants area pick just one  <EOR> If you're into sushi place you  Come think if also good service place isn't you    I've large group few occasions very disappointed  sushi very mediocre but service much worse  rest food nothing write home about  waitresses give plenty attitude if ask them questions menu frequently orders wrong   I've seen it   mention long wait time  Something simple glass water may take 20 minutes completely forgotten   I'm sure whether place just poorly managed poorly staffed both  impression just don't care way other if satisfy customers comes across service well quality food  much better sushi places within few freeway exits place  don't waste your time unless you're only interested drinks bar  <EOR> Food good  service service !!!!!!!!!  hungry order cane hours wait second order never did  still waiting??????? <EOR> Terrible!!! Tasted grocery store sushi  staff nice but place turned into dump  Don't waste your money!!! would rather gone Carls Jr  Also look over your tab  back once change management AGAIN  <EOR> I couple years ago wow different today! food above average yet overall service experience great  place ghost town compared before everyone seems act working snobby establishment very friendly   Although dinner OK probably return opt more energetic genuine sushi restaurant  If your going eat trendy looking place   this good spot you  If your going enjoy sushi experience would recommend elsewhere  <EOR> I'm avid sushi eater always trying new things Vegas  received discount Xtreme Sushi decided take boyfriend try it   The decor modern simplistic furniture  Theme entire restaurant earthy modern touches  heated area those wanted eat outside first room sushi bar seating area circling big ottoman perfect group room bigger groups another bar middle few rows small booths couples small parties   Only thing isle small booths two people seaters nice secluded perfect dates but small facing plain red orange colored wall  Also lighting almost dim see menu  don't know couple back corner able read menu   bathroom  almost maze kind hard but definitely nice another reviewer said    until see graffiti   When seated handed two menus printed regular paper food smeared some spots  service great! server bus boys came back timely manner drinks always full dirty plates always cleaned off soon new ones came  making racial debate but asian person working that saw but know some people does matter figured I'd say anyways  All ladies serving wearing corsets  Kind seemed trying place seem higher end really is   I asked waitress suggestion she said Helmet something roll soft shell crab sounded great but asked if shrimp because allergic she said no ordered it  When taking closer look menu found she suggested turned did shrimp she gladly removed  best dish overall sadly tempura ice cream  Beautifully executed absolutely delicious ordered 2! Didn't sense though small bowls dessert but spoons brought humongous   I ate money's worth food without discount doesn't matter but fish freshest would only come back tempura ice cream drinks some friends  didn't try Surf n turf curries menu  all looked great but may come back just try something other sushi  <EOR> I am surprised all negative reviews place!

We decided call police could file official complaint against company  able incident report filed see future holds  them    By reading other reviews doesn't look very promising them    I officially HATE place would recommend place anyone!!!!
