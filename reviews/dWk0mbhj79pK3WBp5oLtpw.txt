Ordered bistro chicken sandwich made sun dried potato pesto mayo garden rocket piquant peppers smoked provolone all served grilled focaccia  MMM good! portions surprisingly large dish demanded $11 95 especially Las Vegas!  I also ordred side sweet potato tots but those ended being less mediocre  Surprisingly moist soggy rather crisp  would skip mashed potatoes simply chipper chips fries     The dish also came side sauce called malted vinegar mayo which tastes exactly sounds  never fan malted vinegar but some buddies enjoyed pouring all over sandwiches  certainly interesting everyone but definitely its niche! = So yeah if you're ever vicinity Mandalay Bay you're looking something relatively cheap  fast food I'd definitely give Ri Ra recommendation probably give most bang your buck! Also food pretty bomb too! <EOR> Really fact place tries authentic  Good Guinness pours food   Looks they're associated Guinness Guinness store next them new style Guinness servers  But variety beers spirits other well   I love Guinness well when Mandalay favorite place within complex  <EOR> Great meal fantastic staff! dinner before show  Fish chips Irish Curry  Both delicious but huge servings came expect Las Vegas  server Jane very personable explained dishes us  Next time Vegas would eat again  <EOR> Hostess rude helpful     I'm guessing she 18 yr girl never worked service industry    bartender awesome!!
