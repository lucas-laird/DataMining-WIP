Seems bad business Alisha John! <EOR> The location Downtown Summerlin could use assistance training employees  three employees present lunchtime neither employees could complete task without seeking help another person  staff person assisted could speak hard hear  She very tentative lacked confidence take care customers she new job needed more training before she waited customers  Food prepared hot mediocre presentation quality  This location needs more training entire staff  <EOR> I grew Atlanta Moe's great there  terrible  tried repeatedly work  gotten hard rice others complain they've guacamole other items today most disgusting thing all happened   I 1pm Friday Nov 6  person behind counter walked back when arrived  Someone else sweeping floor   She came over carrying broom dust pan brought them back kitchen put gloves without washing hands   walked   I understand all restaurants some level uncleanliness  If someone isn't going bother follow most basic health code washing hands handling garbage right front customer other corners cutting?   I made complaint few months ago  account contacted franchisee  actually going PM them story until discovered abusing account    They left glowing review Moe's negative ones three competitors shopping center including competing Mexican restaurant   other negative reviews Pieology its next door neighbor Shake Shack    http www yelp com user_details?userid=jw2HaZgWb3eVktJuVX4PyA  I took screenshot them contacted each business Downtown Summerlin show them competitor tenant doing  also contacted Moe's corporate office   That sleazy gets  giving Las Vegas locations apparently owned all same group any business  happy visit ones Atlanta   Edit contacted Yelp user establishment removed several reviews including positive Moe's ones negative ones competitors  <EOR> I didn't high hopes reviews good but decided look area  very pleasantly surprised!  The young lady helped grilled fresh onions peppers sans oil accommodated all requests no problem  She friendly food good place very clean  back! <EOR> I heard great things Moe's friends East Coast decided try lunch    It's pushed all way edge Downtown Summerlin  location large  little dark trays very sticky but would expect    I chicken burrito lettuce rice jalapeños  enjoyed option having fresh jalapeños added just right amount heat  serve tortilla chips which nice touch    The salsa bar great option  wish spicier tomatillo but found actually enjoyed burrito more without salsa  surprising me   Overall would definitely come back  level Chipotle me  <EOR> Last night rode 215 California saw big sign new Moe's Southwest grill  husband very hungry said let's try new place Downtown Summerlin  food four people all wouldn't feed pigs North Las Vegas  literally slop  ordered Nachos girl kept pouring cold queso sauce over it  husband ordered burrito tasted if chicken burnt  think Cafe Rio Rubios way better even Taco Bell  also very expensive  $45 four items  chips also sub standard  <EOR> Terrible  twice something menu both times  Considering small menu  quite accomplishment  Food bad but simply good either  Nothing pleasant taste  <EOR> Did place thought going lot better  Should know better since no food tasted bland flavorless sorry say but coming agin <EOR> So chose place last minute b cry family going pieology didn't want pizza  order joey jr burrito big broke tortilla  burrito maker grabbed another tortilla wrapped top  cashier ask burrito maker joey jr? Burrito maker says yes cashier charge regular size burrito  reassure ordered jr he manager refund difference  manager seemed know she doing 3 new customers came before received refund  Moral story don't upset your customers your employees mistakes!! Especially when food mediocre! <EOR> Very slow service they're disorganized food line  nachos cold soggy chewy time actually taste them  <EOR> I'm real disappointed myself looking Yelp before eating here  place just awful  chipotle concept McDonald's quality  Nothing but chips good  ordered burrito chicken ground beef  Somehow tortilla cold loading bunch hot items  Ate 3 bites away  Never back ever  <EOR> Moe's dropped stars due inability open posted time  clocked lunch wasted time driving facility pull door 11 07 am locked employees inside working  <EOR> Love place but some chips queso forgot queso told lying chicken bowl chicken burnt  <EOR> Terrible  Use online order pickup food wasn't ready  then made wait while handled two people walked because pick area while line right away  told them internet order told never it  then front line those other two people gone through magically find order receipt  So then prep food tried pay again  Effing ridiculous  much apology  <EOR> Use groupon kids don't eat free  won't warn that  Why would pay money 1 year old's kid's meal? Food looks sitting all day no touched it    They advertise some new burritos there's 3 pictures look delicious! carnitas next poster    But don't yet   ?!?  It only gets 3 stars because if u steal groupon use close exact amount pay much extra pocket 2 3 people eat nicely off $15 groupon  <EOR> Mediocre best   The people working didn't notice two minutes when walked door  then when finally acknowledged made feel inconvenience   I ordered taco bowl chicken  ran chicken gave tiny scoop dried nastiness   The only reason am giving two stars because clean pretty decent salsa also give free chips   I honestly don't think back  <EOR> I wish could give them 0 stars!!! place worst dining experience Downtown Summerlin   To begin menu impossible understand    give funny names but no description exactly you're ordering    I purchased Groupon 3 times before using because every time something    Southwest Grill run such things Rice Beans veggies?  I finally Monday run special any burrito buy $5 99    advised them Groupon    advised don't accept those discounted food found acceptable  wife ordered bowl ordered smaller burrito    Once pay handed young punk phone he baffled told can't accept Groupon paid for     He kept insisting he give discount price because Company Policy! eaten few times during day hours fine but time gone things changed   never back    Quality food rate 2 Stars Zabas better cool restaurant called Panchos within walking distance    I should've known Moes horrible because every other restaurant Downtown Summerlin always packed    place much!  I wanted call speak GM but figured good do? They'll offer free meal don't want!

Even though she very loudly bubbly she lacked personality friendliness  She seemed rushed bothered  food line counter very dusty could see difference between edge client side inside  grossed but already mid order  iced beverage area register only 1 bottled drink ice melting refreshed hours  salsa counter beverage area water all over floor leak  2 rugs place safety wet floor sign but clearly needed attention  looked place sit couple dirty tables tended once patrons departed before arrived  While sat ate could hear everyone's conversations including girl asking people order sitting furthest corner front no music playing  Total atmosphere killer  food lacked flavor lettuce browning old guac tasted straight bag  Moe's lover very disappointed when visited location  Overall lack care cleanliness quality extremely disappointing  back location  <EOR> I loved Moe's when worked Indiana happy see now them Vegas! While employees enthusiastic when walk door maybe that'll come time  food great queso awesome! <EOR> Cash only now but people friendly knowledgable restaurant  Perfect lawyers protestors movie makers because name MOE stands movies outlaws entertainers  <EOR> Don't it!!

Probably because no customers  food just sits sits  everything wrapped saran wrap clearly sitting around hours  burrito gross  couldn't eat it  Pass  <EOR> Save ur money    chipotle    wasnt verry appealing all gave try   best burrito but hey people work inside friendly   <EOR> Just average food    between chipotle zabas   staff welcoming but pretty pricey average bowl  Only white rice cabbage style lettuce  <EOR> I'd wanting try Moe's some time now when saw offering groupon knew chance give them try  husband Friday night dinner some other reviews confused menu  Almost immediately concerned decision choosing Moe's  only 1 person working she 3 customers ahead only she making food but also working register  looked down line food place mess  When finally came turn order advised rice  disappointed but completely turned off decided come back later date  following Monday husband returned redeem groupon  front told employee use groupon   bit nervous bowl being assembled clumpy rice strange film beans barely enough chicken white green lettuce top off scoop sour cream which scrapped bottom container   When register presented groupon then told second employee can't use groupon Monday because $5 99 Monday burrito special  then said would pay full price just could use groupon  some back forth discussion where filled rice issue Friday night clear weren't going accept groupon  told employee would purchasing food would canceling groupon order would never step foot restaurant again  He looked said OK  How's customer service? <EOR> I found menu confusing when settled option didn't seem rhyme reason flow employee took down afterwards  Big empty restaurant  <EOR> I really want Moe's but don't think can  eaten four times  All late afternoon evenings  never enough staff food always 'out' something  Today final straw  flour salad bowls regular bowl  rice hard crunchy skipped beans customer front ordered them thick line crust around container sitting long also grilled onions  did offer new grilled onions which did placed them right back same dirty container   chicken last she scooped said  almost full order chicken   Then cold section where basically sour cream  Now sure more girl asked someone more but never came  accepted fact half order sour cream  When over salsa bar poor salsa suffered same issue beans  Just large thick ring dried salsa sides    As eating small child no more 3 years old emerges double doors kitchen starts running around where sad food peeped into whatever order  mother apparently worked he work  watched climb across table then sit dirty floor under same table proudly walk back food prep area    The rice hard crunchy chicken DRY and dry chicken but couldn't even stomach it everything cold    Hopefully health district comes visits them serve some hot non crusted food  <EOR> Very basic burrito quality everything low  chips even good  wasn't terrible just other places burrito much better <EOR> Like say only chance first impression   impressed first visit Moe's  I felt menu little confusing names references popular culture identify food offerings no ingredient description   think missed mark  example Art Vandalay    love show Seinfeld but does tell burrito? Could latex? Definitely sure where going one     The staff definitely new could used more guidance MOD better things cellphone while register mention personality brick wall     I chose burrito visit Art Vandalay which seemed end half burrito because small size   All items sitting hot cold well pans down line choose your toppings    steak which little chewy sitting well long maybe?   Moe's offers combo $2 89 add which includes drink choice side   Moe's famous Queso dip which 2 Oz $1+ itself    crazy thought   offer salsa bar 5 6 types varying spice level  tried several none which tantalized taste buds   Warm tortilla chips come your burrito which nice touch   This location some opportunities improve guest service enhance experience   2 3 staff kept dissappearing back leaving newest guy front handle several guests lunch rush  saw 3 people leave waiting several minutes no acknowledged them   guy looked he supposed charge obviously no interest being work today lack engaging people pay salary    I high expectations Moe's episode Undercover Boss  food looked awesome concept seemed great  However think BOSS needs few more visits concept sink Downtown Summerlin  <EOR> Best fast casual mexican place game  Love queso chips chicken hot sauce also very tasty  Moe's whenever am area one  location few times recent trip Vegas  <EOR> I  very pleasantly surprised place!  good twice week!  Great food atmosphere friendly employees! <EOR> Apparently   original version Chipotle Zabas type eateries    This first unless every other place Cafe Rio Zabas Chipotle etc town closes down last visit  Ok  Let take back    Even if all close down feel comfortable saying never willingly coming back    The place empty maybe food prepped dried withered while waiting customers?  All know portions small flavorless   staff less enthusiastic place dirty      Maybe weekend staff par  hopefully wasn't best day    Hopefully your experience better  <EOR> This place looks nice but  it  staff inattentive don't hear welcome Moes  food looks sitting several days  chips tasted stale  top off HAIR food! Vegas Moes sucks ass!! need back real Moes Atlanta  <EOR> If could give zero stars would  always empty no matter day time no wonder service far worst  food good either  Moes other locations throughout country terrible  total four times happened 1  Walked husband 11 workers person said anything us  finally ask someone going take order? 2  charged things did buy  3  again charged things did buy  order wrong  kids menu says apple juice don't leaving three year old gets juice only treat extremely upset  asked speak manager told duty  asked reimbursed overcharge told able return when manager there  Unbelievable  stole me!  After visit 3 called store spoke manager Brianna  told happened she said return store receipt would comp value receipt    Visit 4 wait workers call Brianna  She denied comp  even spoke phone  gave date time spoke  She said she remembered conversation but did remember saying she would comp meal    We left  Absolutely disgusted place never return  <EOR> Having eaten Moe's several times before across east coast wife very excited see new location opening Summerlin  very high expectations sadly those expectations met  portion sizes smaller used prices worth meal received   Besides food staff most part seemed very miserable  Some very bad attitudes while others no idea going around them  restaurant very busy time no excuse being miserable    The cleanliness restaurant left something desired  While employee sweeping floor tables dirty garbage overflowing   Overall experience very disappointed  may attempt dining again few months once figure way  <EOR> The food ok overall place better Rainbow but hell happened location now?!? girls originally opened location gone along great customer service  feel bad people haven't gone Moe's anywhere else because Vegas isn't representing Moe's well all  <EOR> I places where counter choose your own ingredients  Moe's ordered Earmuff Burrito Bowl Rice Chicken Cheese Black Olives Mushrooms Sour Cream Guacamole Bacon  But even though Baconaholic confess I'd leave off Bacon next visit  you know less more  Otherwise great composition would definitely order again  chips light crispy guacamole fresh tasty  into spicy food mild but salsa bar those want more heat  those wonderful beverage machines infinite choices sodas The servers friendly plenty seating even some outdoors  certainly coming back! <EOR> Bought Groupon gets star being cheap  Wish food resembled pictures  Nothing worth eating again opinion  many other places town don't know why would ever back place didn't taste very good didn't stock anything Whole grains even though menu  <EOR> Went eat first time   guy working kept calling boss which annoying   meat didn't look fresh all cold   wanted ground beef but only little bit left looked very old     The food line area looked very messy   When picked tacos both fell apart instantly eat them fork    food simply wasn't very good  <EOR> I very surprised flavorful food was  stack blown away good both ingredients salsa were  salsas hot sauces available truly complete food range well mild hot  all delicious well  customer service restaurant ambience also perfect! Can't wait eat again! <EOR> The food okay  Nothing spectacular  stick local Zabas  staff wasn't inviting  Didn't even welcome in    Plus understand menu?! Can't just normal menu says crazy names?! <EOR> Very good burrito fresh guacamole good  back  downtown Summerlin next 5 guys  staff very nice restaurant clean  salsa bar your salsa very tasty hot  free chips your order  chips warm perfect amount salt them  <EOR> I've always eaten Moe's whenever visit East coast excited when found opened Vegas  Moe's earns good solid 2 5*s but bumped 3 because two things burrito bowls easily customize low carb leave rice beans two good small salsa bar spice things up!   This Moe's location big inside lots easy parking you don't park mall's garage which nice   interior new clean spacious  employees friendly welcoming seemed happy help newbies decipher menu    Bonus points having those amazing customize your own Coke machines 500 drink options   also Southern style sweet brewed iced tea   Moe's lot Chipotle where down assembly line tell employees behind counter want add your burrito  love being able customize meal  Moe's doesn't any seafood options but grilled tofu a big plus vegan friends     I visited Tuesday night around 7 pm place mostly empty  No lines no crowds all  ordered burrito bowl low carb no rice beans  opted grilled chicken breast added extra meat the steak   VERY disappointed portion sizes meat  amount puny first thought forgot extra meat  eaten Moe's many times even less normal amount meat other locations  aware screw amount meat here    Yes Moe's expensive get  left hungry added side chips queso the cup queso small should embarrassed charge charge 5 bites cheese paid extra extra meat  chips bad don't waste your money    I think expense relation portion size would eat regularly  know location just opened maybe employees need training amount meat serve  just seemed stingy meat portions  least guy loaded pico cheese! Overall happy another quick service Mexican style option town  <EOR> Welcome Moe's love Moe's! every Saturday amazing every time  band camp bowl black pinto beans which amazing perfectly seasoned  am personally fan topping not Moe's but general so stick onions green peppers Guac  occasion tofu top! also complimentary chips    Yum!   I always taken but love interior building  great vibe it  Every time find self enjoying more    The employees nail customer service! welcomed every time come in   does everyone else  always see same people always strike conversation!   They outdoor seating option those love eating outside    Parking hassle but Moe's fault!   You also sign emails lots cool information  <EOR> This would second time coming much different zabas chipotle same concept choose your option add would like  smaller options burritos granted only pay $1 less but little bit smaller  offer free chips least eating sure take salsa bar  Salsa ok fantastic world but good  Really no complaints its bit closer home any other southwest grill prices aren't badly price also considering downtown summerlin  Guess made review just little early just watched guy spray window cleaner windows between customer food  Now understand closing probably soon but wait clean window until food removed least just spray paper towel then just wipe window down if needs clean spray window food sitting covered still tiny hole spoon sit dish sure if would come back evening <EOR> Fresh ingredients friendly staff! Definitely would recommend re order steak burrito bowl! <EOR> I've always wanted try Moe's! Grand opening great especially since all big wigs there! next time steak dried food consistent really ticks off measure every little piece food burrito yet comes guac yet barely any  staff doesn't seem know going most food over cooked under cooked such rice burrito  really wanted place but guess growing LA used REAL Mexican food place American lack flavors creativity leaves lot desire! <EOR> Deceptive best   decided use birthday offer  purchase additional large amount food family dinner   woman did speak English informed no accept offer   asked why advertise app store if don't honor any offers receive it  then handed paper off wall added photos   stated chosen participate offers aware any stores do   chose Baja Fresh food amazing!! also received burrito birthday thanked them spending another thirty dollars additional food   visiting Moe's again take care customers  use old bait switch draw unsuspecting patrons only rip them off  <EOR> Bland less fresh boring  Totally worth calories  Service good but food not  Kind pricy type food too  <EOR> Was hoping come try place hike Red Rock disappointed closed sign simply hung without care   food website look would challenge Cafe Rio but guess  case  Even companies own website says open which isn't true  Considering many places burritos tacos sure even bother trying come back place again  wonder why would close health district shut them down? Treat employees poorly don't staff keep open? Doesn't matter now lost customer  <EOR> Very very very slow service  Staff friendly  couldn't take credit debit cards  Buying gift card huge ordeal  pleasant experience all  mention getting into Downtown Summerlin nightmare  way out  Stop sign entrance backs everything onto main road  <EOR> If cold meat tiny portions no fresh ingredients then love place  LOVING Moe's Florida finally found across town made drive because much enjoyed Moes back home  start bad experience off bang employee making food friend possibly another employee day off ignored us  When she finished friend proceeded sit table conversation some boyfriend drama   with lots cursing  also no exchange currency friend charged food  point covering 5 year olds ears he can't hear language  should left immediately but driven all way across town  When another employee came help she very nice  But no black beans ready told could wait 10 minutes longer if wanted some  also last scoop cold dried chicken line  When asked if more again told would cook  husband asked more beef burrito told would extra charge  only reason gave them 1 star because queso good  way last queso next 2 people line told out  took almost 20 minutes time walked into door until sat down poor excuses $30 dinner  also asked discount due hem being ingredients told couldn't done  never wanted ask refund walk without paying until now  WORST experience ever  only thing could made any worse would bugs food if ended food poisoning  won't back recommend everyone even try  Disgusting disappointed! <EOR> I heard Moe's really good however thrilled experience  Just give idea Moe's pretty similar Chipotle but southern twist it  food good but expecting bit more food chain  service pretty weak most employees did know doing yet! offer nachos they huge quesadillas burritos tostadas tacos  liked fact lot toppings choose which free charge course sour cream guacamole  usually extra   Oh did mentioned Coca Cola lifestyle!!
