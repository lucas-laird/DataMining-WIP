directly across I Naba which oddly features South Decatur Boulevard address Saino Indian Nepali Kitchen sort place patrons 'stumble upon' storefront hidden well off both Streets behind Sinclair Gas Station yet claiming first Nepalese Himalayan Restaurant all Las Vegas concept seemed worthy investigation   Thus far gathering much its attention $9 95 lunch buffet still labeled hot cold tables showing selection good but mostly traditional Indian friend familiar such things decision partake dinner Saino driven largely staff's inability answer E mails explain phone whether la Carte options offered 11a 3p 6 o'clock arrival seeing five sat round table without single other patron present until quarter past seven   No doubt sizable menu all items detailed lengthy descriptions often proved inaccurate pictures some helped guide choices both table wall those looking attentive service probably best avoid Dinner Saino waiters seem more intent standing chatting colleagues adjusting Indian Pop Music refilling beverages assuring accuracy tickets water requiring repeated requests more occasion while double charges made items received some sold another never requested    expensive place waiter's reference Sysco Foods during discussion unexpected but same time brag worthy he made seem meal started off predictably crisp Bread served alongside Tamarind Mint Chutney first courses delayed due difficulty firing Tandoori despite arrival almost hour opening another odd statement crispy Pakora Onion Bhajji both fried anyway   Ignoring ubiquitous spelling mistakes menu but more perplexed number items inconsistent pricing online versus menu versus bill follow ups tasty fried vegetables delivered slow rollout Garlic Naan typical if particularly memorable large plate Aaloo Jeeraa

although very concept dish likely met disgust most diners diversity flavors textures found amidst stewed Goat Offal actually quite exemplary minerality liver times touch harsh while alveolar tubes presented well cooked calamari all beneath bold veil spicing   Particularly impressed Paneer Kulcha soft pockets cheese baked right into soft bread desserts bit disappointing particularly Saino sold Gajar Halva table still charged Suji Haluwaa something never seen prior but faintly resembling polenta its texture while Rice Pudding watery just fair to middling   THREE HALF STARS very worthwhile stop based only quality cuisine Saino Indian Nepali Kitchen's failures way service even prove challenge those expecting nothing more basics   particularly 'shocking' some ways but same time all acceptable considering omissions overcharges general lack speed must assume Lunch Buffet precludes some problems though la carte only way order most more interesting authentic Nepalese plates  <EOR> Not knowing until other day Indian restaurant just around corner work decided check carry out order   The young lady working night very friendly food bagged ready shortly arrival   Carry out quick simple   As food pretty darn good   chicken saag full flavor though could tad spicier    vegetarian aloo dish ordered extremely good well   naan also quite tasty   For two dropped easy $30 without
