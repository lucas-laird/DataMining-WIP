Cold food fries soggy hard shell tacos very little filling zero sauces  worst part didn't start eating until already highway home which means would turn around correct Del Taco  Leaving restaurant still hungry absolutely worst way leave   Why 2 stars? When home able re heat singular bean burrito turned tasty which saved review being 1 star  <EOR> Del taco always number food choice outside cooking home  When California Vegas service great but last time service horrible front desk did care all  <EOR> Being OC native home Del Taco hooked long time   Love fries more all other places exception In n out   Value can't beat  location clean friendly service  <EOR> This only place know turkey tacos  food actually good but NEVER leave without checking your food  only 1 time when food wasn't messed something wasn't left out  pain unwrap take everything bag before driving away but  only guarantee you're going ordered  French fries nacho cheese sauce Carmel cheesecake bite things worth hassle  If employees cared just little more customers would great  But fast food taco joint decent food keep going back fix  <EOR> If could give del taco 0 Star would  Awful drive through awful staff <EOR> Went del taco tonight farm Durango  Noticed pills food station!
