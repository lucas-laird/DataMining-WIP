NY strip tried both hot cold seafood platter appetizers I large group   steak juicy cooked perfectly  seafood ah mazing oysters lobster shrimp everything good plate served various sauces dipping  dessert birthday table ordered chocolate vanilla cakes share all die don't even really cake! Everything Morton's well  would recommend steakhouse any day! <EOR> My husband enjoyed 6th anniversary Morton's Las Vegas  both enjoyed crab cake appetizer  Coming non seafood lover saying lot  ordered filet bourbon sauce sauce BOSS! both shared carrot cake dessert  good well but little sweet me  service good  am sure visiting Morton's again  <EOR> I haven't Mortons nearly decade   During time numerous steak restaurants throughout Las Vegas elsewhere   even best steakhouses would always compare them memorable experience Mortons  while many them great none good Mortons   Well saying many years other places good Mortons and some recent bad experiences other steak restaurants Vegas  see other Yelp reviews decided back see if Mortons still good remembered    Long story short Mortons did disappoint   wait another decade before going back  Mortons definitely sets standard which all other restaurants should strive reach terms both customer service food quality   It birthday celebration   Mortons knew advance provided personalized menus name date top   Nice touch   Lady came during dinner offered take picture no charge   Later provided personalized Morton's paper frame we tipped $5    Another nice touch  better deal remember long time ago Cashman photogs patronizing places   Spouse enjoyed escargot appetizer the best she encountered  good presentation bread underneath great touch    She ordered seafood mix grill  crab cakes grilled shrimp shrimp Alexander   She thought shrimp Alexander overcooked salty but tried liked it   service overall experience made any minor flaws dish       I passed appetizer even though remember shrimp cocktail being very good I can't eat much could decade ago    steak house eat steak   ordered NY strip medium well    Order truffle fries table   don't know Morton's secret but know cook steak perfectly exactly want medium well just little pink yet steak warm juicy don't even need use any steak sauce eat which way judge steak  if enjoy without any steak sauce    steak simply amazing  just good Mortons     Finally dessert ordered chocolate lava cake   Came decorated plate would expect when special occasion dinner such fine dining establishment   dessert complimentary they didn't bring some cheap dessert give free  ordered dessert wanted gave complimentary     Sadly even though way all high end steak houses should more more seeing places such extra lengths   Mortons   still know means high end steakhouse provide customers fine dining experiences     If you've ever afraid going Mortons because chain let assuage those concerns   numerous other steak restaurants supposedly best  none them match Mortons   Many them come close but Mortons remains best book   wait another decade before going back  <EOR> My fiance wanted nice restaurant venue  WASN'T casino  for intimate 50 guest wedding wouldn't bother many vendors details decorating  looking plenty options and believe Vegas just many wandered into Morton's wandered completely sure Morton's it  event coordinator ball every question asked them children's menus available technological facilities wireless wired mic ipod connection projection screen 2 banquet rooms much freedom decorate what's party minimum i believe 20 25 people menus price per person what's included everything  even gave dates could visit facility before other wedding events could see set up  week later coordinator called some follow signed contract them soon thereafter   We never regretted it  entire time kept good communication sometimes asking details hadn't thought about  event coordinators professional ball warm friendly personal  responsive even smallest details asked them including getting names numbers all other vendors cake florist just case things didn't arrive while ceremony  also set decorations morning just asked them to  couldn't asked more    In keeping Morton's tradition food DELICIOUS atmosphere classy waitstaff very skilled professional honest paid more actually used the guests didn't drink much alcohol thought would gave check amount overpaid same day  refreshing breath many wedding horror stories hear where venues take newlyweds much can   Our wedding reception absolutely lovely  highly recommend Morton's anyone looking great intimate wedding venue  even nice date night  <EOR> My wife tried Morton's anniversary  impressed small touches printing happy 5th anniversary menus taking picture printing cardboard framing date giving free friendliness service excellent  course food top notch  Best Caesar salad ever though may favorite filet mingon perfectly cooked still great  shrimp monstrous stuffing made them even better  tend pricey upscale spots strip when celebrate occasions food Morton's only compared favorite places but bill 75%

  lyonnaise potatoes green beans sides both great   choice dessert deal chocolate lava cake personal favorite   Lots places chocolate lava cake now but none good Morton's   didn't visit but would also

The bill over $500 $600 but Morton's  Oh well  Just win back roulette table  Thank Morton's! <EOR> Morton's Steakhouse featured $99 Steak Seafood special Big F took advantage offer hoped would fine dining experience   The restaurant wasn't particularly overly busy past Friday seated table   waiter inquired beverage choices before telling menu   He soon returned cart held examples cuts beef available vegetables accompanied other various dining choices   bit overwhelming he over restaurant offers but worry since all menu anyway   They start off large loaf bread doesn't matter if you're dining yourself group still loaf onion bread  I did ask did leftover loaf hoping might donate something   No luck   Into trash goes! For salads both chose Morton's Salad Morton's Blue Cheese Dressing Chopped Egg Anchovies  combination romaine iceberg lettuce leaves   would help if cut leaves down bit because mess eat   dressing alright nothing special being own blue cheese dressing   anchovies added perfect saltiness but sure anchovies own   With special dinner single cut filet mignon comes choice appetizer   Broiled Sea Scallops Wrapped Bacon Apricot Chutney  Big F Jumbo Lump Crab Cake Mustard Mayonnaise Sauce  scallops good isn't good bacon?  sweetness chutney added nice contrast well   crab cake pretty good made lots crab less filler   could lot better though presentation meal   Big F's plate looked something missing!    However real problem both beef   Although perfectly cooked ordered rare ultimately tasteless   Now don't wrong   share filet mignons used smooth taste where meat melts your mouth feeling heaven landed your mouth   wasn't case here   wasn't just opinion tasteless beef Big F same page well   ultimately ask Worchestire sauce douse some flavor  It does come side Bearnaise Sauce but much better  Perhaps should said something staff entrees yes mistake   first time dining Morton's figure filets  The Big F usually gets Cajun Ribeye Steak when he's he no previous experience filet mignons either  choice side dishes Macaroni Cheese Hint Spice  Lyonnaise Potatoes  mac cheese alright   prefer smoother creamier texture but graininess it   Big F did choice pasta though   potatoes pretty tasty cooked lots onions   For dessert choices Chocolate Cake Key Lime Pie   Well wish knew actually called Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake because really good   molten center oozed nicely when cut into it   probably saving grace meal   But because finished tasteless piece meat stuffed finish dessert ice cream  In retrospect would brought meat home recooked instead  Big F's Key Lime Pie good good Chocolate Molten Cake though   probably would finished well if put meat side   Service good some points   beverage glasses never empty due water boys constantly refilling glasses   waiter checked once during meal  when asked Worchestire sauce   But don't recall coming around much that   Overall meal Morton's Steakhouse disappointing   Perhaps taste preferences just don't align Morton's does filet mignons here   raving reviews maybe just bad luck tasteless piece beef   Anyway don't see myself coming back anytime soon though   They happy hour reverse happy hour   advertised restrooms!
