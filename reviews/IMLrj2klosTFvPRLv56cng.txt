All signature dishes half off Mondays Tuesdays kids eat free purchase adult entree  missed restaurant if foodie! <EOR> I usually receive great service but tonight HORRIBLE want back  First off server Adrian took 10 minutes greet during which bus boy refilled water twice  Adrian didn't bring bread helped tables next several times deliberately ignored didn't ask if wanted another glass wine we spent over hour impersonal didn't smile  wanted nice relaxing dinner sister's last night town but instead rushed through dinner heck there  <EOR> There wasn't negative here    the service fantastic! served waited directly assistant GM attentive accommodating  food great   each ordered something different off menu frittata corn beef hash Biloxi chicken sandwich summer pizza grilled cheese no real complaint   well   the cute yet quirky ketchup bottle didn't really function well but cares    take cap off good go!  Prices great atmosphere great source things locally much possible  chefs made rounds could ask more! did scoop salted caramel ice cream showed made all scream ice cream!   They take reservation use it! <EOR> Again terribly understaffed  Again no idea server was  Again really wanted love place but man just going happen  Why why god's sake can't wonderful location menu ambiance just deliver promise? Well given all tries give  bother again  <EOR> It's very often any more excited try new burger town when really conscious effort set myself disappointment  Honey Salt recently opened Summerlin overall foodie very excited try new spot  While didn't often always enjoyed Nora's used space both menu farm to table concept its replacement gave much hope  impatiently waiting few weeks let crowds die down finally ventured dinner night and ran into foodie friend Splurgemonkey   Did disappoint?  The space itself doesn't look different remember exposed kitchen still display enjoy all madness food prep  large faux brick feature wall Honey Salt logo some nice simple decorations walls  room quite loud even full capacity but small table two cozy enough didn't much problem  several menus depending time day which won't bother replicating here  food all regionally grown tell menu offerings quality food receive pay attention they're putting dishes  heard many positive comments through friends online meals really wish could bit more burger but  still expecting something great come out   What did come perfectly crafted burger but absolutely no stand flavors whatsoever  meat really great quality cooked perfectly medium rare ordered but no strong beef flavor no char flavor no seasoning nothing  $1 optional egg top added very little did lettuce tomato even though all very good quality  butter pickles only strong good flavor noticed there  Even bun which good sweet smell almost nothing going on  could easily become perfect burger if secret sauce just right additional ingredient  All other food night flavorful delicious should too  girlfriend's steak great seasoning some fantastic sauces it why did beef different treatment one? fact adding roasted Anaheim salsa comes filet even potato bacon hash burger would incredible but shouldn't order side offering better   Oddly enough fries fantastic cooked crispy consistent throughout  great flavor better lot around town considering unassuming looked  very saddened burger said everything else ate night heavily seasoned flavorful delicious but burger plain frustrating  $15 really couldn't recommend  just far much Summerlin location even considering quality ingredients  entire meal which included two cocktails appetizer two main dishes dessert came $115 tip which found way much off strip location  usually skip dessert when bit odd but girlfriend skipped getting any sides meal which would easily increased total even subtracting cheap ish dessert  Some other dinners saw around table looked great although maybe bit small portion size given cost  If you're looking strictly burger advice can't recommend Honey Salt time would rather send across street Flemings  <EOR> I've few times over past few years every time place continues impress me   Fatima simply best waitresses Las Vegas  food delicious service great if haven't yet why waiting? Try buttermilk chicken sandwich steak eggs biscuits bacon gravy pass blood orange mimosa! <EOR> Wife Saturday night   Nice decor interesting atmosphere diverse crowd    I swordfish she scallops   scallops great good flavor nice portion   Swordfish average small portion bite salty next few good odd  Finished apple pie salted caramel ice cream   crust underdone very pasty doughy no discernible seasoning filling couple apple seeds   ice cream ok remarkable all  For type prices expect much more     The coffee really good nice roast  <EOR> Great happy hour delicious drinks food  Quiet place open layout  slight issue cooking dough but immediately resolved which appreciate  If looking quick bite extended stay place nice choice especially because happy hour prices   <EOR> Had such high hopes place  Gave three stars service which highlight great server  But besides Mac cheese didn't care food heavy salt  Brioche tad eggy  Really cool look place but just wouldn't recommend it  <EOR> After reading numerous reviews Biloxi fried chicken sandwich $13 being described Chick fil A crack definitely intrigued  avid Chick fil A fan fact probably fave fast food chain  Unfortunately closest location LA but whenever area point stop by   I vehemently disagree other reviews one  When order fried chicken sandwich expect certain amount crispy crunchy texture  Honey Salt's rendition more grilled chicken sandwich albeit decent lacks sufficient fried goodness  addition Durkee's dressing sauce utterly forgettable  only Chick fil A's chicken selection sauces vastly superior but also much better value  Alternatively I'd rather southern fried chicken sandwich Cheesecake Factory across street Boca Park  chopped salad comes utter disappointment well  consisted radishes edamame carrots kale pumpkin seeds cubes sharp cheddar cheese mixed greens  interesting collection but ultimately flavors neither harmonious nor enjoyable   The blueberry pancakes lemon curd $13 nice fluffy texture inside but lacked any sort exterior crispiness hallmark really good pancake   Dessert highlight  triple layer cake $9 very interesting tasty  consisted dense chocolate cake layered fudge banana cake cardamom coated buttercream frosting  Although bit pricey portion size could more moist item would probably order again   As service    let's start back beginning  being seated server Julie asks kind bottled water want drink  decline ask tap water  She then asks if would snack some edamame while peruse menu  thinking complimentary ESPECIALLY since see edamame listed ANYWHERE brunch menu say okay  brunch selections bread basket comes some sort bean dip  first bit confused  she meant edamame? edamame dip? If why isn't green? BTW bread lavosh totally unremarkable  Several minutes later edamame sprinkled some citrus zest  end adding some salt pepper because bland  shocker when bill shows charged $7 edamame! both instantly infuriated  wouldn't ordered edamame begin certainly $7! mood argue server and or manager tipped less normally would even wrote brief note why  tolerate slow inattentive service certain degree but deception trickery run bill  looked around noted few other tables said yes edamame well  found odd none other numerous Yelp reviews tips mention non complimentary edamame   In summary food itself rates 3 stars  Deceptive aggressive upcharging knocks down 2 star experience overall   Consider yourself warned  JUST SAY NO EDAMAME! COMPLIMENTARY DEFINITELY WORTH $7! <EOR> Incredible friendly casual environment superb service fantastic menu   table grew size friends unexpectedly arrived staff more gracious accommodating   sampled drinks appetizers entrees even some items off menu   Table wide consensus Fantastic! <EOR> Went lunch first time Honey Salt Grain Power salad fanominal  Perfect citrus taste completely healthy  highly recommend  <EOR> Amazing food! staff very nice extremely accommodating  ordered all starters calamari amazing flatbreads die for!

Overall restaurant beautiful food very good environment welcoming chic   food and drinks bit overpriced warranting 4 stars instead 5     We arrived around NOON 30 minutes open seated right away   left around 1 30 still some empty tables     FOOD share bill $47   Whoa right   Here's $47 Sunday brunch off Strip you   starters shared New England Fry   yummy but small portion price   Two bloody orange mimosas set back $20   Again overpriced mimosa   ordered Filet Mignon stacked sliders egg cream spinach   comes side roasted potatoes   All all good but didn't quite give OH GEEZ awesomeness hoped for   dessert shared Cookie Platter which includes 3 large warm fresh baked cookies     The brunch menu bit odd me   would see few more breakfast items menu pancakes french toast monkey bread   looking IHOP food but think chefs could bit more creative  use other breakfast foods      Am glad tried Honey Salt?  YES  Will back Honey Salt soon?  PROBABLY unless announce offer two for one drinks! If another $50 spend brunch would again?  NO would try different place  <EOR> This place yummy but just basic pizza  agree another reviewer food being super creative we large group but creative   the name Honey Salt! brownie dessert name?! husband raved second time which came for  Wah! <EOR> A friend looking great off strip experience  found more honey salt  fantastic drinks delicious food impeccable service very happy come  servers bartenders amicable eager please and above beyond correct steak came little more rare comfortable   manager Monica stopped made some excellent recommendations only dessert but also other bars should sure check while Vegas  All around best eating experiences while would recommend strongly anyone living visiting Las Vegas  <EOR> Made reservation day ahead  When arrived AC down   customer would expected courtesy warning when made reservation    The food alright nothing great exceptional  Portion decent there's that  <EOR> Adrian server  He very attentive friendly  enjoyed dinner loved crispy spiced Parmesan Lavosh    back <EOR> Slow service  Waited 20 min entree salad never came  Brought food didn't order  walked out  <EOR> Second time visiting first disappointed   seated straight away offered water immediately drinks within another minute  ordered three apps tuna tartare burrata salad smoked peach salad all die for! whole sea bass pork chop equally fantastic bread pudding best ever tasted  Service impeccable ambiance great cool relaxing   back  Again  again     <EOR> Very nice surprise neighborhood restaurant   There enormous amount help door floor maybe because Friday night  first thought guest opened door but soon realized wait staff very casually dressed jeans any top they could find   All all garb approach interesting  The restaurant cavernous big floor tables center settees walls  Sitting six meant slide 3 adults settee full length table where thought maybe should pull tables allow easier seating  Since smaller tables placed together would easy accomplish  Back cavernous big floor  Because very little materials restaurant would attenuate some noise place tendency becoming very loud addition music kept high volume other words if want talk person sitting across you'll find yourself shouting  However loudness adds sense electricity around  think most people dining around enjoying themselves did  The food good shared four appetizers but did come serving spoons forks  made sharing bit strange since only utensils your own using fork already eaten would certainly prevent your table guests dipping into dish  resorted sliding things off plates knives   I NY Steak which well prepared hint sea salt over it  enjoyed it  did enjoy much spinach came it  sauce just thin  Eating spinach fork meant trailing thin sauce across plate  opted eat it  appetizers four sides ordered share did come serving spoons  Same results above  Personally only tried would enjoyed trying others if could only spoon them  I tried swordfish well prepared but any fish seafood if impeccably fresh its presence known  realize desert getting fresh catch day challenging  We enjoyed place but giving five stars would meant everything perfect  Maybe next visit happy add additional star  <EOR> Dinner fabulous! scallops perfect  salads also amazing! Monica server best  back  <EOR> The food wine good  service horrible   reservation 8 30 p m  did seated until almost 9 00 p m   Took another half hour receive appetizer whereby complained manager   service improved  <EOR> I would want give place another before finalizing opinion  thought atmosphere very cute country feeling  dinner ordered swordfish $27   Honestly thought okay  great Tripple George downtown but there  friend ordered pizza  cooked perfectly  service pretty good but hostest seemed bit overwhelmed times  Would visit again  <EOR> This more 4 5 star place   I visited Honey Salt month ago business trip Las Vegas  try stay away Strip all costs when come Vegas   this restaurant fit bill perfectly!

Props chef!   Overall amazing experience  Definitely try place out! bit pricey but its good place date <EOR> I came friend Sunday brunch 11 00 promptly seated hostess  little confusing first because hostess showed table then another man brought drinks finally server came over help us  Good service just more people am used to    Feeling underwhelmed choices prices small latte monkey bread $9   friend Sam frittata $13 if remember correctly cup regular coffee  monkey bread basically jazzed Cinnabon boozy bourbon sauce   tasty but cloyingly sweet  latte just okay espresso notes mostly getting lost milk    The vibe strange because first glance appears cute cafe but connecting booths wall feel more cafeteria  sat elbow's distance away group people having business meeting which slightly uncomfortable    Maybe come back check dinner scene but far brunch Honey Salt pretty standard fare upscale price  <EOR> Never disappoints!  creature habit usually same thing grain power add chicken  dream salad  also halibut which amazing born raised Alaska know good halibut turkey meatballs must starter well flatbread pizzas  ice cream salted Carmel nothing before  good  Baked apple pie bread pudding also die for  Absolutely Summerlin beauty regards restaurants  <EOR> Staff great fun Drinks delicious many levels Scallops melt your mouth Ambience hip trendy yet comfortable  Avocado toast good but favorite  Brookie dessert great ice cream <EOR> Came brunch daughters bday  Bottomless mimosas favorite  no complaining there  say food just ok  breakfast pizza tasty but crust mushy  breakfast sandwich very good breakfast nachos also tasty   chicken fingers kids menu well done fries done enough    waitress working herself death  appeared understaffed  felt rushed trying clear plate while still fork hand   before excited again but disappointed <EOR> Food reliably great  Service also strong  Hostess nice quick seat us  Asst server ? Named Jade drinks refilled water 3 times before order taken  wasn't long wait order  Nick goatee helpful complimentary  Really great service all around   Farmer toast fun alternative regular bread  Wife lives grilled octopus  Salmon bomb  squash  any way ahi tuna   get now! <EOR> Not returning! Only 1 star good food food flavors rest forgettable! Way over priced portions 4 5oz Salmon $25 left hungry ounce Bourbon $11? tried vibe almost $300 4 us  Even though empty tables where rushed 1 point did finish appetizer? cleared prior being finished? Good Luck <EOR> We just around corner yelp'd nearby restaurants Honey Salt popped up!  actually heard place friend few months ago try it   especially interested trying fried chicken sandwich but silly me dinner menu!  Just few notes We seated right away   first thing noticed restaurant's name LITERALLY everything haha  It's little dim restaurant fact older groups surrounding table actually using flashlight apps phones read menu  My boyfriend wearing jeans t shirt which made stick sore thumbs! The chef hanging front whole time didn't greet any customers walk any tables including special event going on   may seem nitpicky but seemed weird he just kinda doing nothing whole time! Meal sizes small   complaint just observation case you're reading planning dinner budget! large seafood selection!  First based recommendation server very friendly ordered grilled octopus $16    tender nice char sauce underneath other components all fit pretty well together   Unfortunately bus boy took plate without asking if finished!  We shared special $30 two 5oz  Lamb porter house steaks cooked medium rare    perfectly cooked swear tasted some type Indian Mediterranean flavors jus   lot savor but we're supposed thinking quality over quantity!  Finally ordered two desserts brookie bread pudding   love good bread pudding moist drenched sauce   great bread pudding pretty disappointed!  HUGE serving comparable rubix cube SUPER dry   enough sauce wasn't gooey sickeningly sweet bread pudding supposed be! brookie chocolate chip cookie housed brownie salted caramel icecream top   All components good but sure dessert worth $9    ***FYI 2 desserts much!***   Overall dinner totalled $68 not including tip   <EOR> I've never even heard place until sister wanted family brunch  family already ordered  food came shortly them which nice   fairly small brunch menu but everything delish! tuna  light fresh  love uniform waiters  Service good even though pretty busy  <EOR> I've four five times  food always excellent! service getting better    Last time lunch  sat kind forgot about  server came once noticed bringing things all tables around bread drinks etc  kind started looking around few minutes when man suit tie came right over asked if wanted order gave bread came back drinks  pretty sure he might GM he great  really sure happened server but he stepped took charge    I definitely believe trying  food great    and if little patience service looking up!   I'll back  <EOR> Second time here  First time fabulous  time service horrible  celebrate husband's birthday wanted take place before thought would great   disappointed   First received stale hard dinner rolls  Last time fresh crusty outside light air inside but time so  butter dinner rolls last time filled top could see honey black salt but time half filled hardly any salt no visible honey  ordered fish fry delicious  Next ordered main dishes side creamed corn  main dishes but side corn  waitress never came over main dishes served until 15 20 minutes later main dishes almost gone see if everything ok which point told never corn  Another 10 minutes later corn arrived  already done meal when arrived  Then waited another 10 15 minutes table cleared before waitress came over see if wanted desert because movie planned could take chance poor service order dessert bill declined dessert bill paid walking tall gentleman assumed manager owner asked husband everything husband said don't want know  apparently he didn't because he let walk right without asking issue was   Sorry say experience left bad taste mouth probably returning  closing note  place empty when arrived 6 30 p m   would overlook poor service if place crowded waitress lot tend but tonight opposite  <EOR> If want boujie brunch spot place go! super cute inside good Instagram pictures  But food selection favorite  don't many options other salads  There's many other Brunch spots  cute way more options  <EOR> I higher expectations place   I came girlfriend Saturday night  Place dead    not good sign Location pretty bad stuck between pottery barn boutique shop outside doesn't look much   Inside very chic cute  plate your food open all tables see which thought unique   Staff very friendly management stopped check us  Sadly waiter could care less us  Never checked even though table right next stand where plug your orders  He gave off worst vibe   killed mood  ask dessert menu water other waiters staff!  The Food The food actually pretty good  Small portions high price amount food don't fooled pictures  But quality flavor really good  must say presentation all dishes fantastic!  Tuna Tartar Good! Flavor amazing fresh!  Beet Salad Great flavor presentation  Steak Salad Steak great flavor   just very much it  Salmon recommended could better Salmon overcooked pass  Scallops Slightly overcooked but sauce amazing! flavor dish excellent   Blueberry Bread Pudding needed served piping hot luke warm pass  Apple Pie needed crumble some sort nuts ok  Brookie Awesome! Especially salted caramel ice cream   Order bottle Cabernet didn't expect much but wasn't good all  On menu marked $30 bottle bill hit $50   so beware! Overall experience 3 left slightly disappointed hoping much more  <EOR> Upscale yet cozy  Perfect Summerlinites  <EOR> I really looking forward dining experience here  special evening planned folks visiting  came Austin thought farm table good! don't think anything glaringly bad experience but left feeling very uninspired feel when looking dishes 20 30 range entrees  truly feel menu needs overhaul don't feel items really stood any creative way  parents live around corner restaurant but unfortunately experience very memorable can't imagine going way back again  <EOR> Really delicious food  definitely come again! location little hard find thank goodness Google maps but once meal very pleased  Keep good food! <EOR> So LV business saw exceptionally high number favorable reviews stopped dinner  Adrian waiter rest staff Mgr could more friendly  farm table menu amazing  Check beet salad ordered awesome  Adrian found visiting area kind enough give taste wonderful desserts entice come back more food week since several days  <EOR> Delicious  duck salad pretty close being good Hakasan's duck salad  definitely back try rest menu  farm table fresh ever changing menu  <EOR> This place ok   Food decent   Happy hour burger chicken should come 2 just 1 sliders   many windows place but keep pretty bright   Twice drink ingredients featured drinks menu   Most annoying thing both times only bartender 5pm Friday    bartender drinks bar restaurant everything very slow took long time   Very un Summerlin them  <EOR> Overall good restaurant just very limiting taste I've Honey Salt  few times since they've opened  when say limiting try stay away bread pasta legumes  Both times lunch steakhouse salad absolutely loved it  dinner Filet Mignon Fried Chicken  Filet ordered once then next trip husband ordered it  Both times wasn't cooked order seems cooking steaks might cooks strong suit  both eat steak medium mine came barely cooked all husbands medium well  But filets good grass fed   The fried chicken special night awesome! only thing didn't care plate corn salsa but huge salsa fan  chicken free range   The best part place desert brookie die for!

<EOR> Super unprofessional   drove all way Henderson only find closing 45 min early   walked 9 15 said usually close 10pm but since slow decided close kitchen 45 min early   <EOR> So rate restaurant 4 stars FOOD location general appeal  Unfortunately service  third time dining service never stood   food wine list both very unique creative  give lot credit designer venue nailed small details salt scrub bathroom custom napkins   Well done    I give some credit Rodrigo busser    He attentive friendly even more server  <EOR> My boyfriend town CES longer anyone should ever spend Las Vegas without living there  sick overcrowded overpriced scene strip found Honey Salt short search  only 25 minute $25 dollar UBER ride strip worth short trek eat such fun cozy spot  Everything delicious fresh  Seems hip spot Vegas locals but well worth short trip newly developed part town  Try it! <EOR> The setting decor nice  outdoor area also great amenity  staff friendly helpful  There's great selection menu especially someone doesn't eat seafood  food decent  Maybe even better decent  But little pricey  <EOR> I visited honey salt over past few years awhile since last visit  time around honestly say less impressive past experiences  last experience disappointing because always spoke highly restaurant based off food service  food mediocre compared pricing  Normally pricing doesn't faze if food meets price   However if return items due under over cooked temperatures disappointing  Also menu supposed based off farm table seasonal ingredients hasn't dieviated last time here  menu lacks imagination previous chefs before hand  Staples items aren't failures but lack execution change are   The service ok  horrible but best expected based off business brand nor previous experiences    often found myself asking busser service because he only around  <EOR> Amazing food great service! Love beautiful ambiance too! Brookie bread pudding must! Love use local produce too  <EOR> Has potential great restaurant however service absolutely terrible  The server took time greet didn't bother check once food arrived hunt down check  The food ok <EOR> When initially opened Honey Salt amazing  last two times gone in past 3 months experience mediocre all around  food wasn't good service definitely same  Hopefully some changes real soon  want 5 star rating! <EOR> This great place frequented Vegas locals   market salad great salmon grilled cheese  desserts awesome too  busy reservation good idea  great lunch deal twenty bucks  Also they'd nice salt scrub bathroom  <EOR> This first experience Honey Salt  very large party 20 girls waitress great patience made sure everyone always needed  breakfast sandwich which yummy! girls around breakfast nachos which loved!

Nah homey  thing screamed butter I asked some obliged   Also purée some crushed pink peppercorns which didn't sense culinarily bit off putting   For appetizer shared New England Fry combination clams belly calamari  sure battered them in   maybe semolina polenta? But weren't crispy I'd them be  creamy sauce little kick which liked served blistered whole shishito chiles  would've preferred them sliced pickled because dish could use some acid  Overall flavor but lacked some finesse   My wife ordered salmon  Pretty ordinary  also rare middle  salmon med rare medium but rare  garnishes peppadew sauce quinoa pilaf good themselves but couldn't stand big flavor fish  Overall dish felt muddled confused   I chose scallops  Definitely star show  roasted cauliflower herb salad served delicious  did some problems plate though  Lets just keep vanilla where belongs shall we? Good dessert  Does belong cauliflower purée  Also detected no truffle flavor truffle sauce  scallops though perfectly cooked more made minor indiscretions   The Mac Cheese very good well  liked added some peppers kale it  gave flavor subtle vegetal quality which welcome   Overall food fell flat  Kinda review  Meh    <EOR> My family yesterday because town visitor  young child typically any restaurants website first scope going order  looked own website decided Shrimp Scampi    When arrived busy all  much construction could hardly tell where restaurant was  construction guys indiscriminately dropping pieces facade off roof down cement walkway where customers walking watch falling objects! seated waiter came right over  happy hour ends six few people party wanted glass wine  asked if could order during happy hour which ending five minutes  waiter grumbled but agreed  DD ordered coke  looked menu he gave didn't see Shrimp Scampi dish asked it  waiter told menu changes seasonally shouldn't trust websites yelp predetermine meal he said condescending way bit attitude some reason   told YOUR website advertises menu he said well someone should change then shouldn't they? he walked off    He brought everyone's wine asked if he anything else  asked coke ordered he said oh yeah grab kind stood there  told I'd drink now no ready order because least three going order Shrimp Scampi     Two people ordered Scallops which extremely salty but other ok  other two people order burger salmon which said fine  ordered chicken which super dry Mac cheese looked old didn't even try broccoli served side  end meal asked coffee which warm very weak some people ordered dessert  dessert seemed best thing everyone agreed good     The reason two star review waiter gave attitude inquiring dish own website general mediocrity food addition heavy construction going on  doubt back but wife raced brunch she probably still eat here  <EOR> I love try local places vs chain restaurants when out  place keeper!! food fresh delish  Service good taffy grab end meal your way yummy  Next time visit Vegas back  <EOR> Got clams calamari go  Very greasy pour oil container  Would return seafood <EOR> I've heard lot rave reviews Honey Salt but little disappointed finally trying out  party two Sunday Brunch able OpenTable reservation noon placed reservation 11am didn't wait  ended waiting anyway party 8 walking just but still getting seated first overhearing didn't reservation but knew someone     It took really long time talk server whom saw only once more when he came bring check that request someone else   Also servers don't wear nametags wear jeans plain shirts hard tell customer server   We ordered Monkey Bread start which even though wasn't taste boyfriend said best he'd ever had  He ordered steak egg sliders breakfast potatoes raved potatoes  ordered backyard burger decent burger but nothing write home about  Prices little steep    I ordered soft drink he ordered ice tea glasses sat empty most meal polished off drinks halfway through monkey bread starter  sure if ask refills if charged extra but little annoying    One other thing place LOUD very little absorb noise  larger equally packed rooms loud here    Some dishes good but slow inattentive service noise level probably stop coming back  <EOR> We lunch reservations but ended waiting 15 minutes before seated only busser working  Two star rating mainly poor service plenty servers bustling around but  took forever someone take order then none bothered check us  Perhaps shouldn't surprised  oh so trendy yuppy place but paid huge attention celebrity there  Very noisy tables close together  Food so so overpriced better cheaper similar restaurant  <EOR> My place whenever am traveling through Las Vegas!!!!

Love those thangs!!! Full licquor bar few drafts Scrimshaw plus!   I really looking forward loving place but value came short small portions ideas great but flavors fall bit short    little salt long way but its name food     shishito peppers best part      C <EOR> It's good 20 min drive strip! But attracted high reviews here  Wasn't expecting much esp coming NYC where american brunches plenty  surprised but cute spacious interior  Very much theninside  someone's living room    The host waitress very nice! food Honey Salt power lunch Caesar salad fried chicken sandwich bread pudding  stepdad power lunch Caesar salad burger salted caramel ice cream  mom trout  also free appetizer when yelp check ordered farmers toast  chicken fried very well ! didn't bread much  But coleslaw complimented well  moms trout cooked well she decent sized portion  stepdad extremely full burger esp since he bacon egg    Dessert yummy smaller portion size which great Cuhs all stuffed end it  Overall wouldn't stop again just because far but def thought food high quality flavorful good pric e <EOR> Great food atmosphere   really enjoy outdoor dining well small sidewalk section accommodate   Service bit off when busy but experienced anything impacted overall experience   wonderful items both lunch dinner menu   aware portions human sized massive American platefuls often accustomed chain restaurants   Treat yourself Bananas Foster French Toast sometime   won't regret it  <EOR> Finally chance try trendiest place town eat at  live south side journey traveling all way just grab bite lunch  passed Rampart Commons numerous times but never actually shopped any stores  immediately notice more half cars luxury cars range rovers appearing most welcome Summerlin guess?   Anyway Honey Salt tucked corner larger sign would probably help them more noticeable don't already good marketing tactics  Apon walking inside remember walls mainly composed bricks  restaurant definitely trying give off farm vibe but definitely modern classy same time  chandelier farm though? Haha guess accent piece   already knew going order chicken sandwich because Misti Anthony said reviews  Chick Fil crack ay? Prior food arriving received bread crispy things almost pita chips but much thinner  bread very similar even identical Filipinos call pan de sal but wheat version  Nothing special but cripy things rather good fun dip into white bean dip puree according friend? food came pretty quick maybe 15 minutes so? friend raved good kale salad last time she point she even dreamt it  Thankfully chicken sandwich came salad kale looking forward since never kale before  chicken sandwich rather stuffed but  expect when paying $13  breading chicken pretty good honey mustard probably favorite part  Usually isn't enough sauce sandwiches but prefect amount  Nice slaw inside sandwich well  Overall good but don't know if something back flips over if know mean? side salad mainly composed edamame little bit kale lot seeds I don't know kind was but which good  Maybe some type vinaigrette would nice? friend ordered meatballs offered bite okay too  server Julie pretty good except felt point kind lost her  service definitely better expected based early reviews when first started  Lastly ordered chocolate cake dessert! OMG good probably best pieces cake ever had  3 layer cake banana cake middle  thought really nice wouldn't overwhelming chocolate  frosting outside cake light fluffy overly sweet   think if came again might just order dessert since other options seem delicious  <EOR> Honey Salt all fanfare decor even clientele bougie LA brunch spot  Even menu sounds amazing appetizing  However brunch food fell quite short expectations    While loved open kitchen breakfast brunch offerings taken aback flavorless meal was  ended trying $10 avocado toast local tomato arugula  basically two pieces burnt toast cut half spread avocado halved cherry tomatoes sprig arugula  Let's face overpriced avocado toast just isn't same if California  Unfortunately nothing special    For meal tried buttermilk fried chicken sandwich which sounded amazing  chicken came somewhat dry slaw flavorless  couldn't taste house dressing all  If only chicken dressed something more flavorful maybe some honey salt  revelation would been!   The house corned beef hash featured cubed beef roasted vegetables two poached eggs  pet peeve anyone eating breakfast should poached eggs overcooked  egg runny while other yolk rock solid  Again dish lacked any seasoning improved only tabasco sauce    The concept menu honey salt great but execution severely lacking  <EOR> Decent  bad good   Pricey little options menu cute joint though   Service definitely par  <EOR> My boyfriend decided try place Sunday dinner  give them A+  ambiance presentation food  However food felt lacking some flavor  short rib boyfriend ordered chicken breast  also ordered guacamole chips which very tasty happy hour menu  try restaurant again lunch since heard good things lunch menu  <EOR> What nice furniture sto    oh wait restaurant   There 2 surprising things place 1 very spacious definitely expected smaller 2 Everything absolutely worth money   I absolutely loved everything place decorations atmosphere course food   I came knowing just wanted salad  sat down looked menu decided anniversary special! $20 appetizer main course dessert  also added nice little grass juice beginning    Squash soup little thick good taste flavorful but still liked it  scared finish because wanted able try everything   Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich winner winner chicken dinner! When line created pretty sure sandwich mind  first thought sandwich would little much but wasn't overly fried didn't feel would die heart attack  salad came addicting put kale  nice balance fat sandwich   Brown bag apple pie presentation adorable  wasn't super impressed dessert but solid 7  really liked crust vanilla bean ice cream nice touch   I don't use word favorite often but restaurant definitely top 10! <EOR> Enjoyed experience  Good very good including modifications few offerings meet vegan requirements  Service attentive guests enjoyed nice evening  Wine list impressive ranging affordable high quality offerings would expected  <EOR> Great place worth trip off strip! $18 bottomless mimosas generous but won't fill cup until empty  Made friends birthday brunch super special! Erin super awesome! also awesome salt scrub rinse your hands with    Three chicken sandwich which apparently delicious  nachos share breakfast pizza Caesar salad  salad dry though but Erin recommended steak salad which dinner menu    Lovely spot  sure vegan options but really great vegetarian options if eat eggs  quinoa bowl  I comment veg options but don't factor into rating  Would come back anytime! <EOR> My friends wanted just bit something before dinner because early lunch decided try place  ordered side Mac cheese two Cesar salads  Food really good but $9 Mac cheese expecting bigger portion  Salads also very small thank God very hungry! told change menus maybe next time try something different change review  Service bad although very busy could faster  did love decoration vintage style restaurant  would try again  <EOR> This place trying hard  food bland noisy crowded everyone running around no smiling  people nice enough everything's fresh but there's nothing outstanding restaurant  high hopes heard good things  bad we're starting 1st wedding anniversary celebration disappointment  Sorry say traveling across town come again  <EOR> More 4 5 star  great location drive often  Decided stop nice birthday lunch date before running errands  Really clean welcoming upon entry  seated right away booth along wall  wide variety drinks offered back try few less scheduled day  lunch menu moderate variety but dishes seem thought just every day kind items  server cheerful friendly  Ordered corn soup eggplant dip start grain power salad mushroom pizza  Complimentary savory crisp basket while waited  Dishes rolled quickly  corn soup best described Autumn bowl  Perfectly seasoned smooth  eggplant dip delish  Acidic twist garnished spicy fried chickpeas pita  ratio pita dip off but crisp leftover prior   Pizza satisfying cheesy def better ketchup mess down street last week  another plus  grain salad very filling lots fresh avocado  touch mandarin delightful  Overall ambience relaxing fresh  decor rusticly chic is thing? yet modern  food interesting yummy  coming back drinks dinner menu soon  <EOR> The food solid pork chops scallops flavorful but over bearing cooked perfection  full simple flavor protein  But overall service amazing!

But quite confused could stand some editing  pretty large restaurant going renovations even more space   The rest food good nothing stood particularly but nothing terrible either  Those Parmesan crisps though???? dream them  <EOR> I finally chance try brunch  usually Honey Salt weekday lunch dinners    First all service impeccable here  wait staff know they're doing  They're friendly informative always checking see if everything great   Second food tasty perfectly seasoned right portions  Although times wish less wouldn't eat all   I'm sure if Yelp saves all past reviews won't into other meals had  brunch friend chicken salad Elizabeth's Caesar side salmon  love salmon here  Just few doors down Honey Salt salad salmon difference price but quality flavor much better money Honey Salt    The fruit platter more bowl  There's enough fruit 2 3 people if you're making fruit your main meal  loved pieces mint it  tried monkey bread well  more cluster rolls caramel sauce  fun think if few people share   Honey Salt knows desserts  chocolate Society cake amazing  banana interesting twist  first more hesitant banana but now really it  meal brownies brookie scoop ice cream  brookie killer dessert little bit everything you're craving dessert  Seriously would Honey Salt just desserts    Finally comparison other restaurants cost quite reasonable    I'm going back lunch again week  think probably once week something  <EOR> I realize 7pm reservation Saturday evening doesn't promise seated 7pm but didn't seated until 7 30 people came we time same number party seated first  obvious some regulars   Once seated sending back glasses clean glasses everything fine  Good service food excellent  table filet ordered medium overcooked but great flavor pork chop pizza risotto  sides brussels sprouts cauliflower great  Desert very good well bread pudding    definitely back but hope reservation means more timely commitment staff seated  If wait no apologies wait dirty glasses would easily rated 4 stars  <EOR> This place absolutely perfect!!!

When sat down waiter asked if wanted order didn't even opportunity look menu! asked give minute! He came back but weren't ready! Apparently if don't order your second time he's done because he nowhere found long time asked but bustboy said he would talks order  He wasn't familiar cocktails  ordered Moscow mule while friend question regarding  vodka  waiter took long time com over but he asked bartender took long time well!  salad dry asked extra dressing croutons only 2 them! counted them! When he brought it    He forgot spoon! plenty restaurants eat coming back! expensive lunch overrated! paying food service ! ambiance! ambiance nice but  it!!! Paid outta here!! <EOR> So technically 3 5 star review  If describe Honey Salt word would solid  competent  Very solid food but nothing great memorable  price want something memorable  decor great! Very homey cool  service good if bit rushed    We started New England fry which very good if bit small 15 bucks  greasy fry sauce delicious    I also fried chicken sandwich which solid but great  Slaw good chicken good mustard sauce ok  But side homemade potato chips pretty lackluster underseasoned bit letdown  Pretty much any side fries great potato salad etc  would've better   I finished strawberry shortcake dessert  OK  sweet but almost sweet enough  honestly could've used compote some other sweet element  Again fine but something I'd order again   Altogether good serviceable meal but price point should great  <EOR> It's nice place brunch long day shopping  Don't expect large portions price menu items  lobster lettuce wraps pretty darn good  <EOR> My family loves place!  really isn't anything bad   decor music service course food all great   ate Mother's Day   grandkids picky eaters loved it   Some items loved pizza scallops seabass filet   dessert big hit too   grandkids especially liked making own sundaes   Great job!! <EOR> Poetic grilled peaches ricotta balsamic reduction drizzle arugula greens  Enjoy freshness place its uncompromising approach service  Live long prosper ! <EOR> Love place!  cute farmhouse decor delicious food everything restaurant fabulous!

Would return next time visit Vegas if means again  <EOR> Oh hype!  wanted Honey Salt really did   Don't wrong serve bad food   just serve flavors catered palates hardly ventures perimeter Summerlin    Upon arrival found outdoor dining area directly outside entrance restaurant   picket fenced area hung christmas lights overhead but still seemed odd fifty feet away Talbots a women's clothing store    give them credit trying though    Upon walking bar sits left dining area sits right open kitchen toward back dining area   decoration relaxed chic California style Hampton twist   very much tastefully done but much feels pretentious which seems Summerlin all unfortunately  Tivoli Village anyone? We waited bar entire party bartender very nice   tried Garden Mule tasted mojito me   huge basil leaf drink am sure if basil washed properly but drink pesticide taste it  Know talking about?  may crazy too    took basil over time tasted better     sure if removal leaf finishing drink     The staff bar very nice offered water all things good bar offers   No problems there    Upon being seated table greeted Casey right away   explained menu Casey extremely helpful wine selection night   Nobilo Icon Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2012 price $43 bottle    Now getting down business    The bread basket good   Nothing write home but must warn good butter is   Beware because want eat butter spoon  Getting Comfortable that's named appetizers We England Fry octopus   octopus good but spectacular and price    good enough share between two persons   England Fry nothing special all mean nothing   better shishito peppers home     find much better calamari fried clams elsewhere!    Everyone talked raved scallops scallops   $31 six scallops which more usually other places handful cauliflowers   scallops cooked right over under cooked but once again uneventful palate other overpowering truffle sauce   If truffle then may find dish fulfilling   But personally seafood hint truffle truffle should be      The bf sea bass soon dish arrives table knew going good   looked dried overcooked tasted it   all impressed sea bass all   would recommend unless dried fish like    One friends duck confit salad looked boring which personally think hard duck confit salad look boring   duck confit!  digress      Our other friend husband friend duck confit curry   did seem he ecstatic curry   wife actually literally said tasted dirt  reflect accurately she did say she does Indian curry     All all Honey Salt terrible?

However ask wine menu 3 times until me    twenty minutes later    It took while but bread basket finally made table  moderately impressive variety breads served seasoned white bean puree  excellent crispy flat bread but didn't mesh potato rolls  But hey! enjoyed healthy alternative thousand calorie butter   As appetizer started beef tartare $14   HS's interpretation sweeter variety  take filet mignon mix egg yolk pickled papaya capers thick soy sauce  really taste flavors papaya pull through  usually prefer savory beef tartare but still pretty good   I'm going excuse lack timeliness short period time they've operation  server friendly person but he rarely came check failed let know food going take age and a half table  ordered sea scallops $28 myself  observed restaurant operation fail weren't expecting any food cooked very well  But surprisingly dish cooked perfectly! scallops served alongside charred cauliflower atop bed vanilla bean cauliflower puree  WARNING If don't truffles sure tell server! dish served heavy mean heavy serving truffle butter  friend really sensitive truffles  But while he loves scallops truffles ruined  they everywhere! other hand love truffles thought amazing  Unfortunately dish finished sprinkle rock salt  But only did put much rock salt didn't dissolve fully little sodium heavy  *crunch*  My friend doesn't eat red meat he chicken $22   Generally speaking restaurants hard time impressing chicken  Chicken so    lack luster  But whatever they're doing chicken better keep doing it  skin flavorful crisp while inside moist juicy  anaheim pepper mac n' cheese pretty good served some sauteed kale  better chickens wasn't even strip!  Other scruffy service sodium overload love everything restaurant  feel diners food decor all work together create luxurious but comfortable eating experience  feel high brow while still being down to earth  if  possible  sure take month two bearings but high hopes Honey Salt! <EOR> Super stoked made reservation reading all great reviews however expectations exactly met     Decor lovvved it    hommie    warm    comfy  Service really slow beginning   busboy very good bringing water bread however waited fifteen minutes still no server ask busboy one   All servers restaurant seemed super rushed yet none rushing help table   Finally when server did come he seemed rushed mentioned he just helping actual server section   don't think actual server came until end   way all servers pretty scarce most meal   The beer list wasn't anything special settled cocktail Salty Sun Gun   Nice interesting bourbon based cocktail however normally stronger fuller taste   More potent maybe?  Charcuterie Pizza spicier imagined   Interesting taste though New England Fry   your typical calamari dish   definite kick   Oh lemon aioli uhhhmayyzinggg     taking bread even pizza crust drenching aioli     But dessert  took cake literally   ordered Triple Layer Cake thinking would sweet but subtle   finest sense   All flavors mixed together well together     Final thought Very Unexpected  <EOR> There few things give five stars  main reason being some best pan seared scallops anywhere    This family owned business definitely tell use fresh ingredients  Always plus   I heard lot hype place but usually keen new hip place  hate going newer restaurants when they're busy just crowed people  course  want lot people tell places just because they're new cool because food  kind nervous especially because food cheaper side    For dinner New England Fry Clams Calamari  Caramelized Sea Scallops Grass fed Filet Mignon  Side well known Kale Anaheim pepper Mac Cheese  I tell disappointed ANY dishes  clams calamari cooked perfectly weren't rubber find lot places around town   The Scallops where amazing  vanilla bean cauliflower puree true sauce really made dish absolutely delightful   The mignon cooked perfectly asked very distinguished taste   And favorite Mac Cheese  Never kale mac cheese but goodness   it quite charming surprise! nice spicy cheese sauce peppers nice creamy  Perfect combination!  They really nice homey feeling restaurant  Very creative decor good service  booked if when busy expect bit delay  DEFINITELY reservation before going dinner  also large variety specialty drinks!   I've heard amazing things chicken sandwich   I'm just big things dinner  means going back lunch soon  <EOR> Good service but did enjoy food  steak eggs steak tasty ricotta pancakes which edible but bland   Cute ambiance  Based other 1000 reviews seems may come off day  Nevertheless unlikely try place again   there's way better food Vegas  <EOR> I've once before lunch bad  decide try dinner  service very very poor  flag down waiter several times we didn't drinks until appetizers almost done? place busy Friday night? Pretty limited menu looks place survival mode If  case probably trouble  Food average best  Quality worthy price  won't going back      <EOR> This great relief noisy strip  bit cab ride but well worth opinion if you're beginning feel Vegas'd overpriced underwhelming steak meals   The decor very cool relaxing peaceful  Light green couches beige accented lamps chairs light brown brick wall warm chandeliers put ease visually  soft indie jazz combo music sets great tone experiential cadence subtle rhythmic    We found entire staff extremely friendly knowledgeable  seems great familial friendly culture between staff which explains experience vibes   For food ordered power grain chicken salad quinoa radish cranberries lentils ahi tuna salad sea peas Asian pear spinach  Chicken moist tender meat crispy grill exterior  would describe best salad meal ever had  concluded sea salt caramel ice cream absolutely heavenly some lattes   We ended camping entire afternoon over 5 hours  likely visiting place again dinner  <EOR> We came wife's Bday felt overall good alternative high quality food away strip  server friendly knowledgeable bus boys did good job removing plates refilling water  dinner ordered grilled octopus pork chop sea bass macaroni  enjoyed everything though wish pork chop more seasoning  dessert tried Nutella banana bread pudding sea salt caramel ice cream  ice cream amazing cannot missed! Overall enjoyed dinner plan return fall  <EOR> Probably would hit 3 star value service   4 star food   Can't half stars gotta majority here   Came brunch group friends   Service ok drinks sat empty bit multiple times time between apps entrees quite extensive   Also waiting bill took quite while some reason   figured wanted outta there!  Prices also somewhat high especially brunch menu   chicken sandwich burgers $13 fish apps ordered both around $15   ordered some mac cheese off secret kids menu $8    just mac cheese   don't mind spending good money food could tell quality ingredients but when sit back think solid bang your buck    On food!

Nah tobacco field table    Apparently brunch where but coming back dinner lunch being totally question would hard sale me  <EOR> This place nice modern but homey feel it  Vegas conference just wanted try something different  brother very pleased food  He opted meatloaf which wonderful I bite scallops  wish portion more but overall great dish  weren't super impressed Mac cheese It some kind tangy flavor just didn't sit right although disclaimer south certain expectation comes comfort food that  service nice which says lot busy weekend  cold try he patio seating but inside well decorated comfortable  would definitely try again  <EOR> Never disappointment  gone dinner several times tried something different each time all which great   Brunch awesome too! <EOR> My friend wanting awhile now Saturday made very long trip SE side town try it  arrived around 4 45 walked looked upon turned manager petite dark haired female say looked upon because she didn't smile and or greet friendly manner all she looked annoyed asked if she could help us  ??

Some may call ironic say tacky! aforementioned beet salad? few pieces beet little arugula dollop ricotta   $14! although chicken very good medium sized chicken breast doesn't warrant price over $20  before Summerlin crowd starts chanting back Denny's talking value price  last two steakhouse meals Silverado Circus Circus each $30 less comparable meal  So all all good great worth price  <EOR> Great food horrible service   Rarely saw server literally wait dessert little over 30 minutes  waiting check took even longer 45 minutes  joke  <EOR> My actual experience more 3 5 but rounding up     First good Despite being strip mall restaurant successfully turned interior into nice dining space even comfortable looking outdoor seating those times cool enough sit outside   The waitstaff great friendly professional when needed them gone when didn't   group ten when arrived set long table smaller section restaurant which gave more privacy   Food portions reasonable menu well rounded   only drawback food itself   Nothing bad but nothing great prices you'd expect something better   I started wood oven baked prawns which asked come side dinner since no else having appetizer   came ahead meal despite request fine but spectacular   Fifteen dollars four prawns   prawns themselves incredibly fresh tasting however picked almost none flavor seasonings   ended using sauce dip bread just could taste it   The roasted cauliflower described good fact member party change mind cauliflower mac cheese tasty long didn't bite piece pepper spicy    The bread oh god bread   may best part meal   server brought plenty fresh made rolls baked together little stars Parmesan flavored crisp flat bread all served light whipped butter black sea salt   When quickly ate way through first batch server happy bring more     For main course caramelized sea scallops $31 five scallops    scallops nicely darkened outside just slightly overcooked inside but point where affected flavor texture   deliciously sweet large enough decent main course   came charred cauliflower poorly seasoned but better when dipped leftover sauce appetizer vanilla bean cauliflower puree delicious but overpowering scallops sure supposed eaten truffle sauce mmm mmm good    The desert offerings looked delicious but chose tea instead   friends chocolate ice cream strawberry shortcake both described them good but great    Overall restaurant nice atmosphere great staff good ingredients   Now just need chef live rest  <EOR> Great food service  Dominique best very personable!! truffle grilled cheese good <EOR> A friend mine suggested going Honey Salt when didn't even know was   Being last minute plans no reservations made which highly suggest right now supper busy when arrived    Thankfully two people just leaving bar hostess snagged two seats us     The restaurant very open well lit floor plan   basically large rectangle     The page menu great   Very concise but still many options   didn't terrible large amount time dine decided skip appetizer round   friend ordered free range brick oven chicken   chicken good   wasn't dry but basically rotisserie chicken   made dish however kale Anaheim pepper mac n' cheese   delicious!  would definitely recommend getting mac n' cheese even itself   ordered charcuterie pizza   dough very good   Thin crispy just way liked it   only comment pizza being charcuterie name could used more cured meats   would minded paying extra $2 more meat   description also said fennel salad pizza which did see believe tasted anything fennel pizza night   think would great addition salad pizza came oven perhaps slice two cured meat top if salad   The service bar wonderful   Very attentive even drink orders restaurant kept spilling in   would definitely recommend place friends would definitely return reservation dine again try other items menu  <EOR> First night yearly March Madness trip Las Vegas nice dinner       tonight's GREAT   Started cocktail bar       Midnight Stranger        unbelievable       already bourbon fan but took another level   For appetizer decided Grilled Octopus       octopus grilled perfectly       but sauce really brought flavor unbelievable   For entrée selected Sea Bass side brussel sprouts       cooked perfection again layering flavors sauce made great   I loved atmosphere staff       place definitely must try again list       <EOR> I ate place around time opened although can't remember exactly ate remember bread pudding bringing cloud nine!

We didn't order any desserts   Just heads find ice cream across street Whole Foods! find pint fraction cost! <EOR> Not bad spot but tries California chic  Food isnt bad but overpriced  <EOR> This place doesn't really deserve 1 star but needed balance inflated scores other people giving  incredibly hyped people can't tell difference between great food average food compelled give 5 stars based ambience reputation alone    Yes atmosphere farm chic but also brings air snobby when you're close Summerlin  justifies them serving extremely overpriced dishes average best  Don't wrong  I'm willing spend money quality food  paid $1800 sushi meal two before felt worth every dollar but whole experience left sour taste mouth  <EOR> First time dinner  server amazing food perfect  Everything down latte dessert  love decor plaid use ingredients close home your food super fresh    I've since back twice lunch limbo you're late lunch but early dinner menu   Food great  never bad dining experience regard  Fresh whole wheat pizza perfectly cooked turkey meat balls  all delicious  But     The service getting progressively worse  servers past couple times bad  Really rude  Even hostess rude  Yeah frowny face should never used greet people   ever    You'll find even though place fully staffed your server struggling 4 table section 4 tops  hipster plaid wearing man server never around when he he conversing bar completely oblivious    In such competitive restaurant market industry folks find hard believe place wouldn't better service  Maybe lunch staff comprised minor leaguers dinner major league  Might just steer clear lunch hour crew until together   *dinner Mac n cheese amazing grilled chicken die for  Don't forget brown bag apple pie    *lunch fried chicken sandwich turkey meatballs veggie whole wheat pizza  Delicious  two fresh juices off salad menu really good too  Lemonade fresh little sad inside but  just minor faux pas   Five stars food  <EOR> I really wanted place truly did  Aunt foodie around world scouting places she likes when any family visiting living city town country even she scouts places like    My Aunt told year ago restaurant known best grilled cheese perhaps true menu kids just grilled cheese bacon adult menu    I spending nice day kids leaving two weeks summer Primm guilty pleasure Powerball then Outlet Mall them some more clothes summer  tried day roasting which why leave decided take them Honey Salt did want eat Primm    It half hour north where live arrived very upscale shopping area looked really promising  very excited son poor eater prayed he'd eat grilled cheese but alas only grilled cheese bacon which he would eaten but am sure would made just cheese however he wanted French Toast which big enough kids share  probably amazing he very picky gobbled good eater daughter did really touch hers    The atmosphere trendy upscale restaurant pretty loud soon walked did feel really going kid friendly  entered woman child told careful glass behind prelude finale   seated very corner near kitchen very nice friendly waitress other staff came over several times tend service excellent     So meat literally figuratively review own meal  Steak Eggs substituted potatoes Ceasar Salad  salad very good albeit quite small food pretty unappetising  say because cold  steak cold eggs cold very hard rubbery  did want send back warm enough eat just ate it    I reiterate staff generally well all really quite nice very attentive  Unfortunately end meal 2 year old daughter running booth trying pay broke glass  Anyone two year old children knows very hard control them 2 years old  also saw no need them chunky water glasses every table obviously case when entered child first break glass  She broke glass both woman believe manager as friend mind knows owner Elizabeth said she Vancouver right now well really nice staff member cleaning apologised came rushing over    The woman did speak profusely apologised though man cleaning very nice said Don't worry   woman seemed very annoyed tried bill settled soon possible trying keep son glass when daughter jumped fell off booth  gentleman picked she crying hold while signed quickly possible able just leave    I totally understand unfortunate kids break things some ways parental responsibility but review even based nor way woman came over seemed utterly annoyed atmosphere meal  Just trendy L A  way where quasi cafe restaurant lots people socialising talking very loud waitstaff super busy yet very attentive food really worth it  truly hate giving anything but stellar reviews but sometimes just honest  felt horrible but did need made feel worse woman came over table actually stressed trying hard kids fast enough  <EOR> My friend local recommended Honey Salt Burrata Heirloom Tomato salad shaved bittersweet chocolate add on  artfully plated salad comes figs basil balsamic vinegar extra virgin olive oil  truly creative take classic Caprese salad brings your taste buds flavor packed symphony sweet savory tastes low acidity plenty umami  also tried Backyard Favorite Burger which comes beehive cheddar tomato jam butter pickle side french fries  Ketchup comes mini squeeze bottle ours low side  It would nice if topped off each bottle before sending out  $14 medium rare burger very disappointing 2 Yelp stars terms flavor juiciness especially amazing 5 Yelp stars Burrata tomato chocolate salad  Absolutely nothing stood beef patty bun accompaniments  Next time TWO Burrata Heirloom Tomato salads!!!!!
