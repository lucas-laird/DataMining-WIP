Once while Pho   pretty good considering place mostly Korean   try sushi rolls too   They're fabulous but bind   They accept Total Rewards  <EOR> Asian food pretty pricey but  along strip  won't able find cheap Asian food unless Chinatown not far drive   Salmon Bento Box $16 99 worth comes 4 pieces California rolls tempura rice salad but everything tasted mediocre  Tofu Soup w Seafood $12 99 bowl comes small bowl rice  delicious over rice even though ordered mild  shared 3 other people which came small bowl each us  Bibimbap w Kalbi Oh delicious! $15 99 little bit pricey side but vegas  kalbi cut into little squares which made perfect eat rice  Potato Noodle would skip this  kept choking noodles cause slides down throat very chewy  also barely any taste  Exotic Bomba dessert All desserts weren't even asian! but looked cool dessert menu 3 diff  flavored sorbets covered white chocolate  good but worth $8  also don't price dessert menu may want ask price before order   I didn't bother ordering any Chinese dishes wayyy overpriced Chinese food  also assumed sushi wouldn't all great there's no visible sushi chef  also think if they're going charge everyone 18% gratuity should least state menu  <EOR> If order anything other Korean food you'll greatly disappointed  don't understand why try specialize different cuisines also offer Vietnamese Japanese menu  pho good all broth bland  Btw server pronouces pho paw   Yes friends completely thrown off whenever she said paw   Learn pronounce right if you're trying sell your customers! eggrolls also very good tasted taken freezer heated up  sushi? didn't taste fresh also probably just taken fridge transferred onto platter before being served us  thing did enjoy Korean spicy seafood soup  pretty good portion spicy   Aside most food serve major thing stinks place service  switched two pho dishes or shall say paw gave cousin wrong pho bowl  gave just steak when she ordered steak brisket flank  She told servers wanted charge extra $4 add extra meat bowl! Unbelievable! obviously did know handle problem very well   I guess good thing place open 24 hours if want crappy food middle night feel over paying then place go! <EOR> Located inside Imperial Palace casino  dinning room casual very nicely put together pretty good atmoshphere  little annoyed when reservations said wouldn't need them worry but when arrived pretty empty  course asked booth which told the booth section currently closed   decided just accept table given since already planning see show way empty  wide array choices interesting yet somewhat pricey  ordered orange chicken which great but portion wasn't exactly worth price  also ordered crunch roll which actually some best sushi awhile  soda tea ordered priced $3 each soda coming regular glass ice side free refills but still $3!!!   All all food great ambience okay service could use little work pricing reasonable  back IF im Imperial Palace but can't say way eat again  <EOR> Did eat same restaurant all other Yelpers ranting place?  Confused   I actually enjoyed two dinners here  service good the owner took care both times while price pretty high I think because Vegas vegetables hard come desert    food flavorful well made  am highly critical Korean food always end comparing every Korean restaurant mother's cooking obviously admitting food good means well above mediocre    While dishes think taste better mom's kitchen other restaurants i e  spicy tuna roll HEAVEN Kimchi pancake pa jun   Delicious  Definitely BEST kimchi pa jun ever entire life better mom's! stilling thinking silently crying can't just eat whenever want  lemme tell mountains mountains pa juns life because favorites  yet taste good Ginseng3's! <EOR> Meh  Overpriced but typical vegas  Service somewhat slow being busy  Pho so so  But no mint! Wtf?! spring rolls didn't mint wait expecting  $20 pho impressed!!!! Never agaib <EOR> Came late snack 4pm  dumplings cold lot MSG  lettuce cups marginal  Staff barely courteous  <EOR> Went dinner 8 more others ordered 10 different dishes  But when then cheque came    extra charge    Charged 11 dishes    Be careful when eating there  Checked boss she even counted dishes confirmed bill still correct     But insisted wrong she then accepted it       The receipt properly written very vague     Be careful!!!!  Food good kimchi stew sour waited pho 45 mins come out  <EOR> I saw poster wall near escalator noticed SoonTofu Tofu Soup menu  SoonTofu those foods whether really hungry finish off leave satisfyingly filled    The restaurant itself offers Korean Japanese Chinese entrees but I'd say emphasis Korean food    I Tofu Soup brother assorted tempura appetizer split sushi some special name shrimp crab avocado    The tempura your average fare no better worse would typical restaurant  sushi very good which due course rice being correct which leads believe other types sushi offered would also very good    I kind wary Tofu Soup because picture chili pepper next but wasn't spicy  flavor pretty good but ordered beef found beef really tough took away enjoyment soup maybe next time order seafood  also pretty fond dropping raw egg into piping hot soup didn't experience either    The prices little higher would off strip even Los Angeles but expected  All all satisfying enjoyable experience <EOR> Came because friend suggested coming here  She said dish black bean noodle but course sold out  Instead chicken katsu  crispy but thin stripped  other people came alright experience would more worth if less $10 plate  <EOR> It okay  only came because only restaurant within Imperial Palace Hotel still open past midnight   ordered $10 99 udon only okay  soup base good though   husband combo fried rice wasn't good  meat dry!  All could think better fried rice that!  added peas cube cut carrots fried rice think rice look could come Panda Express! Thus ordering any fried rice paying more expensive version fried rice cheap quality  don't recommend fried rice  <EOR> My expectations super low when arrived many terrible meals various ip restaurants over years tea house buffet burger palace pretty much just hoping something edible    The restaurant Korean Japanese Chinese but seemed focus waiters perhaps cooks Korean     My wife split spicy delicious beef soup   waiter excellent he gave extra kimchi broccoli sprouts etc side dishes extra side rice for free!    Interesting see some previous experiences restaurant   suspect because strip location prob high staff turnover leading inconsistent service    The price bit higher used back home but extras gave both full satisfied only $16 total!  Anyways would definitely back another meal restaurant unlike rest hotel renovated when opened couple years ago   central location strip late night hours just good pass up   One other thing noticed seemed steady stream IP hotel guests picking orders bringing them back room   Probably better option IP room service  <EOR> This korean establishment best   menu extensive but food did live expectations   lacked flavor just terrible   sides even decent kimchi sour fish cake tasteless hard rest just nasty   Tofu soup alright but much tofu enough soup   Kabli chewy kinda bland flavorless   However kimchi pancake good but pan fried enough   service good but if want extra sides pay $2 extra    totally worth it <EOR> This probably your better bets late late night meal strip  Many 24 hour coffee shops casinos stink very long waits  Many casinos trying cut costs  example Bally's coffee shop longer 24 hours  means cafe Paris supposed serve only Paris but also Bally's they connected shopping area   Imperial Palace closed down coffee shop now late night options Ginseng 3 really overpriced Burger Palace  Ginseng 3 bit off beaten path usually isn't much wait  think 2 3 escalators it  wouldn't even know if hadn't seen advertisement monorail station I'm sure marketing guys glad know sign worked    Ginseng 3 pretty much standard 24 hour tofu houses finds K towns all over  throw some other stuff Chinese food sushi menu if want some late night Korean BBQ bring small grill your table  prices really high though but expected given its location  think paid $17 soft tofu meal which $7 more costs Southern California  Still I'd take over $12 burger fries Burger Palace any day  server did ask wanted tofu ended being spicier like    I think liked place more should because good moods being Las Vegas few drinks starving felt lucky finally find place could seated right away everywhere else least 1 hour wait   definitely place when no other choice  food isn't bad  pretty good actually but prices bring down rating score  <EOR> So hash house busy made mistake coming here  Alaskan roll tiny sliver salmon avocado top  inside straight filled cucumber nothing else  server even brought menu show only cucumber  13 bucks down drain   Horrible  <EOR> Wanted savory breakfast before flying back CES big fan various Asian dishes especially wanted Pho   plus side nice     however  It bit expensive The Pho outside fresh bean sprouts insipid bland soup base chicken just barely moister then jerky   Seriously never chicken tough chewy   didn't taste bad but     ugh      Did only eat dish woman across room seemed enjoying fried rice      but meal good   Avoid  <EOR> My boyfriend we're both Korean craving Korean food came Ginseng 3 upstairs Imperial Palace now 'Quad Resort'   huge mistake  Surprisingly no complaint food  made pretty offended telling 18% tip automatically put checks when obviously SAW putting tip table before left  First all when brought check handed them credit card right away when came back just gave credit card transaction receipt didn't realize tip added there  next day again Korean food same watresses remembering day before  When recieved check then finally realized 18% tip automatically added on  When found told waitress a Korean lady probably around 40s leaving extra tip day before  She didn't even feel bad any way told should've looked receipt before paying  very bad experience Korean place actually thought pretty nice  going again experience  <EOR> Ginseng seems hidden gem probably because still fairly new location doesn't much foot traffic few escalators Imperial Palace    place wasn't very crowded around dinnertime which bad first sign   However ethnic composition clientele pretty heavily Asian which good second sign   They did disappoint   Korean dishes A++ but pretty authentic good quality   12 bucks little more want pay soon tofu but hey Vegas   Plus still free kimchee assorted appetizers   also some Chinese Japanese dishes looked reasonably authentic   And everyone before mentioned open 24 7 ftw! <EOR> The only reason stepped foot IMPERIAL PALACE HASH HOUSE GO! 11 04 pm SUNDAY  CLOSED 11pm LAST NIGHT! missed 5 MINUTES!!!!!!

Even Hash House can't place when comes IP restaurants we ate once staff totally apathetic service life support   <EOR> being korean learned cannot few days without eating korean food really don't know why but something within days  realized ginseng 3 opened 6 months ago mom decided new years eve  mandu duk guk dumpling rice cake soup because tradition eat new years long life good luck   idk something that good!!! only giving 4 because haven't anything else but definitely update next time back <EOR> We ordered spicy pork which sweet tough very greasy   fried dumplings regrettable although complete failure spicy pork   I asked server if she gave actually spicy pork since didn't even hint spiciness   She said degree spiciness depends chef working day   Meh <EOR> Came 5 am morning trying avoid hangover craving pho  Located now called Quad formally Imperial Palace restaurant claims japanese chinese korean vietnamese dishes  Although pho very much border lined mediocre upside place open 24 hours  would firmly recommend really your eye place if plan come vegas but if REALLY want asian style food very late time then maybe would OK option  other thing Ginseng pretty expensive is  Prepare ears drowned sound asian pop music  If your thing then your luck but opinion i'd rather eat something fast poppy tempo    Nice waitress though fairly clean space  <EOR> Considering place practically only Korean Vietnamese restaurant walking distance within strip EVERY DAMN RIGHT expensive     All other casino restaurants doing why them?  Hell room service costs more Caesar's Palace because once ordered salad chicken soup came $60 mention noodle soups Beijing Noodle No  9 priced $16 barely any noodles flavor  pho being $11 $12 actually reasonable   You're saving gas time leaving strip hassle parking possibly more waiting when there   I've couple times once Korean food another time pho   food isn't best ever but Vegas   can't expect everything taste good since every damn place strip over hyped except EOS    Quite frankly don't remember ordered back then but if returning visitor food probably decent   Anyway ordered 2 bowls pho tai   Pho comes big ass bowl piping hot   definitely tastes pho but cleaner healthier   Especially herbal taste broth   wanted more sprouts flagged guy down he SUPER nice gave more   He even told let know if wanted anything else     Anyway SERVICE A+ restaurant super CLEAN nice quiet   People dine actually manners   couple times dined never problem   Oh those think Koreans special service Korean didn't even speak Korean attention service  <EOR> So trying find sushi place walk Imperial Palace Casino cause see sign place   Right away wasnt feeling but group desperate hungry   *sigh*    After asking where place 4th 5th floor   place nearly deserted   Only 2 people you'd think gettin ready close     After getting seated order some sodas   ask Diet Pepsi which bring glass ice Diet Pepsi   $3 FRIGGING Dollars   kidding me?  nearly 12 pack much   rip off     After going through menu realizing real sushi place all decide eat there  buddy's girlfriend orders some soup which guess good    two stars   throw down $10 there     Bleh    <EOR> If you're shitfaced drunk place cool! Don't come looking Ming Tsai tho! noticed whole staff Korean stuck part menu your best bet  did order pho actually worse where live   California but pretty average didn't chili sauce wtf? Nice staff think 24 hours? Probably only reason besides being whacked outta damn mind  Ahhhh Vegas <EOR> If reading probably drunk just lost lot money blackjack table 3 00 am   Weird thing asked two different people casino if noodle restaurant casino neither them knew place   upstairs around corner which enough description realize hard find   The food nothing special   just enough keep being hungover tomorrow   Japanese Korean Vietnamese Chinese food    but both know when such wide range different foods no way all them well   Open 24 hours come anytime   When only other table customers very quiet there   Really quiet  <EOR> I low expectations   live San Francisco Bay Area live around lots fresh cheap sushi places   Okay being said place just okay begin but getting food poisoning going say okay   My boyfriend Valentine's Day no wait 10pm servers friendly enough   We ordered tempura California roll Tiger roll which came $50  little pricey since home could same thing $20 nice sushi place but cheaper other Vegas Strip Sushi joints  also include 18% tip your bill no matter your party size    The food average  fish smelled okay but doubt fresh but use fake crab fill everything roll bigger  example tiger roll suppose avocado shrimp inside tuna avocado top   came tiny shrimp small bit avocado inside surrounded fake crab fill  tuna also sliced tuna but flaked tuna marinated mushed back together top   lot better   The tempura okay but thought odd see onion rings included   Usually don't receive onions tempura   only okay greasy but dipping sauce wasn't good other places too    I disappointed brought bill without asking if would dessert   left without trying Exotic Bomba which looked pretty yummy   glad didn't add sorbet top all though because boyfriend food poisoning eating hadn't anything else all day    Since sick eating won't back  <EOR> Horrible service over priced  Food wasn't great also  Below average price  spicy tuna roll tiny rolls BBQ beef pricy! spicy shrimp so so egg rolls ok Just avoid place  <EOR> Went past week because friend stayed Flamingo  met other friends worked Quad  craving sushi wanted some used discount  sushi here? best  very plain bland worth price  Alaska Roll Cucumber roll topped Salmon   it  $12 99?

I ordered hot stone bibimbap kalbi beef which $17  Yes paid around $17 worst bibimbap ever had  Seriously came kinda tacky weird chip top no idea day  All know chip super salty only bowl  mention banchan non existent  fact only side dish kimchi it  bibimbap itself way greasy kalbi tasted ground hamburger which probably was  Anyways easily most flavorless bibimbap ever  you'd think I'd least enjoy drunken state   If you're particular your Asian food don't come here  fair though only Korean food  didn't try other stuff   Either way its ridiculous prices mediocre service back  know Vegas expensive but $17 bowl bibimbap no flavor no banchan just way much ask for  <EOR> It bit hard find hidden gem inside Quad hotel all constructions going around  But once find you'll love it! tried spicy jumbo shrimp sliced short ribs  delicious  both come white rice  place open 24hours! Even better!!! D <EOR> This definitely case where wide array Yelp reviews averages pretty realistic representation experience expect  course when you're wandering through Asian themed Imperial Palace completely reasonable start craving Asian food  pho naeng myun gyoza orange chicken soon dubu    place more less all encompassing menu late night Asian and pseudo Asian comfort food   I really tempted japchae one favorite noodle dishes! but then spotted bibim naeng myun spicy cold noodles just it  long since last bowl cold chewy buckwheat noodles drenched gochujang based sauce topped Asian pear beef boiled egg  bibim naeng myun fiery red but very spicy  ask more gochujang  helped  Pretty overpriced $12+ but bad   M really craving pho he ordered pho tai Vietnamese beef noodle soup sliced beef   broth okay pretty comparable Korean owned pho places LA  Nothing dollop hoisin sauce squeeze lime couldn't improve   The dining area reminiscent BCD Tofu House the newly remodeled off Wilshire LA staff largely Korean  Having observed I'd recommend going Korean dish extensive menu naeng myun soon dubu kimchi chigae etc    Relatively more authentic  situated off beaten path few escalators but if you're hungry late night craving Asian persuasion check place out  A OK! <EOR> As everyone else mentioned best thing place open 24 7  boyfriend came eat around 3AM since close seemingly only restaurant open time  definitely more Korean restaurant some Chinese Japanese items menu  There's even TV playing non stop Korean music videos wall   Our waitress told only items weren't available bento boxes  Which fine because craving some soup kimchi jjigae  boyfriend ordered orange chicken which came rice broccoli side  panchan came first but only 5 sides  liked soup but chicken just so so  probably best stick Korean items menu  drinks soda served can   The service good but weren't many people there  downside automatically charged 18% gratuity only two people  agree tipping policy should mentioned somewhere menu such shock!  Expect prices high here  Vegas all  But if you're really late don't want greasy fast food place worth try  <EOR> We  Imperial Palace see show thought we'd eat seeing advertisement   convenient show   Food just okay nothing brag about   better   husband ordered Kimchi stew   some flavor but nothing I'd order second time   ordered stir fried noodle chicken   needed magnifying glass find chicken    maybe four five  very small pieces smaller walnut   Flavor good noodles stir fried veggies good   Again nothing brag about   $3 tea bag hot water    a little pricey    Skip place there's burger place next floor down  <EOR> I once when Vegas family and really didn't idea eat   food okay  kimchi stew but thought somewhat disappointing   amount kimchi served almost nothing   and charged mother two dollars extra extra serving when she asked  Most korean places would serve extra free    My mother sister ordered fried rice  portions terrible thought didn't even smell good when delivered  looked something could've easily batched under 2 dollars though much higher quantities    It gets even worse when automatically add 18% gratuity when service virtually non existent  Turned 36 dollar meal 50 dollar meal gratuity taxes  Terrible  <EOR> 24 hour Asian food Vegas good price? that! ate place twice while staying Imperial Palace  Both times soup once beef Pho once beef rib stew  Both very good reasonably priced for Vegas!   only weird thing gave parsley instead basil Pho??? The customer service great received order promptly  Definitely place would recommend late night cheap eats  <EOR> I really enjoyed pho   Only complaint wasn't any basil however still really good   also ordered some Tuna Nigiri melted mouth   definitely coming back  <EOR> It ok    Nothing great  did job  3rd floor quad   24 hrs think  <EOR> I don't know happened? 2 years ago used come Ginseng 3 all time  used very charismatic Korean kid working would provide excellent customer service run whole restaurant himself  Also food always good  Korean BBQ beef always flavored perfection Chinese Korean noodle dishes better Korea Town   free appetizers always highest quality because would all variations kimchee scratch order premade    Yesterday came best friend  He flew Norway wanted some Korean food  He craving years since only Korean restaurant North Norway recently business  moment stepped everything different  server new guy extremely hands off barely came around  free appetizers no longer high quality generic kimchee prepackaged those Korean markets   BBQ beef which gone price $25 now almost flavorless tasted marinated only 10minutes cooked toaster oven  most all Korean restaurants give enough beef 3 4 people  place charges $25 gives only enough food feed person  only $9 99 AYCE Korean Beef some places tastes 100 times better this      The Sushi ordered tasted made morning refrigerated it   all already know Sushi favorite food world  didn't expect great sushi place but did expect mediocre sushi  wasn't even mediocre! tell truth never bad sushi Korean style sushi restaurant  Korean sushi chefs very creative innovative try invent new styles sauces traditional sushi which always turns really really good  whenever want great Sushi offstrip 15 miles Sushi Bomb where many chefs Korean  sushi Ginseng 3 first time disappointed while eating Sushi Korean style restaurant      Even though service bad friend still left giant tip  don't know why Europeans always leave such big tips even though service sucks?  This first me  first time ever Sushi could finish first time ever bad service Korean restaurant  Usually Korean restaurants excellent service  place    Oddly restaurant now busier ever been  Back couple years ago when service food actually good  never many customers  Very strange     I'm still give 3 stars because friend liked place  guess most  Europeans can't tell difference between bad good Korean food  <EOR>
