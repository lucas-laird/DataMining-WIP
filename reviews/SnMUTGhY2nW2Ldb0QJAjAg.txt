Customer beware check your statement <EOR> From reading everyone review thing could wrong  But trying over price buffet would give zero if yelp would allow me   For starter under staff Sunday night  food selections EXTREMELY small portion  Which does meet qualification ALL EAT  kept running foods  back three times before any crab leggs  ran spoon soup  back ask spoons  dim sum section nothing but empt bamboo container  No dim sum  see everyone else fried noodles sushi pork hash  Yet when there  There's nothing left  said back three time before want  lot option food items buffet  Indian section poor selection  Cauliflower curry?

Definitely recommend anyone Vegas come here!!  Also if stay SLS hotel some Alcoholic beverages Stella red white wine mimosas etc  complimentary  if you're staying hotel definitely come!! <EOR> This review extended because some time think really felt it    there's really lot talk about     In sea buffets Vegas few stand out    Bacchanal Caesars Wicked Spoon Cosmo now buffet SLS   The SLS buffet big other two there's much variety but some things well very well   Before into though mention just opened very long ago sure changing making tweaks every day   The buffet's variety limited mentioned before   times feels unbalanced     Ok let's Chinese section   Dim sum   Whose bright idea bring dim sum Las Vegas buffet?  Bacchanal?  don't care   love  can't enough it   Hong Kong know dim sum legit   come cute individual bamboo steamers too   love good presentation   Oh something spring rolls   They're crack   Crispy vegetable filling hits spot   sure many those ate   They XO Rolled Rice Noodles   never seen buffet before   very Cantonese dish   Rolled rice noodles woked spicy XO sauce   Delicious comforting   then there's chow mein   Ho hum   Chow mein   WAIT!  No no ordinary chow mein   Cantonese style soy sauce chow mein soy sauce king chow mein    Clearly they've Cantonese chef back there!  Hello!  eat just Chinese section buffet happy   With said some very specialized dishes there   Namely pork knuckles chicken feet   They're but know people them   But also know far more people don't    might those things sacrificed room more variety   Even XO Noodles soy sauce chow mein pretty niche opinion much love them   But complaining there's good Canto food here   Let's move away variety issue else have   Sushi well represented surprisingly fresh   Buffet tuna often little mushy   But tuna nice texture tastes great   Definitely yourself some sushi here    The meat station    tried prime rib   yet find buffet decent prime rib which why avoid if can  But nailed it   juicy tender well seasoned   pretty impressed   Unfortunately wasn't fan cold seafood station   Peel eat shrimp    overcooked having peel shrimp shells pain   having shrimp shells provides more flavor I often cook shrimp shells myself but when overcook shrimp shells won't save you   The crab legs good   par Caesars   Let's move desserts    good salted peanut butter ice cream   exactly imagined delicious   But unfortunately rest desserts disappointing   didn't try cupcakes brownies many variations them blondies    just looked dense heavy big meal  looking for   did try tiramisu pretty sad   Likewise chocolate mousse cannoli   desserts just seemed very one dimension   I would appreciated maybe chocolate dipped strawberries maybe something tart?  Lighter desserts    think benefit new pastry chef   Let's talk service   Service amazing   Top notch   Attentive friendly wait staff manager always visible   Can't ask more   So let's back obsession variety   During meal felt buffet missing station couldn't quite put finger it   think might just snack finger foods   silly sounds favorite things Wicked Spoon Bacchanal snacks   Fries sweet potato tots chips    whatever   Simple stuff right?  Overall enjoyable experience know place and better   back especially since 2 free buffets player's club! <EOR> UPDATE BUFFET TEMPORARILY CLOSED!  http vegas eater com 2014 11 10 7189237 and now for the first shutter at sls las vegas  SLS president Scott Kreeger said second floor location doing OK but hitting park compared other hotel casinos restaurants   No doubt!  any wizards even competitor's buffet see where wrong?? <EOR> The Price Food Quality same   No lot food choose   The Seafood very salting   No any fruit dinner time   <EOR> Great buffet! kind hidden you walk down lots halls around corners find  But worth search around 11am empty  Tons different foods choose highlights crab legs shrimp loved dim sum selection  favorite bloody mary bar extra $12 all delicous desserts pastries  normally prefer Mirage buffet but great if you're staying SLS  don't know if I'd venture SLS just try though  other buffets strip just good more convenient if you're staying way  <EOR> With opening newest casino Las Vegas Strip took family dinner evening give try   am happy say pleasantly surprised quality food  would rate casino buffet 8 5 10    The selection variety opinion falls under 5 categories Asian Mediterranean Seafood Italian + Prime Rib Chicken Pork  Although variety big some other casinos quality food   Everything tasted fresh clean vibrant   attempted give much food possibly could fare taste  surprised well Asian Mediterranean food prepared something usually head for     Props server Sonny!

Great personable staff which rare buffet  bunch yummy breakfast stuff boyfriend really enjoyed  also mostly Asian food lunch included sushi! only $45 two being strip well quality cherry top  back try dinner  <EOR> Went try SLS buffet tonight  buffet notch under other premium buffets strip  Cost Friday nights buffet dinner 39 99  usual split crab legs Peel eat shrimp actually pretty good  small but good selection dim sum  small selection sushi actually pretty good they selections oysters clams ribeye steak Peking chicken  Service buffet very good  also small selection Indian fair  Pastas fire oven pizzas  All all satisfied food quality  dessert bar very tasty  selections dessert bar included made order crapes very tasty gelatos  Again buffet Caesars Bellagio but fun try new different buffet  Atmosphere buffet very quiet  Making dining experience very enjoyable  seems lot locals because promotions have  <EOR> The Skinny meager selection 2 outstanding items regular $30 person brunch $40 person dinner 2 service ambience okay kind inconsistent service bad live music dinner 2 value okay if local take advantage 2 1 deal   otherwise pricey 2 FYI serve Pepsi products here   We came experience 2 1 locals buffet deal  came tail end brunch take look brunch items dinner selection   Considering bounty high end buffets Strip relatively meager offerings price first thing struck checked selection  However main question does quality it?  The hubs tried cold cuts cheese selection which decided pass  salads okay while smoked salmon selection surprisingly bland  Snow crab legs plentiful  Oysters cooked mussels offered during dinner did try  Checked Italian section which consisted 3 types pasta meh some really anemic looking pizza   Sauteed vegetables good  Zucchini cut  haphazardly large cook evenly  fan super charred cauliflower  broccolini almonds okay   The Indian offerings chicken makhani poorly spiced smoky rich enough cauliflower curry bland chicken biryani dry scary looking cannot compare any standard $11 Indian lunch buffet terms quality mention price  takes good amount space  Sushi okay your standard AYCE joint off Strip still way better due pre made long factor buffet  Chinese food slightly better quality your regular buffet offerings however still great    For roasted meats surprised prime rib overdone  closest rare basically medium well  Ribs dry   The only savory thing outstanding Peking chicken yes chicken! No duck five spice powder crispy skin made flavorful combination   During brunch did some fruit available however dinner no fruit found   Dessert disappointment general  diabetics no sugar free options Their brownies more cake like  peach cobbler used canned peaches much nutmeg really bad greasy pie crust top  peach cobbler! honest am sure call it  Bread pudding texturally mushy while panna cotta overly solid   Cupcakes wash  so called Boston cream cupcake plain flavorless yellow cake mix substandard chocolate frosting  No custard pudding    WTF? Red velvet cream cheese frosting also quite bad rather bland  Yeah don't ask happened but is   The crepe batter weird  enough butter eggs made poorer texture  cold goopy caramelized bananas did help well would better just cut fresh  crepes themselves misshapened relatively uneven thickness   The ice cream gelato selection limited 6 flavors which none really worth going back tried Nutella mint chip strawberry cookies cream   Artificial icy texture Haagen Daz Talenti supermarket tastes better   The best thing fried mini donuts cinnamon sugar  Light crispy waited hour into dinner service before available  Glad waited it   Our server quite good beginning however she slow refill glasses remove plates hour  Seeing restaurant only 50% capacity kind weird  Ambience wise brought some bad live music performer did crappy covers Eric Clapton George Michael during dinner service  Unfortunately rather loud especially when he failed hit high notes   Given paid half price experience okay paid  However full price? Definitely worth price admission  Considering your plethora options would rather pay more better quality product  Instead making rather poor renditions various ethnic food done better cheaper elsewhere should really focus improving quality basics first ie roasted meats pizza pastas ice cream offerings add few kid friendly items really good macaroni cheese   The buffet shows signs struggling now only open 3 days week Friday Sunday   guess why offering 2 1 locals  much I'd new kid town succeed still would give 2 star review comparison much better options around town  <EOR> Paid holiday brunch price Breakfast Labor Day Weekend decent buffet but doesnt measure Wynn Bellagio M Resort Aria Cosmo Caesars considering similar premium prices   many buffets choose Vegas nothig special buffet would warrant driving north       Note Mimosa Bloody Marys included premium price     Also note while most casinos reward programs  Cosmo MLife reward spending money when dine SLS does not  <EOR> If you've buffet back when Sahara you'd remember little journey take just buffet  Well SLS buffet doesn't kind journey before but still some walk main casino  Maybe such bad thing    The hours days weird Vegas buffet  only brunch dinner Fri Sat Sunday  prices decent especially if Nevada ID sign CODE card 2 1 prices   The interior nice very nice  selection presentation food also nice however some food seemed sitting awhile  plates small    The crepe station nice except poorly made  fresh made waffles nice except guy making them didn't know use waffle maker funny watching break machine see batter spill out  fresh made donuts also nice but when slow which seemed made much when wanted them cold hard  Liked seafood selection oysters shrimp crab various salmons sushi etc  dim sum served individual steamers  meats weren't greatest but good selection prime rib ribs chicken etc  During brunch fresh made order omelets   The leg room tables bad  might whack your knees   Good customer service very friendly quick bringing drinks out   In city buffets they're best value but decent 2 1 price  <EOR> Got free   sign play card The Code 500 points  u 2 free buffets good 48 hours  played $100 1000 points  If u don't use u play $40   bottomless mimosas $12 <EOR> Disappointing  $39 99 per person should ashamed themselves charge much such small weak selection food  Sunday last day before closed    I hope whoever charge SLS buffet reads into just Yelp reviews but any type feedback access to   Personally don't think location made SLS Buffet version1 0 failure  mean look other popular buffets locations other hotels strip  Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon buffet comes mind  Isn't location boonies? look Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet  also take escalator buffet area  All all really  QUALITY VARIETY bring table literally     Once entering into buffet dining area noticed change of   theming  All sudden    I thought eating some restaurant cabin woods  thought even saw some deer buffalo heads mounted walls??? = the   ?!

You judge whether buffet worth regular price $40?  It's very small buffet yet crowded all Friday night  Very few people there   I would suggest walk through before paying because selections very limited may your liking?  Because within 1 hour closing food items refreshed maintained    Funny but Rice chicken layered top refilled refreshed 9pm  But mostly without only few pieces chicken time there   Rather mix chicken lay pieces chicken top   So people pick chicken off top little rice leave pile rice   No Salad Bar speak of  Skinny Crab Legs kind worth effort? Pictures Crab Legs look bigger better person   No great selection items speak of   Sushi decent  Very good rice compared most buffets   Dessert selection freshness very good   It ok good $40 BOGO   But would gone if pay $40 person   When left casino gambling some Looong walk Valet pickup!

Food Mediocre quality food nothing really special items  local casino $10 15 selections less but little better quality     Crepes Pancake station waffle station made order  also omelette station just made crappy omelette just folded egg fries   Crepes dried probably because heat high just drying them   Pancakes decent Waffles under cooked    Meat Section BBQ Roasted ham chicken brisket ribs   Brisket extremely dry     Other buffet Items guess okay but most foods bit dry when eating     ********Brunch $12 per person unlimited alcohol drinks mimosa bloody mary house wine draft beer  Mimosa Bloodymary premade mimosa no fiz bubbly wully  Service Fantastic plates removed quick asked refill did great job explaining other services   great experience   think 3 stars mostly reflected service part whole experience     You really pay for $15 per person local special but $30 per person brunch over reach   think local special only way enjoy place   If local special no longer offered no reasons anyone visit  nothing special all <EOR> Delicious selection food! Smaller selection others mentioned  quality really good however   decor comfortable modern decent seating situation  really love hit good buffet cheat days think back check again  crepe station great feature really elevates style offerings  Having items personalized crepes omelettes always welcome situation  $40 per person  spend quality casual meal Vegas  so why some variety?  say check out  Happy Eating! <EOR> I say food really good Prime Rib oysters sushi some other things but best things dessert   Really liked chocolate cookie chocolate cake along side Salted Peanut Butter Ice Cream   I would given 5 stars but problem SERVICE   Around dinner eating time only person seating people where half buffet empty making huge line   Then when eating ANY buffet people another plate but server thought once you're done you're plate you're done   understand making mistake once every now then but girl server did 3 times within 30 minutes   little bit pain when you're eating when wait silverware drinks TWICE night   Other sure tell them you're local buy free  <EOR> I came lunch party 4 couple weeks ago which costs $30 per person  Thank goodness 2 for 1 deal when sign Code membership locals   I thought price didn't justify food  opinion choices weren't good other buffets during lunch  If price lunch $12 then see myself returning  However quality food choices available wasn't expected $30 lunch   However dessert area exceptional lunchtime  crepes cereal waffles parfaits  lunch selections ten times over  say though yogurt used parfait way sweet  close being sour   If food choices quality improve then come back  Until then many other locals casinos plenty times  know money's worth lunch there  <EOR> probably worst buffets anyone ever eat las vegas  here's why expensive buffet price comparison w caesar's bacchanal limited selection buffet items no salad bar crab legs old dry prime rib overcooked everything salty service extinct lack staff enough customers dessert station really pathetic mechanical failures i e  donut machine the only items eat would sushi  but seriously better quality bacchanal then some   pretty much left drove over chinatown eat since still hungry   if really want pay $$$ buffet don't come bacchanal buffet caesar's palace  <EOR> The statement being made quality quantity  third time first brunch  champagne flowing never look waiter    His name Perfecto! Started bagel salmon  could decide whether choose smoked wet cured     took both! Omelette  sushi fabulous  freshest ever had  Then little lamb some Asian  Another glass champagne please     But don't forget leave crepe fresh berries course whip cream  Two locals number vote buffet  Although think dinner choices better  <EOR> The buffet just OK opinion  If you're staying hotel bottomless mimosas complimentary even though staying hotel CODE members weren't giventhe 2 1 deal front staff no idea even though asked    The buffet choices just fine  Few sushi few Indian few Chinese few Italian  crab legs good  shrimps peeled deveined thats just gross messy  carving station meats meh  desserts look better taste    Considering reputation SBE good tasting restaurants buffet disappoints  But soak alcohol induced night morning free mimosas two deals bad all  <EOR> I LOVED BUFFET!!!
