Monday afternoon busy all  walked bar  bartender didn't show least 5 minutes  asked beer menu  Another 5 minutes she's nowhere found  friends grabbed table server came over  decided just order instead  sure bartender doing? Even when she gave menus she seemed unhappy there  Maybe she just having dad day? server pretty nice though  least she willing drinks  servers don't bring food  order window then yourself when done  give pager  When came time close tab extremely confusing  ticket price total? no sense  asked server explain she herself couldn't even explain it  Hopefully still working kinks system  similar Beer Park Paris games tables  But beer selection good  hoping cider type beer something more summer like  But really didn't much that  ordered old fashioned which cocktail menu  Wisconsin should known better order Vegas  But figured would good if menu? awful!

The bartender must lobotomy something along those lines he totally void any personality whatsoever  He basically ignored patrons except two young girls sitting corner bar   Now normally would start review food however start condiments NONE! Unless consider mustard pepper salt Ketchup individual diminutive pouch! Condiments! good optic!  Also don't expect real utensils everything plastic! As food fare limited less average  Hot Dog rudimentary sausage bland! roast beef sandwich excellent  Will back? Probably unless pregaming Vegas Knights game! <EOR> Highly recommend  Live music Thursday  Good prices  Pretzels fries cheese delish  Also chili dog braut good  Good selection beer average high prices ie $6 Budweiser but expected great location  <EOR> 11 2 17 came in  Asked waiter everything works  He said could sit anywhere wiped down table walked off  thought he would right back take order  10 minutes later asked if he could take order  He said counter order waiter bring you  waited long line  order in  happy hour  $4 food items  Really good deal  BUT another counter other side restaurant beer  Set weird  If youve never don't know do   Food arrived quickly  hot dog bacon wrapped dates  dates heavenly!
