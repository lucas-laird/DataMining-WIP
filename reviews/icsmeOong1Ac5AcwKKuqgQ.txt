Also honorable mention fuku fries seasoned garlic salt something else which didn't catch but believe something japanese spice decent which did seem tease taste buds good time quite well those highly recommended accompany cow platter!  The price runs $27 2 burgers fries drinks which certainly leaves your wallet feeling grand champion staff top notch  They patient took time menu well beyond capacity leave feeling welcome then certainly future!  They certainly something new stray norm normal burger sure but Fuk good don't grow square! <EOR> This place did open again Vegas  sure try it! <EOR> This place terrible   Way over priced food quantity quality    ordered burger fries    $18 50!!!  kidding me?   thought well least good quality lot food    Wrong wrong    Food mediocre best entire order fit inside little cardboard container would usually just accommodate side fries   expect ripped off Vegas but place takes whole new level    Avoid place  <EOR> Good food but still overpriced is  know when something strip charge more but don't think  always answer  menu small because doesn't take long your mind  food but don't agree paying much quick bite   The location great because near lot good things hopefully figure bring prices down little  first know place because passed food truck great see getting more popular  <EOR> After hearing great burgers really wanted place   Unfortunately didn't much it   ordered hotdog wasn't very good   also ordered garlic fries wasn't very good well extremely cold didn't care much seasoning   took bite boyfriends burger didn't satisfy either   spent $30 but barely touched food   But least staff very friendly =\ <EOR> Readers beware    Don't mislead reviews neighbor FAME  Walk visit mini food truck great burgers!! <EOR> This place fail friends family  ordered two burgers fries  Waited good 20 25 minutes    The burgers cut half thankfully were  When opening mouth take bite meat RAW!!!

But you've warned spice hot level  Again wish didnt eat group coworkers friends  bit embarrassing sweating constantly patting head napkin drinking soda   The burger meat itself delicious too  other flavors add didn't take away being able taste meat  cooked perfectly too  believe lady taking order mentions all cooked medium?   Now bit pricey when add fries soda  expect pay least around $10 per person  fries good though  seasoned come some dipping sauces top off    So definitely worth shot  said different  but good way  usual burger  Some may  fine  But if open try new things fusion flavors give place shot  couldn't give perfect score simply because seems little pricey  <EOR> It's hard chase down late night food truck when little bugger   But finally try Fukuburger!  Does live hype?  FAME Linq where Fukuburger located glorified food court lots graphic art creating hip vibrant space   Fukuburger immediately visible faux truck corner   think other tenants may suffering lack visibility even guide offered inside   Ok back Fuku    Let's start off burger togarashi fries   Unfortunately miss us   Buta burger bacon cheese pickled onion ginger bbq sauce wasabi mayo   burger patty small fries stale   served and service took long even if place wasn't packed looked very different food shots see Fukuburger truck   Somehow magic little lost permanent spot   But Naga Dog wow stellar even if bread little stale   hot link smoky savory lovely snap when bit into because deep fried   comes awesome grilled kimchi which little wilted but caramelization grill tames tangy bite    stuff spicy but exceptionally good!  complemented pickled daikon relish   creative successful alternative onions!  Then hot dog topped nori which wish more of wasabi mayo   Mmm   read supposed come kabayaki eel sauce but didn't any mine   Even if am huge fan sweet savory think would gelled beautifully spicy elements hot dog   Still really enjoyed balanced all those elements successfully   Maybe if scoot over truck perfect version   For tourists strip believe would convenient sop does job even if pricier around $2 3 per menu item    But if want little more love your plate I'd hunt down food truck  <EOR> It's time Fukuburger pronounced Foo Koo noobs permanent location  Located inside F A M E  which stands Food Art Music Entertainment which also houses other Asian food stands welcome site visiting tourists locals alike    For those new Fukuburger started originally food truck Colin Fukunaga Robert Mags Magsalin  Thus food truck theme welcomes soon enter FAME   Now important part  food  menu plain simple  Each burger number picture description  tried them all but some reason its always toss between #4 Kinoko Mushroom Burger which all beef fuku patty grilled shitake mushrooms pickled red ginger teriyaki finished wasabi mayo #5 Karai Spicy Burger which all beef fuku patty pickled cucumbers avocado cream finished habenero kabayaki   Sometimes when im real hungry both  Most cases combo Jazz Fries fries some kind gravy garlic sauce top it   Some call crack sauce very addicting   As some negatives course price pay marked up  gotta understand rent pay probably ridiculously high based fact the strip   whatever profit probably just enough cover lease overhead  probably just enough profit  lunch today Spicy Karai Burger Jazz Fries medium drink 17 some change   dollar tip when hot looking chick takes your order scream TIP JELLY!

Highly recommend! <EOR> I glad walked here  ambience welcoming such chill environment hang in  loud music which love just such great energy going here  forget name burger but delicious  don't fries separate but still give 5 stars  <EOR> This first time tried Fuku Burger  hearing Fuku Burger food truck quite some time now  am inclined chase food truck around town burger  If did ever though would burger   I over Linq heard opened Fuku Burger inside Fame  over right corner Fame  stopped grabbed few burgers to go could try famous burgers hearing about  say disappointed all   I ordered Kinko Burger Kari Burger Lucky Burger  don't know which burger which but all very good  mushrooms kinda sweet  think teriyaki sauce it  Which ever spicy favorite  really big could eat two no problem   Anyways now know why people always talking Fuku Burger food truck  Excellent burgers  would definitely recommend place if want great burger  <EOR> Decided try place since staying @ Flamingo closeby  cousin tried Tamago burger #2 Buta burger #3 Jazz fries   * Tamago burger really yummy! Something abt egg made whole burger delicious one! crispy onion strips! Buta burger okay me  patty tasted bit dry Japanese BBQ sauce seemed overpower taste burger   * Jazz fries BOMB  gravy everything made good    In addition service good  Think really silly name your order they'll proudly call when ready! LOL <EOR> Very good burgers but loud immature little punk kid music wanna b dj messed all up   Ditch aggressive trash music guys  <EOR> Great location  Great food   Girl took order ANNOYING  Wasn't helpful menu items even though first timers  can't over annoying unhelpful she was!!!! When order done she asked funny name order  confused  guess  call orders instead using real names  Which fine  However way she asked rude  Girl bye    Anyways food tasty amazing  burger egg it? Forgot called  think #1? garlic fries  delish! crack sauce  <EOR> I'm giving them 4 stars because love fukuburger's food  However if rated location overall I'd give them 3 stars  Tuesday night really slow but DJ spinning some guy rapping adding voice effects music? obnoxiously loud just weird  super place rest promenade    I placed order took really long time food  spitting maybe 1 order every 10 minutes  2 people 20 minutes later finally to go order  ordered two tamago burger  Even 20 minutes later home DELICIOUS! could eat 3 burgers row they're good  <EOR> I've never famous food truck but location conveniently located Linq! No need drive different locations during certain time food!  Ordered tamago burger say hands down best burger ever had  bun toasted bit crunchy patty nice thick rest topping just made burger perfect  Size wise thought bit smaller side?   Also ordered some garlic fries  Horrible  No garlic taste whatsoever if hadn't told would've thought just regular fries  soggy fries that  Bummer  <EOR> I Kinoko burger shared Jazz Fries  burger good but felt tad much salt   jazz fries average  ingredients tasted fresh but shame because sauces overpowering covered freshness ingredients    I think prices bit high  But they're Strip expected  girl took order very friendly  She offered some suggestions  stick place  off Strip <EOR> Yay!!! happy opened actual restaurant  never able chase down food truck  But worth wait really cool location  tried egg burger delicious  garlic fries crack sauce sauce totally lives its name addictive! Plus ordering give silly them call when you're orders ready  lot fun ideas next time  <EOR> First all prefer Fuku burger over Bachi Burger  Yes said it  Even if Fuku Burger isn't actual restaurant Bachi Burger  Only reason would even back Bachi Burger cuz oxtail fries but  besides point  Fuku burger foreals good  Tamago Burger Garlic fries hella good    Coming back sure  <EOR> I'm regular food truck similar experience restaurant  different approach great burger fries decent service good price   thumbs up  <EOR> Yes!! Thank opening location thats truck  truck but Im just glad real location now!  Checked saw show BB   I already tried Fuku before knew dope  date shared two burgers some jazz fries  share burgers try different kinds  Price good  little under 30 00 bucks 2 burgers jazz fries drink   DIY fountain drinks love those    Love those even more when plain soda water option  hint hint The guy taking order super funny asked give silly name love fun people adding entertainment place   Anyways  great no exaggerations great!! made little date night perfect always suggest friends family try Fuku    look weird when hear name but tell them try dude nothing bad place IMO  <EOR> My boyfriend regulars place! love fukuburger much unreal probably best burgers far  tamago burger jazz fries favorites would take bullet burger  recently tried katsu burger well also very good ! environment set youngins sure if place older generation eat but mean food marvelous opinion regardless! <EOR> Was must when visited vegas  oriental food section Asian food court however u wanna say it LinQ  mushroom burger over kill teriyaki sauce  Even fries couldn't off balance sweetness  Oh well least cross off foodie list  <EOR> This second time Fukuburger  first actual truck Car Meet  opinion menu over priced but quality guess could say okay  fries don't come much $4 5  burgers range $8 10 but just burger itself  Everything paid separately  If drink though $1 off  located good area sure gets lot business  people friendly  However messed order  ordered three burgers number two forgot they're called but egg onions fries crack ketchup sauce drink  When called funny nickname only two burgers  confused ended having buy another spent total almost $40  amount money three burgers little bit fries small drink kinda pushin' it  sure why order messed but other little issue bad  wouldn't something I'd crave though  <EOR>
